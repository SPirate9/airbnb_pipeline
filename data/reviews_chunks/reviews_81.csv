265901,1471890,2012-06-12,2279395,Kathy,The reservation was canceled 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
265901,1694412,2012-07-12,2884274,Joelle,"Keith (we never met Cherie) was a wonderful host. He made us feel very welcome and was flexible with our schedule. He was also helpful with giving us information about store and transit locations and recommendations. 

The space was very generous, clean and had everything you would need. There was a nice kitchen with a good variety of kitchen implements for making your own food. (The smoke alarm went off as they usually do when cooking but Keith was great about that too!) We wanted for nothing.

The location was great, just a few blocks from transit to go into downtown. It was also easy to get to.

"
265901,1906653,2012-08-06,3022050,Sophie,"Our stay with Keith and Cherie this past weekend was the epitome of hospitality! Keith checked in every so often to make sure we were safe and enjoying our stay. We hung out with his family 'til 3-4am on Saturday. Keith even gave us a last-minute ride to the airport, and with it, a super quick tour of the city and Lake Washington. Staying here was a huge part of our positive Seattle experience. "
265901,5407161,2013-06-28,3929845,Carol,"My husband and I were in Seattle attending a two day seminar downtown and stayed with Prez and Cherie. We booked their ground floor unit for its accessibility, and it worked great for us. We took advantage of their transportation business for pick-up and delivery to our destination for a reasonable fee. Their home was clean and accessible and our hosts were friendly and also easily accessible by text messages.We would stay with them again and recommend their home to others. For Seattle tourists, this would be a great base, close to light rail, near downtown, the space needle and other points of interest.  "
265901,5684476,2013-07-11,1813237,Wan Fadhilah,"Prez was a great host! he took us around the city on the first night to a beautiful viewpoint and showed us the Grey's Anatomy hospital! He got us into great clubs that night and we got to ride on his party bus on the way back! It was a great way to start our trip :) Great location, located in a safe neighborhood (we came home pretty late a few times) and the house is close to 2 light rail stations and buses and the light rail gets you to the airport or downtown which is definitely convenient! The kitchen is well stocked and we had everything we needed for the stay :) I would definitely recommend this place and it was great to meet you guys!"
265901,9210103,2013-12-13,7458530,George,"Very pleasant experience... and our hosts were great!  
It is  well located for our early morning (email hidden) Hospital.  We would stay here again when we come to Seattle. "
265901,10440200,2014-02-18,9730844,Alicia,"Seattle was the best getaway from LA!! We will be back as soon as we can and we absolutely can't thank Prez for the hospitality enough! The room we stayed in was clean, warm and comfortable. The bathroom was clean, open and there was plenty of hot water. The living room and the kitchen are sized perfectly for 4 people. They also have interesting books on the shelves. Prez gave us a key to the bedroom so we felt very trusting leaving our valuables behind. The walk to the station is about 1/2 a mile. It's a nice walk too, the houses around the block are all so nice to admire. The latest we got in from the train was 10pm, we felt safe walking back to the house. The rest of our nights we called UBER, which is super cheap and convenient. We only really used the space to sleep, shower and change clothing, we really explored the city and drove out to Vancouver. Prez was a great host and we loved our entire experience there! Thank YOU Prez and also to your father who picked us up from the station in a PARTY BUS... strip pole included!! and for driving us to the airport at 6am. Woop Woop! Next round of tequila shots on us. "
265901,10647985,2014-03-01,12372676,Lulu,"It was very nice and clean room. Location Is very  close to downtown and buses running late. Prez was very helpful, and even gave me a ride to the train station on the day I was living, so it was very nice of him. If I go back to Seattle I will definitely stay there again. "
265901,10734206,2014-03-04,3877770,Blaine,"What a perfect place!  The accessibility by car to/from downtown, Mercer Island, Capitol Hill, I-5 & I-90 was very convenient as I needed to make a bunch of visits.  The space is very spacious and complete with way more amenities than I expected.  I happened to be solo on this trip, but I could easily see using this space when I visit with my family and our kids.  This downstairs unit has two rooms, laundry, kitchen, tv, etc.  Thanks a bunch!"
265901,11717762,2014-04-13,13136412,Andrea,"I stayed with Prez and Cherie while on a short trip to Seattle, and have never experienced hospitality like this before!  Right off the bat, Prez picked me up from the airport and, it being my first time in Seattle, gave me a tour of the city before heading to the house.  The house was perfect!  Everything was super clean and I felt very safe.  It was also very quiet at night, which is definitely a HUGE plus when looking for a place to stay.  Prez continued to check in on me throughout the entire stay, which made me feel very welcomed and which I was very appreciative of, since I was a young female in Seattle by myself.  I would definitely, DEFINITELY recommend staying here.  The accommodations are very clean, and Prez went out of his way to make sure that I was doing okay throughout the trip.  5 stars!!"
265901,14449540,2014-06-19,10066190,Kara,We stayed three nights at Prez and Cherie's. The location was great and accommodation was clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend this if you are looking to stay in Seattle!
1429904,6973691,2013-09-01,729527,Sivan,"Cecilia was great, very helpful, quick to respond and a wonderful host. Her property is spotless, comfortable, cozy, well located And highly recommended - thank you!"
1429904,7002492,2013-09-02,8290402,David,Cecilia was very easy to communicate with but gave us our space in the back stand alone cottage which is what we wanted.  
1429904,7050105,2013-09-04,5226390,Catarina,"We enjoyed our stay very much, the place was very much like what she described. Very quiet and very private. Cecilia provided everything we need in the house, we enjoyed the organic tea  and coffee.... Very nice.

It s a part of Seattle that we never been before, so it' s a great chance to explore the other side of Seattle. Walking distance to bus stops to the U District and downtown. We spent an evening just exploring the area and ended up in fremont, another nice area.

Cecilia was very friendly and very helpful with directions and ideas. We would definitely love to go back!"
1429904,7266080,2013-09-13,5208871,Sharrol,"My husband and I recently stayed at Cecelia's One Room Cottage and we found it welcoming and clean.  I appreciated the board games that were available, the futon was surprisingly comfortable, and the backyard were the cottage is located had a secluded  and private feel due to strategic plantings of bamboo and other flora.  The location was perfect for us and is not far from the university district.   Cecelia graciously went out of her way to accommodate a change in our schedule and was very helpful despite a busy schedule of her own at the time of our visit.  We will definitely book with Cecelia again and recommend  her cottage to others looking for a quiet, clean, and charming place to rest after a day in the city."
1429904,7590133,2013-09-25,410598,Natasha,"Very quiet, clean and private cottage in a nice neighborhood close to UW. Great for a couple. Cecilia's check-in instructions were very easy, and she gave a great recommendation for a local coffee spot."
1429904,7903923,2013-10-07,2321039,Crystal Lynn,"The unit sits in a precious tiny garden in a lovely residential neighborhood.  The futon was really comfortable and the heat worked like a champ, so it was nice and warm in the unit.   Cecilia, whom I didn't get to meet in person but spoke to on the phone, seems nice. I really appreciate her accommodating me (and my cat) with only three days notice. 

There were a few issues with getting clear instructions on many things so I ended up locking myself out of the unit.  There was no key because I was expected to leave my luggage in the unit unsecured.  But then I got a key which was nice, but still a little unnerving that I was expected to leave things unsecured.  It's a nice neighborhood so maybe that's why!   

Unfortunately, there's not a lot of attention to detail in the place.  It's really just a big room with a bathroom.  And you have to be okay washing any dishes in the bathroom sink.  It wasn't exceptionally clean-- it was alright, but  the toilet needed a proper cleaning as did the sink and shower.  It was probably clean enough for the standards of another, but I wouldn't invite someone into my place like that.  I feel like a place should be made pristine for guests.  

And actually, the communication was really poor all along, so we couldn't find linens and my friend ended up sleeping under a throw with a towel.  Also, I couldn't figure out how to get into the place upon arriving and I had to bring in my stuff past a loudly barking dog.  He was in the house behind the glass doors, but seriously, it's not a friendly way to be greeted.  He was so agitated by my presence that I felt bad for him. 
"
1429904,8238783,2013-10-21,2270486,David,"We had a great time in Seattle. Cecilia's cottage was cozy and perfect for us (a couple). Good location, clean, surrounded by green. I'd definitively stay there again.  "
1429904,8668250,2013-11-11,1801085,Ardell,"We enjoyed our stay in Cecilia's cottage.  It was clean, comfortable and located in a nice neighborhood."
1429904,9008339,2013-12-01,178199,Paul,Cecilia was super nice and the place was definitely as-described. Great experience.
1429904,9144809,2013-12-09,283497,Jaered,"Cottage was nice and clean, quiet, and street parking was easy. Cecelia was helpful and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed while still giving us privacy. The best part, I think, is the heated floors. We needed them for all the 20 degree weather we were having!"
1429904,9402272,2013-12-27,3158288,Lawrence,"Cecilia's cottage is delightful and warm!  For us, it was ideally located and easily accessible. We'll not hesitate to stay here again in the future."
1429904,9529223,2014-01-01,10680660,Nathan,"This one room cottage is truly a gem. We had such a great experience staying here, and we can easily say that it exceeded our expectations. The place was very comfortable, clean, and well cared for. We found so many nice things that really made a difference - the comfortable mattress, tea maker, fridge, microwave, utensils, tv and dvd collection, couch, privacy, the list goes on and on. We would definitely stay here again!"
1429904,10394866,2014-02-17,11017539,Dessa,"Great place! Cecilia left us the Sunday paper, oatmeal & cream. She was very accommodating. I would definitely stay there again."
1429904,11312250,2014-03-29,9898232,Kari,"I loved staying at the cottage - it was cozy & quiet, perfect for a little retreat while visiting the city for a 2-day meeting. The cottage is surrounded by lovely spring flowers and blossoming trees and Cecilia was wonderfully welcoming - the cottage will be on my list of favorite places to stay in Seattle! "
1429904,11521531,2014-04-06,5590506,Erika,"My stay in Cecilia's cottage was perfect.  I was in town to visit UW, and Cecilia let me borrow a bike to get around.  The cottage is located very close to the Burke-Gilman trail, and I was able to ride to UW, Gas Works Park and Magnuson Park.  The cottage itself is very nice, and looks exactly like the pictures.  It was clean and comfortable.  While I did have a little trouble with the wifi, Cecilia did everything she could to fix it immediately.  Cecilia was very friendly and helpful with suggestions for me, since it was my first time in Seattle.  Overall, a great place!"
1429904,11966045,2014-04-20,13585897,Ken,"First off, the cottage is wonderfully furnished and has everything a traveler could ask for. Second off, Cecilia was an amazing host, and was wonderfully kind to my girlfriend and me the whole trip through. I was out and about, so I didn't get a chance to meet her, but she was great. 
The cottage is in a beautiful part of town and it wasn't that hard to get to using a bus. If you're in town, it's definitely worth a stay!"
1429904,12311105,2014-04-28,5843985,Annalisa,"Great little nook! It's a wonderful spot with a beautiful backyard, and Cecelia was beyond accommodating, I definitely recommend this place!"
1429904,12572167,2014-05-05,11030949,Bob,"Nice space in a garden. Clean and comfortable.  Might be an issue for people with pet allergies, my wife was congested and itchy as soon as we came in but she is super sensitive to pets and this is clearly a pet friendly place.  Me, I like pets and the cool dog artwork. Everything is nice, just be aware of the possible pet allergies. "
1429904,12850534,2014-05-12,11017539,Dessa,This was my second time staying at the cottage and once again it was lovely.
1429904,13152527,2014-05-20,8821470,David,"I stayed here for three nights with my wife. We wanted to stay somewhere close to downtown but not far, somewhere accessible to mass transit, and a place that had privacy. Cecilia's cottage met all of our needs. I met her on the first day and that was the only time we saw each other. Although I would have enjoyed more time picking her brain about Seattle our paths just did not cross again. Her place was clean and Cecilia made it feel like our own! She even let us use two of her bikes for free! Calculate your savings of not having to rent bikes when considering your stay here. Internet connection had some bumps in the road but it wasn't anything that Cecilia wasn't able to fix with a quick text message. We took advantage if the teas she had available. P.S. There is body wash in the shower so you don't have to pack soap. "
1429904,13415974,2014-05-27,8083385,Daniel,"Cecilia's cottage was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. Only a short drive from all the downtown attractions and located in a quiet neighborhood, it is a great place to relax with a bottle of wine after a long day of sightseeing. She was friendly and helpful, the perfect host."
1429904,14191454,2014-06-14,3924822,Roger,"This is a beautiful, quiet location.  The host was most gracious.  Excellent accommodations."
1429904,14275224,2014-06-16,8385619,Stephanie,"Cecilia's cottage is an incredibly homey and welcoming setting. We really enjoyed the delicious teas and amazing lighting. The neighborhood is quaint and near UW. The bed was very comfortable and left no chance of being sleepless in Seattle.

Overall, fantastic host and lovely stay at Cecilia's one room cottage."
1429904,14415535,2014-06-18,16175651,Cara,"We had an amazing time! The cottage is gorgeous, and Cecilia was super flexible, friendly and gracious. If I'm ever back in Seattle, I would LOVE to stay here again. "
1429904,14572522,2014-06-22,15973478,Patricia,"The cottage was a great quiet, comfortable  space with comfortable bed and beautiful garden.  I used the bikes to cycle on the burke gilman trail.
It had easy street parking and easy access to bus lines.
gracious and helpful host
We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again."
1429904,15314084,2014-07-07,14736658,Lesley,"Thanks Cecilia for hosting us! Everything was exactly as expected. It really made our weekend trip a lot easier. Staying so close to UW saved us lots of time. Unfortunately we did not have enough time to enjoy the back yard or the rest of the neighborhood, but everything looked great. There was clearly a little construction and improvements going on, but nothing to interfere with our stay."
1429904,16060535,2014-07-21,14296066,Ayesha,"My friend and I were visiting Seattle to attend a workshop at the university of Washington. We loved staying at Cecilia's place. She was an incredible host, and let us use her bikes! She was extremely helpful and we were both very happy staying in Cecilia's cottage. Would highly recommend it!"
1429904,16620096,2014-07-30,1782738,Marilyn,"It was so fun to stay at Cecilia's cottage in the University District of Seattle! Located on a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood street, the cottage safely tucked away in a secret garden behind the house- a truly enchanting atmosphere! The space was cute, colorful, clean, and cozy. Check in and check out process was very easy given Cecilia's responsiveness. She even left fresh berries in the refrigerator for us and offered to lend bikes to us! There are lots of board games, books, and movies in the room as well. The cottage was a comfortable place to return to after busy days in the city and it was very cool in there on hot days (rare for Seattle, I know!). Thank you Cecilia and Mr. Izzo for your hospitality!"
1429904,17295333,2014-08-10,6722743,Karsten,"Excellent room in a safe, cozy neighborhood.  These guys were warm, friendly and accommodating.  Would love to stay here again!"
1429904,18799929,2014-09-01,16961941,Karen,This was the cutest cottage. It had everything we needed for our stay. It is located in a great neighborhood and really close to the city. Cecilia was very warm and welcoming.  I highly recommend this cottage to anyone visiting the area. Her gardens are fabulous. 
1429904,19042984,2014-09-05,13312843,Christie,"This was truly a lovely place to stay! Cecilia is a wonderful host and the cottage was adorable.  Located on a quiet beautiful street, you're close enough to everything you want to visit in Seattle. 

Absolutely make the decision to stay here! :) "
1429904,19544445,2014-09-14,20363523,John,Cecilia is a fantastic host and her place is beautiful. We can't wait to go back.
1429904,19960384,2014-09-21,1522416,Chris,"We loved our stay here. The guest house was amazing, and I can't say enough about how comfortable the bed was. Cecilia made us feel right at home, and I only wish our trip hadn't been so short so we could have gotten to know her a bit better. We will definitely look her up the next time we are in Seattle!"
1429904,20369536,2014-09-28,2688902,Riley,We had a great time staying at Cecilia's cottage. Very comfortable place and accommodating host. Would definitely stay there again!
1429904,21874784,2014-10-26,16725811,Tom,"Cecilia was a great host. Her place is in a nice quiet neighborhood. Convenient to Children's Hospital and the U district. It's also not far off the Seattle bus network, so relatively easy access to the rest of the city using public transportation. Overall a great experience."
1429904,22924148,2014-11-17,52097,Arin,"What a cozy, comfortable place. Cecilia made check in easy and convenient. The heated floors were wonderful on such a cold weekend. The coffee and organic cream were so nice to have in the morning. The bed was warm and comfy. Location was perfect for what we needed. Lots of conveniences very close by.

I would love to stay here again when we're back in the area."
1429904,28323621,2015-03-22,3032931,Judi,"Lovely, warm & cozy cottage...perfect location for me to attend a yoga workshop. Cecilia was so helpful and kind."
1429904,28759134,2015-03-29,3032931,Judi,Cecilia was so kind to make sure I had what I needed to make coffee in the morning and feel so welcomed.  :)  This is the SECOND time I stayed in her cottage -- it was so nice the first time that I came back for more.  (see my previous remarks... which are also glowing with compliments)
1429904,30727996,2015-04-26,29992050,William,"Lovely cottage in a very nice neighborhood. Our host made sure we had everything we needed, and the description was entirely accurate. Great location."
1429904,31232037,2015-05-03,7392019,Janavi,Cecilia was a lovely host. She was very responsive to our needs and made sure we had a comfortable stay. Her apartment is adorable. I would definitely stay here again. 
1429904,33708553,2015-05-31,32995073,Janet,"The cottage is beautiful, clean and in a lovely setting. The location is awesome as it is accessible to shopping, parks and entertainment. Cecilia is a great hostess as she is very friendly and provides information about the area. We had a lovely time and I would recommend this place to others. "
1429904,34675884,2015-06-10,34963648,Jo,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and overall, it was a very positive one.  I had a bit of uncertainty as to how to get back to the cottage.  Once you arrive at the house walk up the driveway and take a right.  Follow the small stepping stones all the way to the side gate.  Once inside the gate, you will see the cottage.  The cottage is lovely and peaceful.  It has everything you need as far as conveniences, and the private garden area with the fountain and flowers was an added bonus.  You won't find that at any hotel.  The bed is very comfortable! Cecilia was very helpful and made sure I was settled in the first night and checked in the following night to see if I needed anything.  The neighborhood is beautiful and located in an area close to everything in Seattle.  I would stay here again.  Thanks Cecilia!"
1429904,35374047,2015-06-18,29995628,Kelly,My daughter and I were here for college visits. Cecilia and Jeff were so gracious and warm. The cottage is lovely and the stay was perfect. 
1429904,36269337,2015-06-27,320541,Rosemary,"Cecilia and her family are ideal hosts - warm, welcoming and helpful - and her cottage is well-equipped, clean and situated in a beautifully landscaped backyard. The neighbourhood is quiet and great for walking. I hope to stay there again! "
1429904,36585670,2015-06-29,35522501,Sun Fai,"The house  were nice for the price. Super clean with comfortable bed. Location is excellent, Cecilia was very friendly and helpful.thank a lot"
1429904,37045826,2015-07-04,228540,Diane,"This is truly lovely - a little bit of Narnia in a quiet corner of Seattle. Cecila & her husband are lovely: very welcoming and eager to share their local knowledge. A huge bonus was the bikes they let us use: this truly made one of our days amazing while we were there. Also if you like cats, you'll have lots of furry guys to pet as they like to hang out on the premises (this was a big plus for me). Truly a cozy getaway in the city!"
1429904,37483586,2015-07-07,18003335,Mary,"This was a lovely experience at Cecelia's cottage. I loved the quietness, the sound of the trickling fountain outside the windows, and the wonderful coffee and other surprises she left for us in the fridge.  Because we were arriving VERY late, our beds were ready and waiting for us ( including the futon). Our host and hostess were also very personable and eager to help in any way they could. I would definitely recommend this property. "
1429904,38279405,2015-07-14,11088381,Henriette,"Cecilia's cute little cottage is very conveniently located for the University district and the Burke Gilman trail. It is very cozy and cute and has all amenities except a cooking stove. Cecilia and her husband were very welcoming with even beer and cream in the fridge and coffee and tea ready to make. Tehe bikes were nice but unfortunaty too small for me to be comfortable. But I am a tall Dutch girl, and used to larger bikes"
1429904,38607009,2015-07-17,5008569,Lindsay,"Upon arrival we were greeted by Jeff who was friendly and offered some helpful tips! The cottage itself is really cute and has all sorts of amenities (phone chargers, a hair dryer, books, tea, etc). It's set in a gorgeous and pretty well-located neighbourhood for getting into downtown Seattle. It was also nice to know that Jeff and Cecilia make themselves available for help/questions via text. We had a great stay!"
1429904,38860919,2015-07-19,35042874,Krystal,"We had a seamless sand wonderful stay in this cottage. The listing was described accurately and was in one of the best neighborhoods I've been in in Seattle. The host was very helpful and explained the door code for us and after inquiring about a beach towel they immediately retrieved one for us :)


We were glad to see all the extras they offered; 2 bikes for our use w/ helmets, oatmeal packets with hot water heater, games and super soft sheets! 

We will definitely stay again if it's available."
1429904,40098860,2015-07-28,5414961,Henning,"We warmly recommend this airbnb!! Cecelia's cottage is a cosy oasis to come back to after a day in bustling Seattle. Tucked away in her garden it is quiet and peaceful. The neighborhood is a lovely residential area from which you can quickly reach the university district - be aware though that if you don't have a car the bus commute to downtown can take about 45 minutes. Cecilia was a great host, providing us with everything we needed (she was even kind enough to pick us up from the light rail when we arrived!). All in all a great experience, we would definitely stay here again!"
1429904,41225152,2015-08-05,36630215,Brian,"Cottage is exceptionally comfortable, quiet, clean, all the little things that make being away from home bearable. Location is ideal, wonderful neighborhood."
1429904,41350031,2015-08-07,7553534,Renate,"Both Cecilia and her husband made us feel welcome when we arrived. They explained everything to us with regards to the functioning of the cottage. The beds were comfortable, and we enjoyed the privacy of the cottage as well as quiet neighborhood."
1429904,41762864,2015-08-09,35167700,Sherlynn,"We loved the cottage with the beautiful hydrangeas in the garden. The cottage was VERY clean and comfortable. The hosts were very considerate to provide Starbucks coffee, organic sugar, organic tea, drinks in the fridge, DVDs, books, etc. They were also very kind to allow guests to use their bicycles. It was overall a very good experience and I would recommend this place to my friends. "
1429904,42684046,2015-08-15,31690232,Victoria,"Cecelia's backyard cottage is an oasis in the bustling city of Seattle. Quiet, comfortable, very clean. Hosts are informative, friendly and communicate well to make your stay in their city enjoyable."

1429904,43951567,2015-08-23,37329361,Jesse,"Had a very pleasant stay in Cecilia's cottage. Cozy and quiet in a nice residential neighborhood, but just blocked from the Burke-Gilman trail into town. Used one of the bikes she offered every day I was there."
1429904,45275457,2015-09-01,4723169,Jeffrey,Great host and location! Quiet neighborhood and a guest house that is equipped with everything. Would definitely stay again. Thank you for a great stay.
1429904,45815501,2015-09-06,10781380,Kevin,Cecilia made our stay in Seattle wonderful. The cottage was cozy and had everything we needed during our stay. We loved the neighborhood near the campus and it's a very short drive to downtown. We would definitely stay here again!
1429904,46256062,2015-09-08,18837521,Matt,"Cecilia was a great host. Nice peaceful setting, yet close to everything. I'd look forward to staying again. Thx."
1429904,47069293,2015-09-15,41269514,Susan,"I had a wonderful time in Seattle visiting my niece and staying at Cecilia's charming cottage!  The cottage offered everything a person could need and Cecilia was an excellent host.  It was clean and cozy.  Located behind her house, it was private and safe.  The location and amenities made for a perfect stay.  I would highly recommend this rental and will definitely return in the future.  Thank you, Cecilia!"
1429904,47702469,2015-09-21,2408717,Katy,My husband and I really enjoyed our time at this cottage. The neighborhood was nice and quiet and I would definitely return again! 
1429904,48540883,2015-09-27,38049179,Cari,Cecilia was incredibly welcoming. Her cottage has everything to make you feel comfortable and happy. Also beautiful location that is close to  the UW campus.
1429904,50211647,2015-10-10,31316189,Shannon,This little place was perfect.  It looked just like it did in the pictures.  The location was perfect and the neighborhood was beautiful.
1429904,50985000,2015-10-16,7174588,Sharon,"Peaceful, inviting cottage."
1429904,51535931,2015-10-21,42014621,Isabel,"I had an amazing time in Cecilia's lovely cottage! Everything was very well prepared for me, it was easy to find and the neighborhood is very safe. I could not have asked for a better place to stay in Seattle!"
8212989,55540175,2015-12-01,49748419,Dusty,I loved this place! Can't wait to go back.
8212989,56605879,2015-12-15,33048021,Harvest,"Loved my stay at the hostel.  The bed was pretty comfortable, bathrooms were clean and the free breakfast in the morning was a definite plus.  It was so nice to be right across the street from Pike Place market.  I could walk to all the main attractions."
8212989,58110272,2015-12-31,2712305,Clinton,"I was quite hurried the day that I booked this reservation and I did not take the time to research all the specifics. However, it was a rather interesting place. The best things about it were: Location, Security, & the Free Breakfast. Overall, my stay was too short for me to form any substantial opinions, but compared to the cost of other lodging options in Downtown Seattle (Pikes Market), this was a value. "
8446541,48474548,2015-09-26,43383025,Shelley,Conan was very friendly and helpful. The studio was just as the listing stated. It was a perfect size for me and my two adult children. Everything we needed was very close. The neighborhood was very clean and I felt safe arriving late during our stay. I would stay again!! 
8446541,48960208,2015-09-29,34876212,Louis,"The hosts were friendly and gave us our privacy. The house was clean and there was plenty of space. The price was very competitive and the neighborhood was safe and quite with good access to the freeway.
The bathroom was very nice and modern"
5959816,32635043,2015-05-19,16212311,Shannon,"Linda's place was a gorgeous space!  It had everything we needed for a full stay (kitchen goods, TV, internet, laundry).  The neighborhood is quiet and within walking distance to UVillage, with easy access to downtown via bus. Linda was very welcoming and we would highly recommend it!"
5959816,33754462,2015-05-31,30324583,Clover,"Linda is a very welcoming host. The apartment is amazing and well decorated. The location and neighborhood is also great, 5-min walk from university village, very quite and clean. I even cooked for a nice dinner with my boyfriend. It's a lovely choice. I definitely visit here again."
5959816,34498443,2015-06-08,30870694,M,"Linda was very welcoming, the neighborhood is generally quiet--as it is set off from the traffic on 25th ave.--and the listing and description does indeed reflect what you will find upon arrival: a newly renovated, comfortable, clean, and separate basement area with a bath, bedroom, kitchen (with appliances), and living room (with television).  It is about a 10-15 minute walk from the university.  There is convenient street parking with a permit, which Linda gives you upon arrival.  I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely return again."
5959816,34968431,2015-06-14,30118570,Sareth,"An extremely comfortable apartment, with plenty of space and well equipped. Perfect for visiting my son at UW. I much enjoyed be able to enjoy the Seattle sunshine in Linda's beautifully kept garden. I am also very appreciative of her flexible check-in check-out policy; I arrived an hour later than expected after flight delays in London and my flight home was not until the evening and Linda had no hesitation in say check-out was flexible and she was very happy for me to stay as long as liked on the departure day (I left at 15:35).
Thank you Linda. "
5959816,35501104,2015-06-19,31753495,Jeffrey,"Linda's home was very cozy and clean, we were very impressed with the space and would recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in seattle.  "
5959816,37961413,2015-07-12,31416625,Greta,"Great space, location and hosts. Everything about this place couldn't have been better! Loved having a clean, new apartment in such a nice setting. Being so close to U Village, UW & bike trail a bonus. Bike locker great too. Getting to downtown & other neighborhoods so easy and quick.  Hosts are welcoming, nice, and helpful. I highly recommend this place!! "
5959816,38452442,2015-07-15,18984123,Lisa,"The listing description was very accurate.  The place is very very clean, everything seems fresh and new, and there are plenty of nice touches too numerous to mention.  Great lighting, lots of windows (yes, its a basement unit, but has plenty of windows with natural light), and great lighting too.  Coffee, a few snacks, fully stocked kitchen, etc. were just a few things that will welcome you.  The neighborhood was ideal- walking distance to plenty, including the bike trail, and bike rentals.  Linda was available and responsive.   Very quiet.  Location, super nice and clean, great host.  I highly recommend staying here.  I can't think of any downsides."
5959816,38840274,2015-07-19,5641961,Sandra,Perfect!  Just as pictured.  Many thoughtful touches.  Linda and Robert are lovely.
5959816,39228673,2015-07-21,16640711,Charlie,"What a wonderful place. Robert met us as we drove up and walked us through everything. There was a book with all the local restaurants, transit, and other points of interest. He even provided a guest parking pass for the street parking.
The space was very comfortable and clean. Nothing was lacking. Met Linda the morning we left (so sorry we could only stay 2 nights!) and she was great, too. This will be a high-priority stay for us on our next trip to Seattle!"
5959816,40099273,2015-07-28,31218989,Casey,"We stayed here for a week when we visited Seattle for the first time. To be honest, I doubted that it would be as close to everything as described, but it really was! We could pretty much get anywhere in the city under 15 minutes. We were able to park on the street with no issues thanks to our guest parking pass. The guest house was very neat, quiet, and comfortable. Linda and her husband were very respectful and seemed happy to host us."
5959816,41470652,2015-08-07,39388688,Briana,"Linda made us feel very welcome and comfortable even though we showed up much later than we had originally planned. The place was great! It was clean, cozy, and in a very cute neighborhood. It has a private entrance and a wonderful shower :) There was plenty to do within walking distance, we walked to coffee and to the University of Washington. Linda provided coffee and a few snacks, a map of the area, a binder with suggestions for activities, as well as Internet access. I would definitely stay here again.  "
5959816,41946224,2015-08-10,33729482,Richard,"Linda was a great hostess, very helpful and attentive. I needed very little in the way of recommendations since I was there to visit friends who had everything plotted."
5959816,42336470,2015-08-12,40306070,Shelby,"The neighborhood was very nice. Very quiet. The location was pretty easy to get to, and the space was exactly like the pictures showed. It was really comfortable and felt like home. Linda was very sweet, and accomodating when we had certain requests. Overall a great experience, and we'll definitely be back again. :)"
5959816,43281178,2015-08-18,39615753,Arianna,"Wonderful stay. The place was adorable, clean, and tidy. Perfect for a nice couple getaway. Quiet and Private. Great walkable neighborhood. Easy access to all areas of the city!! Thanks again for a wonderful experience!!!!"
5959816,44043750,2015-08-23,41499602,Kevin,"Great stay in a great neighborhood-- everything was perfect, fully functional, and as described. The place is perfect for visiting a UW student, or a great home base for seeing the city. We felt very welcome and were impressed by both the quality of the place and the nice touches to convey hospitality."
5959816,44703133,2015-08-28,19392733,Mar,"El apartamentó nos encantó, es muy bonito y acogedor. Ellos son geniales y atentos en todo momento. La zona está muy bien. Altamente recomendable."
5959816,45107790,2015-08-31,38829215,David,"Lots of welcoming touches - a pitcher of filtered water, snacks, coupons for visitors, coffee.  Quiet Ravenna street with ample parking, but just one block from tons of retail along 25th.  VERY comfortable and private basement apartment that still gets great natural light and ventilation.  Will return with pleasure..."
5959816,45621340,2015-09-04,42687837,Robert,Excellent place. Everything was clean and comfortable. 
5959816,45979098,2015-09-07,23723303,Jiechao,"Very nice and helpful, waiting for us even in the evening

The house was as good as the photo shows"
5959816,46980527,2015-09-14,10109474,Linda,"Location, location, location is the word for this lovely apartment.  Linda had a tremendous amount of information about Seattle and the surrounding areas, as well a numerous books about the area.
The kitchen is well equipped.  The bedroom and bathroom both had nice touches that showed real care for the setting."
5959816,48542223,2015-09-27,41429059,Carly,"This b&b is so cute! We enjoyed our stay so much!! Linda and Robert had everything ready for us, like towels and coffee.  It's also a nice walk to the UW campus and some coffee shops and pubs. We would definitely stay here again!"
5959816,50255494,2015-10-10,8361718,Jay,"Linda was there to great me, and I enjoyed the madeline cookie and Ghirardelli chocolate square!"
5959816,50718767,2015-10-13,20128842,Abi,Linda & Robert were great hosts! They made me feel very welcome and had a wonderful home. Lots of nice homely touches awaited me on arrival. Highly recommend them!
5959816,51211289,2015-10-18,40982116,April,Loved our stay! Everything was perfectly clean comfortable and new. Great location. Very nice and we will definitely stay again.
5959816,52372843,2015-10-28,34370887,Keith,"Excellent host! Very easy to contact and was very friendly to speak with. She was very happy to accommodate anything I needed as well, even though everything was already taken care of and ready for us!"
5959816,53153751,2015-11-05,2762776,Jessica,"This was a marvelous place to stay. Linda was very communicative and clearly explained everything about the apartment. The apartment itself is very nice and well laid out. The location is ideal: close to Uvillage, the UW, the center of Ravenna and Green Lake. "
5959816,54034258,2015-11-15,47571521,Jeff,"Very friendly, helpful host and nice, large space. Great location, convenient to walkable dining options and a short drive to many of Seattle's most interesting neighborhoods and UW. Parking was included and easy. Great shower and bathroom. Was my first Airbnb rental and was much better than hotel stay that would have cost significantly more."
5959816,55318344,2015-11-29,48405422,Ruina,Linda was great host! I love my experience in Seattle! I would be back next time!
5959816,57475641,2015-12-26,8821837,Sarah,I arranged for my aging mom to stay at Robert and Linda's during Christmas. My mom has mobility issues (she uses a cane) and this little apartment was an accessibility dream!! This was Mom's first time at an airbnb and Linda and Robert went out of their way to make my mom feel welcome and to help her figure out the idiosyncrasies of the space. It is beautifully finished and decorated and my mom reports that the bed is very comfy! I will definitely recommend Linda and Robert's to friends and family visiting in the future.
7789264,45424267,2015-09-02,34918,Gail,"Christy was fabulous!   Very welcoming.  Just transformed her space into a suite... main room w kitchen and bedroom w bath.  The beds in the bedroom were awesome.  Everything was clean and fresh.
She had fresh home made granola and fresh fruit."
7789264,46185830,2015-09-08,38828691,Simon,"The space was exactly as seen in the photos, very clean and recently refurbished.  The rooms are absolutely perfect for launching excursions into Seattle - downtown is only a few minutes away, and there are local restaurants,  coffee shops and stores if you don't feel like driving - the neighborhood is very walk or bike friendly.  

Christy and Bill were very friendly and welcoming - there if you needed them, but otherwise left us to enjoy our  holiday.  Homemade granola and breakfast was provided for our first morning.  I have no reservations recommending Kale Garden - Book now!"
7789264,46804902,2015-09-13,10441837,Allison,"Christy was an excellent host and easy to communicate with!  She made sure that all the necessities and even some extras were present.  The instructions for check-in and wi-fi were clear and there was great additional information about the bus and nearby attractions.   
The apartment was clean, comfortable, and in good condition and we would happily recommend the Kale Garden Apartment to a family member in the future."
7789264,47283810,2015-09-17,42328551,Kimberly,"Just stayed at the Kale Garden Apt and it was wonderful.  We needed a location close to our daughter and it was a perfect fit.  Everything was new, clean and comfortable.  The king size bed is a dream, the kitchen was well stockded"
7789264,48774345,2015-09-28,43725319,Neil,"We stayed here in late September. The apartment was as advertised, Christy was very friendly and accomodating. The best part is the food she left for us. Very convenient. Would definitely recommend it."
7789264,53864052,2015-11-13,45558258,Ashley,"We had a great time at Christy's place! The location is terrific...minutes from the northgate mall and very convenient to access downtown Seattle. The mini kitchen had everything we needed....fridge, gas stove, and a well stocked kitchen...there was even milk and beverages in the fridge and granola for breakfast, even some goldfish crackers for our toddler! Not to mention a great selection of teas :) Definitely recommend this place if you're looking to stay in Seattle!"
7789264,55724770,2015-12-05,30375777,Xiaoyu,"The location is very good, near Northgate Mall, QFC and other shopping place, the room very bright, breakfast is amazing, there are everything you need,the greatest point is Christy was very nice,she helped us alot,and we had a great thanks giving together, if you are coming to seattle,this is definitely the very top choice."
7789264,56500645,2015-12-14,9876544,Elizabeth,Apartment was very clean and spacious. Christy was welcoming and friendly. It was a perfect place for us to stay while visiting our daughter who lives near by. Plenty of space to make dinner for her and her friends. We had an early Christmas together in the apartment. We will definitely stay there again next we go to Seattle.
7789264,56927805,2015-12-20,48015111,Gabriel,"Super great place -- very clean, comfortable, spacious, well set up, and well located. Really nice neighborhood, very quiet and pretty. Christy was very flexible with both check-in and check-out times, and overall very pleasant to interact with. Will certainly return next time I'm in Seattle."
2994309,13256488,2014-05-23,1893319,Ireta,"Stephanie and Darren are terrific hosts. The apartment is new and beautifully furnished. It has all the conveniences one needs to make your stay very enjoyable. Thank you both.
Ireta"
2994309,13759600,2014-06-03,15527364,Kenny,"Just love it, nice area close to everything. 5-10 minutes drive to downtown. The place is clean and very comfortable. Definitely will come back."
2994309,13863958,2014-06-06,1822115,Leah,"Darren & Stephanie's place was incredibly comfortable, with all the amenities of home.  Great location, great hosts, we will definitely stay again.  Thank you!

"
2994309,14199194,2014-06-14,15867619,Alfa,What an amazing place and wonderful hosts! Their attention to detail is remarkable (e.g. they left fresh baked cookies in the kitchen and mints on the night stand) and the decor is top notch. They really take great care of their apartment. Everything is extremely clean and everything looks new. The location is great and  drive down I-5. Could not have been happier. Definitely would come back (inc. with wife/kids). 
2994309,14289660,2014-06-16,251821,Linda,"Had a wonderful stay at Darren and Stephanie's beautiful apt.  Loved the location, the decor and the small touches (cookies, coffee, Trader Joe products).  Very clean and comfortable bed.  Close to I-5 however the noise wasn't too bad inside the apt.  Easy street-side parking.  Absolutely enjoyed our stay while visiting for my son's UW graduation."
2994309,14478535,2014-06-20,13559856,Michelle,"What an excellent"" home away from home"". They were wonderful hosts. The rental was super clean and location was wonderful.. so much to do in short distance.. Definately will not be disappointed.. 1st pick when we return =)"
2994309,14620609,2014-06-23,15061500,Britt,"Our stay at Stephanie & Darren's apartment was wonderful! There were 5 adults and we were all very comfortable. The apartment was very well kept, clean and in a great location. The neighborhood was quiet, even though it was located close to the highway. But this made it easy to get to and from everywhere we went. We loved having access to a full kitchen as well as a washer & dryer. Our only complaint would be parking. Parking was fairly limited due to the nature of the neighborhood, and we had traveled in two cars so sometimes it was difficult to find a spot for both vehicles. However, this would definitely not deter us from staying there again. 10/10 would recommend!   "
2994309,17203126,2014-08-09,14857216,Katie,"We had a fabulous stay at Darren and Stephanie's apartment! We stayed several weeks and the setup was perfect. I really appreciated that the apartment was fully decorated and furnished, unlike some bare-bone rentals. We had everything we needed - comfy beds, fully-stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, and even a few little extras like fresh coffee and creamers and local beer in the fridge.

Over the course of the weeks a couple issues came up, like a broken garbage disposal, and our hosts were very efficient and friendly in resolving the problem immediately. 

If you have a car or bike, or don't mind a 15-20 minute walk, the neighborhood is great! Many coffee shops, restaurants and bars in the Wallingford/Greenlake area and you're also RIGHT by the freeway for easy access downtown. We also walked right up to a school playground often, as we had an infant with us. 

As hosts, Darren and Stephanie gave us plenty of privacy, but made it clear that they wanted us to be as comfortable as possible, and we were! Super nice and friendly folks. We hope to stay again next summer."
2994309,17676142,2014-08-16,5816774,Colleen,"Stephanie and Darren's apartment was perfect for our family of 4 (2 adults and 2 teenagers) - extremely clean, nicely appointed and super comfortable.  Close to I-5 so very convenient, traffic could get a bit noisy but closing windows took care of that.  Great kitchen set-up equipped with coffee, good video system. Hosts were very friendly and helpful. All around great stay.  Definitely will be our go-to for our next Seattle trip.  Thank you!"
2994309,17930679,2014-08-19,15587767,Craig,"We were a little worried that our family of 4 adults and 2 children would be tripping over each other in a 2 bedroom apartment; but, we found the suite more than met our needs. Even the pull out couch was comfortable (we'd like to know where we could buy one?). Our toddler loved having access to on demand cartoons when we weren't out and about and we were glad to have a full  kitchen to save a bit of money on meals. It was so much better than any hotel room arrangement we could find and well worth the money. Stephanie was very friendly and helpful - we didn't meet Darren as he was away during our stay. The noise from the I5 was a bit loud with the windows open; but, once everything was closed up, it was quite peaceful. We would highly recommend this suite to anyone interested in a comfortable place to stay just outside of the city."
2994309,18311485,2014-08-25,16902382,Cynthia,"We were attending our daughter's wedding in Seattle and this place was perfect for us to stay. We appreciate very much that Stephanie came to greet us when we arrived almost at midnight on Thursday. The spacious kitchen and living area and laundry unit made us feel at home. They made sure we had everything we need and yet respect our privacy. Everything has been done professionally and we definitely will recommend this place to others. 
Thanks again, 
Cynthia"
2994309,18534143,2014-08-28,832760,Cheryl,"Darren and Stephanie were welcoming and flexible, which made everything seamless for me. The apartment is very nice and clean, and the nice toiletries and a well-appointed kitchen were lovely added touches. The neighbourhood is easily walkable to UW and many bars and restaurants."
2994309,18915939,2014-09-02,20382923,Lindsay,"The condo was immaculately done.  Great furnishings, finishings, cleanliness, and layout.  The place was a hidden gem.  The place felt very spacious and we would definitely choose to stay there over a hotel again.  The place was conveniently close to the I-5 entrance/exit so it was very easy to get around the seattle area.  The hosts did an excellent job having a package waiting upon arrival of recommended restaurants and places to go in the area which was very helpful."
2994309,19197836,2014-09-08,17687187,Emily,"We had a great experience with this listing!  The apartment was beautiful and very clean.  The hosts were quick to respond to any questions and they provided a list of suggestions for food,  drinks,  and sightseeing around Seattle as well! Thanks for letting us stay in your beautiful home!  I would definitely recommend this place to others!"
2994309,19337312,2014-09-10,19953179,Tammy,One of the most amazing homes away from home.  Attention to detail is perfection.  Can't wait to go back to Seattle again and stay here.

2994309,20489183,2014-09-30,1972700,Nicole,"We had a wonderful stay at Darren's and Stephanie's place! The apartment is very spacious and tastefully decorated. The bed was very comfortable and guaranteed a nice rest after all the shopping. The location is great, not too far from downtown and close to the Highway, which provides quick access to anywhere you want to go. Even though, we never met in person, they left a list with recommended coffeehouses, restaurants and bars, which was really helpful. I would definitely recommend this place!"
2994309,20895085,2014-10-07,17373247,Elizabeth,Our time in beautiful Seattle was further made pleasurable by the wonderful accommodations. The place was centrally located to local grocery stores and a zoo. The beds were very comfortable and cookware and dinnerware made it easier to have homemade meals away from home. A list of local restaurant recommendations and grocery stores also made it easy to navigate our way around the area near the home. It was a truly wonderful experience staying here.
2994309,21278335,2014-10-14,5394966,Sohrab,"Stephanie and Darren get full marks for being great hosts. The spotless flat is exclusive (fresh flowers, comfy beds and linens, high quality towels etc.)! 

We loved the fact that the flat was fully equipped allowing us to enjoy it as if it were our own. 

I can only reiterate the positive comments of the other guests. 

Do yourself a favour and book with them before they raise the prices!"
2994309,21588030,2014-10-20,20668366,Matthew,We really enjoyed our stay at the basement apartment. It has very nice finishes and is really well appointed.  In addition the location is convenient to access several cool areas in Seattle and just minutes from downtown and the Pike's Place Market. We would definitely stay again; Darren and Stephanie are wonderful hosts.  
2994309,22106892,2014-10-30,21703863,Theresa,"The apartment was extremely cozy and welcoming, and Stephanie and Darren made themselves available if we had an questions. The location was very conveniently located near the highway so we could easily drive downtown. There were plenty of restaurants and grocery stores nearby as well. We really enjoyed our stay there. "
2994309,22341426,2014-11-03,23047273,John,"Very clean, comfortable, very spacious, well decorated and modern.  Really liked the leather furnishings and countertops, also kitchen island with counter stools and separate dining nook, and the high end home theater was very nice for unwinding at the end of the day.  Xbox with some games was a really nice touch. Safe, quiet neighborhood.  Two bottled waters, coffee, tea, creamers, and some condiments were available for us in the well appointed kitchen.  Nice quality shampoo, conditioner, body wash were all provided in the shower, as were two sets of nice towels.  It says ""2 bedroom,"" but we only found one bedroom as the other interior doors were locked.  Not sure if there is another bedroom and it just wasn't open because they knew it was just me and my girlfriend staying there, or if the second ""bedroom"" is a reference to the fold out couch bed in the living room, which we just didn't have occasion to try.  In any case, it was lovely, easy to find, close to I5 but not at all noisy, and very affordable.  I travel around the country frequently for business and pleasure, maybe eight to ten short trips a year, with maybe half to Seattle.  I'm a little spoiled by my experiences with four and five star hotels paid for by business conferences.  This was my first airbnb booking, and based on this great experience, I may swear off hotels altogether.  A really nice hotel has nothing on this place, and the extra space to stretch out and get comfortable is sooo much nicer than a hotel.  I'd expect to pay _at_least_ $400 or more per night for similar accommodations in a hotel.  So Darren and Stephanie have definitely got the price point right to make this a great value.  I didn't talk to my hosts during our stay, but in my opinion, that's A-OK.   Thanks very much guys, and I look forward to staying with you again.  Highly recommended."
2994309,22979133,2014-11-19,21211545,Barbara,"Wonderful!
We arrived around midnight and found the property and entered the apartment with no problem! The location was super convenient for getting downtown and everywhere else! It is located right next to the highway, so if you have a problem with traffic noise you might want to look for another place. But, I am a very light sleeper and after one night the sounds didn't bother me! The apartment looks like it was recently remodeled! Photos don't do it justice. It is very spacious! The washer and dryer came in handy. The beds were very comfortable and warm. Large kitchen with all the tools you need! I had requested more towels and Stephanie was down right away with another set! It was great being able to come and go as you want, eat in or out! I am a very picky person and this property met my standards!!!"
2994309,23811746,2014-12-11,22504608,Chris,"When we arrived the place was very clean and Darren and Stephanie had left us a bottle of wine, which was most welcome after the drive. The place was great and well setup with plenty for the family. The  apartment is close to public transport into town and the University is within easy walking distance. We all had a great time. Thanks.

2994309,24295334,2014-12-25,78861,Meghan,"We had a great stay - the house has modern finishes and probably one of the better AirBnB's we've stayed at. We found the beds to be really comfortable and almost all the amenities we could ask for. In addition, it was really convenient to I-5, so easy to get around Seattle. Thanks for the lovely stay!"
2994309,24606143,2014-12-31,3318013,Erin,"A clean, cozy environment with easy access to the highway. A very good experience for our first Airbnb experience.

2994309,25690146,2015-01-23,25757407,Philip,Stephanie made sure she was available for any questions. She left the apt. clean and ready for us. Everything was as advertised. We would love to stay there every visit to Seattle. The neighborhood is very safe feeling and friendly.
2994309,28177061,2015-03-19,4286096,Sarah,"We enjoyed everything about our stay at Stephanie and Darren's listing! The space and amenities were very thoughtful, and we were very comfortable during our stay. Definitely a home away from home, with all the amenities!"
2994309,28614685,2015-03-27,28698381,Richard,"A wonderful place, very comfortable sofa and beds.  Yes, it's right next to a busy highway, but as others have said, the noise is not very noticeable, especially after the first day.  Clean, many amenities, including your own kitchen with stovetop, oven, microwave, dishwasher and large fridge, and clothes washer and dryer in a closet.  We stayed for 8 days, very restful after long days of driving between Seattle and Tacoma to see our college student daughter. Would definitely recommend."
2994309,28989271,2015-04-02,13264795,Kymberleigh,"Darren and Stephanie's place was lovely.  It was nicely decorated, but still kid friendly (the chalk wall in the dining nook was a big hit!)  The pull out sofa was the most comfortable I have ever experienced (I noted the model so I could look into purchasing one for my own home)  and plenty of pillows and blankets were provided.  The apartment is convenient to the freeway and only a short walk (maybe 10 minutes, max) from several bus stops.  We greatly enjoyed our stay and plan to return when we next visit Seattle!"
2994309,29492208,2015-04-08,4937348,D.,"We LOVED it here! Darren and Stephanie couldn't have been more accommodating and kind. The place is really in a fantastic location in terms of getting around and parking, and it's so nice and cozy inside. Really sweet. We appreciated it so much after long days tooling around.The bedrooms are incredibly comfortable and we slept like logs. Thanks Darren and Stephanie! See you again next trip hopefully!"
2994309,29839539,2015-04-13,13646102,Ellen,"I did not get a chance to meet Darren or Stephanie but communication was really easy as was check in.  Their place was perfect for visiting my daughter at UW and Wallingford is a great neighborhood.  Would definetely stay again! 
Thank you,
Ellen"
2994309,30315815,2015-04-20,29545575,Vivian,"Stephanie and Darren has the best place. Everything is just like in the pictures except it is much bigger.!!! The house is equipped with a big and full kitchen, nice TV with good sound system and it is walking distance to Restaurants, supermarkets, UW, coffee shops and church. One thing worth to mention, they have umbrellas in each of the bedrooms. You don't need to worry around rains in Seattle, you will be in good hands with Stephanie and Darren. This is the place I would stay if I visit Seattle again. Thank you! Stephanie and Darren! "
2994309,30522049,2015-04-23,23248462,Chris,"Great location, superbly appointed, ultra-clean, with attentive (unobtrusive) owners describe this U Dub-close option. We were really happy and very satisfied with our three nights' stay. "
2994309,30891974,2015-04-28,13780106,Leslie,"My friend and I had a fantastic stay at Stephanie and Darren's cute apartment. Stephanie met us and showed us around the apartment and reviewed any important details. She and her husband live upstairs and the apartment is downstairs- they are separate apartments. Stephanie was very nice and helpful. She had a list of restaurants and other local businesses printed in the apartment. The apartment was very clean, two very comfortable beds, nice linens, and updated kitchen and bathroom. The apartment's décor was interesting, very quaint and clean. The neighborhood is a very safe suburban area right off the freeway. We were able to walk to restaurants. The free parking was on the street in front of the neighbor's house, which was fine. I felt very safe. The neighborhood is also well kept up and nicely landscaped. It took about 10 minutes without traffic to get to downtown Seattle. I highly recommend Darren and Stephanie's apartment!"
2994309,31609074,2015-05-07,32090332,Tiffany,"It was perfect and just as described!
We are already planning our next trip back.

Thank you, Darren and Stephanie!!"
2994309,32319921,2015-05-17,34704,Laura,"This place is absolutely amazing! My husband and I along with a friend stayed here for 3 nights while we visited Seattle. The area was great, easy access to bus stops, and about a 10 minute work to shops. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is going to visit Seattle. Stephanie came to introduce herself the day we arrived and there was a very handy reference book that had everything you need to know while in Seattle, and some recommendations on restaurants etc. Would stay again and again in a heartbeat."
2994309,33259830,2015-05-26,29600834,Andrea,"Lodging in Darren and Stephanie's home was nothing less than excellent! The home is very clean and has beautiful decor inside and out! Myself and two cousins of mine stayed here for 3days and were heartbroken when we had to check out because that is just how comfortable they made us feel! The pictures posted do not do this home justice, beautiful home, nuff said :) 
Cannot wait to come back! "
2994309,34417642,2015-06-08,30277942,Kenneth,"Stephanie and Darren have a great apartment and i was better than I expected.  My two friends and I stayed there for a few days.  We also have a friend who lives nearby and so it was very convenient to stay here.  The accommodations were extremely comfortable.  The place was spectacularly clean.  The amenities were high end.  There was a guide to nearby restaurants, a guide to use the entertainment system, and there was even complimentary Keurig coffee.  All in all a great experience for my first airbnb stay.  I will definitely contact them again when I visit Seattle again. "
2994309,34716315,2015-06-11,20583577,Karen,"The apartment was exactly like the photos.  Spotlessly clean and nice decorated.  It also felt spacious.  The location was excellent being near the U of W and also near I-5 entrance.  Stephanie called to see if everything was satisfactory and when I told her we need more bath gel in the shower (the bottle was empty), she promptly replaced it later that day.  The only thing to be aware of, due to the close proximity of the interstate, you do hear traffic noise.  By the third morning, I wasn't bothered.  Over all, very nice accommodations with excellent hosts."
2994309,35199440,2015-06-16,28059682,Xin,It is a great experience living in this apartment! Both Darren and Stephanie are really nice and the location is really convenient. The apartment is nice with everything equipped and many cute decorations.
2994309,35482830,2015-06-19,31945322,Sherrill,"Our stay at Stephanie and Darren's was amazing. Will definitely come back. Such kind and caring couple. Great location to downtown and beautiful home. Recommend it to anyone. Great quiet and zen suite to stay at. Thanks again, everyone loved it. "
2994309,35908425,2015-06-23,2743859,Shinho,"Book this place NOW! Darren and Stephanie have such a beautiful home to stay in. It had all the necessary essentials and more. The decor was very clean and modern. This was one of the nicest places we have stayed during our travels. So much better than a hotel where you don't have all the comforts of home. It was super quiet even though it was next to the freeway. The neighborhood was nice and quiet with plenty of street parking unlike the downtown area where parking is so limited and expensive. The location was very close to all the sights and attractions. This should definitely be your ""home away from home"" when visiting Seattle. "
2994309,36795707,2015-07-01,9623764,Paul,"Really enjoyed our experience.  Everything was clean, tidy, and honestly represented.  Stephanie was very nice and helpful.  The location is very convenient, right by the highway, so getting to and from the house was straightforward.  Thank you again!"
2994309,37544464,2015-07-08,6716665,Gary,"The apt was as booked, due to the rare heat they helped with 3 fans. Everything was perfect and would recommend this apt. to everyone.  A little loud being so close to Rt. 5 and the windows open.  Easy to get to and close to Green lake."
2994309,38257162,2015-07-14,29940584,Beverly,"Wow what an amazing place! It looks EXACTLY like the pictures - beautifully and comfortably decorated, very quiet (even though it's close to I-5), 2 comfy queen beds. No need to bring shampoo, conditioner, body wash, blow dryer - it's all here. We used the washer/dryer (det pods/ dryer sheets furnished). Large TV in den with cable. We stayed here because it's a mile from my daughter's apartment and it's easy to get anywhere in town from here. Would definitely stay here again! What more could you truly ask for? You will be SO glad you stayed here!!!!"
2994309,38612118,2015-07-17,32616517,Bridgette,"I can't even begin to describe just how perfect Darren and Stephanie's apartment was for our family's vacation in Seattle! It is perfectly located, very clean, well stocked and fully private.  We came and went as we pleased, which was perfect for us. I really wish we could just pick this place up and take it with us on every vacation!  The pictures just done do this place justice, it's even better than it appears in the photos! I recommend you book now!"
2994309,38998298,2015-07-20,7595141,Rosanne,"This little apartment was great! It was clean and very aesthetically pleasing.  We happened to be visiting Seattle at one of the hottest weekends of the year, and although there was no air conditioning, our hosts provided large box fans placed at each window so that all the rooms were still cool and comfortable.  The location is literally right next to the highway, so if you leave your windows open you can hear the cars zoom by; however, this didn’t bother us at all.  We really liked how the kitchen and the living room was just one big open space.  We ordered pizza one afternoon, and for a few hours just sat around the island and on the couches and watched TV.  The bathroom was clean and stocked with all the essentials.  I had brought everything I needed with me, but it was reassuring to see that if I had forgotten anything, it was provided by the hosts already.  One thing that the apartment didn’t have was long mirrors.  We were all visiting Seattle to attend a wedding, and there were no long mirrors to make sure our “outfits”.  There were only two mirrors (in the bathroom and near the front door). Both stopped at chest level.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider staying at this location again.  Thank you!"
2994309,40307490,2015-07-30,6842497,Alisa,"We enjoyed our week-long stay at Darren & Stephanie's lovely apartment. The photos are accurate, but the apartment is even better in real life! We especially enjoyed the comfortable bed, the great shower, the roomy and well-stocked kitchen, and the washer and dryer. We appreciated having fans, plenty of towels, and even umbrellas. Parking was never a problem, which is not always the case in Seattle's residential neighborhoods. Access to the interstate was super easy and we almost never heard the traffic. We appreciated the 10-page booklet on restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc., as well as the instructions for using the huge TV.   We will definitely be staying here again."
2994309,40901027,2015-08-03,21044358,Meghanne,Beautiful place and great host!
2994309,43225175,2015-08-18,6345569,Yuan,We are so happy to choose Stephanie's house. It's really good and comfortable during our stay. The sofa bed is the perfect and best one which is I have ever used before. we will definitely come back again！
2994309,43620861,2015-08-21,34954115,Jessica,"Apartment is beautiful and very comfortable . Close to the freeway and Downtown. Games and chalkboard  in the apartment are a nice treat for the kids.
 "
2994309,44293598,2015-08-25,2324202,Ralph,"A very wonderful and welcoming experience, just great, from initial inquiry to departure.  Listing was accurate; apartment is lovely, elegant, large, roomy and comfortable. Thank you Stephanie and Darren!"
2994309,44900455,2015-08-30,16821784,Lena,"We enjoyed staying at Darren & Stephanie's apartment. The kitchen, living area & bedrooms were very spacious and comfortable. There was some noise from the nearby highway during nights, so if you are very sensitive to noise, you might want to consider finding a place in quieter surroundings. Apart from that, everything was great, and Stephanie was very nice & communicative. "
2994309,45671833,2015-09-05,12895681,Monica,"The area was perfect, close enough to Green Lake so we could go for a walk there every day.  The apartment was spotless - really comfy, a great set up and everything was labeled if you needed instructions. Nice solid beds, with enough pillows to suit anyone's taste, with super smooth sheets. We really enjoyed our stay and highly recommend their place! "
2994309,46119222,2015-09-08,13189875,Paulina,"Darren and Stephanie's apartment is wonderful!  We really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is a very comfortable size, the location is convenient, it's immaculate, and has all needed amenities (and more)!  Perfect for both short and extended stays."
2994309,46697095,2015-09-13,11939586,Lindsay,"Such a beautiful apartment! Bigger than it seems in the pictures, clean (so so clean), lovely comfy beds, lovely shower. Would absolutely stay here again. Stephanie was super helpful and sweet. Thanks! "
2994309,47177911,2015-09-16,38265174,Paul,This was a very nice place in very cool part of Seattle. This made for a great base of operations. 
2994309,48065640,2015-09-23,35429586,Joshua,"While we didn't have a chance to meet Darren and Stephanie, we still felt very welcome in their home. The apartment was very clean, organized, and fully stocked for what one would need. 
We were in town for a wedding as a part of the wedding party, so while this was a very busy weekend for us in Seattle, it was so nice to come back from a stressful day to a comfortable place to rest and relax. The location is conveniently located to downtown, I-5, and all that the Seattle area has to offer. There is plenty of parking on the street and the neighborhood is quiet. Lovely place to stay!"
2994309,48503064,2015-09-27,8189585,Lori,"This was an absolutely lovely apartment. The hosts have seen to every detail to make the stay comfortable. Everything is super clean and the unit appears to be very recently renovated. They even have a friendly cat that lives in the driveway and is there to greet you every time you leave or return. :-) The house is fairly close to a busy freeway, and we were a little worried it would be too noisy, but the bedrooms are toward the back and we weren't bothered.  We didn't do any real cooking while we were there - just cereal and coffee - but the kitchen was well stocked with all the essentials. We have a daughter attending university in Seattle, so we will definitely consider staying here again."
2994309,49220145,2015-10-02,40434794,Sar,"Thanks to Darren and Stephanie for this wonderful home-away-from-home. Great for couples and families alike, you will love staying here. The location is superb, too. We were so close to everything we wanted to visit that it made Seattle feel (almost) like a small town. As others have mentioned, the highway is very close and you should expect to always hear it. It was a bit louder than I expected, but it eventually became background noise and never disturbed our (or our toddler's) sleep. 

Darren and Stephanie were accessible and friendly without being intrusive. At one point I was looking for a baking sheet and Stephanie brought one of her own for me to use. I hope you get to stay here! You'll love it. "
2994309,51723296,2015-10-24,24737460,Kyle,"This apartment was spacious, clean, and had an excellent location for exploring all over Seattle. Highly recommended."
2994309,52319477,2015-10-28,18751984,Candice,"Stephanie and Darren were great hosts! Their home was perfect for our 4 day visit in Seattle. Everything was very modern, and the beds were extremely comfortable. All of the touristy attractions were within 15 minutes of where we were staying. I would definitely recommend staying at their home."
2994309,52968836,2015-11-03,32500778,Candy,"Stephanie and Darren were very helpful and welcoming. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed. Loved the contempory style of the apartment. It  was perfect for myself and my adult son, who traveled with me. The neighborhood was nice and bus stops were closeby. "
2994309,53636938,2015-11-10,37130358,Justin,Stephanie was incredibly accessible before and during my stay which made some complicated arrival-logistics very simple.  The unit was exactly as pictured and the few guests that swung by were all quite impressed with the location.  The fully-stocked kitchen made cooking a breeze and it was very comfortable to spend time in this apartment.  I do not have any complaints as nothing was unexpected or unpleasant.  10/10 would rent from again.
2994309,54247683,2015-11-17,1662809,Debi,"What a great apartment!  It was so comfortable, clean, very modern, and so conveniently located (just one block to catch a bus that went right downtown!).  Stephanie was so sweet and helpful, but not the least bit intrusive.  Would return to stay here in a heartbeat!"
2994309,54510780,2015-11-21,25757407,Philip,"Hostess left a welcome back bottle of wine, as this was our second stay. obviously we enjoy the house and neighborhood. We recommend it to anyone we know traveling to Seattle."
2994309,54984111,2015-11-27,29715443,Michelle,Love Darren and Stephanie's place.  Exactly what the pictures are shown.  It's cozy and comfortable.  5 of us felt like staying home!  We couldn't wait to get back there from outside cold weather!  Stephanie was very friendly and has all the local information listed for us.  One of my best experiences in Seattle! 
2994309,55193965,2015-11-29,43630476,Kristin,Great place in a location that is convenient to public transportation.  The apartment was cozy and matched the description provided.  Would gladly stay here again.
2994309,56121061,2015-12-09,47203816,Kelly,"The pictures of the apartment are 100% accurate! What a lovely home and neighborhood. It is right off the interstate however noise was not much of a factor. I could hear it when going to bed at night but not enough to keep me awake.
Darren & Stephanie are attentive and non-intrusive. When needed they responded in minutes, even while they were working! Our stay was not a pleasure stay however it was made comfortable by the ability to stay in this lovely apartment and having a fully functional kitchen.

Children's hospital is about 10 minutes away, there is a Safeway (other grocery stores as well) and other drug stores nearby. Stephanie and Darren put together a packet with small reviews of local restaurants, bars, and coffee shops that I would have taken advantage of in other circumstances. "
2994309,57752133,2015-12-29,42331871,Courtney,"Darren and Stephanie totally made us feel welcomed! They had a complete list of places to eat, and things to see while we stayed in Seattle. And they made the house feel more like a hotel than house sitting. Since this was our first air bnb experience we went in not knowing what to expect and they totally blew us away! The house was extremely clean and looked exactly like the pictures. It was in the perfect area of town too. So much good food and right down the street! There were 5 of us, and it didn't feel crowded at all! It felt private too, just how a vacation should feel. We would definitely stay here again! In fact we look forward to it! "
4479426,33860924,2015-06-01,33999340,Mary Ella,"David was a friendly, thoughtful, helpful host.  His room was as described and was certainly clean and comfortable. The home is located convenient to shops and restaurants in West Seattle.  It was a good value for the rate charged."
4479426,35747032,2015-06-21,21844802,Jeff,"Great place in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking.  Bus stop to downtown is just across the street, but I drove to downtown (convention center) in about 20 minutes during morning traffic and 10 minutes on the weekend.

David was very friendly and welcoming, while being respectful of my privacy."
4479426,38194519,2015-07-13,86192,Veronica,"David was an excellent host. He was informative about the area and told us to go to California St. for some good food and fun. He was a respectful and always a text away. The room was perfect, the art on the walls made it a special experience. He also went out of his way to give us another key and put up some more hooks in the bathroom for our stuff. I would reccomend his place to anyone."
4479426,38352811,2015-07-14,86192,Veronica,"Great experience, extended another day, see previous review."
4479426,39327332,2015-07-22,27335695,Philip,"Location, location, location! It took us 15 minutes (if that) to get to Downtown Seattle, and 5 minutes around the block to not only a strip of shops and restaurants but also Alki Beach in West Seattle! 

Dave's place is very clean and comfortable. The bed cradles you while providing appropriate firmness. The deck was great to hang out on, and is always mood-lit. He had towels, cups, and toiletries at the ready for us in our private room. In addition, he had morning bites ready for munching in the kitchen. When we got there, after giving us the grand tour, making sure the AC was keeping us comfortable (it was a hot weekend), he asked if there was anything he could get for us from the grocery store--very generous! 

Dave is super friendly, but also respects your space. Think: the best roommate! He'll share a glass of wine with you and he'll tell some great stories, but he'll also leave you be and let you take over the couch without any fuss.  

I felt right at home!"
4479426,39998539,2015-07-27,26732901,Zoe,"Dave was a wonderful host and made us feel right at home. It felt like we were visiting old friends so thank you so much! We had a really great time in seattle, the place was easy to find, clean comfortable and had great links into downtown. I would recommend staying with Dave if your visiting the area and I know we would love to come and stay there again! "
4479426,40189496,2015-07-28,39465768,Ryan,"David was very welcoming and the room and space were great! My friend and I needed to find something very last minute due to another cancellation and David was more than flexible and accepting with having the room available. Everything was clean and it was a very cool space also. I had kind of a crazy schedule during my night there because of a wedding and reception but he was more than fine with it, and upon meeting and hanging out with him for a sec the next day seemed like a really caring and considerate and fun host. I would recommend to all my friends and anyone looking for a great room to stay with him while they are in Seattle. "
4479426,41016713,2015-08-03,39627093,Akshay,"We had a really good time staying at Dave's house. He made it so comfortable for us that it felt like home away from home. The house is filled with so many artsy things. The paintings in the pictures David posted caught my attention and prompted me to choose the place. The house has a beautiful lanai aptly decorated for a nice evening date. The eccentric ideas David has just adds to the whole romantic ambience. If one was to pay heed to his/her surroundings he/she would notice the attention to detail that goes into setting up the place. A very liberal person. Doesn't mind his guests smoking in the lanai. There was an ash tray placed in the close vicinity. The silence of the environment around is perfect for a ""finding oneself"" vacation. David had his fridge full of goodies (usual breakfast stuff) which was complimentary. There were notes around the house giving precise instructions to every single detail. We dint get a chance to meet him which I believe is our loss because I would love to know such an eccentric person. The place has this holistic ambience to it. I am from India and this is the first time I dint feel like a stranger or that I dint belong. Not sure if it was the art or the warmth of the place. I would absolutely recommend this place. Everyone could use a little colour in their busy grey lives. The title is apt. Real cozy, real comfy place. Thanks David. We would love to come back someday. Peace!"
4479426,41996997,2015-08-10,35605129,Shihao,Dave was so friendly he is a very nice guy. Everything was awesome in his house. I think it have very good cost performance .location  was good it take about 15min ride use uber. I'd like to live there again if I go Seattle next time 
4479426,42362077,2015-08-12,7590832,Bonnie,"David's place, and the whole experience were great! He responded quickly to my request to book, and was very flexible and understanding of our schedule as far as check in time was concerned. The place is really charming (we loved the artwork and patio!) and David is a gracious host who goes above and beyond to make his guests feel comfortable. The location is a quick bus ride or Uber to just about any place you want to be in Seattle, and we really enjoyed poking around the the neighborhood as well. Thank you, David! "
4479426,42452714,2015-08-13,33153709,Hugo,"David's place was located on a hill, not to far from all the action. 
The neighborhood was quite and safe and tons of room for street parking. His place was cozy, clean and full of great art. Everything we needed was available, from clean towels to toiletries. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable! It felt like a bed and breakfast!  Theres a great shaded patio if you are a smoker.

After getting back from Seattle sight seeing we were able to chat with him and exchange stories, he was very friendly and knew a lot about the city.  I would definitely stay him with again!"
4479426,42790405,2015-08-15,33048396,Songquan,"I enjoy the stay. The room is neat and cozy. The highlight is the wall decoration by David with his paintings of Seattle, beautiful, unique and special. If I come to Seattle again, I will definitely consider staying in David's house."
4479426,43146660,2015-08-17,16438028,Mario,"Great experience overall, David was a great host. He welcomed me on arrival, showed me around and gave me local recommendations and directions. The place was super clean, comfortable and quiet, $12-$15 Uber ride from downtown or a 30 minute bus ride (bus stop right across the street). "
4479426,45205547,2015-08-31,11412272,Eric,"
Thanks, David, for opening your house for me to stay over night. I appreciate your kindness

I wish  you well in the future."
4479426,46014759,2015-09-07,41583257,Lizzie,"My first experience with Airbnb and I am not sure anything will compare to the amazing time I had. David is a kind and compassionate host. The room itself is cozy and welcoming, his place is serene and located in West Seattle perfectly placed. A bus ride into the city proper,  another bus to Alki Beach, water taxi to the other side of the bay. All these things I would not have experienced if not for David's local knowledge. You often get out of what you give, our new friendship is exactly what I think Airbnb can be at its best. Host and guest in perfect synchronicity as to how much interaction one needed. We must be the poster child for a great experience.  Seattle is beautiful and my host's tips and willingness to show me around as I was on my own very sweet. In short, Airbnb have me the holiday I could not have imagined because of my host. Thanks to both of you!"
202251,16277472,2014-07-24,13024520,Hilda,Tim is a fast-respond owner and very nice to offer help before chech-in.  I feel sorry that we could not live in the house finally due to our arrangement.  I do appreciate Tim's understanding.
202251,16520394,2014-07-28,6341214,Lyn,"The overall experience was really positive.  This was the first time that I've used airbnb but not the last.
Tim, our host and primary contact, was really responsive. For example, we had a bit of trouble reading the Internet password and Tim replied immediately to our query. 
The location was great because it was not downtown seattle... It was a neighbourhood and had a really friendly vibe. And - the restaurants that were just down the street were all good options. There was a bit of a walk to public transport but, luckily, I like to walk and the stops were easy to find.
The house suited our needs perfectly. I was traveling with a friend so it was nice to have living spaces to hang out in as well as separate spaces to have some time alone. And the backyard was great. Oh - and - there were lots of extra blankets in case we got cold and it actually was quite cold the first night so they were much appreciated.
Thank you.
Yours, 
Lyn Backwell "
202251,17522522,2014-08-13,17432334,Sean,"Great location with good access to just about everything Seattle has to offer.

Pam and Tim were great; super-responsive and helpful.

I left some random stuff there by mistake and they were very helpful in getting it back to me the day we left.

I'd stay here again for sure."
202251,17877548,2014-08-18,18464617,Cory,"Pam and Tim did an excellent job at welcoming us to the house. Prior to the stay they sent multiple messages prepping me for my arrival and asking if I had any questions about getting in or the neighborhood.

It's a very cute house in a great spot in Seattle. A short walk to convenience stores, and restaurants. 

Thank you Pam and Tim!!!"
202251,18211241,2014-08-23,1223851,Angela,The house worked out well for my Dad and I. We were right near Green Lake Park which is beautiful. There was an extra sleeping space that worked well for my Dad's 2 stepchildren one of the nights. The house is incredibly charming with vintage accents throughout. Having the TV was nice for a longer stay when you're tired and just want to relax. There is plenty of parking with a driveway and also street parking. Ballard is nearby with tons of great restaurants. I would definitely recommend this listing for two people or two couples. 
202251,18888936,2014-09-02,3230946,Melissa,"Everything about our stay was great. Pam and Tim were very responsive via email and text messages before, during and after our trip. We needed to add some extra days and they worked hard to make it happen for us. 

We love the location of the house (we walked to dinner almost every night) and it was a quick drive into downtown. 

The house is great for families. Plenty of room for everyone inside and a backyard to play in too. 

Will stay there again! "
202251,26422665,2015-02-12,25895250,Amy,The area was central and the description certainly matched reality.  The host was very prompt in communication and helpful.  We appreciated the coffee and tea supplies left there for our use and found everything well stocked in the kitchen for what we needed.  It was a very comfortable space for 3 adults and two children.
202251,30430806,2015-04-21,30293215,George,This place is really spacious and cozy. Walking distance to a lot of fun restaurants and bars. Tim made us feel really welcome and was extremely responsive. We would stay here again! 
202251,30734221,2015-04-26,14417100,Charles,TIm and Pam were very accommodating. Their home is an ideal location for playing and working in the Seattle area. Close to some very neat neighborhoods and downtowns. I'd highly recommend their space!
202251,35036673,2015-06-14,33002072,Sharon,"Nice quiet house in a nice quiet neighborhood. The house is an old one but well maintained and very clean. The kitchen is lovely with all the facilities - fully functional and convenient. During the day the rooms are bright with sunlight shed through windows. The hosts are very promote in responding to inquiries. Overall, a great experience staying here.  "
202251,51285335,2015-10-19,23555934,Kanishka,"Cozy home in a good location.  Very responsive owner, very helpful and communicative when small issues popped up.  Good location, easy drive into downtown Seattle, Ballard, Fremont.  Stocked with toys, great for kids.  Thanks, Tim and Pam, for hosting us!"
7776701,45456538,2015-09-02,11020100,Kim,The host canceled this reservation 16 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7776701,47179828,2015-09-16,35807860,Susan,"If there was a way to feel more welcomed, I don't know what it could have been. We were greeted by a warm note and a bottle of wine. We were the first guests ever, and the place was just perfect! Exactly as pictured and described and so much more!! It was like staying in a spa, with pampering products in the bath, big fluffy towels and bath sheet size towels as well.  And the beds and bedding were like sleeping on a cloud!

And then there is the view! 180 degree view of Elliot Bay, and beautiful patio furniture to lounge on while taking in the sight. We enjoyed the fire pit several nights, and even cooked on the grill one night. We met several of the neighbors, and everyone was so friendly!

If you can bring yourself to venture out, there are many fun restaurants within an easy walk down the beach. The Alki Beach area is a great place to be.  We were definitely sad when it was time to leave! I will definitely be back some day if I can :)"
6864319,44240923,2015-08-24,1586012,Ian,"Kevin was an excellent host, both flexible and full of neighborhood recommendations."
7348578,38800517,2015-07-18,36372072,Yao,Dario's place is very clean. And very new. I checked his other places before I book. He got awesome reviews. And this place is very new. And good location. It's in the university district. Not far from downtown neither. 
7348578,38961210,2015-07-19,10045275,Susan,"neighborhood convenient for bus to downtown, restaurants etc. room and house clean and comfortable, hosts friendly and helpful. my major concern with airbnb in general, and this location (university district, reasonably safe but highly transient) is security for my belongings. i'm traveling on business, with laptop etc, and have had luggage stolen in the past. major headache. there are at least three bdrms being rented separately in this house, with no locks on doors. I raised this issue with Darios partners (never met Dario) and they thanked me for the feedback, said they would have locks installed within a week. very responsive, this is a new place and they are still working on it. all in all, a very pleasant experience for my one night stay."
7348578,39116430,2015-07-20,38302417,Katrina,"When we arrived Ethan, Dario's roommate, was very helpful by answering a few questions we had about the ferry to the Olympic Peninsula. He showed us our room, which was nice and clean and just like the picture showed.  He also showed us the cabinets where we could find some food for breakfast in the morning.  
It wasn't the warmest atmosphere and we did feel a little bit like we were in a fishbowl when Dario and Ethan were in the living room, adjacent to our room, laying out all the bedding and supplies that had just been purchased from Ikea to furnish other rooms.  They talked until pretty late in the living room, and we would have appreciated a little more quiet.  
It is a good place if you're a student and looking for something similar to a hostel environment since it is right by the university area.  Dario was nice when we met him and I understand he is running a business, but I think making a more welcoming environment would be helpful.  "
7348578,39459346,2015-07-23,38883318,Josh,Had a great stay. Very clean place and very hospitable. Close to University street which has some great food. Check out Morsel for a great brunch!
7348578,39715733,2015-07-25,39257166,K,"Very easy stay, spotless home.  Extremely quiet at night.  And a perfect location for getting to UW in the morning without traffic. We arrived late and left early, so did not have a chance to meet the host. Thank you."
7348578,40013985,2015-07-27,26961207,Katie,We had a great stay in the brown house! Ethan was a great host and our room was clean and newly furnished. We didn't have any trouble finding street parking. The house is in a great part of the university village. We'd love to stay again next time were in the area!
7348578,40503110,2015-07-31,37194668,Matthew,"Staying at Dario's place was a good experience. Dario went out of his way to meet us a few days before our stay to show us the house. Ethan, his property manager, was very friendly, extremely helpful and accommodating. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable. The house is located in the University District with a lot of unique shops and restaurants near by, as well as, being a short distance to downtown by car or bus. We would definitely stay here again!"
7348578,40697077,2015-08-01,32902268,Kai,"This is a quiet house in a nice neighborhood.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable and there were plenty of towels and soaps for the shower.
"
7348578,40981319,2015-08-03,36169830,Dai,Very friendly host; quite neighborhood; breakfast provided as said.
7348578,41684674,2015-08-08,39857131,Chun Zi,"Nice nice nice! No more words,just go ahead! I felt comfortable with Ethan and the room, I still love to make a reservation with him next time~"
7348578,42069537,2015-08-10,17857524,Nils Philip,It was a very nice stay on a good location. The busses Downtown runs just five minuts walk from the house. The house was Clean and with a good kitchen and it was breakfast there to eat. Very good host!!
7348578,42302408,2015-08-12,38360039,Sebastian,"The room was really comfortable and clean. The whole was was really clean and pretty. The house is located close to a bus line that can take you to downtown pretty fast. At night the house was quiet. Overall I fell like Dario runs his Airbnb very professionally and takes care of everything. I did not have a chance to meeting since I was really busy, but I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay. "
7348578,42499733,2015-08-13,22443044,Yayun,The room was spacious and quiet! Only a few blocks from UW. Ethan also set up roll away bed for me. Pillows are super soft and comfy. There were plenty breakfast items. Definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to visit Seattle. 
7348578,43141272,2015-08-17,13034079,Ruben,"I spent four nights in Dario's place. The room I stayed in was large and comfortable. It was also possible to use the living room and the kitchen. Dario and his property manager Ethan are running this house very professionally. They communicate clearly and quickly, make sure the house is clean, and provide breakfast (!). Also, Ethan was always very helpful when I asked him something. 

Two things I did not like that much have to do with the location and the keys/locks. Although several bus lines stop near the house, it took me half an hour to 45 minutes to get to downtown (mainly because of Seattle's busy traffic). I would advise the hosts to make it possible to lock the sleeping rooms. Because there are multiple rooms on Airbnb in this house, and you don't know who else is staying there, it would feel more comfortable if it were possible to lock the door behind me. Especially since the code on the main door didn't change during the time of my stage, which means that guests who had stayed with Dario earlier might still be able to enter the house."
7348578,43465499,2015-08-19,41684371,Nii,Felt very welcome and was able to come and go freely. Check in was simple and convenient. 
7348578,43595989,2015-08-20,31546741,Johannes,It was a really nice and comfortable accommodation. We enjoyed staying here much. We never got to see Dario but he organized everything nicely.
7348578,44593370,2015-08-27,41766474,Janine,"This was the first Airbnb home I stayed in, and it was a good experience. The room looks just as it is in the picture. The house was very clean and organized and we were free to use anything in the kitchen to cook our own food. I especially like how everything in the kitchen was labelled, making it super easy to find things. 

During our stay, we had the chance to meet Ethan. He was very friendly and willing to answer any questions we had. Look forward to returning in a few days!"
7348578,44872386,2015-08-29,42522935,Andrew,"Fabulous stay - Room and house were exactly as described by Dario.  Pleasant, quiet location with easy access.  Response within minutes of booking.  Highly recommend."
7348578,45606086,2015-09-04,9009347,Benjamin,The room and home were as pictured/described. Access was easy and everything seemed to work efficiently. One thing to note is that the house seems to have quite a few airbnb guests coming and going from the various rooms and really feels more like a b&b than other places where you are staying the spare room of a place that feels like someone's home.
7348578,46208994,2015-09-08,1333200,Audrey,"Did not see so much our host, nevertheless anytime needed he reacted instantly. I texted our host several times and I never felt that I was bothering him.
Since this is a business based on ""sleep"" we would have appreciate some improvements: locks at the bedroom door, bedroom very humid (having the fan on all night long can be disturbing), no heater in the bathroom (can be challenging to get in the shower).
Overall, the place is in a  great location, calm and quiet.
"
7348578,46554380,2015-09-11,10136179,Herb,"Ethan, who is the caretaker of the home was an amazing and an accommodating host. The house was spotless, the bathrooms stayed clean, the common space was always enjoyable to relax in, and the kitchen was fully stocked with multiple breakfast items. I actually wish my stay was longer, the guests at the time were incredibly friendly and fun to talk to."
7348578,46833744,2015-09-13,35678332,Varun,"It was great. The room was clean and I had a nice, comfortable bed. The house was nice, friendly guests, and a helpful host. The house was situated in a really nice neighborhood too."
7348578,47426460,2015-09-18,43916408,Ambrose,"My stay at Ethan's house was very pleasant. The house has two really clean and well-decorated bathrooms. The room I had was cozy and decorated. The owner Ethan also provided enough material for breakfast. Anyway, I had a blast at this house."
7348578,50046411,2015-10-08,43645303,Min,"Excellent host and was available to answer questions I had regarding daily commute. Excellent room quality: clean, excellent wi-fi, accessible kitchen and bathroom. "
7348578,50396304,2015-10-11,3054075,Micha,"Great breakfast, plenty of fresh fruit and yoghurt, eggs and bacon. Clean place. The bed is really good. We would come back."
7348578,50608086,2015-10-12,20581320,Kasturi,Ethan was kind enough to accommodate me as it was a last minute request. The place was exactly as described and great for what I needed during my short stay.
7348578,50815106,2015-10-14,3570934,Charlotte,"Dario and the site manager are good hosts. They are clear about expectations/rules etc. for guests, and the place is very welcoming and makes you feel at home. I especially liked having use of the stove etc. to make meals. Guests should recognize that this isn't the kind of airbnb where you're the only guest...there are other rooms, so this feels a bit more like a bnb or hostel than a typical ""we rent our spare bedroom"" type airbnb. but all in all i had a great stay. I walked to the university each day (it was about a 15 minute walk) and felt safe the whole time. Short (2 block) walk to a grocery store, too. "
7348578,51796164,2015-10-24,30884176,Ming,It is a good place.
7348578,54549652,2015-11-21,545397,Alexis,"We were warmly welcomed by Dario's roommate Ethan. We didn't chat too much but it was apparent he was eager to help with any concerns we might have. And he was very sweet to our dog.

Staying in the house felt like staying in a mens' college dorm. The room and bathroom  were tidy enough, but the kitchen was dirty. Dirty dishes in the sink, crumbs all over the counter, improperly washed dishes and utensils for our use... And it was difficult to cook in the morning because we couldn't find a pan to cook eggs, and the toaster was broken. (I ended up cooking the eggs in a large pot and having to scour it after). 

We found it mildly amusing that there were notes with lists of rules throughout the place being obviously ignored: no cooking in the kitchen after 10pm (we could definitely hear someone cooking past that time) and even to leave the toilet seat down in the bathroom (repeatedly left up!). This was more odd than anything, and may have been because of the other guests/roommates in the house - there seemed to be quite a few of them. 

Sorry to say, we were not impressed and would not return."
7348578,54760030,2015-11-23,37062340,Sparrow,Lovely stay. Super clean. Many thanks!
5862552,32619208,2015-05-19,32796088,Thomas,Thank you Krystal for the place. we had this place reserved for a farewell event to one of our dear one who was relocating and this place was a perfect for cherishing and laughing out those memories. We all had a great time...
5862552,33835918,2015-06-01,3321996,Wonder,"Krystal was very helpful and only a text or email away. She is the cutest! The house is beautiful, it sits high enough for a striking view of the water. The huge windows let the light flood in. The backyard is perfect for hanging out on the deck or enjoying the flowers. Calm, residential neighborhood in a beautiful area. We loved it."
5862552,34429024,2015-06-08,11152332,Pete,"Great neighborhood w/ views that can't be topped. We only stayed one night but wish we could have stayed longer. Easy access to Alki Beach & restaurants, a great private yard w/ grill and ample space made for a wonderful stay. "
5862552,34908209,2015-06-13,271454,Katie,Krystal was very easy to communicate with.  The house is in a lovely location and is very nice.
5862552,35216611,2015-06-16,31530266,Ruth,"We could not have asked for a better setting to celebrate our son's graduation from UW. Quiet neighborhood with easy access to Alki Beach. The house is spacious and comfortable, easily accommodated our large family, especially with the Grotto.  Spectacular view with great sunsets were enjoyed as well as the backyard with grill.
Thank you to Krystal for making the process  smooth with great communication via email and phone.  "
5862552,36542538,2015-06-29,32696785,Melaine,Working with Krystal was so easy! She responded so quickly to all my questions and was very helpful during the process. This rental is very nice! The view of the water at sunset offered a great backdrop for pictures and the beds were comfortable. You can tell that the place has been well cared for. 
5862552,38260405,2015-07-14,29293905,Martin,"Krystal is absolutely tops in customer service!  I was setting up this house for several family members who were coming to Seattle, so I had more than a few questions coming from a few people to pass on to Krystal, and she responded so quickly and so thoroughly every time!  My family had a very good time at the ""Sunset Villa"" and ""Sunset Grotto"", and the space met all of their needs. It was clean, organized, and comfortable, with both good common space and private space.  And what a great neighborhood! Beautiful walks through curvy streets leading to Alki Beach; great living room views of the water and the mountains.  The outdoor table and chairs also meant some nice casual dining in the delightful Seattle summer weather.  I would eagerly work with Krystal again and would recommend her to everyone.  "
5862552,39015572,2015-07-20,15899024,Patrick,"Great neighborhood and a great place to stay! A few friends and I stayed at Krystal's home for a wedding, and we loved it. The view of the sound was a great perk - I'll be back!"
5862552,39912415,2015-07-27,6991416,Cindy,What a fantastic location!  Krystal was very responsive both before and during our visit.  She made us feel very welcome.  The house and grounds were in great condition and that view!  We had a large group and everyone enjoyed themselves and had plenty of room.  Would definitely recommend.
5862552,40631257,2015-08-01,3177736,Zheng,"My family and friends stayed here for 3 nights. We loved the location and view. It's just a few minutes walk to Alki beach. And we did bbq, which is an amazing experience."
5862552,42670062,2015-08-15,30402013,Ivana,"It is a great and spacious house with a beautiful view. The neighbourhood is very nice and quiet. Kitchen is great!

Krystal was very helpful with all of our questions. 

Best recommendations for this house!"
5862552,43105878,2015-08-17,36104542,Garet,"Loved this place and everything about the transaction.  Krystal was great to work with, checked in on us to make sure we were ok, and the place was furnished and very nice with an amazing view.  We got to watch a beautiful rainstorm over the ocean from the living room.  Its also in a very nice neighborhood area.  One thing to note, there is another apt(?) for rent under you so you may have someone else there, but it is very separate and we only saw them, never heard them or had any problems.   over all it was a great experience."
5862552,45141826,2015-08-31,5040062,Michael,"A group of 10 of us stayed at the Sunset Villa and Sunset Grotto. It was perfect for us! Krystal was a fantastic host, super responsive and helpful!

The location is great, it's a different feel from downtown Seattle which was kind of nice to see different sides of the area. The view is spectacular and you're just a mile from beach. It's about a 15-20 min Uber ride to downtown and once we were downtown we walked everywhere.  

The house was clean and the king bed in the master was really comfortable.  "
5862552,47012514,2015-09-14,43882783,Drew,"Altogether great experience. The home was just what we were looking for and had everything we needed. It felt comfortable and inviting, and provided easy access to the beach, proximity to stires and restaurants and an amazing view. 

Krystal was a great host and respoused quickly to any questions we had. If you're looking for a place in the Alki area, this is a must. If you're looking for somewhere anywhere on Seattle, this is definitely high on my list."
5862552,49353890,2015-10-03,6448382,Tracy,我们一行6人住了7个晚上，房子景观很棒！客厅里是180度海湾景观，可以静坐阳台欣赏日落。交通也非常方便，门口有公交到Downtown。开车到Seattle Downtown仅需20分钟。
5862552,49661130,2015-10-05,43721835,Corbin,We really enjoyed our stay at Sunset Villa. It was a beautiful home with an amazing view of the water. 
5862552,52157421,2015-10-26,23231318,Andres,"The  Sunset Villa had a great location in West Seattle with a lot of attractions near by and just a quick car ride away from downtown. The house was comfortable, clean, and had all the essentials you need. We had a slight issue with the bathroom upon our arrival but that was quickly resolved by Krystal and we all really appreciated that. Krystal is always ready and available to help out and make your stay as enjoyable as possible. I would really recommend staying at this listing! "
5862552,55844923,2015-12-06,27596564,Beth,"What a view! This is a lovely little place, and we were cozy for our one night stay. The water is a nice walk down the hill, although the hike back up is a little challenging! Everything was easy to use and in good repair. Extra comfy beds, too!"
5862552,57520546,2015-12-27,46574674,Maureen,"The house has an incredible view of the Sound. It was a lovely neighborhood and located very well for our family's needs. The ease of entry with the lockbox worked well. The house was warm and the temperature consistent despite some rather cold rainy weather, the house stayed nice and warm. There were, however, not a lot of amenities for our party of 7 adults, with insufficient seating in the living room and dining area. The pull out couch was very uncomfortable and the remarkably limited cable service was disappointing for a winter stay that included a lot of inside time. Throwing the trash away was also a bit of a challenge, since the trash bins were located in the alley way behind the property, and we could find no way to access from the house without walking around the corner to empty our trash "
2486612,10790788,2014-03-07,44934,Darren,"Thanks so much to Genjo, Dana and Michael for welcoming us at a moment's notice. We were rolling into Seattle after a long road trip not sure of where we were staying that night and within minutes of requesting, they replied and readied the place for us. We were honored to be their first airbnb guests in their beautiful and quiet apartment atop a zen meditation center. It's located in a nice suburb within walking distance of some great restaurants (try the Mexican place around the corner) and very easy and close to all major metro areas. My only regret is not taking them up on their offer to join the meditation class but we were all to tired after the trip. I definitely will if I find myself In Seattle again. They were also very flexible with our schedule and let us book a second night on the spot. I can't recommend their accommodations and hospitality highly enough. Thanks!!"
2486612,11388109,2014-03-31,887583,Charlie,"Dana who is the building manager met us promptly when we entered and we did not even give notice to when we would arrive (we didint know) The apartment was quite large and lots of room for two people. It was colorful and lots of windows on the second floor. Furniture and decorations were cute and didn't take up too much room. We were left peacefully although we were mostly out in the city. Dana also recommended some food and parks around the area to see. 

There is a meditation center downstairs and we were offered to join in but had no time. The back yard is gorgeous with plenty of parking on the gravel spaces. We will definitely come back on our next trip down. "
2486612,11808323,2014-04-15,1991489,Andrea,"I was in Seattle on business and wanted a quiet, restful place to stay and sometimes work. The ""Zen"" apartment was just what I needed. The apartment was larger than I had expected, airy, peaceful, and bright. The neighborhood was quiet and full of spring.  We enjoyed the garden behind the house, Genjo was an excellent host, responsive to emails, and accommodating when we missed a ferry. And Dana was great in showing us around. We'll be back!"
2486612,11902534,2014-04-18,3886462,Caroleen & Tjard,"We only stayed over night, but the place was clean, comfy and well kept. We we greeted and treated really well and had a great stay. Thanks!"
2486612,12011041,2014-04-21,13545086,Katarzyna,"Had a perfect stay -- very easy to check in and out, the apartment was *great*! We had everything we could want -- kitchen, table, bath, towels -- and we slept soundly. The apartment was as well taken care of as the pictures look.

We are looking forward to staying here on all our return visits to Seattle."
2486612,12242076,2014-04-27,4170005,Fred,"This was the best place to stay. It was so clean and quiet that it was easy to concentrate, meditate and get centered. The garden was lovely, and the kitchen was perfect for me. I hope that I can stay here again in the future (but actually join the larger group for meditation!).

Thank you again. Lovely people and a lovely place."
2486612,12505062,2014-05-04,1336479,Kristoffer Vik,"Genjos apartment was a good place for a night. The Zen garden is very nice, and the neighborhood seemed quiet with lots of cool restaurants nearby.

Even though the listing says it sleeps 5 people, please bear in mind that the apartment is optimally set up for two people.

The location is outside Downtown Seattle, so be prepared to take transit or drive."
2486612,13146329,2014-05-20,6714567,Patricia,"The Zen apartment is an oasis of peace, with a lovely garden, in a quiet neighborhood.   I felt completely safe walking around in the evening.  A public bus was a block away, making it easy to get around the city without taking our car.  Having an off-street parking space to leave the car was a plus.  Two of us stayed in the apartment and I slept on the pull out single bed----it was amazingly comfortable!  The two hosts, Dana and Genjo, and both were very helpful and made check in and check out easy, and they provided information about the neighborhood, making it easy to find what we needed.  I would definitely stay here again, primarily because of the quiet atmosphere.  The building does house the meditation center, so I would hope guests would both be attracted to it because of that and respect the peace and quiet of the building.  "
2486612,13675135,2014-06-02,474767,R.,"This place is awesome!  Host and place are perfect. Bring your own food. Nearby aGreat Indian, coffee, and market within walking. Very easy to either take public transportation or drive your own car to see all the sights in the vibrant city of Seattle. Enjoy"
2486612,15859843,2014-07-17,2089499,Jean Et Chantal,"Our stay at the ""zen"" appartment was   enjoyable. The appartment is conveniently situated in a quiet neighbourhood and it is easy to access downtown Seattle. Dana was a perfect host and she was available to help us.

Merci beaucoup.

Chantal et Jean"
2486612,16458196,2014-07-28,12723160,Kelsey,"A friend and I traveled to Seattle as part of our West Coast vacation and stayed in Beacon Hill on a recommendation from another friend. This apartment was comfortable and quiet -- perfect for a three-night stay at the tail end of a long trip. Our host welcomed us warmly when we arrived, and we immediately felt at home in the bright, spacious living room. Everything was clean and neat, and we loved the little extras, like the high-quality handsoaps and the handy packet of information about the neighborhood. We left on Sunday morning feeling rested and grateful. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"
2486612,16687663,2014-07-31,4514077,Laura,"Lovely simple apartment, quiet with all the necessities."
2486612,16747626,2014-08-01,18234788,Anchor,"Genjo and Dana were wonderful hosts. Good communication prior to the trip, met us when we got there to let us in. The apartment had everything we needed, great location, short and sweet stay. Thank you for having us. "
2486612,16973170,2014-08-05,10095509,Wilf,"My wife, 13 year old son and I are from England and we recently spent 4 nights at the apartment.  Firstly do not be put off by the title - this is a great place to stay.  The location is good - a quiet residential neighbourhood with restaurants and a very good grocery store close by  (lots of information made available by the host) and the bus stop to get down town (15 mins on the bus) is only a couple of blocks away.  The apartment is comfortable, spacious and very good value for money - large living room, with good sized kitchen, bathroom  and bedroom.  We didn't meet Genjo as he was away but Dana and Carolyn who also live in the block couldn't have been more helpful - thanks ladies for being of assistance.  "
2486612,17122621,2014-08-07,18660461,Ryan,"Staying at the Zen apartment was an excellent experience. The place was clean, nicely furnished, the bed was comfy, and the building was very peaceful. We were also happy to have good food and coffee within walking distance. Sally, who greeted us, was very kind and made us feel right at home. I would absolutely stay there again."
2486612,17141645,2014-08-08,10473218,Jenny,We had a great stay at the Zen Apartment. Lots of light with the large picture windows. We came in at the end of the day and left early the next day. The apartment was a  great size. It was quite warm but the space had great ventilation. The grounds are beautiful!
2486612,17240717,2014-08-09,13325456,Cori,"Very friendly and communicative.  We were booked to stay at the Zen apartment, but due to my mother falling ill, was not able to make the trip to Seattle.  What I can say is that Genjo was understanding, and communicated well, and the next time I am in Seattle I will be looking to rest here first."
2486612,17431723,2014-08-12,5106872,Jenny,"The apartment was exactly as listed. Dana was a great host, and was accommodating with our late night arrival. The area around the apartment was nice and quiet at night, and the apartment was very clean. It was about a 10 minute walk to the light rail, which was very convenient to downtown and the airport. I would definitely look at staying here again next time I am in Seattle!"
2486612,17573134,2014-08-14,11528828,Maggie,"We had a great stay at the ""zen"" apartment. The apartment was comfortable and spacious. We did not meet Genjo during our stay. However, Dana, 
who lives in the same building was extremely kind and helpful. She made check in/out easy and was available when needed. She also provided some helpful hot spots to check out. The location was not too far from downtown. We had a car and there was always parking available on the block. Overall, we had a wonderful stay and hope to visit Seattle again soon! "
2486612,17693982,2014-08-16,13641969,Jessica,"The zen apartment was very spacious and clean, and the neighborhood had some cool restaurants to check out. Unfortunately, we were only able to stay one night, but the time we spent there was enjoyable. No complaints!"
2486612,17787326,2014-08-17,2255576,Irma,"We had a lovely stay at Zen Apartments. Genjo contacted us before our visit to give us directions and it was easy to find. We felt safe leaving our car parked out the front. Jaye met us with a warm and friendly welcome and helped us settle in with lots of recommendations of the area. The apartment was clean and peaceful. Plenty of room for 3 people - 2 in the bed and 1 on the couch. We appreciated the clean towels and bathroom products that had been left. Some coffee would have been nice for the coffee maker but there was a great cafe around the corner that did really good espresso! Wish we had tried some of the bars and restaurants, nice area! Great stay for one night. Thank you! Some guidebooks on Seattle and some more brochures/flyers would have been nice! :)"
2486612,17820628,2014-08-18,14698650,Amber,"We were met by Dana, who was extremely accommodating by letting us check in a little early. Dana was very kind and helpful. She had even left a little plate of brownies for us. There was a printed version of the guidebook, so we could find places in the neighborhood.

The apartment was everything promised: quiet and clean, quite comfortable, and exactly the type of place where I would take my mother when she comes for a visit. The gardens were amazingly beautiful, much more so than the pictures here represent. I highly recommend spending some time out in them. The kitchen was adequate for our short stay. The stove was great, and we had the wonderful surprise of a brand new waffle maker.  It even had a blender if one wanted to make smoothies. When my mom comes, I'll also have to set something to cooking in the crock pot while we explore the city. Fridge was great, clean and plenty large enough, and had a large amount of ice ready for our use. Thanks, Dana!

There were three of us staying, and we had considered staying in the ""nice"" hostel, but we wanted more privacy and quiet. We totally got what we wanted and felt this apartment was a great value. We were minutes away from where we wanted to be, but we felt isolated from the noise of the city. The neighborhood was really nice and friendly. We definitely want to stay here again so we can spend time exploring the neighborhood."
2486612,17948535,2014-08-19,17676683,Stephanie,"Clean, bright space. 4 adults stayed very comfortably at this apartment. The host was very kind and welcoming, and even provided a list of nearby amenities. Close to the highway, which is very convenient but can be a bit noisy if you are a light sleeper. All in all a good experience. Thank you!"
2486612,18067328,2014-08-21,1862154,Remo,"Could not have picked a better place to stay. 
Genjo and Dana were very responsive and helpful with advice on what to do around the area. 
I recommend taking part of the various zen activities that take place throughout the week--a true gift. "
2486612,18502111,2014-08-27,2366361,Jake,The place was clean and definitely Zen. Not far from downtown at all. Jaye was super helpful and full of positive energy! I would definitely recommend.
2486612,18944603,2014-09-03,17935854,Katrina,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay!! The apartment is so centrally located, only a 20 minute bus ride to pike place market and downtown. Jaye was so friendly and helpful, the next time we are in Seattle, we will definitely be staying here!!! Thank you so much!!"
2486612,19146577,2014-09-07,10238685,Alex,"Awesome, loved it. 

Very peaceful, great neighbourhood. Exactly what we needed. We'll be back!!!

"
2486612,19676159,2014-09-16,2934716,Margaret,"The host rep Jaye, was available and made us feel welcome. The apt is as pictured;  wifi available, no tv (which I loved)!  Great neighborhood, especially since our oldest son and family lived about 6 blocks away.  Light rail, grocery store, restaurants and great park for kids but a few blocks away.  We would stay here again"
2486612,21085762,2014-10-11,21050295,Wlodek,"The apartment was spacious, as described, with easy access to buses and the rail. 

We could check in once we arrived in Seattle, before the ""official check in time"". We were warmly welcomed at the door. 

We enjoyed our visit to Seattle."
2486612,21127250,2014-10-12,19466890,Stacey,"Genjo was so accommodating to us to check in early and  set up the apartment very nicely. While we only stayed for one night, the space was great for the five of us and the neighborhood is beautiful. "
2486612,21656165,2014-10-21,20019571,Jesson,"What a fantastic, cozy, and peaceful respite from the busyness of our trip! My mom and I stayed here with my 16-month old don and couldn't have been more pleased with our choice. The rooms were comfortable and spacious, the hosts very welcoming yet not intrusive, and we discovered one of the best coffee shops we have ever been to right around the corner from us. All in all a fantastic place to stay. We will definitely be back!!"
2486612,22061603,2014-10-29,17282010,Grace,"Our host's assistant was very welcoming but looking back we would have found a caution about the uneven front steps and info about the coin laundry more helpful than the introduction to the toaster and coffee maker. This apartment would be better advertised as a comfortable place for two sharing the very nice bedroom. The bedding and extra beds in the living room were inadequate for an 8 day stay. My friend and I were dismayed that it took over a day for a response to a complaint about the clunking refrigerator (compressor) and that it was not repaired or replaced (we turned it off at night, which was a poor resolution). The neighborhood was wonderful: beautiful, quiet and convenient to everything we wanted to do and see."
2486612,22468865,2014-11-07,22927381,Sandra,"Our host was very warm and helpful.  My questions were answered almost immediatly.  I loved the place very clean, quite, comfortable, spacious and welcoming.  I was in town for a conference and was able to get some work done while in the apartment. The apartment is in a central location with serveral restuarants and coffee places to go to if you want to dine out or a well equiped kitchen if you want to prepare your own meal.  Genjo and Jaye were very nice and helpful. "
2486612,22559631,2014-11-09,20289132,Jeni,"Enjoyed our stay at this very cute, ckean, quiet apartment on Beacon Hill. Host was very responsive and friendly,  check in and check out were easy and convenient.  Would definitely stay here again!"
2486612,24343715,2014-12-26,15814422,Jean,"Nice welcome, waiting for us at the door. A small booklet with information about the neighbourhood is provided, which is a nice touch. 
Bedding was OK for 5 people (two couples and one person flying solo) for one night, but would not recommend that much people for more than a few nights.
Bathroom was kinda old, but clean. Linen and soap provided."
2486612,24516386,2014-12-29,3708380,Steeve,"The place was perfect for our time in Seattle. Quiet and perfectly located, this appartment had a lot of character. There were coffee shop, pubs, and good restaurant around, which was very convenient. 
I will definitely stay there again!!
Thanks for your hospitality, Genjo! We had a great time!"
2486612,25458404,2015-01-16,20523702,Gabe,"The apartment was really nice and quiet. The neighborhood is safe and close to a number of amenities. No TV in the apartment, which makes sense given that it's in a meditation center. Host was gracious and accommodating. "
2486612,26408434,2015-02-11,17102524,Sherri,"Genjo's place was in the perfect location, 2 blocks from the light rail, in a clean, quiet neighborhood with great street parking. There was plenty of space for the two of us, and when a third friend joined us it was still roomy with plenty of beds. Great kitchen amenities and bathroom. Excellent stay for the price- great value!"
2486612,26986482,2015-02-23,2934716,Margaret,"The ultimate recommendation is that this is a return to the zen house for Jim and me.  Quiet, clean, everything we need w/in walking distance. The best is that it's only blocks from our son and his family!  Nice to see Jaye again and know he's just across the hall if we need anything.  Reminder, no tv (wonderful) but internet is on site and readily available."
2486612,29473959,2015-04-07,3927977,Bobbi,Genjo and his staff were very accommodating as our flight was late and so we were late in arriving at the airbnb. The location was in a nice quiet neighborhood very convenient to the city.  We enjoyed our stay there.
2486612,31658522,2015-05-08,12912420,Peter,"Genjo and Seiho were wonderful hosts and we had an amazing time staying here. The apartment is extremely quiet and close to Jefferson Park, as well as some small shops. Parking near the apartment was easy; there was always a spot in front of the building, even closer to the front door than the parking lot in the back.

Seiho, especially, was really wonderful and accommodated all of our needs. We have a 9-month baby, and Seiho went above and beyond by bringing us extra supplies and baby wipes. He was so kind and understanding, and such a friendly person.

Thank you so much for a great stay in Seattle!"
2486612,32084069,2015-05-13,26636119,Kim,The host canceled this reservation 40 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2486612,32177144,2015-05-15,1102082,Jess And Josh,Great location and cute apartment. We booked this unit for family who was coming to town to help assist after the birth of our baby. Unfortunately the baby ended up getting sick and our family felt that it was better to stay at our house to better help us. They stayed one night and ended up canceling the rest of the stay. Genjo was very accommodating to our unforeseen cancellation and quick to respond to our emails. 
2486612,32440457,2015-05-17,1465835,Alex,"This place was very nice, clean, peaceful, and comfortable. I would definitely come back to stay here again."
2486612,32799923,2015-05-21,20378169,Rick,"Quiet and clean apartment with restaurants and other amenities nearby.  This part of town is a bit outside of the normal areas I stay, but I definitely would stay here again."
2486612,34139749,2015-06-05,6204633,Carolyn,"We felt very welcomed indeed by Seiho. He was enthusiastic and helpful and gave us advice on where to eat as well as encouraging us to visit the park close by which did have ""killer-views""! "
2486612,34800025,2015-06-12,15086227,Mary,"My sister and I stayed at the apartment when we took a class in Seattle..  We were welcomed at the time we had set for our arrival by a very helpful and friendly host.  The apartment was just as advertised.  It was simple and we had plenty of room for two to sleep.  The futon in the living room was comfortable as was the other bed.  The neighborhood felt safe and local restaurants were good.  The light rail station was a quick walk, 10 mins, and then we were in Seattle in 10 minutes.  Jefferson park is a 5 minute walk and it has a spectacular view of the city. We had no needs or questions, but our host checked with us as we were heading out to be sure we  had everything.  It was rather hot the week we stayed but the windows open at night and the overhead fan made it comfortable.   I would stay again."
2486612,34872202,2015-06-13,36432,Brandy,This was a very peaceful location that was even closer to the train then we had planned. We needed to be downtown by 6am and this was perfect place to crash. There was the main bedroom and 3 additional sets of beds to choose from. The garden was beautiful and overall we both plan to go back here next time we are in Seattle
2486612,35228622,2015-06-16,11972393,Rosie,Genjo's Zen apartment was well equipped very clean in a good quiet location on a direct bus route into downtown Seattle near a great coffee shop Victrola. Due to jetlag we did not get to meet Genjo but he provided keys to let us get in and was very responsive to our texts and emails.
2486612,35451637,2015-06-19,25909978,Kirstin,"Genjo was a wonderful host! He was waiting for us when we arrived and did a mini-walk through of the apartment. The building and the  neighborhood was very quiet. The apartment was conveniently located to a grocery store, coffee shops, the highway and public transportation-I hardly used my car. Having a place to go that was not your standard hotel at the end of a long sight-seeing day made the trip to Seattle a great one! "
2486612,43626709,2015-08-21,26076459,Maria,"The ""Zen"" Apartment was just perfect for my dad, brother and me. It was super spacious and warm- we really felt at home with the fully equipped kitchen and the lovely garden outside. The beds and pull-out couches were all very comfortable and we slept very well. We arrived really late at night, but Seiho stayed up to wait for us! He also provided us with everything we needed, from plenty of soap for the bathroom to suggestions on where to hike near Mt. Rainier! He was a fantastic host and we can't thank him enough for sharing the space with us. The apartment is really close to the Beacon Hill stop for the light rail and several buses for getting around, and there are plenty of great restaurants and coffee shops in the area.
I highly recommend you stay in this apartment if you need some Seattle air and want to be in the North Beacon Hill area. It's truly a great home."
2486612,44467131,2015-08-26,5800474,Katherine,"A lovely and clean flat in a peaceful location away from downtown but still close to everything (Light Rail station only a few blocks away, 4 stops to downtown). More than enough space for a family of three. The flat was quiet and the gardens were lovely. We visited the park next door which had lovely views of the city too! We didn't meet Genjo during our stay, instead Seiho was in contact with us and was very helpful with everything. Overall a great experience."
2486612,45372569,2015-09-02,7571355,Emily,Wonderful stay and friendly people! Apartment was close to the light rail and convenient to city. Clean and comfy place atop Beacon Hill. Plenty of on street parking too!
2486612,46131453,2015-09-08,29236453,Steven,"Genjo was very accommodating with our stay, answering our initial queries within the hour and then inviting us to book. During our stay we hardly saw him as we were out and about, but he and one of his building members were around if needed. The apartment itself was located a short 5 min walk to the Seattle Subway and had all the local amenities needed (grocery store, local restaurants and bars, independent coffee house). During our stay we cooked in as much as we dined out, utilizing the kitchen.

The apartment itself if quite nice as a single bedroom, but we comfortably slept 4 taking advantage of the futon, fold-down couch, and the hide-a-bed chair in the main room. As well, the only noise from the area was either the occasional plane flying in overhead or the occasional siren from the roads. The apartment is a tucked on a side street which is nice and quiet, but close enough to main access roads to get onto the freeway or large road arteries.

If I'm returning to Seattle in the future, this spot will be at the top."
2486612,46559035,2015-09-11,4096926,Christopher,"We were a little thrown off by the apartment being part of an actual zen retreat center vs. being a zen like building. There was a foul smell from some hunters/fisherman that had previously stayed there and I wouldn't say the place was dirty, but it was in need of a clean. Genjo himself was a good host and very nice."
2486612,47495673,2015-09-19,4112502,Cynthia,"Fantastic location, close to light rail.  Nice apartment, had everything we needed."
2486612,47938244,2015-09-21,24681582,Chelsea,We were in town for my cousins wedding and had a little trouble with the key exchange process.  Check-in was after the start of the wedding and to get the key we needed to meet with the host.  This became a hassle quickly and I think finding a way for guests to access the apt. Without needing to coordinate meeting would really help.  We ended up racing over between the wedding and reception but were a bit earlier than we predicted and couldn't get ahold of anyone so ended up having to go back to the reception late and without the key still.  
2486612,48145744,2015-09-23,42084684,Michael,Genio and Seiho were both gracious hosts and accommodating.  This spot is in a nice neighborhood and extremely quiet.  It is located a few blocks away from the underground and close to a few coffee shops. 
2486612,51195080,2015-10-18,3991832,Michelle,"Our host was the best!  He sent us a text welcoming us, and then another text one day later, just to check in and make sure everything was OK.  The location is great- it was not too hard to find or get to where we needed to go in Seattle.  Also, we thoroughly enjoyed the art that is hanging up around the apartment, not a necessity, but a definite plus!"
2486612,52091351,2015-10-26,4826859,Doe,"We stayed at Genjo's apartment on the last day of our two week trip and it was wonderful. After his wife welcomed us at the house, Genjo also showed us around the apartment telling us everything we needed to know (public transport, where to find towels and so on). The unit is very clean, calm and the neighbourhood is neat and we directly felt comfy. There are a couple of bars around and public transport (Link Light trail) is easily accessible. We would definitly come back again. Thanks again for a wonderful last day in the States."
2486612,54271996,2015-11-17,19000894,May,"My boyfriend and I were greeted by Seiho, who works with Genjo and was very friendly and helpful! He was easy to get in contact with through text messaging. The space is plenty for 2 (or more) people with a full kitchen and two futons in addition to the bed. It's close to the freeways and taking local streets to downtown Seattle was not an issue. It took less than 15 minutes during non-rush hour commutes! Overall it was a great and convenient place to stay. "
2486612,54426182,2015-11-19,48973994,Chao,房子很有感觉，能让你找到八十年代老苏联的感觉，我非常喜欢这种怀旧感，房东很性感，他喜欢中国，墙上会挂上中国字

2486612,54963847,2015-11-25,42800038,Sean,"Thanks for the hospitality. Very welcoming, clean and a great location next to plenty of good eats. Would recommend to anyone!!"
2486612,57914102,2015-12-30,16807074,Maggie,"Jaye is always available to greet us, whether we are on time or delayed for some reason.  We love staying in Beacon Hill; we are within walking distance to our son and family. As stated in listing, the apartment is close to stores, restaurants. Walk to the light rail station and go downtown!  Apartment is great, everything you need; wireless available, no tv (hooray). It's our first choice for accommodation when we visit Seattle."
4645405,26710823,2015-02-17,23056077,Will,"Paige gave us very articulate and concise directions to her home; making it quite easy to locate. She was always very easy to reach when we needed something. We didn't have much time to sit down and speak with Paige because we were only there late at night to sleep. However; the brief time we did hang out, she seemed very friendly and personable. The house is located in a safe and friendly neighbourhood, and we would highly recommend it to others in the future!"
4645405,27706573,2015-03-09,28531622,Amy,My host and her roommate were extremely accommodating especially at last minute.  The house was conveniently located and very open and spacious.  The room was very nice and bed comfortable. 
4645405,28588586,2015-03-26,29174775,Dennis,Fun neighborhood. No problems. I would recommend to someone wanting to have fun in seattle. 
4645405,28845194,2015-03-30,16727273,Austin,"The location has great transit: the D Rapid Ride to downtown is a block away, and the bus to the U district stops right outside the front door, not to mention that one can just walk into Wallingford and Fremont. The room is comfy, nothing fancy--minimalist is an apt description. The bathroom was very nice. And Paige is a very kind host.

I would definitely stay here again!"
4645405,33275196,2015-05-26,26185432,Stephanie,"Room was great and clean. Loved the windows and how the sunlight shone through every morning. Walking distance to the bus stops, which was super convenient to getting downtown. Loved all the suggestions she said to go too as well!"
4645405,34096565,2015-06-04,2121401,Dylan,"Paige was a great host, I felt very welcome and the check-in, check-out was quick and easy. The house and room was clean and comfortable with character, a nice backyard, and a short walk to the heart of Fremont. "
4645405,34356093,2015-06-07,31551617,Sarah,"The room was as pictured - bare but clean.

Booking this listing was a bit difficult, it took a few communications back and forth with Paige to finally reserve the room.

Check-in was terrible. Paige did not provide me the lock box info, so I had to turn on my data to message her. She was unapologetic and let me know that the lock box number is on the 'About House' page; not really a smart idea, in my opinion. 
The most frustrating part about this was having to use my data. As a Canadian visiting Seattle without a data plan (we always use public wi-fi), using data to load webpages resulted in a substantial charge on my cellphone bill (extra $50 on my bill). Lastly, she did not leave wifi info, so I once again had to turn on my data to find out what her wifi username/password are. 

While the room was totally fine, comfortable bed, clean etc. the check in process was a nightmare."
4645405,35521381,2015-06-19,11390890,Victor,Paige was great. Real flexible. Super laid-back and nice. Room was neat and clean. Couldn't have asked for more. Thanks!!
4645405,37384493,2015-07-06,24849334,Kevin,Paige's room was perfect for our needs. Clean and subtle. We were up early and came home late so we didn't get a chance to meet Paige but she kept in touch by text. Our only issue was finding the place. It's located near over/underpasses and our onboard navigation led us astray. But plenty of parking nearby once you've found it. Wouldn't mind booking again!
4645405,39973970,2015-07-27,398153,William,I (sadly) never met Paige in person because I left early and came back late. But Paige was a great host. The room was quiet and clean and the bed was surprisingly super comfortable.
4645405,40268004,2015-07-29,10565886,Joana,Paige made me feel welcome. I highly recommend her coffee.  The room was nice and clean. And the house is beautiful. Neighborhood is safe and very close to coffee shops and bars. Very convenient.  
4645405,41427503,2015-08-07,8728532,Jacob,Great home in a great location.
4645405,41486601,2015-08-07,39756752,Leigh,"All amenities available, Paige was very welcoming. Room was simple and comfortable is a fun neighborhood. "
4645405,44052154,2015-08-23,29523956,Christian,"Didn't get to meet Paige, but she was helpful via text/AirBnB messaging.  Room felt small due to large bed but house was interesting and bathroom was clean and very pleasant. "
4645405,45336888,2015-09-01,42435902,Kye,"Had a great experience staying here on a trip to Seattle with my wife. Paige gave clear directions to the place, provided everything we could need, and was super responsive to questions. I recommend this room to anyone who wants to check out Fremont--it's a really cool neighborhood!"
4645405,46535367,2015-09-11,18690034,Lise,"Listing was exactly as described. Comfortable bed in small room, no frills, but as described and expected.  Host was not there most of the time, but always responded promptly to email/text messages.  Great location for transportation-easy bus ride to downtown, airport and University area."
4645405,47799026,2015-09-21,3850667,Danh,Paige was a great host. She answered all my many questions before and after the trip. She was there during my first night and was very welcoming. Her list of recommendations were awesome. The room is good. The location was great being right next to two major bus lines that can take you anywhere in Seattle.
4645405,48951262,2015-09-29,16545323,Katie,Simple room. Paige was very nice to speak with and allowed us to check-in early which we appreciated. We had very minimal time in the space so hard to comment too much. 
4645405,49739254,2015-10-05,39001802,Ryan,"Our stay at Paige's home was lovely—the house was clean and nicely decorated, the room was tidy and bed was big. Thanks for sharing your home! "
4645405,51474645,2015-10-20,44882754,Tashina,"Our stay at Paige's place was A+!  Clean, comfortable, adorable, good location & access to public transit. Would definately recommend booking Paige's place again."
4645405,52430730,2015-10-29,6453452,Lisa, J'ai apprécié la décoration de la chambre très épurée. Deux lignes de bus en direction de Downtown au coin de la rue. Je recommanderai sans hésiter ce Airbnb. 
4645405,53428366,2015-11-08,39967812,Kayla,"Paige was really nice. I saw her once, but she responded quickly when i had a question. Her place is also super cute & not that far from dt! "
4645405,55131072,2015-11-28,31365524,Keyana,Paige's house was very lovely and in a great neighborhood with many restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Check-in was easy and flexible and the room matched the description perfectly. We didn't meet Paige in person but she responded quickly to all our messages! Had a great time. 
3281072,14589028,2014-06-22,2350257,Nick,"Janet's home was everything you expect and more, her 2 bed / 1 bath is a very cozy place atop the hill in West Seattle. Our visit started with a warm welcome that included chocolates, dog treats for our little pooch, coffee, tea and more for our short stay. She is by a number of great bakeries, coffee stops, restaurants, and about 10 minutes from downtown Seattle by car. "
3281072,15073817,2014-07-01,3805937,Cuyler,"The West Seattle Bungalow was such a great place to stay. The location is a 10/10 - just one block away from restaurants, bars, stores and more on California St. Lauren is such a great host and her dog Angus is a sweetheart. We felt right at home from the minute we walked in the door. I highly recommend this charming house. Perfect for those wanting to explore West Seattle!"
3281072,15610114,2014-07-12,17830716,Caitrin,"Wonderful place to stay in West Seattle! Great location, very clean & organized! We had a great two night stay!"
3281072,15775532,2014-07-15,2852653,Carlos,"Janet was easy and prompt to communicate, house was clean, wonderful, welcoming, comfortable, cozy and functional.
Has a brand new kitchen with everything you may need, and the house is quiet and it is in a great neighborhood that one can easily walk to West Seattle's restaurants, shops.
We enjoyed our stay there, and highly recommend it."
3281072,16266603,2014-07-24,2893840,Will,Very nice house in a great neighborhood! Will stay here again.
3281072,16561899,2014-07-29,13659685,Michael,Great house and perfect location for what we needed. Lauren was wonderful to work with and very flexible. The house was right across the street from a playground which was entertaining for our son. We were able to easily commute to all the tourist spots and parking in from of the house was not a problem at all. The house was clean with nice big windows allowing you to see Mt Rainer from the kitchen table. We would definitely recommend this place to friends and would stay here again if we're back in Seattle.
3281072,33096470,2015-05-25,20916465,Ron,House and neighborhood were great.
3281072,34775175,2015-06-12,1681532,Bryce,"Our stay was terrific. Lauren was great about communicating whenever we had any questions before and after our arrival. Plus, the house is super cute and a very short walk from the heart of West Seattle."
3281072,35223437,2015-06-16,32589716,Jessica,"We had a wonderful time staying here! It was a short walk to tons of restaurants and shops in West Seattle and we loved being so close to Alki Beach. We took advantage of the Water Taxi from West Seattle to Downtown, which was really fun and very convenient! The house was very clean and just as pictured, the view of Mt. Rainier from the kitchen table was a such a fun bonus! "
3281072,38377261,2015-07-15,12182131,Dan,"Lauren's home is very clean and cozy with all the amenities necessary for an extended family stay (my wife, 3 year old, and myself). It's located 1 block off the heart of West Seattle, ""the Junction"". Here you'll find all the restaurants you could possibly need (Mashiko is #1 sushi in all of Seattle!), grocery stores, a great record store, and much, much more. Plus, traveling with a toddler, the playground directly across from the front door worked out amazingly for us! Downtown is only minutes away by car, or you can hop an express bus 3 blocks down the street that has you at 2nd and Seneca in less than 15 minutes. We will definitely inquire about the rental availability on our next Seattle visit!"
3281072,38858605,2015-07-19,5320090,Teresa,Lauren's home was lovely and very comfortable.  It had everything we needed and Lauren's communication was great.  We were also very happy with the location.  We were within walking distance of many restaurants and coffee houses and a easy drive to downtown.  Thank you Lauren!
3281072,40455742,2015-07-31,35325576,Debbie,"This West Seattle Bungalow was perfect !!!  While we did not meet our host, only because we were so busy with family,  we found the accommodations filled all of our needs.  The description of the property were accurate and the neighborhood was lovely."
3281072,41360980,2015-08-07,13997626,Lewis,"This is a cute and well located house in West Seattle, a short drive from downtown, yet quiet, and with wonderful shops and restaurants of its own.  The bed in the main bedroom is comfortable, the bathroom small but adequate, with a terrific strong shower.  The kitchen has a gas stove, big and clean refrigerator, plates, pots, coffee machine.  Lauren lives downstairs in a basement apartment, but we couldn't hear anything from down there.  There is cable tv and netflix, and comfortable furniture.  We enjoyed it and would stay there again."
3281072,41690915,2015-08-08,4348145,Lisa,Lauren's home was the perfect spot for exploring Seattle.  The house was very comfortable and in a great location...just a short drive from Seattle & plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance.  We also took advantage of the water taxi which was a fun experience!  Lauren was very nice and accommodating.  We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay.
3281072,42258252,2015-08-12,27236721,Elaine,Fabulous stay.  Beautiful colors and immaculately clean with thoughtful attention to detail.  It's obvious Lauren put a great deal of thought into making guests feel comfortable.  Great location West Seattle within easy walking distance to restaurants and neat shops along California Ave (2 blocks away) - this even more so because I just had knee surgery 5 weeks prior and was still using my crutches part of the stay but could walk places.  She welcomed us briefly and then gave us privacy to enjoy the house.  Highly recommend to anyone who appreciates a peaceful/serene but convenient environment.
3281072,43033570,2015-08-17,19836671,Wing,Nice respite between visiting Olympic and Mt Ranier National Parks. All the perks of being close by to the busy parts of Seattle but away from the hustle and bustle. Love taking the water taxi over to downtown and Pier Market. Clean comfortable place. 
3281072,43679589,2015-08-21,40052831,Rob,This was my first time using Airbnb and it certainly won't be last! Check in was a quick easy and the location is perfect. Nice and quiet but just a quick walk to the restaurants and shops on California Ave. Walked to Mashiko for sushi as recommended and had an amazing meal there! Driving to downtown wasn't hard at all either for the nights we went there.  The view of Mt. Rainier as you leave each day brought a smile to my face as someone that normally lives in flat northeastern Wisconsin. Would definitely stay here again!
3281072,45106781,2015-08-31,37250483,Leah,We had a wonderful stay.  Everything was exactly like it was described. The place was nice and clean. Check-in and out was very easy. I would definitely stay again!

We had a lovely time staying here, thank you Lauren!"

We were walking distance from some nice restaurants and very close to public transportation. We were able to explore a lot of exciting things in Seattle and come back to the quiet of Lizbeth's back porch to relax. 
"
2822984,16689123,2014-07-31,5722284,Lauren,"Lizbeth was fantastic!  She was very accommodating and flexible with check-in and check-out times, and made me feel very welcome in her home.  The room/office was absolutely wonderful and provided not only some much needed rest, but also a relaxing space to get some work done on my computer.  The house and neighborhood are gorgeous, and are located in a very convenient part of Seattle, whether you are visiting UW or touring the city.   Thanks Lizbeth!"
2822984,17016323,2014-08-05,1810197,Loran,"This was just great.  I needed a place to sleep while I took a weekend workshop in Seattle.  Lizbeth was friendly and helpful, and the house is nice and comfortable.  "

2822984,29756955,2015-04-12,25116514,Aditya,Lizbeth was really friendly and accommodating. She agreed to accommodate an extra friend who decided to visit me kinda spontaneously.  Very clean house and the friendliest cat Baloo. Highly recommended considering its proximity to the university of Washington. 
2822984,33312680,2015-05-26,33243836,Muhan,"The neighborhood is really cozy, and very convenient if you have a car. The house is lovely, and Lizbeth is sweet and smart. We really enjoyed staying in the place, and would definitely recommend it."
2822984,33745953,2015-05-31,34172943,Brazil,"Lizbeth was a lovely host! Her place was the perfect stay. She made sure we had fresh linens, some breakfast, also she always made sure to keep us posted on the easiest way to get around. (Buss schedules and peak hours) she has the cutest cats and a gorgeous backyard view! She made us feel right at home. Two thumbs up for lizbeth! "
2822984,34830568,2015-06-12,8120851,Holly,"Lizbeth's place was perfect for our short trip to Seattle. We had a lovely little bed, with french doors leading out to the balcony. We were only in Seattle overnight and needed a quick place to sleep that was close to downtown. We loved her place and would definitely recommend it!"
2822984,36050726,2015-06-24,14725324,Bettina,"Lizbeth made sure I felt welcome even though she wasn't going to be there.  She had given me her neighbour's phone number, and he came with his charming little daughter the minute I called.  He was concerned I understood how things worked and whether I was hungry.  

I enjoyed staying at Lizbeth’s very much.  It was convenient to all I had to do in Seattle  -- even though once I got there, it’s so quiet and pleasant, I really only wanted to relax in the most welcoming swing on the deck!  The cats are well-behaved, beautiful.  And not only are her next-door neighbours great, several people I stopped on the street to ask directions or information about the bus stops were also kind.  Thank you, Lizbeth!
"
2822984,36411470,2015-06-28,16260916,Allison,Description was accurate. Adorable house with updated bath and kitchen in a cute and safe neighborhood. Lizbeth communicated with me via text and quickly responded to our questions regarding arrival time and entry specifics. We met her on the 2nd evening - nice and open conversation about life in general. 
2822984,37023077,2015-07-03,26247869,Angela,Accommodations as described.  Thanks so much for hosting me last minute!
2822984,37200501,2015-07-05,16071275,Rachel,"Our group had a great time at Lizbeth's home. The space was very clean and everything we needed was laid out. We particularly enjoyed the deck out back - great view, friendly neighbors, and two sweet cats. Never met Lizbeth, but she was always quick to respond and very accommodating. Would definitely recommend!"
2822984,43934702,2015-08-23,767254,Melanie,"Darling house and very clean.  Lizbeth was very accommodating of our late night arrival.  It was just what the three of us needed, in a perfect location, for a short overnight stay.  Lizbeth is very gracious."
2822984,44580538,2015-08-27,39769279,Matt,"Lizbeth's Tutor home was beautiful, comfortable and charming.  I felt extremely lucky to stay here - and have a airbnb host willing to share such an incredible home.  Even though I didnt get to stay long it really was like having a home away from home.  It was also very convenient for biking with coffee shops, parks, restaurants and pubs just down the road.  A great place in a great community in an awesome city!  Doesn't get much better than that!"
2822984,45134041,2015-08-31,15974469,Danielle,"Lizbeth's house is adorable and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood. The 71 bus stop that goes straight to downtown is just steps away, and it was only $17 Uber ride. She was always quick to communicate, and offered great suggestions. We had the house to ourselves, and her two cats are fun. A great host, would definitely come back!"
2822984,47909340,2015-09-21,3746160,Gavin,"Lizbeth's house was fantastic! The location was great, a lovely quiet neighborhood, and the house itself was clean warm and comfortable. 
We didn't get to meet Liz but she was always very quick to respond to all of our questions and helped make the weekend go as smooth as possible. 
If you're lucky enough to get the opportunity to stay here you should definitely take it!"
2822984,51375260,2015-10-19,13348538,Gloria,Lizbeth was a great host! My flight got in early and she was flexible with her schedule so that I could arrive at her place earlier than originally planned. Her place is kept very clean and is about a 20 minute walk away from Seattle Children's hospital and University Village. Lizbeth also gave helpful advice on where to eat and how to get around seattle. Very much enjoyed my stay! 
4735761,30273009,2015-04-19,31424769,Maksim,"Skyler was really open and extremely friendly  to host me for 2 nights at Seattle .He explained to me all about interesting places at Seattle. 
 i used a mattress because couch was a bit small for me . Skyler's roommate John was also friendly . At the second day they gave me a key from apartment, so i got in apartment at night without any problem.
it's around 30 min by light rail from  Rainier Beach station( his place )  to downtown and 5 min walking from ap. to light rail station and also  pretty safe at night time caused i got back from downtown around (phone number hidden) p.m.  Also a couple of food markets pretty close in walking distance. 
Bathroom, kitchen and shared space (living room ) was quit clean. If u are not so scrupulous about cleanliness and need just spend a couple of nights i would recommend this  place. 

 
 "
4735761,30935558,2015-04-29,29166999,Steven,"Skyler is a really great guy and was a wonderful host! He took the time to answer all of my questions about Seattle and gave me a lot of places to check out during my time there. He immediately included me in with his group of friends, all of which are very chill and laid-back. His place is in Rainier Beach which is two blocks from the light rail. Rainier Beach light rail is two stops from the SeaTac airport--very convienent. It's about a 25 minute ride via the light rail into downtown Seattle and is $2.50 for a one-way ride. Skyler's couch is definitely very cozy but I chose to sleep on the air matteress because of my height--whichever option works best for you. I would definitely recommend bringing your own pillow(s) and blanket(s). Skyler will give you a key to his apartment so you can come and go as you please. One additional note, Skyler and his roomate John both smoke cannibis in the apartment but they are perfectly willing to accomadate you and smoke outside or in their friends apartment above them.  If you're looking for a laid-back atmosphere and don't mind crashing on a couch or air matteress, this is the place for you!"
4735761,40057340,2015-07-27,39287179,Grant,"Skylar was an awesome host and I had a great time staying there. He is a really great guy and I couldn't have asked for a better time. If I am ever back in Seattle I will be using Skylar's service again, and I would recommend a stay with him to anyone! "
4735761,40877548,2015-08-02,27272150,Kevin,"Staying with Skyler definitely made the first day of our roadtrip the best first day of a roadtrip ever! The moment we arrived at his place we instantly felt welcome and comfortable. Skyler and his friends invited us for beer and barbecue and took us to the beach afterwards. He also showed us a little of downtown Seattle and took us to one of the best Sushi places in town. Skyler is an easy going and very nice guy we would everybody recommend to stay with! 
P.S. We loved the blow up matress!"

4735761,45756997,2015-09-05,43237914,Dejan,"Staying at Skyler`s place was great, and i would recommend it always. If i come back again in USA i will stay there again. Place is well positioned just 2 stops with light train from Sea-Tac airport. And for Skyler and his friends i have just to say, keep it up."
4735761,48668489,2015-09-27,45099097,Leigh,"Had a very nice stay with Skyler and his room mate. Clean house in a convenient location, great conversation and advice. Would not hesitate to stay there again, just a good chilled pad with some swell bunkbeds."
2868006,12867916,2014-05-12,1996736,Ayla,"My partner and I had a very nice stay at Eric's apartment. His place was clean and comfortable, and Eric is a generous and attentive host. He's happy to give advice on the neighbourhood - he helped us out with directions and public transit tips.

The Greenlake neighbourhood is just on the edge of Ballard, and you can grab a bus a few blocks from Eric's place that will get you downtown in roughly half an hour, which we made use of while staying there. Eric's place is a block off a major road (Aurora) which makes commuting into the city easy, but you wouldn't want to do much sightseeing on that strip. Luckily the neighbourhoods to the west are nicer for walking in.

Overall this is an simple, comfortable, well-looked after room located in a nice neighbourhood just outside the urban core. Thanks again to Eric for his hospitality!"
2868006,16766817,2014-08-02,14715355,Brianna,"Highly recommend this place for long-term stays! Eric was great – super nice, helpful and very accommodating. The bedroom is small but functional, and the apartment is very nice and clean. Loved the location: the E-line downtown is convenient, the lake is just a couple blocks away, and there is lots to do around the neighborhood. "
2868006,20493537,2014-09-30,2359712,Brandon,"Eric was a wonderful host (best I've had through this service).  Very nice and accommodating.  The space was clean, quiet, and close to a number of restaurants/stores.  Highly recommend if you're visiting Seattle.  "
2868006,37725131,2015-07-09,28973599,Sarah,The host canceled this reservation 53 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2868006,39364229,2015-07-23,15161908,Karthik,"Eric's place is the perfect place to stay in Seattle. I was there for a long term (10 months) and from the first to the last day, Eric made me feel home. The place is perfect, always clean, and perfectly located 2 minutes from Green Lake and it is really easy to go to other parts of the city. I highly recommend Eric as the perfect host and his place as the perfect place to stay in Seattle."
2868006,44212968,2015-08-24,15404104,Sean,"Pleasure to communicate with, and very flexible with schedule changes. Thanks!"
2868006,44471683,2015-08-26,38710435,Adele & Stuart,Eric's place was very tidy and we had a lovely stay. He provided us with some great help and lots of info prior to & during our stay. Easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any messages.
2868006,45112132,2015-08-31,22728568,Mitchel,"Eric was an absolutely amazing host! He was very friendly and accommodating to us while we stayed, offering plenty of good advice on the area and about Seattle in general. Scheduling our check-in/check-out was very flexible. Above all, he made the place feel like our home and it was a pleasure to get to know him. I would highly recommend staying here to anyone"

1520533,7781334,2013-10-02,8939731,Brian,"Despite a few issues related to the age of the house, I had a great stay here. It was nice being in a place with other techies. The walk to and from South Lake Union takes about a half hour. You'll get a nice hill-climb on the way back, but it's not too tough."
1520533,9099540,2013-12-07,9078702,Davin,"I had a fantastic time at the Hacker House during my two month stay. The people there were all very friendly and were from a variety of interesting backgrounds (Programmers, entrepreneurs, engineers, and even a graduate molecular biology student). The house was very clean and is already furnished and stocked. Andy has done an excellent job with the house and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay. "
1520533,9416029,2013-12-27,8536593,Leonardo,"The house is close to everything, The kind of people who stay in the house in general are entrepeneur, developers, etc... It's a great place to improve your network, also Matthew is a great host, he makes everything he can to make you few confortable.

1520533,21070446,2014-10-11,14089981,Julie Jia-Fen,"I was supposed to live in the Cap Hill one, but ended staying in the Cor36 one. The view is amazing, right front of the Lake Union, and the house is pretty equipped. Aaron's doing great as a House Captain greeting newcomers and address our concerns. I met lots of nice people, and had great time chatting with them or sharing different stories. I really appreciate their companion. My journey in Seattle wouldn't be complete without them."
1520533,23918445,2014-12-14,2776176,Randall,Great experience! Thanks!
1520533,28643868,2015-03-28,5765580,Callum,"A nice hostel, room to work on projects and the people were nice. Close to most things in Seattle and overall a good experience"
1520533,29076040,2015-04-03,29760646,Aristide,"Convenient location with great nooks and cozy places to study. It was a pleasure to walk over Lakeview via Eastlake on my way to South LAke Union. I was not expecting a towel or linens, but both were given as well as a laundered comforter! The kitchen was clean and the rules of the house were all followed. Aaron, the house grounds manager was kind, available, and amicable. "
1520533,43028933,2015-08-17,31431721,Danika,"I (email hidden) House during the summer while I was in Seattle for an internship. It was a great experience. 

Everyone living there is great. The house was tidy and would be professionally cleaned regularly. 

The location could not be better both for the night life as well as amenities. It's also close to a lot of bus routes."
1520533,51493343,2015-10-20,12958880,Vishal,"Io House is a nice and affordable place to stay in Seattle. The location is very convenient and it is in the heart of Capitol Hill market. Almost everything you will need  (food, groceries, public transport etc.) is 5 min. walk from the house. It is a old house and can use some renovation, but still for the location and price it is pretty good."
6074312,40955987,2015-08-03,28552608,Cindy,"The house is amazing, with a nice living and dining room, nice view in room, location is good, parking is free where just behind the house, shared restroom and bathroom is really clean and easy to use. The room is a little bit too small for 2 persons, top floor is really hot during summer though we have a big fan and an air-condition sitting on the floor, they are really noisy as they are working, it needed to take quite a while to cooler the room after we came back from a day trip. No fridge provided for storing our food, not convenient as we had milk, no kitchen can be used during summer, we can't do light cook by ourself."
6074312,41514335,2015-08-07,19751105,Cameron,This bed n' breakfast was SO GREAT. Couldn't believe how immaculate everything was. Arrived to a comfortable bed with chocolates on the pillow. Breakfast in the morning was a nice spread too. 
6074312,47536641,2015-09-20,17876531,Sophie,"Not me but my sister stayed at this Bed & Breakfast and she loved it.
The house is nicely decorated and the rooms are very comfortable and well equipped. There were even little chocolates on the pillow on the arrival day. Everything was very clean, especially the shared bathrooms. The provided breakfast was great and Emma and Rachel were both friendly and accommodating. I definitely recommend to stay here!"
6074312,48804539,2015-09-28,19754919,Chris,Had a pleasant time staying at this cozy bed and breakfast establishment. The room was super clean and comfortable. The place is situated in a quiet neighborhood but only blocks aways from all the Capitol Hill restaurant and bars which was great and convenient. I would definitely stay there again.
5524530,31350886,2015-05-04,4457440,Allyson,"Melissa and Abil curated a perfect event. The house was warm, welcoming and beautiful. Every guest had a delightful and memorable time and the five-course dinner that Melissa made mind-blowingly ambitions and delicious. I recommend their space and their hospitality without any reservations. "
5524530,33664668,2015-05-31,29739897,Elske,"We had an event to support Cappy's boxing team youth boxers. bed Baked and beyond is a great place to hold an event. Very flexible with ample room for entertaining inside and out! Everyone who came to the event loved the space! We set up in one of the parlor so to show a sort film. Then the youth boxers did a short demo in the yard of their skills. Melissa, Abil and Courtny did a great job with everything. I would totally recommend this space for any type of an event. From non-profit benefit like ours, to wedding or birthday party. The guests could also book the rooms to stay after the event! Thank you again you guys Rock!!!"
5524530,35671963,2015-06-21,374207,Mark,"WOW!... this is what AirBNB Superhosts are all about... such a welcome !! (and patience, after we were close to 5 hours later w/check in than originally planned), such a beautiful home, and such lovely entertaining couple to host us!! Beautifully decorated, with such interesting furnishings, every wall and corner a story or unique piece.  The beer connoisseur Abil,  shared some wonderful craft beer from a local brewer ; and Chef Melissa created a wonderful continental breakfast with an aromatic treat of fresh baked Strawberry and banana muffins...  Again, superb!!! only wish we could have stayed more time at this beautiful home with the amazing hosts! Our family from South Korea loved your home and the hospitality as well!  For our next visit to Seattle, this will be our home to come to stay.... 5 star perfection without a doubt!"
5524530,41362342,2015-08-07,14985605,Carlo,"Melissa and Abil were excellent guests and their place was consistent with the description provided over the internet. The house is very conveniently located, nice and friendly. it is probably not the ideal place if you have young kids, as beds are high and kids could fall over, but apart from that it was a great place were to stay. last but not least, Melissa's freshly baked muffins served at breakfast were awesome."
5524530,44634940,2015-08-28,3052974,Natalia,"Melissa and Abil did an amazing job hosting our wedding lunch and ceremony at their home. Not only did they provide lodging for our out of town family, but they catered a delicious meal for 18 people out in the backyard. The setting was beautiful and the handled the lunch entirely, providing rentals, tableware, glassware, etc. After lunch they reorganized layout to rows of chairs for ceremony and we were married under the fig tree. Wedding planning is hectic and they handled all the curve balls we threw at them graciously. Our family that stayed with them enjoyed the relaxed porch time said the breakfast they provided was delicious! They even made a lovely sign for us to use to guide people to the lunch!! "
5524530,47709580,2015-09-21,40695535,Angela,"My husband and I used this as both the lodging and reception space for our wedding.  

Pros:
•The house is beautiful and big! Plenty of space for several members of the wedding party to all stay comfortably.
•Melissa and Abil are wonderful and friendly hosts.

Cons:
•The hosts are fairly new at using their home as an event space and not just a B&B, so there will likely be a few bumps along the way. Specifically, dinner was served an hour and a half later than expected.
•On a scale of 5, the food was a 3.  We selected a simple menu, but were unimpressed by the execution, the taste and the presentation of the dinner.
•The temperature in the house definitely exceeded comfortable levels at several points in the evening. We were hot and uncomfortable. The cake frosting was melted by the time we sat down for dessert.
•Their assistant was hired to be the ""server"" for the evening, but she was really used in the kitchen to help the cooks (they were a bit overwhelmed for most of the evening). We paid for a server, not a chef's assistant.

Overall, we enjoyed the house itself, and the hosts were pleasant. We would use this place again as a B&B but not to host plated events."
5524530,48268095,2015-09-25,34209583,Yoshi,"Melissa and Abil are very warm and accommodating.  We really felt at home. They and their assistant, Courtney, were very knowledgeable of the things to do, the places to eat around Seattle.  The location was  convenient.  The house was very clean and lovingly cared.  The home made breakfasts were wonderful! "
5637990,46003248,2015-09-07,39883464,Tony,The house was great. We weren't able to meet April but that was because we arrived very late in the night. The house has a coded lock so no key was needed. The location of the house was perfect for our Labor Day weekend vacation. It was a quick drive to Seattle center and pikes place market. The only bothersome thing I can think of that might turn a person away from this great home was the long flight of stairs you need to walk up to get to the home. We didn't mind it much. But I can see how some might have some trouble. 
5637990,54822076,2015-11-23,49362576,Heidi,"I stayed in April house with my daughter and her 2 friends are a trip to explore Universities in the Pacific Northwest.  The house was in the perfect location and the view was fantastic.  The girls loved having the entire downstairs and I enjoyed the guest bedroom.  The house was warm and cozy and felt like home to us for 2 days.  It was a little bit difficult to find the staircase originally, but it only took once.  Thank you for such a great stay and for getting back to us so quickly about where the closest store was and anything else that we inquired about.  We would absolutely stay there again. 
"
5637990,55398072,2015-12-01,46387051,Lisa,"Minimum Hospitality standards were not met. There was no welcoming material or information other then a text stating that the sheets were changed and where we could find clean towels.
Neither the kitchen or bathroom trash had been emptied. The dishwasher had dirty dishes in it and used coffee grinds were left in the coffee maker. The kitchen counters and stove top were stained and dirty as were the counter tops in both bathrooms. Personal toilet articles (toothbrushes, make up, used soap, shampoo and conditioner) were left out on the bathroom counters and in the showers. The dining 
room table still had crumbs on it and we had to clean the living room sofa table with windex in order to even utilize the that room.

It appears that little or no effort was made to clean or otherwise make the residence hospitable for guests, especially paying guests. These conditions made for a most uncomfortable stay.  "
6153532,34911336,2015-06-13,17931672,Brennan,"Tracy is a sweetheart and her place is a wonderful retreat. You'll be in a cottage style accommodation that is separate from the main house. Tons of privacy and a lot of space. I was so, so happy with it. I will definitely try to stay with Tracy again next time I'm in Seattle!"
6153532,35334304,2015-06-17,34644837,Erin,"Love love love Tracy and her adorable little home away from home! It was quiet, private  and comfortable.  Thanks Tracy!"
6153532,36041084,2015-06-24,12934633,Ryan,"I had a great time staying at Tracy's place!  Arrival was easy and quick with a lock for the key right by the door.  The room is very well appointed--clean, classy-industrial feel.  The shower and bathroom were clean and plenty of linens.

Perks: Pour over coffee!!  I loved it!  Thank you for providing that.  And the best part--the bed.  This bed is amazingly comfortable.  In fact, it's one of the most comfy beds I've ever slept in.  

Location was in the heart of the city--close to everything.  You must try Delancy Pizza down the street--Fantastic pizza and wine.

I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to my next visit."
6153532,36437482,2015-06-28,19857246,Kelly,My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at Tracy's cottage. The cottage is just as described and looks even better than in the pictures. You can definitely tell that Tracy spent time getting this place set up. The neighborhood was perfect for what we were looking for. It was in an area where you could easily enjoy the neighborhood perks as well as taking some transit and checking out the city. Tracy was very welcoming and easy to communicate throughout the whole process. She has a lock box to grab the keys for the cottage so checking in and out was very simple. My husband and I also had the opportunity to enjoy a fire with Tracy and a few of her friends which was very nice. It was great to talk to other people who have moved to the area from all over and get their perspective on the city. Overall it was a truly wonderful experience staying at Tracy's cottage and I would definitely recommend others to stay there. 
6153532,36823808,2015-07-01,7344230,Noemi,"I was really needing a respite from roughing it on my epic road trip. Tracy's cottage was absolutely perfect! It was cozy AND chic at the same time. 
Check-in was effortless. Hence, I was immediately able to make myself comfortable with the wonderful shower in the awesome  bathroom and take a nap on the spacious bed before exploring the area. 
The things that really stood out to me was the cleanliness and attention to detail (extra towels and linens, coffee and supplies, phone chargers, and info about the area!). And how can I forget her sense of design. I really feel that this one of the aspects I need to feel comfortable in a space. There was no clutter. Just clean lines and lots of cleanliness. Staying here was like something out of a CB2 ad! This was definitely better than staying at a hotel. 

In addition to the comforts of this place, it turns out that Tracy is a foodie (as I), so she provided some great suggestions for the various local eateries, breweries, bakeries, wine bars, and such. They really helped me when figuring out where to go. 

Though I did not personally meet Tracy, I definitely felt her warm hospitality. I certainly would not hesitate to stay here again in the future. I even raved about this place to friends as some of them are members of AirBnB. :)

6153532,37205786,2015-07-05,35526994,Shannon,"My mother and I really enjoyed our stay at the industrial chic ensuite cottage while visiting Seattle. The private cottage separated from the main house was spacious and well stocked with coffee, tea, an assortment of milks, hair dryer, and plenty of towels to name only a few of the many amenities. The bed was extremely comfortable and the blankets were very cozy. The space is very well designed. The furnishings and fixtures come together nicely to create the industrial chic style.

Communication with Tracy was excellent and she was flexible with check-in time, offering key access in a locked box for our late night arrival. The street and neighborhood are in a nice residential area and there is plenty of street parking for those traveling by car."
6153532,37796576,2015-07-10,14332088,Karen,"Awesome area and comfy place to stay. Very cool cottage that has everything you need.
Tracy was gracious and let me stay another night that was unexpected. 
Loved the area and it was easy to get around with GPS."

It was great to explore the Ballard neighborhood! Everything was extremely seamless. 

I hope to be able to stay there again on my next visit!"
6153532,38648747,2015-07-17,37429333,Christina,The Industrial Chic Cottage was just lovely. It was clean and inviting. The neighborhood felt very safe for walking around. There were small quaint restaurants and bars within walking distance. The best was the French Bakery...try the ham and cheese croissants!

6153532,39517079,2015-07-24,8222857,Leigh-Anne,"What a fabulous space! My husband, daughter and I stayed in the cottage for two nights and loved it. It was so thoughtfully designed with lots of added extras. The neighborhood reviews proved helpful come breakfast time, when we were able to walk down the street and choose from a couple highly-recommended spots. I lived in Seattle for over ten years, so I love the hideaway places best! Thanks for a lovely experience! Can't wait to come back!!"
6153532,40378553,2015-07-30,2456005,Amy,"This house was the perfect little retreat during a visit to Seattle.  It was private, quiet and beautifully decorated.  I really appreciated all the thoughtful touches (tea, coffee, and all the perfect furnishings) that graced this charming little getaway.  Everything was clean and bright and well-appointed. Parking was easy to find on the street and I slept like a baby. I love a no-fuss checkin, and Tracy's process couldn't be easier.  Highly recommended!"
6153532,41092962,2015-08-04,35899660,Jean,"The cottage is decorated very nicely, with convenient touches such as coffee and tea, and recommendations for nearby shops and restaurants.  There is a very comfortable bed, a great shower, and plenty of closet space.  The location is great for visiting the trendy and chic Ballard neighborhood and Tracy is very friendly.  We definitely will stay here again!"
6153532,41785135,2015-08-09,3424599,David,Tracy was very helpful in providing options for getting to the cottage and left three pages of good recommendations for food and activities in Ballard and the surrounding neighborhoods. The cottage is exactly as shown in the images and was an extremely comfortable place to stay. The neighborhood is very charming with a few very good restaurants and coffee shops. I would definitely stay here again.
6153532,42422436,2015-08-13,11801342,Brock,Tracy was an amazing host. Great communication and made us feel very welcome. Her place is exactly as advertise (even better IMO)! HIGHLY recommend.
6153532,43258719,2015-08-18,28371053,Bryan,"Tracy was truly an exceptional host with an incredible cottage that we stayed in.  Everything was extremely transparent from scheduling our stay, to getting the key and making ourselves feel right at home.  Being brand new to the area, we were truly pleased to find that Tracy had left some suggestions to where to eat, which turned out to be great options....Some were even the best food that we had during our stay.  When we go back, the Industrial Chic Ensuite Cottage will be the only place we lay our heads!"
6153532,43962072,2015-08-23,38401937,Lisa,"This chic little cottage was the perfect getaway. From the moment I walked in the front door I felt as if I was coming home. The ambiance and cute decor were warm and welcoming. Tracy left a map and list of local coffee shops, eateries and bars which made it easy when needing a locals inside tip. The neighborhood was super cute and made taking a morning stroll very relaxing and enjoyable. I appreciated the thoughtful touches like the hair dryer, toiletries and an iron! All of which came in handy. I really liked all the windows and natural light too. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone staying in or near Ballard. 

Thank you for your hospitality :)"
6153532,44588382,2015-08-27,9506771,Justin,"Tracy was a great host and her cottage was incredible. I'm so glad I found a comfortable, super clean, thoughtfully designed and cool spot to spend a few nights while in town for work. The neighborhood is very easy to park, the cottage has privacy being separate from the house, but still just a few steps away from your host should you need anything. Tracy had great communication with me throughout, left helpful suggestions for dining, and her sweet outdoor cat greeted me in the morning."
6153532,44923877,2015-08-30,6946766,Erica,"Thanks Tracy, what a great spot you created there! Tastefully and comfortably decorated, and immaculately clean. It felt like we were staying in a one-room boutique hotel. 

Neighborhood is really cute, too - we loved getting breakfast at the Fat Hen (pleasant walk away), dinner at Brimmer & Heeltap (short bus ride), pizza at Delancey (walk) and cocktails at its awesome adjoining bar Essex!

6153532,45396442,2015-09-02,15600337,Ian,"Tracy is my wife's new design guru! Every element of the space was carefully thought out. It felt like a modern, luxurious hotel room. Supplies were well stocked and she was her own maitre'd providing a detailed list of places to go eat, drink and be merry."
6153532,46127013,2015-09-08,27957732,Ava,"We were in Seattle for a wedding close by this cottage (the Zoo!)  This was the perfect spot to get easily everywhere we needed to be.  The decor is gorgeous, it is equipped with everything you would need and was quiet and private.  I highly recommend it!!!"
6153532,46885245,2015-09-14,38288085,Robert,"We arrived late, and getting into our cozy quarters was set up so as to be a snap. Tracy is a fabulous hostess. She respected our privacy. She discreetly inquired about any needs we might have, and met them in a flash. She could not have been more welcoming, personable, or cheerful. 
The neighborhood, Ballard, can only be described as a pedestrian-and-family-friendly American classic. Sidewalks are everywhere. People are unbelievably friendly, and interesting. Neighborhood eateries abound within walking distance. Public transportation into the city is convenient. We will be repeat customers. Thank-you, Tracy!  --Janet & Robert, Chicago "
6153532,47689800,2015-09-21,40185931,Carol,"Tracy had great correspondence with us prior to and during our arrival and stay, and she met all of our needs and more.  She left us a list of things to do and see, and there was plenty of coffee!  The location was ideal, the neighborhood was delightful, and the accommodations were perfect.  She's made the cottage a most enjoyable memory of a special weekend in Seattle. Our first Airbnb trip was wonderful - we'll definitely do it again, and we highly recommend her cottage to future guests.  "
6153532,48915257,2015-09-29,43062820,Oliver,The cottage was great and everything was super easy and accommodating. The location was convenient for our trip and still out of the way enough to be quiet and private. Tracy has thought of everything for the cottage and I would recommend it to anyone.  
6153532,50023319,2015-10-08,16189173,Brooks,Tracy was the best experience we've ever had with AirBnb. She went above and beyond and worked with our schedule for a crazy weekend that we had. We would recommend her and her cute little place to everyone who wants to visit Seattle. 
6153532,50776258,2015-10-14,16755324,Anne,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The description and pictures were completely accurate, and Tracy answered all our questions promptly. She greeted us after we arrived and did everything she coukd to make us feel welcome. "
6153532,52141428,2015-10-26,19911395,Alan,"   The cottage is beautiful and very comfortable.  Many amenities not listed were provided such as; a hair drier, iron and ironing board, and wine opener, shampoo and toothpaste. I loved the industrial chic decor, and the bed was very comfortable with very nice bedding.  We walked to dinner and drinks on two of the nights, and breakfast one day.  It was nice to be within walking distance of so many great places. Tracy was out of town, but responded quickly to any  correspondence from us via text.  We will definitely stay here again!"
6153532,54167870,2015-11-16,10263471,Brendan,"Great place, quiet residential neighborhood, not too far from lots of nice spots on the north side of the city. Probably not the best spot for someone looking for a bustling urban experience, but a great base for exploring Ballard, Greenlake, Phinney Ridge, Wallingford, Fremont. 

Studio is cozy, clean, extremely comfortable. Private and tucked away."
6153532,55217550,2015-11-29,20178440,Elsa,"We loved staying at this adorable studio.  The space was exactly as depicted in the listing- very modern and cozy.  Tracy's cottage appears to be a re-purposed portion of a garage.  It was designed beautifully, but was a bit cold given the concrete floors and wooden ceiling with no insulation.  This was our first trip to Seattle, so we were out exploring most of our trip.  The neighborhood is very residential and public transit in Seattle is not the best, and because we didn't have a car, we took Ubers to most places.  We would stay here again!"
6153532,57542512,2015-12-27,48703694,Eric,"Tracy was a charming host and treated us to OJ and sparkling wine, very nice on the holidays. The cottage is charming, clean, quiet and comfortable. And the neighborhood is up and coming Ballard trendy, very fun."
23919,72556,2010-08-02,16549,Paul,"Peggy has a wonderful small apt. It is just perfect for a couple. The bed is comfortable, the kitchen appliances are new and work well. The house is in a quite neighbor with very little traffic. Ms. Coats has thoughtfully has provided bus routes, ferry schedules and local dining information. I would highly reccommend her apt for a couple that wanted a peaceful getaway."
23919,462218,2011-08-21,698684,Han,"This is a lovely apartment for a stay in Seattle, just away from the busy districts and down town, but close enough to visit all sites without much traveling.  We particularly enjoyed the apartment itself with its careful eye for details (travel guides, cooking essentials like olive oil, butter etc, and art on the wall) and wonderful terrace for outdoor enjoyment.  Great place to stay."
23919,16255391,2014-07-24,2212384,LeAnn,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Treehouse guest cottage.  The view of the tree, a Cedar Deodora, is lovely and the garden is also very beautiful. The hosts are  friendly and the location is convenient for reaching the Burke Gilman bike trail and the bus line.  The cats, Angus and Delilah are fun to watch as they try to protect the premises from ""The Squirrel"" .The bath has an elegant Jacuzzi and  all in all it was a very nice stay. Also you should note the statues in the cottage as they were made by the owner and are very nice."
23919,23526015,2014-12-03,22415504,Shere,"The Tree House Cottage. OH MY! We felt at home and cared for during our stay. Every thing we could have wanted was provided for.

And. Thank you so much for allowing our dear Baker (canine) to stay also.

This was a special moment in our lives. The birth of our first grand daughter! It was so nice to rest comfortably in a soft bed after spending long days holding and loving her.

The construction inside and outside was perfect. The place is beautiful, quiet and charming.

Peggy, 
You are a beautiful soul! We will be back.
In most sincerity,
Jayson and Shere

23919,30907298,2015-04-28,4252264,Matt,"Cottage was mega clean and inviting. Easy to find and great location. Towels, linens and toiletries were stocked and fresh - and there was even a few nice things to eat in the fridge. Would highly recommend."
23919,45054575,2015-08-31,9565049,Elizabeth,"Peggy had everything beautifully prepared, including two delicious local peaches, impeccable cleanliness, and timely contact with me to solidify arrangements.  In all,  a super satisfying experience.  The cottage was lovely, perfectly outfitted with everything we needed.  We did not have a chance to meet Peggy,  but we felt the care and pride she took in taking care of her cottage and her guests."
522287,1512440,2012-06-18,1394440,Tai,"Where do I even start? Roger is a beautiful, thoughtful and intelligent being! With a wonderful clean, cozy house that is perfectly situated in Fremont. Close to everything and easy parking. I felt completely comfortable in Rogers house and in his presence, and really if I was about 20 years older I may have never left! I feel I have made a true friend!! "
522287,1571646,2012-06-26,1455597,Matthias,"Roger was a wonderful host and made us feel right at home. He is extremely knowledgeable about Seattle and the Northwest and had many valuable recommendations for us. He was very helpful and always available for questions or a quick chat - Roger made our stay personal while at the same time giving us all the privacy we wanted. The house is cute and cozy, the room clean and the bed comfortable - and the Wallingford location is a great starting point to explore Seattle. It's a short walk to lively Fremont, and there are several buses nearby that take you just about anywhere in the city. We would definitely stay there again!"
522287,1617732,2012-07-02,2761070,Caroline,"We had a great time! Roger was very nice and laid-back, and everything worked out perfectly. The house is very cozy and comfortable with everything you need for casual stay in Seattle. Great location, too! It's really easy to get to, but close to all the best neighborhood haunts but not too far from downtown. I highly recommend this place! "
522287,1668037,2012-07-09,2688107,Huilin,"Highly recommend this amazing house!! Roger is very friendly and nicely prepared everything we needed. He gave me lots of advice to help us plan our trip. It is a very special experience to stay in an artist's house. Lots of great pics and previous glass works made by him made us feel like staying in an art museum!! And visiting his studio was fun too. Without him, I don't think we can make an access to local art culture or folk culture. I will definitely choose this place again next time my boyfriend comes to see me.  "
522287,1822325,2012-07-28,368261,Kate,I stayed with Roger for one week in July and absolutely loved it. He was so nice and welcoming. The room was really clean and in a great location. Truly enjoyed my stay!
522287,1845489,2012-07-30,2985857,Kara & Fred,"The house itself was very clean, spacious, and simple, and the room itself was also nice, I loved both of them. But the highlight of staying with Roger is Roger himself, who was extremely kind, helpful, and generous, perfectly balancing hospitality and privacy. It was my first time using airbnb, and it completely sold me on the whole experience!

(reviewed by Fred, Kara's husband)"
522287,1852271,2012-07-31,2599502,Bobby,"Myself and a friend stayed one night at Roger's house in Fremont after hiking the North Cascades.  Roger is an exellent host, his home is in a fun, centrally located area and I have nothing but great things to say about my experience. I am sure I will be in touch with Roger when I visit again.  If you need a place to stay in Seattle, in a great neighborhood, contact Roger!"
522287,1865097,2012-08-01,390774,Dimitris,"Charming little house with everything you need to feel comfortable. It is located in a safe neighborhood at a short (10 to 15 min) walk from Fremont avenue and in close proximity to buses for downtown. Most important though, a wonderfully friendly and considerate host, Roger, who will chat with you (should you so desire) and ensure you have all you need for a good stay."
522287,1928232,2012-08-08,3083756,Alison,"Roger was a great host. He made my friend and me feel very at home. The house is located in a sweet location, within walking distance to downtown Fremont, and dangerously close to the thirst-quenching Fremont Brewery. Roger graciously shared information about Seattle and kindly showed us some interesting local spots. "
522287,1964190,2012-08-12,3197708,Shauna,"Roger was great - he himself was great for getting a feeling for the culture and the people in the city as a long-time resident, and he was a great tour  planner for a solo traveler - free of charge! ;) The accommodations were cozy and comfy and the neighborhood easy to move around in. I only wish I'd gotten to his place sooner!"
522287,1987182,2012-08-14,3119147,Sinead,Lovely house and room.  Roger was incredibly friendly and came with great recommendations of things to do (and eat!) that would have been missed otherwise.  We had a great visit to Seattle and would definitely return!
522287,2169922,2012-09-02,593078,Emmanuel,"Roger is a great host. Generous, open, welcoming and fun. I highly recommend.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and I'll visit again the next time I am in Seattle."
522287,2382822,2012-09-23,3398560,Chris,"Excellent host, comfortable and quiet place to stay. Roger is generous and helpful. It was perfect for me for this trip and would absolutely recommend to others."
522287,2410972,2012-09-25,3250071,Karina,"Roger is such a friendly person. It's true he'll give you a tour of the area if you so desire. And the area is beautiful: parks, coffee shops, etc. The house is clean and I slept soundly in the comfortable, quiet room. Roger is also an accomplished artist. I also visited his glass workshop. Very inspiring. "
522287,2542455,2012-10-08,3572926,Zhihao,"Good place, easy to go to downtown of seattle by public transit.
Roger is very nice. 
The living condition is quiet good, without any problem.
I really recommend this place.
"
522287,2657988,2012-10-19,619805,Stefan,"It was great staying with Roger, he is a great guy, and a very fine person. He immediately made me feel at home, and even took me on two nice walks around Greenwood Lake. I would have liked to stay longer!"
522287,2705575,2012-10-24,246165,Lee,"Roger is an interesting, genuine, calm, trusting person, and an artist to boot.  We are of a similar age and outlook, and so we got along splendidly, but I suspect Roger gets along splendidly with most.  The room has a comfortable bed, a small desk with WiFi and a closet -- all one needs."
522287,2752639,2012-10-29,3787624,Johanna,I had a very pleasant stay at Roger's place. I was there just to sleep as I was in for a quick weekend of long work days. Very comfortable lodgings in a cute neighborhood. Roger was very helpful and made my stay very smooth. 
522287,2833719,2012-11-07,75605,Steve,"Roger was exceedingly generous and open with us (my girlfriend and I.)   The house is charming, simple and clean.   High marks for the french toast and berries he offered us one morning!  Roger strikes a balance of privacy and social manner.  

I've made a friend through the experience.  "
522287,2861668,2012-11-12,2569370,Justin,Roger is a gracious and generous host. I got into town late on a Thursday night and stayed at Roger's without a vehicle. I asked Roger where the nearest grocery was and he gave me a ride there! Things goes well beyond what I expected. I felt as if I were staying at the home of an old friend rather than that of a person I had not previously met. Should the need arise for to be in Seattle overnight again in the future this would be the first place I'll look.
522287,2909124,2012-11-18,10143,Hillary,Very comfortable bed… felt at home there even without meeting Roger… his friends were there and took care of everything perfectly.
522287,3160619,2012-12-26,404429,Wes,Great place to stay.  Roger was friendly and we had numerous enjoyable conversations in a one day time period.
522287,3165302,2012-12-27,1881355,James,Roger was very patient with our late check in which I am very grateful for.  He took the time to get to know us and he shared a little about his life with us.   He provided coffee and bread even when we didn't  expect it.  The good stuff too!!
522287,3305578,2013-01-07,390774,Dimitris,"Second time at Roger's everything was easy. This time we missed him since he was out of town but the arrangements for the delivery of the key were seamless. Thus we had the place to ourselves. Will keep coming back to this most pleasant, well located place"
522287,3389538,2013-01-21,2937500,Vince,"Super convenient, great location for a night out in fremont, and Roger is a cool guy."
522287,3460678,2013-02-02,4766628,John,"Roger was friendly, accommodating, and went out of his way to help me navigate the area on foot.  Once he knew some of my special interests he gave me a couple of tips that immensely benefited my stay in Seattle.  He is very honest, straightforward and reasonable as a host.   D4efinitely a good stay, and the very comfortable bed gave me a good night's sleep.  'm in my late 60s and  had no trouble with the stairs; but I know that a lot of my peers do have knee problems and if that is an issue for you, I suggest that you discuss iwth Roger before making a final commitment."
522287,3621328,2013-02-26,4808368,Mike,Roger was friendly and attentive.  I would recommend him to my friends. His location is especially nice if you are spending time in the Fremont area as we did. 
522287,3750016,2013-03-11,3895791,Paola,"Well, as my first Airbnb experience I couldn't have wished for anything better. I was in Seattle for an intensive 3-day workshop, and Roger's place offered both the warmth of ""coming home"" and the privacy of feeling in your own place.  Roger himself is an attentive, accommodating,  and engaging host, and you may just find yourself with a new friend by the end of your stay. The neighborhood is great for walking and safe, as well as convenient for public transportation: downtown is only a 15-min. bus ride away."
522287,3794020,2013-03-15,5438184,Andrea,Roger was very welcoming and the room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely recommend. 
522287,3883143,2013-03-24,5025664,Ramey,"Roger's place was a great place to stay. I just had a quick nights stay, but it was perfect for that! "
522287,3902249,2013-03-25,4670602,Ryan,Roger was a gracious host. I had a pleasant experience in the 1911 house. The quarters were comfortable and the atmosphere was welcoming. I would definitely stay there again the next time I am in the area.
522287,4123380,2013-04-11,5851486,Jonathan,This was my first Airbnb experience so Inwas a little nervous not knowing what to expect. Once I got to the house all that went away. Roger was a very gracious host. He gave me a quick tour of the house and where I could find everything I needed. He was also very willing to share key places to visit while in Seattle. If I ever find myself back in the area I would definitely stay here again. 
522287,4168769,2013-04-15,5691927,Ian,"Roger was a great host. He took the time to give me an informal tour of the neighborhood, which is chock full of restaurants and close by to the University of Washington. The room and house had a lot of character and were well kept. Overall I enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend."
522287,4276847,2013-04-23,5946531,Brad,This is a great little spot. Cozy and close to the fun and relaxed neighborhood of Freemont and just a single city bus from downtown Seattle. Roger was away the weekend I stayed but everything worked out very smooth and comfortably. Recommended. 
522287,4285821,2013-04-24,65464,Marianne,"Wonderful, wonderful little house and most generous and considerate - and organized - host. I would recommend it for its warmth, its great coffee supply, the comfort of the upstairs bed and its great location in Wallingford near Fremont and convenient bus lines. Super generous host with really calm and peaceful house. Thanks!"
522287,4433521,2013-05-05,162422,Rosemary,"I had a very pleasant one week stay at Roger's comfortable home in the quiet and well-located Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle, and I highly recommend it.  Roger was out of town when I arrived, but he arranged for his friend Susie to meet me at the house.  She was friendly and helpful, and took time to tell me about different things I might enjoy while I was in town on vacation.  Roger returned to Seattle at the end of my week in town, and it was good to meet him.  I appreciate his hospitality, and I am glad that he was willing to share his home for my first trip to Seattle.   Thanks,  Roger!"
522287,4487412,2013-05-07,1213025,Melissa,Roger was extremely accommodating as we booked a room the day of our visit to Seattle ( extremely last minute).He recommended some great restaurants and was a pleasure to talk to! The neighborhood is one of our favorites in Seattle. Rogers's house is charming and quite comfortable. 
522287,4605467,2013-05-14,6146802,Stephan,"Roger was friendly and very readily accessible. When I wanted the wireless internet access code, I simply texted him and he replied promptly. Room & amenities were clean."
522287,4643303,2013-05-17,6071202,Edward,"Had a great time. 
Roger was a great guy to chat with and I really enjoyed my time.
He was a fantastic host, and made me very welcome in his homely house.
Perfect location and a great neighborhood."
522287,4691059,2013-05-20,2927940,Carrie,"Roger was a great host and very easy to coordinate with on my visit.  He was very helpful and courteous host, and great to share conversation with!"
522287,4817514,2013-05-27,380034,Stephen,"Roger was a great host, interesting guy and a pleasure to be around. I spent very little time at the house, but the location was great and the bedroom functioned just fine. The place was clean with space available in a dresser and closed. Internet worked perfect. Bed was comfortable and warm. All in all Roger's place provides visitors with an excellent Seattle experience"
522287,4841688,2013-05-28,3597702,Joseph,"We had just a short stay here but it was perfect for our needs. The place is walking distance to some great Seattle neighborhoods. 

Roger was very welcoming and a great host. "
522287,4910345,2013-06-01,5008344,Ben,"I stayed in Roger's guest bedroom for three nights.  It's homey -- not a fancy hotel-room feeling, but as though you're staying with a friend (which you are while you're there -- Roger is great).  Everything was tidy and clean.  It's a pleasant 30-minute walk from UW campus and there's a bus stop nearby.  I'd choose Roger's place again!"
522287,4971758,2013-06-04,1453199,Christine,"My grandson and I spent three nights at Roger's wonderful house and garden, I in the upstairs bedroom and my grandson on the porch.  Both were clean and comfortable.  I enjoyed making coffee in his meticulous kitchen in the morning and chatting about what to do for the day.  At Roger's suggestion, we toured both the Flight Museum and the Boeing factory, both big hits with a fourteen year old. It's a great price for a homey stay at a home away from home."
522287,5094505,2013-06-11,850221,Lori Michele,"Roger's place was in a perfect location, close to where I needed to be, clean and quiet. Roger is a gracious host and an excellent person.  I highly recommend staying with Roger.  "
522287,5110255,2013-06-12,5553545,Yvonne,"I had just a short stay here but it was perfect for my needs.  Roger is a wonderful host and his place is in a great location!  House infused artistic touches create a harmonized charm, my cup of tea!!"
522287,5204465,2013-06-18,5141529,Nancy,"It was great to meet Roger and to stay at his lovely place. It was very conveniently located. Being artists, Roger and I had a lot in common and we hit it off right away. I would come back again."
522287,5286659,2013-06-22,6950125,Greg,"Roger  is a thoughtful, organized person.  It shows in his home and his caring attitude towards his guests.  We didn't personally meet during my 3 night stay, because of different schedules, but I feel that I know quite a bit about him.  

His 1910 vintage home is well kept and very convenient to Seattle activities.  I'd recommend staying here if you need a simple, stylish home away from home!"
522287,5345614,2013-06-25,2380298,Yves,"Very nice stay at Roger's. Interesting, quiet and friendly neighbourhood. Roger's passion for the Japanese culture was good to hear and share. The Fremont Solstice Festival is a must event to attend in that city. Thank you for your company !"
522287,5467426,2013-07-01,2650165,Deborah,"This was our first time booking a private room rather than an entire apt on Airbnb, and it turned out to be one of our best stays yet! Roger was very easy to coordinate with and fun to talk to. We very much enjoyed hanging out with him on the porch and talking about traveling, his work and life in Seattle. We wished we could have stayed longer and look forward to staying with him again next time we visit Seattle."
522287,5610843,2013-07-08,6826120,Eleanor,"I came into town a few days before a convention; as a previous Seattle resident I wanted to stay in a place that was located near some of the many wonderful neighborhoods the city has to offer. Roger is a gracious and kindly host, directing me to the choicest place for latte's and Vietnamese pastries, and ensuring I was both oriented to the area and comfortable in his home. The house is comfy, quaint and makes one immediately feel as if they are visiting an old friend. He made me a latte, offered up a few snacks and we chatted on the front porch for a time before I set off for a short jaunt over to the main Fremont area. I will absolutely stay here again on my next visit; I deeply appreciate Roger opening up his home to travelers. He also is a marvelous glassblower - it just so happened that the hotel I stayed in for the convention downtown has a wonderful and enormous art installation of his directly in the lobby - so check out the Grand Hyatt! Lovely time, highly recommended. "
522287,5653757,2013-07-09,29918,Torr,"Roger was kind enough to quickly respond to our inquiry for a single night in Seattle. He was hospitable, kind, open and accommodating. Highly recommend."
522287,5710606,2013-07-13,5820436,Patrick,My stay with Roger was restful.  He is quiet but also open for a little conversation.  From his place I walked down to Gas Light park for dinner one night.  The home is clean and well represented on the airbnb site.  I'd recommend a stay with Roger.
522287,5802835,2013-07-16,3097447,Karina,Roger is an amazing host.  We had lots in common and enjoyed visiting with him.  His house is very cute and conveniently located.  We hope to stay with him again sometime.
522287,5831111,2013-07-18,7111270,Benjamin,Roger was the PERFECT host. We stayed two day in his very nice House and he actually took a day off and showed us around Seattle! This was absolutely amazing! He is the nicest guy you can imagine. The neighbourhood is really lovely and he can point you to all the best spots and food. If you stay in Seattle and stay anywhere else you fail at AirBnB. I would give six stars if I could.
522287,5883762,2013-07-21,2108557,Susan,"Roger was a superb host. He was very knowledgeable of the area and gave us great tips. He was kind, warm and welcoming. I'd return in a heartbeat! Thank you very much, Roger."
522287,5944267,2013-07-23,6121800,Lucy,"We had a wonderful, relaxing two-night stay with Roger, who could not have been a more welcoming and accomodating host! The location is wonderful for exploring Fremont, which has plenty of good places to eat, and hosts Theo's chocolate factory (which runs a great tour as well). Highly recommended, would definitely stay here again!"
522287,5997209,2013-07-25,7218901,Simone,Roger is a congenial fellow and nice host.  He made sure I had everything I needed.  I had a pleasant stay.
522287,6037400,2013-07-27,7626484,Aman,Roger is a great host. We enjoyed his company
522287,6077310,2013-07-29,6941097,Ricky,Roger is a kind holder. He could offer guests a lot of helps. And the room is very comfortable. The location is very convenient for traveller
522287,6136627,2013-07-31,2478813,Ioanna,"Roger was very friendly and welcoming, we very much enjoyed our stay, thanks! "
522287,6304398,2013-08-07,6935079,Diane,Roger's house is in a very nice area and very close to buses which was great. It was very easy and quick to get into the city and other places. The house is lovely with lots of art works around and the beds were comfortable. Roger was flexible in letting us use the sunroom as well which we really appreciated. He was also helpful in providing maps and transport information and trusting in that he left us in the house while he went on holiday. It was also good to be in an area of the city that was familiar to me and we had a good time there.
522287,6373065,2013-08-10,5823305,Abi,"Roger was away during our stay, but was super-helpful and friendly in all our communications. This house is in a lovely neighbourhood, close to restaurants and to Downtown. Very welcoming and comfortable. We would definitely return."

522287,6977096,2013-09-01,8437884,Rick,"My wife and I wanted a short getaway to Seattle. However, this time we were looking to venture out of downtown and experience the neighbourhoods. It only seemed natural to book a place through airbnb for a more local experience. We were not disappointed with any of our arrangements, this being the first time using airbnb.

Roger was very hospitable and welcoming, taking the time to show us where everything was that we might need, and ready with suggestions as to what we might see or do. He made us feel right at home.

The historic house is tastefully decorated with Roger's art and that of his friends. Be sure to take some time to appreciate it. Note that there are shared living arrangements. However, we did not find this to be an inconvenience, nor an encroachment on our privacy. 

Our experience with Roger was like visiting a relative. If we have the chance to stay with him again, we will definitely plan a longer visit. "
522287,7010873,2013-09-03,7307800,Kimberly,This was our first time using airbnb so we were not sure what to expect. Roger made us feel right at home. His 1911 home is filled with character. The location and proximity to a main bus line made travelling to Seattle effortless. We were very pleased with our stay and have already told Roger that we will be back!
522287,7072999,2013-09-05,8060362,Christian,"Un hôte extrêmement gentil et prévenant, n'hésitant pas à nous faire visiter sa ville. Un lieu que nous recommandons chaudement"

522287,7507453,2013-09-23,208111,Rob,"Roger's home is clean, comfortable and well-located in Freemont-Wallingford.  He's a relaxed,knowledgeable and helpful host, and graciously accommodated our (preplanned) late arrival.  Would happily return."

He has a nice flow at the house so it makes you feel comfortable.
Totally recommended! 
Thanks Roger!!!"
522287,7795910,2013-10-03,196804,Donna,"Roger's  home was just perfect for my trip to visit my son and his family. As  Roger was away I had his lovely cottage to myself. The bed was very comfortable and the artsy decor wAs nice to come home to. The location within a short walk to all the trendy restaurants in Fremont was great. I also appreciated that this home is not on top if a hill!
I would definitely plan to stay here again if it's available on my next visit.  
Donna"
522287,7923201,2013-10-08,8695015,Sharon,"Lovely bachelor pad, very clean and comfy. 2 blocks from the bus to downtown ( a 15- 20 min ride) and in a quiet neighborhood. I did not get to meet Roger as he was away, but he made sure I had everything I needed.
A great bargain!"
522287,8030706,2013-10-13,9195500,Berry,"I had a comfortable stay (though short) in this charming home. Roger is kind and welcoming and I felt right at home. We had opposite schedules, so I only talked to Roger briefly in the evening. He made sure I had everything I needed. The house is welcoming and clean. Street parking was available. I didn't use public transportation this time as I was dropping off things at my son's dorm at UW, just a short ride away. If available, I will stay here again and then hopefully get to know Roger and the neighborhood. "
522287,8223534,2013-10-21,9036567,Kate,"Roger's home was awesome and even though he wasn't in town during my stay, he was a courteous host and I felt very well taken care of. He left me notes about the house to make it easy to figure things out, and he even ensured that there was coffee for me to make in the morning!

The home itself was quaint, warm and cozy. I loved staying at Roger's home and I will book it again in a heartbeat.

Thanks Roger!

522287,8316594,2013-10-25,8629199,Carol,I was only in town for 24 hours for an interview at Seattle Children's so really just needed a place to day. Roger's was perfect. The home is well kept and the bed was comfortable to sleep on. Sadly I only got to meet Roger on my way out the door in the morning - he seemed very nice however and I would definitely stay again. The location is great - just a couple of blocks from the restaurants in Wallingford - had a fabulous meal at Tilthe - and then took the bus through UW to Seattle Children's. Also took the train/bus from the airport (1.5h time). 
522287,8410949,2013-10-29,9127540,Ann,"Roger provides a clean, well-organized, and friendly environment. We had a great stay. Thank you, Roger! We'll come again."
522287,8436444,2013-10-30,8021,Becky,"I stayed at 1911 Wallingford/Fremont house while on a trip to Seattle to interview and consequently decide if i want to move there.  It was very helpful to be in an actual neighborhood for a night to get a more realistic feel for the city.  

Roger was very helpful in directing me to the best coffee and exploration places nearby.  He had preprinted day trip ideas and had maps and brochures for the city.  He also went above and beyond by offering me a home made Latte to take with me the following day… so thoughtful!"
522287,8488447,2013-11-02,8736911,David,This is my second stay with Roger so I'll be brief. He's a great host and the place is really well located. 
522287,8545702,2013-11-04,9621188,Majken,"Tidy and clean place. Roger was very responsive and friendly. Walking distance to restaurants. Though we didn't see any cats at the home, we did have reaction to cat dander. It wasn't a problem for just one night, but worth knowing in case you're sensitive."
522287,8754238,2013-11-16,8736911,David,Staying with Roger for the 3rd or 4th time. He must be doing something right.
522287,8786076,2013-11-18,8138208,Alonzo,"My stay was amazing! Roger was out of town while I was there but he accommodated me so nicely that it was hard to tell! The communication was clear and concise. He wrote little messages all over the house that were super detailed and helpful. His house is very homey and walking distance from restaurants, bars, grocery, pretty much anything! If you havent gotten it yet, I was very pleased with the hospitality and location! Definitely would stay with Roger again, and hopefully next time I'll get to meet the man behind the amazingness!
 "
522287,9103065,2013-12-07,2401838,Emma,"Roger was very accommodating - I had to check in a lot later than originally planned but Roger was flexible with the last minute change. I was only in for a very short visit, but Roger made sure that it was pleasant and comfortable. It was the perfect set-up for what I needed!"
522287,9357798,2013-12-23,10635236,Jackson,Roger is super friendly and if u r travel with small family or less than 4 person than it is a great place to stay. Roger is very a very nice person even bought fancy donut for our breakfast recommend the place for who wants to stay in Seattle. 
522287,9529689,2014-01-01,10703453,Mike,"This was my first time using Airbnb and being in Seattle - I had a wonderful time. Roger was an excellent host, he handled my stay professionally. He was friendly, cordial and punctual. He has intricate knowledge of the area that he willingly shared. 

His house is at a great part of town, it's right by a bus stop which goes directly downtown in about 10 minutes (for those not renting a car in Seattle - which is totally doable). It's also about a mile away from the UW campus. My favorite part about his location is that it's right by Green Lake - I jogged every morning around that absolutely stunning track. 

Overall I recommend this location for those visiting Seattle. I had a great time with this accommodation and I'm sure you will too. "
522287,9579374,2014-01-02,1715759,Adrianne,"Roger was a helpful, hospitable, and thorough host! We stayed in his very cool studio and it had everything we needed and more -across the street from public transport, 2.5 baths, kitchen, portable heaters and refreshments all supplemented our quick but comfy stay! Accessibility was primary and we enjoyed that everything we needed was within reach. "
522287,9928924,2014-01-20,9271360,Khalil,"Roger's house was very nice any cozy. I must say I wish I could meet him in person. That's one of the reasons I book my place through Airbnb.However his notes are going to be your friends. They are everywhere telling you exactly what to do. I was amazed by how nice and clean the whole house was. The neighborhood is nice and clean too.
I totally recommend staying at Roger's place.
I want to thank him for supporting me and answering my questions along the way and very quickly."
522287,10171920,2014-02-03,348836,Sacha,Roger's place was exactly as advertised. Good location (a 15-20 min. walk from Fremont shops) and very homey. 
522287,10286105,2014-02-10,4367226,Shane,"Roger's place was great. It was warm, cozy, and clean. I found the bed to be extremely comfortable. I didn't have the pleasure of meeting Roger, but he had notes everywhere, so it was almost like he was there. I couldn't have asked for a nicer, smoother stay. Thank you Roger."
522287,10415573,2014-02-17,9464556,Gail,"My friend Sarah and I stayed at Roger's house. We did not get to meet him, as he was traveling, but he communicated well with us online and gave good instructions regarding where to find keys, towels, etc. We found the house quite cozy. It is an old house with good karma sandwiched in between two apartment buildings."
522287,10549525,2014-02-24,8040131,Justin,"Great little house. Stayed in the laundry/sun room and it was comfortable, especially with the little heater provided."
522287,10700089,2014-03-03,12420707,Susan,Darling little house in a lovely neighborhood.  Roger wasn't there but left directions for everything.

522287,11498097,2014-04-05,11083172,Todd,Roger was a wonderful and accommodating host. It was great to sit down and play a bit of guitar with Roger at his place. Its a great location and a quaint house. Cheers Roger!
522287,11627653,2014-04-09,13758373,Janet,"My daughter and I stayed at Roger's airbnb for 3 enjoyable nights. At first, my 18yo daughter thought that this would be ""awkward"". Once we found our way to his conveniently located house she was ok with the situation. Roger was very inviting and informative. He was a wealth of info for us clueless newbees to Seattle. The house was close enough to UW for us to walk to/from numerous times. and also, located in a safe and charming area of Seattle. If UW is her choice, we will be back!! Thank you Roger for the morning Lattes!!! "
522287,11868890,2014-04-17,13620567,Jane,"Roger's place in Wallingford was the perfect place for me while visiting my son in Seattle. It was calm and peaceful start and finish surrounding some pretty busy and hectic days. A friend was able to visit for a night from Portland and was very comfortable on the twin bed in the sunroom. The bed upstairs was just as comfy as everyone says it is. We were fortunate Roger was around during most of my/our stay and we enjoyed many conversations. It was miraculously sunny for three entire days at the beginning of my visit and the front deck was the perfect place for a relaxing cup of coffee prior to the day's activities. Thanks for the lattes Roger. The garden behind the house was private, cozy and just beginning to burst into spring growth. I could not have chosen a  more beautiful time to visit Seattle as all the trees and tulips and many other flowers were in full bloom. It was gorgeous! 
I had a car Sat-Mon and parking was always available within a few doors of the house. I returned the car at the end of the weekend and used mass transit for the rest of my visit. The house in Wallingford was very accessible with multiple lines running within 2-6 blocks away. After climbing almost 300 steps straight up at a stop near my son's apartment in another area of town, I appreciated the accessibility in Wallingford even more. I also appreciated a soak in the tub-no sore muscles! 
I was fortunate to get a host-lead tour of neighboring Fremont prior to the end of my stay. I saw many things I would have otherwise missed with many remaining to be seen on my next visit. Before you leave the house, be sure to check out Roger’s handmade glass bug collection (read the names) and play a few tunes on the guitar if you get the chance.
I definitely recommend staying here. It's clean, relaxed, comfy and cozy, and convenient."
522287,12186121,2014-04-25,13771589,Reed,Roger was a perfect host.  He is very personable and his home is comfortable.  It is a great location with easy access to all of Seattle.  This was an ideal way to start my Airbnb experience.
522287,13683810,2014-06-02,14943776,Chris,"This was my first time using Airbnb so I did not know what to expect at first. However, Roger was very welcoming and made me feel right at home. His house is in a nice quiet neighborhood but has plenty of resources nearby: restaurants, groceries, and even the zoo! Over the weekends, Roger always had great recommendations of where to visit in Seattle and I had fun exploring the area around Wallingford. I'm glad my first experience with Airbnb went well and, thanks to Roger, hope to visit more places while staying through Airbnb hosts."
522287,13903229,2014-06-07,2569771,New,"Had a nice stay. Roger was welcoming and helpful, but at the same time gave you your space and privacy.

522287,14091574,2014-06-11,15399298,Elizabeth,"The house is perfect and Roger is a very nice host. He picked me up at the airport, introducing the city to me on the way. It's really kind of him. The house is very quiet at night and it's also very convenient to go anywhere I wanna go, the bus stop is just five minutes' walk. An excellent place in this beautiful city."
522287,14176746,2014-06-13,9271060,Eva,Roger was great and the house in Wallingford was clean and cozy. Recommended.

I felt comfortable instantly,  walking in to Roger's unique, not fancy but artful, thoughtfully appointed, clean little neighborhood home. Roger is generous and helpful, but never did I feel he intruded into my need for privacy. I wish I had had more time to explore, but it was the perfect little stop along the way with a great breakfast place within walking distance."
522287,14939790,2014-06-29,17208902,Peter,"I was only there one night, but Roger was very accommodating. Fresh towels, sheets, great directions to get me to the wedding I was heading to and a french press ready for me in the morning. Highly recommended!"
522287,15245898,2014-07-05,832997,Jackie,Great stay at Roger's! He was incredibly understanding and helpful when my flight landed 4 hours late and I arrived after midnight. The room and bathroom were spotless and comfortable.
522287,15409825,2014-07-08,15053988,Mary,"Roger was a great host, and he has a beautiful little home.  Communication was flawless, check -in and out were a breeze, and he had GREAT dinner suggestions for us on arrival.  The home is in a nice area, parking is very easy, and everything is accessable by nearby public transportation as well.  I would definitely recommend staying here, and I would stay again if I returned to the area."
522287,15484022,2014-07-10,3556067,Alanna,"The house was perfectly relaxing after a long journey, cool and shady on a hot summer afternoon and comfortably furnished. Roger had opened our bedroom window and provided a fan as the weather was quite hot, we loved the house and the neighbourhood, we wish we could have stayed a bit longer!"
522287,15600539,2014-07-12,7884735,Julia,"Roger made me feel very welcome into his home, which has a fabulous location right near Fremont (about a fifteen minute walk). I loved the free coffee, tea, milk and OJ. The room was small, but very comfortable and perfectly fit out needs. Roger was extraordinarily friendly and helpful and we had several wonderful conversations. Highly recommended!"
522287,15663174,2014-07-13,1786717,Alejandro,"Roger was great. The room was neat and just as expected. Since it was a hot day, he left a fan on to cool the room, which was a nice gesture. He was also very easy to get a hold of, and he even lent me an iPhone charger while I was there. I totally recommend staying with him!"
522287,15913010,2014-07-18,15744132,Michelle,"We both really enjoyed staying with Roger during our time in Seattle. Roger's house, the rented room, the location, and the amenities were exactly as described. Roger was busy with some personal things during our stay, so we did not cross paths that frequently. Nonetheless, Roger was always very pleasant, friendly, and agreeable, and gave us excellent suggestions for places for to visit that matched out interests. We felt very comfortable staying at Roger's home, even with additional guests renting the sunroom. We used public transportation during our time in Seattle and it was easy to access multiple bus routes close to Roger's home. If you are looking for a cozy place for one or two people to stay, in a accessible Seattle neighbourhood, and with a very friendly and professional host, we would highly recommend booking with Roger. 

-Michelle and Noah "
522287,16108576,2014-07-22,16869437,Patrick,"Really enjoyed staying at Roger's house. It was very clean and comfortable and he was extremely friendly, welcoming, and very communicative. The location is also great! I recommend walking around Fremont while you're there. It was easy to find street parking and Roger was very helpful giving us tips on where to park downtown Seattle. We would highly recommend staying here if you need a convenient and comfortable location near downtown Seattle!"
522287,16475602,2014-07-28,16791937,Donna,"We felt very welcome in Rogers home.  The description provide was accurate.  Rogers directions were clear, it was an easy find.  Roger was away for the weekend, so we had his home to ourselves.  His home was the perfect spot for a weekend centered around a family baby shower.  Roger provided my two sisters and I a great list of restaurants; the very first day we ate at a Thai restaurant and had the best Pad Thai, salad and pot stickers EVER!!!  From his house we struck out on neighborhood walks which provided us with inspiring photo shots.  We explored Ballard and Greenlake Park.  We snacked on fresh blackberries in his back yard.  We could drive city streets or get onto I-5 easily.  There was a lot of laughter in Roger's house and we made memories we will not soon forget.  "
522287,16598437,2014-07-29,18877484,Douglas,"Roger's place was in a perfect location for our quick little 1-day trip up to Seattle from Portland.  He was out of town for our stay, so we did not have an opportunity to meet.  The house is cute and very clean.  It was all we expected and would use it again in the future."
522287,17175386,2014-08-08,15734667,Soochang,"I couldnt meet Roger, however it was really great time in his house. Clean, comfortable, roomy house. And Roger reply you back immediately whenever i inquire anything. Thanks. I would stay again if i have a chance."
522287,17284725,2014-08-10,4437983,Casie,"Quaint little cottage in Fremont. Nice accommodations, very well mapped out, and welcoming. Easy access to 15 min bus route directly to DT and main tourist attractions. Consider it a great location for scenic lake union walks."
522287,17939376,2014-08-19,17054167,Russell,"We didn't get to meet Roger in person but by just emailing back and forth he has made us feel so welcome in his home. Parking was always easy. In fact we seemed to always get the same spot when we'd come home in the evenings. I love the location and the feel of this neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. Hopefully next year I can come back :) thanks again for all you've done for us, Roger. "
522287,18020862,2014-08-20,18945850,Noah,"Roger's home was lovely. We arrived late and left early; however, his directions were simple and easy to follow. His house was cozy."

He had another guest staying in another room of the house each night we were there, but everyone was friendly.  We also love Wallingford!  It was nice to stay so close to great restaurants and parks."
522287,18582087,2014-08-28,20080777,Austin,This was our first airbnb experience and Roger was very helpful. Nice room and amenities. Fresh towels and a good sized outdoor space. Would definitely stay again.

Roger himself is nice and friendly."
522287,18799681,2014-09-01,16837255,David,"Roger gave us really clear instructions on how to get to his place and how to get into his place when we arrived. He wasn't sure if he would be there to greet us so he left really easy instructions. The house was exactly as described and the neighbourhood was really nice too. It is close to downtown by car. I never tried taking transit but I don't think that would've been hard since I saw buses frequently. 

We stayed for 2 nights for Bumbershoot so most of the day was spent outside. Roger has a great collection of art displayed around the house so the house has a nice atmosphere. 

He's easy to talk to and answered our questions kindly. He even gave us some nanaimo bars to share!
"
522287,18951903,2014-09-03,1102895,Derek,"This was my first Airbnb experience and Roger did a wonderful job of making my stay in his house a great experience. The bed was comfortable, the room (and the house, for that matter) was very nice. It's really close to the bus and was very easy to get to from downtown. I would absolutely recommend his place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
522287,19148460,2014-09-07,6626966,David Ivan,i had a great stay at roger's. he is a gracious host and made me feel right at home. everything was neat and clean and the house itself has a nice character. i found a good bookshop and restaurant section within walking distance (fremont) and getting to downton seattle was a breeze on the #16 bus which stops just a few blocks from the house. i will definitely stay here again when next i'm in seattle. 
522287,19293999,2014-09-09,4840827,Florian,"Roger was very helpful, he gave us a lot of great advice to explore the city. The room is very nice!"
522287,19419096,2014-09-12,2053557,Hilary,"Having hosted well over a hundred airbnb guests, this was my first as a guest myself.  Roger was a delight and his house is lovely.  I especially enjoyed my breakfasts in the hot sun on the front porch and the comfortable bed!  The location is easy to get to and the neighborhood felt safe.  I highly recommend the 1911 house in Wallingford! "
522287,19603613,2014-09-15,18983577,Peggy,Host was friendly and helpful. House was old with lots of steps.
522287,19851287,2014-09-19,7270006,Ellen,"The second-floor guest room in which I stayed was clean and of a workable size for me and my suitcase, which I laid open instead of shifting my belongings into the available closet and small dresser.  The bed was comfortable, and I slept well.  I appreciated having a desk on which I could work on my laptop.  Staying in this house does require navigating stairs, so would not be appropriate for someone with mobility impairments.  I found the neighborhood quiet at night, and did not have difficulty finding street parking, although I was not always fortunate to find a space right next to the house.  The times I spoke with my host, Roger, he seemed gracious; however, I was miffed when he phoned me while I was driving, about two hours before I was going to arrive, to let me know he'd inadvertently overbooked, so was giving up his own bedroom to a guest and sleeping at a location other than his house.  As a female traveling alone, it did concern me that I would be in the house and sharing a bathroom with two other guests, both male, and both strangers to me.  Roger vouched for their good character, and there wasn't much else I could do on short notice, so I checked in as planned.  As it played out over the three nights I stayed, I never saw the other guests.  Yet I did know I was sharing the house with men, because they always left the toilet seat up."
522287,21539653,2014-10-19,7510205,Darius,"Roger was a gracious and flexible host. The house was charming and clean, and in a great neighbourhood!"
522287,22652816,2014-11-11,21770766,Nikolaj,"Host was extremely welcoming, house was easy to find and easy to get to. Host provided all essential information to make stay comfortable and enjoyable.  House overall, room, bathroom were clean and fresh. No strange smells in the house.
Host was calm and quiet and it was very quiet in the house during all times.
Area will be perfect for someone who is looking for relaxed, quiet and easily accessible place to stay. Transportation, grocery stores, park - everything is easily within walkable distance.
And of course I would like to mention the house itself - full of character, cozy and modern at the same time.

Highly recommended place to stay.
"
522287,23935352,2014-12-14,6315418,Giulio,"This is a nice, centrally-located space near the edge of Wallingford and Fremont, two of Seattle's coolest neighborhoods. The room was comfortable, and I shared the house with one of Roger's roommates during my stay, though I didn't meet Roger himself. I was looking for a place to stay for one night and this worked out just fine. Roger also let me keep my suitcase there the next day."
522287,24290246,2014-12-24,19351289,Yuri,"The host has prepared a very cozy house for us and made us feel very welcome. The four of us felt very spacious in the house, and the additional fold-out bed upstairs was very useful. We also appreciated the glass art around the house.
The neighborhood was quiet and gorgeous. We felt very safe. The main street lay close to the house, but far enough to not be heard. Just two blocks away we could enjoy the city of downtown Seattle from the sidewalk."
522287,24697629,2015-01-01,24864481,Kezia,"Our stay at Rogers home in Fremont was short but sweet. We were kindly welcomed in to the home. It was a convenient location to parks, restaurants, and the waterfront. Alex our host was wonderful. Warm blankets and the available shared space made our short-lived stay cozy and comfortable.   "
522287,25456367,2015-01-16,22611979,Chris,Roger's place exceeded expectations. He was very responsive and the place was perfect for my needs. Thank you Roger!
522287,25729033,2015-01-24,26299345,Kim,"This house was great!  In a wonderful neighborhood with easy walking/biking access to all Wallymont has to offer.  Roger was flexible and accommodating.  He had a friend house-sitting, but the check-in and check-out process were extremely easy.  The house was clean, the bed was comfy, and we felt very lucky to have been welcomed to the area with this quintessential Seattle home!"
522287,25977474,2015-01-31,26472201,Rudolf,The place was cozy and welcoming. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet the host but his communication was fast and friendly and made me feel well looked after for the whole trip
522287,26848805,2015-02-20,7094826,Annie,"Roger explained everything perfectly true to form.  My room was ""cozy"", clean and comfortable.  It was exactly what I wanted.  I had access to the kitchen anytime and, as the bathroom is shared, all the rooms were clean.  I was so close to everything; the two neighborhoods, Wallingford and Fremont, are within walking distance and it was a joy to be able to park my car and leave it.
I hope to return to the house any time I go to visit my son, daughter-in-law, and new grandson.  Thank you, Roger, and thank you Airbnb."
522287,27799804,2015-03-12,26882485,宇野,"The house is very comfortable and clean. I feel this is located in near Seattle. In addition, host of Roger kindly corresponded. I didn't see him, but I enjoyed stay the his house.
Thank you Roger and Alex."
522287,28414573,2015-03-23,28557616,Chandalin,Roger was a very gracious host and made me feel welcome and at home immediately. He even ran late for an event to be there when I arrived so that he could greet me and show me around. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and the house blissfully quiet -  a feature I absolutely love! I stayed 3 nights and was very comfortable the entire time.
522287,28640167,2015-03-27,28841343,Jeff,Roger was very accommodating of my late night arrival.
522287,28913138,2015-03-31,29945014,Fitz,"Coming from Portland this part of town was very familiar feeling. I only saw Roger briefly, but he was very friendly and helpful!

I would certainly stay here again."
522287,29708861,2015-04-11,20286731,Bob,Everything went extremely well with our stay. Couldn't have worked out better for us. The location was great. The host was very accommodating.   We will certainly consider returning. 
522287,30425236,2015-04-21,27972562,Taylor,"Great location in North Seattle. Never met the host, but house was well kept."
522287,31053469,2015-05-01,29832044,Jin,"房东到机场来接机，住宿情况基本上和描述差不多,但和房东睡在同一楼面。其他情况良好。"
522287,31272272,2015-05-03,32224544,Caitlin,The house was great.  Clean and easy.  Roger was a wonderful host - nice and hospitable.  
522287,31795356,2015-05-10,26607374,Brandon,Roger was a very understanding and accommodating host. The house was excellent and I was very comfortable during my three nights of stay. It's in a great location to explore the Seattle area. From this very positive experience I'm looking forward to visiting again. 
522287,32194960,2015-05-15,28663940,Abram,"Friendly and hospitable host, nice cozy digs in a great neighbourhood. "
522287,32219535,2015-05-15,31190360,Arabo,Roger was a very accommodating host!  He gladly made the effort to provide a much enjoyed driving tour of the town as well as introducing me to some new sights I had never ever heard of!  Would highly recommend his residence as it is very quiet and easily accessible to various other hotspots via bus or walk.
522287,32832255,2015-05-22,31607168,Christopher,Roger was very accommodating and I had a blast during my stay. I highly recommend!
522287,33070248,2015-05-25,22129070,Laurel,"The room was comfortable, the house was neat and very convenient to the bus. Roger, the host, was friendly and helpful."
522287,33746410,2015-05-31,33998609,Rukshan,We were visiting Seattle only for 3 days and Roger ' s place provided us just what we needed. His. Place  was a quaint and clean and it was not too difficult to get around. Roger is also a super nice guy who goes out of his way to advise and help you.  The overall experience  was extremely  pleasant.
522287,33972546,2015-06-02,31755052,John-Paul,Roger ensured a well-organized and easy stay.   The house is clear and  quaint and the upstairs bedrooms are connected to the rest of the house (and the bathroom) through a steepish wooden staircase.  The furnishing and bedding are budget-oriented and tidy.  The location is close to public transportation and is on a quiet street.  I would recommend it to everyone who feels comfortable navigating  staircases.
522287,34078885,2015-06-04,31755052,John-Paul,Roger ensured a well-organized and easy stay.   The house is clear and  quaint and the upstairs bedrooms are connected to the rest of the house (and the bathroom) through a steepish wooden staircase.  The location is close to public transportation and is on a quiet street.
522287,34176026,2015-06-05,19143765,Elaine,"Roger was an interesting and a friendly host with plenty of great suggestions for things to do in the immediate area.  His home is adorable with everything a traveler needs. The E line is nearby, so we were able to get to downtown Seattle as well and easily by the most direct route.  Sure beats parking! The kitchen was available to us as well.  We enjoyed our stay."
522287,35153950,2015-06-15,20428714,Pim,"We only stayed at Roger's house for one night but he was a very memorable part of our first trip to Seattle! Roger gave us a tour of the house and explained everything thoroughly. He came off as very open and friendly.

The neighborhood itself is quaint and just on the other side of Union Lake from downtown. Location was far enough to be peaceful but close enough to be convenient.

The house itself is indeed old, but has all the amenities you could ever need. his bathroom is spotless as well! The bed in the upstairs room is very comfortable. :)"
522287,35559944,2015-06-20,1776310,Gerrit,"I liked my stay in Roger's house. I was arriving quite late, but Roger was waiting for me in order to explain the necessary details of his house. The neighborhood is quiet, but close to a nice commercial street with lots of restaurants and shops. Going downtown is rather easy as there is a good bus connection just two blocks from his house. Apart from that, Roger is a nice guy to talk with.
I know where to go next time I'll be in Seattle."
522287,35648128,2015-06-21,11305077,Robert,"Very quiet, comfortable feeling neighborhood, off the beaten track, easy to get to, plenty of on street parking.  The space is small but comfortable, and there is an open welcoming common area.  "
522287,36208890,2015-06-26,15056151,Natalie,"Roger was super friendly, didn't see him except for check in and after he noticed I left my retainer in the bathroom!  Huge lifesaver! 

You are staying in a room an earshot away from the owner and/or another guest. You share a bathroom (down the stairs from the room) with Roger or the other guest, and possibly a guest who stays in the sun room adjacent to the kitchen (not an enclosed room, just a screen separation). This was a little problematic because we had our 3 year old and we woke up earlier and felt like we were disturbing everyone in the house although we received no complaints. We also felt like we had to stay in the room...we didn't want to disturb anyone else. 

The bed and room in general is small, perfect for a single traveler in my opinion, preferably male. The bed is ok. This isn't deluxe accommodations but they are fine. It was unseasonably warm and being upstairs was a bit hot. Roger had a fan for us which helped a bit. Area is great! No need for car. Good food everywhere. "
522287,37160416,2015-07-05,12435397,Ruby,"The home is simple and humble, so is the host Roger. It is well located and it took us a casual walk of 25 mins to Gas Works Park. Roger gave us useful tips and advice that made our stay easy. Our room was a little compact due to our huge luggage but we still managed it well. The home may be a little old fashioned but everything was clean and well kept. We had a good time chatting with Roger about cultural differences."
522287,37595427,2015-07-08,36168734,Youngsin,Roger's house is a good place for a traveller to want to experience an actual life in Seattle. It is located near a beautiful lake and good places to walk around. I felt it would be a better place for a single traveller than a family but my daughter loved staying there.
522287,38413808,2015-07-15,35218477,Michael,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was great. Roger was very kind, welcoming, and helpful throughout my stay. The house was located between two great neighborhoods, Fremont and Wallingford, and near several public transportation options, which was nice. I would absolutely recommend this listing to others looking to stay in Seattle."
522287,38713863,2015-07-18,33163660,Yvonne,"Roger was very kind and welcoming.  His home was nice and well kept and the 
neighborhood was peaceful and quiet.  We enjoyed visiting the Fremont area and the Woodland Zoo.  My son and I had a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
522287,38907530,2015-07-19,36323883,Andre (Tazzie ),"Too far to walk all those stairs both inside and out, wifi didn't work until rebooting modem. Second bed as an extra provided cramped conditions. "
522287,39515026,2015-07-24,620832,Richard,"Roger was incredibly welcoming, staying up late on my arrival date to make sure I was taken care of. The house was homie, clean, and easily accessible from where I needed to go. Greatly enjoyed walking around the Freemont neighborhood. The house was quiet and I was able to come and go as needed. I will definitely be staying again on my next visit. "
522287,39757551,2015-07-26,8905503,Michael,"Clean sheets and towels were provided, and house rules/instructions were laid out clearly.  I never actually got to meet Roger, but we were in communication the entire time, and the place was perfect for a weekend stay.  Nothing fancy, and the bedroom I had was definitely small, especially with the extra bed in there, but I didn't spend a ton of time in the house, so it served my purposes well.  And the location was very walkable to restaurants and transportation.  "
522287,40014191,2015-07-27,4367464,Woods,"Great stay at Roger's house - he met us at the house to ensure that we were settled in and was very easy to communicate with prior to arriving. The house is tidy and the room was quite & comfortable, it's an easy walk to Fremont and Lake Union so was perfect for our stay (as our office is in that area). Would stay here again."
522287,40446661,2015-07-31,842771,Juergen,"Roger made check-in easy and was available for all questions a guest might have in his two bedroom home in a very good location of Seattle where grocery shopping and restaurants are within easy walking distance and the connection to the interstate roads is not far either.

There are 2 bedrooms upstairs, one of which is often where the host sleeps. The one bathroom in the house is downstairs. The other upstairs bedroom is also very small and it can get very hot and stuffy during a summer heat wave which I experienced. Roger provides a fan and advises the door to be kept open, but at night that reduces the privacy. The low slanting roof does make it a bit of a challenge to use the desk without bumping your head in the bedroom I had.

Roger also allows guests access to the kitchen and living area. Sometimes he also has a guest in the small room just off the kitchen which only has a makeshift cover offering guests privacy in there but one has to be aware that working in the kitchen can disturb anyone in that space.  

Overall, considering how expensive a Seattle visit can be, especially in the summer, I felt Roger offered good value for what I paid and would therefor recommend it to anyone else."
522287,40600358,2015-08-01,35464244,Francis,"Roger was there to greet us when we arrived - getting in contact with him before our stay was very easy. He showed us around the house and pointed out features for our use. And he made it clear that he was available if any questions arose during our stay. The house and our room were neat, clean and comfortable. He went out of his way to make the house cool during a Seattle heat wave. We are very pleased that we chose Roger's place and had the opportunity to meet and chat with him during our stay. It's a pleasure to recommend his house when visiting Seattle."
522287,40722993,2015-08-02,29838567,Xiaodong,"Roger is a very friendly host and welcoming.  He called me one day before and spent a lot of time to explain the house instructions very clearly.  The house is in a quiet neighborhood and the neighbour is interesting.   The room is a little bit small with an extra bed, but we didn't spend much time in the house, so it wasn't an issue."
522287,41936210,2015-08-10,31828458,Xingyu,Roger is so considerate that he provides every detail before you ask. He cares about the feeling of guests. There is really nothing that I can complain. 
522287,42278653,2015-08-12,36101743,Kyle,"Roger is the best airbnb host I've had to date. Was extremely friendly, helpful and inviting. Description was exactly as described, lots of good local advice. People like this make dealing with an absolute pleasure. 10/10"
522287,43229271,2015-08-18,24619802,Ilham,"It was a pleasure staying at Roger's place. I was in Seattle for work and the location was ideal for me. I felt safe in the neighborhood throughout. The bed was comfortable and Roger stocked the bathroom with various amenities like towels, soap and shower gel. There's running warm water too! Apart from that, I didn't use much of the facilities available at the place, like the stove, fridge and laundry. 

The only regret I have is that I didn't have much time to spend on sightseeing. Roger has prepared various maps and leaflets. He also even offered to provide a city tour. So when you have a chance, grab that opportunity! Thanks a lot for the hospitality, Roger!"
522287,44614135,2015-08-27,8303952,John,"Roger was a great Airbnb host and he enjoyed talking about Seattle and all the wonderful places to visit. 

"
522287,44914653,2015-08-30,5570563,Owen,"Roger's cool little house is old and creaky, but don't let that scare you. The place is great for a solo or duo trip, with a small but cozy bedroom upstairs. Roger is one of the most welcoming and kind hosts I've had and would happily stay again with him."
522287,45269215,2015-09-01,38298567,Sam,"Roger's house is quiet, and in a peaceful little area in Fremont- close enough to the heart of it all to get a little nightlife in, if you don't mind a small walk, but far away enough to enjoy the quiet night air.
Roger is a really cool guy who has made staying at his place very easy- labels on everything, great with communication and gave a short but informative walk-thru of the house before giving us some privacy. PERFECT stay."
522287,45536733,2015-09-03,38057284,Celine,Lovely guest with a lot of good informations. Great place to stay.
522287,45646643,2015-09-04,29392022,Alex,"Roger was friendly and knowledgeable, and his house was clean, quiet, and convenient."
522287,46309008,2015-09-09,16718759,Peter,"We definitely had a great time at Roger’s house. He was very welcoming and did his best to accommodate us with our voluminous overseas luggage: as our bedroom was widely filled with the suitcases, Roger let us use his living room for hanging around during the day and in the evenings. We really appreciated his generosity – also with regard to using the kitchen! 
Fremont is a great place for going to restaurants, cafés and other sorts of entertainment in the evening; no wonder as it’s close to UW campus with quite an international student community.
Once again many thanks to Roger! We can surely recommend him as a host!

522287,47642334,2015-09-21,15544296,Kiki,A W E S O M E ! ! ! I can do nothing but recommend this place to anyone who wants to meet an extremely nice and humorous guy named Roger. He did everything he could to make me feel home in Seattle ! The room is clean and the location is convenient as described. Thanks you for showing me around the whole city with passion and joy!
522287,48092286,2015-09-23,30596566,Ashlee,"Roger was a great host! Very friendly, super knowledgeable about the area, and the room was just what we needed. "
522287,48394972,2015-09-26,39866478,John,"We  highly recommend this place: great location, comfortable room, friendly host. No complaints!"
522287,49363332,2015-10-03,27591477,David,Roger wasn't in town but left everything needed and made sure to be in touch. It's a great neighborhood with lots of places to eat not too far away and a straight bus shot downtown (or bike ride as I did a bunch of times).
522287,50195808,2015-10-10,15325837,Björn,The house and room was as advertised. Roger is a really nice host and I felt at home the very first minute. Good bus connections to downtown
522287,50415715,2015-10-11,939975,Mike,"Roger was a consummate host with a wonderful house to share. As soon as I arrived he made me feel welcome, gave me the lay of the land, and gave me several recommendations of how I could maximize my short time in Seattle. He was the first AirBnb host that I extensively interacted with and he was friendly, engaging, and I thoroughly enjoyed talking with him. 

As for the house, the bed was incredibly comfortable, the entire place was immaculately clean, and enjoying a strong cup of coffee in his living room while the morning sun trickled through the shades was a perfect way to start the day. I would not hesitate to stay with Roger again the next time I'm in Seattle, hopefully with more time to explore the many more of the suggestions he provided. "
522287,50905118,2015-10-15,7940403,Carie,"Roger is a wonderful host and quickly made me feel at home. The upstairs room is cozy and comfortable, the house quiet and full of character (including some of Roger's beautiful artwork). Roger has everything in the common area that you might need--from the WiFi password to info on Seattle trash sorting--labeled with friendly notes. It was a very nice home-away-from-home for a few days, Thank you Roger!!"
522287,51379768,2015-10-19,16059626,Joe,Roger was a great guy and host. The house was very nice and as described and Roger is a great source of information on Seattle. The house and rented space was very clean and well maintained. Roger and I got along great and he offered to take me with him to West Seattle to walk the neighborhood with his friend. Very generous. It was a great experience. Thank you Roger
522287,52556162,2015-10-30,41158892,Paige,"I absolutely loved staying here. The room was quiet and comfortable, and Roger was a fantastic, friendly host. Another gold star!"

522287,53140093,2015-11-05,875584,Scott,"Roger is a great host, and I love staying at his place. The neighborhood is safe, vibrant, and welcoming. Lots to do and easy to walk around. Roger's place is as described and I think of it as home away from home. "
522287,53526764,2015-11-09,40736775,Xhenis,"Roger was extremely professional and friendly throughout the experience. He checked up on us serval times to make sure everything was ok but wasn't overwhelming. The house was in perfect condition when we arrived, and also very clean. One thing I loved was he had signs everywhere so if you had a question about something there was most likely a sign for it! Thank you for the wonderful experience in Seattle and will 100% consider your place again for the next visit!"
522287,53980271,2015-11-15,4198761,Kieran,Beautiful home located about a eight minute walk from a bus stop that will take you straight to downtown Seattle and to most of the major tourist destinations. Roger was very accommodating and flexible. I would highly recommend staying here! 
522287,56519230,2015-12-14,22687771,Sandra,"Roger's house was in a perfect location for my week-end in Seattle. The house is old and a little funky, but had everything I needed including access to kitchen so I could cook meals. Roger was a gracious host. He provided everything I needed, including a hairdryer. Location is great. Bus to downtown very close and fast. Wide variety of restaurants, grocery and other shops within a few blocks walking. Pam's Kitchen, Caribbean food, was especially delightful find. Summer would be more comfortable in this house, but winter is doable, just takes a little concentration to manage heat in the house.  "
3123041,13524305,2014-05-29,14100034,Bryan,Diane was a great host! The studio has all you need if you are just out and about checking out everything Seattle has to offer. The Studio entrance was very private and clean. I highly recommend staying at Diane's place!
3123041,13712413,2014-06-02,15900704,Alan,"A pleasant little hideaway in a mostly quiet neighborhood. It is on the bus route which can be a bit noisy, but ultimately we were looking for a clean, comfortable place to sleep, at a reasonable price and that was provided. A Starbucks and QFC supermarket near by."
3123041,14493526,2014-06-20,15531674,Abdulaziz,"Diane was very good communicator from the first day, her response is very fast and when i check in it was very good and she have a very good personality. Her place is very good place and very close to QFC and petrol station and their is bus stop near to her Urban Studio. When i come i find fresh water with Chocolate and the place was very clean with a very good design as well. The internet speed is very high and the entrance for the studio is private, i would recommend this place for any one who is visiting Seattle. for me if i come back to Seattle i will go for her Urban studio."
3123041,14579751,2014-06-22,16576727,Liz,"Diane's place was very nice! Gorgeous space and private! The street traffic was not loud at all, so it was peaceful to stay in! Diane was beyond helpful with great idea's on where to go eat, out, and around! "
3123041,14754667,2014-06-25,11881297,Lena,"Adorable little Studio, wonderfully decorated on the inside and well stocked with everything you could want. There is a washer and drier, a bathroom, a mini fridge filled with water etc. When we arrived we also found 2 CHOCOLATE BARS!!! Diane was extremely helpful, she had a whole booklet already prepared with information about the room and neighborhood. She was also more than happy to answer questions herself about the area. For those nights you don't feel like going out she is also prepared. She not only provides plates and silverware but also washes them for you when you are done!

Diane is wonderful, and the place is beautiful. Highly recommended! "
3123041,14838901,2014-06-27,9354297,Alexandra,"LOVE LOVE LOVE the little urban studio!! Everything is carefully thought out and you really feel incredibly welcomed as soon as you walk in the door. Diane has thought of everything! This is like staying at your best friend's house, while having your own private space at the same time. 
When it comes to location, you're also in luck! The bus downtown can pick you up on the street right outside, and you are in a quiet, safe area. 
The host Diane is so sweet and warm with impeccable taste, you really couldn't have better accommodation or a greater new friend. And her dog Stella is adorable!! 

All in all, Diane and the studio are big reasons why I love and only have fond memories of Seattle. Will without a doubt stay with her next time I am in Seattle!  
"
3123041,14989753,2014-06-30,11916498,Brad,"Diane was very personable and Stella (her dog) was a sweetheart. Listing was even better than we expected, complete with sweet little amenities. Magnolia is a nice neighborhood and the proximity to the Eliot Bay Trail is a great plus!"
3123041,15231587,2014-07-05,16863644,Victor,"Cozy room, great place to base your visit!"
3123041,15498977,2014-07-10,16515630,Pierre-François,"Thank you some much, Diane, for your warm welcome and your kindness. We enjoyed the café with you and appreciate also the lifts to Ballard. 
The studio is comfy, well decorated, good location and quiet. On a practical point of vue, you have everything needed : fridge, laundry and dryer, kitchen ustensiles. "
3123041,15764035,2014-07-15,1691685,Rebekka,Diane is a great host and her room/apartment is very nice. She has so many tips around the city of Seattle and she was so kind and good to pick us up very late since the bus had stopped running. We would have loved to stay longer at her place but unfortunately there was a bug problem in the apartment. Diane called in an exterminator and refunded our stay. We still highly recommand to the Airbnb community to stay at her place!
3123041,16094748,2014-07-22,16298481,Hanna,"Diane was a very gracious host, going out of her way to make us comfortable.  The room was cozy and in a great location, with bus stops right in front of the house in a lovely neighborhood. She provided soaps, candy, water, tea, extra blankets and pillows, and laundry detergent. She was very kind and provided helpful info about the city and where to go. I'd stay here again!"
3123041,16258088,2014-07-24,16915159,Sean,Great place to stay. we drove a long time the day of our arrival and got in town a little late. The host called us and made sure things were going good and let us know where to pick up the keys. This is the smallest 5 star resort in Seattle. We couldnt have been any happier with the room.
3123041,16412116,2014-07-27,14953033,Victoria,"Fantastic experience!  The room is nicely decorated and has its own convenient private entrance. Diane definitely takes pride in the keeping the space comfy and leaves a personal touch.  She is super friendly and great to talk with! She has great recommendations for restaurants, hiking, events and everything else in Seattle.  Would definitely stay here again!   "
3123041,16559924,2014-07-29,16861471,Dave,"Diane's Little Urban Studio in Seattle was comfortable and an outstanding location  -- just a few minutes to the ocean and a few more to downtown.  The neighborhood was nice, with lots of flowers and trees.  Another big plus was there is ample parking around.  You are also close to a grocery store, nice Irish Bar & Restaurant.  My wife and I enjoyed our two-day stay immensely, plus we are dog people and got our dog fix by meeting Stella, a ball-hound golden retriever.  "
3123041,16899374,2014-08-04,3244322,Jessica,"We stayed at Diane's studio for five nights and loved it.
The studio is sunlit, quiet, clean, and cozy. True the description, it is private and the separate entrance eliminated any worry about waking up anyone when we came home late. It's located in between Ballard and Downtown, making it convenient to access both. 
The best part about the studio is Diane's thoughtful and creative touches (the artwork, homemade soap, sweet treats, etc) in every corner that clearly show that she has considered any want or need we may have had.

We also enjoyed getting to know Diane and her golden retriever, Stella. Diane is kind, insightful, and inspiring. If you have a chance, you should definitely take a peek inside her brainchild-- a lovely artists' boutique & studio located in the Ballard neighbourhood. And there is nothing like coming home to Stella's sweet joy. She's mouse quiet and we loved her company.

During our stay, there were spiders in the studio which may be troubling for people who have arachnophobia. It didn't bother us in the slightest and I have full confidence it will be solved soon. I would also be careful to put any open food or sweets in the studio's fridge to avoid tempting bugs inside. 

Overall, it is a wonderful place and I highly recommend anyone going to Seattle to consider Diane's studio."
3123041,17056319,2014-08-06,8595135,Andrew,"We loved this place. Fantastic private room with private bathroom. Laundry available and WiFi. Diane was hospitable, helpful, and great company. She provided us with chilled bottled water, maps, tea, treats, and postcards. Close to lovely area of Seattle. We had a car which made downtown only a ten minute drive. Five minutes to the lake. 
Overall this was a wonderful place to stay and we couldn't have asked for more. Thanks Diane!"
3123041,17281916,2014-08-10,17015180,Leo,"The Little Urban Studio was perfect!  

Diane is an amazing host and tries to ensure that your stay will be as pleasant as possible.

I would definitely look to stay there again!"
3123041,17566514,2014-08-14,17296793,Patricia,My experiences with Airbnb and the Little Urban Studio were both great.  It was easy to access the site and choose the perfect little spot from which to explore.  I would use both again in a heartbeat.  Thank you Diane and Airbnb!
3123041,18002649,2014-08-20,16547561,Florence,"Our host, Diane, was very welcoming. All of the pictures listed (including friendly Stella!) are very accurate of the place. There are a lot of amenities and some toiletries in case you've forgotten any toothpaste or body wash. Parking was not an issue in front of the quiet, scenic, and friendly neighborhood. All of those little extra tidbits, along with her pleasant conversations, made our stay very comfortable. We would definitely consider using the Little Urban Studio whenever we come to the Emerald City again."
3123041,18131467,2014-08-22,19079761,Julie & Andrei,"We arrived late at night, and Diane was nice to accept our late ""check-in"". We did not get to meet her until the next morning. We felt welcome because the studio (which looks like in the picture) had a lot of small artistic touches, like our names and welcome message written on a small blackboard, the weather during our stay written in chalk above the bed, a ton of maps, bus routes, and other tourist information, and even bottled water, tea bags and other goodies.  The neighborhood is really quiet, and we  found parking right outside. The bus station is a few houses down, and it took us about 10 mins to get to downtown.  We would stay here again. "
3123041,18405702,2014-08-26,16201905,Yannick,"Diane was a perfect host, kind, helpful and the Little Urban Studio was just as described, very private and cozy. It even wasn't a problem when we arrived at around 1:30AM due to our delayed flight. She even invited us over for a drink one evening and provided us with a lot of helpful information regarding our stay in Seattle.
The bus that stopped just a few footsteps away took us to downtown in about 15-20min. Discovery Park is also not to far away.
Overall we enjoyed our stay very much and will definitely be back sometime in the future. Thanks Diane! :)"
3123041,18715179,2014-08-31,13814035,Tyler,The room looked great. It's obvious that a lot of time was put in to make sure guests are pleased.
3123041,19280415,2014-09-09,14096165,Judd,"Although Diane was out of town, everything ran smoothly during my stay. Great location, comfy bed and pillows, safe neighborhood."
3123041,19612739,2014-09-15,19824249,Marta,"We didn't meet Diane, because she was out of town, but she explained to us in detail how everything worked and answered our inquiries via text message right away. The location was nice and easily accessible to downtown Seattle. The place was not as clean as I had hoped, but it really wasn't a big deal, just some dust and spider webs. "
3123041,20760208,2014-10-05,20913716,Erin,"Diane thought of everything!  She had so many thoughtful touches and provided all kinds of details for us.  The studio is in a great, safe neighborhood accessible to lots of things and it was easy to get around from Magnolia.  Thanks Diane! "
3123041,21123750,2014-10-12,17795812,Jen,"Upon our arrival, we were super excited that the bus actually dropped us off about a house away from Diane's. The public transportation was super easy as suggested. Being my first trip to Seattle, transportation, location and neighborhood were important to me and those expectations were well met.  It was very apparent that Diane covers all her bases to make for a perfectly accommodated stay. The room was exactly what we were looking for and filled with lots of little extras, like chocolates and tea. I was visiting during my birthday and Diane even left us some cupcakes and candles to celebrate, an extremely sweet gesture! She and Stella (dog) were very personable and welcoming. We would definitely recommend this listing and would stay here again."
3123041,21345895,2014-10-15,21104764,Julie,"We absolutely loved the Little Urban Studio (so much that we actually blogged about it).
Other than the fact that it looks exactly like the pictures on AirBnB, it is, to me, more than you would expect from an AirBnB and more like what you would expect from a proper BnB or a hotel (and a good one).
Diane, the host, is a fantastic person, nice, bubbly and willing to help and give advice. Her dog, Stella, is awesome and loves cuddles. But Stella doesn't come in the bedroom so don't worry if you have allergies.
In Diane's Little Studio you are first of all greeted with a lovely note on a blackboard on the wall! Then you come in and you see the bathroom on your right and there is a collection of towels of all sizes - one for your hair, one for your face, one for the shower... And that is a big difference from other AirBnBs where you usually get one towel - or none. There is also handsoap and cotton.
On your left, there is a washing machine and a dryer which is super handy when you are travelling for 7 months like we are. There are also cutlery and plates and Tupperware (and a fridge) if you want to buy some food and pack it for the day. To me that's definitely a plus, because it made you feel like home.
Finally the most important part: the bedroom. Like I said, exactly like described. But the decoration is really nice. A bit of Seattle and a bit of Diane's travels. The bed is very comfortable.
The main surprise for me was to see a desk with tea facilities, a collection of teas, 2 bottles of water, 2 local chocolate bars, pens and notebooks and postcards for us to use... I was amazed by how much thought was put into this and how handy it is. When you are travelling you need all sorts of little things that you always have to borrow or buy and then you leave it somewhere. But here, Diane thought about it! And I cannot thank her more for that.
So, conclusion: if you are going to Seattle, you should be staying there. :)"
3123041,21473886,2014-10-18,19169790,Ever,Everything was so great! Then neighborhood and the actual place fantastic. It felt like home away from home. This place has everything you need. Can't wait to come back. It was great first stop to our 10yr anniversary.
3123041,21824541,2014-10-25,20036909,Rich & Nancy,We were not at our place except to sleep and the bed was very comfortable and we always had a good night's rest.  Because our daughter lived close by we left early in morning and came back late at night.  Talked with Diane on phone and text and both of us felt we wish we could have met in person but it did not work out that way.
3123041,22143407,2014-10-31,21314982,Rosa,A great place to stay to visit seattle!   diane is a nice host with good tips For nice places to eat and visit!
3123041,22293895,2014-11-03,20244203,Daniel,Diana was incredibly welcoming and even hosted us for a little get together before heading out to town on the weekend. She went far beyond what I expected from my experience and definitely left me with a good mood the rest of my trip. Thank you!
3123041,22577747,2014-11-10,16592756,JasonChen,"Diane is a pretty nice and helpful host. Although it has inconvenience with entry her house. But she was still patient to say apology to me. She is good host.  Her room is pretty unique and ideal for those of couples or travelers from all around of world. If I came to Seattle next time, I'll stay in her lovely house again. I totally recommend this property to all.   "
3123041,22953645,2014-11-18,22635653,Johanna,"Diane er en supergod vært, når man ankom stod en velkomstnote og det var ingen problemer at komme når det passede os. Vi havde bil, der var parkering lige udenfor huset. Det var ikke langt til downtown, og vi fik set dele af byen vi vil være gået glip af hvis vi bare valgt et hotel i centrum. Magnolia, ballard og freemont er alle tre hyggelige forstader lige i nærheden af Diane. 
Annoncen svarer fuldstændig til hvad man kan forvente. Prisvært, gennemtænkt og hyggeligt!"
3123041,23269409,2014-11-27,22720102,Megan,"Our stay at the Little Urban Studio was excellent. The studio is located in an area that allows easy access by public transit to both downtown Seattle and north to Fremont and the University District. The studio is comfortable, warm, quiet and the perfect place to rest after a long day in the city. Diane provided maps, bus schedules and magazines that made our trips around town even easier and was always easy to reach. We would definitely stay at the studio for any future visits to Seattle!"
3123041,23628315,2014-12-07,15544151,Angie,"Diane's Little Urban Studio is adorable! She has amazing taste in design and decor. It's cozy and simple which is what we needed on our short trip to Seattle. If it had a kitchen, we could probably live there. Diane is sweet and a great host. She provided us with bottles of water, tea, and a chocolate bar. Along with a handwritten note on the chalkboard in the entry way.  I only wish we would have met Stella :) We will definitely be back. Thank you so much! "
3123041,24001615,2014-12-16,1359832,Amy,"Cozy little place in a great location central to many Seattle neighborhoods. Heated bedding kept the damp, cold nights toasty. Diane is graciously attentive and helpful (all while being respectful of your privacy). Very easy street parking worked out well with a rented car."
3123041,24518286,2014-12-30,8269554,Andy,"Diane was a great host who welcomed us with a friendly chat over a glass of wine, accompanied by her very friendly dog, Stella. Diane's Little Urban Studio is everything it is described as and more, including a range of amenities you might have forgotten to pack and a very comfortable bed. I would definitely stay at Diane's Little Urban again."
3123041,25232816,2015-01-10,23423181,Cathy,"After a long day of walking, we looked forward to coming ""home."" Studio was clean, comfortable, and well-designed. It was close to the 33 bus stop, which we used everyday. Though we didn't meet, Diane was amazing. She had a folder of information that truly helped out tourists like us. She had a personalized message on the chalkboard. Ever since we were approved for the studio, she has been consistent and helpful with communication. We're going to miss this place."
3123041,25495326,2015-01-18,20409876,Cassie,"Diane's Little Urban Studio is the most incredible place to stay in Seattle. To be honest, I was  a first time AirBNB User and heading into my trip I was apprehensive about the way everything worked. Not to worry, Diane made our visit to Seattle the most welcoming, comfortable, home-y experience I've ever had.

The studio is located in a charming neighborhood slightly north of Downtown. If you are using public transportation, the bus to and from downtown is located one house down from Diane's (that being said, if you are a light sleeper, the bus might wake you. It was never a problem for me). It is the easiest, most pleasant commute and our experience with public transportation was amazing. The neighborhood is safe, charming, and such a wonderful place to be.

My friend and I were using the Little Urban Studio mostly as a place to rest our heads as we spent all seven days of our trip out and about around downtown Seattle and the neighboring areas. It is a cozy space, it's always warm (but there is a space heater so you can control the temperature), and the details are so thought-out from Diane providing bus maps to chocolate to a variety of teas, coffees, and hot chocolates. It truly is like a home away from home.

Next time I am in Seattle, I would only choose to stay in Diane's Little Urban Studio. It is in a charming area, a safe neighborhood, it's easily accessible through public transportation, and Diane is a sweet, flexible host who went above and beyond to accommodate my friend and I. I would recommend this to anyone staying in Seattle because my experience here was beyond incredible."
3123041,26551342,2015-02-15,26934261,Darcie Lynn,"Stop searching because you just found the most incredible place to stay in Seattle. Diane is the sweetest host and left is a little treat for Valentine's Day. This suite is amazing, so cozy and well decorated. We chose it because of the private access, our own bathroom and parking availability. We were able to park a large truck nearby and didn't need to pay for parking or worry about a thing. Extremely accessible by public transport. With just a bit of walking we were able to see all parts of the city with a little help from Google maps and didn't have to get a taxi or use the truck once! Also, Diane has graciously stocked the suite with a Kurieg machine and a mini fridge. We were so spoiled."
3123041,26939188,2015-02-22,27135445,Ruben,Great place.  Always answered any questions I had and then some. Tans for everything!
3123041,28325924,2015-03-22,28180522,Anita,"My first time AirBnB experience was great with Diane as my hostess. I came in late (after 9:30PM) and Diane was very gracious and welcoming. Stella was delightful. 

Diane showed me the studio and explained where everything was and some quirky little items. This is a very private unit, and very quiet. I had to move the ticking alarm clock into the bathroom because it was too loud! 

This was the perfect place to come back to after spending the day exploring Seattle. Diane very thoughtfully turned on the space heater and the heated mattress pad my first night as I got back after dinner rather late - that was a wonderful, thoughtful touch. The other nights when I came in even later, I was not worried that I would disturb anyone since this studio is separate from the house.

I did not use the coffee maker, but it was a nice touch to have this available. There is WiFi but no TV or radio - that makes it very restful. The artistic touches make the studio very personable.

Thank you, Diane!
"
3123041,28582789,2015-03-26,29482283,Craig,"Diane and Stella  were perfect hosts.  She messaged me on the day of my arrival wishing me safe travels since I was driving up from California to Seattle in one trip.  She gave me perfect instructions on her place and was greeted with a greeting on the chalkboard as I walked in which was a nice touch.  Diane's ""little urban studio"" was clean and tidy.  Since this was my first time in Seattle her place is only about 10 minutes from downtown yet seems much further away for a restful nights sleep in a quaint neighborhood.   I wanted to explore her neighborhood but fell short on time.  So much nicer than a hotel room but with more amenities.  Washer/dryer and keurig to name a few.  Only thing missing was a tv but I didn't even miss it.   If you have a laptop or tablet, she has wifi and you can just stream a show or tv.   Before I checked out, I got a text from Diane asking if I was still around so we can meet.  She came by and we got a chance to meet in person and chat for a bit.  Diane gave some things to do next time I visit.    Definitely will be back and hopefully stay here again =)"
3123041,29074561,2015-04-03,6827147,Julia,"An amazing place to stay! Private, clean, cosy and so cleverly set up and styled! Diane is a traveller so she really does know what you need! We were lucky enough to meet her and Stella! Thanks again Diane"
3123041,29772475,2015-04-12,1997066,Eric,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Diane's thoughtful little studio.  

This was my first experience booking an Airbnb myself so I wanted to find an experienced host.  Diane was awesome.  

The Little Urban Studio is clean, warm (the space heater and electric blanket were great), fun (loved the pictures and decor), and convenient (right by the freeway).  It had everything we could need.  We were delighted by all the thought and care Diane put into designing this place.  

It's exactly as described--a small but cozy place to come back to at the end of a day out.  Even if you need to stay indoors for a while, the bed and desk are fine enough for lounging/reading/working. 

Since it's a separate unit we could come and go as we pleased, which was perfect for us.  However, we did get to meet Diane and Stella when we first arrived, which is great because they are both so friendly.

All this, and much cheaper than a hotel with all its cookie-cutter designs and expensive room services we won't use (website hidden);dr--just what we wanted.  Would definitely stay again.

"
3123041,30124617,2015-04-18,12923793,Don,Great experience. Easy communication and check in process. Nice off street parking right by the space. Wonderful private restroom and the room was very comfortable! Highly recommend this host. 
3123041,32649920,2015-05-19,922290,Christopher,"Diane is charming and thoughtful. The studio apartment has every little thing a traveller could need, such as extra toiletries. Having access to a washer and dryer is a really nice perk as well. I highly recommend her place. "
3123041,32872263,2015-05-22,2744354,Boris,"Diane was an amazing host. Her place was super cute, had everything I needed: comfy bed, full bathroom, writing desk, even a small fridge. She was very accommodating too, responding to my request on the same day, and letting me arrive past 1am (flight was delayed). She invited me into her home and we had a great chat about Seattle and life in general. She was very kind, positive and energetic, and told me tons about what it's like to live in Seattle. Would definitely stay again when I'm up to visit. Thank you so much Diane!!!"
3123041,33148601,2015-05-25,5696146,Olivia,"The Little Urban Studio is as pictured: cute, small, a bit quirky, and private. My boyfriend and I stayed 3 nights over Memorial Day weekend, and loved the privacy and ""separate"" feeling of the place, as opposed to other AirBnBs we've had that were rooms inside someone's home. We truly could come and go as we liked! Using public transit was also easy and convenient, with several options close by. Bed was comfy, sheets were crisp, towels were plentiful and fluffy. Our hostess and her pup were both very warm and helpful, we felt completely at ease there. thanks to Diane and Stella for a lovely stay!"
3123041,33545801,2015-05-29,32779300,Ryan,"Diane provided a quiet and private, yet vibrantly decorated room with private bathroom, mini fridge, and washer/dryer. I had an excellent experience and would highly recommend the Little Urban Studio."
3123041,34863065,2015-06-13,28333362,Anja Fredborg,"We stayed with Diane and Stella for a couple of nights and we had a great time. Diane is very helpful and the little urban studio is very cosy. Stella is very friendly and cute :) 
If we ever go to Seattle again we hope that Diane and Stella is still in business :) "
3123041,35216008,2015-06-16,31617249,Clare,"I was very happy staying in Disney Little Urban Studio. The Space is beautiful, with a comfortable bed and a very nice bathroom. I especially liked the availability of laundry since Seattle was the second stop on my trip. I highly recommend Diane's studio. "
3123041,36046077,2015-06-24,32352138,Will,"We loved our stay at Diane's Little Urban Studio! The check-in process was simple & convenient as we didn't know exactly when we would arrive and we easily found parking right outside. 

The space itself was perfect for our stay with more amenities than we could have thought of-especially the washer/dryer and mini fridge. Even though we were there during a heatwave, the fans kept us cool at night and we never had a problem. The thoughtful extras like bottled water, full stationery set, local suggestions, coffee maker and chocolate were lovely. 

Staying in this neighbourhood gave us a more local experience and with a bus stop right down the street, grabbing the bus downtown was easy.

Diane was easily reachable, offered us great breakfast suggestions when we asked, and made an effort to stop by and meet us with adorable Stella before we left. We wish we could have stayed longer, and if we're ever back in Seattle we will definitely want to stay here again!"
3123041,36247039,2015-06-26,36488445,Lucas,"Diane's place was exceptional.  As soon as we walked in, we were impressed by the level of thought that she had put into this place.  She had everything from a Keurig to a full laundry to a binder with all of her recommendations of things to do around Seattle.  The place was perfectly clean, well-decorated, and in a great location to explore Seattle (just a ten minute drive from Pike's Place and five minutes from all that Ballard has to offer).  We have no complaints, and thank Diane for her hospitality and for a wonderful place to stay."
3123041,36379668,2015-06-28,15544151,Angie,"Diane is such a great host! We felt so welcome and had the opportunity to hang out with her and Stella and get to know each other better. The studio is comfortable and stylish. Even with the Seattle summer heat, the ceiling fan and side windows gave us a nice breeze throughout the night. We had everything we needed including a coffee maker and mini fridge. The bathroom has lots of extras just in case you forget something. Absolutely love it here. We'll definitely try and stay here everytime we visit. Thank you!"
3123041,36668745,2015-06-30,1917204,Camille,"Nice, clean accommodations in a pleasant neighborhood, convenient to bus lines, Starbucks, a few neighborhood restaurants, and a supermarket.  Diane provided lots of information about Seattle, bus schedules, ferry schedules.  And water.  And chocolate.  And a washer and dryer.  She was easy to reach via text and thus was always available in case a need arose.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
3123041,36985274,2015-07-03,2478272,Alejandra,"Wonderful little studio with everything you could possibly need. Plenty of room for two people. I didn't have the pleasure to meet Diane, but communication was easy and prompt. I highly recommend staying here!"
3123041,37464150,2015-07-07,29313092,Claudia,"Bien! Le studio est situé dans un charmant quartier, à proximité des arrêts autobus. Cela prend moins de 10 min pour se rendre au centre-ville. L'endroit est propre et vous avez votre intimité grâce à l'entrée indépendante."
3123041,37769540,2015-07-10,35575318,Oscar,"Diane was very nice and friendly. The check-in process was easy and she greeted us upon arrival. We enjoyed having a separate entrance and our own private space. The location was only a few minutes away from Pike Market, Space Needle, and major highways. Diane was kind enough to provide us with maps and brochures on nearby eateries, museums, and pubs. She had great insight and feedback on places to visit and explore while traveling through Seattle. We look forward to future stays with Diane. "
3123041,38726527,2015-07-18,17814449,Brett,"The Little Urban Studio was perfect for the two of us. From the Welcome message on the chalkboard, to the water,  the list of places to visit, and the maps, Diane did an awesome job making us feel welcome!  My fiancé was super happy that Diane provided a hair dryer and ear plugs.

The Studio itself was clean, private, quite, close to everything, and fit our needs perfectly. 

Diane was super responsive to our questions, and the check in process was super easy.

"
3123041,39101499,2015-07-20,8766201,Alisa,"The little urban studio was the best! We enjoyed the neighborhood which was really relaxed. The studio was not only pretty, it was a cosy, super quiet place and we instantly felt at home and slept very well.  Diane was a great host and it was easy to communicate with her. In her studio Diane has provided her guests with everything one could possibly need and even more. We were so happy to have picked her for our stay."
3123041,39395513,2015-07-23,15421355,Paul,"Diane was very accommodating and friendly. The ""Little Urban Studio"" was as advertised and very comfortable. Easy access and private. On street parking can be finicky, but that's Seattle. We were there to visit with my son and daughter-in-law and new grandson, and realized they live in the same neighborhood."
3123041,39759018,2015-07-26,13408917,Andrew,Perfect little place to lay your head for a weekend in seattle. Close to transit easy access and complete privacy. Diane was very helpful with any questions we had and was accommodating as much as possible! Very happy with the place.  
3123041,41730367,2015-08-09,28571861,Austin,"The ""Little Urban Studio"" looked great on the site, but it was better than we imagined! Everything was clean and simple! Diane also had loads of little and big things to make our stay comfortable. She was always available for questions and to help make our stay comfortable and awesome!"
3123041,42403596,2015-08-13,36161833,Robert,"Diane is a terrific host. She made us feel comfortable and welcome to her lovely studio apartment. It's a fantastic bargain with bus service available for a short ride to downtown Seattle and all the major attractions. We would highly recommend staying in Diane's ""Little Urban Studio"".

3123041,43200209,2015-08-17,40334257,Chuck,"What a sweet spot just a stone's throw outside of the busy Seattle downtown core!  The space is a detached garage that has been finished/converted into a one bedroom studio detached from the home.  The entire property is incredibly cute and incredibly convenient.  Diane was a fantastic host and made us feel VERY welcome.  We had access to her washer & dryer, which we took advantage of (was nice to return home without hours worth of laundry to get caught up on).  The space doesn't have air conditioning, but with the windows open--the draft keeps the space most comfortable.  Diane has a binder in the room full of her own personal recommendations:  breakfast joints, dinner, coffee shops, hiking, shopping, parks, neighborhoods, misc. sites, etc.  We were never disappointed when going on her recommends--win after win!  My only regret was that we never got to see her doggie Stella :-)"
3123041,44312651,2015-08-25,38100292,Robert,"space was beautiful and comfortable, as pictured. Diane also left a welcome book with awesome local insight and tips. neighborhood is residential but a short bus ride or uber trip to plenty of bars, restaurants and the city center. should I ind myself back in Seattle, would not hesitate to stay here again. "
3123041,45074316,2015-08-31,34885914,Sean,This was my first experience with Air BnB and I could not have been more pleased.  Diane is a stellar host who has thought of every little thing that a traveler could possible want or need.  I loved the private entry studio and privacy while being able to enjoy all the wonderful aspects of the Magnolia neighborhood.  I would definitely return in future.   
3123041,45533951,2015-09-03,22362620,Diana,We stayed 3 days at Diane's Urban Studio which is a small but quiet and comfortable place to stay in Seattle - exactly as described. Diane made us feel very welcome. We found Diane's dinner recommendations very helpful and have had a wonderful time. Thank you!
3123041,46383660,2015-09-10,25317029,Kent And Mary,Diane was incredibly easy to work with.  She was very accomodating about making sure we could access the studio.  The studio is a perfect place to stay and explore the city!  My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay in this quiet neighborhood.  
3123041,46812511,2015-09-13,14128061,Mazi,Diane made us feel so welcomed when we arrived. She greeted us with Stella (her beautiful dog) and made sure we had everything we needed. The studio is very clean and comfortable! It is exactly like the description. Diane is truly a super host because she pays so much attention to detail. I will most definitely stay at the Little Urban Studio again when I return to Seattle! 
3123041,47160629,2015-09-16,39185757,Dawn,"The studio was charming and cozy! It met our needs perfectly, and is also conveniently located to a bus line that goes straight to downtown Seattle. Diane was welcoming and worked to make sure the studio was comfortable, clean, and ready for us. Great experience overall!"
3123041,48877486,2015-09-29,38792100,Jing,Amazing experience! Diane prepared almost everything you may need from cleansing oil to detailed tips. We couldn't have such perfect tour without Diane's tips.
3123041,49882157,2015-10-07,33809678,Danilo,Very warm welcome! The studio was comfortable with everything you need. Diane and her dog are very nice.
3123041,50881106,2015-10-15,45563433,Melanie,"The Little Urban Studio was my first AirBnB experience. The place is cute and since I had a car, it was easy to get everywhere. I especially appreciated the comfy bed and pillows, the space heater, the hangers and hooks for my clothes, the tea pot, 2 bottles of water, the fridge, a roomy bathroom counter and the privacy. The trucks rumbling by in the mornings would wake me up. I actually FELT them go by but that rarely happened at night. It's a quiet residential street. I was a little worried about the noise of the home being built 2 doors down but it wasn't an issue. I didn't use the washer and dryer but that is a great perk! I never actually met Diane or Stella since I was gone most of the time but I'm sure they are lovely. I definitely had a good experience!"
3123041,53014001,2015-11-03,14996484,Kaneika,This was my first Airbnb experience and my Boyfriend and I loved everything about this place. The studio was perfect it had all the little amenities of home. It was so warm and cozy and the location in the city was great. It was hear everything that we wanted to get  to. Everyone knows Seattle can be a bit chilly so they had robes and slippers waiting on us and the electric blanket warned right up on cold nights. I would love to stay here again on future trips to Seattle. The location of the studio next to house made it feel extremely private and secluded which was exactly what we were looking for. 5 Stars!!! Thanks Diane & Stella
3123041,54350220,2015-11-18,45996033,Elle,"Seattle was amazing. I was visiting to see a school and I left with a love for the city. The neighborhood where Diane lives is right in the middle of everything, if you have a car. "
3123041,55786591,2015-12-06,15544151,Angie,We love staying at Diane's Little Urban Studio. This is our third stay and have become very comfortable with the studio and the neighborhood. It's a short drive to downtown with the ease of being in a quiet and cute part of the city. Always a pleasure! 
3123041,56375866,2015-12-13,35430528,Rachel,"My husband and I had a great experience staying in Diane's Little Urban Studio! It really does have everything you need: the bed is cozy and warm (with an awesome electric mattress pad); the bathroom os with equipped towels and toiletries; washer and dryer and mini fridge with utensils and tupperware are available; and what's more, there are lots of little extra touches, like a coffee-maker, bus route lists, pamphlets about the city, slippers to wear in the studio, and of course, the binder full of info and recommendations.

The location is great - there is a direct bus into downtown that only takes 20-30 minutes and Ballard is just 15 minutes to the north. We used Car-to-Go and Uber a lot as well and nothing was very expensive.
Finding the place and getting the keys was super easy.

We came just after there were a bunch of flooding alerts in the area and there had been a lot of rain. This was probably the reason that the studio's sump pump gave us some trouble. We had to stop using the plumbing in the apartment, but we told Diane about it right away and she invited us to use her bathroom in the morning and then was able to get the sump pump fixed the next day! In the end, we were actually happy that the turn of events allowed us to get to know Diane and her dog, Stella, a bit better!

I whole-heatedly recommend Diane and her Little Urban Studio!"
7988337,45754641,2015-09-05,43191694,Rudy,"Tiffany was very hospitable on our stay. The place, although not that well furnished, was very cozy and close enough to get back and forth to everything we had planned while visiting seattle. The U-district had a lot of shops and places to get food that were fun to check out in the area very near to the apartment. "
7988337,45903746,2015-09-06,42844948,Laura,"This place has some potential.  It's just not quite there yet.  It's pretty bare-bones with a twin bed, sleeper couch, armchair, and coffee table.  I feel the nightly rate for this place is too expensive for what it is.  The host, Tiffany, was very helpful."
7988337,46672432,2015-09-12,42508649,Lars,"We had a great 4 nights stay in this unit. Tiffany and David made us feel very welcome and made sure we had everything we needed. The only thing we were kinda missing is a table with some chairs. But there is room for more furniture, so i'm confident they will put something in it soon. Thank you tiffany and david!"
7988337,46828220,2015-09-13,43656713,Mariah,"Tiffany made us feel very welcome! She was willing to let 4 of us stay in this unit instead of the listed 3. We were expecting just a sleeping bag on the floor for our 4th, but she went above and beyond and got an inflatable mattress for us. The couch turned into a very large, comfy bed. She also gave us an Uber discount card to help us get around! Dishware was provided and she stocked the fridge with some snacks for us as well. It was very easy to get a hold of her and she was quick to answer any questions we had. Overall, a wonderful host!

Parking is easier on the weekend, since parking is free after 8pm on Saturdays and all day Sunday. We found parking just a block away.

It gets a little hot in the unit since there is no AC, but there are windows to open to help circulate air. Everything was clean and in working condition. There was some noise from outside during the night, but that was to be expected from Udistrict and didn't bother us.

We strongly encourage everyone to stay at her place!"
7988337,47793912,2015-09-21,42904343,Yuhao,"Everything is great. They provided everything you need. If you have any questions or need, you can ask them. "
7988337,49145481,2015-10-01,18912472,Andres,"Great experience.
Tiffany was very helpful and a great host.
The apartment was as expected, would recommend it to anyone."
7988337,49477734,2015-10-04,42996634,Paul,"Great neighborhood, not far from downtown. Clean apartment, would definitely stay here again. Easy check-in/out"
7988337,49738442,2015-10-05,3599181,Richard,Clean and neat apartment.   The host setup both beds for us before we even got there anticipating that we needed both beds.  We also had to arrive late and was very accommodating. 
7988337,49921840,2015-10-07,2447882,Anthony,"This was exactly what I was looking for.  A nice, clean apartment in a nice area. Thank you David and Tiffany for making me feel so welcome. I would definitely stay there again."
7988337,50257725,2015-10-10,13642336,Nikki,"I was the chaperone for two UW prospective students (my daughter and her friend) and this apartment could not have been better located for our needs.  The building, and the apartment, were vintage and darling and my girls were all but ready to move in! The mattress and the couch were very comfortable, everything was clean and tidy. Tiffany and her partner David were very helpful and made us feel right at home. I was concerned about the parking, but there was a lot right across the street, and plenty of easy street parking right on the block. "
7988337,54172106,2015-11-16,9544833,Sima,Tiffany made me feel very welcome! She was so accommodating and was very helpful the entire time. I'm so glad I chose to stay at her place! It was cute and had everything I needed. I can't wait to stay there again!
7988337,54937651,2015-11-25,47679162,晓玲,"这里交通方便,房主也很热情。"
7988337,55588975,2015-12-02,47679162,晓玲,这是续租的一次，房主添加了好多家俱，挺好的
7988337,57899785,2015-12-30,48641056,Casey,"Tiffany was an incredible host! She was very flexible arranging bag drop and check in/check out, it was such a relief not to worry about that! She knew we were in town for a wedding so she was kind enough to let us bring a 4th person in for the night before the wedding. The place was well equipped with wifi and some  courtesy essentials like tea & fruit! She even left us a nice bottle of wine to celebrate! The space is just right for a group of friends, and the area has lot to check out! The Burke museum is really close and really nice cafes close by."
8255615,47900033,2015-09-21,9991163,Greta,Our stay at the caboose was perfect! Super clean and a nice area in Ballard. Parking was super simple each day and Jennifer and her family were kind and attentive! Thanks and hope we get to stay again! 
8255615,51479995,2015-10-20,45621039,Ruth,This little caboose apartment is a great place to stay while in Seattle. Jennifer and David are perfect hosts and have made the caboose comfortable and homey. The neighborhood is quiet with mountains in the distance and restaurants and shops nearby. I look forward to a return visit to this inviting space. 
8255615,55365685,2015-12-01,29218942,Aron,"Jennifer and her family were great hosts, very communicative and warm. We felt at home with our two small children. Jennifer even bought an iron for the space at our request! They live in a great neighborhood in Seattle, great  for walking around and close to many restaurants and other amenities."
3158243,14843556,2014-06-27,16921199,Vincent,"The location is convenient to the University of Washington and to University Village.  The apartment was clean, the bed comfortable, and the bedroom was quiet.  Melissa was accommodating on arrival and departure times.  I would not hesitate to stay there again. "
3158243,15012308,2014-06-30,17171782,Julian,"Neighborhood was quiet, host was very friendly, experience as expected."
3158243,16569972,2014-07-29,17612079,S,"Melissa Yao supplied one small bath towel and one wash cloth for the bathroom. I asked her politely for more towels. She responded, ""Are you going to shower several times a day?"" I ignored her rude question and repeated my request, which she never fulfilled.

The apartment was clean. The bed was comfortable. Furnishings were Spartan. The kitchen had no glasses; it did have one coffee mug and several tiny tea cups.

The apartment is on the third level. The keys for the locks on the front door take some twisting and turning to open the lock.

The location is near University Village. Street parking is usually easy to find.

If Melissa Yao were gracious, I'd rate my stay at three stars. Because of her stinginess and rudeness, my rating is one star: Terrible."
3158243,16897205,2014-08-04,15808265,Mano,"I went to Seattle to attend a conference on the Washington University. The appartment was then perfectly located. It was also clean, very quiet, simple in the decoration and the bed was confortable. The oy one thing I would really improble are the kitchen tools. It misses a lot: glasses, pan, coffee cups,... 
Otherwise the stay was nice for the price."
3158243,17400642,2014-08-11,19257113,Oury,"If you love nature, Melissa's place is amazing. In the middle of the forest, you only ear birds. And if you come from Downtown by bus, the walking distance from the bus stop is beautiful."
3158243,17583470,2014-08-14,16980234,Andrew,"When we arrived, Melissa amicably greeted us, and was helpful in explaining details, including the parking situation (parking was fairly routine, right outside the bldg. during our entire 3 day stay; a plus in downtown Seattle).  

The apartment was very peaceful and quite, full of natural light, with wonderful views to the green landscape of the hillside outside the windows and deck.  The Wi-Fi, television and appliances worked nicely, as well.  The queen bed was of good quality, and very comfortable.  

We found Melissa to be friendly enough, and would consider her apartment again, should we need another stay close to the University.
"
3158243,18290469,2014-08-24,8136293,Cecily,"Lovely, very quiet neighborhood near University Village and UW. The apartment was simple, but nice, and pretty spacious. I didn't get a chance to meet Melissa, but her check-in and check-out process was really easy, and she was very responsive. Great experience!"
3158243,18559465,2014-08-28,19079651,Delgerzul,It was nice and calm place. 
3158243,28841449,2015-03-30,4080771,Justin,"Melissa's place was exactly what I was looking for. I spent 3 days in Seattle to come visit a friend of mine who didn't have enough space for me and my 2 other friends to crash, so we rented Melissa's place, which was a 5-minute walk away. My arrival was delayed so I was unable to meet her when we had agreed to meet, but when I called Melissa to let her know, she kindly left the doors open for me so I could get into the apartment and then came back later to welcome me to the apartment as soon as she could. The location is great if you are looking for a place really near to UW. The bed was very comfortable and the apartment had been meticulously cleaned before we arrived. All in all, our stay was very comfortable and we had an excellent weekend in Seattle!"
3158243,31044427,2015-05-01,27643429,Phyllis,"My grandson and I truly enjoyed our stay in this apartment.  The location near the U Village and freeways was perfect, parking always available.  Melissa was a kind and gracious hostess, providing everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  I highly recommend this apartment for any others wanting to have a relaxing and comfortable stay in the heart of the U District in Seattle.  "
3158243,35321045,2015-06-17,29510218,Susan,"Melissa was very helpful and generous.  We were in Seattle for my son's graduation from UW and had an Airbnb reservation that the host cancelled at the last minute.  The cancellation turned out to be a blessing in disguise.  Melissa graciously let us stay here even though we had an extra person for a couple of days and the location couldn't have been any better!  She also recommended a restaurant that turned out to be one of the best meals I've ever had.  Parking wasn't bad, even though it was graduation weekend.  Melissa even made a late night trip to bring us more towels. Thank you!!"
3158243,36703754,2015-06-30,28361310,Christopher,"The apartment is old and dated.  Prior to the rental the host offered an air mattress to accommodate the 4th person.  When we arrived there was no air mattress.  The host called during the rental and asked if she could remove the sofa and replace it with a memory foam bed.  She replaced it with a piece of 1"" foam (not even a memory foam mattress topper!).  The dining table rocks about 2-3"" in all directions.  This was my first experience using Airbnb.  Not a good one.  
"
3158243,48682653,2015-09-28,35179948,Rajesh,"This has been a good first time experience with Airbnb. Melissa has been a great host and as promissed a nice clean apartment was provided during our stay. The place has a distinct advantage over others as this apartment is a close walk to the univesrity and the university village which is a good place to visit for your regular shopping needs and some nice restaurants. 
Thank you Melissa!!!"
7967844,46315901,2015-09-09,40535152,Mason,The house was even better than it looks in the pictures. We loved the view and all had a great time in the house. The owner was very helpful and kind to communicate with. Would definitely recommend staying here anytime! 
7967844,46676077,2015-09-12,7605466,Fred,Gabe has created the perfect Seattle experience. Nestled in a character filled neighborhood close to downtown but away from the bustle. We felt like residents right away. We were here for business and were able to use the simian area for a really productive ling meeting with our team and then step out into the deck for the views and a relaxing evening! I am looking forward to coming back again. Gabe made our arrival and departure seamless.
7967844,47328680,2015-09-17,38972928,Andrea,"Gabe's place is so nice and so cozy. It would be perfect for a winter trip in Seattle. I didn't know much about the area before I stayed there, but I eventually found Fremont, which is a short 5 minute drive from the house, full of restaurants and vintage clothing stores. The space itself was very clean and comfortable, and in a safe area. There's a beautiful view from the windows, and a lovely patio in the back. It's an airbnb that doesn't feel like you're living on top of somebody else's things, but still has a homely vibe. Definitely recommended!"
7967844,47594988,2015-09-20,44362913,Sarah,"Exactly as described in text and photos. Host was lovely, promptly responded to call when lock had a software error and was kind and patient with me. : )  The big windows face west so we sat and watched the sun dip down. House has everything you could possibly need, including needle and thread. Shower was yummy and there were enough dishes to feed an army. Linens and bed were super clean, pillows the perfect fluffiness. Highly recommend. When we were there the dishwasher and disposal were broken and the tub drained slow but the house is old. I've no doubt they will have those issues sorted by the next renter. There's a great bakery and coffee shop within easy walking distance and the drive to the city is a piece of cake. Don't hesitate to book this place. "
7967844,48368574,2015-09-25,15178770,Kexiang,"Nice place, good location, we hope to stay here again!"
7967844,48660574,2015-09-27,45028079,Michael,"Listing was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Hosts responded to my inquiries in a short time, and answered all my questions. No complaints, the listing is as described. Would recommend to a friend. "
7967844,49799413,2015-10-06,42254668,Linda,A cozy place in QA with everything at hand.  Gabe is a nice host and also a tech savvy. Enjoy our time in Seattle and will definitely recommend it to friends~
7967844,50653904,2015-10-13,7931776,Lisa,"Definitely a charming, comfortable Queen Anne home.  Light, open and airy living room and kitchen space.  The view was spectacular!  Nice, quiet neighborhood with Fall weather, leaves changing color, Halloween decorations and light rain.  The #1 bus stop (end of the line) was a short walk up to the next street through an all residential area.  Downtown, activities and any restaurants are just a short bus ride away.  My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay!
"
7967844,52014849,2015-10-25,4452084,Matthias,The apartment has lot's of windows and is settled on a hill which gives you stunning views over the surrounding hills. You really get a lot of value for your money there. Really nice area and the next bus station is 2 min by foot bringing you directly to downtown Seattle.
7967844,52295489,2015-10-27,29657472,Kasandra,"I absolutely loved staying here!! Having never been to Seattle before, I found that the location was remarkably easy to get to and a very convenient location in general. The inside has tons of natural light (which I love!) and a cute little patio with just enough privacy and great views of the neighborhood. 

Dealing with Gabe was about as easy as it comes. He is a wonderful communicator and gets back to you in a timely fashion. This whole process (which I am fairly new to) was a breeze because of him. You can tell he is an efficient person all around, lol

I would also like to add that there were a couple of little ""extras"" there too. Fresh coffee, hot tea, Iphone AND Android chargers (in case you forgot yours) plenty of towels, blankets, dishes, toilet paper, toiletries, etc made this such a pleasant stay. As with most things in life, it really is the little things that matter. 

I absolutely recommend staying here and if/when I make it back to Seattle I know just who to contact!

7967844,53146985,2015-11-05,47596954,Jim,Last minute reservation which turned out to be super simple.  Host was extremely easy to work with and had comprehensible instructions.  Neighborhood was quiet.
7967844,53624640,2015-11-10,46734751,Lauren,"What a great vacation! And the house definitely was a contributing factor! The house is beatiful, clean, and plenty of room with a view to match! Both bedrooms were very comfortable and couches were just as good to sleep on! The kitchen and living room was very open and bright, even with the cloudy weather! The ability to use my phone to unlock the front door was awesome, no need to worry about keys! The neighborhood was spectacular, very quiet and safe and beautiful trees everywhere, we walked all over the place! It is centrally located as well, it didn't take over 15 minutes to drive anywhere we wanted to go! Gabe was a great host, he responds quickly to any questions or concerns you have (which I had no concerns!) Thanks for helping my family have an amazing adventure together!"
7967844,53854332,2015-11-13,48375355,A'Ala,"This was my first time renting through airbnb. I was unsure if I had done it right and when I communicated with Gabe he was extremely helpful and communicative. Getting into the house required downloading an app and it was truly the simplest easiest thing ever! 
The house was clean and with two queen beds it was an incredibly priced deal. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Oh yes, we went to the children's museum after we left and it was only a few minutes away! Great location!! Thank you Gabe!"
7967844,54082781,2015-11-15,31320080,Michelle,I loved the view. The kitchen had everything I needed. 15$ cab ride to capitol hill was convenient. The host was friendly and quick to respond.
7967844,54746287,2015-11-23,5191719,Jessica,"Gabe's place was very cute and the view was gorgeous. The neighborhood is nice & quiet which made for a peaceful weekend. The only thing that could have improved our visit was if the front bedroom had window coverings. Also, the bulbs in the porch light & light over the couch didn't seem to be working. Very minor things that I'm sure will be fixed shortly. Thank you for having us!"
7967844,55027577,2015-11-27,6254319,Pat,The apartment had remote entry so did not meet our host but when a small problem arose he was available and took care of it immediately. The apartment was as listed and the views from the great room were splendid.Good value for the money
7967844,55401517,2015-12-01,39475936,Kirill,"We had a lovely stay at Gabe's place. Our first impression was how much bigger the apartment was than it looked in the pictures! We were more than comfortable (two adults and our son) with plenty of space. Her apartment is more beautiful than the photo, also spacious, well-equipped, comfortable living. We wouldn't hesitate to come back or to recommend it to anyone else. 
What I loved about the apartment:
- The apartment is exactly the same as on the pictures;
- Amazing view from the kitchen;
- Bbq area;
- Clean and warm place;
- Close to the downtown;"
7967844,55693337,2015-12-04,21680029,Almis,"The house was clean and comfortable. Afew minor maintenance issues with a couple light bulbs out including on the porch which is very dark at night without the light. Otherwise all good. Gabe was accomodating allowing us to arrive early to drop off our luggage even while the cleaners were still there. The location is very picturesque and convenient to both the Ballard area as well as Queen Anne. Street parking was always availble but beware, it is on a steep hill so e-brake is pretty much a given"
7967844,55953911,2015-12-07,36992325,Lyndsey,"We had a wonderful stay! Gabe has a beautiful home with a great view. We used Lyft and Uber to get around and it was very affordable since the home was about 15minutes from everything. 
My only complaint was that there was no plunger in the home, which made for an interesting last day. Still, Gabe did everything he could and always responded promptly."
7967844,56539425,2015-12-14,894164,Jason,"Wonderful time staying in gabe's home. It was clean, warm, spacious and well equipped. The neighborhood was close to everything. Couldn't be happier!"
7967844,57034571,2015-12-21,3108307,Rob,"Gabes place is stylish, comfortable, is in the BEST location and has great views!! Our party of four was 100% comfortable and satisfied! Great place!! Great find! Shhhh..  Don't tell anyone...lol"
7967844,57531908,2015-12-27,47930644,MaryAnn,"We loved our stay in Seattle. Gabe was a great host, very responsive and the location could not have been better. Can't wait to visit again!"
7967844,57886615,2015-12-30,2393157,Norman,"Very clean, beautiful, and comfortable apartment located in a lovely residential neighborhood. Would stay again!"
7967844,58237949,2016-01-01,7380813,Tristan & Sinead,"A lovely place in a quiet and residential area of Seattle with great views of the city. The suite is spacious, with a living area that is flooded with natural light due to the many windows. 

Would stay again."
7920539,46199447,2015-09-08,25080848,Stefanie,"We had a wonderful time in Anthony's 1898 Victorian b & b!  Beautiful apartment, with three comfortable bedrooms.  The apartment was clean and several amenities were thoughtfully taken care of.  We had 6 people staying and we were all very comfortable.  Thank you Anthony for the lovely experience!"
7920539,46964531,2015-09-14,42862527,Alfredo,"Anthony Talevich was a welcoming and responsive host.  He provided helpful information on the local area before we arrived and checked-in with us during our stay to ensure we were happy with the accommodations.  The description of the accommodations was accurate.  The home was clean, tidy, comfortable and restful.  The onsite parking was a real plus as well.  While we mostly walked or used public transport, it was really helpful to have an onsite parking spot.  The immediate neighborhood is a quiet, residential part of town that is surrounded by many medical facilities and the University of Seattle.  It is very walkable and serviced by several bus routes. The walk to the downtown area takes 30 to 40 minutes."
7920539,48098276,2015-09-23,42087704,Sibyl,"This was our first stay at an airbnb and because of our experience, it will not be our last. Anthony is a great host and quick to respond to all of our questions or needs. The location is great as it was central to everywhere we needed to go and be.  The place is clean and comfy. I will definitely be back!"
7920539,49914164,2015-10-07,43857063,Brian,"Outstanding location and beautiful, clean property. Anthony made sure we were well taken care of. I would enthusiastically recommend this to anyone looking for a property near Capitol Hill or first hill. "
7920539,55420542,2015-12-01,279243,Keau,"While we never met Anthony, he made us feel very welcome. He allowed us to drop our stuff early and was available for anything we needed. 

The space was great for us since we needed all 3 bedrooms. The beds were comfortable and the location was centrally located. "
6691324,34684569,2015-06-10,22064619,Susie,My bf and I were in Seattle for two nights and had a great stay at the apartment! The apartment is beautiful/ clean and right smack in the middle of everything! Shellie and Rahn were super easy to communicate with and extremely accommodating! Thank you for the wonderful stay!  
6691324,35261384,2015-06-16,35144260,Mia,"The apartment was perfect for our purposes. It was very convenient to major tourist attractions, but also only a short walk to the convention center for business. Shellie was very helpful from the initial reservation to the simple check-out procedure at the end of our visit. I'm really glad that we rented from Shellie rather than going with a 'vanilla' hotel experience. I highly recommend both this specific property and our host, Shellie."
6691324,35610563,2015-06-20,14565913,Eric,"Shellie & Rahn were excellent hosts, and their apartment was fantastic. You can't ask for a better location in Seattle- we were walking distance away from everything we wanted to see, including Pike's Place, Seattle Public Library, the Space Needle, Olympic Sculpture Park, King Street Station, and the ferry terminal. The apartment was really clean, spacious, and perfect for the two of us. One of my favorite Airbnb experiences so far!"
6691324,36129202,2015-06-25,13769817,Stephanie,"Shellie and Rahn were great hosts! Both were very responsive and informative. The apartment is situated just a few blocks from Pike Place Market. I rented a car, but never had to use it. It was a great apartment. It was very clean and perfect for two people. I could not have asked for a better experience in regards to accommodations!"
6691324,37090157,2015-07-04,35925165,Alexis,"My boyfriend and I spent 5 nights at Shellie's place in Seattle and I honestly believe it couldn't have been any better!! The place was perfect for us, right in the heart of downtown. We hardly needed our vehicle (which we were able to park underground, thank you!!), anything we ever wanted or needed was literally a 5 minute walk. It did get quite warm though so we had to buy a fan to be able to sleep, which was no problem because we just brought it home! 

I would highly recommend this little place and would love to get the opportunity to stay here again in such a great city!"
6691324,37779120,2015-07-10,5507205,Lisa,"This Airbnb is definitely worth every penny.  Shellie, or her friend, Rahn, who stood in for her during our trip, was very responsive - from initial booking, to providing information before arrival, and during our stay.  The location of the apartment cannot be beat, you CAN walk nearly everywhere, and is very near the light rail, and other public transportation.    The apartment itself was extremely clean, and a beautiful, large space.  

The only downside was that the sliding door opens onto 1st Ave., which is extremely loud.  We were there during a record heat wave, and having the door open was a must, but the noise of the buses and trucks were rather unpleasant.   I've suggested to the hostess that she invest in a good fan that will provide some air circulation, and that should take care of that problem.  As we were gone except when we there to sleep, and because we always wear earplugs, the noise was not that much of a detriment, and we would definitely choose to stay there again."
6691324,44656826,2015-08-28,4763491,Caitlin,"Stayed in Shellie's apartment for two weeks with my husband and 3 month old son.  The apartment was as advertised, studio with kitchen.  Clean, stocked with shampoo and hairdryer.  Incredibly close walk to Pike Place and other Seattle hotspots.  5th floor of building has a large shared porch that overlooks the ferris wheel.  We were in Seattle during warmer weather than it's norm, which meant we needed to keep large window open to get some air, and unfortunately the street was a bit loud - but apartment was otherwise quiet when that was shut.  Overall, would recommend staying here, especially for the great location to walk to all the hotspots of Seattle.  "
6691324,44914291,2015-08-30,18941325,Ariel,We were very happy with our stay at Shellie 's apartment. We loved the location for feeling in the heart  of the matter and the apartment itself was very comfortable Kez made us feel welcome. We recommend this rental. 
6691324,46472872,2015-09-11,34771410,Jean,"Shellie was a wonderful host! The apartment really is walking distance to most everything. It is tiny, yet mostly private and very clean.  Some toiletries are included so no need to pack your shampoo and conditioner.  It was a wonderful stay and I will most certainly return. "
6691324,47045081,2015-09-15,37998732,Sameer,The location was  fantastic few blocks from the pike market. Parking  garage made the life easy in a city where parking is always a challenge. The Apartment was great had all the amenities . Would  always love to stay at this location when next time in Seattle. 
6691324,47370878,2015-09-18,25704288,Aanya,Great apartment and great location! Shellie and Don were very welcoming and accommodating. We had a great time in Seattle! 
6691324,48340588,2015-09-25,44381453,Michelle,"Our first visit to Seattle and our first Airbnb experience were successes. Shellie was easy to work with and responsive.  We were lucky as she was able to let us in a bit earlier that standard check-in which was very helpful. Her friend Don was fabulous. He helped get us settled and made recommendations for great restaurants. The apartment was great - clean, safe building/area, ample space for two. It had washer and dryer, kitchen and, large bathroom. It was PERFECTLY located - one-two blocks from Pikes Market, terrific restaurants, shopping, piers, etc. We would definitely stay here again. This was a wonderful experience. I can only hope all our airbnb experiences will be similar."
6691324,48507919,2015-09-27,26322520,Braelyn,"My husband and I stayed at Shellie's apartment for 2 nights. She was responsive to our questions and the apartment was convenient, clean and well stocked with essentials. We were very happy with our stay!"
6691324,49212578,2015-10-02,4317906,Casey,"Shellie did everything to make our stay wonderful. She was in touch through the whole process, seamlessly coordinated all aspects of check in and out, and gave us Seattle recommendations to boot.  

I highly recommend renting from Shellie."
6691324,49977944,2015-10-08,39183412,Laura,"The place was great! Perfect location,  clean , great view! Check in and out went perfect and loved that we were able to get a parking spot!"
6691324,50452821,2015-10-12,37849439,Meaghan,"We had a great stay at Shellie's. The apartment was beautiful, and in a great location. Right near the harbor, and we could walk to everything - Pike Place Market, bars, restaurants, the Space Needle, etc. Shellie and Don were very communicative and quick to respond to us. Don gave us some great advice on what to see and do in the area. The only downside was we found the bed a bit uncomfortably firm. Other than that, the apartment was clean and spacious. Thanks Shellie! "
6691324,50884063,2015-10-15,11733352,Tommy,Perfect place to stay! I was in Seattle for a quick work trip and couldn't have been happier with Shellie and her place. I will definitely be back.
6691324,51696987,2015-10-24,37350151,Jessica,"Our Seattle experience was incredible! Shellie's apartment was beautiful and in an amazing location. Everything within walking distance which was perfect ( pike market, space needle, great shopping and place to eat) . Shellie happened to be out of town when we arrived but was amazingly helpful before hand and gave perfect directions ( very quick to respond as well). Don was who we met with and he was also very helpful. Met us at university station (which is a minute walk to the apartment! The light train Shellie suggested went straight from airport there) and walker with us to the apartment. He was very helpful telling us everything we want to know. Pike market area, passes to shop, restaurants  and  get tourist places. 
We were there for a week and the apartment had everything we needed. It was perfect when in came for us wanting to eat in a couple nights she had everything we'd need to cook a full dinner. The washer and dryer was also very handy.
We would definitely stay with Shellie again it was great and had a wonderful time. It was very comfortable, and nice to come back to at the end of a long day out site seeing:) "
6691324,51957777,2015-10-25,45830009,Maya,"Shellie was an amazing hostess! Even though she was not able to be there, she made sure that we had a host who explained everything, and even offered to pick up us up!

The apartment is right in the middle of everything! Super convenient. 

I would definitely utilize Shellie again. "
6691324,52341421,2015-10-28,9996895,Jacob,"Shellie's place seems too good to be true from the get-go...walking distance to Pike's and seemingly everything else, parking in a garage, wonderful building amenities...and all for a very affordable price. It's not too good to be true, it's all there and provides the makings for a wonderful trip. What isn't listed in the description is the fantastic attitude and care that Shellie, and Don, both have. 

Don greeted us late at night and was upbeat and very helpful. He told us about the various areas around the listing, and all we needed to know about the place.

Shellie further proved how committed she is to making her guest's stays in Seattle wonderful throughout the trip. 

I can't say enough great things about this very clean, modern, and convenient place, which is why you should go see for your self :)"
6691324,53165751,2015-11-05,48114429,Ashley,"Shellie wasn't able to be there but she was still really great with her communication. Her friend Don who took her place was super awesome, extremely nice, very informative, even has a sense of humor... He seems like he could be a character from friends. 
The space was cute, nice and clean, the view was nice and your close to everything. "
6691324,53925207,2015-11-14,5947392,Todd,"Being only 2 blocks from pikes place market my only complaint was with the airlines getting me there a day late. Apartment was clean, and had everything necessary. Shellie responded to any questions quickly. Would highly recommend."
6691324,54092900,2015-11-16,12061762,Brian,"Shellie's place is in a great location close to everything we wanted to do.  She wasn't able to me us, but as others have reviewed, her friend Don got us checked in and was very accommodating and accessible.  Nice, clean place and would recommend.  "
6691324,54583383,2015-11-22,27038865,Grady,"Stayed at Shelli's place over a weekend and all I can say is that it is everything its stated to be and was a very nice place. Completely clean, nice setup, close to everything downtown, and great service. I highly recommend it. Would easily pick this place again."
6691324,55106463,2015-11-28,2942401,Wyatt,"Shellie's place really is in the perfect location in the heart of downtown Seattle. We walked everywhere and had no trouble getting around. The parking space was a huge bonus as we were visiting family in the outskirts. The space was impeccably clean, comfortable, well-appointed and quiet for a city (we're used to NYC, though). Would absolutely stay again, especially considering the attractive price. Check-in and check-out were a breeze."
6691324,55639257,2015-12-03,19600157,Alex,"I was visiting Seattle for four days and loved staying at Shellie's place! I was quite familiar with the neighborhood as I used to work a block away. It's a great location for both just being a tourist or a working visit. 
The apt was very clean and the building very well taken care of and secure. 
Highly recommend!"
6691324,55798911,2015-12-06,11733352,Tommy,Wonderful place to stay! Hosts are very nice and easy to work with. Great location. I will always stay here on future trips to Seattle. Thanks again :)
6691324,56996198,2015-12-20,23256694,Helen,Totally amazing place!
6691324,57469926,2015-12-26,49185152,Dean,"Everything about the Apt. was great especially the location, you can walk to almost every attraction in downtown Seattle. The Apartment itself had a great view of the tall buildings and had a huge sliding door to let in the sounds, smells and atmosphere of a bustling city. Shelli was a gracious host meeting us outside at the curb and escorting us to the Apt. all amenities were provided including a fully appointed kitchen and washer and dryer. the bed was queen sized and the TV had a full cable package. the building itself is wonderful, nicely appointed and considered a jewel in the city by locals that know of it. there are some must stops that everybody needs to visit 1) ""Vonn's 1000 sprits"" it's attached to the building street level, best pasta and comfort food we had in Seattle. the atmosphere was a 10, then ""Fonte coffee"" just north about 100' early breakfast too. and lastly ""Lecosho"" just down the steps towards the harbor, best Italian food and reasonable in $. PS the name of the Apt. building is called ""Harbor Steps"" google it."
1851837,9469191,2013-12-30,3966827,Nick,"What a great little apartment! For my family (two adults, one baby), this was the perfect size. Very clean, easy access, well appointed, with many great amenities from the heated bathroom floor to the fully-stocked kitchen. We stayed over the Christmas holiday and we especially liked all the little holiday decorations and appointments to make the season brighter for us! Georg was a great host, making sure we had everything we needed and then staying out of our way."
1851837,11785484,2014-04-14,11365544,Mark,"Georg was a great host and made things very easy for my wife and our baby girl to have a family getaway.  The rented space is very well appointed, the yard is amazing, and the hot tub was great icing on the cake. "
1851837,13469040,2014-05-28,10889619,Susan,"We enjoyed our stay at this great place.  The apartment was nicely decorated and with all the necessary things to make our stay enjoyable.  The hosts were very responsive and it was nice chatting to them while they worked on their lovely yard.  We had access to their outdoor area which included patio, garden and hot tub."
1851837,22160037,2014-10-31,21018389,John,"Georg's place was great, they made me feel very welcome and the shower was borderline spa treatment.  "
1851837,22935938,2014-11-17,2233960,Lisa,"Georg and Gretchen's home is wonderful and our experience could not have been better.  They were responsive, helpful, and everything about our stay was easy and extremely comfortable.  I would recommend staying here...no question!  The in-law unit is beautifully decorated and obvious care has been taken with every detail.  The hot tub is a relaxation-plus!"
1851837,28367167,2015-03-22,7834423,Kerrilyn,"My husband and I were looking for a quiet getaway for the weekend and this place was perfect.  The property was much more beautiful than the pictures.  Georg was very helpful upon checking in.
The outdoor hot tub was perfect for our getaway.  The place was stocked for exactly what we needed.  The shower was absolutely gorgeous.  A lot of effort has gone into making this place a home away from home with extra bells and whistles."
1851837,29793521,2015-04-12,1298978,Bonnie,"My first experience of airbnb and it couldn't be more perfect! The accommodation is the lower floor of the owners house with separate entrance (which is locked by a key pad-really handy!) It's even better than the photos! I stayed with my husband and baby- and the hosts were really accommodating! 
The place is really well equipped (no oven- but microwave, large fridge freezer, coffee machine, crockery etc), great living area with plenty of dvds to entertain! Washing machine and dryer too which was handy with a baby! Amazing bathroom, provided towels and even shampoo! The addition of a hot tub was great. It's just outside the apartment window so I was confident I could leave the baby to sleep with a baby monitor on and reach it outside whilst we were in it!- perfect. 
The apartment is just downstairs to the hosts, so we were a worried about disturbing them with a tired and jet lagged baby/ early wake ups- and tried to be as quiet as possible worried they'd be woken! But they assured us they weren't dusturbed which is good! The only other thing to note is that there are a number of steps to get to the property from the road- but there may be another entrance?- just ask the hosts of that might be a problem. 
The apartment is really easy to access downtown- just a bus at the top of the road straight in. Perfect! Much easier than driving and parking. There is also a mall down the road (Starbucks, Target, some food places)- walking distance! 
The owners were brilliant- met us to settle us in and then left us to ourselves & gave us privacy, but made it clear I could contact them any time. They even offered to try and source us a baby cot if we didn't have one before we got there! They met us to leave and even helped take the luggage to the car (which you can park right outside the front of the house)- you can't get better than that!!
Thank you both!"
1851837,31039737,2015-05-01,6296342,James Hoyt,"Our visit could not have been nicer.  Our hosts were gracious and welcoming, eager to make sure we were happy and comfortable.  Their home was charming, comfortable and accomodating, complete with a well-designed garden and backyard filled with colorful flowers and plants. The neighborhood was equally nice, close to shops and restaurants, and easy to get around.  Parking was not a problem, which often it can be in Seattle.  It is indeed the ""awesome cozy one bedroom"" they listed it as, and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely, peaceful stay in West Seattle. "
1851837,32635862,2015-05-19,33160504,Ray,"Wow!  We were greeted by these two most wonderful folks - Georg and Gretchen.  This was most welcome after 7 hours on the road to West Seattle.  They have a beautiful home, and our ""space"" for the weekend was the best!  Quiet.  Immaculate.  Everything worked.  We would stay here again, and hope to do so on future Seattle trips.  Thank you Georg and Gretchen.  God bless you."
458191,6312077,2013-08-07,6156993,Jess,"Chris and Tina's place is great. It's in a perfect location, less than a block from the Main Street  in Capital hill and it's an easy walk to downtown. The room and house itself are spotless, super clean. It was just what we needed for our time in Seattle."
458191,19236564,2014-09-08,824913,Maureen,Great place in prime location in Seattle. Awesome restaurants and bars are only blocks away--we barely left the neighborhood. The setup is very professional and we had no issues or worries during our stay. We didn't use the kitchen but it was very nice with new appliances. Lots of common space to lounge around and even a foosball table. There were only two other couples staying during the weekend so we didn't feel crowded.
458191,20723457,2014-10-04,1921241,John,"The perfect place to stay if you're in Seattle.  Chris made me feel completely at home, and was an open, relaxed and friendly host.  The house is beautiful, the room was perfect, and I spent my mornings relaxing in the hot tub.  Situated in the heart of Capitol Hill, near great Cafes (I LOVED Roy Street Cafe, 2 mins from the house).  All in all, a five star experience!"
458191,20879077,2014-10-06,13075701,Lauren,"Chris made everything super easy and efficient for my stay in Seattle. I had all the info I needed to get settled before I arrived. The space is really great, my room was comfortable and clean and the rest of the house has a great vibe. It's in a great location in an awesome neighborhood, I was able to walk to a ton of stuff to go out at night and to grab coffee in the morning. Would absolutely stay here again. "
458191,21491853,2014-10-18,4836978,Greg,"Chris' house is wonderful, the place has a neat and classy hostel/dorm vibe and a perfect central location in Capital Hill.  If you are in town individually as I was it was great as he hosted a wonderful poker night with some very kind and fun young professionals.  If you are coming in a group, Chris' master floor is well separated and the rental space is HUGE and could easily keep a party of 12+ comfortable for a week.  Great kitchen, wonderful covered hot tub/patio area.  Very glad I stayed here for this week long business trip."
458191,22440431,2014-11-06,16308015,Rachelle,"It was very easy communicating with Chris. He had a billboard with all the restaurants menus in the surrounding areas making it easy to decide. His listing was accurate and the house has more of a upscale hostel vibe centrally located. This was my first time in Seattle and I had a rental car so I wasn't aware of the parking situation (tip: probably not an area to have a rental). Overall, Chris was very nice and helpful and the house feels welcoming. "
458191,22751747,2014-11-13,23460793,Pavel,"Me and my boyfriend had a great time staying at Chris' place. It was a beautiful, spacious room/house. Everything was clean and comfortable. Chris was extremely friendly and gave us great advice on places to eat/drink. The area is AMAZING! Lots of restaurants, bars, cafes, and cool boutique and vintage stores around. Thanks for a great time Chris and an extra thanks for giving us a copy of your book (1-800-Awesome...everyone should get a copy ;))! Will definitely be back to stay here, but next time longer :)"
458191,22988305,2014-11-19,14164816,Jennifer,"This is a fantastic place to stay! The host,  Chris,  was highly communicative both before and during my stay so I felt like I was in good hands. The property is far larger than I anticipated even after viewing the photos, which was great for me. I basically had the run of the place to myself. Never even saw the other guest, so I had plenty of privacy. Love the décor, faux fireplace, modern and very clean. King size bed was super comfortable/firm - haven't slept that well in years. Didn't use the kitchen but wish I had because it would've been fun to cook for someone in there.  The hot tub was relaxing and got hot quick. I was so happy I made the choice to stay there. So many restaurants and coffee places/shopping very close, also bus stops and Uber rides back from downtown were $6. The floors are a little creaky, but other than that, the rooms and the neighborhood are extremely quiet."
458191,23049937,2014-11-21,23433415,Rowley,"我的班机是晚上2200抵达西雅图，在房东的指引下很顺利的搭乘light line到了Westlake ，之后转出租车很容易到了目的地！房间干净和温暖，幸运的是2天只有我们2人看着这楼上楼下的6间房间！
我们在西雅图渡过了难忘的一天，因为房间位置很好，我们在西雅图去了派克市场、第一家星巴克、太空针都是完全步行到达！
谢谢，感谢！
我会向朋友们推荐，用中文回复，希望更多的中国朋友看到！
thanks Chris！"
458191,25615766,2015-01-20,25974261,Tiffany,"Honestly, I don't have anything negative to say. We had a great time with Chris and in his space. It is absolutely gorgeous. The hot tub is beautiful and comfortable. The kitchen is stocked with standard spices, dishes, a fridge. It was such a relaxing trip because we didn't have to think of any of this stuff. The only thing we ran into was down in some of the bedding. However, this is more OUR bad, we didn't even think to ask and my girlfriend is more allergic now than she had been. "
458191,27848834,2015-03-13,22289643,Daniel,"I lived in this place from March 1 - March 12nd. Nice, clean and accommodating. The price is quite good in the surrounding areas. Strongly recommended."
8483744,57148123,2015-12-22,30276780,Stephanie,"We loved our stay at this cottage! We were transitioning from MN to WA and needed a place to stay with our cat for a few days. Gabbi offered to lend us a little litter box during our stay which was very helpful! Seattle unseasonably cold during the five days we were there. Gabbi offered to purchase some extra heaters to keep the place warm. After warming it up it once stayed warm without much heat after that. Very cozy! 
When we arrived she stocked the cupboards with tea, coffee and instant oatmeal. There is a full stove and refrigerator but no microwave. I loved that she had a compost, recycling and trash container for our use and a basket of toiletries in the bathroom too! There is a little CD/radio on the kitchen counter so you can play music if you wish. She also had a basket with a small selection of toys and books for kids plus a few books on the book shelves for the adults. That was nice a nice touch if we wanted something to read during our stay. 
The Greenwood neighborhood is great! There are lots of independents shops, restaurants, coffee shops and a grocery store to walk to for all of your needs. It's also a direct shot from the I-5 freeway making it easy to get to!
Gabbi was very kind and helpful to us before and during our stay at her cottage. I would definitely recommend her place! "
3504521,30003853,2015-04-15,14544533,Au,"Angel was very sweet and accommodating. Her place was a perfect, convenient location and was very clean. "
3504521,30641977,2015-04-25,23722816,Mark,"This is a great place for a great price! My girlfriend and I stayed at this location for six nights while in transition from an apartment in Seattle to seasonal work on boats in Alaska. It was a perfect home away from home in a sense and has an amazing location. Within two blocks of the unit you can take bus lines to several different neighborhoods of Seattle without changing busses (downtown, queen anne and the university district). Angel was an awesome host, super responsive to any questions and very helpful. My best airbnb experience to date! If you a convenient cozy place to explore Seattle, this is a great place for visitors. Get this spot if you can!"
3504521,32861205,2015-05-22,32941250,Josh,"It was a pleasure staying at Angel's space. The view is wonderful and the area was spotless upon arrival and Angel's communication was fantastic. If you enjoy walking to good food, or having a drink after work this place is perfect. There are tons of things within 1-2 blocks!!"
3504521,33293591,2015-05-26,26188123,Gina,"Angel was very welcoming and accommodating.  She was not only a fantastic host but also went above and beyond and helped me store my luggage after I check out of her place since my flight that day was late in the evening.  

Angel's place is in a great neighborhood.  It's next to a lot of shops and a supermarket and next to a Pronto Bike Station.  I used the Pronto Bikes to get around Seattle a lot so that was convenient.  

Overall, I had a great experience and the place is very affordable for the area!"
3504521,33854387,2015-06-01,7058526,Ydalisse,"(5 stars) Staying in this place was a nice experience for me. Angel is really welcoming, and she keeps her place clean and tidy. As a bonus she left some breakfast food in the fridge for me and I was free to use dishes and all appliances in the apartment. It is a truly cozy studio in a nice neighborhood with tons of good places to eat and several good coffee shops. I really enjoyed my conference week in Seattle."
3504521,34737831,2015-06-11,4006645,Christopher,"We had good communication - I had written down the wrong street but we found each other fine.  She upgraded her internet while I was there, and so though the previous connection was OK, I'm sure it's even better now.  Comfortable bed, pretty quiet area, street parking is fine within two blocks.  Two grocery stores nearby and a good kitchen for those who cook.  A nice area, lots of fun restaurants and such while close enough to downtown Seattle (also right on a bus line).  I would certainly stay here again - it's good sized studio, just as the pictures indicate.  "
3504521,35391569,2015-06-18,33232032,Jake,"The location was absolutely outstanding.  The apartment was very clean, and was close to a great coffee shop and restaurant.  If I come again to Seattle, I would love to stay at this location.  The description was 100% accurate."
3504521,36569052,2015-06-29,10572929,Julien,"Perfect for a couple on a weekend gateway! Great location with lots of shops, bars and restaurants where you can walk to. Angel was a great host. She welcomed us even though we arrived passed 11:30 pm and us beers and wine to enjoy!"
3504521,37596233,2015-07-08,35412721,Christine,"The area was the best! Tons of hip places to eat and grab a coffee, neighborhood felt safe, lots of charm. Overall, cute and tidy apartment in a good location. It was just right! "
3504521,39302368,2015-07-22,35996103,Nicole,Angel was a great host! She was extremely accommodating and provided everything I needed to have a comfortable stay. The place was also clean and in a perfect location. 
3504521,39986835,2015-07-27,20216687,Kevin,"We went to Seattle for the weekend to catch a couple of baseball games. The apartment is in Capitol Hill with lots of great food and drink options and a quick bus ride to downtown. Angel was a fabulous host and we really appreciated the little extras she provided which included a bottle of wine, some chocolates and a coffee card! Unfortunately we could only stay 1 night, but I'd love to stay here again and explore the neighbourhoods some more."
3504521,40969726,2015-08-03,111958,Noël,"We had a great time staying at Angel's studio in Capitol Hill! It was my first visit to Seattle, so I was worried about getting around, but the bus is nearby and we rented bikes using the Pronto system (easy). The studio is bright, spacious, spotlessly clean, in a quiet clean building, has unexpectedly lovely views, and is in a great neighborhood. Our breakfast across the street at the Wandering Goose might be one of my favorite breakfasts ever! Angel is a very responsive host and eager to make things as pleasant as possible for her guests. Also, the mattress is very comfortable!"
3504521,41787215,2015-08-09,35833465,Kevin And Cara,Angel was had such a warming and pleasant home. The location was absolutely perfect and so beautiful. We loved staying in her home were sad to leave. She is an amazing host and would love to go back and visit Seattle again!
3504521,42151530,2015-08-11,37103935,Brook,we had a great time staying in Seattle.  The location couldn't be any better (walking distance to some great bars) and the apartment offers everything you need (including some drinks and food provided by the host - awesome!). We'd stay with Angel again and again :) 
3504521,43101205,2015-08-17,14898584,Pawel,"Angelique war unglaublich nett, aufmerksam und hilfsbereit. Obwohl sie uns den Schlüssel nicht  persönlich übergeben konnte, hat sie alles daran gesetzt unseren Aufenthalt so angenehm wie möglich zu gestalten. Es stand nicht nur Bier und Wein für uns als Willkommensgeschenk bereit, Sie war auch jederzeit erreichbar, um mit hilfreichen Tips zu Seattle und der Nachbarschaft auszuhelfen. Ihre Wohnung ist sehr gut gelegen, entspricht genau der Beschreibung und ist mit absolut allem ausgestattet, was man so brauchen könnte. Die Lage ist super - zentrumsnah und in einer tollen Gegend, in der es viele Restaurants, Kneipen, etc. gibt. Wir waren sowohl von dem Apartment als auch der Gegend absolut begeistert. Perfekte Unterkunft und perfekte Gastgeberin. Jederzeit wieder!!"
3504521,44327296,2015-08-25,39457847,Phin,"Angel was a great host! Lots of nice little touches in this place, including leaving us chocolate and beer! Her place was very comfortable and had great natural light throughout, just as the description indicated. Also located in a very interesting neighborhood with some great restaurants and near a couple of seriously awesome bakeries. Would definitely stay here again!  "
3504521,45117753,2015-08-31,39508502,Pete,"Great stay in Seattle.

Would definitely look to stay again.  Studio was in a great location, clean, comfortable.  Perfect!

Angel is a fantastic host who made sure everything was in order and as promised."
3504521,45673590,2015-09-05,29299704,Druann,"Angel was helpful and was waiting at the check in time. She left wine, cheese and chocolates which was very nice. The apartment was ideally situated close to shops, restaurants and transport. Close to town."
3504521,46308425,2015-09-09,15077829,Kyle,"I had a fantastic stay.  The location was amazing (near great restaurants, bars, and cafes) and the space was well-stocked and very cozy.  I was particularly impressed as Angel really went above and beyond and out of her way to fix a minor arrival problem I had due to a late arrival in the city, which to me is the sign of an attentive and conscientious host.  I definitely recommend this spot to anyone who wants a centrally-located, but casual neighborhood experience in Seattle.  "
3504521,47111122,2015-09-15,24622213,Dani,"I'm so happy that we found Angel's place! The location is phenomenal, just around the corner from terrific food and within walking distance to all kinds of wonderful sights and sounds. Angel is a sweet person and goes out of her way to make sure your stay is great. P.S., that view really is great!"
3504521,48121370,2015-09-23,8548480,Anne,"Angel was super nice, welcoming, and accomodating.  The apartment is in a fun section of Seattle.  Everything you need is right nearby!"
3504521,48800865,2015-09-28,13534135,Casey,Angel's studio was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. I will be going back when I return to the city. Angel was helpful and kind and even left snacks and drinks at the place for me to enjoy. The view was amazing. Angel's place is exactly like the pictures and close to many great bars and restaurants. It was clean and relaxing. I was very happy with my stay and recommend it to anyone visiting the area.
3504521,50036053,2015-10-08,20332653,Danny,Angel was a great host and I would highly reccomend staying with her again.
3504521,54620837,2015-11-22,40814212,Yun,"It was my first time staying in Seattle, I was so lucky to meet a super host like Angel. She sent me a comprehensive introduction about how to enjoy the living in her studio and around at the first day I arrived in, which was very helpful. The studio was bright, clean and had unexpected wonderful view. The location couldn’t be better, it was in a great neighborhood with lots of bars, restaurants and groceries around. Staying here was really a great experience!"
3504521,56613507,2015-12-15,43237641,Nick,Angel was inviting and helpful. I could'nt of asked for a better location. Thanks for the reccomendations.
5006092,29571893,2015-04-09,13993372,Kayla,"This place was awesome! Susannah has a beautiful little space in her basement that is very comfortable and a great place to relax after walking around all day! It is very private and quiet. There were books, magazines, and movies for entertainment, not to mention she had laid out some Seattle brochures and advice on things to do in the area. Susannah had the refrigerator stocked and even some snacks laid out!  This home is only 3 blocks from the arboretum which has tons of really nice, beautiful trails. It was only a ~10 minute drive to get downtown as well. We stayed here on our last night of traveling and it was a wonderful place to have some downtime. Highly recommend!"
5006092,29860497,2015-04-13,1208168,Elizabeth,"My mom and I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while visiting Seattle! Susannah's place was great. The pictures do not do the place justice, and it was even cuter in person. Susannah was a great host. She made the whole experience easy and was accommodating with our arrival. The apartment had all of the little extras you could think of, including a stocked fridge, snacks, and all of the usual bathroom toiletries and then some! The location is great. It's close enough to downtown in addition to the university's campus. I would highly recommend staying here and would definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle."
5006092,30325870,2015-04-20,25723823,Jackie,"I visited my daughter at UW for the weekend, staying at Susannah's was perfect.  Located in a nice neighborhood just minutes away. It was  just as the pictured. The bed was so comfortable! Susannah was was so pleasant to speak with, and she left us all kinds of snacks to choose from. I will definitely stay here again. "
5006092,30565809,2015-04-24,26529641,Cathy,"Susannah is a delightful, sharp host. The studio is nicely appointed and is perfectly represented in the photos. I look forward to very comfortable future stays."
5006092,30737860,2015-04-26,11942759,Martha,"Susannah was very helpful, friendly, and gracious during our visit. Her spacious studio is conveniently located to public transportation, and offers street parking if you have a car. We walked to Cafe Lago for a tasty dinner, which is only a block and a half away. It was the perfect location for us!"
5006092,30909959,2015-04-28,30478458,Steven,"What a lovely place - close to the U, good restaurants, and easy access to highways.   I loved the space, Susannah was most gracious - and I would love to stay again.

Steven"
5006092,31113245,2015-05-02,10483872,John & Janet,"This studio near UW is the BEST!!   Susannah is a terrific host.  She emailed us a few days before our stay to make sure we had directions and knew where to park.  The space itself is just as pictured and was super spacious, comfy and clean.  My husband says the best part of the stay was the drinks/snacks waiting for us. :-)

I highly recommend Susannah and her studio!  Thanks, Susannah!"
5006092,31949494,2015-05-12,1025133,Elisha,Wonderful space and host! 
5006092,32473230,2015-05-18,5409395,China,"Not only was Susannah's converted basement apartment as beautiful as photos suggested, but she went above and beyond, providing incredibly detailed amenities like breakfast foods, books, and hygiene items - even a cutting board and knife. Her home was in a gorgeous neighborhood and she was home but offered the right amount of privacy. There wasn't a speck of dust, the place was so clean. My only regret is that we couldn't stay longer - I felt truly at home and would love to return on my next Seattle visit."
5006092,33367888,2015-05-27,26976273,Joshua,"We had a great week in Seattle, thanks in large part to the accommodations. Susannah's place was fantastic (exactly as pictured) and she was a great host. Perfectly situated between UW and downtown, in a beautiful neighborhood. Transportation is easy and convenient to both. The proximity to the Arboretum is worth the stay alone. And don't skip Fuel for coffee--maybe the best we had in Seattle."
5006092,34126885,2015-06-05,30119061,David,"I rented Susannah's beautiful studio for my brother and sister-in-law for their first visit to Seattle.   They loved their stay, and spoke warmly of the spacious and comfortable quarters.   They appreciated Susannah's helpfulness and the generous supply of snacks and food she provided.   We all thank Susannah for making their visit so pleasant."
5006092,34570926,2015-06-09,13890067,Enrico,"Great spot in Montlake, wonderful neighborhood with lush surroundings of green and beautiful gardening. Easy access to the bus and a very good Italian restaurant (cafe Lago). Susannah was an incredible host, the apt was extremely clean and comfy with a wide selection of breakfast items in the fridge! Absolutely recommended if you plan to visit the emerald city! "
5006092,35296343,2015-06-17,5574284,Marina,"Our stay in Susannah’s house was an absolutely perfect! We had a feeling of harmony and peace, as if we were at home away from home! 
It is hard to imagine but this house has everything you need and even more. The room is very clean and nice the furnishing is of good style. The bed is a fairy tale, wide and very soft with feather pillows and a blanket! Also there are softest carpet and warm, comfortable sofa, relax rocking chair in the room! The mini fridge is full of snacks and the kitchenette is a Tourist Dream! 
Susannah paid great attention to the detail from the cutlery to wine glasses and candlesticks. There are so many different large and small fluffy and soft towels in the bathroom, also gel, shampoo, toothbrush, hair dryer and even a red box with first aid for cuts! 
The room is so nice and cool in these hot days of June! Location of the house is one of the best, either you have a car or not. There is good transport connection and the bus stop. You easily can get to the center and the university.
Thank you Susannah for your hospitality, the comfort and coziness we felt in your house. 
Good luck to you and your family! 
Marina, Vadim

5006092,35883179,2015-06-22,2360503,Jimmy,"What a great place! The studio was very cute and had all the amenities  (fridge, coffee maker, dining room table, cable tv, on suite bath). Susannah was a fantastic host that made us feel very welcome and like we were home away from home. She fully supplied the fridge and wet bar with tons of snacks (juice, fruit, water, yogurt, etc.)! It was secluded with a personal entrance on the side of a house. And the house is on a wonderful quiet street. Definitely recommend!"
5006092,36470367,2015-06-28,2230731,Diane,"On a very warm spell in Seattle, this was the perfect spot! A basement studio that kept us pleasantly cool and comfy.  Located in a residential neighborhood and within walking distance to a great bike shop and one of the top coffee shops (Fuel) that we've ever enjoyed in Seattle. Altho we didn't meet Susannah, communication was excellent."
5006092,38302990,2015-07-14,5350210,Kathie,"We had a wonderful stay in Susannah's studio. She has a lovely home and garden and is an incredibly thoughtful host.

The studio has everything you could possibly need, including coffee, a huge selection of teas, toiletries, TONS of clean, fluffy towels.. and I could go on and on. The bed was gloriously fluffy with plenty of soft pillows. Overall, it's a cozy, comfortable space: the perfect home away from home.

Highly recommend a stay with Susannah. We'll definitely be back!
"
5006092,39840507,2015-07-26,25439806,Leigh,"I stayed in Susannah's studio for 2 nights and it was just lovely! There were delicious Rainier cherries waiting for me when I arrived, among other yummy snacks and drinks. The room was perfect and keypad entry made coming and going a breeze. Highly recommend!"
5006092,40117398,2015-07-28,3443366,Lindsey,"We had a very nice stay at Susannah's apartment in Seattle. The apartment is spacious and comfortable for two people. Susannah had the place stocked with so many snacks, which was much appreciated! 
The apartment is in a lovely neighborhood about 20 minutes from downtown. Street parking was very easy which was great for us. We did have a little trouble figuring out public transit due to construction at one nearby bus stop, so we mostly drove everywhere. 
There is just a door that separates the basement apartment from the main home so you can hear a bit from the kitchen, but it wasn't a problem for us. And the apartment has its own entrance, so it's very convenient and private. 
We didn't get to meet Susannah - but she was in touch frequently and did everything to make our stay great! Thanks!"
5006092,41095550,2015-08-04,8398106,Andrea,"The studio is spacious and comfortable without A/C even in the unusual heat last week. Others have commented on the care that Susannah has taken to make the studio welcoming, all of which are very true. I thought it worth mentioning that if you are 6ft or over you will have a problem in the bathroom where the ceiling is quite low. The mattress is very soft, but comfortable. Someone else mentioned the noise filtering in from the house and we did notice it. Would have preferred not, but it wasn't a huge problem. "
5006092,42931549,2015-08-16,39871504,Shawn,"Susannah ensured that we had all the info needed to check in. Her instructions were simple and 100% accurate. She greeted me when I came in and made sure that I knew that she was available for help anytime. Super easy!
The studio apartment was both spacious, clean, and welcoming. Susannah has some great notes on the space that help to clarify the use of the space and answered any question I could think of. 
She keeps the mini-fridge stocked with some convenient snacks, which was a welcome surprise.
The location was in a quiet neighborhood with a couple great places to eat just a couple blocks away. There was easy access to the Bellevue area across the 521 bridge. We were able to catch a bus to downtown Seattle at a stop just a couple blocks from Susannah's apartment.
In summary, this was a great find! A great experience, and we would stay again if the opportunity came up."
5006092,43283180,2015-08-18,23134330,Carolyn,"Pulled up to the house and was immediately smitten. It's an adorable tudor style house in a darling neighborhood. My friend and I could not get over how cute it all was. The rental unit is at the bottom of the house in a walk out basement. It has a private locked entrance and a fairy tale garden path leading you to the entrance on the side. The basement is just as adorable as the house. It had a comfy queen bed, full size couch that was surprisingly comfy, a tv, chair, suitcase rack, fully equipped bathroom, laundry room, large dining table that seats at least 6, maybe 8. The host is an artist (I think) and the place is decorated perfectly. She also left a stocked fridge, personal notes and has all the items you expect and some you don't expect (free toothbrush and other items in case you forget something!) the neighborhood was 7 minutes from a wedding venue I needed to be at on lake union. It was a great location, super close to UW, volunteer park and the arboretum. Can't go wrong with this one! "
5006092,44333125,2015-08-25,51526,David,Susanne's place is quiet and convenient. The basement is spacious comfortable. She left all kinds of delicious snacks and the laundry worked great. It was the perfect home away from home. 
5006092,45083310,2015-08-31,12286473,Rachel,"Susannah was gracious and responsive. Although there was no need to interact a lot, she was very responsive. Apartment is great, quiet, clean and very cozy."
5006092,46156687,2015-09-08,31353230,Becky,"Susannah's studio is a great place to call home while staying in Seattle.  The space is welcoming, clean, and spacious.  We loved the snacks in the fridge after a long day of travel :-).  Susannah is friendly and available if needed.  Montlake is a quiet and peaceful neighborhood that is convenient to downtown, Capital Hill, and UW - all using public transportation or Uber.  I will stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!  "
5006092,47043168,2015-09-15,35057532,Diana,"Susannah was a great host! She sent me very clear, easy to follow directions on how to access the apartment, as well as some parking tips. We got in with no problems, and got into our great apartment for the weekend! It was exactly as described and photographed. The unit had everything we needed - mini fridge/microwave, snacks, comfortable bed and furniture, bathroom stocked with necessities, etc. Susannah peeped out and said hi one of the days as we were coming in to make sure everything was great. Our friends staying further out at chain hotels were rightly jealous of us :) Thanks, Susannah, for making our first airbnb stay awesome! We walked up to Volunteer Park Cafe both days for breakfast. Cafe Lago 2 blocks away is GREAT for dinner, as well! We also stopped at Mont's Market for some beer - they have a lot packed into that little store."
5006092,47875817,2015-09-21,41503247,Nicole,"Susannah was 100% lovely.  

The studio is spacious and well stoked with cozy blankets, bubbly water and snacks.  This was my first air bnb experience and I couln't be happier!"
5006092,48792873,2015-09-28,25378738,Anya,"Susannah was such a wonderful host! My boyfriend and I stayed at her place over the long weekend and very much enjoyed it. Not only was everything just like in the pictures provided, Susannah went the extra mile by having a little fridge with complimentary snacks and water. The location is located in a quiet neighborhood, but it's only a 10-15 minute drive to downtown ($8-10 Uber ride). 
Fast and friendly communication. Would love to stay there again! "
5006092,54608206,2015-11-22,9895254,April,Susannah is so welcoming and the studio is close to a beautiful park and most importantly a good coffee house :-) The studio is very cozy and she supplied it so well we didn't have to think about a thing. Many little surprise extras were an added bonus. Highly recommended.
5006092,55924438,2015-12-07,7803447,Andrew,"Such a great place! Cozy, clean, inviting: it felt like home! Will definitely stay here again. Charming neighborhood, lovely apartment."
5048597,34183376,2015-06-05,23179322,Jon,"Great space, with lots of large windows and sunshine. Clean, very organized and Emma has great suggestions. Great location! Thank you Emma and Van!"
5048597,37759652,2015-07-10,29277545,Vicki,"The listing is in a great location near all the sites and very nicely decorated. Although pictures advertise a 'cozy pullout' we were disappointed to learn that the third bed was an air mattress. Also the toilet overflowed while we were there, it took Emma over an hour to respond to our text. There is also no central air conditioning but the portable unit in the apartment worked well to cool the place if you left all the room doors open. The place was fully stocked with kitchen and bathroom necessities and Emma did leave us  a little welcome snack and maps of the area. "
5048597,39343161,2015-07-22,32277210,Leif,"Accurate description, awesome place to stay. Good location. Very nicely furnished and taken care of"
5048597,39547132,2015-07-24,13394350,Rachel,Emma was very responsive to our needs and the condo was very clean and welcoming.
5048597,40230210,2015-07-29,36094093,Angela,"We loved this apartment! The location was beyond perfect for city sightseeing. Even our 6 year old could walk to all of the major hotspots. The house was spotless and the linens fresh. The hostess was always prompt with responses to our questions, and the info packet they provide has tons of great recommendations. I highly recommend!"
5048597,42541787,2015-08-14,14939469,Virginia,"The listing was accurate and everything was ready for us when we arrived.  Emma was super responsive, even when I asked her the same question twice (i.e. how do we check in)."
5048597,42975387,2015-08-16,14476954,Tracy,The host canceled this reservation 103 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5048597,43937854,2015-08-23,3962264,Yair,Emma was helpful and the apartment was awesome! Very spacious and very well equipped. I stayed with my boyfriend and my parents and we had all the room we could think of. The area of the apartment is very centrally located and we could reach all the best parts of the cities within a walking the distance. And the major plus of the apartment was the parking (!!!) in the middle of the city.
5048597,45252624,2015-09-01,4355197,Olli,"Emma's place was awesome! It was situated so close to the convention center that during our business trip we just walked there every day and grabbed some breakfast from the many brunch places and shops on the way.

Very clean, nicely decorated and extremely well equipped. I would defiantly come again when visiting Seattle for the next time!"
5048597,45569532,2015-09-04,20686337,Hyeri,"This place was perfect. Great location, spacious rooms and a bathroom. Clean and well organized. Everything you need will be there(towels, dishes, spices and even kids' toys). Thanks for the great place! "
5048597,46888254,2015-09-14,34416162,Els,"Prima locatie, ruim appartement, van alle gemakken voorzien zoals wasmachine, droger en volledig ingerichte keuken.
Emma reageerde snel toen bleek dat 2e paar sleutels miste, gelijk voor oplossing gezorgd.
Veel tips en wandelroutes aanwezig!
Advertentie klopt en Emma is prima gastvrouw."
5048597,47276297,2015-09-17,29929142,Shelby,"The neighbourhood was nice and conveniently located. The rental was clean and the directions were exact. The only thing I would change is how they are listed with 3 beds and bedrooms. The third bed is a pullout couch, which was comfortable but misleading. We loved all the Seattle information left for us, made planning very easy."
5048597,51285811,2015-10-19,5999576,Juan,Our time in seattle could not have been better and it is all due to the amazing stay we had at Emma's apartment. It was the perfect location to get around to all the sights and was extremely well kept and clean. Could have not asked for a better experience and will be sure to stay here again if i ever come back to seattle. Thanks again for everything!! 
5048597,52522453,2015-10-30,9650883,Gabriella,"Emma was very flexible with the self check-in, and the place is just as described: centrally located, great choice to explore Seattle."
5048597,55818207,2015-12-06,39069003,Christine,The location was perfect and was close to everything. Everything was walking distance including Pike Place Market. I'll definitely be coming back and renting out your place next time I'm back in Seattle!
5048597,56181296,2015-12-10,30892187,Nyndia,"Emma's place is very clean and lovely, all is well thought for us as travellers, the place has complete cooking set even spices, shampoo, conditioner, tissue and all the towels. Thanking Emma for providing us all essential things that we need. The sofa bed is not too comfy but the place is very nice for group of families indeed. Walking distance to everywhere. Just Surprise Seatle city I could see lots of homeless every where however the city it self is beautiful. We definately will stay at her place again when we come back!!! Thank you very much Emma!!!"
8863714,51241219,2015-10-18,25792873,Trudy,"Meagan was a sweet and communicative host. Her photos accurately represented her adorable home. The one bedroom, bath, living and kitchen areas were outfitted with all the amenities I could need. I appreciated that her home was super clean and very quiet near the thriving town-center of Madison Park. I had no problem with parking on the street. It was very easy to walk to the trendy restaurants and charming shops. I would definitely stay here again."
8863714,54623708,2015-11-22,47913941,Chante,The listing was accurate we had a great stay! Meagan was a great host and was very attentive and easy to get a hold of. The location was fantastic very safe neighborhood and convenient close to stores and banks! We really enjoyed our stay and would stay here again! We felt very welcomed and will definitely stay here again when we are in the area! 
8863714,55173049,2015-11-28,44195127,Karin,Meagan was accommodating with the arrival time and the location of the apartment is great. It was our first Airbnb experience and the level of cleanliness and conditions of the linens and towels left a lot to be desired. We got it for the location and that was perfect!
7970663,45183715,2015-08-31,1965840,Hailey,"Jaime's apartment was comfortable, in a lovely neighborhood right by Green Lake and Jaime was very accommodating. "
7970663,45911036,2015-09-06,12427589,Ian,"Some friends and I were planning to pass through Portland at the same time on different road trips and Jaime's house was a great spot to base ourselves during our stay. Very comfortable, accommodating home where I was able to work from the road and relax after hitting up downtown Portland. Definitely recommend this spot."
7970663,46570295,2015-09-11,10418912,Nancy,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7970663,47020587,2015-09-14,25134904,Justina,We needed a place to stay in Seattle last minute and found Jaime's listing. We were glad she was able to accommodate us on such short notice. She was very good about communicating how to pick up keys and find the apartment. The place looks just like the photos. Great location across from Greenlake Park. We only stayed one night so didn't have time to explore the area too much.
7970663,55305186,2015-11-29,5052902,Max,"Great location across from green lake, which was really nice to walk around, convenient to have food nearby.

The concerns about noise in the listing are intentionally cautious on the host's part, it really wasn't bad at all.

Bed was a bit soft for my taste, but everything we needed was present (sheets, towels etc).  Good wifi.

Host has an agreement with a nearby(ish) cafe to allow for key pickup if/when she's not around.  She was quick to communicate via email, and accepted and managed our booking on really late notice and over a holiday weekend, which we really appreciated.

"
7970663,55333152,2015-11-29,6170005,Julia,"Jaime accepted our reservation VERY last minute (thanks Jaime!) and everything was perfect. The house is as advertised, very quiet and in a great neighborhood. 100% recommend."
5249067,26646882,2015-02-16,25601875,Keely,"We didn't get to meet Mallory, but we really enjoyed staying at her place! The description she provides is spot on, it's a clean, cool apartment close to many lovely things in Seattle. "
5249067,27363685,2015-03-02,27860745,Alita,"Lovely little place. Easy to find. Beautiful neighbourhood, safe and quiet. Very close to downtown Seattle a quick car ride to all the great tourists attractions. Overall good experience. I would recommend this place to others as I enjoyed staying there very much!!"
5249067,40666405,2015-08-01,17778323,Roberto,The description was accurate. It's a nice and convenient place to stay in Seattle. Great experience overall. 
5249067,41001103,2015-08-03,1265670,Daria,"Nice space! Comfy bed, very cute, practical, gorgeous neighborhood to stroll through."
4061051,19448263,2014-09-12,8223591,Chris,"Jenny was a gracious host. Very clean, bright and modern home in the heart of Capitol Hill. Easy to get around by just walking or Uber. Thank you, Jenny!"
4061051,20477660,2014-09-29,682617,Brad,Jenny was a great host. Super accommodating and easy going. 
4061051,21366444,2014-10-15,11046051,Matthew,"Beautiful condo, great quiet neighborhood. With the tenant and her mother there, it was a bit noisy on Sunday morning when we had wanted to sleep in but otherwise a very peaceful stay."
4061051,21994256,2014-10-27,461461,Michelle,"My significant other and I were looking for a convenient and well appointed place to spend a romantic weekend in Seattle to attend a friend's wedding reception. Despite finding this to be a cool architectural and modern home, we were surprised by the degree of discomfort and lack of a amenities for our stay. 
The room itself was rather small. It was devoid of a dresser, night stands or any related furniture (only a small closet with too few hangers for clothes). The easterly facing windows had no shade treatment to block the morning sunlight or views from prying neighbors eyes (the bedroom is 15' away from the kitchen and living space of the house next door). The bathroom, while conveniently adjacent to the room had no towels and when asked, Jenny replied ""Oh, you need towels?""as if we should have traveled with our own. The towels we did finally receive were not fresh and had a sour smell from poor or neglectful laundering. And while I appreciate and respect the nature of this being a room rental in someone's home, we expect a similar mutual respect as a paying guest in return. To find a kitchen off limits due to the smell emanating from a sink full of dirty dishes and uneaten leftovers, an overflowing trash bin and multiple days of dirty pots and pans still on the stovetop from the previous few days, was appalling. And while Jenny respected our privacy with closed doors, we were awaken several times by her erratic schedule and heavy footfalls throughout the house and halls (as if a reminder that we were just guests, helping subsidize a mortgage payment and did not deserve the same care or respect one would show friends or family).

In short, we did not feel comfortable staying here and although the host was kind and friendly, did not provide the care, service or value for the cost. We would not recommend this listing and believed it to be far overpriced for what we received in return. Regretfully, a hotel would have been a better option."
4061051,22637073,2014-11-10,9617540,Martin,This is a beautiful house in a great location. Jenny was very professional and the stay was great. The mattress  is really comfortable. 
4061051,35560027,2015-06-20,31183275,Kevin,Jenny did a great job at coordinating our arrival and having the place ready. Great location next to Cap hill and rooms were just as described. Had a great experience and would definitely recommend if looking for a comfortable stay near downtown.
3852117,21618701,2014-10-20,1687291,Lindsey,"My boyfriend and I had an awesome stay at Lara's zen loft. It was just as she described, extra cozy and quaint with everything we needed. It's just like a tiny house! She told us when we booked that it didn't have a shower but we were only staying a night so it was no problem. She had coffee and snacks in there for us which was a nice touch. She was very communicative through the whole process and ensured that we were comfortable. I am definitely going to stay here again next time I visit Seattle. It was in a good neighborhood not far from downtown with easy access to the freeway as well. Thanks Lara!"
3852117,21774499,2014-10-23,22816319,Rodrigo,"Lara and her husband were extremely welcoming and went above and beyond to accommodate the three of us. I wouldn't call the loft small, but cozy and extremely inviting. Everything from the decor to the calming aroma in the room recalled feelings of home that were the antithesis of stale hotels. They gave us great recommendations for food and drink and even socialized with us when we ran into each other. Highly recommend and will return!"
3852117,21991630,2014-10-27,21980948,Aaron,"The stay was great and the little loft space was so cute! My girlfriend and I are driving from Arlington, WA to Portland quite often and we always stop for late lunch at Wayward café to one of the many other vegan spots that are right in the area. More often than not we wish we'd have booked a room to resume our drive in the morning. This was perfect for us and we'll definitely be booking again. "
3852117,22171420,2014-10-31,3642708,Robert,A very cozy wee house and just what I needed for a short stay where I had access to both solitude and the vibrant U district. A walkers paradise!
3852117,22212889,2014-11-01,15518718,Andrew,"Nice Neighborhood. Easily accessible by bus with an LA Fitness gym close by. The host, Lara, answered all my questions. A+."
3852117,22329519,2014-11-03,22760024,Jayme,"My host was warm and welcoming, very personable. They checked in with us throughout the week to ensure our needs were meet. When we arrived she gave us a tour and showed us how to properly set up things and how to leave the place. The neighborhood was great- short walk to whole foods, places to run, easy access to other neighborhoods in the city. "
3852117,22509826,2014-11-08,8532509,Samantha,Cozy and quiet place to unwind.  Very close to the University District! 
3852117,22552583,2014-11-09,7412871,Joseph,"This little loft made for a very unique and fun stay. Being just outside of the U District we were close to just about everything in the city. Lara was a fantastic and friendly host, making us feel very welcome, and quickly right at home. The Loft is on the smaller side, and does not yet have a shower, but for a quick overnight stay, that wasn't a big issue. The space reminded me of Country-esque Tiny Living, which we really enjoyed. Overall, this was a fantastic place to stay."
3852117,22638140,2014-11-10,23453230,Michelle,"What a wonderful and cozy night we had at Lara ' s loft! We were very comfortable and despite the size, the space feels roomy and airy and fresh! A tea kettle came in handy for a nice warm night cap and had it not been raining, we would have had a morning cup on the roof, as there is a ladder that leads to a bench to watch sunsets or morning crows... a lovely little touch. That's what you could expect, lovely little touches all throughout the space which makes you feel like you are home.   We will definitely try and stay here again if we ever rendezvous in Seattle again.  Thank you!!!! 
Michelle and Jesse"
3852117,22922667,2014-11-17,289953,Deb,The cabin is very welcoming--there are hundreds of tiny porch lights on to show the way. The listing is accurate. Note this is a small cabin but sufficient for the weekend. The immediate neighborhood is fairly quiet but Roosevelt is a close walk.
3852117,23001100,2014-11-19,14819751,Tim,"The tiny zen cabin was great, a cozy little spot to rest for the night, just what we needed.  Great host and a good location to go grab a bite to eat or drink.  "
3852117,23186402,2014-11-24,17294567,Cassandra,"Love the location! This neighborhood is adorable, with lots to explore. Lara was very accommodating and understanding when I realized that I had booked the wrong date. We arrived after dark and though Lara was out of town, her husband watched for us to make sure we found our way. All around they made it a stress-free stay."
3852117,23285125,2014-11-27,8303643,Carolyn,"Cute little space, great for a quick layover!"
3852117,23393939,2014-11-30,8696476,Mika,"Staying in a Tiny House made our stay in Seattle a unique experience. Lara greeted us upon arrival. She was sweet & attentive to all our needs. The tiny loft is exactly as pictured—cozy & comfortable. 

My husband loved sleeping upstairs in the loft & I found the futon & bedding provided extremely comfortable especially warm on a cold drizzly night. Even when it snowed, we stayed quite warm with the 2 heaters on. 

The location itself is great. It’s 10 minute walk to all the shops & restaurants on 65th street (Broadcast Coffee is a delightfully gorgeous space). Third Place Books Cafe/Pub is within a short walking distance. I highly recommend this space to anyone who doesn’t mind small dwellings. If you enjoy comfort, cleanliness, & privacy without breaking the bank--book this hidden gem immediately."
3852117,23468664,2014-12-01,13447096,John,"Lara's place was just as described: small, very cozy and comfortable, an extremely efficient use of space.  For a night or two it's great.  Lara says they're hoping to expand to add a shower which would make it fine for a longer stay.  One the night we stayed, the temperature outside dipped well down into the 20s.  We were warm enough and even though a space heater was supplied just in case, we didn't need it.  However the water pipes froze and we were without plumbing in the morning.  Lara invited us in for breakfast and use of the indoor facilities.  She plans to get the water supply insulated right away.  We loved our stay and would definitely stay there again!"
3852117,23614409,2014-12-06,19173052,Renaud,"This was an excellent place for my SO and I to stay in while visiting Seattle over 3 days (2 nights). The cabin is very cozy and welcoming. The neighborhood feels safe and is also very neat to discover. We came in at night and the pathway to the cabin was lit up for us which was super thoughtful. It is relatively close to downtown and we had no problem finding a spot nearby to park the car overnight. We are always on the move and therefore didn't get to spend lots of time in the cabin. We did sleep well though and there were lots of extra covers. The cabin is also perfectly suitable for those who would like to cook a meal.  There are ton of outlets and at the time of our booking we had the opportunity to use WiFi which was helpful for us to plan our day. Lara was a great host in making sure we were okay and checking in on us via email several times since we didn't get to met until the very end.

I would certainly recommend this to anyone staying for short periods of time in Seattle. I will not hesitate to contact Lara again next time we are in town needing a place to stay."
3852117,23667758,2014-12-07,23881567,Becca,Lara was such a sweet host! She came to say hi and give us the basic information of the cozy cabin and surrounding area but also gave us what we needed to keep in contact with her if we had any other questions. The space was just as described. Cute and quaint! It was a perfect place for the night in between visiting friends on my road trip. Thanks Lara! 
3852117,23730428,2014-12-08,12742152,Trina,"The zen cabin was exactly as pictured - cozy and charming! Lara was very sweet and accommodating and great at communicating with us. The location was great and walking distance to restaurants, book stores, whole foods market, etc. We recommend staying here. "
3852117,23778037,2014-12-09,24500101,Katrina,"My friend and I stayed at the Zen Loft it was perfect for us. Small cute space that's is used very wisely.  Two beds, small kitchen, fast wifi and a toilet. No shower but honestly we did not mind. Lara and John are great host I would stay them again and again.   "
3852117,23819928,2014-12-11,22164056,Jordan,"Lara was kind and welcoming! We arrived and she explained the cabin to us, confirming everything we'd read on the listing. We found it to be perfect for our one-night stay. Just enough room and amenities. :)"
3852117,23844015,2014-12-12,2546972,Julie,"Lara was an excellent hostess. Her communication was helpful and professional, and I felt quite welcomed into the space."
3852117,24665332,2015-01-01,17466636,Su Yeon,"Lara is very kind, funny and wonderful lady. She did everything to make us stay comfortably at the zen. The zen itself was very cozy and practically structured. We really enjoyed this place. Thanks Lara!"
3852117,24870081,2015-01-03,24464384,Davin,We had such a pleasant stay in Seattle and Lara was a great host! She wasn't home when we arrived but provided clear instructions and was very helpful and accessible via text. The Zen Cabin is very cute and I particularly loved the bench-with-a-view on its roof. The neighborhood was quiet and nice for walking. Downtown was a quick drive away. I would stay there again for sure!
3852117,25957388,2015-01-31,22012530,Erika,"I recommend this Tiny Zen Cabin in the city to anyone. I stayed here off and on for about 2 months. I loved it! Lara and John were very welcoming and made me feel very comfortable- especially since I was so far away from home. You will not regret staying here, my favorite part is that you can see the skyline if you climb the ladder to the top of the cabin- incredible view. Wonderful hosts and wonderful tiny cabin- it's nice and warm inside as well :)

3852117,26357454,2015-02-10,25402688,Kenya,"Perfect  place 15 min. from downtown! Fits three comfortably as long as your using it mainly for sleeping. Host was awesome, highly recommended! "
3852117,29081951,2015-04-03,22864993,David,Lara was great!  The zen cabin was a perfect overnight resting point for my wife and I during our adventures around the Pacific-Northwest.
3852117,29238759,2015-04-05,22089907,Hakan,Fantastik & warm & gracious!!
3852117,29948502,2015-04-14,10679078,Sarah,"Lara was really proactive and communicative about our stay and everything was lovely!  We enjoyed the little details and attention put into the cabin, the yummy tea, and the cozy beds.  Definitely recommend this as an easy and fun place to stay in Seattle!  We didn't actually meet Lara but she was in touch with us regularly and everything was smooth.  Lovely little place :)  Thanks!"
3852117,30163644,2015-04-18,19247536,Josh,Spring is beautiful in Seattle.  We enjoyed walking from the zen cabin to breakfast at Morsel in the U district.  Thanks for a nice spot to stay Lara!
3852117,30407225,2015-04-21,13063786,Dani,"Great spot! My partner and I loved staying at the tiny house and lots of great restaurants walking distance. 
Thanks so much!"
3852117,30950758,2015-04-29,29447131,Treva,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and it truly was an adventure for two 'seasoned' travelers.  Beyond all customary 'rituals' when checking into a hotel the 'quaint zen cabin in the city' was a delightful-personalized visit into our hosts home.  The zen cabin proves all you will need for a few nights stay, and the location is perfect for Seattle travelers!  We were lucky to spot our host and chat for awhile.  Lara is a thoughtful, honest and kind host.... and all visitors should be the same.  We recommend the 'quaint zen cabin in the city' to the adventous spirit traveler searching for a quiet location near all the best Seattle attractions!"
3852117,31603712,2015-05-07,22031688,Stephen,"The description is totally accurate! Stayed here a night with my girlfriend and it was nothing but peaceful. We ate dinner at Zeek's Pizza, which was very close on a street with many other places to eat and drink. The cabin was easy to keep at the right temperature and the loft was cozy and fun. Felt like we were playing fort or living in a little tree house bungalow. Really cool and ideal for couples who like tiny private living spaces.

Lara was really friendly and accommodating and you can tell she goes the extra mile to make the place perfect. She seems to really enjoy having guests, which makes any stay great! "
3852117,31655963,2015-05-08,14510253,Amy,"This cool little cabin is fun and one-of-a-kind.  It was positioned great for access to the University District.  I was in and out with very limited personal contact with the hosts, but they were clearly available had I needed to get in touch with them.  I really enjoyed sitting on the bench on the roof with the smell of lilacs blowing on the breeze.  Absolutely no complaints from me.       "

Lara was inviting, warm, and helpful, giving us tips about neighborhoods (we were first-time visitors to Seattle). The cabin was a great place to stay, the futon was very comfortable to sleep on and the location was great. I also appreciated finding a french press and coffee when I woke up after a long day of travel! A great stay. Thanks Lara!"
3852117,32265518,2015-05-16,31718786,Debbi,The Zen Cabin was cute and comfy -- we had so much fun there!  There were three of us and we had no problem flitting around in the space.  Made for a cozy get together at a great price!
3852117,33250252,2015-05-26,26757726,Ian,Lara was great and accommodating with the checkin time. The room was as described. Great neighborhood. Short walk to activities. French press coffee was excellent. Wifi worked great. Overall great stay. 
3852117,33533592,2015-05-29,15880952,Daniel,Really beautiful space and super cool.  The location is great and though you're in the city it's peaceful and quiet.  Highly recommend. 
3852117,33563957,2015-05-30,25815785,Elizabeth,The Zen Loft was so cozy and fun to stay in! Lara was great and made sure we were comfortable. We had a great time! 
3852117,34004092,2015-06-03,32132569,Mitchell,My girlfriend and I loved staying in the loft. It's small but amazing cozy and comfortable. Walking to the lake was amazing and access to downtown Seattle is a breeze. Thanks Lara for hosting us! 
3852117,34178099,2015-06-05,32862906,Ellen,"The Zen cabin was exactly the retreat space I needed. I contemplated on the couch, slept in the loft, meditated in the empty space upstairs, heard birds singing, saw the trees reflected in the panes of the cabinet, wrote a poem and a letter, savored the food and tea I brought with me, and stayed there from arrival to departure, only opening the door once or twice. It would be lovely with a sweetheart also. Met the host at the last minute, literally. I'd love to come back and I deeply recommend it."
3852117,34235225,2015-06-06,10139502,Deb,"Super cute little cabin! It's little but very cozy. We didn't use the loft because there were 2 of us so we just pulled out the bed in the main room. Sweet little city cabin. An outside shower of some sort would have made it that much better!

3852117,34544714,2015-06-09,32237037,Jessica,Very lovely experience! Lara is very accommodating and easy to communicate with!
3852117,34600131,2015-06-09,22445411,Devon,Great Lil spot and very cozy! Just what we needed after the long drive up :) thank you again!
3852117,34782539,2015-06-12,31946289,Harrison,"Tranquil neighborhood and great host. Even though we never saw the host, she communicated before and throughout the trip promptly. She's a model host and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. "
3852117,34977080,2015-06-14,33116811,Sonya,"We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Lara or her husband, but they were very kind to accommodate us and let us check in a few hours earlier than their usual check in time (we had a very small window of time between arriving in Seattle and having to attend a wedding event!)

The tiny house felt clean and cozy and the location in Seattle was perfect for our needs."
3852117,35307043,2015-06-17,22929975,Philip,"Stayed at Lara's for three nights. I was not there much, basically using it as a room to crash and keep my gear. The place is small and would be tight for two people. The elevated bunk bed which requires manoeuvring a ladder wouldn't be for everyone, and the lack of shower limits the duration of your stay, but the place for what it is, a place to crash is good. I didn't use any of the kitchen facilities but it looked reasonably well equipped. 

I had a rental car so I'm not sure of public transport to the place, but it is a about 7 miles from downtown. I did not meet Lara but she was always prompt with reply's. My stay was good and if by myself again I would go back to Lara's.

Gave us most helpful recommendations for our short stay. Very quiet and peaceful in a great location. A lovely park, lake and food coop close by. It's a tiny space but has everything you need if you can be creative about not having a shower. We slept on the pullout futon and were most comfortable. Closed it up and had plenty of space to make a nice breakfast before starting our day. Best way to do Seattle on a budget!"
