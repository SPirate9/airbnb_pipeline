231097,12739770,2014-05-10,10709055,Peter,We absolutely loved staying with Paul and Terry. They were very welcoming and helpful and their home is lovely.  Our bedroom and bathroom was completely private which we appreciated. Terry and Paul are a caring couple who obviously enjoying hosting guests.
231097,12927005,2014-05-14,10884951,CheongHun,"Paul and Terry were kind hosts. the room was clean and quiet, a little bit far from downtown. In the morning, with some breads and water, took a walk along Burke-Gilman trail, visited Beach park, which was a amazing place. "
231097,13798844,2014-06-04,15688743,Linnea,"As a first time airbnb-er, I don't think I will ever go back to hotels! Paul and Terry are wonderful, kind, and helpful hosts.  They are absolutely warm and welcoming, but will give you your privacy.  Their house is located in a beautiful, quiet, peaceful neighborhood filled with trees, and it's a great place to spend time in Seattle.  Definitely recommend to anyone who will be staying in the area!"
231097,14428155,2014-06-19,13586914,Lydia,I'd like to say thank you to Terry and Paul again. I booked the room for my roommate when my parents were visiting me in town. Terry and Paul are very friendly and helpful. My roommate enjoyed staying in the cozy room in their own house and the quiet neighborhood. I highly recommend Terry and Paul as your hosts. 
231097,15591987,2014-07-12,17053309,Laura,Very quite neighborhood. Stayed there 3 nights had a wonderful time
231097,15856818,2014-07-17,11646137,Carsten,"It was a great pleasure to stay in Terry's and Paul's cosy home in a nice neighbourhood. Paul and Terry were great hosts, always very friendly and helpful. Everything was nice and clean. When we come to Seattle again we would be glad to stay with Terry and Paul."
231097,16216472,2014-07-23,12574928,Han Zhen,"Terry and Paul are wonderful hosts. Everything is just as advertised. The room is clean, their house cozy, their suggestions on point, and their cats purrfect. I definitely recommend this place for future travelers."
231097,16370401,2014-07-26,93252,"Laurie With Husband, Steve","We thoroughly enjoyed Paul And Terry's beautiful home near Lake Washington. It was comfortable, clean, and offered just a short jaunt to the beautiful Burke - Gilman bike trail surrounding Lake Washington and much of North Seattle. We will definitely return again when coming to Seattle!
"
231097,16675057,2014-07-31,17791423,Jerry,This was our first time using Airbnb. It was a very pleasant and positive experience. Paul and Terry were excellent hosts. They were warm and compassionate. They also were available to answer questions about the Seattle area but also gave us space.  They gave us good tips about where to buy bread and a good sushi restaurant. The room and the bathroom were very clean. We will stay there again the next time we are in Seattle. Highly recommended.  
231097,17104121,2014-08-07,17246383,Leslie,Clean.  Nice people.  Easy to get to UW on 75 bus.  
231097,17247194,2014-08-09,19191156,Kristine,"This was an altogether lovely place to stay.  The location, a few blocks from the western shore of Lake Washington, was beautiful, and it was an easy bus ride from downtown or the U district.  The hosts were friendly & welcoming.  The house is beautiful & the guest quarters (private bedroom & bath, on a lower floor so very private) were immaculate, with a comfortable bed &  convenient desk.  I couldn't have been more pleased, and I would love to stay again in the future."
231097,18322319,2014-08-25,13337932,Tony,"First thing first, Terry and Paul are the best !!! It was our first real airbnb experience and we can only say it was by far the best !!! Trust us !!! In few words I'm going to be efficient and the more precise I can to sum it up : Beautiful house + very clean room with private bathroom very clean too + hosts very very friendly and helpful + leaflets about Seattle's activities and buses available in the room + nice and quiet neighborhood + if you want to discuss with Terry and Paul they are always down for it.
Everything was perfect even if perfection does not exist but seriously that's a real goooood deal. Sooo go ahead and book your room blinded eyes !!! 
Finally, I want to give a personal big shout out to Terry and Paul for their hospitality, their kindness and their availability, they are real good persons so they deserve real good guests !!"
231097,18810795,2014-09-01,10719681,Brian,"Good space, good neighborhood, incredible hosts.  My girlfriend and I stayed for 4 days in August of 2014.  We didn't spend much time in the house as we had a busy schedule: visiting the city and relatives.  Paul and Terri were great hosts.  They have been through the rigmarole in regards to different needs of their guests and have streamlined everything to make your stay as pleasant (but not overly intrusive) as possible.  Bus stop to downtown Seattle is nearby (although the connections make it ~45min to downtown) - i.e. this is not a place for staying if you want to be in and out, in and out all day.  Also, I am mildly allergic to cats but had absolutely no problem staying here (their cats didn't frequent the room).  We highly recommend Paul and Terri's place."
231097,18965813,2014-09-03,20308330,Shmuel,"the place is very nice also the neighborhood around. Terry and Paul were very kind and gave us full freedom and privacy, we actually saw them very little and it felt like we have our own private space. The area is very green and we have the chance to imagine how it would be living in Seattle. We really like it all."
231097,19102387,2014-09-06,16831057,Natalie,"My friend came to visit for a few days and I reserved Paul and Terry's room for her. Their house is very secluded in a quiet neighborhood and great location - not too far from downtown Seattle and close to U Village and Northgate. Paul and Terry are very friendly, nice people. Great to talk to, wonderful hosts. Their house is beautiful inside. My friend said it was a nice, quiet place, clean and cozy room and bathroom, the perfect place to unwind after a long day out. I would definitely book here again!"
231097,19224035,2014-09-08,19842796,Brigitte,It was a peaceful place and Paul was a welcoming host. The room is nicely furnished and very clean. His recommendations for dinner and how to walk there were very accurate. The room is quiet and easy to access. 
231097,19368242,2014-09-11,18189494,Allison,Paul and his wife are wonderful hosts. They respect our personal time and let us use the kitchen and leave the common space for us when we are cooking and having our dinner (so sweet). We had a great time and enjoy their friendliness and smile:)
231097,19684313,2014-09-16,6601377,Robert,"Hosts were very helpful on phone assisting with late arrival.  The accommodations were very nice, private, and secure.  The location was especially perfect as is very close to our Seattle family.  Although the kitchen and living areas were available for our use, we didn't need them as we spent most of our time with family. We do wish we could have spent more time talking with and getting to know hosts and hope we have the opportunity to stay with them again on our next family visit. "
231097,20101513,2014-09-23,20229024,Poul,"Our first go at AirBnB and definitely not our last. We liked Terry and Paul's approach of requesting info from and about us to ensure an optimal fit. In doing so they signal that they are quite particular about whom they let into their home. We liked that.
Everything worked well - from being welcomed through check out four days later.
They are very informal and don't push themselves upon their guests. But they are also there for when you have questions.
The room was as described: a little on the small side, but ok for two.
Neighborhood very quiet which we appreciated. Parking space reserved for us. Relevant info in room.
The price / quality ratio was spot on."
231097,20511067,2014-09-30,20387034,Linghua,"Thank you Terry and Paul, you are so kind and warm, make me feel wonderful at the start of my vacation,we can use kitchen and laundry，the house is so beautiful and comfortable, if you will come to China please let me know!"
231097,22099993,2014-10-30,20428689,Vikki,"My arrival was late in the evening, I was greeted warmly & shown to the very nice accommodations. The house was  beautiful & the neighborhood was quiet. Paul & Terry were there if I needed anything. I came & went as I pleased, and the lights were always left on for me. I would recommend them to anyone.
"
231097,22347811,2014-11-03,23150005,Angela,"Paul and Terry were very gracious and welcoming hosts.  The room was comfortable, and private.  The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful.  I also especially enjoyed the color of the changing leaves.  "
231097,22886438,2014-11-17,21134004,Deborah,"Paul greeted us at the door and briefly showed us the room and a nice, concise info sheet in the room.  It was very sweet and comfy and looked even better than the photos.  The room and bathroom were very clean and everything we needed was there.  Both he and his wife were very nice and helpful.  The neighborhood was great and was very convenient to where we had a work project.  Wish I had more time to take advantage of the closeby parks and hiking trails!  ""Peaceful"" was the perfect ame for this place and we got great rest while there for three nights.  We hope to stay again next year when in Seattle."
231097,24246476,2014-12-23,15527171,Rachel,"Absolutely delightful! Paul and Terry are the kindest and most considerate of hosts. The room is charming and very comfortable, the neighborhood beautiful, with a ""magical retreat in the mountains"" feel."
231097,26105803,2015-02-03,1544536,Leo,"The Peaceful NE Seattle guest room is exactly that: peaceful.  It is located on the lower level away from the rest of the house with exclusive use of the adjacent full bathroom (well appointed with a full tub and overhead shower).  Paul and Terry are gracious hosts and we had use of the kitchen and a bit of the fridge so that we could take of our own breakfasts.  

The two cats are friendly and no problem.  I have a mild cat allergy but the room was free of cat hair and will remain that way if you remember to keep the bedroom door closed.  The NE location was ideal for us, near friends in the same neighborhood and also 15-20 minuted from downtown along the 522 (which is strangely nearly empty even when the 5 is barely crawling...).

To top it off, we had a dedicated parking spot while we stayed there, off of the narrow lane-way.
"
231097,28523144,2015-03-25,27944863,Yan,Paul and Terry are really nice and welcoming hosts. Fresh air and peaceful environment surrounds the house! It's convenient to take bus No.75 and transfer to downtown.
231097,31247122,2015-05-03,2152222,Sehar,
231097,31842655,2015-05-10,595748,Benjamin,Paul & Terry are really friendly and helpful hosts. We had a great time while staying there. The area is beautiful and calm - and so is the room. Thanks!
231097,33281977,2015-05-26,26804179,Amir,"Paul was a wonderful host. 
I arrived very late, and had a busy schedule but Paul was always easy going and accommodating. 
One the personal level I found a very nice and interesting person. 
The room was very nice, very private and a pleasure to be in. 

"
231097,33866338,2015-06-01,19833204,Madison,"Paul and Terry were perfect hosts. They were both so welcoming and accomodating while also giving us space in just the right balance. They have a wonderful home, the room is very comfy and it is really nice to have your own bathroom. Their two cats are very sweet! They let us have full use of the kitchen to make meals which was a luxury for us as we had been on the road for a while. The house is in a nice, quiet neighborhood but you are an easy 15 minute drive from downtown Seattle! "
231097,34353462,2015-06-07,34288900,Kevin,Everything was accurate on the listing. Paul and Terry were very gracious and kind hosts. Definitely made me feel at home and comfortable. 
231097,34869129,2015-06-13,31360347,Linda,"I felt welcome and enjoyed brief conversations with Terry and Paul. They were busy and so was I, so we made good use of our brief times together. They respected my privacy and provided a lovely and convenient place for me to stay at a very affordable price. This is my first experience with Airbnb and it was very positive. I'll definitely be using it again. "
231097,35949198,2015-06-23,27035797,Camilla,Terry and Paul were super hosts! We really enjoyed our stay. They gave us ideas what to do in Seattle and they make us feel home. Thanks! 
231097,36806895,2015-07-01,35179519,Jason,"Paul and Terry's home is incredibly comfortable.  The neighborhood is charming and quiet, and is close to public transit.  Both hosts are wel"
231097,37559280,2015-07-08,1544536,Leo,"This is our second time here, so obviously we liked it the first time.  This is becoming our home-away-from-home in Seattle.  Paul and Terry are great hosts and we really enjoy talking to them.  Their place is quite and relaxed and the room and adjacent bathroom are very private."
231097,38918575,2015-07-19,37754329,Wai Mei,I am so glad that i can be staying in this guesthouse for my five day journey in Seattle:) Terry and Paul are very friendly and kind :) the view around the house is fascinating :) I wish i can be staying there for a longer time :) I am gonna stay in the same place if i am going back anytime :) 
231097,39793928,2015-07-26,29657244,Sandra,"paul and Terry were gracious hosts, we visited the first night, they showed us where everything was.  The room was comfortable, although. A clock would have been nice, and a bath mat also.  the neighborhood was very quiet and secluded, but we didn't have trouble finding it.
"
231097,44442146,2015-08-26,22784078,Chiaki,Paul and Terry are so nice! Guest room was comfortable and lovely. I'm so glad that I could stay there!!
231097,44831842,2015-08-29,41484022,Zero,"Terry and Paul are definately great hosts. They made us feel quite comfortable to stay at the place. We felt that three nights passed  so quickly. The room was nice and quiet. They even prepared torch, eyemask, tourist guides and coupons in the room. Also, they kindly gave us help on a special request. We strongly recommend their house to you if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle.
房子很棒，房东很好，价钱便宜，强烈推荐。"
231097,45476972,2015-09-03,38166033,Fabian,"Paul and Terry were great hosts. We stayed for 5 nights in Seattle and everything was exactly as listed in the description. The area is quite relaxing and nice to walk around while not being far from the city if you have a car. 
We had our own bathroom and enough space for two people. The kitchen was spacious and they provided us with everything we needed for cooking. Terry's advice even saved me from getting sick! :)
We suffered a longer blackout in Seattle during the storm, but they gave us lamps and told us that they are here in case we need anything. 
Overall a very enjoyable stay! "
231097,46146833,2015-09-08,39047429,Tomomi,"Paul and Terry are very nice and kind host. I had great time in their house. Private room and bathroom are very clean and nice. 
 
They warmly welcomed me. We have talked about what we did today, family and life etc... almost every night . I really liked the time I talked with Terry.  Thank you very much for everything !!! "
231097,47083682,2015-09-15,41618307,Duncan And Helen,"Great place to stay and to explore Seattle from.

Situated in a quiet and friendly neighbourhood. Open plan living is on the upper ground floor. Air bnb bedroom and private bathroom are below and accessed by a few steps just inside the front door.

Bedroom and bathroom were clean, tidy and homely.

Paul was welcoming, helpful and relaxed. The sheet provided to us had the WiFi code and bus details.

Buses to the centre and to the university district are close by. We didn't encounter any problems or draw backs during our stay."
231097,47509854,2015-09-19,7042414,Susan,"I had a wonderful stay.  The room was peaceful and clean, and Paul was very welcoming.  Paul was readily available by e-mail to arrange to pick up the key and showed me around the house upon my arrival.  The cats Louie and Halle were cute and friendly.  The desk and closet came in handy.  The room came with its own bathroom, which was nice.  All in all, it was a great stay.  I highly recommend Paul's place.  Thank you!"
231097,48176494,2015-09-24,35375796,Meredith,"This was a great place to stay for a few days. Our hosts were very friendly and welcoming. They have two sweet cats who I enjoyed spending time with while missing mine.

The pros:
The neighborhood is quaint and near a park. 
The hosts are great. 
The room has a private bathroom next to the room. 
The room has its own heater and is quite private. 
There is a designated parking space for airBnB guests.

The cons: 
The bedroom is downstairs so you can hear the hosts walking around at times.
The neighborhood is about 30 minutes from downtown.
There is no tv in the bedroom.

We didn't mind the lack of TV as we were in Seattle to see Seattle and in the evenings before bed we read or did crossword puzzles.
We would recommend this room to others. "
231097,49674098,2015-10-05,40642577,Yuting,Great host! House is nicely decorated! Very cute bedroom and clean bathroom. Lovely cats!
231097,51215999,2015-10-18,46105447,Jodi,Terri and Paul were wonderful hosts. Coffee was in the morning and they made me feel very much at home. Their home is beautiful and I was able to enjoy my stay and come and go as I needed. I came to help my daughter pack for moving and their home was very close to my daughter's house. When she finally picks a place to rent I hope it's nearby so I can come back and stay here during my future visits. Thank you for hosting my stay here in Seattle!
231097,54310418,2015-11-18,39668556,Iris,"Paul and Terry are wonderful hosts,They help me a lot with English,They invited me watch movies with them and showed me their family  pictures,They are very patient and kindhearted.I hope I can stay here some day.Thank you very much Terry and Paul!"
8453633,55448712,2015-12-01,46896748,Kaycee,"Nicole and Sam made us feel very welcome! Check-in was super easy and their home is so cute. I had never been to Seattle before and I'm really glad we stayed in Capitol Hill - it's close to a ton of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, and book stores, and Nicole gave us a great list of places in the neighborhood to check out. It was the perfect place to get a sense of Seattle. The house was comfortable, clean and warm. "
5978498,37307636,2015-07-06,31620726,Kim,"Absolutely loved our stay here!  This place is incredibly peaceful, private, comfortable and welcoming.  This is a house to write a book in.  Windows all around look out on lush greenery and allow for some very pleasant cross ventilation.  Everything about this house from the fabulous kitchen to the generous shower is better in person.  
The neighborhood is a very nice, quiet and residential.  Definitely safe.  I never had a chance to walk around the area to check out the shops and restaurants, but I believe they are fairly close.
The house is basically built into the side of a cliff which is part of what makes it so private, but the steps down could be intimidating for some.  Still, I can tell you that my niece visited us with one foot in a cast and made the trip down the steps with no problem.  And the steps are lit up at night. 
Silvia and her assistant Christina were both very pleasant, accommodating and a real pleasure to work with.  I hope that I will have a chance to stay there again.  Highly recommend! "
5978498,38340567,2015-07-14,5822176,Alan,"A great place, a bit different located in a secluded spot down a set of steps that are not for those with problems walking...as if in tree house but not, isolated and quiet but within the easy reach of the main road for the bus. Warm and welcoming, like a home. Easy comes despite my host being in Italy. I was on my own but it would be great for a couple wanting some space away. Good location with good transport connections
good parking for those with a car..."
5978498,41328305,2015-08-07,10511658,Maria,"I love this house. Thanks to Silva. This house is perfect and big, in a beautiful area were you can spend the days just wallking and enjoying the view. You can see the ocean and the trees. The house is paceful, loveling, quietly and has everything perfect to enjoy your days in Seattle. This house has the Silvia's spirit: she is a very kind, respectful and shine person. "
5978498,46294213,2015-09-09,25867158,Ruth,"We were comfortable in the house and enjoyed the neighborhood, especially the Macrena bakery, with great coffee, treats, breakfast and lunch!"
5978498,47749211,2015-09-21,27907415,Paul,"The place was awesome! Comfortable accommodations, charming decor and welcoming vibe. Perfect location as it is in a good neighborhood with great little restaurants nearby."
5978498,51635407,2015-10-22,20530291,Lauren,Beautiful house in a beautiful city.
5978498,55220735,2015-11-29,23694453,Sue,"Silvia's home is beautiful and comfortable.  The location of the home on the West slope gave it a peaceful and private feeling.  We were surprised at how steep the stairs are to get to the home and they could use some additional lighting for safety.  The one item missing from the description was the fact that the master bath (which is lovely) is directly connected to the sleeping area (no doorway between them).  If you are a light sleeper who shares a bed with an early riser you may find yourself waking up sooner than you hoped you would.  This was not a huge issue but I would have liked to know the set-up in advance.  Silvia wasn't home when we visited and we would have enjoyed meeting her.  When we emailed her with questions she replied promptly which we greatly appreciated.  The location is, as described, fabulous and we enjoyed walking to Macrina bakery in the mornings. "
5978498,55622764,2015-12-03,1424578,Connie,"Silvia's house is very private and cozy. And the design is very unique. We enjoyed the kitchen and the awesome view from the deck. But the same feeling as other reviewers, we were surprised at how steep the stairs are to get to the home and they could use some additional lighting and maintenance for safety. (it is a little bit slippery after the rain and I had to use phone lighting at night) Thus for any one with heavy luggage, I would suggest thinking before booking.  Also, since we came during winter time, the ""basement"" bedrooms seemed too freezing. We even set the air conditioner to 80 one night, but still, we felt so cold downstairs. And the hot water turned cold suddenly one time when I was taking a shower. It is not a big deal if it is in Summer, but with the freezing room temperature, it is not a pleasant thing.

Overall, we love her home. The neighborhood is quite and safe and it is close to tourists attractions and cafes. With this reasonable price, we can just bear the cold water etc."
1428687,6897386,2013-08-29,6928901,Charles,"  Green Lake Oasis is a great location to enjoy greater Seattle.  Around the corner is Tangletown, with its assortment of interesting eateries and other commercial enterprises, along with a bus stop for a quasi-express public bus route to the Downtown Pike Street Market area.  The apartment itself is a new lower-floor renovation with all you need to have a comfortable stay...fully furnished kitchen, washer and dryer, TV & associated entertainment equipment with telecom service subscriptions, and so forth.  Plus the fact that the couple who own it are wonderful hosts.  
  One (email hidden)tting to and from the outside entrance to the apartment is not a handicapped-friendly process.  The house itself, as is the case with many in Seattle, sits rather abruptly up from the street, so there are several concrete steps to climb to get to house-ground level.  Once one has traversed those few feet, there are a few more concrete steps down to the side-entry to the lower floor.  Guest parking on the two-sided parking street is made easy by the hosts, however, for they leave an open parking spot immediately in front of their own street-level garage and adjacent to the ascending steps, available specifically for their apartment guests.  Go to the Oasis for a unique neighborhood experience! "
1428687,7163314,2013-09-09,1418137,Kelley,"Steve and Terry were amazing hosts.  This apartment is such a wonderful place to stay.  My mom and I arrived to a bottle of sparkling water, a bottle of wine, and a chocolate bar.  It is a perfect location, blocks from Greenlake and down the street from my favorite coffee shop Zoka.  I would recommend this place to everyone visiting Seattle.  "
1428687,7723470,2013-09-30,8990963,Jessica,"Steve and Terry were great, and the stay was very pleasant. Quiet stay in a great location. Couldn't have asked for anything better!"
1428687,8459003,2013-11-01,7642034,Shawn,"We recently relocated back home to Seattle after a couple of years in San Francisco.  Terry & Steve's Airbnb was the perfect landing pad for us.  We stayed for 4 weeks and the place really felt like our home away from home.  Thank you for being so welcoming to us and for providing such a top notch experience.

Everything about the flat is so well thought out and Terry and Steve are the nicest most welcoming host!  We enjoyed taking advantage of the close proximity to Greenlake as well as the excellent neighborhood restaurant selections.  Whether you're in town for a few days or a few weeks, this place is a winner.  

All the best to you, Terry & Steve!

Shawn & Katie"
1428687,8521067,2013-11-04,8638060,Amy,"This was a great little apartment!  Clean,  quiet and very bright with spacious living and bedrooms areas.  We loved the new kitchen and bathroom - very well-appointed and everything we needed for the long weekend.  We slept on the sofa bed and gave our daughter the bedroom, but we could have easily set up a twin air bed in the bedroom had we wanted the regular bed.  We loved the Greenlake location as it was central to lots of Seattle neighborhoods we love to visit.  Steve and Terry were responsive and thoughtful hosts, helpful when we made the reservation with neighborhood and house info.  They even had Halloween candy for our daughter upon arrival!  We will be back when we visit Seattle again!"
1428687,9439687,2013-12-29,8989240,Holly,"The apartment was well-equipped and comfortable.  Everything we needed for a week's stay was available.  The place is very convenient to Green Lake Park, and is within walking distance of a great coffee shop, a restaurant, and some shopping.  We didn't meet Steve and Terry until the last day, but they were very nice and sent a text message to be sure we arrived and everything was ok.  We will definitely return to this apartment."
1428687,10077678,2014-01-29,7857658,Chris,"Great place. We had a wonderful time there. The unit was super clean and had pretty much everything we needed for our stay. 

Perfect location is an understatement! So close to many good places to eat. All within easy walking distance. I would highly recommend and without a doubt, would stay there again. Thank you!"
1428687,11446088,2014-04-03,6162998,Sharyn,"This really was our home away from home while in Seattle. The neighborhood was wonderful. Quiet, safe, comfortable. We probably made too many trips to the nearby donut shop (but they were delicious!) and enjoyed an amazing dinner at the nearby Japanese restaurant. We lucked out with some decent weather and took advantage of one sunny day by taking a walk around Green Lake. It really felt more like we lived there - so much better than a crappy hotel! The beds were comfortable, the kitchen fabulous for cooking in, the bathroom was great (including the handy washer & dryer) and overall the unit was just the right size for our party of three. And Zoe and her partner were helpful and fun to talk to."
1428687,13190772,2014-05-21,5191327,Kristin,"My family stayed here while they were in town for my wedding. It was perfect - easily walkable to everything in Tangletown (coffee, beer, food, even donuts) & Greenlake, with easy access to the bus downtown.

The apartment itself is quite well appointed and well designed/decorated - very comfortable for 2 people or 2 couples. The neighborhood is pleasantly quiet. Also, Steve & Terry have provided many extras that help with full enjoyment of the neighborhood & Seattle (including an umbrella and picnic & grilling supplies).

Overall, would definitely recommend to others who want the Seattle neighborhood experience. :)"
1428687,13815680,2014-06-05,2665104,William,"The listing was exactly as described, perhaps even more so with nice welcome amenities provided upon arrival. The apartment has anything you might need. Advance communication is thorough and professional, description of how to access the apartment is right on. The neighborhood is a gem featuring a mini-market, brew pub and several excellent restaurants. Our host was unobtrusive until the final morning when we had a lively chat. This is a quality accommodation that will provide comfort, quiet and relaxation. "
1428687,13923914,2014-06-08,8514975,Leiha,"My friend and I live outside of Seattle but our other two friends were visiting from out of town and we wanted them to experience more of Seattle and decided to go thru AirBnB so we could stay in Seattle instead of spending precious vacation time driving back and forth. It was a fabulous decision. Steve's house is perfectly located and really gave a feel for Seattle living. We were greeted with wine and chocolate when we unlocked the door and their book had great information and instructions. The house was clean, with lots of seating for when our other friends came over for a girls night of eating and gabbing. I would whole heartedly recommend this property to anyone looking to travel to Seattle. "
1428687,14043237,2014-06-10,8575117,Cynthia,"We would highly recommend Steve & Terrys flat while visiting Seattle. All the comforts of home! The neighborhood is safe to stroll day or night! Eclectic Tangletown neighborhood offers coffee shops, pastry shops (Mighty O Donuts) restaurants, and local neighborhood bars.  Hidden back off the beaten path! Greenlake is an awesome place to hike, stroll, chill or enjoy the water sports. It was a very pleasant weekend retreat!"
1428687,14909093,2014-06-29,14587504,Tom,Steve's apartment was everything as described and had a well equipt kitchen to make our stay as much like a home away from home as possible for our family of 4.
1428687,16669805,2014-07-31,17346510,Frances,"We enjoyed our stay in Green Lakes, especially the Lake.  It reminded me of Boulder, CO.  There was lots a recreational activites from morning to dusk, plus green spaces to nap and simply relax.  The apartment was cozy and gave us enough room for our family.  We dined at the neighborhood eateries, and the travel by bus to downtown was a breeze.  The neighborhood was quiet and safe.  Steve and Terry were great hosts, and helpful with questions. "
1428687,16848788,2014-08-03,2300265,Jennifer,"Steve's Green Lake Oasis was a perfect spot for my husband and I to stay while visiting Seattle.  The apartment itself was clean and well appointed. Our host even thoughtfully left a bottle of wine, some chocolate, and fresh flowers to welcome us! We enjoyed having a full kitchen so that we could cook a couple of nights with our finds from Pike Place Market.  The neighborhood is quiet, and the proximity to Green Lake makes it a nice getaway after a day of sightseeing.  It was just a quick drive to the waterfront and is also conveniently located near the Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods. I would highly recommend Steve's rental, and I would happily stay there again!"
1428687,17197429,2014-08-09,3172621,Suzanne,"My husband and I had a relaxing stay at your beautiful flat. We had plenty of room to entertain our son and his girl friend when they walked over. Kitchen was great along with the heavy duty folding table and chairs, where we played cards. The Wi-Fi worked smoothly for getting work done. The over all cleanliness, quietness and uncluttered warm atmosphere was welcoming. The wine and chocolate was delicious. It was a nice greeting when we arrived."
1428687,18751704,2014-08-31,10234390,Kyle,Perfect location literally 2 blocks to Green Lake and killer food. The apartment was clean and updated with a beautiful and clean bathroom. Hope to stay here again soon and highly recommend to snyone going to Seattle. The neighborhood is amazing. Quaint and cute.
1428687,18959683,2014-09-03,7365157,Saied,"Steves apt was great.  Spacious, clean, and very nice gesture of wine and chocolate.  Great sushi, and coffee places down the street.  right accross the street from bus stop which takes you downtown.  "
1428687,21462226,2014-10-18,19653698,Patricia,"If you want to feel at home while visiting one of the hippest locations in Seattle this is the place! My husband and I enjoyed being within walking distance to great restaurants and the beautiful Green Lake Park. 

The apartment has every amenity you will need including a washer/dryer. We were welcomed with flowers, wine and chocolate by the owners. The apartment is quiet, cozy and completely modern. "

Great location within 2 blocks of Green lake for running or biking, a block from a few fun restaurants and the best donuts we have ever had. You can get the bus up the street to downtown.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and chocolate. The space was extremely clean and well appointed. The cute little patio had both a gas grill and a charcoal grill. We highly recommend Steve and Terry's place!
"
1428687,36219868,2015-06-26,35578681,Andrew,"We had a great experience at Steve's basement apartment. It was very clean and Steve and Terry had left flowers, chocolate, and wine to welcome us. They were extremely accommodating to our schedule, allowing us to drop off our luggage early and check out late to meet our travel needs. They were very responsive to any questions we had while we were there, both in person and via text. "
1428687,38650862,2015-07-17,8728244,Amy,"The apartment was impeccable and looked exactly like the pictures. It was quite lovely and unexpected to find a bottle of wine and chocolate upon arrival. We appreciated the list of neighborhood restaurants- there are many dining options, coffee, and even a brewpub within a few blocks! We didn't make use of the available Netflix and DVD collection, but it was a nice option to have. We took the bus which was a couple blocks away and gets downtown very fast. Uber made visiting other neighborhoods incredibly simple. We also rented a car for a day to check out Mount Ranier park - enterprise is less than a mile. All around, this was a wonderful experience! I'd happily stay again! "
1428687,40938034,2015-08-03,36514841,Christina,"This was a fantastic place to stay. The location was great, with Green Lake down the road, and lots of cafes and restaurants just around the corner. The flat was perfect for our needs, nicely furnished and clean. Highly recommended!"
1428687,41324553,2015-08-07,30223608,Janice,So glad we stayed here! The apartment was bigger than we expected and it felt like we were the first people to ever stay here - it was so clean and there was no clutter. The bed was super comfy and the kitchen and living room were very spacious. Steve was great - got to talk to him a couple of times and he gave us great ideas of where to eat and what do do in Seattle. The neighborhood was great - walking distance to lots of restaurants and a pretty easy ride to downtown Seattle.
1428687,43761217,2015-08-22,33201429,Jen,We had a wonderful time at this Green Lake rental.  It is a lovely area with restaurants and coffee shops nearby and we really enjoyed hanging out at Green Lake.  Our hosts were very accommodating. Our oldest daughter had to bring her cello along on our vacation to practice for a very important audition and they didn't mind at all.  Their hospitality was greatly appreciated and we would highly recommend this rental to others! 
1428687,49912107,2015-10-07,24534200,Andrew,"Even though the apartment was in a lower level it was light and airy, on a quiet street and immaculately clean. A book with suggested restaurants and happenings was appreciated. We stayed four days and look forward to returning soon."
1428687,52217232,2015-10-27,15103252,Polly,"We had a great stay at green lake oasis, our third time there! Cozy, comfy, great location for our Seattle visits!"
1428687,57998508,2015-12-31,24741456,Beth,"The apartment is exactly as described and had everything we needed while we were in town to visit family. Wine and chocolates were on the counter to greet us. The neighborhood has coffee in abundance, a short walk away. The bus stop is also very close. There is a binder full of information and Steve made sure we could reach him if needed (which we didn't). The bathroom has a heated floor which was an unusual and nice touch. As mentioned in the write up, there is an on-street parking spot for your use.  Due to the narrow streets in the area, I would recommend against having a large vehicle (which isn't a great idea in Seattle anyway)."
3394338,15283392,2014-07-06,13218150,Kat,"Adam was a sweet and generous host. He was super available and pleasantly flexible in terms of logistics. The studio truly is folksy and cozy, with everything you might need (dishes, pots, pans ... even an iron, a guitar, and art supplies). It's a great space for a couple or a single person. The garden is also great, and in nice weather it doubles the size of the living space. The location is very accessible to downtown sightseeing and Pike Street nightlife. There's 2 hour parking on the street during the day, but you can park overnight, so it's very doable whether or not you have a car."
3394338,16215180,2014-07-23,3108777,Tommy,"My mom and sister stayed at Adam's studio while visiting me in Seattle and they just loved it. It's a very cozy and cutely decorated place, and the private outdoor area was so nice to hang out in. The location's great, too. My family really enjoyed staying in the residential neighborhood instead of a hotel downtown."
3394338,16417120,2014-07-27,12359326,Charlie,"We were in need of a place to stay for a weekend wedding and rented Adam's apartment. We couldn't have been happier! The place was cozy, fun, and in a great area. I would highly recommend the place!"
3394338,16846823,2014-08-03,3812649,Rachel,"We loved our stay at Adam's studio. It was such a peaceful and creative space and we were lucky enough to get the weather to make the most of the wonderful garden! Just a short walk from bars, restaurants and galleries and we also walked downtown in 20 minutes or so. Adam was a great host! "
3394338,17283957,2014-08-10,5015378,Beth,Adam was helpful and friendly.  He worked with us through an emergency situation.  
3394338,17845214,2014-08-18,17741285,Kasha,"I can't say enough great things about Adam and his folksy garden studio. When my husband and I arrived we were amazed that the studio was picture perfect. Adam left us a welcome guide, listing home info tid bits and local goodies to visit.  After a long day exploring,  it was awesome to be able to chill in the garden.   It was my first time using Airbnb, this experience ensures that I will be using it again.  Thank you Adam. "
3394338,20096020,2014-09-23,553696,Arturo,Beautiful apartment in a great location! The description and pictures of the place convey the space very well and Adam is a prompt and thoughtful host... Absolutely perfect.
3394338,21553288,2014-10-19,8303643,Carolyn,"Adam's place is cute and cozy and feels like home right away.  Really enjoyed staying here at the end of a long work trip.  Adam's place is centrally located, but also feels tucked away.  Perfect combo. "
3394338,22628138,2014-11-10,7021682,Alex,Adam was a grade-A host with a phenomenal studio that was immaculately clean and every bit as folsky and homey as shown in the photos. Places with this much charm and uniqueness are what make Airbnb great. Minutes away from some great restaurants and tucked away from the street.
3394338,28619279,2015-03-27,120458,Claire,"Adam's studio is adorable.  When we checked in he'd left us a nice note, and a short guide with some great recommendations of places to eat, drink, and check out.  The studio is in a great neighborhood within walking distance to everything one might need or want.  Great restaurants, bars, sights, all just a stone's throw away.  Nice and quiet as well.  He provided us with coffee, as well as all the tools one might need to stay in for the night.  Very well appointed, and beautifully decorated.  Everything was just lovely.  Adam was also very communicative during our stay, but not overly so.  It would have been nice to meet Mr. Tenderfoot, but he was away.  Perhaps another time."
3394338,33248252,2015-05-26,1846120,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I spent the weekend at Adam's studio and I wish we could've stayed longer, it is definitely one of my favorite spaces we've stayed in since joining Airbnb. The apartment itself is like a mini art gallery and we loved how everywhere we turned we were met with something beautiful and inspiring that was created or curated by Adam. He's a gracious host that was easy to work with and left us a thorough welcome guide with recommendations for a bunch of cool spots in the neighborhood to check out. I would highly recommend Adam's studio for anyone looking for a clean, cozy and centrally-located space to stay in Seattle. I'm hoping we get to stay here again!"
3394338,33297285,2015-05-26,8998698,Jason,The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3394338,34981669,2015-06-14,4908487,Roshan,Adam's place was wonderful.  It's exactly like the pictures show.  Adam was accommodating on our late checkin and was responsive to questions.  We made use of the fire pit outside and enjoyed hanging out at the house.
3394338,36563894,2015-06-29,34615612,Sheila,"Adam's place is perfect. Beautifully decorated and so comfortable. Close to great restaurants,  convenient to downtown Seattle and all the sights, but yet in a quiet, lovely neighborhood. The yard is a big plus - we spent many hours just relaxing outside. Even with record breaking temps in Seattle, the studio stayed nice and cool. Adam's suggestions for dining out were very helpful. A great find all around! "
3394338,39176111,2015-07-21,13532446,Eric,"Nice and cozy, backyard with a downtown view, great stay, great host, great city!"
3394338,39759393,2015-07-26,1193087,Lauren,Had a great time in this cozy studio in a great neighborhood in Seattle. Adam was incredibly helpful and welcoming. Would highly recommend to anyone! 
3394338,40586078,2015-08-01,11852161,Allison,Adam's apartment was clean and beautifully decorated. The pictures and description were accurate. He was extremely responsive and we had no trouble at check in or check out. Much better than an over priced Capitol Hill hotel!
3394338,42133897,2015-08-11,14847892,Aaron,"The place is immensely sweet. Looks and feels just like the picture, it is an easy place to hang. The bed is great, the shower is strong and the vibe is good. The outdoor area is sweet, we were there in august and the weather was amazing. 

Adam has many lovely things throughout the place, really great objects in a rather small place. This means you don't have much space to put your stuff as a guest, so don't bring a lot of stuff!

The neighborhood is tree lined and very close to some great bars and restaurants. It is the hood you want to be in. We walked everywhere.

One thing to be aware of : this is a basement apartment and it does have the dampness you might expect with that that, there is a slight tinge of musty-ness to the air. It is something we go used to quickly but noticed every time we returned to the house. Adam has a de-humidifier which keeps the place from feeling stuffy but If you were hyper sensitive it could be an issue.

"
3394338,43232605,2015-08-18,34823475,Alex,"Adam's Folksy Garden Studio was worth every penny. Not only did we have a lovely space all to ourselves, we also had a small yard to hang out it and enjoy the nice weather. His space was also incredibly close to great restaurants and shops. There was never a dull moment during our stay."
3394338,45394674,2015-09-02,24342181,Marco,"Adams apartment was very cute.  It is in a great location close to the best bars and restaurants. Parking was easy,  we rented a car for two days. The decor was very kitschy,  and the studio was ground level,  with a private entrance and a fire pit/front yard. Very charming place"
8501705,48474369,2015-09-26,20488068,Austin,Space was as advertised and fine for the two of us. Wifi and TV were good. Brian was a good host and a great communicator. Location is perfect if coming to town for a sporting event and you only need basic accommodations. The walls are a bit thin and the building is old with a very slow elevator. If you don't want to spend a lot this is a great option but be aware this is not five star hotel. 
8501705,48660942,2015-09-27,31306839,Greg,"Brian was an outstanding host, and a proactive communicator. I ended up arriving slightly later than expected due to traffic, and he was very understanding. The place was as-advertised and clean. "
8501705,48824866,2015-09-28,22781384,Federico,"We had a very good stay at Brian's! The place is exactly as described, tiny but very well located. The area is quiet and full of Asian restaurants, very close to the train station and to the train for the airport, as well as to Downtown Seattle. And the bed is so comfortable! Brian was very nice: he ensured we had a prompt access to the room and was always available for any need. Thank you Brian!"
8501705,50150797,2015-10-09,45689166,Mark,"Brian was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  The place is exactly as described.  Small but clean, comfortable, and in a good location.  Perfect if you are visiting without a vehicle.  A block away from train station and light rail.   Thank Brian."
8501705,50353222,2015-10-11,40123394,Matthew,"This place was great!. It was close, easy and convenient to get to all the seattle attractions."
8501705,50733701,2015-10-13,258258,Adam,"Brian was very easy and pleasant throughout the whole process. His communication leading up to the stay was outstanding, and he was very flexible with the check in time. He met us on site and showed us the apartment. Location is a unique location; close to stadiums, restaurants and a short walk to some of the cities sites. Finding a parking spot was also simple. He also very close to the central train station, which would be very convenient for those traveling by train or bus. "
8501705,51172002,2015-10-18,762779,Rich,"Brain's place was perfect for us! We didn't spend much time there since we had so much we wanted to do and such little time with which to do it all, but it's really close to the stadiums and a bunch of transit options, which was fantastic. The place was also well equipped with essentials, including Netflix access and we didn't find ourselves wanting for more. Would definitely rent again if available for future visits."
8501705,51333086,2015-10-19,32532064,Alisha,We stayed here for one night. The space was unique and fun. It was small but had everything you needed and was  a fun city feel for two people from the country.  The  details made the stay. Brian was very flexible and easy to communicate with.
8501705,51555524,2015-10-21,7840821,Christine,"Our stay with Brian was exactly what we were looking for - a place to crash for a day exploring Seattle and an early airport start the following day. The flat was easy to access and in a great location (especially if you're visiting for a game!), and we found it a great base for exploring town as well as evening drinks in the Pioneer Square Area and guaranteed late-night cheap eats in the International District. The area was a little rough at night with quite a lot of people hanging around on the streets and/or begging. So I would advise being alert, particularly if travelling alone. However, I also think this is to be expected around any transport hub/downtown in a major city. Communication with Brian was great and he was a very friendly host, leaving information guides in the flat and providing tips in person - we would definitely recommend him!"
8501705,51758562,2015-10-24,29108660,Dobee,"Brian was a great host. He met with the key as planned. The apartment is exactly as described, very comfortable and cozy, and perfect for my needs. I was attending a soccer game at the stadium which was a ten min walk away. There were many places to eat nearby. The neighborhood was a little sketchy walking home late at night so best to pay close attention to surroundings but that is the case in many urban neighborhoods. I was up early and was able to walk to the ""light rail"" station five mins away which took me directly to the airport in 30 mins. I would certainly stay here again in the future. Thanks, Brian!"
8501705,51936046,2015-10-25,44693964,Kate,"Great little apartment, very basic and has everything you need. Lots of food nearby, and it's within walking distance to the Showbox SoDo which makes it perfect if you're coming out overnight for a concert. I'd definitely stay here again!"
8501705,52091979,2015-10-26,39480991,Clint,The apartment is nice. Very easy to get around from the location. Brian is nice and very helpful.
8501705,53869655,2015-11-13,29953867,Akela,"Brian was a great host and accommodated us on very short notice! The apartment was clean and comfortable, and offered a binder filled with information on local attractions. We took the Bolt Bus from Portland and it dropped us off two blocks from his home! The neighborhood was great--lots of restaurants and bars, and we walked downtown and to Capitol Hill from the location. Thanks for making our night in Seattle a great one!"
8501705,54073090,2015-11-15,48532254,Mauro,It was an awesome little appartment and we enjoyed the netflix.
8501705,54212466,2015-11-16,44965755,Garrett,Brian was very accommodating.  I booked the apartment fairly last-minute and he was flexible about meeting up for me to get the key.  The room was very accurately described and I found it to be comfortable.  I was expecting the neighborhood to be a little dicier by his description but I found it lively and perfectly nice.
8501705,54860217,2015-11-25,3638590,Valerie,"Brian's little apartment was perfect for our needs and in a fun and convenient location. Check in (and out) and communication was a breeze. He had space in the fridge and in some cabinets for us, which doesn't always happen when renting someone's space. Staying in the international district was a blast, and the food was great!"
8501705,55461469,2015-12-01,48580138,Michelle,"Had a great time in Seattle. The TINY apartment was just perfect for my husband and I.  Brian is not lying.  The place is MINI, but just right for 2 people.   Brian was very helpful with any questions I had.   Perfect location if you are coming to town for a game!  Yummy fried rice and bubble tea just steps from the door!  "
8501705,55608062,2015-12-03,4165451,Jeff,Perfect little flat in a great location. Perfect if you want to walk around Seattle. 
8501705,57735749,2015-12-28,48885781,Jeff,"Amazing. What a great guy. Our plane was delayed. Brian met us at 1am with the keys. Then the guy let us leave our stuff after the checkout time so we could tour the city!!! Great guy, perfect place for downtown. 5 minute walk to the Seahawks game"
8501705,57836135,2015-12-29,6212727,Charlie And Lindy,"Just what I needed for an overnight layover. Brian was very accommodating on check in time, the neighborhood is really unique, and if you need to head downtown it's not very far. Description was accurate: tiny place, but perfect if you're only planning to sleep there."
8501705,57969851,2015-12-30,46969496,Gina,"Brian was great! He was very fast to respond to any questions and was super flexible with our arrival/departures times. The description of the apartment is accurate, it is definitely small. However, if you are looking for a warm, comfortable place to sleep at night while exploring a city, this is the perfect spot for you! "
8501705,58103154,2015-12-31,18020578,Bryan,"The apartment great! Just as described. Had everything we needed and Brian always responded very quickly. After we checked out, we had an emergency that required us to stay in Seattle an extra night and Brian went out of his way to allow us another night for free due to the circumstances. Incredibly generous and kind host. "
5682316,31002169,2015-04-30,30979394,Orlina,"Elyse and her husband were extremely welcoming and communicative in ensuring all our needs were met.  The location of the space was very convenient for us as our family resides in the Columbia City/Rainier Valley.  Light rail access was a hop, skip and a jump which allowed us to hit Pike Place Market for a hot minute and jump back to the southside with the quickness.  The space was pristine clean to the max and stocked with the essentials which allowed us to cook our meals through the week.  We never had to ask for anything during our stay. No Pets which is helpful for us because of our allergies to pet dander.  Privacy gets Five Stars too.   Next time we’re in town, we hope to stay with Elyse.  As we would expect with this amazing guesthouse, they’re already booked during  our next weekend in town so we’ll have to book early."
5682316,31218955,2015-05-03,24464582,Daisey,"Very accommodating.
Nice clean and quiet place.
Elyse was quick to respond to any concerns.
"
5682316,32363273,2015-05-17,3355724,Nicola,"We just came back from a wonderful long weekend at Elyse's Guesthouse. It is everything pictured & described. The Guesthouse itself is beautiful & very comfortable. Elyse has thought of everything. Under the bed drawers to unpack your bag, french press with coffee & creamer in the fridge. The light rail is so close and getting into downtown is very easy. We enjoyed a leisurely day in Columbia City. We walked to the main street, had a delicious breakfast at Geraldine's & enjoyed a long walk on the Lake Washington loop.
Communication with Elyse was great. She was very responsive! Unfortunately we never got to meet as she was out of town for part of the visit & was kind enough to let us stay and had a local contact for us if we needed anything. I look forward to meeting her in the future, as I hope to stay here again!"
5682316,32796481,2015-05-21,33582840,Marisa,The guest house was sparkling clean with plenty of towels.  Upon arrival we were welcomed by written recommendations for places to eat and things to do nearby.  Columbia City Bakery might be heaven on earth.  The link light rail stop was very close by which made it extremely convenient to access downtown.   This private little spot was exactly what we wanted and expected.
5682316,33211119,2015-05-25,16150290,Lisa,"The Guesthouse was better than expected! Thoughtfully appointed kitchen, decorator details, everything was new! It was a pleasure to stay. The address is VERY close to the transit rail line, and only took 10-12 minutes to arrive in the best locations in downtown Seattle. The neighborhood surrounding the home is quiet, the view was better than shown in photos, towels were new/plentiful, bed was very comfortable. The host was very attentive when I had a question. Our privacy was respected, and we had our own key. I would stay here again, and strongly recommend to all my friends."
5682316,33813038,2015-06-01,26408486,Garrett,"This guesthouse was the perfect place to stay during our PNW trip. It was exceedingly clean and well-kept. The hosts thought of everything, even down to having shampoo and conditioner available. The hosts were available for any questions or suggestions, yet gave us our space. The location is stellar; we were within walking distance of some amazing restaurants and a few steps away from public transportation. We wouldn't have changed anything about our experience, and we will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again!"
5682316,34033029,2015-06-03,22339190,Kandy,"This was the first time we stayed at an Airbnb, and Elyse has set the bar high for future Airbnb stays for us!  Her guesthouse is beautiful and well appointed!  She communicated well with us throughout the entire process.  We generally stay in a downtown hotel when visiting Seattle, however, the perks of staying at this cottage instead were long and satisfying!  It was easy to get to with a ton less traffic than driving all the way into downtown, it was quiet and check in was much easier than a hotel.  The Link Light Rail station was a short walk and got us into downtown in less than 15 minutes during rush hour!  We did some shopping, had dinner and was back to the cottage before dark.  After checking out, which was just leaving the key where we found it on the counter, we walked to the suggested Bakery a few blocks away for our much loved morning ritual of coffee and pastry...I had the most amazing Bostock pastry EVER!  Our stay was short, so we didn't meet Elyse this time, but we'll be staying there again for sure and we will hopefully meet next time!"
5682316,34098483,2015-06-04,34319918,Renee,"This charming guesthouse was delightful.  It was bright, clean and simple.  It was a perfect size for the two of us during our one night stay in Seattle.  The location isn't far from downtown Seattle and close to public transportation.  We didn't make use of public transit but it was a short walk to the stop.  This guesthouse is located in the neighborhood of Columbia City which had several restaurants, great bakery and delightful farmer's market on Wednesday evenings.  We were able to take advantage of the market and it was wonderful!  The street was a buzz with families enjoying food and conversation.  Definitely a family oriented neighborhood.

The hosts were very helpful during our stay. Although we didn't meet Elyse, she communicated very well with us!  We were able to meet her husband Earle and he was very helpful.  He even gifted us with a bowl of fresh strawberries from the farmer's market.  Super helpful and very welcoming.  The guesthouse was very clean and had everything we needed for a pleasant stay.  They even included robes for the stay.  Overall, the stay was great and we definitely recommend the guesthouse."
5682316,34477882,2015-06-08,30693968,Jasper,They were so very kind upon our arrival and the accommodations were very modern and up to date inside of the residence.  The parking and location was very convenient and close to downtown with only a short commute.  Very prompt on responses and any concerns that should surface.  A very nice and cute stay! Excellent and Enjoyable!
5682316,34858866,2015-06-13,390877,Emily,"This place is terrific! It's private, comfortable and well-appointed. Plus, Columbia City is probably my favorite neighborhood in Seattle - it's convenient to downtown (via light rail), very walkable, has the best bakery in Seattle, and a diverse selection of restaurants. 

Elyse was a great host. She checked in with us to make sure we had everything we needed, but otherwise gave us our space. We stayed there for a week and really couldn't have been happier with the experience.  "
5682316,35087691,2015-06-15,30939220,Anthony,We had a great stay at this Columbia City guesthouse. The entire house was sparkling clean. The bed and the futon were both comfortable. The location is great in a quiet neighborhood. The light rail station is about a block away which makes getting to and from the airport or downtown very convenient. Elyse's dining recommendations were spot on and she was very responsive to messages. This is definitely a place we would stay at again. 
5682316,35554779,2015-06-20,31557531,Steven,"Very nice stay, we couldn't have picked a better place. The little one bedroom was perfect and fit 3 of us comfortably (of course I got the futon). Elyse was very quick to text back when I asked her something, she even brought us an ironing board and iron. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
5682316,35813149,2015-06-22,33326446,Vivian,"This was my first AirBnB and it was a great experience. Checking in was a breeze! I thought it would've been more complicated, but she gave me the details I needed before I arrived. The place was super cozy and my boyfriend and I were sad to have to leave. We explored her recommendations and Geraldine's Counter Restaurant was amazing! Her other restaurant recommendations were also spot on. We only stayed here for 2 days and were rarely in the guesthouse, but we did take some time to lounge on the futon and just relax. 

Elise was very respectful of our privacy and only contacted me once to check if I needed anything. She was also very willing to answer any questions I may have had and although everything was fine I'm sure she would done anything to make sure we were comfortable. 

If i were to visit Seattle again, I would definitely try and book her place again. "
5682316,36038662,2015-06-24,11609707,Darlene,"My mother and I stayed at this charming apartment for two nights.  It is very clean, everything looks brand new!  The apartment is as it appears in the photos.  There is no TV and no AC, but in Seattle you don't really need it.  Wifi worked very well, was able to catch up on my shows on my iPad without any issues.  We used the light rail for transit to Seattle, literally a block away.  We did use a taxi to get to the airport, which cost us $40.  Elyse and her husband were wonderful and kept us in the loop with any happenings and emailed to make sure everything was all right during our stay.  Would definitely stay here again!"
5682316,36190469,2015-06-26,33242297,Suse,"Elyse was a pretty welcoming host . I arrived here with my Dad. We had a warm welcome full of hospitality. From the first moment we felt like home. The apartment was awesome and really clean. 
There is a good access to public transport. We would definitly recommend a stay here.  Thanks Elyse."
5682316,36385735,2015-06-28,31800390,Elyse,"I chose this guesthouse because the location was perfect being just 1 block from the Light link rail, it's only a 5 minute walk to the hub of the charming Columbia City neighborhood, and the house itself is immaculate. The hosts were accommodating with my early arrival time and even compensated when a contractor appointment went over and impeded the beginning of my stay. They checked in via AirBnB and text minimally to see if I needed anything. I also enjoyed a list of recommended restaurants and attractions they provided. Would definitely recommend this AirBnB!"
5682316,36892887,2015-07-02,35256925,Kimberly,"This was my first experience with AirBnb and it could not have gone smoother thanks to Elyse and Earl! 
They were incredible, quick at getting back to me prior to the stay, advising on next steps and directions leading up to the visit and checking up on us half way through our stay to make sure everything was okay. 
When we arrived to the cute cozy guesthouse Elyse had typed out instructions for the condo and a full list of suggestions for the area. We ended up using half of her suggestions and we were not disappointed! 

The guesthouse was clean and everything was easy to find and in order.  They really went the extra distance and overall we would definitely stay there again or recommend to our friends and family! 
"
5682316,37151031,2015-07-05,31466318,Marie,"We had a lovely stay!.  It was truly a charming Seattle guesthouse.   We were visiting family in the area and it made it easy to visit, yet have time on our own. 
We loved the fact that it was all so walkable. We were 2 blocks or so from the light rail which gave us aces to downtown Seattle and the airport. We were also easy walking distance to downtown Columbia city with its delightful restaurants and the Columbia City coffee shop."
5682316,39916766,2015-07-27,17882632,Sarah,"A great experience! Elyse provided instructions well in advance for a seamless check in. The guest house itself is beautiful, and had everything you could need while away from home. 
The location was perfect for exploring the adorable neighbourhood of Columbia City, and also had great access to the link light rail to get downtown or to the airport. 
Thanks for an amazing long weekend! Coming back to a Seattle, I would definitely stay here again! "
5682316,41741692,2015-08-09,31599668,Diana,"The space was exactly as described. Sunny & bright, very clean, cute space.  Elyse and her family were friendly and kind and went out of their way to make my stay as pleasant as possible, including installing a screen door so I could leave the door open for the breeze, and upgrading the wi-fi connection to make it faster. They even covered the skylight when Seattle got unseasonably hot so that the space would stay cool!  Wonderful hosts, wonderful space.  Loved listening to the birds every morning.  Quiet neighborhood, excellent location, outstanding stay."
5682316,43363510,2015-08-19,34197585,Debra,"Elyse and Earl's little cottage is fabulous!  Very comfortable for 1-3  people. Lots of very thoughtful personal touches - everything we wanted for our comfort was provided. It even has a washer/dryer. 
The location is great too. 3 minute walk to the link rail, wall which takes you to many stops throughout downtown Seattle, and also goes to the airport, which is VERY convenient. We did not even rent a car. Also within walking distance are the Columbia City restaurants and shops. I would highly recommend this place, and I hope to be able to stay there again."
5682316,43551952,2015-08-20,9507893,Danyel,"We had such a wonderful stay! The guesthouse is beautifully appointed and feels like a luxury hotel. Plush towels and robes! Elyse was a pleasure to coordinate our stay with although we didn't have a chance to meet in person. Her recommendations for places to eat nearby were awesome! We had an excellent dinner at Watercress. And in the same complex, we had ice-cream and played pinball at Full Tilt. Our only regret is not having more time to enjoy the space. Thanks, Elyse!"
5682316,43764139,2015-08-22,12064767,Ashley,"My mom and I stayed at Elyse's guesthouse during our brief trip to Seattle. After a small hiccup with the stove/oven (which was resolved quickly), we enjoyed our stay! Elyse was super attentive and really thought of everything, down to the well stocked kitchen and bathroom. The place is super cute! I loved the tile in the bathroom and the custom shower curtain. :) "
5682316,44292127,2015-08-25,2045444,Leeanna,Loved this place. Everything was perfect- very clean and beautiful little cozy guest house perfect location and distance from the city and Elyse was the perfect hostess
5682316,44735242,2015-08-28,27898566,Meggie,"The guesthouse was adorable and a great place to stay. We had a car with us and we're spending time with family who were staying downtown, so did not get to know the neighborhood, but the house itself was perfect. We are especially excited to have a washer and dryer as we still have a few days left of our trip and have been away from home for over a week. "
5682316,46698559,2015-09-13,33227522,Judy,The listing description was accurate.  We found our way around after the first day.
5682316,47468711,2015-09-19,20577802,Moose,"What a delightful little cottage!!! Everything is so fresh, new, nice! The kitchen is complete and very well supplied with cookware and tools. The washer/dryer was just in time, after the first leg of our trip. 

Downstairs are a comfy bed and lovely bathroom and high windows for both privacy and light. The upstairs room has so many windows it's light even on a typical rainy Seattle day, although most of ours were nice.

Immediate neighborhood is residential - and really quiet. But not far to  'Historic Downtown Columbia City', with several restaurants, a consignment shop that had way too much nice stuff that attracted us, and a few other shops.

If you like Thai, Vietnamese, and other oriental and ethnic restaurants, this is heaven. We weren't there long enough to scratch the surface of interesting looking ethnic restaurants in the area. Thai Savon was wonderful, enough to warrant a second visit. Best Pad Ke Mow (drunken noodles) I've ever had, by far.

When the weather turned colder, Elyse immediately offered more bed covering, but it wasn't needed. 

Did I say delightful?  It's really a beautiful space.
"
5682316,47681798,2015-09-21,821798,Chris,"Excellent. Fabulous. Charming. 
We loved our two night stay at this Seattle guest house. It had everything we needed and more. Easy process ""checking in"" and ""checking out"". The hostess was even nice enough to let us have a package delivered to the house and kept her eye out until it arrived. 5 stars! Wouldn't change a thing. "
5682316,48322447,2015-09-25,1572649,Chris,"My Mother and I spent 4 days here. I slept on the futon on the main level and my mom in the bedroom on the lower level. The guesthouse is very charming - it's cozy and well appointed. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook when we didn't feel like eating out.  Elyse even had fresh flowers on the bar when we arrived! The washer and dryer were an added bonus. The neighborhood was quiet. We took advantage of the restaurant recommendations and ate at Tutta Bella . Because the house is located so close to the light rail, we were able to easily get into Seattle and to the airport without using a car. Although we were unable to actually meet Elyse and Earl, communication was friendly and prompt.  Next time I vacation in Seattle I will most definitely see if this place is available!"
5682316,48527972,2015-09-27,40234246,Lizzy,The guesthouse was immaculate! It even smelled clean. Elyse has thought of everything and the place is very comfortably appointed. She was super available and cared about providing what we needed. I would definitely stay here again!
5682316,49209820,2015-10-02,8617461,Alice,"Elyse and Earl's Charming Seattle Guesthouse is the perfect place to land in Seattle! It was immediately welcoming and homey, and provided a comfortable place to sleep, cook, and work. The Columbia City neighborhood with restaurants and coffee shops is an easy walk, and the light rail to downtown is close and efficient. I plan to make this my home-away-from-home when traveling to Seattle!"
5682316,50125236,2015-10-09,45381531,Annamaria,Great and wonderful place to stay! Very quiet! Incredibly clean and really impressed with the property. Please stay here you won't regret it
5682316,50295919,2015-10-11,28501703,Monda,"We could not have been any happier with our stay at Elyse and Earl's Guesthouse. It was indeed charming, but that doesn't begin to describe it. It is well equipped, extremely clean, comfortable, trendy, and located in a great spot. We walked over to Columbia City and dined at several of the restaurants and bars, it all had a great ""locals"" feel to it. I think what we appreciated most was just how easy it was to access the guesthouse and its surrounding neighborhood. We have already recommended this spot to a few friends! Thank you for having us Elyse and Earl! "
5682316,51479925,2015-10-20,27956599,Sarah,"Elyse and Earl have such a cute spot. It is so bright and clean. It's a very quiet location and incredibly easy to get downtown. They provided a detailed binder with restaurant suggestions and the sweetest part was walking in to a bottle of champagne, local chocolates and a small vase of flowers. We were on our honeymoon so I'm not sure if it was standard or special to help us celebrate, but it was very memorable. "
5682316,52768161,2015-11-01,8625912,David,Very attractive wonderful Airbnb property. A little out-of-the-way in Columbia city but very easy light rail public transportation to downtown.  The property is extremely comfortable and attractive and has a well appointed the kitchen. Only very slight negative for me was no TV.
5682316,55154941,2015-11-28,2304977,Delores,"The picture and description are accurate.  The Guesthouse is charming and comfortable.  There were many touches that made our stay pleasant.  One of them was the radiant heat flooring.  It made it easy to get out of bed.  And, the cottage was spotless.  We highly recommend this place."
5682,30686,2010-03-21,60393,Jingchuan & Achille,"Very sweet outgoing host with a nice family and a cute dog :) The room for rent is cozy and convenient, at an amazingly affordable price! Maddy also did her best to accommadate us and make us feel like home. I would definitely recommend my friends to be her guests and would like to stay on my next visit."
5682,40794,2010-05-08,105863,Ronaldo,My first experiemce at airBnB and was great. Maddy and Michael are lovely and kind people.the place good locate and the apartament perfect.Just a good way to have fun and special time at Seattle 
5682,42150,2010-05-13,121372,Alexander,"Very nice and clean room that includes private bathroom. You will have all privacy in the world.
Location is excellent - 10 min from Downtown and only few minutes away from fabulous Alki beach. Great close-by French bakery (on California Ave.) is a great place for breakfast.
Thanks for everything, Maddy!!!"
5682,47516,2010-05-29,128506,April,"Great place to stay for a low price and easy to find. Maddy was a great host and even let us use the kitchen for cooking breakfast. There were nice touches that would make anyone feel at home including water bottles, ear plugs and such. Waaaaay better than staying in a hotel, I'd stay there again :) "
5682,49368,2010-06-03,89570,Brianne,Maddy was a great hostess.  She met us when we arrived and was very accommodating.  We had just come from the coast and our shoes were so wet.  She was kind enough to let us use her dryer so that we would have shoes for the rest of our stay.  She provided cold water and small snacks.  She even let us use her parking spot.  The room itself was quaint and so clean.  It was really nice having an attached bathroom.  I would definitely recommend Maddy if you are ever staying in Seattle.
5682,51044,2010-06-08,37243,Dana,"Maddy was an absolutely fabulous hostess.  The room was very nice with a private bath, very secluded.  Convenient to bus line and downtown -- would definitely stay there again!"
5682,53462,2010-06-15,136524,Rod,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the place is close enough to Seattle to make this a great launching pad. The room is very nice, private, and very comfortable. Thanks Maddy!"
5682,56050,2010-06-22,57259,E. Chloe,"Maddy is an incredibly welcoming host. She is warm, friendly, and full of helpful information. The room is very comfortable - I slept really well. And the location is so convenient - the bus stop is RIGHT there, and it takes just 20 minutes to get downtown. I couldn't recommend Maddy and her place more highly!"
5682,58836,2010-06-29,113816,Jennie,Maddy was a GREAT host who went out of her way to help in any way! Picking us up from the airport was a huge help. She gave us a lot of advice on places to go and best ways of getting there etc and was always there when we needed her. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed. Having your own private bathroom and fridge was a real bonus! As someone else stated we also had bottled water in the fridge and other little things that made the stay great. The only small thing we could say was that we hear a lot of traffic from outside but overall we had a great experience and would definately recommend and stay there again. Thank you so much Maddy! Pringle the little dog is a little cutie! :-)
5682,60500,2010-07-03,156010,Brenda,"Home away from home with some very friendly hosts!!! We enjoyed the room and bath very much...very comfortable, extremely clean, very thoughtful(provided brochures of the Seattle area and local events, and super affordable!!! I plan to bring my husband to the Seattle area and will hope that Maddy's place is available...would stay there again in a heartbeat!!!  Will be referring airbnb and Maddy's place to everyone I know!!! THANKS SO MUCH!"

5682,71422,2010-07-31,144556,Justin,Maddy was a very sweet hostess and our room was perfect for what we needed it for. It was amazing to be able to have a good night's rest after such packed days of touring Seattle. I would definately recommend this room to  anyone wanting to tour Seattle. Thanks Maddy!!
5682,75221,2010-08-07,162244,Raechelle,"We loved the place and Maddy was an amazing hostess.  Every detail was thought of and we felt very at home.  Very clean, neat and decorated beautifully.  The special touches made all the difference.  The price was right and we will definitely stay again. Thanks so much for a perfect home away from home:)"
5682,78805,2010-08-15,173387,Emmanuel And Emily,Maddy is an extrememly thoughtful host! She went out of her way to help us get to different places and to make sure that we were comfortable and enjoying our stay. We greatly appreciated her hospitality and if we are ever in the area in the future would consider staying with her again. 
5682,84467,2010-08-25,173387,Emmanuel And Emily,Thanks Maddy for making our stay so wonderful! You are such a helpful and thoughtful person. Staying at your place provided us an oasis from the busy city but also a springboard from which we could visit it. Thanks again :)
5682,86010,2010-08-28,181217,Sabahat,Loved staying here!  You're in your own little apartment.  Maddy was so considerate and I would def stay here again!
5682,87555,2010-08-30,212915,Chia Chi,The host is a very nice person..A+++++++++++++
5682,88279,2010-09-01,181217,Sabahat,I loved staying here.  I had to leave for the weekend to travel to Portland and Maddy was very flexible in working out a special arrangement for me even going so far as to store some left over food items (from my mini-fridge) into her fridge while I was gone.  Who needs hotels anymore??  This is the way to go!  And this is the place to stay the next time you're in Seattle.  Thanks Maddy!
5682,91780,2010-09-07,151655,Maria Clara,Maddy was a fantastic host. She gave us lots of information re Seattle and was really helpfull during our stay. Her home is very convenient for downtown buses etc. If you are looking for budget accommodation in Seattle this is highly recommended.
5682,94927,2010-09-11,209161,Benny,"Maddy's place was my first Airbnb experience. It could not have started any better! Her place is conveniently 20 mins by bus from downtown Seattle. Just take the bus and it goes straight there. No need to transfer. Drops you off at Pike Place Market if you want. The bus stop is literally steps from the door. It's like front door service. Buses come pretty often too. Even during morning rush hour, there wasn't any traffic.  

Inside the place is amazing! The pictures don't do it justice. It had the smell of a brand new house. In the hallway there was a microwave, plates, bowls, and some granola bars. The room was comfortable with a large bed, TV/DVD, and fridge. The bathroom was amazing. Clean, Roomy. Nice shower. 

I was going to walk to the grocery store and buy some water but noticed Maddy put some bottled waters in the room! Such a nice touch! Also she had a small collection of DVDs to watch. The TV gets some cable channels. Good wifi. She also had a big bag of ear plugs in there but I didn't need it. The room is facing the street so some may hear the cars drive by, but it never bothered me.

Maddy was a wonderful host. She helped give me directions on how to get around. She answered all my questions. She let's you have your privacy but is very friendly to say hi. 

If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle, this is the place. Great price and even better room.   "
5682,101704,2010-09-21,129042,William,"Comfortable, clean accommodation, nice bed with bathroom.  Own private entrance with microwave and fridge.   Bus stop to city outside front door.   10 minute walk to cafes.  Maddy is happy to answer any questions and does not intrude.   Happy to recommend for anyone who wants a comfortable stay but doesn't want to cook meals."
5682,107216,2010-09-28,205170,Terry,"This was my first Airbnb experience and i couldn't of asked for more! Maddy was a perfect host, very friendly!!
The place was amazing! Very cheap, comfortable, and had everything you could want. It was almost like a hotel room, the pictures don't really do it justice. I HIGHLY suggest staying there if you're going to Seattle. Many thanks Maddy!!!"
5682,110531,2010-10-03,212372,Renata,"Maddy´s place is very nice and cute, full of good taste. It has everything one might need, although it is tiny. 
It is a bit noisy, but earplugs can fix this problem. I experienced some wifi issues. Staying connected is quite important for travellers, if you want to stay in contact with your loved ones, check some internet sites for transportation schedules or book some tickets etc. Maddy is a very nice and friendly person, everything worked smoothly. 
Highly recommended.

She's a really good person, it was very nice to meet her and talking to her - and she's super helpful. The location is good, easy to go downtown or anywhere. Highly recommended! "
5682,130903,2010-11-01,27744,Emily,"Maddy was an excellent host, helpful and knowledgeable about the area.  And thoughtful!  Water bottles in the frig and coupons for local restaurants and museums on the table, a few granola bars for snacks, lots of tourist info, too.  The location is wonderful - halfway between the airport (where my husband needed to be) and downtown (where I wanted to go play), right on a bus line, easy to find, free parking available on the street close by.  Perfect for one or two people as a launching pad for exploring the Seattle area.  Thanks, Maddy!"
5682,140152,2010-11-16,267346,Aaron,Had a great experience at Maddy's place. The room and bathroom where very clean and comfy with a private entrance. Would recomend to others to stay there.. 
5682,143186,2010-11-22,111616,Megann,"This was a great place. Easy to find, clean and quiet, just a small amount of street noise. The bed was super comfy and I loved having a mini fridge and cold water that didn't cost me $5."
5682,145126,2010-11-27,272239,Tim & Kelly,"So glad our 1st experience with airbnb was great! We came here 11/2010 during the 1st snow & ice of the year. Very nice - warm - we only used the heater in the entry for 1 hr every day - even with the temp of 30. She can adjust temp some for you from her place if too warm. We use a small fan to sleep & so didn't notice much traffic at all. Room was nice & clean, queen bed, good sized bath, great water pressure in shower! We did find parking every day within 1 block. 

Maybe needs a folding luggage rack so bag can sit on it in the entry (far right area) & not on the floor. 

We loved the fact this was a private entrance!
We already referred someone else to stay here next time."
5682,156948,2010-12-21,13139,Mike,"Had a good first experience w airbandb at Madddy's. Very classy decor and thoughtful place. She has great tastes and your bed is very comfortable-comparable to luxury hotels,if you prefer a firm mattress,which I do. The access to public transportation is excellent. During the warmer months,the proximity to Delridge,could lead to some noise w foot traffic nearby. It is a cozy place to rest after a day in the city."
5682,158097,2010-12-24,311521,Bev,"Maddy has a great setup with a private entrance, en suite bath with a fabulous shower, a super comfortable queen size bed,  and the ability to make your coffee in the morning and a mini frig for your milk and oj.   I read other comments about the street noise, but it frankly was not an issue. Besides Maddy has thoughtfully supplied ear plugs and a white noise machine.  There is a shopping center (BnNoble, Starbucks, Marshalls, grocery store, bank, pharmacy) three or four blocks away.  Maddy is a sweetheart and a generous host.  Thank you so much."
5682,158913,2010-12-27,201293,Marge,"Maddy was a helpful and flexible host.  I found her place convenient, clean, and nicely appointed with small items to make my stay more pleasant."
5682,162750,2011-01-02,271547,Tracy,"Maddy was very easy to get in touch with, and was accommodating when I rolled into Seattle a few hours early.

The space was nice and comfy, but I would have preferred a spot closer to town. It is not an issue if you have a car, but something to be aware of. "
5682,177695,2011-02-02,360432,Sarah,"Very cozy clean studio, lovely quiet area in a convenient location. Maddy was a very helpful host."
5682,178718,2011-02-06,211675,Jaime,"Maddy was the cutest! It's awesome to meet an airbnb guest/host and think ""Man, I wish I lived closer to this person because they're awesome and I can definitely see us being pals."" 

Her little studio was perfect. So cute. Clean. With lots of little unexpected extras like maps, granola bars, water bottles and tea that were such a treat. Taking the bus into downtown Seattle was super easy and cheap. I will definitely, absolutely stay with Maddy again next time I'm in Seattle. One of my favorite cities! Thanks Maddy....you're welcome at my home anytime!"
5682,182723,2011-02-15,352702,Jenny,"My stay was exactly what it says COZY!!!. Maddy’s place is clean, quite and safe. My sister and I enjoyed our stay there and will be definitely going back and recommending this lovely cozy studio. Maddy is a great person... She also has travel guides and snacks and a microwave to reheat to go food. There is a target a couple of blocks away and downtown is not far. I rented a car and really got to see a lot of Seattle. But taking the bus was also in experience. Great listing and great pricing this is a most definitely steal...."
5682,185457,2011-02-21,352959,Galen,"The place was great, it's very easily accessible to downtown, clean and homey. Maddy was flexible (let us extend our stay) and friendly - we would stay there again!"
5682,191688,2011-03-03,357000,Bonnie,"The place is nice and comfortable with everything ready, convenient, though it is a small room.  Maddy makes good effort to arrange everything for us.  Thanks!"
5682,216505,2011-04-04,368977,Julie,"Maddy was an excellent, gracious host, and the place is absolutely perfect! She has everything you need in the studio and goes out of her way to help you get around town. The bedroom window looks out onto the front yard with gorgeous cherry trees. The bathroom is spacious, and Maddy stocks breakfast and coffee in the entryway. I would definitely stay here again! "
5682,219809,2011-04-07,430893,Troy,Our stay at Maddy's place was great! The room is exactly as shown and very comfortable. The bus stop is right across the street just steps away!  We would defiantly stay again!   
5682,220467,2011-04-08,430893,Troy,"Maddy was great and the stay was great as well! Everything is just like the picture, and the bus stop is just steps away! We took the bus every day right down the Pike Place and had a great time! Thanks again! "
5682,231285,2011-04-19,337537,Karen,"Maddy was an amazing host, extremely welcoming and the studio was a great base to explore the city from. Everything I needed was there and was really cozy. I'd definitely come back!"
5682,236487,2011-04-23,236211,Alberta,Maddy is a very wonderful host and I would recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at this wonderful condo.  Thank you Maddy! :-))
5682,248665,2011-05-02,336410,Suzanne,"I really enjoyed staying with Maddy. She was friendly and very sweet. The room and private bath were ideal for me. They were very clean and nicely furnished. The separate entrance provided privacy. Maddy made it easy for me to check in using a lock box key even though she was working when I arrived and she was equally accommodating after I checked out and needed to pick up the electric toothbrush I forgot. Comfy bed, hot water in the shower and plenty of room heat. Ahhh... I had a good stay and wouldn't think twice about staying again! Thank you Maddy! "
5682,251501,2011-05-04,418508,Amy,"I sound like all the other reviewers, but Maddy was a great hostess. She picked me up at the airport (arranged beforehand) and also dropped me off there for an early morning flight, on short notice. She was very friendly and helpful.

Her place was great! Comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and many of the comforts of home. Internet was easy to use, and there's a nice television, as well. The little kitchen station was great, and she had provided a coffeemaker with coffee, teas, hot chocolate, a microwave, and breakfast in the form of instant oatmeal and granola bars. There's also a fridge in the bedroom.

Maddy provided maps, bus routes, and travel guides for Seattle and I also felt like I could ask her anything and she would be able to help me out. The bus stop to Seattle is right outside the door, very convenient.

There is a little traffic noise in the bedroom, but it was not an issue, and she has a noise machine that blocks it out, too. It didn't affect my sleep at all."
5682,262603,2011-05-14,285880,Wendy,Cute space.  Just as advertised.  Host has lots of information for you to look at and help you get around the Seattle area.
5682,267849,2011-05-17,203403,Coco,"Very clean and comfortable place, decorated nicely and arranged for functionality. Maddy made herself available to talk with me and answer my questions when I needed help in spite of her busy schedule. The room comes with free snacks, coffee, teas, a small refregerator, and even filtered water, a deal better than a nice business hotel. And I apprecited the soft towels! The street noise is much less by the time you go to bed. The bus stop ito go to downtown Seattle s in front of the house! Amazing location, amazing deal and amazing host. Thank you so much. "
5682,284612,2011-05-28,457494,Serena,"Maddy(Host) and the studio were awesome :)! Studio was so cozy and warm. First of all, bus stop is really close to the house so it is to easy to go downtown by bus. And there are some malls nearby studio in 5 min! If I ever make it to Seattle I will stay again :)"
5682,290971,2011-05-31,579051,Sarah,"This was a great place to stay! The price was reasonable, the bed was quite comfortable, the location was convenient and the studio was very thoughtfully appointed with not just a comfortable bed, roomy shower, a refrigerator and eating area but also lots of really thoughtful little extras--dishes & utensils, oatmeal, hot cocoa, popcorn, shampoo, hairspray, white noise machine (in case you're not used to city noise), wireless internet, bus schedules, movies and lots of Seattle travel guides. Thanks again, Maddy!"
5682,296109,2011-06-03,622403,Mye,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was perfect.  The place is a bit too small for very large luggage, but it's otherwise just fine.  The bed is comfy and the bathroom is really nice with almost all the toiletries you would need.  Maddy has great taste.

We had no problems with street parking, the neighborhood is safe and there are restaurants in walking distance.  We were only in town for a few days for the Seattle International Film Festival.   My boyfriend left a copy of his film Surrogate Valentine in the dvd library in the room.  If you stay there, hope you get to check it out.  :)
"
5682,310795,2011-06-13,411120,Adalsteinn Líndal,"This was our first stay at Airbnb. The price was fair and reasonable. 
We stayed for six nights at Maddy´s, who is an excellent host and very helpful. Nothing surprised us, everything was up to our expectations.
The noise from the traffic didn´t bother us. 
When we come back later to Seattle, we will certainly stay at Maddy´s home.
Thanks for a pleasant stay at your studio apartment.
Adalsteinn and Margret, Iceland"
5682,316843,2011-06-15,677093,Myrdith,"This is a great value.  The room is nicely set up, very clean and Maddy is very welcoming and helpful in providing directions around town.  She also has lots of Seattle tourist info which we used to find our way around some of the high spots in town.  There is some traffic noise, but it didn't bother us.  We slept well."
5682,322040,2011-06-19,428115,Danielle,Maddy has this room and the bathroom closed off so it is completely private.  It's a very nice room and very clean.  There are tons of maps and pamphlets of hings to do as well as coffee and tea.  Maddy was very helpful with directions and seemed available but not intrusive.  I would definitely stay here again.
5682,326787,2011-06-21,623170,Tai Fai,Maddy is really nice and helpful! The room looks even better than the photos I think! She put a lots of books about traveling in Seattle too which is a helpful bonus to us!
5682,360096,2011-07-08,565181,Tiffany,Maddy was an excellent host!  The room was just perfect for two people and her added touches really set it apart from staying at a hotel.  She was helpful and kept in good contact.  The room was clean and the added amenities were not expected but a very nice gesture.  I would book with Maddy again for sure.
5682,372588,2011-07-14,718471,Johan,"Nice,clean room a little small but not cramped.
Easy buss to downtown.
On street parking-no problem finding space.
Supermarkets nearby.
Lots of tourist info and free wi-fi.
Microwave coffe-maker fridge.
We will  recommend to others!"
5682,380096,2011-07-18,39310,Natalie,Maddy was easy to get a hold of even though we came in and left early. The place was clean and tidy. We also enjoyed the internet access. Thanks again!
5682,387092,2011-07-21,479716,Faith,"Maddy was an excellent host, and we really enjoyed our time in Seattle. She was very communicative, her rates were great, and the apartment size was cozy and perfect for my husband and me. She had a lot of travel books and maps, and welcomed us with ice water and granola bars. There is not a kitchen in the apartment but we were eager to experience Seattle's food, so we didn't miss it. "
5682,391471,2011-07-23,802422,Claude,the room is so nice and comfortable!!!! thanx a lot maddy!
5682,405788,2011-07-30,512829,Kerrie,"Maddy was a great host, went out of her way to make sure you had everything and that your stay was everything you wanted. Very helpful with local tips and even taking me to see where the shops were on my first night. 
Maddy's room is so nice and the bathroom is great with everything you need. Its was so good to have a place to make food and to keep things cool. Maddy's little extra's in the room are very good too like coffee,water,bars to eat etc.  Maddy even took me to the bus port at the end of my trip which was great with the bags i had. I would stay here again no problem.
A couple of things to keep in mind,you do have to take the bus into town but its right outside her place and the bus is cheep. The room is also at the front so you do hear cars,buses etc but maddy has ear plugs if you need them and most of the time you will be to tired to worry about it. :) 
Great place."
5682,410576,2011-08-01,634655,Alexander,"I really like the Maddy's place. The room is even better than in pictures. Maddy is a great person and hospitable host. Unfortunately, I was not able to stay in Seattle and had to leave earlier. If I have an opportunity to visit Seattle the Maddy's place is going to be my first choice. 
P.S. Maddy, thank you a lot!"
5682,435167,2011-08-10,868550,Michelle & James,Great room and gracious host!  It was a perfect first airbnb experience for us.  The room had everything we needed and then some!  Thanks again Maddy!
5682,443576,2011-08-14,480159,Yi,"It was great staying with Maddy. She's very friendly. The room is cute and clean. The neighborhood is safe and everything is convenient - if you go outside the house (left side), turn left on Trenton St, and turn left again on the 25th Ave, there are shopping places, restaurant(s), and Starbucks."
5682,449357,2011-08-16,258417,Kevin,"Maddy was easy to get a hold of and the apartment was great.  We only stayed one night, but it was perfect;  the place was clean, bed was comfortable, and checkin was easy.  Highly recommended!"
5682,457331,2011-08-19,694946,Zac,We showed up and Maddy let us in early. She bent the check in/check out times for us. We asked for good places to eat and she was very knowledgeable. overall it was a great experience and I will tell my friends and family to go see Maddy if they vacation in Seattle.
5682,474508,2011-08-25,903607,Claire,Maddy was a great host. The place was very well decorated and spotless.  It was right on a bus line downtown.  The only problem was that its location was less than ideal.  
5682,493146,2011-09-01,796485,Sophie,"We arrived earlier than expected and Maddy was very accommodating and let us check in early, even though she had guests leaving that day and it meant she had to hustle to get the place cleaned up. I really appreciated the little touches, like the basket of books and guides to get around Seattle, and even a spare umbrella in case it rained. The bus stop directly in front of the house is both a pro and a con, super convenient, but a little loud at times. Maddy did supply a white noise machine which made me sleep like a baby. Thanks Maddy! "
5682,541961,2011-09-18,923147,Sarah,"Maddy's place was absolutely great. We felt very comfortable and a little like home. Everything was clean and in good condition. We did really enjoy our stay! Should you ever go to Seattle, you should definitely consider Maddy."
5682,555801,2011-09-22,443380,Ron,Maddy is such a great host. The room was clean and cozy. We would definitely stay here again. 
5682,564215,2011-09-24,678023,India,Really nice place. Clean & comfortable. Very helpful and nice host. Would definitely recommend staying there.
5682,607788,2011-10-08,759299,Cathy,"Hostess with the most-est! The room was exactly what we needed after a long bus ride back from Vancouver. The bed was so comfortable AND smelled great. Plenty of towels - magnificent. She was so sweet by having little snackies (ie. granola bars and tea) and a brita filter available.

The location is a bit far from DT Seattle. However, we did take the 120 bus (located right across from the place) which took us to Pioneer Square (approx 30-40 mins). Not too shabby. "
5682,614214,2011-10-10,1073215,Isaac,It was a great little spot to stay in just across the bridge from downtown Seattle. My girlfriend and I had an awesome time staying there. It was a nice little spot. 
5682,623503,2011-10-12,1186668,Erin,"The room itself is great, and Maddy made it really convenient for us to ""check in"" even though we arrived late on a Sunday night. 

The things to know about this rental are: there's nothing around it within walking distance (you'll have to drive to find a nearby restaurant), there's street parking only, and the bedroom is right off a busy main street with pretty much constant street traffic. So if you're a light sleeper then you might want to consider that.

However, the rate can't be beat, the West Seattle location is pretty convenient to the airport, and a trip into the city was only about 20 mins. by car."
5682,641367,2011-10-18,263094,Lyka,"Maddy's place was great! My bf and I stayed for 3 nights and even though I didn't get to meet Maddy until the last night everything was so awesome that nothing went wrong. She thought of everything from guidebooks to coffee and tea to the earplugs by the bed. I highly recommend her place to anyone. It's very homey, cute, clean and convenient. Street parking was easy and for those needing public transportation there is a bus stop right out front. It was my first time using Airbnb and from this experience I won't hesitate to use it again!"
5682,668321,2011-10-27,415736,Andre,"Maddy’s place has everything and more!   In addition to a nice place with all the basic commodities (i.e. towels, soap, etc…), Maddy also goes far and beyond to provide coffee/tea packets, snacks, and even a very useful stack of Seattle guides and maps.   Very safe.  Very comfortable.  I highly recommend Maddy’s!    =)"
5682,678695,2011-11-01,787248,Janice,"This was a beautifully modern and cute studio. It was perfect for the needs of two people and includes everything as described. Although Maddy never had to, she warned us about the 99 freeway closure. I thought that was really nice since she was not all about the money.  We kept in contact mostly through emails and text. She was flexible with the check in time and the place was very clean! I could not have asked for more and the studio was a wonderful spot! The studio had heat and kept us warm throughout the cold nights, and looking for parking on the street was easy. Overall, it was a pleasant stay! "
5682,706020,2011-11-09,1316569,Rhiannon,Maddy was so great and the room was so nice and close to downtown! Highly recommend!!!!!!
5682,726915,2011-11-17,1385664,Bruce,"Clean, Cozy and a Maddy is a great host.  Looking forward to staying there again when I'm in the Seattle area."
5682,753282,2011-11-29,267346,Aaron,Had another great stay at Maddy's clean modern room with a very comfortable bed.. Five stars all the way!!
5682,769094,2011-12-06,1465067,Brenda,"What a fantastic experience! Have not this before and would for sure recommend this and Maddy to anyone! It was just what my daughter and I needed after a long shop day. Good place, comfortable bed, nice eating are...just right for the two of us! Everything went so well, would for sure recommend
this to all!"
5682,854420,2012-01-10,1351067,Lu,"Maddy is a very good host. It is so nice to stay with her beautiful apartment. It has a bedroom, a small kitchen and a bathroom, which are all clean, and convenient. She is also very considerate and helpful with much information. We are so happy to stay there for 4 nights. I definitely recommend her house to people who want to visit Seattle."
5682,874277,2012-01-21,1434983,Miriam,"Our stay at Maddy`s apartment was just perfect! The apartment is exactly as described. Beautiful, charming, very clean. Maddy even provides little snacks and city guides for her guest. She was extremely nice and welcoming. She did everything she could to make us comfortable. There is a bus infront of the house that brings you into the city. I would definitely recommend the place!"
5682,878351,2012-01-23,29529,Sarissa,"A perfect little spot just minutes outside of the city center! Best if you have a car for purposes of commuting, but it seemed like travel by bus/light rail was entirely reasonable, as well. Maddy was courteous and patient and we had a ton of privacy. The price was FANTASTIC, as well.

I'd love to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle. Thank you, Maddy!"
5682,923748,2012-02-15,1662521,Jose,"Great place to stay and the price cant be beat.  Maddy was very accommodating and easy to reach.  Wish we could have spent more time and chat but we went all out exploring the city.  Out early, back late.  It was great to come back to the studio feeling as if we were staying at a friend's home.  

We shall stay there when visiting the Emerald City again.  

Thank you Maddy!   8o)

5682,952856,2012-02-27,462516,Kevin,"Maddy offered so much to us and was such a great host!  The place itself was really cozy and clean!  Good location, lots of parking, and clean towels:)  Had a really pleasant stay and would recommend it to anyone!"
5682,976121,2012-03-06,1742889,Hadyan,"Maddy was a very good host! Her place was very cozy and nice, and she was ever so helpful and made us feel really at home.
Even though we didn't stay in Seattle for long, we very much enjoyed our time there. We would definitely love to stay with her again sometime in the future! Thank you again Maddy."
5682,1018203,2012-03-19,787248,Janice,"Another wonderful trip in Seattle thanks to Maddy's cute little studio. It was perfect for my needs. I do have to warn that if you like to go out for the Seattle Nightlife to check for the West Seattle Bridge closure. It was 4am in the morning, I do not own a GPS or a Smartphone, so I had to take a 1 hour detour just to get back to this spot on a paper map. Luckily I was not drinking, but I was exhausted. This does not reflect how wonderful of a stay this studio is! Will still love to book again for the future!  "
5682,1032613,2012-03-22,1821416,Dawn,"I stayed with Maddy for three nights in March.  Maddy was very helpful and accommodating.  The private entry to the studio makes it seem like a home away from home-well decorated, clean, has everything one would need while traveling.  The 120 Bus provides a quick and convenient ride into Downtown.  I definitely recommend this place to other travelers!      "
5682,1073331,2012-04-02,1551666,Diane,"We had a great stay at Maddy's during our conference in Seattle! 
Maddy was kind to welcome us into her home, the suite was perfect because it provided us with privacy, we didn't want to disturb our hosts while when we came home from a long day of events. The drive from downtown was approximately 16 mins from the Washington convention centre and when we returned to our bnb we always found safe and free parking on one of the side streets. The pictures Maddy posted of the suite are very accurate, it is clean, neat and the bed is very comfortable. We often got home from a full day of events so the traffic noise wouldn't wake us and I'm usually a light sleeper. Maddy made sure we had enough towels and such to last our 5 nights and it was very convenient to have the eating area, coffee maker, fridge and wi-fi she provides her guests, I also appreciate that we could compost and recycle. There is a grocery store and mall 5 mins away which meant we could get fresh fruit and snacks for our long days. We got an amazing deal and we would love to stay with Maddy again next time we're in town!"
5682,1090148,2012-04-06,1892301,Thomas,"Maddy was a wonderful host and I hope to stay again soon. This was my 1st experience using airbnb.com and if you are like me, my primary concern was -- ""Is this as advertised?"" I can say emphatically that what you see is what you get which is absolutely perfect in my book. Thank you Maddy!"
5682,1128045,2012-04-14,1924329,Andrew,"Maddy has a great cozy place! Very clean and comforting. Would recommend to anyone. Great location, just a bus ride to downtown. "
5682,1139666,2012-04-16,979478,Victoria,"Wonderfully quaint and convenient studio! We had a pleasant stay at Maddy's place. She provided very thoughtful amenities, (ie. coffee, ear plugs, noise machine, wi-fi, water, toiletries, snacks,  towels, maps, and tourist guides, umbrella) as well as clean linens and a very clean bathroom. Would definitely stay here again on another pleasant trip to Seattle! Thank you!"
5682,1175574,2012-04-24,1874909,Michael,"Maddy's place is like staying in a hotel. Photos are spot on. Everything was just great most especially the restroom (5/5 stars for that). Bus stop is literally in front of the house. Thus very convenient to go to downtown. Westwood Village is also a few blocks away and all that you need is there. Starbucks, Target, Marshall, Jumba Juice and so much more. Just be ready for an uphill climb when going back. Also had a chance to have a chat with Maddy. She's very nice and a superb host. I highly recommend Maddy's place and will be staying here again if I am back in Seattle. Thanks Maddy."
5682,1196673,2012-04-29,1999118,Jessi,"We had a great stay in Seattle. Maddy's place is very comfortable, clean and thoughtful. The bed was comfortable and she made checking in/out so convenient. We never had any trouble finding a parking spot on the closet side street no matter what time it was. We would definitely stay again and would recommend her place to others without hesitation. 
Thanks Maddy!"
5682,1240874,2012-05-07,2058899,Nafees,"I stayed at Maddy`s place for 4 nights after my student conference. The place was as advertised (cozy and private). There was a small kitchenette and Maddy's placed out forks,plates and a filter jug if needed. She also placed abundant towels out and the studio was extremely well-kept. After a 20-25 minute bus ride back from walking around downtown - it was the perfect place to rest and wind down. I would definitely go back to Maddy's studio if I go back to Seattle. Subsequently, Maddy makes great arrangements whatever time I arrived and left. Thank you again.  "
5682,1253584,2012-05-09,728120,Wiebke,"Maddy was a wonderul host! She responded immediately to our questions before our stay at her house and was very helpful and accomodating. 
The apartment is exactly as it looks on the picture and was very clean and nice. The bus to downtown Seattle leaves right in front of the door which was perfect for us. 
I strongly recommend this place and host!"
5682,1290469,2012-05-16,2148345,Natalia,"I stayed in Maddy's house for 4 days.  I can't say how perfect it was, it was more than. The house was so clean, comfortable and so cozy.  Muddy really care about her guests. There even was some snacks, coffe and tea. Maddy is very understanding person and willing to help. It was my first time when i use this website. And before my visit to her house, I sent some questions to which she promptly replied, that helps me feel more comfortable.
Thanks a lot to you, Maddy"
5682,1333755,2012-05-23,1620362,Jennifer,"I loved my stay and will be recommending Maddy's place to others that may be staying in Seattle. The place was just as described and just like how the photos are shown. I had no problem finding the address and my way around that part of town. There are many gas stations (Redbox rentals for movies too) and restaurants close by, there is also a Target a few blocks away. The place is very clean and up to date. Others had mentioned that it was noisy, but we did not seem to notice and had no problem sleeping. We put the complementary umbrella to use and one day we had to eat the granola bars she left for use because we were running late and did not have time for breakfast. I appreciated the books she had there for us to look at and a few toiletries in the bathroom that you could use if you forgot something. It is a great place to stay."
5682,1370535,2012-05-29,1895549,Sophia,"Loved this studio!  Very cozy, clean and cute.  Not too far from downtown, we had a very nice weekend staying here and would do so again, thanks for being so great Maddy!"
5682,1420399,2012-06-05,2096292,Paula,"We had a great experience staying at Maddy's. The suite was spotless, fully equipped with details that make the stay more enjoyable: a small kitchenette (coffee maker, goodies, microwave, fridge), basic cable TV, Seattle maps/guides, toiletries, earplugs... A tiny suite with all the comfort. We didn't have the chance to try taking public transit to move around, but I think the location is best for those driving their own car. The only drawback was an unstable Internet connection which made communication difficult. But other than that, we would definitely recommend it. We'll be back :)"
5682,1448063,2012-06-10,1998644,Shadi,"This studio was excellent! It is located right in front of bus stop that goes directly downtown.  The studio is clean and has bed is super comfortable.  The pictures are exactly as the studio appears.  I stayed for a week and appreciated the set-up, which I feel had more to offer than most hotels (i.e. DVD player & select movies to choose from, various Seattle guides on the bookshelf, umbrella, microwave, mini-fridge, etc).  This was my first time using airbnb and Maddy quickly answered my questions and was very friendly.  I would definitely recommend this studio to anyone and will stay here again if I return to Seattle!"
5682,1580037,2012-06-28,2197751,Rs,"My getaway to Seattle had been in the works since Dec, 2011. The plan was to meet with my four sons and have as much   FUN, FOOD and FRIENDSHIP  (FFF) as possible and to have it happen without a hitch and it did.  I know; I kept score:

•	FUN @ 3 Museums on 3 different days. All straight through the goalpost (9-0)
•	FOOD at healthy Thai, Pubs, Locals  with Café kickers (9-0)
•	FRIENDSHIP all along the way with many end-zone celebrations (21-0)

Lastly, but equally important, a great place to stay, Maddy’s Place. The Cozy Studio. Upon returning from my sojourns I was always able to find parking, most times right out front. Reaching Maddy by phone and email, when necessary, went very smoothly. Freeway access was quite easy (Although my encounters with state road signs were quite bumpy at times. Hence, my son’s Garmin became my new best friend :-)  And maybe best of all, the service station just north of Maddys had the lowest gas prices around :-) Two more big scores. Final score 53-0 with ""Good Times by All"" taking the FFF trophy once again

I would definitely stay at Maddy’s Place again. 

Victoriously Yours,
RSY

Maddy was a great host and it was really comfortable to stay at her place.
I also really enjoyed dvds she left for me...
Also bus to downtown is right in front of her place and grocery store was close to place so I had no problems staying there.
If you want to travel Seattle, staying at Maddy's place would be a best choice!!!!"
5682,1640144,2012-07-06,2050701,Dan And Brittney,We had a great time in this cozy studio. The room and bathroom were very clean and well maintained. Maddy was quick to respond when we had questions and made checking in and out easy. I loved having a private entrance and  the room was quiet.

Clean & convenient location."
5682,1930938,2012-08-09,1891639,Beth,"This studio was ideal for what we needed. Some very thoughtful touches provided by Maddy including some Seattle guides, DVDs and even some snack bars. Maddy introduced herself and was lovely giving more useful info about the buses and access to shops. Very much enjoyed the stay wouldn't hesitate to recommend others to stay here. "
5682,1951469,2012-08-11,3041036,Napaporn,Good place. I enjoyed the stay. Small but cute and well-kept. Maddy will answer your questions very quickly. Just make sure you plan your routes well since a few bridges were closed.
5682,1979604,2012-08-14,1773325,Sibylle,We stayed for two nights at Maddys Studio and had a great time! Everything was very clean and comfortable. Only thing was that we opened the window at night and the street was quite loud. But when you keep the windows closed its ok.
5682,2082020,2012-08-24,2739965,Karla,"Maddy was a very helpful and attentive host. Her studio is small and simple, but the essentials are provided for: cleanliness, a comfortable bed, nice bathroom and fast wifi. Getting downtown by bus is very easy. I would recommend this place as good value."
5682,2123672,2012-08-28,2891056,Florence,"Maddy was a great host! She allowed me to check in early, was helpful with questions, and my overall experience was just great! Plus the location was really convenient to head downtown with the bus stop just literally being located outside her house! And the bathroom was spacious, clean and nice! Overall, will definitely head back to stay at her place if I'm ever in Seattle!"
5682,2212772,2012-09-06,1531766,Irina,"Very nice suite, with the feel of a hotel room with a kitchennette that would run over $100. The furnishings are charming, the bathroom is completely new and fully stocked with towels and plenty of supplies, the kitchen area is very functional and also stocked with different kinds of teas, coffees and granola bars. as is the kitchen area. the area is residential and very quiet.
Maddy has taken the time to consider all the possible needs of her guest - stocking the suite with various supplies as noted above, providing wifi and the expertise to get it to work, several guidebooks to help you enjoy your trip, a noise machine for a restful sleep, helpful tips about the city and support when a problem arises.
I had a very pleasant stay in the beautiful emerald city during  an awesome one of a kind festival.
Thanks very much for the accomodations and the tip on the phone - it is awesome."
5682,2272524,2012-09-13,937678,Nutthawut,Great moment to stay in Seattle with Maddy's beautiful suite. Very close to bus stop. Maddy was very nice.
5682,2343102,2012-09-19,758224,Tim,"Our accommodations were clean, comfortable and very affordable. The location is a bit remote but it was not a problem for us since we had a car. The property is located on Delridge Avenue which is a major street and an easy and direct route to downtown and the airport. It was a bit noisy at night but our host provided earplugs which helped. We enjoyed our stay. "
5682,2380837,2012-09-23,3190380,Freya,"This was the most amazing place I have ever stayed, so clean, so warm, so cozy. I loved, loved, loved, loved it. WONDERFUL experience!"
5682,2436841,2012-09-28,840906,Steph,"My first AirBNB experience was here and it was lovely. The bus stop picked us up and dropped us off at the front door, and we walked several times to the little town and shopping area. This was a great taste of what it would be like to live in Seattle and I love the cozy private space. I fell in love with Birds on a Wire Coffee shop (20 min walk or 5 min bus ride). Maddy left fun things to help make the experience feel cozy like city guides and hot tea, and answered all texts and messages super quickly. She even worked with us when we add 1 extra day to our stay, Great host, amazing experience!"
5682,2536238,2012-10-08,2959419,Cassie,"Maddy was very welcoming and hospitable from the very start to the very end of my stay. The atmosphere was quite similar to staying at a friend or family's place: cozy, clean and comforting. There is a shopping plaza within five minute's walk from the location; it has a pharmacy, grocery store, Target, Starbucks, as well as a pizza and a dessert shop. A short drive northeast will take you to all of the fun exploration the city limits of Seattle has to offer. Maddy's place offers a cozy, slightly out of the bustle option; therefore, all things considered, it is a treasure stay!"
5682,2612384,2012-10-15,2904380,Ina,It is a nice apartment in a quiet area of Seattle. Everything was clean and cozy. If you are looking for a place where you get into contact with your host this might be not the best one. If you enjoy your privacy after a day exploring Seattle you will love it. Getting to downtown is easy as thete is a busstation right in front of the house.
5682,2663391,2012-10-20,3607529,Femi,"Maddy's place is absolutely amazing!! She thought of everything--from her guest having the midnight munchies to having filtered water, coffee, and tea available in the room. The few days I spent in the studio were possibly some of the most restful I've had ALL YEAR! The location has a great homey feel and made my stay in Seattle very comfortable. She is very knowledgeable about the Seattle area and gave me a quick rundown of the sights to see. I will stay here again if I ever find myself in the Seattle area."
5682,2687008,2012-10-22,3763570,Dan,"Really clean and comfortable. Maddy is really nice. West Seattle is a good fifteen minute drive from a lot of neighborhoods that I was visiting in Seattle. Also, the unit is 50 or so feet off a main road so the street noise can be loud at times if you are sensitive to that. For the cost, it's a really good value. "
5682,2748355,2012-10-29,787248,Janice,It is my 3rd time staying with Maddy and everything has been great yet again. All the reviews below mine have been accurately stated and the place is very cozy and comforting. 
5682,2950689,2012-11-24,3859095,Mauvianne,"This is a very nice small studio with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom was very clean with ample space and a good shower. There were black out drapes which was very nice. I was tired and sick when I arrived from California so that helped me sleep better. Maddy is very nice and very accommodating and hospitable. Is is close to traffic so you will hear the cars. It slows down late into evening. Parking is around the corner. I never had a problem with finding a place to park. You can unload your car in her driveway and then go park. I would give it a five star, but the traffic downgraded in one star. I would stay they again. This is the best value on airbnb! "
5682,3094137,2012-12-15,932772,Tom,I'll just add to the many complimentary reviews. Maddy was a super host - helping with everything from standing outside to help locate the driveway to arranging a covered space out of the rain to load up - with lending a few kitchen things in between! The facilities were just right and the location ideal.
5682,3100208,2012-12-16,191444,Tuan,The reservation was canceled 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5682,3288777,2013-01-06,4185598,Becky And Aaron,"What a wonderful find! Everything was clean and cozy, as described. Maddy was quick to respond to any questions or concerns. The studio was so close to so many things. Thanks for making our Seattle stay great!"
5682,3320629,2013-01-10,746471,Chris,"Nice, easy spot with a comfortable bed and a good shower.  For the price you can't get much better than this.  You can hear the traffic at times but nothing too bad.  Plus there are plenty of things Maddy supplies that help drown out the sound.  "
5682,3333118,2013-01-12,4391555,Thomas,"Maddy's place is cozy, clean, and nicely decorated. She provided all the basic amenities as well as tour guide books on Seattle. When there were issues with the wifi, she stayed up late to help resolve it. Thank you Maddy! It was a great stay."
5682,3436128,2013-01-29,68674,LaJuan,"Maddy was a wonderful host! Her apartment is nice and cozy. She was more than accommodating in every way. The apartment was only minutes away from downtown Seattle and it was terribly easy to get around. I will definitely use Maddy's place the next time I'm in Seattle. Just a great, hospitable, host. "
5682,3461652,2013-02-02,3182457,Anne-Isabelle,"Maddy offers a very good place to stay! Really clean and comfortable studio in a great location. (Suburban, but really close to buses). There is anything you need: maps of Seattle, city guide book, buses timetable, soap, towels... With a private intrance and a small kitchen, I felt just like at home!
And Maddy is a great host. Good communication before and during the stay. I loved my experience in Seattle! "
5682,3477075,2013-02-04,4883276,Courtney,"Excellent! Wonderfully comfortable and accommodating. Everything was thought of. The apartment was perfectly set up and in a great location. Would definitely recommend Maddy's place! Maddy is a lovely host, affording her guests optimum privacy, whilst insuring that all their needs and wants are catered for. Would definitely stay at Maddy's again."
5682,3501785,2013-02-09,4266512,Megan,"The studio was perfect for our quick trip to Seattle.  The location is easy to get to and from the city.  I'm rating 4 stars because there was a huge construction mess in front of the apartment complex that was inconvenient for parking and getting in and out of the place.  However, I think it was temporary for just the month of February. We just wish we had been notified about it ahead of time :)  Otherwise, Maddy was wonderful!"
5682,3521440,2013-02-11,4089605,Andrea,"Maddy's studio is cozy, private, clean, and very comfortable. We were especially impressed with her assortment of guide books to Seattle and the maps and information she has available. It's a great affordable spot very close to the city. Terrific."
5682,3534865,2013-02-13,4813836,Valerie,"Maddy was an absolutely wonderful host!! She redesigned  the layout in the room a little bit, and I think it works very well! Seriously, that bed is ridiculously comfy! Super fluffy pillows, well stocked bathroom, she even has some tea and coffee available for you to brew in the coffee maker when you're feeling chilly. Very sweet, very helpful. I would totally recommend this place to anyone looking for a great space and great value in Seattle! :)"
5682,3608237,2013-02-22,4051573,Alexandra & Daniel,"Maddys apartment was everything we had hoped for, private, self contained, clean and spacious. The apartment was beautifully decorated (with loads of helpful tourist guides and maps) and despite the roadwork outside, we had no problem sleeping with the room feeling essentially soundproof. Overall a great stay!!"
5682,3697221,2013-03-05,889654,Cynthia,"My boyfriend and I spent 4 days in Maddy's place, and it was absolutely PERFECT!!!! It is so nice and cozy, not to mention spectacularly located outside downtown, but close enough for a short drive. We also experienced the road being under construction, but the day we left, they were wrapping things up, so you shouldn't experience any inconveniences. The bus stop is LITERALLY right across the house (Bus 120) and for only $2.25 you can be in downtown in only 20 mins. The bed is like a cloud, and yes, you'll have a hard time getting out of it! :-) Maddy has an amazing collection of information and maps in the studio, so do not feel unprepared! I highly recommend this place!!!!"
5682,3818850,2013-03-18,787248,Janice,I cant quite count how many times (actually at least 5) I have used Maddy and her wonderful Cozy studio for my stays in Seattle. She never fails to make every time just as wonderful as the last. She is a wonderful host and I would definitely stay here again in the future. Thank you for everything Maddy! 
5682,3877625,2013-03-24,149660,Obi,Very comfortable and convenient location especially for getting into town (downtown Seattle).

5682,4203319,2013-04-18,49422,Cory,"Maddy's place was a fantastic stay, the perfect spot for exploring and having a great base camp to retreat to. Everything you need to get going in the morning and to relax after adventures. She was very communicative and provided everything I would need for my stay. Bus lines run right in front of the place and are easy to jump on and get around. A great shopping center is just down the street for easy supplies. This is a great place, can't thank her enough for the hospitality. "
5682,4266959,2013-04-23,5146987,Layne,"Maddy was a wonderful host! We had a great experience with the studio and in Seattle overall! Perfect location, very easy to get to and had everything we needed. She made it easy and much more cozy than a hotel. we loved it!  "
5682,4393368,2013-05-02,5213678,Lauren,"Maddy's studio was great to stay in whilst we were in Seattle.  The bed was very comfy and the bathroom was really nice, with a shower that has great pressure.  Fantastic location just outside of Seattle, public transport right out the front, car parking available on the street and close to a shopping area for groceries. Check-in and -out was a breeze and Maddy was easy to communicate with.  We met her once and she was lovely.  Overall, we had a great time in Seattle.  Thank you Maddy. "
5682,4450462,2013-05-06,5622435,Jorge,"Excellent cozy little suite! Maddy was most accommodating. The room is perfectly furnished and decorated. Location-wise, it's only a couple minutes drive to downtown Seattle and the airport so it was super convenient. Highly recommended. "
5682,4572858,2013-05-13,5858395,India,"Maddy's Cozy Studio apartment was clean, neat, quiet, private and well equipped for my stay. I must admit my favorite part was the bed!!! It was a soft, big, cozy bed :) The bathroom was spotless and sufficient closet space and city guides! Also the location was great for me to get around the city and to downtown. Although I drove a rental car, there is a bus line that ran regularly, right in front of her place. Needless to say, I defiantly felt at home! 

Maddy herself, is very nice with a warm welcoming personality.  She was very helpful in getting me settled in. I would highly recommend staying at Maddy's studio, and I look forward to my next stay!! "

5682,5110814,2013-06-13,4723047,Jody,"My husband and I appreciated how orderly and clean the space was. Maddy came down and introduced herself and made us feel free to ask her if we needed anything. The instructions that she left were very clear and helpful. The kichenette is not ideal for long term visits, but it worked great for us. It was nice having a place to store food and have coffee in the mornings. The location is very convenient to grocery stores and is not far from the airport, which is what we really needed. We appreciated Maddy working with our schedule for acquiring and leaving the key. "
5682,5204513,2013-06-18,3927590,Erin,"My sister and I stayed here for 4 nights in Seattle.  There isn't a whole lot to see or do in this location but the bus takes you directly into the city and drops you right back at the house which was a great thing.
The room was awesome , very comfortable and clean. only thing during our stay was the wifi connection was not very good. Having said that, we were too busy out and about for it to significantly impact our stay!
Would happily stay here again."

The room is secluded from the rest of the home and very quiet. We could hear traffic noise occasionally but it was never loud enough to bother us while we were sleeping.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a nice place to stay. :)
5682,5455576,2013-07-01,5387715,Katie,This place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. It's more like a hotel room than a B and B! Maddy has thought of everything. Plus the bus stops right outside the apartment. We loved it here.

Thanks so much!"

There was a large collection of material on Seattle area things to do.  Maddy was very helpful.  We enjoyed our first visit to the Northwest very much.    
5682,6729227,2013-08-23,6642573,Seth,Enjoyed my stay. Would have appreciated having A/C. Other than that the place was just as described and was overall a great experience.

I was a little worried about finding parking on the street, but it was not an issue any of the nights we were there. Having the fridge was convenient especially with the shopping center just down the way to fill it up with! The location was perfect since we really just needed to be in West Seattle, but was not far from the water taxi or a very long drive to downtown. We would definitely stay here again!

Also, if you're at all worried about a landlord breathing down your neck--don't be! Maddy made sure we were taken care of without bothering us through out our entire stay! "
5682,7032268,2013-09-04,3737611,Meelynna,"Great location! We were able to walk to some great spots for breakfast. There is a supermarket, target and other stores within walking distance. We rented a car and had no issues with parking. Place is easy to get to from the highway and a quick drive into downtown as well. A perfect weekend to check out the beach. Maddy was not in town to meet, but we had no problems getting into the studio! I would suggest this place to anyone looking for an affordable spot to stay just outside the city with parking! "
5682,7145586,2013-09-08,6508560,Ianitt,"Maddy's place was so convenient. It was close to city centre, with the bus stop literally just across the street. I wasn't sure if I would need a rental car or not. I ultimately went without, and had zero problems getting around the city. The place was also spotless and I loved having the en-suite bathroom. Maddy was also always available and very quick to respond to any questions. Thank you for making my stay in Seattle so enjoyable!"
5682,7221643,2013-09-11,7905134,Monica,"Thanks for Maddy for my first time experience of using Airbnb! At first I was very skeptical of using a site that I do not well know of, but wow am I just amazed!! When I first paid the stay with my card and everything, I was so worried because I did not get any contact or reply back as quick (Since it's my first time using) but later on, as the stay date was getting near, I heard from her and I was just less stressed.

Being college students who just want to go on vacation, we were on a tight budget for places to stay. And for 3 nights ($45-50 per day), her place as really affordable!! 

Her place was SO adorable! Really cute and fits my style!! She had everything from her dvd collection to Seattle brochures waiting for you! There was a small fridge for your late night food, microwave, spare paper plates/bowls..seriously..everything was there besides a stove! My boyfriend and I really wished we had stayed longer, but due to complications with my sick grandmother, we were not able to...

Likewise, Seattle was so worth it thanks to her beautiful place ~ Her bed was so comfy as stated and cleanliness was top notch! 

We would go again because Maddy is so kind and considerate. She would text me if she can come by and pick/drop some stuff off at night since she did not want to wake us up in the morning. (Even though it's her house, and I didn't think she had to ask) I really respect her! "
5682,7287621,2013-09-14,5408618,Mike,"The best thing about the room was the incredible level of privacy we got when staying here. It was a lovely, cosy private room with a private bathroom and a private entrance. Maddy did a great job at making sure we were set with fresh towels, coffee, tea, etc. The room was so cosy we almost wanted to stay in and not explore the city! The bus stop is quite literally right outside the window, which means it did get a little noisy, but also means it was convenient to get downtown. All in all, we would highly recommend staying here."
5682,7395192,2013-09-18,7936105,Cindy,cozy is the perfect word to describe maddys place! the suite was comfortable and clean. the little kitchen area was supplied with everything we needed. our stay was just wonderful.
5682,7551019,2013-09-24,7558894,Mao,The privacy was great. We wanted to come earlier and Maddy was gracious enough to let us check in earlier. Thank you! It was also lovely to have fresh towels and a tv for the night we decided to stay in. Because the bus does come right outside you can hear but Maddy provided ear plugs. The only drawback was the day we decided to come back earlier we could hear people walking about upstairs. 
5682,7691812,2013-09-30,4606892,Brendan,"Great stay here, everything was perfect when we arrived, clean and cosy too! Easy to get into town as the bus is literally outside the door. "
5682,7849214,2013-10-06,7871063,Coral,i'm so sorry that i forget to sure this great apartment to other people who looking for house in seattle cause i get sick for few days.i promise this is a great choice maddy's house is great! we stay there 4night and very enjoy it. bus is  very convenient to go to downtown about 20 minutes. house is very clean and warm.anyway is a good memory when we stay in (email hidden)ank u !!
5682,7985485,2013-10-11,7864590,Christie," This place was very clean, the host gave me the privacy I desired but was attentive, and was able to work around a very late check-in time. 

If it matters to you, there are no glasses (just mugs) or real cutlery, and the dining area is really too small to comfortably eat (just a table set up in the hallway/entryway), so the bed is your best bet. I wasn't crazy about the neighborhood, and was uncomfortable leaving my car on the street. The street noise didn't bother me as much as other people have mentioned. The real drawback was the distance from downtown- it took me over a half hour each time...not minutes, as is suggested. 

You can't beat the value, but I'm not sure I'd stay here again, just because of the location. Maddy was great, and even though she lives just above, she was really quiet and I hardly noticed that anybody was there. "
5682,8137750,2013-10-17,7550718,Maggie,"Maddy's place was so comfortable and cozy. It was close enough to everywhere we wanted to be. We rented a car and street parking was not a problem. Maddy provided everything we needed. The room was very clean. We did not get to meet Maddy unfortunately, however it was nice have a private place to stay. I would definitely recommend her cozy home! Thank you so much for your hospitality Maddy! "
5682,8276802,2013-10-23,6429168,Brent,"A great space!  Completely as advertised.  Maddy was very communicative and everything went off without a hitch.  The space was just what I needed.  Comfortable place to sleep in between my adventures in the city.  With the bus stop right out front, I was practically chauffeured home each night."
5682,8595770,2013-11-07,5202892,Ryan,"Loved it!  The place is super cozy and very comfy.  It's a 15-20 minute drive from downtown but there is a bus stop right in front of the place.  We had a rental car so we didn't time out the bus transport, but it was an easy drive in.  Maddy was quick to respond and very welcoming.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in the Seattle area. "
5682,8657207,2013-11-11,3780956,Kevin,A great little place and conveniently located near downtown. I loved staying here. Maddy's a great host -- she was kind and always quick to respond. I would definitely stay here again.
5682,8840656,2013-11-20,10000979,Ansel,"Great location, ample parking, cozy studio. This was my first time using Airbnb. Maddy was a great host. I enjoyed my stay in seattle"
5682,8879389,2013-11-23,292519,Eric,"The room was really clean and well organized. In the bathroom I found sample size shampoo and soaps, plenty of clean towels. The coffee machine was very useful! There is a grocery store and shopping mall plaza just 3 minutes' drive away. This place is located directly across the street from northbound #120 bus route to downtown Seattle, which is very convenient. I can recommend Maddy's place to anyone!
"
5682,9121634,2013-12-08,8614940,Rachael,"So convienent, cute and was perfect for what I needed!! I came up for finals at UW and it was so nice to.have a private clean cute space to come back to after classes. Would definetly recommend and will definitely be back!"
5682,9199720,2013-12-13,1652911,Anna-Jo,The Studio was very clean and close to Westwood Village where you can finde a supermarket and places to eat. The bus stop is in front of the house and it takes about 20minutes to get to Downtown Seattle. Maddy is very helpful and a perfect host. 
5682,9272139,2013-12-17,10207229,Chris,"The studio was exactly what I was looking for during my weekend stay in Seattle. Located only 30 or so minutes away from downtown Seattle and West Seattle via bus, it was very easy to get around especially with the bus stop being located right outside the studio. On top of that, our host, Maddy, was very accommodating."
5682,9341518,2013-12-23,3579049,Melinda,"We loved Seattle! Maddy's bnb was the perfect cozy spot to come home to each night! it is a awesome location - we easily drove into town and across to other areas such as Fremont and University District in 10 mins! It is really close to shops such as Target, supermarket, Starbucks and many food stores, but also close to central Seattle if you want to hit up some of the amazing restaurants they offer! We would definitely recommend Maddys place to anyone who is looking for a clean, warm and comfy place! The bed is awesome and the bathroom is huge and gorgeous! We cant recommend more highly as a great little place to stay in a wonderful town!  We even saw our first snow there! A wonderful way to spend the lead up to Christmas! Thanks Maddy for a wonderful Seattle stay! "
5682,9452308,2013-12-29,10605172,Manon,"We had a really nice stay in Seattle. The studio is really cosy, clean and comfy. It was such a pleasure to come back to this place after a long day of sightseeing. "
5682,9521781,2014-01-01,10084862,Garrett,The place is perfect.  It's small quarters but has everything you need from earplugs and microwave to wifi and coffee maker.  I recommend this place for location as well.  Maddy made it a breeze to get in and out with no hassle.
5682,9851950,2014-01-14,10447564,Yan,"Although Seattle always raining,the suit is warm,it is small but enough for us,we can find everything we need.The suit is clean and we can park the car along the street,it is very convenient.the host is very nice,you can ask if you have any question,we have a good trip in Seattle,thank you so much."
5682,9953301,2014-01-21,8798199,Jeremy,"This place was wonderful. Quaint, is the perfect word for it. Just right for two people, the location is relatively close to the city. Maddy was extremely helpful and reliable when it came to responding to our questions while in Seattle. No bad things to say about this studio. "
5682,10066416,2014-01-28,4190551,Jen,"Perfect place to stay in Seattle. In a safe and cozy neighborhood, and only a few minutes drive to the city center. We had a car and were able to find street parking right outside the apartment every night. Apartment was very clean and had everything you needed for a great stay. Maddy was quick to respond to our questions about booking, and check in/out was a breeze."
5682,10106510,2014-01-31,637530,Nicole,The price/location/room was fabulous.  Parking was never a problem.  Clean room and safe area.  The privacy was nice and Maddy was only a text away if we needed anything.  We would stay here anytime.  
5682,10151347,2014-02-03,6156538,Tony,"Thanks Maddy! What a nice place. This location is about 20min out of downtown by bus... and the bus stops at your front door. Note: The bus to/from the airport (25min ride) stops about 8min away if you are on foot. This studio was quite comfortable, has its own private entrance and a very nicely remodeled bath. A little kitchen/ table area, with coffee maker, coffee & tea was set up. There is also a small fridge which was perfect for us.The unit was clean and well maintained. There was WIFI and a TV/DVD with lots of great videos and a few local antenna channels. I found an awesome little coffee house and fish and chips place about 8 blocks away.  Maddy was there via text or phone and was a very generous, gracious host via text, maybe I'll have the pleasure of meeting her next time. I would certainly stay there if another opportunity was provided."
5682,10307772,2014-02-12,6929374,Caila,"Overall, Maddy's place was extremely comfortable and quiet, and my boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay. We would recommend you bring your own car if you plan to sight-see in other neighborhoods in Seattle for most of your trip.

Pros:
The bed was extremely comfortable, and there were plenty of extra blankets and pillows. 
The place was spotlessly clean.
There was almost no outside noise filtering into the apartment from the neighborhood or Maddy's family upstairs. 
You have your own temperature control!
The shower was spacious, and there were plenty of toiletries available. 
The apartment is literally right across from the bus stop. 

Cons:
There are few utensils available.
There is not much to do in Delridge.

In relation to bus travel only: 
We recommend you download the One Stop Away app to determine your routes.
Although a one-way trip is only 30 minutes to Downtown Seattle, travelling to most other neighborhoods takes an additional 30 minutes. "
5682,10477415,2014-02-21,6398498,Robert,"We were happy to stay with Maddy for our short visit in Seattle. The studio we lived in was very clean and modern. We didnt meet Maddy personally, because we were so busy seeing as much as we can in Seattle from early in the morning until late in the evening, but we had friendly email contact with her and the check in and check out were very easy."
5682,10601778,2014-02-27,11187174,Stacy Ellen,"Maddy's studio is just what we needed after exploring day after day in Seattle - cozy and private. She was prompt to answer any questions we had, and although we did not get a chance to meet her personally, she provided all the amenities we could have needed for our trip upon arrival. Bus transportation is great and stops right in front of the studio, and though it faces the street, outside noise seemed pretty minimal. Clean room and bath, nothing bad to say about this comfy studio! Thanks Maddy!"
5682,10674263,2014-03-03,3631693,Lauren,"I really enjoyed my stay at Maddy's apartment. Her communication was prompt and friendly, and the apartment, itself, was nicely decorated and extremely clean. As has been mentioned by others, bus route #120 stops right across the street and takes you straight to downtown Seattle--which was perfect for me, given I was in town for a convention. Also convenient was the post office located just a short walk away (near the QFC, Target, etc.), since I needed to ship a box of materials acquired at the conference back home to myself."
5682,10818244,2014-03-09,11888162,Xue,"Excellent experience! Clean and cozy studio better than regular hotel or inn contains even mini fridge, microwave, coffee maker and small TV. My boyfriend and I really enjoy our vocation and I will highly recommend to my friends. Free parking!!! You know that finding a parking space in Seattle is hard and expensive. "
5682,10930677,2014-03-13,4743978,Sreeram,"My wife and I had stayed with Maddy during our visit to Seattle. It had been a pleasant experience. We did not get a chance to personally interact with her much as we checked in late in the night when we arrived and were mostly out site-seeing. But,  she made sure that our checkin was smooth and there was everything we needed. She was responsive to our messages before and during our stay. The room was neat and comfortable. "
5682,11031846,2014-03-17,12299673,Gwen,"Staying here was the epitome of hospitality. From the copious amount of books/guides to Seattle to neatly stacked tower of oranges that Maddy provided - this was such a gem. Transportation to the heart of the city was a breeze (I switched between taking the bus and Uber). I would definitely look no further if you're looking for a homey, clean, inviting, easy to access place to stay."
5682,11092068,2014-03-20,11876028,Maral,"The studio was clean, comfortable and in a nice neighborhood. It's completely separated with its own entrance. Maddy was a great host, she was organized and had everything prepared for our stay. Street parking was readily available which was nice given the expensive rates for parking in Seattle. There are a couple of nice bars and restaurants close by and cute little coffee shops/cafes. Overall, amazing experience and highly recommended."
5682,11260171,2014-03-27,11450543,Amanda,"Exactly as advertised! Like staying in a hotel, but better with all the comforts of home. Private entrance, studio equipped with all that we'd need on the stay, we really felt lucky to find this place to stay in! We both used the bus (to downtown / the ferry) and a rented car (to go hiking out of city) and found Maddy's directions spot on. Easy walk to the mall for places to eat/grocery store and the little fridge, microwave, and coffee machine came in handy! Maddy thought of everything to make our stay comfortable and was very easy to contact when we were checking in and out! Thank you!"
5682,11447519,2014-04-03,7022105,Melodie,"My stay at Maddy's was great! 

The biggest plus about this listing, in my opinion,  is LOCATION. The bus stop is literally RIGHT in front of the apartment (servicing the 120 which will take you straight to downtown Seattle in about 20 min) -- I could see it from my window!
The apartment was clean, tidy and well stocked (linens, toiletries, an iron and ironing board, blankets and plenty of movies). Maddy was an amazing host -- she respected my privacy, while still being helpful and responsive.
I would definitely stay at her place again!

Great apartment, great host and great stay!! "
5682,11614511,2014-04-09,5593405,Rod,Very nice place and close to downtown. Check in and check out was simple. 
5682,11858693,2014-04-17,9131742,Exene,"This was my first trip to Seattle and I had NO idea where to go or where to avoid.  This was the perfect little get away space.  The room was well stocked and very cozy.  The bus into downtown is literally RIGHT OUTSIDE the apartment and its only about a 20 minute ride.  Maddy was a great host, very hands off but welcoming and easy to get a hold of.  I even booked an extra night just because my stay was so nice.  I would definitely stay here again, and I just might the next time I come into town.  It was better than a hotel.  "
5682,12747056,2014-05-10,13416216,Megan,"My stay with Maddy was awesome! She was a great host, the apartment was clean, stocked with coffee, toiletries, blankets, and movies! Maddy was respectful of my privacy, but was available when I needed her! I loved that the bus was right outside my window, it made it so easy to get downtown. The target, grocery store and shops were also a close walk, which was great to go pick up a quick dinner or snack! I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to others!"
5682,12947779,2014-05-15,4983521,Amy,"I live with roommates, so I needed a place for my parents to stay during their visit. Maddy's place was close to mine, which was convenient. My parents enjoyed their stay, were very comfortable, and would stay there again. There's a bus stop right outside, a shopping center that is a brief walk away, and West Seattle is a great access point for the city and for Sea-Tac. "
5682,13065883,2014-05-19,12170072,Jenne,Our stay with Maddy was comfortable. Check in was easy and the bus right outside the door provided easy transport into town. Thank you Maddy!
5682,13211935,2014-05-22,13527531,Julia,"We stayed two nights at Maddy's - the apartment was clean and well appointed.  The bedroom was a bit too cosy for our comfort, the bed was up against the wall, but the bed was comfortable.  The bathroom was a good size.  The kitchen was okay.  Very convenient, close to shops and busses to City and airport.  Maddy has provided a nice place for a good price."
5682,13623461,2014-06-01,465488,Chris,Maddy was a great host and very accommodating - she quickly responded to any concerns and questions we had. The studio was great; clean and convenient to everywhere. We would definitely repeat!
5682,13877002,2014-06-07,13906198,Bailey,"First experience using AirBNB was great. The location was great, as the bus to downtown was on the other side of the street and we were dropped off in front of the apartment. The room was clean with adequate closet space for a week's stay. Maddy was very nice and even gave us coupons for Uber and Lyft in case we didn't feel like riding public transit."
5682,14225639,2014-06-15,2247388,Janelle,"We stayed at Maddy's for 9 days, her place is small but it has everything you need! The bed is really comfy and bathroom huge with a great supply of towels and lots of toiletries to use if you want. The house is close to a supermarket, bars, restaurants and a bunch of other shops, plus having the bus directly outside to get into the city was great! "
5682,14775475,2014-06-26,14143033,Kayla,"Staying here was very nice! Lots of closet and drawer space to unpack your things. Large bathroom with toiletries should you forget anything. The small fridge and microwave were nice to have- especially with a target within walking distance- we were able to save money by eating breakfast in the room each morning. The bus stop was very convenient and came through every 15 min or so.  Rented a car one day to go hiking and had no issues finding free street parking right outside. Maddy's place was a great choice for a visit to Seattle!
"
5682,14976942,2014-06-30,7114571,Danny,"This place is awesome.  It's a snug little area with an excellently comfortable bed, and the feel of the place is very cozy, clean, and even a bit luxurious.  I hate waiting for buses to get to the main city area, but given the insane costs of places in city center these days, and the excellent value cost of this place, I'd say it is certainly one of the best options for a place to stay in the area.  Especially given the comfort.  Check-in and check-out were easy."
5682,15133138,2014-07-03,13735520,Mike,"Despite many good reviews here I really must pick up on a few things.
I did not meet my host even though I heard her upstairs many times, only a few emails to tell me the code of the lock box containing the key. No idea why?
The kitchen has no water. You have to use the shower to fill the kettle in the bathroom as the sink there is to small.
The street being a main road into town is very noisy in the morning.
The curtains do not shut out enough light in the morning.
Comfortable Bed Great town"
5682,15497445,2014-07-10,16400436,Kallie,"Our stay at Maddy's was great! The room was cozy and had everything we needed. Microwave, fridge, bottle opener, iron, and all the extras. If you need a place to stay in Seattle, this is it! An easy drive to downtown and close to Starbucks and the QFC. Easy check in, friendly and respectful. Thanks Maddy!"
5682,15750027,2014-07-15,5677470,Athena,"Excellent place to stay while in Seattle! The bus stop is right outside the studio and there is ample street parking.  We took the bus into the city to do all our city site seeing.  As a friendly reminder, if the hwys shut down and/or it is a crazy weekend - it will take longer to get into the city.  We used Uber and Lyft throughout the city and Maddy even gave us a Lyft coupon!  We just had to plan accordingly to give ourselves a cushion to get from place to place.  Maddy was respectful and extremely responsive during our stay.  Definitely stay here while you visit Seattle."
5682,16407994,2014-07-27,6359974,Ian,This is a very cozy studio for someone looking to explore Seattle at a reasonable cost point.  We had an initial problem with the house cleaning when we arrived but Maddy rectified the problem and made it up to us. A great Airbnb host!
5682,16656701,2014-07-31,15365633,Hélène,"We really enjoyed our stay in maddy's studio. Unfortunetly because of a storm at philadephia's airport we only stayed 2 nights in Seattle instead of 3 as we booked at the beginning. Even if we could not talk so long to Maddy, she was very nice an helpful.
The studio was perfectly clean and well located thanks to bus 120 which goes downtown quite quickly.
We really recommend this place!"
5682,16979408,2014-08-05,15651137,Hayle,"I did not meet Maddy but the studio was cozy and clean.  The bus comes every 15 to 30 minutes and it is right in front of the studio.  This studio is close to Target, Starbucks, and among other stores if you need anything.  Overall, this is a great place to stay in if you want to explore Seattle."
5682,17156298,2014-08-08,15745635,Brittney,"Maddy always responded very quickly to questions.  The Studio was clean and was very close to the bus stop to get to downtown.  Her manual was very useful, as we used her code to get a free ride from Uber.  "
5682,17344057,2014-08-11,8025339,Joey,"My wife and I were in West Seattle for a wedding, and Maddy's place was the perfect place for us. It was cozy, but Maddy's use of space was impeccable. There were two closet place for our clothes, and an extra table in the closet if we needed more space. Staying at her place was like staying in a hotel but with added bonuses. She provided lots of towels, a coffee maker, coffee & tea, ceramic mugs, wine opener, microwave, mini fridge, TV, DVDs, maps of Seattle, Seattle tour books, an iron, ironing board, and hair dryer too. She thought of everything!"
5682,17744885,2014-08-17,4588446,Amanda,"From the beginning to the end, our stay at Maddy's place was great! Maddy was very quick at responding to my initial booking request and all the way up to checking out was very straightforward and easy. 

My boyfriend and I stayed here for our anniversary trip and were pleased with the cleanliness of the place and plentiful toiletries and other necessities that were provided to us to make our stay just that much more comfortable.  The space itself is fairly small but I do still think it's comfortable enough for two.  It is literally a walk across the street to catch the bus to go downtown.  Downtown Seattle is just about a 15 min drive as we decided to rent a car instead.   We never had an issue with street parking!  Even with traffic, probably took us no more than 30 mins to get downtown.

Maddy also left plenty of brochures if you have no idea where to go, and also provides a few recommendations for eateries nearby.  Although we did not get to meet Maddy, she was very friendly via email and text.  Definitely recommend staying here for a more affordable option without sacrificing comfort!  Thanks for making our anniversary trip just that much more special, Maddy! We truly appreciate it!"
5682,18188935,2014-08-23,10799059,Abi,I had a wonderful time and the studio was perfect!  The bus stop is right across the street and is so easy to get to downtown Seattle.  The bed was comfy and there was shampoo and conditioner and all the little things you need.  The studio felt like home.  I'd definitely recommend it here for your next trip to Seattle.
5682,18467082,2014-08-27,4636507,Cristina,"Maddy was accomodating.  She met us at the door, even thought we arrived late, around 10:30 pm.  Room was pleasant.  She even provided plenty of tour pamphlets."
5682,18648565,2014-08-30,3820070,Vega,"The studio was very clean.  The bus stop just right across the street, and it's easy to get to down town.
I'll recommend this place for travelers, I had a very nice stay and differently come back a gain."
5682,18979904,2014-09-04,522558,Judy And Kelly,Nice apartment which is very close to public transport and a major shopping centre.  We enjoyed our stay but it would have been good to have a sink in the kitchen area.  Thank you Maddy.
5682,19120966,2014-09-07,7139323,AnDrou,"The place was great, felt like i was in a hotel almost. Private as stated and the neighborhood was cool. It was really nice and added to our wonderful stay in Seattle. It's like all the things she could think of that a person needed, she had it. I didn't have to text her and ask her anything. We also got in town a little earlier than expected (30 minutes) so she found out if the place was ready, and it was, and gave us permission to check in which was really kind. We had no problems with parking or finding the place.  I would def recommend this place to anyone coming to visit. "
5682,19514032,2014-09-14,103194,Tim,"I didn't get the chance to meet my hosts while i stayed in the Cozy Studio in West Seattle. The room was very clean, spacious and i felt right at home there. The bus stop was just outside the door and i took the bus to downtown my first day. It was easy to use and convenient. The Studio was in a great location for my hiking trips to Mt Rainier and Mt St Helens. It was a quick trip to the ferry when i went out to the Kitsap peninsula, as well. I found some good places to eat nearby, most notably the Salvadorean restaurant and bakery on Roxbury. I really enjoyed my stay here and will try to book it again when i return to Seattle in the future! Thanks y'all for having me. Tim"
5682,19876475,2014-09-20,18701853,Melodee,"Maddy provided the perfect place for my family to stay at for a week! As stated in other reviews, she provides many things that are useful to travelers and really makes use of the space in the studio. Location was perfect for us. It was adjacent to a bus stop (which we did not use) and was a very short drive into downtown Seattle. From beginning to end, Maddy was communicative and helpful whenever we had a question. Thank you again for making our stay awesome. We highly recommend her place!"
5682,20100602,2014-09-23,20115482,Tayler,Maddy's place was perfect for our Seattle stay. It was made up to be very nice and welcoming with all of the guest amenities you could ask for. It was an easy drive to downtown and there was always parking right outside. Maddy was quick to help with whatever we needed and professional. Thanks for a great stay!
5682,20493964,2014-09-30,1233862,Natalia,"We loved staying in Maddy's studio. She was very accommodating and easy to get in touch with her when we needed her. 
The space was small and cozy, a great place to relax after some exploring.
Although the location was a bit of a bus ride into downtown it was was close so some excellent pho options. 
"
5682,20986034,2014-10-09,11611535,Kate,"Maddy's place was ideal for us. It was super clean and comfortable, great at the end of a long day out. The bus right out front was perfect.
Maddy helped us out too which we are extremely grateful for."
5682,21379916,2014-10-16,10911129,Tanya & Mark,Maddy is such a great host! Very quick to reply with all questions and confirmations. The studio is as described and was the perfect size for our 3 night stay. Everything you need is available in the studio and is a great location from downtown and other neighborhoods. It is also along a bus line and we always found parking. 
5682,21744983,2014-10-23,5899080,Marlene,"Great cute place, totally get your privacy:). didn't get to meet maddy but everything went great, loved staying there the place is right across the bus stop which made it easier to go in and out"
5682,21944015,2014-10-27,7877730,Nina,"I stayed with my mother for 4 nights in the apartment. We really liked it.  Even though it is not downtown or in a very vibrant neighborhood, the bus stop is literally in front of the house and it only take about 20 minutes to get everywhere. Getting to and from the airport is also a short bus ride away. The neighborhood itself is quiet, but places to eat and to do groceries are at walking distance. There is nothing really that I can complain about. We only saw Maddy once, because she wanted to make sure we had everything we needed, thus a great host. Lots of travel guides about Seattle in the room, and a TV and dvds are available too. The only thing is that the phone signal wasn't great inside, but outside it was. I definitely recommend staying here. "
5682,22299550,2014-11-03,3702895,Sharon,Maddys place is cozy and perfect. The convenience of the busstop literally outside the door was just great for me as I was commuting downtown every morning for conference.  Maddy's description of the neighborhood and everything were on point. Thank you! I would stay here again! 
5682,22510132,2014-11-08,1008024,Annette,"I never met Maddy but the communications and obtaining the key from the lockbox went smoothly. The kitchen facilities are minimal, no sink, stove, or oven. But it is helpful to have a fridge & microwave. The location is convenient to the shopping center and Bus 120 to downtown Seattle stops right in front of the studio. The studio was clean and comfortable with a nice large shower. "
5682,22945116,2014-11-18,18400833,Cody,"The place was very clean, organized, cozy, and came with all the necessities that one would need. The host was very respectful and gave me my private space but was available instantly if needed for advice etc. The area is clean, safe, and right across the street from the bus that takes you straight into downtown. Very easily accessible to many things in the immediate area or a quick bus ride or drive into downtown. Awesome place to stay and would come here again if I visit Seattle. "
5682,23031674,2014-11-21,205170,Terry,"This was my second time staying with Maddy. She's very friendly, and always on hand to quickly answer any questions. The room is pretty big with a generous sized en suite bathroom, is very clean and comfortable. The location is great. Just a short walk to a shopping complex, and a short bus ride down town. I would highly recommend staying with her whilst in Seattle."
5682,23763517,2014-12-09,23946129,Sophia,"The apartment was perfect for my last minute trip to Seattle. Affordable, very clean, and the perfect size! Checking in and out was as easy as it get's and Maddy was great with responding with any questions I had. If you need a place to stay I would highly recommend staying here! You have your own private room, centrally located in a safe neighborhood with the airport and downtown being  a 20 min drive away! "
5682,24000740,2014-12-16,23866305,Tyler,"Accommodations were lovely! Everything was pitch perfect, the neighborhood itself is groovy and staggered and I wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else. "
5682,24073074,2014-12-19,22043191,Roxanne,"Maddy's place was the perfect location easy to drive to and from downtown as well as the airport. It is centrally located between the two. Maddy was so patient and helpful when I had questions, and she responded back quickly. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
"
5682,24634684,2015-01-01,895958,Shana,"Room was very cozy, comfortable and clean, at a very reasonable price. "
5682,24960909,2015-01-04,23074619,Xin,very nice house. Private area
5682,25881699,2015-01-28,25765602,Jc,A great little room for a great price. Nice location: close to shopping center and bus route if needed. The host Maddy is great. Very professional; runs her establishment just like a hotel. 
5682,26125993,2015-02-04,378766,Elaine,"Maddy was very responsive and accommodating. Her place is exactly as described. We thought we would have problems parking on the street, but there was always a spot even after coming back at 1am.  The heater worked wonders and the bathroom was perfect sized. No noise issues and the place had a small fridge, coffee maker, and microwave with a small countertop. It was perfect for us as we were outside enjoying the sights most of the time.  The bed was very comfortable along with the awesome comforter to stay warm.  It came with extra towels and hygiene supplies as needed.  It was everything we needed.  Thanks Maddy!"
5682,26303828,2015-02-09,25481116,Kristi,"Maddy was a very helpful host! She responds quickly and professionally. Everything we needed to know was in the house rules and description. The room was beautiful and had everything we needed, was very much like staying in a hotel except it was much more private! 10/10 would recommend to anyone who is looking for a nice, affordable place to stay in Seattle. Loved it!"
5682,26445238,2015-02-13,12267007,Kahil,Great experience and nice location.
5682,27140701,2015-02-26,27608127,Richard,"I had a great experience during my recent stay in Seattle at this Cozy Studio apt.  The space was clean, just as pictured/described, and in fact, cozy. It was great to have a little fridge, coffee maker, and a few simple necessities handy (paper plates/towels, utencils, cups).  Ample free parking nearby, close to shopping, and adjacent to a bus line.  Though adjacent to a moderately busy street, noise inside was minimal.  I also needed and found an iron (!) available to get some wrinkles out.  Nice.  Easy Host coordination and private access to the space.  Great price and great place to stay.  Recommended."
5682,27425470,2015-03-04,24714435,Amanda,"Maddy was a very helpful & responsive host. She responds quickly and professionally. Her place is exactly as described and the place was beautifully put together. The neighbourhood was very quiet and safe. It was easy to get around on the bus with the bus stop being right across the street and a bus route guide, which she provided. The heater worked wonders and noise issues. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a nice, quiet, affordable place to stay while in Seattle. Loved it!  "
5682,27601877,2015-03-08,4114892,Ray,Great host. Always just a text away with a quick response for anything. The place is small in size with no kitchen yet functional- perfect for short stays where you just need a place to rest. Public transport literally 10 seconds away. Car parking available. 5min walk to nearest food & shopping village and you'll love the comfortable bed. Thanks again!
5682,27767464,2015-03-11,27585335,Amanda,Maddy was very accommodating and answered all my questions timely and satisfactorily.  The place was clean and well kept. We enjoyed our stay here. Thanks Maddy!
5682,27915218,2015-03-15,17312431,Mia,Maddy's place is really wonderful and she was very helpful as well. The location is very accessible to all buses towards downtown and the airport. Will definitely use it again when I go back to Seattle.
5682,28177652,2015-03-19,25767653,Kailee,"This has been the best room we've stayed in so far.  Maddy was quick to respond and friendly.  The room is set up so you are totally removed from the rest of the place, which we absolutely loved.  Being isolated is great because we didn't feel like we were interrupting our host's life.  The bed is awesome and the bathroom is clean.  It even has a fridge and coffee set up.  We left like we could have lived in this place for weeks.  Totally recommend."
5682,28380095,2015-03-23,22173683,Paul,Perfect room to relax in after a day of sight seeing. 
5682,28575096,2015-03-26,29005625,Haochen,Very Good
5682,29257565,2015-04-06,25857523,Justin,We had a great stay in west seattle. Maddy was very accommodating and the space was perfect. The close proximity to the bus stop was very convenient! 
5682,29914149,2015-04-14,27552514,Angus,"Good place to stay. clean and convenient. the bus stop is just few steps from the door. Thank you for hosting.
"
5682,30166785,2015-04-18,27173837,Neil,"What a great little studio! Private, and has everything you need! Never met Maddy, but we communicated very well through texting. The bed was super comfy and just what I needed after a long day of work! Thanks!"
5682,30709763,2015-04-26,30725208,Ahtziri,Staying at Maddy's place was a great experience. It was our first time in Seattle and the studio was perfect for my boyfriend and I. We didn't get to meet Maddy is person but when we arrived everything was so clean. Overall a great place to stay in Seattle! Close to everything. 
5682,30992215,2015-04-30,25635036,Kima,"I was very comfortable and the place was exactly what I needed, great location. It was also very clean and well organized. Maddy was also available if I had any questions or needed anything. Great experience and would recommend staying here. "
5682,31550876,2015-05-06,9293062,Niki,"The apartment was very nice and it had a microwave and coffee maker and an ensuite bathroom and small kitchenette. The bed was very comfortable. It was a neat, tidy, clean, warm and cosy self-contained apartment. The bus stop to downtown was right outside and it was a scenic route crossing the bridge! A bus stop to the airport was a about a block or two away from the apt. There was barely any noise; the room was sound-proofed. 
I did not meet Maddy but she communicated promptly and made me feel welcome. A pleasant experience."
5682,31938543,2015-05-12,22592093,Veronica,We loved our stay here! Right next to the bus station so we didn't need to get a rental car! She always responded quickly and we had everything we needed already provided for us. I had told her it was our anniversary prior to us coming and she surprised us with a bottle of wine. Great place we will definitely be returning to stay there!
5682,32250419,2015-05-16,12371541,Stephen,"Maddy was a very accommodating host.  She made sure that I was comfortable in the studio with providing all the necessary amenities.  She let me know that she was always just a phone call or text away.  

The studio definitely was cozy.  It really had everything that I needed for my stay.  Its location was perfect for me to quickly access downtown Seattle, Alki Beach, and freeways to Issaquah.  

I would recommend this studio to anyone who wants a comfortable place to stay after a long day of exploring Washington.  "
5682,32767081,2015-05-21,10428761,Shennan,The room was just as described. We loved it so much. The bus stop was just across the street which can take us to downtown Seattle in 20 minutes. 
5682,33571237,2015-05-30,28573097,Dawnn,"The reviews are accurate! Very great place to stay when you're in Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet. The best part is that the bus stop to get to the Downtown is seconds away. The bus stop to Sea-tac is just minutes away by the shopping center! The studio itself was more than I expected. Clean, equipped, and COZY. I had a tough time getting out of bed."
5682,34619397,2015-06-10,1330927,Ramon,Our host made us feel welcome from the very beginning.  She answered all our question and welcomed us warmly.  Directions to her home were clear and she helped us find a supermarket and a shopping center near to her home that helped us organize ourselves well and quickly.  She went out of her ways to provide anything and everything needed.  Maddy was a wonderful hostess.
5682,34946750,2015-06-14,30178854,Olivia,"This was my first time using airbnb and I can honestly say it was a great way to be introduced to it! We actually started calling our place ""home"" during the few days we were there. Maddy was extremely kind when we talked and not intrusive at all. It was really private - more so than a hotel. It was a great way to experience the city on our own and get a good feel of the place! She also left items for us to use in case we forgot or needed something. It was a wonderful experience, and a cute cute little studio apartment. I wish I was back there right now!"
5682,35635186,2015-06-21,27742269,Lauren,"This place was GREAT!! It was very much set up like a hotel with lots of privacy. It's a great deal and close to the city. Maddy is very kind and a fantastic hostess, making sure I had gotten the instructions for the place before my trip. You can tell she cares by all the tiny details in the place from the folded toilet paper to the nice welcoming card left next to the bed. This was my first time doing Airbnb and thanks to this pleasant stay, it won't be my last. My only complaint is, when we came back from a long day, the studio was very toasty and overly warm. Everything else was great! The bed was very comfortable, the fridge was very convenient for all the left overs and the room as a whole felt very clean and fresh. A perfect size for two people wanting to see the city. I had such a wonderful time! and I'd like to thank Maddy again for everything!"
5682,36045135,2015-06-24,32625960,Catherine,"We never actually got to meet our host Maddy during our stay, though she was available via text and phone and responded quickly when we had questions.  The space was clean and cozy and looks as described in the photos.  The host provided us with towels and basic toiletries for our use during the stay.  The room includes a mini fridge (with a super tiny freezer space) and a microwave. It also includes a coffee maker and coffee for you to make.  It was right across the street from the bus stop to downtown and was a 2 minute car ride to a shopping center which included Target and other stores and restaurants.  It was about 15 minutes to drive to downtown from here.   We were able to easily find a spot for our car using on street parking, however as the host indicated, do not leave valuables in your vehicle.

Not being familiar with the Seattle area, we did not know what the neighborhood would be like before we arrived.  The place is located on a very busy street which has cars and buses on it into the night hours.   The place does not have AC as indicated in the listing, however we stayed in Mid June, when the temperatures were in the low 80's which made the room HOT.  Opening the window gave some air flow, however the street noise and lights coming in required us to close the curtains which limited the air flow.  The host did provide us with several fans which helped a bit, but I can only imagine how warm it will be in there as the summer proceeds.  

The host does offer wifi, but it was spotty and unreliable during our stay.  "
5682,37048095,2015-07-04,11186380,Liliana,"Mandy's place was absolutely wonderful. It was really easy to contact her when needed and very easy to find the place. The description of the place on the listing is completely accurate. In fact, it was a little bigger than I expected. We had everything we needed and more. I especially enjoyed the books and magazines set out about visiting Seattle. They were really helpful in figuring out places to visit. The place is, although on the opposite side of downtown, very close to a lot of other great places to see and not very far from downtown. Overall, we had a great experience. Thank you, Maddy! "
5682,37446127,2015-07-07,9894009,William,"The ""Cozy Studio"" is a clean, comfortable, and secure room is SW Seattle. For a short stay, it would be impossible to find a place of similar quality without paying the sky-high Seattle prices. Maddy is very professional, easy to deal with, and runs an efficient operation. Due to the existence of the West Seattle Bridge, the city center is in close range to the north, while the airport is a quick drive in the opposite direction. I'll gladly return on my next visit!"
5682,38577900,2015-07-17,23843847,Darien,"We had a pleasant time at Maddys place in seattle. The place was bigger than we expected and was perfect for what we needed. The bed was ultra comfy and it was super easy to get downtown - just across the road was the bus stop! We didn't get to meet Maddy, but the place was set up perfectly and easy to find, so we didn't need to contact her for anything. 
Definitely recommend for someone wanting to explore Seattle!"
5682,39154020,2015-07-21,17031169,Patricia,"My friend and I stayed for 3 nights at this studio. It was clean, cozy and quite welcoming. Maddy's description of her studio was just as she described on her page. The bed was real comfy, I had no trouble sleeping through the night. The neighborhood was peaceful too!
We had some pretty hot weather in Seattle during our stay and I must say it did get hot in the studio. Maddy provides a couple of fans for such times and they were perfect. 
I would definitely be more than happy staying at Maddy's place when I return to Seattle. 
"
5682,40305406,2015-07-30,27573924,Taylor,"What an absolutely amazing place to stay! My (now) husband and I stayed with Maddy in Seattle where we got married and had our honeymoon. Maddy's place was so clean, comfortable, and easy to access. We took the bus from the airport and it stopped literally right in front of her place. 

We had an amazing honeymoon in Seattle, and we are especially thankful for Maddy and how amazing her place was to stay at. So cozy and wonderful. 

Next time we come to Seattle, we are definitely staying with Maddy again if she's still here."
5682,41069837,2015-08-04,4671726,Jennifer,We didn't meet Maddy but her communication prior was excellent and we were able to find the place well. It was very clean and comfortable and super easy to access from downtown Seattle. The bus literally drops off right at the driveway. It is a bit of a commute into the city but not a big deal at all as busses run very late and frequently.
5682,42524170,2015-08-14,34017040,Tina,"Very nice place to come back to after a long day of exploring Seattle. Also very convenient since the bus stop is right in front. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay here. Except for the sad fact that we found three tiny blood stains on the duvet cover. Good thing the weather was hot during our stay, so we did not have much need for the blanket. "
5682,42867847,2015-08-16,19240486,Rosanna,"Maddy's place is cozy, clean, and well stocked. We really appreciated her thoughtfulness in providing water bottles and snacks and all the bathroom amenities you could need. 

Nice sheets/bedding and comfortable pillows. Fans are provided in the closet as there is no AC and it can be hot and stuffy initially. Good closet space and shoe rack.

Street parking is free, but you may have to park on a different street to find a spot late at night and/or move your car in the afternoon (read the signs!). If you don't have a car, the bus stop is very conveniently located right outside Maddy's place! Overall, it is a great place to stay when exploring Seattle!"
5682,43354495,2015-08-19,31016839,Kristin,"Great place to stay to discover Seattle. You have everything you need( bus-stop, supermarket) just around the corner. No problems at all!"
5682,44092061,2015-08-24,5361851,Tina,"Maddy's listing was incredibly accurate, as were all of her wonderful reviews. The space was small, but definitely cozy and everything my husband and I needed for a comfortable stay. She has easy check-in and check-out, with most questions answered already in the house manual. The bathroom was fully stocked. The room came complete with tv and a selection of movies. She also had mini fridge, microwave, and coffee maker (stocked with coffee!). We rented a car and had events in downtown Seattle which we were about 15 minutes away from. Very convenient and affordable (compared to the hotels we might have stayed in!!). I would definitely stay here again, if I'm ever back in Seattle."
5682,44648590,2015-08-28,35972271,Jennifer,"Maddy was a great host from the time I inquired about her charming little place in early June.  She texted me things to do around the area based on my description of me on Airbnb.  We checked in with one another the week I was arriving.  The key was provided in a lockbox which she supplied the code.  When I walked in it was just as described.  Spotlessly clean, beautiful comfortable linens.  I read in some recent reviews ""there is no air conditioning"".  You really did not need it and she supplied several fans which in late afternoon after a very sunny day worked famously to cool off the lovely studio.    There is a lovely dvd library (not that I stayed in and watched movies) travel books and information and best of all suggestions on local food options.  I loved Protelariat Pizza.  GrubHub delivered and it was lovely after a long day in the city to just chill at the studio and unwind.  Its very close to the city (about 10-15 mins without traffic.)  Maddy also had a coffee maker, coffee, small fridge and microwave so you can heat up leftovers from yummy eats in the city.  I will always try to stay a Maddy's place when I visit Seattle.  "
5682,45654795,2015-09-05,32387922,Katie,The place was great! In a cute little part of town and not too far from the city. It was a great drive to and from downtown Seattle. The place had everything we needed and it felt comfy cozy. 
5682,46505034,2015-09-11,41330264,Craig,Great location and a great host.
5682,47035567,2015-09-15,25693123,Bernadette,"Nice location, although it may be hard to explore without a car. About 20 mins away from DT Seattle. A lot of available parking, and conveniently located near stores and food places. Super cozy! Has one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in! I would definitely stay here again! "
5682,47381846,2015-09-18,41773747,Son,"I can't rave enough about my first AirBnB experience to friends and family. I am so glad my first time with using this service is with Maddy. Her listing is very accurate. It is a private place that is perfect for two people. The place is clean and very tidy. Only setback is that it can be noisy with the street right in front (But Maddy provided a sound machine and ear plugs). The bus station is right outside and take us straight to Pike Place within 30 minutes. You can also take the bus or Uber to the nearby shopping center for groceries and supplies. During the trip, I asked Maddy for a flower vase and she replied right away. I got that vase that same night as soon as she got home. Overall, Maddy is a great host and her place is perfect for a couple who are looking for an adventure in Seattle. Thank you so much Maddy!"
5682,47736438,2015-09-21,40719669,Mario,As soon as you walk in to the studio it feels so much like home!!!  Loved the fact that your only minutes away from downtown Seattle and that the bus stop is right front of the studio.  So no dealing with rush hour traffic.  Just sit and wait till you get home!! Maddy was so accommodating and will recommend her place to anyone who is coming down to Seattle!!!  
5682,48867522,2015-09-29,35345254,Cortney,"Just recently stayed at Maddy's suite this past weekend. My husband and I were pleasantly surprised how easy it was to get to from the airport. We rented a vehicle, so we did not take advantage of the transit system. However there's a stop literally right across the street. The place was exactly as described, suitable for 2 of us. It was very easy to get anywhere in the city, being so close to the I-5. Maddy was extremely accommodating, though we did not meet her. She was prompt at replying to us, and was willing to answer any questions we had. I enjoyed staying in the suite, as it felt so much more like home, and there was plenty of street parking for our rental. Will suggest this suite to anyone that is interested. Thanks again Maddy! :) "
5682,49330669,2015-10-03,29768614,Alex,"Great house! It is very clean. A little disappointment is that the house is close to the road and is a little noisy. In all, I felt very happy staying there."
5682,49877247,2015-10-07,35000262,Alicia,"This little suite was perfect for my boyfriend and I, we stayed for 5 days and had a full agenda. We didn't want to rent a car and this location was perfect for convenience (7-11, Target, and Grocery Stores were all less than 10 min walk) and catching rides (it's right next to the bus stop for downtown) the suite had everything you would need just like a hotel towels, sheets, hair dryer, iron, etc. The TV and DVDs were an added touch for winding down after fun spilled days. Maddy was attentive although we didn't need her much because she left thorough directions and didn't ever really ask anything of us. I would highly recommend this place for a single or couple looking for an easy-going non-stressful place to stay in Seattle"
5682,50185714,2015-10-10,910793,Yinzi,"Very cute and warm apartment, located in a quiet area, easy to find. 7-11 just 3 mins away by walk. I've got the change to meet Maddy, she is a very kind lady:)"
5682,50617311,2015-10-13,23314742,Riley,My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay at Maddys place. Clean studio in a great location!
5682,50927322,2015-10-16,7273486,Chris,"Fabulous. Clean, well-equipped, and we even fit a pack-n-play. Maddy is a great host! Thank you! "
5682,51427818,2015-10-20,36540021,Mel,"The studio was perfect for our trip to Seattle.  It is definetly a studio, so any illusions of it being extra roomy should be squashed.  What it is however, is everything you need as a traveler.  Comfortable bed, clean sheets, dvd player with TV and an assortment of DVDs.  Very clean bathroom with towels and toiletries provided.  She also provided a small fridge for any of your left overs from any of the fine restaurants you might find yourself in from downtown Seattle.  I would highly recommend this place.  In addition, she gave us our privacy and although we never met face to face, I never once felt we were a burden. Great place.  Down town Seattle is about a 15 minute drive so take that into consideration when you are enjoying everything the city provides.  "
5682,51697942,2015-10-24,4924250,Becky,Nice studio for the price.
5682,52672513,2015-11-01,34691379,Wendy,"My daughter, Lauren, and I had a great time in Seattle!  We loved our studio accommodations with Maddy and had everything we needed for a weeks stay. 

Bus stop to downtown is right across the street and the stop to the airport is down the street around the corner.  Very easy access.  

We ran the box fan to help with noise control from the street and slept great in the very comfortable bed after long days on our feet sightseeing.    

I want to come back to Seattle with my husband and stay again with Maddy.  Really enjoyed meeting her.  

Rented Red Box movies and ordered pizza from down the street.  "
5682,53239914,2015-11-07,33149525,Jessica,"For our first Airbnb stay, we were absolutely delighted by this place. Very clean, cosy & perfect for a few days stay. The bus stop right outside made traveling to & from the city easy, and the small shopping centre around the corner was great. 

Maddy promptly responded to any enquiries we had, & was a very accommodating, could not fault this stay! =)"
5682,53741275,2015-11-12,37081419,Michael,"Neighborhood felt safe. Place was stocked with necessities (cups, plates, utensils). 

Info for staying at the place was posted clearly and we were provided with everything we could need. 

"
5682,53965011,2015-11-15,25861709,Kenneth,"Great communication, although we didn't get to meet Maddy face to face. It's private, clean and comfortable; perfect for our stay. Will definitely stay here again and recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle."
5682,54307645,2015-11-18,37156912,Sigrid,"Our stay at Maddy's place was lovely! She really gives her guest privacy and since the room is very pretty, clean and comfy it feels like a good hotel. She did ask several times if we had any questions, so if you do she is willing to help. Her response time is very quick! The location is great. It's nearby the bus to the airport and the bus to Seattle downtown is across the street. We had a wonderful time and recommend Maddy for your stay in Seattle."
5682,54704366,2015-11-23,43417333,Giulianna,"For my first experience with Airbnb, I was very satisfied with Maddy's studio.  She answered my questions within the hour even prior to our stay. She was great with the communication! When we had a problem with the fridge, she came right down and fix it immediately. 

It is about 30 minutes from downtown which was a bit of a disappointment but the price was too hard to beat! The public transportation is pretty easy to follow and you can get an ORCA card for an all day pass so we didn't need to rent car or use Uber/Lyft at all. It was also convenient that Maddy's place was literally across the street from the bus stop for downtown. Overall, the studio was sufficient space for my boyfriend and me.  I can see why more than two would be a tight squeeze. The bed was comfortable and, in the hallway, Maddy provided a mini fridge, coffee make, and microwave. It was clean and it does remind me of a fancy motel stay.There were plastic forks, knives, and spoons but I'm not sure if Maddy provides the plastic utensils or if they were left by previous tenants because we ran out of spoons. It was not a big deal, we just went to the local grocery store and brought a box. I did like the Westwood Complex which has a Target, QFC, restaurants, etc. I was a little concerned about the noise because I think that was the main issue with renters. However, we didn't even notice it but we're deep sleepers. Maddy did provide a noise machine but we didn't even use it. Overall, we would stay at Maddy's place again and recommend it to our friends and family! "
5682,55745691,2015-12-05,1421495,Elizabeth,This apartment had every single thing we could have possibly needed! She thought of literally everything and the apartment was so well organized. Plus it looked like a designer had picked out every item in the house! She also included tons of magazines and brochures for things to do locally! And a thank you card welcoming us and thanking us for choosing her. The bed was super comfortable and I never felt unsafe in the area. And the bus line is super close! Also a ton of street parking! 
5682,56031550,2015-12-08,34605890,Grechell,"I had a good experience in seattle and part of it was staying at Maddy's cozy studio. it is really cozy. I dont have any complains about the noise. Its not bad at all. she left everything ready for us when we arrived which made it a lot more convenient. Lockbox was there next to the door, clean sheets, cozy bed, and guides where to go in seattle. Instructions Are left by the door to make everything clear just in case there's any questions. She replies as soon as she can as well, which made it really helpful. Plastic spoon and forks are available, coffee , tea, wine opener and paper plates. The bus is just right outside and going to downtown using car is very easy. the bathroom is clean and she left some essentials to use just in case. Towels are clean as well. She also have some nice dvd collection."
5682,56475729,2015-12-14,43530385,Susan,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Maddy's place. It was exactly as described and was sparkling clean. There are nice little extras in the ""kitchen"" such as tea and coffee.  I felt right at home. Would I stay there again? I probably wouldn't but only because I found out a friend of mine lives down the block and I'm invited to stay there whenever I'm in town. I will and have recommended it to others!  Thanks Maddy."
8296857,55150255,2015-11-28,33617716,Yajing,Really nice and clean townhouse. My family enjoyed spending thanksgiving in Seattle.
8296857,55331686,2015-11-29,16257653,Jean,"Everything was great and they were so prompt getting the unit ready at the last minute. The home was meticulous, great neighborhood and a good time was had by all! Would love to return. "
8296857,56202759,2015-12-10,47274702,Antonia,"Good location but limited creature comforts. This is listed as a 3 bdrm, but there are really only two beds. The third ""bedroom"" just had some foam cubes pushed together (no linens), so if you want 3 beds, be aware. The place was clean and had dishes, ., but was missing basic things in the kitchen like salt & pepper and ice (no trays or ice maker) and we were given a couple of bath towels and there were no extras, and no hand towels or wash clothes at all. Our stay was fine, but in the future we'd opt for a place that includes more thoughtful touches."
8296857,57582911,2015-12-27,28069887,Lu,It was a nice stay. We got everything we need. The house is nice and clean. Just a little bit hard to find parking space. They have a full kitchen for us to use. Great experience. 
6747473,35177877,2015-06-15,34253381,Gary,"Wonderful apartment, great location, great host although we didn't meet Erica her friend gave us a great showaround and told us how to find the parking.  The rooftop deck and amenities were an unexpected bonus in the lovely Seattle weather.  I'd recommend this property to anyone interested in downtown Seattle.  We'd visited with our son and the layout was perfect for three people.  It's 10 minutes walking distance to the soccer arena in one direction and to Pikes Place market in the other.  Even the space needle is only a 25 minute walk away."
6747473,35422663,2015-06-18,35322953,Marina,"Erica was very easy to work with and made sure we had all the details covered for our stay in Seattle. She arranged for us to get into the apartment earlier than check in time since we were coming in from a cruise. Her friend met us at the apartment with the keys, showed us around the apartment, and gave us some advice on visiting Seattle. The apartment was clean and comfortable and had all the dishes, toiletries and WiFi/cable needed. They even had everything needed to do laundry. The rooftop lounge area was amazing! Great views of Seattle plus a place to print boarding passes, etc. We loved playing shuffleboard and pool. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go besides the airport which was just a cheap Uber ride away. We would definitely contact Erica again when we visit Seattle for a place to stay!  "
6747473,35746323,2015-06-21,34645947,Stuart,"My expectations were met.  
Apartment was very clean. Host was pleasant, accommodating and punctual. 
Roof top space has a great view of Seattle and Elliot Bay.  
Garage space a plus.
If you are okay with Pioneer Square this is a nice place to stay. "
6747473,36216998,2015-06-26,13308007,Doug,"Erica arranged for a personal greeting and tour by Rahn, who couldn't have been more helpful and friendly. The place seems brand new  - spotless and modern - yet in an ancient city block. Who doesn't love that? Easy access, elevator, rooftop terrace with a spectacular view of the sound, friendly neighbors and old pub right across the street. The location - on the edge of Pioneer Square and the downtown business district - made it a great place for my business trip and evening decompression.  I would happily stay here again."
6747473,36445384,2015-06-28,23581840,Jane,"I feel so lucky to have found such a nice apartment only a few weeks from booking. This apartment is as described and so much more. My friend and I decided to book Erica's apartment as a last minute getaway and it was probably one of the best decisions of our trip. Erica responds quickly to texts and upon arrival I didn't get a chance to meet Erica but was greeted by her friend who was very welcoming and friendly. Gave us good recommendations for places to visit. The apartment is clean and neat. There's a rooftop with an amazing view. It's literally walking distance to everything - pike market, waterfront, and even the space needle if you're down for the bit of distance. We mainly used the car to get out the city for our morning hike that was an hour out from the city. The only thing is we happened to be there for pride and didn't realize the street the parade it was going to be on was right by us which made it a bit difficult to maneuver around if you have a car and trying to get out and back can be a little difficult, but also good if you want to attend like such events because you won't have to look for parking thanks to the open parking spot Erica has available for you. The parking spot is in a garage also opened to the public to pay for which closes at 2:30 am and opens at 10 am or something like that in the morning, but it's nothing you have to worry about because the garage opens if you have the pass that Erica provides regardless of what the rules may be to the public --definite plus. The location also makes uber/lyft trips relatively cheap if you're going around in the city. The apartment is perfect for 2-3 people, but I would keep it up to 3 max. Erica was very accommodating to my schedule and made things easy for us. And her friend was also available by text if we needed anything. My friend Don's words ""I'm only gonna come back to Seattle only if I can stay here again."" I would definitely recommend Erica's apartment to others and book again if I have the chance. Thanks for everything Erica!"
6747473,36749302,2015-06-30,18637592,Angela,"This was a great stay in the perfect location! Just a few minutes walk from Pikes Place market and the ferries, the location was great. The room was nice with helpful amenities and the rooftop experience was great. The rooftop terrace provided a great view of the water, the sunset, and came equipped with an outdoor grill, full kitchen, pool table, and plenty of seating. I would highly recommend this listing based on the price and location."
6747473,38069777,2015-07-12,30821884,Anthony,"
Our stay at Erica's was very enjoyable. A very nice, neat and clean apartment. There's a lot of toilet amenities and kitchen utensils provided, you can basically just move in. 
And the rooftop area in the apartment was amazing, almost 360* view of the city, pool table, lounge. It's a pity we didn't get to meet Erica, but her friend Sage was very friendly and informative. We'd definitely stay at Erica's if we travel to Seattle again.
"
6747473,38530832,2015-07-16,33756341,Tessie,"This was such an amazing experience. Erica was delightful, responsive, and understanding ( I initially requested the wrong dates!!). When we arrived to the home, we were greeted by her friend, Rahn, who was friendly, helpful, and made us feel comfortable. He also gave us his contact info in case we needed anything for the duration of our stay. So great! 

The place was perfect. Great view, open spaces, and ideal for 2-3 people. I'd have to say the rooftop was the most incredible. We spent the majority of our time looking at the view, watching the sunsets, or lying out next to the water feature. It was beautiful! "
6747473,38866792,2015-07-19,20365293,Spenser,Had a great trip! Erica and her friend were very easy to work with. The location was fantastic and the condo was very nice - very walkable area and close to the water. I would definitely recommend this owner and property. 
6747473,39198531,2015-07-21,12939027,Rose,"My husband and I stayed here for our one year wedding anniversary. It was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. It's a couple blocks away from the waterfront, a short walking distance from Pike Place, near many great places to eat and drink, and has an incredible view on the roof top. If you are looking to experience Seattle, this is the perfect place! "
6747473,39464911,2015-07-23,17248656,Kelly,We LOVED this apt. Wonderful location in between Pioneer Square and Pike Place market. Gorgeous apartment and very clean! Super comfortable bed and a washer/dryer. Highly recommend staying here!
6747473,39777362,2015-07-26,11339180,Josh,"Best deal in Seattle by a mile!
Host:
5 stars
Although we didn't get to physically meet Erica, she stayed in constant communication with us and made it very easy to check in and out. Her friend was very helpful, friendly and accessible.

Apartment:
5 stars
This apartment is brand new and modern. Also somewhat secretly has the best view in town. Guests have full access to the rooftop - a game room, dog run, gym, yoga room (!), lounge with full kitchen,  and outdoor lounge that has full view of Puget Sound and the Seattle Great  Wheel. Loved the new decor, free (!) parking, and security.

note:bathroom sink is oddly tiny, like the size of a bar sink. Not a big deal whatsoever.

Location:
5 stars
This is in the financial district 1 block away from the harbor and central to everything. 98 walkscore is absolutely true. Famous Top Pot doughnuts on the 2nd floor = bonus.

Value:
5 stars
The location alone is worth the price. Factor in the brand new building, rooftop access, gym, game room, new everything...easily the best deal in town. "
6747473,40334707,2015-07-30,35330693,Alicia,The host was great gave us recommendations on places to go eat and things to do. The apartment was clean and we had everything we needed. The apartments location was perfect very close to everything downtown. We walked the whole time we stayed here and a perfect running trail by the water.
6747473,41214924,2015-08-05,1657559,Wayne,"WOW! Is all I can say.  Erica met us at the entrance to the building as we arrived.  She gave us the keys and showed us how everything works.
I could not possibly be happier with my experience in Seattle.  Erica's place is a few blocks from Pike Place Market, the Ferry to Bremerton or Bainbridge Island, the Waterfront, etc.
The place was everything my wife and I could have hoped for and more.  It immaculately clean, had everything you could ask for, and Erica went above and beyond to make our vacation the best!
I would stay there again in a heartbeat, and would highly recommend it to any one considering a stay of any length in Seattle.
Thanks Erica!
Thanks Shellie!
   "
6747473,41612100,2015-08-08,7467620,Cricket,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying in this lovely new apartment. The whole building is new and has great amenities like the gym, yoga room, and the rooftop views are amazing. We spent time chilling on the roof enjoying what may have been the nicest days and nights of the summer. It's easy to walk everywhere from the apartment. We even had a cute street fair on Post Alley our first night. 
We are a couple traveling with our adult daughter. The apartment afforded us a comfortable space for three. Hope to come stay again one day. "
6747473,42135876,2015-08-11,1202804,Jc,"Perfect stay! Erica is a sweetheart and totally on point.  Everything was clean, orderly, and we had all we needed for a terrific stay.  The club lounge and gym were a total bonus.   Thanks Erica!"
6747473,42400465,2015-08-13,29408819,Sabrina,"Erica and her husband were extremely accommodating throughout the trip! The room was clean, spacious, and perfect for two. The building has amazing amenities along with a breathtaking rooftop view. Erica's husband, Rahn, made our move in extremely swift and easy. "
6747473,43050974,2015-08-17,35171831,James,"The host was very organized and helpful during our stay. As a result, we were never worried about having any issues.

The location is great. It is also very central in Seattle, so you can walk to the Pike's Place market or to Pioneer Square, and it is minutes by bus or car to most other neighborhoods in Seattle. The only issue with the Downtown area is that it is mostly office workers and other tourists there. If you want to stay somewhere more ordinary Seattle residents live, you might want to look at a different neighborhood.

The apartment was very clean and had all the essentials, more than you would get in most hotels. The building has a great rooftop with views of the city and the bay."
6747473,43553663,2015-08-20,40719182,Travis,We had a great experience at this airbnb. It is in a convenient location and the building is very nice. I would recommend this to others.
6747473,43963900,2015-08-23,38303023,Rammil,"First off, the place is beautiful as advertised. Very new, clean and well-maintained. It has everything you need to enjoy a comfortable and safe stay. It's also walking distance from almost everything in Downtown Seattle (Pike Place, Safeco field, Waterfront, bars and restaurants).  And even though it's in the thick of everything, it's surprisingly peaceful and quiet when in the room. Communication with Erica was excellent. She is very quick to respond and made sure we were taken care of. We didn't get to meet Erica, but her partner Zev welcomed us when we got there and showed us around the place. Super cool guy and was also very quick to respond to my texts before and during our stay. The parking spot is in a separate structure just a short walk away. Not the prettiest building in the world and getting in and out was a hassle going up and down 4 floors in a tight area, but having the spot was definitely a convenience since it also had 24 hour access with the key card. Didn't need to take it out much anyway since we walked or cabbed it 90% of our trip. Word of advice... when you're not spending time out and about in the beautiful city of Seattle, YOU MUST MAKE USE OF THE ROOFTOP. Zev said it was the best view in the city, and we agree. Went up there during the day and night, enjoyed a few drinks, and even watched the Safeco field fireworks show from there. You can even hang in the game room and play some pool or just hang out. The other people that stay/live there are pretty chill too.  Thanks Erica and ""Wolf""! haha!! We will definitely be looking to book here again if we return to Seattle!"
6747473,44916538,2015-08-30,37066128,Oliver,"Great location and as other reviewers pointed out, an amazing roof area. The only knock (as others have said) is the small bathroom sink.

Erica and Ron were helpful and provided everything we needed. At the moment, they are helping us resolve a parking ticket issue."
6747473,45598373,2015-09-04,35586256,Rawan,"What a great first-time experience on Airbnb! Erica has certainly set the bar high. From the warm (and late-night) welcome we received from Zev- who showed us where to park, took us up to the impressive and fully equipped apartment, and was available for any request or question we had- to the stunning rooftop views and ideal location that was steps away from anything and everything one would need to enjoy this quaint city, we couldn't have kicked off the start to Labour Day weekend any better. "
6747473,46095243,2015-09-07,6040020,Sanjay,"Erica's place was wonderful and perfect for our stay.  The apartment was spacious, clean and well-equipped.  The rooftop was amazing and offered great views overlooking the water.  The apartment is very convenient to several tourist attractions and there is a great doughnut shop adjacent to the building.  The parking space was a huge benefit.  Although I didn't meet Erica in person, she and her boyfriend were easy to communicate with and provided all the information I needed.  I would definitely return and highly recommend Erica as a host. "
6747473,46733350,2015-09-13,23775346,Kiernan,"Erica's place was great! Awesome location, easily walkable to tons of attractions. Very nice and clean."
6747473,47376334,2015-09-18,41292317,Kristina,"We used the apartment for a employee who works out of town and he enjoyed being close to are office downtown. The apartment isn't anything fancy, but is very efficient and clean. Erica and Sage were very accommodating. "
6747473,47766911,2015-09-21,32842152,Heather,"Great experience! Location was perfect! Close to the stadium, pier, pikes market, etc! Hosts were very nice and welcoming. The apartment was clean and enough room for 3 people. The couch pulls out into a bed. Only thing is the bedroom isn't exactly closed off to the living room but lot wasn't an issue. Very cute and modern apartment!"
6747473,48035640,2015-09-22,43806535,Matt,Nice place.  Very clean.  The location is great and the roof top area in AWESOME!

The condo was clean and as advertised with a great bed!  

Location was great & easily walkable to many locations!

I didn't use kitchen but it had basics, setting for four & a few pots/pans if one wanted to cook in!"
6747473,48720699,2015-09-28,7432464,Patti,My daughter and I had a fabulous time in Seattle. Erica made the visit stress free. Check in was flawless and her apartment is beautiful. We so loved spending our first hour upon arrival on the beautiful rooftop facility. What a great view. We could not have been more pleased. The location of the apartment was so close to great restaurants and local pubs..of course the Starbucks around the corner was great too!  The apartment was very clean and comfortable. It was home away from home. Thanks so much Erica. It was our first Airbnb experience and I couldn't have been happier!
6747473,50867400,2015-10-15,592390,Beverly,"Erica's place is really neat and clean. It has everything I needed. The apartment has great facilities with a gym on the top of the building. It also has an outdoor BBQ area. The view on the roof top is magnificent. 

The communication with Erica was great. The check in and check out process is easy and flexible. I would recommend it to anyone who's in Seattle for business or leisure.  "
6747473,51575999,2015-10-21,19933123,Youngsun,"Erica was a wonderful host and the accommodation was lovely, cozy and comfortable. Awesome location close to pier, downtown, pike market, local pub, starbucks..etc.. it was easily walkable to lots of attractions. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. It was perfect for our stay!! Thanks for having us!"
6747473,52336137,2015-10-28,9392729,"Jay, Jong-Song",It is super convinient n comfortable place. I really enjoyed everything I can in Erica's place.  Smooth n prompt responses from Erica and Don are extra bonus! Thumbs up!!!
6747473,52807042,2015-11-01,47732781,Matt,"Erica and crew were great.  They let us into the apartment early in the day so we weren't stuck in that weird hotel limbo time where you've checked out of one but can't check into another yet.  When we met Don, he went over everything that the apartment had to offer, made some suggestions on things to check out, and made sure that we knew that we could contact him or Erica if we needed anything or had any questions about anything.  They were both great hosts, and the apartment was fantastic!  The views are no joke, and there is tons of great stuff to do with in walking distance within the area.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again if I ever make it back to Seattle."
6747473,53262183,2015-11-07,3227139,Karthik,"My mom and I was scheduled to stay at Erica's apartment for 6 days. The apartment was new, well located in downtown, walking distance from pike's market and other attractions. The apartment was very clean and convenient with washer dryer, dishwasher etc. We were met by Don who checked us in. Everything was great till on the 4th day, i was late getting back to the apartment in the evening. I didn't  have my key card with me and happened to ask the receptionist at the desk to swipe me up the elevator. He asked me if I'm a resident and I said no, I'm renting through Airbnb. He then proceeded to tell me that it was illegal to have Airbnb residents in this apartment. 
The next day we got a letter at the unit mentioning the same. In the evening Erica called to ask if we can move to a friends place that night as the building management wanted to do a walk through of the apartment the next day early morning. Since I was with my mom I told them it would be impossible to move that night but we could leave early the next day before the walk through and that I would need a days refund. Don came the next day early morning to pick us up, gave us the refund and dropped us at the light rail station. Erica did not even in check in and her phone was turned off when I tried to call her.
I have used Airbnb many times before. But this experience has made me wary of using it again. I'm not sure if the building policy changed after I rented this apartment as it had really good reviews . I would appreciate if Airbnb would make their policies stricter and verify the people who lease apartments. I would be wary of renting any place from Erica again.

The apartment is modern, charming (I like exposed concrete, etc.), new, and very clean.  There were towels and soap and the option to do laundry as well.  The bed was firm which is perfect and allowed for a great night sleep.  Great location.  I'll definitely try to stay here again.  "
6747473,54423328,2015-11-19,49207950,Sharlei,Great spot.  It was super convenient for my work trip.
6747473,54591972,2015-11-22,45083382,Marcus,"Clean apartment, great location. Walking distance to multiple downtown sites. Host was very accommodating. "
6747473,56865071,2015-12-19,46184643,Alyssa,"Wonderful location, great communication from host, and incredibly quick response to any needs.  Would definitely stay here again!"
6747473,58059764,2015-12-31,50151063,Parker,Awesome place. Perfect location. Everything was clean and the photos match the place. Would love to stay here again
6747473,58363127,2016-01-02,49518403,Michael,"Great location to experience Seattle.  Right by Pioneer Square,  within a short few blocks from the waterfront attractions and Pike Place market. There's a lot of places nearby to have a nice dinner with your familyor a beer at the Irish pub across the ally. The rooftop patio has an amazing view of the Sound."
7363462,39246065,2015-07-21,5390697,Jessica,"Modern Home is very welcoming. Clean and clutter free, many quality breakfast foods to help yourself to. Dario and his manager Ethan are very easy going and helpful. Ethan made me feel at home and I would stay with them again without hesitation. Thanks for the conversation fellas!  "
7363462,39580901,2015-07-24,39087492,Taddy,"Dario and Ethan who manages provide a truly wonderful service.  I don't want to say so many nice things that this place is always full and I cannot get in in the future :-) But its that good!

I loved that they provide free breakfast - eggs, toast, cereals, orange juice, berries and fruits, etc etc.
I love that they've just done the place up and everything feels designer, new, and clean.

The location is awesome in terms of restaurants.  I am a vegan and i found some of the best vegan restaurants I've ever been to within 10-minutes walk.

Free wifi works great.  I was able to sit quietly and get a lot of work done on my laptop.

Ethan is incredibly helpful and really keeps the place spotless and creates a warm ambience.

Its thoroughly recommended.  These guys are taking airbnb seriously, and creating an environment that just beats a hotel hands down, and way better value for money. 

Flowers in the bedroom, and plants in the bathroom. nice candles. Lovely decor.

Excellent!

7363462,39847857,2015-07-26,4266210,David,"Clean, safe, and welcoming. Had a good stay, would stay again."
7363462,41028706,2015-08-03,6636403,Kellye,"Very cozy room and easy to navigate, quiet neighborhood. There was a bit of trouble with the bed but it was fixed right away. Very busy hosts, though. I usually have my own agenda and it doesn't bother me, but others may expect more hospitality from the host."
7363462,42241441,2015-08-11,15695637,Chenjerai,"This room was exactly as advertised and perfect for my needs!
The room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. Everything that I needed in terms of internet, food, access etc. was clearly labeled. 
The breakfast and access to the kitchen was great. There was a nice variety of options. The host was pretty timely in communication. "
7363462,42607436,2015-08-14,12349015,Amit,"Room was as described, everything was clean, well-organized and self-explanatory. No problems. I would probably do a 1-2 night stay again. "
7363462,43125186,2015-08-17,39883046,Soleil,"Had a pleasant stay. The place was clean and everything was well-stocked.

The only thing to be mindful of when staying in this room is that you can hear people go up and down the stairs and it's pretty loud (the bed positions your head right next to the stairs). Thankfully, there didn't seem to be a lot of people in the house when I was there so it wasn't an issue. If you're a light sleeper it might be more of a problem."
7363462,43586613,2015-08-20,4200078,Rushyan,"I had a wonderful stay in the Pink Room.  It is exactly as pictured and described.  My interactions were with Ethan who was prompt, responsible and an overall nice guy.  This place felt a bit like a hostel in the best way possible.  I got to come and go as I pleased and met interesting fellow travelers.  

Would definitely recommend this place to anyone wanting a clean, comfortable and easy place to stay in Seattle!"
7363462,44621979,2015-08-27,21357933,שקד Shaked,"Dario's place is very nice, clean and friendly home. Its close to bus lines that go downtwon but it takes some time to get there.. I didnt actually met him but Ethan that live and work at the house was very nice .
I met few interesting and nice people and it's really fun when you travel alone."
7363462,45414963,2015-09-02,13663956,Nick,Great overall experience. Easy check-in and coordination with Dario.
7363462,46097003,2015-09-07,1411249,Lenora,"I was impressed by how much was provided for guests including food, towels, and some misc. items. The room was cute and everything was super clean. 

That being said, this was more like a hostel/guest house experience than someone's home, complete with a key code to get in, multiple guests, several international people cooking at the same time and common spaces that felt pretty sterile and unlived in.

 That's not really a criticism, just different than what I expected from an AirBnB experience."
7363462,46434484,2015-09-10,6435324,Daniel,"The location was about 20 minutes by bus to downtown. Close to the UW and the university district. There was a little delay in communication but nothing too bad, nice and clean house and is perfect spot for anyone visiting UW. "
7363462,46682825,2015-09-12,10136179,Herb,"The home was lovely and clean, the bedroom was big enough for my belongings and to get comfortable. I don't think I've ever felt better quality sheets in my life. Great stay!"
7363462,47510263,2015-09-19,37138936,Tomaz,Awesome place. Had a bit of a security problem but we fixed it. 
7363462,48747149,2015-09-28,42177513,Kevin,I did not have the chance to meet Dario but everything was as advertised.  The bathroom was clean and the wifi worked extremely well.
7363462,49076549,2015-09-30,10574133,Ed,Dario was easy to contact w questions.  Place worked out perfectly. 
7363462,49297987,2015-10-02,36503218,Moana,"Very clean, quiet, great breakfast! The location is also only ten minutes from plenty of different restaurants and bars. Would stay again."
7363462,50294391,2015-10-11,4660928,Enrico,"I really enjoyed my stay in the Pink Room.
The house itself is conveniently located a short walk from the University and it's accessible by buses. I had no troubles checking in or out and the communication with Dario and Ethan was quick. The room was clean and comfortable for my needs. I really liked the kitchen with available breakfast for all the guests. I recommend this room if you like being by yourself and minding your own business in a quiet and clean house."
7363462,50686486,2015-10-13,21408485,Adrian,"Good value, worked well for my needs and a nice walk over to the University. Also enjoyed having Ravenna park nearby."
7363462,51493750,2015-10-20,46190711,Erik,I recommend this place! Perfect to stay. 
7363462,52752413,2015-11-01,46662177,Virginia,I loved this room and house!!! The Pink Room is a cute small bedroom and it was perfect for my stay - just the right price and size. I liked the way the house was set up. It was very comfortable and quiet. All of the house guests seemed at ease coming and going on different schedules. Very laid back but respectful. I loved the University District. I took the bus everyday and was able to get downtown easily. Ethan and Dario really know what they're doing and have come up with a perfect AirBnB formula. The breakfast was a very nice bonus. I would definitely stay there again!
7363462,53524620,2015-11-09,5215460,Jessica,"It was great. The room was ready way before I arrived, which I appreciated. It is a lot smaller than I thought, but that was okay. There was no pressure to be social or converse with people in the house which is what I wanted. It was always very quiet, except when I would hear someone gettinf ready in the bathroom next door. I only met Dario very briefly and that was good enough for me. The bathroom is right next door which is convenient. The rooms and the entire house are always clean and everything was in stock. Would do again. "
7363462,54789043,2015-11-23,40658564,Jianqing,"This house is in a good location,quiet,but it is not so far from downtown.I will still choose it next time."
7363462,55139398,2015-11-28,18772032,Chuyuan,"I had a good time staying in Dario's place. The room was clean and warm, and everything worked well in the house. We did have a lot of choices in breakfast. I had a busy schedule so I actually haven't seen Dario and his roommate, but they have set everything well and ready."
7363462,55678416,2015-12-04,26127307,Marina,The room was nice and clean. The location is awesome. Lots of buses very close to the house. Dario wasnt there but his friend Ethan was there to help. I would recommend this place!:D
7363462,56730346,2015-12-17,9009347,Benjamin,"Just as with my stay in the property's tangerine room, the Brown House operates very efficiently for airbnb guests. UW is certainly walkable, but there are also many convenient buses there, downtown, and elsewhere. The neighborhood feels quiet and safe and the room is accurately portrayed."
7363462,57105205,2015-12-21,9728237,Erol,Great spot. Easy to walk and grab food.
7363462,57371656,2015-12-25,29118862,Alayna,"Cozy and comfy, great location-- near bus lines, grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.  Dario and Ethan were easy to work with and provided for a great experience.  Really nice to have breakfast options provided.  Would definitely stay again."
4645208,29774187,2015-04-12,30004804,James,This was a great house in a great location! I would recommend this house to all my friends and family.
4645208,30266346,2015-04-19,29599161,Shanti,We really enjoyed our stay here! Jeff was wonderful - he accommodated our large group at the last minute when our other airbnb reservation cancelled on us two days before our arrival. He was quick to respond to our random questions that popped up during our stay.  The house itself is gorgeous and homey - it felt like staying over at a friend's place for the weekend. The neighborhood has lots of great restaurants only a few blocks away and downtown is a quick drive. We would definitely stay here again.
4645208,34967604,2015-06-14,18857623,Carlos,Excellent experience and location! The house is as good as it appears to be. Very cozy and clean. 
4645208,35679280,2015-06-21,25754179,Stephen,The listing was accurate.  It is a large house in a great location.  It is set up as a family home - but 3 of the rooms have double beds or bigger so it would be fine for a number of adults.  There are 3 full bathrooms. Overall a positive experience.
4645208,36397332,2015-06-28,3677858,David,"The home is in a great location in Queen Anne - about a 10-15 minute walk to shops and restaurants and a 10 minute car ride to downtown Seattle.

The house was perfect for hosting my group of 10. There was ample space for everyone with all the furnishings you would need to make yourself feel at home. Jeff was a great host and made us feel welcomed. He was more than accommodating with our travel schedule (i.e. allowed us to drop off our bags early and gave us time to checkout) and he made himself available for any questions we had during our stay.

"
4645208,37989756,2015-07-12,17213137,Heidi,Great place! Jeff is an outstanding communicator. 
4645208,38836142,2015-07-19,6176755,Adam,"Jeff's house was beautiful and just as we expected. There are many beds so it was a great place for a group of friends, and nice to be able to walk to get coffee or food. Jeff was easy to work with as a host. "
4645208,40538529,2015-07-31,26538894,Mark,"Great location,  great communication. . Thank you"
4645208,40744078,2015-08-02,17760062,New,"This was a great place to stay for a group to stay. The house was clean, the bedrooms and bathrooms were great. The living room and kitchen were also well-appointed and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend this house! "
4645208,41736054,2015-08-09,30219066,Zach,"Listing description was accurate to a T.  Fantastic house, only downside being no AC, but it was clearly stated in the description.  Host was very accepting and open with communication, even when some issues arose.  The biggest issue with the house is the neighborhood.  Any noise after 10pm outside carries across the whole block, and with no AC everyone's windows are open.  This basically means you're housebound after 10pm.  All in all though, great location, fair price for what you get, and a nice host."
4645208,42832053,2015-08-16,5100038,Gina,"Jeff was a great host. Very quick with communication and clear with directions. His house is beautiful and in a wonderful and quiet neighborhood. We came to Seattle on a family trip (8 adults, 1 toddler and 1 infant) and couldn't have asked for a better location. Lots of rooms with large beds. and plenty of bathrooms. Overall a great experience, and would definitely recommend Jeff and his home for your group stay!"
4645208,44190894,2015-08-24,19873251,Xinjie,The house is very clean. The host is very nice. We really had a good time here!
4645208,44712227,2015-08-28,19782397,Ben,This was a beautiful house in a great neighborhood - close to excellent restaurants!
4645208,44891067,2015-08-30,1541415,Monica,"We had a great stay at Jeff's house. Plenty of space, beautiful decor and it was so nice having three bathrooms even for our small group. 
Queen Anne is such a gorgeous neighborhood and was the perfect location for the wedding we attended. 
Jeff was very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend."
4384095,22805101,2014-11-15,21143545,Oliver,"Ich bin froh diese Unterkunft gefunden zu haben, 
Jerome ist sofort sympathisch und ein wunderbarer Gastgeber.
Man fühlt sich gut dort, es ist sauber, alles gut organisiert und praktisch.
Jerome hat alle Räume nett eingerichtet und ist stolz auf sein Haus.
Mehrere Bushaltestellen in der Umgebung, der Weg in die Innenstadt ist einfach zu finden.
"
4384095,28765011,2015-03-29,14996022,Erin,"I'm so glad I stayed with Jerome! His hospitality began when he met me at the LINK station to help me get to his home, and I enjoyed our conversations over coffee in the mornings! I was also very happy with the Green Room, which is comfortable and plenty spacious, with a large closet, desk, reading lamps, and book shelf. Nice bathroom next door. Good kitchen downstairs to share with Jerome and other guests. It's very easy to get around Seattle from this place (by foot of bus), and nice to stay in a lovely residential neighborhood instead of the crowded bustle. And again, Jerome's a very warm and outgoing, friendly host!"
4384095,29877861,2015-04-13,30474078,Antonio,"Jerome es una gran persona. Honesto, tranquilo, se puede hablar con él de cualquier cosa. Siempre se interesa del bienestar de tu visita. Tenia el vuelo a las 3 de la mañana y me dejó estar en su casa hasta las 24 horas. Muy recomendable."
4384095,30269801,2015-04-19,3658885,James,Jerome was a very welcoming host who made my stay extremely easy and pleasant. I will definitely look to stay with him next time I am in Seattle.  Thanks Jerome!
4384095,31022877,2015-04-30,28944056,Terri,"It was a delightful experience.  Not everybody gets excited about miniature bench vices and washing machine repair, but I do, so it was a great time!  Jerome is the kind of person you would want for a life long friend.  Stay with him - if you're good people you won't be disappointed.  Check out his You Tube videos."
4384095,31853781,2015-05-10,32718843,Ryan,The room was exactly as described. Easy access to the city by bus or cab. Great neighborhood. Jerome was helpful and provided information on how to get around and what to see and eat. 
4384095,32041869,2015-05-12,4744193,Nigel,"I had a fantastic stay at Jerome's home, he was accommodating with my check in time, gave me directs where to go for a walk and we sat and chatted with a lot of good laughs."
4384095,32581184,2015-05-19,31855548,Léo,Jerome really made me feel at home and was very helpful. Both the room and the house were perfectly clean. The sound proofing between room is quite good and you really have your privacy. The house rules are very easy to get adjusted at. I spent a wonderful time at Jerome's and I definitely recommend to stay at his place! 
4384095,32903237,2015-05-23,12710941,Jarret,"Wonderful man who makes you feel right at home. Very clean, nice house. Definitely the best place I've stayed on AirBnb and the best host. Dude even has a bidet installed on the toilet. Great to talk with in the morning, lots of interesting stories and taught me a lot about Seattle which was great as a first time visitor. Getting to the tourist spots isn't too bad as there's a few buses that come by the area. But it was hard to get up and leave in the morning with how comfortable the place was. If you're looking for a clean, warm neighborhood spot to stay in Seattle this is your place. "
4384095,33029607,2015-05-24,32918648,Travis,Fantastic location! Beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to Seattle's best things to do. Jerome is a very friendly host that does a great job at making his guests feel welcome. The house and rooms are very clean and organized.
4384095,33710924,2015-05-31,28740487,Peter,"Jerome was an ideal host, friendly and warm in his welcome, helpful with bus routes and other information about Seattle, and willing to chat, but without being intrusive.  He had thought about guest's needs and the room was clean and neat.   He made sure that guests respected each other."
4384095,34029456,2015-06-03,33766938,Kevin,"My stay at Jerome's residence was very pleasant. His home was very neat, organized, and Airbnb ready. The neighborhood is quaint and I personally felt safe walking through on my way to downtown. Jerome is an absolute pro and I would be more than happy to return to his residence. "
4384095,34445594,2015-06-08,32598631,Dustin,The place was gorgeous and in a beautiful neighborhood. Jerome was a great host and good conversation. I was up in Seattle for an annual convention and will definitely look into staying here again.
4384095,34748336,2015-06-11,25908642,Seok,"I had a peaceful time when I was staying at Jerome's place. He was very welcoming and gave me great advice on transportation. The room and bathroom were both very clean. Everything went smoothly as expected! Thank you, Jerome"
4384095,35045936,2015-06-14,35505128,Jessica,"Jerome was an awesome host! He was very welcoming, and has the Airbnb process down. There are four rooms for guests, which are each assigned a color. Each color is given a shelf in his fridge and a cabinet to keep food in.  There are locks on the bedroom doors. This was my first Airbnb experience. My friend and I felt very safe in the neighborhood and in his home. Would definitely recommend to others."
4384095,35115249,2015-06-15,27658543,Lisa,"Jerome was a wonderful host.  This was only my second Air BnB experience and it couldn't have been better.  The room (and whole house) was quiet , clean and comfortable. It is in a great location - far enough from the city to be quiet and residential and close enough that you can walk to Pike's Market, the aquarium, the convention center and all of downtown.  Jerome was friendly, welcoming and flexible.  I wasn't sure of my arrival time and even with short notice he was there to welcome me and give me a key when I arrived.  Jerome was perfectly comfortable letting me do my own thing but generous with his time and resources - offering local advice, transit information, fruit or water just when I needed it.  It really was like staying with a friend."
4384095,35355577,2015-06-17,2869738,Stephen,The host was very welcoming and explained all the workings of the house.  The neighborhood was very lovely.
4384095,36022539,2015-06-24,30676587,Ashley,"Jerome was a warm and welcoming host. He communicated readily with me prior to my arrival. My room was as described  ....... well appointed, spacious and very clean. Jerome was always able to provide advice about getting around Seattle - this was a great help as I relied on pubic transport. Would recommend a stay with Jerome."
4384095,36447045,2015-06-28,27246260,Elizabeth,"My first Airbnb experience at Jerome's place was welcoming and wonderful! Everything was exactly as described and my boyfriend and I were greeted with lots of great suggestions for Seattle. Jerome was knowledgeable about the city and transportation and always answered any questions we had. There are several bus stops by Jerome's place and each day we were able to take a short ride into Downtown to sight-see and eat at local restaurants. 

I liked that everything at Jerome's house was labeled with the color designated for each room that guests are staying in. We had access to the common areas and our own refrigerator space as well! It was a very clean house and if I came back to Seattle, I would definitely hope Jerome's place would be available to stay again. "
4384095,36606281,2015-06-29,27188461,Omer,I was staying in every room the jerome has in the past couple of weeks and it was amazing!  Everything is comfortable and jerome is an amazing person and he helped me with everything i need.  It was nice to chat with him and here more about united States =)  definitely recommend
4384095,36796434,2015-07-01,5323480,Chris,"I really enjoyed staying with Jerome. I travelled from the UK and so greatly appreciated his help with directions and travel before I arrived, along with his suggestions for places to visit during my short stay. The house is located very conveniently along the bus route 8, which goes into the heart of Seattle as well as - in the other direction - taking you to the link station that goes to the airport. Travel costs was very affordable, too, totalling just over $5 at peak times, as Jerome let me know beforehand.

Jerome also made sure I was supplied with water and fruit, washed my clothes and generally went out of his way to make sure I was comfortable.

Jerome also gave me alot of privacy, but also invited me to chat when I was in and it was obvious I wanted some company. He's certainly a great person to talk to, with many stories to share. It was an absolute delight to spend some time with him. I'd certainly stay with him again were I to visit Seattle. I would highly recommend staying with Jerome."
4384095,36997783,2015-07-03,7885283,Ajay,"Jerome and his house are both fantastic! The room was exactly as represented and it is abundantly clear that much thought was put into preparing the house for airbnb guests. The fridge, cupboards etc were all clearly marked with lots of space for stuff should you choose to leave it there, the house was super clean, and the ceiling fan worked miracles in the heatwave. The house was well situated for exploring much of Seattle, easy and accessible buses, but I walked everywhere. It was a nice addition to have individually lockable doors, which I've never had before. Close to grocery stores, a few restaurants, a farmer's market, not too far south of Capital Hill, and super close to Lake Washington. I'll definitely make a habit out of staying here so long as there's room because I tend to come through Seattle every now and again. 
Jerome was super friendly and helpful in terms of flexibility, offering advice, letting me stash my bags after check-out for a few hours, and awesome for conversation and the sharing of fruit! We had a good few conversations when crossing paths in the kitchen, covering a wide range of super interesting (and important) topics. "
4384095,37195609,2015-07-05,35165476,Dakota,"The set up and accommodations were perfect. Easy to come/go. Never any issues with other guests or bathroom usage.

Great location. Only a $9 Uber ride to Capitol Hill area.

Jerome was extremely helpful and friendly.

Only thing I would change is a direct fan in the room. The time of year (heat) made falling asleep difficult with only a ceiling fan. 

I would definitely recommend staying with Jerome!"
4384095,37605625,2015-07-08,5834794,Imad,"Jerome's place was convenient and close the bus stop. From there, we were able to access the train, downtown, airport etc. The place is neat and Jerome was very friendly and explained some of the tips to help make our trip more comfortable. I would stay again ! "
4384095,38354840,2015-07-14,4990289,Jason,"Jerome is a very friendly host. The house is laid out very well for hosting visitors. Each room has a lock, so your stuff is safe when you are out and about. The place was clean and the rooms had everything we needed."
4384095,38899135,2015-07-19,37066507,Stephanie,"Jerome was a great host! He was very acommodating, especially when upon my arrival at the train stop at 11:30pm, he picked me up so that I didn't have to take the bus. 
Jerome is a great conversationalist and I enjoyed  swaping stories with him while snacking on bowls of fresh cut friut.
Jerome's home is approximately a 5 minute walk to the bus stop, a 10 minute ride to the Mt. Baker transit center and a 20 minute train ride to Pioneer Square.
His home is simple, yet comfortable and it will meet any guest's basic travel requirements.
Overall, I enjoyed the acommodations and Jerome's company.
I will definitely stay again if I'm travelling to Seattle!"
4384095,39654987,2015-07-25,10179317,Lillian,Everything was excellent. Jerome was a great host and I highly recommend this place.
4384095,40016596,2015-07-27,38509766,Dave,"Jerome was there when I arrived, invited me into the kitchen, and we chatted for a while. He was very welcoming. The house and the two rooms I stayed in during my three (nonconsecutive) nights, and the bathrooms were immaculate, and the house seems in excellent shape. The neighborhood is attractive, pleasant, quiet, and very green. The house is about 2-3 blocks from Lake Washington which, if you haven't been to Seattle, is quite beautiful. Had I had a little more free time I would have taken a long walk in the neighborhood.

I had a rental car, and it was maybe a 10-15 minute drive to some of the hot spots on Puget Sound, and probably a similar distance to the University of Washington.  

There is some airplane noise--not enough to bother me, but people are different about this sort of thing. Overall, Jerome offers an excellent value (I grade hard, but I would give five stars on the value). I hope to come back to Seattle in the next year or two, and if I do, I hope to stay here again. "
4384095,41791955,2015-08-09,37375662,Derek,"Jerome was a wonderful host! He was warm and welcoming, as was the house. It's located within walking distance of downtown and from several bus stops. Jerome always made sure I knew what bus to take and had many recommendations of where to go and what to see. He also made sure I had fresh fruit and water before I headed out on my daily adventures. "
4384095,42323398,2015-08-12,2663184,Carolyn And Nathan,"Excellent experience.  Jerome was incredibly welcoming, cheery, and helpful, meeting all of my needs and then some.  His house was impeccably clean and well-organized with easy access to downtown Seattle.    "
4384095,42711229,2015-08-15,37849143,Jungheum,"It was very nice stay
If I go seattle again, I will stay same place ^^"
4384095,43395455,2015-08-19,6924272,Hans,"Jerome is a friendly host. Lovely house in a nice neighbourhood. Ideal location. The room is spacious and convenient. Everything is very clean. We could towels, fruit and water, which was nice too. Overall, a great experience."
4384095,45273653,2015-09-01,38801581,Mason,"My first Airbnb experience was fantastic thanks to Jerome. The room was very clean and comfortable, and there was plenty of fresh fruit and bottled water available to guests. Jerome had plenty of helpful advice on how to get around the city—all in all, an excellent host.
"
4384095,46440365,2015-09-10,36579423,Patrick,"Jerome was a great host. Clean house, good, safe, and quiet location. Quick walk to the bus stop if you need it, or a nice walk to downtown. Jerome was very welcoming and easily accommodated my late check in. Had great advice about the city and told me of some places to check out that I may have missed. So nice!"
4384095,46957040,2015-09-14,5669757,Michelle,"Jerome was very friendly, house was super clean, and the bed was comfortable! Great experience!"
4384095,48099873,2015-09-23,42217826,Ian,"Jerome was an absolute pleasure to be around! He has definitely earned the ""superhost"" status from Airbnb! When my boyfriend, Connor, and I arrived in Seattle, it was exactly how he said it would be to get to the place! He greeted us at the door, took our bags up and explained everything; we felt completely taken care of and had nothing to worry about. Every morning Jerome always tried to have some fruit available (which was incredibly nice as we didn't expect any to be available when first signing up for this website) whether that was a banana or a mix of strawberries and blueberries; and he always had either room temp. or cold water for your preference! Everything he detailed in the rules was there and was completely easy to follow. Connor and I thoroughly enjoyed being around him to hear about his stories or more information on where to go, how to get there, etc. Honestly, I don't know what more to say but that Jerome is an amazingly awesome and fun man to be around; this past week that we were in his son, son's wife and children were there, who Connor and I got to meet briefly... Everything you want and more was with Jerome and he created that environment! Kudos Jerome and hope to see you in the near future! We will be continually looking into decreasing our bodies acidity! hahah"
4384095,48738996,2015-09-28,13755521,Simone,"Jerome was a fantastic host-- he was extremely friendly and organized. His home is immaculately clean (even with a full house of guests!) and it is very, very conveniently located for all sorts of Seattle sightseeing."
4384095,49639558,2015-10-05,9165223,Anna,"Jerome is such an awesome host! He was in contact with me before I got there and making sure I know the area that I can venture off every day feeling safe and coming back soundly. The neighborhood is so peaceful with transit, the lakeside, and even the foot road to the West Side seemed easy to do. The house is simple and straight to the point - for guest from everywhere to enjoy a quiet stay and coming back to peaceful night's rest. The kitchen is open to make quick stacks and Jerome provides fruits to fuel those early mornings before exploring the town. Had some great conversations about Seattle and Vancouver, which is great information that I'll come back to visiting. Thanks Jerome!"
4384095,50318430,2015-10-11,5992629,Donna,"I can't say enough good things about Jerome and my stay in the Green Room. Firstly, there is no reason not to stay there - the location is great, the house is exactly as described (and clean, quiet and secure) and Jerome is just an all-around great person! He goes out of his way to make you feel at home and to help you out in any way possible (he bent over backwards to help me and provide information, guidance and enjoyable conversation). I would have posted this review earlier if I hadn't have been on the road again (without wifi) ...but I would love to stay again, if he'll have me... "
4384095,51757942,2015-10-24,44983463,Hae Jin,"The room was exactly like it was pictured and everything was so clean! Jerome was super friendly and had plenty fruits for breakfast in the morning that he offered. Jerome lets you have your space if you need it but if you need to ask for help or just want a conversation with him he was always available!! He also shared a lot of information about seattle and interesting stuff to do as well as times to avoid for traffic! 
I would highly recommend Jerome's place!"
4384095,52614253,2015-10-31,45957673,Becca,Jerome's home is very clean and quiet. It is in a very residential part of the city that feels quite safe. He is always available and at home for assistance. 
4384095,53145136,2015-11-05,42967263,Seok,"It was great time for staying Jerome's house. He is very kind and have many talent. His house is very clean, quite and safe."
931785,7373092,2013-09-17,8111835,Garrett,"all the guests were very impressed with the cleanliness, amenities, and location.  I would definitely select this location again.  Thanks"
931785,7930545,2013-10-08,1447105,Marty,"Awesome location, tons of restaurants and bars nearby.  Great building and unit.  Clean.  Professional check-in and check-out."
931785,8838016,2013-11-20,7706850,Kate,Our stay was very nice!  Super close to a lot of cool shops and eateries.  Had a small view of the water from our balcony.  The building had great amenities and the concierge was very helpful!  Would definitely stay here again.  
931785,13539201,2014-05-30,14060810,Jimmy,Place was in an awesome location. Very clean and close to everything... Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle that's close to everything!!! 
931785,16424309,2014-07-27,17772636,Kristin,"The apartment was very simple and was exactly what we needed: a place to stay right near Pike Place Market. Four of us stayed comfortably there and we could walk around downtown instead of driving everywhere. It was nice to be able to park our car for the few days we were there and just explore Seattle! Simple place, but amazing location!"
931785,18402597,2014-08-26,16184517,Katie,"Jordan was very quick and prompt with all my questions and inquiries.  He was helpful letting me know what to expect and do since I was arriving to Seattle on a later flight after 10pm and how to check in.  It was super easy and everything was ready at the front desk for me without any hassles.  He was also very helpful with transportation tips to and from the airport to the rental property.  I was impressed by all his efforts to help our group of 6 girls visiting Seattle for the first time.  The location was excellent and we walked everywhere, from museums to Pike Place market and some of the girls even ran by the water and we were located close to restaurants, bars and even a little market for snacks and waters.  The location and Jordan's customer service cannot be beat!"
931785,20961726,2014-10-08,21262761,Yan,"Beautiful downtown apartment, close to everything as described, all walkable distance! "
931785,23319336,2014-11-29,18554326,Four00imer,"Easy check-in; even fairly late in the evening.  Just picked up the keys at concierge and walked right in.  
The apartment is pretty much as pictured.  The kitchen does have a few pots and pans if you need/want to cook something--but no spices, so bring those with you!  All the appliances were clean and worked perfectly.  One of the bedrooms has a large attached bathroom with a full tub.  The other room is separate from the second bath, and you have to walk past the master bedroom to get to the bath.  This didn't bother us; I mention it only because it isn't the most private 2-bedroom layout you've likely seen and if you're not comfortable with that you might want to look for one of the Alfreds properties that has a different layout.
The location can't be beat!  This is in Harbor Steps at University and First (the map on AirBnB wasn't plotting it correctly when I booked).  So, it is just a couple blocks to Pike's Market, the Target is only 3 blocks, and the Kress Supermarket is just one block further.  
The apartment is very comfortable, and I would stay here again.  The one thing to note is that the carpet in the entry way really needs a deep cleaning or needs to be replaced... so much so that I wasn't sure the place had been cleaned when we walked in... but the rest of the apartment was just fine and very clean.  So, if you stay here in the near future, don't be too alarmed when you walk in!  "
931785,26749357,2015-02-18,26420484,Adam,"This place really is close to everything!!! Just a short walk to Pike's Place Market, Benaroya Hall, and great restaurants and bars in Belltown. Jordan and the Stay Alfred team immediately responded to my inquiries. Check-in was very easy and convenient and there was a parking space in the building for our friends who drove up from Portland and stayed with us. The unit was clean and comfortable - nice king-sized bed in the master bedroom. My only minor criticism is that the unit wasn't exactly as pictured in the posting - our unit had a wall separating the kitchen and the dining/living room, but the basic idea of the apartment was pretty much the same as in the pictures. This place has a hotel feel to it as well, which may not be what you are looking for but was perfectly fine with us. Overall, it was a great stay and the location really can't be beat!"
931785,26946895,2015-02-22,1132167,Andrea,Love Love Love. Super easy to get to through metro. I also needed some questions answer which were promptly taken care of by the Stay Alfred team. The rooms were clean and comfortably fit 6 adults.
931785,29949343,2015-04-14,27712194,Patrick,"Great location! Middle of everything! Parking garage is awesome, especially for seattles street parking isn't free. Definitely will come back! "
931785,32167577,2015-05-15,29316006,Junko,"The lister was always prompt with communication. The apartment was fantastic and spacious. One of the driers was broken, though. We had to ask for the Wi-Fi password, it may have been nice to have the login on a piece of paper in the welcome envelope. The apartment reception staff were friendly, even though our check-in was at three they let us store our luggage and walk around while we had to wait. Overall, this is a superb listing, and was a great experience with a few tiny areas that could be improved."
931785,33224502,2015-05-26,25761297,B,"As advertised! Close to everything, great communication, easy to navigate and perfect for our family's first visit to the city. Family friendly, too. The kids had loads of fun riding the elevator! "
931785,33527495,2015-05-29,26489535,Sarah,"Beautiful, clean apartment. Perfect location. Wonderful home base for myself and my 4 family members exploring Seattle by foot. Would recommend to friends."
931785,42118229,2015-08-11,16426198,Denise,Great location. We had a very nice overall experience.  
931785,44446900,2015-08-26,14757467,James,Check in process was good. Apartment complex has lots of facilities - the pool and gym were great. The apartment itself was a great size for three adults. A bit on the dark side but we spent most of the time out and about. Location is great -you can exit straight onto Post Alley and walk up to Pikes Place or onto the main street opposite the Art Museum. Would recommend!
931785,45376095,2015-09-02,36129397,Emily,Unbelievable location and very easy access to parking. Apartment was clean and spacious and host was very attentive. Both beds were firm and comfortable and bathrooms and washer dryer unit were great and easy to use. 
931785,50779838,2015-10-14,27118870,Duo,房子就在第一大道上，就地理位置来说特别的有优势，离所有的好吃的地点步行距离都在20分钟左右，pike place market也就在附近。但是描述里面标写有三张床，但最后到达以后发现沙发根本拉不开无法睡人。
931785,51059780,2015-10-17,2065435,Robyn,"We had a wonderful stay at the Harbour Steps.  My mother and 18mo old daughter joined me in this suite. We had a fabulous corner suite with a view of the water and great wheel. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed for our stay. The furniture and beds were all very stylish as well as comfortable. It was a great location that was close to the piers, shopping, pike place and walking distance to other attractions. The self check in process was easy with very clear instructions. We would definitely stay here again. "
931785,52269877,2015-10-27,44803598,Cathy,we enjoyed our stay in the condo. the sound proof was good so our baby son who's a light sleeper could have a good sleep every night. The location was awesome. it's close to all the places we wanted to go and see. Jordan was helpful and easy to talk with.  Overall we really liked it and highly recommend it.
931785,53366778,2015-11-08,43898733,Carmen,"Great Location, Close to Pikes' Market. The accommodations were perfect, will definitely book again.

Thank you!

931785,53760306,2015-11-12,46511886,Daniel,"This place was awesome! So close to everything, walking distance to the Space Needle, Pikes Place, the ferry, bars and restaurants. Getting in and out was a breeze, this apartment was loaded with Washer and dryer, hair dryers and towels, the kitchen was loaded with plates, glasses and everything you need to cook. Also parking was a plus!!"
931785,54697520,2015-11-23,39761634,Antranik,Amazing amazing amazing location. In the heart of all the action.  So many things walking distance. Comfortable beds and great modern building.
931785,56622632,2015-12-15,23618233,Haier,The apartment is great. It is truly close to all places because it's in downtown area. Everything I the apartment is new and awesome. 
8418650,51167696,2015-10-18,44679236,Nicole,"We rented this duplex for my parents visiting from out of town:

My wife and I came to Seattle to visit our kids and the unique character of Washington along with the extended beauty of Canada. At the end of our little trip our kids arranged our last couple of nights at Susan Matthews newly renovated condo. upon arriving you couldn't really see from the front the amount of effort and cost of the many features and amenities that filled this custom duplex. Susan has just about thought of everything, even right down to the phone charger on the back of the alarm clock in the master bedroom. We were the first renters so it was nice to be in a freshly put together place. The large living room windows enjoyed a very spacious, private patio with conformable seating, nicely manicured landscape with a few squirrels going about their business. There was every comfortable feature incorporated into the bathroom with an outstanding shower that had a custom ventilation system that totally kept this room from fogging and misting the walls and mirror. The bathroom and all other rooms had it's own thermostat and heater which allowed for a very comfortable stay. We would come back if it was available and highly recommend it to anyone considering a visit to Seattle. 
"
8418650,51772818,2015-10-24,21733720,Saasha,Awesome location in quiet neighborhood.  Perfect layout for us and our 1yr old. Loved the outside space. Very clean. 
8418650,51941089,2015-10-25,45237443,Matthew,"We found the apartment to be bright, well appointed, and located in a quiet neighborhood with off-street parking.  Very comfortable with a nice backyard and well equipped kitchen (really appreciated there was coffee the first morning).  We were in town for a show and the location has easy, near-by, bus access to downtown Seattle.  Not having to drive into Seattle was a real plus for us.  We will be back."
8418650,52981614,2015-11-03,42302940,Cathy,"Susan provided a lovely 2-bedroom apartment/duplex -- very light and sunny living/kitchen area looking out on a private backyard.  Newly remodeled kitchen and bathroom.  She provided plenty of dishes and lines, as well as enough coffee and basics to keep you going until you can get to a store.  Also, for those with active inclinations, is a bike stand and weight bench.

The location is near Wallingford Ave -- which is close to UW, I-5, Gasworks Park, and just a lovely neighborhood all around.

A very comfortable, welcoming home.  I would return again, should the chance present itself!"
8418650,54110379,2015-11-16,32692793,Rachel,Susan's duplex was a wonderful place to stay for a weekend exploring in Seatte! It's an easy walk to either Wallingford or Fremont from the unit and an easy trip downtown. We found the unit to be very comfortable and appreciated Susan's welcome guide. Would definitely stay again. Thanks Susan!
8418650,54799380,2015-11-23,49185064,Shad,Susan was amazing!  We stayed in Fremont due to family in the area and you will quickly not that there really Aren't any hotels in Fremont AND they charge 50 bucks a day for parking!  Considering this was our very first Airbnb experience; Susan went out of her way to ensure a good experience.  The home is exactly as advertised and very comfortable.  Dedicated parking is nice and you are so close to many amazing Seattle landmarks (Fremont Troll).
8418650,55114047,2015-11-28,2266170,Mark,"Firstly, the description was as advertised.  We were here to celebrate Thanksgiving with our daughter and attend the Apple Cup.  The unit was clean, comfortable, and private in a very convenient neighborhood.  After battling traffic to get here, we walked to the game, and many neighborhood restaurants.  The unit was very nice with everything in the kitchen to cook a TG feast, which we did.  
Susan was very responsive and accommodating.  In short, we would definitely recommend to friends and family."
8418650,55811578,2015-12-06,14304184,Alan,"I had a great stay at Susan's place. Everything was as described in the listing or better.  I had no issues to bother Susan about but she checked in by text to ensure all was going well. Highly recommend.

Alan"
8418650,56205533,2015-12-10,6202372,Neil,My wife and I stayed at Susan's duplex during one of the heaviest rainstorms this Northwesterner has ever seen but the place was so comfortable and light that it was a pleasure being there. The furnishings were very comfortable especially the bed which made it even more relaxing to stay. We had our three adult children over every night to visit and it never felt crowded. We will definitely be back!
8418650,56374936,2015-12-13,46227914,Marc,"Great neighborhood, and well maintained unit.  Susan always responded promptly.  Would definitely stay here again."
8418650,57150516,2015-12-22,2874468,Amy,"Susan is very helpful and welcoming.  This is best stocked apartment we've ever rented, and we've rented many apartments in the US and Europe. The location is excellent. The neighborhood has many restaurants and shops, but the apartment is on a quiet street. Next time we're in Seattle we'll check this apartment first. "
8418650,57759536,2015-12-29,7703827,Chelsea,"The place was a pleasant surprise because it was even more open and comfortable than the photos depicted! The place was so cozy and welcoming! I rented this place for my family over the holidays, and we used it as the family holiday hub to gather. In other words, we spent a lot of time living in the space, using the kitchen, and hanging out. The place was PERFECT for our family holiday! Susan was also very quick to respond to our questions."
6218849,33695958,2015-05-31,23410463,Andreas,Had a great time for the past month. Really great place to live! Dan is very welcoming and helpful which makes the stay a lot nicer! The area is beautiful and easy to commute from. There is also a lot of different places to eat and buy groceries. Only a 10 minute walk from Greenlake and U-district.
6218849,45257968,2015-09-01,25613102,Stefan,"Dan was an excellent host.  He gave me tips to on what to do around seattle every weekend! The accommodations were great, and I had everything I needed.   "
6218849,55432426,2015-12-01,2245247,Sonja,Dan was a great host! He was very accommodating and responsive. He gave me tips on how to enjoy the city and recommended many free activities. The room I stayed in was very clean and comfortable and the roommates in the house were welcoming and inclusive. I would recommend this place to anyone! I stayed for a long time and have no complaints. Dan is a very nice guy!

Fantastic location, fantastic rental, fantastic hosts, fantastic trip thanks to Mark and Chris! This house was super clean and everything is brand new. Can't say enough good things about this place, everything was exceptional!! Thanks again guys!! 

If you got high standards and are looking for one of the best places to stay on the hill, look no further!! Seriously best airbnb rental you can find on Capitol Hill!!!!"
4841586,29638073,2015-04-10,15130805,Steve,Chris was a great host. The space was just remodeled and perfectly located in the vibrant community of capital hill. Highly recommended. 
4841586,30428250,2015-04-21,16174939,Amanda,"The place was a bit tricky to find, but it was clean and well situation in Cap Hill.  "
4841586,30842807,2015-04-27,10491534,Javaad,"Chris's home was perfect. The home is small but has all the amenities you need. Best thing is that it is walking distance to all of capitol hill. Would stay again! 
"
4841586,32666175,2015-05-19,33523260,Mark,This place was (website hidden) was very accommodating even on short notice. The house was clean and well put together. The location is also in a good part of cap hill and easily accessible. Highly recommend it! 
4841586,33144032,2015-05-25,32533493,Hayley,"Great location on the Hill (though a bit hard to find); great setup and space, wasn't expecting a freestanding home; having a parking space was also great; Owners were super responsive. All around great experience!!"
4841586,33961592,2015-06-02,22244626,Michael,"Overall our experience here was just OK. Chris was a fine host and was always very prompt in his communication. The house is stocked like a rental property. It is clear that this is not someone's actual home. Perhaps we missed a cabinet or something, but we were only able to find coffee mugs to use as water cups. The place is situated in the center of a block, next to a communal garden and playground. This place certainly offers a community feel, but we found it to be a bit noisey/unprivate. The house was immaculately clean, except for the used condom I found under the bed. Chris offered a discounted return visit, but I don't think we will be taking him up on it. 

I really wanted to like this place, but for $200/night we would have been better off in a hotel. Chris is was a great host, communicated quickly and said that we would make sure the cleaning crew checks under the beds from now on. "
4841586,34669790,2015-06-10,18873657,Alejandro,"Perfect location, very close to Capitol Hill venues and life. Cute small house in the back area of a alley block across from a communal garden, quiet area. Key pick up and drop off was simple. The space had everything we needed and was great for our short stay in Seattle. "
4841586,35090759,2015-06-15,31692847,Jason,"Everything was just as described.  Host was easy to work with and quick with communication.  House was clean and tidy.  Wish we'd read the listing better though to  know there wasn't internet, nor TV service.  Again, it was listed, we just assumed there would be.  So fair warning to anyone else looking ;).

Overall the house was in a great spot, easy walking distance to plenty of food (my favorite part of a new place!), but super noisy!  There were people (both adults and kids) yelling outside (felt like right outside the window since it's close quarters) until after 1 AM.  With no A/C, we had the windows open for the cooler night air so it was loud."
4841586,35522125,2015-06-19,35825037,Sean,"A nice clean, safe place to stay in a quiet Seattle neighborhood minutes from the downtown business district.  The owner was easy to work with and the rental transaction was seamless.  I was in a bind & could not find a hotel in Seattle (sold out) and checked out AirBnB on a lark.  It turns out that this rental is much more economical than a hotel stay for 2 people downtown.  Convenient and easy to get around the city. "
4841586,36288112,2015-06-27,21421156,James,"The location was perfect for us. We wanted a Capitol Hill location, close to nightlife, places to eat and of course good coffee; this really worked for us.
If you like to walk, this is also a great location in a friendly neighborhood. The property was clean, well appointed and exaclty as listed.
The only thing we would have enjoyed would have been internet connection, but we were mostly out and about, so didn't miss it too much.
We would certainly stay here again!"
4841586,36664922,2015-06-30,4539621,Maria,"This was a phenomenal location on Capitol Hill--far enough to feel like you're in a neighborhood, but very close (a couple blocks) to the liveliness of the hill. Chris was great-- very communicative and accommodating. The house itself is very small bit great for two couples. There's one bed upstairs in the loft (it doesn't have a door) and a very comfortable pull-out couch. "
4841586,37178971,2015-07-05,2005217,Ernie,"The place is just as described, a very unique space.  Looked new and clean.  The parking space is a little small for our suv, but manageable.  The neighborhood has a hipster vibe, and has many great varieties of restaurants within walking distance.  "
4841586,37936089,2015-07-11,19398554,Mike,"Excellent neighborhood, clean property, great walkability.   Great communications, the host got me in on a last minute request."
4841586,38384444,2015-07-15,8391755,Matt,The house was clean and check-in was seamless. Excellent stay!
4841586,39019261,2015-07-20,11879216,Lorraine,"Very good directions for how to access the house - in the middle of a block accessible from an alleyway. Also, good communication the day of for how to get the key. 

The house was very cute, very clean.  It was a very hot couple of days and the fans were perfect to make for a comfortable evening sleeping on both the lower and upper floors.   Comfortable fold out couch and bed!"
4841586,39798850,2015-07-26,35597605,Amelia,We had a great time staying at Chris's place. It was very clean and the location was great! 
4841586,39917866,2015-07-27,31674036,Jason,"Easy transaction for our stay. Great location for Capitol Hill neighbourhood. The place was very clean and comfortable.
"
4841586,41203002,2015-08-05,32622537,Cait,"This was the perfect little house on Capitol Hill for our needs. Small and tucked away out of the noise that can happen on Pike/Pine.
The house itself was clean and well taken care of, I would definitely rent it again in the future!"
4841586,41597648,2015-08-08,6857036,Victoria,The house is clean and the location is perfect for walking around Seattle. We kept our car parked in front (a tight squeeze for a big car).  Any questions we had about the place were answered quickly via email.  Thanks for the hospitality.
4841586,41760700,2015-08-09,21341975,Lee,The Small House on Capitol Hill is an amazing find.  It is well situated for dining and bar hopping all around the neighborhood.  The house is beautifully redone and very accommodating.  I only wish I had stayed more than one night so I could have used the kitchen and facilities more.   I will definitely visit again---This is my new home away from home in Seattle.  Mahalo!
4841586,41934014,2015-08-10,8998183,Anja,Very clean beautiful home in Seattle. Ideally for a weekend city trip.
4841586,42158006,2015-08-11,23215049,Caroline,"Filled service (the house was clean and the information supplied before the arrival) but the house is very noisy and our host did not show himself very worried about our well-being during the stay (it was impossible to reach him by phone when we tried to). We expected something else, given the night price. 
This shows us that some people use Airbnb only to do business and not to share their knowledge about a city. "
4841586,42388735,2015-08-13,6857036,Victoria,Still clean and convenient the second time around.  Thanks for a great spot for wandering around Seattle and the surrounding areas.
4841586,43138771,2015-08-17,40339261,Shaun,It is a great neighborhood some many great places to eat and drink. We had lots of fun exploring. WiFi would be a good thing to add for future guests. House was clean and well kept.
4841586,44171982,2015-08-24,39755329,Logan,"Awesome experience. The host provided timely responses to inquiries and on the day or arrival, provided very detailed and accurate instructions to get to the property and to gain entry. The house is nice and was described perfectly in the description. Very clean and well kept."
4841586,48901197,2015-09-29,6856887,Brandt,"We had a great time staying at the Small House on Capitol Hill! This spot is very cozy with plenty of space and top notch amenities. I love that it's very central to all the great food, entertainment and fun happening in the immediate surrounding area. Capitol Hill is one of the real hot spots in Seattle right now and I'd definitely recommend the Small House to anyone wanting to get a taste of this part of town. "
4841586,49957113,2015-10-07,2677623,Kevin,Clean and nice! Super easy.
4973204,27741020,2015-03-10,28479167,Kelly,"Best accommodations ever! This property delivered all it promised and more! Amazing location, QUIET neighborhood, but a short walk to trendy restaurants and the Space Needle. Our hosts thought of everything, the house was squeaky clean, beautifully decorated,  and very comfortable. Our host was always a quick text message away, he responded within 10 minutes to any of our inquiries, and checked in daily to see if we were comfortable or needed anything.  We're extremely happy with our accommodations in Seattle. "
4973204,27960421,2015-03-15,15620262,Diane,Ben we loved your place. It is beautiful so warm and comfortable felt like home.  Actually it was better than home since you can walk to restaurants and coffee shops so not possible where we live. The parking space was a bonus parking on Queen Anne can be tricky. 
4973204,28584399,2015-03-26,4951754,Todd,"What a great way to experience Seattle! I was traveling with my family of 5 (3 kids/2 adults) and we were very comfortable in Ben's apartment. The place is fabulous, exactly as depicted, very clean adn with plenty of old-world charm; the location is excellent, just a few short blocks from a great grocery store and walkable access (20-30 mins) to both the EMP and the Space Needle. "
4973204,28802237,2015-03-30,9541252,Bassam,"Ben was a great host. His place is extremely spacious and eloquently decorated. He was very responsive with any questions we had and was even nice enough to not charge for the 5th person we had! 

Access to the house is super easy and keyless, so don't worry about losing anything. Ben added an extensive guide that is extremely thought out. Aside from the home (fit 5 comfortably), the location is ideal. We never had to pay over 10$ for an uber from the house. There is also a delicious woodfire pizza place just down the street. Grocery stores, bars and many delicious food spots are also right down the street. 

If I ever go back to Seattle, this is the place I would love to stay at again. 

Thank you, Ben!"
4973204,29109230,2015-04-04,22810571,Sue,"14 Aloha is amazing! We would definitely try to book again when we are in Seattle.  The unit is located in a very lovely neighborhood close to the downtown area, a few mins. walk up to Kerry Park, our 1st destination on our 1st night in town.  Everything you need is there with a fully stocked kitchen i.e. cutlery, dishes, pans, paper products, laundry detergent, bath toiletries etc..  Ben definitely goes above and beyond to make sure that you are well looked after.  Better than a five star hotel, because you have all the comforts of home.  Our daughter said that the murphy bed was very comfortable as well.  The unit has a keyless entry and looks like Better Homes and Gardens inside. Everything exceeded our expectations.  We also appreciated a place to park our rental car. It was a very busy trip for us hunting for a future residence for our daughter, along with visiting friends and some sightseeing, but coming back to 14 Aloha every night relaxed and refreshed us for the next day.  Thank you Ben for creating such a wonderful environment for visitors and for being such a wonderful host! We had a lovely place to stay and as a side bonus we made new friends, Ben and Misia!"
4973204,29341475,2015-04-06,8013690,Julie,"Ben's house is a lovely house, perfect for 5 people and very clean. The kitchen is fully stocked. We also enjoyed the neighborhood very quiet and with bars at walking distance. We would definitely come back for my  next trip to Seattle."
4973204,29634914,2015-04-10,25711887,Kristen,"Ben's house was perfect for our family trip. We felt right at home. The house is located in a perfect spot in the city. We were close to everything we wanted to see and do. 
Ben provided a binder with information about the house which was helpful. We had plenty of towels, dishes, etc. The beds were very cozy. It feels like a 2 bedroom house with the pull down bed(which is very comfortable). We highly recommend this house."
4973204,29890299,2015-04-13,29354535,Grace,"Ben's Queen Anne home was even more beautiful than the photos! He considered every detail in supplying the home with all things a family could wish for! We had a wonderful time there and the location is perfect - an easy walk or UBER anywhere. Ben was very friendly and welcoming yet gave us privacy - he even recommended some good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. I hope we can stay here every time we come to Seattle! We give Ben a perfect ""10"" and are so thankful for his house!"
4973204,30330877,2015-04-20,11524379,Joseph,"Ben’s hospitality was matched only the convenience and charm of the home itself. This was a wonderful spot with a perfect location. As my wife and I visit Seattle quite often, we look forward to hopefully staying again. And for longer!"
4973204,30907588,2015-04-28,31664702,Mandy,"This house was so clean!  The neighborhood is beautiful, the location perfect, and the house was excellent.  We have no complaints...we enjoyed the weekend so much we didn't want to leave!  "
4973204,31335319,2015-05-04,5098261,Arleen,My family stayed here over the weekend and they loved it.  I did a walk through before they arrived and the place was spotless.  It was a very charming place and I highly recommend staying here.  I also want to thank Ben for going above and beyond.  I had asked about the cot and he set it up and took photos the same day so I could see how it would look.  
4973204,32015636,2015-05-12,26653135,Ryan,"Ben's place was absolutely great!  It was above and beyond any of our expectations.  A perfect retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city, but still just a short walk down the block to a great neighborhood full of cafes, restaurants, shops and markets. Also, only a couple more blocks to the Space Needle and easy transportation into the heart of the city.  On top of all this the house was spotless and perfectly appointed with top notch appliances and linens.  Ben's place was the perfect, comfortable, home for our family to explore Seattle. We would not hesitate to stay there again if we make it back up to Seattle!        "
4973204,32548890,2015-05-19,20532640,Alex,"Our stay was fantastic! I came up to Seattle from Portland to shop for wedding dresses and what a weekend it was. The place was so clean and felt like home. We had a blast walking to all of the restaurants and bars nearby. There's also a great market within walking distance that we went to a couple of times. Easy to get downtown too. Overall a great stay, highly recommend!!!"
4973204,33331367,2015-05-26,5018858,Jessica,"I highly recommend this accommodation. There were so many things that were perfect about this place for us. We came up to Seattle to go to the Folklife festival, and this home is perfectly located in short walking distance to the Seattle Center. We also took the monorail downtown, went up the Space Needle, and went to the Chihuly museum. There are also coffee shops grocery stores, etc., even closer than the Seattle Center. All within walking distance. We parked the car in the driveway when we arrived, and did not need it until we left.
The home itself is impeccable. It is a 
 1920s duplex, completely restored, partly in original with some of the perfect modern touches. Spotlessly clean and with everything a guest could need. Just having sharp cooking knives is enough for me, but having everything else we needed in the kitchen made our stay perfect. When we ran into the hosts they were friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend this home, you can't go wrong.  "
4973204,34145066,2015-06-05,25398807,Yingfei,"The Guest House is perfect! This is my first experience of Airbnb, my expectation was high, however, not high enough. Ben is kind and nice. I would strongly recommend any family who want to spend some time in Seattle to consider Ben's guest house. It is clean and beautiful! Even better than the photos. It also has a lovely small garden with beautiful flowers, my mom loves it. "
4973204,36091002,2015-06-25,30917363,Arlitia,"Our stay on Queen Anne was marvelous! The apartment is beautiful and well appointed, very clean and allowed us absolute privacy. More than that, it's also very cozy, a pleasant place just to spend time in if you're in between events on your trip. Full of charm! It's close shops and restaurants and theatre and the neighborhood is very nice. We took lots of pleasant evening walks. Our host was immediately attentive and helpful and very friendly but also was very conscientious in allowing our privacy so we could come and go as we pleased. I would definitely go back! "
4973204,36343605,2015-06-27,4184014,Laurent,"The house was just perfect. Great amenities in the apartment. Very well prepared and convenient. Extremely clean. Very well located. 
It was a short stay but a great one. I would love to come back!"
4973204,36671201,2015-06-30,6210344,Lauren,"We had such a wonderful stay at Ben's place in Lower Queen Anne's. Everything from the decor to the plush towels, we felt like we were staying in a boutique hotel but with plenty of space. Location can't be beat and Ben was also a great host. We'd stay there again in a heartbeat."
4973204,37079230,2015-07-04,3798922,Franck,"Ben was a really great host. First, I have to say that the house is bigger than what the picture suggest. We were 3 adults and we had plenty of room. The bedroom are big enough, with closets and room to store your clothes.

We went during a very hot week (it was around 100 degree while we were there) and the washing machine / dryer came very handy!

The house is very well located, not far from groceries store, restaurants, coffees, etc. There's a few buses close by, you can walk from here to the space needle, downtown (about 40mn), and so on.

Next time I visit Seattle I'd definitely try to stay here again.

Thank you, Ben!"
4973204,37325822,2015-07-06,4873966,Victoria,"Ben's home was impeccably clean and charming! Every detail In his home was appointed with his guests' best interests in mind. Ben was also very accommodating and he was very communicative with us the entire time. He was even so kind as to go the extra mile, bringing us games from his home that he thought our eight year old would enjoy. We really enjoyed having a parking space as parking is certainly very hard to come by in Seattle! We were able to take a quick drive to practically any attraction we were interested in, and delicious restaurant options were in walking distance. We are so grateful for Ben's hospitality and look forward to staying there again next time we are in Seattle!"
4973204,38767836,2015-07-18,14629363,Mark,We loved this location and the host was fantastic!  Right in the heart of Queen Anne we were able to access a lot of really great restaurants and shopping.  The house was immaculate and all of the amenities were well organized.  Full kitchen and set-up to host a dinner before taking an Uber 5-10 minutes anywhere in the city.  Great central location.  Additionally Ben was a great host and set us up anytime I had an inquiry and was always within a message away.  Really enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Cheers!
4973204,39553915,2015-07-24,38403743,Michael,"Everything was great. Ben was easily accessible with any questions we had. 
The home was tastefully decorated and all was tidy and in tip- top shape. The proximity to the city and attractions was a plus--much was within walking distance!
We felt very comfortable and would recommend this accommodation for anyone looking for a nice place to stay while in Seattle."
4973204,41926392,2015-08-10,30379810,Marc,"As a group of 5 using airbnb for the first time, this was a great house and exceeded our expectations. Everything was clean and well organized and had all the amenities you could want. It's a 3-5 minute walk to the Seattle Center and there is one of the best marketplaces/grocery stores I have ever been too right down the street and TONS of  great restaurants/bars nearby. Ben makes himself easily available to contact if you need any help or have any questions. We saw him once during our trip and he was very friendly and laid back. I would highly recommend staying at this location if you are planning a trip to Seattle. Ben is everything you could ever ask for in a host and his house is great!"
4973204,42737964,2015-08-15,3588955,Victor,"Our experience with Ben and his place was fantastic.  He was very easygoing and accessible during the check-in process.  We arrived early and he met us to take our luggage into storage even though the house was still being cleaned.  When we returned to the house later, he had moved our luggage into the unit for us!

The place itself is wonderfully comfortable, nicely decorated, with all the hospitality touches.  The location is premium with only a short walk to Seattle Center where we toured the Space Needle, EMP Museum and more.  From there, a short monorail ride gets you down near Pikes Market.

We had a wonderful visit and appreciate the hospitality and comfortable arrangements very much.  Thank you!"
4973204,43677269,2015-08-21,19991877,Eugene,"We had an excellent experience at this apartment. Everything was completely ready for our stay. The apartment was very clean. We felt right at home. Ben is a very nice person and a welcoming host. The location is also great and is close to the center of Seattle. We strongly recommend this apartment.
"
4973204,45264745,2015-09-01,23839675,Pooja,We loved the place- parking and the location was awesome. It was a perfect set up for our family of 4 and one night we even had 2 extra guests and which was easily accommodated. Ben and his family were the perfect hosts and what we loved is left plenty of toys and books for my girls to play with. We even got to hang out the Ben's daughter a couple of times for impromptu play dates. The house is very thoughtfully furnished and put together right down to the single packs for the dishwasher and washing machine. I would totally go back if we visit Seattle next year.
4973204,46726920,2015-09-13,27601174,Bill,Great neighborhood within a good walking distance to everything downtown!  The home was beautiful and clean.  
573942,2048835,2012-08-20,923712,Danny,"Angielena was a most courteous and helpful hostess.  The atmosphere of the building was totally interesting.and I would recommend this to anyone. The residents are artists and each one I met was a pleasure.    The neighbornood is in an old part of Seattle that has been renovated and filled with shops, restaurants, and bars- all inviting and fun.    I do not have anything on the negative side to add, as I have been in rooms all around the country and this is right at the top.                 "
573942,2184268,2012-09-03,3260746,Robyn,"Angielena is such a sweet lady... She was very accommodating and checked in on us regularly to be sure we were making out OK.  The location of this building was ideal for us as we were attending MLB and NFL games and it is literally less then 5 minutes away.

The inside of this building is undergoing revitalization that we weren't really aware of, so it was dusty and the room had a slight musty smell.  I think once the inside is finished, this building will be a gem.  Our room was very small and was not the room in the photo/booking, but  we were comfortable nonetheless..

The bathroom in this building was a pleasant surprise just as the photo shows. The shower is beautifully done and is all tile with numerous shower heads and glass walls.  It was hard to monitor your bathroom time because you won't want to leave.

All in all we had a pleasant stay with Angielena and we thank her for her accommodations."
573942,2291453,2012-09-14,1757815,Justin,Great place and very hospitalize. I love this neighborhood and the history there. 
573942,2402986,2012-09-24,695274,May,"Our stay with Angielena was great. When I booked our room, the room  that I had initially wanted was already booked. Angielena upgraded us to the Madame Goldie room (no extra cost). This is truly the artist living experience. The rooms are in a artist space with lots of art work to check out explore. There is a small kitchen that should be suffice for your basic cooking needs. The bathroom really is the highlight of the accommodation. Brilliant. 

If you are looking to be off the beaten path but still very close to the inner parts of Seattle, Georgetown is a really cool place to stay and check out. There some really interesting galleries, record stores, eateries and a local brewer to check out. 

The pro and con of this stay -  this is an smallish neighborhood with one really fabulous street. So that means all the pubs and excitement are really close as well. If you are looking for a quite place with crickets and a hooting owl for your R&R, this might not be the place for you.   

Overall, I had a great time and would stay here again. "
573942,3345549,2013-01-14,4242263,James,"George Town is by far the coolest spot in Seattle. The bohemian grassroots DIY vibe of imaginative and dutiful restoration is perfectly complimented by the creative artistic style and flair of the residents and entrepreneurs. On top of the list would be Angielena and her grand vision of what George Town can be. She's off to an even better start than when I last saw her with the George Town Arts and Cultural Center and the wonderful rooms she has to offer~! While in the area I was lucky enough to attend the local George Town Art Walk where I met many talented artists and saw hundreds of great pieces. Some by Angielena as well!
The room is comfortable and cozy and the location is perfect!  A great place for a wandering soul to lay down and explore Seattle to it's fullest. 
Thanks again Angielena for such a lovely stay!"
573942,5219556,2013-06-18,6779677,Hilary,"Angielena was a very accommodating host! She was responsive, attentive to our needs, and made sure we knew all the neighborhood had to offer. A great place to stay if you want to be right outside the city, but in a place that has a flavor of its own. "
573942,5766742,2013-07-15,188397,Jody,"Georgetown is great!! We came down for the Subpop Festival and had the pleasure of enjoying the neighbourhood the Friday night before all the festivities kicked off. Some really fun and CHILL places to go. Have spent quite a bit of time in Queen Anne/Ballard/Fremont/Capital Hill areas -  Georgetown is now, by far, my favourite. My bf even went back a few days later to pick up a guitar from the local music shop he couldn't stop thinking about!

Angielena was a great host. The building was really cool and our room was clean and comfortable. We really enjoyed ourselves and would definitely stay there again. :)"
573942,5853968,2013-07-19,4498057,Audrey,"Overall, Georgetown is a great area, very easy to get downtown. Its a 20 minute easy flat bike ride.  The bus is also available and convenient.  Its a twenty minute bike ride up to Beacon Hill or over to Columbia City is 30.  The local bars offer a good array of really good food and drinks. I would recommend staying here. Its a beautiful building, its very clean. The shower is RIDICULOUS and the ambiance is professional. I was able to store my bike safely and walked around totally comfortably in the evenings. Its delicious. 

That said, if you're looking for a bed and breakfast this is more of a bed. Its a remodeled hotel, so you're not in someone's home. If you're looking to get to know the host or to chat with people when you get home at night, this isn't for you. Generally in the evenings there isn't anyone around and it wouldn't be uncommon to literally not see anyone and if you need something it can feel a little like you're imposing to ask (because you have to call or email, rather than poke your head out). It can be a little isolating. Its also in an airspace, which makes it cool - the Boeing field is awesome, but you can hear the people in the room next to you...and you can hear the planes. So if you don't sleep heavy, just be advised. 

I would do it again. i was there for work for a couple weeks, so I didn't necessarily want to chat but if I was there for a shorter time, perhaps I would have. Just an adviso for personality type!

"
573942,6053474,2013-07-28,7250729,Ben,"Angeliena made us feel very well at the studio.  We checked in early from our vancouver trip and she allowed us to see the room while it was being flipped and kept our luggage in storage so we could go see the city.  When we came back the room was put together so nice!   The 106 or 124 bus will take you directly into town (century link field, safeco, pioneer square) within 10-15 minutes.  The location is a great and upcoming art mecca for Seattle.   Also the guest bathroom shower is to die for!  It is so beautiful and has many shower heads on the walls.  "
573942,6119886,2013-07-30,7411558,Debbie,"I loved the people of Georgetown.  Had such a fun trip.  Angielena was very accommodating.  Everything was conveniently located.  My room was clean and the other ""tenants' were pleasant.  For a simple, uncomplicated accommodation, it was very nice.  Couldn't ask for a better stay for the price. 
Thank you for having me.   "
573942,6401570,2013-08-11,7531872,Madeleine,"Our stay with Angelina was great, and I would definitely stay there again. She is very friendly, accommodating, and helpful. 

The building is in a great location, right above a nice little pub and a soon-to-be-opening coffee shop, with the Georgetown Trailer Park Mall in the back parking lot, as well as being very close to the I-5 freeway. 

Just down the street within a 5-minute walk are numerous bars/pubs, a diner, coffee shops, and cafes. If you stay, I would highly recommend walking down to the Hangar Cafe and getting breakfast/lunch -- they do a bunch of delicious sandwiches and savory or sweet crepes. 

The building was very nice and clean, though it definitely can trap the heat during the summer, but AC units in the rooms take care of it, and I can't imagine that being much of an issue the majority of the year.

The only reason I didn't give five stars is because of a few minor things:

--- The blackout curtains mentioned weren't present in our room,
     and it got very bright in there at night, as our window was
     facing a hallway which had a light on 24-hours. 

--- The bed was fine, although it might be too small for taller folks
    (my boyfriend is 6' tall and his feet were pushed up against the 
    bed frame when he lay down), and it was very, very firm. People 
    with back pain might have a hard time. 

--- The breakfast provided was more of just coffee and a french 
    press (which we had to look up how to use since we've never
    owned one), tea, yogurt, and some bagels. 

--- We couldn't reliably connect to the wifi from our room; 
    my phone would connect every once in a while for a few 
    minutes, but my boyfriend's phone and our laptop weren't ever 
    able to connect unless we went out into the hallway across 
    from the room. 

Any other issues we had were resolved quickly and professionally."
573942,6518257,2013-08-15,2198288,Lily,"I would highly recommend staying in this lovely Georgetown room.  The building is located in the center of Georgetown on a street with great restaurants, bakeries, shops and bars.  Georgetown is a great area that most visitors don't think to explore.  "
573942,6571471,2013-08-17,7268334,Laura + Emanuel,"Angielena's place is awesome. Great mix of artist studios and guest rooms with a really creative vibe to it. It's located in Georgetown, a very cool neighborhood with a lot of nice restaurants, bars and shops just around the corner and a short bus ride (about 20 mins.) away from downtown. Angielena was a lovely host, she had great recommendations and suggestions for us. We would definitely stay there again (And, yes, the shower is insanely awesome.)."
573942,6646226,2013-08-19,435281,Sean,"Angielena provided us with a wonderful environment for our stay in lovely Georgetown, Seattle.  A fun and hip neighborhood to boot!"
573942,6717855,2013-08-22,6288649,Rhiannon,"This is the perfect place for art-lovers, free spirits and those looking to stay in a non-touristy part of town.  Georgetown, I was told, is an up and coming district and it has its own unique flavor and microcosm of businesses to explore over and above the usual spots in Seattle. I found it a wonderful home base to come back to every night and easily developed favorites among the coffee shops and bars.  

The Vintage Room was funky, clean & comfy.  It's spare, but it's got everything I needed - including a beautiful lowboy, and the shared kitchen and amazing bathroom bested any hostel I've stayed at.  The balcony out back, though, is the cherry on top of this place.  If I hadn't wanted to explore so much, I would've spent even more hours enjoying it and the unique trailer park park mall that's open on the weekends in the parking lot below it.  The vintage furniture and billowing fabric blowing in the breeze are a bit magical.

Angielena is a wonderful hostess and clearly takes pride in what she's created.  The whole building is full of artist studios, which she went out of her way to tour with me.  She was always available to answer questions & had a lovely, open personality I felt very comfortable engaging with.  (This was my first airbnb experience, so that was a bonus or me!).  When I get back to Seattle next, I'll hit this place up for a bed first!  "
573942,6769329,2013-08-24,7460965,Lisa,"Angielena is the perfect host with several great funky rooms in an artists' coop. Lots of simple, creative touches in the rooms and all around the entire building. It's eclectic, low key and really a pleasure to be part of Angielena's entrepreneurial vision in Georgetown's renaissance. Wishing you much success!"
573942,7043501,2013-09-04,6694736,Stephen,"I really enjoyed my stay at Angielena's place. She was friendly, easy to contact and gave me some great tips for places to visit in Georgetown. The room was comfortable, good value for money and the shower was incredible! I would definitely stay with Angielena if I return to Seattle in the future. "
573942,7265750,2013-09-13,8612775,Desi,"The vintage room in Georgetown, Seattle was perfect for my short and sweet stay in my favorite city. The space is clean, quaint, romantic, artful, and quiet. The host of the space is kind and resourceful, and she is attentive to the small details that create the sense that her guests are not only welcome, but appreciated. I would, and likely will, stay here again, and I'd recommend it to friends and family. Two thumbs up and five stars!"
573942,7589022,2013-09-25,8553181,Rae,"This space is fantastic! Personally, I don't like staying in a room in someone's home- it's weird and I don't always feel like seeing someone else when I get home. The Georgetown b&b is perfect- you can be social if you want to, or come home late from work (or the bars) without walking through your hosts' living room Netflix session. I'm a business traveler- but a cool one!- and this place offers everything I need to work, go out, and chill. I'll be back!"
573942,8005094,2013-10-12,8946564,Xanath,"I highly enjoyed my stay with Angielena! The building is artsy and rustic (matching the town), the room is absolutely gorgeous it fits the pictures to a T. It's clean, quiet-of course there is the outside murmur but it's really not so noticeable when you're inside. There is soft lighting throughout the building, it's a great place to excite thoughts, relax-especially on the back patio. Anyone I ran into that either worked or stayed in the building was very friendly and polite-nice to chat with. You're left to your space, free range to cook in the kitchen, come and go as you please without feeling like you're interrupting anyone's moment or activity. Angielena left a wealth of info to travel around the city with, she's very supportive and attentive.  I would go back for sure"
573942,8064513,2013-10-14,9209053,Justin,"Our stay was amazing. The host was incredibly friendly and welcoming, the room was cozy and we are at a loss for words for the ""Barry White"" bathroom.
The Georgetown area is fun and lively, and access to downtown by bus is directly across the street.
Overall, we are incredibly happy!"
573942,8240030,2013-10-21,7891647,Sally,"We loved staying at Angielena's Vintage Room in Georgetown! The room was cozy, warm, and in a cool arty building in a fantastic part of town with excellent bars and restaurants. The bathroom with the crazy showerheads was to die for. Angielena was a perfect host - once we had trouble with wifi and texted her and she magically appeared at our door in about 3 minutes fully dressed in costume. Probably the highlight of our stay! Loved Georgetown, loved Angielena, loved the stay. Would definitely stay with her again! Thank you! "
573942,8933206,2013-11-26,9741965,Dave,"I stayed during a business trip and the room, building, and experience was exactly as described. I would stay here again if I'm back in Seattle on another short term trip."
573942,9817924,2014-01-12,3318921,Lillian,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay here! The building is extremely charming, including a clean kitchen (with an wonderful tea selection), a balcony with a view, and a practically royal shower. We felt quite safe and enjoyed reliable communication with Angielena. In my experience, the building has a good balance of privacy and quiet, and occasional art events that provide a sense of life and energy. There are plenty of coffee shops and diners nearby and the buses to downtown depart from right outside the door. Whether you're there for a few days or a few weeks (as we were), this bnb is highly  recommended!"
573942,10187980,2014-02-04,11762553,Ryan,Great time and a great price. Host is very responsive and all your basic hotel type amenities are provided. I recommend it. 
573942,10471627,2014-02-20,2400554,Nick,"I absolutely loved my stay at Angielena's art residence! It was comfortable and cozy, the Barry White bathroom was beyond compare, the back deck was great for chilling out and the artists I met during my stay there were all really cool. Definitely one of the most interesting places I've ever stayed & I would come back in a heartbeat... "
573942,10578668,2014-02-25,12228225,Ray,I had a great stay in the vintage room. My awesome host Angielena was very kind and accommodating. This historic building is filled with art and artists and has such a unique charm. I highly recommend Angielena and the b&b. I'll be back.    
573942,10973098,2014-03-15,9483259,Dee,"What a unique Air BnB experience! To be completely honest, I booked for the 9 headed Mexican tile shower (completely met my expectations!) and didn't even realize I was staying inside such a cool multiuse building in the art district!!! I was only there for 2 nights on business and was completely bummed that I couldn't explore the area :/ parking is great, bed was comfortable and clean, kitchen accessories included a French press (my fav!), and it was quiet despite being in top of a bar ;) it is certainly the most eclectic place I have stayed... Angielena was so kind and helpful!"
573942,11075032,2014-03-19,11969132,Dan,"We were thrilled to stay with you. So many wonderful experiences. I can still recall all the beautiful artwork. The place was so quiet, and we so enjoyed our room. We'll definitely be coming back soon. Best regards always.  Dan & Julia
"
573942,11413704,2014-04-01,13141762,Steven,"To be honest, I didn't read the description when booking so I was a bit surprised to find myself in an art center. However, it did turn out to be a quiet and relaxing place. The room had vintage decor and furniture but the bed seemed to be brand new - very good sleep! The shower is impressive and, seriously, a bit excessive - you'll see. All-together, a nice place for a few night's stay but for longer term, there are some things to consider (I stayed there for over two weeks). I wish the wi-fi was more reliable and the kitchen is rather small, there's an electric stove which I planned on using but eventually did not. With that said, I'm glad I didn't go and stay in some guy's living room on a couch for the same amount of money. Really. 
Btw, 15 min bus ride to downtown, and there are a few bars/cafes just down the block. That's pretty convenient if you ask me."
573942,11800173,2014-04-15,942004,Lily,"If you're in the Georgetown area, and you're looking for a killer place to stay, please consider one of two of Angielena's places!  They are super cute, comfortable, and are in a GREAT location.  We walked all over Georgetown and instead of having to hail an Uber or a cab back to Capitol Hill or Queen Anne, we just walked right over to the Star Brass Lounge, grabbed a drink, then walked up the stairs to our little abode.  Might I add there's an 8 head shower as well.  I'll let your imagination run wild with that one.
Seriously, stay here.  IT'S AMAZEBALLS."
573942,13120183,2014-05-19,8086228,David,"Wonderful stay
In every way 
Nothing more to say. 

David "
573942,13260276,2014-05-23,15419661,Mariana,"If you do not mind staying a little further away from downtown then this place is ideal. The bus stop is literally at the door and in 15 minutes you're already in downtown. 
The room is very warm and the renovated bathroom a must see! 
Angelina is super friendly and helpful. She prepared a selection of guides and maps for her guests, so sweet. 
The days I spent there were super sunny and maybe that's why I did not meet many artists. How Angelina said, everybody was outside! "
573942,13428247,2014-05-27,3921550,Arancha,"It has been a great experience staying at Angielena's place! Not only you are surrounded by art and artists, but the whole neighborhood, Georgetown, has been an amazing discovery thanks to our host reccommendations: the crepes at the Hangar Cafe, the beer at the Machine Brewery, ... And everything at a short bus ride of Downtown, having the bus stop just at your door. I would definetely stay there again. Thank you, Angielena!"
573942,15040600,2014-07-01,5727365,Ellen,"Angielena is a very good host, she is considerate and always be there to help. My son has a good time living there."
573942,16330012,2014-07-25,11490679,Saskia,"We've had a wonderful stay at Angielena's Bella Vitale in Georgetown! Angielena was a great host and recommended the hair salon Spectrum house downstairs where we both got a very cool haircut and color. Georgetown is a beautiful, creative and friendly and historic neighborhood with good cafes, restaurants, nice shops and bars. We wish we could stay longer and if we return to Seattle we would be very happy to stay there again!"
573942,16588646,2014-07-29,1648509,Amanda,"We had a great time staying with Angielena! The room's bed was a bit smaller than we expected (full bed, not queen), but it was comfortable.  The air conditioner was also very helpful to have in the room because the building keeps the heat in very well and we were there during some very warm days.  

Angielena is a great host and very generous.  It was my first time booking with airbnb and I had a lot of confidence in the security of the building and my host.  She has a beautiful soul!

Although there are other guest rooms in the building, we never had to wait for a shower or a bathroom to be free.  Also, the house is very conveniently located to buses downtown and it's located next to Ellenos greek yogurt (which was my favorite treat during our stay).  We never ended up using the kitchen but it seemed to provide everything one would need."
573942,16860438,2014-08-03,17939304,Rorie,"Angielena was a great host. She was accommodating with our travel delays coming from the islands (plan early for ferry delays).  The room was small and comfortable, and in a fun artsy building close to a tasty mexican restaurant and coffee shops. The rain shower bathroom was amazing, and definitely a pleasure after a long day."
573942,17059056,2014-08-06,16041812,Daniel,Angielena offers up a unique and comforting experience at this airbnb.  I was impressed not only by the shower but the whole feel of the building.  Everything is explained very well and there were no issues staying here.  The room had great air conditioning and enough space for two people to sleep in.  Thank you again!
573942,17222715,2014-08-09,4509037,Garrett,Angeielena treated us quite well and we appreciated a nice stay in Seattle.
573942,17838944,2014-08-18,12932638,Joyce,"I have a great time staying here. The room is small, but very comfortable, with period furniture consistent with the vintage of the building, which is an interesting piece in itself. Quietest art studio building I've ever been in, it was shockingly easy to sleep here. There was live music downstairs on Saturday, but it didn't run super late, and there was no rowdiness during my stay. The neighborhood is busy and fun all the time, with loads of great places to eat, and drink. I was able to go downtown on public transit and by car very easily, so I got to see the things I came to see, and experience Georgetown, instead of a gloomy hotel in a commercial district, which was perfect. The shared bathroom was actually pretty nice, not at all squicky like shared johns I've dealt with in the past, so I was glad I didn't let that deter me from staying here. Angielena was an attentive, detail oriented host, with very well dressed dogs, and it was great meeting her. Soon this place will be the Madonna Inn of the Northwest, I'm sure."
573942,18591174,2014-08-28,8582456,Shalyn,"What an excellent trip!! I was traveling alone, and I got lost (driving down from the great white north). Angielena checked on me, waited for me and was completely amazing!!  The room was excellent, homey and so welcoming as was the building. This area was so perfect and I wish I could have stayed another 4 days. Angielena explained everything so well  gave some great tips on where to get coffee, food and just made me feel totally at home.  The coffee shop close by Two Tartes had the best raspberry scone, and great coffee. The bar downstairs has a great burger and the Mexican restaurant was definitely a must. Am going to highly recommend this stay...oh yes, the bathroom is delightful! Thanks!"
573942,18947247,2014-09-03,18510162,Joyce,"Angielena was an awesome host! She is very accommodating. She took us in and gave us the tour of the place earlier than we were supposed to check-in. I love the rustic feel of the building. The shower room was amazing! If you're driving, there's a big parking lot and Georgetown is a short drive to downtown which is very convenient. The neighborhood has a lot of restaurants, bars & food joints to choose from nearby even walking distance. This was our first trip to Seattle and a successful, fun trip at that, big thanks to our wonderful accommodations! We're very satisfied! "
573942,19658408,2014-09-15,21168390,Hallie,"Our experience here was very calm and accommodating. Angielena met us when we arrived and gave us a complete tour of the space. This building is full of character and very comfortable, a nice change of pace from downtown. The neighborhood has plenty of delicious and friendly places to eat and drink if you don't want to venture too far. We did this trip using car2go which was always close to the residence and allowed for quick trips into downtown/Capitol Hill/etc. I highly recommend taking advantage of the Barry White shower, especially the waterfall shower head. We had a wonderful time in Seattle, and Angielena's space and Georgetown were definitely highlights to our trip. "
573942,20115509,2014-09-23,21153423,Michelle,"My host Angielena was incredibly welcoming and very amenable to my arrival schedule.I immediately felt like I have made a friend and I am excited for her to visit my hometown.She gave me maps and guides for all the different Seattle neighborhoods and also, most interesting to me, a history of the building and the area of Georgetown/(email hidden)is neighborhood was fascinating to (website hidden) is the oldest neighborhood in Seattle and it was exciting to still feel that frontier energy.Artists,musicians,creative people and working class make up this neighborhood. As an artist,I felt right at home and met many people at the various restaurants and (website hidden) is a very friendly area.The building itself was a former rooming house and brothel, so the layout is perfect for Airbnb guests.The bathrooms were numerous and all the plumbing was updated and able to handle the building's multiple (website hidden) was very clean and I appreciated the addition of soaps and shampoos and other free -for everyone to use -products,since I had managed to forget a few items.The bathrobe was a lovely touch.The room was quiet, clean and the bed incredibly comfortable.Other lovely perks, the back balcony with the outdoor curtains and tables and chairs was the perfect place to watch the sun go down.The bar below was super friendly and the noise did not affect my room.The bus line downtown is directly across the street.Everything was convenient.I will stay here again and again!

573942,20937961,2014-10-07,1214767,Ornella & Berni,"First I have to say a big thank you to Angielena! She's been amazing and helped us on all fronts when we needed some help and gave us all the information we could have asked for! Big up! Her rooms are also lovely, very special surrounding with the art studios! The shared balcony was a great place to sit in the sun and relax or enjoy the view on the probably hippest spot in town! There are direct busses to downtown and capital hill leaving pretty much at the front door! But Georgtown is so cool, who wants to leave it anyway!? Thanks again to Angielena and her artists for having us! We'll be back!"
573942,21327585,2014-10-14,17402083,Mathilde,"La chambre d'Angielena est parfaite, Georgetown est un quartier très sympa, agréable a vivre et atypique !!
Rien a redire, notre séjour fut très agréable et l'accueil très chaleureux !! "
573942,25215403,2015-01-09,18306509,Sungkyun,"It was a quite interesting stay since the building has a unique structure and are full of artists. Although it has many rooms like 20, the place was very quiet all day. Airplanes might be a bit of disturbance to a light sleeper during the night, but in general it's a very nice place to stay. People were gentle and respect one another. The shared kitchen was right next to my room and easily accessed, and the newly renovated bathroom was a state of art. The very pretty host, Angielena was welcoming and gave a lot of details about the area and tips around there in a warm and kind manner. I really appreciate it. Thank you! "
573942,25642096,2015-01-21,21107817,Travis,"Angielena was very accommodating. The room was clean, and the bed was comfortable."
573942,25815325,2015-01-26,26062401,Aaron,The listing description was accurate.  It was a beautiful space in a great neighborhood and was perfect for our needs.  Angielina was super friendly and helpful.
573942,27218627,2015-02-28,26687291,Bronwyn,"This room, this building, and all the people inside, were fantastic. It fit all my needs. It was close to where I was taking a workshop in georgetown, close to public transit, full of character and art, and I got to talk to so many lovely creative people. Angielena is an incredibly accommodating host.  

I spent a good portion of my time on the lovely balcony, watching the planes (and some georgetown drama unfold). The rest of the time I spend enjoying the neighbourhood. It is a little rough around the edges, but has a lot of charm and very good people. 
If I go back to Seattle, I will stay here for sure."
573942,27396313,2015-03-03,26863880,Jason,what a great neighborhood and such a cool building!  So many great places to eat and drink within walking distance.  Or have an early morning cup of coffee on the really cool porch out back.
573942,28837044,2015-03-30,14940080,John,"I had a lovely weekend staying in Georgetown at Angielena's beautiful and charming airbnb. Cool ambiance in a nice neighborhood and accessible to downtown, just a bus ride away. Thank you for being such a great host and for being so welcoming! "
573942,30793828,2015-04-27,30015930,Ryan,"Nice, well-located, and inexpensive lodging option. Everyone was really nice.  There are pubs, restaurants, and shops within the immediate neighborhood district. "
573942,32646983,2015-05-19,1368114,Sandy,"100% positive experience staying here! Upon arrival, we were greeted and given a tour of the space by Angielena who made us feel comfortable and excited about our stay. Loved the vintage feel of the room! The bed was very comfortable with the light, down comfortable. 

This was our first time visiting the Georgetown neighborhood and would definitely visit again! Really great restaurants, coffee shops and amazing antique decor stores just down the street. Our stay was over the weekend so we got to enjoy the Georgetown Trailer Park Mall that is located right behind the building! So fun. Thank you, Angielena!"
573942,33477267,2015-05-28,5810892,Manuel,"An affordable accommodation in a very arty neighborhood with a good selection of restaurants. Also, you can get to Downtown surprisingly fast. (We did it by car, but there is a bus station right in front of the house.)
We had some trouble getting in the building for a few minutes but it turned out that Angielena was just making sure everything's clean and couldn't hear her phone meanwhile. She was cleaning the awesome shower, which I would so love to have at home! :)

Once we were in, we meet Angielena's lovely little dog and she gave us a good tour of the whole place. Impressive building with a cool history!

We were a little surprised that the room didn't look like the one in the listing, but that apparently happened by accident: wrong room posted as available, while the it was already occupied. I guess there wasn't a big difference between both, so we didn't really care.
Note though, that the place feels somewhat like a hostel with private rooms, so if you are looking for a more close-up relationship with your hosts, this might not be perfect.
On the other hand, if you are looking for something affordable in a unique neighborhood, then this might be perfect for you!"
573942,33729115,2015-05-31,2799821,Greg,"Really enjoyed my stay here. The room was very comfortable, located in an amazing old building right in the center of Georgetown. Angielena was a great host, easy to communicate with, and gave me lots of information about the neighborhood (there's a ton of stuff within easy walking distance)."
573942,36163173,2015-06-26,34988396,Yuqi,The host canceled this reservation 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
573942,36868428,2015-07-02,14644227,Nicholas,"Angielena, Savie, and the handful of resident artist are all wonderful, warm, and welcoming. My room was clean and cozy, the common areas were tidy, and any concern was addressed promptly. Georgetown is a funky neighbourhood with good restaurant and bar options. Getting groceries and doing laundry were a bit of a pain as a trip to adjacent Beacon Hill or West Seattle are necessary. Loved it though, highly recommend it."
573942,37895203,2015-07-11,198885,Carolina,"Ok sometimes you come across such kind people that light up a room and you automatically like them so much! Angielena was that person. She welcome us with a smile and showed us so much of the building we were staying in. The building is probably one of the COOLEST airbnbs places ever. I mean artists are there creating art. The whole place feels so creative. It was such a great environment. And very clean. Angielena show us around and gave us the story behind all the little details of the georgetown building. Im a lover of vintage, and the room was called ""Vintage room"" Everything was just so quaint and cozy. The bathroom was state of the art. Pretty cool. The balcony was heaven. I sip my tea enjoying the nice breeze. Angielena thank you for being so kind and trusting. And making us feel right at home! :)"
573942,38296481,2015-07-14,6824962,Mark&Wendy,"Going to Georgetown for the Art Attack and staying in the lovely vintage room was an adventure. Angieliena gave a warm welcome and showed me around the place to see the room, the luxurious bathroom and the guest's kitchen. Each place afforded comfort, beauty and sometimes excitement. I slept well in the comfortable bed and liked most of all the shadow on the wall that the chandelier cast of a nine foot candle. The spacious marble shower has eight different shower heads. The kitchen was a fun place to meet other guests which turned into an impromptu Trader Joe's run. The Art Attack event is worth seeing with all the friendly artists selling their wares. It was a fun stay in an interesting arty area of Seattle that was away from the heavily trodden tourist spots and filled with fun, very open and friendly, funky, arty types."
573942,38887504,2015-07-19,13077732,Tina,"Our stay in Georgetown was amazing and beyond my expectations! I'm incredibly happy I got to know this little part of Seattle because of Airbnb, otherwise I'd have no idea about this hip part of town. Angielena was super sweet, nice, and accommodating. She greeted us with her Jack Russell, who we adored. The tour and history of the building was informative and teaching us how to use the AMAZING 10-head shower was imperative. 
The was a mishap in which our Georgetown room was given to another guest so we got the Toulous Lautrec room instead. We got dinner so Angielena could have some time setting up the room. It was perfect for a couple, red and romantic. I highly recommend that room for couples! 
Angielena was super caring and responsive but can be hard to reach via call sometimes. We were stuck outside for a while before a resident let us into the building and informed her of our arrival. I also wish I would have gotten to know her and the other artists as well but my interactions with the ones I did meet were splendid!
The kitchen is super small and cozy. I only used it to heat up food and make tea (she has a neat collection). 
The Georgetown Trailer Mall is right behind the building. It's an amazing little place and I got my new favorite vintage purse from there :)
She also let us but our bags in her studio on the last day since we had a late flight! I didn't need to lug around my 50-lb backpack thank god. 
All in all, a great stay and I hope to stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle!"
573942,39219463,2015-07-21,6712318,François,Awesome place and awesome hostess! Georgetown was our favourite area of Seattle. Angielena's building is in a really cool street with the best Mexican restaurant a street corner away. The building is a fascinating place filled with cool people. My girlfriend and I totally recommend it.
573942,40658111,2015-08-01,30857446,Judith,"Angielena war super nett und hilfsbereit. Check-in und check-out verliefen völlig problemlos. Zusätzlich hat sie uns gute Tipps für Seattle gegeben. Die Unterkunft hat ihren Charme: Bad, Küche und Zimmer super, nur ging in dem ""Vintage"" Zimmer das Fenster zum Innenhof und daher nicht zu öffnen (weil Klimaanlage am Fenster). Zudem trafen wir in der Unterkunft andere nette Leute. Trotz der Entfernung zur Innenstadt, war diese sehr gut mit dem Bus zu erreichen (Haltestelle direkt vorm Haus). Würden wir weiter empfehlen!"
573942,42579913,2015-08-14,38089892,Sara,Angielena was a very helpful and friendly host. The neighborhood is really fun and funky. I loved the vintage-y old hotel vibe and all the fantastic art. 
573942,43355187,2015-08-19,30924487,Megan,"Great location in Georgetown, with a lovely old-timey, artistic vibe. Angielena was an awesome host, very accommodating and helpful. The room was cozy and had air conditioning and the bathroom was DELUXE. Overall, it was a great stay. Thanks, Angielena!"
573942,43979179,2015-08-23,3153014,Lisa Myshall,"Angie Lena was a charming host. The rooms are above an artist enclave and it has a very 'Hostel' feel to it. There are lots of stairs, so be sure not to pack a huge suitcase as I had, because lugging it up the stairs was cumbersome.  

The room we reserved was quite small,  although I did expect it as the picture of the room seemed accurate from the site.  As much as Angielena was an exceptionally kind host and the tour was quite extensive, I would make a few suggestions that may make for a more pleasant stay:

1. New towels. The towels provided were so thin and scruffy, one could see through it.
2. Memory foam mattress for bed topper.  The mattress was extremely hard and uncomfortable. 
3. New Pillows and bed linens, plus duvet. The bed linens felt tired and old.
4. New paint in room. It would be the best  bang for your buck to give the room a bit of a facelift:).

Now, as a Co host for airbnb, I so understand the expense of these items, as she has many rooms, 10 or 11 I think. But perhaps one room at a time to 'upgrade' would make a world of difference. 

The area has lots of funk and color to it, and that's why I booked it. I would happily stay again if these changes I humbly suggest could be made in the future."
573942,44689041,2015-08-28,436604,Regina Jue,"Angielena was a great host. She greeted us with a lot of information that was very useful to tour the Seattle area. The room was a quaint room with a lot of personality. The bathroom was around the corner from the room but it was marked ""private for guest only"", so it was available any time we needed it and it was clean and had many products for you to use if needed. Our room was also next to a small kitchen area which was great for a morning coffee or (website hidden) there is allowed, however I preferred to try the yummy eateries around town. The building itself has a great history to it which is great for the artist in all of us.
The town of Georgetown has great places to eat, good beer breweries and its close to downtown (where all the touristic things are). It's the oldest town in Seattle and its got a great vibe to it."
573942,45007312,2015-08-30,15569601,Mary,Angielena took such good care of me! Her warmth and knowledge of the building and neighborhood made me feel right at home.
573942,45248491,2015-09-01,33801257,Wim,"The vintage room was a small cramp room next to the communal kitchen. Poorly ventilated and noisy. Some people managed to start making coffee and cooking in the middle of the bight! The building is an old industrial site from 1904 with wooden floors and stairs in a 'hip' neighbourhood with lots of bars and activities. There is a wonderful bathroom, but there are also two filthy bathrooms. In our room there was no possibility to hang our cloths or wet towels. Not a place we'd choose again. Besides, we stayed for 2 nights and never met our host!"
573942,45550397,2015-09-04,28971941,Rebecca,"Angelenia was so welcoming from the moment she met us outside her apartment. She gave us a great tour, so we could ask questions and learn some history of the surrounding area. 

It was lovely to be able to use her kitchen and she made us feel very welcome to help ourselves and enjoy the space like it was our own.

A great stay if looking for something unique with independence- An extra perk were the great skyline views if driving the easy 10 minutes into the city! 


"
573942,46520556,2015-09-11,11577770,Patrick,"Amazing spot in a great neighborhood. The building has a lot of character, is clean, spacious, and has the friendliest people running it. Thanks Angielena and Fred. There is no better place to stay in Seattle as it has the best combination of neighborhood, culture, value, building charm, and people. I highly recommend it!"
573942,48220310,2015-09-24,26033187,Jack,"Room was exactly as expected, with a wonderful bathroom in the building, and Angielena was more than welcoming as a host. I felt instantly at home, and the new memory foam mattress-topper was a welcome plus. I would recommend anyone staying on the Seattle outskirts to stay here :)"
573942,49915821,2015-10-07,10218711,Rebecca,"A completely wonderful stay in the Georgetown neighborhood. Several restaurants, bars and most importantly coffee bars within short walking distance. Our host was so welcoming and made us feel at home. I loved sitting out on the balcony drinking coffee and eating scones. Easy 9-10 dollar über ride to all the main attractions! "
573942,50934186,2015-10-16,42706040,Cate,"Angielena was a wonderful host. I loved all the little details and extras that made me feel welcome during my visit to Seattle. The space itself was very cool and unique, and Georgetown is a funky little part of town that I wish I had more time to explore! I would definitely return to stay here again."
573942,54857093,2015-11-25,7091526,Ginger,"Our host greeted us at the door and was happy to see us since it was a return visit. She had just gotten back from Europe but still was positive and friendly, even with little sleep and jet lagged! We love Georgetown. It is historic, the oldest settlement in Seattle, and everything is a few steps from Angielena's door."

2373176,11362747,2014-03-31,12780538,Melissa,"This was our first time using airbnb and it was a very pleasant experience! Anna's place was great and Queen Anne is the best neighborhood! We didn't get a chance to meet Anna but she was very friendly and helpful over the phone and left us a list of a bunch of places to go/eat in the Queen Anne area. I can't say enough great things about that neighborhood! We even went walking around in the rain and it was beautiful! Anna's space was just perfect for the two of us, I would recommend it for any couple's getaway! "
2373176,13912141,2014-06-08,12839501,Adam,"If you want to have a great experience in Seattle, I absolutely recommend staying at Anna’s place.

My wife and I had a wonderful time thanks to Anna. We stayed in her basement apartment that had 

all the amenities you could need in a nice hotel – great size living room, bed room, kitchen with all 

appliances, nice sized bathroom. We also were relieved to find a washer and dryer available since we 

were continuing on with our trip for another week after we left Seattle. It was an easily affordable price 

for what you are getting. 

More than just a very comfortable place to stay, Anna also made you feel right at home as soon as you 

walk in. We came into her apartment to find a bottle of wine and a detailed list of things to do in Seattle 

and places to eat. Anna was born and raised in Seattle, and her recommendations were incredible! We 

tried out some spots on her lists and loved them. She knows how to make Seattle a great trip.

Lastly, Anna lives in a gorgeous area of Seattle. She has a great location on Queen Anne’s Hill that is 

surrounded by beautiful houses, adorable bakeries and boutiques, but most importantly, a stunning 

view. My wife enjoyed taking morning jogs around the neighborhood (always finishing with a geat cup of 

coffee around the corner from our stay), and we both loved taking in the view of downtown and Mount 

Rainier a few blocks away at sunset.

Bottom line – there is not enough great things we could say about our stay here. You will undoubtedly 

love it too!"
2373176,14224786,2014-06-15,13619429,Ryan,"Absolutely wonderful experience at this basement apartment! Cozy & clean are the perfect two words to describe this place... it's perfect. We used the full kitchen to cook some amazing fish bought at Pike Place Market, which is just a short 10 min drive away. The neighbourhood is unreal... so lush, quiet and beautiful. Do yourself a favour and make the 25-min walk or 5-min drive south to Kerry Park and take in the best view in the city! Anna is so friendly and accommodating... we couldn't ask for a better host. It's honestly the perfect place for a couple to stay in Seattle at a great price. Highly recommended... we'll be back without a doubt!"
2373176,14437031,2014-06-19,7128020,Gabrielle,"My husband and I took a short trip to Seattle for a little getaway!  I had been to Seattle before and stayed in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood.  I knew that if I went back again, this is where I wanted to stay!  When I found Anna's cozy, clean hideaway, I knew I had to jump on it!  The place was perfect for our stay!  Anna has it decorated so nicely and it really is cozy and clean!  My husband and I were very happy with our stay and with Anna!  She was very helpful and responsive.  I'm so happy to have stayed here and hope to be back soon!"
2373176,14611420,2014-06-23,12589100,Matt,"Anna's basement apartment was wonderful! My wife and I found it to be the perfect hub for our Seattle getaway.

A two minute walk around the corner gets you to Malena's Taco Shop, Macrina Bakery (amazing bread, pastries, brunch, etc), and Ken's Market. A 0.4 mile walk east gets you to the Queen Anne strip with a number of restaurants and shops, and a fantastic farmer's market on Thursdays. The neighborhood is beautiful, with tree lined/covered streets and great craftsman style houses. Really nice to walk around.

Getting to other neighborhoods such as Fremont was a breeze, as was getting to downtown. We had a rental car, but there's a bus stop right around the corner. Parking was never a problem; plenty of open spaces right in front of the house.

We'd happily stay here again on our next visit to Seattle!"
2373176,15035973,2014-07-01,3138864,Nick,"We booked this for our friends who were attending our wedding. Here is what they had to say:

Anna's basement was indeed cozy and clean, as my wife and I enjoyed a nice weekend in Seattle. The basement apartment has all the amenities you could find in a nice hotel, such as a good-sized living room with a nice TV and cable, bed room with a comfortable queen bed, kitchen with all appliances, and a clean bathroom. There is also high-speed wireless internet free to the guest. A washer and dryer are available for $1.25 each. The place is located in the beautiful and quiet Queen Anne neighborhood, and just walking distance away from Malena's Taco Shop, Macrina Bakery, and Ken's Market. A few minutes of driving would get you to the Queen Anne strip with more restaurants and shops, and Kerry Park (on the south slope of Queen Anne Hill, located at the corner of 2nd Avenue W. and W. Highland Drive), where you can see an incredibly amazing view of downtown Seattle! Overall this is a great place in a wonderful neighborhood, we would totally recommend to people visiting Seattle!"
2373176,16170617,2014-07-22,2996901,Lionel,Anna was very accommodating and offered clear guidelines. The place was spacious (although maybe not for the super tall folk) and was as cozy as could be. Queen Anne is awesome and Anna's place offers easy access to touristy spots such as the Space Needle. Would highly recommend!
2373176,16235158,2014-07-23,18335086,Matthew,My girlfriend and I stayed one night and it was a great experience. Everything was super clean and nice. I had a very short and easy commute to south lake union for an early morning interview. If you need a place to stay I would highly recommend this.
2373176,16342934,2014-07-26,9640740,Phil,"Anna's place was super convenient for trips into the city, and the space was just what we were looking for during a short stay in Seattle. The apartment is just around the corner from a bus stop (and great Mexican take away) and there was a great park across the street which our 1 year old loved. Anna was very easy to communicate with and was so welcoming when we arrived a little bit earlier than expected."
2373176,16721578,2014-08-01,16883161,Carlos,"This was my fiancée and I's first time using ABNB, and Anna set a precedence that I believe will ruin my future stays. First off, the accommodations were far better than what we expected. Clean, spacious, and cozy, you feel right at home when staying there. The neighborhood has a quiet and homey feel to it as well. Friendly people, small bakery and convenience store around the corner, make a stroll around the block extremely enjoyable. If your looking for a little noise, downtown Seattle is only a 5-10 minute cab ride, or 45 minute bus ride away. Public transportation was very easy to use in Seattle, and bus stops were right around the corner as well. If you enjoy the outdoors, Discovery Park is close by, which has amazing hikes with stunning views of the water, Mt. Ranier, and the Olympic Mountains on a clear day. Unsure about what to do, or where to eat, just ask Anna. She makes herself available to you with a text, email, or phone call, and her recommendations will not let down. As you can see, we had an exceptional experience, and when we visit Seattle, we know who to look for first when deciding on a place to stay."
2373176,17110697,2014-08-07,1989959,Linnea,"We coincidentally arrived at the property at the same time as Anna. She let us into the apartment and gave us the lay of the land, which was very helpful. The place was clean and well put-together. Anna provided maps and suggestions for places to go in the city. The only downsides were the distance to Downtown (Though it was accessible by bus and for the price, the location can't be beat!) and the ceiling height (My 6'6"" husband had to duck most of the time.).

Overall, we loved the neighborhood (its proximity to bakeries, restaurants, and Kerry Park for a beautiful view of the city) and would definitely come back!"
2373176,17555029,2014-08-14,14511170,Laura,This was a great Airbnb experience.  Anna is a fabulous host and the space was perfect - exceptionally well cleaned and maintained - although if you are very tall the ceilings may be a little low.  The neighborhood is amazing - great coffee cafe and bakery and close to bus lines to downtown.  Everyone was so friendly and never hesitated to help out visitors from the East coast.  Anna and her lovely airbnb helped me have one of my best birthdays ever.  Highly recommend - 5 stars!
2373176,18467429,2014-08-27,12747590,Susan,Great location and well equipped apartment. Good recommendations for what was in the area and how to get there. No problem with access and communication with Anna was easy and responsive.
2373176,18624070,2014-08-29,18681696,Jeff,"This place is great. It is in a nice, quiet section of Queen Anne, about a block from the #2 bus line, with the Macrina Bakery between the two. Fantastic. Anna is a wonderful host, and very responsive via email or text. I can't say enough good things.  Great first airbnb experience!"
2373176,19405348,2014-09-12,8078103,Dan,Great place in what is arguably Seattle's best neighborhood.  Good places to eat and stores within walking distance.  Easy transit access.  Abundant street parking  Kitchen was unusually well stocked and furnishings new and comfortable.  Easy transition into the place.  Anna and her family were gracious hosts
2373176,19819936,2014-09-19,17871260,Craig,Anna took care of everything. I will be recommending this place for anyone who travels to Seattle.
2373176,20086960,2014-09-23,66190,Pat,"One of my best AirBnB experiences. Smooth and straightforward, Anna made everything so easy with clear instructions and good local knowledge. Anna lives in a beautiful part of Seattle, this is a perfect spot for a couple who'd like to experience the city without the bustle of downtown. The apartment has everything you'll ever need, highly recommended. "
2373176,20283122,2014-09-27,13171550,Gina,The host made me feel welcome. She provided clear directions of how to get into the unit and she sent me multiple emails to make sure I knew exactly where to go and what to do.
2373176,20569786,2014-10-01,15914687,Sung,"The room is like a 5 star hotel, and it's neighborhood is very safe and beautiful! Highly recommended!"
2373176,21378340,2014-10-16,16885781,Cyndy,"All around awesome place to stay. Cozy, private apartment, charming neighborhood and terrific welcoming host. I did both a short stay and longer stay with Anna. Was able to both work out of location and spend fun filled time in Seattle. Was even able to cook a few meals for son attending SPU. Close to downtown and great walking area with lots of shops and restaurants"
2373176,21602263,2014-10-20,3394308,Lynn,The place was very cozy and very comfortable. The neighborhood was fun to walk around in. Trader Joes was just a 15 min walk away. The nearby bakery and taco shop were great.  It's only about 3 miles from downtown. It's also 3 miles from Discovery Park. 
2373176,21881872,2014-10-26,21150035,Erin,This was my first airbnb experience and I am so thrilled. Anna's place was even better than described. The neighborhood was amazing and we were so close to everything we wanted to do in Seattle. After a long day of exploring it was almost as if we were returning home to our own apartment. Anna provided recommendations for the neighborhood and we were not disappointed. One of our favorite things to do every morning before we headed out to explore the city was to stop by Kerry Park near the apartment to take in a view of the city. Anna is an excellent host so don't hesitate to stay here!
2373176,22139190,2014-10-31,15353551,Susan,"Anna was very easy to communicate with, and the apartment was perfect for us.  Very cozy and conveniently located.  The restaurants and bars in the neighborhood were excellent and fun to try.  "
2373176,22581064,2014-11-10,227322,Kathleen,"Anna was very welcoming. The location is excellent, walk one block to Macrina bakery, one more block to Ken's market. Both have meals, or cook in the great kitchen. "

2373176,23819030,2014-12-11,23814925,Katy,"We loved our time in queen Anne! The place was just as described and the bed was comfortable. It was everything we needed and very convenient. It's a nice, quiet street with plenty of parking. We could hear people above walking around upstairs a lot,  but that's to be expected in a basement apartment."
2373176,23909679,2014-12-14,23953639,Mindie,The cozy cottage was perfect just as described. The neighnorhood was awesome. Very close to shops and stores.

It is a small place but had everything you need.. Kitchen, living room, really nice bedroom and bath. We really enjoyed having the kitchen and Anna left us water bottles and some little snacks which was nice! Anna was also Super responsive! Definitely recommend Anna and her place! "

I had everything I needed for the week I stayed.  Anna thought of everything.  She is friendly and welcoming.  This is a small but perfect place to stay in Seattle!  I will definitely keep this as an option for future visits to the Emerald City."

The place was just as described, w/some nice touches like a blow dryer and things you don't want to haul.  Enough room for a pack-n-play in the bedroom. Very family friendly w/a park across the street. Charming little part of town. Easy to get to any part of Seattle. I would stay there again for sure."
2373176,26603763,2015-02-16,17601601,Maddy And Cody,"Anna's place is simply amazing. She puts in a lot of work to ensure that your trip is best. Cody and I went to Seattle to spend valentines weekend and our anniversary. Anna had the TV playing love songs upon checking in and left small chocolates on the counter for us. She was available any time we had questions and was super nice when I had forgot some additional information she had sent me on how to get into the listing. Anna also left a recommendation list of local restaurants, which was perfect for valentines night. The location of her listing is perfect and in a safe neighborhood. We had a fantastic time in Seattle with Anna's help. If you are traveling to Seattle, we highly recommend staying here."
2373176,27014163,2015-02-23,12786505,Jenny,Anna's place was just what my boyfriend and I needed on our working weekend in Seattle.

The apartment is located in a safe neighborhood with coffee shops around the corner that made it convenient for early morning starts in the city. It was a pleasure staying with her.

Anna pays attention to small details. I've been able to cook and feel like at home! The area is great, quiet and beautiful with gorgeous view, close to everything. I used the bus to move around (downtown and to wsu) and it's been very easy. I hope I can stay with her again in my next trips to Seattle. Thank you Anna! Grazie!"

After asking for recommendations for things to do, she went above and beyond to ensure we had a great experience. It was my boyfriend's birthday and she made sure we were taken care of at the restaurant she suggested! She had 2 glasses of champagne + a personalized menu ready for us when we got there!

2373176,32821448,2015-05-22,30202165,Ines,"The apartment was as described: cozy, clean and very well equipped. The neighbourhood (Queens Anne) is the best of Seattle: beautiful, quiet, green and a huge range of little shops and restaurants. Anna was a great host and provided us with a great description of the different neighbourhoods. We enjoyed out stay."
2373176,33088632,2015-05-25,8488141,Diane,"Perfect! Clean and cozy, just as described. We would definitely stay again. Thanks Anna for providing a great home away from home. "
2373176,33561636,2015-05-30,4690494,Eva,"A lovely unit in a beautiful neighborhood with a gracious hostess.  The apt is clean, comfortable and has all the conveniences of home.  The bed is super soft and the neighborhood is quiet and safe making for a restful sleep.  We had a car which made travel convenient but if going into downtown before 8p be prepared to pay for parking.  Otherwise, a car is great and necessary to explore parts outside the city.  Downtown was about a 10-15 minute drive.  Parking is readily available on the block and there are few restaurants and shopping venues within walking distance.  Anna is responsive and full of great sightseeing and dining ideas.  She is extremely warm and friendly.  I highly recommend this unit and if we return to Seattle, we hope to stay here again."
2373176,34846143,2015-06-13,22732245,Joanne,"Lovely quiet and private apt in wonderful neighborhood. Anna left complete instructions on the neighborhood and how to get around. Apt was clean and as described.
Only comment to take note of is be careful if you are tall. My son at 6'3"" had to stoop in places

I would definitely recommend to others and would stay there again

2373176,35537081,2015-06-20,26117931,Lisa,"This was a great rental.  The Queen Anne neighborhood is so quaint and has a nice small-town feel.  The unit was clean, comfortable, and very homey.  The bed is really comfortable, and the shower has wonderful water pressure.  The location is amazing:  almost everything we wanted to see was only 10-15 minutes away.  Please note:  the ceilings are LOW.  I missed that in her description, and my 5'11 hubby barely fit.  "
2373176,35809797,2015-06-22,11476764,Chris,"Anna's apartment is large, comfortable and located in an excellent neighborhood. It also has very well equipped kitchen and a luxurious bed. The apartment was well described by the photos. There are shops and cafe's only 2 min walk away. Anna gave us helpful information prior to arrival. It was easy to park our car next to the house.  A great stay all round."
2373176,36523775,2015-06-29,31050943,Nicholas,"What a wonderful vacation! I planned this trip because I was proposing to my partner, and did so on the first day, and he said yes!  Everything was as described, and we enjoyed our week in Queen Anne.  Anna was a gracious host, and we ran into her a few times, and she was adamant about making sure that we were enjoying our stay, and to make sure we didn't need anything.  It was pretty hot the week we were up, but luckily there was a fan tucked away in the closet that came in very handy.  We had all the comforts of home, and would love to come back to stay again!"
2373176,36976146,2015-07-03,13535203,Judy,"Anna's place was wonderfully clean and comfortable!  It was a great place to temporarily call ""home"" while we were visiting Seattle.  The place had everything that we needed plus Anna's special instructions on how to get around and where to go to for the special sights.  The neighborhood was safe, quiet, and just a lovely stay.  Anna was also very kind to check-in with us to make sure we were doing well.  I would recommend her place to anyone looking to stay in a terrific and cozy place while visiting Seattle.  Thanks Anna for being a gracious host!"
2373176,37286003,2015-07-06,26972911,Vikrant,"Apartment is very clean and nicely decorated ... Location is really good .. Host had left clear instructions and access was easy. 
One thing that we noticed was the ceilings are low, so a tall person might not have enough room"
2373176,37569961,2015-07-08,31315875,John,By emailing us before & during our stay to ensure that everything was going to plan & that there were no issues. Also we arrived a little early & we were allowed to leave our bags there while the place was being cleaned. This was much appreciated after a long overseas flight. 
2373176,38476470,2015-07-16,26712436,Marlene,"Beautiful, Clean, Comfortable, and Centrally located in a quiet and peaceful neighborhood. This apartment is within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the breathtaking view of Kerry Park. My husband and I walked everyday ""up and down the hill"" (about 2.5 miles or so) to the restaurants and park. The neighborhood is beautifully landscaped and peaceful. Pikes Market is just a short drive as is downtown. This is our first visit to Seattle  and couldn't have asked for more! Anna's apartment is truly as described and more. "
2373176,40425009,2015-07-31,29179693,Cole,"The apartment was very clean with everything we needed for our 10 day stay in Seattle. The neighborhood was very nice with convenient markets/cafes within walking distance. Our host was extremely well prepared with all the necessary information available. Seattle was an amazing city that we would love to visit again someday. I would highly recommend Seattle, the Queen Anne neighborhood, and this Airbnb to anyone looking to stay in Seattle. 5 stars all around!"
2373176,41308166,2015-08-07,742259,Robert,Another great stay at Anna's!
2373176,41629656,2015-08-08,69134,Melissa,"We had a great stay at Anna's Airbnb! Everything was exactly as pictured, with lots of thoughtful touches like towels & shampoo being provided. We had to arrive late at night, and were relieved that Anna made it so simple & straightforward. She'd given us a code for the outside entry, unlocked the unit door, and left the keys & instructions out on a table for us. We were able to park for free on her block, which was great. Everything we could have needed for our stay was on-hand: dishes & glassware in the cupboards, extra towels, etc. We were a little worried about watching TV late at night, as we could hear when someone was walking around upstairs & we didn't want to keep them up, but we tried to keep the volume low and hopefully it was fine. We spent most of our time out & about in the city, and it was great to have a ""home base"" to come back to when we needed. Would definitely stay there again! "
2373176,43600902,2015-08-21,25911247,William,This is 5star accommodation. It's a small suite of rooms. I arrived late because of delay in Boston.   The instructions to gain entry were perfect. Everything was perfect for me. I was out all day and arrived to the apartment which is just excellent comfortable and just what I needed. 
2373176,43933495,2015-08-23,32635948,Jen,"Anna's AirB&B was clean and cozy, and just as it was described. I felt safe there and had everything I needed."
2373176,44293048,2015-08-25,34145712,Maryln,"Ana left typed info on table for our review regarding local stores, restaurants and lookout points.  The digs were comfortable and well stocked. Would stay at Ana's again."
2373176,45451135,2015-09-02,39690949,Amanda,"Anna was a fabulous host and her basement apartment was stylish, posh, and cozy. Located in the heart of Queen Anne, it's an ideal place to stay if you want to access the entire city. 

Anna is a Seattle native and very accommodating for those looking for tips and directions, and she checked-in with me, mid-stay, which really made me feel safe and awesome."
2373176,46694824,2015-09-13,21460844,Janet,"Anna was awesome! Quick to respond, listing was exact! The accommodation was superb -  very comfortable, clean, and located in a great neighborhood. And everything really was well organized to make our stay run smoothly. Anna has thought of everything and we were so pleased to have discovered this wonderful apartment in the family-friendly and convenient Queen Anne neighborhood."
2373176,48686764,2015-09-28,35465727,Hyweda,Anna was the perfect host she thought of every detail . The apartment exceptionally clean and very comfortable walking distance forcoffee and other conveniences hope to stay there again when in the Seattle area
2373176,49036957,2015-09-30,42684708,Bekki Witherell,"What a wonderful experience! My first Airbnb accommodation and we loved it! Cozy, clean, a rare gem for sure. Great location, close to everything. Anna left easy instructions and wonderful suggestions. I would recommend Anna's place for your next visit to Seattle. "
2373176,49459475,2015-10-04,41867594,Claire,"We had a wonderful time at Anna's air bnb! She was the best host, every before we got on the property. I was looking for restaurant recommendations and she happily did some research and gave me a call to answer some questions I had. It is a beautiful location in Queen Anne and a perfect spot in between downtown and Ballard. The neighborhood is very safe and the apartment was also very safe and clean. It had all of the amenities we needed, too! She checked in on us the first day we got there, and made sure we had everything we needed. I would highlight recommend this spot to anyone who wants to venture to Seattle and explore for a long weekend! Thanks again, Anna!"
2373176,49855138,2015-10-06,34880537,Tyler,"Thanks so much to Anna!  It's a perfect spot in a quiet neighborhood - accessible to everything!  Clean, well-equipped and very comfortable!"
2373176,50771967,2015-10-14,43894106,Bambi,"Great location! Very clean and cute apartment, will definitely stay again. Wifi was a little slow but definitely not a deal breaker :)"
2373176,51183718,2015-10-18,39367788,Linda,"Anna's apartment was perfect for our first stay in Seattle! It was so cozy and comfortable and the Queen Anne neighborhood is quaint with wonderful restaurants and so close to town. We spent everyday sightseeing, then returning to the apartment to relax and regroup. Anna was a great host and was happy to provide us with many sightseeing ideas! She even checked on us mid trip to see if we were having fun. We will definitely stay here again when we come to Seattle! Also, we had breakfast every morning at Macrina's Bakery right around the corner!! Yummy! Linda"
2373176,51513481,2015-10-20,2862556,Jake / Patty,"Anna has a great apartment and was very good with communication. She contacted me on my check in day just to make sure I was all set. The space is very comfortable and well furnished. All amenities a person needs are available. The location is fantastic, quiet and walkable. My only issue was that I am 6'-4"" and it is a garden level apt, so the ceilings were too low for me to stand fully up. Just a ""heads up"" for the tall people out there."
2373176,51796067,2015-10-24,10313293,Charles,"Anna's place was exactly as advertised.  It was clean and cozy, in a wonderful neighborhood, and close to downtown Seattle.  I didn't have much interaction with Anna, although since I've been to Seattle before, it wasn't necessary.  When we did need to talk via text, she was very responsive.  Our stay couldn't have been more pleasant! "
2373176,52325916,2015-10-28,43446618,Lisa,Anna made me feel so comfortable at her cozy apartment!!  I had everything I needed and then some!  I loved the neighborhood - could not have been a better stay!  Thank you Anna! 
2373176,56526461,2015-12-14,25541428,Terry,"Anna welcomed me to her apartment and made sure that everything was fine, which it was. The apartment is located in a wonderful neighborhood close to great shops and bus routes to downtown Seattle. "

5685646,30251680,2015-04-19,940683,Lynn And Lori,"We had a great stay at Abby's beautiful daylight basement.  There is a great view of Lake Washington from the patio.  The beds were comfortable and very clean.  The kitchen area had a small fridge, microwave, toaster oven and all the necessary plates and utensils.  The neighborhood seemed very quiet with beautiful early 1900 era homes.  The streets are quite narrow.  You'll find quite the assortment of classical children's books along with many others for the adults in your group.  There was a nice flat screen TV and good Wifi service.  It was a much nicer alternative to the hotel we were considering."
5685646,30637608,2015-04-25,8525091,Hillel,"Great place to be in, very nice hostess. Amazing view from apartment garden, large and comfortable apartment.  Stayed there with two friends, would definitely come back again, Recommended 
Thx Abby"
5685646,31143080,2015-05-02,5014910,James,Abby was great!  Clear directions. Clean space.  Made sure we were comfortable. Incredible view.  Amazingly quiet space with the sound of birds outside.  Clean air! I recommend!
5685646,31536270,2015-05-06,5126388,Jayne,Abby's place was nice and cozy with a great view.. Very convenient to nearby market and restaurants   
5685646,31674360,2015-05-08,13145379,Alisha,My husband and in laws stayed at Abby's place. Myself and our young children were unable to fly. She was an excellent host. Kept in contact and provided detailed information to my husband through me to ensure their stay was pleasant. My husband said the house was very cute and clean with amazing views. Thank you Abby. 
5685646,31805567,2015-05-10,25039760,一扬,"Super nice! We arrived at 3:00 am and went to the wrong door, and Abby showed up to help after got my phone call. Sorry about that, Abby. The house is absolutely fantastic. Clean and warm. Ample space for a family."
5685646,32362908,2015-05-17,31230476,Leslie,My sisters and I had a great time at Abby's home!  Beautiful space and view; and Abby was very friendly and welcoming.  We would definitely stay here again and I have already recommended this listing to another Angeleno :)
5685646,32643767,2015-05-19,31034916,Biao,"We were a group of four people for staying only one night. The place is really cozy, clean and nice. Only 15 mins drive from downtown. The kitchen is simple. There is no stove in the kitchen but there are microwave and a coffee machine and two sinks where you can make easy food."
5685646,33109153,2015-05-25,5080392,Tessa,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Garden Suite. It is conveniently located close to Capitol Hill and Pikes Market. The accommodations are comfortable and inviting. We enjoyed the Hi-Spot cafe and GlassyBaby shops just up the road. Thanks for opening your home! We plan to return soon.
5685646,33689332,2015-05-31,2675261,Hadar,"I had a wonderful time at Abby's! The unit is exquisitely furnished, sparkling clean, and comfortable, the garden is delightful, and the neighborhood is stunning. The unit is equipped with everything you might need, there's street parking, and heading downtown is a breeze. Many thanks! "
5685646,33964387,2015-06-02,33995715,Kevin,"We have stayed in many cities and countries, every type of hotel and hostel...and Abby's place is beyond perfect. She was flexible with our schedule and made sure we always felt at home. Close commute to everything the city has to offer. Would not come back to Seattle and stay anywhere else. Thanks Abby"
5685646,34064506,2015-06-04,31299783,Cara,"We, two active senior couples, enjoyed the spacious comfort and peaceful setting of Abby's daylight basement apt.   The neighborhood is charming and the business district along 34th St.  has a variety of good restaurants including a homemade ice cream store.   We easily connected to downtown Seattle and Safeco Field by city bus.   Now that we have found Abby's place, we definitely plan to return.  Thank you for sharing your beautiful space!"
5685646,34166528,2015-06-05,34405837,John,"We had a wonderful time at Abby's place! It was very comfortable, perfectly located, and had a cozy feel. Her hospitality and communication were top notch. Thanks so much Abby!"
5685646,36009661,2015-06-24,29062111,Ganesh," Stayed here with my parents and in-laws. The place can comfortably accommodate 4-6 people.  Great view from the the garden and a lovely basement suite!

Its in a quiet and serene neighborhood with ample street parking space. 

Abby was a great host. She accommodated all my requests. The pets are friendly and made the stay even more pleasant."
5685646,36159851,2015-06-25,36534094,Jewels,"Hello, staying at Abby's place was very nice. It was our very first time staying at an Airbnb place and because of our experience with Abby and her place we will do it again. Abby was very friendly and had the place cleaned up and feeling like home when we arrived. Also the French doors to the beautiful view was an extra bonus. Driving into pikes place was easy. I would highly suggest staying in Abby's warm,comfortable, friendly home and neighborhood. Thanks Abby for having us, jewels"
5685646,36190531,2015-06-26,8149922,Miriam,Abby was a great host & our stay was lovely. She was very helpful as we left something at the house and she got in touch with us right away so we could come back to pick it up. She even offered to post the clothing back to us which was very generous. 
5685646,36398984,2015-06-28,5594068,Rebecca,"Abby was very friendly and accommodating! She was very quick with communication as well. The garden apartment was great for our 4 guests. Great view, easy 20 min drive to downtown."
5685646,36686634,2015-06-30,32993721,Ahlena,"We stayed 2 nights at Abby's place in Seattle. Her directions to get there were great and there was plenty of space to park. The apartment had plenty of space for my family as well. Unfortunately there were a couple things that could have been better. It was quite hot in the apartment and there were no fans, we really could have used a portable fan, leaving the doors open barely helped. Also, there was a very unpleasant smell. It kind of smelled like wet dirty carpet. 
Abby herself was very helpful and kind! "
5685646,37455312,2015-07-07,30722527,Edwin,"Abby's suite is great! It slept four people so comfortably. Abby provides all the basic amenities you'd find at a hotel suite, and then some. 

Communication with Abby was all electronic, yet very friendly. We all felt very welcomed in her home. Location wise, this place is in an eclectic neighborhood with great little shops, eateries, and the view from her backyard is simply amazing. 

A note to future guests: Seattle is going through hotter than normal temperatures and while this place has a fireplace, there is no A/C in the suite. This made for some warm, stuffy days & nights. All in all, I'd stay here again."
5685646,37596797,2015-07-08,36282031,Diane,"Abby's place was perfect for an overnight for my husband and me, my father, and my brother while we were in Seattle for a family reunion. She gave good directions and was very responsive to my questions. The beds were comfortable and we loved the view of Lake Washington.  
One thing that I'd like to point out is that there is only a clear glass pocket door between the front bedroom, which my husband and I used, and the living room, where my brother slept on the couch. I changed clothes in the bathroom so it worked out OK for us."
5685646,38488692,2015-07-16,1916300,David,"A very beautiful home, very comfortable, clean, and welcoming. And, it's just steps from a beautiful beach on the lake! What more could you want?"
5685646,39051224,2015-07-20,3108026,Mike,"We had a short but lovely stay at Abby's garden suite in Seattle. The light-filled rooms were very comfortable and Abby was responsive, accommodating and made us feel right at home. We were also happy to find that the apartment is a short 10 minute walk to a great beach on Lake Washington!"
5685646,39270732,2015-07-22,9714560,Rita,"Our stay at Abby's was great. The view of the lake is simply amazing, the place was very comfortable, the neighborhood is quiet and the pets were very friendly. Would definitely recommend it."
5685646,39408605,2015-07-23,665856,Charles,"I enjoyed my stay very much.   It was a little hard to find, and I am glad that I came in the day.  The rooms were clean and fairly large, and the house was quiet and peaceful with plenty of parking nearby."
5685646,39588959,2015-07-24,7358773,Hannah,"The apartment was gorgeous! In a beautiful neighbourhood a short walk from the sea. It was beautifully decorated with nice linen and towels and a very comfy bed. The garden and views to the sea were lovely. 
There was brekafast facilities too- tea and porridge with honey. 
We had a doorcode and so checked ourselves in and out."
5685646,39817541,2015-07-26,18121229,Ben,Very nice and quiet house and a cute part of Seattle. Cool view of lake Washington and Bellevue. We would definitely stay again! 
5685646,40314355,2015-07-30,30878537,Jane,"We had a incredible time in the Pacific Northwest.  Our final stop was at Garden suite with incredible views in Seattle.  Everything was as presented on the description page. You are offered the bottom floor of the host's home with a privet entrance.  It is a coded key entrance.  After one small glitch, I missed in the the procedure in the descriptive email on how it would worked,  we where on our own to come and go as we saw fit.  No need to bother the host after that. The neighborhood was great, very quiet.  Plenty of parking. We had no problems finding a stop when we returned from our outings. There are a few places to get a meal near by, but this is not down town Seattle, hence the quietness. The accommodation are located in the heart of Seattle, so getting to all the the city has to offer was a snap. Great end to our Pacific Northwest adventure!!"
5685646,40570923,2015-08-01,31304999,James,"Abby made us feel very welcomed, and the accommodations were wonderful, with a great view and great neighborhood.  

We'd definitely stay there again and highly recommend it to our friends and family!"
5685646,40734958,2015-08-02,31310824,Suzanne,Great place in a gorgeous neighborhood. Ask Abby for directions. GPS does not take you to the optimal side of the house. 
5685646,41201728,2015-08-05,2624642,Guolin,"Despite a communication issue initially regarding check-in instructions, we settled into the Garden suite comfortably. It was a cosy space in a great location. The minimalist kitchen was tugged away in a windowless corner, but the tranquil garden and the lake view more than made up for it. The first day was quite hot, but we managed to open a few windows slightly for ventilation. Abby responded to our call quickly and resolved an unexpected problem we experienced. It was a lovely stay. 
"
5685646,41591676,2015-08-08,32183822,Delma Jean,"What a great first airbnb experience! Abby was very easy to communicate with and responded to inquiries right away.  The space was large and the view was amazing. Quite possibly the best neighborhood we have been in with its foot paths, hills and random stairs. We had a great late afternoon swim at the madrona park beach too.  Highly recommend!"
5685646,41734485,2015-08-09,30990176,Alisha,We loved our stay at Abby's! It was comfortable and very accommodating. It was in a very quite and safe feeling area. We had a great time!   
5685646,42131610,2015-08-11,34686476,Jason,"We had a very nice stay here and would come back again.

We found it comfy and it was a nice stay. The place was as advertised. It was a little bit warn in (a few stains on the carpets), but it felt comfortable and homey.

Abby gave good directions, but we made the mistake of trying to rely on Google Maps -- not recommended. You should check her directions very carefully. The streets have a lot of character, which also means many twists and turns, and there is a challenge to get WiFi or a phone connection outside of her house. However, inside her home, she provides internet access, which worked great.

I happened to see Abby when I went for a run (she stays in the upstairs of the house), and I appreciated that she gave us our space and didn't intrude. She was very friendly."
5685646,42517235,2015-08-14,25800930,Philipp,"we stayed with our three kids in the apartment and were perfectly happy. the gardenterrace with lakeview was a wonderful spot for relaxing from all-day-walking in seattle and also having breakfast in the morning! the lovely neighbourhood is quiet and residential, in a 5 minutes walking distance nice restaurants and a laundrette."
5685646,42677101,2015-08-15,16285806,Carrie,"This unit was just what we needed for one night. Nothing exciting, but all the necessities. We never saw our hosts, but we didn't need anything fromthem during our stay either. 
I do feel like the scenery photos must have been taken from the next floor up, but it didn't really matter to us. 
Parking can be a challenge, as can be maneuvering through the neighborhood in a large vehicle."
5685646,43355593,2015-08-19,15958675,Pam,We had a wonderful time in Seattle and Abby's home was perfect for our family.  We loved the location and neighborhood and the view of the lake from the patio. Enjoyed the visit from the family cat and dog too. We really were all so happy with the he and location. Pam
5685646,43510979,2015-08-20,12972732,Lana,"The host was very easy to communicate with before we got there and we got good directions to her place. Follow them closely and you'll be fine. 
However, bring ear plugs!! I'm surprised no one else has mentioned this. It is a basement studio and you can hear a lot of noise from above so be aware before you come to bring ear plugs. 
Second bedroom isn't a true bedroom- there are glass doors that open to living space. "
5685646,43608206,2015-08-21,31036427,Drew,"Great neighborhood, we found the place easily thanks to Abby's description of the roads. Not a far drive from downtown area at all. The rooms were comfortable and everything worked great in the house. The key code to the door didnt work when we got there but Abby fixed it right away. Thanks so much for the stay!"
5685646,45061669,2015-08-31,14595666,Daniel,We had a great time staying at the place. The view is beautiful and the neighborhood is quiet.  We love that there is both excellent food and a lakeside park within walking distance.  The accommodations were comfortable and we had everything we needed.  Thanks so much!
5685646,45259092,2015-09-01,1325478,Martha,"We really enjoyed our stay in Abby's Garden Suite.  What a delight and a beautiful view too.  Abby was very helpful in getting us settled and advising on local restaurants.  She also saved our friend's day by locating her lost sandals and setting out for us to pick up.  Many, many thanks."
5685646,45501327,2015-09-03,4492012,Eddie,"Abby was great, perfect accommodation for us."
5685646,45773032,2015-09-06,23430805,Jerrold,"Abby was visiting her relatives out of town while we were at her house but the suite was excellent, very well kept and comfortable.  We fully enjoyed our stay and would stay there again in the event we are in Seattle.  Her directions for getting to the suite were excellent and were better than our GPS.  Parking was available and easy.  Our only complaint was the rain but, after all, it is Seattle.   "
5685646,46267310,2015-09-09,33612023,Roger,Had a wonderful first time experience with Airbnb. The place is warm and perfect as the description indicates. The hostess was fantastic and looked after all our wants and needs. Overall a place and location to remember and would highly recommend to anyone.
5685646,46373253,2015-09-10,27279300,Gordon,Everything was just as described and we were very comfortable. Abby kindly helped us on arrival because we had forgotten about the keyed entry. 
5685646,47274394,2015-09-17,41467821,Andrew,Great experience here. Lovely garden apartment with beautiful views. 
5685646,47993916,2015-09-22,41328927,Raymond Mike,"This spacious apartment was everything the description promised. We awakened both mornings to unbelievable peace and quiet with the sun rising over Lake Washington and Mercer Island, mountains in the distance. Fifty yards down the hill was a bus stop for bus 2 which took us downtown to Pike St and 3rd. We were a 5 minute walk from our son's house and a short drive from shops and restaurants. We felt immediately at home with everything we needed for a comfortable stay. It was a perfect hideaway in the middle of a huge metropolitan area. Thank you, Abby, for a magical first visit to the Emerald City!"
5685646,48269447,2015-09-25,12245091,Carina,"My father and aunts were the ones to stay at Abby's suite, and they said they had a great time.  The suite was exactly as pictured and they said the view was absolutely beautiful, with a great sunrise.  They loved being able to have breakfast right outside the living room   They were able to easily find parking on the street and found the location to be convenient for everything they wanted to do in Seattle.  Thanks Abby for providing a good experience for first time AirBnB users!"
5685646,48409351,2015-09-26,702034,Edward,What a great place to stay! The view is awesome when you wake up and the house is very comfortable and has everything you need. It was perfect for our family of 5. Very cool neighborhood and close to the city. A bit tricky to find but Abby was super helpful helping us find the place at night. Thanks for letting us stay!
5685646,48543178,2015-09-27,8197854,Paul,Abby was a great host. Place was as advertised. Thanks again.
5685646,48854701,2015-09-28,34457873,Katelyn,"I really enjoyed my stay at Abby's. Her place is absolutely lovely, and she was very accommodating. I will definitely stay here again! "
5685646,49591342,2015-10-05,32573531,Mike,"We loved staying in the Garden Suite, the view of Lake Washington was fantastic. Abby was an excellent hostess, she made sure everything was fine but did not intrude on us. The suite was very nice with 2 bedrooms and the kictchen was fine for our needs as we ate most meals out. There was coffee which made me happy that I did not have to go looking for coffee on our first night there. We got to visit with Abbys dog and cat and loved them both. Would highly recommend, in an extremely quite neighborhood with very nice homes. Very nice restaurants nearby on 34th Street."
5685646,50197907,2015-10-10,32865191,James,"This was our third visit to Seattle and we really enjoyed staying in a different area.  The neighborhood, local restaurants and views were great.   We enjoyed the place!"
5685646,50744123,2015-10-14,36244896,Carol,"My sister and I loved being here for a 4-day sister rendezvous. Very comfortable and peaceful. Everything we needed. We also found Madrona to be a lovely area, with great little restaurants nearby. Short walk to the bus and nice walk down to Lake Washington, which is a great place to stroll or run.
"
5685646,51428136,2015-10-20,13473954,Lars,"We enjoyed our stay in Seattle very much.Abby is a great and very helpful Host.The House feels like a Home,and it has a quite nice Neighbourhood.I would love to come back.Thank you soo much Abby!!6Stars!!"
5685646,51733376,2015-10-24,43799829,Shawn,"Great place to stay with a view to die for for.  Very clean,  feels like your at home and the three sets of French doors are awesome.  Thanks Abby!"
5685646,52052910,2015-10-26,10642092,Quinn,"Extremely friendly host. 
Suite is immaculate and perfectly located and set up. 
Great start to my Seattle trip - a true highlight of my stay!"
5685646,52570907,2015-10-31,10994036,Katie,"We loved staying at Abby's basement suite - It was one of the highlights of our trip - to have our own entrance, living room, french doors, AND a view! The place was super clean and had everything we needed for a 5 day trip. When we come back to Seattle, we definitely plan to stay here again. 
"
5685646,53332263,2015-11-08,12336958,Ashley,"I stayed at Abby's beautiful home this past weekend with 5 other girls. The space looked just like the photos. There were 6 of us and we didn't feel cramped at all! Our stay was amazing, the view was beautiful and the neighborhood was cute! We had everything we would need and Abby was kind enough to leave us a blow dryer. The house wasn't hard for us to find but we also took a cab. I could see how it could be a little confusing because every time we ordered an uber they kept showing up on the street below Abby's (he house is nestled in between two streets) so just keep that in mind if you use uber/car service. It wasn't a hassle for us though. Thank you again Abby for opening your home to us! "
5685646,54575807,2015-11-22,40519127,Ming,"Nice view, and the French doors are very nice. But someone left her underwear on the dresser in the smaller room, and that didn't got clean up. And too bad we couldn't enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning watching their view because the coffee machine was not cleaned. The used coffee filter was left inside the coffee machine and molds were growing in it. "
5685646,55785940,2015-12-06,792195,Gabrielle,"My four days in Seattle were most wonderful. I used to live in the city, and have family and friends there, so it's rare I would turn to an Airbnb listing for accommodation, but in this instance it made the most sense. Abby's suite was everything I needed, and then some, making my stay in Seattle warmer and drier, the perfect place to retire for quiet and a peaceful sleep. Proximity to everything the charming Madrona neighborhood has to offer was ideal. Great cafes, restaurants, coffeeshops, and more can be found either within a brief walk or drive, and it's a lovely area to just walk around in, period. With a rental car and GPS, it was no problem getting to other parts of the city, as well. Abby was friendly and helpful when I reached out, and gave me plenty of privacy otherwise. And then there was that view! In the morning, whether cloudy and rainy, or during a clear sky respite, waking up to the sunrise across Lake Washington and points eastward kind of made my day.  I would happily stay here again, and definitely recommend it to others who want to feel at home in a great Seattle location."
6886633,35533546,2015-06-19,35488168,Michael,Place was great. Shawn was very accommodating. Trailer was clean. Great location. 
6886633,35626336,2015-06-20,9564112,Christopher,"My short stay at Shawn's was fantastic. The space was well maintained, everything I needed was provided and Shawn was incredibly friendly. Also, the location is awesome. I'll definitely be back."
6886633,35752095,2015-06-21,12644288,Leah,"Shawn was very helpful, and a great communicator. The trailer was clean and lovely, as well as a great place to stay after the Fremont fair.  The mattress was surprisingly comfortable, and I slept well."
6886633,36064837,2015-06-24,34487563,Amelie,"Shawn was an awesome host and very helpful. The El Ray was so cosy and clean. Just exactly what we were looking for. 
The busstation was just a few minutes away, so we could reach Downtown quickly. Also the neighboorhood was great, we felt safe all the time.
We highly recommend it!"
6886633,36161112,2015-06-25,6824152,Rori,Shawn was rad and so was the El Ray! I will most definitely be back!
6886633,36735968,2015-06-30,1990165,Eric,"Shawn was a great host, and we loved the airstream. Compact, but plenty of storage space, etc. Shower was on the fritz, but he let us use the one in his house so no worries. Great location, quiet, but close to action in Ballard/Fremont. Definitely recommend. "
6886633,36823884,2015-07-01,36290141,Chrissy,"Shawn is a relaxed and gracious host. The El Rey is clean, comfortable and adorable. It is ""tip top"". The neighborhood is one of the best in Seattle and close to about everything. I have found the perfect little place to stay when in town. "
6886633,36928647,2015-07-02,1193231,Carlo,"This was glamping at its finest. We wish we could of spent more time in Seattle. The El Rey is a pretty awesome to stay at if you are passing through Seattle. Shawn was awesome for waiting up late for us, and making sure we were all settled in. We'll definitely want to stay again next time we are in Seattle. "
6886633,37026603,2015-07-03,37282650,Carolyn,Shawn was great! My husband and I were road tripping across the west and knew we wanted to stay in Seattle. We came across this unique opportunity and are so glad it worked out. Shawn is an artist! His backyard was beautifully designed. The El Rey was fantastic! It's super clean and cozy. Loved the shower! Shawn took the time to give us some ideas for dining and entertainment. We were able to walk a few blocks for local food and yummy bourbon! Overall this was definitely a highlight of our trip. Shawn and the El Rey are now a wonderful part of our story. 
6886633,37270416,2015-07-05,37346940,Charles,"Nice, relaxing, good (email hidden)rst time using the airbnb system. "
6886633,37795614,2015-07-10,14453508,Angie,"The El Rey camper was a delight to stay in, once I familiarized myself with everything.  It was clean, the bed was comfortable, the little bathroom was just like a camper - and totally fine and functional.  The shower was awesome - good water temp and pressure.  Sweet backyard, quiet neighborhood.   
I didn't meet Shawn in person but spoke to him on the phone a few times with questions about the camper, wifi, orientation, etc.
I would have appreciated printouts of a neighborhood map, and the El Rey's Guidebook, esp. when locking the camper door (which I never figured out on account of a sticky lock.  I couldn't get wifi in the camper during my stay there - my iphone couldn't detect it, though Shawn said it was available. Maybe the router is not close enough?  
Nevertheless..  those are not big problems.  I didn't have a car, and rented a bike to get around the Freemont and Ballard (Frelard! Now I get it!!) and absolutely loved the area. The camper was a nice thing to ""call home"" for a few days.  Coffee supplied, but I wanted to get on my bike and go find another Seattle café for a great Americano.  Excellent restaurants in both neighborhoods, loved the bike trail, loved finding the beach on the bike, and ripe blackberries along the trail.  "
6886633,38320525,2015-07-14,7226806,Amy,Shawn's description was very accurate. The trailer was very clean and was just the thing we needed as a home base while visiting in Seattle. The trailer is located in a private back yard behind his house with access through a side gate. It's located only a few houses over from a busy street but inside the trailer it was very quiet. Thanks Shawn!
6886633,38449832,2015-07-15,37731291,Jessica,"We had a wonderful stay at the El Rey! Shawn is a great host, very friendly and helpful without being at all intrusive. The el Rey was spotless when we arrived. We had a great nights rest on the comfy pull out bed. Shawn also helped us fit our portable crib for our son inside as well. We loved the location- We took a short drives to both Freemont and Ballard. Shawn also gave us great recommendations for camping in Olympic National Park. High recommend!"
6886633,38544961,2015-07-16,4111182,Terry,My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at the El Rey. Shawn was extremely easy to communicate with and recommended a breakfast spot that was right up our alley (Beth's). I kind of wanted to hang out with him more than the friends I was in town to see. The El Rey itself is charming inside and out. All of the amenities are neatly tucked away in the compact yet comfortable cabin. I had a great night's rest and would stay here again in a heartbeat. Everyone feels like a king in the El Rey. 
6886633,38805337,2015-07-18,37005243,Brendan,"Staying at the El Ray was an awesome experience. Shawn was a great host who was super accommodating and easy-going. He can provide you with some great local recommendations to help you discover the area. 

If you're planning to check out the Ballard/Fremont area be sure to make your base the El Ray. "
6886633,38967133,2015-07-19,37011569,Johan,"The El Ray was a fantastic place to stay. We truly enjoyed it and can really recommend it.
We did not meet our host, but he made sure everything worked superfine anyway. Will definately stay there again next time we visit Seattle."
6886633,39135780,2015-07-20,38804400,Matteo,"Very nice experience! The El Rey is great and comfortable. Nice quite area. All perfectly as listed! Shawn and friends are very nice and welcoming.
Recommended!!"
6886633,39247721,2015-07-21,23454700,Ammoura,"One of the coolest airbnb experiences 
Clean. Comfortable. Great host"
6886633,39416867,2015-07-23,36718903,Michael And Irene,We stayed in this property for two nights at the end of our US road trip and it was perfectly adequate. This is an inexpensive place to stay but is very clean and comfortable and is located close to some really nice parts of Seattle and also very close to bus routes to downtown. There is also an oven and big fridge which is awesome.
6886633,39563869,2015-07-24,6977513,Christopher,Shawn was kind and showed his neighborhood hospitality. We walked down to the local Chinese restaurant.  
6886633,39788164,2015-07-26,578331,Brian,"Easy and smooth booking! The El Ray is an awesome camper in a cool neighborhood. Fremont and Ballard are within walking distance, but it's about a mile either way. Shawn wasn't around, but his really nice friend checked us in and showed us around. 

Like other reviews, wifi is spotty, but that shouldn't be a priority. The resident kitty, Willy was really friendly and came by to say hi a few times. The shower temperature was ""hot"" and very enjoyable. We will definitely stay again! "
6886633,40120876,2015-07-28,30718074,Brittany,Shawn went out of his way to make us feel at home and to ensure we made the most out of our short trip to Seattle. The location was perfect for us. We'll definitely be back! 
6886633,40612758,2015-08-01,19871113,Mark,"Shawn was very pleasant and accommodating. When we had to unexpectedly change our plans he allowed us to adjust our length of stay from 2 nights to 1 with no problem.

The El Rey was as advertised. Clean and compact. All amenities worked: shower, toilet, sink, etc. This was a good experience."
6886633,40876560,2015-08-02,13008348,Danric,"First of all, I love his ""Instant Book"" feature. Saves a lot of time from going back and forth. Second, he made it easy for us to check-in without him there. I loved the El Rey. A really cool and unique Air Bnb experience. The pictures are 100% exact. It's definitely big enough for 2 and the bed comes out to be surprisingly kind of big. He has a book full of places and things to do in the area. Really helpful. Had the pleasure of meeting him the next morning. Super chill and made sure we had a good time. Location is good. A few restaurants/bars and breweries nearby and if you don't mind walking a mile, downtown Ballard is there too."
6886633,41106873,2015-08-04,18938180,Pat,"The ""El Rey""was cozy and tidy. Shawn helped us get settled when we arrived. We enjoyed our stay, the bed was comfortable  We did not cook anything but refrigerator kept things cold"
6886633,41389077,2015-08-07,10970125,Marc And Vanessa,The El Rey is quite an icon. Lots of character. What you see is what you get: a no frills camper at a great price. Managed to get a hot shower despite the expectation it wouldn't. Enjoyed it a lot. Shawn is a welcoming and relaxed guy. Engaging but never intrusive.
6886633,41409735,2015-08-07,5500120,Justin,"The El Rey is very cool, comfortable, and clean. Shawn was very hospitable. I would highly recommend staying here. "
6886633,42141762,2015-08-11,36168493,Mira,What wonderful world indeed. We were legitimately sad to leave and staying in El Rey was the highlight of our trip!! El Rey itself was perfect and Shawn is magically fantastic to say the least. Their location is walking distance to tons of great food/drink and public transport to downtown and surrounding areas was a piece of cake. We will absolutely stay here again and can't wait to get back to Seattle -thank you Shawn (Jango and Milly too!) for such an awesome time!!
6886633,42312098,2015-08-12,38920636,Hsuan-Kai,"A fresh experience staying at El Rey – a great combination of urban and wild living styles. The RV is very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable than we expected. It also parks at a beautiful yard with a modern fence designed by Shawn.  He is also a very friendly host who speaks gently. I especially like the booklet he prepared which tells you what to visit and good restaurants nearby.  The only small drawback is that the street was a bit busy at night, but not a problem once you falling into sleep."
6886633,42435515,2015-08-13,14007327,Veronica,"El Rey was a dreamy oasis in a bustling but calm area. Close enough to downtown Seattle for the convenience and value, but far enough for a quiet escape. 

The trailer was clean, spacious, and well-stocked. The bed easily + comfortably slept 2 grown-ups. The bright decor and  amenities made El Rey feel like home. 

Shawn was the perfect host. He was available to show us around and help us get settled, but also gave us space when we needed some rest. Shawn is a great person to talk to -- intelligent, conscientious, and full of amazing tales. He also knows a lot about the local marijuana industry if you're into that kind of thing. 

Overall El Rey exceeded our expectations. Looking for a crash pad for the night, we discovered a cozy, comfortable, and charming gem. "
6886633,43243112,2015-08-18,36477027,Abigail,"Super cool to stay in an airstream! would've wanted to stay longer and Shawn was a friendly host, thanks for having us!"
6886633,43643175,2015-08-21,16878670,Emily,Shawn was a great host! He has a lot of good neighborhood recommendations and was super hospitable. We really enjoyed our unique experience staying in the airstream and would for sure come back!
6886633,44654225,2015-08-28,33694274,Mary,Fantastic! What a cozy little place.
6886633,45257757,2015-09-01,36542611,Michael,"The El Rey was a great home base for our trip to Seattle. There were two of us staying, so we were worried about space, especially since we were coming in for a wedding and needed to bring nice clothes. But we managed quite well - and the El Rey is set up efficiently. It's definitely snug, but the bed opens up to be quite spacious, and there's  plenty of space to store things, move around, hang out, etc. Shawn was a great host and answered any questions we had immediately. He also got us a steamer for our clothes, which was clutch!

The only word of warning we'd give is that you should stay with someone you're quite comfortable with, as the bathroom doesn't offer much privacy.

But overall, it was a very fun, unique place to call home for a few days and felt like a glamorous way to camp in the city. We would definitely stay here again. The location is great and close to a lot of great restaurants. We had a car and the street parking was incredibly easy and free."
6886633,45407857,2015-09-02,16151559,Amber,"Staying in El Rey was a really great experience. Shawn was nice, and helpful when we needed it. There's plenty of privacy, it's just enough room for two  the camper is very clean and modern looking, with small toiletries that you might forget, like lotion and shampoo! This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was awesome! We were lucky to have Shawn as our host. He even contacted us when we left a few small items behind, and offered to shop them to us for free. Thanks again to Shawn and AirBnB :) "
6886633,45565999,2015-09-04,29391092,Meredith,"The El Rey was fabulous!  Everything was just as described. The sleeping accommodations were perfect for two and the bathroom/kitchen had everything we needed.  We especially appreciated the coffee and   french press.  

We had a terrific time visiting Seattle and hope to be back soon.  We'd love to stay at the El Rey again and would recommend it to anyone we know who wants a fun place to stay in Seattle.  

Thanks again!"
6886633,45674705,2015-09-05,3093198,Jillian,"El Rey is accurately described as ""glamping."" A nicely renovated interior space with room for two. There are plenty of small touches which Shawn has put into the camper to make it feel homey. Located between great neighborhoods (Fremont & Ballard); it's worth staying here, a few minutes drive away from downtown Seattle. Shawn was accessible and quick to respond via text. Great spot for an overnight, decent space for a weekend stay. "
6886633,45786822,2015-09-06,282196,Kristen,"Great place! This is such a fun camper experience - and it's walking distance to some great restaurants. It's very quiet and really nice backyard area for hanging outside. There is also a heater if it's cold that works well inside. Thanks, Shawn :) "
6886633,46004615,2015-09-07,1131640,Ryan,"If you're reading this review, you must be on the fence about the El Rey in Frelard.

Let me just say: you would be missing all of the fun, if you do not camp out in Shawn's backyard. Six out of a possible five stars. Top notch. This is what happens when Airbnb gets it right.  "
6886633,46279787,2015-09-09,26859762,Maria,"Shawn was an amazing host, totally friendly and welcoming! The El Rey was just as the pictures show, clean and comfy. Unique accommodation. The neighborhood was very easy to navigate and the info in his guestbook and the tips he gave us were great. Easy to get to with public transport from the airport and downtown. Would definitely do it again, thanks Shawn!"
6886633,47156657,2015-09-16,163366,Marie,"nice decorations inside El Ray,  you can walk to cool cafes/bars, comfortable stay...Shawn was a super kind and great host!!!"
6886633,47284918,2015-09-17,266136,Stephen,"Sean was very welcoming and did his best to prepare the trailer before we got there despite our unplanned early arrival. He’s a fine host and the El Rey is truly unique: a classic trailer with modern updates in a good location and at a extremely reasonable price. 

There was only one disappointment: the propane tanks ran out of fuel before we arrived, so there was no heat or warm water for our 1-night stay. This meant a chilly night and no shower. Sean was apologetic, and offered his home shower to us in the morning. Running out of fuel was an honest mistake for a new host, but I wish he’d offered some discount or compensation for the significant downgrade in the listing."
6886633,47656372,2015-09-21,38034441,Avery,"Shawn was a perfect host. He was welcoming, helpful and pleasant. The El Ray looked just like it did in the pictures. It was super cute inside and there was plenty of room for all our stuff, including hanging all our wedding weekend outfits. We also spent time outside relaxing in the Adirondack chairs with a fire going. We truly enjoyed our stay. We especially loved the privacy or our ""own"" place. 
The neighborhood was nice and quiet. There were good places within walking distance to eat that had food for most types --  burgers or vegetarian fare at the same places, a great breakfast joint, pizza, etc.. We took the bus once, which was easy, and we used Uber cabs most of the time, which were great."
6886633,47887003,2015-09-21,44204241,Branden,Very welcoming and accommodating host and had a great night's sleep in the El Rey! Only wish I could have stayed longer. Oh yeah...had a hot (not warm) shower! Cheers!
6886633,48051107,2015-09-22,44519206,Heather,Everything we wanted it to be! Thanks Shawn!
6886633,48158116,2015-09-23,31055636,Alec,"Staying at ""El Rey"" was a great experience. I arrived somewhat late, but Shaw was extremely accommodating. The room was comfortable, clean and modernized, complete with all you could hope for. If you are staying in Seattle, this makes for a fun experience out of what would otherwise be a boring hotel room. It's quirky and colorful, plus it's in close proximity to a number of restaurants and bars. And if you have any questions about which one of those to visit, Shawn has great suggestions."
6886633,48333858,2015-09-25,1324315,Jena,"Shawn was the most charismatic, gracious host ever. A perfect 10 on the personality of the El Rey, Shawn himself and his trusty Milton the cat. 100% recommend. Good neighborhood, walking distance to some really great restaurants and bars."
6886633,48700503,2015-09-28,33463251,Cong,"Shawn was a great host. He was very friendly and helped us with everything we needed. The El Rey was very clean, organized and practical. We would recommend Shawn and the El Rey to everyone who travels to Seattle."
6886633,49070334,2015-09-30,44970338,Dustin,"Shawn was there to greet us as soon as we arrived and was very friendly. The El Ray was awesome and exactly as described. Shower was definitely hot as long as you adjust the taps! The neighborhood was perfect especially if you like beer! Great places to eat, drink, relax, and only a $13 uber ride into downtown."
6886633,49126375,2015-10-01,13740029,Laura,"Shawn was a very friendly host. Always available if we needed him. The El Rey is very sharming. We slept very well. Comfy bed, good bathroom with all amenities. Loved the place. We took the bus downtown and took us about 15 min and was just a 5min walk from his house. Perfect location. Quite neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend. "
6886633,49257191,2015-10-02,44196581,Taylor,Nicest place in Seattle!
6886633,49770550,2015-10-06,38506389,Gabe,"Shawn was awesome. He was ready for us when we arrived and showed us the space. He responded quickly when we needed anything! The El Rey was just what we expected from the listing and we had a blast staying there. The neighborhood is beautiful and there are a lot of restaurants, boutiques and bars a short walk away. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a simple base while you're in Seattle."
6886633,50156234,2015-10-09,10243711,Anita,"I've never stayed in a place like this so I didn't know what to expect. Shawn was very accessible and accommodating.  The place is a trailer after all, so you feel every movement.  It was tastefully decorated (just like glamping) with amenities you need including adirondaks and fire pit outside.  My teenager daughter and I slept comfortably and our only wish was for stronger wifi inside the actual trailer.  But if you sat outside, it was great - but we're Californian's so it was a bit chilly for us even with the throw blankets he had ;).  Oh, no little shower mat so be careful coming out but the shower was hot enough, heaters and even french press with coffee beans/grinder.

Location was great - a quick 2 minute drive down to the hip Market street down Ballard but overall, you're in a nice, treelined quiet neighborhood with ample street parking.

Overall, it was welcomed surprise that didn't throw me off on the idea of staying there again.  
"
6886633,50289003,2015-10-11,6123481,Christine,What a great experience to stay in an airstream trailer! Even thought we only got to talk to Shawn the last day we were there he was friendly and helpful. The place is what we expected as described in the listing.  Hope to come back to Seattle soon! 
6886633,50461840,2015-10-12,21103844,Nicole,Shawn provided my first Air BnB experience. The accommodations were delightful. The airstream is equipped with all the modern amenities you could ask for but still holds that charming retro feel. Love his personalized touch of the guest book that answers any questions you may have and provides a list of nearby restaurants and attractions.  
6886633,50734814,2015-10-13,1033888,Carlota,"We had a great stay in the el rey, Shawn was really nice and helpful.  Highly recommended!"
6886633,50772560,2015-10-14,15925070,Caleb,"Our stay at the El Rey is what makes Airbnb great. A unique experience in a fun city with a host that provides tons of recommendations and suggestions for a fun stay.

Shawn was a great host, quick to communicate and ease with giving us access to the El Rey.

The neighborhood is great -- quiet, close to a lot of fun restaurants, brewpubs and bus stops. 

I couldn't recommend The El Rey more."
6886633,50911056,2015-10-15,39925872,Paolo,"Great experience, I love that you dont have to bother the host as you have a stand alone room instead of it being in a shared living space. Shawn was great, he worked with me on my short stay, making it easy to check in and out despite my short notice. El Rey itself is awesome, well kept, practical and story worthy. "
6886633,50995725,2015-10-16,46431341,Jim,"Just had a nice 1-night stay at the El Rey. Shawn offered good communication to coordinate our arrival. The trailer itself is small, but - it's a trailer; was perfectly cozy for 2 people. Its re-habbed interior was clean and cute. Shawn had prepared a binder with lots of helpful info about the neighborhood, getting around town, a broad range of eating spots, and more. Neighborhood noise at night was minimal. A French press and ground coffee in the trailer's tiny galley was welcomed in the morning, as was the shower, which offered plenty of hot water. Altogether it was a unique and comfortable (for what it is) place to stay, and a convenience in an otherwise almost hotel-free part of Seattle."
6886633,51469425,2015-10-20,44964625,Anna,"Enjoyed staying here very much!  Had a great nights sleep on the pull out bed, and the space didn't feel too cramped for my boyfriend and I.  Very cool place to stay in, and in a cool location and neighborhood."
6886633,51615911,2015-10-22,4490636,Dante'Y,This was the perfect little location for us to stay. Easy and close parking. The place is perfectly stocked with necessities. Ideal for your self alone or a couple. 
6886633,51922222,2015-10-25,23863793,David,"The description of the place was perfectly right, the neighborhood is great, and being at walking distance from Ballard avenue is nice too.

The El Rey was perfectly romantic and well equipped.

We appreciated so much the coffee bean, the grinder, and the cafetière!

Thanks,

We will be back soon!"
6886633,52187313,2015-10-26,1835341,Carlie,My sister and I stayed the night in the El Rey and it was great for what we needed. We wanted to explore a neighbourhood rather than stay downtown and had a fun night drinking and eating in Ballard area. Checking in and out was super casual and easy. The place was clean and the bed was cozy. We were hoping to google some restaurants and bars in the area as well as access maps but couldnt connect to the wifi unless we were outside close to the house- wouldnt have been a prob on a sunny day but it was raining whilst we were there. Bus from downtown was easy and super close. 
6886633,52755011,2015-11-01,2595026,Kelly,Very cozy and convenient. Easy to locate from the bus stop and I was able to access the El Rey without anyone being home. There was a small fridge to put snacks and it was equipped to make coffee in the morning. The space was clean and organized.
6886633,52905773,2015-11-02,10159719,Derrick,"We loved our stay! The El Rey was so unique and cute! We also did the list of breweries provided by Shawn, which was very enjoyable. We would highly recommend. The bed was also very comfy and we felt at home."
6886633,53111959,2015-11-05,19003047,G. Daniel,"Nice place, great communication, fun location. Use a lighter to get the stove top working. If the gas heater is troublesome ask for the electric one. Sometimes the toilet handle sticks open, just push it back."
6886633,53341796,2015-11-08,11953664,Karissa,"The El Ray was a great home away from home. Simple, clean and conveniently located. We had no problem getting in and out. The bed was comfy and the heater worked great during the cold evening. Thanks for having us!"
6886633,53783245,2015-11-12,19749308,Drew,The El Rey is amazing. The inside is quaint and perfect for 1-2 people. Shawn sets you up for success by having a well put together guide book on the kitchen table. I woke up every morning and grabbed a hot chocolate from Java Jahns and usually hit one of the MANY awesome bar/restaurants within walking distance. I found the shower to get pretty darn warm and had no issues with the facilities. As others have mentioned the only snag is that it is hard to get wifi in the El Rey. Overall it was a great experience.
6886633,53898632,2015-11-14,46900813,Andy,"We did not get communication lines identified and so missed a couple important messages from our host, but he, Shawn quickly responded when we arrived and we worked things out.  We loved the trailer.  "
6886633,54094805,2015-11-16,28472763,Richard,"I had a nice stay at Shawn's El Rey.
Although I did not meet Shawn in person I was able to check in and out without any problems. Shawn prepared everything very thoroughly: there was a binder with helpful information, extra blankets for cold nights, some extra coffee and even shampoo and body wash.
All in all, the El Rey was an awesome experience. Thank you, Shawn! "
6886633,54579630,2015-11-22,15054723,Brayden,"Shawn was really nice, checked in on us during our stay, and was super helpful. He provided a binder full of personal recommendations which were awesome as well. Our stay in the El Rey overall was really fun but I honestly wouldn't recommend staying for longer than a few days. You have to go outside to access the wifi which isn't awesome in winter weather and, while there's a full kitchen, it isn't equipped to use for cooking. The location was really awesome, a block away from the bus stop which takes you directly downtown in just over 20 minutes. I'd definitely recommend the El Rey for those who want something a little different :)"
6886633,54835748,2015-11-23,4000984,Bjørn,"Unique and well appointed Airbnb in a convenient location - walkable to interesting spots and buses.  It will put where the locals hang and the trailer is just freakin cool.  Shawn has a good thing going, thanks!"
6886633,54939978,2015-11-25,49203293,Sean,"* Shawn's listing of the property is spot on-- no surprises
* The information binder Shawn provides is comprehensive and a fun read
* The neighborhood is friendly and walkable
* Would revisit
* Highly recommend!"
6886633,54985191,2015-11-27,45071746,Tim,"The El Rey was exactly as advertised, a funky 50's trailer, nicely restored with care.  A very comfortable place to spend two nights, though we now know that we wouldn't want to live full time in that small a space. We appreciated how well Shawn communicated with us and his carefully prepared directions for life in the trailer.  It was unusually cold for Seattle while we were there but we were pretty comfortable with the heated provided."
6886633,55859835,2015-12-06,31729854,Sam,"Shawn was a great host. He met us at our arrival and gave us a quick run-down of the El Rey. The listing is accurate, and the trailer is really cool. The trailer heats up really quick with the small space heater that is provided. Location is primo for an UBER to Ballard or Fremont. Great jumping-off point. It rained like crazy all evening/night and it was really cool to hear it on the trailer. Thanks Shawn, we'll be back."
6886633,56103856,2015-12-08,50665167,Lucy Augusta,"Great stay! Listing description was super accurate, and Shawn could not have been more welcoming. We loved it!"
6886633,56207025,2015-12-10,49824582,Brandon,"Awesome place to stay. Very friendly answered any questions we had.
"
6886633,56254057,2015-12-11,48947542,Brittany,Shawn was an amazing host! There to welcome us and tell us how things worked. Loved his binder of recommendations. The space was perfect and delightful!
6886633,56398037,2015-12-13,25432310,Laura,"We had a nice stay in Shawn's airstream! It was a great little getaway for our one night trip up to Seattle. Even in winter, it had a cozy atmosphere - a true ""glamping"" experience."
6886633,56765617,2015-12-17,29662363,Wes,Staying in the El Rey was an awesome experience! It's very clean and cozy and was a joy to stay in. Shawn was really warm and welcoming from the moment I met him. I'm definitely coming back for another stay!
6886633,56792614,2015-12-18,5463636,Kelcey,The El Rey was very comfortable and Shaun was quick to respond every time we contacted him. The restaurant and cafe recommendations included in Shaun's notebook were spot on and it was easy to walk to yummy Seattle food. We'd definitely stay there again!
1732441,9433944,2013-12-28,10663274,Amanda,"I was there with my wife, sister and dog, we all had a great time without any inconvenience and 200% satisfied with Marcell's hospitality. The house had everything that I needed and perfect location for trip in Seattle. Clean, comfortable, cozy and beautiful. I already miss that place. Furthermore, Marcell is very thoughtful and kind, he will do anything for your convenience. He is the best host who I have ever met through Airbnb,  "
1732441,9818154,2014-01-12,1028430,Jodi,"Marcell was very nice, but he had to be out of town for work prior to my staying at his place.  His father met me and showed me around. There had also been some electrical problem and a technician was there to fix it.  All of this is background info. that perhaps explains why the place wasn't as clean as I would have liked??  It's large and great value for the cost (cheap for Seattle), but I was uncomfortable with the general lack of cleanliness and opted to leave after 1 night, although I paid for 2.  It's very lived in - this is like going to a friend's house who had just left for a few days, sort of like housesitting. Other than that, Marcell's light sculptures are amazing.  The location is easy for flying into Seattle, as you don't have to drive through the traffic of the city."
1732441,9933690,2014-01-20,806892,Dustin,"We really enjoyed having the entire top floor to ourselves.  Marcell worked hard to make sure we were comfortable and well-stocked.  Good communication before, during, and after the stay.  I also appreciated the green efforts to save energy!"
1732441,10368830,2014-02-16,1808312,Midori,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay at Marcell's place. This apartment is clean, spacious and comfortable. Marcell was always very responsive to all of my questions and available to greet us pretty late on our first night-- since my flight arrived on the later side. The bed on this place is so comfortable! The location was excellent for the Seattle sites we wanted to see and we really enjoyed our stay! Highly recommend this place! "
1732441,11991428,2014-04-21,12120469,Audy,"This guy took really good care of us. 

We stayed here for two months while house hunting in the city and could not have been happier. The space is wonderful--large, clean, comfortable (especially the bed) and with great perks (your own deck, gas fireplace, parking and access to a washing machine). Marcell was an incredibly thoughtful, responsive and accommodating host for our family (which included a toddler and two cats). He was mindful of our space and privacy, quiet and made good on everything in the apartment's description (including the organic cereal, which was really quite good). As a host I really think he went above and beyond (he even keeps spare toothbrushes on hand). 

The unit was an easy commute to the city, and West Seattle is a wonderful and welcoming place. For families traveling with children, the apartment is situated by a school playground and a community center, so there is plenty of space nearby to run around. For families traveling with goats (or equivalently destructive toddlers), it doesn't get better than this. "
1732441,12375871,2014-04-30,3890869,Cara,"Great stay at Marcel's place -- clean, comfortable, and a convenient location on the east side of West Seattle.  Marcel is super friendly and features some neat artwork of his own design in his place, which adds a nice personal touch to the unit."
1732441,12815343,2014-05-12,12130939,Trisha,"My partner and I stayed here with our 9-month-old and it was the perfect, home-like space for a quick get-away. The apartment had everything we didn't even know we needed and Marcell was a very friendly host. We especially loved admiring his incredible art that decorates the space and enjoyed his recommendations for exploring the area. We'll be back!"
1732441,13624396,2014-06-01,6878680,Kes,This is a really comfortable apartment in a nice quiet and green neighborhood which is still very convenient for downtown.  The light sculptures are a great additional feature.  Marcell could not have been more welcoming.  Thoroughly recommended.
1732441,13793976,2014-06-04,1491166,Sayuri,"We stayed for 2 nights including my dog. Marcell welcomed us warmly and he is easy communicate and very laid back. The location is right outside of city, which takes us only 10 mins to get Pike fish market! It's very safe and residential.  There are big school field we could take our dog to run also. It was very nice atmosphere and we like to go back to his place if we are going to Seattle again!"
1732441,14097257,2014-06-11,15967139,Mark,"Green on Green was a wonderful place to stay. Located in West Seattle, Marcell's home offered secluded scenery, yet close proximity to downtown Seattle as well as other attractions in the local area. Distance to downtown is pretty quick, only about 10 - 15 min max. Along with attractions, the hosts made us feel very welcome by giving us ideas of what to do and where to go. Being new to the Seattle area, this was a very big benefit.

Marcell and Judy made sure we were very comfortable when there. They had towels laid out, the rooms were spotless, and there were cereals & organic whole + almond milks for us. Funky art and knickknacks were placed around the unit, anyone interested in the eclectic would find these very enjoyable. Another great plus about the apartment was that there is a private balcony looking into the treeline. This balcony is only connected to the apartment, so it is a great plus for any morning coffee drinkers or smokers.

All-in-all this was a fantastic experience, and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the area. Marcell's price is very affordable considering hotel prices, and the art located in the apartment is a must-see as well."
1732441,14615220,2014-06-23,1172212,Christine,"The upstairs apartment was perfect for my 9 day stay in Seattle. The location was very central to everything and in a wonderful neighborhood. The views from both front and back were beautiful, including the spacious deck out back and the greenbelt park across the street. The neighborhood is nice for walks. Marcell and his family have a wonderful flower and vegetable garden for your view out of the kitchen window. Everything I needed to feel like a home away from home, with plenty of bonuses in the apartment including great artwork, music, books and some instruments. Plenty of space to relax and do any work if needed. I slept like a dream in the comfortable bed. Marcell was a great host. I also appreciated the access to their laundry room. I would definitely recommend staying here for your Seattle experience. If the opportunity presents itself I would stay here again. "
1732441,14751667,2014-06-25,13933906,Rebecca,"What a great space! The light sculptures were fantastic. Marcell was very helpful in showing us around the house, providing delicious breakfast cereals, and giving tips about where to eat, walk our dog, etc. I would definitely recommend this place and would certainly stay again upon returning to Seattle. Close to everything but just far enough away from the downtown hustle and bustle if you're just looking to relax. The huge deck was great too. The value for the price can't be beat!"
1732441,15381611,2014-07-07,7322033,Beau,Marcel was a great host.  He was very hospitable and greeted us when we arrived to show us around.  The description and pictures were accurate.   We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again the next time we are in Seattle.
1732441,16899392,2014-08-04,148418,Stephen,"Marcell was great. He was working in the garden when we arrived and showed us around the place. We picked up the keys, went out for the entire day, and returned to sleep, but it worked for us."
1732441,17101314,2014-08-07,10826187,Stefanie,"Marcell is a very friendly and communicative host. The flat is huge, comfortable and clean with lots of extras such as shampoo, milk, salt, pepper, tea, coffee... If you're a light sleeper, you should consider earplugs, but we got used to the highway quickly. Quick transportation to the city, but a car might be nice."
1732441,17230936,2014-08-09,18287909,Angela,Marcell was a gracious host and made us feel very welcome. He even left freshly picked cherry tomatoes at our door from his garden. The place was clean and very welcoming. The neighborhood was quiet and the view calming. The studio was close to shopping and cafes. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! Thanks Marcell & Family!
1732441,17504954,2014-08-13,16258112,Jessica,"We really cant say enough about this place! Not only is Marcell's upstairs apartment clean, comfortable, spacious, and in a great location, but Marcell is an excellent host. 

We really enjoyed Marcell welcoming us to hang out with him and his family, giving us great recommendations, and helping us get everything we need. He was very laid back, friendly and accommodating. 

His house is in a great location. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood right across the way from a greenbelt (great for walking our dog!). And it was also nice to not be too far from the city (15 mins or so depending on traffic). Alki beach which is right nearby offered a great alternative to touristy things in the city. We tried out great places to eat in the area and enjoyed the beach.

We will definitely want to stay here again if we ever make it back to Seattle! "
1732441,17597889,2014-08-14,19535821,Connor,"Marcell was a very gracious and accommodating tenant for my trip to Seattle. He informed me that the previous guests had checked out ahead of schedule and allowed me to show up early since my flight landed a few hours before checkin. Marcell and his place were very welcoming. He suggested a few good local spots to checkout, as well as cool places in downtown Seattle. I would highly recommend staying at his place if you're in town!"
1732441,17686652,2014-08-16,5734760,Emily,"Extremely pleased with our stay - you won't find more for your money in the metro area. This is a GREAT option for those traveling with dogs - there are nice walking trails right on the street, plus the entrance to the Greenbelt is right across from the house! West Seattle is an extremely charming area, and you can pop right over the bridge to check out all of Seattle's downtown attractions. We'll be back! "
1732441,17773711,2014-08-17,17055440,Lisa,"Marcell was a wonderful host and the home was just as described. He did a great job of showing us around and making us feel welcomed, then let us have our privacy. It was a great experience and we will definitely be staying at his place again next time we are in the area!"
1732441,18051897,2014-08-21,910888,Jacqueline,"Marcell was a great host! Very easy to get in touch with, and very accommodating. The first night of our stay, he invited us to hang out in the garden with him and a few of his friends. We even got to try his Hungarian bean soup (which was AMAZING!). 

The apartment was exactly as described, clean, secure, private, shower essentials were available, as were a few food items in the kitchen. Wifi is available, with a strong (website hidden) is also available, though we didn't watch it. Marcell also procured an auxiliary cord to hook into his CD player so we could play music from our phones. 

Location is great, but if you're not big on walking, I'd suggest having a car or bikes. 

Marcell also helped us out immensely at the end of our stay - we needed to add an extra night, but couldn't stay in Green on Green, so he let us move into the ground floor apartment (look for it soon on Airbnb!) for the extra night, and for a discounted price. 

Would definitely stay here again, in either apartment!!"
1732441,18255888,2014-08-24,18489407,Meredith,"Marcell was very responsive and easy to communicate with when setting up the stay. He was also very accommodating as far as our arrival and departure schedule. The place was great, nice residential neighborhood and in a good location as far as catching the bus in either direction, to downtown or to Alki beach. Just a note that it IS at the top of a hill, so depending on the bus & schedule, guests may have to do some stair/hill climbing. This was kind of fun for us and we were happy to have the exercise and get to know a West Seattle area. All of the comforts of home were included and we wouldn't hesitate to stay again when we are back in Seattle. Marcell even checked to make sure we had enough toilet paper :)!
"
1732441,18366275,2014-08-25,19355614,Gene,"With this being our first experience with airbnb, we were very happy with Marcell's home. His space was very clean and beautiful. Marcell was a great host and very helpful with information about Seattle.  We would definitely recommend his place if you are visiting Seattle."
1732441,18432023,2014-08-26,3417409,Leslie,Marcell was flexible with our check-in time. He welcomed us at the time that worked for us. The space was comfortable and welcoming. The space is walking distance (with hills) to food. The kitchen was well equipped. We enjoyed our stay!!!
1732441,18502311,2014-08-27,16921659,Shawnee,"Staying at Marcells upstairs apartment was perfect. Unfortunately, the Mister and I were only there for one evening and we wish we could've stayed longer! The house is tucked away in a little neighborhood that backs up to a greenbelt (though we didn't have time to utilized it gor a walk), the apartment was actually better than expected as it is larger than it appears in the photos, has a large private deck, and is filled with various mixed-media art by Marcell.  The pieces are made of repurposed material, lovely looking,  and some of them are even interactive!  :) Marcell was very nice and accomodating, we had a few chats-he was just great and he reminded us of a good friend back home. He had towels laid out on the bed when I arrived, gave me a tour of the place, provided tea/coffee/almond milk/various delicious cereals/bathroom necessities, all the kitchen items you could think of, gave suggestions for bars and restaurants, let us pick so many homegrown tomatoes from the garden, allowed use of his home washer and dryer, and kindly let me back inside the apartment after I accidentally locked myself out in the later hours of the evening. :) The location is ideal; away from the hustle of downtown Seattle but within a 20 minute drive of both there and the airport. And the most mind-blowingly comfortable, fabulous couch resides in this apartment.  Seriously its the best couch I've ever sat/napped on. This is where you wanna stay- overnight was great but a longer visit would have been even better."
