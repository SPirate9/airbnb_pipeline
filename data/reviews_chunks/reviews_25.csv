We were able to use the metro transit to travel around to other areas and attractions easily within about 20 minutes so we didn't have to rent a car. Overall, we couldn't have been more pleased with the personal touches Vera added and the convenience of having such a well equipped apartment."
1956274,45792435,2015-09-06,38040511,Lorna,"This apartment in Ballard is quite spacious and in a great location.  You're within walking distance to the downtown restaurant scene and transit options if you wish to go further.  It's a 20 or 30 minute bus ride to downtown Seattle, depending on which bus you take.
Vera had stocked the kitchen with a large plate of fresh fruit, plus fresh coffee, tea and snacks. The apartment also has it's own parking space, which was a real plus since the neighborhood street parking is very tight.  We would definitely stay with Vera again, if again in Ballard.  "
1956274,47074094,2015-09-15,36559170,Jennifer,"This is a great BNB location! It is close to many restaurants (just a few blocks walk) and is a large space for 2 people. There is a large bedroom, 1.5 bathrooms, small kitchen and nice living area. We had a great time staying here. We arrived the first day to a basket of goodies and a few items in the fridge for us to snack on or eat for breakfast. What a nice surprise! :) Vera sent me the code for the door well before my arrival so that there was no confusion as to how my husband and I would enter the apartment. She even reserves the parking space in front of the apartment for you! This is a great place to stay for your Seattle visit. It's a really fun neighborhood and (with the parking space) is a conveniently short drive to many Seattle attractions. Vera also has a list of nearby restaurants and things to do which provide great suggestions on where to eat in the area. "
1956274,47656299,2015-09-21,9096861,Lucinda,"We couldn't have found  a lovelier and more unique apartment in a great neighborhood in Seattle.  Vera was always there if needed, but stayed quietly in the background. She always answered emails/texts with in minutes, but we never actually met. We would love to return to the the Sweet Ballard Apartment  in the future.  The place was very clean, comfortable, with many thoughtful and special treats left for our enjoyment..  The Ballard neighborhood has much to delight everyone in such close walking  proximity to restaurants, sights, stores, and more. We recommend it highly."
1956274,48203599,2015-09-24,15121499,Kathryn,What a perfect place to stay! Vera has considered ever detail to make her listing an extraordinary place to call home for a few days. The space is huge and spotless with everything that you need to be comfortable. Super cozy bedroom and bed and a kitchen and fridge packed with snacks. I felt spoiled and totally loved it! Highly recommend.
1956274,49923601,2015-10-07,10909068,Rita,"This is our favorite of all the Airbnb's we've visited.  Vera is a wonderful host who makes us feel welcome.  The apartment is lovely, and so comfortable.  She is very thoughtful and the basket of ""goodies"" is much appreciated after a very long flight.     "
1956274,51974678,2015-10-25,24868329,Angela,"As last time, Vera was just plain awesome. From the welcome basket of goodies to the great shape of the home to her willingness to answer any of my questions/concerns, you cannot ask for a better hostess. Vera is more accommodating than family but she is warm and caring like family. Upon my leaving, I met one of her neighbors who confirmed what I have known: Vera is a great person. A great person with a great home. "
1956274,54023801,2015-11-15,2707900,Peter,"My girlfriend and I had a great stay at Vera's apartment during a 4-day vacation to Seattle. The apartment is very nice and comfortable. We were particularly impressed by how spacious and well-equipped it is. The location is excellent, too. It's just a short walk to downtown Ballard, where there are lots of great restaurants and shops. It's also just a short walk to public transportation, including buses to and from downtown Seattle, which were convenient and easy to use. A longer walk from the apartment takes you through pretty neighborhoods and along scenic coastlines. The whole experience was very smooth, and Vera was very accommodating."
1956274,55404356,2015-12-01,46883146,Jessie,"This was our first airbnb experience and Sweet Ballard (Vera) set the bar! We arrived very late to find Vera had a welcoming basket filled with goodies not only for breakfast but snacks and more. The apt. was clean and tastefully decorated, even nicer then the photos show. It has a floor plan for 2 people to feel very comfortable in. We were visiting Ballard for our first time and it was central to everything. The communication with Vera was excellent for questions regarding anything. We had difficulty with light switches and Vera responded immediately. Our 1 week stay flew by and we look forward to our future return!"
7064681,38963147,2015-07-19,29910559,Corrine,My arrival was great. I was shown where everything was that I might need. The posting was spot on and the neighborhood was cute and safe. Bob asked me if I had any questions or need anything to contact him at anytime. He also helped me out with the bus system as it was my first time to Seattle. 
7064681,39566755,2015-07-24,7485789,Julian,Always a nice stay with Bob.
7064681,39840228,2015-07-26,22498985,Tiffany,"Bob's yard was great for our tenting experience.  He was friendly, helpful, and very generous with his space! 
"
7064681,41891059,2015-08-09,40540472,Michael,"Bob was a great host -- flexible, easy-going, and he made me feel welcome. The forecast called for rain, so Bob made accommodations for me to sleep inside. I would definitely stay with Bob if I find myself in Seattle again."
942490,3915119,2013-03-26,5581767,Sunil,"Fantastic place to stay!  Great hosts and a great home.  They gave us privacy and were very welcoming into their home.  For us being the first guests, we were very impressed at the level of professionalism meshed with the Bnb touch.  Why stay at an expensive hotel when options like this are out their.  

We recommend this home to everyone, you'll love it!"

942490,4724064,2013-05-21,6017353,Stacey,"My partner and I traveled to Seattle to celebrate our anniversary recently, and we could not have asked for a better location to do so! This was our first time using airbnb, and Lisa and Seth were great hosts! We had the entire downstairs floor of the home to ourselves, with all the amenities we could have needed. They were extremely friendly and welcoming and turned us on to what became our favorite spot to end our nights at. They were also supremely responsive whenever we needed to get ahold of them (1 time...we found ourselves locked out of the house and within a 10 minutes maybe, I had spoken to Lisa and we were back in!). We were within walking distance to restaurants, coffee, shopping, art, the zoo (with good walking shoes), and more! I am so thankful to have had such a phenomenal first experience using the site. I highly recommend Lisa's home to anyone looking for a place to stay, especially if you're interested in being a bit removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown. "
942490,4854972,2013-05-28,4373865,Morris,Lisa and Seth were awesome! They gave us a great list of places to check out both within walking distance and downtown. The space was big enough for our group of five and it had everything we needed. I highly recommend Lisa's home to anyone visiting Seattle!
942490,5088404,2013-06-11,6516566,Evan,"Lovely home and lovely people -- personable, respectful and accommodating. Gave us some great recommendations -- even my Seattle native guest found some new fave spots. Thanks a million, Lisa!"
942490,5227451,2013-06-19,922081,Olga,"This review is on behalf of my parents who spend three weekends in June at Lisa's place:
Lisa and Seth’s basement area is nice and cool, and the cat is a pleasant companion. The only thing we had to get used to was Seth rising early. It woke us up really early as well as the house is quite noisy. After we said something about this to Lisa and Seth they were thoughtful about it. Because we spent most of our time with our children we did not interact that much with the hosts."
942490,5390047,2013-06-27,6855998,Nicole,"Lisa's place was just like being at home. Very clean & great atmosphere! Beautiful home, flowers everywhere outside that was so refreshing to see after waking up! "
942490,5403327,2013-06-28,6866311,Amy,"Very clean & comfy.  Lisa was thoughtful, sweet and a great host all around.  Her cat that stopped by to say hello from time to time was a cute addition to a great stay in Seattle."
942490,5693195,2013-07-12,6393817,Mike,"If you're looking for a homey place to stay this may work for you, but a few things were a little too homey for us:

Yes there is a garden out back but no apparent way to get there and we didn't feel like invading their owners' personal space to try to get to it. The TV didn't work and the DVD player apparently didn't either; I draped a thick balnket across the flashing light from the display so it wouldn't bother me sleeping. There was no breakfast here; not a coffee pot either but there was some instant Starbacks coffee, a few packets.  The bathroom was the best -- strangely no washcloths though. 

The sheets and blankets we were given for the living room sleeping areas looked like the type you'd retire after buying new ones, and the couch was a little stale smelling (I slept on it); I was handed a pillow without a pillowcase. 

I can live with all that for the price -- but the one thing I really didn't like was the cat litter box in the laundry room adjacent to the living room.  Yuk. 

The residents move about upsairs and the floor creaks; we could hear their loud blender from time to time.  

With a little more effort, this could be better:  buy some nice fresh new quality sheets and blankets. Put out plenty of coffee and throw in a coffee maker. A few biscuits or a little fruit for breakfast so that you don't have to run to the store to have anything to eat (We called this the ""Bed no Breakfast"".)  And put the catbox somewhere else.  

   "
942490,5889220,2013-07-21,6950601,Stephanie,"Lisa and Seth were friendly, welcoming hosts.  The bed was very comfortable and the location (close to Ballard area) was great for us. Since it is a basement unit, you do hear footsteps above you..to be expected."
942490,5975448,2013-07-24,7500778,Jamie-Rose,"Lisa's house was our first Air BnB experience. The downstairs room was pleasantly cool and we had use of the bedroom, sitting room, and bathroom all to ourselves. Lisa provides coffee packets, cutlery and dishes, as well as a mini fridge, toaster, and microwave. Very sweet cat that would visit from time to time. Lisa was very thoughtful and helpful- a great experience. "
942490,5990534,2013-07-25,2708738,Tanner,We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa's home.  A very nice space located in a quiet neighborhood.  It was very easy to get into the city or walk to the nearby shops.  One of our favorite parts of the stay was the sweet cat that greeted us as soon as we arrived.  A definite plus if you are an animal person.  We would highly recommend staying here if you are looking for a comfy place to stay in the Seattle area.
942490,6093260,2013-07-29,766892,Eric,"I was thankful for having a place to stay at all this weekend since most other hotels and airbnbs were booked. Lisa's place has some nice positives -- like the sound of running water from the fountain outside. And the downstairs area is nicely isolated from upstairs, which means more privacy. I did not see much of Lisa but my interactions with her were all pleasant."
942490,6148350,2013-08-01,6308295,Ana,This was my first aribnb experience and it worked out perfectly! I am glad I did this. The space was very comfortable and spacious. It was close to neat shops and restaurants. And the cat that lives there is great company!
942490,6344873,2013-08-09,6986908,Patricia,"The stay at Lisa Olsen's was a great experience for my brother Dominique and my 12 year old niece Penelope.  And, honestly, a great experience for myself.  Having recently moved to the USA from Paris, France, and finding myself faced with a visit from 5 members of my family (all coming from Paris) I was in need of comfortable lodging for the family members that I myself had no place in my own house for.  The solution was to have my brother and his daughter stay at Lisa's . . . and it worked out perfectly!  The rooms were clean, comfortable, and inviting.  When I met Lisa, prior to my family's arrival she was charming, organized, and helpful.  She made sure that I knew exactly how to get them ""checked-in"" and where everything was that they would need.  Dominique and Penelope loved the set-up inside the guest apartment, and felt very comfortable there.  As promised, the Greenwood locations is lovely, and they had no trouble exploring the neighborhood on their own and find great places for breakfast and browsing.  I highly recommend Lisa Olsen's guest lodgings to anyone planning a trip to Seattle.   Patricia Fulford."
942490,7046225,2013-09-04,3384736,Amanda,"This was my first Airbnb trip and was very excited cause of the reviews. They were right for the most part. It's a very cozy basement with a nice charm to it. The house location is not bad as there are bus stops just a few minutes away. From the convention center in Downtown, it took about 25 minutes to get to the house. 
We didn't spend much of our days here at the house but it was comfortable at night. Lisa even allowed me to stay past the check-out time because our greyhound bus didn't leave til the evening. 
The only thing negative thing that could not be helped is the unfortunate thin ceilings. I did not mention this to Lisa as it seemed that even with the lighting steps, I can't help but hear from downstairs. This shouldn't be a bother if you start your days around 8:00am. Unfortunately, I do not and am also a very light sleeper. My boyfriend didn't seem bothered as he is a deep sleeper and hardly noticed. 
There are a lot of the family's personal belongings in the rental space. The closet in the room is actually someone's sewing space and there is makeup in the bathroom cabinets.
The reviews were spot on about the family cat. He(or she?) is the sweetest little companion! I have a love for cats despite my allergy and their cat came every so often to say hello and cuddle.
A few more things to mention is 1) We never tracked down the mini-fridge. We simply could not find it. Didn't really need to use it that badly though, just for bottled water. 2) Thank you for the introduction to Moon Pies. They were yummy. 3) Also thank you for the free bus tickets! We received a total of 4 free bus ride vouchers."
942490,10695160,2014-03-03,2775591,Kevin,"I had a wonderful experience staying with Lisa in Seattle. My brother and I were visiting the city for the weekend, and everything worked out so well. The house was gorgeous, and the downstairs apartment where we stayed was spacious, comfortable, and well-appointed. Lisa was really helpful, and stayed in contact with me before and during our stay, which made everything so easy. The neighborhood is great and there's tons of stuff to do right in the area (great restaurants, cool pubs, nice coffeeshops). I would absolutely recommend staying here if you're looking for a nice, comfortable place to stay near Seattle! "
942490,11197780,2014-03-24,1021708,Dawn,Great location and space. Bed(s) were super comfy! Thanks.
942490,11720932,2014-04-13,13480084,Shelley,"Very comfortable and clean
"
942490,12005002,2014-04-21,11801055,Eugene,"Very clean, comfortable and affordable.  I will probably stay there in the future, if available.  I'd also recommend the property to everyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
942490,13740620,2014-06-03,13752117,Jeanette,This is a lovely quiet location central to many Seattle prime site seeing locations  plenty of room in a beautiful residential neighbor
942490,13986642,2014-06-09,4702623,Julie,"I only met Lisa briefly, but her basement was a perfect place for myself and my two girlfriends to stay while visiting Seattle.  Her neighborhood was cute and well-situated - it was very easy to get everywhere we wanted to be!  Thank you, Lisa!"
942490,14108188,2014-06-11,16333528,Bonnie,Lisa was so kind to give us a last minute booking.  it was a nice place to stay.   It was very private with  great snacks and clean cute bathroom.  Loved all the antiques and comfortable bed.
942490,14286042,2014-06-16,4349976,Xinglu,"Lisa very thoughtful and friendly. We were happy that everything (coffee, fruit, oven, etc.) was prepared for us:) The room was nice and comfortable. The little garden is very neat! Overall, we enjoyed our staying"
942490,14848455,2014-06-27,1368039,Marsha,"I was very comfortable in this home.  The bed is the best!  The room is cosy and the space available, including private bath and shared space is very clean, quiet  and welcoming.  The neighborhood is great, very quiet family neighborhood that is near enough to commerce to find coffee, food, etc.  I would recommend this home without reservation."
942490,14992848,2014-06-30,16707834,Julia,"Clean, private, comfortable bed in bedroom, interesting neighbourhood, convenient location and helpful host.  My son and I had a great weekend exploring Seattle."
942490,15163081,2014-07-03,16236259,Jeremy,"Great place to stay - Lisa was very friendly, helpful and pretty much left the bottom floor for my own privacy.  The room and bed were nice, empty drawers for your use, and they were cool about me using their washer and dryer which is close to the private room.  The house is in a quiet and peaceful area and I never had a problem with parking also.  
I wouldn't mind staying here again, but since I'll be living up in Seattle, won't need to anymore! =)"
942490,15274083,2014-07-06,15989563,朱颖,"我们是来自上海的中国家庭，这个房子是个半地下室，我们住的很舒服，在这个房子里我们度过了快乐的时光，但楼上有一只猫，随时可能会下来。                      
     We are Chinese family from Shanghai, the house is a half basement, we live very comfortable, in the house we had a happy time, but a cat upstairs, may at any time.
                 "
942490,15456915,2014-07-09,1658786,Saurabh,"Location is ok. Beds were ok. The place was a low ceiling basement, felt so claustrophobic and smelled like cat litter all around. 
Lisa was very nice and was very accommodating to our needs like iron board and coffee!
But the whole smell thing ruined the stay for us. My wife kept sneezing for 3 days and thus we could only come to sleep/bath & get out!

"
942490,16080830,2014-07-22,14698283,Jason,"Lisa was very accommodating and friendly. Even though she was not present when we first arrived, she provided us with all the instructions to make us feel at home. Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle!"
942490,16490737,2014-07-28,10720594,Vicki,"Accommodations were okay. The bed in the main bedroom is a double, very comfortable, but small. The other bed is a very firm air mattress. My sister and I switched bed each night. I was not aware of the cat when I booked and it was very noticeable there was a cat because of the smell. The location was ideal for where we needed to be. The TV did not work, so relaxing with a cup of coffee with your favorite morning show was not possible. I also would recommend a more detailed cleaning more often, lots of spiders."
942490,17039618,2014-08-06,14078943,Marcella,"For our situation, this was a great location and accomodation. I liked that we were given access to the backyard , because when we were 'home' from the day, it was nice to have a pretty garden to relax in. 
It was very warm for Seattle at this time of year, so we were happy to be outside in the evening.  We had come to Seattle to attend a wedding, so after that event, we took the opportunity to sight see and find things for the children to do...GREEN LAKE was beautiful. We spent two days there letting the kids swim and jump off the pier. Lisa's house is central to everything we wanted to do...The Ballard Locks, Portland Rose Garden, Japanese Garden, etc. "
942490,17510085,2014-08-13,3956964,Roger,"I enjoyed staying in Lisa’s Airbnb apartment.  Three or four times a year I visit my two daughters in Seattle and spend a week or so enjoying their company and all that Seattle has to offer. 
 
The apartment’s quiet location in a very nice neighborhood is a real advantage and yet it is so close to good restaurants, coffee shops and brew pubs. I made several trips to the nearby Ballard Locks to watch boats of all kinds go through the locks and then walked over to the Salmon Ladder to watch the Sockeye Salmon make their way home to spawn.  On Sunday morning my Seattle family and I all went over to the nearby Woodland Park Zoo and a bit later I attended an outdoor jazz concert in the beautiful park next to the Locks.  There is so much to do in this area.  

A private entrance leads into the apartment which includes a spacious living room, a private bathroom and a well-appointed bedroom.  The apartment includes a small fridge, a microwave, a coffee pot, a toaster oven and wifi (of course).  Lisa had a supply of ground coffee and a fruit bowl awaiting my arrival and I certainly appreciated the snack.  

I liked the apartment. About the only problem I had was that I overslept a couple of times largely due to the very comfortable bed.  It's very easy to feel at home in this apartment!  I enjoyed a very relaxing vacation and look forward to another visit to Lisa’s airbnb.

942490,17847933,2014-08-18,12240989,Tim,"Semi-privates Souterrain. Schlafzimmer in Ordnung mit gutem Bett. Sehr gut geeignet für zwei Personen. Bei Belegung mit mehr als zwei Personen muss das Wohnzimmer mitbenutzt werden, wo leider nur eine Luftmatratze zur Verfügung steht.  Gäste sollten mit der zutraulichen Katze zurechtkommen. Sauberkeit war OK. "
942490,18067542,2014-08-21,18058182,Louise,Very pleasant large basement space with resident cat and coffee. Two seperate sleeping areas and an available washer and dryer. Outside    sitting area and lovely yard. Great hosts. We enjoyed ourselves thank you!
942490,18371491,2014-08-25,9179712,Stefanie,We had a great time (especially at Chuck's Hop Shop) and the appartment was perfect for our needs. Lisa and her partner are very friendly and helpful. 
942490,18511119,2014-08-27,19343311,Eva,"This was for me and my family first excperience of aribnb. And we are very gratefull for this excperience, which was really pleasant and it encourage us to use airbnb from now on. 
The place was beautifull, clean, quiet large bacement, furnished with  a good taste with many nice and comfortable details. There are one large room with comfortable air bed and with couch and a bedroom with queen bed (or maybe full bed?) - sooo comfortable. You have a private entrance. If you looking for privacy - you will have it at Lisa's. Outside there is a beautifull garden and nice place to rest, have a drink or just look at the stars. 
Home made cookies and a cake were waiting for us - so we felt welcome from the first moment. It is nice and interesting place for kids as well. Our 7 years old son find games and marbles to play with it. 
Since we love cats we were waiting to see home cat - but he gave us a lot of privacy as well. 
You have a coffe maiker, refrigerator, microwave, washmashine, dryer... 
We were there without a car. Not far from the flat there is a bus which will take you to the center. Neighbourhood is really friendly,  safe, beautifull houses a lot of trees, almost no cars - we walked to the nice greek restaurant...
It was really nice, that early in the morning, when we were leaving for the plane - Seth were there helping us and saying goodby. 
So thank you for the great excperience Lisa and Seth!

942490,18670446,2014-08-30,19292614,Doug,"We enjoyed our four day stay, space was clean, spacious, comfortable, and good value. Good, safe walking area to restaurants and coffee. We took buses everywhere, short two block walk to covered bus stop."
942490,18813509,2014-09-01,19003843,Ruby,"Great space with plenty of room. It even has a private bedroom with a common area! Lisa also left plenty of tea and coffee, though I didn't get the chance to try any. Very good stay, I would come back anytime."
942490,19054518,2014-09-05,7277140,Liron,"The room itself is nice, the bed is very comfortable and the shower is great. The location is a bit off the bitten path, there is a direct bus that takes about an half an hour to downtown. I would not say it is vibrant but about a km from some pubs and cafés. I met Lisa only once, when I arrived, and she was nice but we did not get a chance really meet."
942490,19441292,2014-09-12,19046405,Mim,"This place is cozy and sweet and perfect for a family visiting Seattle.  The beds were comfortable, the shower worked splendidly and there were plenty of towels and blankets to meet a family of five's needs.  The board games and books were a nice touch and it was easy to come and go as we had to do often. The hosts were very friendly and welcoming and made us feel right at home.  This is a great place to stay if you want to feel like you have the relaxed feeling of home on a trip to a new city."
942490,19802269,2014-09-18,21212492,Allie,Lovely space. Perfect location.
942490,19992643,2014-09-21,7709756,Steve,"My visiting out-of-town guest enjoyed very much enjoyed her stay here. She reports that it was very pleasant, quiet, and private, ""Much nicer than a hotel."" I can vouch that it is a nice space, very roomy. We did not actually meet Lisa, but she was very responsive and prompt in our communications via email and text. No complaints at all, and we would definitely recommend Lisa and this place to anyone else. Just watch out for that tricky neighbor cat who pretends to live here!"
942490,20201472,2014-09-25,13322394,Alen,Lisa did an excellent job to make sure we felt we were at home. The listing on airbnb was exactly as described. We had plenty of privacy and it was easy to keep communication between us. Snuggly (their cat) definitely contributed to the at home vibe a very friendly cat that makes you feel like you belong there.  15/10 definitely would recommend this host and their humble home. :)
942490,20383810,2014-09-28,3228980,Dale,"Lisa's place was spacious and what I expected based on the description.  The rate was a great deal considering there were two beds available and a dedicated private living room.  There were amenities provided - and the coffee maker, microwave, fridge and plates/bowls proved to be very useful.  WiFi worked well and access to the room was convenient where we didn't have to bother the host.  Although the basement is open (i.e. no door to it) and I could hear people on upper floors (as they could hear me) - privacy was respected and everyone was generally very quiet.  There is a friendly cat that visits occasionally since the food and water is in the laundry room - but the cat minds his own business most of the time.  The bathroom is newly renovated and it was nice to see starter toiletries provided, and shampoo/body wash.  There is plenty of free parking on the street and the neighborhood is quiet and safe, and not too far from the city center.  I only saw Lisa on my last day there and she provided us with fresh warm coffee cake, which was a nice way to end the stay.  Overall it was a great experience with a great host."
942490,22681641,2014-11-11,14952221,Sokol-Snyder,"The space was very clean and worked well for a short family visit to Seattle.  The bedroom is calm, plenty of fresh towels in the bathroom, and Lisa set up double and single airbeds for our kids in the main room.  This is a tight space for a group of 5, but we spent very little time and appreciated the location and price."
942490,23293972,2014-11-28,15888531,Dan,"Lisa provided my husband and I two very restful nights while we were visiting our son in their Seattle neighborhood. There was yummy banana bread, fruit, and coffee/tea provided for us.  The bed was very comfy and we enjoyed free wifi during our visit. Note that there is no working tv at this location, and there is a cat that needs to have access to the litter box in the basement.  The hosts are very respectful of your privacy at all times. "
942490,24696218,2015-01-01,4292742,Matthew,"Lisa's home was perfect for our group of five during our two night stay over the New Year's holiday in Seattle.  Very easy to find and the check-in was extremely convenient.  We were able to use the entire lower floor of the house, there was plenty of space for all of us with one bedroom and two other inflated beds in the living area.  Lisa had prepared everything we needed during our visit, all the basic essentials including a small fridge and coffee maker with plenty of cups/mugs and plenty of soaps and toiletries in the bathroom.  As mentioned, plenty of books and some fun board games to entertain ourselves with once we got back in the evenings.  Getting into and out of downtown Seattle was a breeze, and it seemed like there were plenty of places to eat/drink nearby.  Overall we had a fantastic time, my visiting relatives from South Korea were extremely satisfied, and we would love to stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.  Highly recommended."
942490,27607465,2015-03-08,28179055,Russell,"Warm feeling in the home. 
Attractive, quiet neighborhood close to vibrant street. I appreciate the coffee and coffee maker and the fridge. Also the quiet.

As a basement apartment it is cozy though a bit dark."
942490,28675672,2015-03-28,24770442,Shenghao,I had a wonderful time in Lisa's house. I like her cat and board games.  Hope to visit her again 
942490,33550397,2015-05-29,33865495,Cassandra,"This was a really nice place. It was centrally located and convenient. We didn't spend a ton of time there, as we had many activities planned, but it was a wonderful place to stay"
942490,34798928,2015-06-12,33777291,Tim,"The accommodations provided by Lisa made our stay in Seattle enjoyable and affordable. Nice neighborhood within walking distance to good restaurants and centrally located for trips to other Seattle areas. Comfortable, relaxing, and clean. Perfect for us."
942490,34945399,2015-06-14,3510296,Mihwa,"Lisa's place was lovely. I was a little worried because I was booking for a family of five, coming in from all over the country, but in addition to the private bedroom she had one full/queen and one twin size air mattress set up. The living area was cozy and cute, and it had a surprising amount of space for a basement unit. The coffee machine was a wonderful touch and helped out for those early morning airport visits. 

There isn't a door separating the basement unit from the upper floors' living areas, and I hope we weren't too disruptive. Lisa was very responsive over airbnb messaging, but she gave us plenty of privacy. With the company of some very friendly neighborhood cats, it was all and all a very charming place! Thanks, Lisa! "
942490,35280396,2015-06-16,3285356,Peter,"If you're looking for a more private Airbnb experience, you can't do much better than Lisa's. Other than Airbnb messaging, where she was very responsive, Lisa and I didn't have any interaction — which I preferred for this stay.

The space was very clean. I stayed in the bedroom and found the bed incredibly comfortable.

I'm driving around the country with loads of stuff in my car, and was very comfortable leaving my car parked out front with my belongings (i.e. super-safe neighborhood).

As one person it was a bit more costly than I'd like, but if you're a party of more than one, you won't do better than Lisa's!"
942490,35485120,2015-06-19,34062649,Craig,The space was as described - very quiet and well appointed.  Lisa was a great host and I would recommend her house to any fellow travelers.  Thanks for hosting us and thanks for the brownies!
942490,35819580,2015-06-22,7183603,Mary,"We had a great experience at Lisa's place! Access to the house was simple, the space was great for our party of four adults and one child, and the neighborhood is just a quick drive from downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend Lisa's house, especially for small groups because the price is great compared with Seattle area hotels."
942490,36156844,2015-06-25,36447716,Simone,"The room and bathroom were very clean! The proximity to Greenwood avenue is good but definitely a $10-15 Uber/Lyft ride to get to downtown Seattle. 

The host was seen once for a brief second, so if you're looking for minimal to zero interaction it's perfect. The cat is aptly named ""Snuggly"" and pretty much stopped at nothing to get into the room throughout the night (don't leave the window cracked because he knows how to push out the screen and jump in)"
942490,36910889,2015-07-02,11378225,Polly,"Hi Lisa, 
Thanks for sharing your house with us!
It was our first time visited Seattle! Beautiful city, lot of activities to do… Love it!
First time lived in a basement, thought it will be hot without AC, but it cools down quickly at night with two windows, nice! 
First time lived with a cat and found out that they don’t really sleep, they walked around and checked out the guests at night :)
My family and I had a great time and definitely will visit Seattle again!"
942490,37206938,2015-07-05,21370645,Debbie,"We were welcomed to this cool basement apartment with a lovely bowl of fresh fruit.  The place was clean and comfy.  We loved the feel of the neighborhood and felt right at home.  When we requested a certain kind of tea, our hosts graciously went out of their way to procure it for us.  The neighborhood was quiet, although I recommend bringing some earplugs, as there must be a shift worker upstairs, and our first night was somewhat disturbed by this.  I mentioned it to our hosts, and the second night was much better.  They are very responsive to requests and feedback.  I would definitely stay there again."
942490,37747359,2015-07-10,32983718,Ernie,We had a very nice quiet stay in Lisa's basement apartment.  We rarely heard the hosts upstairs.  The basement Apartment was clean and comfortable.  Theocation is within walking distance to greenwood neighborhood center with lots of dining options.  There is also a convenient bus that goes directly downtown Seattle.  We left some toiletries and cable chargers behind.  Lisa found them for us and set them out so we could pick up later.   I recommend staying here.
942490,38027662,2015-07-12,3608890,Alea,"Had a great stay at Lisa's. Plenty of room for my two friends and I. I would definitely recommend her place to anyone, as long as their comfortable with cats. Thanks Lisa!"
942490,38744461,2015-07-18,36354696,Stephanie,"This was our first time using Airbnb so we didn't really know what to expect, but we were very pleasantly surprised. Lovely home, quiet neighborhood. We had a wonderful time staying at Lisa's. There was plenty of room for the four of us and the space felt very welcoming. Great location, close to everything that we wanted to do, there are even many great restaurants and shops within walking distance."
942490,39321300,2015-07-22,37584092,Michael,The place was really spacious as described.
942490,39778776,2015-07-26,13008504,Charity,"We had a great time at Lisa's place and would certainly recommend it. The location is very nice. The house is located in a cute, quiet neighbourhood which made for very relaxed (website hidden)'s also close enough to all the major sights of the city that we got everywhere we needed to in 10-20 min. The beds were comfortable and having the whole basement was very private and homey.  "
942490,40243619,2015-07-29,25802652,Tara,"Nice neighborhood, loved her little garden for eating our meals in, listing was very accurate, Lisa was open and communicative. Kids loved the cats!"
942490,40516749,2015-07-31,38936776,睿,比较满意，很温馨，细节很周到，也有家居感。就是隔音较差，因为是半地下室，一楼的地板声音对楼下较有影响。
942490,41756409,2015-08-09,34479791,Sean,"Had a great stay with Lisa and Seth. The accommodation was welcoming and comfortable. The wifi was a little slow, the street is a little awkward for large vehicles, but no major problems. It is in a nice neighbourhood, and I definitely recommend visiting Chuck's Hop Shop if you stay here."
942490,42357389,2015-08-12,25373454,Len,"Although overall, the stay at Lisa's place was for the most part pleasant, a few adjustments could have made our visit much more enjoyable.

The element which disturbed us the most was the presence of a very large litter box in the laundry room which was directly off the main bedroom/living area.
It was well maintained but we found it disturbing and the fact that the cat came down and meowed for periods was rather annoying too especially in addition to rather loud morning activity by our hosts (who we never met!).  They were most likely just going about their day but due to the acoustics and the way the sound carried as there is no real barrier (apart from a curtain which was open) between our AirBnB quarter and the main living area it appeared.  We were woken each morning very early and at around 9:00 the noise was gone however, it did not make for a calm morning and our sleep was disturbed.

Also like perhaps like many places in the US it was a B&B without the breakfast. Not sure if that is posted somewhere on the site by reservations information. Perhaps I have been spoiled by hosts abroad going the extra mile to be available and helpful.

On another note, there were a few mechanical repairs needing to be done which seemed like oversights, including a lamp in the living room which had a frayed wire and which was surely a hazard when plugging it in.. the bathroom sink drain did not work  and a running toilet that I easily repaired.

On the flip side, the beds were good, the location was good for us and the parking was available ON the street... 

Improvements were also made from prior guest comments it seemed.

"
942490,42839015,2015-08-16,32995515,Heather,There was plenty of free parking and the home was easy to find. The area of the home we stayed in was clean and inviting. We had enough privacy. Nothing negative to say. 
942490,43516356,2015-08-20,13137796,Ellie,"Lisa’s place was perfect for my family of four. There was plenty of room for all of us. It was nice having a little refrigerator for leftover meals, and handy being able to use the laundry facilities. The neighborhood is darling, and it is an easy walk to Greenwood Avenue with plenty of restaurants to choose from."
942490,44475153,2015-08-26,41403106,Megan,"We had a lovely time - Thank you Lisa! Traveling with a toddler, I was anxious about our first airbnb experience. The space was comfortable and welcoming and we felt safe and secure. We had a cuddly visit from the resident cat and the most comfortable nights' sleep of our whole trip."
942490,44694699,2015-08-28,31494639,Christie,"Lisa's airBnB was very homely, clean and spacious. The beds were comfortable, and it was nice to have hot chocolate and various types of tea provided. We also enjoyed the pet cat's hospitality! "
942490,44934258,2015-08-30,13203771,Matthew,"Lisa was very responsive to my questions and the check in was very smooth. The place was clean and accommodated three of us comfortably. The beds were very comfortable and came with lots of pillows, which I like. The bathroom and shower was also clean and came with towels, wash clothes and little soaps.
The location was ideal, easy trip to Ballard, Fremont or Phinney and really close to Chucks Hop Shop."
942490,45515656,2015-09-03,12582788,Beth,"Lisa's Airbnb space is very comfortable, cosy and has lots of thoughtful additions. We only met Lisa very briefly but communication was always excellent online. The neighbourhood is lovely and we really enjoyed exploring it and trying out some places to eat. "
7050534,37249849,2015-07-05,23115143,Deb,"Unfortunately we not able to meet our hosts. They were on vacation,  but Joel was great about communicating all the instructions prior and we were confident about being able to find the place and get in. The place was exactly how the listing stated, and is in a great neighborhood. Access to the bus stop was quick and easy, and not far to downtown Seattle. Joel made is feel welcome and comfortable. The bed was super awesome and we slept incredibly well! Highly recommend staying here! :)"
7050534,38903670,2015-07-19,37185230,Kelly,"My stay in Magnolia at Joel Sutliff's beautiful apartment was very enjoyable.  He was very welcoming, the apartment was clean and organized and he left us a yummy breakfast treat.  I would definitely stay with Joel again. Thanks for a great stay!  He made it very easy to pick up and drop off keys as well as made us feel welcome in Seattle. "
7050534,41830723,2015-08-09,17220243,Erik,"From beginning to end our host was super communicative & accommodating. We had never explored Seattle before & were happy to find a cozy, clean apt only a stone's throw from lots of eateries, bars, etc. At one point I had a convo with Joel asking for a local laundromat (our clothes were dirty from hiking Mt. Rainier) & he went as far as to let us use his personal laundry card & facilities. Wasn't expecting that kind of hospitality! His place was as described & directions were easy to follow. Not a single negative thing to say, even if I tried. Would definitely stay again if I revisit."
8568567,51210716,2015-10-18,45606910,Ric,"Julio was a great host. He was very welcoming and knowledgeable about the city and responsive to anything needed.  A nice apartment in an awesome downtown location and was within walking distance to everything.  Great alternative to staying in expensive, sterile, city hotels! I really enjoyed my stay and would definitely consider again when next in Seattle."
8568567,54999709,2015-11-27,45397215,Jeffrey,The apartment is great! Julio is vey nice and a great host.
8568567,56871266,2015-12-19,45397215,Jeffrey,Julio was available and accommodating. The place was perfect and in the middle of great shopping and my job location. It was a great experience.

"
9034515,57937830,2015-12-30,21945416,Michelle,"Laila & Luke's North Beach Studio Cottage was great. We came here with the intention of finding great craft beer and delicious food, and we found it -- right in the cottage! They were so thoughtful over the holidays and went so far as sharing a bottle of their favorite IPA with us. They even left us a chocolate bar as a snack, and had a carton of egg nog in the fridge (which we did not get around to enjoying). We enjoyed our time here in Seattle and loved how quiet and easily accessible the neighborhood was. Parking was never an issue, and were very comfortable in our little cottage thanks to the 2 heaters! Laila & Luke were diligent in providing all necessary toiletries, should you forget them at home. The kitchen was stocked, and the bathroom was filled with everything you may need. "

1961671,23374852,2014-11-30,22666706,Joseph,"Sasha and Alex were fantastic hosts!

I spent a weekend in their lovely home and was not disappointed. The house was very clean and provided enough room for everyone that stayed.

They were very helpful in providing information on local entertainment and tourist attractions. Their home was a 10 min cab away from the heart of downtown so it was very convenient for us. The neighborhood looked very nice and felt safe. 

I would definitely recommend their home for anyone planning a trip to Seattle."
1961671,24410982,2014-12-28,1705214,Amber,Great place; great location. Wonderful house to spend a quiet family Christmas. Good dining/coffee options within walking distance and easy access to downtown via bus. The house is beautiful and well maintained. The whole experience was great!

Sasha did everything she could to make the home inviting and had anticipated everything we would need to know about the house (loved her sticky notes all over telling us where things were!).  We took care of her two cats while there, which was an added bonus for us!  The neighborhood is great with coffee shops, boutiques and restaurants within walking distance.  We took Bus #3 to downtown area as well as to catch the light rail to the airport.  Wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks Sasha and Alex!"
1961671,27536443,2015-03-07,5538943,Jana & Jay,"Wow! What a fabulous house and excellent hosts. the cats made me feel right at home :) 

Sasha and Alex provided everything we needed and explained everything clearly. The house was more than big enough, I highly recommend it for a couple of couples or a family. Lots of space, light, clean, well-stocked, and in a super cute neighborhood. Street parking was easy and we could walk to the cute bakery around the corner for latte and pastries. Thank you for sharing your beautiful home with us! "
1961671,33092655,2015-05-25,29765589,Jessica,"My sisters and I stayed here with my young baby for a weekend trip to Seattle. Sasha was very easy to communicate with from the beginning and the house was exactly what we had hoped for. The rooms were all very comgortsble and cozy, the kitchen is perfect if you want to cook and the dining area is just beautiful. We spent our evenings sitting in the front room chatting, however, there is a super cozy basement living room if you want to watch a movie and relax that way instead.  The neighborhood is darling and the local restaurants and shopping areas were so charming. Sasha was kind enough to leave us a list of things to do and places to see, which was so helpful with choosing where to eat, etc. We fell in love with her home, the neighborhood and the weather and cannot wait to come back. I would definitely stay here again. "
1961671,39911558,2015-07-27,30224653,Eileen,"This house was lovely. Very clean and more than enough room for 4 people. Beautiful, quiet neighborhood. Must be prepared to love and care for cats. 15 minute ride from downtown via Lyft. Walking distance to adorable Madrona shops and restaurants. "

1961671,45384006,2015-09-02,1173485,Alissa,"We absolutely loved Sasha's house. I rented the house for my wedding week and had my best friend and sister stay there with me. The place is very spacious and clean and has pretty much anything you'd need. We cooked dinner a few nights, were able to do laundry and not to mention the neighborhood is cute, safe and close to some yummy restaurants. They had a great backyard which I wish I could have used to between being busy with the wedding and the crazy rain, we just admired from the deck. (:  "

9298045,55076762,2015-11-27,49662374,Sami,"Our room was beautiful and very private and quiet. Kristin & John were wonderful hosts and we would definitely stay with them again. The location was great - we could walk to lots of shops and restaurants, and found the area very easy to navigate and get around in. There is a cute coffee shop just a couple blocks away and a beautiful park just a few blocks in the other direction. Awesome area and highly recommended room!"
9298045,57706692,2015-12-28,43815844,Jessy,"Kristin welcomed us personally to help us get settled in, and introduced us to her family, including her sweet golden retriever, Charlie. She had the room stocked with coffees, teas, wine, fruit and muffins. She put a lot of thought into accumulating a list of local restaurants, pubs, pharmacies, grocery stores, beaches and other points of interest within the vicinity and was always available to answer any questions or address any concerns. The neighborhood was central to where we wanted to be on a very well-known street and we had no trouble coming and going. The neighborhood was also quiet and peaceful."
9298045,58218068,2016-01-01,24678902,Nicolas,"Kristin is such a wonderful host! She made this New Year one of our greatest experiences. The room is very clean. The bed is extremely large and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and public transportation is easily accessible. Most importantly, Kristin has been extremely helpful. She promptly gave us detailed guidance on our itineries, and prepared delicious snacks and drinks for us. She even gave us a ride to downtown when we left. So we would definitely recommend Kristin, and would stay with her again if we come back to Seattle. "
43373,77965,2010-08-13,58569,Jenny,"Jenny and Michael are very caring, thoughtful people and their home is beautiful with fantastic views of Lake Union.  Kind of a long walk up to the business area which has lots of restaurants and shops, bus lines are nearby which will take you wherever you want to go and the great Burke Gilman trail is just outside the door.  The bedroom is lovely and peaceful with a great bed.  I liked staying with them very much, I think you will too.
"
43373,81899,2010-08-20,204436,Alex,"Staying with Jenny was fantastic! I couldn't have really asked for more. The space was immaculate and the bed was extremely comfortable. In addition, Jenny was helpful and friendly to us out-of-towners.
 I would recommend staying here to anyone who would like to spend a few nights in a clean, friendly, and nicely located room in Seattle. "
43373,83599,2010-08-23,204866,Sandrine,"We had an amazing stay at Jenny's and Michael's!  They opened their beautiful house to us, our room was beautiful and clean, the bed comfortable (we slept in a lot, it's a proof!) and the bathroom couldn't have been cleaner or nicer.  We enjoyed cooking breakfast in the morning over friendly conversations with everyone and loved the gorgeous view of downtown across Lake Union from the house.  The location is great: close to Fremont, Wallingford and U District, walking distance to many nice places to eat out and have a drink at. Bus lines are a couple blocks away, very easy.  Stay there, you will love it and you will be impressed by Jenny and Michale's kindness! We're looking forward to visiting again."
43373,91358,2010-09-06,206369,Larry,"As I sit here in my empty cottage, watching the low tide on Oyster Bay, I truly miss Jennie, Michael, Sasha and their joyous household. The sounds of siblings Sasha and Sage and their boundless energy just having fun together, meeting guests from Scotland and India (and the surprise pleasure of enjoying a classical raga music concert at Michael's yoga, music and dance studio (OM Culture), a very comfy queen bed and don't forget to try that rocking chair! Jennie and Michael's dining suggestions were excellent (particularly if you are conscious about healthy eating). Their Lake Union/Wallingford neighborhood is a pleasure to walk through, full of both large and small 'craftsman bungalows'(somewhat hilly, though). But the route to Fremont (not to be missed, I wished I had more time to hang out and explore there)runs along the bike path (with a lane for walkers and runners) is flat and runs right by Gasworks Park (unique) with great views of the lakefront and the downtown Seattle skyline (both of which can also be seen from Michael and Jennie's backyard!)I could go on and on, but I think the tides comming in. :)larry h

43373,94823,2010-09-11,16613,Kathy,I really enjoyed my stay with Jenny and her family. The house is in a great location for walking with nice views and good access to shops etc. Jenny and Michael were very friendly and have a nice relaxed atmosphere around the house. The bed was very comfortable and the room spacious.The house was very peaceful as well- a great place to for R&R!
43373,97124,2010-09-14,36051,Bonnie,A wonderful place to stay. They were very friendly and helpful. 
43373,111162,2010-10-04,214295,Lee,"Great family, great home, great room, great stay!!!"
43373,120156,2010-10-16,34865,Janie,Great hosts...comfortable bed and home...Thanks for the great stay in beautiful Seattle.
43373,136041,2010-11-09,235055,Tristen,"Friendly and kind family. Great location when visiting the Seattle area! Bed was comfy, warm room, great conversation. "
43373,139370,2010-11-15,62057,Kendra,"My father in law stayed- very easy, responsive hosts, ideal location."
43373,142367,2010-11-21,207691,Sally,"Couldn' t have imagined a better stay. Warm hospitality, comfortable room, relaxed happy environment. Wonderful coincidences. Highly recommended!"
43373,145150,2010-11-27,275395,Jenny,"I enjoyed meeting Jenny & Michael Pell & their young son. 
The guest quarters (bdrm & bath) are right off the family's kitchen, separated only by a thin curtain, so are not exclusively private, but it works. I was visiting family nearby so was gone all day every day & only spent nights at the Pells. 

Unfortunately my visit coincided w/ a freak snowstorm & extreme cold snap (for Seattle!), and the guest room was very cold the entire time. Thermostat in bdrm didn't seem to have any effect; therm. in bathrm worked very well & compensated but I could only stay in there so long! I did mention the temp. in the bedroom & Jenny provided me w/ an extra down comforter, but as it was, I still needed 3 blankets along w/ that -- & a parka if I wanted to read in bed! Aside from that, the quarters were clean & reasonably spacious, and I enjoyed my stay."
43373,156254,2010-12-20,302219,Mirei,"I spent with my friend and it was enough space for 2 people. There was a slide door between kitchen, so we did not notice noises when we close the door. We could adjust room temperature, and they were willing to help us when we asked. The light in the room could be adjusted from very bright to dim. Toilet paper and towels was provided, but tissue and shampoo & conditioner should have brought. The only thing I noticed was dirty dishes and things on the dining table for a few days, but you can ask if you want them to be cleaned. The house was 3 blocks from the bus station and many blocks from grocery stores.
My friend went out with the family and she said it was a really good experience. You can choose how much you want to get involved with them because I went out most of the time but it was OK for them, too. Thank you!"
43373,182521,2011-02-15,273883,Stanislav,"Jenny, Michael and their son Sascha - are the best hosts you can dream of. Not only the room they offer is absolutely amazing, as well as the whole house and the neighborhood, their attitude is so warm and so sincere, that once moved in, you will never want to move out. I really miss you people! Just take care and all the best for you. "
43373,192177,2011-03-04,389113,Kay,"Jenny and Michael are lovely, warm and welcoming - they are superb hosts and I recommend them wholeheartedly!"
43373,194411,2011-03-08,298362,Patrick,"We had a great time.  Our hosts were very accommodating with our late arrivals and early mornings.  They also demonstrated much grace when our rental car alarm malfunctioned and went off for three hours, disturbing the entire neighborhood.  Really a wonderful stay in a very nice area within walking distance from Gas Works Park.  They are a very nice very easy-going family."
43373,228129,2011-04-16,170359,Matthew,"I had a great stay at Jenny's warm, welcoming home. The house was clean, centrally located and very comfortable. But the best part of my stay was probably her delicious chocolate chip cookies =)"
43373,269228,2011-05-18,455186,Lydia,I stayed with Jenny and her family for a month. They were absolutely fabulous and made me feel completely at home. Their home has a very laid back atmosphere and I loved spending time with them. 
43373,298052,2011-06-05,486294,Canna,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for two weeks and Jenny and Michael were amazing hosts! The room was extremely spacious, and the house was bright and cheery. The neighbourhood was great as well; you could see Lake Union from the backyard and Gas Works Park was only a short walk away. Would definitely stay there again!"
43373,304653,2011-06-08,654427,Jennifer,Jenny was nice and very accommodating.  We enjoyed our time here and would stay there again.
43373,312549,2011-06-13,598042,Arnon,"Private room, great shared living space with great view.  Parking is easy.  Literally minutes from downtown and Northridge.  Jenny and Michael are great people and I would love to come stay with them again."
43373,345428,2011-07-01,524518,Kirsten,"I had a great time with Jenny, Michael and Sascha - they were fascinating to talk to and all around wonderful hosts!  I know where I'll be staying the next time I'm in Seattle! :)"
43373,357305,2011-07-06,283254,Erin,"I knew this was a great location, so I booked two different stays on the same trip (staying additional nights after coming back from visiting other parts of the state) - a fantastic decision.  Read my previous review for more info.  "
43373,360780,2011-07-08,725215,Anne,"My 2 1/2 year old son and I were warmly welcomed into the home of Jenny, Michael and Sacha.  They all went out of their way to make us feel at home and to help us in any way they could.  There home was comfortable and near everything that we needed.  My son played with Sacha and Michael & Jenny gave us great directions to local attractions, shops and eateries.  The proximity to Gas Works park was also a blessing with my young son.  Highly recommend, especially if you have kids! "
43373,364675,2011-07-10,283254,Erin,"This was a fantastic find on Airbnb - the house is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood with a view of both Lake Union and the skyline.  It's close to Gas Works Park and is within access by bus (4 blocks) to downtown and other neighborhoods.  It's really a fantastic location.  Jenny and family are kind, friendly, intelligent, and flexible - it was a pleasure to meet them.  Jenny was very willing to share tips about what to do or where to go.  

FYI: I remember reading one review before staying that said the room was not private.  From that review - yes, there is a curtain separating the room from the rest of the house, but there is also a pocket door, making the room private.  
:)"
43373,373204,2011-07-14,769878,Gail,"Great location, great hosts. Jenny & Michael welcomed us into their home as if we were family."
43373,381127,2011-07-18,460091,Ayanjyoti,"Jenny is a great host. I was in Seattle visiting friends for the weekend, and I stayed over at their place. I had my own bedroom and bathroom, and I was also given my own privacy. Overall, I had a great time. If I would be travelling back to Seattle, I would definitely consider her as a host again. "
43373,408122,2011-07-31,599381,Alessandro,"As we first arrive in US for our summer vacation the first place we have been is in Seattle with Jenny e Michael.
We had a great welcome and a lot of help to get around. They were very helpufull with indication and let  us feel to be home. 
The space was really confortable and full of light.
Alessandro and Gabriele"
43373,422940,2011-08-06,399978,Bob & Martha,"This is a great location. You are close to the Freemont and Wallingford neighborhoods and the Burke-Gilman bike trail. 
It's a reasonable price for Seattle. Jenny was out of town, but Michael is a great host. "
43373,433272,2011-08-09,904165,Sarah,"I loved staying here! Aside from the nice big room and private bathroom, Jenny and Michael were wonderfuls hosts. I felt very welcomed and comfortable, and the energy of there home felt very light. They also have an amazing view from their sunroom , which I got to enjoy my dinner in front of at sunset one evening. I highly recommend! 
"
43373,440847,2011-08-13,704584,Dr Phil And Linda,"Its simple, very pleasant and clean with a GREAT bed....Jenny and her husband are laid back and gracious but leave the guests to themselves unless they need something....their son was quiet (hardly knew he was there).....its near to neighborhood shopping and coffee shops for breakfast...great view and private....would stay with again without question..."
43373,470975,2011-08-23,985333,Jenn,"Jenny, Michael, and Sascha were really great hosts. They made us feel welcome, but also gave us space. The location of their home made our trip extremely enjoyable. They are literally one block from the Burke-Gilman trail which links many neighborhoods by a paved carless greenway for bikes and pedestrians. We ditched the car and cycled everywhere. So much fun cycling to Magneson park for a dip in Lake Washington and then stopping along the way home for cool drinks and snacks. PCC is also on the Burke-Gilman in Freemont so it's easy to get groceries to cook up dinner in Jenny and Michael's spacious kitchen. Also on bikes you can quickly get to downtown by crossing the Freemont bridge and taking Dexter most of the way there to avoid heavy traffic. Takes about 30 minutes and no worry about trying to find parking! Thanks for the great stay!"
43373,552035,2011-09-20,1135408,Eric,"I had a great time staying here! Everything was perfect! The hosts are very nice, the bed is comfortable and the location is convenient. I highly recommend this room!
 "
43373,564800,2011-09-25,721195,Giusy,"i had a great time at the house.
the room is absolutely great, super confi bed.
jenny and michael and little sasha are so welcoming and helpful. 
the house is located in such a beautiful area in seattle, near green lake and fremont, safe and full of lovely walks.
was great to chat in the morning and evening about the day, made me feel really at ease.
so enjoyed it, i hope i ll see them again

"
43373,589881,2011-10-02,29058,Charley,"Jenny was a pleasant host, and the room was comfortable. It was very quiet, and coming and going was easy. The location is excellent, just a block to a long trail for walking, biking, or running. The water bed was a surprise, having not slept on one since the '80s -- I slept well. The WiFi worked great."
43373,626106,2011-10-13,1176526,Jim,"Jenny and and Michael  are very gracious and friendly hosts and my brief stay in their house met all my expectations.  I may not have met all their expectations as the perfectly socially-oriented guest, as I went out early in the morning and returned late at night, but I appreciated the privacy they afforded and having a wonderfully convenient place to stay. The private room, just off the kitchen allowed me to come and go without disturbing the family and I found the bed very comfortable for sleeping. Jenny had a couple of good recommendations for coffee and breakfast in the neighborhood that I took advantage of as well.  I would definitely recommend a stay here for independent travelers who want a comfortable, centrally located situation."
43373,660871,2011-10-24,1303723,Jasmin,"Fantastic experience!  Large,  clean and private space to relax in.  Great kitchen, laundry, wifi, really nice and helpful hosts.  Jenny helped me get oriented with the city and fun things to do my first night.  Her and her family were very welcoming and made me feel at home.   They also gave me the space and privacy that needed.  So glad that I stayed here!"
43373,684085,2011-11-01,1291699,Connie,"This big sunny home is EXACTLY as described!   After having a horrible experience with another property on airbnb, Jenny was able to accommodate me on very short notice.  The home in Wallingford has lots of windows and a very welcoming warm atmosphere.

I was here to assist one of my children who is ill -- so my time varied between being gone all day and being home some of the day.  Jenny and her family encouraged me to ""make myself at home"" and use other rooms in their home, as well as having my daughter visit when needed.

There is plenty of privacy here with the room and full bathroom for a guest.  The bedroom also has a large window with lots of light.  I was also able to store food in the fridge, make my coffee and breakfast in the morning; several days I also had lunch and dinner at home.

I would love to be a guest at this lovely home again!"
43373,736872,2011-11-22,556638,Stephanie,"What a great stay!  The house is VERY convenient to bus routes, the bike trail, and restaurants, coffeshops (A Muddy Cup is great!), etc. just a short walk up Corliss Avenue to 45th street.  I was there for two weeks on a research trip so, unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to interact much with Jenny and her family (which is a shame because they were SO nice and welcoming!  They invite me to events, to go grocery shopping with them, parties, etc.).  The space was perfect (and private, as there is a pop-out door) for me:  quiet and comfortable.  I guess from other review ,the room can get cold, but I was there in the middle of a very cold snap, and I was more than comfortable (plus, Jenny always double-checked to see if I needed anything or if I needed another spac heater, so don't feel like you can't ask for something if you need it).  Great experience overall!"
43373,754676,2011-11-29,1418641,Xiaohui,"We did enjoy our 8 days and nights staying  with Jenny and Michael and their lovely son Sacha at the Big sunny home. A really happy family， nice and kind. The location  is great, a lot of conveniece.  
"
43373,785945,2011-12-14,1434529,Joanna,"Jenny and her family were a delight to stay with.  They were warm and welcoming and such lovely people!  Their home is located in a beautiful neighbourhood with views of the lake down the hill and is walking distance to several bus lines making it a convenient place to stay while exploring the city (even if you're relying on public transit.)
December in Seattle is cold, but they were ready with extra blankets and gave us control over the thermostat in our room so that we could stay comfy cozy.  The bed was SUPER comfortable (kinda didn't want to get up in the morning!) and we were able to get some excellent rest at night.  Jenny's four year old is a delight to hang out with and he was often surprising us with wild and wonderful stories and science lessons (very charming!)  but other than that, he was as quiet as a mouse and never disturbed us.  
The one thing that helped me the most was that they were able to arrange a ride to the airport for me on my departure day - this was above and beyond what I would have expected and I was enormously thankful for their generous help which saved me from bussing to the train station downtown with all my luggage in tow.  What a blessing! 
This is a lovely family and I hope you get the chance to meet them! "
43373,837296,2012-01-04,813269,Richard,"Jenny and Michael were perfect hosts. Totally accommodating and very chilled about my comings and goings. I always felt welcomed. Location is great, with 45th Street a 12 minute walk in one direction and the Gasworks 12 minutes in the other. Regular bus service to downtown as well as easy on street parking, so no transportation hassles. The room is nice, clean and with a dedicated bathroom, very convenient. I was skeptical when I heard I'd be sleeping on a waterbed, but I was surprised at how comfy it really was. Slept very well. Highly recommended. Almost 5 YO Sasha is a precocious treat. I will gladly stay with Jenny and Michael again.  
"
43373,853624,2012-01-09,1551781,Liz,"Nice folks, cool house and great neighborhood - easy access to so many great things. Only regret is our time in the area was so short!"
43373,864153,2012-01-15,1483195,Lane,Extremely beautiful home in an extremely beautiful neighborhood.  Jenny and her family were welcoming and friendly but also allowed for plenty of privacy.  
43373,925453,2012-02-16,1671079,Alan,"Jenny and Michael are wonderful people, don't pass up a chance to stay with them if you're in Seattle. They live in a great location and in a beautiful home full of positive energy."
43373,989300,2012-03-11,1853920,Sungsoo,"I spent fantastic week at Jenny's house. The room and bathroom was clean and ample. Actually I had no experience about Seattle, but Jenny and her family helped me a lot. The atmosphere of house was really friendly. I appreciate for everything.

""싸샤도 잘 지내지요? ^^"
43373,1041134,2012-03-25,620277,Robin,The location was wonderful with views of Lake Union. The room was clean and quiet. The hosts were gracious and easy to be around. I definitely recommend staying here!
43373,1230460,2012-05-05,2037072,John,"Thanks Jenny & Mike & Sacha for your hospitality, charm, and friendliness. Because of you, my in-town vacation stay was a huge success for my purposes. The Big Sunny House was even better than described. That row of glass windows in the picture is actually one side of their sun room which warms up with just a hint of sun. The view in any weather is captivating.  

Room for Airbnb guests had adequate privacy with a sliding door. Good closet and dresser space. WIFI access worked. And a water bed! Plus, I was able to keep my bike locked and out of the rain in the shed. 

Very convenient to the Burke-Gilman Trail and public transportation. About 10 blocks away on 45th Avenue are many places to eat. 

Totally recommended. "
43373,1250384,2012-05-08,396751,Pat,"A really nice stay -- I felt so welcome in this comfortable home, and loved being back in one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. "
43373,1313432,2012-05-21,1585449,Mandy,"Enjoyed my stay.Large, spotless airy bedroom with dedicated (email hidden)s very friendly and I was made to feel at  home  which was great!
 A 5 minute walk to the bus stop.Affordable rates too.I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
43373,1353098,2012-05-26,2384111,Liv,"This house is indeed big, sunny, and near everything! We used this as a launching point for our housing search in Seattle, as we were relocating from LA. It was perfect for this, and even inspired us to rent a place with a solarium! The hosts are kind and accommodating, and their home is light-filled and warm with a wonderful view of the city. We even got an impromptu piano recital (Beatles, of course) from their adorable 5 year-old son. "
43373,1428538,2012-06-06,1266882,Cindy,"When I was ready to leave Jenny's home I felt like I was leaving my own family.....they were so at ease, welcoming me into their rich lives of gardening, yoga, and nourishing their enchanting son. My room and bath were big and light, and I slept very well on the waterbed. Coffee in the morning overlooking Lake Union was a pure delight and walking the neighborhood is full of the richness of daily life and bike path activities. I would love to return to stay with Jenny and her family and will recommend their place to friends going to Seattle."
43373,1468239,2012-06-12,2335579,Maureen,"Super experience for my sister-in-law who stayed here while visiting Seattle.  Home is cozy and comfortable, close to most everything interesting, and very welcoming.  Would stay again!"
43373,1491200,2012-06-16,1646320,Tim,"My stay with Jenny and Michael was great. I was out visiting my son in Seattle who couldn't put me up (he has 3 roommates who didn't want an old guy hanging with them).  I mostly just slept at Jenny's ...  out early in the morning and back late at night.

I hade a nice big room with a chair and footrest. Nice for doing early morning work on my computer. 

The Wallingford neighborhood is great ... full of craftman style homes for the 20's and 30s and a nice shopping/eating district a mile up the hill at 45th street (you get your exercise BEFORE you eat and drink, then it is all downhill back to Jenny's!) 

I really liked the location and would stay there again.
"
43373,1517774,2012-06-19,2493657,Barry,"A Wonderful place to stay on a visit to Seattle. Jenny and Michael make it easy to feel comfortable and at home.They are helpful and inclusive. Even though I was busy, I  am glad I took their  invitation to a dance at their nearby studio on my last night.  It was  fun and really gave me an inside view and feel  of both  the people and spirit of Seattle.  
Thanks, Barry"
43373,2091190,2012-08-25,1974052,Denise,"The location was very convenient for our stay.  Our hosts were very friendly, but we did not see them much as our time in their home was very limited.   We were not aware our bed would be a water bed on the floor.  Also, the homeowners were currently needing repairs to their private bath, so they shared ours.  A little more attention to the cleanliness of the bathroom was needed."
43373,2126445,2012-08-28,3156331,Matt,A friend and I stayed with Jenny for a weekend trip to Seattle.  She and her family were great hosts.  The home is in an absolutely wonderful location (and has a great view of the city!).  Jenny also pointed us to some great local joints for coffee and food.  
43373,2140926,2012-08-30,2139462,Barbara & Matthias,Our stay with Jenny was nice - even though we only got to see her partner who organized everything while she was out of town. The house is a good location to start a trip to downtown Seattle as the bus stop is just around the corner and the trip time is just right. What is more - you get an excellent view of the Seattle skyline when sitting on the patio.
43373,2170066,2012-09-02,1198413,Mike,"We wanted insight into communnity living in Seattle, fun, environmental awareness, savvy business people and time with people that care. We got all that and more with Michael, Jenny and chilldren. Really thoughtful and caring people who made time in their busy schedules to help us get aroud seattle, gave us lifts when they could and involved us in their activities and even set a garden party for our last night. The room is large, the house is comfortable and the views are across water towards the busy routes into town. 
We absolutely loved this stay and loved our hosts even more."
43373,2209089,2012-09-05,2302396,Kristin,"Jenny And Michael are super relaxed hosts! That was my first airbnb experience and it was a perfect start: beautiful house with a view on the lake, nice big room, great food (especially the homemade fudge-thing!!!) and some really interesting talks with a cup of coffee on the deck in the morning sun. 
They were absolutely helpful with reommendations of what to do in seattle and even took me to one of these great farmers markets.
For hose who don't have a car: no problem. The next bus stop is only a few blocks away!
I would come back!"
43373,2237858,2012-09-09,1198413,Mike,"As we stayed twice with Michael and Jenny, we have this second review slot. We were able to leave some luggage at Michael and Jennys place, whilst we went up to vancouver. Then we were back again. And we will go back again, anytime we were vaguely near Seattle."
43373,2362047,2012-09-21,3326728,Yuan,"First, they are very kind and nice, when i got sick they took me to the hall health and really take care of me, and when i stay there just like stay in my own house, it's really a unforgetable experience.thank you mike and jenny so much !!!!!!!!!!
it's really a big sunny house, you can see the lake in their yard, and the location also very near a beautiful park and some restaurant. and the room for guest is really comfortable, big, and it's a bright and spacopus room. "
43373,2405022,2012-09-25,2145794,Alessandro,"Absolutely great! Only two days but  enough to understand how fantastic the owner Michael is... (Jenny was out because of her job...A pity I didn't met her) And the kids, very friendly, I played Jahtzee with Sasha (almost 6 years old)...He is clever than me...:)
What about the house? Nice location, little bit far from the italian style I'm used to but very characteristic... It looks like the artist's house and maybe it is...
It is clean and always sunny; ther are a lot of big windows!
Definitely I reccomend this family and this house!
Bye bye guys take care, and thanks for the special dinner, the bachelor's one!:) "
43373,2433999,2012-09-28,2169272,Peter,"Though we had to face a delay at the airport, Jenny and Michael gave us a warm welcome. In the morning they offered us a slice of their homemade bread and a nice cup of coffee. The accomodation is very good, the neigbourhood quiet and downtown easily to reach. We did it by car. In our room there were several guides of sightseeing and maps. In sort it was good to stay with the family and we wouls like to give this address to our friends.
Thanks and cheers. Peter and Jeannette Vanthof"
43373,2481510,2012-10-02,872909,Thea,"We had a great time at the big sunny house near everything and recommand it to everybody who like to stay with nice, friendly people in Seattle."
43373,2703188,2012-10-24,2671766,Jason,"Jenny was very friendly and welcoming. I definitely felt at home staying at the big sunny house, which is indeed near everything --- only half a block away from the Burke-Gilman Trail and leads to Gasworks Park, University of Washington, Fremont, and all places that I wanted to visit on this trip.  Very clear communication prior to arrival to make sure I get to the big house!"
43373,2943798,2012-11-22,1090241,Betty,"Jenny, Michael and Sacha were really great hosts! They were welcoming, friendly and it was fascinating getting to know them! The room was very spacious, clean, in a quiet neighborhood and close to all sorts of attractions in Seattle. Easy to get around, and you get a great view of the city once you step out! Would definitely recommend!"
43373,2969695,2012-11-26,4051888,Leslie,"A lovely, and VERY comfortable place to stay in a convenient location.   Jenny, Michael and their son were so welcoming and fun. We enjoyed  them and would love to stay with them again."
43373,3004131,2012-12-01,75330,Agnieszka,"Jenny and Michael are very nice, welcome hosts. Our room was clean and spacious. We could use kitchen and feel like at home. Thank you for a ginger cake and home made drink treat!"
43373,3025451,2012-12-04,93638,Katrine,"I had a wonderful stay with Jenny and Michael in their well located and charming house. The room was comfortable, and they were warm and helpful and flexible. The neighborhood is wonderful, centrally located with a nice view of the skyline and many interesting things close by."
43373,3043220,2012-12-08,3377742,Doug,"Greatly enjoyed my stay.  The room is off the kitchen with a bathroom available right off the room.  Their home has great views.  Jenny and Michael were easily accessible and welcoming, providing much info about the local neighborhood.  Irwin's coffee is a nice coffee shop to go to if you are on East coast time (opens at 6)."
43373,3125787,2012-12-20,2886970,Wray,"We found Jenny's room just as described.  Jenny greeted us and made us entirely welcome, introducing us to her family.  The kitchen was available for our use.  The location was perfect for what we needed to do.  Parking was readily available on the street in front of her home.  The bed, I think, is a waterbed and was very comfortable.  The only distraction was the weather which was quite cold; the single room heater warmed the room very slowly.  And, or course, we only ""looked"" at the grand back yard.  The bathroom was excellent with a vigorous shower.  We would definitely recommend this room to others!"
43373,3200744,2012-12-31,2836212,Eliot,"I loved the place, very cute, great neighborhood. It was the perfect amount of space for my girlfriend and I on a three day stay. The bed was very comfortable. Very close to the bus lines, we were easily and quickly able to reach all our destinations in the city from this location. Jenny was a great host. She was very friendly and flexible. Other folks at the house were also very nice. She gave great information and explanations. Recommended. "
43373,3271293,2013-01-04,131977,Marcus,"Jenny, Michael, and their adorable son warmly welcomed us into their home. We enjoyed the East Asian decor of their home, its natural light, and the waterfront views. Our large bedroom was a good spot to relax & unwind after the rush of the Christmas season. Although, we were a bit surprised regarding privacy. Our ""private bathroom"" was actually being used by the hosts during our stay.  A bit more clarity on the use of space would be great for future guests.  Nevertheless, grateful for our stay!"
43373,3327518,2013-01-11,4404273,Anger,"Jenny, Michael and Sacha were great. My friend and I enjoyed our stay at the house. They made us feel so welcomed, helping us adapt to a different life here in Seattle. So thankful we had stayed at their house and met them. : ) "
43373,3354118,2013-01-15,509441,Ryan,"Jenny (and the rest of the family) were great hosts. We were only around sporadically during a whirlwind weekend in Seattle, but the time we did spend in the house was pleasant. Our room was nice and a great location for access to Wallingford, Fremont, Ballard, etc."
43373,3371589,2013-01-19,4435327,Margret,"I had a wonderful stay and was most grateful for the comfort and generosity Jenny provided.   Would love to come again, and stay longer next time!"
43373,3484914,2013-02-05,4612878,Vanessa,"As a first time airbnb user and new to Seattle, I could not have asked for a more positive experience!  Jenny’s place is very central within Seattle.  The house on a quiet street but close to the lake, a bus to the city center and 15-minute walk to Fremont.  The room and bathroom were clean, private and a cozy space to come back to after being out in the cold Seattle weather.  Jenny and her family are very warm and welcoming.  I would recommend this place and stay again if I am back in the city!"
43373,3539491,2013-02-14,4623249,Leandro,"Mi experiencia en la casa de Jenny Pell fue fantástica, estuve realmente cómodo, la habitación es amplia y el baño siempre muy limpio.
   "
43373,3588565,2013-02-19,5003208,Nicolas,"Awesome stay! The room was large, the bathroom was clean, and the hosts were very hospitable. Jenny and Michael were nice enough to set up the bed with an electric blanket and a small space heater than proved invaluable for Texans in Seattle during February. "
43373,3710017,2013-03-06,4506634,Alice,"Jenny and Michael really opened their home and family to me during my stay and I felt comfortable and cared for.  They were very generous and included me in some of the day to day and special events that took place while I was there. The room was private and the bed super comfy!  
I will definitely use them as a home base on my future trips to Seattle!
Thanks Jenny and Michael!"
43373,4146553,2013-04-14,4934056,Tom,"Great first experience trying AirBnB. Jenny and Michael not only opened their home to me they included me in their family. I had dinner with them several times. Jenny's work at home has opened my mind to adapting some permaculture into my life at home. We played music together with everyone joining in with an instrument. Sasha is a remarkable kid and a joy to be around. 
If you are friends with Bill W, as am I, you can easily find a whole group of friends a short walk away at the yacht club. ;-)
I stayed in the Big Sunny House for four weeks while attending school. It was so comfortable and convenient for me. 10 min from class and really close to a very attractive community of markets, eateries, bars and clubs, as well as the world famous Seattle sights. Stay with Jenny, Michael, and Sasha. You won't be sorry."
43373,4326664,2013-04-28,5760489,Laura,"Jenny and Michael were wonderful hosts and lovely people. When I arrived everything was set up (clean sheets, towels, etc.) and as expected. They were very generous and helpful and easy to get along with. I would happily return. "
43373,4434723,2013-05-05,3001431,Megan,"Jenny and family are very welcoming and easy going. The room is just as described, big and sunny. Everything you'll need in Wallingford is within walking distance, and the house is close to the Burke-Gilman Trail, which provides safe and easy bicycle access to the U-District, Fremont and Ballard. 
Thanks Jenny, Michael, and Sasha for a comfortable home stay!"
43373,4519008,2013-05-10,5525405,Thu-Mai,"Jenny hosted my parents while they were visiting me. She was out of town during their stay, so we didn't meet a lot. But Jenny has been very very welcoming. She let my parents full use of the common parts of the house (kitchen, sun room, etc...) and they really felt at home during their entire stay. Besides, the house is extremely well located! Thanks a lot Jenny for your kindness!"
43373,4575929,2013-05-13,3832455,Farhan,"I had a Vary good time staying at the Big sunny house near everything.  my purposes was to be near UW . Big sunny house near everything is  the place to be.  My  purpose was to Visit My Daughter. 
I Could Visit my daughter any time when she had no class.I could walk any time I wanted to see her. 
it is a great place to be if u have any kind of business in UW. area.

"
43373,4718193,2013-05-21,6204750,Lisa,Jenny and Michael are really good people.  They have a great sense of community and make you feel very welcome in their home.  The room and private bath were very comfortable and I'd definitely stay here again and recommend this to friends!
43373,4814665,2013-05-27,341922,Ernie,Jenny and Michael were great hosts.  Their place is convenient to bus routes to the UW and downtown and the Burke Gilman bike trail is two blocks away.  We came for Folklife Festival at Seattle Center and it was a easy 20 minute bus ride.  The queen water bed was comfortable and warm.  It was great to talk with them over morning coffee about their interests in permaculture and building community.  We would definitely stay with them again.
43373,4867591,2013-05-29,6146802,Stephan,"Great hosts, great stay. Met all my expectations and I had my two young sons in tow who got along great with their six year old.  I am definitely coming back."
43373,4962314,2013-06-04,5226355,Chris,"Thank you so much Jenny & Michael and your little guy for opening your house to me. They have a great home, beautiful view, great location to bus lines, waterfront walking path, parks, resturants and anything else you might need oh and a VERY comfortable bed. They make you feel so welcome in their home. I have already booked my return trip in August and can't wait to see them all again. 
See you soon."
43373,5267538,2013-06-21,232763,Barbara,"As smooth as can be! Jenny, Michael & Sasha are easy-going & friendly. The room & bathroom are spacious; wi-fi worked fine. The set-up was great for my needs (i.e., returning to the house after being out all day--plenty of street parking!--and then holing up in the bedroom & working on my computer, w/ occasional forays into the kitchen for tea)....I had to delay my check-in time, & Jenny was very accommodating.  "
43373,5321679,2013-06-24,6671120,Kay,"This was our first experience with airbnb, and it couldn't have been any better! We were in town for the Fremont Solstice Celebration, and for us, Jenny and Michael's home had both the location and energy for a perfect Seattle experience. As hosts, they were warm and welcoming - and it almost felt as though we were there to visit with them rather than explore the city.  "
43373,5470314,2013-07-01,3246625,Laura,"My first Airbnb experience was a stay with Jenny, Michael, and Sacha.  What a delight!  The one potential problem that I can think of is the very high bar set for other Airbnb experiences!  I was warmly welcomed but not fussed over, had as much privacy as I wanted in my room and as much gracious and friendly social interaction when I expressed my interest.  The sense of deep abiding warmth, rootedness to the earth, intellectual curiosity and wisdom to be found here freshened me up with a spark of joy all its own.  What a fabulous bonus to an already great trip!

The neighborhood is great, bus lines are within walking distance, and all the folks I met in Seattle were friendly and upbeat!   Since you are reading this, you are considering a stay with Jenny and Michael, and I highly recommend this choice.  Lovely, Lovely, Lovely, all the way around!  "
43373,5548469,2013-07-05,5590619,Tiina,"Good location. Easy to get to town, with busses it takes about 20 min. Gas Works Park and Fairmont is in walking distance and both places are worth of a visit.
Room was clean and there was lot of storage place for clothes.
Bathroom is next to this room and usually it is only the guest who uses it. There was no breakfast.
Jenny gave me advices how to get to town."
43373,5660005,2013-07-10,956540,Michele,"Lovely experience staying w/ Jenny and her family at their beautiful and spacious home. The room was spacious, clean and relaxing. We didn't see Jenny and her family much since we pretty much left early in the morning and arrived late at night, but we still would've felt very comfortable if we did end up spending more time at the house. Jenny, her family and the space have a calming energy and they are quite unobtrusive and laid back. Location is great, esp. if you are going to UW. Beautiful and central. Bus stops ($2.50 a ride w/ 2 hr. transfer window) are a close 3-block walk on a slight incline, or you can make the one mile walk in about 20 minutes. Hiking/biking trails closeby. Some travelling tips to Seattle: Download OneBusAway to help you planning your bus trips. Look into signing up for Uber (taxi service) and Car2Go (ride sharing) which usually have great promo deals. "
43373,5942543,2013-07-23,6586581,Derek,"Staying with Jenny was great. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, but has great access to the main roads to go off to other parts of Seattle. The room and bathroom were quiet, clean, and the wifi worked fine and was fast. The morning chats  over coffee with Micheal were fun. 

I definitely would stay here again if I'm in the area!"
43373,6152815,2013-08-01,6244698,Frederick,"This was a wonderful experience! We felt very welcomed from the day we arrived, until we left. Jenny's local knowledge helped a great deal, and we were able to travel around Seattle with very little issue. The bedroom was incredibly comfortable, and clean. Overall it was a very fun experience! We only wished we had more time to stay!"
43373,6274817,2013-08-06,5226355,Chris,"Again a great place to stay. Even though we did not see each other very much at all. Did enjoy the cup of coffee and conversation with Michael the last morning. Hopefully I will see you next time Jenny.
"
43373,6323996,2013-08-08,2539117,Graham And Vicki,"When travelling to Seattle, this is the place to stay.  Easy bus access, large sunny room and privacy to come and go as you please"
43373,6456688,2013-08-13,6458694,Mary,The location is ideal and bed was comfy.  Very sweet house in a great neighborhood!
43373,6588999,2013-08-18,5629257,Eunsook,"I love this place! That was really good, calm and cozy so I felt like my home.
And public transportation was great  to go anywhere. 
I really recommend here.  Thanks Jenny!"
43373,6755755,2013-08-24,7183939,Bette,"Our visit to beautiful Seattle was perfect!  We spent 4 nights at Jenny's home, just coming and going as tourists do!  A key was provided and having our own private bathroom with fresh towels, and plenty of closet and drawer space was a definite plus!  The bed was comfortable and the pillows were heavenly.  I enjoyed browsing the available Seattle brochures!   We were able to connect with a bus line by walking about 4 blocks through the Wallinfgford neighborhood, seeing many gardening ideas.  Speaking of gardening - this is the house for you, and Jenny is the host for you - to learn new ideas while vacationing!"
43373,6847424,2013-08-27,7036070,Matt,Jenny and Michael are fantastic hosts that open up their house to their guests! They are so welcoming and friendly you almost feel like a part of their family. Thank you for being so great to stay with!
43373,6910280,2013-08-30,1017302,Bee,"The location is ideal, especially if you have a car to get around. Always nice to be away from hot tourist area. I feel like a local and Jenny's make it easy for me to feel at home. Jenny pointed out that Fremont & N 45th street are two great area for night live. Absolutely love it. Thank you. "
43373,7193946,2013-09-10,2632169,Alicia,I had a restful stay in Michael and Jenny's home.  The room is quiet and comfortable.  My trip required that I have down time which was totally possible... yet I felt comfortable sharing the space and a meal as desired.  I would definitely stay there again. 
43373,7256942,2013-09-13,8329153,Jules,"Very clean, quiet and cozy. We had plenty of space to park on the street.  Pretty awesome view during the day!  Thanks for such a cool first experience on Airbnb."
43373,7327438,2013-09-16,46470,Emmanuelle,"Staying with Jenny, Michael and Sacha was a wonderful experience.
It is a safe, comfortable and welcoming home. They included us in their family life and made us feel at home.  We felt welcomed from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.
It was a perfect environment for us."
43373,7768246,2013-10-02,1685141,Benjamin,"Jenny and Michael were wonderful hosts. The room and bathroom provide a very comfortable living space. But, it's more fun to be out in the beautiful sun room. I stayed here for a couple of weeks while I looked for an apartment upon moving to Seattle. It was the perfect landing pad. They made me feel very at home and welcome."
43373,8107420,2013-10-15,6734641,Justin,"Jenny and her family were wonderful hosts and wonderful people. My wife and I had to check out earlier than planned but she was very accommodating and understanding. The neighborhood is perfect for exploring Seattle while maintaining peace and quiet at night and the views from the back of this house are incredible! Overall a great stay with a warm, welcoming family."
43373,8665079,2013-11-11,2110103,Catherine,Wonderful place to stay. A good mix of warm hospitality and plenty of privacy. Very convenient location in a lovely house. The bed is very warm and comfy. Highly recommended. 
43373,8825888,2013-11-19,1664445,Jarques & Tina,We had the pleasure of staying with Jenny and Michael for a few nights and it was great. Quiet neighborhood with a great view of downtown Seattle. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. They were very accommodating with our late arrival and our late afternoon checkout. It was great!!
43373,8877562,2013-11-23,7075664,Jodi,Jenny and Michael are very thoughtful and welcoming. Their home was convenient and met our needs for our three-night visit. The guest room and private bath were quite comfortable; it was nice to have wi-fi and kitchen access as well.
43373,8996992,2013-12-01,6154393,(email hidden),"Very enjoyable stay with Jenny and Michael.  The room was comfortable and we will definitely go back.  Next time we hope to have more time to enjoy the beautiful, enclosed porch. "
43373,9292285,2013-12-19,7417753,Kate,"I had a great stay at Jenny and Michael's home.  My room was private, quiet and soothing.  I especially loved the bed!  I had been caring for my two month old grandson during the day and was in great need of a good night's sleep and  restoration.  The hosts were very warm and friendly and I felt completely comfortable in their home from the moment I arrived."
43373,9426149,2013-12-28,9802159,Olivia,Both Jenny and Michael are very friend.
43373,9696088,2014-01-05,7075664,Jodi,"We stayed at Jenny's for four nights over New Years. She and Michael were very welcoming and warm, and even let us wash our clothes there. It was a pleasure to meet their amazing son, Sasha, this time! I recommend their home in the wonderful Wallingford district. "
43373,9901078,2014-01-18,6439972,Adam,Everything was great at this house near Gasworks park. Hanging out with Jenny and her family was a lot of fun. The bed was very comfortable. Highly recommended.
43373,9983136,2014-01-23,266837,Naomi & Victor,"I had a great stay at Jenny and Michael's house. When I first arrived I immediately felt comfortable and enjoyed my conversation with Jenny. However, because they left for a trip the day after my arrival, I ended up having the whole house to myself for 3 days. Although I enjoyed my time, especially the incredible view from the sun room, I'm sure I would have also thoroughly enjoyed my stay if the family had been there. My room was very comfortable and had everything I needed. I would definitely stay again."
43373,11421064,2014-04-01,9930163,Sandra,"Booking a stay with Jenny and her family is like staying at your own extended family's place - The room itself was spacious and warm and the neighborhood is very walkable to all the wonderful things in Wallingford! As an added bonus, I had a chance to play on the trampoline for the first time in my life. A great and comfy stay."
43373,11727807,2014-04-13,6439972,Adam,"This was my second stay at the big sunny house. This trip I was constantly working so I unfortunately didn't really get to hang out, but, like last time, the bed was comfortable and the place was perfect for me. Recommended."
43373,12989951,2014-05-16,8444387,Hossein,I had a pleasant stay at Michael's. I had a spacious room. The tenants were really nice. The place had a yard with a view of the lake which was really good for relaxing.
43373,13676641,2014-06-02,12966966,Henry,"It was great! Michael and his housemates had the perfect balance of friendly, helpful and uninvasive. His house is clean, comfortable and has a PERFECT location in a calm, safe, beautiful neighborhood right next to Lake Union. This will be my first choice for future visits to Seattle. The sun room and backyard are great!"
43373,14040325,2014-06-10,2640935,Miriam,I enjoyed my stay immensely and would recommend the room.  It was a great pleasure to meet Michael and the home was very accommodating and pleasant.  I hope to stay here again soon.  
43373,14692050,2014-06-24,2444794,Michael,Had a wonderful stay at Michael's place. It was idea for the location and the room and bathroom were private and clean. Would recommend anyone staying there if you need a place to rest your head.
43373,15321541,2014-07-07,15067322,Guopeng,"It's our family's first stay in other's house. Michael is very friendly, and always give us some help. Because of jet leg, especially for my son, we stay at the house  more time. However, my son loves his new home, including sunny room, toys, fresh fruits and trampoline in backyard. And , it's interesting that my son have good interactions with uncle Michael.  We also experience  the US Independence day the second time. The house located in a peaceful and convenient neighborhood,  and only 5 minutes walk to the Gas Work Park.  "
43373,15628057,2014-07-13,11010434,Debbie,"We had a mixed experience at this AirBnB.  As Michael had communicated to us before we arrived, he was out of town until the night before we left, so we primarily interacted with his roommate and various guests.  On the plus side, the house has a great view of a river connecting the peninsula with downtown Seattle and also has a trampoline that we enjoyed using on our visit.  The roommate was friendly when we saw him and the general location was convenient and safe.  However, we did not enjoy that many of the windows and doors did not have screens to keep insects outdoors.  When we arrived, a cloud of insects were flying in the front entrance at dusk and we had to kill two spiders immediately in the bathroom, where one towel was set out for us.  Also, there was a musty smell in the bedroom, so we had to keep the windows open at all times.  We would not choose to stay here again given these issues."
43373,15788323,2014-07-15,7308805,Susannah,"Michael was great to work with from initial contact regarding booking to my stay itself.  Written and telephone communications with Michael prior to my arrival were clear and pleasant.   I had to adjust my arrival plans at the last minute and Michael was very easygoing with that and made contact with me to assure that I would be able to enter the house, find my room, and be comfortable, even if I would be arriving late.   
The room and bathroom were as they appeared on the website and both were very clean and comfortable. Although housemate Brian and a friend were in the solarium when I went to bed, my room was very quiet and I never heard noise from the rest of the house.  It was very hot in Seattle the weekend I stayed, but the room (and the rest of the house) was comfortable.  I felt very welcome at the house, and felt free to be in the kitchen, solarium, deck, etc.   
Michael made coffee and breakfast in the morning and welcomed me to have some.  Brian made a most fantastic smoothie using berries from the yard (among other things).   
A very  unexpected bonus of staying at the Big Sunny House was getting to have bodywork/massage done.  Michael is a professional in the healing arts and he was able to set up his table and work out the aches and pains I'd accrued during traveling.   I would highly recommend this if schedules allow!  

All and all, I would definitely recommend staying at Michaels. "
43373,16078753,2014-07-22,14483347,Steven,"We came to Seattle for the Dota 2 tournament.  We unfortunately did not get to experience much of Seattle, but we really enjoyed the neighborhood.  
It is a quiet residential area.  There are shops and a grocery store nearby.  The lake and public transit are within walking distance from the house.

Michael is very kind and understanding.  Everyone in the house is very nice...makes you feel right at home.  We didn't interact too much with everyone since we were not there very much (due to the event), but every interaction we did have was pleasant.  We would definitely stay here again. "
43373,16563035,2014-07-29,5079556,Gabriela,"very nice area, very nice people.
the room was fine. bathroom, etc...
i would totally go back."
43373,16977241,2014-08-05,5847414,"Harry, Beki & Coco","Michael was the most accommodating Airbnb host we've ever stayed with! Such a nice guy, and so great with our 11 month old daughter he has an open invitation to stay with us in England. Great bedroom with clean ensuite bathroom. Awesome living space with fantastic views and very close to loads of cool Seattle stuff. Make sure you ask him about his party deal: stay 8 nights or more and he'll host a big BBQ with beers, home made burgers and smoked salmon for up to 15 guests*. We can't recommend Michael's sunny house highly enough. Thanks again for letting us stay and we really hope to see you again soon!

*This is not technically true."
43373,17605328,2014-08-14,18283208,Angela,Michael was a very gracious and helpful host. The room was very comfortable and it was nice to have a private bathroom as well. The location was great! Very centralized to the downtown area (and lots of great vegan/vegetarian resteraunts) . Overall a great experience! I would definitely reccomend! 
43373,18024431,2014-08-20,3966785,Sang In,"It was really beautiful and cozy place. If I am planning to visit again, I will choose this place again."
43373,18582261,2014-08-28,17072940,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I needed to book 2 days last minute in Seattle when we traveled from New York to visit family. Michael offered airport pick-up (which we declined, though he later kindly drove us to the light rail station on our trip out) and gave suggestions for food in the Fremont area. His home is wonderfully located, near Fremont but with a lovely view of the water. The bed was comfortable (our first time on a water bed!) and having access to a private bathroom a treat. Very reasonable rate. Highly recommend. "
43373,18668817,2014-08-30,19174602,Kevin,Great place to stay. Host was very accommodating. I arrived a bit late so it was a bit difficult finding my way to the spare key he left but that was mostly my fault as I arrived a bit later than I anticipated. Other than that it was a great stay and no complaints!
43373,19059841,2014-09-05,3444252,Lee,"The host, Michael, was very communicative from the beginning. He let me know how to get in should he not be around when I arrived. The house was very clean and uncluttered. Michael also made coffee (according to how strong I wanted it!) for me first thing in the morning which was a very nice start to the day. I'd definitely stay here again if there was an opening, but, sadly for me, he's booked up for the foreseeable future."
43373,19152790,2014-09-07,11459028,Aaron,"I had an excellent experience at Michael's home.  This was my first time going with Airbnb for accommodations, and I was not disappointed.  Michael and his housemates were all very welcoming and hospitable.  The house has excellent views, and everything was exactly as advertised.  There were no surprises.  My only wish is that I had longer to stay in Seattle!   "
43373,19318910,2014-09-10,18230700,Terra,"This was my first airbnb and Michael was easy to communicate with every step of the way. Although I saw him very little he was nice and welcoming. 
Now what you really want to know.... I bed is super comfy, first time I did not have an issue sleeping away from home. The shower was nice and warm and bathroom clean. The doors for both the bedroom and bathroom are pocket doors without locks but I never felt like I needed one. The bedroom window has a screen on it but the bathroom does not; this is typical if you look at other houses around Seattle. The neighborhood was safe and I took several walks early morning and evening. The location is close to everything... Fremont is 5 minutes drive and downtown center is maybe a 10 minute drive."
43373,20014140,2014-09-22,18983577,Peggy,"The host was gracious, the view from the back of the house was great - view of Lake Union."
43373,20304855,2014-09-27,20640343,Natalie,"Michael is a wonderful host. He provided clear directions to the house, and was helpful in every way. The house was just as described, very comfortable  and spacious. Very pleasant neighborhood, nice garden and beautiful view.
The waterbed was a nice highlight of my stay as well.. Will definitely stay there again and recommend highly to others."
43373,21008262,2014-10-09,4138425,Richard,I felt welcome from the moment I arrived at Michael's house - he made sure I was well settled and comfortable.  The room and bath were great - very comfortable and very quiet and the location is ideal to easily getting to the University of Washington or into the city.  It was great!
43373,21236600,2014-10-13,21748270,Sergio,"As a first time user of Airbnb, I did not know much about what to expect. I was only looking for a nice, clean, comfortable and quiet place to spend for a few days. I found all that in addition to a super friendly host who also introduced me to some of his also warm and friendly friends, and made me feel at home.
It was a wonderful experience! "
43373,22835495,2014-11-16,22096385,Alayne,"This was the perfect home for the weekend.  Michael is a terrific host and he and the house mates are really kind, and inspirational people.  It was a truly wonderful.  The place is clean and welcoming with a great view from the bright sun room is of the water and a huge bridge and the city behind that.  The neigborhood felt very safe and walkable and it was easy to get to Fremont area and also to down to from this location.  "
43373,22953185,2014-11-18,22588418,Mark,"Michael is a very gracious host.  You will definitely feel welcome at his home.  I chose it based on location (which is close to UW, and being in Wallingford can't be beat) but was rewarded with a clean room with bathroom, and great hospitality.  Don't forget to take in the view of the Seattle skyline from Gasworks Park, just a couple blocks away from Michael's home."
43373,23318332,2014-11-29,269565,Susan,"We enjoyed our stay with Michael in The Big Sunny House even if the weather was not so sunny.  Our room was comfortable and clean and we enjoyed many pleasant interactions with Michael and his housemates.  Communication before and during our visit was great.  We felt very welcome in Michael's home.  Sue and John
"
43373,25344718,2015-01-12,20640343,Natalie,"I had an awesome stay at Michael's big and sunny house, for a second (website hidden)-visited again this wonderful corner of Fremont, with a nice view of marina. Slept like a baby in the heated waterbed, enjoyed many amenities including private bathroom, convenient kitchen and washer/drier right there. Will definitely stay again next time! "
43373,25383984,2015-01-14,22307512,Paul,"Michael made me feel totally welcome in his home. It's in a beautiful location which is, indeed, close to everything. Fantastic experience staying with him in Seattle. Highly recommended. "
43373,26181740,2015-02-06,25185425,Shuangye,非常好的一次体验。房间很卫生，很温馨，床特别软。阳光房很大，洗衣机很棒，micheal和jassi友好，最后一晚带我们参加party，我和儿子都玩得非常开心，谢谢你们！推荐朋友们住这里！
43373,28029895,2015-03-16,28425582,Abbey,"It's my first experience on airbnb and it's absolutely a fantastic one! My room is spacious, homy and comfy. The neighborhood is lovely and safe. It's very pleasant to walk by the trail along the union lake to UW campus and it's easy to take bus to go downtown. "
43373,28300399,2015-03-22,5352705,Alyssa,"I was welcomed initially by a ride to the house from the airport -- a really lovely way to begin my trip to Seattle.  Michael's friend Xanna picked me up (Michael was out of town), took me to Michael's house, and showed me around the space.

It's a lovely house with a lovelier view.  It's spacious and clean, and really felt like I had the run of the main floor.  

As soon as I'd been given a basic tour of the room in which I'd stay, and Xanna had opened a few kitchen cabinets, I had little contact with anyone in or from the house until it was time to leave."
43373,28623039,2015-03-27,29317595,Rob,"Provided a clean room, quiet house, lovely view and convenient location."
43373,29615529,2015-04-10,24727285,Nick,"I had a great 4-night stay in Michael's guest room. Michael and his housemates are all very friendly people. He even invited me to join them for dinner one night and to go dancing another. I was unable to take them up on either offer, but it was appreciated nevertheless. The place is clean, conveniently located and had everything I needed. One thing to note, the bed is in fact a waterbed which was a first for me and something I wasn't expecting but it was very comfortable and I rather enjoyed it."
43373,30148064,2015-04-18,29676379,Jack,"Michael was an excellent host, and his house was an outstanding place to choose as I explored Seattle neighborhoods as part of a move to the city. The room was good sized, with a big window looking out of the front of the house. It was also a 20 minute walk from UW, and 20 minute walks from restaurants on 45th street and around Wallingford. I didn't need to drive most of the week, but the house is well-placed for accessing different parts of the city. I highly recommend it!"
43373,30509788,2015-04-23,16861471,Dave,"Michael was a gracious host & the property is very well kept.

The view from the back deck is outstanding and inviting, as you are able to look at the water, as well as boats.  I also really liked the safe feel of the neighborhood.  

You are located just a half-a-block away from a paved walking/biking path.  

The house is also located close to UW, as well as rapid transit.  Plus, it is only a few (10 to 15) minutes from downtown."
43373,30848543,2015-04-27,26337012,Julie,"It's pretty great location as well as has a well decorated & Clean the house.

When you wanna see the stars in the sky & the lake & the bridge when in the house, you can enjoy it.

I had amazing experience when in the party with him in Seattle.

I'll always remember the journey in Seattle

Highly recommended."
43373,31234686,2015-05-03,31378450,Erica,"We felt totally welcome here. The house was as described, large,quiet bedroom and bed was comfy. The neighborhood was beautiful and a great location for needs. "
43373,33061129,2015-05-25,24420871,Hugh,Michael made us feel welcome and we enjoyed our stay. The neighbourhood and view of the lake added to the enjoyment.
43373,33459628,2015-05-28,32840111,Philip,"Lovely, peaceful neighborhood. Easy street parking and bus to downtown."
43373,43742281,2015-08-22,27238400,Kevin,"I stayed with Michael for 12 weeks this summer and I really enjoyed the experience.  The house was as described; clean and well maintained.  The atmosphere was laid back, which I appreciated.  A strong recommendation from me!"
43373,44777278,2015-08-29,36656315,Cindy,The accommodations were as described and were quite comfortable.  We particularly enjoyed sitting on the deck before dinner and watching the boats while having a glass of wine.  Location was good and near public transportation.  Michael was very helpful with suggestions of restaurants.
43373,45372049,2015-09-02,34783074,Mini,謝謝麥可跟萊拉的招待，跟你們聊天讓我了解更多的美國文化，這是一次很好的旅遊經驗。也很高興認識雪倫跟杰瑞米，内在的快樂是任何金錢都買不到的。
43373,45784952,2015-09-06,23862055,Pascal,"I can hardly recommend this place. Really nice neighborbood (restaurants and also the possibility for running) and a short bus drive to downtown Seattle.

Michael is a great host and everything was as it was described on his site. The bed is really comfortable :-) Would stay again at this place..."
43373,46473661,2015-09-11,15547349,Tiffany,"Excellent location, very walkable. Michael was fantastic to coordinate with and was very accommodating with arrival/departure times. Perfect for what my friend and I needed for our Seattle stay."
43373,46732401,2015-09-13,39772597,Eric,"Michael was a great host and was super flexible with our indecisiveness of what time we were arriving.  The room was comfortable and private, and everyone at the home was welcoming and inviting.  Being our first Airbnb experience of sharing a home, we weren't sure of what kind of guests we would be (keep private or be social), but Michael was very accommodating to us learning about ourselves and just going with the flow.

Other than our wonderful host, the house was nice, stayed cool even during the warm day, and the solarium was an epic spot to just hang out and relax while soaking in the view of Lake Union and the boats going under the bridge.  The location was perfect, walking distance to Fremont and pretty close to relevant transit routes to get us wherever we wanted to be."
43373,47168156,2015-09-16,40435088,Pradeep Kumar,Very friendly
43373,47670694,2015-09-21,2703064,Dorothy,The room and house were just as described. Michael is a great guy who is very welcoming.
43373,48305779,2015-09-25,8794108,Anita,We enjoyed our stay at Michael's. Great location and very nice and laid back host. Thanks for having us and for Aveda shampoo. Lovely touch :)
43373,48523546,2015-09-27,387330,Oksana,"Michael was a wonderful host. He picked me up from the airport and in the end of my visit dropped me off, which made stressing over transportation not an issue. Michael was approachable and made me feel completely at home, something very important to me when visiting a strange city. The room was cozy (I get cold easily, but Michael was completely fine with me turning up the heater to make the room toasty), and clean. The bed is very comfy! The house itself is in a fantastic location, overlooking the water and very near parks. If you're able to use the sun-room, do it for the view!The house is also in the perfect neighborhood which I explored by foot. Found the Gas Works Park overlooking downtown Seattle across the water. It's an incredibly relaxing and memorable place, all of it-the house, the neighborhood-and Michael was a pleasure to meet.  "
43373,48912110,2015-09-29,29698931,Chaoyang,Michael is really friendly. The room is very quiet and comfortable. And It takes about 5 minutes walk to gas works park.
43373,49609024,2015-10-05,14820331,Christopher,"Everything was great! All that I needed was provided, and the atmosphere is very relaxed and welcoming. Michael provided a very flexible environment, and I always felt comfortable. 

For those traveling without a car, there is a bus stop a few blocks away that is easy to access. You can reach downtown and other areas of Seattle from this point.

Beyond that, the house provides great views of Seattle. Those living in the neighborhood are definitely fortunate."
43373,50094590,2015-10-09,37636624,Song,"Michael is very nice! I like his house, it is quiet and cleaning. "
43373,50453112,2015-10-12,15923631,Harry,"Clean and comfortable, with a friendly, helpful host. Another great experience for us. "
43373,50994799,2015-10-16,3644932,Thomas & Carol,"Michael is a truly warm and interesting person. I felt more than welcome. His home was in a perfect location for me to walk the Burke-Gilman trail to campus. For under $6, you can take Link light rail from the airport to downtown, then catch a #26 metro bus to Michael's place...easy and pretty fast. I would recommend this listing for anyone needing access to University of Washington campus."
43373,51676342,2015-10-22,46713838,Cindy,This was my first Airbnb experience. Michael met me on my arrival. He immediately pointed out that the bedroom door did not have a lock and wanted to make sure I was comfortable with that situation. I appreciated the quiet atmosphere of his home while I was there as well as the private bathroom. His home is within walking distance to UW which was a big plus for me. There was room in the refrigerator for my food and access to the kitchen. I will use Airbnb again based on this experience.
43373,52967204,2015-11-03,4266915,Njemile,"Michael was very welcoming.  While I was on the road, he even called me to check on my arrival time and give me instructions on how to enter the house.  Lela, his roommate, was also wonderful to talk to.  We had a long talk about long term international travel an other interesting topics.

I was absent the house a lot of the time (I was in town for a meditation retreat), but while I was there the house was very quiet, the neighborhood was wonderful, and the accommodations were comfortable.
"
43373,55371900,2015-12-01,42663270,Janith,"I stayed in Michael's home for over three weeks in November. It was very cold in the house, especially in the bathroom. Michael was in Hawaii for most of my stay and had not shown me or the woman who checked in with me how to turn the thermostat on, so the bathroom was unbearably cold for most of my stay. The bedroom was heated but had a strong musty smell. The bedroom needed cleaning ie: stains on the carpet, food wrappers under bed and dresser, dirty men's clothing left in dresser. I shared my concerns with Michael before I left and he was aware of my major concerns.
That said, the location of the house for my purposes was great and the views of Seattle were lovely at night."
43373,55623791,2015-12-03,17062932,Waleed,"The room was great, and I loved the water bed with the fancy heating capabilities. Michael was reachable on the phone in case I needed something and was generally very welcoming and nice."
43373,56577096,2015-12-14,51013202,Lucía,"Awesome time at Michael's! Great location 15min walking to Fremont St although Michael was always willing to give us a ride. The house is nice and tidy, comfy bed and clean washroom. In the morning we were lucky to try Michael's feature coffee, one of the best in town!"
43373,56828113,2015-12-18,46867744,Jordan,"I enjoyed my stay with Michael. Great location close to shops, food, UW and downtown. The water bed with a heated blanket were nice added touches. Michael is very friendly and easy to work with. I would come stay again. "
43373,56971322,2015-12-20,50945827,Lawson,Great host and gave lots of recommendations around Seattle! The waterbed was definitely the highlight of the stay. 
43373,57334621,2015-12-24,38044452,Annie,It was a great time to stay in Michaels place. The room was clean and the bed was huge. Michael was very gentle and even drove us to the bus stop to catch our plane. Highly recommend!
43373,57955351,2015-12-30,51555997,Amin,"Michael was a gracious host and made us feel welcome in his beautiful home. To say the house had a view is an understatement. Right across the water from downtown Seattle, the lights from the city at night were breathtaking. It was pretty cold when we stayed and the house itself seemed incapable of conserving heat. Michael was really accommodating with a heated blanket and thermostats in each room. Since it was the holidays there were quite a few people visiting which made us feel slightly intrusive but Michael managed to make the home still inviting even though my fiancé and I wished to be alone. There were few toiletries available though I am sure if we had made a point to request some he would have obliged. Overall a clean beautiful place to stay with very nice people in an amazing location. I definitely recommend. "
43373,58221019,2016-01-01,17475382,Makayla,"Michael was very nice and accommodating. We stayed during a very cold two days and he did what he could to make sure we were warm. Great location, clean and comfortable. "
8046691,47786736,2015-09-21,21415517,Nick,"What a gem.  EXCELLENT location, beautifully apartment and top-notch service from Aaron.  I would stay again in a heartbeat and recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."
8046691,48109982,2015-09-23,13380939,Kristen,"Had a great time in Seattle! This neighborhood was perfect.
Great coffee,Breakfast place, grocery store, and Walgreens all close.
The apartment is near many bus lines or a 30 min walk to many tourist activities. 
The apartment is cute and has a vintage feel. 
Its on the second floor.
Has a small kitchen to prepare simple meals. Bed was comfy.
Building has a parking spot as an option.
Perfect alternative to a hotel. Definitely would stay here again. Thank you!

3158210,14205775,2014-06-14,13830574,Sarah,"David was an incredible host. I stayed at his apartment on a work trip, and due to my travel arrangements I needed to drop me bags off earlier than anticipated. David was not only flexible with my check-in/check-out times, but was very responsive to any questions I had.
 
He was very well prepared for my visit, and provided a great ‘welcome’ letter with all pertinent information for his apartment that was accompanied by a list of restaurants, Seattle points of interest and transportation options.
 
All in all it was a great stay and David’s willingness to go the extra mile made this a rewarding first airbnb experience.  
 "
3158210,15277086,2014-07-06,15606640,Miki,"David was a wonderful host! While I didn’t have the chance to meet him in person, he was communicative through the entire process and arranged a very clear, flexible check-in/check-out.  He even provided a thoughtful map pinpointing local essentials and excellent recommendations for my first Seattle trip.

David’s apartment was clean and comfortable, located in a peaceful neighborhood that was walking distance to both the beautiful lakefront and delicious eateries. It served as the ideal home base for exploring both downtown and north of Lake Union with easy access to public transportation.

I highly recommend David as a host and would love to stay at his apartment again. He certainly set the bar high for my first Airbnb experience!"
3158210,17053899,2014-08-06,6626317,Matt,"David was fantastic. His place was immaculate, perfectly located, and had anything I would ever need. He even left me some extra quarters in case I needed to do some laundry! He was incredibly accommodating to my odd arrival time, and was fast to respond to any questions that came up. I definitely hope to stay here again!"
3158210,17511304,2014-08-13,9020242,Gabriella,We had the best time staying at David's place. He was easy to talk to and get a hold of and the location of his apartment was perfect. I would definitely recommend people to stay in that neighborhood when traveling to Seattle. His apartment was a great size for the 3 of us traveling and had plenty of space for us. We would definitely rent this place again. Thank's David!! 
3158210,17854554,2014-08-18,1298672,Jarod,David's apartment was great. Spacious and very clean with all the amenities you need. We loved the neighborhood and would highly recommend. 
3158210,18814538,2014-09-01,5971109,Matthew,"The place was great and in a nice location, with easy access to both Downtown and North of the water."
3158210,20449559,2014-09-29,6067840,Amaury,"We had a great stay in Seattle! David's apartment is ideally located in Eastlake, close to Capitol Hill, Downtown, and the U-District by bus! The view to Lake Union and the Space Needle from the very spacious living room was a best. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a quite area to stay, yet close to everything you could need in Seattle."
3158210,23589246,2014-12-05,1248651,Sunny,David has impeccable communication during the entire process and was extremely flexible when I needed to extend my checkout time. The apartment was spacious and cozy and in a great location with direct lake views. I would stay at David's rental again.
3158210,32693188,2015-05-20,2059054,Vena,"Great location, nicely appointed and communicative host. Would definitely stay here again."
3158210,33153487,2015-05-25,22736264,Mark,"The apartment was exactly as described: clean, centrally located, and very cozy! All the amenities we could need were provided (including an umbrella for the Seattle weather!) . David himself was extremely welcoming and communicative. We had an awesome trip and David was a key component in making that happen. 

"
3158210,33948583,2015-06-02,23111778,Bas,"Had a nice stay in this fine apartment near the lake. It was early summer in Seattle so the lake was buzzing with activity. 
The apartment had all you can wish for. David, was great in his communication. Just a "

3158210,35387920,2015-06-18,32630528,Debbie,"
David made us feel welcome from the moment we entered the apartment.  The description is very accurate.  This apartment is light -filled and welcoming.  It is wonderful to sit on the couch with a morning cup of coffee and look out the large living room window and observe Lake Union.  David left coffee for us, as guests, and the apartment had everything we needed.  Our son lives in the Eastlake area and we loved walking to coffee shops, restaurants, and along Lake Union to see the houseboats.  We would book again, and would recommend for others."
3158210,36019973,2015-06-24,14767510,Michelle,"The apartment was exactly as described.  We were pleased by the location and by the cleanliness and brightness of the place. There was plenty of space for our family of three to sleep and hang out. David was very responsive and helpful, too.  When we first arrived, he made sure we had everything we needed to make our visit to Seattle easy and enjoyable: maps, directions, tips for neighborhood eateries, etc. (We highly recommend Louisa's Cafe and Bakery!) The neighborhood is about 2 miles from the Space Needle, and it's a pleasant walk along Lake Union to get there.  There are also convenient bus lines, in case you're not up to walking.  We'd definitely stay again!"
3158210,36679889,2015-06-30,13011545,Ankur,"David made the check in process seamless and was available for all the queries we had during the stay. The house was as described on the website with all the amenities. It is located in quiet Eastlake but just a couple of miles from Capitol Hill and the downtown. There is a view of the lake from the apartment. The air mattress in the living room is a little uncomfortable but we used the very comfortable couch for the third person. Highly recommended for up to 3 people. In case of 4 people, make sure to ask for sleeping arrangements. "
3158210,37349191,2015-07-06,14951988,Anup,Overall a very positive experience- David was very communicative and professional.  The place was as-described in the profile - great view and easy walking distance to several bars and restaurants.
3158210,39753503,2015-07-26,32983765,Matthew,This was a fantastic place to stay.  You couldn't ask for a better location in EastLake.  The apartment is really clean and well-equipped and the building is quiet and secure.  It was very helpful to have a variety of little supplies available like an iron and board.  David provided a few cold beverages for us in the fridge and this was a welcome treat.
3158210,41648056,2015-08-08,14907514,William,"Nice, clean, quiet apartment on a residential street - nice lake side walking to downtown and views of the houseboats. Didn't end up meeting David, but his apartment was a great place to hang my hat and enjoy Seattle from for a few days. I'd stay there again."
3158210,47073179,2015-09-15,1590221,Marion,"Airy, clean, great location,fun watching seaplanes on Lake Union. David made us very welcome. The parking space made it very convenient. Even on a warm afternoon, it stayed comfortable with the fan.  We would stay here again!"
3158210,47999586,2015-09-22,42035787,James,"The location of David's apartment is its strongest selling point. It is a lovely neighborhood, overlooking Lake Union, and very quiet. One block to at least four bus routes direct to downtown and all the attractions; also, multiple, superb restaurants within walking distance. Parking space was a plus, but we would probably not take a car next time -- public transportation options, including Uber, were excellent.

David was very helpful and responsive to our questions and needs. He gave us some suggestions for restaurants and city walks that only a local would know. And he always returned our texts promptly.  Our five day stay was terrific."
4009508,19557650,2014-09-14,6058708,Paul,"Easy connection with Miranda for keys. Apartment was clean. Good Size. Comfortable furniture. Pictures accurate. Coffee shop in building. Miranda responsive to requests.
Stayed six nights. First three, I attended a conference at Convention Center. 
Location was perfect, one block away. My wife joined me for last three days. Good (email hidden)st things a short walk or cab ride ($10).
Even though on 22nd floor, my wife found traffic noise bothersome at night. I slept through the noise."
4009508,20118046,2014-09-23,21261005,Kendall,"Seattle is such a busy city! Finding a place centrally located downtown was a huge relief. Miranda was not only accommodating and patient with the reservation process, but she was flexible and communicative. The accommodations were clean, modern, and inviting. I would highly recommend this space to anyone visiting the Seattle area or looking for a night away from home! "
4009508,20379872,2014-09-28,21400365,Jessica,"Miranda is a great host and very responsive should you need anything, have questions, etc.  The apartment has a great location, close to shopping, restaurants and Pike's Place.  We also walked over to Capital Hill quite a bit as that was just one neighborhood over.  Very clean apartment with a nice kitchen."
4009508,21327457,2014-10-14,9390634,Ted,"Had a great time in Seattle. Mike and Miranda could not have been more accommodating and the condo was perfect.

My girlfriend and I rented the 1bed condo near the convention center and when we walked in, the condo far exceeded expectations.  It was completely new...50inch TV, contemporary furniture, stainless kitchen & king-size bed. We absolutely loved staying in the building and the location is prime for walking everywhere.

Mike and Miranda were super accommodating as well and answered any questions we had immediately.

If you are wanting to stay in Seattle, in a prime location and in a higher-end condo, look no further."
4009508,21719019,2014-10-22,22091108,Karen,"This wonderful condo is in a perfect location from which to explore downtown Seattle and beyond. Within walking distance of visitor favorites, like Pike Place Market, and close to all manner of public transportation for farther locations.

The condo is in nice neighborhood with nearby restaurants and great shops. It's downtown, so you'll see some ""homeless"" but my husband and I were never bothered by them.

Furniture, kitchen and bathroom all nice, functional and comfortable. Netflix for inside entertainment when you're tired after a day of sightseeing.

There's some street noise that is more white noise than anything, as the efficiency windows and patio doors block out a lot. But if you prefer total quiet you might consider bringing ear plugs so you can sleep.

I can't say enough about how fabulous Miranda was as a host, from first contact through after we left. She was super kind, attentive and followed up even after the smallest requests. Her promptness and efficiency were much appreciated, and made our stay very memorable. I wouldn't hesitate to stay at any one of her places next time we're in Seattle!
"
4009508,22378057,2014-11-04,21981302,Tamer,This was by far the best trip accommodations we've had. Miranda is an excellent host. The apartment was beautiful. Stocked with first class amenities and exactly as described. Miranda made sure all our needs were met and kept in touch with us during our stay.  Thanks Miranda. 
4009508,22561049,2014-11-09,3464947,Taryn,"Miranda was really lovely- very accommodating to my schedule, available for any questions, and even left a bottle of wine for us to enjoy. The apartment was perfect- very nice, clean, convenient to everything, and the bed was so comfortable! I would definitely recommend staying here or any property Miranda and Mike have. Thanks so much for making my stay in Seattle flawless. "
4009508,23139648,2014-11-23,10665651,Alistair,"This place was awesome! Exceptional location, host communication, price, and cleanliness. A place like this makes you feel much more at home than at a hotel and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place in downtown Seattle :)"
4009508,25032759,2015-01-05,23955312,Brian,"Moving to a new city that you know nothing about can be stressful enough without worrying about where you will be staying.  Traveling across country meant getting in late (2 AM).  To my astonishment Miranda made arrangements to get me in to the apartment when I arrived.  I soon found out that is business as usual for Miranda.  She is a fantastic host who goes out of her way to help make your stay incredible.  The apartment was clean, elegant, and very comfortable.  The location is great if you love downtown living.  Great views, especially at night.  It is close to so many restaurants and shops.  I didn't want to leave!  "
4009508,26226458,2015-02-07,1729090,Shawn,"Miranda and Mike were excellent hosts.  They contacted me right away when I arrived in town to coordinate last minute logistics.  The place was exactly as described, nicely furnished, clean, and in a great location.  I highly recommend Miranda and Mike and this unit.

Thanks!"
4009508,26422327,2015-02-12,23264547,Jason,"This is a GREAT space.  The apartment is comfortable and modern.  The kitchen is well outfitted and the bed is VERY comfortable.  The bathroom is a little small, but I'm willing to give that up for the spaciousness of the rest of the apartment.  There was a bottle of wine waiting for me when I got there and Mike was helpful in getting me settled.  Definitely a space worth staying in."
4009508,26569497,2015-02-15,10209384,Jim,"We had very pleasant stay. The apartment was clean, quiet and very conveniently located!"
4009508,26784471,2015-02-19,23264547,Jason,The location for this apartment is great.  Very easy and convenient to get to the rest of Downtown and up into Capitol Hill.  I particularly enjoyed using the Apple TV to relax and watch some shows one night.  
4009508,27128543,2015-02-26,23264547,Jason,"Once again, this apartment is a great find.  This was my third week staying here for work, and they were incredibly responsive to a comment I made on last week's review with regards to a stopped up sink.  It was fixed by the time I got back.  The bed is incredibly comfortable, and nothing can really beat the convenience.

Thanks for making these weekly trips comfortable."
4009508,27717276,2015-03-10,339865,Susan,"I spent almost a week in Seattle and moved from a somewhat problematic apartment to an offered upgrade by Michael and followed up by Eve.  They own/ manage a number of lodging options in the Seattle area and I think that by having Eve on board they will be very successful. She is all about customer service and really went above and beyond to help with any little concern.  I appreciated having her as a contact as she was quite responsive even if it was that I couldn't figure out how to use the TV remotes.  The apartment I ultimately stayed at had a very comfortable bed, excellent location and a nice view. I felt quite safe in the apartment and did not hear any street noise. Thanks to Eve for all of your help!
"
4009508,28739707,2015-03-29,28754774,Elizabeth,"Cozy, clean, and walkable to downtown sites. A great stay!"
4009508,29843067,2015-04-13,10087429,Hsien Yuen,"Good space, comfortable bed. Location is good, very close to convention centre. "
4009508,30394353,2015-04-21,29069650,David,"Excellent apartment and excellent hosting from Eve. Centrally located and extremely convenient to the Washington State Convention Center. If it's raining, you would only need to walk outside for about 30-40 feet before getting to a covered sidewalk that leads to the door for the center. Nice coffee shop on the ground floor was a plus too. "
4009508,31046433,2015-05-01,11736366,Jennifer,5 star apt and host. Eve was wonderful and very attentive. The apt was lovely and exceeded our expectations. Perfect for anyone who is attending a conference at the convention center or wanting to explore pikes place. Great apt would 100% stay there again. Eve even had a bottle of wine to greet us. A fabulous stay in Seattle!
4009508,32699268,2015-05-20,174048,Burt,"Eve responded to my initial inquiry very quickly and answered all of my questions. They offered me an upgrade to this apartment and it was one of my best stays in Seattle -- very quiet, very comfortable, very roomy and very nice view @ night. The neighborhood is very walkable and easy to get to public transportation. For those with a car street parking is fine later at night. Overall a very good experience and Eve & Michael were great hosts."
4009508,32914647,2015-05-23,12772695,Steve,"Eve is a great and professional host, practically like booking a hotel suite with a kitchen.  Perfect location, 2 blocks from downtown and the shopping district and 2 blocks from 5 of the best restaurants and coffee shops in Capitol Hill.  Would stay here and with Eve as a host again."
4009508,33658646,2015-05-31,3098948,Joe,"What I love most is the location of the house. It's in the middle of the downtown, only one block from Seattle convention center.
Also, it is a full-furnished flat; we take easy ourselves with convenience.
Actually, host's recommended restaurant lists are very helpful to enjoy Seattle life. Tasty and guaranteed!
She responds my messages quickly and answers my question with her best. "
4009508,34697529,2015-06-11,12272747,Shirley,Eve was very easy to work with.  She was always available and accommodated some changes to our itinerary.  The location is great and the condo is very clean.
4009508,35306385,2015-06-17,28933187,Felice,"Perfect location for our 5 night getaway - we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  Eve provided great restaurant recommendations and was very easy to deal with.  The unit was clean, comfortable and cozy.   "
4009508,35548954,2015-06-20,30277125,Pattaraporn,"I and my parents spent 3 nights in Seattle. We had a wonderful time in Eve's place. The room is very clean. Eve provided us everything we need to make us feel like home. The location is perfect and not too hilly. Walking distance to Pike place market, shops. Eve is very quick response to all of my questions. She is nice and easy to work with."
4009508,36374766,2015-06-28,30417528,Mindy,"This was my first time booking with air bnb, and believe me, I had heard a significant number of horror stories and was beyond nervous; but from the very beginning, Eve allayed my fears. From first booking to following up a week before my stay, from arrival to departure and everywhere in between, Eve was diligent in corresponding and always assessed my needs to make sure we felt welcome. Needless to say, the apartment was beautiful. Perfect location (walkable to convention center, Pike's Place, and metro service to Seattle Center), and had all the amenities you wouldn't even think of needing on your own. Eve also checked in during our stay to make sure everything was ok and was kind enough to accommodate late check-out for us. When we return to Seattle in the future, I will only be booking through air bnb and with Eve and Michael."
4009508,37000590,2015-07-03,434732,Angelo,"I have stayed at Eve's properties several times now: she is the ultimate host, and  a great communicator, always making you feel like home - I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Checkin is extremely easy and the unit is well equipped with everything you would need for a short trip. 

The property itself is a modern building, in a prime location with spectacular views of Seattle downtown and even the water. In a high floor, with A/C, very generous space and a rather comfy bed. Good value and highly recommended."
4009508,38205508,2015-07-13,17048509,Alexandros,"Fantastic flat, fantastic location, great host! A truly great stay."
4009508,38847451,2015-07-19,33789395,Tony,Great location and a very nice modern abode. Eve was also a great host that made out Seattle trip wonderful. 
4009508,40102040,2015-07-28,34659005,Sandi,"Eve was exceptional to work with- she sent me advance information about the condo, apps to download in advance for food delivery, transportation, parking, you name it.  She was always available by text at a minutes notice, was prompt and professional.  The condo was exactly as stated, quality amenities, very clean and in a really great location.  Walking distance to everything downtown- restaurants, attractions, transportation, shopping."
4009508,40741692,2015-08-02,33780612,Angela,"This was such an amazing place and Eve was a great host! She was very flexible in letting us check in early, and even met us with a welcome bottle of wine. The condo location was perfect for touring Seattle. Whole condo was very clean and had everything we needed for a few nights stay. Would definitely stay here again! "
4009508,41383958,2015-08-07,15195345,Mihoko,"This was a great place in a great location, super convenient for the conference at convention center. Responsiveness of hosts was excellent.  Overall, I would say the place was a little smaller than it seemed in the photos but we did have everything we needed.  Also, the pool is not one you could swim laps in but gym facilities were clean and empty.    "
4009508,41751525,2015-08-09,2507387,Susan,"Nice clean apartment, very walkable around downtown with courteous, responsive hosts. The coffee shop on the first floor was really convenient in the mornings! And WiFi and gym in the building were great too.

As travelers sensitive to cleanliness, the care they took offering very fresh towels and sheets, and generally keeping the whole place very clean, was a major comfort to us. I'd easily recommend this place to friends and family. "
4009508,43418426,2015-08-19,14841522,Kirsten,Morgan and this apartment are awesome! Perfect location in downtown. Very walkable with shops and restaurants all around. Apartment is immaculate and stylish. Morgan was extremely accommodating and flexible when our flights were changed. I would definitely stay here again!
4009508,43720909,2015-08-21,41580341,Angel,"Excellent location, clean apartment and easy check in. I highly recommend it"
4009508,45862269,2015-09-06,41580341,Angel,"I really like staying at this convention center unit during my business trips to Seattle. It's remarkably clean, great location, and stocked with everything you might need. The bedroom is very comfortable and the views of the city are second to none. The air conditionate makes the unit very livable in those summer months. It's just perfect and very convenient"
4009508,48325796,2015-09-25,43877780,Brett,"Apartment description is accurate, has a nice view, and the building has a coffee shop built into it too."
4009508,49798410,2015-10-06,551966,Rebecca,"Crisp. Convenient. Complete.

Daniela provided me with all the information I needed to have a pleasant 8-day stay in Seattle. What I liked most:
* CONVENIENCE I could walk to everything I needed: groceries, coffee shops, etc. AND there was a car rental office for a day trip to the mountains.
* MINIMAL & MODERN I prefer a minimalist environment and this apartment had everything I needed and nothing more: blazing fast wireless access, comfortable couch and bed, a view, and all the essential cooking utensils to cook in or host a guest."
8409969,47922896,2015-09-21,9200864,Robert,"I had an excellent stay at Dario's. I booked last minute and was happy to find everything was ready when I arrived. 
The accommodation was clean with modern facilities and in a quiet location. 
The breakfast was excellent, there were eggs, bacon, cereal, yoghurt, fruit and orange juice. 
Dario's place is approximately a $3 bus ride or a $15 uber ride to town."
8409969,48849698,2015-09-28,3152653,Thomas,"Huge number of amenities for a low rental rate! Would love to stay there again. The place was very clean and peaceful, in a great neighborhood, walking distance from Seward Park. Breakfast was a nice bonus."
8409969,49077131,2015-09-30,39879731,Joey,"very accurate description, all the amenities you could ask for really, great experience. "
8409969,49946779,2015-10-07,44844903,Salvador,"I was not able to meet Dario but the place is really nice, neat and comfortable, it's also walking distance to a really nice lake. Good experience!"
8409969,50150395,2015-10-09,2042362,Justin,"My stay at Dario's home was fantastic. I had my car, so I didn't have to worry much about public transportation. Although, the other guests said they had no problems getting around. The location was quiet and quaint, and the breakfast was yummy! I would stay here over and over. Unbeatable value!"
8409969,50589600,2015-10-12,41906146,Estefania,"We were really comfortable in that house... We never saw Dario and there were other guests at the same time but the house was really clean, calm and there were a lot of things for the breakfast. The downtown is just 15-20 minutes by car. :) "
8409969,50969804,2015-10-16,37315268,Karen,Wow!  Great place to rest my head!  Nice kitchen stocked with breakfast items...thanks so much!
8409969,51489826,2015-10-20,45317350,Mengshan,"The house is located near a very beautiful lake. It looks far away from downtown seattle but it is not, you only take about 30 minutes by transportation. The house is very clean, warm and beautiful, and the host is really, really friendly and nice. When living in the house, we really feel like at home. This is the best choice if you want to visit Seattle."
8409969,51672874,2015-10-22,28075951,Jessica,We enjoyed our stay very much. The environment felt comforting and warming. We also enjoyed the breakfast that was offered. It was great to wake up and be able to make breakfast without having to go out every morning. 
8409969,51962461,2015-10-25,17182080,Victor,"It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood.  The room was very nice and cozy.  It had a heater in there that you could adjust to which was really nice for me since I wasn't used to the cold.  The host was very responsive when we had questions.  Although we didn't eat any of the breakfast that was provided, it was a very nice gesture!"
8409969,52280202,2015-10-27,46688931,Thia,"Great bargain in an impressively well-managed operation. Efficiently welcoming at any hour. Easy access to home and room. Clear instructions make it possible to manage everything without bothering a host. Individual room thermostat. Very clean. Separate kitchens on each floor are super handy. Convenient parking. Quiet neighborhood. Easy to drive to from freeway,  airport or downtown."
8409969,52728364,2015-11-01,44017651,Rosalind,"We enjoyed our stay here very much. The room was comfortable and clean, although the carpet was slightly dirty when we checked in. There was a heater in the room which was perfect because it was so cold outside. Breakfast was provided and we could also use the washer & dryer which makes things very convenient for us. Getting around was also easy as there is a bus stop near the house serviced by bus 50 that brings us to & from the nearest light rail starion and the train basically brings us anywhere we want to go, including the SeaTac airport.

Some downsides were the house being far away from downtown Seattle (on average we need at least 45 mins to get to places that we want to go) and to get to the house from the nearest bus stop, we need to walk up a slope and it was a hassle to do so with luggage, although it was just a short distance. We also didn't get the keys to our room, which for us is necessary as it enables us to lock the door and things in the room will be more secure when we aren't around, even though the doors can be locked from the inside.

Overall, it was a great stay and I highly recommend!"
8409969,53272285,2015-11-07,46866430,Julie And Jason,"This was a clean, comfortable place to stay the night.  The listing was very accurate and was easy to find.  Plenty of street parking available as well.  The common areas were also clean and well stocked for guests.  I would not hesitate to stay here again if we return to Seattle."
8409969,53622810,2015-11-10,27878786,Sandon,"The space is basic and that's what worked for me! I was very surprised at the offerings of breakfast items during my stay. I did not partake in much of it, but that's always a bonus in my book!

The rest of the house is spacious and inviting. I was fortunate to meet another guest staying at the same time and they kindly offered me to join em for dinner in the dining room. That was simply awesome of them as we were essentially strangers.
Dario sure knows how to pick em ;-).

For the price point for my room, i could not think of anything bad at all. One small thing to be aware of is if you're a super light sleeper, you are downstairs so some minor noises from upstairs can be heard. 

You may hear the floorboards creak every now and then, especially if the other guests are Jumpy Jumpersons. You might hear the random leaf blower from a next door neighbor too in the morning. Which happened during my stay. Just a friendly heads up for light sleepers. :-)

These things are quite minor for the most part. As I'm a pretty no frills, easy going traveler. The house was clean and again, food for guests = bonus!!!!

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
8409969,54996634,2015-11-27,45933567,Wan Ying,"Super nice experience staying at Dario's house. The location is nice that you can go to downtown and other area easily. The room is comfy, clean and the neighbourhood is simply amazing. Housemates living in the house are all very nice and I really enjoy chatting with them. This is my first Airb&b experience and it was highly impressive. Must stay in Dario's house if I visit Seattle again ;) "
8409969,55513768,2015-12-01,29632087,Nik,"The room was set exactly as pictured on Air BnB, beautiful! The neighborhood is quiet and safe with ample parking. The space was set up very well throughout the downstairs of the house, complete with kitchen and common living room area. Although it was fairly cold at night, the heater in the room kept it a very comfortable temperature. I will definitely be looking up this house next time I'm in Seattle!"
8409969,55880774,2015-12-06,50017825,Teresa,"This was my first experience with Airbnb, I really enjoyed it. It was a lot easier and less stressful than finding a hotel. Dario's house was great and the room I stayed in was exactly like the pictures. I would definitely stay here again."
8409969,56292240,2015-12-11,9406460,Michael,"I didn't get to meet Dario in person, but everything in the house was well organized, fully documented, and nicely stocked.  I had no problem with street parking, door entry (a code to get in) or finding things I needed.  The downstairs kitchen was very well stocked with breakfast makings.  I wish I could have lingered there longer.  It's a nice home to stay in."
8409969,56632440,2015-12-15,16150968,Michael,Dario was very accomadating and helpful. had a very relaxing stay. would love to come back. 
8409969,56996004,2015-12-20,11615246,Lisa,"The room that was offered was really welcoming. There were other guests as well and we were offered breakfast food, towels and amenities. 

I did have a little trouble finding the bathroom light because it was outside the door. Just a heads up for future guests. "
8409969,57137028,2015-12-22,9228059,Rainbow,"Dario's place was warm, friendly, clean, and quaint. His mother Olga welcomed us to the house upon arrival. There is plenty of bacon, vegetables, eggs, orange juice, and tea for breakfast. It's self-serviced as advertised. The location is a bit far from downtown Seattle (about 20-30 minutes via taxi) but there is public transportation available. There are guests in other rooms but they were quiet and kept to themselves. Overall very much of a hostel feel and very comfortable."
2769088,13382470,2014-05-26,9474109,Chris,"The apartment offers a view of Seattle as a resident and local. It doesn't offer luxury but that's not always what someone is seeking. We found the location to be a little too far from downtown but Wendy gave us all the details we needed to get around so that made things easier. The area is nice and the next door coffee is amazing. You can drive to Ballard easily and the airport isn't a bad drive in the morning before traffic. You're not far from city necessities and Wendy offers advice as you need it. 

There is a big dog that will sometimes hang out in the yard but it's very friendly and sweet. "
2769088,14530340,2014-06-21,16388717,Ashley,Nice place. A little too expensive. Bathroom was dirty and seemed like the bed sheets were slept in. Great patio view though. The location was perfect for going to pike market.
2769088,14638211,2014-06-23,159951,Elizabeth,"We had a lovely stay at Wendy's place. This is a quirky attic apartment with a lot of personality.  It's a cozy, affordable option, clean enough, in a fantastic neighborhood. This listing is what Airbnb is all about. Would definitely stay there again!"
2769088,16474576,2014-07-28,13003929,Alicia,"Needed to find an affordable place to stay in Seattle for a kickball tournament.  This place worked out great for my husband and I and two of our teammates. Communication with Wendy was easy and prompt. Beautiful view of the Olympics!! We all really liked the funky decor and even posed with the manikins for some photos.  Beds were comfortable.  You get what you see in the pics. We thought the location was perfect for us and was  in close proximity to Green Lake park where our games were. We also took some of Wendy's recommendations and checked out some local spots that were in walking distance.  The only cons: Floors looked like they needed a good vacuuming but everything else was pretty clean.  I would have even done it myself but didn't see a vacuum. It was a hot weekend in Seattle so a fan would have been nice, especially for my husband that sleeps super hot. (We normally bring a small fan for him but forgot to bring ours) But we made due and it is was
still not a deal breaker for me. "
2769088,17494207,2014-08-13,1555383,Erik,The reservation was canceled 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2769088,18311652,2014-08-25,12565354,Kacy,Listing description was accurate. Pictures need to be updated as I think the bathroom was remodeled and no motorized couch :(
2769088,18735704,2014-08-31,5868508,Virginia,"Wendy was out of town when we arrived, but did provide us with an alternate contact during our stay. Unfortunately, we were quite disappointed with the cleanliness level of the house. The pictures online didn't match the reality. While there were lots of differences, the main ones that caused us to leave were that there were no towels available, the beds weren't made (and looked slept in!), and there was dirt and debris on the floor. We ended up leaving and getting a hotel elsewhere. The next morning when we returned to take pictures (to submit to Airbnb), there were towels left (on the dirty floor!) for us. 
We are currently working with airbnb and wendy to get a refund on our reservation and are hopeful that we can reach a reasonable and fair resolution. "
2769088,18880644,2014-09-02,6542046,Michael,"Wendy made the experience super easy. She was on point, communicative, and even though she was out of town during our stay we had no problem navigating the space, access, or house rules.  

The neighborhood, btw, is incredible.  Best coffee shop ever next door and a really cool restaurant/ bar on the same block.  Really no problems getting into town - it helps to get to know the bus schedule.  

All in all a great stay - the place is certainly quaint but turned out to be an ideal spot to explore the city like a local. "

2769088,42211505,2015-08-11,11451359,James,"Thank you, Wendy, for sharing your lovely home. Every aspect of our stay was exactly as we'd hoped."
1571230,7031241,2013-09-03,2737163,Eric,"Melissa was very responsive and easy to work with and accommodated me nicely.  A couple things to note: make sure to ask Melissa if you need more than one towel.  Make sure to bring shampoo, etc.  There is no air conditioning in the studio.  The mattress and walls are thin so its not optimal for light sleepers.  The room was definitely large enough for 1-2 people with a couch for sitting on.  It's on the first floor which is great. There is a parking lot next door and Melissa also was able to arrange parking for me in the back of the building as well so that was very helpful.  A very economical place and friendly host in a convenient area with restaurants, shops nearby.  Thanks Melissa! "
1571230,7520987,2013-09-23,8491782,Janet,"The apartment/studio was very noisy.  All night long and on both nights I heard people outside my window.  It sounded like they were having a party. Melissa later told me I should have called the police. If it's noisy for you, just call the police or Melissa.  I only had one towel and there was no blanket for the bed - just a sheet.  I later learned that you need to ask for another towel - I stayed two nights, but only received one towel. The room is OK, very simple with very basic items, including a broken lamp.  I did not like the parking behind the building - there was a queen size mattress in the alley with lots of bottles and garbage, which made me think that people were sleeping there.  I worried that my rental car would be damaged.  I have stayed at the Deca hotel and it is only $137 a night - not $379.
Melissa argued with me when I gave her a courtesy call to let her know I had vacated the studio. I would not recommend the studio. "
1571230,31491071,2015-05-05,32168314,Chelsey,"Melissa was very responsive and accommodating! She made sure that my friends and I had everything we needed including things like a parking space or extra towels. Melissa consistently maintained a friendly and professional demeanor. The room itself did the job, the bed comfortably fits two and the couch comfortably fits one. Also if you're not afraid of sleeping on a floor, theres room there and its not too bad. The only setback to this room is that if you are trying to stay up late with friends, you have to be quiet and considerate of the person sharing the wall in the room next door. If you are an early sleeper or keep it quiet during later hours then you'll be good! The neighborhood is near a lot of late night spots and very walkable. Would definitely stay anywhere hosted by Melissa again."
1571230,32938064,2015-05-23,33537515,Chuhan,This apartment has great location and is nice and pretty for two people living. We enjoyed our stay here.
1571230,36518640,2015-06-29,29949117,Chi-Heng,"This place is clean and convenient to get anywhere you want to. It's kinda noisy since its on the first floor right next to the Brooklyn Ave. especially in the mid night on weekend. I wasn't able to get a good sleep sometimes, if you are the person who need quiet place to sleep, this might not be your top choice. And also It's kind of hot inside the apt too may need a fan."
1571230,38871237,2015-07-19,9009347,Benjamin,"Melissa maintains very professional interactions and the listing is true to its images and description. The building is very quiet and convenient to UW as well as all of the buses in that area (not to mention the new light rail station once it opens).

I would consider staying here, or at one of Melissa's other listings on future trips.

A few considerations:
First, the building (like almost all residences in Seattle) has no AC, and seems reasonably well insulated. Except in summer, this is probably great, but in a heatwave it can be unpleasant. If you expect  hot conditions, be sure to ask Melissa about a fan in advance (I asked while I was there and she looked but most places were sold out). It does cool off after the sun sets if you have the windows open.

Second, the residents of the building are quiet, but it is not a residential neighborhood and there is sometimes larger vehicle traffic. This didn't bother me, but a light/late sleeper may have trouble."
1571230,40771505,2015-08-02,36840402,Daisoon,"The apartment is quit old. But, the location is very convenient. 
I had some troubles related to the Internet, which causes serious problems for me. But, I believe that it will not be happen again."
1571230,41170013,2015-08-04,23109199,Linnea,"Great apt. and location to the university. This would suit people under 30 yrs who do not need a solid night sleep. Also if it is above 80 in Seattle make sure you request a fan very far in advance. It was 95 in the room thanks to phone app. No breeze in Seattle so opening the window does not help, esp. West facing as the sun is pouring in and the noise outside is loud so you cannot sleep with the window open. A fan arrived at 4pm the 2nd day in box for me to assemble. The owner then made a surprise visit that night with an assembled fan. We could not check in until 6:45pm a huge inconvenience. Again, if your a young adult seeking a clean apt. in the UW area it is probably perfect."
1571230,42147415,2015-08-11,32209604,Valerie,"This particular unit is quite small, which I knew going in. The price point is great and the location is as well. I loved Seattle and it was very easy to get around that city. I did not have much of a budget for this trip so we decided to stay here, which was a low price point and have a friend sleep on the pull-out sofa. Even though I specifically requested Melissa provide enough towels and bedding to accommodate three people, the items were not there when we arrived.  Friday night we had to strip apart the bed to ensure our friend had a sheet for the couch. And the next morning, I used t-shirts as towels. She did deliver the items on Saturday but I was very frustrated that they were not there as previously asked. Her communication is not the best. I had asked if there was a place we could stash our luggage before we could check in. She did not confirm until 12 hours before our trip. It made it hard to plan. When I arrived, it was like she had no recollection of this previous arrangement and it took some doing to get in the building. I did appreciate that it worked out. Also, she claims it to be a quiet building. What she means is, you have to be very quiet because people in the unit next to you can hear your every move and you can hear their's.  I heard the man next to us chatting with his xbox and blasting Christian rock well into the night (well, he was probably playing it at a perfectly normal volume, but again, you can hear everything).  Also, this unit is on the bottom floor so you can absolutely hear people out on the street and every word of their conversation.  There are barely any amenities included in this unit. I had to buy hand soap and I left it there for the next tenant. Pu-rel is not hand soap. We also had to arrange specially to get an iron, but there was never an ironing board. I would not recommend this place, but hey, you get what you pay for. It was cheap (for Seattle)."
1571230,43573323,2015-08-20,34392295,Daniel,"We had a very nice stay.  The apartment is like a dorm room.  It is not for everyone, but more than adequate for an affordable place to sleep and cleanup.  Melissa quickly responded to our only request.  The area is not the nicest part of Seattle, but we walked at night and never felt unsafe.  There are several good places to eat in walking distance.  Buses to other locations are very convenient, run frequently and are inexpensive.  A bus ride to downtown and popular tourist sites is about 20 minutes.  I can see where the apartment might be noisy.  The windows are right above the sidewalk, so you can hear conversations of people walking by.  But we closed the windows at night and did not have any issues with noise."
1571230,47734576,2015-09-21,41761801,Vincent,Stayed for one month and had a fantastic time. Room was very clean and quiet.  Melissa was very attentive and went out of her way to help me with mail service. 
1571230,51981616,2015-10-25,26925741,Ashley,Melissa was very helpful and responded quickly to our request. Would book there again!
4121334,30658395,2015-04-26,21729431,Chris,"Chris's was perfect for our long stay, and the location is amazing.  It's within a few blocks of the best West Seattle has to offer and a direct shot bus to downtown.  Chris was an amazing host and was incredibly accommodating."
4121334,34723456,2015-06-11,33620682,Casandra,"Was made to feel welcome as soon as I arrived, actually before I arrived. Great place for one person or a couple, perfect location and Chris was so friendly and opened up his house as my home away from home.I "
4121334,40150287,2015-07-28,787226,Sophie,"I had wonderful stay at Chris's townhome in west Seattle! Chris was very responsive to all my messages prior to arrival. He was very helpful with directions and recommendations. It was lovely of him to leave a bottle of wine for us to enjoy on my first birthday night in! The house was very warm and cozy. It was pleasantly decorated and clean as pictured. It was equipped with all the essentials you'd need for an evening in or you can choose to walk over the the next block where there are plenty of restaurants, bars and shops to explore. The Sunday farmer market was a real treat to try some of the best local cuisines and Washington fruits! The location was overall great. It wasn't too far from central Seattle. You could easily uber around. Really wished I had more time in Seattle because there's so many things nearby to explore! High recommend Chris's place. Would most likely stay again if I ever return! :)"
4121334,44110757,2015-08-24,34190701,Jessica,"Great townhouse, great neighborhood, great host!! Thanks Chris! Lane and I enjoyed our stay very much, as did the two pups. So appreciative to find a lovely place that is so dog friendly. We will be back!"
4121334,45309632,2015-09-01,28169573,Michael,"My two brothers and I stayed at Chris' townhouse during PAX Prime this summer, and although much of our time was spent downtown away from the place we were quite impressed by the accomodation. Chris was very friendly and gave us helpful instructions. The townhome was clean, chic and well furnished. Would highly recommend this place to a friend. Thanks Chris!"
4121334,54274933,2015-11-17,39551674,Jon,"The listing description is accurate. Cozy, well-stocked townhouse that is in a great location for the local coffee shops, restaurants, and the local farmer's market. Access to the townhouse was a breeze and the owner made us feel welcome in all communication. The parking is a bit tight but that's part of being in the city. If you aren't used to urban/small house living, this townhouse comes as a bit of a surprise but is overall a great place to stay when visiting West Seattle and/or the downtown area. Would definitely stay here again!"
4121334,54904287,2015-11-25,4705764,Dl,Had a great stay in West Seattle at Chris's place. Cozy condo with street parking was conveniently located. My dog Rusty and I had a great stay. 
4121334,56271594,2015-12-11,46567270,Tyler,This place was exactly what we were looking for. A delightful full house very close to everything we could have wanted. The amenities were above and beyond and the stay was very enjoyable overall. 
4121334,56577685,2015-12-14,33591818,Rebecca S.,Awesome place. Clean and nice. Location is great and near by downtown. 
1200829,7208845,2013-09-10,8494918,Heidi,"The condo was new, clean, and efficient.  The best part of the condo was the location - it is within walking distance to the water, great restaurants, and downtown shopping centers.  Although the lack of air conditioning was not ideal, since it was an unseasonably warm weekend, there were numerous fans provided to aid circulation throughout the unit.  Overall, it was a great stay!"
1200829,8704985,2013-11-12,9507798,Heather,The apartment was clean and comfortable. The arrival process is well planned and flawless.  The neighborhood is perfect to wander about with plenty of restaurants and activities. It's also close enough to walk downtown and to the waterfront.  
1200829,10083706,2014-01-29,2514716,Kathy,"Our rental with Darik in Belltown was amazing.  Probably one of the best Air BnB experiences I have had to date.  Check in/Check out were seamless and easy.  They even allowed us to check in much earlier than normal because the place wasn't rented the night before.  Every time I called the office someone answered, (no automated voicemail baloney), and every single person I spoke with was extremely nice and helpful.  In addition to the place being even better than the pictures, Darik's company also provides a ton of info and advice on what to check out in Seattle.  If and when I come back to Seattle, I will absolutely book one of Darik's places again."
1200829,10693788,2014-03-03,8804469,Kaitlin,Check in and out were incredibly easy and the location could not have been better. Overall a great experience and wouldn't have asked for anything different. Thanks!
1200829,14123356,2014-06-12,14892393,Mindy,Great location!! Walking distance to pretty much all downtown Seattle. Easy check in and checkout process. Clean apartment and nice quiet bedroom.
1200829,18485673,2014-08-27,18887593,Jennifer,"This is a condo managed by a property management firm, so i didn't have any direct contact with an owner per se.  However the check in process was smooth and when i couldn't find the towels, the person who answers the emails got back to me very quickly (they were in the drier, the one place i didn't think to look).  The location of the property is great, easily walking distance to major Seattle sites. Also, parking included which is KEY. The rooftop seating area with grill is also great for cooking up anything you picked up to eat at Pike Place market.  I didn't try the gym but it did look good/clean.  The only slightly negative comment i would leave is that the place is TINY. The photos make it look larger than it really is. But that didn't really matter as we were hardly there anyways."
1200829,20005531,2014-09-22,8221920,Anders,"This listing really is fantastic. The whole stay, from booking to check-out, is so smooth and professionally managed, and the flat itself is very well presented, very comfortable, and with all amenities as advertised. We loved the location in the buzzing Belltown area of town, with so many sights, bars, restaurants and shopping opportunities within walking distance. Just be aware that the area changes character once the sun sets, and can come across as a bit seedier the darker it gets (it didn't bother us, but may bother others). Parking was easy in the large, secure parking garage under the building. Public transport is also available just outside the door, if you prefer to use that. Highly recommended! We can't wait to return!"
1200829,21073502,2014-10-11,10928695,Kathryn,The location was perfect! We were right in the middle of the downtown area (including the wharf and Pike's Place). Other neighborhoods were just a 15-20 minute walk away. The Ballard neighborhood was a very easy and inexpensive bus trip away (the express line to Ballard is right outside of the apartment complex.) The apartment was lovely and comfortable and the management team was friendly and easy to get a hold of. My husband and I would definitely stay in this apartment again. 
1200829,22141884,2014-10-31,8932643,Matt,I would use this host again. The place was clean and the check in/out process was well organized.
1200829,22282799,2014-11-02,8764146,Lok,The location is good! 
1200829,26175413,2015-02-06,3932705,Lee,"Darik was an excellent host. From the beginning when we were just inquiring about the loft to after we booked the loft, he was quick to respond and very helpful. Everything about checking in and checking out was explained very clearly. He even sent periodic info about the happenings In Seattle. 

The loft was in a great (email hidden)ose to many great restaurants and bars. There's a great grocery store just across the street (Dan's) that was super convenient. Belltown is home to a younger crowd, but it's very quiet. 

The loft was wonderful. Very clean and just right for two people. It had everything we needed. We had a bit of trouble getting into the unit upon our arrival (the battery for the combination lock on the door needed to be replaced) but the property manager, came over quickly to assist us. 

We would definitely stay here again. "
1200829,28786851,2015-03-30,5257256,Lisa,"Our stay here was very nice! The location is extremely convenient. The living area was clean and comfortable for all of us, 3 people. We would gladly stay here again "
1200829,29899887,2015-04-13,28194622,Kristen,The checkin process was very easy & fast. The apartment was clean & nice in a great location & the secure parking was a great benefit!
1200829,35469490,2015-06-19,32530449,Danielle,"Darik and staff were incredibly accommodating, especially after dealing with flight delays and odd check in/out times. He was helpful throughout booking with all questions and even some helpful tips about the city.

The apartment was extremely clean and as pictured. It is in a great location for exploring the city. We did not need a car to go anywhere of interest. The Space Needle and Market were both within 10-15 minutes walking distance. I would stay here again in the future.

"
1200829,35814162,2015-06-22,9562883,Jonathan,"Excellent location. We walked everywhere very easily. The apartments are in what feels like an up and coming neighborhood with tons of shops, cafes and restaurants. For the price of a hotel room you get a full apartment plus parking and a washer and dryer!"
1200829,48836532,2015-09-28,40085004,Kiranbir,"The apartment was located in a very central area. The place is smaller than shown in the photos, but adequate for a couple.

Upon entry, the apartment was very tidy and stocked with all the appropriate amenities and snacks which delighted us.

The staff was very helpful and responsive when arranging the check-in/check-out times. Furthermore, we didn't have to meet to receive the keys, which made it very convenient for us. I would've preferred using Airbnb's messaging system rather than going through Seattle Vacation Rentals system, but it wasn't too inconvenient."
1200829,49360946,2015-10-03,3039592,Josh,"The location is great, the unit was clean and check-in was a breeze. Couldn't have been a better experience, and I would definitely recommend this host/property."
1200829,52419057,2015-10-29,31042147,Stuart,Great location and the apartment had everything you needed. Easy to visit all the main attractions which were in walking distance. I enjoyed my stay here a lot! Thanks 
1200829,53045407,2015-11-04,16274407,Dave,"Darik's space was the perfect spot for us in Seattle. This spot has everything you'll need, (along with plenty of helpful documentation), to have a great time. The apartment is well appointed and very comfortable. Communication was excellent too. We highly recommend this space. Thanks Darik!"
1200829,56661049,2015-12-16,44889710,Abraham,"Arriving to the room was super easy and simple to enter with all the instructions that are given. We thought the room was perfect size for a couple. Everything we needed was in the room, even a bigger size umbrella which was a huge help because we only brought little ones. The staff was super helpful when it came to changing our dates due to an emergency and they always responded to my emails right away. The location was perfect because it is right in between he market and all the attractions like the space needle and museums. We were able to walk to every attraction we wanted to do, the farthest about a 20 min walk. Definitely recommend take the light rail from the airport to downtown Seattle. The tickets are only $3 dollars a person compared to a super expensive taxi or uber ride. Overall we loved the room and its location. We would definitely recommend this place to a friend or someone looking to stay in Seattle."
1223644,5250318,2013-06-20,6790218,Raquel,"Hello, I am Raquel. My friend Shana and I decided to take a road trip up to Vancouver BC and stop along the way. We were told about AirBnB from a friend and thought, ""why not?"". This was going to be our first experience for using the site, so we began our perusal of options for Seattle. Looking through everything availible, I came across Jill &Jerome's "" quaint apt"" and realized it was perfect for us. I sent the message out to book, and Jill responded within a few short hours. She made sure to keep an open line of communication from beginning, with the booking and all the way thru to the morning we left. Once Shana and I arrived in the city, Jill let us know she wouldn't be home at the time of our arrival but be back at a later point if we needed anything. As per the directions we were given, we entered the apartment and were shocked.  Jill & Jerome made sure to have anything you would think to need while traveling. There was an overwhelming sense of home and that is hard to come by, let alone try to fake. The location of the apartment is in perfect walking distance from a slice of Historic Colombia City. It holds a little bit of everything from the restaurants, to a great art house theater. It makes exploring worth it. Shana and I had a chance to speak to Jill, and found out that it was their first experience being a host on AirBnB. I was amazed to hear it because she seemed to be a season pro, and that earns double the thumbs up from me. All and all I will always recommend Jill & Jerome to anyone looking for a place to call home whilst traveling in Seattle. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with them again! Shana and I thank the two of you for making our first experience a wonderful one, and setting the standard for all future trips. "
1223644,5562441,2013-07-06,1556185,Susan,"Returned to Seattle for a visit with family.  I grew up in this area and it is so great now.  Lots of new restaurants, Starbucks, great bakery and even places to exercise.  Went to drop in yoga every day-- just a 2 minute walk.  Seattle had a ""heat spell"" the one week in the summer when it gets hot and the apartment was nice and cool  Very quiet and clean.  The complimentary snacks in the refrig and the Tully's coffee were such great touches.  Internet worked great and I was able to get some work done too.  When I visit in the future, this will be my first choice of a place to stay! 
"
1223644,5608996,2013-07-08,2608168,Bruce,"Jill & Jerome's place is awesome and our stay was excellent!

Their place: super clean and well-appointed; great feel, very comfortable - only 1 problem: their super-sweet dog (Otis) and cat (Idgy) would not spend as much time with us as we wanted them to (in fact, we may have tucked Otis & Idgy in our luggage and brought them home with us - oops!!).

Also, their place is in a fantastic neighborhood - like several excellent restaurants, etc, within walking distance!

Finally, Jill & Jerome were super nice to us and made us feel totally at home ....

we will return!!   bh"
1223644,5986367,2013-07-25,6229099,Dana,"We were very pleased with our stay! It worked out perfectly for the three of us, one couple and our daughter. It is situated in a very nice and quaint neighborhood close walking distance to the historic Columbia City where there are very nice restaurants and shops. Geraldine's restaurant on the corner is great for breakfast, lunch or dinner. We ate there 4 times- wonderfuI place!. It is about a 10 minute walk  to the Columbia City light rail station also, which made it very convenient to visit downtown including Pike's Market. Also there is an awesome farmer's market 5 minutes walking from the house on Wednesdays from 3-7 pm.
     It is very clean and well stocked with paper goods, cleaning supplies and dishes, even Trader Joes soap, shampoo and conditioner! Having a kitchen made it very convenient to make breakfast, have snacks and tea.  The fridge was handy for our
groceries.
     Jill and Jerome are easy to reach and extremely helpful. They even brought us a drying rack to set in the yard to dry our towells when they saw the need.  They are a super friendly young professional couple and have a lot to share about visiting the greater Seattle area.  
     Our queen bed was comfortable and there was plenty of hanging space for our clothes.  The single couch sleeper was very comfortable also, according to our daughter. The shower was excellent with plenty of hot water.
     We had a great 8 nights there and would love to stay with them again. Highly recommended!"
1223644,6343744,2013-08-09,6810705,Michael,Jill & Jerome are awesome hosts and super friendly! The appartment is really cosy and offers everything you need for a great stay. The location is also super convenient as the lightrail station is very close. We would definitely recomment this place. 
1223644,6585039,2013-08-18,1755177,Robin,"Our experience was so fun and restful! We found the apartment comfortable, the neighborhood wonderful and our hosts helpful, prompt, and available without being intrusive. It was great to walk a block and half down the street to a lively, ethnically diverse neighborhood with a view (on a clear day) of Mt. Rainier. I'm just delighted that Jill and Jerome have this sweet little place available for folks like us!"
1223644,6711355,2013-08-22,3164132,Hannes,"We are glad Jill and Jerome share their very nice souterrain apartment in a beautiful Columbia City neighborhood. Delicious breakfast and dinner opportunities are within short walking range, Seward park is nearby, and downtown is a short drive. The hosts are very friendly and hospitable, encouraging us to use their back yard and even letting us use their back patio. Jill and Jerome were also very helpful in finding the best grocery shopping in the area and helped us decide which of the many great places to visit in Seattle. On our next trip to this beautiful city we would definitely love to stay here again! "
1223644,6882479,2013-08-28,5360650,Valentina,"What a nice apartment for travelers. The first time after long traveling that we could cook dinner. The place was very clean, good citchen and bathroom. We loved the dog and the cat.
Jill & Jerome we're lovely. They explained us everything, helped us if we needed something. We would like to come back.

1223644,6982366,2013-09-02,4549254,Lynette,"Jill and Jerome's was perfect for us. We didn't get a chance to meet them in our quick 2 night stay, but had no problems getting in or out. And we appreciated the coffee and other items to help us settle in quickly. We'll likely be back next time we're in Seattle visiting!"
1223644,7420257,2013-09-19,8477533,Ryan,We stayed in Jill's lovely apartment for 3 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The apt was pet friendly and had a fenced yard which made it very convenient to let our dogs outside. The apt was very clean and well appointed. The area had many cool restaurants and  bars within walking distance. Would definitely stay there again.
1223644,7626463,2013-09-27,8335739,Kate,"Jill and Jerome's apartment is in a great little area of Columbia city. Quiet area with a fantastic ale house, sushi bar and breakfast place just 2 min walk away. Apartment is as the pictures show. Great place to be with the dog as they have a fenced backyard and a great dog off leash park within walking distance. Would recommend this apartment!"
1223644,7704245,2013-09-30,8442390,Emily,Jill and Jerome's apartment was amazing.  It was clean and bright and comfortable.  We loved it's proximity to everything in Seattle.  The couple was super accommodating and helped us in every way they could.  I will definitely try to stay here the next time I come back to Seattle!
1223644,8966428,2013-11-29,811538,Steve,"What a wonderful place. Not only was the apartment the perfect cozy retreat in Seattle (and located in a great walking area with lots of shops and restaurants), but Jill and Jerome were wonderful hosts. We can not recommend them (and their place) enough!"
1223644,9289675,2013-12-18,10351282,Alan,"A clean well organized and well-stocked space - a three quarter basement with quirky floors, comfortable furniture and amenities like Wifi, a Bluetooth speaker system, coffee maker with good coffee, and plenty of lighting. They accommodated our needs are very flexible and very kind."
1223644,9337087,2013-12-22,4411206,Crystal,"We actually live down the street, and needed a place to stay while our floors were refinished. The space is definitely quirky, so if you're a fancy hotel sort, this wouldn't be right for you. The location was brilliant for us, and we're big fans of our neighborhood, Columbia City!  
The bed was super comfortable, and the space very clean. And the Rainier in the fridge and shampoo and conditioner were both nice touches."
1223644,9877819,2014-01-16,8861703,Gaetan,"We stayed a long time in this apartment and have only great things to say about it and the hosts.
The best part is the Columbia City shopping district a minute walk away.
We'll choose it again for future stats in Seattle."
1223644,10244784,2014-02-09,10730782,Carmiel,"I did not stay here, this space was booked for my coworker, Angel, so this is a second-hand review: He had a fine stay, but was very cold. The hosts provided extra space heaters, I believe. But the main heater or something else caused a very loud noise the whole time, so he had trouble sleeping. I believe this is being looked into. Other than that, he had everything he needed, and was very close to everything Columbia City had to offer. The hosts were quick to respond to his requests and questions, etc."
1223644,10419381,2014-02-18,10693557,Stephen,"We really enjoyed our stay at Jill and Jerome's apartment. It was a perfect location for us and the apartment was great, well put together and very clean. We will be going back to Seattle again and hope to stay at Jill and Jerome's. It was great. Thanks"
1223644,13602641,2014-06-01,7862146,Adrienne,"Jill & Jerome are incredible hosts. From the minute we drove up the street it was nothing but good vibes all around. The neighborhood is quaint and has some yummy food and drink spots - and as Jill taught us a good Wednesday evening Farmer's Market. It is easy to light rail into downtown Seattle if you don't feel like driving, though it is a pretty quick trip during non-commuting hours. The space itself proved true to what was listed. Both Jill & Jerome are warm and genuine and thoughtfully provide tips and tricks and must-see spots. We stayed for three weeks so we had more of a chance to get to know them. Their yard is very green and loaded with pretty plants and comes complete with a very cute cat and charming doggie. All in all this was the best AirB&B visit I could have hoped for and these two have carved out a cozy place. Rent from them!"
1223644,16699641,2014-08-01,11020912,Nancy,This was a lovely place to stay in Columbia City.  The apartment was as sweet as described.  Jill and Jerome were friendly and welcoming.  They were available for answering questions and delightful to be around. The location was perfect for us.  We love  being in walking distance to cute and unique restaurants.  We didn't need to use our car much because of she short walk to light rail.  We definitely want to come back..
1223644,17842152,2014-08-18,16757090,Katy,"Jill and Jerome have a lovely basement apartment, right in the heart of Columbia City. We stayed there for two weeks and took full advantage of its proximity to downtown, which is easily accessible by bike, bus or rail. The location is just off the historic part of Rainier Ave, tucked away in a quiet neighborhood. It was a great introduction to the Seattle area, and Jill and Jerome were wonderful hosts."
1223644,18799643,2014-09-01,17529214,Shelvy,"Jill and Jerome were warm and enthusiastic in welcoming us to use their place. The listing information was thorough and accurate, and really, the apartment was even more charming than I expected.

The neighborhood was quiet, simple, quirky and sweet. There were a number of great little restaurants and shops just a block down. It was a perfect home base for our exploration of the city. "
1223644,19742848,2014-09-17,14897368,Sarah,"When we arrived, everything was just as Jill and Jerome said it would be. Finding the place was easy, getting into it was easy, it was tidy but also inviting, it even smelled great! We explored Columbia City a little bit, and there are a few bars around that area that have vegan, gluten free options available. There's a great coffee shop and a local organic grocery store a five minute drive away. We were mostly out of town, or coming back very late, and coming back to this apartment was a treat in itself. It was very private and felt very much like it was our own space, but when we did bump into each Jerome, it was super nice! I would definitely stay here again, it's beautiful, relaxing and the neighborhood rules. Thanks guys!"
1223644,21584425,2014-10-20,20238100,Brian,"Great location!  As advertised uneven floors and creaky low ceiling in this finished basement just adds to the charm.  I am 6'0"" and only had to duck under 2 areas in the house.  You are aware there are people and a dog above you, but it was so quiet at night, I thought I was sleeping with ear plugs in!

Private entrance with your own coded lockbox so you don't have to carry the key if you don't want to.  Plenty of space heaters to ward off any chills.  Super comfy down mattress topper and duvet.

Only 2 blocks from great restaurants and cafes.  Street parking was a little tight during business hours from visitors too cheap to pay $2/hr at the public lot.  I never had a problem getting a spot with my small hatchback.  10-15 minute walk to light rail and 20-25 more minutes to downtown or SEATAC airport.

About 1.5 miles to Seward Park and Lake Washington, both great escapes in this highly urbanized city.  Be advised, Seattle is a lot more hilly than I expected, so be ready to climb back if you do head to the water.  They provided a safe/dry place for me to store my 2 bicycles.

This has been a pet-friendly listing, and I did detect some residual pet odor which Jill promised to take care of.  I didn't make much use of the full kitchen, but it has just about everything you need to eat in.  No laundry available in the area, I drove to a laundromat.

Hassel-free, great location, I'd stay here again."
1223644,25842944,2015-01-27,24385699,Justina,"They made us feel very welcomed. had everything clean, cozy & well heated."
1223644,26139913,2015-02-04,24385699,Justina,"Very inviting, yet felt very private & cozy"
1223644,28012356,2015-03-16,20901231,Beth,"This apartment was fantastic! The apartment is furnished very well and has everything you could need. The apartment is a little cold, but most of the time it was refreshing to come back to and the space heaters warmed it up when needed. It's a five minute walk to the awesome shops, restaurants, bars, and adorable movie theater of Columbia City and a ten minute or so walk to the light rail to downtown. Although I was pretty busy and didn't interact with them too much, Jill and Jerome were very sweet, extremely responsive and really helpful when I needed a favor. Also, I had a car and street parking couldn't have been easier - free, no time restrictions and I always found a spot right outside the house. Also, for car2go members - they just expanded in south Seattle and I never had trouble finding a car when using that option. Great apartment, great hosts, great neighborhood and plenty of transportation options! Oh, and the chickens! The chickens outside the windows were probably my favorite part of the apartment. Enjoy! "
1223644,30865274,2015-04-28,26934149,Cynthia Dunn,"I was very comfortable at Jill and Jerome's apt downstairs. Everything was immaculately clean and the cooking facilities were more than adequate. The area, Columbia City is a quiet and beautiful area. My daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much, especially walking the neighborhood. Oh, and of course the chickens were delightful!"
1223644,31903401,2015-05-11,4439793,Jeff,"Jill and Jerome are great.  They were very welcoming and have a wonderful dog named Otis.  Beware of their guard chickens :) 

Easy street parking and there are at least a dozen places to eat and drink around the corner.

As a bonus, Sriracha in the fridge and coffee  on the counter. "
1223644,33456182,2015-05-28,31690375,Mario,"Jill and Jerome were great hosts! Location was clean, located in a nice neighborhood and not too far from all the sights and sounds of Seattle. They provided great tips for experiencing Seattle and we felt right at home. This was our first Airbnb experience so thank you for making it memorable!"
1223644,36862375,2015-07-02,26215223,Christian,"By far some of the most fantastic hosts in Airbnb history! The place is great! It's basically in the heart of Columbia City with restaurants, a movie theater, and bars a few feet away. As for staying here- the bed is so comfy, the kitchen is fully stocked with everything you need to cook  and overall it's a great space! We totally plan on coming back for another short visit in the future. Jill and Jerome are always willing to help answer any Seattle questions you might have and really look out for their guests. They also have these great chickens (we really miss the chickens) that roam around the back yard and are the best little neighbors. I can't recommend this place enough! Great price. Good people. They made our short stay in Seattle the best! "
1223644,39315986,2015-07-22,37104730,Donavon,The basement apartment was very comfortable as described by the hosts and the previous guests. Everything was in excellent shape. Jerome and Jill were well organized and provided very detailed information for the check-in and check-out process.  We loved the privacy they provided while staying there and had a blast traveling around beautiful Seattle. We would definitely recommend this place and will stay with them again!
1223644,40612409,2015-08-01,2190408,Lesley,"I didn't spend much time in this basement flat, but the listing is definitely as pictured. Access instructions provided by Jill and Jerome are impeccable and easy to follow. This quiet neighborhood offers wonderful hill-walking and was in a perfect location for my Columbia City visit."
1223644,42694129,2015-08-15,19928913,Miguel,"My wife and I really really enjoyed our stay with Jill and Jerome in Columbia City. We had some trouble arriving on the day we planned due to unexpected cross country move complications. Nevertheless, they were kind enough to stay in touch with us throughout and ended up leaving the lights on for us along with a nice card and gift. 

The area could not be more perfect since it was right near the main strip of town with all the great restaurants, shops and various venues. There is so much to do in the area that you may find yourself hanging around more than you thought you would! The apartment was very nice, cozy, quiet plus had plenty of on street parking. 

Jill and Jerome gave us plenty of great tips along with a friendly welcoming vibe every time we crossed paths with them. Them having us with a huge help in us transitioning into living in Seattle permanently. We could not have asked for better hosts and wish them both all the best. Thanks again for having us, it meant more than you know!"
1223644,45379916,2015-09-02,3406769,Brooke,"Cozy retreat in a lovely, historic part of the city! We were in town for a convention and didn't have much time for exploring, so it was nice to have just a short walk down to great food and coffee. Light rail is just a bit further, so there's really no need for a car. Jill & Jerome were great hosts, with a beautiful space that covered every need we had. Will definitely stay here again on our next visit!"
1223644,48128629,2015-09-23,5839531,Amy,"The apt is exactly as described. The location is great! Just a quick 15 min drive to downtown, and a block from all the bars and restaurants down the street. It was a bit noisy in the mornings (water pipes I think) but as described, it is an older house, so totally understandable. We didn't get the chance to meet Jill or Jerome, but they responded quickly to any questions we had and left easy directions to follow. "
1223644,53059762,2015-11-04,18353116,Manpreet,"Jill & Jerome Are wonderful hosts! They are very accommodating and helpful! 

The Columbia city neighborhood is our favorite, so we were sad to leave! "
1223644,55351692,2015-12-01,13528434,Sara & Steve,"Jill & Jerome are some of the most wonderful hosts I've met on AirBnb They made us (and our dogs) feel so welcome in Seattle - there were even dog treats and food bowl waiting for our pups! Jill & Jerome were extremely responsive and courteous, and clearly take great care to ensure that their guests have a lovely experience. The apartment is cute, private, and cozy -  perfect for a short or longer term stay. The neighborhood has lots of walkable shops & restaurants. Highly recommend if you plan on spending some time in Seattle!"
6416765,37348136,2015-07-06,22555879,Chun,Great Great nice home clean safe double recommend!!!! Much better then any other house!!!
6416765,37979090,2015-07-12,3502380,Andy,"Could be 5 star accross the board, with some small but significant improvements.     The townhouse is modern, clean, and comfortable and is in an excellent location.   New, quality major appliances in the kitchen, very comfortable beds and bedding.   

The home is located a short walk from the transit station and it's also an easy drive or even a bike to downtown on surface streets.

Communication with Kevin was mostly prompt and always cordial.   The check-in/check-out process was smooth and organized.

The only negative, which was significant for us, was that the unit is missing many basic conveniences.    No coffee maker, no toaster, no can/wine/bottle openers, no iron/ironing board, no serving bowls or platters, no pots or pans, no hand towels/bath mats/wash clothes.   

After finalizing the arrangements, we learned from Kevin that the stove and oven were off limits.   The Airbnb listing has since been modified to remove the Kitchen as a listed amenity and noted the limitation on using the stove and oven.   I commend Kevin for making that change, as that information will be very helpful to new prospective guests.   Better yet, a small investment could be made to outfit the townhouse more completely and allow use of the stove and oven to make this a top notch Airbnb accommodation.

One note regarding the location, being close to downtown, there are also some more unsavory individuals floating around.   That just goes with the territory , but one should be on their guard leaving valuables in cars and walking in the neighborhood at night."
6416765,38283979,2015-07-14,33479299,Chia Chi,It's really a lovely and clean house . And it's also a good condition that just about 10 minutes to downtown by car ! Kevin is so friendly to welcome us and give quick response to my question ! It's a good choice to stay here !
6416765,38847804,2015-07-19,30231783,Stephanie,"The home was beautiful and clean. Kevin was very responsive and friendly. The location was perfect, an easy walk to the light rail. Parking was easy on the side streets. Thank you!"
6416765,39386007,2015-07-23,33655197,Jenna,"A beautiful and modern space that was a great home for a few days' vacation with 4 friends. Close to Capitol Hill neighborhood and many other areas to explore in Seattle. Kevin was extremely responsive, professional, reliable, and pleasant to communicate with! "
6416765,39757525,2015-07-26,21431773,Darren,"Kevin was an excellent host.  Communication was clear and covered everything we needed to know.  Kevin was responsive any time I messaged him, including during the stay.  It was all very painless.

The townhome is just as described in the listing.  Everything was nice, new and comfortable, including the fold-out bed in the living room which is totally suitable for an adult.  

The location is conveniently close to the light rail so access to downtown (and the rest of Seattle) is easy.  If you're going to a baseball/football/soccer game, the stadiums are within a comfortable (~30min) walking distance, which was perfect for us."
6416765,41208184,2015-08-05,34208827,Jeff,"Townhouse was in great shape, very clean.  the picture advertised shows a little more furniture than we found.  Had a small issue with a sink, but the owner was able to make accommodations quickly which satisfied us.  Location is good, very close to downtown, no issues with parking or problems with neighbors.  "
6416765,41597430,2015-08-08,5657064,Allison,"Kevin's unit is in a great part of Seattle -- lots of parking, easy access to the Lightrail, as well as a grocery and other necessities. The unit was clean, well kept, and much larger than the pictures indicate. We enjoyed our stay here."
6416765,41760829,2015-08-09,9428689,Patrick,Great house in a great neighborhood! I stayed here for a night with my family and really loved the restaurants and parks in Beacon Hill.  The home itself was very clean and comfortable...I would be happy to go again.
6416765,43486645,2015-08-20,33751787,Edward,"The host:  Kevin was completely responsive and available when we needed to contact him.  He handles things calmly and professionally. Grade A
The townhome:  The house is very nice, with lots of room.  It's on 3 levels, with the living/dining/kitchen level on the 2nd floor.  It's clean and functionally appointed, but a little different than the pictures shown.  The beds were comfortable.  There are no window coverings in the kitchen and 1st level bedroom and bathroom.  We got to see the neighbors a lot...  We made temporary blinds for the bedroom and bathroom.  There is no bathroom on the 2nd floor, so that was a little inconvenient.  Overall, the house is great.  Grade B+
The location:  First impression was a little iffy.  The house faces a paved alley between 14th and 15th, and construction was happening next door on the corner.  The surrounding neighborhoods were a little mixed in terms of quality of housing.  Street parking was always available a short distance away.  We found that this was an excellent location from which to easily drive to different parts of the city.  Easy access to I5, and it seems like you can get anywhere on 15th street.  Downtown was 10-15 minutes away.  20 mins to the airport.  So, not much of a view, but a stellar base location to explore from.  Grade B+
Most importantly, we would want to stay here again the next time we go the Seattle.  We had a group of 4 people, and we found it very comfortable, safe and a good value."
6416765,44374205,2015-08-25,9775994,Erin,"The townhouse was very cool! Large and airy, with lots of modern features. Location was awesome, too. Very easy to move around city. House didn't have extra blankets so may wanna bring your own, but Kevin was more than accommodating when I asked for extra items."
6416765,44525241,2015-08-27,34251406,Brendon,"A good spot for our trip to Seattle to see a ballgame and check out the downtown area. Easy rail link into the city, with only a 7min walk to the station to get the train that drops you off at Safeco, Pike etc.

The apartment is good, plenty of space and a nice modern kitchen / lounge. The place is very clean and couldn't be faulted for what it is (other than missing a toaster for the breakfast part of BnB)."
6416765,46471147,2015-09-11,4327134,Kevin,"We recently stayed a couple of nights in this lovely townhome.  Our host, Kevin Hsu, was easy to work with and very responsive to our questions while in town.  The accommodations were very nice and fresh.  The location is within walking distance of the local rail system and would call the neighborhood 'transitional'.   Some older houses but overall the area appears to be in a process of revitalization.  Will visit Seattle again!  Thanks.

K.B."
6416765,46774127,2015-09-13,42336688,Regina,"Staying at Kevin's house was a very good experience, the house is very beautiful, clean and exactly how it looks in the pictures, the beds are very comfortable.

There where some things that in my perspective where missing, there where no sheets extra for the sofa bed, and in the bathroom there where no shower mats and we didn't have hand towels.

Also the neighborhood isn't quiet as the description, it is farther than we thought from down town, and the restaurants near by aren't much.

But other than that it was a very nice house to stay and explore Seattle."
6416765,47639016,2015-09-21,8610208,Martha,"The Beacon Hill townhouse is modern, exceptionally clean and well-situated to explore Seattle. I verified the location before arriving, so we anticipated the 7-minute walk to the Link. There is also a bus stop 1/2 block away that goes to the middle of Downtown, without requiring a transfer. We never felt unsafe in the neighborhood whether coming from the bus stop or Beacon Hill Station. However, I agree with other reviewers that a few additional essentials should be provided to make future guests’ stays more satisfactory. My experiences with other Airbnb stays have typically exceeded the comforts provided by a standard hotel, and there were a few deficiencies in that respect.  Also, while the beds were quite comfortable and the furniture on the second floor is adequate, it appears that the entire home has been refurnished since the photographs on the listing were taken. Communication with Kevin was quite easy as he responded immediately to any requests. All in all, a very nice stay. "
6416765,48187532,2015-09-24,41001381,Rob,"Kevins townhouse is pretty much as described. Its clean and comfortable and a way better option than a hotel room if you are travelling as a family or 2 couples.
Kevin is very responsive via email and gives very clear instructions for check-in/check out.
We were staying here with our 11month old baby and it worked out well for us, I would just warn of the stairs as its a townhouse so from the living area there are stairs going up and down.
Travel to downtown or the airport, as Kevin states, is easy via Light Rail "
6416765,49457350,2015-10-04,347902,Bonnie,"I've used airbnb several times now but I would say Kevin's place was by far the most comfortable place I've stayed and the easiest place to check in and out. But what I love most was the location!

My group and I were literally 5-10 min away from everything we needed to go to, whether it was downtown, pikeplace, Chinatown... It was great! The neighbours were so quiet too! I wanted this place to be my own.

I would definitely stay here again, and I can't wait to do so, and have already started to recommend friends and family to this place."
6416765,51327535,2015-10-19,32689134,Jodi,"The townhouse was amazing, just like it was described. Close to different districts and some grocery stores. I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks Kevin! "
6416765,53601427,2015-11-10,22498593,Al,"Kevin was very easy to work with.  We were a little disappointed in a few things associated with the townhouse:
1.  Location was difficult to find.  Entry was off an alley which was never communicated to us.
2.  Townhouse was pretty stark - no rugs as shown in the pix, no hand towels, no instructions for the TV or the fireplace.  Kevin responded when we called him, but we shouldn't have to call him.
3.  Location is not ideal.  Must use transportation to get anywhere - cannot walk to anything worthwhile.
4.  No shades on windows - no privacy from neighbors which are very close.
5.  Off street parking is available, but not very welcoming when it is raining."
6416765,54151444,2015-11-16,47426601,Craig,"The place was great, it is clean, up to date and very modern. It is very close to downtown and everything is just a few minutes drive down the road. The only drawback was not getting to use the kitchen stove. If the stove was available for use, the experience would have been much better. "
6416765,55381707,2015-12-01,45466679,Janet,"Kevin did a great job making us feel welcome.  When we had questions about the fireplace, he responded very quickly and was super helpful.  Regarding the neighborhood, Beacon Hill is interesting but you definitely have to walk INTO it from the house.  Once you do, it's worth exploring.  Also less than 60 min walk to downtown.  Would be helpful to have a one-sheeter about closest grocery (Red Apple), best coffee (Victrola), etc. Best part of this listing?  SUPER CLEAN and crisp linens! Thanks, Kevin!"
2406966,20079230,2014-09-23,12995225,Bonlyn,"We just returned from a week long family (adults only) vacation in Seattle.  Our trip goal was to spend time with our son who lives in Ballard and our daughter and her 'sig. other' who are from CT.  We were able to find the perfect 'home port' for four adults in this lovely old house just a few blocks away from our sons place and all of the local Ballard activity.    Once inside this home we knew we had made the right choice.  It is top notch.  Very well maintained with top of the line finishes and all of the amenities and right in the thick of things.  Comfy, comfy, comfy beds.  Also, this house was a very quiet space.  Perfect.  Bob was very helpful and always available if we had questions.  We were able to see so much of Seattle and the islands (of course we had our own tour guide) and then return to a super comfortable but elegant space to rest up for the next adventure.   Seattle is an amazing place and there is so much to see.  We did the touristy things first to learn and then local spots for fun.  Climbed the mountain, rode the ferries and visited many museums and galleries.  Even rode a duck for a great history tour with Capt. Baveliver.   Ballard has so much to offer and we found it has the best restaurants in the city.  Our last visit was 8 years ago and so much has changed. We really could have stayed another week to see more.  So of course we have already started talking about another trip with the grandchildren.  Can't wait.  "
2406966,21844085,2014-10-25,21466721,Erika,I had a wonderful stay in Bob's apartment! It's a beautifully remodeled space and it had everything I needed. Bob was very communicative and left detailed information about the apartment. Highly recommended.
2406966,23489402,2014-12-02,1543338,Rhoda,"We loved this place. It was very clean, comfortable and nicely furnished. The living room was sunny and pleasant. It was perfect for our family of four adults and one child.  The place is located on a very pleasant street waling distance to the main shopping area of Ballard.  Bob the host was very accommodating and responsive. "
2406966,30640047,2015-04-25,17380927,Blanca,"We really enjoyed our time at Bob's yellow house!  Our upstairs apartment was so beautiful, spacious, and comfy.  The whole place was impeccably maintained and furnished beautifully.  The renovation was smartly planned out too.  I wished we could live there!  Bob gave us a tour of the downstairs apartment too!  The downstairs was gorgeous with vaulted ceilings and a chef's kitchen.  This is an easy place to call home!  And Bob was such a great communicator and warm host.  We'll try to visit again!  "
2406966,31250170,2015-05-03,31828361,Ingrid,"Our stay at Bob's renovated two bedroom in Ballard couldn't have been better. The rooms were tastefully furnished, the bathroom and kitchens were modern and complete, and the rooms were stocked with everything you could possibly need for an extended stay. The skylights and windows flooded the whole place with natural light even during rainy days. Best of all, the house was an easy walk from Ballard's great restaurants and farmer's market. We will definitely find an excuse to stay there again soon."
2406966,45059657,2015-08-31,30864791,Omar,"Our family of 5 had a great time in Seattle. The apartment is spacious, clean and very well equipped. Location is great, with public transport, shops and restaurants all close by.

Hosts Bob and Mary were great hosts. Always on hand to help. Thank you both very much for a wonderful stay.
"
2406966,47167678,2015-09-16,7503748,Caitlin,"Bob's apartment is amazing.  It's right in the Ballard area of Seattle and just blocks from coffee shops, restaurants, and the Sunday Farmers Market!  The home itself is very new and clean with all the amenities you could need for stay.   The kitchen is awesome (especially if you like to cook)!  Looking forward to returning to Seattle and staying here again.   "
2406966,47620972,2015-09-21,14322535,Hannah,"Bob's place was great, very clean and bright (for Seattle at least :)). The Ballard neighborhood was awesome - tons of options to walk to for a cocktail, coffee or a bite to eat. It was also really easy to get downtown on the bus line, which I would recommend for easy and cheap transportation."
2406966,48866013,2015-09-29,13944686,Alison,"The house was very comfortable and clean, and beautifully finished. The location was great - very easy to walk to groceries, coffee, restaurants - a highlight of our week in Seattle was waking to see salmon at the salmon ladder. We loved our stay here."
2406966,50777974,2015-10-14,44515858,Marianne,"This home was so clean, well maintained and beautifully renovated....exactly how its portrayed on airbnb....very welcoming and comfortable!! Our Host Bob was great!! Bob met us at the house when we arrived and gave us a run through on how things worked and answered all of our questions...Bob is always just a phone call away if you need anything.  The location in Ballard is perfect....a beautiful quiet neighborhood and walking distance to everything!!! There is no off street parking but no problem...we never had a problem finding a parking space in front of the house or just a couple of houses down (Bob did let us know about the parking before we arrived but like I said it was not a problem)!! Next trip to Seattle, we would love to stay here again!!!"
2406966,51523694,2015-10-21,24482295,James,"Our host was in continual contact as we needed information, leading up to our arrival. The place looked great in the internet and was even better than what we expected. The neighborhood, which we already knew, was great."
2406966,52396540,2015-10-29,4307863,Kristi,"We absolutely LOVED our stay in this beautiful home. The high quality kitchen, comfy beds, and ample living space made for a perfect home away from home for our family of 5. Very clean and comfortable. Bob was kind to check in about our needs for our new baby and offered a pack n play and crib in advance of our stay. The location was perfect for us and allowed for a walkable experience with our kids (coffee shop 2 blocks away, restaurants close by). Found street parking within a 1/2 block easily each day. The only thing that was a little tricky for our family was the number of stairs for lugging all of our suitcases and gear for the kids, and our big BOB stroller- stairs to the front door followed by a steep set of stairs to access the house, and another set of stairs to get to the bedrooms. We arrived later than we wanted to due to a less than happy baby, and hoped that we didn't wake our hosts with our many trips up and down the stairs to get everything in. That said, we would LOVE to stay here whenever we visit Seattle and would happily negotiate those stairs for such a sweet spot. The elevation is what provides the view and the sunny perch with peak a boo views of the space needle and surrounding areas. Gorgeous. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would! Fantastic spot. "
835149,3256667,2013-01-03,4485300,Lylah,Alexia is friendly and her rooms are clean -- she tends to them very well.  She kindly offered to give me a ride to the train station and gave good information and schedules for transportation.  She is a kind and outgoing host!

835149,3369657,2013-01-18,2812414,Jessie,Alexia was a great host! The room was super clean and in a perfect location. She was very knowledgable about the area and gave me lots of great advice about what to see and do. I would definitely stay with her again!
835149,3410758,2013-01-25,2322159,Jessica,"Alexia was great - incredibly attentive and warm as a host.  I really appreciated how flexible she was - my flight to Seattle got in late, and she was incredibly chill and helpful about figuring out a way for me to get keys, and checking in to make sure that I made it from the airport to her house.  A really lovely person!
The apartment was great, very clean and in a terrific location.  I'd definitely recommend staying here."
835149,3430232,2013-01-28,4662753,Amy,"Alexia's home is really nice! She kindly waited up for me to arrive since it was a late flight. She is constantly trying to better her property to make travellers feel at home. Seattle with free designated parking? That is almost unheard of! 
It was great staying with Alexia, would stay with again for sure. "
835149,3467842,2013-02-03,4886665,Mark,"My stay at Alexia's place was, in one word, fantastic. Her house is clean, spacious and in a superb location - close to lots of local amenities and within walking distance of downtown Seattle. 

As for Alexia, one could not ask for a better host. When I arrived in Sesttle, she kindly collected me from the train station as I had heavy bags with me. She cooked me breakfast in the morning (and has great coffee too!) and was on hand to help with any questions and queries about the city. In fact, her knowledge and advice ensured that I saw some really cool things in Seattle - she even gave me a mini tour of some of the more unusual spots! When I needed to buy some warm clothes for an ongoing trip to Canada, she drove me to the large outlet stores.

This was my first ever Airbnb experience and I have to say it exceeded all my expectations - much better than other hotels etc that I've stayed at. Alexia's place is brilliant and she certainly is the hostess with the mostess!"
835149,3615286,2013-02-26,4535566,Tomomi,"Wonderful stay at Alexia's place. Alexia is very kind and friendly, and made my Seattle stay special. She also made sure all I needed for my stay, which I felt so thankful. During my stay (over 2 weeks), her place was my home away from home. It was very relaxing, comfortable, and welcoming. The location is also superb. Great neighborhood and very convenient. Regarding location, I was especially glad Fedex office, where I had to go frequently, was located just a few minutes walk. I'd definitely come back and stay at Alexia's place again.   
"
835149,3693588,2013-03-04,5228688,Tanya,"The home was situated perfectly for walking or a quick cab ride to main attractions on Capitol Hill.  Nice, clean and simple room at the end of the hall close to shared bathroom, easy to have privacy.  Alexia was hospitable and pleasant aswell as generous enough to offer up coffee, conversation and food in the morning.  Thank you Alexia!  I hope to get to the city more and stay here again. "
835149,3772908,2013-03-13,4930287,Linn,Alexia was a most wonderful and caring host. She offered to pick me up from the light rail and was very informative in enlightening me to the area and special events of the week. It is located in a great area of Capitol Hill within 2 blocks of the bus and walkable (15 min) to Seattle University and First Hill. The room and house very very clean and Alexia went out of her way to make my stay comfortable. I plan on visiting Seattle more often visiting family and I will definitely stay here again. It was a most pleasant experience!
835149,3802973,2013-03-16,1418776,Janel,"I stayed with Alexia only for one night.  The location is great, very accessible and close to coffeeshops and restaurants.  Alexia was very helpful with directions and coordinating my stay, although it was so short.  The room is simple and clean."
835149,3988059,2013-04-01,3520907,Tatiana,Alexia is a great host. She is very kind and very helpful. Alexia knows her town very well and she will tey to help you with any question you have. Her place is conveniently located in a safe neighborhood and very close to down town. 
835149,4321962,2013-04-28,4577519,Sini,"I really enjoyed my stay in Seattle. Alexia was a wonderful hostess, the room was cozy and the bed comfortable! I hope someday I can do it again. "
835149,4395381,2013-05-02,5822777,Murang (Ron),"This was my first AirBNB experience and I couldn't be happier. I booked the room for my guest, and she was very satisfied with her four days stay. Great host, location and rate. All in all a great experience and I would not hesitate to book her units again on future trips! Thank you Alexia!"
835149,4450196,2013-05-06,5138416,Grace,The place is nice and clean. Very good location. Nearby Broadway Street and downtown Seattle. Alexia is very helpful in everything. I have a nice stay at her place. 
835149,4523898,2013-05-10,6041084,Ginger,"Alexia is a really wonderful host. I love to stay at her house very much. Her house is really clean and she likes to make coffee every morning. I think she is the best host. she gave me a lot of advices about visiting Seattle, and she also drives her car to take me to many wonderful places, like China town, Japanese supermarket, some exciting supermarket and wonderful beach and parks. She also took me to the Seattle Art Musemu even though I had already left her house. She really know anything about Seattle. She is like my sister, and she took care of her guest very much. The neighborhood is pretty good. Her house is near the beautiful volunteer park and it is really safety to live there. I stay there for 5days and I usually came back after 10 o'clock pm. There is also very convient. I could walk to many stores, resterants, and the bus stop. I think I can find a better host than Alexia. When I had trouble to find another host family because I wanted to stay in Seattle for more days and her rooms had already been ordered by other people, Alexia helped me to find my a good host and deal with my trouble for many hours. I am so touched that she told me I did not need to worry about anything, and if I could not find a new host, I could stay at her house. She is really friendly host. I like to chat with her. And her house is really wonderful. I will stay Alexia's house next time when I come to Seattle. And I want to recommend her and her house to all my friends and my family."
835149,4586133,2013-05-13,3459302,Paul,"Apartment was great, in a fantastic location to enjoy Seattle.  Alexia was a very kind host and i would definitely recommend the place to others!"

835149,4681600,2013-05-20,5898747,Ruth,"Alexia greeted me warmly and offered lots of support and ideas to meet my needs while I was there.  Her bed was comfortable and her bedroom and bath are clean and pleasant.  She had lots of amenities available and I appreciated this while traveling.  The house is quiet.  I slept very well.  The neighborhood is charming and I wish I had more time to explore it.  The lack of 5 stars is only because the sun room was undergoing some painting/redecorating and that was not mentioned before my arrival. I think it will be quite lovely when done.  It did not impact my stay much as I was out most of the time and when I was there, my room was very comfortable.  I would gladly stay with Alexia again."
835149,4714407,2013-05-21,5944320,Gina,perfect location. quiet. very nice alternative to hotel rooms! Alexia was gracious host. home is clean and comfortable. nice to have parking in back too (off street).   very enjoyable to walk couple blocks for dinner. would definitely return another time.  this was my first experience with Airbnb. love the idea - saving money and staying in neighborhoods with different opportunities than a downtown concrete scene. thank you Alexia.  
835149,4786264,2013-05-26,4341213,Irina,"I spent few days during this may in Alexia's house. Alexia was wonderful host:) She gave me materials about Seattle, she advised me how better to spend my days in Seattle, and she explained me how to get from one place to another. I had only 2,5 days in Seattle and  of cause I wanted to see as much as I can. It was not very convenient to get to several places and Alexia drove me to one of them and showed me goblin and Lenin statues. It was my last day and Alexia gave me opportunity to observe city and brought my luggage to downtown. Big, big thanks Alexia for it and kindness!!! Also, my room and Alexia house were clean and quite. I had all thinks that I needed from coffee in the morning till paper and a pen in my room:) Besides, I enjoyed walking from her house to downtown all the time. This road took about 20 -25 minutes and I will never regret about that walk. I am going to come back and to stay again in Alexia house:))"

Highly recommended."

835149,5861287,2013-07-20,6033314,Diane,"Alexia was a great host and made me feel welcome at her place. The location was great for my needs; very close to the 49 bus line, which I used exclusively to get to town. The bathroom here seemed to have new fixtures, which were nice. I liked the big, white towels that were available for guests to use. She had lots of amenities, such as an iron and blow dryer, as well as coffee and tea, and most importantly wifi!  Alexia generously let me use her guest pass to the Seattle Art  Museum, an indication of her hospitality. I had no problems with my stay here. "
835149,5954326,2013-07-23,7011931,Leo,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Alexia's place and would recommend her place with no reservation. First, Alexia was very flexible with the check-in time (which was a huge plus!), so I didn't have to worry about ""killing time"" after my long flight. Alexia runs a very tight ship and operates her Airbnb in a professional manner. Alexia prepares a sheet for her guests with information about her place. (At first, I thought they were a list of rules, but instead it was a very friendly information sheet, which includes a list of recommended restaurants in the area.) Most importantly, her whole place is very clean, which I am unable to say for some places I have stayed in the past. At no time during my short stay was I concerned about having dirty sheets, towels, or blankets. In fact, Alexia even threw my blanket into the washer after I arrived. Also, she has a closet full of clean and nicely-folded towels. Alexia, you are great at doing what you do; please continue to hold your high standards in operating your Airbnb!"
835149,6023289,2013-07-27,1334621,Shauna And Sarah,"Alexis's place was a great place to stay while visiting Seattle. It was close enough to all the major tourist attractions but still removed enough if you wanted to experience a more non touristy vibe. She lives with in walking distance to Pike and Pine streets. There you will find cool bars, restaurants, and unique shops. Alexis was very friendly and basically let me do my own thing while in Seattle. I would highly recommend her place!!"
835149,6130293,2013-07-31,1853235,Emilie,"I stayed at Alexia's 2 nights on my way to Canada and it was really great ! She made sure that I had all the information I needed to discover the city. The place is well-situated, you can walk to downtown Seattle and the park right next to it is amazing :-)"
835149,6175529,2013-08-02,6826068,Ryan,The place is at a great location and close distance to all busy streets. Alexia was nice and attentive to all my needs. She knows a lot about seattle and always makes recommendations. 
835149,6264512,2013-08-05,4873374,Eric,"Alexia taught me how important it is to have a high quality, close distance, front facing profile photo for the host to see. Safety is a top priority, and the guest profile photo needs to be recognizable for the host to identify who is attempting to stay at the place. After updating my photo, my request was accepted, and my visit was great. What you see is what you get. My experience was exactly what I was looking for, and I really enjoyed chatting with Alexia. The place is located in a great part of Seattle where driving is unnecessary and walking is the preferred way to get around. "

In fact I walked it a few times, and Alexia even gave me a ride once! The house is great, very nicely presented, and my room was very comfortable. The neighbourhood is buzzy but also safe and quiet when you need it to be. Alexia took care to ensure my stay was comfortable and it truly was. I  enjoyed chatting with her and i'm pleased that I got to meet and stay with her.  I'd recommend staying with Alexia!!"

The apartment is located in a very nice and lively neighborhood, and it even has a private parking, which is crucial in Seattle. It was a perfect fit for me for my weekend in Seattle."
835149,7729114,2013-09-30,7511036,Karen,Alexia was very nice and accommodating. She even came out to my art show that evening. It was a quiet neighbourhood and the room/bathroom were clean. The bed was a twin but very comfortable. I would stay again.

I never ran into other guests or had to wait for the shared bathroom. She's great at providing ideas for activities, and I really enjoyed my stay, especially because I felt like I got to know Seattle. The location is great for access to broadway, capital hill, as well as volunteer park. "
835149,8128617,2013-10-16,9392956,Leilani,"This was my first time using AirBNB, and it was a great experience. Alexia was very courteous and professional - she took the effort to provide small comforts, like an extra space heater, to make the stay very enjoyable. The house was perfectly clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. "
835149,8203546,2013-10-20,9355845,Nadiya,"Alexia was really great. I had never used Airbnb prior to this experience, and I was honestly a bit nervous. However, Alexia made everything so simple and straightforward there were no issues at all. She was extremely hospitable and made me feel very comfortable in her home. Definitely a great place to stay in Seattle with an amazing location right next to everything in Cap Hill!!!"
835149,8263867,2013-10-22,9248648,Nicholas And Victor,Great place to stay in Seattle; the house is located in a great neighborhood and the place its self was very clean.  Alexia was very responsive and sweet.  
835149,8327512,2013-10-26,2489451,Adrian,"I travel a lot and this is the best place I have stayed at for a long time. Alexia is fun and generous, and the room and shared bathroom are decorated to a high standard and clean. And it's close to Volunteer Park - amazing."
835149,8676173,2013-11-11,9795286,Christine,"My first AirBnB experience was excellent. I got really lucky to have had Alexia as a host. She was pretty flexible with my arrival, provided detailed instructions on how to arrive to her place from the airport, provided lists of activities to do during my stay, and was overall very friendly and welcoming. The area itself was withing walking distance to everywhere I wanted to be. There was a beautiful park, lots of cafe's, and restaurants, and beautiful trees- as expected of Seattle. "
835149,8745921,2013-11-15,7678373,Neha,"I really enjoyed my stay at Alexia's place. The room was simple but cosy, and I did not feel the lack of anything. I had the peace and quiet I needed to get work done, and also loved being able to walk down to the Roy St. coffee shop both days that I stayed there. I would definitely consider staying there again - the neighborhood is perfect, the house is quaint, there is enough individual space, and it is well-equipped. Though I did not have use for it, the kitchen is gorgeous, and Alexia also offered me tea/hot chocolate if I wanted any. That was really sweet of her!"
835149,8799307,2013-11-18,436167,Ray,"Alexia is awesome!  The place was exactly as advertised; clean, good size, great location, quiet and with a really personable and interesting host, who knew when to be available and when to give space.  I would recommend Alexia's place to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle.  Did I say I liked the host already :-).  That was really the best part.  
"
835149,8890199,2013-11-24,1146255,Jen,"I had a wonderful time staying with Alexia. The accommodations were clean and comfortable, the location fantastic, the hostess lovely."
835149,8950909,2013-11-27,10054281,Angelica,I had a good stay at Alexia's.  The room very comfortable and clean with everything I needed.  I also was provided with off street parking which was a real benefit.  
835149,9040749,2013-12-02,8315208,Joe,"Alexia was friendly and helpful. She knew I was there to see museums/galleries and gave me some guest passes to use. The house is nice and in a good location, close to plenty of places to eat, bus routes and really close to SAM's Asian Art Gallery. I am a big walker but I was able to walk downtown and back."
835149,9097066,2013-12-06,9740740,Joe,"My stay at Alexia's place was just AWESOME at all levels!
The house is nice, big, clean and has all the comfort you can expect from this kind of accomodation and even beyond. It is also perfectly located in the charming area of Capitol Hill, closed to DT, with a lot of cool bars et restaurants to hang out at walking distance. 
The host, Alexia now. She's just AWESOME too! :)
She'll really well take care of you during your stay, reaching any of the need your might have and sometimes even anticipate them.

Hence I just have a single advise if you're traveling on the Seatlle's side and looking for a relaxing and comfortable place to stay for a couple of days, just don't hesitate and GO to Alexia's place!   
"
835149,9118489,2013-12-08,10181246,Jyoti,"I was on my way from the airport to Alexia's place. Alexia told me that she had to leave her apartment and suggested we meet downtown. She offered to escort my luggage back to her place while I walked around downtown. I didn't know how to feel about this but I decided to trust her and hand over my bags containing lots of important items. I was a few minutes late (~15 mins) to meet Alexia at the downtown location. When I finally met Alexia, I was excited to introduce myself and get to know a local. Instead, Alexia turned a little psycho on me and started berating me for being late and missing her text messages. She raised her voice at me and started being rude. She even gave me a push on my shoulder and said ""I AM SORRY FOR YOU!"" I was extremely taken aback. If it wasn't for her friend Joe, who seemed sane, I would have taken my bags and ran as far as I could from her to a safe spot. Unfortunately, that was my first Seattle experience. Fortunately though, I had a friend in Seattle who let me crash at her place. I did not stay a minute at Alexia's place. I simply took my bags later that evening and left. Alexia rubbed me the wrong way and it is very unfortunate that I paid for 2 nights at her place. I am surprised by the many glowing reviews she has received on AirBnB. All I can say is that Alexia was the complete opposite of what I expected her to be. "
835149,9150930,2013-12-09,3514900,Colin,"Good location,welcome,sleep, shower & parking - can't say fairer than that at modest cost. Alexia is an excellent host."
835149,9188451,2013-12-11,228373,Chris,"I had an excellent stay at Alexia's place and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good central spot to visit Seattle. Alexia has a thorough and very helpful write up of local things to see and do (and to avoid!), and makes staying in the Capitol Hill area a breeze. She is very personable and friendly, and very easy to make arrangements with. Highly recommended!"
835149,9234190,2013-12-15,1918455,Justin,"I was there for a quick night, but it was a great experience!  Alexia has a great place and is a very welcoming and accommodating host.  She had a personalized information sheet waiting for me in my room with lots of useful information.  The location of the place was wonderful.  I rented a car, but I really didn't need to.  I was able to go everywhere I needed on the nearby bus lines (or just walk).  I love to stroll through that part of Capitol Hill, and being just blocks away from volunteer park made it best of both.  I would definitely stay there again."
835149,9263322,2013-12-16,5445478,Jerry,"Alexia is an extremely hospitable host, and her location is second-to-none for any Seattle visit. It's a 5 minute walk to Volunteer Park, less than a 10 minute walk to the heart of Capital Hill bars/restaurants/nightlife, and 25 minutes walk downtown. The bathroom is clean, the bedroom is quiet, and the house is comfortable. Perfect for an authentic Seattle experience."
835149,9386955,2013-12-25,3883818,Benjamin,"I had my first AirBnB experience in Seattle at Alexia's place in Capitol Hill area, and it really set the bar high for all of my trips in the future.  She was the penultimate host, from check in to check out.  Everything was provided... Towels, wifi, full use of the kitchen and some refrigerator space.  The place was in a great location, and it's only a 15 minute walk to the famous Pike's Place Market.  Alexia was more than helpful in showing me around the area, and even offered to give me a ride back to the house when I had to drop off my rental car.  
I would (and plan to) stay here again when I come back to Seattle.  Definitely a great AirBnB experience and I recommend it to everyone!"
835149,9450439,2013-12-29,2246566,Maxi,"Alexia is a very considerate and thoughtful host. She helped me a lot while I was traveling by myself. The room is clean, spacious, and neat. The location in Capitol Hills couldn't be better as a nice, safe and hip neighborhood in Seattle. Alexia gave me lots of useful recommendations and suggestions. She even gave me rides while it was so late when I checked in the first night. Overall I would recommend the place to everyone who is traveling to Seattle. Me myself will go back again next time!"
835149,9713258,2014-01-06,7766120,Hye Kyung,Staying in Alexia's was wonderful experience for me. It has good location and it's clean and safe. I had stayed for 5days. I enjoyed talking and staying with Alexia as well as Seattle trip. I wish i would stay longer. Alexia let me know lots of information of Seattle and tips for travel alone. I can highly recommend!!  She's such a sweet heart. 
835149,9823170,2014-01-12,8312591,Scott,"The room is nice and cozy. The place is in a prime location, very convenient. Alexia is a super nice lady, she gave me a lot of tips of where to go and what to eat:) 
Overall, it was a great stay even though it was a bit short."
835149,9847374,2014-01-13,10014105,Zaw,"Alexia was able to accommodate me at the last minute! I had contacted her from the plane and within few minutes of landing, she sent me directions to her place! Parking was very convenient and the room was very cozy. She was also great to talk with! "
835149,9965633,2014-01-21,505131,Dokolo,"Alexia's place is situated right in thick of things but still in very quite nook of the city, a stone's throw away from Volunteer park. The place is very clean and comfortable, with a modern but cosy feel to it. Alexia is so hospitable and informative about the city. It was a pleasure staying there with her."
835149,10023826,2014-01-26,10616493,Selena,"Alexia is wonderful. If she doesn't have an answer for your question she'll look it up and have one for you before you leave her place. As a solo traveler with no car, she was very helpful and drove me to the grocery store twice, as well as sat and ate and shared conversation with me. I unfortunately got sick while there, and she even made me oatmeal for breakfast. "
835149,10254056,2014-02-09,5989577,Mitja,"Alexia is great! I checked in at 1am, I had 1000 questions, I texted her whenever I had a problem in the city and she was very tolerant, kind and super helpful. When I checked in I was provided with a list of ""must see things"", restaurant recommendations and general info about public transportation. That all saved me some research time.

Apartment is exactly what you see on the pictures. I have high standards for cleanliness and this was better that I had expected. Great location, 2min walk to good restaurants, bars, clubs... I could say this is the best area in Seattle. 

The best value/price ratio I've gotten so far. "
835149,10306400,2014-02-11,9318628,Holly,"Alexia's place was my first experience with air bnb and I was quite happy with her excellent hosting skills. She was very communicative and had a thoughtful list of activities to do and places to eat. The place was clean, quiet and very comfortable. I had no car and was able to walk to nearby parks and busy streets with lots to do. I would highly recommend Alexia's if you want a quiet place that's close enough to explore the city and appreciate a host who is proactive in enhancing your trip."
835149,10354220,2014-02-15,11884835,Jun,"This is my first time stay at BnB, and my first time travel by myself in US. Alexia made my trip. She's so nice and helpful. Tell me lots of useful information about places to visit, restaurant to go; provide me free ticket to art museum, make me coffee, and even offer me a ride to train station on the last day. Meanwhile, the room is neat and cozy, in a very quite neighborhood. The volunteer park is behind the house, you can have a wonderful walk there in the morning. Broadway is two blocks away, on which you can find everything you need: restaurants, cafe, grocery, bus stations. An unforgettable ""first time"" experience. I really like Seattle, hopefully I can get back soon! "
835149,10467874,2014-02-20,11460325,Minna,"Alexia was a considerate and accommodating host! She was always available to lend advice about traveling in (email hidden)d her umbrella :)  I would recommend Alexia's space to others. The room is very simple  and the house is just enough for your basic needs - sleep, shower, and cook/eat. The location is considered Upper Capitol Hill - some of the spots you may want to explore are walkable in this neighborhood-y area such as the Volunteer Cafe (adorable and great for breakfast/brunrch), the Volunteer Park (must walk through!), Joe Bar (cozy cafe), Poppy (apparently a tasty Indian restaurant)...overall affordable & decently located with a lovely host. "
835149,10518615,2014-02-23,11972001,Andrea,"I stayed at Alexia's place for 2 nights and had a great experience! She was so accommodating and make me feel welcome. She's great at checking-in with me such as asking if I was warm enough in my room and offering me advice on where to go around the neighborhood and how to get to places, but I also gave me space to do my own thing during my stay. This was my first Airbnb and I was super impressed that once I arrived my room was super clean and ready for me, there were plenty of clean towels available, a hairdryer, and complimentary coffee and tea in the kitchen. She also provides a printout with a list of recommended activities and restaurants nearby from herself and previous guests. Oh, and her house is in an amazing location in Seattle right in Capitol Hill neighborhood! It's right next to Volunteer Park (definitely check out the water tower which has a beautiful 360 view of Seattle and is free to walk in, Bruce Lee's grave in the neighboring cemetery and if you have time the Asian Art Museum and the Conservatory). Also there are nearby buses that will take you downtown easily. And best of all it's within walking distance of all the cool restaurants, bars, and sights of Capitol Hill. Just keep in mind that most of the popular hang out spots around Pike and Pine are on the other side of Capitol Hill from Alexia's house, but it's an easy walk or quick bus ride away. Overall great place and I had a good experience with Alexia as my host. She's definitely very nice, but a bit quirky!"
835149,10756691,2014-03-06,6651324,Virginia,"I spent a week at Alexia's and had a blast. Her house is very close to the bus line and a lot of great places to eat are in walking distance. It's also very clean and pleasant to be in. I always felt like I had everything I needed. Alexia supplies a list of places to check out and is very accommodating and understanding. Overall, staying with Alexia made my trip to Seattle more relaxing and enjoyable than it would have otherwise been."
835149,10831199,2014-03-09,9622626,Preston,"Alexia could not have been more gracious. In fact, I was thoroughly impressed with a personalized sheet of rules, expectations, recommended bars/eateries/places to see, as well as recommendations on what to avoid. My room was clean, crisp, and simply yet tastefully decorated. The location could not have been any better - that being on Capital Hill close to everything and the beautiful Volunteer Park. I highly recommend staying with Alexia in Seattle."
835149,10958090,2014-03-15,10752188,Kathy,"Alexia is a very enthusiastic and gracious host who really tries her best to help her guests feel comfortable in her home. I am soo glad to have her as my host in my first airbnb experience and the room I booked is just so comfortable! What made it sweeter is the location in Capitol Hill -  less than a 5min walk to broadway and a mere 10 min drive to downtown Seattle (which you could actually walk to for ~20mins). All in all, I was really pleased to be here in Seattle "
835149,11095309,2014-03-20,12440678,Kezhen,"Alexia is a great host! She cares about your convenience and joy in your Seattle travel. The room and the house were clean! You can use the kitchen to cook your food. She helped me to mediate with my  neighbors for lower noise. And if you want to stay at the room, no one will bother you!"
835149,11143561,2014-03-22,4182330,Carolina,"I really enjoyed staying at Alexia's place. She is a great host and the place is very nice, clean, and well located. We had great conversations although i was there only one night. I highly recommend Alexia's place."
835149,11357709,2014-03-31,932160,Kevin,"Nice quiet stay at Alexia's in a very clean room.  Location was good and within walking distance to some interesting restaurants.  Really liked the free off street parking spot that she provided right in front of the house.  Being out most of the day, it was great not having to hunt for a spot or worrying about time restrictions on the street.  Wifi was a little slow but it worked.  If you need a super fast connection try Drip City coffee downtown....spent a few mornings here when I needed to plug in for work.  "
835149,11434717,2014-04-02,12882975,Cathy,"Alexia provided me lots of info about how to get there and where to visit, which was very nice. The room had lots of privacy. I like the flexible check-in/check-out time especially!! Also, the house located in a great neighborhood: safe and beautiful. Close to almost everything. "
835149,11549489,2014-04-07,13038810,Deborah,"I was quite comfortable with my room and privacy within shared setting, and also with access to kitchen stove and fridge.  Mostly very quiet, closets between guest rooms insulating from sounds.  Second story duplex, many stairs, few handrails.  Doable for me, maybe not everybody.  Friendly hostess with clear instructions/guidelines for the ins and outs of being a guest here.  Really very happy with my three nights there."
835149,11755136,2014-04-14,11346699,Christian,"Alexia ist eine sehr nette Gastgeberin, Sie bereitet alles perfekt vor und hat sehr gute Tipps für Seattle auf Lager.

835149,11999133,2014-04-21,12817111,Anuja,"This is a charming little home in Capitol Hill, Seattle. The accomodation was clean and comfortable. Alexia was a wonderful and experienced host who knew exactly the kind of information I needed to make the most of my stay. The location is also perfect. I mostly walked downtown and got there in 25 minutes, but there are a number of buses that will get you there faster. The best part of this apartment is that you can get away from the downtown core for a good night's rest after a full day of work or play. I highly recommend these rooms in Volunteer park!
"
835149,12192765,2014-04-25,9558158,Erin,"Alexia was excellent!  Friendly, accommodating, and very flexible with my check-in time (which turned out to be quite late after some unexpected flight delays).  The room was clean and quiet and the coffee was quality.  Great location, access to everything from groceries to thrift stores to night clubs."
835149,12230661,2014-04-26,14655935,Joulien,"Alexia was wonderful.  She gives you a sheet of paper with all of the main attractions in Seattle and specifically around her neighborhood.  The place is really clean and the room was perfect.  The location is close to a lot of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops.  She provides you with anything she has in order to make you feel at home.  In summary, this is one of the best places I have stayed."
835149,12350444,2014-04-29,14157505,Stacy,"Alexia was a great host and was able to give me some guidance as to where to go and what to do in Seattle  and Vancouver . I had an absolutely wonderful trip and was able to meet new friends on the way . The room was very clean and 
exactly as in the picture. "
835149,12451091,2014-05-03,11274608,Sheila,"Alexia is a kind and caring hostess, we got along famously, like we had known each other long. Her home is on Capitol Hill close to Volunteer Park and other tourist spots, easy to walk around for food and sightseeing. She also brought me to many different places in Seattle, and made sure I was alright all the time.Alexia goes the extra mile to look up for anything if she was not familiar with like laundry I needed to do. My first airbnb experience, I'd refer Alexia anytime. Thank you so much Alexia"

Alexia was a great help to see the most of the city's... 
I had a wonderful time and I'm very thankful to met her! :)"
835149,13473813,2014-05-28,12937536,Hao,"Alexia is a very professional host. She offers very detailed instructions for everything. Read her instructions carefully and you can find literally everything you need in great details. She is warm and very helpful, and it's really sweet that she gave me a long sheet printed with my name and list all the instructions and places to go. 
The house is located in a very good and beautiful neighborhood. It's really nice to walk around and it's easy to walk to Broadway, where you can find everything you need: nice restaurants, supermarkets, etc. The house and the room is very clean and comfortable, and I really enjoyed the night. Strongly recommend."
835149,13545100,2014-05-30,15201549,Chia Jung,"A nice apartment in a fantastic location. Alexia is a great host with lots of suggestions and recommendations for Seattle. If I could visit Seattle again, I would chose her house again!!!"
835149,13632451,2014-06-01,5294910,Asset,"I've stayed at Alexia's only for a night. And I really liked it. Location is great, neighborhood is amazing. And Alexia is very nice, warm-accepting person. She provided me with tons of useful information about what/where/when/why to do in Seattle. Highly recommend it! "
835149,13763805,2014-06-03,15747501,Kathryn,"Volunteer Park Room 1 with Alexia was a great experience! The location was perfect - close to everything (tram/bus/bike/walk away from the rest of the hood or downtown), but in a peaceful spot, a couple blocks from Volunteer Park, which is, as Alexia will tell you, amongst the best parks in Seattle.  It truly is an exceptional park - reminded me of Lodi Garden park in Delhi, India --very peaceful!!

Alexia is a great host - she was super helpful with orientation (I'd never been to Seattle before), the room was clean, bed was comfortable, and there's a kitchen available to prep meals if you want.   The lamp in the photo has been replaced with a much nicer one, as well (I want one for my house, actually). Just be sure to take your shoes off!! (Sorry, Alexia, I was in a rush the last day and completely forgot not to put my shoes on.!!)"
835149,13843779,2014-06-06,1391044,Frances,"Alexia is a very friendly, helpful and gracious host. She is up for in-person chats, flexible, and communicative, which made my stay at her house a very pleasant experience. Her house is a beautiful, multi-story craftsman-style property right next to an elementary school. It was the perfect location for me to stay in Capitol Hill - quiet yet easily walkable to the noisier streets in the neighborhood. The room was clean, well-lit with natural light, private, and included a helpful handout with FAQs. I would definitely consider staying here again the next time I'm visiting the city. "
835149,13956529,2014-06-09,11479966,Iñaki M,"I had a great experience. The room is welcoming, and the entire place is spotless. I love the neighborhood! Very quiet and pictorial. Transit links are not bad, but walking was even better for me. Good food around.

Alexia was a good host and has everything sorted out for her guests. "
835149,14120755,2014-06-12,6948862,Marilyn,"From the beginning, Alexia was always very responsive to questions and was helpful giving me directions to her apartment. I felt very welcomed and appreciated that Alexia took the time to print out helpful recommendations of places to eat and sights to see in Seattle. Plus, her apartment is in a great neighborhood! I really enjoyed being in Capitol Hill for the night. "
835149,14287439,2014-06-16,5492435,Eunkyung,"I loved the quietness of the neighborhood. It was close to the park, the asian art museum, and lots of attractive places to eat or have coffee. Very convenient to walk to either the main streets of capitol hill or downtown. My stay couldn't have been enjoyable had it not been for this great place. "

Alexia was great at getting back to my booking request quickly as well, which was much appreciated."
835149,14891084,2014-06-28,2421405,Carl And Marianne,"Alexia and her room were perfect and exactly what I hoped (and expected) for a ""best deal"" that gave me walking distance access to my last minute meetings at the downtown convention center.    Alexia was very precise and explicit with timing/meeting-me/expectations.  There were no surprises with the room.  Bathroom and towels were perfect.   Parking was great.  I like old neighborhoods and old houses.  Alexia was also very accommodating with things I left behind.   I'll end where I started:  Alexia and her room were perfect for the ""best deal"" that I hoped for.  "
835149,14972116,2014-06-30,7226881,Jenny,Great - Alexia received me and gave me very thorough printed instructions.  The room was comfortable and perfect for my needs.  She had really thought out what people might need in different places and went above and beyond to be accommodating and make my stay a pleasant one. She supplied very helpful ideas about my visit to Volunteer Park.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend this space to others!   I only saw another guest once.  
835149,15140188,2014-07-03,5158235,Lindy,"Alexia was a great host. My flight was delayed 5 hours, and she was gracious in dealing with that.

835149,15610739,2014-07-12,17225796,Eduardo,"The room is just as described, located at a house in wonderful Capitol Hill neighborhood. Easy access to shops and restaurants and walking distance from Volunteer Park. If you are into art, check out the Asian Art Museum. Bathroom was clean and spacious. Alexia was a great hostess. "
835149,15754897,2014-07-15,13780871,Reese,"I was pleased with my overall experience here--Alexia is super nice and helpful, and the location of her duplex is fantastic. I don't know too much about the neighborhood, but I was in town for a craft show (Urban Craft Uprising), and this was a great location--near Kinko's (I had to print stuff!), good eats, and only about 10 minutes from the Seattle Center Exhibit Hall, which is where the event was. 

You have use of the kitchen, shared bathroom (of course), and a parking space if necessary. The room was exactly what I needed, a mini sanctuary for before and after my craft event. It was super hot the weekend I was there, but there is a fan, which provided ample relief. 

I definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for a small space to stay during your visit to Seattle. Alexia (who also stopped by the event to say hi!--how great is that?) also provides a list of recommended places to see and restaurants to eat, which is also very helpful if you have never been here. "
835149,15889976,2014-07-17,12393648,Brian,"Alexia has a beautiful home in a very nice neighborhood. It was very easy for me to catch a bus downtown and there were quite a few bars and restaurants within walking distance. 

Alexia was an excellent host, insuring that I had all the information I needed about the local area and the house. She clearly puts effort into preparing for her guests and making sure they have a pleasant stay. I recommend Alexia as a host and hope I have an opportunity to stay at her place again in the future. "
835149,15944022,2014-07-18,18118111,Georg,"Alexia was a wonderful host and provided info, support and very helpful advices and made it a perfect stay for me. Her place is the best you may wish to have in funky capitol hill, but quiet and relaxed. Downtown Seattle is walkable. The very clean room and shared bathroom offered everything I needed. Would go there anytime again."
835149,16078140,2014-07-22,13761058,Gil,"Alexia was excellent! Friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and quiet. Great location, access to everything from groceries to thrift stores to night clubs. If I could visit Seattle again, I would chose her house again!"

The room was comfortable and had everything I needed. Alexia is a welcoming and thoughtful host. She provides a number of extras, including umbrellas for guests to use and a list of nearby restaurants to try (or not try).  "
835149,16779514,2014-08-02,1118591,Gianpaolo,"Its Amazing  hosts like Alexia that keep me reminded why i don't stay in hotels any more. Her hospitality and attention to detail  is unmatched to some 5 star hotels i've stayed at. She's thought of every  detail to make me  feel at home (even prepping creamer selections before i arrived)  and had very local insight to her area from food to entertainment in each neighborhood already printed for me when i arrived (nice touch). 

Private parking, walking distance to everything on Capital Hill, very professional and  highly recommended. "
835149,16979270,2014-08-05,15539301,Bora,"Staying in Alexia's place was the phenomenal choice. She was very helpful to accommodate each guest's needs and provide the honest opinions about the places in Seattle.   Thanks to Alexia for making my trip a worry-free! Kudos to her. 
"
835149,17175083,2014-08-08,18813080,Francis,"Well folks, this was my first AirBNB experience, and if this is the standard then I will be back for more.

The location is pretty good, less than 5 mins walk to Broadway to pick up a bus to downtown.  It is close enough to downtown that you could probably walk all the way to the city centre in about 35-40 mins.  There are a lot of restaurants and shops on Broadway close by.  It is also not too far from the I-5 freeway exits.

The room is reasonably priced and the pictures of the room are accurate.  The room was clean, the bathroom clean and the kitchen was clean - no concerns there.  The bed was unexpectedly comfortable despite the size and I suspect I slept better there than at my own bed at home.  The room has two closets and a dressing table and chair not pictured.  Private parking at the back of the property was provided.

Alexia is a wonderful host.  She obviously knows the area very well and gave excellent recommendations on things to see and how to get around the area.  On arrival, she provided an extensive printed sheet of restaurants and things to see and do.  She provided a map and marked off places of interest and she was helpful in identifying the times of day and areas to avoid due to rush-hour traffic.

Great experience - I give it two thumbs up."
835149,17349578,2014-08-11,4818237,Ryan & Grace,"Alexia's place had everything I needed. Here apartment was artfully messy, but my room and the bathroom were spotless and tidy. Alexia had printed a sheet of helpful information for me, and was available to answer any questions I had. She is clearly a very experienced host. 

The neighborhood must have been one of the nicest in the city. Her place is on a residential street only a couple blocks from a healthy strip of modern restaurants, coffee shops, a grocery, and bars."
835149,17484836,2014-08-12,19257586,Se Hyuk,"Alexia is a professional host. She is ready to introduce Seattle always.
If you want to enjoy and feel deeply in Seattle. Don't be hesitate to contact her."
835149,17939903,2014-08-19,2971240,Jin,"As a first time user of Airbnb and a first time visitor to Seattle, I have to say that staying with Alexia made everything easy and enjoyable. If you're visiting Seattle, I would highly staying with Alexia for the following, albeit none-exhaustive, reasons:

1. Location - Alexia's house is conveniently situated in Capitol Hill, which as Alexia states on her site is a beautiful location with lots to do, such as Volunteer Park, where you can go visit Bruce and Brandon Lee's grave sites and the Asian Art Museum. Broadway, the main thoroughfare in Capitol Hill, is within walking distance from the house and is home to many restaurants and bars.  You can also walk to various coffee shops such as Roy Street Coffee & Tea (recommended!), as well as a grocery store/pharmacy (QFC), banks, and even downtown Seattle or Pike Place Market (touristy but fun!).

2. House/Room - The house is well-maintained and very clean. The room I stayed in was a good size (I'm a 6'0"", stocky guy). The bathroom is also very clean. Also, there is a convenient private parking spot in the back if you're renting a car.

3. Host - Alexia was such a gracious and wonderful host. When I first got there, she provided me with a list of things to do (e.g., restaurants, bars, tourist spots, etc...), as well as a map of Seattle. As a first time visitor to Seattle, her recommendations were really helpful and also spot-on! If you need anything or have any questions, she'll be more than happy to help. She is also very flexible with the check-in and check-out times. Last but not least, she's very fun to talk to!"
835149,18173182,2014-08-23,17050279,Sebastiano,"Alexia was a wonderful host. She made my stay special with her detailed and helpful suggestions on places to visit, where to eat, have a good coffee. .. She even allowed  me to visit the Seattle Art Museum  and the Asian Art Gallery for free on her Dual Membership Card (the entrance charge would have been a hefty 20 $) and let me ride her bike for a symbolic maintenance contribution.  She also offered to pick me up at the railway station on my arrival day and took me back there (at 6.30 am!)  when I left.  As a plus she takes care of the washing up  of  crockery and cutlery in the kitchen,.

Alexia's home is a charming two-storey wooden-floor  house, in typical ""Capitol Hill style"", with a private yard and a porch overlooking a front garden. She  has two guest bedrooms at the main floor.  The room I stayed in was very comfortable, spacious and bright (two windows!); a well-aired bathroom is right across; next door there are a fully furnished kitchen (with free tea and coffee for the  guests) and a large living room.
 The surrounding area is leafy and absolutely quiet both day and night; yet it is just a few steps away from the always animated Broadway Avenue  (for any shopping necessities  there is a good QFC supermarket open 24 hours). 
There are excellent cafés and eateries nearby.  And Capitol hill is a such wonderful place just to wonder around on foot or by bike...  Beautiful Volunteer park is a short walk away: ideal for relaxing under the sun and catching the  last rays at sunset.  The Asian Gallery in the park is really worth a visit and, if you  climb the water tower,  you'll enjoy great views of the city.  Buses to downtown are a few steps away but you can easily walk if you like (a little more than 30 minutes downhill). 
Definitely I hope to stay again as soon as it can be.  Thanks Alexia!"
835149,18385638,2014-08-25,20360489,Phillip,"Alexia was a great, accommodating host that is willing to go above and beyond to help you enjoy your visit with her, as well as enjoying the city Seattle. She is straight-forward and transparent with every aspect of staying in her lovely accommodations."
835149,18473736,2014-08-27,9584876,Willis,"Alexia was a great host!  It was very apparent that she has hosted several guests before, and had a very efficient and organized system. 

Room and home was very clean, and provided clean towels, kitchen access, and a printed list of things to do in Seattle - Great suggestions!

Very close to a bus stop and gas station.  I found it very easy to get around from her place. 

Would definitely recommend, and would definitely stay again."
835149,18620631,2014-08-29,16162878,Kimberly,"Alexia's place was the perfect place to stay in Seattle, I would rate it better than any hotel. The room is exactly as pictured in the ad, super clean with a comfortable bed. There is a lot of closet space and is generally a very spacious room. The shared bathroom was also extremely spacious and clean, which I greatly appreciated. The kitchen is highly organised and clean, and the rules were very easy to stick to.

The location was also perfect - lots of places to eat closeby, a big grocery store, easy to get to downtown by foot or by bus. Couldn't ask for anything more - it is great value for the price.

Alexia was a very generous and welcoming host. She was very helpful and informative about things to do in Seattle, even providing maps, brochures and a to-do list with recommended places to eat. I really appreciated this aspect of her hosting as she seemed very professional and eager to make sure her guests have a good time. 

I have absolutely nothing that I was unhappy with and would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. "

She had also prepared a sheet reporting all main necessary information, includind indications on how to reach the place and suggestions on restaurant in the city. The neighborhood is 15min by bus from downtown and is served mainly by one bus. The neighborhood itself offers shops and restaurants."

She was clear about the rules of house, which are all very reasonable and self-explanatory, she gave a great information sheet with lots of personalized info and also suggestions about things to do, restaurants, etc. Wifi worked well. The bedroom was clean, well-appointed, and very comfortable, nice sheets, fan if yo unwed, nice bed and good curtains, plenty of plug points and a little built-in cubby desk if you needed to work. I slept really well!

The bathroom is shared, but that was fine -- I had no issues, it was clean, new fixtures, and comfortable. Towels were great! Super fluffy and nice.  

It was a great stay. I'll definitely be coming back when I need a Capital Hill room. Very pleasant, very positive, very easeful, no stress. A+. And Alexia is such a sweet person!"
835149,19695697,2014-09-16,1484875,Sven,The house is in a quite area close to downtown. The room is actually much nicer than on the photo. All facilities were clean and working well. Alexia is a very experienced host. Straight forward but very helpful and easygoing.

She has lots of menus and suggestions for places to eat in the area. The room, bath, kitchen were all super clean, those were the rooms I spent time in as I was only there one short night.  I was in room 1 with the twin and the bed was very comfortable and the room also had a counter with mirror that made drying my hair and getting ready in the morning easy.  In the morning she made me a wonderful cup of coffee. Anything I requested she had -- hair dryer, extra pillow.   Unless you have an issue with stairs, there are a some, I would highly recommend staying here. Great neighborhood and location as well. "

We spent one of the nights chatting for a few hours along with another pair of ladies that also happened to be staying at the same time and it was a lot of fun.

The location is two blocks from the frequent 49 bus which goes from downtown all the way to the university district, which makes it a wonderful location to stay."

Before I arrived she provided very helpful and detailed information and was a responsive correspondent. When I arrived she was welcoming and gave me a lot of useful information. The room itself was clean and comfortable (looks just like the picture). Alexia was flexible with check out time and was very accommodating. 

The neighborhood is really beautiful with lots of great coffee shops and restaurants in close walking distance. The house is on a tree-lined street and was very quiet and peaceful. 

Alexia gave lots of useful travel tips and recommended excellent museums (Seattle Asian Art Museum is walking distance from the house) and restaurants in Capitol Hill. She even gave me a pass so I could attend some attractions for free! I'd highly recommend this Airbnb to others visiting the area. "

Alexia's property is situated in a beautiful neighborhood and conveniently located near numerable restaurants! You will not run out of good food to eat! (Alexia's kitchen is also open to guests if you prefer cooking.) Moreover, a coffee shop, Fedex, park, and trendy shops are located within 5-10 minutes of walking. It is a bus away from Downtown, but that trip is also walkable in about 20 minutes. Volunteer Park, with a view from atop the water tower and the Asian Art Museum, is worth a visit. Kobo, by far my most favorite shop in Seattle so far, is very trendy and offers beautiful gifts.

Alexia is also very knowledge about the surrounding area and Seattle in general. She is a great reference and DO pick her brain. Her suggestions will not disappoint! After arrival, she was able to sit down with me and suggest a few places as well as a half-day trip after my conference. 

The room was very clean and cozy, with a bed, light stand, bar-height table, luggage holder, lamp and two wardrobes. The thick curtains are great for keeping the cold out.

The large house is spacious and shared with the host and one other potential Airbnb guest. The room I was in was just perfect for a quick city visit. Bed was small but very comfortable. Host is an excellent communicator. I found the parking a little confusing at first but the host was accessible and immediately available to guide me to a free and, thankfully, private spot in this crowded neighborhood. "

She was also super helpful when it came to understanding the bus system. The apartment was great too. It was super quiet at night because of its residential setting, but it was also a very short walk to restaurants and shops in Capitol Hill. All in all, it was a great experience :D.

Lots of coffee shops and resturants nearby. There are a lot of steps leading to the front of the house but you can approach from the back through the alley. There is also a full flight of stairs once you are in the front door.  If you have a car, be very clear that you would like to use the parking because there is only one space."

835149,25154099,2015-01-07,25472230,Cristina,Super clean and spacious room in a fantastic neighborhood not far from downtown and UW. Alexia provided many specifics on how to get there and how to get around town. She was very helpful pointing out good restaurants and sites to see (as well as which to avoid). Bathroom was  obviously cleaned on a daily basis although it was shared with one other person. (Also excellent water pressure which I always appreciate!) This was my first airbnb and it was a great experience!
835149,25244083,2015-01-10,8380163,Hyonah,"Clean,  comfy room.  Alexia is very organized which made the stay very easy."
835149,25352866,2015-01-13,22780169,Cherry Ann,"Her house is lovely and the room was perfect; super clean, spacious room and comfortable.
The neighbourhood is fantastic (a couple minutes far away from Downtown).
Alexia was very helpful pointing out good restaurants, sightseeing tours and also gave me great recommendations for my trip to Vancouver.
"
835149,25485642,2015-01-17,14254370,Jeremy,"Alexia is extremely helpful, full of recommendations, and she keeps a very clean house. She was a pleasure. The area is great: the real Seattle yet close to downtown. Parking is not included, and that would've been a problem had Alexia not let me borrow a guest pass to park on the road. Overall, for the price, it's a steal."
835149,25637350,2015-01-21,18057421,Eric,"Alexia greeted me and upgraded me to the second room, which has a larger bed.  She also offered me a pass to the Seattle Art Museum, which, if I had the time, I would have visited.  The house is very quiet so I slept well."
835149,25917014,2015-01-29,4803616,Wanqing,"My stay with Alexia is nothing short of awesome! The room and details are as described. Alexia is really nice and helpful, providing a lot of information regarding seattle places of interest and it's easy getting around with the clear instructions Alexia gave.
It's my first time trying airbnb and Alexia has made this stay really memorable. Definitely staying with Alexia for my next visit to seattle! :)"
835149,26009466,2015-02-01,25803313,Shahan,"This was my first airbnb experience. I wasn't sure about how it's gonna go but it turned out great and Alexia made sure of that! She accepted my request although it was my first time.

The place was comfortable and super super clean. Bed was more than comfortable. At the end of the stay Alexia even asked how the bed was and any feedback was welcome. Neighborhood was quiet but walking distance from action.

I highly recommend staying at Alexia's because you will not regret it!"
835149,26122523,2015-02-03,24858076,Andy,Only stayed here one night but it was great. I had to change my check-in a few times as my travel arrangements kept changing. Luckily Alexia was very accommodating with this. Room is exactly as described and was nice to have other people in the same building who were also guests!
835149,26134307,2015-02-04,14836074,Elizabeth,"Alexia was a wonderful host. I was only there for a day/night to go apartment hunting so she was very accommodating with check in time. The room was exactly what I needed. There is a lot of space for hanging clothes and even a vanity/desk which was great for doing hair/makeup. The bathroom was huge and the shower was very clean. Also, the location is perfect - right in Capitol Hill!"
835149,26287494,2015-02-08,274072,Riley,Capitol Hills is a great neighbourhood and it's near to many shops. Good location and a safe neighbourhood. :)
835149,26473567,2015-02-13,8538352,David,"Alexia was a great host with tons of knowledge of the city and advice on what to do around here. In my case, I was looking for apartments in the area and she gave me good tips on what would be the best locations.

As for the room; exactly as listed: a clean, spacious and affordable room close to virtually everything by bus or walking.

I would recommend it without reservations."
835149,26513450,2015-02-14,27624202,Andrew,"My first AirBnB and was very awkward forgetting how to use keys and such, but Alexia was always available for any questions about the neighborhood and the lodging, and we had a nice morning tea. Very clean space and flexible checkin/out hours. Located in a nice, convenient neighborhood."
835149,26525892,2015-02-15,5355752,Danielle,"I stayed with Alexia on a layover en route to the San Juan Islands. I arrived late in the evening and Alexia was welcoming and provided suggestions for a quick dinner within walking distance. Her neighborhood is safe and quiet, but is also perfectly situated near many great restaurants & bars. For forgetful travelers, like me, there is also a large grocery store close by for any items you may have neglected to pack. The no shoes rule is enforced and explained in detail (take your shoes off right in front of the stairs and step onto the clean bottom stair without stepping anywhere else) when you arrive. Overall I was happy with my experience and glad I chose Alexia's home to stay in on my quick trip to Seattle. "
835149,26945172,2015-02-22,27331146,Burkhard,"The whole place is spotless clean, the room is bright, and the house is quiet. Alexia offered me plenty of advice on things to do in and around Seattle. She is flexible, and let me store my bags after checkout time in the hallway for later collection.
Overall a very pleasant and comfortable stay."
835149,27219846,2015-02-28,12268297,Abigail,"Alexia was very flexible during check-in and check-out times. The room and bathroom are super clean especially being an older home with some upgrades.  There are quite a bit of stairs to reach actual house and another set of stairs inside house to get to main floor where the rooms are located. I feel very lucky to have stayed in Capital Hill which is surrounded by many restaurants, cafes, bars and markets all within walking distance.  I traveled alone and felt very safe walking around in the evenings.  Be prepared to eat a lot of great food, I probably gained 5lbs in just 3-days! yikes.  I also walked everywhere starting from Capitol Hill to explore downtown Seattle and Pike's Market as there was a lot to see on the way.  You will not need a car if you don't mind walking or taking the bus."
835149,27312914,2015-03-01,20360072,Kelly,"Alexia is truly a gem to stay with! Her space is always in fantastic condition, sunny and has an inviting and calm energy. Located in the heart of Cap Hill Alexia has one of the best spaces out there! "
835149,27547171,2015-03-07,27824020,Saori,My stay at Alexia's was excellent! The communication on how to get to the house was very clear and she helped me get oriented to the public transportation system and Seattle.  The place is super clean and comfortable as well.  I would love to stay there the next time I'm in Seattle.
835149,27631845,2015-03-08,28657796,Bin,"Alexia is a great hostess, and she is very knowledgeable about the city. Townhouse is old but cozy, and is located in a quite neighborhood, within walking distance to Volunteer Park. "

835149,27983625,2015-03-15,18262857,Chloe,The house is very conveniently located in a lively neighbourhood.  the room was very clean and has a very comfortable twin bed.  Alexia offered me tea and extra blanket and made sure everything was ok.  I would definitely recommend staying here!
835149,28058667,2015-03-16,23228031,Naeem,"Alexia is awesome. The listing is exactly as she described it and the location is great. She is super knowledgable of Seattle, so trust her!"
835149,28288750,2015-03-21,29486479,Ian,"This place was exactly what I was looking for! It's a nice and clean room in an old style house at a great location, and Alexia was a great host that made things easy for me."
835149,28581744,2015-03-26,29473481,Donna,"The room was very clean and Alexia went out of her way to clean the bathrooms and provide me with ample information about the house and the local area. She offered to make me coffee in the morning and was very polite. The room is located very close to Volunteer Park and to wonderful cafes and shops. Alexia is very particular about reading her directions for applying to live here, as well as the detailed information sheet she provides when you arrive, so make sure to read carefully! I would recommend staying here! "
835149,28702772,2015-03-29,5880120,Lela,Alexia made it easy to get in and out. The room was clean and comfortable.  Her place is in a great neighborhood & made it very convenient.  
835149,28941063,2015-04-01,25750926,Yukiko,"Thank you so much for making my stay in Seattle special, Alexis! Her house is pretty clean and located in nice neighborhood. She is also quite knowledgeable about the city so she gave me lots of nice tips such as where to go and where to eat etc. "
835149,29398336,2015-04-07,10331068,Barbara,"Alexis was very helpful with places to see and visit in Seattle as well as what buses to take.  Her house was very clean and the bed was comfortable with a cozy and warm comforter. The neighborhood was quiet and safe.  She is near Volunteer Park, a beautiful park with a Japanese museum and conservatory and many paths to walk around and appreciate the trees and flowers.  There were many nice coffee houses nearby that she recommended and small shops and restaurants.  I had a wonderful time and would recommend her airbnb to anyone wanting to visit Seattle."
835149,29521166,2015-04-08,11023450,Jessika,"Alexia was a great host. I did show up at an earlier time than I had stated but she embraced me with an open door. (I could sense some irritability- understandably so). The location was perfect, my Uber rides were $6-$10 anywhere I went! The house was quiet but not to the point where you felt alone. I appreciated the presents of another guest and a host that was willing to help me. She even gave me encouraging words before I left for my interview (very kind of her). The room was cozy and the bed was very comfy (better than most hotel beds) and everything I needed was available to me- towels and an iron were in the hall closet, she also gave me a phone charger to use while I was there. I would definitely stay with Alexia again. "
835149,30158225,2015-04-18,29487400,Jayla,"I stayed her place for 3 nights and I just love the place. It is perfectly located. Close to Broadway where all nice cafes and restaurants are on it. Alexia really takes care of their guests. She gave all information about food and places to visit. The room is exactly the same as the photos,, even better. She has nice tea and coffee for the guests. I really enjoyed staying in her place. I am sure you will do so as well. Thanks, Alexia!!! See u again!"
835149,30749767,2015-04-26,20360072,Kelly,"This was my 3rd stay with Alexia, and I'm always blown away by her hospitality! She provides a calm clean cozy space conveniently located in the heart of Cap Hill. I look forward to staying again on my next visit! "
835149,31141947,2015-05-02,306481,Matthew,"Had a great one night stay at Alexia's home. The neighborhood is beautiful, bed is very comfortable, and Alexia is incredibly helpful with planning activities to do while staying. Recommend to others!"
835149,31280609,2015-05-03,20360072,Kelly,Always a pleasure to stay with Alexia! 
835149,31756868,2015-05-09,3029106,Victoria,"Alexia was a good host. Her house is beautiful and in a great location, amidst the old mansions of North Capitol Hill. The room was clean, comfortable, and quiet."
835149,32098036,2015-05-13,26867764,Paul,"I don't have enough nice things to say about this experience! Alexia was a terrific host, the accommodations were exactly as described (and what I was looking for) and the location was ideal. 

I felt extremely welcomed from the get go and the entire time I spent here was beyond pleasant. The room was very well proportioned and had plenty of functionality: large closest, standing work desk - with chair, great bedside table &light, comfortable bed, natural light and more than enough space. I had a great time spending time here mostly due to the IDEAL location for what I was looking for. Under 5 minute walk to Broadway, 10 min UBER to Pike/Pine & Queen Anne and 10 min run to Lake Union Park (if that's your thing). 

Alexia was very flexible with check-in/out making everything quite smooth on my end and she was more than available if I ever needed anything.

Highly recommend!"
835149,32284203,2015-05-16,27088866,Maya,"I really appreciated Alexia, she was a wonderful host. Her place is really clean, safe, as described. She helped me pack one of my paintings, she was wonderful and caring. When I visit Seattle back it will be my priviliged place. Thank you Alexia! Au revoir!"
835149,32721670,2015-05-20,26059192,Bernie,"Alexia was very friendly and helpful. Her house in a great part of town, very close to a number of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars, as well as a grocery store. The room and bed were quite comfortable. "
835149,32771128,2015-05-21,30560279,Sungmin,"From the beginning, she talked to me as if she's known me for years, which helped me to feel at ease at a new place. Very honest and caring, and has a bit of a funny side as well. Extremely knowledgeable about the city. And the place was exactly as listed, good location and very pleasant and clean. All of these led to a fantastic stay.
Thanks again Alexia!"
835149,33061849,2015-05-25,9831986,Chris,"The house is in a great location, really close to downtown and all the Seattle attractions.  The room I stayed (Room 1) was nice.  Clean, comfortable.  There was another person staying in the room across the hall each night, but everyone was quiet and respectful, and the shared bathroom was very clean.  
I had a rental car, and it was a little difficult sometimes to find a parking place right in front of the house.  A few times I had to park a couple of blocks away.  You can only park for 2 hours in front of the house, but Alexia had a guest parking pass that she let me use.
I had a chance to stay in Room 1 and Room 2.  They are both great.  The mattress in Room 1 is a little bit on the soft side, while Room 2 mattress is a bit more firm, if that is something you are looking for.  And of course Room 2 has a larger bed.
Overall, I would certainly recommend Volunteer Park by Alexia and would stay there again if I'm in the area."
835149,33483271,2015-05-28,14481081,Sam,"Alexia is a wonderful host. From advice to accommodations, she knows what she is doing and I really felt she maximized the value of my stay. Her place is definitely one of places you can be glad to have discovered on airbnb!"

She suggested me places and points of interest in Seattle and the information she gave is very helpful. The living environment is clean and tidy. It was a very good stay and Alexia is very easy going!"

835149,33964599,2015-06-02,34383420,Ryan,"Alexia helped me find my way home and acquainted me with the area. Super helpful, I highly recommend that anyone considering using an AirBnB or other service stay here!

835149,35500938,2015-06-19,225929,Carlos,"Alexia fue una increible anfitriona y la habitación era cómoda. El barrio es muy tranquilo y cercano a Volunteer Park donde se podrá visitar las tumbas de Bruce Lee y Brandon Lee. Cercana también a la casa hay un zona de restaurants de todo tipo, muy útil para cenar cerca de casa después de un día por Seattle. A 5 minutos hay un bus para llegar al dowtown en tan sólo 15 minutos.
Alexia me ayudo mucho en mi viaje recomendándome que sitios ver, que sitios no valian la pena, restaurantes recomendados, dándome un mapa y ayudándome a encontrar el mejor tranposrte para mi siguiente destino en el estado de Washignton.
Lo recomiendo 100%, si volviera a Seattle no dudaría en volver a casa de Alexa."
835149,35718903,2015-06-21,32006494,Jessie,"I stayed 2nights in Alexia's house. This house and my room very cleaner than I thought. Alexia is a very kind person, she has happy virus. I felt like staying in a hotel.. everything was great and perfect. I promised to her that I'll visit again in the future. Thank Axelia."
835149,35986131,2015-06-23,36172879,Li,"The room is very clean and the same as what the image shows.  The neighboring environment is quiet at night.  The host is happy to answer questions and hospitable overall.  I arrived at the house late in the night, Alexia served me patiently even if she has been asleep before my arrival.  In summary, this place is great for travelers paying short visit to Seattle.  I'd be delighted to recommend it to my friends."
835149,36213164,2015-06-26,22348632,James,"This location was fantastic and convenient. It is in a quiet and safe neighbourhood, and close to all the shops on Broadway and only a couple of minutes walk to nearest bus stop to take you to downtown. Alexia was an awesome host, and really quick to respond to all my messages. On arrival, she greeted me and showed me the place and spent plenty of time to explain all the things I could do and places to visit in Seattle.  Due to some minor ceiling repair work upstairs, she gave me the option to stay in the basement which had its own bathroom, living area, and mini fridge.  This is certainly something I would recommend if you needed more space and privacy - so please check out her other listings. Alexia was very approachable and one of the nicest people I have met. I would certainly come back again and recommend it to anyone as I had an enjoyable stay."
835149,36827456,2015-07-01,33885152,Michael,"Great location and great price. Alexia was a very helpful host and gave some good recommendations on places to visit in Seattle. I checked in the house while it was undergoing maintenance, but my room and the bathroom were both clean. "

835149,37630135,2015-07-08,6043298,Shandana,"This is the perfect place to stay if you want comfort and affordability. Alexia made me feel very welcome, even though I was an hour and a half late getting to her home because of my train delays. 

The room was exactly as described, with a desk as well! Plenty of towels were provided as well. 

The only downside is it's difficult to get up and down the steps to the home. If you are even slightly infirm or wear heels often, this might be challenging. 

Otherwise, great spot in the heart of Capital Hill near great restos and with easy access to public transport. Will be back. "
835149,38404156,2015-07-15,30564977,Hiroko,"Airbnbを初めて利用しましたが、とてもすばらしい経験ができました。お部屋やバスルームは写真通り清潔で、必要なものはすべて揃っていますし、wifiも快適でした。ベッドもふかふかで心地良かったです。場所は安全で静かな高級住宅街の中にありますが、ダウンタウンへの移動にも便利で、近所にはおしゃれなカフェやレストランがあって散歩するのも楽しかったです。また、徒歩数分のボランティアパークは野生のリスを間近に見ることができますし、そこからの景色はとても素晴らしかったです。
Alexiaには大変親切にしていただき、近所のレストランやカフェ、シアトルの観光スポットのおすすめを教えてもらいました。私は英会話が得意ではないのですがこちらが上手く話せないことが分かると、分かりやすい言葉でコミュニケーションを取ってくれましたし、Alexiaのホスピタリティは本当に素晴らしいです。いろいろお話しができて楽しい時間を過ごすことができました。
またシアトルを訪れる際は利用したいと思います。
Alexia、ありがとうございました。

Also she gave me very useful information that where I have to go see. Even she gave me details of bus no and showed me the map in Seattle and explained everything.

The place so clean, cozy and very organized.
Specially the location is amazing. 10 mins from downtown and many buses are near her 
place. So convenience. Also there are many nice restaurant, cafe and market near her place. Just 3 mins walk.

I feel I was so lucky to meet her and could stay her place. For sure, strongly recommend her place. 

Her place is the best airbnb choice I've ever had.

Already miss her and coffee that she made for me. :)"

Maybe she will join you, then you can ex It was a pleasure to be host of Alexia. It started with the perfect description of how to get to her home from Tacoma Airport. The room was perfect, too, clean, calm and with enough space for my luggage. Bathroom proved to be very clean with fresh towels at any time. pect to have a great time with her in Seattle."

There are no words to describe how amazing and caring she is. I felt like home - and as an italian this is the best you can ask for :)! She does her best to make your stay as pleasant as possible. 

She gives you information about the area - shows you on a map restaurants - things to do and see. That is so helpful - especially if it's your first time in seattle! Info on the website are so detailed and correct. The house is located in a peaceful/safe area. My bed was so comfortable and I slept so well during my stay. The house is so clean. Though the bathroom is shared with other guests and the host - was super clean - with fresh towels available at any time. She's really organized - an experienced host - I would call this house a mini hotel :). I could not ask for anything better. 

I actually had some problems with my returning flight - was delayed several hours. There was a huge storm that day and she let me stay at her house. She was so caring and offered me any sort of help! Things that I would not have found in any hotel. She will do whatever she can to make your stay amazing. She is a wonderful woman! It was a great pleasure to meet her! I will surely visit her again when I will be back in the Seattle area.

The neighborhood is nice and quiet and is a short walk to the busy areas of cap hill. She's also very knowledgeable of Seattle and can help you with finding places to check out."
835149,43505505,2015-08-20,15773728,Smile,"Staying in Alexia's place was one of the best memories of my trip. Her house was very clean! She cleaned the bathroom every day.  Alexia is extremely sincere and gracious. She treated me like her sister. I enjoyed our deep conversations. She recommended many great places to visit, suggested the best route to Volunteer Park, and spent almost all night helping me plan my sightseeing in the city. The neighborhood, Capitol Hill, is very peaceful and safe. There are many good restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance. About three minutes' walk to the nearest bus stop. #49 takes you to UW, Pike's Market and other downtown spots (about 15-20mins). The bus comes every 15 mins. Other bus stops are within 10 mins' walk. The stairs in front the house are a little difficult to climb up if you have a large suitcase. Make sure to read Alexia's house description (it is very helpful) before contacting her for questions.  :)"
835149,43769805,2015-08-22,1171318,William,My experience was excellent. Alexia was very friendly and helpful. The room and the place was super clean which was refreshing after a long day. Would definitely book again!
835149,44310437,2015-08-25,4285146,Singi,"A month prior to arrival I submitted a reservation alteration to stay 1 less night. Alexia was not flexible and applied her strict cancelation policy & asked me to pay 50% for that day I won't be staying. Her communication was not the best, perhaps a language barrier. I considered her decision to cancel my reservation upon this alternation, harsh. I decided to still give her place a try and paid the fee.
She greeted me at the door. She mentioned that she rents out 3 rooms in the beautiful house she lives in, Airbnb is her full time job. She was able to check me in soon after I arrived in Seattle, which I appreciated instead of waiting for check in time.
There is only 1 bathroom, which is nicely remodeled, but shared by the host and the other 2-3 guests in the main house. It wasn't an issue for me, but future guests should be aware. Bathroom was clean & had nice shampoo etc. The living room was being worked on & didn't seem accessible. Had a bunch of random stuff, paint cans, etc. The room was basic, but had a comfortable bed. 
Once I got talking to Alexia, I better understood her, she offered me tea & gave me some of her favorite spots to see in Seattle. Rubens brewpub was awesome. I consider Alexia a hands-on type host that has specific instructions for you while staying with her. If you go by all her rules, it should be a great stay. I really appreciated her allowing me to park in the back. The house is located in a very safe, beautiful neighborhood with lots of shops & on a great bus line. Overall it was a good stay with a few minor hiccups. I recommend her place if you are not expecting any last minute changes."
835149,44473506,2015-08-26,9543905,Rachel,"The room is as pictured, neighborhood charming. Overall stay was fine. But I must be honest. As a conflict resolution and communications coach (teaching adults in business), I choose these words with care: 

Alexia seemed to be suffering what a friend (another airbnb host, here in San Fran) called ""guest fatigue."" When I arrived for 4-5 min to put to put my small bag in the room and leave again, Alexia did a full throated rant of past guests who have frustrated and angered her. I literally wanted to scurry away from her and not return to her place until much later. Quite a contrast to my other airbnb hosts (in other US cities, and 4 countries of Europe) who've been gracious, relaxed, mellow, downright friendly or pleasant in greeting me. 

She told me of guests who do not respect her time, who take advantage of her being 'flexible' on check in time. Mind you I had just met her, a brand new person, a brand new guest and stranger. How angry and upset she sounded was startling. I tried using sympathy and doing active listening: say to her, ""you sound upset and angry right now."" ... ""It sounds like some guests been very frustrating for you."" It didn't seem to calm her insense and upset. Her rant continued for the full 5 min I was there. I was shocked at being greeted this way by a host. 

On my way out, when she said to lock the top bolt on the front door, I warmly assured her that I would do that. She said to me, anger in her voice, ""Oh, I've had guests looking me right in the eye and say the same thing and then they didn't lock the door. Then I come home at night and find a stranger in my bathroom.""  

I understand from my host friends here in San Francisco my hometown that occassionally guests can be nutty or frustrating. AND, a host should NOT be venting about that to a brand new guest. 1 comment might be fine--but not a full 5 min of full throated venting. They need to find the appropriate people (friends, etc) to express their anger to. NOT inflict it on a brand new guest and perfect stranger who's demonstrated friendly, warm, respectful communication and behavior.

I didn't return til 8 at night, relucant to do so even that early. I then left at 7:30 a.m., eager to get away from a host who seemed so displeased with hosting. I trust Alexia will figure out how to come to a more positive manner when greeting new guests. It was startling and offputting to be met with a host who is so angry at her past guests and venting it to me without realizing that is not appropriate to do.

835149,45118530,2015-08-31,21385743,Vladislav,"Alexia was a fantastic host, and the room was very nice. Will definitely stay here again when I'm in the Seattle area."
835149,46530085,2015-09-11,27824020,Saori,"This was my 2nd time staying with Alexia and she went beyond ordinary to help me get settled into Seattle, which will be a home for me for the next few years.  She is such a caring person.  She helps every guest by giving detailed info about Seattle so that guests can enjoy Seattle to the maximum.  I would very much recommend my friends to stay here when they come visit me in Seattle. No word can express the appreciation I have for you at this moment! THANK YOU! Keep in touch!"
835149,47292851,2015-09-17,30313899,Chris,"I have to be honest that I was intimidated by the long description and strict policies at first, but the four days I spent there gave me a totally different feeling. The room is clean and comfortable with good lighting, both natural and electrical. WiFi is decent, and the location is fantastic. The bus station is just a short walk away, and the neighborhood is beautiful. The fact that Alexia recommended me some interesting places made my trip even more exciting. Overall I had a fantastic stay and I will definitely stay again if I visit Seattle again in the future."
835149,48046775,2015-09-22,44163787,Pichia,"Alexia is so kind and the house is very beautiful!!
MANY THANKS~~

835149,48389869,2015-09-26,38794807,Hidemi,"It was my first time for Airbnb.

I had a wonderful stay.
Alexia is really kind. She gave me helpful information about traveling Seattle.
The neighborhood is nice. I feel safe walking  even night time. 
The room is tidy. She provide us towel, a hair dryer, a iron.
I felt comfortable and slept well in this place.

Thank you so much Alexia!"
835149,48824701,2015-09-28,3957534,Joseph,Cute house with a comfortable bedroom. Didn't spend much time except for sleeping. I was content with the space. You're really paying for the location. Outstanding! 
835149,49121443,2015-10-01,30959738,Yohei,"初めてのアメリカ、初めてのAirbnbで不安だった私にたくさんのアドバイスをくれたおかげで楽しい時間を過ごせました。
歩いて数分のところにある最寄りのバス停からダウンタウンまで乗り換えなくいけるのはとても便利でした。また周囲も静かで落ち着いた雰囲気の場所でした。夜歩いていてもあまり不安はありませんでした。
近所には飲食店もあり、滞在するにはとてもいいところだと思いました。お部屋もキレイで滞在していて楽しいお部屋でした。"
835149,49388262,2015-10-03,45000693,Yang,"Alexia's house is close to a beautiful park, 10 minutes walk from another big park. You get to enjoy the amazing view if you choose to living here. Famous martial artist Bruce Lee was buried there. Alexia's  house is only 25 minutes walk to downtown, parking lot is right behind the house. It is convenient and safe. Both room and bathroom are clean and quite. bed is soft and comfortable. Alexia is not only responsible but also patienta. I am new to Seattle, she explained me many places on map. More than that, she drove me to those famous sight spots. Thanks to Alexia, I had very good impression of Seattle because of you. I am looking forward to visiting Seattle again. Thank you again! wishes forever young and beautiful !"
835149,49939545,2015-10-07,1026685,Robert,"The apartment was great, with enough space and easy access to the Cap Hill neighbourhood. Alexia was very helpful with making sure things went smoothly. Would definitely go back!"
835149,50389464,2015-10-11,3849741,Yuè,"Volunteer park is a must see in Seattle, also you get a lot of fun in Capitol Hill neighborhood. Alexia's place is close to both places, so location-wise I strongly recommend you to stay with her :)

First impression: Alexia's kitchen is so clean and she keeps her entire place tidy and organized. I had a little fear of messing up something in such a neat place (which I eventually did later), but Alexia is very welcoming and considerate. I felt very comfortable chatting with her and had both ease and privacy staying at the place.

Alexia is great in many ways. Just to name one: the second night in Seattle I caught cold, I was in pretty bad shape and made Alexia worried. She gladly gave me a space heater and expressed good wishes. I felt so much better the other day (also w/ help of Tylenol.) 

I did many bad things: spilled coffee on her map, etc, and lost her house key. I felt sorry as Alexia had to tolerate my clumsiness... after my stay I didn't dream about Alexia would wanna have me over again. But she texted and said things are okay.

Seattle is a city that I personally enjoyed a lot. If I were to visit again, I will want to stay with Alexia. "
835149,50601665,2015-10-12,36250898,Dong,"It was very nice talking with Alexia. She made me coffee in the morning and showed me places and bus information. The room is very comfortable and the house is easy to reach. Alexia provides plenty of information about how to ride the light rail and buses, which is very convenient for travelers. I will choose Alexia's place again when I visit Seattle in the future."
835149,51176110,2015-10-18,2612875,Marco,"Great place, very nice host. Room just as advertised. Really safe and quiet neighborhood but with easy access to Capitol Hill, downtown and UW campus.

Would definitely stay here again if I visited Seattle!"

第一次用Airbnb，体验很好。下面想到哪里就说到哪里。
当初选择这个房间，就是看重这个房间的位置比较好，价格实惠，房东做事仔细。
到达之后，房东在门上留了欢迎信封和钥匙，进入房间后，就看到房东留的一些指引和说明，所以入住很顺利。
房间和公共空间（浴室等）都很干净整洁，各项设施都很齐备，房间里面有书桌、衣橱。
床很舒服，原计划8点左右就退房离开的，结果睡过头了，房东还特意发短信告知，我不用着急Check Out。
这个房间所在地区是西雅图的中产阶级（富人）House区，所以附近环境和安全都很好。往西几分钟的路程就是Broadway，很繁华的生活一条街，吃饭购物都没有问题。北面是志愿者公园再北面就是李小龙墓地。
最后，房东是个很漂亮很热情的韩国妹子or姐姐。"
835149,53533232,2015-11-09,22170644,Julian,Alexia was a hospitable host full of humor and attentiveness. I enjoyed the location and the conversations we had. I would recommend her if you're in the area!
835149,55858634,2015-12-06,9931307,Nitzan,"Alexia was super nice and welcoming! The room is exactly as described. The location is convenient - very close to great cafe's in the area, and near bus lines going downtown.  "
835149,56440623,2015-12-13,6366209,Dai,"Alexia's place is in great location - very close to downtown, and less than 1 mile from Bruce Lee's graveyard. "
9024838,53423705,2015-11-08,4626228,Antonio,The apartment could not be better situated and is true 5 star luxury.  When i come back to Seattle i will definitely stay here again.  Communication was excellent too
9024838,54465190,2015-11-20,48215221,Shalini,"Jocelyn has been very good host. She made everything clear about the apartment. The check in process was a breeze and there were good  recommendations for parking and restaurants. 
She was happy to accommodate our requests and answered all our questions.

The apartment was fantastic in a great location. Tastefully decorated. It had amazing views and perfect for our stay."
9024838,55232726,2015-11-29,7013602,Sky,"The apartment is absolutely beautiful. It's warm, clean and comfy. The building itself is at a great location in downtown too. It offers all kinds of amenities like a beautiful rooftop deck and a pool table. Checking in and out was smooth and easy - everything was handled well without the hosts physically being there. Had a blast staying there."
9024838,56333372,2015-12-12,46508485,Tom (Toshiyuki),"I arrived 4AM becuase of landslide at i5 coming back from Portland, but had not problem checking into the room. 
Quite an amazing 2 luxuary condo with large kitchen /living room. Perfect stay and enjoyed very much. 
Good for business since the location is just behind the Convension Center and in the middle of downtown Seattle business district."
6304139,34587637,2015-06-09,33207004,Bob,Lovely self contained apartment (Pesha and family live the floor above) with everything you need in a very nice and very convenient part of town. We were Pesha's first guests and they did everything they could to make us comfortable and they succeeded superbly well. We loved it and will be back again.
6304139,35496539,2015-06-19,11699700,Julian,"Pesha was the most gracious host! Upon arriving in the very spacious apartment, we were greeted by a fridge filled with essentials (water, milk, butter, cherries and beer!) and a basket with Seattle coffee, chocolate and specialty drinks (among many other things). Later during our stay she delivered a container with fresh snap peas. Are you kidding me?!? How awesome. The light filled apartment has everything you need and Pesha makes you feel so at home. When hearing that we were from Seattle and moving houses, Pesha and her family had my wife and daughter over for dinner (regrettably I was traveling). Such a caring host. I can't say enough wonderful things about Pesha and this fantastic apartment. Stay here - you won't regret it!"
6304139,36122969,2015-06-25,26179714,Katelyn,"Pesha was very welcoming!  She showed us the apartment and then left us alone.  She left a few snacks and drinks for us.  The space is really nice and open and clean.  Lots of windows looking out to a wooded area with access to the alley.  No AC, as is to be expected in Seattle, but with the windows open and a few manipulations of the blinds it was comfortable.  The neighborhood is nice and quiet but accessible anywhere with the buses.  Expect to hear kids playing outside all day.  Both a Safeway and a natural food market are walking distance.  As advertised, this is a ground floor apartment and you can hear people walking upstairs, but nothing extreme.  The kitchen has the necessities for cooking and many new appliances and cookware.  There is a table and chairs on the deck and inside.  "
6304139,40594077,2015-08-01,3018841,Judith,"This is a beautiful place hosted by two wonderful people - Pesha and Tuyen - and their son, Logan.  The pictures accurately reflect the apartment. Yes, it really is as nice as it looks!  Pesha and Tuyen were always ready to make sure that I had all I needed to enjoy my stay.  I have stayed in many airbnb places and this rates among the best.  I heartily recommend it and look forward to returning one day."
6304139,49207552,2015-10-02,28113168,Brienne,"Pesha and Tuyen were amazing hosts! The apartment looked exactly like the pictures and as described. They left little treats and made many kind gestures throughout our month-long stay. They were always respectful of our privacy, but responsive and super friendly whenever we reached out. It was so nice having breakfast out on the  back patio! We’ve already recommended this place to our friends and family."
6304139,49798422,2015-10-06,18478473,Barbara,"Yes, we were welcomed before we even parked our car. The apartment was exactly as described and was very clean. I would highly recommend this location to anyone!"
6304139,50632847,2015-10-13,41280306,Rob,"Our hosts were very welcoming and warm, while also respecting our privacy.  Very quiet, spacious, and clean lower-level 1 bedroom apartment with a large living room/kitchen/dining area, large separate bedroom with desk and queen bed, good bathroom, and nice walk-in closet.  Special features include a couch that pulls out into a comfortable double bed in the living room, a fully equipped  modern kitchen with all the necessary appliances (even a dishwasher) and cookware/tableware, and a decorator's touch.  Lots of natural light from the large windows looking out at trees in the yard.  It was an especially convenient location for us -- my daughter and son-in-law's home was just ten-minute walk in the same Wedgwood neighborhood -- with Top Pot Donuts (!), Starbucks (ubiquitous in Seattle), Grateful Bread Bakery (great sandwiches), and a Safeway all within easy walking distance. We were invited to use our hosts' washer and dryer to do our laundry before our 6-day stay ended -- that was very thoughtful of them.  We spent our evenings and the weekend with our family, so it was so nice to have a place of our own that felt like home when we weren't with the kids.  Oh, and we had our own off-street parking space right behind the apartment.  For all of this, the cost was quite reasonable given the superior accommodation.  We will definitely return to this gem when we come to Seattle again.     "
6304139,55212458,2015-11-29,18478473,Barbara,"This was our second stay at PH's apartment, and everything was a great as the first time. It is exactly as described, and PH couldn't have been a better host."
3333971,14540383,2014-06-21,8256698,Lydia,"Darcy responded quickly to my request and I was happy to book the studio which she stated had just been remodeled.  I was looking forward to our trip! 

FACTS: I (email hidden) and no one knew where Darcy was.  We were led to our room by someone that although nice, didn't identify himself and didn't ask for my ID.  I was SHOCKED at the condition of the stairs and landing!  Construction debris and dust everywhere and cigarette butts on the carpet. The landings and hallways were FULL of various construction tools, paint cans, DEBRIS, and ladders.  They were also remodeling two other units on our floor.  Steep stairs took us to our room which was fairly nice. The bathroom was clean and the space nice, just like in the pictures. The chairs do need to be reupholstered- Dirty and dusty!  We didn't use the chairs at all. We could smell cigarette smoke everywhere the ENTIRE time we were there and it literally felt like we were in an ashtray.  There was smoking and construction noises for hours after we arrived and back again, VERY loud, at 8:00 AM!!!  When I opened the door to the hallway the following morning to see what the heck was going on... They were replacing the carpet!!! I sent Darcy an email that we were checking out and on our way down the flights of steep stairs (old building so be aware) my carry-on touched the freshly painted wall - ugh - ruined! Merchant's Café was closed and the contractor that was replacing the carpet wanted me to give him the room key. Really?!!  I placed the key through the mail slot in the café's front door and left.  Darcy contacted me and apologized. She didn't realize they would still be working and would be so noisy.  We met up later that day and she apologized and gave me a full refund, minus the service fee.  

I want to believe, based on all the positive reviews, that my situation was a fluke and not going to happen again. That said, I felt I needed to review my stay. I felt HORRIBLE bringing my niece into that environment and the noise and smoke turned our experience into something I would love to forget.  I WASTED HOURS of my vacation dealing with this and having to relocate!! The personnel at the café are nice and accommodating.  Darcy is also nice and I believed her when she stated this had never happened.  I like to give people the benefit of the doubt and she did seem sincere.

How to improve: 1) I think you should know and expect much noise and issues when remodeling - guests should be made aware and given a choice. I would not have stayed had I known. 2) AirBnB should have a much better screening process and much more information should be provided for the guests to make informed decisions. 3) Notifying guests that smoking is allowed is a MUST. "
3333971,14660798,2014-06-23,2497029,Ben,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our weekend trip to Seattle. Darcy (and her staff) made terrific hosts. Checking in and out was a breeze, as was getting around Seattle from the apartment's perfect location. All in all a wonderful Airbnb experience."
3333971,14761821,2014-06-25,13079654,Darrin,"This is a great location and would be very comfortable for a weekend in Seattle for two people. It's an easy walk to the stadiums as well as other attractions in the south/downtown/Pioneer Square area. 

The host is improving the rental, so things may get even better. Words of advice, there is no wi-fi and it is on the 3rd floor with no elevator. "
3333971,14808161,2014-06-26,17153210,Malone,"We were very pleased with our stay at the studio in Pioneer Square.  We booked basically last minute and the host was able to accommodate.  The room was clean, the staff friendly, and the bed comfortable.  The location is excellent if you are going to a game or just coming to Seattle for a visit with a parking garage across the street."
3333971,15113267,2014-07-02,14171492,Eric,"So like many other people that have reviewed Darcy's properties we actually didn't meet her initially.  You check in with the bar and he sets you up with the keys and someone to show you around quickly.  The check in process was extremely smooth and much easier then dealing with an individual person.

We did meet Darcy a few days later though while she was working on another apartment in the same building.  She is a great person with a lot of passion towards making these apartments and comfortable and relaxing for the guests as possible.

As for our apartment it had it's ups and downs.  First being in a older building you have to be used to not having AC and some of the more modern accomendations that some might expect.  Personally, my wife and I were more than OK with that and even enjoyed the classic feel the apartment has.  

That being said be prepared to deal with the street noise outside during any warm months.  We needed the windows to be wide open in order to keep the room at a decent temperature (July 2014) and while the street noise didn't bother us at night, be very aware if you are staying there Thursday - Saturday night.  

Next to the apartment is a night club, and it's loud.  Loud enough to hear all the words to the songs that are playing while hearing everyone out front talking.  If you aren't staying here during those days you won't hear much at all and will sleep well.  If not use caution as even with ear plugs, the bass will still shake you to the bone.

The other thing to note is there is a parking garage across from the apartment and once the club empties out around 3am many people still hang out there and talk VERY LOUDLY.  This was the worst part of the stay and granted, it's out of Darcy's control, it's still something you need to be aware of.

There are many positives to staying here though.  The location is close to many things and all of it extremely walk able.  It's close to the stadiums, the ferries, and a lot of great shops, restaurants, and even the public market.  Mass transit is also very near by making it an easy walk from the Light rail or bus to the place.  The amenities were good with refrigerator that kept everything cold and enough plates and silverware to get us through the days we stayed.

There was also a washer and dryer but we did not use it.  Water pressure in the shower was great.

Overall with the exception of clubs nights is a great place to stay and I would go back again."
3333971,15639752,2014-07-13,770937,Melissa,"We stayed for one Friday night in this location and liked it. It was a convenient 15 minute walk to Pike's Place. Because of the July heat, Darcy gave us a fan which helped a lot and we slept with the windows open. I was afraid the noise from the club would be a problem but we barely even noticed."
3333971,15706219,2014-07-14,17132740,Kathleen,"Great spot! Right in downtown and within walking distance of SafeCo Field and the waterfront.  Very easy to get to from the airport using light rail. Also conveniently over a restaurant with pretty good food and drinks. Perfect if you're being touristy. 
(and if you want to compare, the Best Western is a block away and twice as expensive)
Has a nice little kitchen area and even a washer/dryer.
Darcy was very nice and easy to reach.
Note that this is walkup, so if you have trouble with stairs, this may not be the place for you. Also, like most older buildings in Seattle, there's no A/C. Rare for Seattle to get that hot though."
3333971,15774779,2014-07-15,178199,Paul,"The place was nice, it definitely had a historic vibe to it and the location is literally right across from the main tourist part of Pioneer Square. The room was clean and had most of the basics. However, the host was basically impossible to get ahold of, both before the rental and during the rental when I had a problem with the wireless internet."
3333971,15973971,2014-07-19,11558430,Erik,"Although I didn't meet Darcy, she made plans to make my check in, stay, and check-out streamline.  Her accommodating staff were friendly and helpful.  The studio was neat and had all the amenities of home.  I definately recommend it!"
3333971,16021551,2014-07-20,16857052,Sidra,"This studio was in a great location to see all of the downtown sites like Pike's place market and any of the stadiums. It's directly across the street from Pioneer Square. The room itself was nice, with a washer/dryer and kitchenette. Darcy was very nice and easy to get in touch with.  You may here some noise since it's over a bar and right next to another bar. We stayed on a Friday night and people were lined up to get into the bar next door and made some noise. But it's a city, so that was to be expected. And we had the windows open for a breeze, I'm sure if we closed them we would have hardly heard anything. "
3333971,16721048,2014-08-01,16864838,Melvin,The studio was conveniently located in the old historic part of town. The check-in and out process was really easy and the place was clean as displayed in the pictures. Highly recommend this place.
3333971,16778750,2014-08-02,1822055,Nancy,"The apartment is in the downtown district of Seattle, and just a short walk from everything; Pike's Place, the stadiums, public transit, restaurants, and shopping. It was a large studio on the third floor with a big screen tv, kitchenette w/ minifridge, full bathroom, and washer/dryer. No AC, but it did have a strong ceiling fan, and large street-facing windows that opened up. It was great to be able to look out the windows an see people walking around, and watch the tour groups go by.  Some street noise on weekend nights. No parking onsite, but there is street parking and plenty of parking lots nearby. Darcy was very informative and welcoming."
3333971,17065735,2014-08-06,12035121,Desiree,The apartment was perfect for us. We were able to explore parts of Seattle in the car during the day and park for free near the apartment at night (parking was free on the streets after 6).  The room was cozy & private. We easily grabbed some delicious dinner and breakfast from some area restaurants. It was a fun experience.
3333971,17360406,2014-08-11,17428727,Corey,"Sadly we never met Darcy, but the staff of people in the café downstairs were very helpful. Historic building within walking distance of many great locations in Seattle. Not only did we enjoy the location and history, but the price for that location was incredible. Thanks for the hospitality and we will surely consider this spot once again if in Seattle. Based on the location, if you plan to stay in the city, I don't recommend a car."
3333971,17444218,2014-08-12,16964848,Cheryl,Great location right across from Pioneer Square - walkable to downtown as well as the stadiums. It is a little noisy as we had to leave the windows open at night due to the summer heat. Free parking on street which was a bonus. Darcy was quick to respond to email inquiries and her staff at the restaurant below were great in helping us get up to the room. 
3333971,17651497,2014-08-15,13717240,Rob,"The place was in a great location depending on how you can handle noise. In order to gain access to the space, I needed to meet the bartender in the downstairs restaurant who gave me access to the building and the keys to the space. At first I thought the idea of this would be an issue but it turned out to be no problem. The space itself is in a very old building (unit looked modern), but cool and with a lot of history. The noise outside was a bit much with the windows open (no ac) but at night it turned out to be totally fine. The bed was pretty comfortable, kitchen and bathroom well equipped. There was no iron or ironing board, unless it was stowed away somewhere difficult to find - but I didn't want to bug the bartender again during peak hours so tumbled it somewhat unwrinkled. 

All in all, I would recommend this place, good location, interesting building, almost everything you need."
3333971,17756348,2014-08-17,12222319,Lushi,"It was a great pleasure to meet Darcy. She is funny and open-minded. Both my friend and I like her a lot even though we only met once. The place was very suitable for a couple I would say, and the bed was very comfortable. The only one thing that made me a little bit crazy was the noise from the club downstairs. It was annoying to be honest... But if you were too tired after traveling around in Seattle, that would not bother you at all. haha. I spent a wonderful time in Seattle thanks to Darcy!
"
3333971,17846089,2014-08-18,17616798,Rachel,Darcy's place was perfectly located--easy to get to and close to everything downtown we wanted to see! Darcy was amazingly accommodating and her apartment was really charming. We would definitely stay with her again!
3333971,18180576,2014-08-23,17981358,Margaret,"We really enjoyed our stay here at the Pioneer Square historic studio apartment.  We took Amtrak from Portland to Seattle and were pleased that we could walk the four short blocks from the train station to our room.   There was a slight delay in finding the person who could get us our key, but it wasn't a major inconvenience.  The room was clean, good size and had everything we needed.  No noise problem with the bar below, but we there only during weekdays.  Very convenient to the bus stop across the street in Pioneer Square.  Even the two flights of stairs up to our room was manageable, even when I had just had knee surgery a month earlier.  Only negative was the difficulty in getting reliable internet service -- buy maybe that can be fixed.  Overall -- a great stay!  We even could walk to the light rail station two blocks away to catch the local train to the airport for the next stop on our vacation."
3333971,18244661,2014-08-24,2852834,Ahm,"check-in was extremely easy in the bar below the apartment. studio was nicely decorated, clean, and very, very spacious. darcy helped out with parking and offered to let us stay as long as we wanted the next day, plus use her parking pass, which was very generous of her. really cool old building if you are into that kind of thing."
3333971,18482106,2014-08-27,687849,Jack And Sharon,Darcy was a great host.  Interesting historic building and neighborhood.  Make sure to take the (website hidden) tour if you have a free hour.
3333971,19126012,2014-09-07,17428385,Thuy,"This historic apartment is clean, comfortable, charming and romantic. Check-in is very easy ((email hidden) downstairs). We met the owner, Darcy, who is very sweet and caring. Check-out is even easier. The mattress was more comfortable than nearly any place we have stayed, and the bedding is soft with good thread count. The pillows feel perfect. Bathroom has a very bright heat lamp, a great showerhead, and lots of extra towels. Washer and dryer work great.

This apartment is on the third floor, so the wi-fi signal didn't reach us. It was a blessing actually.. we just went down the hallway a bit or sat on the stairs whenever we needed to do internet things. I discovered I was having a much more restful vacation when I couldn't facebook in bed or obsess about news stories about ebola. Maybe not the best situation for a business traveler who requires wi-fi in the room, but this was perfect for us. 

The apartment building itself is very quiet and secure. Keep in mind though this is 5-10 min walk from the heart of downtown, with all the diverse experiences a neighborhood like this would entail... tour groups during the day, buskers, ""interesting"" people stumbling around, the occasional siren, and the dance club located on the same block. It's lively and interesting during the day, and at night we just made sure to use common sense and be cautious if we were out late. 

The Merchant's Cafe building is supposedly haunted (the owner even brought in an exorcist)... We didn't experience anything paranormal :) We just had a great time and a restful stay, and we highly recommend this place."
3333971,19229476,2014-09-08,3058917,Lindsay,"This was a good place to stay! Like the other reviews mention, it is a noisy neighborhood, so if that isn't your cup of tea, it will be a difficult night of sleep. The neighborhood and the building are very historic, which is really neat. I was a little scared I might encounter a ghost, but no such luck! If you are looking for a unique place to stay close to many Seattle destinations and with lots of history, this is a great choice!"
3333971,19271960,2014-09-09,10555137,Laura,"Good location for us for 1 night of baseball at Safeco field.  Neat old brick building. Clean linens and a fresh coat if paint in the room. Neighbourhood is a little dirty/ dodgy and noisy 24/7 - we had no problem with it as we knew what to expect from visiting Seattle in the past and the other reviews.  A faint bad smell I think from the neighbourhood (port city with no rain to clean the air for a while) or maybe old building-ness?
Host was clear and concise in communications. Friendly reception, easy checkin / checkout. Appreciated the flex with the times."
3333971,20005317,2014-09-22,13577924,Koby,"Great place. No complaints. Darcy met us and showed us around and told us to go to the restaurant downstairs if we needed anything, and then gave us a great recommendation for another restaurant after we asked ( we wanted seafood). The restaurant and bar downstairs were also great and we did not hear any noise in the evenings. Very good place to pre-game or watch a game with good food and service. The noise came from Pioneer Square, as we like the windows open.  There is also a parking garage rollup door nearby and I beseech someone to bring a can of WD40 for that. As downtown hotels go the noise was normal. With the windows closed it was fine. GREAT LOCATION! 1 block from the LINK RAIL at the airport. This turned the 60 dollar plus cab fair into less than 6 bucks and is easy to navigate and use. Also close to all stadiums, China Town, and Pike Place. The room was very nice and comfortable and when I needed butter for a meal the people in the restaurant fixed me up. You can spend a lot more for a lot less in Seattle. We heartily recommend."
3333971,20147345,2014-09-24,20043222,Philip,"     The host's representatives (in the Merchant's Cafe downstairs) made us feel very welcome.  They even offered us a 10% discount at the Merchant's Cafe.  
     This private apartment is in a very quaint, charming and very old building directly across the street from Pioneer Square in downtown Seattle very near the waterfront.  As far hotel prices go in Seattle these days, I consider this apartment a good value.  It is in walking distance of the train station and the Bolt Bus.  "
3333971,21222506,2014-10-13,8796278,Lisa,"This is an atmospheric apartment in a wildly convenient location. It can be pretty noisy at night - there's a club next door that can get loud at least on weekends, and there's a lot of late night street conversation below the apartment regardless of the night. I'm a light sleeper and had to wear earplugs, but I slept fine with them in. The apartment is quite spacious for a studio (larger than a hotel room would be) and extremely well stocked if you want to do any cooking. The light rail station is approximately 1 block away - for hanging out in Seattle without a car, the location really can't be beat! Darcy makes check in/out extremely convenient by letting you pick up the keys from the bar downstairs (they also make a very tasty bloody mary)."
3333971,21818264,2014-10-24,19013,Jodi,"My friend Matt, whom I made this booking for, reports that the room was lovely as well as being spotlessly clean, which was an important consideration for him. Check in by the (very cute) barmaid was efficient and friendly, and Matt has no hesitation recommending this apartment. He also recommends the wagyu burger from the hosts restaurant, very enjoyable."
3333971,22175060,2014-10-31,22223670,Mike,"Really cool old building with lots of charm and classic features. Room was comfortable and had good accommodations (kitchenette/dining). Great location within walking distance of lots of restaurants. Room was clean for the most part, expect for some food leftover from a previous guest in the kitchenette.  Check-in was smooth and easy with the bartender in the Merchant Cafe. A note on parking: some folks mentioned some of the free street parking after 6pm, but that was a challenge to find. We stayed on a Thursday night and ended up paying nearly $30 for lot parking across the street."
3333971,22235426,2014-11-02,20956757,Robert,The suite was very quaint and in a fantastic area of downtown Seattle. It was clean and very comfortable to stay in. The staff down at The Merchants Cafe were very helpful and friendly. Definitely a good spot to stay in as it seemed to be a short walk from everything you would want to do in Seattle.
3333971,23066785,2014-11-22,508399,Laura,"Check in/out were both super easy.  The fellow that handed over the keys upon check-in was lovely.  The space was great, location works well.  I stayed on a Friday night and there definitely was noise from the bar downstairs.   Wifi worked sometimes.   All and all it was a great stay!"
3333971,23191316,2014-11-24,15621682,Dan,"We greeted at the Merchant's Cafe by friendly staff that gave us a quick overview of the details to come and go from the studio. We had a great experience staying  in the area for a concert. The mini fridge was adequate for our meals we prepared .Might be a location to bring ear plugs if you sleep lightly as there is a lot of city sounds that penetrate the windows and walls. Easy check out.

"
3333971,23329895,2014-11-29,22898509,Steve,It was as described.  The stairs are steep and it can be noisy from the music next door. But we had a great time and Darcy s bar had good food also. If you want close to Pioneer Square this is the place.
3333971,23796632,2014-12-10,17019844,Lara,"Darcy was very accommodating. We arrived at 11:30am thinking we could check in anytime after 11am. So we went in to check in with the bartender and he nicely explained to us usually check in isn't until 2, but that they could clean the room ASAP and let us in. So there was a little bit of miscommunication but they were very nice about it. The bartender comped us a drink and some food while we waited (which wasn't long).

We stayed in studio 103 and it was old and cute. It has charm with a washer and dryer if needed. We only stayed one night and it was very comfortable. 

Darcy gets back to messages quickly and is nice. I would definitely consider staying here again.

-Lara"
3333971,23852107,2014-12-12,12037855,Steve,"Another great Airbnb experience.  Great location, clean and well appointed room, and gracious welcome and reception.  Room has kitchenette and laundry, and bed was very comfortable.  five stars."
3333971,24118229,2014-12-20,21467612,Patty & Jim,"The apartment was just what we needed. Location was perfect, we walked to the company party at Columbia Tower. We were aware that Pioneer Square was outside our front door. There was a bar crowd and noise when we got back, but that added to our festive mood. In the morning we walked around neighborhood and found a great coffee shop. After check out, we walked to Pike Street Market. Inside of  apartment was quaint and historic. We would love to stay there again. Check in was easy and parking lot was across the street."
3333971,24257844,2014-12-23,2105747,Ben,"Pioneer Square after dark is, by nature, a bit dodgy.  Although this place is within walking distance of almost everything you could want downtown – Pike Place, swanky shopping, fine dining, the ferry, Century Link Field, etc – it is also three blocks from what appeared to be a mission or a homeless shelter.  On first arriving we felt a little apprehensive about the current state of the neighborhood, but when we got back from an afternoon out it felt fine.  Real cool old school Seattle.  Just use your common sense – if you’re easily spooked by walking past a couple panhandlers or people talking to the invisible demons on their shoulders, you might want to stay in a more sanitized part of town.  

If you’re looking for adventure and all the classic rustic overtones, this is your spot. Within ten minutes of meeting Darcy, she explained that the building was once a bordello. For the New York educated, think to the tune of Carlton Arms.  As advertised.  My only logistical issue was that I had to clean a hairball out of the tub drain to take a shower without wading.  I don’t really see this as a downfall of the place, just overlooked routine maintenance – and probably something that earlier guests neglected to mention to the owner.  There were also a couple containers of overlooked leftovers from previous guests in the mini-fridge, although they seemed very recent and the rest of the kitchen area was spotless.  Although I wanted to mention these minor issues in the interest of full disclosure, they are just part of staying anyplace aside from your own home – I’ve traveled extensively and this kind of thing even happens at the Waldorf.  

As mentioned by others, parking feels kinda dicey.  We recommend you don’t leave anything in your car, and if you have the choice, leave the flashy roadster at home and bring the rusty minivan instead.  If you have no car, it’s perfect – bus and train access is super close by.  The bartender helpfully mentioned that parking on the street would probably be safer than in the recesses of the garage across the street – so maybe learn from our mistake and don’t choose and overpay for your long-term parking before you check in.  We had no issues with anyone messing with our car, but be advised that even on the Monday night before Christmas there were many people roaming the streets until at least 3am. Great view from 301, ample towels, comfy bed, kitchen stocked amply with pots, pans, dishes, and silverware.  Washer and dryer are in the room, if you need them. 

A place like this – old-style urban and just gritty enough to feel really authentic – is a disappearing luxury.  I definitely value the experience over any dead-eyed generic Hampton Inn.  This kind of place is one of the reasons I use AirBnB, and I’d stay there again in a minute.  
"
3333971,24956770,2015-01-04,8326885,Laura,"We chose this apartment because we had a 7am train to catch the next morning, and it is only a few blocks from the Amtrak station. This apartment is clean, cozy, and comfortable. We did not meet Darcy, but checking in with the bartender at the Merchant's Cafe downstairs was very easy. The apartment was only a 15 minute walk from the Pike Place Market, and we spent the afternoon/evening meandering around the downtown area. We stayed on a Saturday night, and it is next door to a nightclub as stated in the other reviews. However, the noise was not nearly as bad as some of the other reviews describe. I could hear people talking outside, but it was like any other downtown area in any other city I have stayed in. The bed was extremely comfortable, perhaps that's why we were able to sleep through the noise. The wifi worked perfectly inside the apartment, other reviews had issues but they must have been resolved by the time we got there. Just a note, it is a third floor walk up, which was not a problem for us, but if you have trouble with stairs, that is something to take into consideration. I would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle! "
3333971,25415768,2015-01-15,25266747,Cherie,"Darcy was wonderful and made sure I was in the Pioneer Square view room I wanted for my 5-day stay.  The location was even more convenient than anticipated, I simply walked 2 blocks to Pioneer Square train station bound for SeaTac and paid $2.75 instead of $50 for a cab to the airport when I left for San Diego.  Darcy's Merchant's Cafe staff were awesome and so were the drinks and food - fabulous service, so thank you again Travis, Sean, Tiara and everyone else!!!"
3333971,25500820,2015-01-18,24073127,Kaylee,"What a lovely place to stay! The room was exactly as imaged and was 100% up to our expectations. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom clean, and the character radiated from the exposed-brick walls.

Location - excellent. Walking distance to Pike Place and all of the fun shopping. The neighbourhood is a bit ""sketchy"" as one expects in a downtown centre, but if you are easily unsettled by people approaching you, this isn't the place for you. We're pretty easy going folk and love to see all parts of the city, so this didn't bother us at all. 

Parking - We parked in the parkade across the street which was very convenient. About 25 dollars a day and totally worth it. You do buy your time in ""10 hour"" slots though, so it's good to think about that when deciding your parking.

Noise - You're right in pioneer square and next to a night club. It's loud, but not unbearably loud. We had a bit of a hard time sleeping the first night, but the second night we slept like a dream. I think the trick was a glass or two of wine before bed.

Darcy - She's really great. Totally accommodating and made sure our keys were with the staff at Merchant's Pub below. She was speedy to respond and very friendly.

All in all, we would stay here again in a heartbeat. Loved it, and we strongly recommend staying here if you like to be in the thick of things."
3333971,25694285,2015-01-23,9313110,Lauren,Seamless. Nothing complicated about this stay. Bars below stay open until wee hours making it really hard to sleep until they're closed. Otherwise perfect location and properly advertised.
3333971,25811515,2015-01-26,7052797,Albin,Great place to stay. Darcy was very accommodating. Would stay again.
3333971,25860416,2015-01-27,3320166,Kristin,"I had a great stay! I only stayed one night but I want to come back soon. The converted brothel has a ton of Seattle history, and it really feels like a link to the past. The room, and all the decor pays homage to the beautiful women of the building's past. Check in was easy and flexible. The bartender carried my bag upstairs and explained she is also a concierge and made herself available for anything I might need. I grabbed a drink downstairs. I learned about the Seattle underground tours that stop in the basement. There's also a binder behind the bar with collected ghost stories. I love that stuff! I had a great time. The place is within walking distance to the Amtrak. I easily caught the 7:30am train. "
3333971,25935560,2015-01-30,11994750,Richard,"The studio was well located and took only 15min walk from the Amtrak station. The location description was good and I had no trouble finding the bar to collect my keys and be shown to the room.
The apartment was clean and spacious and is located in an interesting part of Seattle with lots of character.
I had a bit of trouble working out how to get the dryer to turn on and this was promptly attended to so I was very pleased with the apartment and the assistance from my host.
There is some noise late at night from people in the street so if this worries you it is best to close the windows when going to sleep."
3333971,25985552,2015-01-31,8369359,Casey,"Very nice place with a cool decor. About a 3 min walk from the light rail - great if you are coming or going to the airport -- and close to all the stuff to see downtown. Great on the walkablity factor. It is above a bar, so there is a little noise till last call, but nothing too bad and it will not keep me from coming back. This will definitely be my first choice for me next trip to Seattle. Happy travels, all! "
3333971,26352408,2015-02-10,11280128,Hillary,"I loved this room so much, I spent most of my trip in it. Just kidding, I had the flu! But 301 kept me incredibly comfortable, and the location was ideal. Thanks!"
3333971,26592459,2015-02-16,20670226,Stephanie,"The location of this spot is so great. We were able to walk everywhere and we took the underground tour which is right across the street. The place has lots of character, it comes with lots of towels and bars of soap."
3333971,27001647,2015-02-23,20514392,Karim,"Beau studio, quartier animé avec une boîte qui est mitoyenne donc les weekend c'est bruyant. "
3333971,27917254,2015-03-15,14679509,Meg,"We had a great stay! The floors were very creaky and there was no microwave, but I can't really complain since it was was a great little affordable space in a busy area. The bartenders and Darcy were very nice and accommodating - Darcy even did a last minute search of other rooms to find me a hair dryer since we were attending a wedding. Everything is nearby and easily walkable - shops, restaurants, stadiums, ferries, etc. Great stay. I would definitely recommend this rental. "
3333971,28613667,2015-03-27,28610088,Veronica,"The loft is lovely! Pioneer square is a great location, easy to walk to pike place, Capitol Hill, etc. Perfect for one person or a couple. Plenty of space. We packed a little heavy, so the stairs up were a little wicked, but I would definitely stay there again. We did an after hours check in and check out and had no trouble. We never heard any noise from downstairs. There is a little bit of street noise and light since the bed is right next to the wall, but even as a fairly light sleeper I had no issues. Darcy was responsive to all of our questions! Great place. "
3333971,28691781,2015-03-28,15771556,Marcus,"I really liked this place. It looks just like the pictures. The bed and pillows are very comfy and it felt like I had my own apartment in downtown Seattle. It is a few blocks (10-15 min walk?) from the Pike Market area, but there are a lot of restaurants, bars, coffee shops nearby. Darcy even left me some laundry soap so I could wash clothes.  There is a bar and night club on the street below, but the noise didn't bother me. The bar staff was helpful and I even got a discount for being an airbnb guest!"
3333971,29208599,2015-04-05,2025109,Chris,"The place itself it beautiful. There's *A LOT* of nightlife nearby, and it's quite audible. Other small nuisances included the staff of the restaurant below (where keys are picked up) being solidly on the surly side, and the 2pm check-in, (the overlooking of which was might fault, but it's an annoyance worth noting if your travel calendar isn't cooperative, as was my case.)"
3333971,29852942,2015-04-13,29469579,Ali,"We had a great time at the Historic Studio on Pioneer Square. Everything was very walk-able from here which was great for us. We arrived before check-in and left after check-out and we were able to use the bar's storage area for our luggage. It would be great to have a locked closet for something like this but we were just happy to not have to lug everything around. The apartment was nice and there was a great view of Pioneer Square, as mentioned in other reviews some of the floor are creaky but that is to be expected  from an old building. So nice to have a small kitchen, we were able to get a few things to cook from Pike Place Market!
Overall a great experience!"
3333971,32466257,2015-05-18,14059044,Martina,"We had a great time at Darcy's place. My best friend and I were in Seattle for a long weekend, and really enjoyed exploring the city. We didn't meet Darcy, but Tony checked us in and out and was very helpful. The studio looks just like the pictures, and the bed is extremely comfortable. It was historic and homey, but had modern comforts as well - a stocked kitchen, premium cable, and a washer dryer complete with detergent! Two little things that we missed were an iron and a little more mirror space - there was only one little mirror in the bathroom.
My only concern about this place was that the neighborhood is pretty sketchy at night (obviously, this isn't Darcy's fault, and it's an awesome part of the city, but it's still worth mentioning). Whenever we told someone from Seattle where we were staying, their response was ""ooh - be careful at night."" We were fine and never felt endangered, but we were very aware and careful. 
Lastly, the food at the Merchant's Cafe is REALLY good. "
3333971,32979551,2015-05-24,5505424,Melissa,Location was perfect for us to get in from the train station and then leave for our flight the next day via the Link. We were on the third floor and didn't have any problem with noise from the bar. The bartender was nice and let us stow our luggage for the day. Would recommend.
3333971,33588098,2015-05-30,22589491,Chase,"We really enjoyed our flat, 302. Place was very unique and had tons of charm. Very clean and hot water worked great, contrary to other reviews. The host(s) went above and beyond, and even carried our luggage up! There is a nightclub next door, so the bass is noticeable until about 2am on weekends, but we were prepared from previous reviews, and brought our earbuds. No issues there. Would definitely recommend."
3333971,34222717,2015-06-06,5609236,Deborah,"The historic studio was a lovely room and had everything you could need for a stay near to all the sights of downtown Seattle. There is a fully equipped kitchen, washer and dryer, and en suite bathroom.  The Merchants Cafe below serves great food and is also a bar. We found the staff there very helpful. My only criticism is that, the location being over Pioneer Square,  made the room very noisy.  We found it difficult to sleep before about 2am when things finally quietened down.  We were there on a Friday night so maybe it isn't that noisy on the week nights.  If you are a light sleeper, this may not be the place for you. "
3333971,34646241,2015-06-10,15945686,Viviana,I had a very comfortable stay in this charming studio. The location is very convenient to downtown (short walk) and just a block away from the Pioneer Sq train station. I would definitely stay here again!
3333971,34759072,2015-06-11,13157033,Robert,"We didn't get to meet Darcy, but we did get to meet her staff. Everyone was very nice and helpful, and we had a great chat with the bartender, Austin. The room was in great shape and appeared recently renovated. For the location, the price could not be beat -- it is right in Pioneer Square, and a 15 minute walk to Pike's Place Market. We had a great visit and would definitely re-rent the room."
3333971,34952483,2015-06-14,30973247,Rebecca,"We had an enjoyable experience at the Historic Studio in Pioneer Square. Seamus in the Merchant's Cafe was pleasant and helpful. Since our objective was to attend the Sounders game at Century Link field, we loved being able to walk there easily, after having a pint at Merchant's with other Sounders fans.  That said, keep in mind this is an urban setting, and the homeless population are present in numbers. I never felt unsafe, though I wouldn't go out alone if it wasn't an event night."
3333971,36002133,2015-06-24,5002622,Jessica,"We would totally stay here again. Excellent location. Central to EVERYTHING. Nowhere we wanted to go was more than a half hour bus ride away, so we didn't rent a car.  Room was great. Washer and dryer were most useful. Couldn't hear the bar below, unless we opened the windows and leaned out, which turned into sort of an on-site floor show. Street noise wasn't too bad either, although it is two blocks away from a fire station. Bit of a climb up the stairs to get to the room, but after all the good food, we needed some exercise anyway. The only thing I would suggest is possibly getting some black-out curtains. There is a lot of light coming in off pioneer square. Great place other than the light. "
3333971,36127834,2015-06-25,18768928,Craig,Historic neighborhood and quaint studio.  Staff at the Merchant's Cafe were helpful.  
3333971,36710489,2015-06-30,3966399,Erin,"We couldn't have been happier with our choice to stay at Darcy's. This was our first time in Seattle, so I wanted to stay somewhere central with easy walking/train access, and this was it. The cafe on the first floor makes a great bloody mary, and everyone is friendly. The room itself was beautiful - historic building, comfy bed, great view. It's super easy to get to without a car. I also recommend taking the underground tour across the street if you're a history fan."
3333971,38502254,2015-07-16,24595429,Miranda,"Darcy's place was wonderful. The location couldn't have been more perfect and the room and building as a whole was beautiful and so full of history. We arrived a bit before the room was ready but the staff at The Merchant Cafe were very welcoming and stored our bags for us. We actually ended up relaxing and enjoying a drink there while we waited. All in all, we had a great but quick visit that we enjoyed. "
3333971,38845119,2015-07-19,33075654,Sarah,Our stay at Merchants was great. We were warmly greeted and given the keys right at our check in time. Darcy was easy to communicate with and provided feedback in a timely manner. The history there was very cool! 
3333971,39160610,2015-07-21,11952610,Caitlin,"Darcy was so sweet and welcoming- (email hidden) made it easy and flexible, and the bar and building are both charming and very cool. Loved the apartment- it's a very old building so it has its quirks but it's all very charming and as a pretty as it looks in the photos. Great for people watching, and there was a washer and dryer which we were so happy to see halfway through our two-week trip. The neighborhood might be a little gritty for some folks so just know that its a very urban area- we were completely comfortable and safe the whole time but I wouldn't necessarily steer my aunt from Ohio there. 
Also a great spot next door, the Bar Shoppe- go check it out."
3333971,39431556,2015-07-23,37836651,George,"We had a wonderful stay at Darcy's studio! The location is great, within walking distance of Pike Place and the Waterfront, and the studio itself was very comfortable and charming."
3333971,39511749,2015-07-24,17250738,Elizabeth,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying here on a recent trip to Seattle for a weekend wedding. We came a day early and needed a place to stay for one night. 

Darcy's studio was ideal for our needs. Easy access to a LINK station made it a snap to get there from the airport. The check-in/check-out process was quick and easy. The room was clean and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was quiet at night, even with the windows open (and on a Thursday!).  We never interacted with Darcy directly, but she clearly runs a tight ship. We would definitely recommend -- this is a great stay for the value!

"
3333971,41218229,2015-08-05,35828312,Maureen,The studio looks exactly like the picture. Very cute. It was easy to check in and (email hidden) downstairs. Bed was comfy and I like the fact that the windows really open.  Location is perfect-right in the heart of Pioneer Square. During our stay I sent a question thru email to the host and got a quick reply. We enjoyed our stay!
3333971,41590683,2015-08-08,7698640,Jessica,"We had a great stay at Merchants in Pioneer Square. The location was in perfect walking distance of Pikes Place Market, the Space Needle (kind of a far walk) and Safeco & Centurylink Field.  There are tons of restaurants / coffee shops / bars right outside the door.  The street level noise didn't bother us at night because our room had a fan that filter any noise out even with the windows in the rest of the apt open.  We also appreciated the choice to store our luggage instead of hauling it around the city before check in.  We would definitely stay again!!!  Thanks Darci"
3333971,42378013,2015-08-13,11624953,Allen,Great place to stay - near everything. Look forward to staying again. This is an urban setting but very little street noise for a downtown area. 
3333971,42525513,2015-08-14,4994309,Nancy,"Fantastic place within walking distance to everything you need to see in Seattle. If you have one night in town, this spot is perfect! "
3333971,42796845,2015-08-15,41207840,Selina,"The studio apartment was exactly what we were looking for in our weekend trip to downtown Seattle.  We had clear instructions on how to pick up and drop off our keys.  The room was very clean, looked just like the photographs and was worth every penny.  Staying within walking distance of the stadiums for a football game was perfect.  Using the local link light rail and Seattle trolley helped get around the city and do all the things we wanted to do.  Even though there is a nightclub right near, the noise was not excessive.  I highly recommend this place and will certainly return and stay here again on my next trip to downtown Seattle/Pioneer Square.  "
3333971,43045211,2015-08-17,14610037,Jennifer,"I would highly recommend this apartment. Great place to stay in terms of location and charm. The wifi was a bit finicky and it could be a bit loud at night, but if that won't bother you, it's a great deal."
3333971,43494570,2015-08-20,30349210,Adriana,"Check in was easy at the cafe, the lady there was very nice. They told us to go to the cafe if we needed anything but the second day it was closed. Our apt was 301, it's just like the picture but dusty, there was no AC but we didn't wanted to turn on the fans because they were very dusty.. But we were ok with that because it's part of the experience of staying at an old place. But then the second night we had to leave in the middle of the night because there were gunshots outside and we were too scared to stay the night, we left as soon as the police arrived. We read about there being a lot of homeless people but that is normal in downtown areas but here it was too much. We didn't enjoyed our stay, too hot with no AC, too dusty and the noise outside made it hard to fall sleep "
3333971,44885103,2015-08-30,18739056,Andrew,"We were able to check-in and grab our key from (email hidden) / cafe downstairs from the apartment which was quick and easy enough. Check-out was also nice and easy and we were allowed to leave our bags downstairs after the check-out time which was very convenient.

The apartment was very nice and comfortable and the location is awesome. "
3333971,45253127,2015-09-01,7746392,Casey,"My wife and I had a great time in Seattle while staying at Darcy's place. When we arrived the bar below was jammed pack with soccer fans getting ready to walk to the Sounders game. The energy was quite electric.

The Merchant Cafe, the bar below the apartment, has an interesting past and the evening bartender (can't remember his name) was quite a colorful character.

The location was great with easy access to nearby light rail and public bike share racks. Plus both King Street train station and the Seattle Ferry port are nearby for those using Amtrak or heading over to Bainbridge Island."
3333971,45483133,2015-09-03,30882368,Whitney,"The apartment is as it appears. The building and cafe are historic and the apartment is as well. Important to note that it is nothing fancy, but clean and kept. The bed was comfortable and the accommodations were everything we needed for a brief stop in Seattle. The location is great for walking around and checking out the city. "
3333971,45841854,2015-09-06,7821138,Vanessa,"This was a great stay for a great price! Perfect location to just relax and people watch. We stayed on a weekend and it wasn't loud at all. We parked at pacific place, just because we knew it was pretty secure there - but if you park across the street you can see your car from the room!  Darcy was great and showed us to our room! She was very helpful. Be prepared to hike up the staircase though :-)"
3333971,46311580,2015-09-09,10492284,Emily,The apartment was a really fun alternative to a hotel. It is right in the historic district and waking distance to many things. It has lots of character and met all our needs. 
3333971,46623247,2015-09-12,20915162,Adam,The Place was Great!!  Right in the middle of the historic part of the city and alot more quite than I expected living downtown.  I live downtown San Diego and it is loud every night if I were to leave the windows open.  NIce resturant underath also! Had a blast there and would stay there again.
3333971,47172295,2015-09-16,5202512,John,Loved the room and connection to Merchant's Cafe.  The staff was helpful and informative.  We will be back for another visit when in Seattle.  Thanks 
3333971,47264916,2015-09-17,39660302,Hayley,"The place itself was great! Really funky building, unit above the oldest bar in Seattle. While inside the building we felt very secure. The neighbourhood that the building is in however has a large amount of homeless people. While I waited the three minutes it took my husband to park, I was accosted for money 7 times. On top of that, one(or more) of these homeless people smashed the window of our vehicle, completely tossed it and slept in it.. All while parked in a parking garage across the street that we had to pay for. The $20 ""all day"" parking pass only covered us until 2am(we checked in at 4pm) but the bar manager was a gem and lent us his personal pass for the night. While I have absolutely no complaints about the unit or my dealings with Darcy, there was not a clear disclaimer about the neighbourhood and I would not stay there again. We were smart enough not to leave valuables in the car but our $200/night stay turned into a $600 stay once we got the window fixed."
3333971,47466316,2015-09-19,13141042,Ariel,"The space looks lovely in the pictures but is even more adorable in person. It was very cozy, clean, and had more to offer than I had expected. The location was a bit noisy as expected because of the time of week that we stayed, which was mentioned. We were happy with our stay. "
3333971,48180549,2015-09-24,38892063,Qiang,"We get here in the afternoon. and I found darcy in the cafe. she took us upstairs. the apartment is nice.especially at night.
She showed us around and told us if we might need anything，she was right downstairs in the cafe. the location is wonderful.a lot of buses just couples meter away. to downtown,pike market,
Westlake center. the apartment is facing to the
pioneer square.many restaurants and cafes,a market behind the building。we enjoy the five nights here.the people here are friendly and (website hidden) is unforgetful.I hope be back next time.
"
3333971,48895843,2015-09-29,41611088,Cathy,"The apartment was quaint, tastefully furnished and in a super convenient area.The checkin/ checkout arrangement was also very convenient and staff were friendly and helpful. However, we were disappointed to find that the smoke alarm had been removed and the room, furnishings and linen  smelt strongly  of recent cigarette smoke. It is my understanding that it would be unsafe  to lease out an apartment without a smoke alarm and the room was clearly advertised as a no smoking apartment. No alternative arrangements were offered despite reporting the problem as soon as we checked in.  "
3333971,49041434,2015-09-30,6252332,Cary,We got what was promised!  The staff at Merchants and the maid were so accommodating!  It is a very comfortable space.  The stairs are a bit challenging if a guest has balance issues and uses a cane--as I do. 
3333971,49223721,2015-10-02,38487054,Frank,"Die Appartements von Darcy liegen sehr gut  zentral in der Stadt. Von hier aus ist alles fussläufig erreichbar.
Allerdings versammeln sich gegenüber in einem kleinen Minipark einige Obdachlose, die auch betteln. Ich selbst bin auf Weg und im 7eleven angesprochen worden.
Die Schlüsselübergabe lief über den Barkeeper des Merchants Cafe problemlos.
In den Appartments hört man auch nichts von der Bar im Erdgeschoss.

Enttäuscht waren wir über die Kommunikation, die leider nicht mehr statt fand. Wir hätten noch Geld zurückbekommen sollen, allerdings haben wir, auch nach Nachfrage, bis heute nichts mehr von Darcy gehört. Sehr enttäuschend und unseriös!

Auch war das Zimmer nicht wirklich sauber. Wir waren mit einem Säugling dort und achten vielleicht deshalb mehr auf den Boden und die Hygiene.

Wir würden bei einer erneuten Reise nach Seattle eine andere Unterkunft aufsuchen."
3333971,49793408,2015-10-06,42197966,Jason,"Nice, clean place to stay downtown Seattle.  Very close to the nightlife in Pioneer Square as well as quick access to the water taxis and ferries.  Comfortable and convenient place that is adequately priced."
3333971,50184096,2015-10-10,10846698,Daniel,"Great studio and central location. easy to get to transit, delicious restaurants, historic sights and local bars."
3333971,50323827,2015-10-11,30510737,Mateja,"Darcy answered our questions promptly and set us up with one of my finer airbnb stays! Hotel-like experience with the oldest restaurant in Seattle downstairs, where you can leave luggage in a little back room. Kitchenette and great view! "
3333971,52318829,2015-10-28,9973824,Jeff,"We did not meet Darcy upon arrival, but we were met by the friendly staff in the restaurant below the room.   The staff made us feel quite welcome, showed us to our room and offered to be of any assistance.  Our room was  as described in the listing, and  comfortable. Pioneer Square was a great location to be in terms of proximity, close to a Light Rail Station and within very short walking distance of Seattle Ferries and 15 min walk of Pikes Place Market.  Upon checking out, restaurant staff was very helpful by storing our luggage until our flight so that we could further tour the city. We enjoyed our stay!"
3333971,52554990,2015-10-30,22782938,Shaheen,"Great location, very comfy digs. The apartment was exactly as described, we would absolutely stay there again if in Seattle. "
3333971,53145733,2015-11-05,28553109,Nathan,Darcy was an excellent hostess. Everything went very smooth with the check in at the Merchants Cafe.  The unit was well equipped and very cozy.  Great location with easy access from the airport via the light rail.
3333971,53366916,2015-11-08,15486462,Cecilia,"Location was perfect! Walking distance to local good food, pike place and shopping. Can be a bit noisy at night on the street but didn't mind it for location. Thanks! "
3333971,53987313,2015-11-15,43453268,Kimia,"It was so easy to check in and check out! Great place, super comfortable and close to all the sights in the city. I definitely recommend!"
3333971,54356363,2015-11-18,21963712,Adam,"Stayed at this property for one night while on a short holiday in Seattle.  The historic building and neighborhood charmed us right from the start, and the room was clean and comfortable. The (email hidden) downstairs were helpful and welcoming, and added to the enjoyability of our stay by making us feel like regulars. All in all, this was a great experience and we will hope to stay here again. "
3333971,54480880,2015-11-20,1232579,John,"Great location and large, comfortable apartment. Good facilities - tv, kitchen, internet etc.  Heaters in the lounge and bedroom were appreciated this time of year! Being so central there us a bit of street noise. Again location is fabulous - was just perfect for attending the boat show at Century Field - a pleasant 5 minute walk. "
3333971,56535525,2015-12-14,12398888,Dawn,This was the perfect place for a perfect weekend getaway. It is located in a wonderful spot and very cozy!
6855839,35442507,2015-06-18,35982149,Aleksander,"Thank you so much Katrina! The small details makes one feel at home :)

Starting off - this place is like home, and in some ways, better. I loved the gigabit internet and the cable. They were very nice touches after several days in hotels with regular internet (it's kind of hard getting used to not having it, now that I had the chance to use it). The TV is very large and nice (Samsung) and let me use Netflix and HBOGO. Also worth mentioning on the tech side is the AC - it was very nice to come back to a cool apartment after a long run on the treadmill downstairs.

The place is clean and the furniture is new. It's very comfortable and well laid out. The bed really steals the show, it's more comfortable than the one I have at home. As I've said before, it feels like home, but even better in some respects. Everything I needed was there and Katrina was happy to bring some extra hangers for me. I appreciate those details. She is always very prompt about answering questions or inquiries. I'm halfway convinced she's a robot.

I really appreciate Katrina taking the time to help out with finding restaurants at a weird hour. Even though I spend a decent amount of time in Seattle, you can always learn something new. Katrina certainly knows the city well and is happy to help. Totally recommend staying with Katrina, and this unit.

This was my first Airbnb experience. I'll definitely be using it more in the future. This kicks the ass of hotels."
6855839,35752174,2015-06-21,23139571,Kyle,Katrina was very welcoming and met us on the day of our arrival to show us the unit. Apartment was amazingly clea and well decorated. Great location too very centrally located and within walking distance from many places to eat and things to do.  The neighborhood was very safe and we felt very comfortable walking around with no problem. Definitely would stay here again. Best airbnb experience we have had! 
6855839,36822755,2015-07-01,32444270,Suyash,"I hosted my family here for 3 nights. It's a really nice place, conveniently located (in Seattle Downtown) with easy access to public transport and a nice neighborhood as well. Katrina was always there to help out on anything we needed. Would definitely recommend to everyone! "
6855839,37697964,2015-07-09,20938014,Will,What more can I ask? It's a hotel room with nice view and only better :-) Wish I could stay longer!
6855839,38169456,2015-07-13,8922862,Rob,"Katrina is an excellent host. She was very attentive on the front end and responsive to our (minimal) needs during our stay. The apartment is clean, quiet and comfortable.  The location is  pretty much perfect -  within easy walking distance to downtown attractions, Whole Foods Grocery and Amazon.  It is also about 8 blocks from the light rail station to/from the airport.    "
6855839,38632355,2015-07-17,12693799,Robin,I stayed here with my family for 4 nights and found the place to be nice and clean with all the amenities we needed. Communication was great and any questions I had were answered right away. I'd definitely recommend this place to someone visiting Seattle.
6855839,43386757,2015-08-19,37083936,Melissa,"Katrina was an awesome host, she accommodated my friend in I in the very beginning due to our early arrival. She checked on us during the trip and made us feel very comfortable. The apartment pictures do not do it justice, it is very clean and nice. I would recommend this place to anyone. "

6855839,46789756,2015-09-13,27067197,Mike,"Katrina's condo was amazing, great views and within walking distance to all of downtown. She was on time to meet us and give the tour of the condo. She was also very helpful in giving us dining recommendations. Very clean, new and the tv is huge! Highly recommend"
6855839,47308037,2015-09-17,43625152,Teddy,"Katrina was a great host and was able to accommodate my earlier check-in time. The apartment itself was clean and the furniture being slightly modern (which was a plus).

Of the 3 airbnb units I have stayed at in Seattle, I would hands down pick this one again. The apartment building itself had a bit of a strange smell in the hallways but that did not get into the unit itself."
6855839,47742462,2015-09-21,41777985,Angela,"Wonderful welcome with wine and smiles!  Katrina helped us find the perfect place for dining out, entertainment, and away from tourists...tee hee!  Beautiful apartment situated in the perfect spot for any Seattle excursion.  Super accessible and very accommodating.  Katrina was available the entire time to answer questions and checked in on us multiple times via text to see if we needed anything.  She was the perfect host. "

6855839,48817953,2015-09-28,44544376,Marc,"Katrina was a great host! She responded to all questions quickly and was able to accommodate an earlier check-in. She met us the morning of our arrival and showed us the place, and had great restaurant recommendations for us.

The listing is exactly as pictured. Everything clean and spacious, and the building was quiet. It's situated in the perfect location to walk to anything in the downtown area, and close to rental car locations if you're planning a day trip.

I won't hesitate to stay with Katrina again in the future."
6855839,49383967,2015-10-03,27914012,Kevin,The 98 walking score was right on. Loved not needing a car. The apartment was super clean and efficient and Katrina was available if needed and able to even get me in a little early at check in.
6855839,49831366,2015-10-06,44680042,Robert,Everything was just as described. Katrina was very nice and the room as clean and comfortable. The location and experience was great.

I would definitely come and stay here again."
6855839,51393041,2015-10-19,12092299,Henry,The space was great and clean.  Great location to walk to most places and uber/lyft was very convenient.  Check in was very quick and the building was very quiet.  
6855839,51872118,2015-10-24,7170540,Julie,"Katya's studio apartment was truly modern, clean and close to the downtown Seattle corridor. A splendid Airbnb stay!! A great location and easy to navigate. The experience was made extra nice by Katya's concierge service and easy check-in. I was surprised that a brand new blender was dropped off for me, just to make ensure 5-star experience. Nothing I would have expected and it made my stay extra nice! Definitely would recommend this location for anyone liking a modern downtown location. The convenient underground paid parking made the stay easy to navigate as well. 

One thing I'd recommend: If you do have a favorite down pillow (like I do), do bring it along. Mine helps me sleep and it came in handy! Bedding is very nice, just no down/feather pillow options at this time. Not knocking Katya...just a travel tip. I found it came in handy in every spot I stayed! :)"
6855839,52381104,2015-10-28,41580341,Angel,"Solid apartment very well located in the middle of downtown, in a modern building and with everything you might possibly need"

I'll be looking to stay here again next time I'm in town."
6855839,54226034,2015-11-16,48248450,Silvana,The place was impeccable and better than the pictures. There was a bottle of wine and protein snacks. She was incredibly attentive and easy to communicate with. If needed I will definitely request to stay there again!
6855839,54683463,2015-11-22,4863242,Rodney,Perfect stay.  Host was more than accommodating and the listing is exactly as it is mentioned.  Area was great too.  Couldn't ask for more.
6855839,55719528,2015-12-05,7757525,Jeffrey,"Everything was top notch -- one of the best Airbnb units we've stayed in! Location is great, it's easy to get anywhere downtown or up to Capitol Hill. The building has a nice gym accessible just one floor above the apartment which we made use of almost every day. Highly recommended!"
6855839,56811718,2015-12-18,8092242,Drew,Super flexible and accommodating. Nice touch with the wine. Excellent location for Amazon. Highly recommended!
6855839,57347908,2015-12-24,13915587,Elsa,Perfect view with all ficilities in there.I have a really nice experience there.
6855839,58597021,2016-01-03,42846873,Stephanie,This was a perfect studio apartment to stay at during my trip to Seattle. My boyfriend and I loved it! It is located in a area that was ideal to all the places we wanted to go in the city. Katya is a great host and very accommodating. 
7308331,39446846,2015-07-23,16252286,Jon,"Great location near restaurants, cafes, and major bus lines. Home was recently remodeled and in nice condition."
7308331,41246309,2015-08-05,9198147,Kristin,"We loved our stay at Joe's capital hill property! It was super cute, clean and convenient to everything! The beds were comfortable and we felt right at home. We would highly recommend it! "
7308331,45969196,2015-09-07,5062110,Portia,"This is a great apartment, within walking distance of shops & restaurants on Broadway.  Very clean, with a well-stocked kitchen.  One bedroom with a king-sized bed, and a second bedroom with two twin beds, both with ample closet space.  There's also a nice living room that's great to hang out in.  Joe was easy to communicate with and gave good directions on how to get the keys, etc.  Only two small negatives: 1) it's very easy to hear the upstairs neighbors walking around in the morning, making it tough to sleep past 7 am, and 2) while the unit comes with two parking spaces, one of them is darn near impossible to actually park in - so just a heads up that the parking situation is great if you have one car, but would be really tough if you had two!  But overall, this place was awesome and we'd definitely recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle!"
7308331,47217859,2015-09-16,23752610,Jordan,"Great place, clean. Yes, it was on a busy street with people in the upper unit, but when I put the fan on at night I never heard any of it. Walking distance to fun eateries and bars. Would stay here again."
7308331,51328462,2015-10-19,9932889,Jessica,"Lovely visit, such a great house, I would highly recommend it. "
458186,1376233,2012-05-29,1919591,Sarah,This was a really cozy room and the shared space is great; a huge kitchen with anything you would need and a large living room.  We had a really nice stay and enjoyed talking with Chris and the other guests.  The host is very helpful and accommodating and the location is great. 
458186,6158604,2013-08-01,1666609,Daniel,"Chris is an awesome host that really made us feel welcome and comfortable. We stayed in the tree room, which was very nice (had towels and everything), felt like a hotel room, but with the convenience of a house. The location was perfect, walking distance to tons of restaurants, cafes, a few museums and bus routes pretty much everywhere."
458186,6310505,2013-08-07,4733105,Yasmin,"We had a wonderful time with Chris at his lovely home. The location is perfect on Capitol Hill with lots of stores, restaurants, and bars to noodle around. The house itself is great. We were staying with 10 of our friends total who all it in the house extremely comfortably. There is a foosball table, and a great communcal living room where everyone can hang out. This is perfect for a large group.
The only thing about the Tree Room specifically is it's the only room in the house without a lock on it's door. Chris did offer to hold our valuables while we were out but we just ended up leaving them in one of our friends rooms who had a lock. This might be an issue for some people but for us it was not a big deal.
We had a wonderful time and will definitely be booking with Chris again!

"
458186,7542443,2013-09-23,2556218,Frederic,My stay at Chris was quite short but went well. The house is perfectly located in Capitol Hill with easy access to tons of restaurants and bars. The room was clean and tidy. The shared bathroom was very clean as well. I did not meet Chris in person. Yet I got all the details by email to access the place.
458186,9908370,2014-01-18,2734499,Jason,"Fantastic location. Great space. I actually stayed in the Sunshine Room because it had a desk and I was on a work trip this time. The kitchen had everything one could need to prepare a delicious meal. Great common area for lounging and TV enjoyment. Clean, Safe, and  Well Maintained. Chris is a stellar host. I will continue to support his airbnb listings. "
458186,11272839,2014-03-27,7453292,Jordan,"Chris' place was nice, as confirmed by the other reviews of folks. It was clean, comfortable, and spacious. Location was great, considering it was a few doors down from restaurants, stores, bars, and bus stops to downtown and the University district. 

Chris was a VERY accommodating and friendly host. My roommate and I both felt comfortable staying at this place."
458186,19256157,2014-09-08,8443222,Geneva,"First Airbnb experience and it was great. Stayed here one night on a whim and had a blast. Chris was great in showing us around the place, and mentioning some bars and breakfast spots to check out.  Location is close enough to downtown but in a great area of Seattle.. The downstairs is spacious with a large kitchen and dressing room to get ready! You are sharing the space with other guests but it didn't bother us as we arrived at night. We're planning on booking at his place again in the near future!!"
458186,20855359,2014-10-06,17242544,Miranda,"Our host Chris was very nice and helpful, and the house was fun to stay at - hot tub, full kitchen, and a makeup/dressing room - a perfect place for larger groups, like a bachelor/bachelorette trip. I really liked the location as well, right behind Broadway where there is plenty of shops/coffee/restaurants. "
458186,21063173,2014-10-10,21541475,Matt,"Bit of a rough start: door code lock was broken so we couldn't get in; toilet sprayed water everywhere; hot tub overflowed and flooded lounge and kitchen.

That said, nice place and very comfy bed. Cool dressing room area. Close to a lot of bars and restaurants nearby and around 20-30 minute wall to downtown. No lock on the bedroom door, which was fine as we were the only guests there. Hot tub was great, kitchen well stocked, free to use TV, movies, Netflix whenever.

Run more like a business than other Airbnb places we've stayed in. Chris was friendly and have us good recommendations of what to see. Not bad at all."
458186,21407343,2014-10-16,651079,Brian,"The Tree Room was super comfy and great value for a private space, with super convenient options nearby for food. Chris is always on point for making sure you're taken care of."
458186,22799667,2014-11-15,22630687,Allegra,"This place was perfect for our stay. The downstairs bathroom/dressing area reminded me of a day spa and the beautiful kitchen had everything you could want or need. the bed was very comfortable, and the downstairs space is well laid out for privacy. I hope to stay here again. Next time I will use the hot tub!!! "
458186,25586774,2015-01-19,372559,Eric,"This was one of the best Airbnb stays I've ever had. Great location, great accommodations, Chris was very helpful!"
458186,27377786,2015-03-02,26968389,Melanie,"This house and Chris were both awesome! I definitely recommend staying here. It's a great location, but still off the main road, making it quiet and comfy. The room was great and has everything I needed. The house was perfect for what I needed. Easy to make food and leave left overs. Chris also was very hospitable and gave a quick turn over for a last minute room. "
458186,27859528,2015-03-13,25045821,Allison,"great position! It's located in a safe and quite neighbor, and there's several fantastic cafe around. The room is big and clean. It's located at the bottom level of the house, and we are the only one at that level. Overall. We had a great trip to Seattle! "
1537246,6831597,2013-08-26,7305733,David,"Loved our stay at Lana's place.  It was nice to experience a true neighborhood stay on Capitol Hill and discovered some gems like the Lookout, Sun Liquor, and Top Pot that are off the beaten path on the hill.  Was also super convenient to Broadway and the Pike/Pine corridor.

The apartment was super comfortable with fantastic furniture, beautiful artwork, etc.  One thing to note is that the bed is quite firm which suited us just fine.  The photos posted do not do the bathroom justice; we were delighted to find it quirky and comfortable in all the right ways.  

"
1537246,7047396,2013-09-04,5962212,Pamela,"Lana's place was perfect for our stay. I needed to be close to the convention center but did not want the hustle of being 'downtown'.  I also wanted to be within walking distance of nice restaurants and coffee shops. The condo is immaculate and very homey - decorated very nicely in Arts & Crafts style, and fully equipped with everything we needed. It's also in the center of the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which is a wonderful place to be. Lana was also great to work with in orchestrating our stay. On our second day in the condo, the refrigerator went out (freak occurrence since it is a new fridge). Lana was out of the country but was very responsive via email and texts in getting me the assistance I needed to work around the problem. She was very conscientious in leaving an emergency contact who was great in helping with the fridge situation, and also when my husband locked the keys in the apartment (thanks Anne!). We would definitely stay at Lana's again, and I have recommended her place to a number of my friends who have short trips planned to Seattle. "
1537246,7583421,2013-09-25,8286377,Ameena,"Lana was a great host - she confirmed our visit via email prior to our arrival, and texted during our visit to make sure we had everything we needed.  There were no problems, and the condo was exactly as it appeared in the photos - absolutely beautiful.  Definitely 5 out of 5 stars!  

The condo is located in historic Capitol Hill.  It's cozy and warm - we felt right at home.  There's leafy green vegetation visible through every window, and a view of Puget Sound on the street just outside the building.  A 5 minute walk takes you to Broadway where restaurants, shops and neighborhood grocery stores are located.  We chose not to rent a car, which worked out well for us.  Multiple bus stops are close - the closest one is about 200 feet from the door - and we found that when we didn't want to ride, walking was an option.  We rode the bus to the Space Needle, but walked home thereafter; it was only 1.7 miles distance.  Walking shoes are a plus!

We would absolutely stay in Lana's condo again.  Thanks Lana!"
1537246,8000764,2013-10-12,8495881,Krista,"Had a great stay at Lana's Condo in October, it's in a great location on Capitol Hill....Bars, Restaurants, Coffee Shops, Shops all on the doorstep and only a 10 minute walk into downtown. The Condo was very nice, clean and welcoming. Before my stay i had a few questions for Lana which she always answered in full very quickley, the info and fast response was muh appreciated. Lana also left a folder of information with things to do in the local area with maps etc which was a really nice touch. Really enjoyed my stay and would definitely recommend."
1537246,8090462,2013-10-15,1793341,Gavin,"This apartment was fantastic! Lana is a wonderful host, and was very communicative and helpful in making sure that our stay was pleasant. The apartment was beautiful, comfortable and in a great location. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to experience Seattle, this neighborhood provides many options for food, drink, shopping and culture, and the apartment itself makes you feel right at home with all its luxury and charm. Perfect, thank you!"
1537246,8157782,2013-10-18,672448,Robb,"great location. well designed space thats easy to be in...comforting and engaging. lana gives attention to detail to the space that she lives in, as well as has structured to accommodate others living in the space with a useful 'how-to' book and guides, etc. its great that its so easy to get to everything capitol hill from here. my only regret was that i didnt have more time in it. "
1537246,8241572,2013-10-21,2710246,Ingo,Very nice place in Capitol Hill. Apartment is very clean and nicely furnished with a super comfortable bed. Lana was very responsive during the process. I can recommend it. 
1537246,8412780,2013-10-29,9234435,Richard,Lana's place was perfect for our weeklong stay.  The location was perfect for us to visit family in the neighborhood and at Swedish Hosp. Lana's place was a comfortable home base for us.  
1537246,8670040,2013-11-11,9280652,Brent,This was my first time using airbnb and Lana provided a perfect experience. The apartment was very nice and had everything I needed for my stay. The location was a perfect location for my introduction to seattle with a great quiet neighborhood to stay in with excellent restaurants and bars nearby (top pot being right around the corner for great coffee). Lana provided a book full of anything and everything I needed to know about the apartment and the city. I wouldn't hesitate to choose this apartment again when returning to seattle.
1537246,9444436,2013-12-29,9920731,Ruthann,"Thank you so much Lana for sharing your lovely home with us.  We could not have asked for a more comfortable, charming and homey place to spend the holidays.  The bed was comfortable and beautifully appointed, the kitchen off the charts and your suggestions on places to eat, drink and be entertained within walking distance made getting around so easy.  Parking within half a block was never a problem and I never tired of seeing the space needle as I walked out the front door.  We would love to be able to stay again on our next visit to Seattle.  Thanks! "
1537246,9960051,2014-01-21,10591137,Jossie,"We had a wonderful weekend trip to Seattle with Lana's place as a cozy, cheerful, and charming home-base! It's in a perfect location, close to all sorts of restaurants and coffee shops, as well as walking distance to downtown and the more touristy attractions. Lana was great at responding to last minute questions and flexible around our plane schedules which ended up coming in later than expected.  Plus, the fully-stocked kitchen was gorgeous-- if we had been in town longer (and not surrounded by an abundance of seafood!!), I would have loved to prepare a feast and make use of the dining room, too. All in all, a fantastic place to stay for a quick trip or for a longer stay... we'd highly recommend it! "
1537246,11222745,2014-03-25,12473142,Janis,"What a lovey home base for our stay in Seattle! Comfortable, clean, and close to everything we needed. The ambiance of Lana's apartment (and the perfect weather) made our spring get-a-way so special. We would certainly book this spot again when visiting Seattle. 
"
1537246,11333198,2014-03-30,13135839,Britton,We had a blast. Clean. Quiet. And great location. Highly recommend. 
1537246,11556833,2014-04-07,5166231,Kelly,This place is great! My boyfriend and I stayed for a weekend.  TopPot doughnut shop is literally about 50 yards away.  Don't miss it!  The location is awesome and easy to get around town. Only a couple of block from Broadway which you can easily catch various bus lines.  Lana was extremely responsive and easy to work with.  We felt like it was a home away from home.  Her kitchen and appliances are amazing.  We definitely would stay here again and recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle.  Capitol Hill is a really pretty area and convenient to other locations within Seattle including Downtown.
1537246,12036061,2014-04-21,7632242,Tina,"If you are looking for the perfect place to stay in the hippest neighborhood in Seattle- look no further. The condo is extremely comfortable, clean, and stylish and its location is absolutely perfect. It is a nice quiet neighborhood but within a couple blocks you are in the heart of Capitol Hill with amazing food, drink and shopping only a few steps away. We were able to ditch our car for most of our adventures and get places on foot. 
Lana was the perfect host. Quick response time, friendly, great communication and accommodating. If we are ever in Seattle again we hope to stay at Lana's. 
"
1537246,12841622,2014-05-12,9151531,Tom,"The host was very responsive, responding to both email and text messages. Was very accommodating in scheduling a key exchange and walk-thru of the apartment. The apartment was one of the most tastefully decorated and appointed places I have ever rented, one that you would be proud to have others meet and visit you. A fully equiped kitchen, separate living room and dining room, and quiet bedroom are all included. While in the busy Capital Hill district, the aprtment is in a quiet, well-maintained building, with the Broadway entertainment area just a few blocks, 5-8 minute walk away. I-5 is just a 5-minute drive, so this is very conveneint to all parts of Seattle. This is the perfect base to stay in Seattle. "
1537246,13040860,2014-05-18,283946,Jon,Lana's home is wonderful. The place is clean and artistic. She was very helpful with instructions and letting us use her parking spot during our stay. Thumbs up!
1537246,13220143,2014-05-22,6409851,Eric,"I stayed for three days for work: Lana was responsive, helpful, and showed up in person to give me a tour when I arrived. The place is adorable and very comfortable for one or two people. Location is perfect if you like Capitol Hill: very close to the main street of shops and restaurants. Would happily stay there again. "
1537246,13418715,2014-05-27,1891807,Greg,"Such a cute, cozy and comfy place. We really enjoyed our stay.
We never met Lana but she was very responsive to all our needs and questions. She was even quick to respond during our stay even though it was a holiday weekend.
The neighborhood is quiet but within two blocks there's plenty of restaurants, bars and small shops for shopping.
We will definitely stay again when we return to Seattle. "
1537246,13604581,2014-06-01,4576515,Kevin,"I loved staying here and discovering Seattle for the first time. Capitol Hill is such a fun and interesting neighborhood and Lana's apartment is in a prime location for exploring, especially for morning/evening walks in Volunteer Park! Plus, there's an abundance of great coffee shops, bars and restaurants in walking distance (especially on E. Olive Street and Pike/Pine areas). The apartment is very clean, comfortable (loved the reading chair) and peaceful (we didn't see or hear anyone else in the building while we stayed). The parking directions were a little confusing at first for us, but once we figured it out, it was much-appreciated—what a perk! Overall: a quiet, relaxing place to stay in a fun & lively city."
1537246,13910754,2014-06-08,8780463,Mely,"Lana's condo is small, cozy and convenient. We enjoyed being in Capitol Hill, down the street from the Harvard Theater and all the great shops on Broadway. Due to the location we would stay at Lana's place in the future. "
1537246,14271738,2014-06-16,8412305,Laura,"Apt. is just as nice as the photos!  I liked the artwork on Lana's walls and her comfy leather couch.  Good location, near lots of restaurants, coffee shops, and close to the university our daughter attends.  Everything was very clean, which was also appreciated.

We slept well since the neighborhood is pretty quiet.  Enjoyed Lana's kitchen and it was helpful to have staples available in case we forgot salt/sugar/tea/etc.

I'd return for another Seattle expedition!  "
1537246,14682378,2014-06-24,8237021,Kai,"Lana was a gracious and helpful host. Her place is in a quiet neighborhood conveniently located near a Top Pot Doughnuts. The apartment is clean and comfortable, perfect as a home base for exploring the Seattle area. "
1537246,15133481,2014-07-03,11300644,Dan,"Our visit to Lana's place in Capitol Hill can be summed up succinctly: next time we go back, we're staying there.

We loved everything about her place - location, style, comfort. The area was fantastic, so much to see and do. But not right on top of you. So the condo was nice and quiet, but if we wanted to go see the restaurants and shops nearby, it was just a short walk away.

Her place was amazingly well appropriated and comfortable! The bathroom was very large, kitchen well stocked and the furniture (including bed) were very comfortable. We felt we had a great flavor for the local area just in the way the condo was set up and decorated.

There was parking, which in the area can be certainly hard to come by. So that was another plus. If you do plan on staying and parking, make sure your car is not too big. We had a full-size rental and that was about as big as we could fit in the space, which is in the back of the building and shared with other buildings.

Lana was a fantastic host as well. No problems communicating and everything was just as it should be.

Highly recommend."
1537246,15398759,2014-07-08,266899,Adam,"Lana was a great host -- friendly and helpful, and provided a wonderful place for us to stay on vacation. Her home was inviting, and comfortable, and included everything we needed. We loved the neighborhood as well, and had a good time exploring.

I would absolutely recommend Lana as a host and her home as a great place to stay."
1537246,15957345,2014-07-19,11245113,Erica,Lana's home made for a wonderful week in Seattle!! She left a binder that not only had instructions for care of the home but TONS of things to do in the city as well as tips and tricks for the bus and walking! Staying in Lana's home felt just like home away from home.
1537246,16084697,2014-07-22,9520373,Toby,"My girlfriend and I had a really good experience with Lana.  Had no problem with communication and were able to check in a little early because we happen to be in town early.   The neighborhood was a great place to walk around, bars, restaurants, coffee shops, and even a nice grocery store a few blocks away.   Lana had a bunch of visitor brochures and maps available to us and made sure to give us some pointers and suggestions on some things to do while in Seattle.  This was unexpected and was really nice.

We had a lot of clothes to wash since we were on a camping road trip, so I wish the clothes washer and dryer had been more convenient, not in the basement of the building.  But other than that a very comfortable, clean and enjoyable place to stay.  We'd certainly stay here again."
1537246,16543390,2014-07-29,13872272,Brian,My wife and I stayed at Lana's while in Seattle on an anniversary trip. Lana was very easy to reach when we needed her. Her place was fantastic. It is so close to everything. We had no problems walking or getting a bus to wherever we wanted quickly. We would definitely come back. 
1537246,16980947,2014-08-05,7054457,Sandi,"What a great space!  Lana's place is located in a perfect Capitol Hill/Seattle location!!! Next to bodegas, donuts, bars..the whole nine yards! The space is wicked clean and fully loaded!  I would book this space again in a heart beat. Thanks Lana for a memorable experience!"
1537246,17444444,2014-08-12,8142317,Rachel,"Lana's condo was the perfect place for my boyfriend and I to stay on our first trip to Seattle. It was clean and cozy - the perfect spot to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Everything you could need was a few short blocks away (bars, restaurants, stores) but the neighborhood was still quiet and peaceful. Lana was very responsive and accommodating and even left a binder of materials/maps/info about Seattle and Capitol Hill. I would definitely stay here again."
1537246,18241378,2014-08-24,16863578,Beth Ann,"Lana's condo is well located and well appointed.  We loved our time in Capitol Hill: grabbing coffee and doughnuts at Top Pot and cocktails at Sun Liquor (both spots are two minutes away).  It's a nice walk to downtown/the Space Needle/Pike Place.  In addition to the fabulous location, the condo is quiet, big, and comfortable.  We slept well every night!  If we come back to Seattle, we hope we can stay here again!  "
1537246,18647330,2014-08-30,14801807,Jan,"My partner and I spent a week in August at Lana’s condo. There were no surprises, as the description provided on the Airbnb website was accurate and through. Although we never met, Lana provided ample communication via text and email. We arrived very late at night, but arrangements for us to enter the condo at that hour was not a problem. The Condo is located on the third floor of a charming 1920’s building on the western slope of Capitol Hill. There are stairs in the front as well in back (no elevator). We chose to use the rear stairs most of the time as they were more convenient to the front door of the condo. The condo itself was spotless, with ample space in all living areas. There is a flat screen TV with basic cable and Wi-Fi (slow). The bathroom was large with claw foot tub w/ shower, a sink and commode. In the bedroom, two cabinet shelves were available for guests to store clothing and the firm queen sized bed was comfortable. The small kitchen was well appointed. My only (minor) gripe was there was not a dedicated electric coffee maker but only with the small french press. So we made frequent use of a wonderful coffee shop just around the corner. Public transportation was close by and excellent (although we heard some bus routes will be eliminated soon). We enjoyed our stay and would certainly entertain staying here again."
1537246,37948029,2015-07-12,28498244,Jennifer,"We arrived early and our host had set us up to check in with her partner. She was extremely nice and showed us the apartment as well as explained the area. She was able to recommend a restaurant for lunch (which was delicious) and there was also a binder explaining everything we should know about the apartment including activities, restaurants, and maps of the area. We didn't need anything while we were there, but Lana explained that she can be reached if we need anything. We would definitely stay here again!"
1537246,38590976,2015-07-17,5297880,Geoffrey,"The apartment was just right for us: plenty of space, good light, very comfortable. And the location was great too: good access to the parts of Seattle we wanted to explore and some fine food options close by, in a quirky corner of the city. Lana was a good host; we communicated well, met up as arranged, and the handover was thorough. All in all a very good choice."
1537246,38859102,2015-07-19,34906982,Don,"We really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is even more charming than the photos.  Lot of character.  Great artwork.  Beautiful wood floors and furniture.  Comfortable bed.  And the parking spot is a big plus.
Lana was organized and very easy to deal with.  No problems whatsoever.  When we return to Seattle, we'll hope to stay there again."
1537246,39491997,2015-07-24,32449683,Elizabeth,"Great place! Very clean, nicely decorated, comfy and close to tons of fantastic restaurants. Would definitely stay here again. "
1537246,39735423,2015-07-26,29690713,Anita,"Lana was such a welcoming host and so very patient as we got stuck in traffic on our way to check in! The apartment is absolutely beautiful and the neighborhood is great with plenty of restaurants, bars, and parks to explore while still being close to Seattle's more touristy attractions. A perfect place to enjoy a great city!"
1537246,40572194,2015-08-01,11219376,François,"Very warm apartment, very well equiped.
Excellent localisation.
Very quiet.
We really enjoyed our stay.
Thank you Lana .

1537246,40915121,2015-08-03,7948758,Nicholas,Lana was great and gave us a great recommendation for dinner. The neighborhood has a lot of places to go and is a nice walk to the Pike Place Market. Highly recommended!
1537246,41335771,2015-08-07,3552368,Jerry And Kamil,"Staying at Lana's was one of the most enjoyable accommodation experiences we've had after many years of travel. 
Communication was informative and easy-going from the start which helped us feel comfortable about our choice. The flat looks lovely in the photos, but is even more stunning in person. The interior is warm, colorful, and full of character—it even inspired and gave us ideas for setting up our next place. There's just about everything you'll need in the apartment as it's very well equipped. We especially enjoyed the kitchen and the eclectic washroom. 

The apartment is situated in not only our favorite area (Capitol Hill) in Seattle, it's also located in one of the more quiet neighborhoods on the hill (quieter, but still walking distance to everything). A few years back, we resided in the area and knew parking can be a challenge, so we were very happy when Lana offered up a spot on the premises free of charge. 

Whether your interest is to wander down to the malls and theaters downtown, explore the diverse shops, clubs and eateries on Capitol Hill, or just unwind in a lovely apartment, if you're lucky Lana's will be your starting point. "
1537246,42111591,2015-08-11,22057517,Jessica,"What a wonderful experience!  My friend and I stayed in Lana's charming capital hill apartment for four nights and we loved everything about it. It is close to many restaurants and bars, and walking distance to Pike/Pine. Lana really went above and beyond, arranging for an earlier check in since we were stuck with luggage. Lana's apartment was a welcome respite after long days of Seattle sightseeing. "
1537246,42572589,2015-08-14,6489063,Leigh,"Everything abput Lana's place has high quality natural warm and inviting feel - including natural fabrics, hand made soaps, lovely tasteful style  Location is terrific with a mix of downtown and alternate right at your fingertips. Plus Lana is a kind and friendly host. What else would you want?"
1537246,43661504,2015-08-21,14664853,Scott,Fantastic stay! Lana was great with communication prior to arrival and greeted me and showed me around the place at time of check-in. Apartment was clean and is just as nice as the photos show. Capitol Hill was a nice location with many bars/restaurants for dinner options and evening drinks just a 5-10-minute walk away. Really a nice place and I would definitely stay here again...thanks Lana!
1537246,44295861,2015-08-25,35651126,Laura,"Lana's apartment was such a joy to stay in. Located in the lively neighborhood of Capitol Hill, Lana's apartment is located on a quiet street near the local restaurants, coffee shops and nightlife. My boyfriend and I frequented Top Pot for doughnuts several times which was right out the door! We chose to walk everywhere during our stay in Seattle, and the location of Lana's apartment made it quite feasible. We appreciated the clean apartment, comfy bed, and binder of nearby restaurant recommendations when we came back to the apartment each evening. 

Overall, Lana made our stay as pleasant as possible and I'd definitely recommend her apartment for anyone staying in Seattle! "
1537246,44770203,2015-08-29,35820140,Maura,"I loved my stay at Lana's apartment! The apartment is spacious, clean and equipped with everything I needed and more. I only wish I had extra time to cook in the fantastic kitchen. And Lana was very nice and super accommodating. She also had a lot of great suggestions for the neighborhood and the rest of the city. I highly recommend this apartment and someday when I can return to Capitol Hill (such a great  location), I would love to stay at Lana's again :)"
1537246,45378801,2015-09-02,17722889,Tim,"Lana welcomed us personally and helped us park then gave us a quick tour of the beautiful condo.  She reviewed the rules and guidelines and  told us about the neighborhood.  Since our son lives a block away, we were fairly familiar with the area, but her thoughts were appreciated and we took advantage of her restaurant suggestion.

The place was beautiful in a very nice building.  All amenities were exactly as described and the condo was furnished with great furniture,  reading materials, art and a very well stocked kitchen.

Lana had everything ready to go and we will return because it is such a wonderful place - Thank you Lana!

1537246,46262721,2015-09-09,20402927,Lauren,"Lana was very communicative and helpful.  Her apartment is in a great area in Capitol Hill with many great bars, restaurants and coffee houses within walking distance. It was the perfect place to spend a week in Seattle. "
1537246,47145974,2015-09-16,2895288,Marcus,"We had a great stay at Jana's place. Evertyhing was perfect from the very easy checkin, her recommendations about the neighborhood, the communication and the checkout process. The apartment is quite big, equipped with everything you will need in located in the right spot of Capitol Hill.

Highly recommended Airbnb experience!"
1537246,48163009,2015-09-24,30483107,Rebecca,"We had a great experience staying at Lana's place on Capitol Hill. The instructions she provided ahead of time to get into the apartment were clear and easy to follow. Once inside, there was lots of information about the area, places to eat, things to do, etc. The apartment is beautiful and quiet! There was a brief power outage in the neighborhood during our stay and Lana came over to the building and visited us to let us know what was going on. We loved staying in Capitol Hill and checking out some of the more local establishments. Gorgeous views of downtown and the Space Needle too! All in all, a great place to call home while away from ours!"
1537246,49886550,2015-10-07,6287147,Jim,Lana made me feel very welcome. The apartment was accurately described and very comfortable. It met all of my requirements. The location was great. Close to family and convenient all round
1537246,50468150,2015-10-12,13032411,Nathan,Lana was very kind and accommodating. Her spot is in an absolutely perfect location and the condo itself is beautiful - very homey and comfortable. We loved coming back home to this place. Would hands-down recommend staying at Lana's to anyone!
1537246,53880158,2015-11-14,43358750,Sam,"I had an excellent experience staying at Lana's place on Capitol Hill. First and foremost, Lana is a wonderful host! She provided clear instructions making it easy to check in/out, and was very responsive and helpful throughout the duration of my stay. She also had info on the area, attractions, places to eat, etc...

The apartment itself is beautiful and homey. The layout is great, and the kitchen is setup nicely. In a quiet spot, the location could not be better! It's right in Capitol Hill with easy access to places across the city. Great views of the downtown area to boot. "
1537246,56072392,2015-12-08,43589466,Gene,"All I can say is that Lana has been the perfect host.  The condo apartment was the perfect fit for our trip.  Lana ensured that we had all the necessities, and she also made sure that we knew where to go obtain the things we needed (e.g., groceries, places to eat out, etc ...)  We like to eat in, the kitchen and cooking facilities were perfect, the dining room is convenient and close.  The living room, bedroom, and bath were also very comfortable.  

If available, this is definitely our first pick moving forward on our future trips."
1537246,56478528,2015-12-14,44751609,Jessica,"* This review is on behalf of my parents, who I booked this trip for* Nicely appointed, spacious apartment, conveniently located in popular Capitol Hill neighborhood, with good access to public transportation, eateries, and shopping.  The host provided a binder with comprehensive and useful details about the apartment as well as the neighborhood.  We did not personally meet the host, but our daughter, who lives around the corner, did and found her very personable, helpful, and very quick to respond.  Potential guests should know that this is not an elevator building; it is necessary to walk down several hallways and climb two sets of stairs once inside.  This is in addition to stairs from the sidewalk to the building's entrance which are quite slippery when wet.  Also, the bathtub requires a certain dexterity and flexibility to enter, which could be a problem for people with arthritis or other physical disabilities."
1537246,57449594,2015-12-26,49216625,Carola,"Excellent place and location, very well kept and comfortable. The apartment had everything we needed and lots of space. The host was great, flexible and always available.
We hope to stay there in the future.
Thanks!"
7875887,44240022,2015-08-24,3779714,Jeremy,"Glenn was such a great host and accommodated me at the last minute. This was my first time on Capital Hill and Glenn helped to make it very memorable. His place is very comfortable and he was very welcoming, responsive and caring. If you are looking for a place to stay while in Seattle, this is it! It was bittersweet leaving because I felt so much at home, but I hope to stay there again the next time I am in the city. Five Stars."
7875887,47744795,2015-09-21,17818942,Manville,I had a great time staying at Glenn's place. It is very convenient to the light rail which takes you to the airport. It's close to bars and downtown. Glenn is a great host. He definitely makes me feel very welcome!
7875887,53770469,2015-11-12,1801535,Nathan,"Glenn and Ariel were the most amazing hosts. They have it down to a fine art. They were smiley, friendly, chatty, respectful of space and gave me some super helpful tips for exploring the city. They live in the middle of everything and their apartment is modern and tidy with your own private bathroom and an incredible view from the rooftop. Everything you need. I would absolutely stay here again."
7875887,54027542,2015-11-15,5028159,Rachel,"Staying at Glenn's place could not have been better. Great location, expeditious communication, easy access. Glenn and his brother were affable, helpful, and knowledgeable. Definitely would recommend Glenn as a host and his Capitol Hill condo!"
7875887,56324908,2015-12-12,49783862,Russell,Glenn and Ariel were great hosts. This was my 1st airbnb experience and they made it all very easy. The place was as described and I enjoyed interacting with them both. I will use airbnb again and I recommend Glenn as a host. Well done!
7875887,56612434,2015-12-15,49111541,Tim,"This was my first ever Airbnb experience and j have to say that it was a great one. Glenn and Ariel did a great job of making me feel welcome. It was a nice room and the bed was super comfortable. It is in a great area as well. I especially liked that he left a list of recommendations of things to do. He had a great attitude and he was always willing to help. Thanks for making my trip to Seattle a great one. I would definitely recommend this place if you are planning a visit. 

Thanks again,

Tim and Amanda "
7875887,57059643,2015-12-21,33539546,Koji,Glenn provides a top notch airbnb experience in Seattle. He made the environment very friendly and nice throughout the stay. His neighborhood is a great spot with lots of things to do. Glad to have stayed at Glenns.
7875887,58220421,2016-01-01,49671109,Ali,"We had a great time in Seattle and Glenn's room made it special. Glenn and Ariel were great hosts and great people. We were lucky to spend the New Year's eve with them. They have an excellent view to the space needle from the roof and we could easily see the fireworks without getting stuck in the street traffic.
The room was exactly as it looks in the pictures. And we had access to everything in the kitchen. 
Parking in the Seattle downtown is a nightmare. They have a parking pass to park in the street which still does not guarantee a spot. They kindly gave us the pass and in top of that saved us a space.
We had a great time at their room and I'd recommend it.  "
6154478,33279930,2015-05-26,3720572,Ben & Emily,"We had a great stay at Andy's Greenlake house. The location is convenient : right next to the lake and coffee shops, restaurants, etc. The house had everything we needed for a very comfortable stay! Andy was helpful, responsive, and easy going. Would stay here again!"
6154478,35979988,2015-06-23,28007250,Brittney,"We had a good time at Andrew's home! The location was great, and really close to Greenlake which was awesome!! It was a little loud at night, but other than that, everything was great!  "
6154478,36061970,2015-06-24,36073538,Ali,"Andrew has a beautiful and conveniently located place to offer. He makes everything easy for his guests with on-time updates. The house was clean and as it was listed. Nearby grocery stores, restaurants, convenient public transportation and Green Lake are big plus. 
Totally satisfied with our visit!  "
6154478,36226783,2015-06-26,11312903,Anne,"Great location, great house. Andrew's new townhome has all the conveniences, and sits conveniently within a couple blocks of Green Lake, one of Seattle's recreational gems. You can get anywhere easily by bus or car. Since the weather was phenomenal we just enjoyed the proximity to the water and bustling neighborhood. The arrangement and communications were hassle-free. We'd stay at Andrew's again and our dog, who has never spent so much time on the beach, would move there."
6154478,37374212,2015-07-06,35011009,Shunbin,Andrew was really easy to get in contact with and responds right away. The listing is in a very nice neighborhood and the photos and description is very accurate. It was nice to have parking available too since it's so hard to find street parking in Seattle. 
6154478,40362153,2015-07-30,12575330,Megan,"Place was perfect for our needs.   Cozy and well-kept.    Andrew was very accommodating in letting us in early.    Green lake is a great neighborhood with terrific pubs, restaurants and of course the lake for running, walking and swimming.   A terrific stay!"
6154478,40981327,2015-08-03,38626765,Janelynn,"Clean, modern townhome! Great location, only 20mins from downtown Seattle using the E-line express bus. Sizeable kitchen with newer appliances to cook with during our stay, though the microwave didn't work. Fast, reliable wifi and Netflix via the xBox. Overall great stay! Will book again :)"
6154478,42047175,2015-08-10,3058348,Siobhan,Andrew' place was perfect for our 1 night stay in Seattle. The townhouse is big and clean and located in a really nice neighbourhood next to a lake.
