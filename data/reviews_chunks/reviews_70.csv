8412143,51809920,2015-10-24,46395023,Michael,"Kevin's listing is great for anyone visiting Seattle. It's conveniently located in Fremont, which is a short Uber ride to anywhere in the city. The apartment is clean and Kevin is easily reachable. Everything is provided for you and the property is very welcoming. Electronic locks make life easy. "
8412143,52977072,2015-11-03,20442667,Kal,Great and convenient place to spend the weekend while visiting friends in Seattle. Plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Fremont has always been one of my favorite neighborhoods and it did not disappoint. 
8412143,54833714,2015-11-23,32215190,Francine,Great little place ver clean and tidy. Good walking distance to all shops and cafes in the Fremont area. The hosts were very prompt and accommodating. 
8412143,55497542,2015-12-01,3273603,Donna,"This flat was located in a perfect location for me, right near the Fremont shops and steps away from Queen Anne by a quick walk across the bridge.  The flat has the basics and was lovely for my needs.  The check in was quite easy which was nice on a late night arrival.  "
8412143,57021099,2015-12-21,46187201,Margo,"Host made certain we knew of possible interruptions in plumbing because of repairs in upstairs unit.
Coffee maker was quickly repaired.
Manager offered to meet us to help with tv."
8412143,57607744,2015-12-27,7876745,Kayla,"Everything was exactly as listed, and the apartment was cozy. Street parking was easy, and the location could not have been better! The keyless entry was very convenient, as well. I would absolutely stay here again!"
6378563,33314314,2015-05-26,19578891,Luke,"We had a great stay at Samantha's downstairs garden unit. Our original reservation was cancelled by another owner last minute, but fortunately, Samantha had just recently listed the Terrace Garden and booking with her was a breeze. She had a keypad lock installed a few days before our visit and it worked perfectly. Apparently there was a problem with being able to vacuum the unit before we arrived, but Samantha was very up front and even left us a 6 pack of her favorite local beer as an apology. We loved the brews and could hardly notice the vacuum problem. We loved wallingford's quiet streets and its proximity to ballard, fremont and the U-district (tons of cool places to eat, drink and shop). We had a great time staying in Wallingford and exploring Seattle. Would absolutely rent from again!"
6378563,34157846,2015-06-05,3010460,Tony,We stayed here for a week.  Samantha's rental is excellent.   It's in a really great location and had everything we needed for the week.  We stayed here with our 3-year-old and the apt is very child-friendly.  The apt is very clean and well-organized.  Samantha was very responsive and easy to communicate with.  Highly recommended!
6378563,37254145,2015-07-05,29422258,Justin,"Samantha is a really really good host, we had a really happy time in Seattle."
6378563,41760205,2015-08-09,34876323,Hanson,"Samantha and Casey were very welcoming and accommodating in terms of helping us set the place up for the trip with our baby and two dogs. They had an old crib and high chair that worked great. 

Great location, with lots of little restaurants nearby and a short drive to downtown or the University district."
6378563,45108521,2015-08-31,828031,Mike,"This was the best Airbnb I've stay at! Samantha was super easy to communicate with and answered questions very quickly. She left she had detailed directions for everything at the house which answered all our questions. Her home was super clean, beautifully decorated and an easy 10 minute drive into downtown. The air mattresses were super comfortable. We felt at home and relaxed with her place. Will totally seek her out again for a return trip!"
8902887,52664462,2015-10-31,14170770,Carolyn,"We had a great stay with Julie and George in Seattle!  Julie responded back within an hour to our request to book, and it was a very easy experience.  

The booking is a mother-in-law apartment on the bottom level of the house.  We were able to enter privately from around the side.  The apartment consisted of one bedroom (with a comfy bed!), one bathroom, a kitchen (with refrigerator and stove), and a living room area.  It was plenty of space for the two of us. The apartment was clean and we had everything we needed for our stay.  

The nicest part was the ease with which we could get into downtown Seattle.  There are two light rail stations within a mile or so from the house.  The closest one is a half a mile away, and it is very easy to get there.  The Westlake stop (downtown) is 8 stops away, and it takes less than 20 minutes on the rail.  We didn't travel on it to the airport, but Sea-Tac was 4 stops away in the opposite direction.  The location made it really easy to be in the city if we wanted to be.  There were also lots of other little restaurants/shops/etc within walking distance from the house.  We ate at a few great brunch places that were very easy to get to.  

Overall, we had a great experience.  We would definitely stay there again.  "
8902887,53414118,2015-11-08,43891565,Trilby,"This was a lovely place to stay! I had the best night's sleep as the bed was unbelievably comfortable and the bedroom was dark and quiet. The whole apartment is cosy and sweet, and Julie was lovely to correspond with. We definitely recommend this place!"
8902887,54040823,2015-11-15,655450,Tara,"This apartment was very comfy and cozy with lots of privacy and easy street parking. Julie and George had extra blankets, a space heater, tea and coffee for the cold rainy Seattle nights. Cute restaurants close by too!"
8902887,54663853,2015-11-22,8232822,Cady,Lovely homey experience!
8902887,55146214,2015-11-28,1518136,Melissa,"Julie and George communicated very clearly about how to access the apartment, where to park and answered all the questions I had before we arrived. The location was very central to where we were going and there were a lot of great stores and shops around. The apartment was everything we needed for a weekend. I would recommend Julie & George's space to anyone because the apartment was the perfect size and very comfortable. "
8902887,58184958,2016-01-01,34475960,Austin,Julie & George's place was fantastic! Really clean and had everything we needed for a great New Year's in Seattle. Close to the freeway and decent street parking right out front. The tenants upstairs were super nice and respectful. Also the bed was really comfortable. Would definitely stay again. 
7956337,56897997,2015-12-19,12762254,Marina,"Mehrit and Roco,
My stay at your place has been beyond my expectations. I feel blessed to have been your first guest. I loved the privacy, cute place you have set up here, full of love vibrations. The view and setting is amazing, only 3 minute walk for beautiful vieuw on Lake washington and much more. This place has real hosts, living from the heart and that's what touched me the most, and... Mehrit, i got so inspired by your stories of Ethiopia, you felt like a sister to me. All and only the best for you two. Marina"
7956337,57177013,2015-12-22,51371639,Sarka,"We really enjoyed our stay in this room and house. Mehrit is really nice host, she advised us what to see and even gave us a ride. Airbnb place including kitchen and bathroom is really nice and clean. We couldnt choose better place in Seattle. "
7956337,57841702,2015-12-29,24577442,Sean,"Mehrit is a very very sweet lady. She provided way more than what one would need. Great neighborhood, great host, great stay. 

heads up rules are strict for no friends over, you have to put them on your air b n b list , which can be very expensive. "
7873789,46243173,2015-09-08,35427163,Manrup,"We had a wonderful stay! Lisa and her husband were so prompt and accommodating to us. We were vey pleased with our stay, thank you so much! "
7873789,47299790,2015-09-17,14796039,Adam,"Lisa & Karl were outstanding hosts!  They began with clear, timely, friendly communication and were wonderfully accommodating.  When we arrived, they were so pleasant and welcoming and made us and our girls feel right at home.  We have two little girls and they embraced them and extended even their own personal living space to make our stay that much more comfortable.  Lisa and Karl have a Super friendly dog and our girls loved playing with her and taking her on walks!  The home is situated in such a beautiful family oriented area of North Seattle with great neighborhood walks and parks all outside the front door.  Safe, friendly, peaceful!  Inside, the home is so nicely lit naturally with plenty of windows and the layout felt wide open and super spacious.  And with a piano and wood stove, the space also felt very homelike.  Furnishings were ample and the beds were more than comfortable!  We completely enjoyed our stay with Lisa and Karl and highly recommend their home for a stop-over stay, transition, or extended stay!  Thank you…you made our return home to Seattle this year incredibly pleasant!"
7873789,48114940,2015-09-23,20213978,Mizuki,"Their house is very clean and has two bedrooms, and big living room. It so comfortable and quiet. They are so sweet, and very king. They payed attention for comfortable stay. "
7873789,48340472,2015-09-25,13202624,Goldy,"Lisa house was perfect for our quick stay. She was very easy to reach and her husband met us shortly after we arrived. The place is clean, comfortable and included amenities (e.g. coffee/tea).  I'd definitely recommend! "
7873789,48761135,2015-09-28,23047879,Peter,"What great hosts! I cannot express with words how overjoyed myself and my family were with our stay with Lisa and Karl. They made us feel warm, welcome and comfortable during our stay in Seattle. We would stay with them again in the future without hesitation! Looking for a great neighborhood with a great layout of living/sleeping/bathing accommodations? Look no further. The kicker is fantastic hosts that genuinely care about their guests! "
7873789,49663437,2015-10-05,30204818,Kit,Very warm and comfortable place to have stayed.The host couple is very nice guys ，we felt at home during the stay，highly recommended to others.
7873789,49869293,2015-10-06,45755952,Aaron,The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The description of their suite was very accurate and it was neat and clean. The neighborhood was quiet and seemed to be in a safe location. We would recommend these airbnb hosts to anyone going through the Seattle area. 
7873789,50233371,2015-10-10,1353461,Nick,Lisa and Karl were very communicative in the lead-up to our arrival. They have a beautiful house in a beautiful neighbourhood! They even cooked us Banana bread. Twice! And it was delicious. Very kind and generous hosts.
7873789,50592299,2015-10-12,46044142,Vilde,"Lisa and Karl were really nice hosts! They showed us around in the apartment which was very clean and tidy. Me and my friends was staying over there one night to celebrate my birthday in Seattle and we are very glad we chose this place. It's in a really nice neighborhood and we felt very safe. Different kitchen equipment was available and we were also offered fruit, chocolate and coffee. 

Thank you for being so nice! It was perfect for my birthday get away :)  "
7873789,51400325,2015-10-19,6960367,Emily,Karl and Lisa were amazing hosts - went above and beyond in every way!  Their apartment is in a GREAT part of town - close to Ballard and bus line. This place was SPOTLESS clean and they had everything you could possibly want. I would definitely stay with them again next time through Seattle!
7873789,52186766,2015-10-26,47145091,Todd,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful. We arrived a little earlier than planned and we were warmly greeted and shown the space. It was absolutely perfect for our group and had easy access to Ballard. The amenities were comfortable and the rooms were very clean. There were Seattle guidebooks set out, as well as other books if you wanted to spend some time inside reading. We all agreed that we would definitely return and stay here again."
7873789,52384900,2015-10-28,3570203,Jeff,We really enjoyed our stay here. Very clean comfortable place in a great neighborhood with lots of great bars and coffee shops nearby. Our hosts were very quick to respond to messages  before and during our stay. Would stay here again for sure!
7873789,53567202,2015-11-09,40993483,Omimah,That was my first try to book in airbnb and because of that clean nice home and the great hosts it's not going to be my last
7873789,54925365,2015-11-25,42491149,Yue,"Awesome experience:) Truly appreciate Lisa prepared everything and also important information warmly for (website hidden), house is comfortable, and with the yamaha piano must be an exciting moment for anyone who love music. Wish to visit again."
7873789,54979543,2015-11-27,2845554,Amy,Thanks for making us feel like family. :)
7873789,55560701,2015-12-02,2845554,Amy,"Lisa and Karl were great hosts. They welcomed and sent us off with freshly baked banana bread, which my family and I devoured! Treated us like family and very accommodating. Responded to communications quickly and place is very well kept and clean. Hope to see you guys again the next time we visit! Thanks!"
7873789,55736733,2015-12-05,8804351,Kelli,"Staying here was a 100% positive experience.  Everything was so well thought out, and the accommodations couldn't have been more perfect.  I didn't realize that we would have our own door to the outside...RIGHT to where our car was parked...perfect!  The hosts were so friendly and obviously do this not to make money, but because they love it.  They were so helpful, even when the other mom had some complications with a car situation and had to leave luggage to be picked up later.  The hosts offered dinner ideas and even gave us coupons.  But once all the chat was done, they left us alone to have privacy.  The suite itself was spotless and I just wished we could have stayed longer...next time for sure!!!  "
7873789,55929446,2015-12-07,2733142,John,"Lisa and her husband were wonderful hosts - so friendly and quick to respond to any questions before, during and after the visit.   the place is very cozy, impeccably clean, the beds comfortable and the neighbourhood very safe and quiet.   the kitchen truly is just a small kitchenette so no where to cook (that is not a complaint, just a point to note).   We would definitely stay again in the future."
7873789,56068766,2015-12-08,41853723,Mara,"My friends and I had a wonderful experience at Lisa's place! Her husband greeted us upon arrival and was very kind and welcoming, even though we arrived later than expected. They happened to be having people over for dinner and extended an invite to our group of 4, but we already had plans in the city. We had lots of privacy but felt that we could easily ask for assistance if anything came up. I highly recommend this location, we had a great time! "
7873789,56675714,2015-12-16,28812678,Yunjie,"Lisa and her husband are very nice person. They cooked bread for us when we arrived. And they provided maps, coupons for visitors. The house is nice and clean. Their puppy and cat are cute. 
One thing is we only found three not four.
All in all, it's a nice time!"
7873789,57045964,2015-12-21,46025672,Michelle,Lisa and Karl's home was in a wonderful area not far from many places to eat or drink famous Seattle coffee. The area was the perfect size and stocked with everything you'd expect from two of the warmest hosts I've ever had. I've never felt more at home! 
7873789,57509835,2015-12-27,2127907,William,Perfect accommodations. Quiet with attentive hosts. We would recommend!
7096107,37122989,2015-07-04,37278388,Manuel,"Perry was out of town during our visit, but was very friendly over the phone and quick to reply to any questions we had.  His backyard was very quiet and the tents were set up with an air mattress, blankets, and pillows.  We stayed 2 nights and found this location to be very convenient via drive or public transportation to downtown.  If you're into glamping, this is the place to stay!"
7096107,39349418,2015-07-22,2970216,Chad,"The camping in Perry's backyard is exactly as described, but the real benefit to his setup is Perry himself. We had originally planned to camp with Perry for four nights, but our plans changed unexpectedly after one night. Perry was incredibly gracious and immediately refunded us the three nights remaining on our reservation, no questions asked. I wish every host was this easy to work with! "
7096107,39852018,2015-07-26,20373329,Sarah,"Perry was a great host! He was flexible and welcomed us right in when we arrived earlier than expected. He provided a cooler with water, sparkling water, and beer, and later left a bottle of wine for us as well as a Keurig machine with lots of selections of coffee and hot chocolate for the morning. We were in Seattle for the Mariners game, and we arrived early enough in the morning to have a beer and a chat with Perry and his dad before we left for the 1:00 PM game. We were instantly comfortable with Perry and chatted easily with him about Seattle, and life in general. He gave us lots of good tips on places to eat and info about the area. His house was in a prime location for us, and he gave us great directions on how to get to Safeco Field which was fairly close by. Light rail is a short walk from his place and goes right to the stadium, and driving time was less than 10 minutes from his house to the field. The actual accommodations in Perry's backyard were rustic, with a smaller tent and combined outdoor shower and portable toilet. We didn't end up using those as Perry graciously offered us the bathroom in his house. The tent and mattress were a little small for us both, but it was manageable. We were late coming back to his place in the evening and we left fairly early in the morning, but coming and going was easy through the side gate. We enjoyed a glass of wine on the candlelit patio before bed. Overall it was a good inexpensive place to crash for the night, and we really appreciated the good location as well as Perry's great hospitality and thoughtfulness :) "
7096107,40182280,2015-07-28,39354696,Jordan,The tents were surprisingly cozy and the neighborhood was surprisingly quiet at night as well. It was great to be so close to public transportation and the have street parking as well! 
7096107,41153238,2015-08-04,38969647,Brian,Perry's oasis in the city was great. Perry was warm and welcoming to his space and city. I enjoyed my stay. The weather was great and the close proximity to light rail was huge for me. I would stay again in Sven or Ole's tent when I return to Seattle! Thanks
7096107,41299730,2015-08-05,40345695,Sam,"Camping was fun and Perry was great. Good time for sure. Also, I had to cancel early, which Perry was cool w/ and that was really nice. When I stayed, it was a little pricy for what it was, but it was a BUSY weekend in Seattle; supply and demand, amirite?"
7096107,41568148,2015-08-07,8493147,Brad,"Perry was awesome. Hooked me up with a great Mexican place for a late dinner, awesome tent, and one of the friendliest dogs ever. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Perry!"
7096107,42081626,2015-08-10,3770406,Aj,"Perry made me feel like more like family than a guest. I had a great stay at Perry's glamping spot. The description of the site was spot on, couldn't have asked for anything else. The neighborhood was nice, parking was easy and right out front with a good amount of restaurants and bars within walking distance. I got to hang out and play with Walter as well, he was a great dog and glamping buddy. "
7096107,43003633,2015-08-16,41395525,Joseph,Perry was great. His place was chill. He provided awesome breakfast. The tent was ready before I arrived. The jacuzzi was nice after a long day. He even let me use his computer and loaned me a bike (though I imagine this was a bit unusual). We even did a crossfit class together. Perry and his Airbnb setup are legit. I highly recommend. 
7096107,44085449,2015-08-23,39299827,Chen,nice host，friendly dog，good location，low price。
6901218,37223599,2015-07-05,25242863,Denisse,Staying at Mark's place for our short trip was perfect! The location allowed us to get around seamlessly and his recommendations were well appreciated! Thanks again Mark! 
6901218,37890051,2015-07-11,36368625,Thomas,Everything was great and Mark stayed in touch and responded quickly. We enjoyed our stay and checking out the neighborhood. 
6901218,38025419,2015-07-12,12673433,Michael,"Mark was easy to reach and quick to respond, and he made the entire experience effortless. The property was described accurately and the photos gave us a good sense of the place -- it was just what we wanted. We had a great time!"
6901218,39789182,2015-07-26,34530429,Greg,"Great location, we had a very comfortable stay and economical stay given the hotel rates when we were booking.  

Host made it very easy and provided everything we needed.  Very responsive even before arrival to make sure we were up to speed as this was our first time using Air BNB.  "
6901218,40765609,2015-08-02,2287841,Shiva,"Mark checked with us in the morning to make sure we have arrived OK and was really communicative with any needs we had. Neighborhood was great, and apartment was as pictured. Nothing really to complain, overall a great experience"
6901218,45944353,2015-09-07,169365,Peter,"Mark's place was as he described it, and suited us very well for our weekend at Bumbershoot.  It was a quick 5-10 minute walk to the Seattle Centre.  It's an older walkable neighbourhood so lots of restaurant choices if you want - we mostly cooked in Mark's suite - full fridge and stove to use.  "
6901218,46804816,2015-09-13,43222157,Katherine,"A reasonable price for such a good location. We could walk to the space needle, kerry park, and even pike place market (about 40 mins). It was also nice to have the place to ourselves. The apartment is basic but clean and compared to a hotel in the same area, the price was good."
6901218,47773845,2015-09-21,21224024,Luba,"We had a great stay in Seattle. Mark was so nice to let us check out a little later so we didn't have to deal with headache of leaving our bags somewhere while still in town, our airplane was leaving later in the afternoon. Loved the city and the fact that we stayed so close to everything made it easier to get around and enjoy it. Thank you Mark!"
4417792,22549787,2014-11-09,5163876,Dean,"Amy and Darik were wonderful hosts.  Welcoming yet unobtrusive.  We were welcomed with a basket of treats and information for the area, shown the basics of the accommodations after being met according to our arrival time and then left on our own.  Everything we needed was there so we had no need to contact the host further however leading up to the stay I was always answered promptly and politely.  This particular unit does not have a dining area to accommodate 6 people but we managed to make it work.  The number of great places to eat in the area really meant we were only having breakfast or snacks in the unit.  Might have been different if we had not completely lucked out with great weather for the second week of November."
4417792,22959518,2014-11-18,4881797,May,Darik's team was very responsive and we enjoyed our stay. The apartment was just as described and well furnished. It was in a very convenient location and we would consider staying here again on our next visit to Seattle!
4417792,23638312,2014-12-07,2731344,Mathew,"Our stay at this beautiful Brownstone was great! Our flight was over an hour late getting in to Seattle, and didn't arrive until 8pm, but they still had someone waiting to let us in, give us a tour (all with a smile on their face!).

The apartment itself was great for what we needed. The rooms were good size, the bathroom was clean, and although we didn't use the kitchen, it was updated and had everything you might need.

This was our first time in Seattle, so we wanted to stay someplace where we could easily access everything. We didn't have a rental car, but easily walked to the Space Needle (10 min), Pike Place Market (10 min), and just about every Seattle landmark. When we did have to go further out of the way, it was easy to catch an Uber, Lyft or use Car2Go.

Our only complaint would be the noise. Because this unit is close to ground level, and the central location invites a lot of foot traffic (and regular auto traffic), it could be a bit noisy. Not enough to be a complete nuisance, but there nonetheless. 

We would definitely stay again!
"
4417792,24148380,2014-12-21,10383784,Erika,"The brownstone was great! A beautiful unit - exactly as pictured. It was super well stocked with dishes, linens, and toiletries, and everything in the unit was easy to find and well labelled. We only stayed two nights, but could easily have 'lived' there for weeks. Also - great location - walking distance to everything we wanted. And right beside Top Pot Donuts. ;)
Our hosts were lovely - friendly, accommodating, accessible, and professional. The instructions they provided for check-in and check-out were nice and clear. We would absolutely stay there again.   "
4417792,25970922,2015-01-31,24611047,Heather,"We stayed for 3 nights here, they were very welcoming in giving us an early check in and had someone waiting for us to show us the place. It was just as expected! My big thing in staying anywhere is how comfy the beds are and trust me when I say they were amazing! It has everything you need, the location is great. Do not worry about the noise, it dies down around 11 or 1130pm. All in all we loved every minute!"
4417792,26361894,2015-02-10,16922189,Liane,We loved this brownstone! It was everything described and more. Fully equipped with the necessities and AMAZING beds!!!! Great location and easy access to the city and tourist spots. Top Pot donuts right next door was especially great for our morning coffee runs!
4417792,28904879,2015-03-31,12680231,Kim,"This was a very smooth process and we had a very easy time booking and locating the apt. Key transfer was fine after speaking with darik and finding out we needed to contact sally.
very beautiful place. Very comfy beds (even the couch!)
"
4417792,29723582,2015-04-12,25520357,Jason,"Perfect stay. We come in town quite a bit for coffee business and this was a great place to be. Staff took such great care to be sure everything was perfect.  Always able to quickly answer questions via phone or email and set us up perfect.

Thanks very much we will likely be back"
4417792,35212211,2015-06-16,20909334,Wynne,"Smooth transitions at check in and check out.  Great location for us, very central.  Place was clean, beds were fine, everything worked out well.  When we had questions, the property manager always picked up the phone.  "
4417792,36951910,2015-07-03,1859461,Jenece,"Well located property with easy access to tourist locations and great restaurants. We were unlucky however with the heat, with no AC, fans were provided but one additional fan would have been welcomed.

Overall it was a lovely stay.

4417792,37828570,2015-07-11,25504967,Nick & Sara,Great stay in Seattle.  Right next to Top Dougnuts and close to the Monorail.  Our host met us at the condo when checking in and everything was great.  Look forward to coming back and using this condo again. 
4417792,39262240,2015-07-22,7433570,Andrew,"We had a great visit at this property near downtown Seattle. The host was easy to communicate with and met us at the property to orient us. The building has historic character and the space was tastefully decorated and a great value considering we needed an extra room for our kids. Easy walk to the major attractions, shopping, and restaurants."
4417792,40072912,2015-07-28,24302502,Rachel,"This place is great! It's just as cute as it is in the pictures. Every room is very comfortable. We love that it comes with a parking spot. It's in a perfect location. We were in walking distance of everything that we wanted to see and do, including the Space Needle and the Pike Place Market. We didn't drive anywhere! The only downside was that it was noisy at night due to it's location. I suggest staying there, but bringing a pair of earplugs. Fantastic stay! :) I would recommend it!"
4417792,40560464,2015-08-01,6445656,Karen,This apartment is in a great location and perfectly fit our family of 4. It is beautifully appointed and quite charming. Thank you so much for a great home during our visit.
4417792,41193784,2015-08-05,24550971,Marc,"Really enjoyed our couple of days in Seattle, the Brownstone is in a great location with all the required amenities.
Felt like being at home."
4417792,44451001,2015-08-26,10142323,Cale,"Nice place, best place I've probably stayed in ever with airbnb"
4417792,45245026,2015-09-01,21973435,Ravi,"As advertised and unbelievable location.  We had three very comfortable beds and were right in the heart of downtown.  I would gladly recommend to a friend and would be happy to stay again.  Street level noise on a weekend could be a problem for some, but I had no issue (and neither did any of my friends).  Bathrooms and kitchens had everything we needed.  Added bonus for the organization of the kitchen."
4417792,45533021,2015-09-03,42207354,Joan,"It was nice and it is right in downtown, but it was a bit noisy during nights. Anyway, their kitchen is pretty nice!"
4417792,47068137,2015-09-15,8083238,Mike,"Great experience, apartment is very clean and spacious. Neighborhood is in the middle of everything, lots of bars and restaurants. Slightly loud at night but not too bad."
4417792,51611382,2015-10-22,13329947,(Leo) Dennis,We had a great time. The kitchen was perfect!
4417792,52671545,2015-11-01,33002387,Jandra,"Check-in was easy and prompt.   After the quick tour of the  brownstone, any and all questions were answered.   The brownstone was exactly as advertised in the pictures.  It was well appointed and gave our stay a more personal feel in comparison to staying at a hotel. We loved the location and its proximity to everything.  The street noise can be a little much if you aren't used to it but nothing that would deter us from staying here again"
4417792,53382838,2015-11-08,3261159,Whitney,"We had a fantastic stay in Seattle. The host was at the apartment upon arrival. The apartment was in top condition and perfect for our needs of attending a conference downtown.  The apartment is a bit load at night, so ear plugs were key for restful night sleep. I  plan to contact Darik the next time I am in town."
4417792,53717618,2015-11-11,44317891,Sarah,"It was wonderful staying here. It was a very convenient location and the amenities were very nice. The only downside is that if you are a light sleeper, you'll need earplugs since you are just above ground level with a busy city street."
9089308,55856478,2015-12-06,50086552,Kajal,"We moved from Los Angeles, and were running behind schedule looking for an Airbnb. We thought that at 9pm at night no one was going to answer our emails or phone calls. Our host Caren, answered our email and even messaged us via text to let us know about the Airbnb and all the formalities. She went above and beyond to make sure we had everything from check in to check out. She made sure to be available for any questions we had! She was extremely friendly, courteous, and welcoming. Caren told us everything about the surrounding areas, where everything is, and all the tourist attractions. 

The listing was very accurate! What I liked about the neighborhood was that it was in the center of everything. Just like Caren described, Pikes Place was a block away, the art museum was around the corner. Everything was within walking distance. The neighborhood felt safe enough to walk by yourself. "
4660517,24065052,2014-12-18,9759178,Stan,"This was an amazing place, so close to downtown, and in a really cool neighborhood. It is exactly as Rebecca describes. The loft is a bit tricky to get into, but the space is so cozy and inviting. The cottage was very quiet and very clean. She even left a little welcome note and was quick to respond to any questions. Highly recommended. 
"
4660517,24279767,2014-12-24,9014427,Kathryn,Rebecca's loft was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. Check-in/out was seamless and the apartment had everything we needed including great smelling soap :)
4660517,24757302,2015-01-02,24398106,Lisa,"It is a cute house , I and my friend love it very much, we walked from downtown to home just 40 minutes,it's quiet place ,thanks Rebecca"
4660517,24872537,2015-01-03,11067695,Raquel,The cabin was amazing and so cute! Perfect location perfect for two people! Bed was cozy and the place was just warm and lovely altogether. I didn't get to meet Rebecca but the contact i had with her she was so sweet! 
4660517,25141375,2015-01-07,7992921,Dana,"From the initial inquiry up until I had departed and reached my home, all my communication with Rebecca was superb. While we never met in person, from our correspondence I could tell she was extremely friendly, caring, and organized. 
I was coming in from a long transit from Australia and needed one night to break up the travel time back to Vancouver. She was flexible with check-in/out times and promptly answered all the concerns I had prior to arriving.
From the hand-written welcome note and map to the delicious teas she left out, the loft was very inviting and cozy. The decoration is beautiful! Shower supplies smelled great, and I found it very helpful that she had left tape, pens, and scissors on the shelf without my asking, as I had a few items to mail out.
As an avid animal/cat lover, Lonnie and Peanut more than made up for the lack of wifi (a coffee shop less than a block away provides that, if needed)! Such a sweet, goofy, and entertaining pair of felines. Their food + litter is kept in the furthest corner of the home so you don't notice any smells.
This is a quiet neighbourhood, which I was grateful for. It only took about 5 minutes to walk up to Broadway, and another 15-20 to get to the busy part of Capitol Hill. However, there is a convenience store, retail shops, a few bars, & a coffee shop all within a 2 block radius!
I highly recommend this listing! I look forward to returning :)"
4660517,25451371,2015-01-16,25698148,Chris,"The little urban cabin was lovely (and larger than I expected).  We walked up to a restaurant on Broadway, visited the pub a half-block away, and enjoyed a latte at the nearby Top Pot Doughnuts.  The location was great!  But we spent much of our time in the cabin, which was a warm and friendly place for conversations.  Rebecca's communication was flawless, and I would stay again."
4660517,25560512,2015-01-19,25508405,Mark,"Thank you for the perfect stay! House was as promised, great neighborhood, cute note including local highlights...and I got to bring RUBY! (my dog) THX!"
4660517,25689003,2015-01-23,6542542,Carol,"So, first of all, this place is ADORABLE and perfectly unique. I've lived in this neighborhood for years and didn't know this little nook of cabins was even there. 

Secondly, Rebecca was extremely accommodating -- she even moved her cats out of the house for our stay so our little fuzzball didn't overcrowd her home. She also made sure we arrived and had everything we needed.

Thirdly, this is a great location. But I'm biased as a returning local : ) I highly recommend staying here if you have plans to be in Seattle -- it provides easy access to all the main areas of town by public transportation, car, or bicycle."
4660517,25868558,2015-01-27,20370684,Cali,"Rebecca's place was amazing. It truly felt like we were in an enchanted little forest home in the middle of a really fun neighborhood. The place was cozy and tidy.  Not only that but Rebecca left a little map of the neighborhood with great recommendations of the local bars, restaurants and shops. We had an awesome time at Single Shot and Sun Liquors that was within a 5 min walk from the place. We would definitely stay there again and again!"
4660517,26684742,2015-02-17,21783657,Jennifer,"My first visit to Seattle was made epic by Rebecca's awesome cabin. 
LOCATION: Could not be better. Capitol Hill is a mellow yet happening neighborhood. Steps from the cabin are varied restaurants, bring-a-book-and-stay-forever coffee shops, and quirky boutiques. So much of Seattle’s best is in walking distance (or a short uber ride if you don't want to deal with hills) away. I walked everywhere, from the Frye to Chihuly Gardens and as a solo female traveler I felt safe. 
ACCOMMODATIONS: Exactly as pictured. The loft bedroom was such a treat, I felt like I was sleeping in the trees. The decor is beautiful, very ""PWN cool"". A lot of effort has obviously gone into the place and my favorite details were the Puget Sound colored shower tiles, the classic kitchen floor, and the to be respected vinyl collection (bummed no turntable to give em a spin on… what a tease!).
HOST: My messaging with Rebecca ahead of the trip was quickly responded to and she was very accommodating. Although out of town during my stay, her friend took great care of me. Flawless.
TOP TIP: For those coming from SeaTac Airport. Take the Central Link light rail ($2.75 as of 02/2015) to the last stop Westlake and then hop in a taxi at the station's curb to the cabin (approx. $10). Fast, easy, and cheap!"
4660517,27785867,2015-03-11,10546665,Bridgette,"Our stay in the cabin was perfect for a short getaway to Seattle. Rebecca was communicative and flexible throughout the booking and check-in process, which made the trip so easy. The cabin itself is absolutely charming with lots of light and everything we needed. I made a special request to hang out with the cats who normally spend the night elsewhere when guests are in town and we were constantly amused and delighted by their antics. To add to an already great experience, Rebecca offered to send a few items we forgot back to Portland. We couldn't have asked for a better place, host, and overall Airbnb  experience. "
4660517,28224211,2015-03-20,2050686,Chris,"I only spent one night at Rebecca's urban cabin, but it was one of the best AirBnB experiences I have had so far.  The cabin was very charming and in the heart of a great location to explore Seattle.  Rebecca's attention to detail and design aesthetic made the experience more akin to staying at boutique hotel (without the room service of course!) than simply sleeping in someone's spare room.  Highly recommended. "
4660517,28547452,2015-03-25,14700373,Pamela,"Even though we only spent one night in Rebecca's cabin, we loved every minute of it!  We appreciated the time she took to create a map with all these cute places that were within walking distance. The cabin itself was very charming and cozy. We even had the pleasure of having her 2 cuddly cats as our roomies for the night which made the experience a lot more cozy.  I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a prime Seattle location. "
4660517,29008785,2015-04-02,29336380,Trey,"We had a wonderful time at Rebecca's cabin. She was extremely communicative and flexible. We stayed with our 3 month old daughter and getting in and out of the loft was a little challange but we knew full well what we were getting into before our stay. 
The location of the cabin is perfect. Great neighborhood and close enough that you could walk to a lot of sites. 
We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend the cabin!! "
4660517,29838472,2015-04-13,28592146,Dylan,"Rebecca and Brett were easy to communicate with. Our stay was so great that we didn't really need to contact them, but they were available if we needed something. We were able to check-in early with little notice, which was really convenient. The loft was clean, cozy, and conveniently located. I would recommend it for anyone (except those who can't climb a ladder)!"
4660517,30367619,2015-04-20,61664,Danny,"Great house in a great neighborhood.  Rebecca made everything easy and comfortable. The cabin is definitely a unique place to stay in Seattle, and its walkable to lots of great restaurants and bars.  "
4660517,30828584,2015-04-27,28013550,Andrew,"Great place, in a perfect location to get around Capitol Hill.  Rebecca & Grant are happy to help with anything & were quick to respond to any queries that I had about the area.  The place has two cute cats, that once I got the hang of, were great company! "
4660517,30958307,2015-04-29,12056315,Nichole,We absolutely LOVED our stay here. Everything was as shown and more. The nestle of cottages was so welcoming and the neighborhood was in walking distance to so many great spots. We requested they leave the kitties and were so pleasantly surprised with how sweet and cuddly they were. It was amazing to see them move up and down that ladder. We would definitely stay here again. :) A++
4660517,32066954,2015-05-13,73310,Matt,"I absolutely loved staying in this cabin! The neighborhood is great - nice restaurants, coffee shops, and retail stores all within walking distance. Rebecca is a wonderful host and went out of her way to make accommodations for me. The cabin is charming, clean and cozy. I couldn't have asked for a better Airbnb experience. "
4660517,32618941,2015-05-19,13999081,Meredith,"The cabin is in a great location, coffee shops/restaurants close by and an easy walk to downtown. Rebecca was super easy to communicate with and check in/out was very simple. The kitties are very active and like to snuggle in bed, they get up and down the ladder very easily. Overall a unique place to stay in Seattle. "
4660517,33127041,2015-05-25,103474,Heidi,"First off, the place is cozy and adorable and couldn't be better situated - right in Capitol Hill, a fun, hipster hood with tons of bars, restaurants, cafes, and shops. I was stoked to discover she was only  2 blks from an awesome restaurant I'd been recommended to eat at and already had a reservation for - Single Shot. And then Top Pot coffee and doughnuts is in the same block, which is a great morning stop!
Rebecca is a great host - she went out of her way to accommodate us, including coming back into town when the key to get in wasn't there when we arrived. Although we didn't meet, she was super responsive and did whatever she could to make our stay great. I appreciated the guide to the hood she left too, very helpful!
One thing I'd have to recommend is to opt out of having the cats there when you stay. We are mega cat lovers and thought it would be fun, but they kept us up all night. They're good, sweet cats - just decided to go wild at night since ""mom"" was away. :) I'd recommend Rebecca's place for the awesome PNW vibe and location!"
4660517,33386650,2015-05-27,30027989,Sarah,"Rebecca was an outstanding host! She is incredibly accommodating and understanding. Though I hadn't met her in person, she kept in touch throughout my stay. The cottage is PERFECT. It's quaint, quite, and the location is ideal. We had free parking with no time limit roughly a 30-second walk from her home. The cats are adorable and very plauful. Every detail of this apartment is perfect. (The guitar was even tuned.) If you're even debating this loft, stop. Just do it. You won't be disappointed."
4660517,35070945,2015-06-15,28754262,Laura,Rebecca was a very kind host! We had a very short stay here. The little cottage is very cute.  My husband is not a cat person (I don't mind cats) so it really was stressful for him.  We are also not used to cat hair everywhere and cats getting into our belongings.  The location was nice- lots of restaurants and markets near by. 
4660517,40912872,2015-08-03,28774176,Evan,"Good location with a lot of great restaurants, bars, coffee shops nearby. House is small but cozy, and it's tucked far enough off the street that is is pretty quiet at nights. Loft bed is probably not for everyone, but the space up there is really great and the bed is comfortable. 

 "
4660517,54786164,2015-11-23,48722821,Veronica,Rebecca was the absolute perfect air bnb host! This was my first experience and it was seamlessly perfect. Her place is beyond adorable and in a quiet convenient location walking distance to anything we wanted to see. It was our first time to seattle and we couldn't be luckier to find such a perfect place to rest after a day of exploring. 
6902752,38077416,2015-07-12,13307859,Eileen,"Jillian created a home away from home for me in her bnb! The sheets were soft, the pillows perfect and I slept like a baby(this never happens at home). She had a cozy robe and fluffy towels as well. I couldn't have asked for a cuter place to sleep. Her home is surrounded with lush landscaping and a perfect little patio to read and sip your lattes..you are just steps from fabulous coffee shops, divine bakerys, yoga studios, restaurants and the bus line. So convenient!! Look no further if you are going to seattle. This is where you must stay and will never want to leave!"
6902752,44831539,2015-08-29,40111883,Yang,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. Jillian and her husband Jim are very hospitable and their place is beyond description. The neighbourhood is lovely, convenient, quite and safe. You can go to downtown Seattle by the Rapidride C line in 30 min. 

We would definitely stay here again if possible."
6902752,45744085,2015-09-05,33932702,Xi,"It was great experience while I was in Seattle. This house is warm, cozy and lovely to live in. Jim and Jill gave the best first impression of Seattle. They offered me all I asked and even extra help, making me feel at my own home. If I had a chance, I'll be there again, for sure!"
6902752,46183223,2015-09-08,34397332,Dot,Absolutely beautiful home. My friend and I really enjoyed our brief stay there. Bed was very comfortable and even bathrobes were nice. Wish we could hav more time there.
6902752,46752552,2015-09-13,17001237,Josh,"We loved our stay with Jillian and her beautiful home! It was warm, comfortable and restful. We'll certainly be aiming to stay here again soon!"
6902752,48434722,2015-09-26,1856570,Angela,"Jillian was a wonderful host!  She put sincere thought and care into making my stay easy, comfortable and enjoyable.  The space was completely private with my own entrance, and I felt as though I could completely unwind in the evening after spending all day working during my business trip.  Further, the bed was supremely comfortable and Jillian provides all the amenities of staying at a 5-star hotel -- at a wonderfully reasonable rate!  I highly recommend staying with Jillian and look forward to staying here again."
6902752,52853436,2015-11-02,44970701,Sue,"Jillian and Jim were such great hosts during my mom's visit to West Seattle! They were responsive from the reservation onset, provided a private, quaint space, and most importantly made her feel at home during her stay. They provided essential amenities and added special touches like chocolates on the bed! The location of their lovely home is in a super convenient location and very short walking distance to the ""Junction"" which is close to all the shops, cafes, restaurants, etc. Jillian and Jim were such gracious folks as they also helped my mom to the airport. My mom is super grateful! She looks forward to staying here again and hopefully soon! Thank you Jillian and Jim for opening your home!"
6902752,53892270,2015-11-14,28755431,Carlyle,"First, Jillian's home is beautiful and extraordinarily comfortable.  Second, it's in a fabulous location - Alaska Junction is the heart of West Seattle and from her house (on a super quiet street), it's 3 blocks to great restaurants, shopping and public transportation.  Third, Jillian epitomizes thoughtfulness, generosity and warmth.  She anticipates EVERYTHING a visitor might need or want - right down to the dark chocolate almond salted candy bar that made my long flight home quite tolerable.  Jillian provides nurture and welcome while  simultaneously giving her guests absolute privacy.  As long as I need a place to stay when I visit Seattle, Jillian's will be my first choice.      "
6902752,54360446,2015-11-18,47405776,Sean,"Jillian's home is warm and inviting.  After greeting me at the door she showed me the living space and amenities, including a refrigerator stocked with breakfast items and drinks.  The room was comfortable and quiet with a private bath.  Excellent Airbnb seetup."
6902752,57123552,2015-12-22,46503124,Jeanne,"Jillian's home was very comfortable and inviting. My husband and I did not have a car and she lives in a convenient area so we were able to walk everywhere. She and her husband Jim were very hospitable and offered us suggestions for things to do in the area. There were several special touches such as Theo chocolate and thick, soft bathrobes. We also had the use of a Keurig and were left breakfast items in the fridge. We would definitely stay here again while visiting our daughter and son-in-law (who live in the neighborhood). This is a lovely home in a nice neighborhood."
449602,1228092,2012-05-04,2250685,Akira,"Thank you very much Steve.
Steve is so nice and cool!!!
I'm japanese and I cannot speak English very well.
but he try to understand what I want to say.
so kind and friendly.
Room is huge and clean.
This place is very very good location 
visitor usually go to public market. Just 2 blocks from building!!!
and there is monorail station near building to get to space needle.
I really recomend it!!!"
449602,1243163,2012-05-07,1273886,Dzmitry,"The most cool thing about Steve's apartment is its location! Really in the very center of Downtown closing to the Pike market place, monorail going straight to Space Needle and a lot of different bars and restaurants around. 
We enjoyed our first visit to Seattle very much. 
Thanks Steve for your hospitality!"
449602,1324572,2012-05-21,2408081,Frank,"this was a great spot if not for the reason that it is so close to so many things to do and see, then for the fact that steve is a really chill dude especially if ya like comics and other such things, all in all a great time to be had in seattle"
449602,1333298,2012-05-22,714693,Jana & Stephen,"Steve's apartment building was a little hard-to-find spot right in the heart of downtown located near a few bus line transfers, which made for quite the assortment of street folks at that late hour (it was around 11 - midnight when we were arriving) on a Sunday night! Getting from the block where we parked to Steve's apartment entrance was an adventure. :) Parking is what you would expect in a city. Availability will all depend upon the day/hour you go, so be prepared to pay for parking if you're doing so during weekdays.

A sudden change of plans along with our late arrival meant we didn't spend very long there, but Steve's apartment looked clean and cozy and had lots of interesting art pieces.

Our actual time with Steve was short, but he was really personable and interested in where we were from and made us feel welcome. When we inquired, he was able to recommend several good late night coffee places and eateries. While we were out looking for food, Steve made up our bed/sleeping area and made sure things were ready for our late night return.  He was a gracious host allowing us to check in so late, and had it not been for a last minute change in travel plans, we would have stayed longer.

If you like city life and are just looking for a place to lie low, you'll enjoy this location and the hospitality Steve has to offer. ^_^"
449602,1352282,2012-05-26,2155628,Kara,"We really enjoyed staying with Steve.  He was a wonderful host, very accomodating and flexible, and just a really interesting guy to boot!  He was full of good information about where to go and how to get around.  His place is very neat and tidy and in a great central location.  You get an immediate feel for the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle; so many things are within a very easy walking distance.  I definitely recommend.

"
449602,1374852,2012-05-29,2294970,Shan-Yun,"Awesome! I have to say that staying with Steve has a lot of fun ( not just lot of, it is more than lot). He is a humorous, polite and considerate person, and willing to help. Even though I sleep on the living room, the public area, it made me totally comfortable with that. He is 100% respectful my privacy, and asked me when to sleep to avoid disturbing me. We had very nice conversation and hanged out having a drink few times. Even though I just stayed there 5 days, I feel we are real nice friend, who can be really relaxed being and teases with. He recommended several good restaurants to try and that is really useful and helpful. And I guess that is the best way to know Seattle from different angels. I am glad that I choose to stay with Steve rather than any other hotel around. What I get from this travel is more than fun, and also a very precious friendship. I would highly recommend it to others. 
Besides, the location is very good,  outside the building is the bus station, where most buses would pass by. And it is close to Pike market and waterfront. Other spot such us capital hill, space needle, music project, Aquarium are in the walkable distance. 
The place is clean, as what I know that Steve will clean the pillow case, couch and every public area after one guest leaving. And I did enjoy the nice living place there. If I have another time visiting Seattle, I will leave you a line, Steve, absolutely. "
449602,1451337,2012-06-10,1337032,Chelsy & Mitch,"Awesome place to stay, great location, minutes from pike place.  
Steve was really helpful and showed us heaps of stuff to do, and where to eat.  He is an awesome guy, and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and hanging out with him..
    
We would recommend this place to anyone..  Nice one Steve!  You Da Bes..   "
449602,1468961,2012-06-12,2465430,Justine,"Steve's place was great, and Steve himself was just as cool(probably cooler). You couldn't ask for a better location since it's close to pretty much anything you'd want to see in Seattle. We had a fun time talking with Steve, who is a super nice and funny guy. And he gave great food recommendations!"
449602,1482907,2012-06-14,2139973,Esmy,"Steve was so chill! Great guy, knew all the best local spots around the area and very good at giving you your own privacy and the flexibility to build your own schedule as there was no curfew. I would definitely stay with him again! "
449602,1495502,2012-06-16,2634413,Aaron,This is my first bnb experience. And it was so great. Because Steve is a great host to me. He gave me a comfortable place to stay especially I was in a terrible situation while traveling. He is kind and generous. I felt he is my old friend not a stranger. I was surprised that he has a very good knowledgement of Animation/Art and also he is an professional artist too. That is my hobby and my future career goal. He shared well information about the Seattle. And also his apartment is so clean and organized. I strongly recommend people who are going to lodge a place in downtown. Steve is the great choice. I am so glad to befriend with him. He is a cool guy. Thank you Steve 
449602,1511237,2012-06-18,2601039,Harrison,Steve was super nice.  He took us around and showed us some cool spots.  His place is in a great location too.  I would definitely stay there again.  
449602,1519982,2012-06-19,187100,Ted,"Awesome place and host! He was waiting with beers in hand when we got there, was extremely helpful about where to go in the area, and had a movie we wanted to watch queued up when we got home. He was nice and fun; we basically tried to get him to come to everything we did in the city during our short stay. Place is clean and in the dead center of what we wanted to do in the city. Would highly recommend"
449602,1741509,2012-07-18,980715,Julie,"My sister and I (and a three-year-old) were hoping to spend the day in Seattle between an early morning flight to SEA and an afternoon bus ride to Portland. Hauling our luggage through the market and up and down city streets was out of the question, so I headed to Airbnb and found Steve's listing...affordable, central, no vacancies. Hmm...

I reached out to Steve with our novel request. He was open to the idea of hosting our luggage while we explored the city, and we worked out the details over the course of a few days. 

Things couldn't have gone more smoothly! His place was literally paces from a transit station, an easy 2 block walk to the Public Market, and he was more than accommodating in making sure we had what we needed. He wasn't there, but we had no difficulties accessing his space. 

The only thing that could have made the stay better would have been an opportunity to thank our host in person! Steve rocked. We'll track him down the next time we head to Seattle. Thanks so much!"
449602,1813798,2012-07-27,467866,E,"This MOST AMAZING  host ever.  He made my trip! No joke.  He showed me around, his place was outstanding, super clean and very comfortable. There isn't an adjective to adequately describe how outstanding my experience was staying with Steve.  His apartment is only 2 blocks from the most popular place to go in Seattle!  Within walking distance I was able to enjoy fresh seafood everyday, great happy hours, a comedy club, the water, shopping. I just feel so lucky to have found him and his home. Definitely will stay there again when I'm back in Seattle."
449602,1825352,2012-07-28,2392308,Molly,"When my boyfriend and I arrived earlier than expected into Seattle and in a pinch, Steve was there for us.  Everything we asked/requested was answered with a ""yes!""  As first time visitors to Seattle with less than 24 hours to spend in the city, the central location was clutch.  As first time renters in a 'shared' unit, Steve's sensitivity to privacy and flexibility with our comings/goings was a blessing."
449602,1833683,2012-07-29,2930273,Melinda,"I needed a place to crash for the evening and this was perfect. Steve was kind, humble and pretty cool. I crashed and was out by 8am. Steve is a great host and a perfect gentleman. I will stay again if need be and recommend to anyone needing a place to crash out. SUPER clean...which for a single young man was impressive. Rocommend for sure.
"
449602,1873811,2012-08-02,544617,Chris,"Steve made my week, he was able to host me with last minute reservations and his location is amazing. If you ever want to get the full Seattle experience I highly recommend Steve. Thanks for a fun weekend Steve im sure I will see you again soon!"
449602,1906347,2012-08-06,733865,Lisa,"In the interest of full disclosure, I didn't actually spend the night at Steve's, but I was able to hang out at his place for a couple of hours and rejuvenate after a long day.  I had the pleasure of meeting Steve before I headed out for the evening with friends and he was very accommodating and friendly.  And I really enjoyed checking out his action figure collection!"
449602,1978316,2012-08-13,1107508,Sarah,"The beautiful apartment of Steve is in the absolutely center of the city, you can not live better! He showed me a French restaurant and gave me tips on the city as a good friend, I feel as if I known him for a long time after a few moments. You feel very safe and secure with him and his flat and: His comic book collection is great!
Well, who is looking for the perfect accommodation in Seattle: Steve is the best! :)

I wish I had stayed longer in fantastic Seattle.
Thank you for all Steve – and see you in Berlin!!!"
449602,2118725,2012-08-27,3333304,Tara,"Steve welcomed Irene and I into his home. He gave us tips on where to park and eat. He is friendly and approachable, making him a great host. Too bad we were only in Seattle for the night. If we visit again, we'd definitely stay with Steve."
449602,2243312,2012-09-09,3427562,Ruby,"Travelling unaccompanied as a female is not always the easiest but I have to say that Steve made me feel at ease. He was such a gentleman and very courteous.  I was in town for only 1 night and it was to catch up with an old friend and Steve was nice enough to let me come back in the wee hours of the morning without a complaint. He is also located in such a fantastic spot! If you are considering staying with him - DO! It is money well spent :D Thank you SO much Steve.
"
449602,2253031,2012-09-10,1308477,Marvin,"Place:
Heart of downtown, accessible to virtually everything by a short transit ride at most, and equipped with a badass collection of comics.  Was super cool, would definitely stay again.

Host:
Honestly I've used airbnb a bunch of times before and I've only actually met one other host (it was just to get keys to the place before he was off to go camping).  Steve was really accommodating and easy to talk to and he brought us to a great dim sum place for dinner!  Amazing!!  If any of the other places he mentioned are as good as this one was I'll likely have to go back to Seattle more than once.

Cheers man!"
449602,2326473,2012-09-17,395659,Soo,Steve was wonderful! What a great guy and the location could not have been any better :) Steve is full of awesome restaurant ideas and suggestions too ! We really enjoyed our stay and the chit chats. Will be coming back for sure and would highly recommend this place to anyone i know. 
449602,2386823,2012-09-23,910442,Mallory,"Steve was great at having us feel at home and well taken care of. He shared some cool spots in the neighborhood for us to check out and showed us awesome videos of people sledding down snowy streets of Seattle. Really cool! Steve was really accommodating and laid back. If we're ever in the Seattle area, we'd love to stay again!"
449602,2399573,2012-09-24,3023513,Levi,"Steve is great! Super welcoming and cool, comfortable bed, plus unbeatable location! You cannot find better place to stay. I'll def stay at your place again next time I'm there. Thanks a lot Steve!"
449602,2477599,2012-10-01,1643343,Katya,"Steve was awesome. He gave us all the privacy we needed, and actually we only saw him once in our 2-day stay, but the encounter was very pleasant. He also has an awesome selection of drinks in the fridge, which we took full advantage of. Thanks Steve!
"
449602,2626551,2012-10-15,3842138,Chantal,"Steve was great! He was so easygoing, and made us feel right at home! It was easy to spark up conversation and he was genuinely a good guy. His place was in a wicked location, and it was easy to get around everywhere! We would definitely recommend Steve as a host for your next stay in Seattle!"
449602,3075502,2012-12-11,4351695,Natalia,"I needed a place to stay in downtown Seattle last minute for that very same day. Steve not only accepted my request within the hour, but he was very communicative, sending me a message right away to work out the logistics of meeting up. I ended up not meeting Steve, but he was so nice and gracious, I would recommend him without hesitation.

Also, his place is super conveniently located to the heart of downtown, a ton of places to eat, the Pike Market, and the light rail! "
449602,3520201,2013-02-11,1693053,Theresa,"Had a great stay at Steve's place on a short weekend trip to Seattle.  The extremely convenient location allowed me to trek to all the places I wanted to go - and Steve was helpful with tips and recommendations where I needed.  The apartment is extremely clean with fresh bedding and towels.  As a lone female traveler, I felt very comfortable and Steve was very respectful and helpful."
449602,3588708,2013-02-19,5029476,Kate,"Steve is so fun! He was a gracious host and was very helpful in telling us about Seattle. I felt really comfortable sharing his space and hope to be back again!

My traveling companion described Steve as the kind of dude you'd trek to Mordor with. Not necessarily in a Sam/Frodo/Gollum kind of way, just in the sense that he'd be a good guy to talk to along the way. Whether offering us homemade banana bread, filling us in on the latest video game industry gossip, or talking about Frank Miller's Batman, hanging out with Steve inside his apartment was just as interesting as exploring the city beyond. "
449602,3874683,2013-03-23,5519735,Robbie,"Clean, meticulously neat, kind, funny, these are the things that made Steve a great host! Wish we could have went out for a beer with him and gotten to know him better, it's unfortunate we only got to spend one night there. Looking forward to staying there on our next trip to Seattle. See you soon, Steve!"
449602,3897691,2013-03-25,329195,Robert,"Such a great experience for a first timer in Seattle! We couldn't ask for a better location and a better host! Steve was friendly and wonderfully accommodating with directions/suggestions/advice about questions we had for our short trip. The futon was comfy and the gatorade in the fridge helped me in the morning... kudos for that.
What else can I say that hasn't already been said in previous comments? It's all true; Steve is that genuinely good guy, easygoing, and incredibly helpful for travelers to Seattle - and the downtown location is terrific for transit. Definitely recommended!
"
449602,3909873,2013-03-26,4025892,Stephen,"Steve was really nice, and it was great to meet him. 
His apartment was in the perfect location for exploring Seattle, dead central and a great price. 
We only stayed a night but wish we could have stayed longer to see more of Seattle its a great place with so much to do. 
The area around the apartment seems a little sketchy, and there are quite a few homeless people on the street to the apartment, but apart from being asked for change nothing worse will happen and it seems like a safe area. 
Overall great experience. "
449602,3981918,2013-04-01,5091048,Rebecca,It was awesome! Close to lots of places and all together an enjoyable stay.
449602,4065490,2013-04-07,5394776,Duc,"This was my first AirBnB experience, so I was not sure what to expect. Lucky for me, I had a very pleasant stay :) I was traveling alone, but Steve was accommodating and became my companion for any adventures I suggested.  His place is literally located seconds away from any public transit you might need to take. He is chock full of knowledge and is definitely awesome with directions! The next time I am in Seattle, I would love to stay at Steve’s place. "
449602,4268246,2013-04-23,3691314,Ibrahim,It was an amazing stay in Seattle. The place was in middle of everything in downtown. Steve was so welcoming person and respective host. I would definitely like to recommend this place to stay when you are in Seattle. 
449602,4319863,2013-04-27,654365,Rochelle,"We had such a great time staying at Steve's place, he was so friendly and welcoming....even bought us new pillows!! 
His apartment is very spacious, clean and is in the perfect location, right in the middle of all major shopping and great restaurants and so close to pike place market. 
He was really informative, told us where we should go for dinner and how to get everywhere we wanted to go.
I would definitely be staying with Steve next time I'm in Seattle! Thank you Steve "
449602,4355086,2013-04-29,3324488,Nicole,"Steve was amazing! I booked for 5 friends, but at the last minute 2 pulled out. And even though I didn't mind paying the extra, Steve didn't feel good about keeping the money and gave me a refund. So sweet!

His apartment is SO clean and neat and spacious! When we arrived Steve met us outside to welcome us in. When had a couple of beers with him and a friend who was visiting, and played a sweet card game named ""Cards Against Humanity"". Then my two friends and I went out. Steve was totally fine with us coming home late (we promised to be quiet). When we returned home the two queen sized beds where all made up and ready, with really nice sheets and pillows.

The location is perfect! So close to everything. Seattle is ridiculously walkable! You don't need a car. Seriously! And don't be fooled by the MacDonalds downstairs with less desirable people hanging around, occasionally asking for a dollar. You get that in every city. Seattle is safe, and once you're in the building and in Steve's apartment, there is little street noise, and Steve's apartment is clean and well furnished!

I would definitely stay again... Might be back for Bumbershoot 2013 :)"
449602,4484238,2013-05-07,6130819,Nid,"Steve was awesome.He was really friendly,cool and so kind.He talked a lot of things with me though I cant speak English well.He taught me how to play Xbox and suggested many place to go.His apartment was very clean and convenient for travelling. You can travel anywhere on foot/by foot. If I have a chance to go to Seattle again I will stay at his apartment for sure."
449602,4521102,2013-05-10,5338819,Kizia,"Steve was a great host, very knowledgable about things to do and see in Seattle. We had some great food! Apartment was extremely clean and comfortable. Great location right in the middle of downtown. Walking distance to Pike Market and Capitol Hill. Public transport was literally out the front door. Overall a great few days in Seattle, thanks Steve! "
449602,4588703,2013-05-13,6289244,Agata,"Steve was a great host and very knowledgeable about the area which is perfect for people visiting Seattle for the first time. If you are looking DT, then the location can't be beat! It's clean, comfortable and spacious. Thanks Steve!"
449602,4608040,2013-05-14,6202443,Leslie,"Steve was amazing. We booked this room last minute and it was everything we could hope for. Very friendly and personable, he shared his food with us and gave suggestions for the next day. Loved it!"
449602,4636653,2013-05-17,4213534,Danbi,"Steve and his place made my journey even better! The place was as spacious and clean as it seems in the photos. The futon was actually very comfy and huge. Most of all, the location was amazing that all the places i wanted to get to in the city were in walking distance. Neighborhood was also safe. I had no problem walking around on the street late night even though there were some homeless as the same in the other big cities. Steve was just as great as his place. He was a very fun, comfortable, and kind guy to get along with. Also super helpful like he basically tries all he can do to get you the information you need. It felt like i was having a nightover at my friend's place :)  I totally recommend Steve and his apartment if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle and would love to visit him again."
449602,4715118,2013-05-21,3667337,Thu-Phuc,"Steve and his place were great! Steve is so easy going and extremely helpful, even downloading the last episode of New Girl for me because I had missed it while travelling - Thanks, Steve! The apartment is very clean, especially the bathroom. The futon/couch is comfortable and a godsend after a day of Seattle exploring. Location also can't be beat for those wanting shopping and proximity to Pike Place Market. Would definitely recommend to friends."
449602,4753791,2013-05-23,3348766,Rob,"Steve is a great guy - friendly, accommodating and generous.  Would highly recommend getting in touch with this guy if you need a place in Seattle.  Cheers Steve!"

449602,4864939,2013-05-29,5493584,Qing,"Steve was awesome and very thoughtful! Always thought of others more than himself. He had many comic books and they were very interesting! He also let my friends and I play his Xbox till 2a.m.! The location was very good too. Btw, Steve....I still miss toro(..... I don't think I can spell it right....)!  But he is the cutest dog I've ever met!"
449602,4879799,2013-05-30,6356884,Christine,"Steve's place in downtown Seattle was extremely convenient. He was very easy to get a hold of, had some great recommendations for Seattle nightlife, and a wonderful host. We only stayed one night and it was simple and effortless."
449602,4914730,2013-06-01,4150597,Brian,Thank you so much Steve!  We had a great time in Seattle and a great first experience with Airbnb
449602,4928037,2013-06-02,6514494,Jasmin,"Steve was a great host! He knows every nook in his city, and has great foodie recommendations :) His apartment is in the heart of downtown, which made it perfect to walk to Pike Place Market, Seattle Art Museum, Target City, etc. The Space Needle may look far on the map, but it is definitely within walking distance! 
His living room and bathroom are very spacious, and it was great being able to use the kitchen as well. He makes it easy to get comfortable after a long day's travelling. 
Most definitely recommend for urban adventurers! Quiet country folk may need to look a bit outside Seattle, as this is definitely a hustle and bustle locale. We parked in a parking garage overnight, and were lucky enough to get weekend pricing at $9/day. That was pretty much the cheapest parking! 
Anyway, good luck on your travels and SWS! (Stay With Steve!)"
449602,5054147,2013-06-10,603038,Laura,We had a great stay at Steve's. He was super kind & we slept like roses. The appartment is really really downtown and it's really easy to get around Seattle.

449602,5152425,2013-06-15,6263123,Maxie,"Steve is a super sweet guy, He made my stay in Seattle very pleasant. Very flexible (checked in early/checked out late) and just tries to make it easy for you. He even tried to help me out when I needed an additional day and place to stay (he was booked already...sigh). 
Ask him places to eat out!!! Recommended amazing places...delicious! 
It was the very first time for me trying airbnb and Steve made a for sure a great experience! I would stay at his place at any time again!
Thanks again, Steve, for the great time I had.
"
449602,5256524,2013-06-21,5479393,Colleen,"Steve is awesome!! He is the best host I've had so far! He took the time to show us around and get lunch and dinner with us while we were in town. He only recommends the BEST food places! He is very open and kind hearted, a very nice person. The location is unbeatable, right in downtown and blocks away from all tourist attractions as well as major bus/transit stops. Location was convenient and safe. Steve's place is clean and not cluttered, we had plenty of space for 3 people in the living room! Because of Steve, our stay in Seattle was homey, lovely, and full of good memories. THANKS STEVE! "

For example, we needed an iron and he went out and bought one! Cooked for us and generally included us in everything. He comes with our highest recommendation. "

His apartment was spotless (until we messed it up) and he knows a ton about Seattle to suit many types of travellers. He had a very large and comfortable air mattress and a futon to sleep on, complete with wonderfully fresh sheets and blankets that made us feel right at home. Highly recommended!"
449602,5998375,2013-07-25,7680848,Katrina,"Steve was a great host. He gave us some awesome restaurant and bar recommendations. It was a little noisy at night (especially if you aren't used to city noise - he lives on a busy street), but if you have a sleep noise app on your phone or something that will help. He let us keep our bags there the next day as well while we roamed around. Easy place to find, super clean, nice towels."

Like everyone else has probably said, if you need to figure out what there is to do in the area, just ask Steve.

The location was really central, and everything in downtown was a walkable distance. The living room and washroom were really tidy. When I was falling asleep, Steve was incredibly nice and slept around the same time as us. Wish we could have gone to all of the suggested places, but we'll keep them in mind for our next trip! "

I received a handful amount of advices form him about places to travel around, lifestyle in Seattle, apartments, etc. The place is just a few blocks away from almost anything you want, which is a big convenience. I really enjoyed my 1-day stay there as well as chitchatting conversations with Steve. I'd definitely checkout this place again next time visiting Seattle."
449602,10017443,2014-01-25,11579716,Jaime,"I stayed with Steve for just a night with three others. Our stay was super last minute and he was more than willing to wait for our midnight flight arrival and make sure we were comfortable. Steve was so cool and sweet our night was made so much better by his company! Cards against Humanity is a good one to make quick friends ;) ! His place is in a great location and he was very helpful, even got us a bunch of free/discounted transportation methods just because he's nice. Humble Mr. Boyce has a very interesting life and we all wished we stayed longer to get to know him better! 10 out of 10! "

449602,10241158,2014-02-08,10963675,William,"Steve was an awesome host - so easy with communication, and super friendly. Apartment was in a perfect location - close to Pike St Markets. Only stayed for a night, but Steve gave us fantastic dinner recommendations and made our short stay in Seattle very easy. Would definitely return!"
449602,11341088,2014-03-30,13614064,Lev,"This was mine and my 3 friends first time using airbnb and I don't think we could've had a better experience. We weren't planning to hang out with Steve while in Seattle, but after meeting him and hanging out for a bit, we were all happy he agreed to come out with us. We had a great time for a great price in a great location with a great host. 

10/10, Would do it again."
449602,13394619,2014-05-26,15859310,Michael,"Made a last minute booking for myself and a few friends who were heading down to Seattle for a weekend bike polo tournament and Steve was a great host. The apartment was clean. comfortable and had plenty of room for the 4 of us (or 5 including Steve). Centrally located, walking or riding distance to everywhere we needed to go. Steve joined us out in the evenings for some drinks and food and gladly shared his music, games and impressive comic collection with us. Would definitely stay here again in the future. Thanks Steve."
449602,13643062,2014-06-01,7705633,Jas,"Steve was a wonderful host! Super accommodating, I felt so bad for making him come back earlier than expected time frame just for us to get ready. The place is real neat and tidy.
3 girls fit perfectly on the bed and futon, they were comfy! 
Steve is awesome and a super nice guy would definitely come back again if ever in Seattle. 
but keep in mind, there is no parking around so you should prepare yourself to park in an overnight garage. Can be a bit loud cause it's in downtown area other than that it's great! 
Thank you again!

449602,14330910,2014-06-16,16688559,Katrin Juliana,Steve is an awesome host and we had a great time at his place. It's located in Downtown so you get everything you need in a few seconds. Steve was very friendly and more than helpful. His appartement is cool and very clean. I would always recommend it. 
449602,14578534,2014-06-22,3251339,Betty,"I came to Steve's place with three other friends and we had a great time here! He was absolutely wonderful, suggestive on where we should go to eat. We only stayed for one night but it was a great experience. His place is perfectly located downtown, close to whatever you wanted to do. If you're a geek or a comic book nerd, definitely stay here. If you're not, stay for the location. You can't go wrong with this place."
449602,14752587,2014-06-25,1435015,Mai,"Steve is the absolute best! The place is super awesome in the heart of downtown near pike place, very convenient. Also close to everything else we had on our agenda. His book collection is incredible and it was fun to get to chat about it. He introduced us to new foods and had a lot of great recommendations for us. Definitely welcome to stay with us if he's ever in Miami :) Thanks for everything Steve! "
449602,14926788,2014-06-29,3131404,Michelle,"Steve was incredibly welcoming and accommodating! The apartment was really really clean and spacious. An excellent location, minutes from pike place market. Thanks for being a great host Steve!! It was all around a great experience.

449602,15597327,2014-07-12,11788224,Bec,"Our stay with Steve was great! Super amazing location for exploring the Seattle sights. Clean, comfy beds and looks just like photos. Steve was also awesome to get to know and was very accommodating of 4 of us... and quite a lot of stuff. Would definitely recommend!"
449602,16205808,2014-07-23,15668303,Chris,"10/10
You will be hard pressed to find a more genuine and respectful host within the city. Flawless reviews aside, if I did not live on the other side of the world (London), I would have spent a significantly longer time there.

If you need space, Steve will give it to you, but what a waste that would be! Steve himself is an awesome person, and we had a lot more fun during our stay in Seattle as we spent more time together. He has a vast collection of comics and video games, and an even bigger pool of knowledge pertaining to them. If you enjoy either of these, you will have a friend waiting in Seattle for you to spend hours talking to.

Furthermore, the accommodation Steve is offering is worth far more than he charges. The three of us slept in great comfort, and were a short walk from anywhere we ever needed to be, both the location and the property is prime.

Steve is a great guy, I had expected to leave Seattle with souvenirs and photos, not a long-term friend. When I return to Seattle this will be the only place I consider staying, provided no one messes with his trine 2 save file.
"
449602,16387406,2014-07-26,7494355,Jacopo,Very cool place in central Seattle! Steve was very nice and gave us  a lot of good advices  about the city..
449602,16747647,2014-08-01,5963683,Samantha,Steve was a great host! The air mattresses and futons fit all 5 of us no problem. We had everything we needed! I would definitely recommend it!

"
449602,17419057,2014-08-11,19631760,Jordan,"Steve was a complete gentleman and genuine, rare qualities i  which you can find confort if you choose to stay. He numerously helped us with directions, tips on where to go, where we could stay after we left his, he even took us to one of his favourite bars which he didn't have to do at all. All in all, he made us feel at home not only in his apartment, but in Seattle as well.

In terms of the apartment itself, you get what it says on the tin. You will be in a central location (about as central as it gets), nearby many attractiona such as Pike market and fantastic waterfront views among others. His apartment is open and clean, something other places might take for granted. Steve and his place should be a confident choice for your travels."
449602,17579756,2014-08-14,14143795,Lorena,"Steve was amazing. Upon our arrival, he made us feel welcome and shared great spots around downtown to check out. Super friendly, made us feel at home. The place itself is very clean and tidy, pretty spacious. I would LOVE to stay at Steve's place next time I'm in Seattle! "
449602,17898744,2014-08-18,15328812,Cassandra,"This was our first Air BnB experience and a great one at that. We were right downtown a short walk to pike place or other shopping centres. We not only had wonderful smelling pillows and a great bathroom (I don't know why, but I loved your bathroom Steve!) we also made a friend. So very accommodating. When I wanted to know if there was parking around, Steve sent me a list of garages I could park in and how the parking worked in Seattle! So kind, thanks again Steve!"
449602,22286394,2014-11-02,6834967,Harry,"Steve is kind and helpful when I was deciding the last minute arrival. He left a quiet space for me when I was arriving. No worry for staying in a futon, it's comfortable and give you a full energy for tomorrow. Everything is neat, clean, especially for the restroom. The location is easy to find by taking light rail. "
449602,22560069,2014-11-09,23197307,Alan,Staying with Steve in Seattle was great!  His apartment was clean and slept six easily. Steve always offered advice on where to go and helped us find the places we wanted to visit. The apartment was only two blocks away from pike market place and really close to capital hill which is filled with great bars. I would highly recommend staying at Steve's place it was great!
449602,26038754,2015-02-01,26954255,Caitlin,"Steve was very kind and more than accommodating. His apartment is perfectly located near Pike's Place and so any restaurant, bar, or activity you could want is nearby. The futon was very comfortable and he even gave me some Neil Gaiman!!!"
449602,27609034,2015-03-08,28233396,Marty,"Steve was absolutely wonderful during our visit. He was one of the coolest and most accommodating people I've ever met. We couldn't have asked for a better experience in downtown Seattle. We ended up checking in a lot later than we planned, and he was great at communicating and working with us to make everything super easy. I'd happily rebook with Steve any time I'm ever in Seattle again."
449602,28216470,2015-03-20,8287257,Olivia,"Steve is really a nice person, he made tea for us :3 his apartment is tidy and clean. Though we slept in the living room and shared the bathroom with him, we never felt uncomfortable or inconvenient. He is very accommodating and helpful. He recommended a lot of places to eat and visit. We played Xbox at his home and it was fun! The location of his apartment is great. The bus stop, light rail station and post office are  close to his home. You can also walk to many places besides pike market such as space needle and pioneer square."
449602,28726607,2015-03-29,1691785,Meghan,"I visited Seattle with two female friends for the weekend, and we had an amazing time!!! Steve was very accommodating and generous, and overall a fantastic and experienced host. The apartment is in a really nice, central location so we could easily get to all our destinations, and there's lots of amenities close by. Steve did a really a great job with the listing description, so we knew the place would be a great fit for us. We felt really comfortable staying there and would absolutely return. Thank you so much Steve :) :) :) *This* is why I love Airbnb!!"
449602,30818135,2015-04-27,26715624,Priscilla,"It was my first time using airbnb and I'm so glad that Steve was our first host. I traveled with my roommate and we were both anxious about what to expect but everything worked out perfectly. Steve was an amazingly friendly, kind, and respectful host. His place was extremely clean and organized and always felt nice and cozy. At first we were hesitant about staying in a conplete stranger's living room, but it wasn't weird at all. We shared the futon and it was big enough for us two girls to sleep comfortably. Steve made us felt so welcomed and comfortable throughout our stay. 

On top of that, there were so many other perks as well. The place is literally 2 blocks away from Pike Market and just blocks away from everything else. It was the most convenient location we could've asked for. Everything was walking distance of 20 minutes or less. We only took the bus once the entire weekend and it was only to go to Kerry Park. Steve even provided us with a bus pass for the weekend! 

It was definitely a very enjoyable experience and if we were to visit Seattle again, there's no doubt in my mind that we'd stay here again. "
449602,33204064,2015-05-25,11458708,Amy,"Steve is a fantastic host, super generous and thoughtful! Easy to coordinate with--very kindly took me and my friend in as a pretty last minute request. He gave great recommendations. Also, his place is in a fantastic location--easy to get to everywhere, can even walk to many many main attractions, and right by the train to get to the airport. The futon/bed was comfortable. He keeps the place immaculately clean. Thanks so much again, Steve! "
449602,38039404,2015-07-12,36909954,Stella,"Steve was very a very friendly and accommodating host - he recommended great attractions and restaurants. His apartment had a large living room which fit the 5 of us comfortably and it was well stocked with entertainment (xbox, netflix, cards against humanity, etc).  The location was in downtown so everything was well within walking distance, we were able to walk down to pike market in 5 minutes.  We're glad our first airbnb experience was with Steve. "
449602,38970853,2015-07-19,37445118,Kacey,"Awesome experience. Made a new friend. Super friendly and great at being a host. Loved the apartment, super clean and cool. Definitely recommend. "

449602,40862490,2015-08-02,39865751,Leela,"Steve was an awesome guy. He hung out with us, shared his snacks, and gave us suggestions on what to do, and where to go. We had 6 of us staying, and he had accommodations for all of us for an awesome price. He also kept his apartment very clean and tidy. Overall it was a great experience. "
449602,41440423,2015-08-07,19539784,Travis,Steve's place was in a prime location. Steve was very accommodating and helpful.
449602,42141778,2015-08-11,35612877,Jenny,"This is my first experience with airb & it was amazing! Steve greeted us (party of 3) upon arrival and was super hospitable, I'm glad to have used this service because it was such a great time staying with Steve! Our reason for travel was to attend a The International (Dota2 tournament) at the Key arena in seattle, however we opted to stay a couple more days in Seattle and got to hang out with our host as well! 

The room is very clean and spacious with a fully equipped kitchen and bathroom. The location is KEY! It was great being able to stay in the heart of downtown where everything is pretty much walkable! It is very close to many restaurants and shops, including pike place and our favorite restaurant Shiro's sushi! 

Steve is very knowledgeable about the surrounding area and had lots of great ideas of places to go and things to see in Seattle! He's so fun to be with and we wish we could live with him forever :') 

Needless to say, it was a great first experience for me with airb and I hope the next hosts can measure up! "
449602,46248469,2015-09-08,30482203,Amanda,Steve's place was absolutely fantastic! It was in the perfect location and was especially clean. Steve was great about advice on restaurants and cool places to check out. He also checked in with us to see if we needed anything at all! GREAT host and GREAT place. We will definitely stay here again if we venture back to Seattle!!

He give us clean bedroom in living room.Bath room is perfect clean,I think better than Hotel.
If I have a chance to go Seattle again,I wanna stay here!
thanks :)"

449602,51581897,2015-10-21,46170947,Meadow,"Great location!  Very large open space, easily fit us five without feeling cramped! Both were very nice as well."

스티브는 너무 친절했습니다.
가격도 저렴합니다.
다시 시애틀에 간다면 또 이용하겠습니다."
449602,54039031,2015-11-15,5558254,Mathieu,"Great place to stay, perfect to hang-out in all the place to see in Seattle. Leah and Steve makes you feel home and if the weather drag you back to the apartment you will have plenty of things to have fun and still enjoy your Seattle experience (Games, video games, comics...).
Highly recommend the place and will definitely stay here again next time."
449602,57723581,2015-12-28,34157549,Maggie,"The location is awesome!! No need to rent a car. Everything can be done by foot. 
Steve is kind and humor! And the room is great, each application is very good - the big TV with movies is so cool!  "
4546924,26003764,2015-02-01,25410356,Shawn,Felt very at home here with our puppy. Great fenced in yard. Great neighborhood for walking.  Even got in an evening campfire with Marlo and Dylan's friends.
4546924,27257394,2015-03-01,25410356,Shawn,"What a great host and home. We stayed here for about 7 weeks and had such a wonderful experience. Home is beautiful,  close to Capitol Hill, parks and a beautiful neighborhood. Perfect if you want to experience the non-tourist side of Seattle."
4546924,28009831,2015-03-16,27374254,Mellissia,"My husband and I spent ten days here and couldn't have asked for a warmer welcome. Even their dogs made us feel welcome!  The apartment is just as shown in the photos and the amenities/essentials went beyond what we would expect (i.e. bathroom toiletries). Calling this charming home and apartment an ""Eco-Retreat"" is perfect because of the many features that make this the ""greenest"" home in the neighborhood. We left with a greater appreciation for ""living green"" and with ideas that are doable in our own home. I wouldn't be at all surprised to see this place featured in Sunset magazine or other such publications.  I hope we can stay here on future visits to Seattle. It feels a bit like a little home away from home."
4546924,28418677,2015-03-23,6843174,Leslie,"Marlo and Dylan's eco retreat was everything the listing said and more. They thought of everything for this space and make sure you have all the things you need to feel at home, even dog treats. The apartment is located in a very nice area walking distance to many of Capitol Hill's restaurants. This will definitely be our go to in Seattle!"
4546924,28739504,2015-03-29,29004615,Jan,"As group of first timers using AirBnB, we couldn't have asked for a better experience. The place is very clean and modern with all the usual amenities and more. Fantastic bathroom, very comfortable beds, and the most accommodating hosts you could hope for! We had a fantastic time riding around Seattle on the bikes Marlo & Dylan provided, they also had some stellar food recommendations for the local area and even put fairy lights above the fire pit and provided everything we needed for a s'mores feast! Above and beyond barely begins to describe them. Thanks for enhancing our Seattle experience!"
4546924,29144677,2015-04-04,18975655,Stephanie,"Marlo and Dylan were wonderful hosts.  Their place was not only chic and modern, but comfortable and spotless.  I traveled with my husband and toddler and the place was great for my little one as well.  They thought of all the details, from soaps to laundry detergent, it was like a home away from home.  The location is very central, we drove which was easy for street parking, and was able to get anywhere in the city in a short amount of time.  I would highly recommend their place, and we'll be back for sure!"
4546924,32503759,2015-05-19,10917179,Lawrence,"Staying for 7 weeks at Marlo's and Dylan's place has been absolutely wonderful! One of the main reasons for me to find a place on AirBnB is to escape the corporate environment so often offered. Here is a place that is lovingly appointed and is a reflection of the warmth and friendliness that characterizes the hosts. It is rather small but it works surprisingly well for two people. The location is excellent and I was able to go to almost any place in Seattle within 10-15 minutes by car.  Lots of little details, including a fully stocked bathroom cupboard made me feel at home. Highly recommended!"
4546924,34101776,2015-06-04,26809430,Lili,"Lovely place but smaller than I expected. We have 4 people and felt a little crowded but two people would  stayed comfortable. One thing that we feel uncomfortable is the dog upstairs. Bonnie lives upstairs with Marlo but during the night we stayed, she was running and barking all night and woke me up a few times. The other night was much better though. Overall speaking the house is worth the price with the location and the quality. Marlo was also glad to help when we met problems."
4546924,34446242,2015-06-08,4782975,Qiva,"Marlo and her husband Dylan were excellent hosts.  Their place was super nice and all newly remodeled.  It had brand new appliances in the kitchen and even included a washer and dryer.  It was also very clean and environmentally friendly.  They supplied us with everything that we would ever need from toothpaste and soap to nail files and kitchenware. 

Marlo and Dylan were really friendly and helpful.  When my husband and I told them we enjoyed hiking, they went out of their way to get us a hiking book to use.  They have two very adorable dogs that just want to be part of the mix and get lots of love.      

The neighborhood where the house is located is super cute.  It was on a tree lined street with lots of remodeled craftsman homes around.  The street was very bike and pedestrian friendly.  It was close enough to walk to great spots, such as downtown and Volunteer Park.  We would definitely stay with Marlo and Dylan again if we are ever in Seattle.       "
4546924,34753665,2015-06-11,1751504,Xander,The place and location was perfect. Was better than I expected.

The neighborhood is extremely quiet and conveniently located near restaurants, stores, and even a short walk to downtown. We highly recommend staying here during your next trip to Seattle!"
4546924,35075209,2015-06-15,14400600,Cynthia,"We loved the place- it is so tastefully and ecologically done- lovely backyard and the neighborhood is wonderful. I believe that our hosts were away for the weekend, so all was quiet. Thanks so much!"
4546924,35420018,2015-06-18,4440899,Nicholas,"The apartment is incredible! I loved the neighborhood, and everything about the apartment is very well thought out and cared for, including the additional spaces the property. It is evident that Marlo put a lot of time and care into making the space unique and very comfortable. Access to the yard, bicycles, and other amenities was a huge plus. Another great addition is that any bathroom or personal items you may need for your stay are provided. Would absolutely stay again!"
4546924,36140699,2015-06-25,34455514,Chris,"Thank you Marlo and Dylan! We had a wonderful time and felt welcomed as soon as we arrived. The home is beautiful and it was a great experience. Marlo and Dylan gave us some recommendations for things to do while we were in the City. The location is perfect, as we were close to many different parts of the City. Thoroughly enjoyed our stay and will come back again!!"
4546924,36284178,2015-06-27,8015413,Cynthia,Host was very congenial. Unit was clean and attractive. Very dog-friendly. Perfect for our stay.
4546924,36732667,2015-06-30,36392621,Margie,"Marlo and Dylan have created a wonderful oasis in a cool neighbourhood of Seattle. They have put such incredible care into the details of their Eco-retreat, they even have a binder where you can read about all the environmentally friendly aspects of the suite. They are a lovely and welcoming couple who made us feel right at home. We even had use of the back yard, comfy lawn furniture and  herb garden. 
The location is in a quiet residential neighbourhood,   but it  is still  very accessible by bus or an inexpensive cab ride to downtown Seattle. We walked about 15 minutes to a great street with lots of restaurants and amenities.  Marlo and Dylan have a handy list of their favourite restaurants as well as tour brochures to plan the trip. 
The accommodations were impeccably clean and well appointed with a full kitchen, and a washer/dryer. There is even a cupboard of toiletries in case you have forgotten anything - so thoughtful!
We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this accommodation to anyone travelling to Seattle who does not want to stay in the typical big downtown hotel."
4546924,37188742,2015-07-05,34958031,Jeffrey,"Everything was perfect.  Check in was easy.   The house had everything we needed.  Location was great.  In short, we felt relaxed and at home staying here.  "
4546924,38606304,2015-07-17,33305211,Brian,"The listing was as described, very quiet and private, and close to Capitol Hill.  Marlo was very nice and accommodating.
"

4546924,40264883,2015-07-29,38294194,Jong Sik,"We stayed in Marlos house very comfortably.Even we stayed with 4 people it was nice and not any problem. 
Our family enjoyed wonderful dogs also."
4546924,40501909,2015-07-31,17273952,Adam,"Marlo was such a sweetheart! We felt very welcome in her basement apartment, and stole some decorating tips while we were there. She clearly has talent for making the most of every inch of space, and being eco-conscious while doing it. The bed and seating were very comfortable, the kitchen was perfect for some light cooking with the ingredients we bought at the local market, and the bathroom was immaculate. Although we didn't end up using them due to our short stay and tight schedule, we love that bikes were available for guest use, not to mention the gorgeous backyard area. ALSO: Marlo has the very best Guest Manual I have ever seen at an airbnb location, hands down. I highly recommend this spot, and have nothing but fond memories for our brief stay there."
4546924,41731221,2015-08-09,30130581,Allen,"Marlo's apartment was the first ever airbnb I stayed in and it has convinced me to never book another hotel in the United States again. Her apartment had everything a hotel room does plus much much more. Things I didn't even think to bring but ended up needing, like cold medication and earplugs for the blue angels show. 
Marlo was a very gracious host and provided us with everything we needed during our stay. Airbnb messages were responded to quickly and her cell number was always available as well.
A couple things about the place that I really liked, were the firepit and tv/internet. Marlo provides guests with graham crackers, marshmellows and chocolate along with firewood in order to make s'mores which I thought was pretty cool. The tv comes with Netflix and Amazon Prime instant video and the internet has a strong connection throughout the apartment.
Beds were comfortable with great down comforters and plenty of pillows.
Overall, I rate my experience at Marlo's 5 stars."
4546924,42412976,2015-08-13,19359948,Lior,"The place has everything mentioned in the description and Marlo even included a closet full of toiletries, which came in handy since both my roommate and I forgot toothpaste. The neighborhood is very nice, and within walking distance to downtown Seattle. Overall, the stay was great and I would recommend this place to anyone. "
4546924,42736922,2015-08-15,5147918,Jonny,"Marlo is a fantastic host! Exceptionally easy to communicate with, and also very helpful and accommodating. I would highly recommend her as a host! Thank you for everything, Marlo."
4546924,43421358,2015-08-19,1671927,Jason,"Marlo was a wonderful host, the accommodations were top notch, quite possibly the pinnacle of air bnb apts. location is great. Overall, a spectacular stay!"
4546924,43812218,2015-08-22,17382339,Charles,"The unit was beautiful, very clean and comfortable. Very good location and accessible to downtown. Marlo our host was super nice and accommodating. Will definitely recommend to friends."
4546924,44299412,2015-08-25,1717105,Dara,"Marlo's place was perfect!!! We hope to return soon!! Marlo and Dylan are gracious hosts who were very friendly and helpful!!
The location is ideal and the apartment had everything we look for when traveling with our 18mo old!! "
4546924,45732491,2015-09-05,42671225,Jared,"Great place, great location, great host!  I would highly suggest this for anyone wanting to be in Seattle at a great price."
4546924,46332935,2015-09-09,22772,David,"Marlo welcomed us to her wonderful apartment which had everything we needed. The rooms were large and very clean.
Very quiet neighborhood and we walked to many coffee shops and restaurants, so location was perfect. "
4546924,47212423,2015-09-16,43636712,Kelsey,"This place was amazing!! Beautiful and very clean space inside, and really nice outdoor space too! Marlo was so accommodating the entire time, and they even left a book of great things to do in town! Would recommend to anyone! Really good location too, very close to great places in town. Loved it!"
4546924,47822582,2015-09-21,43635801,Peter,"Marlo was awesome. She was so nice, helpful and thoughtful. Her place was great too. The place looked great, it was clean, and had everything we needed. The neighborhood was great too. It was pretty quite, but walkable to Capitol Hill or downtown. We didn't need a car."
4546924,47942840,2015-09-21,1272609,Vanessa,"Beautiful place and Marlo was not only extremely hospitable, but went beyond to make the place feel like home: This is the perfect place to stay and great location. "
4546924,48755317,2015-09-28,32224943,Cameron,"The stay at Marlo's was seamless from booking to checking out. The listing description was completely accurate and then some. The space they provide their guests is beautiful and comfortable with all the commodities you'd ever need. Marlo went out of her way to make sure we were accommodated and comfortable with what we were provided with. Did you accidentally forget to pack something? No worries, they probably have you covered! 

The house and hosts are a great representation of the Eco-minded forward thinking state that makes Seattle great. The outdoor space also rivals the house in terms of beauty and forward thinking with the ""green roofs"" and inviting fire pit on the backyard patio space for guests to use. Plus, the location of the house only a 5-10 min Uber ride anywhere downtown. 

I highly recommend a stay and Marlo and Dylan's if you're trying to decide on where to stay while visiting the Seattle area. "
4546924,53910243,2015-11-14,47591921,Dan,"The home is really cute and spotlessly clean with eco-friendly and modern amenities. Online pictures of the home are accurate.    The bed was very comfy also. The location was close to our daughter's apartment, Safeway and Trader Joes, which made it very convenient. We were able to fix meals at home and have our daughter and her fiance over for dinner.  The home has a nice secure backyard for our dog...Our host's dogs are sweet and good-natured.  Marlo and Dillon made us feel very welcome.  They encouraged us to contact them if there was something they might have that we needed.  Parking on the street was easy and hosts provided a parking pass for our use. Would definitely book here again."
4546924,55067272,2015-11-27,9076866,Alisa,"Marlo was a lovely host and I still can't get over how great this apartment is. Super cozy and quiet, and near all the best stuff on the Hill and the ID. It was the perfect place for me and my pup. Thank you for such a wonderful home-away-from home, Marlo!!"
4546924,57628523,2015-12-28,43196393,Rita,"This sleek, comfortable, nicely furnished apartment was exactly what we were looking for. Approaching the private entrance at the end  of the driveway makes you aware of the beautiful backyard that, weather permitting, would provide a lovely outdoor space. There is nothing that our hosts forgot from the Keurig to the well stacked sundries closet that mimicked a CVS.  
Take-out menus are on hand and restaurants are nearby but if you choose to cook Trader Joe's and the Co-op Market are not far.
Located in a quiet neighborhood it will provide a respite after a busy day of touring downtown Seattle. Buses are nearby.
Our thanks to Marlo for being very attentive to our needs and making our stay most enjoyable."
1815304,8619936,2013-11-08,1105708,Jason,"Just looking for a quick overnight in Seattle and this spot was perfect! Steps away from everything on Capitol Hill. We absolutely lucked out on this location. 
Michael is awesome. He's an extraordinarily welcoming and genuine host who opens up his unique home to you. The accommodations are in a second floor loft and while an air mattress is not the most immensely comfortable arrangement, the location, space, and value made up for this aspect. 
Thanks Michael! Good luck in Seattle."
1815304,8650470,2013-11-10,9893319,Holls,"I had an incredible experience staying with this host family.  Such great, loving people who are very hospitable and recommend the best restaurants and attractions around town.  The condo is situated perfectly in downtown Seattle, which was great for walking and site seeing. The room provided is a loft which is cozy (provided with privacy curtain) and has a luxurious queen sized air mattress to sleep on. Getting in and out of the condo was easy and we were provided with a set of keys. There are two dogs named Zero and Frida. They are very cute fluffy buddies that you can never give enough hugs. They are fairly quiet and mild tempered dogs, which is a plus. Michael and Lily are incredibly giving and easy going, and make for super interesting conversations! Overall, I give this 100% A+, and if I were in the area again I would definitely stay here again, no questions asked. "
1815304,8826617,2013-11-19,981071,Craig,"Awesome couple, awesome location, super friendly and hospitable and willing to do more than most. Very glad I chose their place. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone!! "
1815304,8986980,2013-11-30,10139489,Eugene,It was a great experience!  They provide family atmosphere.  I highly recommand it! 
1815304,9035702,2013-12-02,4831818,Geoff,"Michael and Lily were both wonderful hosts! We needed a place downtown and close to the action. Pike's Place was walkable and so was Capitol Hill. We used Lyft to get to Fremont neighborhood and see the attractions there.

Michael and Lily's place was comfortable and they made us feel at home (though we weren't there too much, since there was so much to see around their place!) They provided breakfast stuffs and coffee, and had a computer set up with a slideshow of things they'd done so far. We got locked out once because their the door to their apartment complex was busted for everyone, and they left what they were doing down the street to come let us in. Lovely.

Only small downsides: The air mattress would deflate (as air mattresses do) which would make the sleeping uncomfortable towards the morning. Not a huge issue if you're just staying a couple of nights. Also, they have small dogs, which would occasionally yip during the night. It only got to be a problem one night when Frida ostensibly needed to use the doggy bathroom. But Michael and Lily came back shortly after I texted them to let her out.

Michael and Lily were wonderful hosts, you can't really beat the location / price as far as we could see, and would recommend staying with them again. Cheers guys!"
1815304,9187037,2013-12-11,3116456,Kristina & Andreas,Michael and Lily are the perfect hosts for your stay in Seattle. They really like to host people and show them their neighborhood. We just stayed with them for one night and had a very good and fun time. The appartement is in the middle of everything. You can walk to the best places in town and it is just 5 blocks from the lightrail station. We would stay again.
1815304,9203411,2013-12-13,4037783,Ricardo,"Super friendly hosts, very clean place, plenty of privacy, friendly dogs, central location--you can't go wrong!"
1815304,9271140,2013-12-17,2903467,Brenda,Amazing and fun times at this great place in a wonderful location! 
1815304,9334983,2013-12-22,10319715,Dennis,"Great airbnb. Michael, Lili and the doggies were extremely welcoming and friendly. They were more like friends I have not seen for ages rather than strangers. 
The space is conveniently located. 10 minute walk to the shopping zones and 15 minute walk to the Pike Market. The space is also well-equipped with WiFi, computer and Netflix. The only down side was the air bed, but it would not matter for just a few days. Overall, highly recommended!"
1815304,9450985,2013-12-29,8324357,Shunfu,"Michael and Lili were awesome, generous hosts. I arrived on Christmas Day when most places were closed. Michael brought me around Seattle and even found places for dinner. They were both very friendly and great to talk to and had great tips for sightseeing and food. The apartment was very tidy and the loft was just amazing. They provide so many facilities that you won't be bored even if you decide to just stay in and chill. Definitely a place I would love to stay at again if I return to Seattle."
1815304,9710334,2014-01-06,9842156,Allen,"I was in Seattle for a decently long 8 days and my stay with Michael and Lily was an amazing experience. They are very friendly and accommodating to me. They had lots of advice for different hotspots to visit while I was in Seattle and helped me a lot in getting to explore the entire town at large. We even went out together at times and they know how to have a great time in such a large city. Michael and Lily are excellent hosts.

The location of their apartment could not be in a more convenient place, situated in the middle of Downtown Seattle close by to virtually everything you would ever need. Bars up the street, Pike Market down the street, and a whole motley of other shopping centers and wonderful eateries in between.

The loft inside their apartment is spacious and comfortable. They provide a computer, printer, and scanner all by the desk which was incredibly convenient for me, meaning I didn't have to use my laptop for any of my work. Their dogs Freida and Zero are adorable bundles of energy, although they sometimes bark at night. The air mattress is a little odd to sleep on at first and you have to refill it each night, but you get used to it.

All in all they were wonderful people, the loft is well equipped for most of your needs, and the apartment is in a fantastic location. You can not go wrong staying here."
1815304,9751652,2014-01-07,10977622,Alok,It was an awesome stay at Michaels place. Although we stayed only for one night we were made to feel completely at home. Michael is a very good host and we had a wonderful time with him going to bars and having the best possible hot dog so far in my life. Thanks Michael!!
1815304,9767069,2014-01-08,895258,Aaron,"I would strongly recommend MIchael's place to anybody. The hosts were incredibly gracious and hospitable. It's a beautiful apt in a central location. I couldnt have asked for much else, I had a lovely stay. I wish I had more time to hang out with them. "
1815304,9813262,2014-01-12,8216058,Eva,"Michael, Lily, Freida and Zero are nice host.
They gave us a lot of advice about Seattle.
Their apartment is very cozy, providing we have a wonderful time in Seattle
"
1815304,9856820,2014-01-14,6825142,Kate,"Michael and Lily were super nice! We checked in fairly easily, the location was very central in a decent building. We only stayed one night as we were just flying out of Seattle the next day, but it worked well for us. I would not recommend it for a long-term stay because of the lack of privacy in the loft area, but great for a couple days. Their dogs were really cute, but if you are picky about dog hair/smells then they might bug you. It was awesome having use to the desktop computer in the loft space with Netflix so we could watch our favourite shows in bed. The bed was inflatable, but you could adjust it quite easily to make it firmer/softer and it was fairly comfortable. It was nice having a kitchen there with complimentary coffee/tea and bagels. Lily even made us a delicious breakfast! Great hosts, and overall a great stay. "
1815304,9886796,2014-01-17,9862062,Mindy,"It was a great stay! Michael was extremely accommodating. His partner in crime gave some great recommendations for restaurants in the area and ideas for what to do. The air bed was not a problem much. If only one person was staying, the air bed would actually be perfect. For two people I think it's still ok to some extent. It did get really really hot during the night though. So DO pull the air bed away from the wall. Their dogs are quite well behaved and adorable. I would say that staying here made traveling in Seattle so much more fun and affordable than staying in a hotel that was equally as close to downtown. Plus it's great having a refrigerator and computer to use!"
1815304,9952670,2014-01-21,10003640,Riley,"Great place to stay in downtown Seattle, the Location was really the key factor. Their perfect 100 walk score is crazy awesome.

Michael, Lily and their two little dogs were great hosts and really helped making my stay in Seattle a truly fantastic one!

I fully recommend anyone staying in Seattle to consider staying here as they will definitely be glad they did."
1815304,10006413,2014-01-25,638861,Pete And Clare,"My wife and I recently spent a week in Seattle to scout out the various neighborhoods for a planned relocation later this year. Two of those nights were at this downtown location with Michael and Lily, who were fantastic hosts. The location was amazing! You couldn't ask to be more central. Parking can be a bit tricky, so if you are planning to drive make sure to speak with Michael ahead of time. There were lots of amenities and public transport links within walking distance, so you really wouldn't need a car if staying here. Michael and Lily were kind enough to show us some of the great bars and restaurants in the First and Capitol Hill districts. They also provide some great advice for those thinking about relocating to Seattle (they were in our shoes 6-months ago). Great hosts, awesome location, comfortable bed, clean bathroom and friendly dogs! Highly recommended!"
1815304,10123125,2014-02-01,1640335,Cynthia,"I absolutely enjoyed my stay with Mike and Lilly. The doors and the building were easy to find and get into. Mike was super friendly, super hospitable, and helpful. As soon as we walked in he handed us the key to the place. The place is comfortable, clean & welcoming. They have two small dogs but when Lilly and Mike go to bed the dogs go with them. The place is very central and can walk, bus or lyft it anywhere. They offered us bath towels, orange juice & bagels (even though we could not find any cups in their kitchen). I cannot say enough of how helpful they were with recommendations on itinerary and places to eat. Their place was central to restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and shopping! There was a bit of confusion on booking so we had to book another Seattle location the same day we left our home city, but Mike was kind enough and gave us a ride the next day to our second airbandb in Seattle. If you do not mind sleeping on air mattress I would highly recommend staying here. I would definitely come back to stay with them again if I am ever in town again!"
1815304,10155252,2014-02-03,11207099,Breanne,"Michael and Lillie were phenomenal hosts! This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have found a better home to start our adventure. From the moment we got there, we felt right at home and very welcomed. They had such a fun energy and were extremely helpful recommending the best bars, restaurants and things to do around town. I wish we would have had more time to spend with them! The view from their place was beautiful and the location truly is ideal: safe and literally a hop and skip from just about anywhere. I never thought that the hosts would be such a highlight of our trip of exploring Seattle. Thank you for everything Michael and Lillie! :)"
1815304,10195748,2014-02-05,10438565,Taggart,Micheal and Lilly were awesome hosts! Their place is clean and in an awesome location. They took me out the night I got there and showed me a great time. They know a lot about the city and really helped me get to know the area. I highly recommend them to other travelers headed to Seattle. 
1815304,10418061,2014-02-18,8274180,Monika & Martin,"Michael and Lili were exceptional hosts, they provided not only space - they invested their time and energy to show us the city personally. And we can assure you there is a lot to see! 
Apartment is in walking distance to the centre and many little (and inexpensive) restaurants and bars. It is warm and welcoming place with everyhing what you need for your stay. There's only one drawback - the air mattress doesn't provide high comfort... 
Overall, we've been very satisfied."
1815304,10528679,2014-02-24,2307576,Katherine,"My friend and I stayed with Michael and Lili while we were in town for a conference. They were very nice and helpful (great restaurant recommendations) during or stay. Their place was perfect for us and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Even though we are all busy, it was great to hang out with them and get to know them at the end of the day. Plus, their two dogs are absolutely adorable and very sweet. I would recommend them to anyone wanting to stay in/near downtown."
1815304,10569892,2014-02-25,11394564,Destinie,"Michael and Lili were great!  Unfortunately, we were only there for one night, but a great night it was. Lili greeted us and immediately showed us around the place. Also offered us a lot of information about the sites to see and how to get around. At night, they suggested really great bars that quickly became my Seattle favorites. Their dogs are SO adorable and well behaved. Michael and Lili are so friendly, informative, helpful and always made sure we knew that if we ever needed anything they were there. It was because of them our stay was easy, nice, enjoyable and especially memorable."
1815304,10674460,2014-03-03,9331154,Rachel,I had a very nice time with Michael and Lili. They were both friendly and open with their home. The location of the apartment was wonderful and everything was just as they had described it. 
1815304,10762497,2014-03-06,5137853,Romina,"The location of Michael and Lili's apartment couldn't be better; we walked everywhere in the city, and the neighborhood is surrounded by cool places to eat and drink. Their apartment is lovely and comfortable. If you've never slept on an air mattress, it might be awkward at first, but it's a good night sleep anyway. They are very friendly people, willing to give directions and advice on the places to visit. The dogs are lovely, too! We only stayed for two nights, but we totally recommend their place. //
El departamento de Michael y Lili no podría estar mejor ubicado: fuimos a todos lados caminando y el barrio está lleno de lugares interesantes donde comer y tomar. Su casa es linda y cómoda. Si nunca durmieron en un colchón de aire, quizás les tome un rato acostumbrarse, pero igual se duerme bien. Ellos son gente muy amigable, siempre dispuestos a darnos indicaciones y consejos sobre qué lugares visitar. Sus perros también son adorables. Solo nos quedamos dos noches, pero recomendamos este lugar sin ninguna duda."
1815304,10794612,2014-03-08,4491578,Jill,"Great location, very friendly hosts. The space is not very private, but the photos are accurate. It worked out very well for me. "
1815304,10839428,2014-03-10,8539895,Belle,They are really nice. They introduced us many good places in Seattle. Wish we can stay in their house more days. 
1815304,10924290,2014-03-13,12132608,Susan,"Mike and Lili’s main mantra was to make their guests feel comfortable and at home - and they did exactly that for me. They welcomed me to Seattle with open arms and I became enamored with the city on my first day. They are flexible, easygoing, and very accommodating to needs if you ask for help. Also, I am allergic to dogs with fur but I didn’t have a hard time when I stayed at their place. The dogs were so well-behaved, joyful and rarely went up to the area I was sleeping. "
1815304,11271288,2014-03-27,12795211,Josh,"We really enjoyed our stay at Michael and Lili's apartment and felt very comfortable throughout our time in Seattle. Unfortunately Lili was out of town during our stay, but Michael was extremely knowledgable on things to do and had great suggestions during our stay. The location couldn't have been better and there was a myriad of things to see and do. We found it easy to come and go as we pleased and always felt welcomed on our return by Frieda and Zero. We would definitely stay at this location again and would recommend it to anyone.

Thanks! 

Mike and Josh"
1815304,11395130,2014-04-01,10999486,Aaron,I had an excellent time staying with Michael! He was a great host. His knowledge of the Seattle area was extensive and he pointed out a lot of fun things to do in my down time when I wasn't at my convention. I'd definitely stay at this location again and recommend it to anyone!
1815304,11651274,2014-04-10,13851930,Michelle,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I had a great time staying at Michael and Lili's apartment. This location is ideal because it is centrally located to everything you want to do while in Seattle. It's an easy walk to downtown Seattle, local bars and restaurants. Micheal and Lili are warm, extremely friendly, and offered great ideas of where to eat and even took some time one evening to show me some of the local bars in the neighborhood for a good drink. Also, what made the stay all the more enjoyable were Frieda and Zero who greeted me with over-the-top enthusiam and they are well behaved, adorable, dogs. I felt like I was at home while visiting and I definitely recommend this spot and plan to book again with them on my next visit to Seatte."

1815304,11850688,2014-04-16,14209695,David,"We had a great time staying at Lili and Michaels apartment. It was our first airbnb experience and we were really happy to had such nice hosts like Lili and Michael are. They helped us to find a parking lot for our car and gave us some good recommendations for bars, restaurants and sightseeing! We were welcomed to use the kitchen, balcony, bathroom and living room! The location of their Home was perfect. It was a great experience! We highly recommend them!"
1815304,12144496,2014-04-24,8354912,Serena,"We stayed at Micheal and Lily's on our first ever trip to Seattle, and we have to say that one of the reasons we adored Seattle so much was due to these amazing hosts. As soon as we arrived we were welcomed like old friends - they introduced us to the best burgers in all of the US - Li'l Woody's, took us out to explore some of Capitol Hill's most incredible bars - with pinball all night, and gave us so much insight into a city they obviously love. Had a blast, thanks guys! "
1815304,12223094,2014-04-26,4661323,Courtney,"Michael and Lili were very friendly and easy to coordinate with. The location is perfect and although I was visiting for work so I didn't have much time to chat with the hosts, they were great about letting me get my work done upstairs! "
1815304,12329811,2014-04-29,11832480,Armando,First time using airbnb and I’m satisfied with everything. Michael & Lili are a great hosts and their apartment is real cozy and very very close to The Washington Convention Center which makes it quick to get to all tourist locations. He even prepared good guide books ready for us. We had great chat with them and enjoyed the whole stay. 
1815304,13207656,2014-05-22,12302003,Tracey,"The location was great- if you're in town for a conference, you can't ask for a better spot. Close by restaurants, shopping, convention center, etc. Groceries are a bit of a hike if you need heavy shopping, but there's a convenience store on the corner if you just need basics. I arrived right after the host's standard mattress died and before the futon frame arrived, so I slept on the mattress on the floor, which was fine for me. I also love animals, so the dogs didn't bother me, however if you're anti-dog or allergic, you may want to look at another listing (they live there, we don't). I was attending conference stuff from 9-7, so I didn't get to spend tons of time with my hosts, but overall, my first Air B&B was good! "

I had a great experience and I recommend it to everyone, specially if you are looking for a place close to downtown, restaurants and shops.  You would also enjoy the view of the town from the balcony. "

We were able to walk everywhere we needed and Michael and Lily even showed us around some of the amazing nearby bars. They made us feel very welcome in Seattle and gave us loads of great recommendations.
1815304,17500008,2014-08-13,14810219,Johanna,"Staying at Michaels was great. The hosts were really nice and helped us with every kind of questions. The place is located in downtown, just perfect. We really loved our stay there and would always come back :)"
1815304,17931769,2014-08-19,15865229,Nick,"Lili was great. She was helpful in telling us about the local hotspots. She made us feel very welcome.

The location within the city is excellent... actually it couldn't be any better. We were just a few blocks from anything anyone would want to do in the city.

If I had to nitpick it would be the smallish bedroom... which is an office in the loft area, with a convertible couch in it. Being that it was mid-August it got a little hot up there with no AC. That said, we didn't travel to Seattle to be locked up in an hotel room or apt... so we didn't really mind at all.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who doesn't mind sleeping on a couch-bed."
1815304,18497802,2014-08-27,19953823,Devin,"Very welcoming. Michael and Lili make you feel at home. 

Fantastic neighborhood. Blocks away from Pike's Place Market, easy access to the lake, ferry's on the bay, tons of fresh eats. "
1815304,18679667,2014-08-30,19812480,Zack,"I arrived in Seattle with a couple days to check out the area. I didn't have much of a gameplan, and Lili and Mike were both extremely helpful. They told me about must see places and referred some great restaurants. Later on Mike showed me some local bars which made for a great time. The place was nice and tidy, and the dogs were uber friendly. A++ "
1815304,19464418,2014-09-13,1535098,Elizabeth,"The absolute best things about this place are:  1) The location, and 2) Lili!  The location is absolutely amazing - just steps from the convention center, easy walk to the market, and other downtown destinations.  In the other direction,  hole in the wall bars, restaurants and just all around kool places to hang.  We didn't get to meet Michael, but my advice to you is - whatever Lili tells you to do, drink or eat - Do it, Drink it, or Eat it!!  Her recommendations allowed us to have some of THE best food and drinks, hands down, that I have ever had.  Must trys include Kedai (hole in the wall Malaysian) and PieBar (Pietini's!!).  She is a wonderful and sweet host. We felt completely at home.  

When we first arrived I was a bit worried about the small space upstairs (it pretty much fits the bed and the desk and that's it), the open aspect of the lost (its got a curtain for privacy), as well as the shared bath (although it was clearly stated), and thought I might have made a mistake.  However, Lili made us feel so at home that in the end none of that mattered, and I was just SOOO happy about the location and her company!  The apartment is small so 4 people would really fill it up, and if you need real alone time there are probably better options - but we had a truly wonderful stay.  Thank you so much Lili!!  You are the best!  Mwah!!!"
1815304,19684121,2014-09-16,19755274,Tim,This was my first time using Airbnb and I must say that Michael and Lili were great hosts. They also have two friendly dogs. Lili gave us recomendations of what to do and where to eat. There place is in a excellent location and everything is in walking distance. I would recommend this place to anyone that plans on staying a couple nights in Seattle. 
1815304,19892126,2014-09-20,14711268,Greg,"The pic is accurate - the room is a loft at the top of the very cool spiral staircase on the left. Very comfortable even during warm weather for Seattle - nice Dyson fan keeps it great. Two little dogs - a pug and a long-haired terrier named Frieda, easy to make friends with. The place is close to good eating and the Paramount Theater - Neil deGrasse Tyson was there for a few nights as well as Brian Regan. Good cinema nearby as well. I flew in and needed no rental car. I used Lyft and foot travel to get where I needed to be (I was here for a week of work). Michael and Lili are great people and experienced with Airbnb. Yup, no doubt I'd do it again."
1815304,20283301,2014-09-27,132583,Charlotte,Apartment very well located. Lili has been very welcoming. Might stay there again in the future.
1815304,20428569,2014-09-29,1897668,Paula,"Michael and Lili were great hosts. Very warm and welcoming. They really made our stay at Seattle a great experience, especially with all their really good suggestions (the map they provided with landmarks as well as places to eat/drink at, was also quite helpful). Their home was very lovely and my friend and I thought that the decor was very tasteful. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here when they come to Seattle. 

bonus: Their pups are also the nicest ever, so fun and loving."
1815304,20675354,2014-10-03,21851139,Dave,"The listing was accurate, Michael and Lily were super welcoming and utterly keen to see me well-fed during my stay, and this was my first airbnb experience, so they left a great impression and made me want to try it again.  The neighborhood is just unfairly awesome.  Delicious food at adorable places everywhere I looked, and access to everything downtown.  I want to move in."
1815304,20818828,2014-10-06,1994513,Kirsten,"This was such a great stay! I felt so welcome and could have not asked for a better downtown accommodation. That said, it IS still downtown with all its noise, dust, air, and sketchiness - only a block away. I am happy i stayed right there, i walked to all the places i needed to be."
1815304,21102166,2014-10-11,4723961,Ladan,The location is great. Lili is very nice and welcoming. I had a great experience.
1815304,21441087,2014-10-17,4888996,Esteban,"Lili offered great suggestions and a lot info about exploring Seattle. The loft is a private area with shared bathroom. It was the perfect place to explore Westlake / Downtown Seattle.   Make sure you get the CityPASS and if you like to walk there's a lot of stuff nearby including the light rail and monorail a few blocks west that leads to to the space needle.  I spent the evenings exploring Capitol Hill which is conveniently within walking distance heading east.  Day time you can head west and you can do all the tourist stuff.

Lili and Michael also have two sweet and friendly dogs but they are trained to stay out of the loft area."
1815304,21825134,2014-10-25,20247714,Kenneth,"I had a great time with Lily and Michael. Unfortunately this was a business trip, so there was not much time on my side. But whenever I could get a few hours off, Michael and Lily had several great tips handy. Whenever I can make it to get back to Seattle, I will make sure I can stay with them again. Thank you so much for such a great Airbnb-first-timer experience."
1815304,22182425,2014-11-01,19998020,Martin,"Home away from Home. Michael and Lili made me feel totally at home for the 4 days I was there. They invited me to join them for dinner or drinks on a couple of occasions. they are also have lots of knowledge of   whats going on in the city. Comfortable bed, with all the amenities you need.

I will definitely be staying here should I ever be back in Seattle, and recommend everyone to stay with Michael and Lili  "
1815304,22524867,2014-11-09,21248016,Johan,"Staying with Michael and Lily was fun and exactly what I needed. I only slept there and we went out together a couple of nights, which is a really cool way to find out the cool bars in Seattle. Michael is a Yelp guru who knows all the best places. Not to forget: their apartment is really close to the convention center, that was the main reason I picked them! 
Thanks again!

Johan"
1815304,22674868,2014-11-11,20811262,Zachary,"Great location- the walk to Pike Place and downtown was easy. The Space Needle wasn't too far either... The apartment is nice- nice little loft for your bedroom! Honestly, it was everything it was advertised. And Michael and Lili were great too- very friendly and hospitable. Cute dogs as well! We only had a short stay there but would recommend it."
1815304,23307507,2014-11-28,23272268,Peifen,"Have a rest time in Michael and Lily's house! They are so nice, give me much help and make me feel so safe in my personal trip. It is a very great location in downtown to get good restaurant and buy everything. "
1815304,23809516,2014-12-11,10140596,Tim,"Excellent location, timely feedback, warm hospitality, reasonable price, and lovely dogs made our stay in Seattle more special than it could have been!"
1815304,23876977,2014-12-13,2089615,Dylan,"Lili was an incredibly enthusiastic and welcoming host. I was comfortable in their loft room and found their apartment to be very quiet. The location within walking distance to downtown, Pill Hill, and the light rail is superb."
1815304,25202610,2015-01-09,16648335,Jason,Really awesome location. Just a block from the convention center. Michael was a great and friendly host. 
1815304,25625803,2015-01-20,26384231,Adam,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1815304,25660524,2015-01-22,644536,Linda,"Staying at Michael's and Lily's was a good choice for three reasons - its location, Michael's and Lily's insight of their city, and their adorable canine companions Zero and Freida. We visited Seattle for the first time, arriving from China at the Westlake light rail Station with our luggage. Before checkin, we had three hours to kill, so we ate our first meal in a Japanese restaurant upon Michael's recommendation. Excellent Sushi! Many yummy meals followed afterwards in endless quality restaurants within walking distance. Zero and Freida kept us company when we rested in the apt. Zero loved to play and both of them (especially Freida) snuggled with us on the sofa. We heartily recommend Michael & Lily's place for Seattle first timers! "
1815304,26023357,2015-02-01,816743,Douglas,"Great space in an excellent location. Michael and Lili were both very welcoming and offered their expertise on surrounding areas of town (which I needed as a first-time visitor). Their two dogs were sweet and quiet, and I felt very welcome here in Michael & Lili's place. I would surely recommend and stay again."
1815304,26377373,2015-02-10,18828378,Marcel,"Michael and Lilli are awesome hosts. 
We felt very welcomed and home. 
The flat is located in the middle of the town and the street surrounding it are full of adventures. Both of them had very nice suggestions for different locations and things to do downtown.
Their Dogs Zero and Frieda have been a lot of fun while we stayed.
We would recommend them warmly as hosts for Seattle to everyone."
1815304,26436913,2015-02-12,8692789,Alex,Michael and Lili were fantastic hosts. Room is great with comfy sofa bed and good bedding provided. They took me out and showed me local bars and restaurants in the capitol hill area which is a really cool place. Its an excellent location where there is a solid nightlife any night of week. If you want to see the best of Seattle and have a blast while your there then these are the hosts for you.
1815304,26804077,2015-02-19,5882444,Andrea,"Great location, super friendly hosts! Great doggies that are a lot of fun! The room is spacious and welcoming. There is a little bit too much noise coming from the cars on the street, but nothing that will keep you up."
1815304,27401391,2015-03-03,27391620,Jeff & Amanda,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed our weekend visit to Seattle. Michael and Lilli had lots of places to recommend that we check out. And the recommendations were great! The location was very central. We were able to walk to most places from Michael and Lilli's. They were very warm and friendly. The space was clean and comfortable. The dogs were cute, too! :) "
1815304,27547783,2015-03-07,3157832,James,"Had a wonderful 3 night stay at the best location in Seattle. Michael was very welcoming and warm. His is really the ""best location in Downtown"". Within walking distance to downtown Seattle and also close to bus lines if you need/feel like riding. Great stay!"
1815304,27774635,2015-03-11,6564681,Virginia,"This location is truly in the center of it all! We walked everywhere from pike place to the space needle. There are cool places to eat (Michael knows them all!) and great bars close by. The dogs are super sweet and love to get attention, so cute! Overall we loved our stay at Michael's place. "
1815304,27889918,2015-03-14,28256754,B,"Me and my friend visited seattle for two days and michael and lili's place were very close to everything. We had our own room and the dogs were great. Michael and Lili were very friendly and so easy to get along with. Although we weren't home for most of the day, we enjoyed our stay. They are great people, and are very flexible with check in and check outs. I hope to see them the next time I visit . "
1815304,28172031,2015-03-19,27758666,Tanniqua-Kay,Lilli and Michael made me feel extremely welcomed and made sure that i was comfortable with my surroundings as well as help direct me to great places in Seattle. They had great brochures for me to see what was around the city and encouraged me to explore-- good experience.
1815304,28274706,2015-03-21,27717707,Stephanie,"Michael and Lilli were fantastic host! They were both really welcoming and the loft was super clean and comfortable. The apartment is in a VERY central location. It was a short walk to a ton of bars, shopping, and restaurants! Michael and Lilli had lots of recommendations on where to go. All the places we went to were great! I would definitely recommend staying with them. Plus, their dogs are adorable! :) "
1815304,28519488,2015-03-25,26531084,Wendy,"Michael and Lilli are such great hosts! They were extremely welcoming upon arrival and their dogs, Freida and Zero, are the cutest! The location is far away enough from the nearby shopping/food areas so that it is a calm space but close enough that everything is an extremely short walk. Several locations, including Pike Place, Space Needle, and much more are definitely accessible on foot should you want to save on a few bucks but Ubering anywhere is pretty cheap. Transportation to/from the airport was a breeze too!"
1815304,29192925,2015-04-05,14008418,Anitra,My partner and I visited Seattle and this place was ideal because of the location! Lilli was really nice and welcoming. We were able to walk down to Pike's Place Market which was great. The space was accurately described and great if you are only in town for a couple of days and need to centralized location!
1815304,29512245,2015-04-08,27602068,Diana,"The location was perfect, only a block from the convention center. Michael was flexible with our check in and helpful with recommendations of places to visit. We would definitely stay again!"
1815304,29828964,2015-04-13,27819425,Adrian,Great experience staying at Michael's place! Very welcoming and knowledgeable about the neighborhood.

Michael und seine Frau waren sehr nett und Hilfsbereit, hatten viele tipps für Restaurants und Aktivitäten.
Die beiden Hunde waren sehr süss."
1815304,30588448,2015-04-24,31532774,Mehran,Great hosts. They offered lots of advice on Seattle. My accommodations were very clean. I would highly recommend Michael's location to anyone!
1815304,30876917,2015-04-28,29504622,Lindsay,Lili and Michael were very accommodating and kind.  They offered suggestions on where to go in the Seattle area and the location/price is perfect.  
1815304,31514795,2015-05-06,8563123,Kaitlyn,Lilli and Michael were the best hosts ever! They were unbelievably welcoming. They made us feel at home in their apartment and took time out of their days to show us a good time around Seattle. We couldn't have asked for better hosts. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone looking to experience Seattle at its best.
1815304,31881597,2015-05-11,24234760,Ricardo,"I visited Seattle for a conference at the Washington Conversion Center. The location of the apartment was the top priority in my search at Airbnb. After leaving Seattle I can say that it was the excellent tips for F&B and sights and the help from Michael and Lilly that made my stay in town memorable. 
I can highly recommend this hosts/room and will definitely come back in my next trip to Seattle."
1815304,32282747,2015-05-16,4755799,Laura,"The location couldn't be better: near to sights, bars and restaurants. Walking distance to Peak Place market. They are nice and the communication was easy. 
They even provided us with some food and coffee :)
The pets are friendly. 
The house is small but you have everything you need. The room for guests is also small once the sofa-bed is extended. "
1815304,32745330,2015-05-21,26320913,Huidi,"As international students traveling from Kansas to Seattle, we carried a lot of luggage with us when we arrived in Seattle. It was so nice that Michael met us and helped us with the luggage on the check-in day. During the five-day stay in Seattle, both my friend and I felt home when we lived at Michael & Lily's house. Michael provided us with a lot of good recommendations about the places to pay a visit, try foods or have a drink. We loved the time talking with Lily who is pretty interesting and friendly (we also got breakfast made by Lily in the morning that we left). This is probably the best location in Seattle to live if you would like to enjoy this city: you can walk to Pike Market, Starbucks, good restaurants, shopping malls, bars of different themes, Capitol Hill; you can take buses, or light rails, or taxis to travel around in case you're tired of walking (though not much walking) and want to explore something new of the city's system. It is really convenient to reach all of the interesting places in downtown Seattle, which is also one aspect that makes us fall in love with this city. This stay was pretty enjoyable and we highly recommend friends to choose Michael & Lily's place if they get an opportunity to visit Seattle, and fall in love with it like we did :)."
1815304,33117088,2015-05-25,30739196,Pooja,Great location. Michael made really great recommendations on places to see. Very friendly and welcoming.

He gave a lot of good recommendations for food and places to go for fun and was very very accommodating.  His place is clean and your room is in the loft upstairs for your own privacy. Michael was super hospitable, making our stay in Seattle all that much more enjoyable. Also, his dogs Zero and Frida are super friendly and the cutest dogs you'll ever meet!"
1815304,33571550,2015-05-30,22065270,Lauren,"I stayed at Michael's apartment for 3 nights and he was an excellent host. He had a ton of great suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood, and when we told him some of the activities we had planned he suggested other places to eat or things to see nearby. We had a late flight out on our last day and he was very accommodating and let us keep our luggage in the apartment after we checked out. The two dogs are also a plus, they are adorable and very friendly!  "
1815304,34116690,2015-06-05,25301991,Matthew,"Michael and Lillie were excellent hosts. They instantly made me feel at home, really knew their city and showed me the local highlights. If I'm back in town, I'll definitely be looking to stay there again."

He had loads of recommendations. The location is perfect walking distance to everything. We felt comfortable and had our own space. The dogs are super cute. We didn't get to see Lilli much but she was very warm and welcoming also. 
Thank you again for a great stay in Seattle"
1815304,35103874,2015-06-15,19242929,Ya Han,"Michael and Lilli were the most awesome hosts! They had a ton of great suggestions for things to do in Seattle. They instantly made me feel at home; not to mention the location is perfect, very close to everything.  If I'm back in town, I'll definitely be looking to stay there again.  In addition, their pets Zero and Frieda are just the most adorable and friendly dogs. I would highly recommend Michael's location to anyone!"
1815304,35380083,2015-06-18,547167,Daniel,Great place to stay close to everything downtown. Michael was great with many recommendations of awesome things to do in Seattle and really made sure you felt like home. They are both awesome hosts and I would both recommend it to others and stay here again. 
1815304,35569787,2015-06-20,12493642,Karine Et Quentin,"Michaël & Lily make us feel at home. Both were very nice, and took some time to give us some advice about nice stuff to do in Seattle.

There were available to respond to all our questions. Their place totally fits with the description they provide on the website. It is really well located, and we were very quickly downtown by feet.

We really enjoyed our stay, thanks again to both of you !"
1815304,35906371,2015-06-23,27417520,Patrick,"My wife and I had a phenomenal time staying with Michael and Lili in Seattle for our 30th birthdays. Their living space/amenities were exactly as expected and they were excellent hosts to us.  They were very welcoming and quick to give us any advice we wanted on local fare, coffee and other must-go's all over Seattle.  We highly recommend them and look forward to staying with them again!"
1815304,36466644,2015-06-28,33927776,Amber,"This was my first AirBnB and it was a great experience! They have a beautiful apartment in a great area. It was so easy to get anywhere I wanted. I was in town for a conference, so I loved the easy access to the convention center. It was super close to Pike Place and other downtown destinations or a short ride on public transit to anything else! They were very welcoming and offered great suggestions for good eats nearby. I came to Seattle a lot as a kid, so I already had my own list of things I wanted to do to relive my childhood, but they know the area so well that they would be an excellent resource for anyone less familiar with Seattle. I felt fortunate they had an opening for the dates I visited! Very sweet dogs too."
1815304,36772274,2015-07-01,23671928,Kasey,"Michael and Lilli were good and friendly hosts. Lilli graciously waited up when we first arrived as our plans changed and we didn't get in until nearly 1am; even then she was very welcoming and kind. However, we were a little deceived by the pictures of our space (the loft area) online. We pictured a nice bed, but in reality it was a fold out futon. The bathroom was not the cleanest either (but I have high standards) and underwear was left on the floor both mornings I went in to take a shower. If those things don't bother you, this will be a great fit for you. The location was prime for walking to almost anything downtown or to the metro, but parking was a hassle and obviously not cheap in Seattle. If you need any tips or recommendations Lilli is  a good resource!"
1815304,37139008,2015-07-05,25850052,Rebecca,Great location! Walking distance to just about everything you want to see! Smooth check in and check out! Michael and Lily are very friendly and helpful and will take you out to introduce you to the city if you'd like!
1815304,37453372,2015-07-07,16222514,Cynthia,"Very nice experience staying in Michael and Lily's apartment. The location of the apt is very nice, closed to everything. Even though we have a car, we choose to walk when we visit the city. Michael and Lily are very friendly. We checked in very late in the evening (12.45 am) because we came from Olympics national park, which is super far away from the city but Michael was still waiting for us. 
Although we haven't had the chance to talk too much, as we were out all day and went back very late, but Michael and Lily are very good hosts. It was a very good experience staying in their home. "
1815304,37832071,2015-07-11,27123742,Ryan,Michael and Lili have a really excellent place in Seattle that is at the heart of everything in the city. Best of all they had some really great suggestions for things to explore and we had a great dinner together discussing the town. I would love to stay again with them!
1815304,38372283,2015-07-15,4079915,Helen,"My experience at Michael and Lilli's apartment was great! It was a perfect location to explore the city and they made me feel very comfortable in their home! They gave me a run down of the different suburbs, restaurants and things to do in the city! :) I would definitely recommend staying with them! "
1815304,38599799,2015-07-17,33271377,Sarah,"""Best Location in Downtown Seattle"" is exactly right! I couldn't have asked for a better base of operations for my exploration and adventures. I never got a chance to meet Michael (simply because my comings and goings didn't coincide with his), but Lilli and the adorable pups welcomed me warmly and provided awesome suggestions for things to do and food to most certainly not miss. Since I visited solo and didn't have much time and thus packed light, the loft was the perfect space for me and very comfy. "
1815304,38861378,2015-07-19,2704486,Brittany,"The location was awesome, and the hosts were super knowledgeable about the area. Their dogs are so cute! 

Lili and Michael were also flexible given our schedule—much appreciated!

1815304,39797418,2015-07-26,2840811,Sarah,Michael and Lili were very accommodating to our unpredictable arrival time. They were friendly and welcoming. We felt comfortable in their space. 
1815304,40918272,2015-08-03,21208148,Jennifer,Michael and Lili's place was in a great location. We were walking distance to everything we wanted to see. They gave us great suggestions!
1815304,41730083,2015-08-09,14954015,Kai,"I had a great time staying here for a week. The space was quite comfortable and it was close to plenty of places to eat and hang out. Micheal was a great host and made me feel very accommodated, and I'd totally stay here again if I were to come back."
1815304,42387415,2015-08-13,33279035,Sam,"First, I should say I didn't spend much time in the apartment because I was attending a conference and had activities from 8am-10pm every day I was there.  The futon was comfortable, though the apartment got very hot at times. (I stayed there in August.) There was a fan in the room, which helped a good deal with the heat. The bathroom is small, but it was very tidy and the water pressure in the shower is awesome! I had to wait a couple of times for the bathroom in the morning, but that's understandable when 3 people are using the same bathroom and trying to get out at around the same time in the morning! I didn't see them much because I got back most nights after they went to bed, but they were very nice when we did get a chance to talk! They recommended some activities for me, but I didn't have any time to do them! :(  Thanks for a great and easy stay! 

If you're going to need to go to the convention center, I highly recommend this place! It's a five minute walk to the center, and I suggest you walk through the park to get there! Very pretty. "
1815304,42667128,2015-08-15,32635544,Zhihua,Lili and Michael's place is excellent!  It is close to many attractions and great restaurants.  The room is nice and clean.  The hosts are very friendly.  They are accommodating to my arrival schedule and they give really good advice!  The dogs are cute and sweet!
1815304,43359234,2015-08-19,26416454,Talia,"My boyfriend and realized last minute this was a shared space reservation (our first time using airbnb) but lily and Michael were great hosts. They took us out the first night to come local bars in capital hill. A great karaoke spot as well (Michael is a fan :)
They were very welcoming and suggested many spots to spend time in Seattle as well as bainbridge. Try out shiros for sure... Amazing! There is smoking at this apartment on the balcony but with the doors open all the time it allows the smoke inside so just a warning. The futon was comfortable... Clean sheets and pillows. The shared bathroom was clean but could be a tad bit cleaner in the shower. The dogs.. Frita and zero are soooooo cute! Great hosts overall! "
1815304,43784432,2015-08-22,16555650,Helena,"Great location, close to everything. Really nice hosts and everything went smoothly."
1815304,44286607,2015-08-25,33281491,Michael,"Great hosts who were very friendly/ helpful. Great location and apartment was very nice. Can be cramped at times, but great for a short stay."
1815304,44645131,2015-08-28,24022363,I-Chieh,Super convenient location. Lily is very friendly. We enjoyed our trip very much.
1815304,45363664,2015-09-02,29242947,Michael,Michael and Lily were both wonderful hosts. I mostly saw Lily while I was staying but it wasn't a problem because she made me feel right at home by showing me all these great places to eat and by being very kind and informative. I would love to stay again. Seattle is an amazing city and I hope I can come back soon.
1815304,46577677,2015-09-12,32638988,Allan,"Our hosts were very nice and welcoming. We didn't get much time to talk as we were seeing Seattle most of the day and our trip was during the week. The place is centered really well around everything so you'll usually walk or take a short Lyft/Uber or bus/rail ride.  For the short stay we had, its proximity to everything, and the price, it really is worth it. "
1815304,46975323,2015-09-14,42599411,Nicholas,"We enjoyed our stay with Michael and Lily, the location was excellent and the room was as described. Very friendly dogs that were fun and did not bother us at all. Everything went very smoothly thanks to our experienced hosts."
1815304,47963321,2015-09-22,13168310,Lydia,Michael and Lily were wonderful and made us feel very welcome. We used the kitchen and the tv a couple times after spending the day at the market. They were very nice and let us drop off our luggage early so we didn't have to haul around all of our stuff for the entire day.
1815304,48173686,2015-09-24,20363198,Marylou,"Chris and I had a nice stay :) we were only there a couple of days and didn't spend much time at home. The bedroom and apartment was just as described and everything was ready for us when we arrived :) the internet connexion wasn't great, but again, we didn't stay at the flat so much so it didn't really matter. Michael and lily were nice hosts! "
1815304,48691990,2015-09-28,9638687,Melinda,"Michael & Lily are amazing hosts and their two dogs are friendly and sweet. I absolutely had the best time staying at their apartment. Perfect location, great little balcony and private loft space. If you are interested or in need of any guidance when it comes to things to do in Seattle, restaurants to try, bars worth visiting, and a little history of the city itself, Michael and Lily are well-versed and more than happy to help. I fell in love with Seattle and it was partially their fault! :) I highly recommend booking this Airbnb for your next trip. "
1815304,49003913,2015-09-30,40008717,Lingyin,The house is very convenient to any places in Seattle downtown . Lily is very nice . She give us many suggestions . It's a nice place .
1815304,49268034,2015-10-02,42560023,Aline,"Lily is really nice and made us feel comfy right away ! The 2 dogs are cute and discreet, as Michael and Lily !

A little bit of noise at night because of the open window, but everything else was fine. Great for short stays, as it is near everything interesting in Seattle =)"
1815304,49666590,2015-10-05,21052568,Brandon,"Wow! What can I say? Mike and Lily's location was as described. Maybe even a bit better than I anticipated. I traveled solo, but the room could definitely accommodate a couple. Wifi and iron were provided.

Steps in any direction outside of their apartment will lead you to whatever brought you to Seattle. Nightlife/entertainment, amazing food, quick access to public transportation.

Mike and Lily were great as hosts. Actually, you can't really ask for too much better than those two. When I checked in, Lily took some time out to give me the run down on Seattle neighborhoods and where I should go based on my interests. Michael invited me out for a quick drink with his crew before I went off to a catch show downtown. I was having so much fun that I lost track of time and almost missed my show!

Review summed up in two words: Stay here"
1815304,50147393,2015-10-09,14947205,Trilogy,"Loved the central location, nestled on a hill close to downtown. My hosts were very accommodating. "
1815304,50439883,2015-10-12,38597516,Micki,"Excellent location in Seattle, plenty of privacy, great balcony. Hosts had a lot of great recommendations. Had an amazing trip!!!"
1815304,51152048,2015-10-18,31116449,云貞,It's comfortable and convenient there.Also have two lovely dogs:)
1815304,51669144,2015-10-22,46587945,Brittany,"You won't find a better location. If you are looking to explore downtown, you are walking distance to everything. Give up the search and just stay here, well worth it."
1815304,52852645,2015-11-02,44264495,Yi-Cheng,"Perfect location in Seattle Whatever you want to have a great meal, buy something in grocery store, go to famous scenery e.g Pike Market, Pioneer Square, Downtown waterfront
Michael and Lily are very nice , invited us to bar and gave us a lot of advice for trip (and we really liked Bainbridge! Really beautiful island! )
This is our first time to America and find accommodation by airbnb, and we really glad to meet Michael, Lily and have a wonderful trip


"
1815304,53488610,2015-11-09,6211059,Jeongmin,"Micheal's family really welcomed me and let me have a comfortable night during my stay. Since this apartment is located in very convenient place, close to the Starbucks Roasting and Convention Center, I was able to walk down to the city center even very late night. Although I couldn't have a chance to hangout with them due to bad condition, in spite of their kind offer at Friday night, other visitors will be very satisfied with their hospitality as well. "
1815304,53984020,2015-11-15,25027361,Wei,"Great hosts! The apt is close to Seattle downtown and there is lots of great good food nearby. They are really friendly gave me many advices. The two dogs are so cute, I like this place very much."
1815304,54342291,2015-11-18,17437061,Kyle,"Location, location, location! This place is walking distance to everywhere! Michael and Lily are very nice people. They are a wealth of knowledge when it comes to the best restaurants in town. Despite the fact that the loft is blocked off with curtains, there is plenty of privacy. If you're looking to explore Seattle, stop your search and book here."
1815304,55382696,2015-12-01,29155890,Laura,"PERFECT location! Walking distance to everything. Clean rooms and friendly hosts, including super cute dogs! "
1815304,57372801,2015-12-25,48032964,Yue,the hosters are very kind. and the puppies are really cute its a nice experience
1815304,57613911,2015-12-27,50786493,Joanne,"Location is amazing, walking distance to DT. Very cool hosts and adorable dogs! "
1815304,58027310,2015-12-31,10956726,Gabbie,"They had fantastic suggestions for food, night life, and fun. They knew it all! Good time staying here, and their dogs were the cutest:) great people! Thanks for everything!"
6376952,37383414,2015-07-06,35319023,Frank,The host is easy to communicate with and check in was smooth. He had many useful tips about Seattle that improved our trip. The house is beautiful and a great deal. Super clean and well appointed.
6376952,38215778,2015-07-13,266456,Scott,"Staying at the ""Om Home"" was an absolutely wonderful experience!  The house is immaculate, located in a picturesque neighborhood, with stunning views and gorgeous sunsets.  Jonathon was a generous and accommodating host who gave great recommendations of things to do in the area and helped us feel right at home.  We really appreciated his flexibility with our schedule.  The house was a perfect size for our group of 4 - two of us took the king in the master bedroom, and the others took the 2 queen bedrooms.  The neighborhood is very quiet and we were able to sleep in late and enjoy the serenity and calm of the surroundings.  We had easy access to the beach, hiking trails, a fantastic Danish bakery and great shops & restaurants in the nearby neighborhoods.  This was a great spot to stay for day trips into downtown Seattle, visiting UW and taking the ferry to the islands.  We couldn't be happier with our stay and highly recommend this house and its gracious hosts to anyone visiting the area!"
6376952,39024437,2015-07-20,25068687,Alexandra,"We loved our stay at the beach house!  The house is in a lovely neighborhood and the location made it easy for us to do day trips to both Seattle and the surrounding areas.  Jonathon left a list of recommendations of things to do, nearest grocery stores, etc. which was very nice.  The permanent downstairs tenant, Andy, was very welcoming and respectful of our privacy.  As well, the house is spacious and accommodated the 4 of us very comfortably.  By far, the best part of the house is the amazing views of the ocean and mountains - some of the best sunsets we've ever seen!  We hope to come back soon!"
6376952,41091194,2015-08-04,35682786,Chelsey,"What a spectacular location and incredibly gracious host(s)!  A beautiful home in a gloriously quiet, private, classy neighborhood.  The home is elegant, yet so comfortable.  The views from the deck at any hour is soul-restorative.  Our stay went by far too quickly, thanks to the ""home away from home""!"
6376952,45499306,2015-09-03,34995916,Jane,"Great place to stay in Seattle! Easy to go to everywhere, great ocean view, nice park beside the sea in walking distance, nice house with great interior design and comfortable bed!

Jon and Andy is also very helpful! 

Will definitely recommend this place to all my friends and relatives who plans to visit Seattle! Hope to stay here again for my next Seattle trip too."
6376952,45996579,2015-09-07,1855962,Sparsh,The beach house was great.  The views were spectacular and the accommodations were very comfortable.  I was visiting for a wedding and my friends staying in hotels were definitely jealous.
6376952,47830666,2015-09-21,20438979,Michael,"What a great AirBnB experience!  Jonathan and Andy are a great duo to make sure your visit is perfect.  The house is super clean with a very mature design touch - the art, furniture and even the cookwear and plates are great.  I mean, who is vintage Pottery Barn crackle plates made in Japan in their cupboard?!  You will love the amazing views and be sure go check out the North Ridge Beach...it's a nice walk down the road...complete with a coastline railroad.   My wife and Parents loved it...the whole environment made for a very special 4 days.   Thanks, Mike"
6376952,55184305,2015-11-29,39040355,Pansy,"Great house,great host,great location!!! The pictures are very true to the property. Gorgeous view of the sound and mountain range. Well stocked kitchen...had a fantastic homemade Thanksgiving meal and wonderful relaxing stay. Home is spacious and comfortable. Access to Ballard area and Pikes Market are great. No need to even fight freeway traffic to get downtown...access from city streets are quick and simple. Thank you Jonathan for being so informative and making us feel so comfortable !!!"
6644854,35343141,2015-06-17,12118834,Amy,"My family and I had a great time in this lovely condo. It was airy and filled with big BIG windows! Amazing views! The beach just a few steps away! Modern amenities, tastefully decorated, and clutter free! No raising of the eyebrows here! It definitely felt like we were on vacation! Even though we booked very last minute, Ryan was very accommodating. Super easy-going, gave great recommendations, and  flexible. His place was close to downtown and everything in Seattle.  Easy access and parking was a bonus! Just a short stroll can also take you to some fabulous restaurants! Yes definitely would stay again."
6644854,35425248,2015-06-18,33234172,Gillian,"Great views, fun restaurant walking distance   Very comfortable "
6644854,35506472,2015-06-19,7091475,Astrid,"We had a great time in Seattle. Ryans place is beautifully located. Communication was easy and quick response everytime I had a question. Thank you very much, Ryan"
6644854,35707972,2015-06-21,34655717,Dave,Ryan was so accommodating and available for all questions. The place is incredible from the view to the decor to the beautiful neighbourhood. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. 
6644854,36241354,2015-06-26,34754650,Fred,Ryan was great. Accommodated us on short notice. 
6644854,36436075,2015-06-28,2454867,David,"Excellent experience in Alki Beach!  Ryan was an great host and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  The location was relaxing, but close enough to visit the Seattle sites with my friends and family.  We would look forward to returning to Alki Beach and would absolutely book here again. "
6644854,37229121,2015-07-05,35913275,Glen,"Great location on Puget Sound, with beautiful view for the water and sunsets.  It was easy access to downtown Seattle (15 min drive). It was also just a 5 min drive to Lincoln Park which overlooks the water, as well as a 5 min drive to Alki beach, which is a very nice sandy beach along Puget Sound.  Ryan was a great host and responded promptly to all of our questions.  He also was happy to provide additional sheets/blankets for an extra family member to sleep on a sofa.  The apartment was spacious so that we could spread out and not be cramped.  Definitely recommended!"
6644854,37798254,2015-07-10,15943348,Ryan,"The view, the morning air off the ocean, and space to spare. What an incredibly cool space in a great part of Seattle. I had never been to west Seattle and it was perfect, get out of touristy downtown and explore more of the beautiful Pacific Northwest. "
6644854,37825894,2015-07-10,4665692,Tracy,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6644854,38310400,2015-07-14,34604741,Nathan,"We spent a night in Ryan's place. It is a nice condo right on the waterfront as described.  We enjoyed walking along the waterfront sidewalk in the evening and watching the sunset.

The condo was nicely appointed and we were in want of nothing. The one small nit would be that it is close to the road so there was a bit of noise but this is to be expected as we had the windows open during the Seattle summer."
6644854,38517325,2015-07-16,15007110,Matt,"The views are fantastic, particularly from the master bedroom.  Great neighborhood vibe but you will need a car as restaurants and services are a good 20 minute walk.  Big turnoff was Seattle Public Utilities digging up the road in front of the unit which we did not know about. "
6644854,38659296,2015-07-17,1847331,Ross,"Ryan was fantastic. Left detailed instructions on how to get to his lovely home and easy to understand how to get in, and even get straight on the WiFi.

Would certainly stay here again. Thanks Ryan!"
6644854,38859787,2015-07-19,20537988,Phillipe,Overall my group and I were very pleased with the townhouse. The townhouse was as described on the webpage and photos. The view of Alki from this place is awesome. Ryan also responded promptly the week of the reservation. He left me clear instructions how enter the house and where to park. Thank you for allowing us to stay for the weekend man.  
6644854,39322486,2015-07-22,37686759,Kelsey,We had a wonderful time at this property. It was easy to get an uber for transportation. The view was awesome!
6644854,39553787,2015-07-24,38398039,Cheryl,"The townhouse was as expected from the beautiful photos.  We had a party of 6 and the townhouse worked well for us.  The area is Alki Beach and was a pleasant surprise.  We were close to downtown Seattle (15-20 minute drive) for the whole tourist agenda and then...relaxing at ""home"" in the Alki beach area.  The townhouse is close to the beach and local restaurants.  It's a quiet neighborhood and the ocean breezes at night were the best for sleeping.  Comfortable and worth visiting again.  A pleasure........."
6644854,39653565,2015-07-25,1333974,Linda,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Waterfront townhome.  The view from the master bedroom is gorgeous and what you see from the advertising picture.  We had a lovely walk to Alki Beach and back which was nice after driving a few hours.  The townhouse was very nicely decorated, slept 6 comfortably and was roomy enough to invite an additional 3 friends for dinner.  My only complaints were inadequate lighting in the kitchen, no cork screw and no soap in the hand soap dispensers in the bathrooms.  A neighbor was kind enough to loan us a cork screw though so the day was saved!  I would definitely stay here again.  Ryan was very helpful making all the arrangements for our arrival and with our inept attempt to open the lock box to get the keys.  Great neighborhood."
6644854,39941708,2015-07-27,12699381,Maria,"We had an amazing birthday weekend in Seattle with super views from almost every window! Perfect location away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but close enough to access anything you might need.  We caught a Mariners game (12 minutes away), had the best Italian food ever at La Rustica (2 minute walk) and perfect bakeries minutes away (Bakery Nouveau and Cupcake Royale). Great location for walking or jogging and the house itself is wonderful! "
6644854,40152021,2015-07-28,38408897,Kevin,"The day we spent in Seattle prior to our Alaskan cruise was great.  The rental is in a nice area of the city. Alki Beach was close by. Ryan's townhome was accurately represented from the description.  Ryan was great about ensuring our locating and our gaining access to the property.  If there was A/C, we were unsure if it was working.  A few amenities may be considered (hand sanitizer or soap/hand towel in bathroom, coffee).  This was our first experience on AirBnB.  Overall, we were very happy with the reservation and would recommend Ryan's property for others on AirBnB."
6644854,40475226,2015-07-31,4275660,Corbett,"Great condo across the street from the water. The place is nicely furnished and very comfortable. We were there for a brief visit, and it was great place to crash, but there are a few drawbacks. We arrived on a very hot day and there is no air conditioning. There is one stand up fan in the living room but it doesn't provide much relief. Secondly, the home was not stocked with any soap or toiletries. None of the bathrooms had soap, shampoo, etc. It wasn't a huge issue, but it would have been nice to either know before hand, or have provided. Overall, a cool place in Alki."
6644854,42241266,2015-08-11,28246220,Albert,"Ryan was quick to respond and easy to communicate with. Even after hosting many people in my own house before, this was the first time I used Airbnb as a guest and I was not disappointed. House was as described. Beautiful views and quiet neighborhood."
6644854,42584186,2015-08-14,39639313,Sama,Great location not far from downtown Seattle.  The condo was spacious and clean.  Ryan was a great host.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend to family and friends.
6644854,43929287,2015-08-23,8425907,Teresa,"Ryan was very responsive to my questions and the view of the water from the condo was a nice touch!  We enjoyed our stay but a few things would make the place even better for the guests (such as more kitchen staples, new carpet, drawers in the bedrooms and more hangers, etc.)

A couple things to note:
1.  There is only 1 fan (one email said there was a fan in each bedroom.  There is not)
2.  There is only one TV.  I got an email that said there was a TV in the master bedroom, but there is not.
3.  Parking in the alley is much more convenient than in the garage.
4.  The upstairs linen closet and back bedroom smell bad of stale smoke.  
5.  The upstairs tub is a bit tricky to get to stop dripping.

Hope this helps!"
6644854,44266599,2015-08-24,20865495,Ian,"This apartment with spacious and good for a family of four. The location was excellent and the views are fabulous. However the apartment is furnished cheaply. The bedding and mattresses could use an upgrade, and it would be nice if body soap was provided in the bathrooms. There was a leak inside the refrigerator, But we only stayed one night, so this was not a major inconvenience."
6644854,44673274,2015-08-28,39712460,Teresa,"Lovely home - exactly as what the listing showed. Spectacular view, comfortable home and great neighborhood for walking or running. We were here on business and it is wonderful to come back to this lovely place after all day meetings! Our host, Ryan was very responsive as well. Will definitely come back again!"
6644854,45574524,2015-09-04,36973547,Claire,"Ryan was a terrific host!  We had questions when we arrived, and he responded right away and smoothed our entry into the townhouse. The townhouse is lovely with tremendous views. It is spacious and airy! The area is five minutes from restaurants, bakeries, and grocery stores.  Parking is available and makes everything easier. We took beautiful walks from the townhouse right by the water. All in all it was a truly wonderful experience! Thanks Ryan!"
6644854,45950870,2015-09-07,36669590,Deedee,The property was great!!  Awesome views.  Would totally recommend it to my friends. 
6644854,46876086,2015-09-14,21613207,Sarah,"Lovely rental, everything we needed. Beautiful views and easy access."
6644854,47938996,2015-09-21,10610914,Bethany,"This home was wonderful with a gorgeous view!  It was spacious and comfortable. Ryan even went above and beyond to add a couple of ESPN channels to the cable package so we could watch our college football games!  He was super responsive and respectful. 
We had a great time!!"
6644854,49852704,2015-10-06,43120613,Carl,"Ryan was easy to work with and very responsive. 
Helped out with a couple questions we had during our stay.
Will be back for sure!!"
6644854,51148950,2015-10-18,43549340,Sarah,"We so enjoyed our time on Beach Drive in Ryan's condo..the neighborhood is lovely; there is a nice park just one block south, and the Alki Beach Park starts just a few blocks north on Beach drive. The views of Puget Sound from the living room and master are expansive and satisfying. We were comfortable and not crowded and enjoyed the full kitchen as we cooked several times. 

Ryan could not have been a more gracious host. He communicated promptly and warmly at every step of the rental experience. Everything in the house is exactly as he said it would be. We would come back to this place if we had the chance, and rent from Ryan anytime!"
6644854,52701599,2015-11-01,44119037,Amanda,"Thanks, Ryan. We had a great time staying at your place. The condo was very clean and exactly like the pictures. We had a wonderful weekend. Great view from the top bedroom and balcony!"
8236094,57075188,2015-12-21,50920728,Gabriel,"The place was awesome! Jorge knows the city very well and could give us a lot of directions and must-go places, so we had a great time in Seattle."
8236094,57935996,2015-12-30,50947439,Weiyi,"Jorge is super nice. He knows the city very well. He has a lot of booklets and maps of Seattle for us to use. The location is very nice and convenient. It is close to the Seattle center, where the space needle, Chihuly's exhibition, EMP museum, and science museum are. It is also 10 minutes' walk away from Westlake station where we can get light rail train to the airport directly. The house is clean and organized . He shows his passion of hiking and traveling in his decoration. I would love to recommend his place to my friends."

"
7965184,54285138,2015-11-17,36242573,Erica,"This was a great place and in a great location. It was easy to walk to Pike Place Market, around downtown for shopping, and to belltown for dinner and night life. The furniture was new and the place was very clean. We really enjoyed our stay and would stay again. The only advise for the next travelers, is to bring all of your toiletries as there is only hand soap in the bathroom.  Just something to think about since you are not staying in a hotel. "

5559643,28682467,2015-03-28,12454252,Joann,"No contact from host on our arrival, despite our emails and texts it was two hours before we heard from them.  Not enough pillows for our family (which we eventually received at 830pm), could not find towels, blankets.  No available wi-fi, for which host did contact cable company the next day and when issue not resolved, told me I would have to call them directly, and that I could go to Starbucks. This was an issue for me since I was planning on doing business work at the house. House cleanliness in general was not up to my expectations.  Broken cabinet in kitchen. Expired food in the refrigerator.  Open food pieces in kitchen cabinet.  "
5559643,29083159,2015-04-03,30249749,Kevin,Beautiful place in a nice neighborhood. Close to downtown but not filled with the usual city buzz. Great breakfast places and amenities within walking distance. Owner is quick and responsive. Would recommend this to anyone wanting to have a nice get away. Also wifi is quick as hell
5559643,29924594,2015-04-14,2639381,Drew And Sarah,"We absolutely love this cottage!  It's clean, very comfortable, and in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood, close to shopping restaurants, and Discovery Park.  What you don't see from the pictures is how big and private the outside area is...perfect for children and just hanging out.  Washer and drier came in handy as does the dishwasher.  Lots of sun and big windows (and even a solarium).  

As a host, Ella has outdone herself.   She's very easy to reach and is extremely helpful.  She even made special accommodations for us when we were in a bind. We will definitely be back!!"
5559643,32239623,2015-05-16,2639381,Drew And Sarah,"This charming home was a real find!  And Ella was a wonderful host --- even letting us stay longer than we had planned :-) and making a bike available for us.   Thank you, Ella!  The house is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood (and a quiet street) near Magnolia center and Discovery Park.  There's plenty of room for a family and both front and back yards are fenced.  Very comfy and clean with a gas fireplace, TV , and great wireless.  The larger bedroom even has a separate toilet.   we will definitely stay there again.     "
5559643,33585653,2015-05-30,30437105,Joe,"We really enjoyed our stay in Ella's Seattle Cottage.  We were there for five nights.  We have two young girls and they thoroughly enjoyed the play room and stuffed animals, as well as the bunk beds.  The house is in a great neighborhood, within walking distance to a community pool, coffee, bars, and other necessities, like ice cream.  I took the bus in and out of downtown (#24) for work.  The stop is nearby and takes about 1/2 hour each way.  Ella was responsive and helpful, and everything went smoothly.  We were very pleased and would stay here again."
5559643,34910589,2015-06-13,35162588,Susan,Ella was extremely responsive and helpful. My first time using Airbnb was a success thanks to her! 
5559643,35048602,2015-06-14,23122454,Caspian,Ella made it very easy for us to get into the home and enjoy our time in Seattle. She communicated well and made for a great experience. Great location in the Magnolia neighborhood as well!
5559643,35313751,2015-06-17,25549306,Linda,We enjoyed staying at the cottage very much!!  Ella was very prompt in getting back to us and made the stay welcoming and personal.

5559643,40428421,2015-07-31,29349017,DeeDee,"We stayed here for one month and it was great. It is perfect for families with small children. Magnolia is a great neighborhood 4 or 5 miles from downtown. Everything you need is walking distance, restaurants, parks, and grocercies. There is a bus stop to go downton nearby.  The house was clean and well stocked. The kids loved all toys and we felt very at home. Ella was a wonderful host. We really enjoyed staying here."
5559643,41731557,2015-08-09,9520842,Aaron,We had a great time at Ella's place in Seattle.  Short walk to a bus line that can take you wherever you need to go.

3041619,35162238,2015-06-15,1204257,Rachel,"This was a weekend dream come true. In the tree house, my two girlfriends and I felt far away from the excitement of the city. The amazing view of the trees, the songs of the birds and the accommodations were so peaceful. The house was amazing, fully equipped kitchen, comfy beds, great bathrooms, two balconies and a huge lounge area where each of us had our own couch to lounge. Sven was an awesome host, quickly responding to my emails, providing tons of suggestions for entertainment and food, friendly. We used Lyft for ll of our traveling needs. You'll love it here! Thank you Sven for a fabulous 40th Birthday Vacation!"
3041619,36505598,2015-06-29,27914176,Katie,"Great welcome from host! Sven contacted me the day before to ensure that our travel plans had occurred w/o a hitch. He was more than accommodating by allowing us to check in an hour early. Upon arrival he had simple instructions posted at the house as well as a bottle of wine for us to enjoy. The home easily accommodated I and 5 other grad students, and allowed us to have an incredible ""home away from home."" The comments from what we enjoyed the most: ""the view;"" ""being close to everything, but feeling like we were in the woods;"" ""the amenities at the house>>>from the blender to the bidet ;"" ""the deck space."" Sven even helped my husband and I with ideas of where to eat the day we checked out in the Ballard district. Hope to return to this great location!"
3041619,38392508,2015-07-15,21006501,Melissa,"We recently rented the House in the trees from Sven for a girls trip to Seattle. The house was absolutely amazing and Sven was super helpful. We were traveling with my elderly grandmother and Sven was thoughtful and kind enough to allow us to use the elevator which made things very easy for my grandmother. The views from the house were beautiful and we especially loved the outdoor patio. Everything was clean and tidy when we arrived and Sven was in contact the entire week to see if we needed anything. Overall, this was the best experience I have had on Airbnb. "
3041619,39474505,2015-07-24,12009047,Tom,"  Sven was a wonderful host. He left a welcoming bottle of wine and all the information we needed, plus a wealth of supplies that really came in handy!  The the description was extremely accurate, the house was beautiful! We would definitely stay here again. "
3041619,40316305,2015-07-30,4023948,Toi Sin,"Sven makes everything really easy with clear directions and notes. The house is great for a low key lay back homelike experience. It felt very much like a home that has been well thought out. Besides the big windows in the living room, I especially love the sky windows in the kids bedroom for watching stars at night."
3041619,40917983,2015-08-03,1690991,Rebecca,"This was a beautiful house - very spacious, lovely views, and easy to get around. Sven was very helpful and nice to chat with. He even bought us an extra fan to help fight the Seattle heat wave.  We had 8 people staying in the house and it was very comfortable. Our only comment is that 2 of the sleeping spots (2 couches in the living room) are definitely meant for early risers. There were no curtains or blinds and it faces east so the room became very bright and warm by 7AM, if not sooner. Keep this in mind if you are planning to have a large group. Otherwise, would definitely stay here again and recommend it to some friends.
"
3041619,41924485,2015-08-10,337551,Nick,"Sven was a wonderful host! A group of us were in Seattle for a week at Sven's serene place in the hills and couldn't have been happier. The home was large and very clean with ample amenities, very fast internet, and was located away from the noise but just a short cab ride to most of Seattle. I would highly recommend Sven to any other AirBNB travelers!"
3041619,42430137,2015-08-13,37289759,Roni,"The 7 of us, 3 generations including 3 teenagers spent two nights at Sven’s beautiful house in the trees. Sven was very helpful and texted me back very quickly. His written directions were very helpful as well. The location was wonderful and it took us less than 15 minutes to get to the Space Needle area. We even invited a friend for dinner at the house.  We bought a fish at the Pike fish market, prepared it on the grill and served it with the wine Sven left for us. Thank you Sven for a wonderful stay."
3041619,43216963,2015-08-18,30674389,Sheryl,"My family stayed here for my wedding. They loved it. It was like sleeping in a tree house. The night before my wedding, I stayed with my family. We looked up at the stairs through the skylights and chatted about what married life would be like. 

It was a wonderful, relaxing setting with a beautiful view. I wish I would have had more time to walk around the neighborhood. 

Sven is kind and accommodating. He even mailed back my Dad's forgotten tie. Thanks Sven!
"
3041619,43535447,2015-08-20,3629614,Martin,"Great house in attractive wooded neighborhood. Sven was very proactive and everything worked out great. I would definitely stay again. One thing to note is that one can hear the highway in the distance, but it is not loud and does not disturb sleeping at night.

Kitchen/dining/living space is big and attractive with great views."
3041619,45257775,2015-09-01,36070350,Kara,"A group from my company stayed here while in town for a convention, and they couldn't stop talking about the gorgeous views! Everything was very clean, and the space fit our large group comfortably. Sven was an excellent host, he went above and beyond and was extremely communicative and accommodating throughout the entire process. Highly recommend!"
3041619,45787401,2015-09-06,36002250,Pete,Great place. Amazing view. Perfect for a small family. Highly recommended!!!!
3041619,46279452,2015-09-09,26969729,Emily,"Sven provided ample instruction for check-in and the house was easy to find. Upon arrival, we were greeted with a welcome sign, a bottle of wine, and a beautiful view. The house is stunning and everything we expected from the photos on the listing page. The big windows in the living room provided an incredible view and the trees surrounding us made us feel like we were in a secluded jungle getaway, but only minutes from downtown Seattle! The home had all of the amenities one would need from a bluetooth speaker, a piano keyboard, plenty of appliances for coffee lovers and cooks, and a beautiful open space for entertaining friends and family. We were hoping for a space that was close to the city but felt like a getaway, and we couldn't have found a more perfect spot. I only wish we could've stayed longer!"
3041619,46677916,2015-09-12,22258824,Zak,"By far one of my most memorable and favoured AirBnb short stays! 

Sven clearly lays everything out for you and supplies a beautiful home tucked away in Seattle paradise. You won't be disappointed from from the gorgeous views, wonderful accessories and peaceful environment. Everything is supplied so you won't need to worry about a thing. Not once did I have to worry, not once did I feel lost and every moment in Sven's home was delightful. You park your car on a bridge, sit on a cozy veranda overlooking nature and listening to birds, breezes in the trees. Just do it! If you're wondering about a place this is the one I'd strongly recommend! Hotels have nothing on this, not to mention your supporting a awesome guy in the heart of Seattle. "
3041619,47454997,2015-09-19,1382900,Pamela,"Sven was a terrific hosts, making sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. The amenities were great. Some kitchen basics made it easier to make a couple of meals at home.  We used the BBQ to smoke some salmon we had caught. The house is absolutely as beautiful as he describes, in the trees with amazing views and privacy.  We are Airbnb hosts in Denver, and I so appreciate a good host and a good bottle of Washington wine!  Sven is one and we would always return to his home.  I will also very much encourage my friends and the review readers to book this house for a wonderful stay in Seattle.
"
3041619,47984683,2015-09-22,6482684,Oliver,"The House in the Trees was wonderful. Our host had everything prepared perfectly (including a bottle of wine), and the house itself is actually even nicer and more relaxing than the pictures suggest. I wish we could've stayed a week."
3041619,48440338,2015-09-26,43789928,Robin,"Everything about Sven's place was amazing; perfect location, views, and atmosphere. If you visit Seattle and have a chance to book this place, DO IT!"
3041619,49669214,2015-10-05,44025136,Amanda,I loved staying at house in the trees! I felt like I was at home in the midst of the city! We had a wonderful time and Sven was very informative and made the stay simple! This was my first airbnb experience and I will definitely be using it again.
3041619,49914620,2015-10-07,5050199,Gregory,"The house in the trees is just amazing!!!!  It was in the city but still felt quite secluded.  We went fishing in the morning and used the smoker in the house to smoke our fish in the afternoon, it was phenomenal!  I would happily stay here again."
3041619,50692549,2015-10-13,22103784,Josie,"Sven made us feel so welcome. His instructions were clear, he was in touch about check in, his description of the house was, if anything, not as glowing as it could have been. The place was incredible!! "
3041619,51328154,2015-10-19,44776923,Chris,"We enjoyed the place very much!  It was clean, well kept and stocked, and exactly as presented.  The Traeger grill was a welcomed blessing...the fresh caught salmon, steaks and ribs turned out wonderfully. Access to downtown was a breeze and Huskie Stadium was a short, easy walk.  This will be our first choice on our next trip to Seattle!!"
3041619,52085091,2015-10-26,42417973,Brian,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Sven's house was a terrific way to start!  The house was well stocked with beautiful views.  Tucked away in the park, it was hard to believe your were still in the middle of a bustling city.  I will be highly recommending this house to my friends when they visit Seattle in the future!"
3041619,52617759,2015-10-31,45925273,Shams,"This is one of the best AirBnB experiences I have ever had! Sven is a wonderful host.  Everything was prepared as stated and I had no issues during my stay. 

The place is even more beautiful in person as the photos show. There's plenty of space for a large group to stay over. 

The location is very convenient if you are planning on exploring not just the downtown area but the greater Seattle area as a whole as it is located right by the highway. If you are planning on just doing downtown, just make a note that the afternoon rush hour traffic can get a bit heavy so plan accordingly. 

Overall, this is a great place to stay in. I'd highly recommend it for anyone staying with 5 or more people in the Seattle area."
3041619,52841913,2015-11-02,44028559,Varun,"Sven was a great host! He was very friendly, available for questions if needed, and was flexible. The house was clean and well supplied. I would recommend him to anyone going to Seattle. "

4025954,19449422,2014-09-12,5825506,Amy,"This was the perfect place for us for a couple of quiet days away! James was an attentive and communicative host who gave us plenty of helpful tips for enjoying the neighborhood. The place was quiet, clean, and just felt like home, with coffee and tea and a basket of fresh fruit on the table. Steps away from beautiful Green Lake and an easy bus ride to downtown Seattle. We loved it!"
4025954,21851681,2014-10-25,22552125,Kara,"I loved my stay!! It was wonderful. A++++++++++++++++ experience. James is a gracious and thoughtful host. He went out of his way to make sure I was taken care of. Lovely touches like fresh flowers and a basket with fruit made me feel welcome. The apartment is great! It's charming, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood is quiet and just a quick commute to downtown. It felt like a little home away from home. Highly recommend. Thank you, James!"
4025954,21986555,2014-10-27,22555227,Sima,"I booked this little basement apartment for my parents when they were in town visiting for the weekend. Jim and his family were very flexible and accommodating, and the location was ideal - right next to the little shops and restaurants on the south end of Green Lake.  Parking was a little bit haphazard, but totally doable. I would definitely book again, this was wonderful!"
4025954,22275306,2014-11-02,6574620,Rusty,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is clean, comfortable, and pleasant.  Jim was a great host - responsive and accommodating.  The neighborhood is safe, centrally located, accessible to everything, and just an overall great place to experience Seattle. I'd definitely stay again."
4025954,22566817,2014-11-09,23350107,Lauren,"Jim was accommodating, and made sure to let me know that the apartment is the basement of the house in the main photo before confirming. Everything was really easy and went smoothly. The apartment itself was very clean. The bed was quite uncomfortable, but for a two day trip it was fine. The location is great, really close to the 5 and the 99, and lots of restaurants/shops nearby. We didn't walk anywhere, and parking wasn't a problem for us – there was plenty on the street out front. It rained overnight and the walkway to the basement entrance got quite muddy, but when we got back later in the day they had placed some stones on the path to walk on, which was nice. Overall, a pretty good experience if you want something affordable in a convenient neighborhood location. "
4025954,23527254,2014-12-03,11387249,Roz,"We had clear instructions about getting into the apartment. We were greeted by fresh flowers and lots of specialty items in the kitchen. In addition, the bath was very comfortable and there were plenty of items there too. Our host communicated by email to make sure that all was well."
4025954,25110819,2015-01-06,25206754,Chigusa,"Cannot be better than this!  

My kids and I needed a place where we could stay comfortably while packing stuff and cleaning our house to move out. Kids were excited to stay at a hotel. Now they say that they call this place apartment and they love it!  It became our home immediately. Everything we needed was here. As I step inside the house I could not stop sensing the warm hospitality all over.   You can tell that you are welcomed. 

Nice private entrance. Warm rooms (it is winter now).  Good layout. Lots of storage space.  Cleanliness everywhere. Toys, games and books. Kids DVDs. Cozy kitchen with complimentary coffee and tea, perfectly functioning for each meal. Great location. Walkable!

 If anybody stays in Seattle I highly recommend to consider to be by Green Lake. One of the best spots in Seattle. It really does represent the city. 

We have stayed here for a week. Then in fact we decided to extend our stay for another week till our departure. For sure we will miss this place once we leave. We are planning to come back to Seattle this year. Absolutely we would like to see its availability. 

Now I am off running around the lake!"
4025954,25786530,2015-01-26,9918729,Linda,"Jim made us feel very welcome and the basement apartment had everything we needed, plus some extra special things like fresh fruit and flowers.  It made very efficient use of the space, and when our granddaughter was visiting with her mom and dad, she really enjoyed the musical toys and instruments provided.  Parking was not a problem, especially on the weekend when the school across the street was not in session.  Jim gave us all the info we needed, coming and going, so we knew exactly what to expect.  We were not disappointed.  We would go back again."
4025954,26226262,2015-02-07,48938,Mahad,"Jim and his family have a lovely home in the best neighborhood in Seattle. It was so nice to be able to walk to so many nice restaurants, cafes, and bars. Access to the 5 was very easy. We found very convenient to get around from the apartment. Check-in was a breeze. Jim checked in on us multiple times. The apartment itself was as advertised with everything a person needs to feel comfortable. I would most definitely recommend staying at Greenlake Getaway! "
4025954,28306558,2015-03-22,26411638,Sarah,"Awesome location! We booked this cute little apartment as a long term rental. Jim was a great host & quick to respond to questions. The apartment was all set up with nice little touches like fresh flowers, coffee, tea and even cream. It was a great landing place after a long move from Dallas to Seattle. The location was steps away from greenlake & easy to access the rest of the city. There is so much within walking distance, we hardly ever drove. Overall a great experience. "
4025954,28739663,2015-03-29,2252332,Sue,"Our stay was perfect- great communication, adorable place, very clean and exactly what we expected. They even left us a bowl of fruit and some half and half in the fridge for our coffee! The neighborhood is really walkable--  parks, bars, breakfast restaurants, all an easy walk. We will be staying again the next time we're in town! "
4025954,32833748,2015-05-22,11796605,Terry,"Apologize for delay, returned to lots of water in Texas!  However, I could not delay this review any further.  This was the most fantastic place I have ever stayed at in Seattle.  Very close to surrounding parks and lots of activities from walking trails to renting canoes.  Host was excellent in staying in contact with emails and texts regarding any questions I had.  Only complaint was not being able to stay longer! Will definitely be on our place to check first while visiting Seattle."
4025954,34146625,2015-06-05,14301609,Diana,"Had a wonderful stay at the Greenlake Getaway!  First off, the location was perfect.  The unit is walking distance to many eateries and also a couple block to the beautiful lake.  The apartment is located in the basement of the hosts home and has everything you need to have a nice stay.  It was cozy and clean.  We were greeted with fresh flowers, breakfast snacks, coffee and tea, and lots of different kinds of milks!  The space was perfect for two and I could easily see three or 4 stay there with no issue.  There was always parking on the street.  It was such a cute spot to spend out nights after long days of exploring greater Seattle!  Thanks, James!"
4025954,34423586,2015-06-08,5445847,Victoria,"First of all the location is perfect. It's a block from the lake where you can rent boats, run or just walk. Coffee shops, restaurants, yogurt and a very good grocery w/ premade food is nearby. Place was very bright and clean. Has the full cooking facilities if you wish to cook. Provided nice amenities such as coffee, tea, granola, and basic cooking items. Loved his bathroom touches of spa salts. Overall, very good location, place itself was quiet. Parking was a non-issue. Short distance to the university. Short drive to downtown. Definitely will recommend "
4025954,34656520,2015-06-10,33772838,Ann,"Jim was a warm, laid back host. He was really attentive to our needs, and also respectful of privacy which is the perfect balance, in my opinion. I even asked if there were chairs to sit outside in the lovely weather, and a half hour later a new table and chair set arrived! We also asked for something outside the expected: a place to store and possibly charge a mobility scooter, and he went out of his way to make it happen which was a great help. The location is fantastic: 2 short blocks to beautiful Green Lake, with cafes etc. Great spot and great host."
4025954,35059739,2015-06-15,12744237,Bruce,This has been our best Airbnb ever. Everything about it was delightful. Will definitely stay here again. 
4025954,35398315,2015-06-18,33845936,Shiyang,The area was peaceful and convenient. Almost every stuff is provided. It is a great place for a rest on your journey. 
4025954,35911430,2015-06-23,7222114,Benjamin,James was a gracious host. I chose this listing in part because of the proximity to my house (I was putting up my parents for several days). The place was clean and comfortable. The apartment has a small but full kitchen a living sitting area and a separate bedroom. My parents were both quite pleased. 
4025954,36653164,2015-06-30,19258766,Sara,We loved the location! It was easy to take public transportation! The apartment was fantastic! It had everything we needed. James got back to us quickly anytime we needed anything!
4025954,40313507,2015-07-30,5687705,Chun-Yen,"Other guests have said it all -- great location, clean and well-equipped apartment, and wonderful host. James was easy to communicate with, accommodating, and thoughtful with every detail. We stayed for a month and had a blissful time. "
4025954,40992806,2015-08-03,8598835,Raeann,Jame's apartment was very comfortable & very thoughtfully equipped. It was super easy to get around Seattle from his place. 
4025954,41450157,2015-08-07,38959547,Kirstie,"This was my first AirBnB experience and I was very pleased. The place looks exactly like the pictures and was very clean. The location was amazing - next to public transportation that takes you right downtown Seattle with no transfers needed. We never had the pleasure of meeting the homeowner, but his messages were extremely friendly and he always replied very quickly. He made us feel very welcome with a personalized welcome sign, fresh fruit, flowers, coffee, milk, and a little guide to the beautiful surrounding neighbourhood. My only complaint is that the bed was very uncomfortable so we ended up moving to the futon, which was a little better. Also, for some reason the wifi connection was very hit or miss, but not a huge deal since we didn't travel to Seattle to play on our phones. Overall I would highly recommend this adorable rental suite !"
4025954,43515095,2015-08-20,37622471,Wendi,"I enjoyed our stay there very much. Loved the surrounding area, you could walk to coffee, pizza or best of all the lake. Easy public transit lines downtown. Helpful signs and dining suggestions. Only drawback, the bed was a bit beat, although that didn't stop me from having a good night's sleep. My son seemed to sleep well on the futon. Wi-Fi was a little weak too. Loved the fruit, coffee and stocked kitchen. "
4025954,44783330,2015-08-29,37833789,Kriss,"James made me feel welcome at the very beginning by posting a sign with my name on the door that  said ""Kriss this is the place"", also  Starbucks coffee and non-dairy creamer options, fruit and fresh cut flowers graced the dinning table.  Very nice touches. The movie collection was spot on with cartoons from my boys childhood. We built more memories together as we laughed and rememered their youth. This is priceless!
This Greenlake location gave me a central access to lots of Seattle activities and restaurants within walking distance. When I did use my car It was very easy to find parking, most of the time I found a spot right in front of the house.  As a guest I should have thought it through a little more. Me being a light sleeper, the basement space was a little noisy a couple mornings. James made me feel welcome and promised to be quiet and he did. I  met many spiders and being terrified of them I did not feel welcome. This is something the host apologized for and promised to look into and remedy.  The space was cozy and roomy. The bed was a little too springy for someone with a bad back so I moved to the futon. The pillows and comforters were cozy.
Thank you again Jim."
4025954,45467000,2015-09-03,16831038,Bethany,We were both extremely welcome and felt right at home in this lovely apartment. It exceeded our expectations although we weren't sure what to expect with our first AirBnB stay but we highly recommend this getaway home. It's so close to everything in town and not far from the downtown area . Jim was great with communication and helping us with anything we may need. The apartment was clean and full of little amenities and utensils to cook with. We didn't want to leave! This was much better than a stay in a hotel.  Thank you!! 
4025954,46136993,2015-09-08,9588809,Jay,The place is very delightful. Very clean and cozy. Right next to Green Lake. It is very nice to jog around. We would love to stay again for next visit.
4025954,46898031,2015-09-14,27926126,Jon,what an awesome basement apartment. Was welcomed with signs pointing me in the right direction to everything. the apartment was spacious and beautiful. James included everything within walking distance which was a huge plus. The location itself is great too as it is a quiet block with a huge lake 2 blocks away. The local food recommendations were spot on. definitely staying here next time we come to seattle
4025954,47302437,2015-09-17,31302771,Karen,"This was a terrific set up!  Such a great location, nicely appointed and comfortable.  The host did a great job communicating, so there was no stress involved.  We will certainly stay here again if the opportunity arises!"
4025954,47633645,2015-09-21,32163590,Mark,"James is an excellent host and made us feel right at home. Our AirB&B was clean, quiet, and lnestled in a neighborhood near friendly coffee shops, parks, and a lake. We were close to bike paths and a bus line.

James communicated very well, offered timely information, and answered all of our questions.

This was our first opportunity to try an Air B&B, and we're very pleased with our experience!"
4025954,48513827,2015-09-27,22776656,Nicole,Great place!
4025954,50739075,2015-10-14,27494379,Lorra,"James is a wonderful host.  The apartment is spacious, immaculate, comfortable, and thoughtfully furnished.  The kitchen is perfectly stocked and the lovely surprise of tea, coffee, and granola (plus milk in the fridge!) made us feel immediately at home.
We love the neighborhood for it's centrality, walkability, and peacefulness."
4025954,52239603,2015-10-27,44831085,Amy,Lovely basement apartment right off of Greenlake - it was everything we were looking for. The host kept us updated and made sure we knew they were readily available if we had any issues. A++ would stay again.
4025954,53988630,2015-11-15,42071951,Kimi,"This place was absolutely PERFECT. You can tell that Jim is a great and seasoned host. Details were provided before and after the trip. Walking into the apartment was amazing, there were flowers, fruits, an umbrella, coffee, etc etc....so much more! We felt so welcomed. Every single room had ALL of the amenities that we needed. The location itself is close to everything, Pike Market Place, Space Needle, International District, University district, Shopping mall, Everything! The walk to Green Lake was only 2 blocks away. Finding parking on the street was never a problem. I'm sure there is tons more postive feedbacks that I have forgotten. Point is we are already thinking about our next trip and staying here again! Thank you Jim for everything! We had a lovely stay. 

Kimi"
5252877,28664645,2015-03-28,24594242,Emma,Great apartment. Everything was in pristine condition. Amenities for both us and our kiddos were great. Friendly meeting with property manager upon our arrival. Great location. Would highly recommend. 
5252877,29840563,2015-04-13,19357551,James,"A friend of mine checked on my behalf and Autumn, the apt manager made it very easy to accommodate this for us! The apt itself was awesome and the view from the Living room/kitchen was just beautiful! The amenities were plenty for 6 adults, and the guidebook provided included all instructions that we needed for check out."
5252877,32044360,2015-05-13,76725,David,The host canceled this reservation 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5252877,33058381,2015-05-24,20997395,Herbram,The host canceled this reservation 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5252877,36324259,2015-06-27,19242872,Jim,Everyone was great and communicated very well before and during our stay. The unit was immaculate.
5252877,38583938,2015-07-17,27498414,Ashley,"The apartment was just as described in the listing. The pictures were identical. You do have to walk up stairs, but that was mentioned in the listing. As for cleanliness, it was mostly clean. When we pulled the hide-a-bed out, there were so many crumbs that we couldn't get them all off. My friend ended up sleeping on the other twin bed in the second bedroom. 

The check-in process was a disaster. We arrived on time, but the apartment Rueben gave us wasn't the correct one. We had a major freak-out moment. Rueben wouldn't answer his phone, someone was parked in our spot, nothing was going according to planned. I even call the owner, Melissa because her number was listed on the listing. She didn't email me back until several days later. Rueben finally called back and said we were in the wrong apartment, but that we couldn't get into our because it was still being cleaned. We waited an hour and half before the cleaning lady left. We were not pleased as we had missed plans with friends due to not being able to get ready. Then Rueben, the apartment manager had to come by. Oh my word. He had trouble changing the code to the door. I finally told him to leave it and that I would just use my door stop alarm.  Even after all the paperwork was signed, he still wouldn't leave. I finally had to tell him very directly to please leave because we had to get ready for dinner. 

The space was fine once we finally got in and settled. As for the neighborhood, we didn't really have to time to explore it. The apartment has a great view of the city and Mt. Rainier (when it isn't cloudy)."
5252877,39559933,2015-07-24,37717226,James,Great place!  Extremely clean and well-stocked with more than enough room for our group.  Would definitely stay here again.
5252877,40537780,2015-07-31,24639348,Gayle,"Three of us stayed here on our trip to see Wicked. Very close to downtown- with awesome views of the water and skyline. The pictures were accurate, the cleanliness was superb, the beds were VERY comfortable (I would like to know what kind of mattresses they are so I can buy some for my house). They even had a bottle of my friends wine in the refrigerator for us! Perfect way to cool off while getting ready for the theater. Communication with hosts were prompt. We will definitely rent here again!"
5252877,47963134,2015-09-22,28356405,Lauren,"We had a wonderful time staying in Seattle! This was an AWESOME location and very modern apartment. We had everything we needed when we arrived. We even had a parking spot so that we didn't have to look for a place on the street. The only thing we would have loved was more seating in the TV area. We had 6 people staying in this location so a wrap around sectional would have been perfect for when we all gathered to watch movies/sports. We would highly recommend this location, especially if you have fewer than 6 people."
5252877,52460265,2015-10-29,23510694,Angela,"This place is great! Really beautiful and close to everything you need. The bed was super comfortable and the apartment overall was very liveable and spacious. The host was great, very easy to deal with and made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again."
5252877,53692715,2015-11-11,7753870,Matthew,"Spacious apartment in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to interesting shops and tasty restaurants.  The beds were so comfortable, great to fall into after a day of exploring. The private parking spot is super helpful for those who wish to explore further than Fremont. Autumn was very helpful and responsive in getting us situated. Very nice place."
5252877,57704659,2015-12-28,25006393,Linda,"This is a review for the ground floor unit in the building.  We booked at the last minute and the top floor was already taken.  Everything in this apartment seemed new and in great condition.  Kitchen was well equipped .   The  beds were super comfortable and the apartment very clean and quiet.   The manager, Autumn was very helpful, communicated well and was there to meet us on arrival and walk us through the apartment. 

 Fremont is a fun location to stay in while visiting Seattle. convenient and safe.
"
5175631,27592631,2015-03-08,4157947,Gabrielle,"Jeremy was an incredible host and his place is the best Airbnb apt I've ever stayed at without a doubt. Everything was impeccable, clean and the space was fantastic. Unbelieveable views from all rooms, washer/dryer, parking space, a balcony and a very cozy feel that makes you feel right at home. I unfortunately did not get the chance to meet Jeremy but his instructions were very clear, was easy to get in touch with and he made us feel very welcome. Top notch penthouse and host. Definitely will book with him again on our next trip to Seattle. "
5175631,29744708,2015-04-12,9260928,Lisa,"I really loved Jeremy's place - first off, the view of Lake Union and Gas Works Park/Aurora Bridge is spectacular! Le Penthouse ;) is filled with eclectic art, dry bar, kitchen and cozy master bed is a perfect home away from home...but better. I was staying here for a convention over the weekend and loved super quick access to downtown, bars and restaurants via Uber (5 minutes). Also appreciated being able to make an espresso every morning on his commercial espresso machine. Each of the rooms are large enough for two couples with the Master having an attached 2 piece bathroom. Big screen TV with apple TV. 

Seriously cool place"
5175631,30620150,2015-04-25,29825368,James,"Exactly as advertised and then some!  Neat apartment, fabulous view. Jeremy was a great host, easy to communicate with, available as needed. The location was perfect for us, accessible both to downtown and the U District. As our first AirBnB experience, it will be difficult to top!"
5175631,31959449,2015-05-12,475224,Rachel,"The view is amazing. There is plenty of space. The penthouse was very clean and comfortable. 
I rented the listing for me and father to enjoy. My father doesn't get around easily so we enjoyed the balcony very much. We watched boats and sea planes as well as enjoyed viewing Mt. Rainier. 
Jeremy was quick to respond. He was very sweet to offer us a bottle of wine, oj, yogurts and fruit. "
5175631,32474467,2015-05-18,10194729,Chris,"Wow, all the 5 star reviews are certainly deserved! What a great place--comfortable, homey, good location near but not too near downtown, on bus line and bike lane, with a nice small market within walking distance--all with that fabulous view. Beds were great, shower great, and Jeremy kindly left us some food for breakfast.  We could do laundry, and there was a BBQ we didn't use. A wonderful spot for 2-4 people; we were 3 and didn't feel crowded at all. Highly recommended!"
5175631,33112947,2015-05-25,5897385,Jane,"Warm welcome. Gorgeous view. Quirky style. Though we thought we might have been further out of the center than we wanted, it was perfect.....easy walk bus or uber to anywhere we wanted.
Great beds& very very clean."
5175631,33591505,2015-05-30,1431347,Sarah,Wonderful place with amazing view.  Jeremy was very welcoming and available to answer any questions when we arrived. We loved enjoying an espresso in the morning from the deck! Great location to drive to downtown / capitol hill and walk to fremont as well.  We'd stay here again!
5175631,34291671,2015-06-07,29804974,Keller,"Jeremy was such.a great host and his penthouse is such an amazing  place to stay. Beautiful views, clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay at Jeremy's place next time I come to Seattle. Jeremy also took the time to chat with me before our trip and gave some great recommendations for cool things to do in the city. Thanks Jeremy you are the absolute best!!!"
5175631,35073783,2015-06-15,29754750,Kermit,"We loved this place!  Location was great, walking distance to Seattle Center, and down the hill and across the bridge to Fremont.  Views are  gorgeous and the balcony was a great place to have coffee after a morning run along Lake Union.  Jeremy is a great host-very easy to communicate with and we very much appreciated the bagels and coffee.  We would absolutely stay here again."
5175631,35977228,2015-06-23,32802747,Marissa,"Jeremy went out of his way to make sure we felt comfortable in his place. He met with me the night before our check-in and showed me the run-down, explaining how the electronics worked and where everything was located (vacuum, dishes, spices, extra towels, etc).

The place was exactly as described with its beautiful view of Lake Union and cozy, comfortable beds.

Only half a block from the Fremont Sunday Market and local favorite Fremont Troll.

He even went so far as to leave us noms for breakfast and a bottle of wine with fancy glasses for two, and offered us his tickets to the Sounders game since he couldn't make the it. 

I highly recommend staying here,"
5175631,36286420,2015-06-27,32906451,Jennipher,We got lost trying to find the listing but Jeremy was so nice to meet us in town and drive us to the apartment.  He was so welcoming and helpful for anything we needed but otherwise left us be with plenty of privacy. The building is a bit older with older fixtures and finishings but the view was absolutely incredible. There is no air conditioning and it did get a bit hot in the master bedroom but the rest of the rooms were nice and cool the whole time we were there in late June. The location was ideal.  We walked to Seattle Center in about a 1/2 hour with no problem.  I loved sitting on the deck each morning and evening and watching the view while eating breakfast or having a glass of wine.
5175631,36540716,2015-06-29,13321788,Nancy,"Look no further than this great place if you plan to stay in Seattle!  Jeremy couldn't have done more to make us feel welcome!  What an extraordinary host!  On his way to meet me, he asked if we needed anything at the market...so thoughtful.  His place is even better than described.  It was spotless and because it is his home, it had a wonderful warmth about it.  My daughter and I spent a lot of time in the director's chairs on the deck...what a view!  We walked to Fremont in just a few minutes and stumbled on the Sunday Market...so great.  The bus stops were handy, so we were able to navigate the city with ease from his place.  Thank you so much, Jeremy, for our memorable stay.  I wish we could have stayed longer!  "
5175631,37645139,2015-07-09,30879481,Jon,"We had a great time at Le Penthouse! We arrived pretty late in the day, but Jeremy made an effort to meet us and show us around in person even when we told him he didn't need to since it was so late in the day.  We loved the deck and being able to watch fireworks over Lake Union on July 4th (the reason we selected this listing!)

It has been unseasonably warm in Seattle, and Jeremy went out and bought an air conditioner for the unit without even waiting for us to say anything. It was installed and nice and cool upon our arrival. 

Everything about this place was what we were hoping for and we had a great time with our family during the week we stayed.  We would definitely choose to stay here again!"
5175631,37983790,2015-07-12,34197446,Ruth,Le Penthouse was exactly as pictured. We felt at home immediately. The location was great and the view spectacular. Our only regret was not meeting Jeremy in person. But Wendy was very nice and helpful.
5175631,38490933,2015-07-16,23710894,Meredith,Jeremy was a great host! He met us at the house and showed us around when we got there and answered all the questions we had. Later that night he even sent me some links describing some running trails I had asked about. He was very helpful and I would definitely stay again. The place was lovely and we loves Seattle! 
5175631,38998407,2015-07-20,22051497,Melody,"Le penthouse delivered all that it promised with breathtaking views of union lake! Very clean and we felt very welcomed by host Jeremy who left us breakfast items, coffee, and wine! AC in main bedroom was amazing and we would have died without it given the 99° heat wave Seattle had. Neighborhood is awesome, walking distance to Fremont neighborhood with great food and coffee. Short drive or bus ride to down town. Would definitely recommend! "
5175631,39608426,2015-07-25,31375849,James,"Le Penthouse is a great place to stay in Seattle. From the moment we arrived/departed from Seattle, Jeremy was very kind to check in on us. The view was amazing and it was very easy to reach Downtown Seattle. Jeremy made us felt at home and gave us lots of insight on the neighborhood and places to eat. The other 3 who were with me, it was their first experience with AirBnb and they loved it thanks to Jeremy. "
5175631,40441374,2015-07-31,29674548,Elaine,"Jeremy' house is very beautiful and clean, with great lake view in front of the house, Jeremy and his girl friend Wendy are so nice and helpful, just like old friends, we enjoyed the two days stay so much."
5175631,41730683,2015-08-09,16727539,Ken,"Jeremy's house from outside might look at bit sketchy at first, but the location and the interior makes up for it. Expect an old house with a very homey feel to it.

Everything is close by and very accessible, by walk, public transportation or car. Like everyone said, the view is spectacular. The place has everything ready for anyone to stay comfortably. You can simply show up with a luggage of clothes and be set.

Jeremy is an excellent host and made us feel very comfortable. He showed us around the apartment and gave us tips to go around town. Would recommend."
5175631,42394512,2015-08-13,34772637,Philip,Had a great stay at Jeremy's place. He was an excellent host and his place is super cool. The views of the lake were awesome.
5175631,42826044,2015-08-16,23230387,Ashley,"Jeremy was a wonderful host and very easy to communicate with! It was a beautiful view and everything we could've hoped for! He even left us a bottle of wine, card and gift to celebrate U.S. spending our wedding night there :) "
5175631,43755293,2015-08-22,32495055,Billy,We stayed here before our cruise. Jeremy was very accommodating.   Very close to bus stop.
5175631,45074469,2015-08-31,34912321,Lori,"There is really nothing more to add to Jeremy's praises ... all of the reviews are absolutely spot on.  A gorgeous apartment, bright and roomy with outdoor space, which is great for morning coffee. 

Jeremy texts throughout our stay to let us know about things going on in the area .... and was more than responsive prior to the trip and during.  

I would definitely stay here again.  "
5175631,45939720,2015-09-07,14760641,Jennifer,"Jeremy’s pad is such a gem, and he was a wonderful host. I had family visiting from out of town and needed to find a great place near Fremont for them to stay – Le Penthouse was just the ticket. Easy access to I-5 and Highway 99, reserved parking, great panoramic views, and everything you could possibly need. Jeremy showed me all the ropes upon check-in and even left us some breakfast foods and other goodies, and he was also available for any questions that came up during our stay. My visitors already can’t wait to come back again!"
5175631,53074610,2015-11-04,6534283,Andrew,Jeremy's place is great and Jeremy is a wonderful and considerate host. One indication of this is how he swiftly responded to a temporary problem we had with wi-fi. We are headed back to Seattle soon and may well stay at Jeremy's if his apartment is available.
5175631,56257397,2015-12-11,5446129,Darren,"Had a great time! This dwelling is located in a great area and has a great view. It is only a couple of minutes from the Space Needle and the Paul Allen Music Experience and only a few more minutes to downtown. There are very good restaurants, bars/pubs and grocery stores in the immediate vicinity. This is an older residential section of town with narrow streets. The only heads up I would give someone staying here is that traffic during morning/afternoon rush hours can be very hectic and should be avoided if you are renting a vehicle. 
Jeremy met us at our arrival and made us feel very welcome. I definitely recommend staying at Le Penthouse!"
7178490,41129765,2015-08-04,18004991,Hannah,"The Deluxe Studio Suite was the perfect accommodation for our getaway to Seattle. As we were traveling around the city by bike, it was the ideal location for us--close to the Burke-Gilman trail and situated between Ballard and downtown. Eve was out of town during our stay so was not there to greet us, but left detailed directions to the studio, a guest book with recommendations for food in the area (which were excellent) and had very sweetly stocked the refrigerator and counter with some delicious local snacks and beverages. 

The studio is essentially a converted basement apartment that is beautifully constructed and decorated. All furniture and appliances seemed to be brand new, and the design immaculate. Also, it is more of a split-level basement, so there is plenty of natural light. The entrance is through a lovely garden and a backyard that I am honestly very envious of. 

We were able to meet Eve and thank her for the time at her studio just before we left and continued our holidays in the San Juan Islands. She gave us suggestions for sights to see there, which were again excellent. Thanks again! "
7178490,41639288,2015-08-08,37619532,Sarah,Eve was a fantastic host! She introduced herself to us shortly after we arrived and gave us suggestions about places to eat and things to do in the area. The apartment was clean and absolutely lovely. She had even left some food and a few beverages for us. It was a great experience and the perfect place to stay in Seattle!
7178490,41986487,2015-08-10,7595868,Julie,"Excellent host, apartment, and phenomenal location! Would stay here again in a flash! "
7178490,42757450,2015-08-15,40234729,Christopher,We had a great time in Seattle. The place was great and the neighborhood was fantastic. There are great places to eat within two blocks and a corner market too. It was very easy to take a bus into downtown. We loved the long walk through the park over to Green Lake. 
7178490,44957200,2015-08-30,40309446,Steve,"This place was a mixed bag for my particular stay. The description is accurate, but we had some issues. Consider this a very subjective review.

The main thing was the spiders that strung webs across the walkway around the house all day every day. A couple of times we narrowly avoided huge spiderwebs in the face; every other time we cleared it out with a broom handle before trying to walk through. Six hours later there'd be another one. Yes, this is life in Planet Earth sometimes. But it was still not fun.

The mattress was (in my opinion) very firm, so I didn't sleep very well.

Other than those two things it's a nice place!

We got around mostly by bus. It seemed about as accessible as anywhere else in Seattle, in that you have to transfer downtown to get anywhere from anywhere. There is a bus stop nearby. There are also quite a few coffee/brunch/general food options within close walking distance."
7178490,46296430,2015-09-09,12778461,Francisco,"Eve's  deluxe estudio is a very nice place. And  I the best choice if you want to stay in Seattle, especially if you want to enjoy Fremont neighborhood.  The place is enough big for 2-3 people, decorated with care and have everything you should need to short or long stay. The bathroom that is not at the photos is very good and clean; the studio is at the basement of a history house, even you don't have a great view, it has a wonderful and well care garden that you can enjoy. The property is good located and close to a couple of very good restaurants, a small supermarket  and bus-stop. Totally recommended !!! "
7178490,48095533,2015-09-23,41897131,Lorrie,"Eve was there to meet us when we showed up with our bags, and had left detailed info on how to access the studio with me in case she wasn't.

The studio was beautiful and all the appliances/plumbing/furniture worked great. It smelled fresh and clean and was in a great location near multiple bus stops. Another reviewer thought the bed was a little firm, but we thought it was just right. We also did not have any spider walkway troubles.

We had a really great vacation staying in this studio and will probably do so again, if Eve lets us!"
7178490,48752050,2015-09-28,43009737,Fran,"Studio suite was better than advertised, more space than pictures showed, very clean.  Met with the owners when we checked in, nice friendly couple. She had extra food items that went beyond the normal welcome including fresh ice cubes in the freezer!
Even though it was a basement unit, it felt bright and homey and did not need any heat except in the morning.
Will definitely stay there again."
7178490,49459005,2015-10-04,7700104,Lucy,"Great location. Eve left clear instructions on how to enter/lockbox. Cute basement apartment, wifi worked well. Eve had purchased a few basic groceries- and I used them. Nice having eggs, goat cheese and milk for coffee. The bed was very comfy! 

Eve was very nice - met me soon after I checked in explaining that her husband was celebrating a birthday the second night of my stay so there would be some noise- I had dinner plans anyway so by the time I returned at 10:00 they were still going but it quieted by 10:30 so no harm. "
7178490,50459416,2015-10-12,41866489,Joe,"Awesome experience. Unit was clean, well kept, updated appliances, and easy to access. Great location, walking distances to great spots, central to everything. Eve was great, even left us some free food and drinks! Cannot recommend this spot more."
7178490,51804706,2015-10-24,14727812,Ellen,"My stay at Eve's place was great! It was very comfortable and had everything I could think of.  The kitchen was well stocked, which I really appreciated.  I stayed for almost two weeks and didn't have any problems.  I was in town for work so I was driving a lot and parking at night wasn't quite as easy as I'd hoped.  In the end, it was worth the trade for staying in such a great location and with a wonderful host!"
7178490,55275084,2015-11-29,3490931,Neil,"Eve's apartment is fantastic! She was very accommodating and communication was fast and easy. There was also a bunch of food left in the fridge, which was very welcome.

The apartment itself was very clean and felt spacious, and really had everything I needed. Will definitely stay again when I'm back in Seattle."
5405643,30234571,2015-04-19,19589688,Aleksandra,Great stay beautiful house perfect neighborhood! Had a great time :)
5405643,30532692,2015-04-23,22317212,Raphael,"Camille's and Andrew's house is a paradise. The patio has a great view, the kitchen is equipped with all what you wish for and the living room is huge and features a fireplace. A grocery store and the bus station can be reached within a 10-15min walk. A taxi to get into vibrating Seattle would cost maximum 20 USD. (There is space in front of their house, I guess you could park your car there.) Camille and Andrew live closed by, whenever you need something they are immedately at your place. The communication was a pleasure - before and during the stay. I highly recommend these lovely hosts and their place. "
5405643,30775142,2015-04-27,14659077,Emily,My friends and I had a great time in Seattle and loved our stay at Camille's place.

5405643,32995123,2015-05-24,1892108,Susan,"Camille was a very welcoming and generous host. This was our first trip to the area and we really loved Seattle. The house was comfortable, quiet, very clean and didn't lack a thing. The kitchen was fully equipped and she even brought fresh coffee for us! We enjoyed several meals on the back deck. I would highly recommend this place to others."
5405643,33361791,2015-05-27,727568,Hal,Camille was great.  She provided lots of information and suggestions regarding transportation options around Seattle.  House was clean and comfy and very convenient to Seattle Center and other areas.
5405643,33805168,2015-06-01,4444421,Erin,"My husband and I stayed here with another couple, and the house had plenty of room for all of us. The back porch has an amazing view and lots of comfy furniture - we really enjoyed spending time outside on the porch. Super cute neighborhood, and it was easy to take an uber around town to explore. "
5405643,34206653,2015-06-06,20520372,Shuyi (Jason),That's a great house. It is so cozy. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. It was a great pleasure staying there.

5405643,35541885,2015-06-20,10418380,Leia,"My friends and I couldn't have enjoyed our stay in Seattle more, and only wish that we had booked more time there! Although we didn't have a chance to meet Camille and Andrew, our hosts were incredibly welcoming, helpful, and responsive; and their home is lovely, comfortable, and in a simply wonderful neighborhood. Overall, we couldn't have asked for more, and are extremely appreciative that Camille and Andrew opened their home to us.  "
5405643,35783385,2015-06-22,25541428,Terry,"Camille made us feel very welcome. We appreciated the added hospitality of coffee and breakfast fixings. 

The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful and walking distance to several Seattle neighborhoods. "
5405643,35956133,2015-06-23,34873657,Ben,This was an awesome and very comfy home! We stopped here and immediately felt at home. Camille was super nice and I'd suggest staying with her to all of my friends!

5405643,37455726,2015-07-07,4758934,Julia,"Highly recommend staying here! Camille was very responsive and answered all the questions I had before our arrival. The house was very comfy and the kitchen was nicely stocked with utensils and appliances. The patio was awesome with nice furniture and we were able to BBQ with the grill. The bedrooms were all very clean and comfortable. (Note: The weekend we stayed here was extremely hot [high 80s-90s]. I know it typically does not get this hot but note that this place does not come with AC. It does come with fans for the bedrooms though!) Overall, really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend to everyone!"
5405643,38253111,2015-07-14,10923417,Brandon,Camille went out of her way to make us feel right at home. Her place is located in a picturesque neighborhood in Seattle's Queen Anne neighborhood.
5405643,38514758,2015-07-16,7464004,William,"Our group had a wonderful stay at Camille's home. Camille was responsive and very friendly, and the home was lovely, comfortable, and conveniently located."
5405643,38987496,2015-07-20,4592234,Bernadine,"This little house was everything it promised and MORE!  It was cozy.  The beds were very comfortable.  The kitchen had everything we could have wanted!  I made great use of the iron and ironing board, and each of us spied a book we found intriguing on the book shelves.  The house instructions were complete and appreciated.  There was parking right in front of the house.  The neighborhood was wonderful--But I do think the back deck was my absolute favorite part!  It was a great spot for the family to gather for dinner, or to trickle out in the morning with coffee.  Thank you so much for sharing your home."
5405643,39385264,2015-07-23,19001792,Bill,"This wonderful home was just perfect for our visit in Seattle.  My daughter and her husband and their young son stayed there with me.  Visiting on the spacious lani, (I'm from Hawaii where we call decks Lanis) making light meals, nice beds, great Queen Anne area.  I would surely stay here again.  "

5405643,42287539,2015-08-12,16455640,Laurie,We loved our stay at Camille's Comfy Queen Anne digs!  Everything was very clean and up to date. The kitchen was very well stocked and we appreciated the food she left us for breakfast - and the yummy chocolate toffee! The house was very spacious and we especially enjoyed the covered deck with beautiful views.  We would definitely come back and would highly recommend her place to our friends and family.  
5405643,42686860,2015-08-15,35728777,Esther,"This was the ideal place for our family of 6 to stay during our stay in Seattle. Enough beds for everyone, plus a fully equipped kitchen to help us save on some meal costs. The covered porch is another plus -- not only a great view but a very pleasant place to enjoy a meal or play games. Camille made us feel especially welcome with a bag of breakfast supplies from Trader Joes, and was always responsive when we texted with questions. Very easy access to the heart of the city from here, and Queen Anne neighborhood is safe and quaint. My kids were a bit disappointed when I told them we weren't staying in a hotel, but soon admitted this was so much better. We will be back!"
5405643,43497468,2015-08-20,14783823,Ayesha,Place was very comfortable and welcoming. Good view from the deck. Fit 5 people comfortably. Would definitely stay again.

5405643,44637111,2015-08-28,5708420,Adam,"This place was indeed comfy. In case we ran out, everything was fully stocked. We were in a nice quiet area 20-30 mins walking from Fremont which we loved. Be prepared for the hills though! Thanks Camille for being very accommodating!"
5405643,45065097,2015-08-31,28647254,Shadeh,Camille's home was wonderful! Its located in a great area and the home is so cozy and comfortable. Can't wait to visit Seattle and stay here again!! 
5405643,45937583,2015-09-07,35392037,Kirstin,"Camille and her husband were wonderful, gracious hosts!  Camille greeted us upon our arrival with some grocery staples so we did not have to immediately go shopping.  The first time we've met a host, who greeted us with food! The home was beautiful and pristine.  The deck was spectacular and all the beds were very comfortable, high quality matresses, the pillows and the bedding were super nice!  (A rarity from our experiences) 
We walked the hills in Queen Anne, great exercise and soooo beautiful and our friends we were visiting were very close by.  
We had a wonderful time and hope to return again next year.
Mark, Kirstin and Annabelle Lynch "
5405643,46501031,2015-09-11,6949029,Judith,"The stay was very pleasant.  The house is just as described in the listing and is a great value.  The neighborhood is very quiet, no through traffic and filled with families.  The deck is lovely.  We had great weather and enjoyed sitting outside everyday.  Lots of kitchen stuff which really facilitated cooking meals at the house.  The washer and dryer were very handy.  Camille was great.  She is responsive and very nice.  The info provided on places to visit in Seattle was very helpful.  Parking is right in front of the house.  Highly recommend these Queen Anne Digs."
5405643,46879270,2015-09-14,21898396,Catherine,"What a fantastic place!  This adorable 3 bedroom cottage is located in the Queen Anne district, a quiet neighborhood close to everything in Seattle and walking distance to Fremont.  Camille was incredibly thoughtful leaving delicious chocolate truffles but also staples such as bread, milk, orange juice, peanut butter and fresh fruit so that even if you arrived late you wouldn’t starve.  There is a lovely deck with comfortable furniture and a peek a boo view of Lake Union.  The beds are extremely comfortable and the whole place was so clean and cozy we could have stayed much longer.  Thanks so much for a lovely weekend.  "
5405643,47347652,2015-09-18,26725230,Christa,Very cute little house! Loved the patio! Thanks for everything.
5405643,47628785,2015-09-21,14482751,Christian,"Cozy upper floor. Beds were comfortable, welcoming living space in a very quiet neighborhood. Only a short drive away from Pike's Place. Camille was quick to let us in. All the necessities were covered which made for a relaxing vacation!"
5405643,48996524,2015-09-30,38669485,Pat,"Camille met us at the door and showed us around the house.  She answered our questions about where we could get a meal late in the evening and about public transportation ......overall she was very pleasant and helpful and went way above what we expected.  The kitchen was stocked with milk, bread, peanut butter and jam, spices, coffee, tea, and a few pieces of fruit....enough to tide us over until we got to the market.  This was a really nice touch.  The bathroom needs were all covered as well and this was nice as I forgot to bring my conditioner!  Seattle is a great city to visit and we did a lot of tourist things.  This area is close to the Seattle Pacific University and we felt safe walking around."
5405643,49234995,2015-10-02,42504832,Hannah Haewook,Everything was prrfect staying there. The comfy house was located in a very safe and beautiful neighborhood. Everything was prepared to feel a life like my house. Camile was kind and prompt to every single question I had. I definetely recommend this place to people who want to travel Seattle.
5405643,51303445,2015-10-19,42247560,Tamara,Camille's Place was super spacious and had all the amenities any family would need. The beds in all three rooms were super comfortable and included lovely down comforters. The hosts were super thoughtful and stocked the fridge and pantry with staples and extras at no charge. The area was perfect for us and centrally located to everything we needed. I totally recommend staying here.
5405643,51538837,2015-10-21,13495245,Gloria,"We loved this quaint little home. Camille provided some very homey touches, which I appreciated. She made certain that she had the refrigerator stocked with yogurt and cream for our coffee, for the morning. The pantry was well stocked with herbs and spices. It was wonderful to be able to shop, for fresh fish, at Pikes Market and then to come home and barbecue on the beautiful back deck. The view from the back deck was absolutely fabulous; and because it is a covered deck, we were able to enjoy it rain or shine."
5405643,52043529,2015-10-26,36053054,Shannon,"Camille allowed my guests and I to check-in a few hours early, which was extremely helpful - allowing us to drop off our luggage and begin exploring Seattle!  Camille provided a detailed list and maps of nearby recommendations as well as Seattle tourist destinations.  They even left snacks, breakfast items, and food for us to eat during our stay.  Camille really went above and beyond to ensure we had a wonderful stay in her home / trip to Seattle!   "
5405643,52518087,2015-10-30,45024627,Amir,"The house was great. Wasn't quite big but enough space with 3 bedrooms. The beds were comfortable too. The check in worked perfect since we arrived at 11pm. The best was that there were extra some drinks and breakfast things so you didn't need to find a shop straight away. The area was nice and quite and with a car very close to the city center and close to the motorway to go to parts of the city or airport. From airport it was about 20min, by day time about 30min and easy to find. Next time we will for sure book here again. "
5405643,52915764,2015-11-02,2061763,Marvin,"Loved the location, the hospitality, and the attention given. It was a pleasure staying in Camille's place! :)"
5405643,53515404,2015-11-09,206331,Yofred,Camille was a very friendly host and we will definitely stay over again! We felt very welcomed and the place was just right. Its a convenient location thats just a short drive to downtown.
5405643,54242441,2015-11-17,21932669,Barbara,"Loved our stay. The house was wonderfully equipped, the beds were very comfortable and Camille was thoughtful and attentive to our needs. We will definitely stay again!"
5405643,54472770,2015-11-20,4508600,Kathy,"So accommodating and lovely. Thank you for our stay! Can't beat the location, as well. "
5405643,56558713,2015-12-14,5480207,Emma,Camille's little place in Queen Anne was great. We rented it for two weekends while we were selling our house and needed to get out so our toddler and baby could nap at the right times! Camille was very accommodating for our specific needs. The location was also really good for me to get to work downtown. We'd definitely stay again if we needed to! Price was great too! Thanks Camille!
5405643,56881481,2015-12-19,1196989,Julie,"We live in the neighborhood and needed a place to stay during a bathroom remodel. Camille and Andrew's charming little house was ideal, providing all the comforts and convenience of home only a few blocks away, in a serene part of Queen Anne. We enjoyed the view, fireplace, well-stocked kitchen, comfy beds, original art, and interesting books. We look forward to returning the next time we need a break from contractor mess! Thanks so much."
5405643,57282362,2015-12-24,3422670,Laura,"Camille was absolutely amazing! Right after we booked she sent a welcome note and gave me her contact information. Then when the stay was getting closer she reached out again. Super responsive on AirBnB messenger and helped with many questions. 

We were staying right around the holidays and loved the decorations that made the house more cheerful! We rented a car but everything was easy to get to and the house had everything we needed. Thanks so much!"
5405643,57519583,2015-12-27,7034184,John,"The house is great for a family of 5 on a short visit to Seattle. The beds are very comfortable and everything worked -- except for the dishwashing machine. Or maybe we didn't know how to use it.
Anyway, it was an easy stay and a nice place"
6562393,37065400,2015-07-04,34320594,Donghui,I might be the first guest of this great place. Lucky me! It's in a quite area with short drive distance to almost all Seattle attractions. The house is even more beautiful than the pictures. Jeffrey is a great person willing to provide best hospitality to his guest. He is also provide very detailed instruction for his home. All the facilities are very good. 
6562393,37675450,2015-07-09,6340717,Zoe,"Excellent host, excellent house, excellent neighborhood. Every detail has been thought through. It really is an urban oasis."
6562393,39291235,2015-07-22,26928976,Caleb,My family and I had a very nice experience at Jeffrey's home in Queen Anne. The house was very nice with a great backyard area. The location was perfect as it is close to downtown Seattle but still has a nice quiet feel to it. 
6562393,41081343,2015-08-04,25706933,Nick,"Jeffrey's house was beautiful and in great condition.  It had an amazing, tranquil backyard.  Description and pictures of the house were accurate.  Jeffrey was super thoughtful in stocking the home with essentials and niceties for us to use.  He was very responsive to all of our questions."
6562393,44390394,2015-08-25,15825057,Max,"Four of us stayed here for three nights and it was fantastic. Jeffrey was very helpful and responsive throughout the entire process. The house is great, with a private backyard area, very comfortable beds and lots of space. The location is also excellent. We had never been to Seattle before, so we had to take a (semi-educated) guess at where in the city we wanted to stay and I'm glad we chose here. The neighborhood is quiet at night, it feels safe, and it's easy to hop on a bus to head anyhwere you want to go. I would stay here again for sure, and I highly recommend it."
6562393,44712780,2015-08-28,24049136,Jeff,"Jeffrey is a great host!  His home is very nice, clean, and comfortable!"
3497530,24005571,2014-12-16,5632413,Neil,Very nice place.  Many of the pictures are of the amenities which I honestly didn't get to experience so I cannot comment on.  But there is a 24h door man always there to greet and help which is nice when arriving late.  The neighbourhood is fantastic! Walking distance from the football game.  Great bars and restaurants all around.  Really an excellent location.  Check in was a little interesting since the owner was to email us 5 days prior with instructions to check in and I received no email.  So while driving from had to email and then call owner to get info. But after calling I did get info right away it just cost data and airtime. Check out was simple and uneventful with doorman. Parking wasn't cheap around there and this unit didn't mention any offers of parking.  So may want to add about $20-40 for the cost of parking overnight depending on how often you will move your car.  Street parking works fine if you're willing to wake up and move it to avoid tickets etc.  That was free overnight I believe.
1003890,4342290,2013-04-29,2828868,Jessica,"Staying at Rob & Lori's was wonderful! Not only was the house perfect for us in size and cleanliness, but it was in an amazing neighborhood, close to anything that might be needed. Only we didn't need anything! Rob & Lori had the house generously stocked and ready for guests to have a long and home-like stay. We are already planning when we can stay again! No more stuffy & cold hotel rooms for us when we travel to Seattle! Thanks so much, Rob & Lori, you are sweet, helpful, and gracious hosts who we are blessed to have come across in our travels. We appreciate you! Jessie"
1003890,6553436,2013-08-17,5666293,Nathalie,"Our stay at Lori& Rob's home was excellent. The accommodations exceeded our expectations. Lori and Rob were always quick to respond to any questions and provided anything that could possibly be needed for a comfortable stay, and more. They are very nice and accommodating. The house has anything you need for a short or long stay and is in great condition. Everything was clean and comfortable. The location of the house was only a 10-15 minute car ride to downtown and a 20 minute bus ride. Great location and great people! Thank you Lori and Rob!! "
1003890,6625815,2013-08-19,4274720,C Michael,"Recently remodeled, very clean and clutter free."

1003890,6899318,2013-08-29,7991483,Kathy,"My friends and I stayed at Rob & Lori's house in August.  Rob is very responsive and accomodating from the time of booking to the last day of our stay.  The house is exactly as seen in the pictures.  Very modern, very clean, and spacious.  It was fully stocked with goodies that Rob insisted that we enjoy.  The fridge was stocked with bottled water, which was great for our hikes and tours around the city.  The bathroom was stocked with clean fluffy towels.  Everything you could possibly need was in the house.  And it was very close to everything, Alki Beach and downtown Seattle.  It was truely home away from home.  After a day in the city, it was nice to come home to a quiet, clean, relaxing house.  Thank you Rob, I will definitely contact you for our next visit to Seattle!"
1003890,7007305,2013-09-03,6625438,Vicky,"This is the first time I've ever done vacation rental and Rob and Lori definitely made this experience a breeze for me. Very accommodating on my request for early check in, the place is very clean, well furnished with the fridge stocked with some essentials and goodies in the shelves. Kitchen is well equipped for cooking and the whole set up of the house was well thought out.
My friends that also stayed wished there was wifi, but other than that it was fast to get to downtown and the grocery store was easily accessible. I was very impressed!

Thank you again Rob and Lori for your lovely home, will definitely stay again in the future!"
1003890,7142794,2013-09-08,862329,Prez & Cherie,"5 Star stay, this place is very nice. Our hosts were wonderful it was a true home away from home, to be host better then home. Great neighborhood safe and next to a mini mall complex with shops and grocery store, short drive to Alki which is a incredible water front. The place had everything we needed and a huge yard with plenty of parking we highly recommend this place. "
1003890,7402804,2013-09-18,4671158,Parnaz,"Rob is amazing.  He has thought out EVERY detail in making his guests comfortable.  Really.  Every detail.  From emergency frozen pizza to bottled water to flashlights.  It is heartwarming to see someone put so much effort in hospitality.  And, the house is spotless.  I don't let me little one crawl on just any floor.  This home was cleaner than my own."
1003890,7752770,2013-10-01,8728487,Danielle,"There is not enough great things I can say about our stay at Rob and Lori's wonderful home! It was the cleanest vacation home I have ever stayed in! Communication with the hosts was top notch. Rob was very quick to respond to any questions I had for him. A wonderful little touch they had available at the house was some goodies stocked in the kitchen upon arrival. I have never had that done for me before. The home is so cozy and inviting, it smells like fresh laundry! The location is PERFECT! It was a quick 10 minute drive into downtown, but far enough away so you didn't get all the noise. We really enjoyed going to Luna Park Cafe for breakfast a couple miles down the road. I highly recommend stoping by there, wonderful history. Tacos at Marination on Alki beach are amazing, they are Hawaiian/Korean fusion. You can eat outside with a wonderful view of the city. 

All in all, Seattle is a beautiful place. It was my first time there, and I'm happy to say I will definitely be returning! When I do, I will be booking Rob and Lori's home again! Thank you so much to Rob and Lori for making Seattle such a wonderful time!

1003890,8146590,2013-10-17,6325004,Dan,"Great place, very clean and accommodating. It was nice to have a few essentials in the fridge as well. Highly recommend staying here!
"
1003890,8337313,2013-10-26,279315,Valentina & Jeremy,great stay.  would recommend to anyone.
1003890,8849132,2013-11-21,9360153,Janice,"I stayed in Seattle for about a week and this beautiful home made it all worth it.  If I'm in town again, I will definitely book with Rob and Lori. "
1003890,9026095,2013-12-02,9614534,Allen,"You get exactly what's on the pictures. 3 bedrooms with double beds, a decent sized living room and a kitchen/dining room with everything you need (I know as we actually cooked one meal there). Rob responded to all our questions and requests timely and made arrangement for our late check-in. There're refreshments in the fridge when we arrived which was really considerate. You need to commute a little bit to get to downtown places but all in all a great place to stay. I would recommend Lori & Rob's to anyone going to Seattle. "
1003890,9317976,2013-12-21,3742272,Natasha,Rob is a wonderful host. The house is very clean and new. They have everything that we need. We enjoyed our stay at the house and we are definitely going to come back again. Thanks Rob for a great hospitality! 
1003890,9543275,2014-01-02,2167450,Daniel,Overall our stay was great at Lori & Rob's place. When we first got there we had a little issue with the central heat but Rob was very quick to respond and fix the issue. The neighborhood the house is located in is very quiet and its close to a nice shopping center where you can get anything you need. I would highly recommend their place if you're looking for a comfortable place to stay while you're in Seattle. Thanks for having us.
1003890,9969419,2014-01-21,8593679,Andrea,Overall our stay at Rob & Lori's place was great! Rob was responsive to my questions right away and provided us clear instructions on checking in. He was accommodating to our early arrival. Their home was was very clean and welcoming when we arrived. It had everything we needed including refreshments and a huge candy bowl! It's close to downtown Seattle and with the help of GPS we were able to find our way around easily from their home. The central heating system seemed to be acting up but it was nice that each bedroom was provided with a heater to use. I appreciate airbnb hosts who make the process easy and comfortable and Rob and Lori definitely do that. Thank you!
1003890,10569662,2014-02-25,1266078,Sarah,"Lori & Rob's house was perfect for my family's stay in Seattle.  The images convey exactly what to expect, and the kitchen was more than well-stocked.  Communication was clear and easy.  Off-street parking was so convenient, as was the overall location. Thank you for providing such a great place to stay in Seattle. "
1003890,10661242,2014-03-02,4732578,Layla,"We had a very pleasant stay at Rob and Lori's home while in Seattle for work. It was a clean, quiet, comfortable home to come to after a long work day. Rob was quick to reply to questions and payed extra attention to details to make our stay more enjoyable. Thank you Rob and Lori!"
1003890,11971610,2014-04-20,583956,Lana,We had a great time staying at Rob's house. We are glad that we booked this BnB rather than three hotel rooms. This house is cleaner than a hotel and it is just 15 minutes drive from downtown. Rob is very responsive to my messages and we would recommend this BnB to our friends.
1003890,12166012,2014-04-24,14255182,Wei,We loved staying at Lori and Rob's place - they were very accommodating and our experience was better than we expected - def we would love to go back next time we are in Seattle
1003890,12354811,2014-04-29,2555765,Roman,"The house is nice and clean. A little small but you get what you pay for :)
Location is ok, though you have to drive 2.5 miles to the nearest freeway, but then you're near everything. 

And airport is really close!"
1003890,13563148,2014-05-31,963428,Geoff,"We were only in Rob's place for one night, but it was a good spot to call home for the day. With four adults, having three bedrooms was great and the place was nice. It's such a little thing, but a stocked fridge with soda and water was a nice touch. We never met Rob, but he was really easy to communicate with, both pre and during our stay. "
1003890,13827690,2014-06-05,15461079,Dominik,"Perfect location between airport and downtown Seattle. Great comfortable house with all the amenities. 

Everything worked perfectly despite missed flight connections. "
1003890,13898842,2014-06-07,16185267,Rhyen,"Rob was a great host. Communication was quick, the house was clean, check -in was easy and well-coordinated. We love the no shoes policy, as we have a young one crawling around. Thanks again."
1003890,14272437,2014-06-16,9274258,Amy,"Everything is as described!  Lori and Rob are very considerate to prepare us with enough drinks and towels during our 5-days stay.  We used the kitchen a lot in preparing seafood got from the public market which is a plus in our Seattle trip. Location might be the only down side of this place - we are traveling to University District quite often so the location is bit too far and traffic around downtown is really bad,  but if you are as a visitor to Seattle, this place is in in the middle of everything you will be visiting!"
1003890,14828524,2014-06-27,15872252,Kathy,"Nice size home that was clean and well stocked for guests.  Sheets and towels were extra nice!  Kitchen had all you would want for cooking and eating (blender, toaster, coffee maker, etc).  They had coffee and tea and even cold drinks on hand for us.  It was close to airport for our journey the next day.  Owner was very responsive and helpful.  I would definitely go there again.  "
1003890,14988665,2014-06-30,16553525,Ricky,"The house was exactly as the hosts described it: well-equipped with all the basic appliances and furniture you'd expect in a home. I would also add that it was very clean and tastefully-decorated. It was a great place to just relax after a long day out in Seattle.

Rob was the contact for this rental and he was very quick to respond to all of the messages I sent him from the very beginning. He was a courteous and unintrusive host. He even included a nice extra for the rental: water and soda in the fridge.

I would not hesitate to stay here again."
1003890,15748612,2014-07-15,13130814,Bernadette,Prima huis in Seattle West. Heel netjes en schoon. Meer dan voldoende handdoeken. Drankjes stonden voor ons klaar. Bus naar downtown gaat op de hoek. Buurt voelde veilig. Supermarkt niet ver. California street ook vlakbij en daar zijn veel restaurantjes en winkels. Strandje in de buurt. 
1003890,16667162,2014-07-31,15027914,Linda,"We had the most wonderful Seattle experience!  How nice to have a real home to come back to in the evening.  Also, it was great having a washer and dryer to take care of our clothes and made unpacking so much easier.  Rob and Lori welcomed us with a fridge of assorted non-alcoholic beverages including water.  Their home was exceptionally clean and organized.  If you are planning a trip to Seattle and need a home base to come back to after long days of sight-seeing and exploring, this may be the place for you.  "
1003890,18162533,2014-08-23,13264881,Lauren,Home was nice and clean and had everything needed. Rob was easy to work with and was responsive. Will definitely stay again. 
1003890,18473660,2014-08-27,16929283,Rosa,"The house was very clean and well taken care of. Having little children I felt comfortable with them playing on the floor. Great host. Lots of little details from soda to water ect. House looks like the picture. 
"
1003890,19041483,2014-09-05,19984759,Kelly,"This was a wonderful place to stay! The house was exactly as described and in great condition. It was very clean (I felt very comfortable letting my 1-year old crawl on the floor) and not cluttered. Rob was easy to communicate with...quick to respond via text and email. A few little ""extras"" like bottled water, soda, and coffee made it feel very welcome. The kitchen is fully stocked. The house is in a cute neighborhood of West Seattle, perfect for walking around and close to coffee, restaurants, grocery stores, etc. Easy access to freeway made it great to travel into downtown or to the waterfront. We will definitely recommend this place and would love to return if we are back in Seattle. "
1003890,19124771,2014-09-07,17270534,Austin,The host was very communicative making the stay very easy on us.  The listing was exactly as mentioned and even had great little things like drinks in the fridge and towels
1003890,19690892,2014-09-16,8314378,Tina,Everything was great.  Rob was super easy to work with and always responded very quickly to our questions.  The location was easy to access and not far from downtown or the airport.
1003890,20336767,2014-09-28,11247027,Cheryl,"Lori and Rob are wonderful hosts.  We arrived late Friday and found water and soft drinks in the refrigerator.  Check in was a breeze - there was a key in a lock box and Rob provided us with the code.  

The neighborhood is quiet but a little further from downtown Seattle than we expected.  The house is wonderfully decorated with comfortable beds and plenty of towels.  The kitchen is fully stocked for preparing even the most elaborate of cuisine.

I would highly recommend staying with at Lori and Rob's home.  It was a pleasure.  We communicated by email and Rob and Lori were very responsive.

Cheryl Richardson"
1003890,20777585,2014-10-05,18586617,Alyssa,"The house was exactly as pictured and clean as a whistle! We had everything we needed and the kitchen was very well equipped for dinning in. Even the neighborhood was cute, and it's close to shopping and tourist attractions. The off-street parking is the bee's knees! Street parking was hard to come by, so knowing we had a parking space was a relief!
Rob gave us very clear instructions for getting to the house and then getting into the house. 
I would definitely stay there again, especially if I had a larger group."
1003890,21100793,2014-10-11,2279923,Angela,"Lori & Rob were great hosts! Even though we didn't get to meet them in person due to our later check in time, they still made us feel welcome by checking in with us through texts. The place was super clean and beverages were also provided for us. Lori & Rob maintained great communication with us and made our stay super easy. I really recommend staying here if you ever visit Seattle! "
1003890,21357112,2014-10-15,20991440,Justin,Easy check in. Very nice accommodations. Great location between the airport and downtown. Rob communicated well and addressed needs immediately.  Thank you Rob!
1003890,21521334,2014-10-19,21108807,Frank,"The description was very accurate and we felt very welcome in the home.  We were greeted with a fridge full of beverages that pretty much lasted our entire stay.  We were able to use public transit very easily and the neighborhood was very nice.  Lori and Rob thought of everything including a Power Strip in a drawer in the kitchen because there are not a ton of outlets in the living room.  This was perfect for being able to charge all of the various devices we own.  Also, he had a tool kit and a first aid kit and it was very nice to know it was available.  We did not need them but all of the rooms even have their own space heaters for increased comfort which was a very nice touch.  This home was perfect for what we needed and it is so easy to get to Downtown Seattle and all of the attractions."
1003890,22612317,2014-11-10,4194603,Mackenzie,"Rob was very communicative, the house was clean and comfortable. Everything was as described and there were nice extra touches like canned soda and bottled water in the fridge! We had a lovely stay, the only thing was the only grocery store close by closes at 4pm on the weekends and we had a terrible time trying to find anywhere else to grab some groceries! "
1003890,23149049,2014-11-24,18205911,Melissa,"Our stay in the home was very pleasant. The house was well stocked and very clean. The beds were also comfortable as well as the living room furniture, we had plenty of room for the 4 of us in this home. Lori & Rob were great to work with and always quick to respond to any questions that we had. There is plenty of off street parking available in drive way which is surrounded by a tall fenced yard. The only down fall to this home is that the TV is on an antenna so it doesn't work well when the weather is bad which was the case for our stay. The location is great with access to lots of great restaurants and bars within a short driving distance and there are grocery stores near by. Overall we enjoyed our stay at this property and would rent it again for future visits."
1003890,25415746,2015-01-15,22333608,Rachel,"I stayed at this home for 3 nights and it was very pleasant, the home is conveniently located between the airport and downtown and very easy to find. There is also a large gravel driveway which seemed large enough for four cars – no need for street parking! I primarily communicated with Rob, who was very quick to respond, and check-in was easy as it was through a lock box. The house is exactly as pictured and well stocked, I was pleasantly surprised to find a large amount of extra linens and towels as well as an ironing board and blow dryer. The bedrooms each have one electrical outlet; however there are extension cords provided. There was also ample space in each closet to unpack your clothes into. I would definitely stay here again."
1003890,28563221,2015-03-26,12436264,Yicheng,Great apartment!! Great neighborhood!! This place is very homie. Host literally provide everything! It's a great experience for us to live in the apartment rather than living in the hotel. 
1003890,28782301,2015-03-30,5760726,Holly,Lori & Rob communicated fast to text and to email messages. The house was nice and clean and they had drinks in the fridge which was nice. Area was decent and there was shopping nearby. Overall it was a good place.
1003890,31877493,2015-05-11,23950925,Krista,"We loved our stay at Lori and Rob's place!  It was clean and bright.  The kitchen was well supplied with cooking accessories, etc.  There was plenty of everything we could need.  Sadly, we never got to meet our hosts, but Rob was very helpful and friendly when it came to check in, etc.  He also checked on us mid-stay via text to make sure all was okay, which was incredibly considerate and appreciated.  The location was great - we rented a car and never had any trouble getting in and out of downtown.  Highly recommended!"
1003890,32869138,2015-05-22,4375551,Tracy,It's a very clean and neat house. It's located in a very nice neighborhood. It only take less than 30 min to downtown. I'd love to come back again.
1003890,34767532,2015-06-12,28552775,Rozen,"Rob was very quick to answer any questions we may have had. The home is lovely, nicely decorated and clean.  Our stay in the house was wonderful. We were suppose to have my aunt's family stay with us too but her husband basically refused to sleep there because of the lack of air conditioning.  With the windows opened it fixed the problem, so we ended up having a nice stay.  We enjoyed our stay. My children loved running around the home.  The home is very family friendly and close to a lot of things. "
1003890,35552395,2015-06-20,16792751,Ali,Exactly as described. Extremely clean. Easy entry. Set up well for what it's used for. Very accommodating: we missed our connecting flight and arrived later than expected. We had three couples fit comfortably. Would stay here again!
1003890,36271700,2015-06-27,532925,Kok Huat,Had a great stay at Rob's house. Rob was helpful and provided three fans and bottled water in the fridge to help us cope with the unusually hot weather on our stay. House cooled down quickly at nite with the windows open. Nice quiet neighborhood. House was very clean and all was as expected.  Highly recommend and would stay again in the future. 
1003890,36938373,2015-07-03,23265924,Evan,"This was a lovely, clean home in West Seattle. Rob was extremely attentive and quick to communicate. The home had everything we needed including plenty of towels. Great home and great hosts!"
1003890,37727447,2015-07-10,23334139,MarkandSusan,"What a great location!  Just a short drive into Seattle.  If you have teens/kids or just like working-out, there is an amazing public sports complex just 2 minutes up the road... We had two teens and each morning I got them up and we ran to the track, did a workout and practiced soccer drills.  Right next to the sports complex is a shopping center with everything you could need... a market, coffee, drug store, Target, etc...  It couldn't be more convenient!  The house itself is super clean.  There is only one bathroom, but we had 6 of us and it worked just fine.  Rob & Lori provide a ton of towels!  There are three nice bedrooms.  We cooked in several nights and the kitchen has everything you'll need... pots & pans, cooking utensils, etc...   There is a fenced in yard and the neighbors were quiet and friendly.  Very safe for early morning walks.  As I said, we ran to and from the sports fields each morning at 5:30am.  There is wireless internet provided which made the teens very happy, a TV in the living room.  To be honest, we spent most of our time touring and sightseeing, but it was very nice to pull into the driveway each evening and have such a super place to stay.  Next time we're in Seattle, we will definitely stay at Lori & Rob's place again!"
1003890,37972278,2015-07-12,25315280,Cecile,Lori and Rob's place is a good choice if you're looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle. It's in a good location - about a 15 min drive from downtown. The only thing is that the bathroom does not have a fan. This can be remedied by opening the window; however it's kind of low so people might be able to see you if they walk by.
1003890,38687807,2015-07-18,1805689,Nuny,"Lori and Rob's house was very spacious, clean, and beautiful. It's very centrally located between the airport and downtown Seattle.  By car, it took us between 15-20 mins to get to the city.  The house itself has all the amenities one could want.  It was nice to come back and comfortably relax after a busy day of sightseeing. We would not hesitate to stay here again in the future."
1003890,39274358,2015-07-22,13950638,Justin,"The house overall was clean. Admittedly we had unseasonably hot weather in Seattle during our stay here. Most places in Seattle don't have AC which normally isn't an issue because of the cool summers. However, the issue with the house is there are only three floor fans to circulate the air for the entire home, and some of the windows don't have screens on them. This makes for a problem when you leave the house and close the windows for security and peace of mind, but then come back to a hot house that takes a bit to cool down. Only a slight inconvenience when it is REALLY hot outside. 

We would have loved to see outdoor furniture in order to take advantage of the great size of the backyard. As well as a fan in the bathroom so that you don't have to open the window which is viewing level to the street as you get out of the shower. 

Rob has done an awesome job of providing a great amount of towels for the guests! Overall the area and house were quiet and conveniently located to grocery stores, target and many of the city's best spots!  "
1003890,39607830,2015-07-25,27410696,John,"Neighborhood was ok, transitional and quite close to things needed.  Directly on a bus route.  Also a short Uber ride to downtown.  Good location."
1003890,40419215,2015-07-31,25913163,Marilyn,"The property was exactly as decribed. We were a family of four and it worked well for us.The location was fantastic. It was 15 minutes to downtown. A 5 minute drive to the mall with a grocery, target, rite-aid, Barnes &Noble and more. The weather  was super hot in Seattle for our stay. Luckily it  cools off at night with windows open and the fans provided by our host. We'll be back to stay again if we are in the Seattle area again. Thank You!"
1003890,41577866,2015-08-08,29066643,Nancy,Right in the middle of SEA airport and downtown Seattle. Nice house but has only one bathroom in the house. The house is warm since it has been a warmer summer than usual. 
1003890,41971485,2015-08-10,35313205,Yichen,The house was so clean and lovely. It has everything you need but only the bathing needs you need to carry with ya. My kids enjoyed running around in the house. We all had a great time there. Rob and Lori were super helpful.
1003890,43477299,2015-08-20,21743242,Angelica,"Super clean house, well supplied, with large parking space. No AC made it very uncomfortable at night. 
Host was prompt to respond to any inquiries. I would stay again, not in the hot summer though. "
1003890,43835221,2015-08-22,22156517,Greg,"Very nice comfortable space. Easy check-in and check-out. There was no AC which usually wouldn't be a problem in Seattle, but it got a little hot inside in mid-August, but opening windows at night and using the fan worked just fine. The property is walking distance from a 7-Eleven which was great, too. The TV reception was a bit spotty, but I wasn't there to watch the tube anyway. The property is also very close to West Seattle which had some great breakfast places!"
1003890,45461065,2015-09-03,25473065,Marcus,"It was a really nice stay. The house was clean, comfortable and spacious. Rob and Lori were perfect in communication and preparation. Really fast answers and always friendly and helpful. We had a great stay in wonderful Seattle. Thanks to Rob and Lori!"
1003890,45926731,2015-09-07,31736711,Brenda,Lori and Rob's home was in a perfect location for our busy weekend!  The Westwood Plaza had every store that would meet your needs and it was in walking distance.  It also had a 24 Fitness and a park nearby.  Their home was very comfortable and suited our needs perfectly.  The only hard part was having one bathroom for the three couples but we made it work.  Thank you Lori and Rob.
1003890,46685461,2015-09-12,16240610,Clem,"Although we did not see or meet the hosts, their house was in order and everything neat and clean."
1003890,48136267,2015-09-23,12394750,Chad,Great! Everything was perfect!!
1003890,48330411,2015-09-25,33311372,Lori,We flew into Seattle in the late afternoon and had an easy drive to the house. It was ideally located between the airport and the city. Rob was a great help texting me and being sure that we got settled into the house. The house was clean and comfortable. I recommend this home in the Seattle suburbs to the weary traveller.
1003890,49815582,2015-10-06,386827,Qiuyue,The house was very clean and comfortable. Rob sent self check-in instructions before we arrived and the process was easy and hassle-free. We were a party of 5 and had a wonderful time in Seattle. The boys loved the mariners game! The location of the house was very convenient. I got my coffee at a nearby Starbucks and shopped at a Safeway for breakfast items. It's 15 minutes drive from downtown attractions such as the pike place market and the space needle.  Overall we had a wonderful stay. I highly recommend it.
1003890,50543615,2015-10-12,45368084,Trisha,my coworkers had a great time
1003890,51169094,2015-10-18,44759521,Yanci,I felt welcomed and was accommodated as needed. Very clean and spacious home. If I am ever in the area I plan to come back here again :)

1003890,53309961,2015-11-07,38489664,Dominic,"Plenty of info before we got to the listing, bus stop just next door, plenty of of space and great beds! Little bit further from Downtown than we thought but it was great that there was information pack about Seattle and the local area. Very clean and plenty of space. And having some coffee and bottled water in the house was really very good"

7382303,40063899,2015-07-27,39472619,Tyler,"Grapevine Cottage will not be a secret for long!  A fantastic getaway spot that was better then the pictures, was in the midst of a fantastic historic neighborhood (all million dollar plus houses) and provided all the nuanced delights of Seattle (lush scenery and a lake view).. a short walk through a forest trail that ended in coffee and oven baked pizza!.. and that same walk allowed quick access to downtown and the light rail.  Jon and Claudia were the perfect hosts... allowing a great balance of privacy and help/tips whenever needed.  The cottage has it's own entrance of the back road so it allows total privacy coming in in and out as well as a modern but cozy interior.  Will be recommending this to all my family and friends and again my little family couldn't have been more happy.  In bullet point form  ...

 - Modern yet Cozy interior.  Living Room/Kitchen/Bedroom expertly designed.  (better than the photos)
-  Hosts very accommodating and perfect balance of privacy and assistance.
-  Great location for small family and/or romantic retreat.
-  Walkable, upscale historic neighborhood.
-  3 minute walk to great coffee, wine, and wood fire baked pizza!
-  Lake View and awesome patio for lounging.
-  Same 3-5 minute walk gives access to buss to downtown, light rail, beach on the lake, and parks.
-  Access to washer/drier.
-  Hosts gave great tips for activities and helped out with concert tickets/ ideas where to go!

As much fun as it was to explore Seattle was even more exited to come each night to our little cottage!  Again had a great stay and can't wait to come back... had a hard time getting my family to go!"
7382303,40528549,2015-07-31,16640711,Charlie,"Jon and Claudia made us feel very welcome. The communication on our day of arrival was very good. The apartment was beautiful; almost new, very comfortable. We spent some time sitting on their front porch, taking in the view and talking with them about music; both Jon and I are music-oriented and know numerous people in common. The views from the home and surrounding area are astounding! We also noticed that despite being in the city, it was very quiet there after bedtime. We hardly heard any traffic or other city noises at all. "
7382303,41009727,2015-08-03,15790547,Dennis,"We had such a great time staying at Grapevine Cottage! The drive up to their home is stunning, overlooking Lake Washington. Jon & Claudia were such gracious hosts, we felt truly spoiled for the weekend. It happened to be Seafair weekend & Jon invited us to join them to watch the air show from their front porch. What a view!
From the first communication to checking out, there was great communication. The guest house is immaculate, decorated beautifully, flowers, wine, super comfortable bed. 
Jon gave a great recommendation for dinner at Mio Pasto which was great. We felt spoiled.
We are hosts on AirBnb & rent our home in Portland and have never rented before this trip. We were thrilled at our choice!"
7382303,41471792,2015-08-07,75128,Kiea,"Jon's place was very clean, with a great view of lake Washington in a quiet neighborhood near beach access. Made a great breakfast in the quaint kitchen. We would stay again"
7382303,41485851,2015-08-07,5588317,Joe,This was without a doubt one of the nicest Airbnbs I have stayed in--thank you for being such wonderful hosts!
7382303,42029401,2015-08-10,32495968,Pete,"We had an amazing weekend at the cottage! The place was in exquisite shape, the views were incredible, and it was nice to have a little seclusion in the midst of the big city. Absolutely top notch and will definitely look to book it again on our next trip to Seattle."
7382303,42449175,2015-08-13,39709362,Warren,Grapevine Cottage is amazing! The space is perfect for two adults or two adults and a child. The owners are very accommodating and friendly. 
7382303,42738686,2015-08-15,18608589,Jen,"My husband and I stayed here on a 2 day getaway and we were very impressed with it! Jon and his wife were very accommodating and welcomed us when we first arrived. 
We were surprised to find a bottle of wine waiting for us and as well as a number of goodies like GF pancake and brownie mix. The kitchen stocked with all the necessary tools to make meals (with my allergies that was a blessing). The space is very well designed and put together - it looked brand new and felt very clean. 
The location is in Southern Seattle but near all the main roads so getting across town wasn't hard or stressful. Little features like a view of the water from the balcony, soft clean sheets and treats in the kitchen made our trip as restful as we needed. "
7382303,43188367,2015-08-17,31620905,Lauren,This was an incredible weekend! I cannot even explain how beautiful this place was! Wonderful and welcoming hosts! Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a getaway! Enjoyed ourselves fully!! We never wanted to leave! 
7382303,43665635,2015-08-21,12999297,Maureen,"Jon, our host, greeted us and showed us around the cottage and explained everything to us that we needed to know.  The cottage was cozy and the view of the lake was awesome.  Jon and his wife left some breakfast food for us so we didn't have to run out in the morning.
When we are back in Seattle we will make sure we stay at the Grapevine Cottage."
7382303,44172414,2015-08-24,1772485,Miko,"Grapevine Cottage is a gorgeous little cottage with all the amenities you need, and located in a beautiful area of town (right by the beach and a great park/playground), which is also very close to downtown Seattle. We loved staying here, and our hosts were very accommodating, and Jon even invited my husband out to a show since it turns out they share a love of music. We loved the modern decor, and the view from the deck!"
7382303,44863028,2015-08-29,9842480,Sharon,"Jon's place is a wonderful retreat. Beautifully furnished, clean and well stocked. Orange juice, coffee and dessert awaited our arrival.
I highly recommend this hidden gem. The photos don't do the place justice... It is even more gorgeous in person. "
7382303,45290970,2015-09-01,2782546,Nick,"Absolutely wonderful place!  Quiet, secluded, and very comfortable.  Jon was a great and helpful host, and I would definitely stay here again."
7382303,46154909,2015-09-08,35611437,Alberto,"Claudia and Jon are two wonderful people. The grapevine cottage is simply amazing and perfect for who need to stay in Seattle, but in an oasis of tranquillity. 
Me and my girlfriend spent 4 days at the the cottage and everything was adorable: the kitchen is complete with all the things you need, the house is very quiet and super clean and the neghibor are silent.

The neighborhood is perfect for walk on the riverside of Washington lake and the pizzeria Mioposto (close to the house) is a perfect place for a great dinner.

Once again I want to say thank you to Jon and Claudia for their hospitality."
7382303,46450478,2015-09-10,41463161,Mehmet,"Unique property, very well thought of and recently built. a lot of attention to detail. Very clean and comfortable. Great view and location. Jon was very helpful and welcoming as a host. "
7382303,46750311,2015-09-13,41175058,Ail,Great location and accommodations. Jon is a fantastic host. Will certainly try and stay there again on my next trip out to Seattle.
7382303,47114671,2015-09-15,43368802,Evan,"The Grapevine cottage experience was perfect. It fits it's web-page description. The neighborhood is lovely and worked perfectly for my stay. The hosts are present, yet separate in their main house and quite responsive. They even welcome guests with a nice bottle of wine for their stay! I mistakenly left a drawer full of clothes and Jon mailed them back to me within 24 hrs of inquiring. I will definitely stay there again!!"
7382303,48460746,2015-09-26,6905437,Bhagavan,"I lived in Seattle for a long time. 8 years. Left it in 2010, came back after 5 years for this 7 day business trip. Even for an old timer like me, this place was new and felt like I was in a far away new land. All because of this little cottage and Jon's attention to details. He is caring and honest. Absolutely accurate in describing his offering. 

1. The bed is awesome. Plenty of clean pillows and sheets. The 2nd sofabed as well (it is not a cheap type). I was so confident of its quality, I did not feel guilty to offer it to my colleague :) as I took possession of the luxurious queen bed. The bedroom has no door, it is an open type plan as described by Jon
2. The kitchen is super functional with all new equipment. Supplies are reasonable and of high quality.
3. Bathroom is large and with luxurious supplies
4. The view from the balcony is pleasing. In the pictures it looks duller but in reality it is satisfying. It is not a full frontal exposure to the lake. But, quite a good one that looks deep into the hills on the other side. Mornings are a bliss (if you are there in summer. Seattle is grey in Fall).
5. The neighborhood is very calm and safe. Although the roads are very narrow and you should pay attention. But the traffic is virtually nonexistent. There are no stop signs in some critical corners and you must watch out. The cottage has perfect parking even though the neighborhood is hilly and well inhabited.
6. Lake is very nearby, but we could not go due to our terrible work schedule. However, we did drive by and it is an excellent beach. There are many parks nearby.
7. Access to downtown is superb. Just a few miles.
8. We did not watch a single show, but the TV is HD and top class. There is a disc player for movies.
9. Jon responds via SMS well (if not instant). I respect his service oriented mentality. (I had a bad experience in Airbnb before)

I am a fickle and restless person. I am surprised I cannot list one negative thing here. For what we paid and what we got in return, we are absolutely satisfied."
7382303,49866274,2015-10-06,33571357,Jack,"This was easily one of the loveliest listings I have ever come upon. Jon was very helpful even though I contacted him the day of that I was hoping to stay there, and when I arrived, even with the late notice, everything looked great and Jon was right there to greet us. The place is awesome. It was just redone, so it looks very clean, modern and spacious. The location was also awesome and we loved the view of the water! We had a lovely stay and would definitely stay here again!"
7382303,51222514,2015-10-18,16133156,Lorenz & Barbara,"What a find to enhance the enjoyment of our visit with our Seattle grand daughters! A lovely hideawy with a great view of Lake Washington- very comfortable and restful. Jon and Claudia were welcoming, helpful hosts. Personally we hope to take advantage of their hospitality in future Seattle visits. Could not have found a better repose!"
7382303,54860900,2015-11-25,39387212,Ian,"A beautiful luxurious cottage with a breathtaking panoramic view of the water in a quiet neighborhood, and the best hosts I've ever met! I am so grateful for this hidden gem and all the thoughtfulness Jon and his wife put into it. A heated bathroom, memory foam mattress, cozy porch, electric candles, reading lights, washer/dryer, handmade guide book and a full kitchen suite are just a few of the many comforts awaiting you here. To top it all off there was a sampling of groceries and wine waiting for me as well, what a treat! This was by far the most amazing Airbnb experience I've ever had, with the kindest hosts imaginable! "
7382303,55383921,2015-12-01,45632125,Sima,"I arranged for 2 family members to stay in Jon's cottage over Thanksgiving, and it was everything promised: clean, comfortable, lovely, private, and efficient. The setting is beautiful; I couldn't have been happier with the experience. Jon was very accommodating and easy to work with. I would absolutely have friends and family stay here again--it was a very positive experience."
7382303,56053053,2015-12-08,43368802,Evan,2nd time here. Grapevine is a great small apartment in wonderful area of Seattle. 
7382303,57066630,2015-12-21,38678407,Dawn,"We had a lovely time at the Grapevine Cottage!  The cottage is beautiful and extremely comfortable.  The hosts left hot chocolate, marshmallows, and candy canes available for the cold winter night.  They also left a box of applets and cotlets, which I'm embarrassed to admit was completely consumed by us during our 2 day stay.  The cottage kitchen is perfectly equipped with whatever you may need.  The bathroom is clean and spacious, and the bed is SO comfortable.  The house is in a great neighborhood, excellent for walking, and we walked twice up the street to MioPosto for pizza.  Uber rides downtown were about $11 during our stay.  We went downtown to the Pike Place Market and the shopping district.  We thought we were going to head to a sports bar to watch our Utah Utes play in the Las Vegas bowl, but the cottage living room was so comfortable that we decided to just watch it ""at home"" and relax.  The television is great!  Jon and Claudia were extremely kind and gracious hosts.  We can't wait to come back and visit again.  "
7382303,57505928,2015-12-27,41775184,Jennifer,"What a wonderful place in a great neighborhood! We enjoyed walking amongst the beautiful homes and along Lake Washington. While we spent most of our time wandering the town, Jon and his wife had stocked many of the items in the kitchen one might not want to buy if you were fixing something quick. The house was very cozy and comfortable. I would come back in a second if it was available."
6019762,36787263,2015-07-01,20026659,Emma,"We had a lovely week here. Very clean, comfy beds, great outdoor space front and back to enjoy the sunshine, everything you need in the kitchen and a great shower! We felt relaxed and at home during our stay. We would definitely stay here again.

The bus to downtown is round the corner from the property, and it takes about 20 mins. We had no trouble getting around from here. Uber is a great app, and not too expensive to use for transport if you don't want to take the bus. 

We found a good breakfast place nearby called Youngs. It does pancakes and all the good breakfast stuff, and is also a Chinese restaurant. Friendly staff and great food. (website hidden)


"
6019762,37161182,2015-07-05,19545326,Jim,The house and garden are beautiful and very stylish. The warm and cozy atmosphere made us feel at home instantly.  There is a park nearby for kids to play and shopping not far by car. We can highly recommend this place.
6019762,38020732,2015-07-12,2172825,Mevelyn,"Jimmy's house was charming and eclectic.  It has the amenities we wanted. It is a 15 minute drive to downtown as he mentioned online.  If your goal is to relax and veg on your vacation, and you don't mind the drive to restaurants and shops, then, I recommend Jimmy's place.  While we didn't get a chance to meet Jimmy when we arrived as he was out of town, he was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to emails. He also prepared a thorough list of his House Manual which made everything easy. Thank you, Jimmy! :)"
3915826,19981708,2014-09-21,21326293,Amelia,I was pleasantly surprised to find that the apartment was even better than I had expected. Jay was incredibly informative regarding the check-in details and even provided great information about Seattle and the apartment upon arrival. It's such a great location and an amazing price. I can't say enough about how pleased I was! Far better than staying at a hotel. 
3915826,21925020,2014-10-26,22774709,Paige,"My stay was wonderful! The apartment was clean and cozy, as promised, and Jay went to extra lengths to make sure we were comfortable.

Very clean and well kept. We felt right at home.
Thanks for letting us stay!"
3915826,23397535,2014-11-30,2005750,Andy,"Jays place was clean cozy and had all the comforts I needed. It was easy to get to from the freeway and easy to get to and from other parts of Seattle  for my events.
It is a super location with eateries and grocery stores, cafés and pubs all within walking distances. 
To great places to stroll were Ballard and Fremont , both recommend by Jay and both within a short drive. 
The bus to dwntn Seattle was right outside the apartment and ran often.
Great clean cozy, booking here again without a doubt"
3915826,24670228,2015-01-01,24338674,William,Jay was very helpful and the stay was lovely.  He gave us advice on places to go.  His apartment was clean and well laid out. Would recommend.
3915826,33127121,2015-05-25,8762034,Loan,"We had such a wonderful stay at Jay's place. It was very cozy, comfortable and the perfect home away from home for us. Jay was very accommodating with our early check in request. The neighborhood was nice, safe and fun with many food restaurants. We enjoyed staying at Jay's place and hope to stay there again whenever we visit Seattle. "
3915826,36559845,2015-06-29,18230512,Aditya,Jay's apartment was perfect for a weekend trip. The apartment was very clean and inviting and we thoroughly enjoyed our time there. He also left us with a nice binder filled with some nice spots and suggestions to check out around the city which I a absolutely recommend checking out. I would definitely stay here again given the opportunity.
3915826,38443965,2015-07-15,3695901,Jason,"Jay was a nice host. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting in person, but he was great at corresponding. Nice pad, great location. You'll hear some morning street traffic if you sleep with window open, didn't bother me though. "
3915826,39819188,2015-07-26,28243722,Jiaan,"Jay's place was clean and simple, exactly what I was looking for. He left a binder with a ton of recommendations + tour books, which was a nice touch. Street parking was easy to find during my 4-day stay as well."
3915826,46149193,2015-09-08,39159228,Prashanthi,"We a wonderful stay at Jay's place for the long weekend. It was clean, cozy and very comfortable. It is in a nice neighborhood and located only a few miles away from UW which was perfect for us. This is our first experience with Airbnb and we could no have asked for a better place to stay. We hope to stay there again whenever we visit Seattle."
3915826,51414575,2015-10-19,42670170,Boyu (Bill),Jay's apartment is warm and cozy. Every detail of life in Seattle is elegantly concerned. He is a nice and quiet man and he is very suitable for a single traveller like me who likes to enjoy the privacy in a new city. Strongly recommend!
8926060,54549670,2015-11-21,42730385,Guanxiong,"Jason is friendly, helpful and easy to talk. His place is great and definately is among the best in this price level. It's great experience to me!"

1461971,12086050,2014-04-22,13827491,Jaqui,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle, at Eric's property. The photos only show some of the elegance of this Seattle cottage home. We had a great stay, the property is very comfortable - comfortable beds and sofas, and well equipped kitchen. We even had our own little easter egg hunt in the pretty garden.
The neighbourhood feels very safe, the off-road parking conveneinet, and overall location is well suited for visiting Seattle and surrounding sites."
1461971,18350909,2014-08-25,16923941,Karin,"Eric was a great host. He was responsive and checked in with me to make sure we arrived safely. 
It's a beautiful house and comfortable. The backyard and deck are great. For those with kids it's good to know bathroom is downstairs. We made it work fine and the beds were very comfortable. 
It's close to some good parks and easy to get to from the 5. Overall good experience!"
1461971,18823623,2014-09-01,2938186,Jessica & Charlie,This is a great (and huge) house with a beautiful backyard and deck.. the only issue we had was that the internet was broken during our stay.
1461971,40127183,2015-07-28,3520528,Byron,"Great place to stay, especially for the price! The living spaces, kitchen and bathroom were clean and provided plenty of room for the time we spent at the house. The rooftop deck that overlooks the backyard, accessible from the master bedroom, was also pretty cool. I wish it hadn't rained so much while we were there so we could have hung out on it more. The backyard is also beautifully forested and peaceful. I'd recommend this place to anyone who will have a car and is looking for a house in a quiet neighborhood. It was only about a 15 minute drive to U District and 30 minutes to Capitol Hill."
1461971,42127818,2015-08-11,27184680,Stephanie,"This house was perfect for us! Eric was great and made sure we were comfortable in his home upon arrival. The location is close to lots of food and stores. It's also an easy drive to downtown Seattle. The house was spacious enough for 4 adults and a toddler. Our favorite part of the house would have to be the huge, beautiful backyard. I'd absolutely recommend this property!"

841140,3254437,2013-01-03,829596,Carlos,We stayed here over New Year and we hosted a dinner for some friends. Great kitchen and comfy furniture. Too bad it was cold because I would've liked to spend some time on the outside deck.
841140,8392177,2013-10-28,7987966,Jennifer And Jules,"Our stay at Jeremys' place was perfect!  His apartment is very clean, and extremely comfortable.

841140,8704501,2013-11-12,3520881,Alysa,"Jeremy's place was amazing and accommodated my two friends and I perfectly.

I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here and hope to return myself!"

841140,9838613,2014-01-13,345392,Christian,"Jeremy's place is centrally located and very convenient for anyone who wants to explore the culture of Capitol Hill - and beyond.  I rented a car to make it over to Fremont & Alki Beach and finding parking on the same street as Jeremy's place was super easy.  

The apartment itself was spacious and very comfortable. Jeremy was extremely helpful & a great host by letting us stop by earlier in the day to drop off our bags and gave us a few restaurant recommendations and tips about the neighborhood.  We had a great time thanks for Jeremy and his awesome apt!"
841140,12282908,2014-04-28,1090057,Katie,"This apartment is wonderful! Centrally located, beautiful patio, cozy, and clean. While I didn't meet the hosts in person, I heard from my traveling partner they were very nice and made sure everyone was comfortable before leaving. The apartment gets amazing light, so if potential guests are sensitive to light while sleeping, I'd recommend bringing an eye mask to avoid early rising!"
841140,13423713,2014-05-27,6035671,Ty,"This place was great. Everything you need for your stay is included, and there are a ton of restaurants and bars in short walking distance. It's an easy downhill walk to downtown Seattle and Pike Place Market. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. "

841140,15256426,2014-07-06,7421971,Alyssa,"Jeremy's apartment is in an amazing location; the perfect walking distance to the waterfront and downtown. During our week long stay, when we weren't grilling on the beautiful patio that over looked the park, we were exploring the many restaurants and bars that Capital Hill has to offer. As a host, Jeremy was always available if we had any questions before and during our trip. At the end of the day, it was nice to be able to go back to an apartment that felt like home! I would strongly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to experience Seattle!"
841140,16273114,2014-07-24,1223482,Heidi,"Jeremy's apartment is located in a prime location--Capitol Hill. It is an excellent home base to have while exploring Seattle. It is within easy walking distance to the downtown area and by car it is a 10-15 minute drive to other neighborhoods such as Fremont, Ballard and the University District. There is an abundance of places to eat nearby and a supermarket up the block if you want to buy groceries or snacks. The apartment itself is spacious, has great light, high ceilings and a beautiful private terrace where you can unwind after walking around the city all day. Also, the living room couch is dangerously comfortable and could distract you from wanting to leave the apartment! Finding free parking nearby is a little challenging, but if you can score a spot on the same street as the building, then you're all set. Jeremy was fast to respond to all of my questions and was super flexible. He is a fantastic host with a wonderful home. I highly recommend his place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
841140,17869564,2014-08-18,3747305,Sonja,"We had a great time at Jeremy's place. The location is amazing and his place is great value. Jeremy is super responsive and easy to communicate with. It was a very hot weekend in Seattle so it got a little warm in the apartment at night.  There was also noise coming from people on the street, but it didn't disturb our sleep.  I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others and would definitely stay here again."
841140,19949048,2014-09-21,7571678,Kevin,"Great stay! Would definitely book again next time I'm in Seattle.
Jeremy was very helpful and in touch, and flexible with our travel plans. The apartment is great: clean and comfortable, nicely set up, high ceilings, a large patio with garden overlooking the park, lots of light, and an amazing location in the centre of things in Capitol Hill.
The park across the street has playing fields with people out playing dodgeball, basketball, bicycle polo, and generally having a great time. This is a lot of fun to watch. They also make a bit of noise, at least on summer weekends, so if you're used to a quiet environment to sleep you may want earplugs."

Can walk to a bunch of great restaurants and bars... I recommend homegrown for lunch ... And everything is comfy and so practical. We went to Pike Place Market one day and bought fish and veggies to cook and it was just awesome!  I definitely would stay here again :-)"
6591879,37199639,2015-07-05,5785405,Riccardo,"Awesome Awesome Awesome.  EJ was a great host, her home is beautiful, ingeniously decorated, and absolutely comfortable. I love the balcony and the view.  Beds were just right.  Kitchen too.  Perfect place in Magnolia, only 10 mins into the city. EJ was always available and ready to make us feel at home.  Thank you!"
3561237,16045847,2014-07-20,18117629,Christina,"Jan couldn't have been nicer, and her house was BEAUTIFUL, in a Great neighborhood.  Easy to access and easy to get into downtown Seattle.  She made us French press coffee every morning, with organic half and half,  Fresh fruit, and just made us feel relaxed and at ease. I can't say anything but thank you for making our trip awesome.  She was very accommodating by providing an extra bed in the room and having a refrigerator just for the guests.  Thanks for a great experience.   "
3561237,16954251,2014-08-04,16719488,William,"Jan was the best! I have never felt so instantly at home and relaxed at an airbnb. She helped us get settled with a tour of her beautiful house, introduced us to her friendly and well behaved dogs and cat, and gave us recommendations for places to eat within walking distance. She was the perfect host- friendly, responsive, and respectful!

We stayed in the upstairs bedroom which was even better than what is shown in the pictures- the light streaming in from the back yard in the morning was the best way to wake up!

Finally, the location is fantastic. The breeze from the water was perfect as we walked around the neighborhood and explored Discovery park. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!"
3561237,18041808,2014-08-20,7773757,Pippa,Jan was such a lovely hostess. Her house in Magnolia was very spacious and cozy. Had great fun cooking at her well- equipped and big kitchen. Thoroughly recommend her place for anyone looking to explore Seattle and neighbouring areas! 
3561237,19795572,2014-09-18,5136929,Amelia & David,"After our stay at Janyce, we gained a new wonderful friend.  Janyce is now our friend, she rocks!  We are so thankful she shared her beautiful house with us.  David and I loved every minute of our stay.  At had to work from her home, loved hanging out in the living room, quite nice spacious area to work or just chill.   Her home is located in a beautiful neighborhood, amazing views,  peaceful nights and caring neighbors. We felt at home, like staying with our family during the holidays.  Really enjoyed Janyce's company, truly awesome experience, thanks girl. "
3561237,19974286,2014-09-21,7876915,Mohit,"Beautiful, peaceful neighborhood. Janyce was very helpful, and welcoming. Even though she lives on the premise, we hardly saw her. Will definitely recommend this listing"
3561237,24761243,2015-01-02,24550710,Alexander,"Jan was a fantastic host for our group of 14 people over New Years. The house was a beautiful, and provided a comfortable place to hang out in between our excursions into Seattle."
3561237,25502812,2015-01-18,187189,Donna,"This rental is exactly as it is presented on airbnb. Jan is very attentive and easy to communicate with. We rented the entire home for a girls weekend  and Jan's home is just lovely! It is open and roomy in the great room with a very nice, well equipped kitchen. The bedrooms and bathrooms were clean and comfortable. The Magnolia neighborhood is very nice, quiet and convenient to downtown. I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.  Thank you Jan."
3561237,26948621,2015-02-22,500217,Melina,"Jan was incredibly welcoming.  She had snacks, coffee, and milk available for us when we arrived.  The house was impeccably clean and very very comfortable.  I could have slept in the bed for days, if I hadn't been too busy roaming Seattle.  Thanks for a lovely stay, Jan. "
3561237,31230749,2015-05-03,12063477,John,Jan has a beautiful house in a peaceful neighborhood. Everything was in great condition and very clean. Beds were plentiful and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay!
3561237,31789527,2015-05-10,2433517,Evan,"Everything at Jan's place was great. The home is beautiful and in a very nice residential neighborhood.  There was plenty of room for hanging out in the house and backyard. The kitchen is also very nice as was the barbeque grill. Jan herself was great. She was helpful in pointing us towards some nice places to go out, and made sure that everything at the house was in order for us. Great experience, no problems at all."
3561237,33644067,2015-05-31,21483108,Katie,"We had the most fabulous time at Jan's beautiful home.  Really, the pictures don't do it justice.  The giant house, yard, deck, and surrounding neighborhood were all gorgeous.  We rented the house for a fairly big bachelorette party, but Jan was super accommodating and we all appreciated how sweet and helpful she was!  She was upstairs/in and out throughout the weekend, but was completely out of the way anytime we needed the house.  The house is very nice and thus comes with requirements to keep the house at 100%, but basically it just requires you to be respectful and we were able to get our group to comply without a problem.  I completely recommend renting with Jan, we would all do it again in a heartbeat! "
3561237,35284761,2015-06-17,5250462,Sandy,"This is a beautiful home with gorgeous views, convenient to all the sights and parks of Seattle. Jan is a great host, happy to help make the most of your stay. The home is clean, well stocked, spacious, well furnished and the views are amazing!  You will love your stay in Jan's home. "
3561237,35635068,2015-06-21,20329989,Candace,"Outstanding!! Thank you Jan. The house was beautiful inside and out, very luxurious, and in a great location. 

Her place is our number one choice when staying in Seattle. 

Thanks for everything. "
3561237,37247599,2015-07-05,36982280,Heath,"This house was awesome.  It's big, modern, comfortable and immaculately clean. Jan was the perfect host and always available if/when you needed her.  Magnolia is such a beautiful and convenient location to Seattle proper.  We will definitely be back.  :) "
3561237,38873168,2015-07-19,2926003,Nasim,"Jan's home is lovely and in a very nice neighborhood. Comfortable beds & a great backyard. It was spacious and able to accommodate my group of friends who were joining a weekend celebration in Seattle for a friend's bachelorette/birthday party. As a group of 30-something professionals who wanted a nice weekend away, it was a great home to host the group and be together while we played games and watched movies, and only a 15min Uber into great parts of town. Jan was a little late in letting us into the home for check-in which changed our dinner plans on Friday night after arriving. She was apologetic. The evening check-in is something Jan outlined in her description (4:30p check-in, we got in around 5:45p) so it's a good thing to keep in mind while making your plans. She extended our check-out to Noon on the way out to make up for the time lost (it's typically 10am), which was helpful. Jan lives & sleeps full time in the home upstairs in the master bedroom, down a short hall from the other bigger bedrooms upstairs (we rented the full house, both upstairs by Jan's room & the downstairs apartment). She was polite and didn't really pop in; we only saw her 2 or 3 times throughout the weekend. She was conscientious about allowing our group to have their space. After we left, we did have a conversation about a scratch that occurred under her couch from an exposed nail that was covered by a plastic cap that may have popped off from the couch shifting while some of our guests were sitting on it. We have been in touch to settle the cost, which will be based on her appraisal. Even though we read pamphlets and house rules, I would suggest studying up twice as there are lots of things to remember and adhere to. For example, there are rules about recycling (based on laws in the city of Seattle) where we threw a few items into the incorrect trash vs. recycle repositories - again something to be aware of and read carefully as they're atypical from other cities in the U.S. (i.e. Los Angeles and New York City where most of us were from). "
3561237,42855020,2015-08-16,27760592,Joseph,I had my bachelor here for the weekend.  Jan is super helpful and very accommodatting. The kitchen is great for whipping up a meal for 10. It has everything you need.  the backyard is great to hangout and there are enough beds and couches for my 11 man bachellor party.  Nick (the house supervisor) is super helpful and friendly. This is a great place to stay!
3561237,43623804,2015-08-21,34863758,Kiersten,"Jan made us feel very welcomed into her beautiful home. We were traveling on busy and it was wonderful coming back to a quiet luxury home only 10-12 minutes away from downtown Seattle. The home was highly maintained, all the basic amenities were provided, and we would definitely book again."
3561237,45127966,2015-08-31,8994663,Yuliya,"The house appears as it is described, it's very cozy. Jan is kind and very welcoming. The neighborhood is quite. Plenty of space to park on the street if you host a gathering at the house. Private backyard.  Everything is nice and well taken care of."
3561237,51175608,2015-10-18,8121690,Bryan,"Jan was very warm, welcoming, and accommodating. For example, my sailing team rented the house and she did not mind letting hang a very large sail from her private balcony to dry.

The house is very clean, comfortable, and as described. The proximity to Discovery Park makes for some very scenic runs. She has a large well equipped kitchen which was excellent for making large meals and preparing lunch each day. I would definitely recommend a stay here."
3604904,15994277,2014-07-19,1104165,Daniel,"Ari is a cool guy, friendly and easy to communicate with. He was very patient although we were a bit late checking in and he let us leave our luggage for the whole day after checking out. The room is on the ground floor and has a large, newly renovated private bathroom attached directly to it. The room itself is quite small, however, and the sofa bed unfortunately takes up most of the space. On the other hand, you have easy access to a nice and spacious private porch, where you can have a coffee and read the paper in the morning. The amazing 24h Metropolitan Market, where you can get pretty much anything you would ever need in terms of food and drink, is a quick 10 minutes walk north. The neighborhood is quiet and with easy access to parks and not far from downtown. All in all, the room is a great value and I would stay again. Thanks again Ari and good luck in all your future endeavours!"
3604904,16281029,2014-07-24,161684,Jon-Jon,"My stay with Ari was fairly short, considering my later than expected arrival into Seattle on the first day. Ari was still available to welcome me despite my late arrival. 

His place is where it says on Google maps but finding the actual house was a bit confusing as the house numbers on the street aren't clearly visible. The room was a bit small; the pull-out couch took up most of the room but it was comfortable and I had no problems sleeping. 

The house is a bit of a commute by public transit from downtown, which is where I spent most of my time. But given the short notice of my booking, Ari was prompt in his communications. "
3604904,16382657,2014-07-26,18601259,Jackie,"We had a great stay with Ari. Space was very clean and private. We came and went as we liked--he was very kind and accommodating.  We parked on street and took the bus into Downtown for the evening. As listed, the bed is a pullout couch, so definitely not as comfortable as an ordinary bed, but the price is hard to beat for a room in Seattle."
3604904,16755350,2014-08-01,12270626,Peter,"Ari is a good host, he was these at the check in and we talked briefly once after. The room is clean and as others have mentioned, relatively small. We did not fine that am issue personally and the private bathroom is very convenient. We stayed for three nights while organising our further travels and found the area to be good and well connected by public transport."
3604904,18155454,2014-08-22,19709209,Joseph,"I had a very positive experience at Ari's place. He was very helpful to open his place to me on short notice, and everything was good to go when I arrived. The area is primarily residential, so there are not many shops and restaurants within walking distance. There are multiple bus stops close by, the main drawback is needing to wait for the bus and possibly transfer bus lines if you're heading to another part of the city. Having a bike or car would make getting around from this location easier, but it was manageable to get around by only walking and busing, it just took longer. I would be happy to stay here again if I needed a place to stay in Seattle."
3604904,18219329,2014-08-23,20285330,Hannah,"Ari was great! It was so convenient to stay at his house- we got in around nine and left around eleven. The room is small but a perfect place to sleep for an evening, and the private attached bathroom is perfect after a long day for exploring! I would definitely stay there again if I were to return to Seattle. "
3604904,18805710,2014-09-01,6538531,Yi,Ari was great and I had a great stay in Seattle!
3604904,19163562,2014-09-07,3588953,Bernadine,"Ari's place was just perfect for our needs--mainly a comfortable bed and privacy after a full day of sightseeing.  Ari's place is very near public transportation, as this was the way we got around the city.

The place was a bit tricky to locate, but Ari steered us in the right direction and welcomed us to his place and made sure we knew he was available for anything we may have needed during our stay.

If you're looking for the very basics of a home away from home, Ari's place will suit your needs.  The sofa bed really does take up the whole room. Nevertheless, the room and location served us  very well."
3604904,19377840,2014-09-11,8169384,Helen,"Ari was a great host. We enjoyed our stay at his home. It was 15min walking distance to UW campus. The house is located close to UW village, which is an upscale outdoor mall with many shops and restaurants. "
3604904,19441162,2014-09-12,20941654,Michael,"The listing was perfectly accurate.  It is a tremendously good location if you have business at UW or need to be at Seattle Children's Hospital.  While parking in most of the area around UW is very scarce, there was more than ample (free) parking.  Three buses stop less than a block away.  I enjoyed a bit of a walk in the neighborhood, which includes a great walking and biking trail, exceptionally good grocery store, and restaurants nearby.  Unlike some areas around UW, there was nothing seedy or sketchy about the neighborhood.   As advertised, the room is small. But the bathroom was good sized, as was the closet.  Ari was quick to respond, personable and polite.  I would strongly recommend this room to anyone needing a place to sleep near UW, as I did.  Price, location, and host are commendable. "
3604904,19506534,2014-09-13,9406460,Michael,"I had business to attend late, and needed an early departure as well.  So I had little overlap with Ari there.  But he was very accommodating of my late arrival, and the sofa bed was already prepared for sleeping.  It was a little confusing finding the place at first, since I arrived in the alley, but Ari met me outside to confirm I was at the right place.  

The room has a private bath, and the neighborhood was nice.  There was ample street parking.  I'd gladly return on another business trip to Seattle and stay there if it was available.  It was comfortable and perfect for my needs.
"
3604904,19843314,2014-09-19,20941654,Michael,"I've stayed at Ari's twice.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who needs to be near UW or the Seattle Children's Hospital.  It's an amazing location for either of those.  (And a perfectly good location for anywhere else in Seattle, if you have a car.)"
3604904,22073503,2014-10-29,9519261,Marianne,"Ari was very flexible with a late check in time. The room was perfect. It was cozy, clean, and I loved the private bath. The bed was really comfortable. The neighborhood was safe and close to the University. parking was never a problem. "
3604904,22475435,2014-11-07,13896249,Makayla,Room as pictured. Very clean and close to public transit. I had a great stay overall.
3604904,23043105,2014-11-21,23309422,Ted,"This was a great place to stay during my trip to Seattle. It was in the perfect location to visit the medical center, which is what my trip was for. Ari was welcoming and had everything ready when I arrived. The room was nice and private with its own bathroom. It was on its own downstairs so that was nice. The bed was comfortable. I didn't interact with my host much because I had a busy schedule. I would definitely stay here again. "
3604904,23481972,2014-12-01,12938273,Kelly,Ari's place was in a very convenient location for our stay and the room was clean and well kept. He was accommodating and provided great communication.
3604904,23550280,2014-12-04,23189025,Nivedita,Ari's place was perfect after a long day of sightseeing around Seattle. It is right across the street from Seattle Children's and about a $15 Uber ride from Pike Place Market. The room was as pictured and very clean and comfortable. Ari was also very flexible with a late arrival and was very friendly! 
3604904,23613389,2014-12-06,11001668,Alison,"Great room on bottom floor. Private bathroom with tub. Neat, clean, and hotel-esque. Ari was very sweet and personable. We had a great time."
3604904,23760479,2014-12-09,23753084,Richard,Ari was a great host--very accomodating and friendly. The room was very clean and located on the first floor by itself so you don't worry about getting in anyone's way and can do your own thing while staying here. The location was perfect for my visit (interviewing at the Children's Hospital) as it is directly across the street. It is walking distance to a lot of good restaurants and the University District. 
3604904,23823434,2014-12-11,23753084,Richard,"Everything was great--very clean, comfortable, great location, and great recommendations for restaurants nearby!"
3604904,25216349,2015-01-09,13896249,Makayla,Perfect accommodations and the room was described accurately.  
3604904,25339979,2015-01-12,25705739,Mattie,Great location and the room was clean and tidy! 
3604904,25581823,2015-01-19,24713284,Jenny,"We didn't spend a ton of time at Ari's but we appreciated the freedom to come and go at our leisure, at whatever hour. Being downstairs we weren't worried about us disturbing them or vice versa. Very comfortable, clean, and convenient!"
3604904,25941960,2015-01-30,13896249,Makayla,I have stayed here several times and always have a great experience.
3604904,26468189,2015-02-13,13896249,Makayla,Have stayed here sever times and always a great experience. Great location.
3604904,27521327,2015-03-06,13896249,Makayla,Great stay as always.
3604904,27667076,2015-03-09,21294425,Carla,"I never had the pleasure of meeting Ari (we arrived super late at night and were gone all day the whole time we were there), but we corresponded via text leading up to my trip to arrange accessing the house. The house was easy to find using my GPS and is very conveniently located. I was visiting UW, and was able to walk ~5 minutes to a campus shuttle. During the weekend, we also visited many of Seattle's neighborhoods and nearby attractions. We rented a car for convenience, but the house is not far from one of the major bike trails and seems very accessible by bus. The space is small, but perfect for 1 person or a couple. The pull-out couch was more comfortable than I expected (a full-size bed), and it was wonderful having our own bathroom. The space was clean and pretty private. The door to the bedroom is textured glass, and is right next to the main entrance of the house and the stairs that lead to upstairs (where Ari lives). We could hear some conversations happening upstairs, but nothing too loud or disturbing. Overall, this place is great value for its location and amenities."
3604904,27885931,2015-03-14,1717788,Cathy,"This is a great home in a good location, walking distance to amenities on a nice trail, and close to transit.  The rooms are private and separate from the rest of the house so you don't have to worry about disturbing the hosts.  Other than the fridge, there is no use of the kitchen facilities.  The sleeping area is small so not ideal for spending time in, but if you are just looking for a place to sleep after a day of sightseeing, this is perfect for the price.  Would definitely recommend staying here."
3604904,28025351,2015-03-16,28251605,Ben,Easy to find! Place is very clean!
3604904,28727234,2015-03-29,27949473,Yejin,it was cozy and very clean. He put guide on the bed and it was very helpful. I recommend this host and house. 
3604904,30366169,2015-04-20,29034662,Tunzala,Good host!
3604904,30821416,2015-04-27,817131,Marika,"We stayed with Ari for two nights and would recommend his place. Ari was friendly, helpful and accomodating. the room was cosy and bathroom a bonus- we spent most of the time out in Seattle and it was a great place to return to. It was nice to have the ease of coming and going as we pleased without disturbing Ari who lives upstairs. Overall a very enjoyable experience, thank you Ari!"
3604904,31149881,2015-05-02,32020846,Judy,"It was a great place and very welcoming. Perfect location to Met Market, the Burke Gilman Trail and Univ of WA.
Clean private and friendly.
Very accommodating to my friend's schedule."
3604904,31402857,2015-05-04,24593373,Stephanie,"The room was small, but everything was clean. The location was convenient to get to and from downtown and other Seattle areas by car (we didn't try transit). The air mattress on the sofa bed was just big enough for two, but probably great for one. Can't beat it for the price!"
3604904,32142071,2015-05-14,29752650,Kevin,Great place by the UW area for late night food. Comfy room and I like the  private bathroom to myself. Easy access. 
3604904,34099376,2015-06-04,5430626,Jansen,"Ari's place was perfect for our quick stop in Seattle.  It's convenient location was great for easy access to the UW, as well as restaurants, grocery stores, etc.  The room is as described, comfortable, and Ari made us feel welcome right away."
3604904,34884896,2015-06-13,26670673,Yves,"I spend 4 nights in Ari's and Elisabeth's house. I have been welcoming nicely. I did'nt met them a Long Time because they were busy and left early in the morning . 
The room was comfortable with a private bathroom. 
Eaven the house was a little bit far from Downtown Seattle it was easy to go , the bus stop was So close to their door.

Tanks Elisabeth and Ari for this stay

3604904,34964578,2015-06-14,31866964,Alice,Ari is very nice and responds really fast. The house was comfortable and at a convenient location. 
3604904,35121647,2015-06-15,31866964,Alice,We enjoyed our stay and Ari is very nice! 
3604904,35994712,2015-06-23,26857421,Ben,The host canceled this reservation 46 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3604904,38654678,2015-07-17,37821701,Larry,"The location was very convenient to UW and Uville.  Although the room was a bit tight with the bed pulled out, it was as shown in the pictures, private, quiet, clean and well kept.  The bed wasn't very comfortable but I think it was because there might have been an air mattress that was supposed to have been inflated.  "
3604904,39297973,2015-07-22,35778052,Kwon Taek,"I stayed three nights very comfortably. I went to Univ. of Washington and downtown conveniently by metro. The room was very small, but private bathroom was excellent."
3604904,39768128,2015-07-26,33023527,Ruth,"The room was room was nice, just like the pictures. We really enjoyed the bonus of having our own en-suite bathroom. 
Although the house was a fair distance from downtown, we made full use of the excellent bus and cycle links right on our doorstep. 
Also the house is just a 10 minute stroll from the brilliant university district. 
Thanks. "
3604904,40179314,2015-07-28,37675154,Robert,The rom was nice and comfortable with a separate bathroom. Ari was very friendly and helpful. This was a good and easy start in our vaccation...
3604904,50877051,2015-10-15,40447480,Lynn,Ari was really great Host to work with. The room was exactly as described in the pictures and the bonus was the separate bathroom.  Great price in a great location. You won't be disappointed.
6939106,36157633,2015-06-25,32857570,Thomas,"First and foremost, Chris went out of his way to accommodate me.  I had very specific arrival and departure needs which I gave him on very short notice and Chris went above and beyond what I would've expected from a host.  He also made sure his apartment was stocked with complimentary bath items, and left me an inclusive list of restaurants, bars, and sights located close to his apartment.

As to the apartment itself, it was beautiful.  Chris has a great sense of design and I consider it a privilege that he allowed me to share his space.  It was clean and had wonderful natural light with great views of the city and a rainforest's worth of awesome plants everywhere.  The apartment is located within a couple blocks of a trendy neighborhood full of boutique shopping/bars/restaurants/clubs and just a short walk downhill to the downtown sights, fish market, space needle, etc.  There's public transportation close by and really everything you could need is right around the corner.

The only negative about the whole stay was that I had to leave.  Again, I can't thank Chris enough and would highly recommend renting his property."
6939106,36920444,2015-07-02,14980426,Kenneth,"I couldn't have picked a better AirBnB! This place is a gem and priced FAR below the market rate! Chris was incredibly responsive before my trip. He mailed me keys to the apartment so that I could have them upon my arrival since he wouldn't be around and included list of popular attractions and eateries! 

His place is centrally-located in one of Seattle's coolest neighborhoods (Capital Hill) and downtown is in walking distance. That made it easy for me to get a lot of sight seeing done in a short amount of time. 

Chris's apartment has lots of character. The art is fantastic, as were all the live plants and sunlight. It felt like a vacation home in the middle of the city. The hammock in the middle of the living room was clutch! I could even see the space needle from the living room. I'd stay here again anytime!"
6939106,37919569,2015-07-11,37482946,Jeanna,"Chris was excellent to correspond with as I was planning my trip and was willing to rent to me - a first time AirBNBer and with no reviews.  He was very accommodating with my check-in and check-out times.    The photos and description of the space were spot on and the location was excellent, with a great view from the hammock, as stated.  Easy access to the bus system and some tasty restaurants, too.   Thanks for everything and all your recommendations, Chris!"
6939106,38062441,2015-07-12,18244868,Kurt,Excellent experience. The room was well decorated and tidy. The decorations reminded me of a Hawaiian beach/surfer setting. Very cool. Chris was very accommodating. 
6939106,38422836,2015-07-15,8345378,Kenzi,"Chris's place was amazing. Communication was perfect, the place was clean, and he lives in a fantastic location. Would 100% stay with him again, and recommend anyone going to Seattle to stay with him too!"
6939106,38631004,2015-07-17,34538487,Keagen,Had a wonderful stay. What a great part of town. What a great place. From the moment I walked in all I could say was wow. There was a perfect view of the Space Needle from the living room windows. One of the only drawbacks I noticed was that since it was in the nightlife part of town and the windows were always open you could hear word for word the conversations people would have on the street no matter the time of day. Other than that though I got a taste of how Seattle is and I fell in love. 
6939106,39654971,2015-07-25,30106199,Danielle,Chris' place was great! We had such a grea time 
6939106,39894710,2015-07-26,3737953,Justin,My friend and I both had a great time staying at Chris's apartment. It was in an ideal location and had all the amenities one could need. The space is very open and full of natural light with tons of windows that all open to let in fresh air. Chris was super flexible with our check-in and check-out. My favorite aspects of the apartment were the hammock and the earthy decor. I'd recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay in the vibrant Capitol Hill.
6939106,40526086,2015-07-31,12007024,Michael,"Chris has a beautifully designed apartment. The greenery and attention to detail make for a wonderful stay. Don't underestimate the included parking---a rarity for Capital Hill. Excellent communication, Chris even met us at the apt for check-in late at night when a key transfer didn't go as planned. Highly recommend."
6939106,40838105,2015-08-02,8440135,Tamara,"Chris's apartment is a gem in a great location, with a serene artistic aesthetic, a terrific view, fast wireless and a supremely comfortable bed.  Chris is also a super host - responsive, friendly and flexible.  I arrived on a hot summer afternoon and the apartment was toasty with sun streaming in through west facing windows (just as a heads up for those accustomed to AC) but I didn't mind at all, especially because the late afternoon light was beautiful.  Did I mention how comfortable the bed is? Thank you, Chris! "
6939106,41275560,2015-08-05,39794370,Daniel,"The place was great, exactly as advertised.  The neighborhood is terrific, with great restaurants and bars nearby.  Chris was an excellent host, and I truly enjoyed my stay."
6939106,41474935,2015-08-07,14408496,Alexandra,"Chris was great! He was really easy to get in touch with, made check in and check out very convenient, and was available for any questions we had. The place was exactly as pictured and was in a great neighborhood. Would definitely recommend for anyone staying in Seattle!"
6939106,41675427,2015-08-08,16055733,Lenna,"Best. Apartment. Ever.  Located close to everything you would want to see and do in Capitol Hill. Chris was a great host, meeting us promptly and with such enthusiasm! The apartment was spotless and even had little things laid out for you should you need them! Maps, toiletries, etc.  The vibe in the apartment makes you relax completely! The hammock was priceless! Thanks Chris! I would totally stay your place again!"
6939106,42580290,2015-08-14,39480237,Barbara,"Chris’ apartment was clean with great views and lots of natural light.  The location in Capitol Hill was excellent – close to lots of restaurants and bars, a fantastic bakery, a huge grocery store, and several bus routes for a quick ride to downtown Seattle or Seattle Center.

Chris was a great host.  He was very friendly and extremely responsive to our questions.   The Airbnb listing includes a great guidebook with many recommendations and Chris also had a list of printed recommendations, several Seattle travel books, and maps in the apartment.  The complimentary toiletries were a nice touch.  

We had a great time in Seattle and enjoyed our stay!
"
6939106,42921127,2015-08-16,5627462,Quinton,Chris was an exceptionally good host attentive from the very beginning.  He provided excellent recommendations of restaurants and things-to-do.  His very nice apartment was clean and convenient and in a great neighborhood.  He had great flexibility on arrival and departure times.  It was a great experience.
6939106,44044139,2015-08-23,36369645,Lorena,"Chris apartment is perfectly located in quiet yet very happening neighborhood. Amazing restaurants and bars all within walkable distances. The apartment was clean, airy, and with lots of natural light. The art, plants, and hammock made it feel like a little oasis getaway.  He's very accomodating and friendly. Overall wonderful stay! "
6939106,44687747,2015-08-28,1175971,Ilya,chris was very prompt to respond to all my messages. the place was great and super central to everything. i'd stay here again.
6939106,44942164,2015-08-30,3024308,Grace,"Cool apartment + awesome owner + great neighbourhood = Completely hassle free experience and perfect weekend.

Chris communicates quickly and informatively.  His apartment is exactly as depicted in the pictures.  It's such a cool space that you'll spend a lot of time looking at the art and decor. If you need ideas for decorating your own place, you will definitely leave with some.  It's modern, natural, unpretentious, and artistic at the same time.  I can not imagine anyone not liking the place.  It's also super clean, so if you're a hypochondriac, you won't have any problems.  Linens, pillows, and duvets were clean and comfy.  

The apartment feels large because of all the windows.  There were three of us staying there and it was big enough for us.   One of us slept in the bedroom (the bed is big enough for two people), one slept on the couch that turns into a bed (and was all set up with linen when we arrived), and one slept in the hammock!  The hammock is such a cool feature and you can tuck it away when not in use.  

Location is perfect - very quick walk to the bars and restaurants but far enough to be quiet.  We had no problems with noise at all and slept with the windows open. The neighbourhood is beautiful and lined with really cool houses. It feels very safe and residential.  We had no problems walking home at night.   Parking pass was a bonus but you can walk everywhere in Capital Hill. Had no problems finding parking on the street.  

Chris mailed keys and sent a note with restaurant and bar recommendations so that helped with trip planning before we even got there.  When we arrived, he had free toiletries and other awesome freebies waiting for us, and left lots of travel guide info on the table.   Chris was quick to answer any further questions when we arrived.  

It felt like Chris was a good friend who was letting us use his place and really wanted us to enjoy our time.  He's really everything you could hope for in an Airbnb owner.  If you are hemming and hawing for whatever reason, just stop, book it, and enjoy. This apartment is in very good hands.  All three of us had nothing negative to say when we left.  We all said we would totally stay there again and would recommend it to friends and family heading to Seattle.  
"
6939106,47305607,2015-09-17,45609,Sean,"Chris' place was perfect for me. Great neighborhood, easy access to everything. The place is bright and welcoming. I felt at home. Chris was easy to communicate with and his place is lovely. Highly recommend. "
6939106,47839662,2015-09-21,43815260,Michael,Chris did a great job taking care of our needs.  The place had all the amenities required plus some.
6939106,48327379,2015-09-25,7596232,Peter,"Chris's place is perfectly located to get downtown Seattle quickly.  The view from the window framed the Space Needle.  I enjoyed the walk to a nearby Starbucks early each morning.  It was quintessential Seattle.  Parking was no problem since Chris had a lot we could park in as well as a pass for the street parking.  It was so much better than a hotel room for our visit and with the President of China in town, it was a good option.  Chris provided a thorough list of 'need to know while you are here' items as well as local points of interest. "
6939106,48780285,2015-09-28,8329263,Winnie,"What a comfy clean place this was! Nice bathroom..easy parking
and lovely light! We were walking distance from all the good foods and Chris answered all my questions no mater what time it was day or night. Def would stay here again!
"
6939106,49409649,2015-10-03,45468250,Charles,Chris' apartment is beautiful and artistically decorated. It's clear that he spent a lot of effort decorating the place and making it feel welcome to the guests that stay there. He was also very helpful during the checking in process. I'd highly recommend staying there if you take a trip to Seattle. 
6939106,49510709,2015-10-04,24739953,Greg,"Listing description was dead-on. Chris was very easy to work with, one of us had a bag lost during transit and the toiletries that Chris staged for us were greatly appreciated. Bottom line, a very comfortable apartment in an excellent location"
6939106,50048143,2015-10-08,44602053,Paul,The place was really great. Nice to have a bunch of plants at a place you are staying. Makes it feel more like a home. Chris was really nice and accommodating. 
6939106,51489611,2015-10-20,3569432,Maxine,"It was a pleasure interacting with Chris. He made it super easy to know exactly what we should do and what to expect, and he promptly communicated whenever necessary. He provided a bunch of amenities for our stay as well as recommendations for visiting.  Thanks Chris!"
6939106,51663062,2015-10-22,26367904,Bette,"All interactions with Chris were easy, friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the artistic touches throughout the apartment, lots of windows, comfy high quality bed sheets and towels. Nice dining table for me to spread out my work and an excellent wifi connection here. The building is older and modest with squeaky floors and such, but Chris has made it feel special with many nice touches."
6939106,51979050,2015-10-25,14385670,Chris,"What a terrific place to stay in Seattle!  My girlfriend and I arrived right at check-in, and everything was ready for us!  The place is so wonderful with plants everywhere! The decor was wonderful, we didn't utilize the hammock, but we weren't in the house that much to enjoy it.  And the view!  The living room overlooks the Space Needle, which was a wonderful sight for our first time in Seattle.  The place is so sunny and inviting!  It's in an ideal location to visit the Space Needle (it was a pleasant 30-40 minute walk, or a 10-15 minute drive).  Plenty of suggestions for things to do, guide books were available, and the little end table of toiletries was a fantastic touch!  What a perfect way to spend a weekend in Seattle! "
6939106,52201950,2015-10-26,13605283,Jamie,"This was a *great* listing! The space was lovely with a TON of great energy! Plus, Chris left treats and really great details about Capitol Hill. Total win!"
6939106,52422661,2015-10-29,44090757,Nikki,"After a long cold and rainy Seattle day, I checked in kind of late but all the lights were on, making me feel safe and welcome. Everything was bright and clean, including the linens! Photos and art around the house made me feel like I was just staying in a friend's place. The toiletries were an especially nice touch since I forgot to pack a few things.

Slept very well in the bed, had some hot tea for breakfast, no hassle checkout - overall a great experience! 

Great way to start off at my first Airbnb."
6939106,53130685,2015-11-05,26272599,Ann,"Chris's place looks exactly as pictured - so, a very cool place. He had the sofa made into a bed when we arrived and it's very comfy. The hammock is a lot of fun too. Great neighborhood. We only had one night, wish it were longer!"
6939106,53235876,2015-11-06,18362895,Jessica,"Chris's place was great, clean comfortable, and full of character.  In a great area of town.  Thanks Chris!"
6939106,53420095,2015-11-08,5656767,Joe,"Chris is an excellent host. He is very responsive and even set out toothbrushes, toothpaste and shampoo/conditioner. His place is great! The location is perfect, there is tons of natural light. I'd definitely stay there again. "
6939106,54066558,2015-11-15,1313774,Liz,Chris' apartment was in a fantastic location and checking-in was such a breeze. The hammock was such a fun touch -- and quite a place to take a little nap! His detailed list of instructions and neighborhood suggestions helped set out the lay of the land and I was able to head out for coffee almost immediately. I would highly recommend the apartment for anyone looking to see Seattle with a neighborhood vibe. 
6939106,54534578,2015-11-21,24363809,Eli,"Chris was an excellent host and communicated with me in a very timely manner. He was able message me back almost immediately after I sent him a message.

The apartment was very spacious and clean. 

Chris was able to provide my party and I toiletries and towels. 

The location was perfect. Just a short walk from Capital Hill and multiple bars."
6939106,54647052,2015-11-22,2675779,Isabelle,"Staying at Chris' pace was great. Great location, lovely space as described and simple check in and out. Chris is very responsive and easy to deal with. Thanks so much for the stay!"
6939106,54948980,2015-11-25,6272823,Hillary,"Chris was a wonderful host and his apartment was just perfect. Chris was very responsive and easy to communicate with about my arrival time. The apartment upon arrival was perfectly clean, welcoming and comfortable. There was even a little table with a bunch of toiletries -  so cute and convenient!! Thank you so much for the wonderful stay, Chris! I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone looking for a comfy and conveniently located apartment in Cap Hill! "
6939106,55157933,2015-11-28,8013911,Vlada,"Everything went smoothly. Chris is very accommodating, even leaves some toothbrushes and soaps out for you to use if you need them. He is very responsive to your messages/texts. It was great. The apartment and the hammock were fun. The neighborhood was fun and had a lot of nightlife, which actually wasn't for me, but that's personal preference. The food was great. And we could see the space needle from the window, which was a treat."
6939106,55254752,2015-11-29,10646359,Ian,"Chris's apartment was a great place for our overnight stay. Its in a fantastic location and the parking was a nice addition! Really appreciated all the nice touches that made it feel like home, would stay again in a heartbeat. "
6939106,55460271,2015-12-01,235863,Jordan,"Great communication and perfect location on the hill. Everything was clean and well organized. Nice natural lighting and beautiful plants and decorations around the unit. Chris made getting in and out a breeze for the three of us that stayed there. 

The only issue we had was that the 'queen bed' is actually a futon mattress that is rather uncomfortable. Really wish there was at least one actual bed mattress in the apartment. 

The other minor issue was that we were told at least a few times not to mention anything about AirBnB to anyone in the building. While I understand why the host encourages this, it adds some awkwardness when entering/exiting the building."
6939106,55742920,2015-12-05,103782,Sonja,"Chris was a great communicator and sent many detailed emails to make check-in easy. The apartment is in a terrific location and is very comfortable with everything you could need -- lots of space, great bed, lots of windows, cool vintage kitchen and amenities like extra toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap and shampoo. The parking pass was a great bonus too. "
6939106,55885169,2015-12-06,47481052,Jim,"Thank you Chris, 
The location was great, with easy check in.  The place is comfortable and well equipped and my daughter wants your plant :)  "
6939106,56761809,2015-12-17,41959640,Tara,"Excellent experience staying at Christopher's bright apartment. My flight arrived late into Seattle, and Chris was very flexible with my late check in time. He was quick to respond to my questions. Had no trouble getting into the apartment and felt completely safe. I definitely hope to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
6939106,56887687,2015-12-19,38320745,Xuanyi,A nice place to stay

1692318,22242185,2014-11-02,3493663,Ammara,"My family and I, a group of 5 people, were in town for a engagement party. I was extremely happy with this space. Here are a few reasons
1. Location. It was a 30 min drive from the airport, 15 min from downtown, and 15 min from engagement party. For us this was a perfect blend.
2. Kids/infant friendly. I was traveling with a 6 month old infant and I needed a full working fridge/freezer. Also, the host provided us with pack and play that we used. This was handy and a nice touch 
3. Spacious/roomy. The place is quite big. The bedrooms are spacious so you dont feel like you are top of anyone. And with the baby, it helps to have lots of room. 
4. Clean. I am big on cleaning. Even if I go to a hotel room, I inspect the bed, pillows, sheets. So I was happy to see everything was at a high standard. 
5. The little things. I was pleasantly surprised to see a makeup table and mirror in each room and long mirrors as well. I also loved the games and movies provided. 

Overall it was a great experience. I don't have any complaints.

1692318,22725935,2014-11-12,16508388,Jonathon,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I could not have been happier.  I tour manage an up and coming band out of LA and finding a comfortable place to stay for five guys on a tight budget can sometimes be difficult. Darcy's villa was well accommodated with extra blankets and towels. She had a goodie basket with coffee, tea, and light snacks which was great to get us going in the morning. Darcy had all of her policies clearly explained in her welcome book which also had lists of restaurants, banks, and other local businesses attached. She had also clearly labeled everything in the villa and it was just a nice cozy place to stay for us in between shows. Darcy was even kind enough to print out some documents for me! Her dog Koa was also a little sweetie :-) I would highly recommend Darcy's villa if looking or a place to stay in Seattle."
1692318,23330775,2014-11-29,8566303,Josh,"Darcy's place was beautiful and very welcoming. Unfortunately, our plans changed after we checked-in and we did not need to stay there. If we had, i'm sure we would have been really happy with the place!"
1692318,24874467,2015-01-03,20384860,Angelo,"We enjoy so much to stay in Darcy house last week. The house was clean and big enough for 5 persons. Even tho we did not have chance to meet with Darcy, but we will absolutely come back !
"
1692318,26626451,2015-02-16,26849890,Jason,"Our family of 5 visited Seattle for the first time and stayed here for three nights. It's right off the freeway, very easy to find and sits nicely between the city and Lynwood where American Girl Doll is...perfect for us. Decorated nicely and very clean. Darcy was very nice and welcoming...we would stay again."
1692318,27968028,2015-03-15,28504278,Jennifer,"Very close to downtown seattle without being downtown. Quiet, comfy, clean and safe. Great dog park nearby as well!!"

1692318,37745490,2015-07-10,32601076,Jennifer,Darcy was a great hostess and her space was awesome for our family of 4.  The daylight basement apartment was spacious and comfortable.  It was also very convenient to I-5 and other routes for getting to our sightseeing destinations.  We had a lovely stay!
1692318,39147696,2015-07-21,2885852,Barbara," We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Darcy's villa.  There was plenty of room spread out and relax.  The entrance was behind a gate to a spacious backyard with some lawn chairs for our use.  Our only disappointment was that the washer & dryer were out of commission.  It is close to an interstate onramp so getting places was fairly easy.  
We would stay at the villa again, maybe next year."
1692318,39525932,2015-07-24,36830269,Yuzhao,Darcy is so nice and the room is clean and quiet. We feel like stay at home.

Taylor is very friendly, has offered to show me around the neighborhood and gave plenty of suggestions of itineraries I can choose from."

4707171,27114029,2015-02-25,27704846,J.M.,Convenient location! Comfortable apartment. Great stay. Thank you! 
4707171,27698222,2015-03-09,27704846,J.M.,Great place / Prime location! 
4707171,27826121,2015-03-12,3218117,Brooke & Benny,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4707171,28468953,2015-03-24,13465323,Vanessa,"The experience was great! It was a 5-10 minute walk to the light rail, with a few hills to walk up. There are plenty of places to eat just two minutes away. The host was living upstairs but didn't come in contact with us. Overall it was an easy, comfortable and pleasant stay!"
4707171,29433569,2015-04-07,29182715,Stephane,"Josh wasn't there for our arrival but he was kind enough to let us drop our baggage a little bit before the apartment was ready. We asked for a second key set and he drop them the day after. The area is awesome... We went to the Columbia City Theater for an evening show, also went to the Royal Room, the Bakery, Geraldine's counter and the awesome pizza from Tutta Bella Neapolitan Pizzeria. A lot of stuff is at a walk distance. The apartment is decent for what you pay, all conveniences are there, washing machines, dishwasher, etc.

Humidity was high in the apartment and we had to open the windows a couple of times to let air the apartment a little. Aside from that, we were pleased with the place.

Location is great, a side block from the bus going downtown Seattle. Overall experience was pretty positive."
4707171,29740508,2015-04-12,28116628,Sara,"This apt was so nice and in a great neighborhood! There was great natural light, comfy and clean beds and plenty of room to relax! My parents and I had a wonderful time! "
4707171,30214359,2015-04-19,17163539,George,Couldn't have asked for a better stay. Josh did such a great job of making sure we had everything we could possibly need. The apartment was really charming and Colombia City gave us such a nice taste of seattle. Really couldn't have asked for a better experience.
4707171,30988196,2015-04-30,1464236,Virginia,"This is one of the best places I have stayed at on airbnb. Kitchen has everything you need, the beds are fluffy and comfy, there's Netflix and Huluplus ready to go on the TV, and the shower is hot and powerful. Josh is a great communicator which made getting the key and everything super easypeasy. Thanks for a great stay, Josh!"
4707171,31328831,2015-05-04,27871669,Debra,"Was very pleased with the  locale,  appearance,  size, price and access to shopping and restaurants in Columbia city. My son and his family was only 2-3 blocks away. We enjoyed a leisurely breakfast every am at the Columbia City Bakery walking 2 blocks in the wonderful  northwest air. Couldn't  have been happier. Completely stocked with all the essentials.  Loved the crisp cotton linens for the beds and bath. Spacious and private. Stress free. Will be returning."
4707171,31804229,2015-05-10,30919002,Jeanne,"We really enjoyed our stay.  For us, the location was excellent.  Easy to find, very pretty street, Geraldine's right down the block.  We were lucky enough to find street parking every time we came back.  For us, the only drawback was the lack of a full length mirror!  For some, the one bathroom might be a drawback, but we did fine.  We had everything we needed, and it was clean, bright and comfy.  Thank you."
4707171,32172806,2015-05-15,29956988,Joe & Jackie,"Thank you, Josh.  We enjoyed staying at your apartment.  Lots of personal touches that made our stay very comfortable.  The neighborhood is lovely and we enjoyed the convenience  of restaurants, bus stops, and grocery stores.  Easy check in and out process.  I would recommend Josh's place if you are visiting the Seattle area."
4707171,32884917,2015-05-23,28371855,Andrew,"Josh was great. He was very helpful and address any issues very quickly. The apartment was great and close to great shops, dining, and light rail. We'd definitely stay again."
4707171,33366142,2015-05-27,27638263,WIlliam,The list was accurate. This was our first Airbnb. The house was spacious enough for four of us. We had nice staying in Seattle.
4707171,33633757,2015-05-30,34312561,Perry,"Josh was nice and easy to deal with. The accommodation was clean and supplied with pretty much anything we needed. Location was excellent as there was plenty of places to eat or drink within walking distance. It was only a short drive into the city
Thanks Josh"
4707171,33813129,2015-06-01,31762783,Mary Jean,"This rental was clean, comfortable and convenient to all the stores and restaurants of Columbia City.  The kitchen was fully stocked with everything we needed to make meals.  And the patio, living and dining room were very private and spacious for 4 adults.  No problems with check in or check out.  The owner  is easily reached for any issues (but we had none).  Great place!"
4707171,35636093,2015-06-21,28028763,Bryce,"Had a great stay at Josh's place. The place has everything you could need and a great location. Although we didn't have the chance to meet, everything was well organized to make our arrival and departure go smoothly.

Thanks again!"
4707171,36010813,2015-06-24,13485101,Marti,"Josh's place was very nice and cozy. It was a quiet neighborhood with super nice neighbors above and along the street. The house was good sized, enough space for 6 of us. Modern and well-kept. Easy travel to downtown."
4707171,36865531,2015-07-02,30097016,Jin,"This place was perfect for us! We were a family of four, two young children. We lived in Seattle previously and were looking to relive our old life near Columbia City. Josh stopped by and was welcoming and available, but didn't want to intrude in our 4 night stay. The house is just as described. My kids enjoyed the TV, which had Hulu Plus and other nice amenities, wireless was fast. We used the kitchen, dishwasher, and washing machine and dryer a lot. Beds were comfortable. Location was the best, less than 3 blocks from downtown Columbia City. Columbia City bakery every morning, our Geraldine's Counter is a family favorite or ours. Though no driveway, we never had trouble finding street parking in front of the house. The house is a large two floor house, and the entire first floor was ours. We would definitely stay here again."
4707171,37130661,2015-07-05,12091553,Elena,"The house was a perfect little place to stay. Unfortunately, the weather was unnaturally hot, so an air conditioner would have been nice, but the fan and open windows made it bearable. Everything was clean and presented nicely. We appreciated the help from Josh when we needed it! "
4707171,37572437,2015-07-08,34130902,Kai,Very nice apartment in a charming neighborhood. Everything was as advertised - and we didn't feel we were missing anything. We had a great time in Seattle.
4707171,37746717,2015-07-10,12678594,Letty,The home was everything it was advertised it to be. The neighborhood is delightful and we walked to dinner that evening. Our only issue was finding the key box in the dark and getting into it. Clearer instructions as to where it is would have been helpful.
4707171,38101490,2015-07-13,14882809,Lance,"Great neighborhood,  nice place, we enjoyed ourselves. Thanks Josh."
4707171,38370044,2015-07-15,28229411,Gordy,"Our host was wonderful, accommodating our late arrival and international communications challenges. The listing was as described, was very comfortable and clean, and perfectly located for our brief explorations of Seattle."
4707171,38693629,2015-07-18,20139562,일섭,모든게 설명한대로 였습니다. 아주 좋았습니다.
4707171,39001545,2015-07-20,6529320,Lisa,Josh was very responsive when we noted some issues with the unit - and took care of the problem personally. He even followed up the next day to make sure all was well. The apt is in a very convenient location.
4707171,39398454,2015-07-23,30543740,Melissa,The host was very quick on his response back to us about the place. Its in a nice quiet location. We had no problem checking in. It was nice of the host to have Netflix for us to enjoy. There was a lot of room for the five us that were travelling. Overall it was a good place to stay.
4707171,39736014,2015-07-26,29758620,Elaine,"Our party included 2 young families. Josh is very responsive and provided all the details we needed to prepare for our arrival. The location was perfect and only a 20 min light rail away from downtown.  We also had breakfast at a busy diner called Geraldine's Counter down the street and it was delicious. You know it is a busy joint when there is a wait at 845am on a Sunday.  Although we didn't need them (we brought our own), Josh provides 2 travel cribs.  The place had everything we needed for our little adventure."
4707171,40132903,2015-07-28,34304383,Caryn,"Josh's apartment was perfect for our family!  It's located just outside Seattle (only about 10-15 mins from the Space Needle).  It was a comfy  break from our vacation of campsites/hotel stops with a living room for the kids to relax in and watch movies and a full kitchen to make a meal in.  Beds were comfy, access to a washing machine, everything was very clean and it was quiet at night!  It was my favorite place to stay in the 6 states we visited during our visit!  Side note:  the neighborhood has several historic homes in the neighborhood if you take a walk.  Josh had a brochure in the cabinet under the TV about them."
4707171,41061702,2015-08-04,3085565,Gregory,"Josh made us feel very welcome. He gave us early access to the unit, responded quickly to any issues, and was very accommodating about departure times. Above all, we very much enjoyed access to his lovely home in a charming community. Thanks!"
4707171,42279981,2015-08-12,35852382,Huzefa,"Good location with wonderful downtown strip of restaurants, bars, bakery and supermarket within 10-15 min walk. Light rail is also very close and walking distance.

The apartment was bright and clean - no issues."
4707171,42833116,2015-08-16,32368811,Paola,"Josh was a great and attentive host. Never had the pleasure of meeting him, but would answer ALL my questions very quickly by email or text. 
The house is really lovely and in a great neighborhood.  The apartment is very spacious, and comes with lots and lots of linens for all your guests. We had three adults and one four year old sharing this space and never got in each-others way. Not that we were home for very long. Too much to explore!
The apartment is only a six block walk to the Rail, but there is also many many good places to explore in this neighborhood. I would want to stay here every time I visit Seattle. 
Great host, good place, wonderful location and Seattle is so very beautiful. "
4707171,43900572,2015-08-23,29129459,Gianni,"It was our first experience with Airbnb.  We were glad that we tried it with Josh.  He made everything easy with quick replies.   The apartment was located in a very quiet neighborhood.  There were free street parking spaces.  Neighbors were friendly.  There were restaurants nearby.  The apartment was bigger than we anticipated.  The beds were comfortable.  However, the ceiling was not soundproof so when the tenant turned on the TV in his bedroom, we heard it well.  But the overall experience was nice.  We would recommend this place to anyone."
4707171,44522919,2015-08-27,2960071,Isabelle,"The home is comfortable, clean, cheerful and well-appointed. We loved the location in Columbia City. Everything was perfect - thank you, Josh!"
4707171,45234478,2015-09-01,27286537,Nick,"Greeted by a sparkling clean household and neatly arranged utensils, along with comfortable beds we thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
4707171,45528252,2015-09-03,18250230,Danielle,The place was great-would definitely recommend for the future! 
4707171,45674095,2015-09-05,34781892,Jeremy,"Location was just perfect, just head down ranier into downtown for about 10 min and drops you right in. A short walk down to the stop signs get you coffee, columbia city bakery, italian, oyster happy hour and even carribbean jerk chicken ! In regards to the space, it was very well laid out. Tons of room, very clean and really captures the feel of the pacific northwest. Lastly take your car and drive 7 min to lake Washington for a nice scenic view of mercer island"
4707171,45940155,2015-09-07,17989008,Paulina,"This place was one of the best Air BnB places I stayed at. Everything was clean, organized, and beautiful. Beds were super comfy. We appreciated the soaps and shampoos Josh left out for us. Josh was a great host as he was friendly when meeting us and quick to respond to messages. Our place was located in a lovely neighborhood near awesome restaurants and coffee shops. What a beautiful place! We loved the green garden and trees. I will definitely stay here again and recommend others to stay here."
4707171,46284733,2015-09-09,27871669,Debra,"Clean, refreshing,  close to downtown Columbia City eateries and shops. Every morning of our stay we go to the Columbia  City  Bakery for coffee and anything we want made fresh.  Josh is very accessible,  and provided a fan upon my arrival from my request from my previous stay in april, lol, I was so pleased he remembered.  Clean crisp linens, I will never stay where washer and dryer is not provided and his is in the kitchen, sooo convenient,  you won't go wrong, especially with his price and perks!"
4707171,47037334,2015-09-15,35643006,Allie,"This place was great! So comfy and cozy, open floor plan, great for our daughter to crawl around on! Josh responded to any questions we had, quickly, and even brought over an iron and ironing board when we inquired about it. The location is great, with only a short walk to a lot of things. A few more mirrors in the house would be great, but overall the place was wonderful! Thanks, Josh, for having our first Airbnb experience be a great one!"
4707171,47952627,2015-09-22,14484568,Ben,"This Columbia City apartment turned out to be absolutely perfect for our family. We were in town for a week visiting family and had a wonderful stay at Josh's apartment. It was a great location, a clean and well-furnished and equipped apartment. If we return to Seattle, we will be sure to check this listing as early as possible to ensure we can stay again!"
4707171,48504274,2015-09-27,35529206,Wilson,The listing description was very accurate. The neighborhood was quaint and homey. Very close to restaurants and bars. We were very happy when we got to the place to see that preparations were made to make us feel at home including a letter to direct us towards the location of everything in the house as well as fresh towels being left on the bed for us. We were blown away by how great this place looked. The host was very quick to respond to our questions and very accommodating to our requests during our stay. I would definitely love to stay here again. This was our first Airbnb experience and it was amazing! Thanks Josh!
4707171,49000732,2015-09-30,29074129,LeAnn,The apartment was lovely and offered the space we needed for a relaxing stay. The location was ideal. We loved the neighborhood and the ease of accessing the Light Rail.
4707171,49583917,2015-10-05,29190413,Kerry,"Couldn't have asked for a better arrangement.  The house was clean, comfortable, accommodating, and in a quiet residential area. We enjoyed walking the neighborhood and the accessibility to the Light Rail System.  The distance to the Light Rail and walking the small hill to the house could be uncomfortable to less mobile elderly folk (my mother was 85) but the rest of the family had no problems.  Josh politely checked in to see that all was well and if anything was needed.  Had a lovely time and wouldn't hesitate to use this location again.  "
4707171,51897515,2015-10-25,9920731,Ruthann,"Attempting to arrange our trip around the birth of our first grandbaby made us, I'm afraid, the classic high-maintenance guests when planning our most recent trip to Seattle. Josh was always quick to reply to our inquiries and totally accommodating. His comfortable apartment in Columbia City was an easy walk to restaurants, shops, bus and rail lines. Additionally, the kitchen was well stocked, including knives and cookware to be envied! I look forward to our next visit!"
4707171,52734963,2015-11-01,1302438,Sarah,Loved this place! Stocked with everything you need and walking distance to great coffee shops and restaurants. We walked to the train and were downtown in no time. Check in was smooth with our very late arrival. Josh was super fast to respond to questions. Highly recommended.
4707171,53963977,2015-11-15,8567178,Alison,This apartment suited our needs really well.  We were two adults with traveling with a one-year-old and an almost two-year-old so the availability of a washer/dryer was really helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.
4707171,55185529,2015-11-29,13528136,Chester,Josh's place was perfect a perfect neighborhood spot to stay in Seattle.  It was a clean easy to use and cozy apartment that allowed us access to the nearby neighborhood of Columbia City and nearby parks. 
4707171,56312307,2015-12-12,1164761,Rosalie,"This is a great place to stay - lots of room, super clean, good light, smart TV and internet, great neighborhood and close to light rail. We are 100% satisfied."
4707171,57755752,2015-12-29,4549254,Lynette,"My in-laws actually stayed in Josh's place and had a great time. There were a couple of details that weren't perfect, but otherwise they reported it back as a wonderful stay! Josh was very accommodating and easy to work with even with several of us contacting him for questions. "
2520890,13126464,2014-05-19,13010263,Greg,"We sent Amie a booking request while driving down from Vancouver and had received a response and confirmed the details before hitting the border! Amie was there to meet us when we arrived and had taken care of everything. 

The room is amazing, lovely lighting with plenty of windows and our own private bathroom and temperature controls. The bed was nice and comfortable with plenty of blankets, we slept really well and didn't wake up till late. The location was easy to get to from the I-5 and seemed close to lots of attractions, it is a quiet neighborhood so sleeping in was not an issue.

Amie was happy to recommend a local cafe for breakfast, Both Ways Cafe, I would eat there every day if I lived in Seattle.

Overall it was a 10/10 experience, great hospitality, great room.

 "
2520890,13260858,2014-05-23,2414844,Jocelyn,"Amie, Owen and Elza (what a cutie-pie!) prepared a fantastic getaway for us. From the sweet little vase of roses and apples in a bowl, to the coffee and tea - with organic stevia available! - and fluffy towels. I especially appreciated the clean sheets, towels and bath products without scents and chemicals, and the bins for recycling and compost. Such rare finds! There were books about Seattle trees, local hikes and foraging at the bedside. Many thoughtful touches and ideas for tiny house living. Amie was a delight to communicate and visit with, too. A great private retreat in the heart of a diverse Seattle neighborhood - we highly recommend it. "
2520890,13384497,2014-05-26,7660318,Brenda,Amie was super gracious when my reservations needed to be changed. I look forward to booking with her in the future! 
2520890,13497840,2014-05-28,15982716,Maxine,"Amie was a kind and generous host and the apartment warm, cozy and private.  Sleeping with the night breezes wafting in and waking to the murmur of the chickens was a treat.  I would happily stay at Passiflora Farm again."
2520890,13827198,2014-06-05,10980230,Philo,"It was truly a blessing to have found Passiflora Farm and its beautiful inhabitants, hosts, Amie & Owen, Elza their one-year old, whose very presence lit up my world, Felix the gentle house cat (don't rev up your motor engines - it terrifies him), egg laying chickens that announce their egg delivery, almost instantly, and the great hospitality and warmth encompassed in this urban farm-like setting.   Amie was most helpful sending me website links prior to my arrival, which helped me prioritize my 9-day stay in Seattle an interesting, productive one.  Without her help, I might not quite have succeeded in accomplishing my primary goal of visiting the Hoh Rainforest on the Olympic Peninsula.  Owen had picked up bus schedules to ease my travel, and by the way, Passiflora Farm is very accessible to downtown and most places of interest. It is walking distance to  the grocery with interesting restaurants close by, and on clear days, you can even catch a view of the majestic Mt. Rainier riding back home on the very frequent bus #7.  

The private accommodation was ideal with its attached bath and the necessary comfort to find peace and respite after scouring the city sights.  Don't mind the chickens when they announce the egg(s) delivery, which also means it's time to get up to start the day for another adventure.

From the day I arrived, having been picked up with a truly warm welcome by Amie and Elza, who incidentally had been roused from her nap, yet wearing that most delightful, heart-melting smile, to the day they saw me off heading to the airport, my fond memories of this visit to Seattle will be etched as evergreen as the state of Washington.  It was worth the trip!"
2520890,14130690,2014-06-12,16048071,Sam,"Our experience with the host is biased just a little.  She is our daughter, and the mother off our newest grand daughter who turned one over our stay. Need we say a lot more.  It is all perfect.
My wife and I appreciate the privacy and intimacy of the room and surrounding common room as well as the casualness of the gardens of native flowers as well as cactus gardens she cultivates in an urban environment.
We know Seattle well and the proximity to the busses, light rail and major arterials make the location ideal for staying and playing anytime."
2520890,14446371,2014-06-19,16223104,Michael,"I LOVED my stay here. If you don't mind walking, there are many things less than a mile away. Downtown Seattle was very easy to get to via the train, which is about a 10-15 minute walk away. The room was great and private. Amie was very accommodating. Due to my schedule, I didn't see her much, but when I did, she always asked how I was, how the room was, and how my trip was. I would recommend this to any one of my friends and anyone who reads this. You won't be disappointed. Also, try to make Elza laugh, it's one of the best things ever."
2520890,15082928,2014-07-01,803526,Ivar Nelson & Phoebe,"Amie and family provided a delightful retreat, marred only by our not being able to stay longer. The guest room is in peaceful garden surroundings, with a fascinating neighborhood just around the corner.  We hope to return soon, and highly recommend this haven."
2520890,15693921,2014-07-14,11457956,Melissa,"We stayed for 3 nights at the Passiflora Farm Guest Room. Amie is a thoughtful host who is quick to respond to messages.  The room itself is quite cozy and comfortable. I loved that it was very airy and that the windows let a lot of light in.  The chickens are so cute, and they didn't make any noise (at least while we were there).  There is a cute sitting area in front of the guest room and the grounds are very peaceful. The location is great and we liked the fact that it was very close to some wonderful eateries - we had a delicious brunch close by in Columbia City. "
2520890,15887179,2014-07-17,17692145,Jaclyn,"We very much enjoyed our stay. Our host was very accommodating as we had a late arrival and departure. She was extremely responsive to any questions we had. And, we enjoyed the use of organic products used throughout the guest suite. "
2520890,16067239,2014-07-21,15529973,Hillary,"This was our first time booking a place through airb&b and our first time taking our 8 month old on a trip to Seattle. I picked Passiflora farm because it looked family friendly and sweet and it was close to our friend's wedding. We were so happy to find that not only was Passiflora farm beautiful but super cozy & comfy too. Amie & her family are lovely & thoughtful hosts. She even left our baby Henry a play crib to use with toys & a beautiful quilt just for him, so sweet! We were only in Seattle for one night but my husband said he would have loved to stay the week and I agreed. We'll be back for sure. "
2520890,16417554,2014-07-27,4394332,Jonathan,"Amie was such a kind and welcoming host.  She has a beautiful family!  The farm guest room is just as it is described in the picture... we even met her 4 chickens on our way out.  It is private.  I would highly recommend Amie as a host, but the space itself had some issues.  I would be lying if I didn't mention that we felt limited to only our bedroom once inside.  The space itself is much larger but not fully finished to allow us to really enjoy the larger living area.  Our other bigger gripe just had to do with cleanliness and the layout of the bathroom... the toilet is in the shower!  This is a bit of a design flaw in our opinion as one person couldn't shower while the other was in the toilet, nor would you really want to shower after someone finished their business in there.  The water from the shower head goes directly to the toilet... so it's also entirely wet afterwards.  Other than that, the place is welcoming (books and organic shampoo/conditioner) and close enough (15 min hike) to the link rail stop.  Not the safest looking neighborhood, but a nice walk nonetheless."
2520890,17511726,2014-08-13,10078781,Jessica,"We loved our stay in the Passiflora guest room! Amie was such a genuinely kind and generous person who went out of her way to make our stay as comfortable and easy as possible. Communication with her was excellent and she provided us will all necessary information. The room itself was very adequate for myself and my two small children (ages 1 and 3). Amie provided us with a pack n play as well as a beautiful handmade quilt, toys, and books. Amie's little girl is just delightful and charmed all of us. The bathroom is a really interesting design and great for long showers. The organic amenities were greatly appreciated! We spent time outside either using the table and chairs, observing the chickens, or smelling the herbs. The neighborhood is full of diverse restaurants but also convenient for grocery stores, etc. It's also a quick and easy ride up to Capitol Hill. Overall, I highly recommend Passiflora Farm as your place to stay in Seattle!"
2520890,19104343,2014-09-06,20704736,Gabriele,"It was pretty late in the evening, when We knocked at Amie's house. She was very kind and took us to the apartment. We really liked  it. It is cozy and cute, surrounded by trees, in a very good position: Downtown is only ten minutes driving.
The bed is comfortable.
The day We left Amie gave us some information to continue our trip.
A pretty nice experience."
2520890,19287647,2014-09-09,2929444,Jennifer,"I booked this  for my father who was visiting us from out of town. Amie was easy to connect with and made Dad feel welcome, as did her partner. My dad was happy with the room, the privacy, the yard, and interested in the solar and chickens. He enjoyed his stay. Thank you!"
2520890,19707322,2014-09-16,1906755,Family,"Amie and Owen are excellent hosts and a very creative couple. The room is very comfortable (especially the futon bed) and beautifully decorated.
The location is slightly out of the center, but for this you get a unique farm-like experience in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
2520890,19754183,2014-09-17,14949520,Josh,"Wonderful place to stay! Everything was just as described, if not better. Amie was a great host. Delicious complementary coffee as well. Only wish we stayed longer!"
2520890,20854437,2014-10-06,21137870,Cole,"Amie and Owen were excellent hosts! They were quick to respond to messages and very attentive during our stay. The farm was the perfect setting for our stay in Seattle, and we can't wait for our next chance to spend time here! The beautiful pictures in the listing only show a taste of how great this space really is. The guest room was well stocked and immaculate, and the farm itself always had interesting things to wonder about. Amie and Owen have created an urban oasis that shows they are very conscious, intentional individuals."
2520890,25948616,2015-01-30,26334154,Ginger,"Amie made us feel quite welcome despite our arrival in the dark. She gave excellent directions. Directions were important as there is an easy to unload entry, and then separate parking zone with steps to the location. The room was comfortable, we had hot pot, coffee, and fridge for our left overs! The combo shower toilet was of interest to us so we were fine with that, besides, the shower had in-floor heat which was so nice! The room was as described, separate yet inside a larger old garage that has been updated for various uses (artists, builders take note!) The extra space outside the enclosed bedroom was so helpful as my husband and I were at the end of our trip and needed to package up lots of goodies to ship out! Their internet worked great considering the room is a separate building from the main house. The garden was lush, even in January- rosemary and lavender, mmmm! Being a gardener myself, I wish I had more time to spend with Amie, but alas, so much to do in Seattle! The neighborhood is full of international food and easy to navigate to other parts of the city. It was also fairly quiet for being urban. One note to lighter sleepers, two blocks away is a Dairygold plant and distribution center. The trucks come and go all night and once I realized what it was, I rested well. (side note, their cream is great, just cream and milk, no extra thickeners!) I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for an easy going, garden in the city, decent parking, and homemade custom remodel experience. Amie and her family have some talent!"
2520890,31983257,2015-05-12,20118621,Kristin,"Amie was super friendly and helpful with great suggestions on where to go. Enjoyed meeting Owen and cute Elza, too.  The Garden Guest Room was cozy and comfortable with many nice touches, including a heated bathroom floor.  Lovely patio and gardens just outside the room, too.  Within walking distance of many great Columbia City restaurants/cafe's.  We had a wonderful time!"
2520890,34787573,2015-06-12,32140688,Michael,Amie was a wonderful host. She was very thoughtful in picking us up from the Starbucks located near her house. The room was exactly as described. Beautiful and comfortable. The heated floor in the bathroom was inviting after a day of sight seeing. She had replaced the futon with a very comfortable bed. Amie was great at sharing some of the highlights Seattle Has to offer. Link rail and public transportation was easy to master to navigate Seattle.  We would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to our friends!
2520890,36239435,2015-06-26,33309978,Rachel,We had a lovely stay! The room was just as described and an added bonus was the anointing space with sofas and space for our toddler to run around. Perfect! Amie very kindly left out some toddler books and toys for our daughter. Our car broke down and Amie's husband came to the rescue and got us back on the road! Such a lovely family! 
2520890,37209717,2015-07-05,1797684,Anton,"So this was our 1st AirBNB experience and we weren't sure what to expect. SOOO glad we did it and stayed here! They were amazing in every way. First the private room & shower; very easy to get to, very neat and clean, and SUPER comfortable bed. The shower was really nice with a heated floor too. The best part was that we could come and go anytime without disturbing them because it's a separate building right of their house. They have a fridge and microwave in there as well as some really good coffee & coffee pot. While we were there they said if we needed anything they would help out, or if we want to be left alone, they would give us space. We sat and talked for a while a few days. I would highly recommend staying here if you come to Seattle. They sure made us feel comfortable in every way and we would come back again."
2520890,39634684,2015-07-25,35187856,Brody,Amie and Owen are very warm and hospitable hosts. They are very friendly and very helpful on the logistics of getting around. They are full of great ideas of things to do and see in and around the Seattle area and beyond.
2520890,41618724,2015-08-08,36129371,Johannes,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it couldn’t have been better. The room is great, and the privacy of having the entire barn to ourselves was an added bonus. The bed was very comfortable and large enough for two tall persons. Amie was a great, kind and helpful host. It also was quite easy to get to downtown Seattle with the train. A huge supermarket and Lake Washington are both within walking distance. We would definitely stay there again."
2520890,42411167,2015-08-13,28600389,Kristopher,"I stayed in the Passiflora Garden Guest Room while attending a conference in downtown Seattle. 

I didn't rent a car, and so relied entirely on public transit. The nearest light rail stop to the room is the Columbia City station; it's a hilly 0.8 miles to the room from the station. The light rail gets you to downtown or to the airport in less than 20min and trains arrive frequently. I also rented a bicycle from (website hidden) (highly recommend, their rates are good and they deliver/pickup).

The neighborhood is nice enough. There are a lot of restaurants in walking distance. It's not too far from the water.

The space is lovely. It's in a barn with a couple couches and plenty of open floor space. The room itself is just off the main barn room. It has a bed big enough for two, a mini fridge, a coffee maker (I think there was coffee in the fridge), and a bathroom/shower stall. The floor of the bathroom is heated, which might be a nice thing in the colder months, but isn't super useful when the weather is really warm. The toilet is located in the shower stall, which I guess might make some things more convenient and some things less convenient. 

My interactions with Amie and Owen were minimal and pleasant. Their wireless router went down shortly after I arrived and they made sure I had access to an alternate network for all of my netflixing needs.

The only gripe I can come up with is that, because the room catches the afternoon sun, it gets fairly warm in the evenings, and while I saw what looked like a little heater in the room, I didn't see an AC unit. Not a huge issue though, especially in the cooler/cloudier months of the year.

I would definitely stay there again."
2520890,43255295,2015-08-18,36792929,Sunny,It was a really lovely place to stay at. Good access to various transportation. I would recommend to stay at Amie's place if anyone is visiting in Seattle. 
2520890,45325028,2015-09-01,42041182,Henry,"It was really easy to get the keys (zero interaction with owner), so that was great.  I should note that the house number is printed on the mailbox outside the place (I had trouble finding it initially).  Very interesting decorations inside the place too."
2520890,46176949,2015-09-08,28709986,Bl,Your place worked perfectly for us. Very convenient location for all the business we had to do. Comfortable and relaxing while we were there. Sorry that we never actually got to meet you. When in Seattle would like to stay again. 
2520890,47073347,2015-09-15,31939785,Nicola,"We had a fantastic stay in Amies garden guest room. It's a very beautiful and spacious room and our hosts were nothing but helpful, generous and kind. "
2520890,50657628,2015-10-13,32065175,Trace,"Amie and her partner were excellent hosts! Amie welcomed us and showed us around when we got there and was always in communication with us if we needed anything. 

The room was clean and cozy and perfect for the two of us (especially after a long day of exploring Seattle)! It was in a great location: close to the airport and within easy access of the freeway (perfect for our adventures to the - relatively local - national parks).

We would certainly stay again the next time we travel to Seattle!"
2520890,54287336,2015-11-17,6129228,Ashley,"Exceeded expectations. Really very comfortable and cozy, all you need. We especially loved the recreational rock wall and super yummy tea choices! Only a couple blocks to the Lightrail was wicked convenient. Very quiet and private. "
6425537,34468185,2015-06-08,5609236,Deborah,"Kylie made communication easy, arranged a meeting place to get the key to the apartment to us, and provdied written instructions of how to find and access her apartment. The apartment was located right by the light rail so was perfect both for getting to downtown or to the airport. It was quiet, and although small, had everything that we needed. It could have been cleaner however as both the ktichen and bathroom were quite dirty. We are easy going so we didn't mind, but this might turn other people off."
6425537,36404074,2015-06-28,24802644,Mike,"We stayed at Kylie's for a couple weeks, and we had a great experience.  Very conveniently located on the light rail, it's a short ride in to the city.  Nice building too with everything you could want.  We had a small internet issue that she was very responsive about and helped us take care of extremely quickly.  It's a bit more ""lived in"" than most places I've stayed, so I wouldn't recommend it for a neat freak, but other than that it's a great place to stay, and I would happily do so again."
6425537,36625707,2015-06-29,36566300,Emily,Kylie was very helpful and prompt with communication. She was friendly and accommodating. Her place is conveniently located across the street from the light rail station to put visitors minutes away from downtown- this worked great on our visit. It is perfect little place for a couple on a weekend getaway.
6425537,37586419,2015-07-08,30677483,Tony,"This is my very first experience with Airbnb.  My host Kylie was very nice and responsive with my questions before arrival. She greeted me when I arrived the apartment.  Although the apartment is only about 500 sq ft but it's clean and I only need a place to sleep. Unfortunately the days I stayed there was the record hottest days of the year.  The apartment is on the top floor without air conditioning, it was too hot for me to sleep on the first night but the following few nights seem to be fine.  The best part was I have a car and Kylie let me use the private gated garage just step from the door entrance.  Kylie had provided everything I needed in the apartment, it's like living in your own apartment.  My first Airbnb experience was indeed a good one. "
6425537,38055405,2015-07-12,3283236,Jeffrey,"Kylie is friendly and attentive, she made sure me and my wife were comfortable and answered all our questions and concerns. The studio was spotless and very inviting. It's located near the bus line and you can travel to downtown Seattle by foot."

8578023,50541149,2015-10-12,37281186,Frank,"Lucy's place is incredible! I had an excellent time in Seattle and I couldn't have chosen a better place to stay. They neighborhood is nice, the view is incredible, and while I never got to meet Lucy, I was told she is very nice and friendly. I absolutely recommend this place! Thanks Lucy!"
8578023,51057250,2015-10-17,18669001,Elizabeth,"Easily the best AirBnB I have stayed in thus far!! Lucy's was a perfect host. Her home was immaculate and had an incredible view! She left us some breakfast foods in the fridge saying that we could help ourselves to and guides to give us ideas as to how to get around Seattle as well as helpful hints. Communication was a dream. The only flaw was that there was no cable, but the place was wifi ready and had a dvd player as well plenty of board games to keep us occupied for the occasional early night in. I absolutely recommend this apartment. It is spacious and feels very safe. It looks just like the pictures!"
8578023,51369904,2015-10-19,44461045,Tawny,"Lucy helped us to feel like we were at home. The neighborhood was nice and it was within close proximity to downtown. Everything was great except for the parking situation. There was only street parking available and the streets were completely full when we came in for the night. Other than that, the stay was great. Neighbors were quiet and the apartment/condo was very nice. "
8578023,51949550,2015-10-25,9988464,Tammy,This condo was really wonderful and homey! Great location in Queen Anne and Lucy was a wonderful host. She was very helpful with suggestions and just made us feel very welcome!
8578023,53987205,2015-11-15,46226596,Anja,"Lucy and her condo were great! The place looks exactly like the pictures and the view really is that amazing! Lucy herself was very available via text/email when we had questions. Her neighborhood is great, the oldest in Seattle, so it's absolutely beautiful and is not far from downtown and other sites like the Space Needle and Kerry Park. We also had a later flight and she was very flexible about making that work with us. This was my friend and I's first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better!  "
8578023,54613725,2015-11-22,46029545,Isaias,"Lucy went above and beyond to make us feel right at home. Her place was nicely decorated and extremely clean, with an awesome view of the Space Needle and Mt. Rainier! Lucy was more than happy to accommodate our needs and gave us full access to the kitchen and the fridge. Thanks again for the bananas! She made sure to explain how everything worked before she left and made herself readily available for any questions we might have. Would definitely recommend Lucy and her place to anyone wanting to stay in Seattle! "
8578023,55855524,2015-12-06,46502309,Nicole,"Lucy was a very kind and gracious host! We enjoyed our time in Seattle immensely and Lucy and her home were two of the reasons why. It was so clean and inviting and had everything one could need. She left fruit, bread and peanut butter for breakfast and the best part was she had it decorated for Christmas. That was the icing on the cake! Beautiful tree and lights glittering on the mantle really made it feel like the holidays. The furniture is very comfortable and the views spectacular! You can see the Space Needle from the patio door! Lucy had great communication with us the whole time, we enjoyed everything! Thank you Lucy, we will be coming back and hopefully your place will be available when we do. Merry Christmas and have a very happy New Year!!!!

Best,
Nicole and Brian Clemens"
8578023,56423281,2015-12-13,43689730,Nick,"Lucy made her home readily available and comfortable. Her home has a beautiful view of the Seattle skyline and particular the space needle.
Lucy wrote very nice notes for us that gave us direction and instructions on locking up, Wi-Fi etc. She even left us some goodies which was a nice touch. Although we did not get to me Lucy, she seems super nice and caring. "
8578023,56923492,2015-12-20,40324810,Meryl,Lucy was responsive and helpful. Her apartment was welcoming and comfortable.
6882518,44262463,2015-08-24,42095973,Daniel,"This is a great apartment at a great location, close to the action in Capitol Hill and downtown, but tucked in a much quieter block. The apartment has a very modern feel, clean and without clutter.  Reginald made the stay easy and relaxed. Very much appreciate the availability."
