251922,39147848,2015-07-21,26135791,Jessica,I really enjoyed my stay. This home is cozy with a great back deck and perfectly located in West Seattle. 
251922,39434465,2015-07-23,35436385,Jose Luis,It made our trip to Seattle.   Edwin house is just what we needed.  My brother and I both had our own separate bedrooms.  This was my first time using Airbnb and the post it  notes left by Edwin were very helpful.   I would definitely recommend this house to anyone who is visiting the Seattle area.   Thank you so much Edwin.
251922,40078600,2015-07-28,29476462,Lila,"Had a great experience for our 1st time on Airbnb. Sleepy North Admiral in West Seattle was really comfortable. The beds were comfy, felt like home away from home.  Very clean.  Thanks Ed !!"
251922,41071119,2015-08-04,16034547,Eleanor,"As a family of 4 staying here, it was perfect for our needs. It was a place we could come back to after exploring Seattle and we welcomed the evening tranquility of West Seattle. We managed to work out the shuttle buses and ferries to get us around when the hill was a bit of a challenge after a long day of walking! Edwin's place is very comfortable and in a peaceful residential area close to the beach/bars."
251922,42266890,2015-08-12,34659584,John,"We enjoyed our stay in West Seattle and would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Easy access to the city, a neighborhood feel, and a beautiful shoreline with food/recreation/entertainment made this a great experience."
251922,42827428,2015-08-16,7179062,Karen,"The house was cozy and clean, and notes left in key places made everything clear that we needed to know, while coffee, snacks and basic condiments were stocked for us. While we didn't get to spend much time in the house, it was perfect for the one rainy morning, hanging out with Edwin's library of art books and the collection of Seattle info.  The nights were peaceful, and the neighborhood is great, very close to the thick forests of Schmitz Park, the beach at Alki, and a mile walk or short drive to the water taxi to downtown, which saved us from Seattle's traffic problems.  Next time we want to explore nearby California Street, as it was full of interesting shops and restaurants we had to pass by.  We'll be back if it's still available!"
251922,43401270,2015-08-19,38681432,Clyde,We had a real nice time at the Sleepy Admiral.  It is a little house in a quiet neighborhood just across the bridge from downtown Seattle.  The beds were comfortable and there was coffee and bagels for breakfast. We couldn't ask for more. 
251922,44901348,2015-08-30,5088841,Samantha,Ed as a host and the 2 bedroom stay were both wonderful. Ed had all kinds of extras included like bagels and everything needed in the bathroom. It was in a quiet neighborhood and perfect to go hang on the Alki beach. Enjoyed our comfortable stay.
251922,45777999,2015-09-06,35174208,Lina,"Edwin Lebel made us welcome by leaving all the accommodations of being in our own home including coffee, bagels and snacks. His house was very clean and equipped with all the extras that we could never have if we had stayed in a one room hotel. "
251922,46699746,2015-09-13,13565479,Sabine,"We had a very nice stay at Edwin's place.  Communication upfront was very good and arriving two days late due to a pilot strike has been no problem at all. Everything was perfectly prepared for us.
The place is very nice and clean just as described and sitting on the large deck in perfect Seattle weather was very relaxing !
Location is perfect for day trips in any direction. 
We sure hope to return some day."
251922,47664092,2015-09-21,30745384,Aaron,"The location and space were amazing. It's a mile walk from the Alki beach and the water taxi. A Safeway is .5 miles away. I would definitely recommend staying here. The only issue we had was with accidentally disturbing Edwin on our last night their. We had some light music and we're playing cards and talking but the sound traveled through the floors and kept Edwin up. due to the way sound travels in the house, If you stay here I would suggest hanging out on the Alki beach instead of in the house of its during quite hours. "
251922,48446588,2015-09-26,44043443,Ye,"Made the right choice for our stay in Seattle. Very convenient location. Ed prepared tea, coffee, cup noodles for our breakfast. We love the paint and flowers in the house. We will definitely stay here again next time we return. "
251922,48702045,2015-09-28,39393811,Glennis,"Everything about Edwin's place was outstanding. Location was perfect for dining in and out, sightseeing and comfort. His hospitality made us feel at home. I highly recommend the roomy and charming house. Loved that parking was no problem. He is a great ar t ist as you will see."
251922,50272759,2015-10-11,36829304,Shiju,"Nice place , and good location."
251922,50753653,2015-10-14,5581679,Katie,Ed's place did just the trick for 2 days in Seattle. We were close to downtown and everything was in order when we arrived...there was even tea and there were bagels on the house! The beds were also comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. It is an older home.
251922,51152459,2015-10-18,5231958,Venus,"We had a nice stay at Edwin's place. The house was older, yet really clean and really well-decorated. We never actually got to see Edwin, but we enjoyed our stay there. The beds were comfy with high quality beddings. The bagels and juice in the fridge was a sweet add-on. I also like its location is close to California Ave where all of the cute stores and restaurants are. 

The only thing that was less than perfect, and I'm being super picky here, is the hot water runs fast at the house. So if anybody in your group just took a long shower/bath, you might want to wait another 20 minutes or so to take yours. 

Other than that, it was a great stay! I highly recommend it. 
"
251922,51743951,2015-10-24,25648230,Marlou,"Thanks Edwin for giving us a home in West Seattle. We liked very much to stay in that place with different easy access possibilities to downtown Seattle - even West Seattle and Alki Beach are worth to get to know, too.

We appreciated all the complimentary items as coffee from Seattle, milk, orange Juice and bagels. Furthermore we want to point out the good quality of the mattresses of the two beds.

If you are looking for a well equipped house during your stay located convenient to downtown Seattle we recommend to choose this place.

The communication with Edwin was great even we didn't met him in person. We were too busy :-) But when we needed his help he supported us promptly."
251922,51875634,2015-10-24,14439218,Liz,"Ed was really nice, he was working in his shop when we arrived. He is great with communication. The house was clean. The neighborhood was nice, quiet and safe, and a good location. We only stayed one night so didn't have a chance to explore too much, but California street has great restaurants and shops and it is really close by. "
251922,53259296,2015-11-07,4687054,Jan,"Edwin was fabulous in his communication with me before, during and after our stay.  The house was perfect for us as we needed a bit of space to get organized for a lengthy trip to Europe.  Our storage unit is in Auburn and we could get to the storage in less than 45 minutes.  The location was also fabulous for South Center where we also had to do several things.

My husband is from Seattle and he wasn't sure about the location but honestly, we were thrilled as it was quiet, yet centrally located to all the major highways.

The beds were super comfortable and I have never seen (in 8 years of traveling around the world) towels so beautifully folded and such an abundance of them!  It was fabulous!

It is an older house so it has its creaks and groans but it is in very good condition and it is obvious that Edwin takes great pride in its upkeep.

The place was exactly what we needed and as portrayed in the photos and we hope to be able to stay again the next time we are passing back through Seattle.  "
251922,53681687,2015-11-11,43270375,Xinhe,"Beautiful, comfortable and spacious apartment which shows marvelous taste of Edwin. Too bad we had to leave earlier than previously planned due to a family emergency. If we have another chance to come to Seattle in the future, we'll definitely choose Ed's place again."
9511777,55290690,2015-11-29,92879,Jen,"Excellent location - walking distance to tons of restaurants, shops, and close to freeway to get elsewhere in town. Nice place -- modern/new construction. Greg was easy to contact and communicate with -- even when he was on a plane! Read the fine print, especially about parking (look up online parking rules & find a place on the side of the street where they don't require a parking permit). Also, as Greg notes in the description, there are cameras watching you -- you gotta figure out if that'll work for you or not."
1030615,4059504,2013-04-06,466099,Romain,"We had a wonderful time at Rochelle's place! The house is located in one of the best and most beautiful area of Seattle, close to all of the restaurants, bars and cafés of Broadway and 15th. The house is huge, very clean, beautifully decorated  and with nice and cute little balconies everywhere. Rochelle has been a perfect host. She picked us up with her car and drove us around the neighborhood to make sure we wouldn't miss any of the cool spots around. We would definitely come back on our next trip to Seattle!"
1030615,4174493,2013-04-15,5266295,Jaimie,"I was in Seattle for a quick music trip and Rochelle's place was centrally located.  It was easy to find and comfortable.  I didn't spend much time at the house, but when I was there, Rochelle had anything I might need available.  It was a great experience and I would definitely stay there again.

I especially enjoyed the fresh flowers :-)"
1030615,4256752,2013-04-22,1750612,Frederik,This is a perfect place to stay. The room is very comfortable (private bathroom) and the kitchen was free to use. It is a great place for enjoying Capitol Hill.
1030615,4329364,2013-04-28,1758166,Cherie,"5 shiny gold stars to Rochelle for being, I am sure, exactly what Airbnb desires for a host.  We reserved both the Garden Room and the 3rd Floor Room for our mini, two night, East coast / West coast family reunion. All agreed - this Airbnb home is immaculate and in a wonderful Capitol Hill location.  Tucked back from the street, the home is both private and quiet.  Rochelle specializes in details - lovely fresh flowers, bottled water, a parking pass, bus schedules etc.  In the communal kitchen were assorted coffees, teas and fresh fruit.  Communication before we arrived, as well as during our stay, was great.  Her dining suggestions were spot on for what we were looking for. Having MCS (multiple chemical sensitivities) I am always concerned re: fragrances and environmental triggers - such as paint, carpeting, cleaning products, etc.  Rochelle was more than accommodating.  She specially washed linens and towels in fragrance free detergent.   She provided a fan and had the windows open as an extra precaution.  Also, Rochelle advised me as to the age of and products used in furnishing her home; I had no problems with anything.  She has a lovely, uncluttered, fresh style of decorating.  We hope to visit Seattle again.  Without a doubt, I will check her availability before choosing dates.
Thanks so very much, Rochelle, for everything!

1030615,4345006,2013-04-29,3251430,Corinna,"Rochelle's house was amazing! It was super clean, comfortable, and in a great location. There are a lot of nice bars and restaurants in walking distance. Rochelle was super friendly, and very quick to respond to my questions. She was a great host!! "
1030615,4420222,2013-05-04,1783024,Rebecca,"Loved staying at Rochelle's place. Her house is lovely, right near a ton of great restaurants / bars, yet nicely tucked away beside Volunteer park. Rochelle was very accommodating, and had great recommendations for the neighbourhood. 

Private bathroom, very comfy bed, safe, clean, and quiet— it was perfection. I will definitely stay here again. "
1030615,4460687,2013-05-06,16220,Angela,"Rochelle's place was great! The house was tidy, clean, comfortable and super easy to find. The room is exactly how it appears in the photos. She had left some snacks for us (fruit, tea, granola bars and yogurt) in the kicthen and also had some toiletries like shampoo, conditionner and shower gel. Very nice touch!
The neighbourhood is very walkable. A short walk from her house you can find numerous cafes and restaurants and Volunteer Park. 
She is the hostess with the mostess! I would stay here again in a heartbeat. :)"
1030615,4576773,2013-05-13,5965583,Nathalie,"Me and my friend Jessie absolutely loved our stay at Rochelles place.  Her home is very welcoming, lovely and spotless.  We will definately recommend her to all our friends & family.  Her house is idealy located: just outside the center so it is quiet enough and yet close enough to do everything by foot or bus (and the busstop is right outside the door).  
But that is just housing & location.  What we loved most about our visit was Rochelle herself.   She made us feel welcome in her home, she took the time to chat with us, gave us an insight on Seattle & America and helped us plan different trips.  
I absolutely love her and I hope I can stay with her again in the future."
1030615,4682202,2013-05-20,5797093,Erin,"My husband I spent three nights in the ""Paris"" room. Our accommodations were impeccably clean and spacious. Rochelle was quick to respond to all of my inquiries, communicative, and super friendly. She went above and beyond leaving water bottles in our room, offering coffee, tea and yogurt in the kitchen, and dispensing detailed recommendations of fun places to visit. I would 100% recommend staying with Rochelle on your next visit to Seattle! Plus, her townhouse was in a great location, walking distance to tons of restaurants and bars."
1030615,4841652,2013-05-28,6216758,Annette,"Rochelle was fantastic!! I highly recommend her place and would stay there again for sure.  Rochelle made my girlfriend and I feel right at home and was always happy to recommend places to see, eat and drink. Rochelle knows Seattle very well and was always available when I'd ask her questions via text or in person.  She was super nice!  The room was very quiet, private and comfortable for two. Rochelle even had water, chocolate and flowers welcoming us upon arrival. Sweet! Location of the place is great, super safe and only about a 20min walk to Pike St. Market or you could take bus 49 two steps away from the home, and get to the Market in 15min. The house is also a block away from cute shops and 10 minutes away from great restaurants on 15th Ave that Rochelle so nicely recommended.  These are some of the great spots we visited: Tacos Chukis, Smith, Tilth, Elysian Brewing Co., Pike St. Brewing Co., and other tasty places. Coastal Kitchen was highly recommended but we didn't have enough time for this one. Rochelle knows some cool spots, just ask her :)"
1030615,4953525,2013-06-03,6570545,Michelle,"I had a wonderful experience staying here!  For being so close to the city, I was surprised at how quiet and serene it was both in the home and outside in the back yard area.  I could hear birds chirping!  Rochelle was wonderful host, friendly, talkative, welcoming, and informative about the area, and, I enjoyed chatting in the living room (cozy and modern) with her and the other guest!  Fun experience!  The location was perfect.  A short walk to anything you need.  And very easy to hop a bus or a cab to anywhere in the city.  We happened to walk all the way down town one way and cab back on a beautiful sunny day in Seattle.  The only thing I would have changed was my foot attire (cowboy boots were not ideal for the lovely walk into downtown).  Ha!  The directions were clear and it was easy to find and access the unit.  Simply a wonderful experience.  My first one on Airbnb and I am thoroughly excited about the possibilities that may lay ahead through this unique site!  Thank Rochelle!"
1030615,5044794,2013-06-09,6687750,Brittany,"Nice location, easy to get to and with free parking available close by. Rochelle was very nice and helpful. The place is very clean and comfortable; feels like home!"
1030615,5103885,2013-06-12,6338688,Maggy,"Rochelle and her place are amazing!  Rochelle is extraordinarily warm, friendly, welcoming and informative.  She has a wealth of fantastic recommendations for places to go and things to do and is always prompt in responding to inquires, whether via email or text.  She took the time to search out recommendations based on our personal preferences.  Her place is located in such a beautiful and quiet neighborhood, we couldn't believe we were only a couple of miles from downtown.  There are a wide assortment of coffee shops, restaurants and bars close by.  Rochelle's townhome is immaculately clean and well furnished and decorated.  She has a great sense of style and adds personal touches that made us feel at home.  A map of the city, coffee, water and snacks are always on hand.   You can tell that Rochelle truly cares.  It felt like visiting an old friend. 

Thank you so very much for making our visit to Seattle so wonderful.  We appreciate your kind hospitality & generosity.  I would highly recommend your place to everyone visiting the Seattle area!"
1030615,5229798,2013-06-19,6280693,Young Joon,"Wow!!! It's new and great experience to stay in her home. I feel like a resident of US. Rochelle was an wonderful host. She was very kind, generous, friendly... We enjoyed to chat. Her house was very clean, coffee was also very good. We feel at home in her house. My family want to stay her home again. "
1030615,5363445,2013-06-26,6152220,Alexandra,"Staying with Rochelle was perfect! She s so nice and uncomplicated  and whenever I needed something she was there to help me. Everything is very well organized. The location is perfect, her house is lovely, very clean, in my room and the attached bathroom I found everything I needed! I can highly recommend staying there!"
1030615,6955354,2013-09-01,2632792,Alice,"Great host, great home, great location!

We had the pleasure of staying in Rochelle's beautiful home over the summer. Rochelle was an amazing host - friendly, accommodating and quick to respond to emails / text messages. She also offered a lot of good advice on things to do in Seattle.

Her home is bright, extremely clean and well-decorated. Her living room has a great selection of board games, movies and a record player + fun records. The kitchen is also stocked with cookware and spices that guests can use. Rochelle has an eye for floral design and her home is always filled with fresh flowers.

Her house is conveniently located just half a block from a bus that goes downtown, and walking distance from a very cool strip of Capitol Hill. We had a great summer and would highly recommend staying with Rochelle!"
1030615,7093832,2013-09-06,7072722,Nathalie,"Very friendly and helpful host,everything was exactely as described in the Airbnb-Announcement.
Great place to stay, we would choose this location again!  :-)"
1030615,7145936,2013-09-08,8241831,Michelle,"Rochelle's house is lovely, very clean, and a great place to stay. There was another couple staying there while we were, but there's lots of privacy and we were never disrupted by noise or anything. It's in a great area, just a couple of blocks from the heart of Capitol Hill. Rochelle herself was a friendly and helpful host, and let us store our bags before and after we checked in/out so we could make the most of every minute of our trip. I would definitely recommend Rochelle and her place to any AirBnBers!"
1030615,7281700,2013-09-14,8263697,Katie,"Rochelle and her apartment were my first airbnb experience and I have to say I'm hooked. My expectations were exceeded and anxieties calmed by Rochelle's quick responses and saintly hospitality. The location was perfect for me, as Capitol Hill is where I hope to one day live myself. The bus line is right there so access to downtown was a breeze. The bedroom was spacious and bed oh so comfy. I really appreciated the private bathroom, which Rochelle had stocked with bath wash and shampoos. Coming and going on my own terms was so easy; I never felt like I was intruding. When Rochelle was home, I really enjoyed our conversations. She's very knowledgable when it comes to Seattle spots and definitely had advice for my future residence there. I really appreciated how she allowed me plenty of personal space yet made me fell right at home at the same time. She stocked the kitchen with goodies for me, had water and fresh flowers in my bedroom. She is the quintessential hostess. I would not hesitate to recommend her to friends and strangers alike. I had a great time in town and Rochelle's place allowed for the perfect place to regroup. She definitely spoiled me, and I hope my future airbnb reservations can live up to her hospitality.  THANK YOU SO MUCH, ROCHELLE!"
1030615,7343234,2013-09-16,8337031,Ruby,"Great location!  Shops and restaurants are within easy walking distance and parking on the street wasn't that difficult at all.  We had the ""Paris"" room and had our own bathroom.  Everything we needed was there.  Would highly recommend staying with Rochelle!"
1030615,7599159,2013-09-26,5567424,Rebecca," My husband and I vacationed here for a week in September and we honestly can't say enough good things about it. This getaway is perfectly located for a relaxing escape from your daily grind. If you're here to take in the touristy attractions, you can do much of it from here without the need of a vehicle. It's within a 10 minute walk of Capitol Hill's most popular and up coming gastro-pubs and a 2 minute walk to public transit which will get you to Pike Place and the Public Market shopping district. 

    The pictures of the accommodations are good, but hardly do this vacation spot justice! We were so impressed by how stylish and well put together Rochelle's place was. It was somewhere that left us feeling both on vacation and at home at the same time.

    Rochelle was an extraordinary hostess. She was very helpful with recommendations for restaurants, happy hour cocktails and even some great photo ops. When I told Rochelle that we were there for our anniversary, she went the extra mile by helping me arrange a surprise bottle of champagne on ice with two glasses, waiting there in our room for my husband and I when we arrived. 

We plan on staying here again in the future and are looking forward to it!

"
1030615,7696330,2013-09-30,3852358,Annah,"Rochelle's place is amazing, love the decor and ambiance. She has everything you'll need for a stay, probably more than what hotels provide these days without all the extra charges! The bed was very comfy I should add. She is great with communicating prior and during  the stay. She has lots and lots of great recommendations and tips, especially if it's your first time visiting Seattle. You'll find plenty of reference material in her place, whether it's maps, guides or even books. She is overall a great person to chat with and her home is lovely to stay in. The bus line is on her block and brings you straight to downtown, something we definitely took advantage of! Will definitely consider her place  when we come back to Seattle. "
1030615,7885927,2013-10-07,1015937,Lois,"I feel that Rochelle is a wonderful hostess.  Her place is incredible. Very beautiful, many items that she has chosen from all over the world or that have been given to her by previous guests.  She is very kind and thoughtful. The construction next door at times was bothersome.  She was very thoughtful and considerate and played an important role in my visit."
1030615,8049184,2013-10-14,8717199,Ron,Nice location and really comfortable townhome that Rochelle has.  We felt like the place was ours to ourselves... very quiet and private.  Would recommend it for sure to stay for friends and relatives.
1030615,8144133,2013-10-17,9356969,Anna,"Gorgeous, clean, comfortable accommodations, right in the best neighborhood in Seattle! Rochelle is a wonderful, kind host- absolutely recommended. Thankyou Rochelle!

Anna and Nora"
1030615,8180663,2013-10-19,9369643,Denise,"I had a very positive experience at this conveniently located townhome in north Capital Hill.  The room and bathroom were very clean and nicely appointed, and the bed very comfortable.  It's also quiet, located on the west side of the building away from the street.  Rochelle provides linens, body wash, shampoo/conditioner and a hairdryer, which I appreciated.  Her townhome is nicely decorated and the kitchen lovely.  She provided coffee/tea and some fresh fruit.  Rochelle is a really cordial host and fun to talk with.  The location was perfect for me without a car, right on bus line 49, and within walking distance of Volunteer Park, coffee shops, restaurants.  I would highly recommend this space and look forward to another stay."
1030615,8718708,2013-11-13,9517665,Jane,"Our stay with Rochelle was our first airbnb experience. We can't imagine a better introduction to the service. Our time at Rochelle's lovely townhouse surpassed all our expectations. 
Our daughter lives in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle, and we were searching for a place near her apartment. Rochelle's home certainly fit that bill. We were within an easy four block walk to our daughter's place as well as right near wonderful restaurants, coffee shops, stores and the park. The location was perfect for us.
Rochelle was helpful right from the start. She communicated clearly and efficiently with us about her home and the process. Her description of her place was spot on, and she provided us with all the relevant details.
Upon arrival we found a truly lovely home which was comfortable, well appointed, beautifully decorated, cozy and immaculately clean. We stayed in the Mona Lisa room with its comfortable bed and private bathroom. Rochelle provided clean linens and towels, water bottles, city maps, information about the area, fast free Wi-Fii, soaps  shampoos and conditioners, even a couple of tasty chocolate truffles.
Our stay included the use of the common areas like the comfortable living room with gas fireplace as well as the kitchen area.  Rochelle had fresh fruit, bagels and yogurt available along with coffee and tea for a quick light breakfast each day if desired. 
Rochelle was delightful: helpful, friendly, engaging, witty, articulate, and very knowledgeable about the area. She provided excellent suggestions regarding restaurants and activities. She was readily available but also provided as much space and independence as we wanted. She is a delightful host and our stay was wonderful. We certainly plan to stay at Rochelle's the next time we visit Seattle.

1030615,8958547,2013-11-28,9745337,Elena,"Amazing experience! Incredible location, beautiful house, comfortable room and Rochelle is the perfect host!!!"
1030615,9569463,2014-01-02,4181187,Thomas,"Amazing place, amazing housemate ! We had 4 perfect days in Rochelle house. Kitchen was really well furnished. Bedroom was clean and comfortable. Rochelle is an interesting, nice, and helpful person... Thanks to her !

Voilà un superbe endroit où résider pour un séjour réussi à Seattle. La cuisine est très bien équipée, la maison est très propre et Rochelle, la propriétaire, est juste parfaite et très drôle. Nous recommandons évidemment. "
1030615,9936611,2014-01-20,1704783,Allison,"Rochelle was a great host! Her apartment was centrally located, extremely clean and very inviting. I rarely saw Rochelle and the other airbnb guests during my stay so I felt like I had a lot of privacy. The construction next door was audible on some of the mornings during my stay but it wasn't too terrible. The room did get a bit chilly but Rochelle provided a space heater which was a huge help. My only suggestion would be to add a full-length mirror to the closet door or somewhere in the room. Thanks again Rochelle!"
1030615,10538754,2014-02-24,5137149,Grace,"Rochelle's place was perfect for visiting the Gage Academy and exploring the Capitol Hill area and Seattle in general. On-street parking was always available. I was able to take an easy morning run down to the lake and around its edge both mornings. Others wrote of construction noise but I think the building next door is complete now - or it will be very soon. The place is spotlessly clean and well thought-out with everything in its proper place - good place to put your shoes on the ground floor, with a seat to sit on to take them on/off, nice setup with arrival/departure, all very easy. Next time I'm here on business I'm going to try to stay with Rochelle instead of in a downtown hotel even if I am on expenses. It's a much richer experience of the city being in a neighborhood."
1030615,10688702,2014-03-03,9670913,Dipa,"I stayed for 6 nights. Spacious, well put together house, beautiful room with a very comfortable bed. Good location, nice neighbourhood, walking distance to downtown (took me 20 mins). Rochelle is friendly, helpful and easy to communicate with. She also took care of every small detail which made my stay smooth-sailing. I would stay again if I ever came back to Seattle. Highly recommend!"

The room was just as described, clean and with all needed amenities. As was the private bathroom. Proximity to bus line and the vibrant Capitol Hill neighborhood was great. Your small touches, coffee, snacks etc were an unexpected perk. Clearly you know how to host. I will definitely visit again and thank you."

1030615,12550913,2014-05-05,12880933,Clare,"This was my boyfriend and I 's first Air BnB experience and it was a fabulous one! Traveling from the Greyhound terminal at peak hour, Rochelle recommended we take a taxi to the apartment. An excellent suggestion as it was an inexpensive $12 ride. Capitol Hill was a great location. The neighbour felt very safe and was close to shops and beautiful parks. 

The apartment was beautiful, clean and comforting. The bedroom was a decent size and the two of as fit comfortably. The bathroom was conveniently located next to the bedroom and was again a decent size and very clean. Kitchen and living spaces where well decorated, with high end, easy to use appliances The whole apartment had a wonderful vibe to it. Lots of character and charm. 

Rochelle was a fantastic host, providing multiple, yummy breakfast options including yogurts, bagels and fresh fruit. Various teas and coffee where also available. Rochelle was also so kind as to offer suggestions for day outings and great dinning options. 

A thoroughly enjoyable stay. Highly recommended.

It was extremely clean and orderly and the yogurt, fruit, coffee, etc. she makes available is a really nice touch. Rochelle is friendly and personable, as well as attuned to the needs of her guests. I would definitely stay here again."
1030615,18413241,2014-08-26,17612827,Danielle,"This was my very first time booking through airbnb and I couldn't have better things to say about Rochelle and her beautiful space.  The ""Paris"" room was comfortable and exceeded my expectations. Rochelle gave us thorough details about our travel from the airport and how to check into her home. She keeps her space in immaculate condition and even keeps snacks and coffee/tea for you to use in the space.  It was just like staying at home! The Capitol Hill area is very upbeat and certainly a hot spot. I appreciated being in a quiet and most importantly safe residential neighborhood but was only a few minutes walk from shops/restaurants and a great big Gold's Gym. Volunteer Park was also just a short walk. We used Uber the entire stay and were less than 10 minutes from everything we wanted to do. We were out and about all 4 days of our stay but Rochelle was very friendly and certainly gave us our personal space while we were at home. I just LOVED her home!  I would highly recommend this space and would absolutely book her again the next time I return to Seattle. "

Her knowledge of the area is excellent and enabled us to make the most of every minute of our trip. Rochelle's recommendations were highly reliable including anything from great tips on the best places to eat out and have coffee to how to get around the city. Nothing was too much trouble, we couldn't have wished for a more attentive and friendly host. The accommodation was everything it promised to be, spotlessly clean with a lovely contemporary feel and right on a main bus route to downtown. Having nice fresh fruit and breakfast items available was a super touch. We highly recommend staying with Rochelle, she is our first choice for any return trips to Seattle. "
1030615,19631730,2014-09-15,20577008,Divyajot,"Great location, bus to downtown stops steps away from Rochelle's place.

Our Paris room was so comfortable (with great closet space, worth noting!). The entire place is gorgeous, and super clean. It is well located, with the bus stop a minute away. We felt safe in that neighbourhood, and could walk around easily.

Rochelle was great with recommending places for us to check out, and she made our stay really comfortable and fun! The little touches like towels, water bottles, chocolates and postcards in the room were much appreciated and made us feel very welcome. We would go back without a second thought. Stay here! :)"

Upon arrival we were greeted with clean and fully furnished bedroom and bathroom. The location is quiet, walk-friendly, and mass-transit convenient. Rochelle was very helpful in helping us plan our trips through the city. We'd definitely return here the next we're in Seattle."

1030615,21799212,2014-10-24,22218399,Harold,"Make this your number one choice of places to stay while you're in Seattle.  This cozy, upscale Capitol Hill B & B is located near many sites of interest, as well as downtown.  The comfort, cleanliness, furnishings, and food were great.  When booking, we mentioned we were celebrating our birthdays.  Rochelle, the host, is engaging, helpful, and responsive to any needs.  Before arriving, she had placed a card in our room with candles on it with a note telling us to check the refrigerator for birthday goodies -a cake and a bottle of sparkling wine.  What a delightful surprise.  Her knowledge of the Capitol Hill area made it easy to make good choices for restaurants and things to do.

Being a Seattle native, she's got an amazing list of places to check out on her blog for just about all interests. The room I stayed in was quite spacious, and included a separate closet to keep clothes and luggage out of the way. Furthermore, this amazing house is located in an extremely convenient location -- just a few minutes walk from Capitol Hill bars, and a few minutes taxi/Uber to Downtown Seattle.

She was very accommodating of our late-check in time, and was a breeze to coordinate with - providing meticulous instructions. Rochelle had a bunch of great suggestions of things to do around town and was lovely to interact with. She has a beautiful house and the room itself is great - it gets a lot of light, has ample closet space, and allows for a great deal of privacy. "

Rochelle was a great host -- helpful and friendly -- even getting us set up with Uber.  The fruit, coffee, yogurt and other  yummy things she had available for breakfast made for an easy, delicious and economical way to start the day.  The location was very good.  We walked to Volunteer Park a couple of mornings and there was a bus stop downtown right on the block.   Great stay!  Thank you."

Everything was very well organized so that I had no problem arriving, finding the entrance to the house and my room. The house and room are very cosy and in the room a map, some cookies, water and keys were already waiting for me. Also the location is very convenient. It is in Capitol Hill and just a few minutes walk away from nice cafes, shops, restaurants and supermarkets. There is also a bus to downtown.
I would definitely stay there again if I ever come back to Seattle."

She gave us a perfect information about access from the station or the airport.
 I would highly recommend you book and if we're ever back in Seattle we'll definitely stay here!

ホストのロシェルさんは、事前に駅や空港からの完璧なアクセス情報をくれるので、大変助かりました。到着してからも過度な干渉はなく、しかし顔を合わせるととても優しく、街の情報などを教えてくれました。
室内はとても綺麗で片付いていて、AirBnBで利用した部屋の中では一番綺麗だったと思います。
立地も大変良く、バスのアクセスも良好、近くにお店もいろいろありますし、隣にはVolunteer Parkという大きな公園もあります。"

The entire home and room was clean, quiet, comfortable and well stocked.  Fast, reliable WiFi.  Easy to follow instructions were laid out for us upon arrival.  We felt very safe and secure in this space.

This is an amazing neighborhood and we never had trouble finding parking around her place during a busy graduation weekend.  We stayed three nights and only left by car one time for a dinner in Ballard.  This is an incredible neighborhood for walking with easy accessibility to tons of great food, coffee and drinks down 10th/Broadway.  My fiance and I walked all over the entire city.  Others might prefer a cab, but know from us that it can be done and was very enjoyable in the nice June weather.  The first night we walked down to the Paramount for a concert, the second day we walked down to the Space Needle area, and the third day to Pike Place Market.   

As a first time airbnb guest, I admittedly was nervous using the service.  However, I was blown away by the professionalism and communication of our host, the cleanliness, as well as the quiet and welcoming feeling.  I can only hope future airbnb experiences live up to a fraction of the perfect reputation Rochelle has now created of airbnb in my mind."

Located perfectly in Capitol Hill it is the best location to simply walk through this great neighborhood that has many restaurants, bars, shops, parks (volunteer), and easy bus ride (49 bus) to downtown. Everything and more we could of asked for. And Rochelle was a great host, easy to communicate with, very attentive and also respectful of privacy, and just a great person. After talking with her we feel like we have a friend in Seattle now! Room and bathroom were clean, well appointed, and the whole house was clean and just comfortable. Will definitely be staying again when wanting another vacation spot. -Jeff and Rose "

She sent instructions on how to get in to her place in advance of our arrival, and we found helpful notes throughout her place explaining the amenities that were available for us. She was very friendly and helpful in suggesting local places to visit, and in how best to get to the places on our ""to see"" list. Her place is very clean and comfortable, and the location is amazing. Right in the middle of Capitol Hill, we were steps away from great coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, as well as the bus stop to get anywhere in town. "

The room was very nice, exceptionally clean and provided everything necessary. We were within easy walking distance to museums, parks, eating, dining and shopping.

Rochelle provided seamless instructions on how to arrive as well as a list of ""tips"" on what to do (e.g. neighborhood cafes and restaurants). This and the natural tendency of guests to speak with each other in the open kitchen and living room, made for a comfortable visit. 

The place itself was very clean, well-organized, and easy to dwell in.  For example, clean towels and sheets were always on hand; the bathtub was spotless;  the modern design of the home was inviting. I managed to get quite a bit of code work done in the living room area. Moreover, SLU was a relatively short walk away and there are plenty of buses nearby. That said, Capitol Hill has much to offer! Be sure to try the ice cream at Kurt Farm Shop.

In short, I would highly recommend this lodging. Rochelle was affable and I look forward to visiting again. "

Bus stop to get into the city is just at the end of the block.  House was awesome - though we did not spend a lot of time there except to shower, sleep, and change.  Everything was clean, and well maintained.  Bed was super comfortable and shower was relaxing.   Towels were great.  We had our own bath (as advertised).  Rochelle was great in person with some extra tips for us.  You should go to Ican (restaurant), Biscuit Bitch (awesome breakfast-take an appetite.  I would recommend Rochelle's place to singles and couples (us) and would stay here again.

Plan in advance as her place is popular.

Rochelle was extremely welcoming, communicative, and helpful with providing all necessary info prior to arrival, including a full list of things to do and see (and eat and drink) locally.
She keeps some food to share and that is clearly marked, so it is very easy to make yourself at home.  I was quite disappointed to leave."

The house is walking distance to Volunteer Park as well as the trendy Capitol Hill restaurants and nightlife. Although Rochelle and I rarely crossed paths, she was always available to answer questions and was even gracious enough to let me stay on an extra night when my lodging plans fell through at the last minute. Her guide to the city is invaluable and helped me with restaurant selections as well as sightseeing. I would not hesitate to recommend Rochelle's Paris room to anyone who is passing through Seattle. The bed was wonderfully comfortable and all of my needs were met! Definitely a 5 star experience."

The apartment met all of my expectations, the location was great for us to visit the tourist sights.  It was only myself and 2 kids (8 & 10)  We walked everywhere, there was absolutely no need for a car.  The kids enjoyed the indoor pool at the end of a big day.  I especially loved the cafe downstairs.  Possibly the best cafe latte since I moved to the US 3 years ago!

The only thing that bothered me about the apartment was the noise.  I knew it was going to be noisy, so I wasn't surprised but it still annoyed me slightly.  It was super hot when I was staying so we wanted to open the windows but opening the windows meant letting in all the noise!  I used the fan at night as white noise for the kids and I used ear plugs, so it was ok.  

Overall we had a great stay, we loved Seattle and loved Belltown.  The apartment was perfect for our 3 night stay.  Thanks for all your help while we were there Marilyn!"
5058302,39914592,2015-07-27,25687313,Amy,The condo was perfect for us. The building is very nice and the condo was very nicely appointed. Everything we needed was there for us and our stay was perfect- thank you so much Marilyn!
5058302,40325321,2015-07-30,11517893,Nir,"The flat os in a great place close to the main attraction. We didnt see Marilyn but the instraction for checking in were good enough.
The flat is as describe. We are family of 5 and it was a bit to small for us. We visited in some very hot days and there was no ac. Some of the instruments in the flat need to be replaced"
5058302,41924644,2015-08-10,20240745,Pete,"Don't let anyone badmouth Belltown - what a great, great area! And to have a wonderful place to stay - just awesome. There are MANY, MANY places to eat / drink within easy walking distance; Seattle Center and Pike Place are 20 minutes in either direction. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks, Marilyn - for making all this possible. And don't forget - the parking space included with the unit is HUGE if you have a car..."
5058302,46126347,2015-09-08,3270839,Samantha,"Perfect place to stay. Apartment is beautiful, and location was amazing, very central and very walkable. Beds were very comfortable, even the pull-outs. The host, Marilyn, went above and beyond. Highly recommend!"
5058302,46536026,2015-09-11,19078344,Jenifer,"Exactly as described! Beautiful apartment complex, and great location. Was a little warm in the evenings, even with the ""air conditioning"" wall unit. The fans seemed to help better. "
5058302,47642004,2015-09-21,2555387,Alban Maurice,"Marilyn (host), was very prompt in assisting. she made us feel very comfortable. Location is excellent. superb for the family and very safe.
i would surely go back.
"
5058302,49316761,2015-10-03,36953798,Marla,"Marilyn had a bottle of wine waiting for us for our 24th anniversary!

The apartment is in Belltown Seattle. We were right above Macrina bakery & coffee shop. The best! We were also above a Belltown Pizza and Belltown Market. Conveniently located to anywhere. Walking distance to the Space Needle, Chihuly Garden & Glass, Financial District and Pikes Market, Pioneer Village was  a little farther but just an Uber away.

I can't recommend this apartment high enough, oh, and the king size bed was dreamy and comfortable.

We had a fabulous vacation!

Marla

We looked out on Puget Sound which was a different surise and sunset color every day. There is a security guard in the evenings, The building is clean with a beautiful pool and Jacuzzi spa. The inner garden grounds are immaculate.

The apartment was spotless, had every connivance, down to scissors in the kitchen.

"
5058302,50636048,2015-10-13,15031587,Robert,Great Belltown location. Walking distance from restaurants and about a quarter mile from pike place market. Very convenient and enjoyed our stay here. Well furnished and would definitely recommend. 
5058302,51136849,2015-10-18,7967337,Eric,"Communication with Marilyn and and access to the condo was a complete breeze.  The apartment was clean (priority #1), and was well-kept.  The washer/dryer came in handy, and there were plenty of locations to grab coffee or a bite nearby.  

It did get rather warm while we were there, so the fans were helpful to keep us a bit cooler.  It was a little loud on a Friday night, but that's to be expected in a downtown neighborhood.  Overall a really good experience!"
5058302,51899754,2015-10-25,18935769,Catherine,"Marilyn was very accommodating in being flexible about our exact check-in time since our flight kept getting delayed. The instructions were very detailed, making things really easy to follow. Her place is very central to many things, including the bakery downstairs! I would definitely recommend staying here if you ever want to play tourist in Seattle! Thanks, Marilyn!"
5058302,53514717,2015-11-09,11359626,Robert,Marilyn's place was awesome! Very clean and easy to access. The location is perfect for walking to explore the Belltown bar and restaraunt scene as well as Pikes Market. Onsite secure parking was a huge plus as well. I will most definately stay again.
5058302,55390485,2015-12-01,2555387,Alban Maurice,"This is our second time staying at Marilyn's place and it went just as well as last time. Marilyn is very helpful and responds very promptly. The apartment and its location are both excellent. We'll definitely return.

Troy and Maria were gracious hosts and I am already booked for a second visit."
796594,3602018,2013-02-22,245469,John,"This was my second visit to Troy and Maria's home and it was again excellent.

They asked for my feedback after my first stay and graciously delivered on all of my requests by the time I arrived.

Recommended!"
796594,3693660,2013-03-04,5168020,Ryan,"A wonderful apartment well-located within blocks of Seattle required stops including Vivace, Poppy, and Top Pot. Wonderful views of Lake Union and the Olympics (when they're out). 
Cafes, restaurants, and groceries are within walking distance.
Good highway access should your travels require getting around the area. "
796594,5403685,2013-06-28,6901947,Olubukola,My boyfriend and I had a fabulous stay at Troy and Maria's nice apartment from (phone number hidden). It was comfortable and clean.  High- speed internet worked great and it was nice to have secure assigned parking in garage. Kitchen was well-stocked although we ended up not using it.  Troy was always quick to respond to our questions. Also Capitol hill is a cute neighborhood. We'd love to stay there again.
796594,5672421,2013-07-11,4824989,Larie,The apartment has a great view of Lake Union and the Olympics and a roof top deck with views of downtown and the space needle; very cool.  It is located walking distance (1 mile) to downtown and lots and lots of restaurants.  Top Pot and Sun Liquor (yum!) are only 1.5 blocks away and Melrose Market only .5 miles away.  We arrived during a heatwave and Troy set us up with a portable air conditioner.  Very nice.  This apartment was just what we were looking for for our first week in Seattle.
796594,5825878,2013-07-18,3485672,Michael,"Fantastic view in a great location, very safe and secure building, and the owners were very flexible and great to work with. We enjoyed our stay very much."
796594,5993943,2013-07-25,1244576,Darin,"It was a pleasure to meet Troy. The parking is safe and secure, included. The balcony and views are great. Head up to the roof top.  I recommend and would return."
796594,6125276,2013-07-31,5671819,Melissa,We enjoyed our stay in this cozy Capitol Hill area condo. Easy to get around on foot and by bus. Excellent views from the deck and super peaceful. We will definitely want to stay here again and are already trying to plan a return trip in future. Troy was easy to contact and had the condo set up with A/C since it was warm by Seattle standards. Great location and affordable. 
796594,9515947,2014-01-01,7810072,Marc,Location was perfect. Wonderful views. Troy was very responsive to my needs. Great place to stay.
796594,10601206,2014-02-27,4113992,Jackie,"We spent 6 weeks here and loved the place.  This cozy apartment was perfect.  Here's what worked for us:  The location is perfect near the Gage art school, near the Richard Hugo House for poetry classes, a short walk to Cornish College of the Arts, Seattle University and easily accessable to the University of Washington.  

For entertainment, the Harvard Exit Theatre, Roy Street Cafe, right across from our favorite bookstore, the Quest, which has meditation every weekend in the back library area. The Melrose Market and Plum Bistro were our favorite food finds. And having a great organic section at a huge QFC just blocks away. Brisk walks to downtown or the South Lake Union with the incredible Museum of History and Industry.  We loved coming home to the artistically furnished apartment, with cozy gas fireplace and large TV(s)  to watch the Olympics and of course the 12th man celebration of the NFL Seahawks.  The place comes equiped with every cooking utensil.  Also having a parking space is essential while staying in this part of town.  Although the close public transport in Seattle is the way to go.

Troy was an attentive and responsive host, but totally left us to our privacy.  We enjoyed the decor with stimulating colors, artistic accents and comfy furniture.  The view of Lake Union from the bedroom and living room was great!

The only minor drawbacks were trying to pull out of the garage driveway with snow (not possible) and the thrum of the I-5 highway (which sounded like the sea to us) and one of us had to climb over the other to get out of bed (which was way fun.)   

"
796594,13177255,2014-05-21,5035833,Patty,"This is a darling place.  Colorful, comfy, cozy.  We stayed for about a month and were really happy with our choice. You can hear the traffic from the freeway and I was worried because I thought we might not be able to sleep through it.  But I was amazed - we slept like logs!  Likely because the traffic slows down at night and it's more like an ocean lulling you to sleep.  Comfy bed too.

The neighborhood is very walkable.  Walk up a hill for a few blocks and you're on a busy street with a ton of places to eat, drink, and shop.  If you were to keep going up the hill you would hit another busy street with even more amazing restaurants, bars, coffee shops, shopping, bookstores, etc. - the total from this condo to the 2nd busy street is 1 mile.  So up and back is a fun 2 mile walk.  Great place to get exercise if you want it!  :)

Once we were in the condo, Troy was very accessible by phone/text and always responded very quickly.  

Awesome neighbors too -- everyone was suuuuuper nice.  :)"
796594,13434249,2014-05-27,15106876,Aaron,"The condo was very cozy.  We absolutely loved our stay here.  The balcony and the rooftop deck had wonderful views.  It was great waking up to a view over Lake Union.  Troy quickly responded to any questions we had.  We would definitely recommend it, and would stay here again.  "
796594,13621330,2014-06-01,5774678,Kahron,"I had a fantastic experience at Troy and Maria's place.  Everything was as listed.  It was clean, and in an ideal location to reach all of my desired locations.  Wireless was fast, which was good for picking up sports and doing work.  No real complaints whatsoever.  I'd stay here again."
796594,13984637,2014-06-09,15319038,James,"My husband and I wanted to mix in some local flavor amidst our touristy outings while in Seattle, so Troy and Maria's place was the perfect home base for our visit. Their cozy condo has great views and is within easy walking distance of cafes, bars, shops, and restaurants. It was clean, well-kept, and quiet during our stay, and it was great to have parking provided. The space is really comfortable for two people, and Troy is easily accessible by text. We would definitely stay there again!"
796594,14361953,2014-06-17,15803076,David,"Great place for a long get away weekend. Awesome views from every window and the rooftop. Easy to get around town walking or driving and the parking space was a huge bonus. Very comfortable, well decorated place that we didn't want to leave. Troy is very responsive and easy to get along with. Next time we're back this is our first choice!"
796594,34242015,2015-06-06,32390676,Linda,We had a fabulous time in Seattle and Troy and Maria's home was beautifully decorated with a amazing Veiw of lake Washington! It was so enjoyable to relax watching the seaplanes land and take off while sipping coffee on the balcony. The condo was in the heart of city life with active fun places to eat and drink all in walking distance. Troy was very generous with suggestions on where to eat and shop.  The home was clean and comfy! It had all the amenities you will need for a great stay in Seattle !  This will be a top 10 for places to stay in Seattle ! 
796594,35497766,2015-06-19,3372059,Nicole,"Troy and Maria's apartment was just as described.  It was very clean and had everything one would need for a comfortable stay.  The neighborhood is nice with lots of great restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores.  The wifi was strong.  When my flight was delayed, they were very accommodating with a late check in.  I was very pleased and highly recommend the hosts."
796594,35944767,2015-06-23,34062049,Ira,Very comfortable apartment for my wife and I. Well maintained building. Reserved parking spot a real plus. Excellent location to get around seattle. Not right in the action though- several block walk to food and drink. The noise from the interstate below was loud- used ear plugs for sleeping.  Troy was very easy to work with. 
796594,36549613,2015-06-29,5322286,Sarah,"This place was perfect for my trip, and Troy was a fantastic host. The location was convenient, and the apartment was clean and beautiful-exactly as described. They even stocked the fridge with some breakfast goodies. Troy reached out to check in throughout to weekend and ensure I had everything I needed. I couldn't have asked for anything more. "
796594,39460803,2015-07-23,1709346,Tracy,"I was here on a business trip. Troy was super nice in getting me checked in and even gave me a ride to a local area where I could get things done like printing for my meeting, dinner, groceries, etc.   They even coordinated accepting surprise flowers from my husband and stocked the fridge with breakfast foods and coffee!  The place is a small one bedroom + a small living/dining combo and kitchen- good for 1 or 2 people but tight for more than that. Seattle is not typically very hot, so they had an attached AC unit which cooled down the bedroom.  The location is a walk up the hill about 4 blocks to the Broadway hot spots, and you hear a bit of the highway traffic but it's not bothersome.   It was very clean, and had the amenities you need, and Troy was super responsive to any issues or questions that came up. "
796594,40104245,2015-07-28,5455395,Shawna,"Perfect spot for our getaway weekend.  A couple blocks away from a main street in Capitol Hill with lots of dining options and an optometrist who was open on Saturday for an emergency visit.  There is a bus stop 1 block away to take you to Pike's Place and it's less than 1.5 miles to Lake Union that stretches beneath your balcony view.  
Troy was kind enough to have yogurt and bagels on hand for us and was quick to reply to our questions.  "
796594,40966028,2015-08-03,11346380,Jamie,"Home was exactly as it appears and perfect for our stay!  Garage was perfect so we could leave the car and just walk everywhere.  Beautiful views, comfortable bed, and a great spot in the city to get to attractions, but stay in a more local area with good restaurants and bars just a block away."
226677,698579,2011-11-07,1252047,Michael,"I stayed here as my first stop after moving to Seattle for work. Angielena hosted me for a month, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying in a great little neighborhood. 

Georgetown is a fascinating area full of arts and lots of activities to enjoy. There are local restaurants and stops worth enjoying, my favorites were Hangar Cafe, All City Coffee and Stellar Pizza. I didn't use the bus much, but it's easy to get downtown that way, and this is also a very car-friendly location. You can get on and off I-5 in less than 3 minutes, or head downtown on some of the other roads. 

If you're looking for an isolated spot to relax in complete quiet, this probably isn't for you. If you want a spot that's peaceful even while it's in the middle of the activity, then I can't recommend this enough. "
226677,860462,2012-01-13,1572313,Amanda,"As my first host from airbnb I could not have asked for a more perfect host and apartment space. Warm and easy going, staying with Angielena made my short visit to Seattle even more memorable. Thank you!!"
226677,1132252,2012-04-15,1935260,Michael,"Angielena was a perfect host and I stayed with her for a month. I could go on and on with all the positives I could write but it would be easier just to say, ""I'm coming back each and every time Im in Seattle"". Heck Id come up just to visit since now I consider Angielena a friend"
226677,1781526,2012-07-23,2825148,Andy,"Angielena is a great host, and Georgetown is fun place to stay.  The artists' are fascinating and she uses their work to decorate the rooms.  Very cool."
226677,1973708,2012-08-13,2394626,Monika,"This was our first airbnb experience and it was a good one! The GACC is the kind of funky artsy place that has exactly the kind of feeling we look for when traveling: full of art, history and interesting people, quirky, and very conveniently located with a bunch of really good restaurant, bar and coffee shop options right outside the building - beats the anonymous 5 star downtown hotel any day! The place is still under construction, which gives it a bit of an eerie feel at night, but other than that we weren't affected by it at all. The bathroom is beautifully remodeled with a spa-like shower and having the air con in the room saved my sleep during these hot days!! Angielena was a warm and welcoming hostess and the only regret I have was that we only had very limited time to get to know each other. Next time our path brings us to Seattle we'll be back!"
226677,2182903,2012-09-03,3294898,Kimberley,This was our first airbnb experience. We had an excellent time and the area is perfect for what we were looking for. They are still under renovation and I wonder what will happen when there are 4 rooms and 1 bathroom.
226677,2415160,2012-09-25,3163591,Til,"This place is so nice! Angielena put a lot of effort in making her rooms special. It´s more minimalistic but luxury, but if thats what you want, you cant get a sweeter place for this little money. And who didn´t wnat to live in an artists studio once a while?

The area the apartment is in makes it even more special. Would have never gone there if I wouldn't have lived there, but Georgetown is absolutely worth seeing. As an island between highway, airport and industrial area it has become a crazy place for artists and other such folks. I felt home there. 

Way to the city centre is easy with the car, and ok by public transport."
226677,2576449,2012-10-10,3721315,Ted,"If you are looking for luxurious accomidations with all the ameneties, this is not the place. If you are looking for a bohemian adventure in a classic hotel/now artist studio, this is the perfect spot. I throughly enjoyed my stay and Angielina was a gracious host. Having other guests about was a plus for me. And the ""Barry White"" bathroom with its 8 showerheads -- fabulous!"
226677,4793632,2013-05-26,6118895,Chris,I had a wonderful stay in the historic Georgetown district while my local apartment was being prepped. Angielena was a terrific and flexible host. The room and bed were great and the shower was fabulous. It is a good location for working or visiting downtown and the stadiums.
226677,4985507,2013-06-05,5734396,Arieh,"This is a very cool place to stay.  When you first come up the stairs you are greeted by artwork by the various artists whose studios are spread out around the building.  Angielena is a great person to meet.  She is a world traveler, an accomplished artist and a working environmentalist.  Her passions and her work are present in your experience at her place as it is a combination of curating the past while keeping a keen eye on the present.  The room was comfortable and clean with interesting touches and details to keep you interested.  Now, it is very important to talk about the bathroom.  Amazing.  The shower enclosure covers the entire back of the bathroom (you could fit 6-8 people in there) and has about 9 different shower heads, each individually controlled) that come from all different directions.  The room is tiled in red/orange tiles and the light switches all have dimmers!!!  Barry White anyone?  Suffice to say that I will never forget those showers.  Angielena got me exactly what I wanted for breakfast.  Everything was clean and appetizing.  I give Angielena and her artist studio rooms two big thumbs up.  "
226677,5278546,2013-06-22,6526901,Luci,"I can highly recommend to stay at Angielena's place in wonderful Georgetown! The place is really unique and the area offers some great little shops, coffee places and restaurants. The room, kitchen and bathroom are well equipped and very clean. Angielena has been a very lovely host and a nice person to talk to. I would love to come back the next time I`m visiting Seattle!"
226677,5737773,2013-07-14,7068273,Wilhelm,If you want to experience an up and coming neighborhood - this is the one.The Golden Room in Georgetown is an exciting place to be. Angielena is a great host. The artists in the house are very pleasant to live and talk with. Lot's of excitement in the air and on the road. Great Mexican Restaurant around the corner. I had the particular joy of a fully blown S.U.B. P.O.P. concert at the last day of my stay and that was way cool! Thanks for a great stay!
226677,5947982,2013-07-23,7091526,Ginger,Very clean and comfortable room in this 1905 building that now is a B and B and  community of artists studios. We enjoyed our privacy as well as  the back porch overlooking the mobile artists market.   The bus stop and restaurants were conveniently located and Angelina gave very helpful directions and  suggestions regarding near by restaurants. We are looking forward to returning to our new home in Seattle.
226677,6112138,2013-07-30,7287145,Andrea,"I had a wonderful stay there, just what I was looking for.  I loved Georgetown. Great places to have coffee, drink and eat.  I also enjoyed yoga at Yoga Smith that was very close by.   I highly recommend if you are looking for a great Seattle pocket with lots of local flair.  "
226677,6622700,2013-08-19,7432954,Jessica,Angielena is a great host. The Golden Room was conveniently located by SANCA and a mess of good restaurants. It was a fun five days and hope to be back!
226677,6796552,2013-08-25,4441034,Heidi,Everything was excellent! Thank you!
226677,7087408,2013-09-05,2478479,Jocelyn,"Angielena was fabulous. My partner and I loved the space in Georgetown. It was super-unique and definitely one of our favorite parts of staying in Seattle. The room was small but very cozy and the bathroom was pretty awesome - loved the shower! If you're a fan of arts/artists and the unique, definitely stay here! "
226677,7649235,2013-09-28,8389578,Frank,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Georgetown with Angielena. The room was comfortable with a vintage flair; the B & B definitely has character with an artistic flair; and most importantly, the people are interesting, friendly, and real!  I would definitely recommend booking a room here!!   "
226677,17113978,2014-08-07,17845996,Chris,Great neighborhood.  
226677,17310273,2014-08-10,18117205,Matthew,"The artist studio was a great place to stay and a fun way to experience Seattle.  The studio bedroom is perfectly situated in Georgetown, which has a great art scene and plenty of good bars.  The room and bathroom were clean and quiet -- great value, too!  Angielena greeted us and made sure we felt at home by giving us a tour of the artist studio and tips on Seattle."
226677,17536216,2014-08-13,18700174,Xiao,"Angielena is super friendly and nice. The room is inside an art gallery, full of paintings and other artistic items. Very unique indeed. The room itself is not very big, but the kitchen and the bathroom are very good. Super close to downtown Seattle. In general, it's an awesome place to stay, espl. for travelers."
226677,18351305,2014-08-25,16478209,Zao,"Really amazing experience..Angie is such nice and helpful person. The cozy bedroom and the sparkling bathroom make me want to stay in as long as I can...I love George Town so much, full of lovely people here and there."
226677,18600422,2014-08-28,20423986,Norma,"I highly recommend this place for anyone trying to visit Seattle from its roots. Georgetown in particular is a very old, culture-rich part of Seattle that now serves as the Art district. Many fabulous, kind, and beautiful people to meet here. angieland was a very nice and helpful host. She is kind and understanding, and given appropriate time she will do whatever she can to make you feel comfortable. For the price this place is a great little place to flock back to when the day is over. Only disadvantages to be considered are the location of a shared bathroom down the hall, the 
lack of a full refridegerator and ice, and the issues of literally no sound insulation. But room was clean, though petite it was comfortable and more importantly secure. I had a wonderful time and met great people. I would definitely stay here again."
226677,18816522,2014-09-01,18586913,Meg,We had a great time. It was a great. It was pretty and she was a great host.
226677,19042209,2014-09-05,12997786,Teresa,Angielena is very nice and sweet. She introduced me the whole community in detail when I arrived. All people in this house are quite friendly and quiet. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. 
226677,19429061,2014-09-12,19194404,Joelle,"This was my first Air BnB experience and could not have asked for anything better. I LOVED everything about my stay with Angielena - my quiet & serene room, the layout of the floor, all the interesting art on the wall, meeting some of the artists who live on the floor. 

The bathroom shower is AMAZING!  I did not get a chance to experience all 8 settings but the varying options were beyond ridiculous - in a GOOD way!  Name Barry White def fits, haha. 

Angielena was very friendly + accommodating and a very lovely person! She is very responsive to texts and welcomed my feedback on suggestions for improvements. She lives nearby but there is an on-site person to take care of any pressing issues. 

She is very easy to get along with, and we hit it off fantastically! I would definitely recommend staying with Angielena if you are artistically inclined as you will feel right at home.

Georgetown is a very cute area - slightly gritty in parts but very safe. There are lots of cute restaurants and indie stores like record store/comic book shop, coffeeshop, etc. The restaurant/bar downstairs is very convenient & pretty good food - would recommend their happy hour. In the same building, there is also a cute little shop owned by 2 ladies that sell handcrafted goods from local area artists/photo studio/hair salon. Definitely check that out. 

It's easy to get to/from downtown Seattle via 2 buses and bus stops are very close. 

Overall, I had an awesome stay and definitely recommend staying here. I am very happy to have made a friend and a fellow artistic soul. :) Thanks!"

Angielena was a very sweet hostess &communicated everything very clearly. Georgetown is a fun, artsy neighborhood. Public transport to downtown Seattle is very straightforward. I wish I hadn't been so busy at my workshop to explore the town a little more it was so lovely! I would stay here again in a heart beat!"
226677,30164690,2015-04-18,23570594,Tiffany,Staying at the Bella was great and way better than I expected.  I wasn't there long and used it as a place to sleep and clean up most of the time. But I felt safe and secure being there. Super helpful it was near a bus stop and the best cantina I have ever been to. Not to mention how friendly my host was when I arrived. It was quite peaceful and I would stay again.
226677,30825707,2015-04-27,31252783,Taylor,"Angielena was so kind to my boyfriend and I right off the bat, a genuine kindness that made you feel like you were being welcomed by an old friend. She checked up on us regularly throughout the trip, offering up places to visit and grab a bite to eat, playing a huge role in how we planned our days.
On top of an incredibly kind hostess, the environment itself was nothing like I had ever stayed at before. Greenery and artwork were at every corner, the photos posted for this listing really do not do the rooms justice. It was like the B&B was like a whole place on it's own to explore. Our stay at this specific B&B is one of the main reasons why our trip was so enjoyable.

One thing to really keep in mind, though, is that this is more of a quiet environment. If you're the type of person who knows they're noise or maybe enjoys listening to loud music while they get ready, you might want to consider another place to stay. The B&B itself is beyond words, beautiful in so many ways, and the hostess is so attentive and kind, but might not be the place for a family with super active children or someone who doesn't necessarily enjoy being on the quiet side. Just something to keep in mind."
226677,35600571,2015-06-20,25373591,Maurice,"Angielena was a great, kind, accommodating host!  The room I stayed in was very clean and neat.  She left clean towels and shampoo for me to use also.  The bathroom was simply majestic.  The shower was large, decorated with ornate tile and 6 shower heads. 

I spent all of my time downtown rather than in the neighborhood where I was staying.  However, there was an inexpensive bus that easily takes you downtown or to the train station.  It's about a 10 minute ride.  Accessing the airport from Angielena's place is easy too.  Angielena was also kind enough to provide a map of the area, directions on how the Seattle bus/train system works, and recommendations of good restaurants.

226677,36423113,2015-06-28,791033,Mari & Cord,"Our stop in Seattle was our last on an almost 3-week-long trip to the Northwest. By time we arrived back in Seattle, we were ready for some peace and quiet and a comfy place to stay. This place fit the bill exactly.
When my 12-year-old daughter and I arrived, Angielena met us in front of the Arts Center and gave us a thorough tour of the space. It was really helpful because it's a mixed-used space with artists residing next to guests and all need to live together harmoniously. 
If you're looking for a full-service hotel, look elsewhere. The Arts Center is a European-style hotel, with shared bathrooms and kitchen facilities. We found our accommodations to be clean, comfortable and a welcome change from the corporate hotel scene we'd been experiencing while traveling with our extended family. Our bedroom was small, but the bed was comfortable and we had space to move around and store our things. Because we hit unseasonably hot temps in Seattle, the window air conditioner was a lifesaver and kept us cool and comfy. Unfortunately, we didn't get to experience the fabulous shower due to some plumbing issues, but it looks spectacular. The other shower is perfectly serviceable and the bathrooms were kept clean and neat. We did a little bit of cooking in the small but functional kitchen and it was a great opportunity to mix a bit with other guests and the artist residents. 
The neighborhood is cool and quirky, with lots of places to eat, drink and shop. The Two Tartes Bakery, in particular, made amazing pastries and pretty great coffee drinks. We rented a car since we were going out to Fall City and parked in the adjacent lot, but there is plenty of public transportation in the area including a bus line that stops right in front.
We're an urban-dwelling family and really appreciated the energy of this area. We found the space to be pleasant, safe and truly charming."
226677,36898275,2015-07-02,14281777,Ryan,"Our stay with Angielena was quite interesting and enjoyable.  Located in an older part of Seattle that has seen some recent Urban renewal efforts, Georgetown was a treat to walk through at night, with quite a few nice restaurants and bars giving the little strip a hip vibe, even if it has a few rough edges.  The room we stayed in was a little small, but if you're only there to sleep like I was with my girlfriend, it was quite doable.  While the bathrooms were communal, the showers did not disappoint. Overall, if you're on a budget, and just want to explore, I could not recommend Angielena's listing more."
226677,37879475,2015-07-11,17088682,Will,"I spent 4 nights in the ""classic beauty room"" and had a great stay.  Angielina is a very welcoming host - great in communicating with me before I arrived, flexible with my arrival time, and happy to show me a tour of the residence and to answer questions even though she was pressed for time and had another commitment.   The room is small and cozy with a comfortable bed.  It was surprisingly quiet considering the proximity of so many restaurants and pubs.  One nice feature not visible here: the room included a small window air conditioner, which really helped during my stay (Seattle was having a freak heatwave).  The bathroom shower is incredible (as others have mentioned).    There are many food options within walking distance and very close to the 5 for those who have a car.  I enjoyed my stay and hope to be back again soon.  Thanks, Angielina!  "
226677,38517350,2015-07-16,28072127,Chafia,"My partner and I had an amazing time staying in the classic beauty room! This is the perfect place to be in Seattle if you love the arts, crafts, food and great bars without having to be smack bang in the centre of town. We arrived on a Saturday and were lucky enough to experience the local vintage market with music and great vibes happening at the bottom of the building. The building is a beautiful heritage listed space for artists in residence and Airbnb guests. The people we met were all friendly and easy going while we also felt like we had plenty of quiet, private time to enjoy hanging out on the large deck area. We must leave a special mention to Angielena and Fred who were so lovely, made sure we had everything we needed and were helpful with suggesting interesting places to find around Georgetown. We would love to go back again! Highly recommended :)"
226677,38872866,2015-07-19,12648384,Meghan,"Had a great time! Georgetown was a cute little town to stay in and look around but also close enough to Seattle to get there in no time at all. Lovely accommodations, very comfortable, would definitely recommend!!"
226677,40107707,2015-07-28,14298988,William,"Angela was very helpful and welcoming, and made our stay in Georgetown awesome. The building is very interesting too, enjoyed it much."
226677,41515001,2015-08-07,5108864,Brian,"Wow, Georgetown! I'd been through 5 years prior for a wedding and hadn't the opportunity to check out the neighborhood again. Love the artistic vibe in the area, which included Angielena's location. I enjoyed the classic accents throughout the building, formerly a hotel space but now geared for artists and travelers. I had hoped to stay for an extra few days but was out of luck on availability. For me, spending time at a photo school in capitol hill, there was a direct bus from Georgetown to Capitol Hill (#60 I think) which made this area very accessible. The room was small and comfortable with a hardy little AC unit. Great spot, check it out if you can! "
226677,41695287,2015-08-08,37807873,Oliver,Wir haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt in der künstlerischen Umgebung. Das Zimmer ist eher klein aber gemütlich eingerichtet. Wir waren leider zu kurz da um viel über die Umgebung sagen zu können. Die empfohlene Pizzeria war auf jeden Fall sehr gut.
226677,42758963,2015-08-15,23813444,David,My girlfriend and I had a nice stay here. An interesting space to stay in and a great location. Angielena was very helpful with any questions we had. 
226677,43520928,2015-08-20,11791683,Sonny,"Angielena was a great host. The room was clean and tidy - a great option if you just need a room to crash. The bathroom is shared but it's stocked with everything you need and the shower is spacious. Checking in was a breeze and overall our experience was smooth. I would definitely recommend this listing. 

This part of Georgetown is a great little stretch of shops and restaurants with charm and whimsy. Driving to other parts of Seattle was easy and parking was a breeze. "
226677,44188738,2015-08-24,39977710,Katelyn,Angielena was great!! She was super helpful from the moment we got there and was available if we had needed her... which we didn't.  We loved the location of house and were pleased with all of the amenities that were near by.   She was a good host!
226677,44733018,2015-08-28,17426663,Rimpal,Angielena was very welcoming and readily available if I needed her. She has a warm personality and a very sweet little terrier who also likes to greet AirBnB guests:)
226677,45429694,2015-09-02,42092934,Jen,"Loved loved loved my experience!! Angielina was a dream host. She gave us space, yet was very welcoming and loved Georgetown. She and her dog are the sweetest hosts you'll ever have. The shower is amazing, and the rooms are nice. It is a hostel-style, which is exactly what we wanted. I would love to re-visit or even move to Georgetown after this experience. "
226677,46141934,2015-09-08,14757132,Emilio,The location was perfectly placed in Georgetown and quite cozy. Angielena was very nice in showing how everything worked and the stay was wonderful.
226677,46825241,2015-09-13,11743654,Valencia,I was pleasantly surprised by the area. It's full of great bars and restaurants that were very convenient to walk to. The building is very cool and we were given a warm welcome and tour when we checked in. It was great to be able to stay in this part of Seattle which we would have not Have known about otherwise.
226677,49944185,2015-10-07,42446852,Anna,wir mussten die reise leider einen tag vorher stornieren. :(
226677,55046413,2015-11-27,45844870,Tim,"Made me feel welcome right from the start. The room and facilities were fabulous (awesome bathroom!), and Georgetown is simply a prime place to stay with so much within walking distance. I'd highly recommend staying with Angielena to anyone visiting the Seattle area."
8538420,48838804,2015-09-28,43602567,Errika,We were warmly greeted by Terry. She went to great lengths to make sure we felt at home and had more than we needed. The apartment is darling and is decorated in an inviting yet practical manner. The view! The real reason we chose this house. The view is amazing as is this part of West Seattle. Had fun exploring the neighborhood and then returning home at night to dive into the crazy comfortable bed. 
8538420,48978921,2015-09-29,147345,Jennifer,The host canceled this reservation 92 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8538420,49939549,2015-10-07,5627913,Hector,"Terry is a terrific host who goes the extra step to make sure guests feel welcome once they arrive; not only to the rental, but to the West Seattle area overall. 

The apartment is in a terrific, laid back location within walking distance of many great restaurants, markets, and bars, and a short bus ride or Lyft away from Downtown Seattle and the stadiums. 

Having looked at some other options for an extended weekend stay, I'm glad to have chosen Terry's rental and look forward to a return trip to West Seattle. "
8538420,50596367,2015-10-12,6381356,忠,"good stay have nice view. Terry is very friendly, everything is good. I hope I will stay again."
8538420,51197568,2015-10-18,33581284,Saileene,"Amazing views of the city! That was the first thought that went into my mind as we first stepped into the apartment style Airbnb. Everything was really immaculate when we entered and really showed Terry's exceptional attention to detail. She even had chilled pint glasses in the freezer ready for us (which was a major plus for my boyfriend). Not only that, everything was included from the coffee, bathroom amenities and all of the kitchen utensils. Plus, you really can't beat the view that you have from the deck as you walk outside and overlooks all of Seattle. Everything is a quick 10min drive to downtown and is really worth the value for all of our first times in Seattle. Last but certainly not least, Terry was extremely accommodating. From the moment we were in contact with Terry she really went above and beyond to make sure that we had everything we needed to make the most of our visit. I have nothing but good things to say, and would definitely come back to Seattle and stay here again! Thank you!"
8538420,51486563,2015-10-20,29566947,Rami,"The apartment was beautiful with an amazing view. It had everything we needed to make our stay very enjoyable and pleasant. Terry was very nice and friendly, she took us on a tour in the area and showed us all the attraction points around us. She made great dining recommendations and was always available for everything we needed. "
8538420,51770796,2015-10-24,45407904,Luis,"The experience was INCREDIBLE!!! Terry was very helpful in accommodating what I needed for the event that I held there, which was to set up a romantic dinner with a beautiful view overlooking the Seattle skyline in order to propose to my girlfriend. Terry was very flexible in giving me the option of only renting it for several hours for this purpose. She even offered to pick up a bouquet from Pike's Market for me as she was already there running some errands. That was extremely thoughtful! 
  The home is huge and amazing and the view is spectacular.  One can see most of the Seattle waterfront from the Balcony.  My girlfriend and I loved the home and experience and will always remember how special it was. Thank you Terry for all your help, it was greatly appreciated.   "
8538420,52338743,2015-10-28,39177911,Jasmin,The room was very cozy. And the view was just spectacular. We only stayed their for a night but wish we would had stayed longer. And terry was super accomadating even though we had a late flight out she accomadated us with everything we needed. Over all great place to stay and host is awesome too.
8538420,52881025,2015-11-02,46125139,Andrew,"Terry was an amazing host. The place was spotless and had everything you needed to feel right at home. Many small things to even better the (website hidden): sonos sound system, frosty cups and growler, and ice cream.
The view was quite amazing as well. I would absolutely stay here again."
8538420,55111518,2015-11-28,41474894,Jessica,"Terry welcomed my parents and grandma personally! Told them about the place, got them settled. She leaves coffee for the morning which is a treat to those who don't know the area well!! "
2056276,17599541,2014-08-14,19524681,Stefano,"Grace is a great host: super available and was very easy to find an agreement for my stay.
The room was very big, simply furnished, clean and light. I had my own bathroom and access to a fully equipped kitchen, that I didn't had the chance to use.
Very nice house in a very nice neighbour, quite and safe. 
Walking 5 minutes you can reach the bus stop that brings you to the city centre in 20-30 minutes. While you have the University District and the WU campus at walking distance.
I definitely recommend this room and this host."
1950446,9351766,2013-12-23,10348417,Christine,This loft was spacious and has a homey feel to it...very comfortable Loved the place!
1950446,9505266,2013-12-31,9944081,Percy,"Although I did not get the chance to meet Anie, the place we stayed at was just as advertised. It was a great space for 7 people with ample space for sleep. We enjoyed our stay here!"
1950446,10139666,2014-02-02,11558173,Carol,"The apartment was very bare-bones and didn't have any kitchenware which made it impossible to do anything at the apartment, such as heat water.  The heat in the apartment was not intuitive and there weren't any instructions (or very many blankets), so it was VERY cold.  There were beds for 4 people, which was nice. The parking was very useful and Gavin was quick to respond to texts and emails. This was my first airbnb experience and it was just okay. I don't think I would rent this apartment again unless it was summer time."
1950446,10213638,2014-02-06,328672,Kylie,"This is apartment is adorable! There were 4 of us and it was a great size and very comfortable. Plus, Gavin was able to get it ready for us on just a few hours notice which was wonderful.

Pros: 
- lots of character 
- very clean
- GORGEOUS view 
- easy access to the freeway
- lock box for getting/depositing keys (quick and simple!)

Cons:
- no internet
- designated parking spot is difficult to get into
- on a very busy street
- no cooking utensils to heat water or anything on the stove 

Overall, it was perfect for a quick stay and gave me a chance to see a part of Seattle other than the usual tourist stops."
1950446,10328155,2014-02-13,9146522,Mary,Gavin is very responsive and will work with you to make sure you have a great stay!
1950446,10868184,2014-03-10,6625305,Sheena,"The place was convenient for us to go into Downtown Seattle and not costly. 

Had a good time and place to stay. "
1950446,10910933,2014-03-12,7425919,Kendra,"This apartment was perfect!  Its located close to everything, the location definitely cannot be beat.  It was exactly as pictured and described.  Wifi worked great and kitchen was stocked with everything we needed to cook/eat with.  We slept so well in the dark bedrooms with blackout curtains.  We would definitely stay here again!"
1950446,10987871,2014-03-16,12264536,Christopher,"The place was exactly what we had expected when looking for places to stay in Seattle.  We had a party of 6 and there was plenty of space for everyone.  The view from the patio was just astounding and a great introduction to the city.  The location was perfect, we were close to restaurants and the waterfront, as well as a short drive to downtown and other parts of Seattle.  The keyless entry and the fully stocked kitchen were great additions for our group to get settled in.  Definite recommended place to stay in Seattle.  Great host who was easy to communicate with, great location to explore all parts of Seattle, and the place felt like a home away from home."
1950446,11034679,2014-03-17,12996499,Kirsten,"We absolutely loved staying at Gavin's property. It was the perfect size for the 4 of us, loved the porch, and great location. Thank you, Gavin! "
1950446,11361482,2014-03-31,3490399,Gemma,"Great location in the Eastlake area. A native of Seattle myself I was happy to see the place was up the street from my favorite spots (Zoo Bar and Vox Coffee). Front room gets a bit chilly, but rest of house is warm. Perfect place for Spring vacations. Great view from the patio. Front of house faces freeway, but sound is more soothing than anything. Make sure you have a compact car if you plan to use the parking spot, bit of a squeeze!"
1950446,11621880,2014-04-09,519526,Tawan,"The rooms are very spacious! The location is just so great. Though not a walkable distant to pike place, it's a great location to explore Seattle city area by your own car since it's just next to Lake Union with free parking lot in front of the house. Very quiet. Gavin didn't show up but it was great in a sense that v could get in and get out of the accommodation freely without feeling guilty to interrupt the owner or other guests in the middle of the night or in the early morning. Kitchenware is all equipped. Highly recommend for all young travelers whose bio-clock is uncommon or elderly who want to stay in quiet place and easy access to the city for just a few minutes drive."
1950446,11663726,2014-04-11,5778450,Chom,"We found the apartment to be bright and airy but smaller than it appeared and not very clean. The kitchen floor was sticky (spilled juice from previous guests didn't get mopped). Living room floor was not vacuumed. Bathroom had no toilet paper (luckily there was a box of Kleenex around). We found a note by the door saying towels were in the dryer in the basement. A glass vase on the high table was cracked with sharp, jagged rims. Kitchen was well stocked for eating take-out food, but not for cooking. We planned to make pasta for 8 people (apt's max occupancy) but only found a tiny pot (less than 6 inches wide) with no lid. 

It's located right next to I-5 -- be prepared for traffic background noise. Navigating our mini-van around a low brick wall to get into the parking space was also quite tricky.  

I'm not sure if we'd go back unless housekeeping improved significantly.  "
1950446,11998087,2014-04-21,4873843,Shermayne,"Perfect apartment for our stay in Seattle. Very easy to get around by bus, taxi or Uber. There are some cute little bars/restaurants right down the road as well. I would definitely recommend staying here! "
1950446,12563196,2014-05-05,11107331,Sunanda,"This home is located in a great proximity to the city and is only a short cab ride downtown.  Parking is quite easy to find in addition to the driveway parking.  Bring ear plugs as this house is very close to the highway and can be quite noisy (especially if you are used to sleeping in a quiet room)  Kitchen does not have any staples - so if you plan on cooking, bring your own supplies."
1950446,12844368,2014-05-12,8619184,Ivan,Great place to crash after a day of exploring the city. Note that it is literally right next to the highway but the view from the balcony looks out the other way toward the lakes. Really enjoyed our stay!
1950446,12999511,2014-05-17,10211017,Milana,"We were a group of 8 who stayed in the apartment for 2 nights. Overall, the place wasn't too bad but compared to other places I've stayed at through airbnb, this wasn't the best. 

Pros: 
-easy keyless check in and check out
-location (Eastlake, just north of Capitol hill): near a lake and near lots of public transportation and coffee shops. 
-back porch: amazing view of lake union
Cons:
-location: front of house faces the highway which makes for traffic noise at night. 
-parking spot: good for a compact car but we had difficulty maneuvering our SUV around the low brick wall. Only the smaller SUV would fit. The other bigger SUV would not. In the description, it said there was ample street parking for a 2nd car, but all the street parking that I saw required a residential permit. I finally got in contact with Gavin's cleaning lady Pushpa, who offered a parking spot at a church parking alot across the highway near one of her properties. It was great that they were able to solve our parking dilemma but it was also inconvenient to have to walk 10 min. across a highway to get to one of the cars. 
-cleanliness: 3 stars. It wasn't overtly dirty, but there was mold in the shower and cheerios under one of the mattresses of the bed and the sofa. 
-communication: strangely enough, I could never get a hold of Gavin when we had an issue (1. parking when we checked in, 2. when we planned to stay there a few days later and it was double-booked). I mostly communicated with Pushpa, who was very willing to help but didn't seem to be in communication with Gavin. 

We also had the dilemma that we tried to book another night there a few days later which was difficult to do through airbnb. When I talked to Gavin about it, he said not to worry about it and that it would be okay and he would hold the place for us. By the time we were there, he had booked other people to stay the night we werent there and had double-booked us for the other night. Then they wanted to offer us another place that was double the cost. The whole exchange was very shady and we finally just opted to get a hotel instead. 

This place is nice and probably okay if you don't mind noise and don't have a huge car with you. But if anything goes wrong, it might be difficult to get it sorted out with the owners. "
1950446,13195778,2014-05-21,14519228,Eva,"房东的回复很迅速，房间干净，床舒服，虽然紧靠5号高速公路，但房间隔音很好，晚上睡觉很安静。
有一个大阳台，在厨房和阳台上可以看湖景，视野极好。
厨房很方便，但烧开水只能用咖啡机，我自己带了热水壶。

The landlord replies very quickly, the rooms are clean and comfortable. Although the house is beside the highway, it is still quiet at night and we slept well. There is a big balcony with a great view outside. There is only free parking for an hour near the house, if  you want to park over night I'd recommend parking at 2244 Eastlake Ave E Seattle, WA 98102."
1950446,13238229,2014-05-23,12303890,John,I would of liked to have known there was issues with certain things. The internet was shotty and the dryer didn't work. I had communicated with Gavin asking about where the dryer was located. He informed me that it might not be working. I would of liked to have known these things prior to arrival so I could better accommodate my needs. Other than those things Gavin was prompt to getting back to me and helpful with my questions and the house was a nice place to stay. I'd stay again. 
1950446,13351580,2014-05-26,13418320,Catherine,"The listing was as expected and Gavin was totally and quickly responsive to our questions.  The location, while it can be noisy with the freeway (though it quickly became white noise so did not interfere with sleeping), was terrific; two short blocks from Eastlake's lovely restaurants and coffee (Voxx).  We had a car and  driving around the city was very convenient from Boylston, and though we didn't use it the bus service downtown on Eastlake would be very convenient as well.  We were a group of 4 adults and felt the apartment was roomy and comfortable."

The parking space was very difficult to get into, even with a smaller car. The bathroom is filled with mold, and the shower is very awkward to use The place was clean on the surface, but dust bunnies and dirt lurked in all corners and under furniture. Overall we would stay here again, but only if the place received a thorough cleaning. "
1950446,15138189,2014-07-03,10753486,Kurt,"Since we arrived in the US we have stayed in several AirBNB places. I always thought maybe we’d get a dud and this place is it!
Gavin was pretty hard to reach but was accommodating once we got ahold of him and Pushpa was easy to reach but needed 24 hours notice..

I will list the top problems ( there are more);
1)      Dirty sheets (That’s just unprofessional and unhygenic).Stains…hair. 
2)      No toilet paper on arrival
3)      1 x tiny pot that you can probably cook an egg in
4)      No kettle to boil water
5)      Dirty Fridge ( all iced up and bits of food)
6)      No microwave
8)      Dirty bath - black scum marks
9)      The entrance way and hall way was caked on dirt (probably from the freeway).
10)   When I rang the manager to tell her we had no toilet paper she said she would drop some around tomorrow. We found a supermarket and bought our own.

Its a  shame as the actual apartment / location is fine ( location OK, Space OK, view OK)…its just really really dirty and has no basic essentials. ( Kettle, Loo paper...a couple of pots..clean sheets!!)

Outdoor furniture on the balcony would also be really great so we could sit and enjoy the view!

"
1950446,15526249,2014-07-11,13484748,Doug,"This place is close to the bus lines, so transportation was easy.  We watched the fireworks from our balcony, which was excellent.  It was a pretty easy stay.  Everything worked okay, and Pushpa, the girl who took care of any questions we had was attentive."
1950446,15908902,2014-07-18,9042269,Eugenel,"The house is nicely situated by Lake Union. The transit was close to home making all parts of Seattle very accessible for us. The house itself is a nice older craftsman style home that has great charm at first look. 

I enjoyed the city of Seattle very much. However, our short stay was met with abnormally hot weather. While I can usually tolerate mid-nineties weather, we were fairly uncomfortable throughout our stay due to the lack of air-conditioning within the home. When the weather dropped to cooler temperatures, we could open the windows but could not sleep due to the proximity of the home to the freeway (in front of the house). Even with the windows closed, we could hear the roars of every car as it zoomed by on the expressway. To compensate, we slept in the living room (the room furthest away from the noise source) until the traffic and the temperature were compromising (~3am).

The home would be fine during cooler months. I did like how the home looks and the beds were fairly comfy. However, the home needs new windows to dampen the sound at the very least and a portable swamp cooler when the summer temps get above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. "
1950446,16075721,2014-07-22,13503229,Rebekah,"The pictures on the website far exceed the interior condition of this unit.  The floors were filthy, the tub was dirty, there were no screens on the windows except for one bedroom and no a/c.  Some windows were painted shut and could not be lifted.  The unit needed airing out! My daughter had to wrap her pillows with sheets since there weren't any pillow cases on them.  The closets had dust balls and garbage from previous renters.  5 towels were provided for 3 nights- no washcloths or hand towels were provided.  The sleeper sofa was in very poor condition and the upholstery of both sofas was filthy.  There were no privacy curtains or shades on the bathroom window and there were houses with views right next door.  We were charged a cleaning fee, but it was quite apparent that the unit had not been thoroughly cleaned prior to our arrival.  We had just come from a VRBO rental for 3 days and this unit paled in comparison.  Mr. Walker has a lot to learn about how to make guests feel comfortable and welcome in this unit.  We couldn't wait to leave each day.  That is not how a vacation should make people feel."
1950446,16540524,2014-07-29,4666600,Juan,"The apartment was exactly as described. Totally worth the price and the location is great! Great view from the deck. Right off Hwy 5, easy to find and close to downtown and Lake Union. We slept 5 adults comfortably. I'd recommend this place. Thanks Gavin! "
1950446,16651212,2014-07-31,12094730,Shawna,"Gavin was quick to respond to any questions that we had.  He made it easy to get into the property with detailed instructions.  
The property was in a good location for what we wanted to see and do.  We were able to walk a few blocks to catch a bus to Pike Place.  There were a few restaurants that we were also able to walk to and two grocery stores.
The only warning I would share with potential guests as that the property is located on a busy street and right next to the interstate.  We found it very loud.
We were disappointed that there wasn't any patio furniture as we were looking forward to sharing a drink on the deck after our children went to bed."
1950446,17142465,2014-08-08,2436125,Amy,"The best part about this place is the location. The neighborhood was great to walk around in & it was easy enough to get in/out with our (small) car, with quick access to anywhere in the city. The inside of the house itself was OK, but certainly not the best or cleanest. We stayed during one of the hottest weeks of the year & we could only find one fan, so it was a bit difficult to fall asleep each night.

Gavin & Pushpa were both very nice & easy to get a hold of, and while it wasn't the best place I've ever stayed, it suited our needs just fine."
1950446,17243778,2014-08-09,19253215,Penny,"Awesome location, and we really loved the balcony with views over the lake. Great place, thanks Gavin!"
1950446,17399521,2014-08-11,16645403,Shannon,"House was as described and fit our needs perfectly for a quick overnight stay. We actually didn't meet Gavin but he was very easy to deal with through messaging always responding very quickly. Nice area of town, couple of cool coffee shops down the hill to the water.  Only $12 taxi ride to downtown, so pretty close.
Thanks"
1950446,17472673,2014-08-12,214019,Ruby,"Location and size was perfect for two adults and two kids -
As we did have a car the apartment was conveniently located off the freeway with a parking space and SO SO close to where we wanted to be. 
Upon arriving we took a stroll in the area and found a great playground for the kids to play and closer to the apartment a great pizza restaurant and convenience store for snacks. 
Gavin was quick to respond with all and any questions.
Cleanliness was 3 out of 5 which is a bummer since we are charged for cleaning service. :-/
"
1950446,18396009,2014-08-26,10978772,Melanie,"Our stay was a pleasant one in this very spacious and conveniently located unit. When we had questions and concerns, the host answered us immediately and completely.  "
1950446,18701045,2014-08-30,20692236,Briony,"Great place, wonderful location near a cute village and supermarkets and the floating houses! We found the place very clean and elegant, the only issue was the lack of chairs and a dining table to sit around and eat. There weren't many wine glasses or cooking implements either, but on the whole we would definitely stay there again."
1950446,18864955,2014-09-01,20690534,Alex,"This place was great! Having a view of the water, and watching the pontoon planes take off and land, was fun for all of our guests.  The neighborhood was beautiful and the home is easy to find and return to after a night out. House was clean and quiet. I would definitely come back"
1950446,18977448,2014-09-03,20313901,Tiffany,"Fastest response ever which worked out perfect t since it was a last minute idea and getting a little late. The location was perfect, almost could see downtown from the front. The beds were very comfortable, which was about all I cared about after my drive in from Portland. I was surprised there was no TV, which didn't bother me since I do not watch TV . My only complaint was after seeing the photo of the tub, I had in in my head to take a hot bath. There was no stopper so I used a pillow case, worked for me but I did have to fill the tub up with the shower since it wasn't even set up for a bath. So my 2 recommendations would be 1. Buy a tub stopper and 2. maybe invest in a nice set of towels since people could go pay 200 for a luxury hotel with nice towels. Other then that I loved the place, great view, great location and comfy beds. Thanks again. "
1950446,19354223,2014-09-10,3942078,Chris,"A last minute trip to Seattle left me not worrying about hotel rooms until arrival - mistake, as everything was booked. Prices by the airport were $500+ a night. 

Luckily, Gavin was there with instant booking. Basically a suite that I would have been paying $2k for. Place was clean, centrally located, with parking with very comfy beds. 

Some freeway noise, but the price you pay for easy access. Water pressure was good, wifi excellent and view of the Lake/balcony was a plus. "
1950446,19909069,2014-09-20,3503519,Rebekah,"We arrived only for one night & found the place easily. Great location, as long as you are comfortable with the sound of the freeway. Close to lake union and very accessible to many areas of Seattle. 
Gavin was very nice and responded to all questions, as did the house cleaner, Pushpa. 
The internet didn't work. There isn't a TV, which was perfectly fine for us, we don't watch it--but to do any kind of work on our commuter was not possible. 
Overall, the place was dirty. The oven had foil with remains of food from the last person staying there. The couches, walls, and floors all seemed like they needed a good cleaning. The place could be rad, but needs a serious makeover. The screens on the windows were old, and some of the windows stick and are hard to open for fresh air. 
There was only enough hot water for one shower, which was a bummer.
There wasn't any hand soap in the bathroom--or any soap for that matter. The top two towels had a smell of cologne, which was a big turn off. 
My husband and I felt a little ripped off and would have paid more for a cleaner place. We pay the cleaning fee, so I am confused what this charge is actually for. I guess peoples standard of ""clean"" varies from the next...

1950446,20636585,2014-10-02,1094944,Sara,"It was great to book instantly with prompt communication.  This is a super cute older 2 bedroom apartment.  Very very basic amenities.  No tv, radio, ipod dock, soaps, kitchen supplies or anything.  It's a great location that's easily accessible on and off freeway.  The back porch has a nice view.  Highly recommend Sarafina's happy hour just around the corner.  Superb Italian food = hand made pasta dishes for just $7!!  It's nice to have several stores, bars & restaurants within a couple minute walk.  Free parking onsite is excellent :)"
1950446,21566266,2014-10-19,12512,Shane,Nice place and was as described. Easy to get in with door codes. Clean house and nice large patio. I never had to deal with anyone and had no problems. 
1950446,21649021,2014-10-20,7003309,Elizabeth,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1950446,21899383,2014-10-26,19244934,Britney,"Great experience!  The house was a good size and a wonderful, big patio that had a view of Lake Union.  Excellent location!"
1950446,22131618,2014-10-30,17924326,Renaud,"Très chouette appartement, avec un emplacement de parking, facile d'accès. L'utilisation de codes pour rentrer plutôt que d'une clé est très pratique.

L'appartement était très propre. Apparemment, il y aurait eu un changement de service de nettoyage depuis les dernières reviews. Trois lits très confortables, et un salon avec deux fauteuils. De quoi loger pas mal de monde ! 

Un arrêt de bus juste en face de la maison fait qu'on peut se déplacer assez facilement. Seulement 10 minutes de bus ($2.25) pour aller à Pike Place.

On est juste à côté de l'autoroute donc on entend un peu les voitures, mais pas vraiment dérangeant si vous avez l'habitude d'habiter en ville.

Le seul point négatif concerne les fenêtres qui sont aussi vieilles que la maison et parfois ne s'ouvrent pas, parfois ne se ferment pas. C'est le cas dans l'une des chambres : une fenêtre est bloquée et laisse une petite ouverture, ce qui risque de faire un peu baisser la température en hiver."
1950446,22525491,2014-11-09,21341474,Michael,"Nice place. Plenty of towels and blankets. Good central area not too far from downtown, Capitol hill and UW. Enjoyed the place, would stay here again."
1950446,22639292,2014-11-10,1109407,J & B,Such a beautiful home!  We really enjoyed our stay here. Everything  was easy about the process. 
1950446,22783843,2014-11-14,23315248,Nzau,"The place was just as advertised, easy to access and Gavin was very reachable.  I would stay at the residence again."
1950446,23114013,2014-11-23,3056974,Jayme,"Great place for a weekend trip! Clean place, comfortable beds and lots of character. Super easy to get in and out. Driveway parking is a nice plus!"
1950446,23730492,2014-12-08,24413788,Nikhil,"I had a wonderful time staying at Gavin's place. The apartment was beautiful and spacious and had a fantastic view of Lake Union from the balcony. Even though it was situated next to a highway, the noise was barely noticeable. The neighborhood is great and it was surprisingly easy to walk to bars and restaurants. My favorites were Voxx Coffee Shop and Little Water Cantina. Gavin was a gracious host and I highly recommend the apartment to anyone looking for a place in Seattle/East Lake area."
1950446,23806534,2014-12-10,8544127,Kain,"Great place, clean and easy to find. "
1950446,23965848,2014-12-15,2812512,Lola,"We had a great experience here. While the street is busy, the space is far removed from the hustle and bustle. It's very relaxing, warm, and has great views (even while on the toilet:) The entry situation was super easy and the host was very accommodating. The decor is welcoming but not cluttered. Thanks!"
1950446,24078874,2014-12-19,23635124,Eric,"I had booked this for 3 guests from out of town. They very much enjoyed their stay. The apartment was clean and cozy, exactly what we were hoping for. Gavin was prompt to address all our questions. I would book it again for sure."
1950446,24217250,2014-12-22,21848161,Stephfon,"We had a really great stay here. The location is really central, and was a short distance to Capital Hill and downtown, which is where we spent most of our time. Gavin was sure to check in with me as soon as we arrived, which was nice considering that this stay has key less entry which eliminates the need to coordinate meet up ( which is also awesome). The neighborhood is really cute with a few convenience stores, bars, and restaurants, and there are pamphlets and other info available to you inside the foyer of the building."
1950446,24230556,2014-12-23,10644110,Bryan,"This place is sweet. Definitely built with a great deal of care. The back porch has a sweet view and check in was very easy. Know that the parking space he's referring to is a sideways spot right in front of the brick porch. We were confused about that at first. Lots of natural light. Overall an awesome stay, I wish we had had more time here."
1950446,24402909,2014-12-28,11517999,Karol,The house was easy to find and the entry lock system worked well. Gavin was very responsive when we had questions regarding the apartment. Great little neighborhood.
1950446,24861752,2015-01-03,24274313,Katherine,"We had this wonderful spacious place all to ourselves which felt like a cozy urban cabin. It was so well situated, with great Italian and sandwich and coffee shops nearby (plus a market!) and easy access to the highway. Gavin was excellent about reaching out. "
1950446,25118823,2015-01-06,19130417,Chris,Gavin's apartment was perfect for us. The neighborhood is safe and there are a couple of restaurants within walking distance but having a car is a plus. There is a parking space provided which is a plus for us. In better weather there is a great porch with views of of Seattle. There is no microwave or TV but the internet worked great. There was an electric heater for some extra warmth. We also noticed a pack and play in the closet. Don't worry about being near 5 we hardly heard anything from street noise. It is especially nice to have key pad entry. Thanks Gavin
1950446,25211898,2015-01-09,23050488,Tamra,"Gavin was great at communicating quickly.  His place is in a convenient location central to downtown Seattle, freeways, restaurants.  It is a large unit with lots of space for multiple people, plus a deck.  If you're sensitive to noise, it's a close to a freeway, but inside the living area is just fine.  This is not an owner-inhabited unit, so there are no knick-knacks or clutter.  If Gavin's cleaning people did a good job, this unit is a good value for inner-city living and has it's own parking spot, which is a plus.  This is a super-convenient place for a stay in Seattle.  Thank you Gavin."
1950446,25315671,2015-01-12,24340252,Zaki,"Loved this place! The flat was cozy and quaint with lots of light. There were plenty of essentials and didn't feel that anything was lacking. The place is centrally located with easy access to highway. The parking spot was a plus. Thanks for having us Gavin, we had a great time in Seattle!"
1950446,25412285,2015-01-15,24841840,Aaron,"Gavin has a great house, and was very accommodating. His house was clean and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend. Thanks Gavin! "

1950446,26070545,2015-02-02,21899683,Ally,This cozy apartment was perfect for our little weekend getaway! Gavin was excellent at communicating and his recommendation for a great place to watch the Super Bowl was spot on! It was so relaxing to  walk into a clean and well presented home. I wish we could have stayed longer. 
1950446,26137013,2015-02-04,11277867,Sam,"A family emergency came up and I was unable to make the reservation work. Unfortunately, there was a strict policy so couldn't cancel, but Gavin was helpful and communicative regardless. "
1950446,26302604,2015-02-09,11082298,Alysia,Our visit was great in Seattle. The location of this stay worked really well for us to explore many different areas of the city. It was near bus lines and close to a few useful spots (food/convenient store/coffee). The patio was nice as well. Thanks for the stay!
1950446,26456023,2015-02-13,18217954,Jordan,"Loved our place, location is great, free parking was a bonus, tons of sleeping space, there was a large deck attached to the unit we rented and it was fantastic! "
1950446,26601512,2015-02-16,25749914,Clifford,"The host was very good.  Gavin and Airbnb were prompt and professional.  The neighborhood was OK.  The location was good in terms of proximity to things important to us but looks out on I5.  The other side, however, had view of Lake Union."
1950446,26745480,2015-02-18,5640408,Sarah,Nice and fit the description - great to have your own parking spot.
1950446,27076497,2015-02-24,19799955,Christopher,"My flight was unfortunately overbooked so I was unable to stay at the place but my friend who I originally was traveling with did stay and said that the place was great, everything was as expected. Sad I wasn't able to make it. "
1950446,27119837,2015-02-25,11610619,Michael Alexander,It was a great place to stay last min!  Good location!  Cute unit with great features!
1950446,27318759,2015-03-02,2665042,Peter & Courtney,"Gavin's space is clean and comfortable and very reasonably priced. We enjoyed our stay. The front bedroom does have a fair amount of traffic noise, but the other bedroom is well sheltered from this. The apartment does have a pack and play crib. If you're traveling with an infant like we were this is very helpful!"
1950446,27852097,2015-03-13,28631974,Andrew,The place was decently priced. Great location close to downtown area. 
1950446,28213507,2015-03-20,19544441,Amy,Gavin was quick to respond to any question by phone and by email. Very easy to work with. Great stay and we have future area already booked with him. 
1950446,28304502,2015-03-22,19247140,Natasja,"Lovely old house. Close to highway so very easy to find and great that it has a parking spot. We discovered the neighborhood by foot and
took the bus to downtown (bus 66)
Also some great restaurants close by. 
A welcome guide with tips about neighborhood and bus routes etc would be helpful. I'm glad I brought my computer so we could google all that we needed. 
"
1950446,28612067,2015-03-27,15702211,Rong,Nice place to stay....fairly close to all the attractions LOL
1950446,28698584,2015-03-29,25279044,Hannah,Our stay was wonderful! Gavin's place is beautiful. It slept 6 adults comfortably and we loved being able to make breakfast for ourselves in the morning. There is a great convenience store just down the hill. The linens were nice and check in/check out process was a breeze. The one suggestion we have is to improve the toilet function. We had to wait long periods of time for the bowl to refill. We think it had something to do with water pressure but aren't sure. Not a huge problem though! We enjoyed our stay so much :)
1950446,28989735,2015-04-02,25420385,Danna,We were so happy and satisfying for this house. We got just what we expected. The house in a great location close to downtown. The house was clean. The most important thing that the sound insulation is very good.
1950446,29387579,2015-04-07,1298783,Sarah,"The apartment was in a great location and had a beautiful view of the city. Plenty of space for 4 people, but I could see it feeling a bit crowded with more. We didn't communicate with Gavin while we were there because we had a friend in the area who helped us navigate the city, so that wasn't a problem for us. The plumbing/water pressure in the bathroom wasn't great and made showering and toilet flushing difficult. It wasn't as clean as we expected, the floor was pretty dusty and the shower curtain wasn't great. Other than those issues we were happy with the stay. "
1950446,29597221,2015-04-10,24997508,Djfoss73,"House was clean, getting in and out was easy, everything was exactly as advertised."
1950446,29919501,2015-04-14,28309428,Euphemia,"The location of this place is awesome. Despite its close proximity with I-5, we didn't hear any noise as long as we didn't open any window or the balcony door. Gavin provided some coffees and teas for us and few amenities in the pantry. Wi-Fi connection was fast. The beds were comfortable. There was no TV, but we didn't need one since we only use the place to sleep. It would be nice to have washing & drying machine though. Check in/out was easy. This is an upper level area and we love how it has a lot of windows (thus lots of natural lights) and the view of the lake is great. The water pressure in the bathroom wasn't great in terms of taking shower and flushing the toilet. It took a while for the toilet bowl to fill up. The bath tub can be deep cleaned since there were some lime build up on the side. Other than those issues, we were happy with our stay."
1950446,30442829,2015-04-22,15198924,Grace,"Gavin was easy to deal with and the place way perfect for our group of 5. Very cosy and had everything we needed, would definitely stay here again. "
1950446,30875977,2015-04-28,29487748,Katie,"This place was perfect! A great space for my 2 friends and I to use as home base. Close to Eastlake to walk down and grab a coffee and close to public transportation. Capitol Hill is only a 5 min drive if you have a car or a $6 uber. Gavin was super nice, I met him the day I arrived the space was quaint and clean. I would definitely use this bnb again.  "
1950446,31050048,2015-05-01,9061499,Chris,We were 5 adults passing thru Seattle looking for a place to stay close to the downtown area for one night. Gavin's place is a nice heritage home close to town and bus routes. The apartment is nice and comfortable and worked out well for us. The bathroom shower was a bit limited and it's close to the highway so it's a bit noisy but expected as its close to town. We would still recommend it for its convenience and it was clean; it's also a much better option than boring expensive big chain hotels! Thanks for the stay Gavin.
1950446,31195723,2015-05-03,13007560,Elena,"Our entire experience was wonderful. Gavin gave us all the information we needed, and the apartment was adorable. "
1950446,31831422,2015-05-10,3286401,Sasha,For the price it was expected. The smell was a little musty in the apartment and the hallway smelled like hot garbage. The shower was full of character. It was great having parking and the neighborhood was really awesome. Gavin was very attentive via email.
1950446,31944897,2015-05-12,29344888,Marie-Claude,Gavin à  un appartement qui est parfait pour aller visiter la ville à  pied... à  maximum une heure  du centre ville et de tout ce qu'il  faut  voir.  Un vieil édifice  donc rien de droit et un peu de moisissure.... ( c'est normal vu l'âge  du bâtiment )  La cuisine est équipé pour un déjeuner  ou un dîner mais pas un grand repas gastronomique. ... pas de table pour manger donc la table du salon nous a servi de salle à  dîner.   Merci Gavin
1950446,32138669,2015-05-14,25607896,Sara,Gavin's place was exactly as advertised. We had no problems while we are staying and everything was clean and cozy. The location was great too- central to everything and easy access to the freeway! Parking was convenient and we loved the back porch with a view of the city! Gavin was easy to communicate with and responsive via phone and text. 
1950446,32314363,2015-05-17,2428066,Misha,The space was wonderful. Our group had an easy time getting into the unit with Gavin's clear instructions. Everything was clean and tidy with charming details of an older well-loved home. Really enjoyable stay!
1950446,32677828,2015-05-20,7164853,Lova,We had a great time at Gavin's place. Everything was clean and well prepared. Great location as well! Would definitely stay here again.
1950446,32895044,2015-05-23,30355858,Sarah,"Definitely a cute little place conveniently located right next to the i5. Parking right next to the house made it easy to park our rental car. The bathroom was a little cramped and could use some updating, but the spacious rooms and the cozy living room made up for that. Could get a little noisy since it's right by the freeway, but as long as you keep the windows closed it should be fine. Overall a nice place to stay!"
1950446,33662823,2015-05-31,29599666,Izzy,"The three day stay there is great. We pretty enjoy seeing the beautiful sunset while sitting at the balcony, feeling the cool wind. And the host offers a complete set of cookers, so mom can make delicious home made food. But during the day, it can be kinda hot without air conditioner. So I do suggest the host can offer a fan. That would be much better :]"
1950446,33824611,2015-06-01,26858333,Adam,"Gavin's space was great for our brief stay - spacious and comfortable, not to mention the view off to the side on the patio. It's also near a bus line, which was ideal for us in a pinch. Thanks for everything!"
1950446,34043852,2015-06-03,33454255,Michael Alexander,As usual since I've stayed at Gavin place before the check in was very easy and check out was very smooth allowing me extra time to pack and get ready. the place was very clean and had all the extra amenities in the bathroom and kitchen.
1950446,34146413,2015-06-05,3638658,Rishi,"Great place and location! Great view of Seattle, parking spot and good access to highway. The shower is the one moot point and could definitely use an upgrade. Overall, great experience "
1950446,34766815,2015-06-12,8105985,Allistair,"Just as described, it was a great stay and the lake view cannot be beat."
1950446,35349370,2015-06-17,8063743,Yvonne,"Check in so easy, and parking spot very useful. Shower leaves a little to be desired!  Great proximity to walk to shops, restaurants and the harbour."
1950446,35466839,2015-06-19,11968155,Brittany,"The host was prompt with communication and answered all of our questions. The apartment is in a great location for both walking and other transportation (right near the I-5 on ramp and the buses and transit in Eastlake). The entry keypad is very convenient, especially if you arrive in Seattle very early or late. The apartment was clean and spacious. The shower leaves a bit to be desired but otherwise I have no complaints about the apartment."
1950446,36011494,2015-06-24,28432436,Francisco,Appreciated the coffee and found the listing exactly as stated.
1950446,36172183,2015-06-26,29594649,Sebastian,"The place was great, very clean and in a good location. Very soft bed sheets! And the place is very easy access due to the code lock doors. Thank you!"
1950446,36757501,2015-07-01,26864413,Thomas,Everything was as it was mentioned in the description. 
1950446,37601989,2015-07-08,35984826,Chris,Josh's place is well represented on the site. His itinerary communications provide all you need for easy entrance and exit. Josh is highly responsive to  questions and offers helpful tips about the surrounding area. The area is safe with easy access to downtown. Two moms traveling with two boys felt safe. Easy walking to coffee and restaurants. The bathroom tub could use a resurface for aesthetics. All in all great place in convenient location.
1950446,37759627,2015-07-10,27326005,Nicole,"Our AirBnB experience with Joshua's apartment was mediocre at best.  Let me start of first by saying that Joshua was a great host. He responded to all my inquires promptly and even let us check in a little early. The location of the apartment was amazing. It was so convenient to get to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle, and it was wonderful to have a parking spot since street parking is pretty tricky. 
What we were disappointed with was the actual apartment. The apartment was spacious, however, the photos we felt were a little misleading. The bathroom was growing mold all over the ceiling, and there was no curtain for the window so anyone could see right in. It also looked like there was water damage on the ceiling in the bedroom with two beds because the paint was bubbling quite a bit over one of the beds. The ""patio furniture"" on the deck only included two chairs and a small table. Not really what I was expecting. It had been unseasonaly hot in Seattle, and the apartment did not have any air conditioning. I knew this from the listing, so I requested some fans to help with the heat. We only got one, so that meant that only one room got to take advantage of it at night. 

Overall, we had a great time visiting Seattle, but the apartment needs some help. We understand that it an older place, and it has character, but I would prefer no mold on the bathroom ceiling and a ceiling that doesn't look like it is going to fall on you. "
1950446,38460847,2015-07-15,24807661,Benjamin,"Josh was great - answered phone when I accidentally called him and was very pleasant.

Likewise, place was fantastic.  A great location and very spacious and well maintained.  Probably the only downside was I couldn't figure out the hot water on the bathtub so had a few brisk constitutionals during my stay. :)

Would absolutely go back if I was in Seattle.  Fantastic BnB."
1950446,38598530,2015-07-17,13069740,Samuel,"Entry/exit really easy.  Apartment was clean, comfortable and spacious, just as advertised.  Good ventilation.  Nice beds and towels.  Kitchen had what we needed.  A little noisy, being so close to US 5, but it's the city.  I recommend this place.
Sam"
1950446,38750369,2015-07-18,21498385,Jennifer,Thanks Joshua for the amazing place to stay! :) it was just as described in the listing... I had texted Joshua a few times during our stay with questions and he replied back promptly and was very kind. The place has a great view and www the perfect place for my family and I to stay. Thanks again Joshua big we ever need a place in Seattle again we will look you up! 
1950446,39045326,2015-07-20,36280628,Tina,"This was a great loacation. We were able to walk to the water, coffeeshop and market.  Easy drive to everywhere else we went.  House was clean, beds were comfortable. Everything you minimalistically needed was provided.  The shower really needs to be fixed/improved.  This was a great spot to stay.  "
1950446,39557093,2015-07-24,38044447,Sophia,"Quick response, nice host, but The property is on the busy street, too much noises "
1950446,39734877,2015-07-26,26019950,Jennyfer,"Overall our group had a nice stay. The general consensus was the location & amenities served their purpose. Since our group rented both sides of the duplex we were able to have double the room to roam and relax which was excellent. Our only problem unfortunately was the cleanliness of the floors. Our feet were black from the soot/dirt. We found this problem in both units sadly. There were also misc items in the fridge (roast beef, ice cream, half container of juice etc) from previous guests. We did find everything to be accurate from the photos and enjoyed the central location. The house has it's charm and we very much appreciated having a comfortable bed to sleep in. The linens that were provided were great as well. The door key pad was a great feature and had no problem accessing either unit or the front door. Parking was also a plus."
1950446,40019738,2015-07-27,38589142,Khanh,My friend and I stayed upstairs in the 2 bedroom for one night to attend a wedding in Seattle.   We enjoyed the vintage modern feel and look of the place.  It was a nice pleasant stay and a great deal for the area with parking.   I will definitely consider staying here again.
1950446,40090910,2015-07-28,2037319,Joanna,"I came to Seattle with my parents, my aunt and two cousins so the six of us stayed in the apartment. The apartment was great and served our needs. It was clean but the place did have character. I received the wrong code to get into the front door but Joshua picked up my call and that was rectified quickly. "
1950446,40321499,2015-07-30,33364290,JoAnn,"Communication with the host and checkin was seamless. We loved the location and the place was very comfortable. The bathroom is a little small for 4 people to share, but all else great."
1950446,40611573,2015-08-01,27016446,Nicholas,Everything was provided as advertised in the listing.  The condo is in a great location and the space worked great for the bride and her bridesmaids as a location for getting ready for the big day!
1950446,43331291,2015-08-18,11492448,Amanda,Big enough for four of us to sleep comfortably. Easy to find. 
1950446,43468817,2015-08-19,10834259,Parker,"As expected. Clean, quiet, and a nice view. "
1950446,43570296,2015-08-20,32409743,Andrea,Joshua's place was nice. Had some character and was in a cool neighborhood.  Definitely would recommend staying there.
1950446,44452309,2015-08-26,11554392,Ahmad,"Nice apartment.  Walking distance to Union Lake, good restaurants as well as nice coffee shops.  I stayed with my wife and three children. We all enjoyed our stay here.   It is close to busy freeway but we closed the windows at night so the noise was not disturbing. "
1950446,45283556,2015-09-01,39710186,Laura,"Apartment was overall good. Good localization, very comfortable beds. Wi fi worked great. We also loved the speakers for music being available. Easy access, no Problem with door codes. Nice toiletry and blow dryer. Very close to small restaurants, very good mini market and coffee shops. Tranquil area and convenient 15min cab to downtown. Cute apartment with nice decor. 

Cleaning was alright but not amazing, specially some stained bed sheets. General state of apartment was good. Would also appreciate if there was more towels available for a longer period.

1950446,45624470,2015-09-04,42769689,Rahul,Place was great and josh was very helpful to all our needs
1950446,46675795,2015-09-12,32154182,Katie,We had such a nice time at Joshua's apartment. It was clean and the view of the sunset was amazing! The traffic is a little noisy but in a white noise kind of way. Communication with Joshua was easy and It was easy for us to grab an uber and see the city. Would definitely recommend Joshua's place!
1950446,46947878,2015-09-14,12179845,Mark,"Great Location and view of the Lake, couldn't have picked a better spot! Close to the nightlife and restaurants of Capital Hill and close proximity to some great parks! "
1950446,48113280,2015-09-23,35023629,Tamara,Joshua's place was inviting and very easy to get to. Joshua was a fantastic host. He was welcoming and responded quickly to messages. The location was ideal - centrally located and easy to get to. 
1950446,48404408,2015-09-26,16170288,Shawn Yih-Hsiang,"Joshua was a great host. Very quick on response, and the property was acurated as what described on the site. 

We had total 5 people eventually stay at the property. It was a family vacation, with two seniors. The property was nice and comfy. Clean, and had a fully functioning kitchen.

Location was great for guests who drive. 5-10 minutes drive to DT Seattle, super convenience. 

Only disadvantage of this property will be too close to I-5 so there is a noisy level there. It was fine with me, but two seniors did complain a little. 

Overall, highly recommend, especially for group who has car!!

"
1950446,48590145,2015-09-27,10350569,Susan,The place was nice and pretty cute - great for a group of 4 in Seattle for the weekend. Joshua was good at communicating with me about any questions I had. it was well located to get to downtown and many other neighborhoods in Seattle. 
1950446,49280803,2015-10-02,43156103,Cullen,"A real nice nook for writers. My first time using Airbnb. Checking in and leaving was a real breeze, the house and units are beautiful. I can't remember now why I used to do hotels. I feel like I was asleep."
1950446,49687088,2015-10-05,32043496,Nick,"Me and a few friends (4 people total, one couple) shared Joshua's place for a weekend and it turned out to be the perfect option.  Great location, clean apt and easy check-in/out.   "
1950446,50070986,2015-10-09,19783742,Karen,This house was perfect! It housed me and my 4 friends with plenty of space. It was in a great location and the parking space was definitely a plus! The view on the deck was amazing. 
1950446,50530914,2015-10-12,42040208,Garrett,"The place was bright and welcoming, exactly as described.  Easy access via car.  Great view from a large balcony.  Nice quiet area.  We walked a few short blocks to find good coffee on a street a couple with small shops, markets and restaurants."
1950446,51158173,2015-10-18,691640,Olivia,"We arrived in Seattle for one night and found the house easily! (Just off the highway),  we and 4 friends stayed on the top floor of the house and we all found it very spacious and well kept for a quick overnight visit to the city. 

The neighbourhood was great, lots of great restaurants and an amazing bar (Eastlake Tavern Zoo) . Close to downtown and transit was the easiest way to get around! 

Good house for a quick trip to Seattle! "
1950446,51516982,2015-10-20,46822101,Brent,"So I needed a very last minute booking for two nights somewhere that was close to where I needed to be (for work) and had internet and a parking space. With those requirements this rental unit was perfect. Read the other reviews (as most are spot on regarding the current condition of the unit) for more detailed descriptions of the place but if you just need a place to rest your head at night it's perfect. Little to no water pressure if both units are using the sink/toilet/showers , no tv, located on a busy street (which can be noisy if windows are open), some windows are permanently open (see my last point) and it could use a good mopping (floor is a bit dirty but the rest of the place was pretty clean). Take the photos with a grain of photoshop as nothing in that place is that white. It's a cute little two story house in a great neighborhood, walking distance from not only a small market but some good places to eat. The units both come with a parking place and thanks to keyless entry you don't need to meet with Joshua for check-in/check-out.  
the tldr: If you're looking for a cheap, clean unit in a great neighborhood that you're only going to be using for sleep then this is your spot (especially if you have a car), if you're looking for a full hotel experience you should weigh your options. This might sound like an overly bad review but honestly for the price I paid it was a great choice. I would have no problems staying there again the next time i'm in town. Great view from the upstairs deck btw.
~Brent"
1950446,51924525,2015-10-25,377306,Linda,"Pros:
The apartment is spacious, the location has easy and convenient access to highway and city. The check-in was straightforward with the door codes. Nice view, good natural light, appreciated having a parking spot. Joshua was easy to contact and quickly responsive.

Cons:
Overall feeling of cleanliness was not great. Stains on bed coverings. Towels were older. Pans were very used/old. The bathroom floor in particular was grimy/dirty around all the edges. Bathroom cabinets completely full of leftover random toiletries, which we re-organized to make room for our own. Fridge also contained a few half-used items. The only radiator that seemed to work was the one in the living room - the others (bathroom and both bedrooms) stayed cold the entire stay.

In bedrooms at night, we used white noise apps on our phone to soften the murmur of the highway, and the occasional loud truck/motorcycle... and that worked fine. Other than that, the apartment was calm and quiet in the living areas."
1950446,52447512,2015-10-29,2840257,Josh,"This unit is as described reasonably accurately by Joshua and the other reviews. For me it was unpleasant because 1) the heat didn't work in the upper unit I rented. 2) The shower pressure is incredibly poor and the hardware of the shower fairly antique making good control difficult as well as the shower curtain being hung somewhat askew keeping it in touch with your body basically at all times. 3) The downstairs unit tenants disrupted my evening trying to access the upstairs unit I was renting ""just checking the house out."" 4) The road noise was pretty bad.

I reported the heat issue almost immediately and Joshua was fairly dismissive of my concern until my 2nd request for assistance when he offered to come over when convenient for him after work, and then didn't come by at all. This was an underwhelming reaction to what I feel is a very serious issue in the unit during the cold of night."
1950446,52667191,2015-10-31,851427,Walter,"This upper unit was a nice option at the last minute for us in Seattle. Just minutes from downtown and there is a cafe around the corner and down the hill a couple of blocks. It's not fancy, but it is a good option if you want to be close to the city. Security locks at main entrance and also into the unit. Parking is very tight for an Suv in the front of the home but manageable. Thanks!"
1950446,53150456,2015-11-05,19193890,Chan,"Joshua's place great, clean, nice and cozy. Location was convenient because it was near the highway and close to downtown. I enjoyed my stay here."
1950446,53426591,2015-11-08,28869823,Emily,"Joshua's place was a great space for my family and I to spend a couple days in Seattle. The apartment was warm and cozy. The beds were super comfortable and we were close enough to all the sites we wanted to see. Proximity to the highway noise was noticeable but quickly turned to white noise, which was actually quite pleasant. The parking space was used and appreciated!"
1950446,54385313,2015-11-19,3638658,Rishi,"Great location and communication. Great view from the deck. Only negative is that the shower is pretty awful. Would make a huge difference with a new shower. Otherwise, great place and will definitely stay there again inmost next visit to Seattle."
1950446,54569782,2015-11-21,48315942,Mohamed,It was a pleasure staying there very spacious and very close to most attractions and very clean. 
1950446,55088390,2015-11-27,36991044,Lawrence,Gavin made us feel very welcome. The home was beautiful and was very spacious. It was located very close to downtown which made it very easy for us to get to places that we wanted to visit. We would love to stay in it again the next time we are in Seattle. 
1950446,56161733,2015-12-09,29544455,Thomas,"Absolutely beautiful, tasteful upgrades to a classic house. Immaculate.  The host lives in a building behind the house. He basically checked us in, saw us out and left us to our own devices otherwise."
8508341,52728666,2015-11-01,45539245,David L,The host was helpful and the house was as advertised in a good neighborhood with ample street parking. Easy walk to U-Village and UW.
4782745,43258723,2015-08-18,24131469,Christina,"Karen's apartment is the perfect spot if you are travelling with your partner for a getaway in Seattle.  It is very clean, fully equipped and nicely decorated. You can tell she pays attention to detail. It is situated in the Capitol Hill area which has a lot of ambience and things to do at night. In spite of this apartment being away from any of the noise It's walking distance from really good restaurants and bars. We can honestly say that we felt like we lived there for the 3 days we stayed."
4782745,43960103,2015-08-23,15806981,Brogan,Amazing apartment and location! Karen was a fantastic host; she made check in a breeze and provided a number of great local recommendations. I would highly recommend staying here and look forward to coming back to Seattle!
6644628,35150275,2015-06-15,17406007,Carol Dalton,"Alyson's home is a great find. She was rapidly responsive and remained so throughout the visit, providing helpful information on Seattle and recommendations for food and sites. The location is actually fantastic. It is in close proximaty to the city yet you remain outside the fray, noise, and bustle.  We drove a rental car in our first night- 10 minutes (?) or so, and then on the second day used the super convenient train system within easy walking distance to the house. We particularly appreciated that the house was so clean and comfortably appointed. Highly recommended. Thank you Alyson."
6644628,35703446,2015-06-21,34750052,Bev,"This townhouse is immaculate and very comfortable - even nicer than in the pictures. Alyson was very helpful and friendly before we arrived, and was there to greet us (we arrived late Friday evening, so not a convenient time). There's not a lot of action in the immediate neighbourhood, but Beacon Hill is very close to downtown (10 minutes by car or similar time on the light rail link, and the station is just a couple of blocks away) - Capitol Hill similar distance by car or taxi."
6644628,36218629,2015-06-26,35518792,Eric,"My wife and I recently visited Seattle and stayed with Alyson.  Her place was great!  Only a few blocks from the train station, very clean, and very welcoming.  It made getting around and seeing the city very easy.  Alyson was also extremely responsive throughout the entire process, and gave us some great recommendations on places to check out.  If you are looking to visit Seattle, I highly recommend her!"
6644628,37003836,2015-07-03,36574460,ChiaYu,"Our first Airbnb experience with Alyson was nothing short of amazing! Her warm and welcoming hospitality made us feel right at home in her immaculate townhouse.

Not to mention the easy access to public transit and the always available street side parking made our trip that much more pleasant.

10/10 will recommend to any and all Seattle visitors!

Thanks again Alyson!"
6644628,38024155,2015-07-12,36537473,Jazmin,"Alyson was a great host! She was so friendly and welcoming. She gave us great tips and recommendations on what to do in the city. My friend and I did not have a car and relied on Seattle public transportation. We easily arrived her place through the link, which you can get from the airport and goes all the way to downtown. The location is only two blocks away from the link and about a 15 minute link ride to downtown. Her place was very cute and clean. I would definitely stay here again! "
6644628,39700484,2015-07-25,38934803,Neil,"Great, Great stay! We thoroughly enjoyed our time at Alyson’s place. If you’re looking for a nice place to stay in a quiet well kept neighborhood outside of Seattle’s city center, this is the place to go.  Alyson’s place has got everything you need if you’re looking to hunker down and get out of the sometimes damp Seattle weather while still being conveniently placed close enough to all the touristy hot spots. The Seattle Link rail station which was a 5 minute walk from the townhouse makes getting into downtown or the airport extremely easy. Pay heed to Alyson’s recommendations, The Tippe and Drague Alehouse was a delicious close by spot to start before hitting the Seattle night life.   "
6644628,41512579,2015-08-07,9455241,Avery,Alyson was a great host. I didn't get a chance to meet her but the place was beautiful and clean and she was very friendly throughout our phone call conversations. 
6644628,41806479,2015-08-09,26795,Rebecca,"Alyson's home was comfortable and very clean, not to mention very close to the Link Rail (3 blocks or so) that could take you to central locations in Seattle, and also all the way to the airport (I took the Link Rail from the airport to Alyson's apartment, and back to the airport, totaling $2.75 each way!)  Alyson was also a great host and very understanding of some last-minute changes to my reservation. I enjoyed my time in Seattle greatly. "
6644628,44147317,2015-08-24,7040975,Edmund,"We had the pleasure of staying with Alyson for four days and 3 nights. Not only her place is spotless, but she her self is very kind and extremely informative. Alyson is a professional so she is barely home and when she is she makes you feel right at home. We are so grateful to come across such an amazing host and hopefully a start to a good friendship. Alyson... thank you, thank you, thank you so much for your kind card and delicious pastries that was the icing on the cake. 

With love, Samineh and Ed"

Unfortunately we were not able to meet Nick, but I felt he was also kind through text :). We were also thankful that they welcomed our puppy, I will definitely recommend this place!"
6557767,35019868,2015-06-14,13677366,Leonardo,"We stayed two nights at David and Nick's house, we always felt at home, great atmosphere, beautiful decoration, everything was neat and clean, very cordial persons. The description fits as indicated in the ad. If we return to Seattle we would stay at home without hesitation.

Estuvimos dos noches en la casa de David and Nick, nos sentimos como en casa, excelente ambiente, linda decoración, todo ordenado y limpio, trato muy cordial. La descripción se adecua a lo indicado en el anuncio. Si volvemos a Seattle nos volveríamos hospedar en su casa sin dudarlo."
6557767,35282248,2015-06-16,4423542,Matt,"Only saw David and Nick for a few minutes before crashing, but they were great, taking me in on very short notice after a travel disaster in Seattle and treating me like the warm and thoughtful hosts they were. 

As for the room, the bed was comfy and the space is great, with a pool just outside in the courtyard if you have more time. Also, don't be fooled by the map: there's a no-other-stops direct bus from downtown Seattle to the transit center around the corner from their house, so their place is quicker and easier to reach by transit than most ostensibly closer options. A great choice. "
6557767,35491018,2015-06-19,9648091,Sam,"My mom and I were in Seattle for a few days and we could not have been more pleased with our stay. David and Nick go above and beyond being fantastic hosts. 

Firstly, the home itself is gorgeous. It is definitely an artists' home with all the fine details in interior decorating. The room we stayed in was so creative and clever, it took my breath away. It looks even better in person than in pictures! The location was top notch, walkable to a mall, restaurant, and public transit. My mom especially enjoyed swimming in the heated pool.

The real winners here are the hosts. David and Nick were always quick to respond and quick to accommodate. When we couldn't find a car rental, Nick helped us get to his apartment without us lugging our suitcases. They are so friendly and warm, I can't recommend them enough. 

You will enjoy your stay in Seattle a lot more if you book this place! "
6557767,35596697,2015-06-20,35125399,Helena,"Nick and David were just gorgeous. Their place is stunning and the room is a haven of happiness. We were exhausted when we arrived, so it was great to just chill out and catch up
On some rest. They went out of their way on every level to ensure we were ok. David even dropped as at the airport, a good 40 minute round trip for him. We would love to come back and spend more time with them next time in the future. I hope they come visit is in New Zealand. Highly recommend this peaceful abode in a prime location. :). Helena and Andy. "
6557767,35866646,2015-06-22,31999528,Jazib,"The apartment was in a convenient and nicd neighbourhood. I was able to find ample street parking everyday. The apartment itself had a modern artsy decor feel to it. The bedroom and bathrooms were comfortable, nice and clean and there was a iPad on the desk reserved for guests. 

I had a nice time chatting with Nick and David and they were always communicative and flexible about timings and everything. 

I had a great time in Seattle and having a comfortable sleep after hard days travels was invigorating. "
6557767,36073207,2015-06-24,22624870,Tyler,Really nice place in a nice neighborhood. Made a perfect base for my friend and I to check out Seattle on our road trip.
6557767,36752556,2015-06-30,3095955,Robert,Everything was as described. They were very welcoming. We were only there to sleep essentially but we did get to talk to them and they were cool. 
6557767,37371883,2015-07-06,21109536,Kristine,"Nick and David's place was absolutely wonderful. It was clean, well-decorated, and guest-friendly. We had our full privacy over the weekend as well. They are very welcoming, sweet, and thoughtful hosts. Some may be concerned with the location of their place but it wasn't far from the main attractions at all. $15 Uber ride from the Capitol Hill, 4 minute ride to U of W, and 15 minute ride to pike place from their location. I would definitely recommend their place to everyone. "
6557767,37787318,2015-07-10,25940614,Sarah,Nick and David are great hosts. Nick was so kind to pick us up from the ferry. Their place is so bright and comfortable. We had a lovely time in Seattle and recommend them as hosts to anyone looking to travel and have some chill time in Seattle. 
6557767,38575435,2015-07-16,38519014,Bercan,I was just passing by and I needed a place to stay for one night. David and Nick were very accommodating and made it easy for me. Everything went smoothly. It was clean and well organized. I didn't really have the chance to get to know them but I'm grateful for their hospitality. 
6557767,38653628,2015-07-17,22993770,Anja,Very clean and cute room! We stayed there for one night but would have loved to stay longer. 
6557767,38911212,2015-07-19,37484684,Sarina,Everything was accurate and so straightforward! Nick and David provided clear instructions on how to o get into their building. The room was delightful and very home-y feeling. So bright and colorful! I would definitely stay here again while in Seattle. You are close to a lot of fun things. Thanks for being such wonderful hosts!
6557767,39081682,2015-07-20,29710953,Jeremy,Great communication and courteous. Easy one night stay. A room with great character.
6557767,39461434,2015-07-23,2822013,Jessica,"Love this place! Easy to get to, super cute room, rad hosts! Couldn't ask for more :)"
6557767,40918778,2015-08-03,10045275,Susan,"Nick was very nice, picked me up from the nearby transit center when I came into Seattle around 11pm. (It's under ten minute to walk to the apartment, but I had luggage.)  Can take light rail from airport to downtown and easy same platform transfer to the 41 express bus. Lovely room, so nice to wake up with colorful cranes overhead. "
6557767,41241330,2015-08-05,5392778,Cesar,"The room was clean, quiet and inviting, the decor (w/origami cranes) warm and delightful.  Wi-fi worked well and the bed was most comfortable--though the pillows resisted any attempt at folding or smushing them up enough to create even the barest sensation of support.  

We were traveling from Portland to Seattle by train, and had to change our departure time, then had to wait out a 2-hour Amtrak delay.  We kept Nick and David informed over the 48 hours this all played out and they were gracious in accommodating changes.  

Upon arrival, Nick showed us to our room and not much else--then David appeared to kindly welcome us, provide bottles of water, and give us a tour, pointing out the courtyard swimming pool, towels, keys, etc.  Our first of two mornings there, David answered a question we had about getting from Northgate to downtown, a quick and easy trip on the 41 express bus from a stop that's only a 5-minute walk from their building.  

After that, we heard Nick and David around the apartment but didn't see them, and they expressed no further interest in how we were doing or whether we needed anything.  When it was time to go, we tapped on the closed door to their room to let them know we were leaving, and from behind the door someone said, ""Bye, guys.""  It was a brusque farewell, and did not invite a return visit.  So we won't."
6557767,41385867,2015-08-07,3521320,Laurie & Marc,Lovely home! Great energy - thanks for sharing your space with me!
6557767,41643698,2015-08-08,37791339,Amy,"OMG this place is fabulous! & I'm not just talking about the room itself which was wonderfully sweet, and colorful with paper cranes that are just delightful to wake up to. Plus you have a dragon to guard you while you sleep! But no, the whole place is great. Well kept and clean and the decor is welcoming and fun! David was a wonderful host, generous and kind (he even gave me a lift to the airport) :) I did not check out the pool even though it is heated but that area looked very nice as well. All in all, in case you can't tell...I highly recommend this airbnb! "
6557767,41791923,2015-08-09,34921601,Royce,"David and Nick created a very tranquil, welcoming, and interactive environment.  They were friendly and professional, which made our stay very comfortable.  There are also a lot of great restaurants and shops in their vicinity.   I would recommend staying with them if you are passing through Seattle! "
6557767,42327205,2015-08-12,39461258,James,"The place was exactly how it was in the pictures. Very clean, colorful, and cozy. We were only here for one night, but we really appreciated the great hospitality! "
6557767,43884239,2015-08-22,28776338,Zak,"The place is super clean and new, they prepare a notebook for tenants to write their personal experience.
We go out early and come back late on both night, even though, they are kind. They also share pizza with us!"
6557767,44086803,2015-08-23,8388746,Divya,"My fiance and I had a night to spend at Seattle before a busy work week there and we decided to stay over at this airbnb listing. All we were really looking for was a place to leave our luggage before going sightseeing and somewhere to crash at, during the night. We were pleasantly surprised by the hosts' hospitality. They agreed to check us in earlier (in contrast to normal check-in timings), requiring them to quickly jump into cleaning the room after their previous guests left. The room was the most creative one we had ever seen. The room was themed around origami so perfectly. We have certainly gained so many ideas for our new home from the stay! Not just that, the room was sparkling clean and cozy as well. On our way back from Seattle, we realized that my fiance's suit was left behind in their closet. The hosts promptly replied to our messages and met with us downstairs to hand over the suit; and my fiance made it to the flight on time! We - my fiance and I, definitely recommend staying here, for the listing and the warm hosts that David and Nick are! :)"
6557767,44397708,2015-08-25,14720545,Jane,"David and Nick made me feel welcome.  I had a very nice, comfortable bedroom and bed.  They are very friendly and nice.  It is within walking distance to the Northgate Mall with several restaurant choices.  It is also very close to I-5."
6557767,45715288,2015-09-05,42016077,Pablo,"David and Nick are a very friendly people, who take care about make you feel comfortable, like home. They helped me in my first days in Seattle. For sure, I took the best choice at staying with them!

The bedroom was great! Exactly like the photos. The condo is very pleasant, quiet neighborhood, 20-25 minutes to Seattle's downtown by bus. 2 blocks away you have supermarkets and a mall. Great place!"
6557767,47398737,2015-09-18,7712629,Cécile,"Very good flat. Nice welcoming, I really enjoyed my stay there. David and Nick are really nice and cool. The bedroom is so quiet and peaceful . Everyone who wants to discover Seattle should stay with them. "
6557767,48308596,2015-09-25,34489333,Kimberly,"David was out of town so Nick was my host for the majority of my stay.  He was wonderful!!!  Even though I was in Seattle on business and I was gone pretty much from Dawn to Dusk, Nick and I had some wonderful chats.  He was so lovely to talk to, and the house was so peaceful, clean and such a perfect place to come home to after a long day of traveling.  The bed is SUPREMELY comfortable, and I loved waking up to the rainbow of cranes every morning.  It only rained my last day here in Seattle, so I think the cranes were responsible for the sunshine!  I had the pleasure of meeting Dave on the very last night and even he (after traveling from Germany) was so cheerful and wonderful!"
6557767,48606116,2015-09-27,43576682,Zheng,"David&Nick are very nice people. The room they provided for guests is one of the most beautiful ones I've ever seen in my life. The little orientation upon check-in is very informative and sweet. The neighborhood is quite and evergreen, with a 10-minutes walking distance to Northgate Mall and the cinema. "
6557767,49302438,2015-10-02,45463623,Rebecca,"Listing was accurate and the neighborhood description accurate.  I think the guys have a good system getting people in and settled.  Everything was there: key, towel etc."
6557767,49992045,2015-10-08,9797063,Nam,Perfect room. Beautiful!
1547337,6925246,2013-08-30,8242907,Kate,"We had a wonderful stay at ""Stylish, Sunny Apartment in Capitol Hill"".  It was centrally located for busses and there were really fun businesses and eateries within walking distance.  It is a safe area for walking, even at night.  The apartment was clean and uncluttered and the bed extremely comfortable.  The only issues were the building itself is quite dank, the windows are funky and could not be easily opened or closed and the plethora of coffee-making options advertised were not there.  Kate was super nice and responsive and brought over the coffee pot when we told her we did not have one and she found us an extra blanket as well.  Overall great place to stay, pricey but location, location. location right?"
1547337,7050104,2013-09-04,3143151,Shani,"We stayed in Kate's apartment over the Labour Day weekend. The location was great - very convenient to Downtown - many options for buses and other suburbs such as Fremont, Ballard etc. Supermarkets and great F&B within 5-10min walk. The apartment is in an older building in a quiet neighborhood - the only noise was planes - Capitol Hill seems to be in the flight path for planes coming in to SeaTac.  Kate was prompt in replying to messages and left very detailed and helpful notes for meeting up, getting around etc. Wifi was great too, thanks!"
1547337,7382355,2013-09-17,6890002,Jacki,"We loved staying at Kate's place!  Her apartment is spacious and tasteful, and is in a great neighborhood.  She is also a very accommodating and gracious host and left a sweet little note for us with recommendations on nearby restaurants and shops.  It was our best trip to Seattle yet."
1547337,8520069,2013-11-04,2489451,Adrian,We had a super time here. It's a nice 1930s building and Kate has excellent taste in furniture and a well organized kitchen.
1547337,10406566,2014-02-17,2304128,Serena,Spent a nice Valentine's weekend at this lovely and bright place. The apartment itself was great and convenient.
1547337,10687479,2014-03-03,7297982,Karen,"Kate's place is so lovely! I was in town for a conference, and it was the perfect spot for me: close, even walkable, to downtown (maybe 20 minutes of brisk walking from the Washington State Conference Center), but also in a quiet residential spot with lots of good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. The apartment is large and sunny and full of simple, tasteful furniture, and Kate was incredibly helpful throughout, from before my stay to after, too. I couldn't have asked for more."
1547337,11205241,2014-03-24,8762909,Alexandra,"I needed a place to host my parents for a night when they decided last minute to visit me in Seattle. My studio is too small to host two people, so I looked to Kate to host them for a night in our neighborhood. I was able to see her place when I dropped them off with the key, and it was adorable. Just the right amount of space, a nice bedroom, and gorgeous light in all of the windows. The location worked well for us since we are local, but even if they were first timers in Seattle this would have been great, just two blocks from bustling 15th street. Kate was easily reachable and accommodating, and I would recommend her place to anyone!"
1547337,12039797,2014-04-21,9711945,Ryan,Kate and her apartment are great. Excellent location. Clean. Thoughtfully decorated. A very positive experience. Everything in her apartment was very clean. She was very friendly. 5 stars to Kate and her capital hill apartment!
1547337,12302681,2014-04-28,2760944,Cameron,"Kate's place was perfect! Cute vibe, super clean, and plenty of room for 2 people. It was in the middle of everything (or just a short walk to everything), but also on a quiet street in a pretty neighborhood. It was the perfect retreat after a long day running around Seattle. We hope we can stay here again on our next visit! And thanks, Kate! You were a fantastic host! "
1547337,13457877,2014-05-27,7720833,Kai,"Kate was reliable and her place was clean.  Unfortunately, the main photograph is not up-to-date (as of May 2014).  There is now a construction site outside the living room window, with a new building maybe 10 feet away, blocking any view the place may have had before.  Also, there was construction noise even on Sunday and Memorial day mornings.  The place was less peaceful than hoped for. "
1547337,14670293,2014-06-23,16994875,Michelle,"Kate's place was very nice - bright, sunny, cute plants (no TV).  There are some shops, bars, and restaurants 6 or so blocks away, and a little farther is the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Kate was easy to work with, gave me restaurant recommendations, and left a Seattle guidebook for me.  There was construction going on at the building next door and I heard one of the neighbors ask them not to start so early in the morning on the weekends.  Once that work is complete, I'm sure it will be a peaceful retreat.  "
1547337,17534682,2014-08-13,19336375,Debbi,"Kate responded very quickly to all questions and provided us all we needed to know.  We were easily able to pick up the key and she messaged us right away when we got there.  She also left us a little note, which provided a more personal touch. "
1547337,17717821,2014-08-16,579582,Scott,Kate's apartment is described accurately. My wife and I stayed there for two nights. It was very nice and clean. The neighborhood is nice and very walkable. We had a car. It was easy finding free street parking during the night. We'd be out in the car during the day.
1547337,18955213,2014-09-03,19681860,Patrick,"Kate was super helpful and accommodating and made it very simple to get the keys to her awesome apartment. The apartment itself was very clean and airy. Building was safe and secure and the neighborhood was pleasant. The location we found to be very central, we were able to easily walk to great bars and restaurants and when we wanted to go further it was easy to drive or cab to and from.  All in all our weekend getaway to Seattle turned out great and Kate's apartment was the perfect retreat in between activities.  "
1547337,19301613,2014-09-09,1583923,Matt,"My boyfriend and I spent a long weekend at Kate's apartment, and we can't say enough great things about it! The space is huge yet comfortable, and we felt at home there. The building and neighbors are great, and it's close to Pine/Pike, Cap Hill, and buses that take you downtown in 15 minutes. And Kate was so easy to work with - she met us at her place, gave us great tips on things to do in Seattle, and was quick to answer any questions we had during our stay. Thanks again for hosting, and let us return the favor sometime!"
1547337,19640379,2014-09-15,1470468,Jeremy,"Kate's place was perfect.  Convenient location in Capitol Hill and near lots of public transportation (though lots of stuff is walkable and you don't really need it for the most part if you're going out in Capitol Hill or downtown).

Her place was perfect for us, as well.  Kate keeps her place super-tidy and it was a pleasure to come back and crash after a long day out (the block is really quiet).  Also, the sunlight in her place is amazing.

Kate was also super-responsive throughout the booking process and even dropped off the key at my hotel the day before my reservation.  

Highly recommended! 

"
1547337,19984527,2014-09-21,7139321,Lindley,Kate's apartment was absolutely perfect for our trip. Everything we wanted to do or see we were able to walk to. If some places were a little further out we just hopped on a short cab ride. The apartment itself was clean and had all the necessities needed for a great stay. I would recommend this place for anyone looking for Seattle getaway. 
1547337,21322421,2014-10-14,1200752,Heather,"Kate is a great host — very friendly and accommodating. The apartment itself is beautiful and very well located; I'd highly recommend it. There are some great bars and restaurants a short walk away, as well. We had a fabulous stay, with only one little snag: there seemed to be something wrong with the hot water in the bathroom sink (there wasn't any), but I'm sure that'll be fixed right away. Thanks for a lovely weekend in Seattle!"
1547337,24508976,2014-12-29,5284620,Tina,"Kate was a friendly, accommodating host that made it so easy to check in and out of her place. Her apartment was centrally located, and was a short distance from everywhere I wanted to be. I appreciated how clean the apartment was as well, and it had everything we needed for our stay. I would definitely stay at Kate's apartment again! "
1547337,25893110,2015-01-28,26568849,Kristen,"This was our very first Airbnb stay and it was even better then we had expected! Kate was an amazing host and so very helpful in recommending places to see and experience around Seattle. We only had about 36hrs and really had to make the most of it so her suggestions came in handy! Her apartment is centrally located and very walkable. We walked all around Capitol Hill and even down town to the market with total ease. There are a ton of restaurants and bars within a few blocks and we stayed out pretty late (2am) and walked home feeling totally safe. Her place was also super cozy and if we had more time, I would have probably stayed in for a night to prepare a meal in her adorable kitchen :) All in all we had an amazing stay and I would recommend Kate's place to anyone looking to experience Seattle for the first time!"
1547337,26322730,2015-02-09,9020551,Jeremy,Kate's place was awesome she's great at communicating as well.  The area is great and walking distance to everything.
1547337,26718768,2015-02-17,1532603,Drew,"We stayed at Kate's place for a weekend while in Seattle visiting relatives. The apartment was lovely, quiet, and very bright as described, as well as being a short walk from all the cool Capital Hill spots, which was perfect for us. It's also a short ride from downtown.
Kate was very communicative and flexible, and was super helpful with checkout when we missed our early flight home. Highly recommend staying at Kate's place!"
1547337,27071974,2015-02-24,27618512,Quinn,I felt welcome and taken care of by Kate. Everything was as described.
1547337,27411708,2015-03-03,1982707,Zebadiah,Kate's apartment is great and looks just like it does in her pictures.  Very clean and all the amenities - there's even a washer/dryer in the basement that she didn't mention.  The area is very nice and it's an easy walk to lots of cool stores and restaurants.  A+
1547337,28443232,2015-03-23,4868809,Janet,Kate was prompt with all communication from start to finish. The apartment was pristinely clean and just as shown. The bed was super comfortable and cozy. Neighborhood was quiet and safe.
1547337,33128042,2015-05-25,10489519,Jennifer,"Great! apartment! Excellent location, super nice host. Trader joes right down street. Really good restaurants and shops, pubs all around neighborhood. I'll def. come back! "
1547337,35092105,2015-06-15,3209477,Kevin,"Kate was a great host, very responsive, gave great restaurant recommendations and was very accommodating when I got notice that my departing flight was going to leave later than originally scheduled. The apartment--while in an older building--is very cute, generally well-maintained, and everything was in working order. The neighborhood is quiet (tho coming from NYC it was almost too quiet!) It was a bit of a hike from downtown, where I spent most of my time, but it seems like there is a great public transportation system (and Uber) if you aren't up for the uphill walk home. "
1547337,37677522,2015-07-09,14169148,Jenna,"My boyfriend and I rented this space for his parents while they were visiting and I must say it was wonderful. Kate was so accommodating and her apartment is amazing. It's in a great location on Capitol Hill and walking distance to restaurants, shopping, and most bus lines. I would definitely recommend staying here:)"
1547337,39064290,2015-07-20,15499448,Nathan,Kate was really responsive and considerate throughout the whole experience. Her place was just as advertised and we had a great stay.

1547337,41666673,2015-08-08,30740948,Joel,"I really enjoyed staying at Kate's apartment. It was clean, cosy, and convenient. I had a couple questions and requests that Kate was able to help me with quickly. I would definitely stay there again!"
1547337,42436813,2015-08-13,206276,Jason,"Kate's place was perfect: clean, cozy, centrally located, and sunny. It was exactly the right place for my three-day trip to Seattle. Kate communicated promptly and clearly, and was gracious and hospitable. Highly recommended! "
1547337,43142436,2015-08-17,40436431,Constance,"Charming clean apt with everything you need to relax from a busy day in Seattle.
We shopped at Trader Joes around the corner   Walked to several restaurants for lunch and dinner in the Capitol Hill area .
Mastered the bus routes in no time to go into the city –parked the car and only used it to go outside Seattle. 
All and all a perfect experience.
"
1547337,44382118,2015-08-25,41541273,Karin,"Kate had many great recommendations and was very welcoming.  Her apartment was spacious, well decorated, and in an ideal location!"

I found Kate's place in Capitol Hill at about 1 pm, just 6 blocks from my son's new place. I email Kate, since Airbnb said it was available for the 2 days I requested. Kate got right back to me, but said she had another guest coming in on the morning I was to leave and she had to work that day. We quickly arranged an agreeable solution and I was able to move in early that evening. Kate met me at the apartment and everything was exactly as advertised.  Great neighborhood, sunny quiet apartment, on the block with Trader Joes, and a wonderful walk to Volunteer Park, the Asian Art Museum and the Conservatory.  Also very walkable to Pike and Pine Street and to downtown. Lovely, quiet, sunny, clean, homey space that I would love to come back to in the future. Great to also have an expresso machine and a fully equiped kitchen!"
1547337,46198774,2015-09-08,8821699,Nifer,We had a wonderful stay at Kate's apartment.  She was always quick to respond with any questions we had.  The apartment is in a great location and we loved the décor.  
1547337,46547262,2015-09-11,253057,Jim,"It's a lovely charming home in an amazing part of Seattle, easy walking distance to great restaurants and gorgeous panoramic views of the city. Highly recommend. "
1547337,48042870,2015-09-22,14805163,Deana,"Kate responded very quickly to my request and communication/organization before arrival was great. Kate was out of town and emailed great instructions and was always reachable and helpful via text. Her flat has everything you need and is in a very nice and quiet neighborhood just around the corner from all the cool bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. We returned our rental car in Seattle after travelling up the Coast and if you don't mind walking, you can easily walk into Downtown/Pioneer Square/Space Needle etc. Also, there are buses running nearby the flat. We had a great stay!"
1547337,48934710,2015-09-29,44104027,Karry,Cute cosy clean flat in a lovely neighbourhood. Great location. Kate was very helpful with all the organising too. 
1547337,49856427,2015-10-06,7729540,Laura,"Kate's home was perfect for a long weekend getaway! It is in a great location in Capitol Hill within walking distance of lots of great restaurants, coffee chips and bars. Even though she wasn't there, she was super helpful anytime we needed recommendations and very quick to respond. Would highly suggest staying here!"
1547337,50341406,2015-10-11,7703139,Monica,"The host was very quick to return emails.  The description of the property was very accurate.  The directions and access to the apartment were very clear.  It was a great location, relatively quiet, but a walkable neighborhood.  The bed was very comfortable!  The host, left a Seattle Guide book and the Internet access codes.  We would definitely stay there, again!"
1547337,51194531,2015-10-18,36997767,Nicole,"Very happy with this listing. Kate was an attentive and accommodating host. The location is great. Just a few blocks from direct downtown bus lines, Broadway (the heart of Capitol Hill), and great places to eat. The apartment is clean and cute. Comfortable bed and couch. Fully equipped kitchen. It's an older unit so it can be a bit chilly. Overall, I would highly recommend this place as a quiet reprieve in the middle of Seattle's vibrant hustle and bustle."
1547337,51575660,2015-10-21,46107449,Emma,Kate was lovely and her apartment is gorgeous.  She was very kind and flexible when our plans changes.  Highly recommended!!!
1547337,52102011,2015-10-26,5708122,Paul,"This was a great location for us, since we were visiting our son on Capitol Hill. It was a short walk to interesting shops on 15th Street and the apartment was clean and comfortable. Kate left a guidebook to Seattle out and that was very helpful. 
Thanks Kate"
1547337,53021086,2015-11-03,5042670,Cole,"We had a lovely stay at Kate's cozy apartment. She was incredibly responsive and provided a heap of helpful recommendations for the area. Great location, great space. Thanks, Kate!"
1547337,53509327,2015-11-09,16016279,Elan,"Kate was very accommodating with getting the key to us, as well as offering advice for how to get around and where to go! The place was very nicely decorated and we had a great weekend staying there. Would definitely recommend and stay again ! "
1547337,53710515,2015-11-11,29449906,Laura,Kate's home was perfect for my stay in Seattle this past weekend. She was very clear and communicative as a host and made everything very easy. I'd recommend Kate's apartment to anyone looking for a peacefully place to stay. 
1547337,54135847,2015-11-16,46793799,Clarissa,"We loved our stay at Kate's place. She was so helpful, and gave us a wealth of information on the best coffee shops and eateries within walking distance. She was hospitable and we felt at home instantly. The neighborhood was quiet and cozy, but it was also just a mile walk from Pike Place Market and downtown. You really get the best of both worlds— a cozy quaint experience, like you're a local, and within a mile you're exploring the heart of Seattle. Would definitely recommend her place in a heartbeat. "
1547337,54481195,2015-11-20,22441499,Christina,Kate was an incredibly gracious host! The apartment was welcoming and in a perfect location. Highly recommended. 
1547337,54657544,2015-11-22,10130866,Vanessa,"Kate's apartment was really lovely! Great location and super cosy! Kate was really supportive and gave us a lot of great tips for bars, restaurants...
Everything was perfect, we definitely wanna come back!"
1547337,54894197,2015-11-25,46954378,Christie,"Kate was very nice and easy to get in touch with. I initially told her an incorrect flight arrival time (got my time zones mixed up) and she was quick to respond about how we could possibly rearrange some things. Throughout our stay, she checked in (via Airbnb) to make sure everything was going smoothly and recommended a few places to eat and drink. The place was clean. Natural lightning. Enough space for my boyfriend and I to move about. Overall I was very pleased!"
1547337,55431023,2015-12-01,47294462,David,Nice goodies in fridge and good communication before my stay.  All in all a fine stay.
1547337,56604950,2015-12-15,2624225,Inkar,"Wonderful stay at Kate's place, plenty of space for 2 people and loved the fresh plants everywhere. Easy to get around the city from her location and grocery stores close by as well. "
1547337,56826591,2015-12-18,11144940,Rachel,"Kate's place was charming and welcoming, just as the photos appear. It was within walking distance to a TON of cute shops, cafes, bars, and co-op/trader joes. I would most definitely stay there again! "
1547337,57026058,2015-12-21,7703139,Monica,"The apartment was great for us, we've stayed there before...and we hope to stay there again!  The descriptions of the property are accurate, the location is convenient and very safe and the bed is super-comfortable!!!  The host is very quick with responses to questions and great with follow-up to make sure everything is going well.  Really enjoyed it!

7840228,43005663,2015-08-16,18837521,Matt,"Morgan was an awesome host. While there were a few quirks that came up, the place was great. Look forward to coming back. Thx!"
7840228,44987903,2015-08-30,41221423,Paul,"Great location and view and a beautiful apartment. Morgan was very helpful with pointing us to some good local fare, and checking in and out was a breeze."
7840228,45622410,2015-09-04,1411013,Corey,"Morgan & Michael were great hosts—responsive and accommodating. We were let in on time and it was nice of them to followup during our stay to ensure we were enjoying our time.

The apartment was a great place to call a home for the week we were there. It's located in a great spot, a short walk away from lots of great restaurants, bars and sights. The building is clean and modern. We made use of the gym which was also great.

We hope to come back again soon."
7840228,45784580,2015-09-06,10442862,Tom,Our stay with Michael was everything and more! Michael was always reachable and able to accommodate our late check out needs. It was a beautiful apartment that made truly made us feel like we were at home.
7840228,47186836,2015-09-16,16067899,Jeff,"Every part of our stay was perfect. The unit is beautiful, bright, and clean. We really enjoyed having access to the 4th-floor patio and grill. A fresh-caught king salmon from Pike Place thrown on the grill with some lemon and dill was divine. I also used the games room to watch a little football. Location is excellent, surrounded by lots of restaurants and right next to a Whole Foods for groceries. When we wanted to head down to the market, we either caught an Uber for less than $5 or took on the 15-minute walk depending on our mood and the weather. The Space Needle and EMP Museum are also an easy walk away. All this for the same price as a basic hotel room. Highly recommend. The only note I would add is that the bedroom area is semi-private, with a partial wall separating it from the kitchen and small living room, but open to the front door. It wasn't a problem at all, but from the pictures I thought it was a 1-bedroom as opposed to a studio."
7840228,47763144,2015-09-21,759635,Jessie,"This place is exactly like the pictures! Clean, beautiful and comfortable. Daniela checked in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. The part of town was really nice and the close proximity to the grocery store was amazing. Can't wait to stay again!"
7089415,37416559,2015-07-06,19124998,Ashley,"Dani was very welcoming and had great recommendations for spots to  check out in the area, as well as being very communicative and available to answer our questions. Her home was true to the photos and description, a very comfortable place to stay with all the essentials. Additionally, the neighborhood cannot be beat! "
7089415,48795292,2015-09-28,8056418,New,"Dani was great host and the apartment was exactly how it appeared on Airbnb  - super cute, clean, great location.  I wasn't rushed to get out on Sunday, which was really nice.  I would definitely stay there again.  "
7089415,58415490,2016-01-02,3852463,Brandon,"We loved staying in Dani's place. It was convenient to everything in Ballard, including Old Ballard where we spent New Year's."
2026794,9904053,2014-01-18,11045480,John,"Sheryl was an awesome host! Extremely knowledgeable of the city and will accommodate any reasonable request you have. The house is a ""working progress"" but you get your own room with a big bed. If you're looking for an extravagant place then this house is not for you. Very good for budget travelers! "
2026794,10126691,2014-02-01,6925050,Eduardo,"Sheryl was a great host, once I got to the house she was very warm and welcoming making me feel right at home. The house might be a work in progress but the bedroom is perfection, cozy, with a great bed and a lot of character. But the highlight of my trip was walking with Sheryl around her neighborhood and experiencing true local Seattle life and community."
2026794,10259997,2014-02-10,10451318,Katie,"I stayed with Sheryl while attending a conference in downtown Seattle. She was a wonderfully welcoming and accommodating hostess! Quick to help answer questions about transportation and also had great suggestions of fun things to do in the city. The house is definitely a work in progress, but my room was very cozy and Sheryl's warm personality made for a great experience."
2026794,10618775,2014-02-28,1269022,Robert,"Sheryl is a gracious host. The house is cozy and comfortable in a rustic way. It is under construction, but the rooms, kitchen and bath are navigable and accessible. The bed was very comfortable for a week's stay. No complaints."
2026794,10666016,2014-03-02,7988700,Rebecca,"Room was sweet and cozy. Sheryl was friendly and helpful. It's also a great neighborhood, with lots of good food and a nice yoga studio."
2026794,10840096,2014-03-10,2632169,Alicia,"Sheryl was super friendly and hospitable. The room was clean, quiet and comfy which is basically what I needed.   Great neighborhood too!"
2026794,11056891,2014-03-18,12539211,Elisa,"A great choice for the budget-conscious traveler.  Host Sheryl is resourcefully and lovingly renovating this charming historic home.  While the house is “a work in progress,” Sheryl makes the fully outfitted kitchen entirely accessible for cooking (there’s a great QFC market just a few blocks away with fresh local meat, produce, and dairy), and has sourced great finds for the comfy bath.  The cozy smaller bedroom has a very nice, firm mattress, and the larger bed room has a lovely view of the city.  Wallingford is a great family oriented neighborhood to kick around it (Gas Works Park, Fuel coffee shop, Chocolati chocolateria, Assistance League thrift shop, Sutra yoga studio…), and uber-hip Fremont is a nice walk or short transit ride away."
2026794,11297322,2014-03-29,10935392,Jenny & Mark,"As lots of folks have said, the house is a work in progress but quirky and interesting and obviously a labour of love for Sheryl.  Visitors shouldn't be put off by this though as all the essential bits are in place and fully working with an immaculate kitchen, hot shower and comfy bed.

Neighbourhood is quiet and easy-going with grocery, bars, restaurants and buses all nearby.  Sheryl is equally easy going and even stocks good quality tea for the English traveller!!

Thoroughly enjoyed our stay in a 100(+) year old house. "
2026794,11357059,2014-03-31,7220187,Virginia,"This lovely home is under renovation, as Sheryl is quick to point out during the reservation process, but despite that, her house is clean and comfortable.  Sheryl has fun with color and her house reflects her creativity.  We were there to spend time with my daughter, so left early each morning and returned late each evening, so with that in mind, Sheryl gave us our space, which we appreciated. We felt comfortable coming and going.  We had a wonderful time in Seattle and enjoyed returning to our cozy room at the end of a full day where we slept well and comfortably. The view from the guest room is beautiful as it looks down into the neighbor's lovely garden. Sheryl's bathroom is clean and well-appointed, as is the kitchen.  She has maps and information about the city set out for her guests and she's ready to point out good local restaurants and the perks of her neighborhood, beautiful with houses built circa 1900 and lovely gardens.  This is an absolutely wonderful corner of Seattle with great restaurants, coffee shops, a local movie theater, and lots of interesting shops.  It's a good place for walking. We didn't really get to talk much until our last morning there when we brought back some delicious breakfast burritos from a great local taqueria (TNT Taqueria), and I am glad we finally had a chance to have a good chat. We will definitely stay here again when we next visit Seattle.  Thank you for making us feel at home."
2026794,11544719,2014-04-07,32889,Kathy,"I enjoyed my stay with Sheryl when vising my son at University of Washington.  The house is charming and has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The neighborhood is perfect - easy access to shopping, cafes and even a movie theater.  It was a 5 minute drive to campus and I could have taken a bus.  Sheryl is a warm and hospitable host.  "
2026794,11944566,2014-04-19,14137344,Oscar,A great place to stay and hang out.  Amazingly clean inside. The unfinished construction gave a unique character.  Sheryl was fun to talk to and always accommodating.
2026794,12717568,2014-05-09,13460620,Katie,"I must say, the house was not at all what I expected. It is under serious renovation and not quite what I imagined from the pictures. That being said, the room provided is perfectly comfortable and private, and the location of the house is ideal. Additionally, Sheryl was extremely welcoming and friendly."
2026794,12951322,2014-05-15,6429332,Ian,"Sheryl is a nice lady and has done a great job restoring this vintage cottage. My room was small but didn't feel cramped thanks to high ceilings and two windows letting in plenty of light. There was some mild shaking that happened when someone used the stairs and washer. The free wifi worked great. The Wallingford area is wonderful  I loved walking through the neighborhood - beautiful houses and lush gardens in every direction. An amazing selection of restaurants, movie theaters, coffee/teahouses, and bars is just two blocks away. I had a fun, relaxing stay. "
2026794,12980666,2014-05-16,6645268,Robert,"Sheryl was very warm and welcoming.  The location is great and I was especially pleased at how clean my room and the bathroom was, despite the home being under construction ( one of those charming, long-term projects)."
2026794,13017894,2014-05-17,14323640,Bob And Carol,Sheryl was very friendly and loves her neighborhood.  Restaurants are within walking distance.
2026794,13147023,2014-05-20,12123168,Ian,"Rooms are clean and cozy, the towels are tagged just for you, the blankets are toasty and the cat is a great prince, as he should be. This house is an obvious labor of love, and I'd hope everyone staying there could appreciate that.

Though my stay was very brief and I did not get to see much of the neighbourhood or make use of the many tips Sheryl provided (so much wasted potential - maybe I'll just have to come back), I really did appreciate the explanations about everything around the house and the occasional checking in with me.

The experience couldn't have been more comfortable, just one of the ways in which Seattle treated me well on my trip. Thanks Sheryl!"
2026794,13206420,2014-05-22,3627569,David,"I liked it!  Sheryl bought the old cottage some years ago and is upgading it completely on her own. So, you should not expect to sleep in a boutique hotel, the setting is a bit rustic, but the interior is tasteful and everything was very clean! The rooms are small, but, I mean, what do you need apart from a bed and table? The bed was very comfortable. Sheryl gave me a warm welcome in the states and was happy to tell me about the neighborhood. The neighborhood is a quite and peacefull neighborhood not to far out, close to the university and the lively district of freemont. 

Alltogether, a good place to stay if you are in Seattle for one or a few nights! Thanks to Sheryl for hosting me!"
2026794,13403470,2014-05-27,3929249,Keith,"Our stay at Sheryl's place was thoroughly delightful, from the wonderful central but quiet location in funky Wallingford to the historic house to Sheryl's friendly and generous personality. At the end of our three days here we just wanted to move in! Highly recommended if you want a central but quiet location from which to explore Seattle's north-side neighborhoods."
2026794,13667044,2014-06-02,9212728,Roger,"I had a great stay in Wallingford at Sheryl's cottage.  The room was quiet and the bed was very comfortable.  Sheryl is a great host and helped make my stay very pleasant.  I would like to stay there again on my next Seattle visit.
"
2026794,14268817,2014-06-16,13234796,Megan,"I enjoyed my stay at Sheryl's place.  It was low key and very convenient to be able to use the kitchen and even have a separate guest fridge! As the other reviews offer, the bed is super comfy.  I slept with windows open and had the best nights of sleep I've had in months!  

A couple of things to note: There is another room being rented here, so there may be multiple guests.  There is just one bathroom, so sharing and sometimes waiting for the bathroom is part of the experience. "
2026794,14468961,2014-06-20,4051822,Phil,"PROS: (1) Sheryl is a ""keeper"": delightful and generous and helpful. (2) The house, despite ongoing and all-pervasive construction, is immaculate and everything that's supposed to work works. (3) The location is fantastic: quiet, fine residential neighborhood 3 blocks off a main street where you can find every urban amenity from a movie theatre, to bars, restaurants, large drugstore and grocery store, quirky boutiques, wonderful tea house and more. A frequent east-west cross-town bus connects you to additional interesting neighborhoods and, with an easy transfer, to downtown and parts beyond. (4) The bed was ample and very comfortable.
CONS: (1) Despite Sheryl's effort to accurately describe the state of the house, it's incompleteness comes as a surprise. There is not a room in the house that is finished. The stairs leading to the second floor are bare plywood. The front yard is filled with stuff that ought to be hauled to the dump. It does not make a favorable impression. (2) The room I stayed in was, I thought, rather cramped. (3) Proximity to other guests in the adjacent bedroom is closer than I would prefer although I never heard any noise or conversation from the room. (4) The bedroom doors ought to have locks on them since many of us travel with valuable personal items including extra cash and passports. I mentioned this to Sheryl and she agreed so I suspect that soon there will be greater security."
2026794,14766428,2014-06-25,17131537,Tyler,"Staying with Sheryl was a wonderful experience! She gave us a warm welcome upon arriving in Seattle from a 13-hour drive with fresh berries and a cozy room, ready to occupy. I'd go back!"
2026794,14924062,2014-06-29,16357015,John,"We had a great experience.  It was our first time using Airbnb and I think that this is the way I'll go from now on whenever possible.  The neighborhood was beautiful, our host was personable, very friendly and accommodating.  We had a small but darling room with a window overlooking greenery.  We remodeled our mid 18 hundreds home so we had an appreciation for the remodeling process.  I felt at home in the quaint atmosphere of Sheryl's house. "
2026794,15135097,2014-07-03,3834273,Catherine Et Nicolas,"Sheryl was very friendly, kind and welcoming. The house is really nice, the room is cute. The garden is really enjoyable. The nieighboordhood is charming and quiet.
We highly recommend to stay at sheryl and joey( the sheryl's cat )place. We feel very great. 
Thanks cheryl and see you 

Nico et Kat."
2026794,15329502,2014-07-07,8918433,Kendra,Sheryl was very welcoming and super friendly.  The room was very cozy and I liked Joey the cat!
2026794,15904784,2014-07-18,6586581,Derek,"I had a great time staying with Sheryl for a week and a half. She has had plenty of experiences and it makes for some good stories and conversation. 

For the house, it's being remodeled, but I didn't have any issues. The bed was comfy, and I slept fine. Having a guest fridge was nice, too. 

The neighborhood is great to take a stroll around in, and it's easy to get to downtown and the airport via public transit. 45th street is just a little north of the place, with easy access to cafes, restaurants, grocery stores, and two gelato/ice cream parlors (both purveyors of fine products).

Definitely a good deal for the price, and it was fun living with Sheryl:  I'd stay here again

"
2026794,16218451,2014-07-23,17379141,Brian,"Our host Sheryl was very welcoming and provided everything we needed. (Plus a couple of small things we forgot to pack.) The room is just as shown in the listing, and the neighborhood is calm, quiet, pedestrian friendly, and close to several bus lines. Sheryl asked about our interests in Seattle, then researched those things and provided us with lots of information and options that allowed us to maximize our time in Seattle. In particular, she discovered a couple of promotional events surrounding the soccer game we came to see, so we got to participate in two events that we didn't know about. That worked out superbly! She also provided great public transportation info, along with advice on how to use the buses efficiently. And she found us some very nice money-saving deals on tourist activities. The house was built a long time ago, and it has various long-term renovation projects underway. As shown in the photo, there is a tall stairway to the front door and there are two turns in the stairs to the bedrooms. For this reason, Sheryl's rooms are not ideal for someone who is elderly or has physical disabilities. Our visit couldn't have been much better, and we really appreciated having our room for such a reasonable price in such a convenient location. We definitely recommend Sheryl's cozy cottage!"
2026794,16282941,2014-07-24,1401006,Randal,"Sheryl was very welcoming.  Her house is in a really nice neighborhood just north of downtown where you can easily find buses into town and the waterfront or explore the local neighborhood which has live music, bars, restaurants, movie theaters and grocery stores.  It is easily accessed from bus lines just a couple blocks away.  Her house is clean and really cool.  She's a fun host and is very accommodating.  "
2026794,16384892,2014-07-26,18579726,Ivan,"We had a great time at the house. It was a cold weekend but the fans etc. kept things nice and warm. The room where we stayed was clean and really cozy(romantic). Nice location for walk and using the bus too! Thanks Sheryl and the cat Joey:-) 
"
2026794,16457774,2014-07-28,1523350,Jason,"We had a great stay with Sheryl in her bohemian 1905 cottage. Yes, the house is being remodeled but it was clean and fun to see it taking shape. She took care to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The location is a perfect starting point to explore Wallingford and nearby Fremont. We would stay here again on our next visit to Seattle."
2026794,16562890,2014-07-29,16728765,Anjelica,"If you are looking for a place to rest your head and get some nice quiet sleep, this place is just fine.  If you are high maintenance or have any disabilities this probably isn't the place for you.  As Sheryl mentioned, her home is unfinished and although it is described as needing some final touches, there is still a lot of work to be done.  Everything that needs to function functions and for the short one night stay my mom and I had with Sheryl, that was all we needed.  Also, please notice that Sheryl is hosting two rooms in her home so you may get acquainted with other guests. The location of Sheryl's place was lovely.  The neighborhood was beautiful and not too far from the city.  There is a plethora of choices for places to eat very close to her house as well and a beautiful spot to lookout and see a beautiful view of the city ( she made a point to tell us to visit this spot).  Sheryl was a wonderful host with some spunk and a unique sense of humor.  She was very knowledgeable about places to go and see and spots to eat and get a good cup of coffee.  My mom and I enjoyed our short stay and had a nice conversation with Sheryl.  She is a funny gal and it was a pleasure getting to know her.  "
2026794,17499489,2014-08-13,14676907,Thomas,"Sheryl was a warm, helpful, and welcoming host. I stayed at her house for two weeks. She helped with places to go, bus schedules, and accurate directions. She was very understanding of my schedule which included 4 days in the mountains and went above and beyond to help me clean up my gear later. Sheryl is very engaging and we had numerous great talks about Seattle and many other subjects. I would definitely visit her house again if I return to Seattle and it is available."
2026794,17555047,2014-08-14,6650791,Lynn Jennifer,"Sheryl is very open minded, friendly, easy going and anttentive. I had a good stay in her lovley house which is still under construction, but there is a very nice bathroom and the bed was comfy. The neighbourhood is pretty and safe."
2026794,17724470,2014-08-16,6926106,Jule,We had a lovely time at Sheryl's cozy cottage in Seattle.  She did everything possible to help us feel at home. Her place is charming and very unique.  Everything was comfortable and clean. We slept well and would definitely return next time we planned to stay in Seattle.
2026794,18163453,2014-08-23,13967830,Sheila,"This was the perfect place for me to stay while visiting my daughter that lives in the same precious neighborhood.  The hostess made me feel welcome and comfortable in her home.  It was clean, safe and in a convenient location that provides most any need to be met within walking distance.   I loved the ambience of the house and quality of work the owner is doing to remodel and maintain the integrity of this period house. She is a talented lady.   I can't wait to go back to visit my daughter and stay at this same place.  "
2026794,18936318,2014-09-03,1363417,Melissa,"Staying at Sheryl's place in Wallingford was great!
The neighborhood is charming and interesting, like Sheryl the hostess. 
Lots of great food and easy access to downtown etc.
The room was small but perfect for any couple. Would recommend!"
2026794,19320325,2014-09-10,18357422,Vikki Dee,Cheryl was sweet and offered excellent local advice of what to do and where to go to enjoy Seattle. 
2026794,19430850,2014-09-12,20331296,Mark,"Sheryl was a perfect host. Incredibly warm and helpful, the moment we reached the house Sheryl instantly made us feel like we were coming back home. She went above and beyond to make sure we knew all of the local flavors and how to get from place to place starting even before we met her in person. Her lovely cottage oozed personality and was a very comfortable, clean place to stay. Sheryl and her cat Joey provided us with plenty of laughs during our time there. We didn't stay very long at all but Sheryl made sure it felt like home. We were just looking for a place to stay but it quickly became one of the best parts of our trip, I couldn't imagine a better first Airbnb experience for us and we will definitely try to stay here again our next visit!"
2026794,19578404,2014-09-14,10030600,Kia,"Sheryl was very accommodating and worked around my schedule to meet me on the day I arrived. Her property is cozy and welcoming, as advertised. The Wallingford neighborhood is a great spot and her home is convenient to everything you could want for a great weekend in Seattle!"
2026794,19804347,2014-09-18,21023174,Kaz,"Sheryl's place was quiet and cozy--the perfect place to stay after a camping trip in the Cascades. She's right that the home is currently a ""work in progress"" (the remodel is quite evident in the common areas of the home) but the two guest rooms were brightly lit, comfortable, and clean. Her home is mere blocks from the waterfront and some of the best restaurants in Wallingford. We walked everywhere. If you have a car, it's close to the freeway and if you're using public transit, it's one 20-minute bus ride to downtown. Sheryl herself was great: warm and affable. She gave us plenty of useful recommendations on the neighborhood (try the vegetarian Thai place), offered us fresh fruit from her lovely garden, and even walked with us to the bus stop when we departed. Once the remodel is complete, this place will be the pride of Wallingford."
2026794,19865681,2014-09-20,13896249,Makayla,I very much enjoyed my 3-day stay. I was in town for class a UW so the location was great and Sheryl made me feel very welcome. Great experience!
2026794,20432210,2014-09-29,6792374,Diana,"Sheryl was there for our arrival, which was hours later than we expected, due to car problems en route.  She welcomed us, showed us around and made us feel at home.  The room was tiny, as expected, and the bed comfortable.  Loved the neighborhood - everything was within walking distance, and the bus stop into Seattle not far away.  Enjoyed our stay."
2026794,22263598,2014-11-02,95836,Gaby,Sheryl is a great host! She met with me on Halloween evening and showed me around her charming home while also doing hard work and handing out treats to neighborhood children. She is a great conversationalist and her warmth is present in every interaction. I will definitely stay here again! One of the best airbnb experiences I have had!
2026794,22408594,2014-11-05,18742914,Brendan,"Sheryl was wonderful.  If you are going to Seattle, she lives in a very walkable neighborhood with TONS of fun stuff to do.  She provided easy public transport directions to her house that is easy to navigate and costs approximately $5.00.  If this listing is available for your trip, you should not pass on it."
2026794,22651891,2014-11-11,8007825,Kellie,"We were welcomed with a warm smile and a lovely cup of tea.

Sheryl's house is warm and comfortable with everything you need for a enjoyable few days in Seattle. "
2026794,22766274,2014-11-14,15442093,Carole,"Sheryl was a great host and ready to meet all of my needs. The house is cozy and a work in progress. It was nice to share the home with her. She is upbeat, energetic and fun to be around. "
2026794,23440598,2014-12-01,16333528,Bonnie,Sheryl was friendly and through when introducing us to her house.  It met our needs for a place to say near our Thanksgiving activities.  Everything was clean and well labeled.
2026794,23812171,2014-12-11,22304098,Bridget,"Sheryl was wonderful - she is a wealth of interesting stories and helpful tidbits about Seattle and a warm and accommodating host. The house is truly a work in progress. If you're expecting a hotel with the associated amenities and privacy, this place is not for you. However it was warm, cozy, and had everything my husband and I needed for exploring Seattle. If you appreciate good conversation and a bit of adventure, then this is the perfect place to stay!"
2026794,23964311,2014-12-15,24124752,Angus,"Sheryl was a charming host and very fun to talk with.   I just wish that we could have had more time to ""visit"" and ""yak"".   The house is charming and the bed was very comfortable.   In fact it was the best nights sleep I have had in a long time.   Looking forward to a repeat visit."
2026794,24625253,2014-12-31,475224,Rachel,"The cozy cottage is a great place to stay! Beautiful view of the city right out the front door. The cottage is 2 blocks south of Wallingfords Main Street with bars, restaurants, a delicious taqueria, QFC, pharmacy, and bus stops. The cottage is close to the zoo and a mile from Fremont. 
Sheryl is a great host and keeps the common areas very clean. I really enjoyed my stay. "
2026794,25553198,2015-01-19,12425192,Steve,"This was my first AirBnB experience and I could not have asked for a better experience.  Sheryl is a wonderful, very friendly and engaging host.  The room is clean, the bathroom and kitchen areas are spotless, and the house itself is in a great location, a quiet neighborhood, and close to several bus routes.  Walk 25-30 minute north to Green Lake, and about 20 minutes south to get to Gas Works Park.  Plenty of amenities nearby, too - QFC, taqueria, several bars and restaurants.  If you're a beer drinker, I recommend Bottleworks on 45th and Densmore.

(Because of the nearby bus routes available, I recommend downloading the OneBusAway app to your smartphone so you can see ahead of time when the 16, 26 or 44 will arrive at the bus stop.)

Once you're settled in, get to know Joey, the cat.  He's friendly, funny, and once he's used to you, he won't be shy about perching in your lap.  

Overall great experience.  I would definitely stay here again.  Thank you so much, Sheryl, for a wonderful time."
2026794,26237540,2015-02-08,1458876,Michael,"Sheryl communicated clearly and helped me with luggage up her front steps.  Guests (there are two rentable rooms) have run of the kitchen and share the bathroom [towels and a mat for each guest, and bathroom storage, are separated]  and dining areas.  Bedrooms are upstairs, bath is on the kitchen level.  Shopping and dining are a few blocks away on 45th street, bus lines are 2.5 blocks on either side.  I used public transportation and UBER.  The bedding was comfortable and warm; the house is being renovated bit by bit, and Sheryl is doing most of this herself.  She's happy to chat with guests or to leave them alone; we went twice together into ballet class at Seattle Center.  An elderly cat rules the roost!  This was a great experience"
2026794,26335759,2015-02-09,13260035,Carissa,Sheryl was an excellent amazing welcoming host!  The house is clean and comfortable and in a great location.  Within walking distance of restaurants and bars and excellent brunch.  So glad we were able to stay with Sheryl and Joey the cat.  Would highly recommend staying here when in Seattle!
2026794,27061792,2015-02-24,26373441,Jaeuk,"Sheryl was very welcoming, the listing description was accurate and the neighbourhood was friendly. Sheryl gave me a concise introduction to the area when I first arrived and whenever I had questions or needed help she replied to my messages promptly.  She also helped me with my cat allergy/cold situation by giving appropriate suggestions. Sheryl is very passionate about her house and is working very hard to make it more beautiful and cozy. During the stay she was working on the house but I didn't experience much inconvenience."
2026794,27524395,2015-03-06,28706449,Ashley,"Sheryl made me feel very welcomed with tea, snacks and a friendly spirit. The neighborhood is wonderful, which is why I chose her place.  "
2026794,27770325,2015-03-11,27908583,Melissa,"Sheryl and her home were both great! The location is wonderful - you could certainly get by without a car staying here. It is only a short walk to 45th with tons of restaurants &  a grocery store - and a longer, but manageable walk to gas works park or Woodley park. Also, the bus was easy to figure out for a trip into downtown and didn't take too long. The room itself was on the smaller side, but adequate for two adults and had ample storage. The bed itself was quite comfortable. The bathroom and kitchen were both very clean and everything was well organized and easy to find. Sheryl provided all linens and everthing in the kitchen you could need (she even had reusable shopping bags for guests to borrow.) The house is in a state of renovation, which according to Sheryl is perpetual :), but is definitely safe and provides character. 

Sheryl shared a lot of information about Seattle's different neighborhoods, and had suggestions of lots to go see/do. She also has a lot of maps and literature for guests to look at and take. She was engaging and easy to talk with, but not overbearing at all. She provided a good balance of hospitality and privacy. 

I hope to run into Sheryl again in Seattle and would definitely recommend her home as a lovely place to stay. 

This was my first stay in an airbnb. I thoroughly enjoyed it and would look to do it again on my next trip. I felt it gave a more authentic feel for the city, as opposed to staying in a hotel,  which was exactly what in was looking for."
2026794,27952062,2015-03-15,9226206,Amy,"Who needs Lonely Planet if you have your hostess Sheryl? Sheryl's home is indeed a Seattle landmark. Sheryl is a socially conscious, truly cultured citizen of Seattle. People like her makes Seattle Seattle. I got way more than just a room from staying at Sheryl's. I am looking forward to staying there again on my next visit to Seattle!"
2026794,28444216,2015-03-23,27367615,Tiina,"I had a great experience at Sheryl's. It may have seemed busy with everything that was going on, but I somehow felt really relaxed, even with the other guests. I think it's due to Sheryl's hosting abilities to explain everything clearly, not to mention all the great info she has on the area! Lots of maps and pamphlets to pour over during breakfast. She was a great help in my decision to move here. 

The room was just enough to be adorably artsy and still be relaxing, and it had a great view of the backyard. The bathroom was huge, and I loved the skylight! Plus, there were a lot of amenities. "
2026794,28964785,2015-04-01,27756560,Yu,"Sheryl is so nice and her house is clean and cozy. She will tell you everything you need for traveling and living in Seattle. Her cute cat is also friendly, not bothering at all. My room has a good view of some beautiful flowers ( I guess cherry blossom?) I enjoyed it so much! "
2026794,29025963,2015-04-02,13362123,Forrest,Sheryl has a great place to stay in a quiet neighborhood. The area is excellent and near bus lines which is really appreciated.
2026794,29327550,2015-04-06,13005203,Adam,"My brother and I had a fantastic stay at Sheryl's vintage style home. Sheryl was a perfect host and had a lot of great suggestions on what to do and where to eat. Wallingford itself was an awesome and safe neighborhood to stay in, everything you need was in walking distance from the house and you'll never run out of different restaurants or pubs to go to. The house definitely is 100 years old but it's like staying in a piece of history which I thought was cool and everything is exactly as Sheryl describes. The bed was actually bigger than I expected, my brother and I both slept comfortably and we're both 6 feet and up. Also the shower had good water pressure which is always big for me. I would definitely stay here again next time I'm in the area. Thanks again Sheryl!"
2026794,29643962,2015-04-10,30595117,Marina,"I have five hundred words to explain how amazing and wonderful my experience at Sheryl's was and that wouldn't be enough. I have never been as happy with an airbnb or a hotel as I was with Sheryl's house. It didn't have lavender water in the lobby, automated maid service, or even all the paint on the cabinets, but it had Sheryl and Joey. I could not have asked for a better place to stay. The room was SO cozy and I felt completely at home. Honestly, words aren't enough, so just stay here."
2026794,31720040,2015-05-09,275474,Maria,"Sheryl was a gracious and welcoming hostess, especially in view of the fact that she recently lost her beloved cat, Joey. The home was clean with an artistic and quirky character that I enjoyed. Sheryl has an easy,
gentle presence that makes staying in her home not as awkward as one might expect. The home is located close to everything, a historic charming neighborhood that is extremely walkable."
2026794,32216584,2015-05-15,1582467,John,"Very accommodating, very thorough on suggestions/directions to her house from the airport. Cute house and very nice room for a great price. What more can you ask for?"
2026794,32251880,2015-05-16,20524134,Marc,Very nice and helpful host and I had a good sleep in garden view room... Great place to stay!
2026794,32437170,2015-05-17,13548136,Robert,Sheryl was a great host. Her quirky home was just what I needed for my quick trip back to Seattle. 
2026794,32542430,2015-05-19,27331389,Carrie,My husband Andrew and I had a quick but lovely stay in Seattle at this charming cottage. Sheryl has thought of everything to make your stay enjoyable. The house is still a work in progress but man is it going to be amazing when she is finished! The neighborhood has so many places to explore to and it was easy to take public transportation to downtown Seattle. Thank you Sheryl for opening up your home to us!
2026794,33574222,2015-05-30,13677227,Sujay Kumar,"I had a very comfortable stay at Sheryl's house during the first two weeks of a summer internship. She was a very welcoming host, and was always forthcoming with great suggestions and tips on exploring Seattle. Her house is quaint and charming, and she takes great pride in constantly improving it and also keeps it very clean. Of course, the location can't be beat!"
2026794,33696062,2015-05-31,4078877,Henry,"I had a nice, though short, stay at Sheryl's place. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet her but she kept in close contact and made sure I knew all the ins and outs of the place. Lovely little room, clean, quiet place, fantastic Wallingford location. Would definitely stay here again. "
2026794,34293113,2015-06-07,16790818,Sally,"I had the best sleep I've had in years of sleeping in urban hotels, or anyplace else when I work in Seattle. The neighborhood was super quiet, the open window breezes were wonderful. I could see the city from the room, but not HEAR IT!! The room was well lit, clean as a whistle and even had wifi. I left the windows and curtains open all night and had the best sleep ever..I'm sold on air bnb and Sheryl's hospitality. Clean towels, shampoo, wonderful soaps, shower was wonderful. Wish I could have stayed longer! "
2026794,34759218,2015-06-11,35407951,Scotty,"Sheryl greeted me warmly at arrival. Very helpful with directions to the house as it is a short bus ride from Downtown Seattle. She provided helpful information about the Wallingford neighborhood, which I love. Lots of shops and restaurants nearby. Quick stroll to Gas Works Park, Woodland Park Zoo,  the Woodland Park Rose garden. The room is super cute and clean.  "
2026794,34835391,2015-06-12,15607994,Gina,Sheryl was very communicative and welcoming. She's a great host!
2026794,35565524,2015-06-20,33000668,Colin,"Sheryl is very knowledgeable about Seattle and the surrounding areas. She is warm, personable, engaging, and is an exemplary host.  Her home is artistic, and is reflective of her down to earth style.  The house is located in the beautiful neighborhood of Wallingford.  Her home is clean, cozy, and the bedrooms provide a view of either Mt. Rainier, or the wooded area of the back yard.  The house is close to a variety of restaurants, many within walking distance.  Seattle is an environmentally conscious city and her guest guidelines parallel the city's commitment to recycling.  Greenlake, the Burke-Gilman trail, and Lake Union are a 5-10 minute drive from Sheryl's house.  Access to I5, or Highway 99 are also within minutes of her home, making access to to downtown quick and easy.  The University of Washington is within close proximity.  I'll definitely be back!"
2026794,36104304,2015-06-25,33235213,Nancy,"The location and setting are quiet and convenient, although the house is undergoing major renovations. The rooms are small, clean and comfortable for a good night's rest. I recommend the south room for couples. The bathroom is downstairs and clean, well-lit. It's nice that you can't hear the shower or plumbing at all while up in the rooms. Sheryl is a wonderful host and we enjoyed looking at the tiny house books she has in her collection."
2026794,36377259,2015-06-28,11498912,Nikki,"My stay with Sheryl in the W room was nothing less than excellent!  I would recommend her adorable home to anyone.  She is a fantastic hostess to boot.  I stayed for 4 days and 3 nights so I was really able to settle in. The bed was very comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet.  A quick walk will take you to restaurants, a grocery store, a waterfront park, and more!  The bathroom is stalked with towels, some basic toiletries, and an incredible shower head!  I had plenty space in her guest fridge and freezer for all the food I had prepacked ahead of time.  One thing I really appreciated was Sheryl's warm, funny, and sweet personality.  I felt like I had known her for years.  I loved everything about Sheryl's place and would recommend it to anyone!  Her place is chalk full of fascinating history - ask her about it!  I would stay here again!"
2026794,37917407,2015-07-11,2379578,Hannah And Kayla,"Sheryl's home was lovely place to spend the night in Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet, with many shops and restaurants/cafes within walking distance. Sheryl has been renovating her cute house for a while, and she was working on it while I was there, so she showed me some of the awesome older aspects of the place that she's bringing to new life, and the newer aspects that make things feel modern (like the bathroom fan). I thought that the still-being-worked-on parts of the house were charming. It was also fun to chat with Sheryl while she showed me around the house. She makes guests feel very welcome, with notes around the house for visitors clearly noting things they might need to know (where are the recycling/tea/coffee/towels, etc), and I had a great sleep on the comfortable bed! Thanks for hosting me!"
2026794,38261572,2015-07-14,31018050,Sue,"This was my first time to Seattle and I enjoyed my visit.  Sheryl made me feel welcome and was very helpful with directions and advice for the area.  I had everything I needed...wifi, convenient plugins, mirror in room, access to refrigerator, and everything was labeled for each room.  The area is quiet/safe and she is currently working very hard on home renovations.  I rented a car, but it was not needed because public transportation is close by.  "
2026794,38419358,2015-07-15,5231990,James,"Great house with cozy room, located in a fun and interesting area of Seattle. Sheryl is a considerate and welcoming host. "
2026794,38639170,2015-07-17,22548898,Brittney,Thank you Sheryl for the wonderful experience of staying in your lovely home! We very much appreciated your hospitality and clear and concise instructions before and after our stay.  
2026794,39531517,2015-07-24,19344403,Alex,"Sheryl was extremely welcoming, always willing to help (whether it's  giving us suggestions for things to do in the area, or finding some medication for us when we needed it), and fun to chat with when we came back from a day of exploring. Her house is indeed cozy and charming, and the neighborhood is very beautiful and quiet. While it is quiet, it is not boring at all. There's tons of restaurants, coffee shops, and neat shopping places within walking distance. Also, there are nearby buses that come frequently which you can take downtown. We really enjoyed our stay here!"
2026794,39645102,2015-07-25,16201918,Toni,"Sheryl was there to greet us and to make sure we understood all the basics about using the space and was welcoming and cordial. When we returned later in the evening, she invited us to join her in watching Mystery Theater in her living room. We had a lovely evening, sharing things about our lives and enjoying ""Vera"".  Sheryl is well traveled and excellent at making people feel comfortable and at home.  Her home is a work in progress, but her vibrant creativity is evident everywhere, making even the partially finished aspects of the space pleasing and aesthetic. She has lots of materials to help people explore the area and is knowledgeable and helpful in helping guests navigate. The neigborhood is one of the most interesting in Seattle, safe and beautiful, near restaurants, boutiques and the old movie theater, with the university just down the road."
2026794,40117686,2015-07-28,36305983,Sarah,"Sheryl is a warm and welcoming host!  Prior to our arrival, she provided useful, time-saving tips on getting to her home via public transportation and made us immediately feel welcome upon arrival. Her home is colorful and comfortable, great for tourists as a ""home base."" Very well located, great neighborhood for walking/exploring, near the water as well as markets/shops.  Easy to get around Seattle via uber or public transportation (we used both).  Sheryl even took the time to show us around some of Seattle's historic neighborhoods--quite an unexpected but memorable time together!  I don't think you can beat the value for the location and hospitality."
2026794,41119608,2015-08-04,2459764,Christina,"Sheryl was a very welcoming host. The location of the house is great and the neighborhood is really nice. Sheryl was very friendly and outgoing, my parents enjoyed staying here."
2026794,41245139,2015-08-05,7308805,Susannah,"Sheryl was very welcoming and had great information to share about the neighborhood.   Sheryl was readily available and a very considerate hostess.   The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  The location was very convenient to many restaurants and public transportation.  Sheryl is working on remodeling this 1905 house and I'd love to go back and see her latest projects.  It is a work in progress, but the spaces we were in were clean and comfortable and it was fun to see her transformation of the house. "
2026794,42717122,2015-08-15,13496993,Tegan,Sheryl was great!  Everything was so well organized and clear.  Listing was totally accurate and the location was great.  Would totally stay again if I'm in town.
2026794,42897357,2015-08-16,31924874,Ben,"Sheryl was very helpful throughout the check in and stay even though she had to attend to matters out of town. She was communicative and helpful at every turn.

The accommodations were cozy and comfortable and her neighborhood is wonderful. There is plenty to see within walking distance and easy access to any imaginable necessity. We had a fabulous time staying in Sheryl's home!"
2026794,44636235,2015-08-28,30289053,Debbie,"What a great place and a really great host! The house is super pretty and really full of character, and has everything you need, including a really nice kitchen and dining table so you don't always have to eat out. It's on a gorgeous street which is really quiet and even has its own veggie beds on the sidewalk! Sheryl is such a welcoming host and really fun, I felt completely at home. I loved Wallingford,it's a really interesting neighbourhood with amazing food. Easy access to downtown on two diffferent bus services. Don't miss the gasworks park, a 15 minute walk down the hill, it has amazing views of the downtown across the water."
2026794,49365839,2015-10-03,20941819,Anne,"Sheryl was so great, incredibly welcoming. She knew the neighborhood very well and had all sorts of information for people looking for all sorts of things. The Wallingford neighborhood is incredibly nice, though I did not drive in so drivers bringing their car will want to look at other reviews. It's a very walkable neighborhood though, with lots of restaurants, stores, bars, and playgrounds. 

The house is definitely a 100 year old house though, so be aware of that. It's sort of a work in progress, but I think that adds a level of charm to the place. The bathroom is lovely and spacious, the kitchen is nicely stocked and clearly laid out, and the room was comfortable, cozy, and had everything one would want, including lights, outlets and extra blankets. Absolutely great."
2026794,49693985,2015-10-05,10798567,Rachel,"Sheryl is a very kind and accommodating host.  I felt comfortable as a guest in her home.  This is a great price for the centrally located Wallingford neighborhood.  I had a bike delivered through Pedal Anywhere, which made getting around pretty easy.  The house is light, bright, and cozy.  Sheryl has thought of every detail to make her house visitor friendly.  I would definitely stay here again!"
2026794,51065603,2015-10-17,45661754,Daniel,"I didn't get to meet Sheryl but she left detailed instructions so I could let myself in, and supplemented this via phone and e-mail. Her place is rustic and comfortable. The neighborhood is great: Nice and quiet, and a few blocks away from the commercial strip that goes through the heart of Wallingford."
2026794,51534820,2015-10-21,379575,Nori,"Very nice neighborhood with convenient shops, restaurants and public transportation along 45th street. The home as advertised was built in 1905 and is currently being remodeled. For those who are not comfortable with a work in-progress - you may wish to consider other accommodations. Bedroom was small and clean. Bathroom was downstairs and clean.
Sheryl was not in town when we arrived for our stay in Seattle but was very helpful with bus information and she communicated with us throughout our stay.
"
2026794,52154890,2015-10-26,46417409,Allen,"Ask Sheryl for PHOTOS of all the common areas as well as a more recent photo of the exterior before making a reservation. The house is described as being in ""the last stages of a remodel"", but my wife and I both strongly feel this is an intentionally misleading phrase...again, ask Sheryl for pictures of the common areas--especially bathroom and stairway.  As a couple renting her W room (she has an additional room that is larger and does not appear to be registered with airBnB), we came to understand ""cozy"" meant not only that one of us would have to climb in and out of our bed because the room was so small, but that we would be sleeping within a few feet of our host. While Sheryl was a pleasant host, we feel her photos and description of her accommodations are at odds with what is actually there. "
2026794,53134726,2015-11-05,46502804,Jiyoung,"It was nice staying in Sheryl's house. She welcomed me and my friend, we had a good conversation with her. Everything in her house was clean and neat (even though she was painting her living room:)) I like the neighborhood also, people are friendly, too.
I wish I could visit her house again and stay longer than this time.
Thanks Sheryl !! "
2026794,53634970,2015-11-10,46846138,Drew,Sheryl is the loveliest host! So welcoming and kind. Her home is very beautiful and in a great area. Highly recommended! 
2026794,53904353,2015-11-14,11881121,Susan,"The listing was accurate, and Sheryl welcomed me to her home with enthusiasm and friendliness. The neighborhood is a fun one, with many nearby restaurants, small stores, movie theaters, etc. Plus, people on the street are friendly. I enjoyed staying at Sheryl's house and visiting her neighborhood. The bed was very comfortable -- slept like a rock, or some other inanimate object. Lots of space for clothes storage. Good reading light beside the bed, and charging for my electronic devices. My room was bright, with lots of light coming through the window. Uncluttered and comfortable. Shared space downstairs was welcoming, and Sheryl was extremely gracious to my family members who dropped over for a visit. Basically, great place to stay, and I will be staying again, next time I have business in Seattle."
2026794,54161744,2015-11-16,1417166,Lex,"Sheryl is very welcoming and has a charming home in a great neighborhood! The house is a work-in-progress, as some other reviews have mentioned. Personally, I appreciated this aspect, as her attention and care are evident in the making of her spaces. The room was comfortable, with a window surrounded by trees. Within walking distance to Wallingford and Freemont, both quintessential Seattle neighborhoods. In town for a conference at the University of Washington, it was an ideal location. Recommended!"
2026794,54730873,2015-11-23,46608999,Isla,"Sheryl was incredibly welcoming and friendly, she invited me out to several social occasions with her, ( most of which, unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to make) and made me feel right at home. She's a lovely, fascinating lady, with lots of stories, and plenty on her hands with her labour of love; 'joeys place'!
Obviously Sheryl mentions in her description she is working on her home, which is not something that really bothered me, and I felt quite at home, but I know some have different ideas of what that means, as mentioned in other reviews. I think the main thing was that although cluttered, everywhere was super clean.
There are lots of local info and leaflets, maps and ideas of things to do in the area. I had full use of the kitchen, so I was able to make breakfast, and even do some laundry!
I was in the west room, which was perfect for me, with a very comfy double bed( couples may need more room, which the south room has, including I saw a fab view of the city!) 
The neighbourhood is stunning! Every house is slightly different, and was decorated for the season with pumpkins on porches and thanksgiving wreathes. ( classic American suburbia!) At the top of the road on 45th there is lots of shops and restaurants aswell as buses into downtown and Ballard. Fremont, the troll, gasworks park and the uni district are within a 20 min walk, and so lots to see and do without hiring a car.
I had a really fab time during my stay, and it was a positive first airbnb experience. There was no weirdness or uncomfortable moments that I maybe thought was part and parcel of staying in a strangers home. Sheryl made sure that wasn't the case, and everything was clearly labeled and explained.
Thanks Sheryl! :-) xx"
2026794,55438481,2015-12-01,10979271,Dale,"We did not meet our host.  She left clear directions however.  I have a feeling that what would make this a desirable house, is her presences."
2026794,56276610,2015-12-11,35558601,Noriko,"Sheryl is nice kind and good host. She helped me when I was confused. This location is perfect. You can walk to stores, restaurants, and if you drive, easy to go to downtown."
2026794,56329515,2015-12-12,42596162,Fran,"The home in the photo looks charming and in fact it is listed as ""cozy charming...."" but even driving up it did not appear this way. It appeared run down.  Sheryl was welcoming upon my arrival but explained the window in my room was broken out (it was being repaired on the floor of a rather messy living room ) and I would be staying in another room and that room was rented out for my 2nd night so I would then move into the room with the window problem. The stairway was raw wood as were all the window casings. Clearly much was in repair and my feelings is this is not a place to invite guest to stay for money. The curtain in the room I spent the night in does not cover all the window so to feel comfortable to undress I needed to turn off the light. I bolted awake about 5 am to what sounded like a rat in my room.  I cancelled my 2nd night at my expense and had to find another place to stay. The experience left me feeling upset and very disappointed. So much for charming!"
153967,355042,2011-07-05,740893,Melissa,Our stay was fabulous! The beds where incredibly plush and the neighborhood was so peaceful. What a great place to relax. And our kids loved the giant chess set! Thanks again and again Meg for the best weekend.
153967,371037,2011-07-13,578100,Hubert,"My wife and I spent a week in July-2011 in this very attractive cottage. The house is ideally situated in a quiet part of Seattle with easy excess by car to downtown, as well as to the Seattle Area. Free parking in front of the cottage. Has also a magnificent garden, and free wifi-access.
All the conveniences that we liked to be in the cottage ( kitchen with all equipment, refrigerator, TV, and -very important- a very comfortable double-bed ) were present, and everything worked for 100%.
In short: good price/quality rate.
We recommand this cottage without any hesitation."
153967,373580,2011-07-14,809936,Bill & Debbie,Our family stayed at the cottage for one night during our recent visit to Seattle.  The cottage was very charming.  A nice change from small hotel rooms.  The view was nice from the yard too. The kids enjoyed Alki Beach nearby.  We would stay there again.
153967,431877,2011-08-09,781106,Maria,"Thank you, Meg, for letting us stay in your cottage. We had a very relaxing time. The cottage is clean, and in a very quiet neighborhood.  It felt like ""home"" for our week. The decorating touches made it feel warm and inviting.  We were lucky to have had 5 great summer days, and we enjoyed visiting with friends in the front yard. I did attempt to walk back from the Junction, which is only about 6 to 7 blocks away; however, the hill from Alaska to Hudson was more challenging than I realized. I advise against it, unless it's part of one's exercise routine. All in all, we feel very fortunate to have rented this place."
153967,459969,2011-08-20,641691,Lauren,"The house was comfortable and perfect for what we needed. We were five adults traveling to Seattle for two nights. Staying in West Seattle was great, easy to get into Seattle Proper and fun to explore the neighborhoods in West Seattle too! Thanks! "
153967,475527,2011-08-25,1000491,Timothy,"Meg's cottage is marvelous -- I stayed for several nights, and when I first arrived I was delighted by how charming the place is. The yard is spacious, and inside it's very clean and comfortable and nicely decorated. Checking in went very smoothly, and my entire experience was positive and relaxing. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a lovely place to stay that's got old-time character with modern comforts."
153967,495949,2011-09-02,970708,Jan,"Very nice house in West Seattle, in a residential neighborhood.  The description of the house was very accurate, so there is little we can add.  It was nice to have so much room, and we also enjoyed the chairs and table on the front lawn on one sunny afternoon.

Even though it looks like this is far from the downtown, the connection is very convenient: bus stop is two blocks away, bus ran every 10 minutes and was near the Pike Place in about 10-15 minutes.  Buses have a special lane on the Seattle Bridge, so they can often get to downtown faster than a car.  We have friends of a friend who live in West Seattle and they use the bus every day.

West Seattle is a cool destination itself.  The beaches are nice and full of people, views of Seattle from the east side are spectacular, and there is an abundance of bars and restaurants to choose from--especially along the Alki beach and California Avenue.

One last thing: read carefully the house rules/manual.  Even though you pay a cleaning fee, the guests are supposed to clean after themselves, including washing the towels and linens. The cleaning fee is refunded afterwards.  We spent good 2 hours cleaning up the house (especially because it takes that long to wash and dry towels). We knew about it, so it did not come as a surprise, but I can imagine this could be problem for some people, especially if they need to leave early in the morning.  "
153967,568333,2011-09-26,886493,John,"Perfect location, close to friends. "
153967,766248,2011-12-05,1454712,Molly,"This was a great little cottage with easy access to downtown.  West Seattle has great food options so we enjoyed being able to get good food close to ""home.""  Meg's instructions for the house were very easy to understand and the place was clean and cozy.  The only thing we didn't love was having to do the sheets and make our own beds (one of the beds was a double bunk bed that proved to be quite difficult to make,) but Meg discloses this upfront so no one should be surprised by the request!  In general, the place was a great house to have at a very reasonable rate!"
153967,1053740,2012-03-27,1978930,Emily,This place was exactly like Meg states. Really comfortable and in a great location. Easy trek over the bridge gets you downtown. West Seattle is a real cute place and we had a great time. Meg was very quick to respond to Nything and we really enjoyed our stay. 
153967,1094626,2012-04-07,2003284,Grace,It felt home away from home... It was wonderful!
153967,1263500,2012-05-11,1304157,Nic,"Meg was awesome, everything she describes about her cottage is true. Everything was really easy to check in and a detailed list lets you know where everything is. Everything you need, groceries, coffee, whatever, is close distance to the cottage. "
153967,1421429,2012-06-05,2371485,Robert,"A lovely small cottage in a quiet part of West Seattle - the place is stocked with just about anything you could need or want during the stay. Meg's cottage was a perfect place to escape to during our visit to Seattle. It was quiet, peaceful, the neighbors were very friendly, it is only 10 minutes from Downtown, and very close to a cafe that apparently has the best dirty chai latte known to mankind from what I'm told by my wife. We very much recommend a visit if you're in this neck of the woods."
153967,1952857,2012-08-11,1787157,Tatjana,"We had a nice stay in this cottage. What we very much appreciated was Meg's responsiveness and flexibility. For a family with kids the garden was perfect. This was also helpful when we had to clean the house, the only part of the deal, which was not so good, as your simply not sure, whether the next guest have similar standards as you or not, and also, as it costs two hours of your stay. "
153967,2331182,2012-09-18,1591119,Sarah,"This cottage is a great deal for the number of people it sleeps! The number one reason I would recommend it is the affordable price. It is also in a great location: 5 minutes from I-5, just blocks off the West Seattle Bridge. It is close to Trader Joe's and a neighborhood with cafes, restaurants, bars, and other amenities. It is a long, but pleasant, walk to the water (over two miles). The kitchen facilities were adequate, and the laundry facilities were convenient. The yard is quite large for any city, and we enjoyed eating meals at the outdoor table and chairs.

This would be a great house for a couple and kids. The king bed is very soft but comfortable (that room is quiet and dark as well). The full bed on the bottom bunk is claustrophobic and not good for two adults. Also, the entire bunk bed is unstable/shaky and feels like it might break soon. The queen sofa bed in the living room is relatively comfortable. There were some missing blankets during our stay, but it sounds like that was an accident that will be remedied.

The only other thing to be prepared for is a general lack of atmosphere indoors. The size is cozy and comfortable, but there are almost no decorations and lamps, and the location and number of windows allows for very little natural light. We were not very tempted to ""hang out"" indoors. That being said, it's a great place to come back to and sleep, being dark and in a quiet neighborhood. We felt very safe and enjoyed going for walks and runs around the neighborhood. And I don't think you can beat the price for 5 or 6 (or 7, though I wouldn't recommend 7) people!

Lastly, Meg is a great hostess - she is very easy to communicate with and is quickly responsive to questions."
153967,2393881,2012-09-24,223684,Brian,The house was cozy.  Small but a GREAT deal for Seattle.  We enjoyed our stay.
153967,2777145,2012-11-01,998663,Crystal,"*I would actually give 3.5 stars if they allowed that*

My girlfriend, my dad, 2 aunts, and myself recently rented this cottage for a week while in Seattle for my graduation. My girlfriend and I previously lived in West Seattle and loved it, so were excited to find a rental in the area when traveling back. Overall we had a great experience, it was quiet, cozy, close to what we wanted yet far enough away to be comfortable, and it was nice to have amenities like a kitchen and living room. 

That said, I do have a few complaints/suggestions and things you should know upfront; 1) the couch in the living room was painfully uncomfortable!! This wouldn't be a huge deal, except that it was counted as a bed. I would highly suggest a new couch, or at least listing the place as ""sleeps 5+"" instead, because by no means did it make for a comfortable bed. 2) There were a few other updates that would have made for a more enjoyable experience (new towels, covering the old dirty chair, etc), nothing too bad, but its the little things that make a difference. 3) The owner had obviously not been there prior to our visit, it was really cold (55 degrees), the tv wasn't working, and there was a box by the front door. I have stayed at other AirBnB places and its just really nice when they take the time to ""prep"" in little ways like turning the heat on. Again, its the little things. 

And finally, 4) I know the cleaning thing is said upfront and others have mentioned it, but it truly needs to be reevaluated. Im happy to clean up after myself, but really didn't enjoy doing actual cleaning for the last 2 hours of vacation. I know we knew what we are getting into, but its just not a great last memory to have of a place. 

Again, overall it was a great experience and I would probably consider renting it again. I would though, first do some searching for something similar that had a more comfortable sleeping arrangement and didn't require this level of cleaning. "
153967,3385905,2013-01-21,2720765,Meghan,"Great location, cute little place.  However, there are not enough blankets in the place and there were only 5 of us. Luckily, we had some in our car and were able to keep warm.

The couch would probably not be a very comfortable place - I would say this place comfortably sleeps 5.

Kitchen is not very well stocked.  We had a hard time cooking as pots were missing lids, the knives were horrible and basic tools weren't available.  Kitchen table only has 2 chairs so we ended up eating on the floor.

However, the place is very clean and well priced.  "
153967,3854955,2013-03-21,1747432,Wilson,It was a great place to stay with perfect neighborhood and location. Clean and neat and the beds are comfy as well. 
153967,3930222,2013-03-28,5341030,John,"It was very conveniently located and the neighborhood was very nice. The kids enjoyed having a bunk bed and we enjoyed them having a place to eat breakfast in the mornings. 

This was a great alternative to a hotel and we would stay here again in the future if we were not moving to the area!"
153967,5422026,2013-06-29,5652858,Geoff,Great little funky cottage in Seattle!  Super quiet residential area...we all slept like babies!  Large front yard perfect for kids.  Real comfy beds...especially the king size bed!  It was overall very suitable for the 5 of us - 3 adults and 2.  
153967,5962064,2013-07-24,4617949,Stefan,"Reasonably priced, easy connection to attractions, nice cottage, good experience. Only the view was not as good as expected. At least not from the garden."
153967,6028051,2013-07-27,7099834,Scott,Thanks Meg
153967,6386525,2013-08-11,4983443,Robert,"We rented this house for one week in August and overall it was okay. It was in a good location for us as we had relatives in West Seattle. It had dishes and cooking utensils, and washer and dryer that made life easier and less expensive then hotel. The big front yard was nice since we had family over the last night for a big dinner.  I like that it was alarmed and made me feel like my belongings were safe during the day on our travels. There was an issue with one bed, but Meg responded quickly and had in fixed on our third night. The area is pretty quiet.

There are several things that I did not like. 

First, I could only get one window open (Small one in kitchen). Other than the window I got open there were no screens in windows or on the doors. Since we had to open the doors for air we had to also deal with bugs. There was one portable AC in the main bedroom (which was nice), but it only cooled that room and the living room. The kids’ room has no fresh air flow and stayed fairly warm during the day. I am guessing for 9 to 10 months a year this is fine, but it was over 80 for several of the days we were there. 

Second, there is some drywall work that needs to be done in kitchen and bathroom. It looks as if cabinets and other items have been replaced or fixed, but the drywall has just been patched and not painted. There is a dishwasher, but it is not hooked up and can only be used for drying. 

Third, parking can be a problem. If you come back during the day you might not find parking within a half block of the house.
"
153967,6487388,2013-08-14,1852042,John & Camilla,"The cottage had everything we needed. Clean, reasonably priced, nice yard, and in close proximity to Seattle. Many thanks!"
153967,7169188,2013-09-09,8146256,Stephen,"Overall a wonderful experience and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.

PLUSES
- The ginormous shower head.
- The memory foam king size bed.
- The very very quiet streets
- The yard (It was pleasant to hang out with some friends on a sunny afternoon in Seattle out in the yard.)
- All the plates and utensils one would need are right there.
- Close proximity to many restaurants and markets by car.

There are 2 things that I'd pay extra attention to while staying there: 
1. The manual warned the wood floor for the living room is extremely soft and scratches very easily. That forced us to be extra gentle compared to carpet floors, but we also felt better knowing it's visibly clean.
2. The manual's text formatting made it a little hard to read sometimes. I wish it was spaced out over another extra page or two for better readability, but that's the graphic designer in me speaking."
153967,7435421,2013-09-20,6675495,Stefan,"Megs cottages was just perfect for our needs. good price nice secure and quirt neighbourhood, easy access to the city and airport good parking and daily shopping, I definitely come again ! "
153967,8343610,2013-10-27,1515251,Colleen,The reservation was canceled 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
153967,9933366,2014-01-20,10667144,Sadie,"My parents were coming to visit us from the Midwest and our West Seattle apartment just wouldn't have been very comfortable for all of us. My parents were initially leary about staying in another persons home, but with the welcoming fireplace and big bed-they could not have been happier.  The kitchen was well stocked so we were able to purchase ingredients to prepare and enjoy family meals-we could have even baked a cake!  This space was perfectly cozy for our needs.  Meg was very communicative and timely in all correspondence.  We will absolutely stay at this rustic-ish cottage again"
153967,10068037,2014-01-28,11189272,Andrew,Meg was extremely accommodating to any request that I had. The place was very clean and definitely accommodated the 7 people that were in the cottage. Thank you!
153967,10567450,2014-02-25,1649187,Adam,"Nice, comfortable experience.  Thank Meg"
153967,11567768,2014-04-07,4114349,Bryan,"Hello :-) It was really fun to communicate with Meg. She knows this place inside and out, and there is no way to surprise her, which is nice. It means she loves the place, and it shows. 
My stay was a really memorable Spring stay. Sitting on top of the hill, so close to West Seattle groceries, and restaurants, and this time, the beautiful Old Growth Lincoln Park looking at the Sound and the Fauntleroy Ferry - it really made me like West Seattle a lot.
The cottage is exactly that, heated by a gas stove, and creaky in a comfortable way. Yet, everything works as if it is modern, and with windows open, it is light and airy.
As the Spring is coming, the outside table and chairs were calling me, but it was still raining on them, so they are there for the next guests :-)
I like having a washer & dryer, and cupboards full of useful things, just like in a cabin. 
I'd come here again, and would recommend it to anyone who respects a well-worn, well-maintained home with a good host. 
Thanks!"
153967,12017249,2014-04-21,6640053,Char,"Staying at the Cottage was the perfect little getaway for my group of friends and I for the Easter long weekend! There were six of us and all of us sprawled out comfortably from the master bedroom, the room with the bunk bed, and the living room couch that turns into a double bed. Everything we needed was provided - kitchen utensils, a coffee machine, and even condiments, spices and beans that have been left in the house from previous guests to pass down to the next. 

The fireplace was so key in the place feeling like a true cottage! We sat in the living room a lot, relaxing and snacking from the delicious food we bought at Trader Joe's - just two minutes drive away! That place is amazing and I wish we had one in Canada. So many good local and organic foods for cheap/reasonably priced! 

In the morning, we made brunch and ate out in the front yard with the patio furniture set up. It was so SO lovely! 

I really appreciated how easy everything was - it can seem intense with the alarm for the house and the cleaning manual book, but it actually isn't at all! Meg lays out everything so simply and clearly that there's very little room for error. 
At the end of the weekend upon our leaving, the entire group got together to divide cleaning duties and put the cottage into pristine condition! It was actually a rather nice bonding moment and made us all feel like a team, and wrapped up our amazing weekend in Seattle wonderfully. I like how this is a guest-run cottage and it's cool to think who will be staying there next. Meg should perhaps start a guest book?!? Would be a cool idea! People can share little things like what they discovered in the neighbourhood or how to properly use the coffee machine, brunch recipes - whatever! 

Lastly - Alki Beach being three minutes drive was amazing! You get the whole westside city skyline from across the water! There's a boardwalk and a bit of a beach that you can explore. On the boardwalk is a cool restaurant called Ma Kai - Hawaiian/Korean fusion restaurant! We had panko breaded fish and chips with kimchi and miso tartar sauce! They also had a patio to relax on too and got a great view of the water...

Anyways, I strongly recommend staying here. It's perfectly simple and what you make of your experience.
"
153967,13176871,2014-05-21,8565575,Lanita,"Everything went smoothly at Meg's cottage. The place has a lot of charm. The neighborhood is quiet and safe and close to Alaska Junction.
I'm not sure I've ever slept on a more comfortable bed!! I would definitely stay at Meg's again."
153967,14169103,2014-06-13,16359451,Tania,"We had a group of 6 adults stay in this cottage for one night and there was plenty of room for everyone. The check-in and out process was completely hassle free thanks to all the information provided via email by the host. The cottage was clean and had everything a person needs for a visit to Seattle. It is also perfect location, only a 10 minute cab ride to the stadiums and a short drive to downtown. West Seattle is also a neat little area with a ton of restaurants and cafes. Would definitely go back. "
153967,15910813,2014-07-18,12681386,Laurent,"This cottage is very cute and comfortable. It is also very well located, in a quiet and safe neighborhood, close to downtown, by car and public transportation. It is also pleasant to have a garden to enjoy outdoor breakfast or dinner."
153967,16347258,2014-07-26,9586956,Kelly,Great spot for our families to soak up Seattle. Communication with Meg was flawless and we felt it was our little home away from home. The front lawn area was just what the doctor ordered for the kids to stretch their legs. Nice quiet neighborhood.  
153967,16672041,2014-07-31,17082888,James,"We had a great time at Megs's cottage, it was very well kept and has good transport links to downtown Seattle. There were 9 of us and we fitted fine and all had a thoroughly enjoyable experience!"
153967,18049263,2014-08-21,12358376,Felicia,Great place to stay and just minutes from so many great places in Seattle! Meg was extremely helpful and responded to all of my messages within a minute or two. I would definitely stay here again!  
153967,18630486,2014-08-29,18676144,Kimberly,"What a wonderful place! I would highly recommend Meg's cottage for those staying in Seattle.  We hope to be back again soon!

153967,21531002,2014-10-19,21639091,Jess,"Nice place, nice neighborhood.  Easy rental.  Host was on top of everything from the security to the cleanliness.  You do have to clean the place yourself, and the cleaning list is a bit involved which made a 1-night stay a little stressful, wouldn't be bad for staying several nights.  Eat at Chaco Canyon cafe while you're here, right down the street and so good!"
153967,24321609,2014-12-26,20854504,Victoria,"We spent four days at the cottage, and had our family Christmas there. It’s a beautiful location, on a hill overlooking Seattle. It’s a cute, family-friendly neighborhood. The cottage is small, but cosy and heated well by a wood stove. The stove was on and had heated up the place nicely when we arrived. 

The bed in the master bedroom is very comfortable. We also found everything we needed in the kitchen to make and serve our meals.

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay. But we had a couple of issues:  There was a big crack in the frame of the top bunk bed (which my younger son had looked forward to sleeping in). He didn’t feel safe sleeping on it, so my older son volunteered to lay out a bedroll on the floor and give him the bottom bunk for our stay. 

Then on our last day, as we started using the washing machine to wash the linens, stinky sludge started backing up in the bathtub. The kitchen sinks began draining very slowly. Part of the deal at the cottage is that you do the cleaning at the end of your stay (which should take about 2 hours). Unfortunately, the backups made this a messy, stressful time—not the best end to our stay. 

Meg was friendly and responsive to our texts, but the holiday wasn’t the best time for getting people in for maintenance and repairs. "
153967,25539786,2015-01-19,23249830,Jenna,Lovely cottage that holds up to the description. Meg is very quick to respond to any questions/concerns and makes you feel very welcome. Great place to stay in a quiet residential area just a quick drive from excellent restaurants and scenery. 
153967,33067789,2015-05-25,26769881,Julia,Meg was very great at communicating before and during our stay at the cottage. The description and information we received was accurate and the house looked as expected. We loved her cute cottage! I would definitely recommend staying here. It is in a cute neighborhood in West Seattle. 
153967,35478380,2015-06-19,8998003,Jennifer,The cottage was everything Meg had described and pictured. Cute and clean home not far from the city center. Meg is responsive and is a great host.
153967,39240415,2015-07-21,38207740,Yoki,"I thought this house was very convenient for a small family to stay in. It has a washer and dryer if you you need to clean your clothes, a fully functional kitchen for cooking, and a living room area equipped with a tv. The appearance of the house is well kept and i would recommend to any of my friends coming to stay that this house is the place to be. not only are the living quarters awesome but also the person who own and runs the cottage. If ever i had a question Meg would respond minutes after messaging her. "
153967,40195664,2015-07-29,25042777,Nancy,"The cottage was clean and had a cozy feel to it. The yard space was great for eating out on the table provided and for having the 2 toddlers run around in. We appreciated some of the kitchen cupboard items left by past guests such as sugar, seasonings etc... and left a few of ours for future guest. (great idea!) The area felt very safe and its location was close to many stores/attractions.  We only had 2 problems.  The coffee maker didn't work on day one but after contacting the owner, a new one was delivered through Amazon within 8 hours!! Super impressed!  Also the twin bed leg broke and we appreciated the prompt attempt to repair it.  We would be happy to stay there again should we ever be in that area."
153967,40603456,2015-08-01,35729438,Ryan,"Meg was an informative, responsive host, eager to make our stay memorable. Our family of five had a wonderful stay in her cozy, clean cottage, as we explored Seattle for a few days. Particularly memorable was the water taxi from the West Seattle dock (just 8 min away) to the Seattle Pier. The cottage exceeded our expectations, offering a quiet, relaxing retreat after our days of exploration. "
153967,40891003,2015-08-03,29962939,Elizabeth,"Lovely home in wonderful neighborhood.   We loved having a kitchen and the front yard was such a perfect place to sit out in the sunshine and read and have meals.  Although comfy quarters for the 6 of us, it worked just fine and we were completely happy.  The location in West Seattle is amazing as it was an easy hop for us to get to downtown, the beach and to nearby shopping.   Definitely a great spot!"
153967,45238485,2015-09-01,30544505,Carlos,"Everything was as advertised, the place was really great. Me and the family have never been to Seattle and we were there for PAX. This was the perfect place to come back to from the Busy city. Cant say enough good things about the location and the surrounding area."
153967,45650062,2015-09-05,8291395,Keitha,"Meg was very responsive and communicative. The cottage was very homey, cute and conveniently located. Our guests enjoyed their time. "
153967,49279075,2015-10-02,45011525,Adam,The cottage was the perfect place for my stay.  Meg made everything really easy and it was a great stay. I would recommend this cottage to anyone.
153967,55340765,2015-12-01,32719981,Ashley,"Loved the location, easy to find.  Host was very accommodating.  Perfect size for 8 of us.  I would definitely stay here again when I return."
5685908,29591519,2015-04-09,30726658,Michael,"The location for this place was really great, everything on capitol hill within walking distance.  Bus lines to downtown and other areas in Seattle were right next to the place as well.  Cynthia made it really easy for me even when I booked the place last minute and was very responsive.  The space was perfectly clean and tidy.  I would definitively recommend and stay there again!"
5685908,30363847,2015-04-20,868981,Preet,"Cynthia was out of town while I was visiting so unfortunately we were not able to meet, but she was very communicative and checked in several times to make sure everything was going well. Her roommate was a great host and made me feel very welcome. The place itself was gorgeous and exactly as described. I love cooking and her kitchen was a pleasure to work in. I would recommend Cynthia without hesitation."
5685908,30633095,2015-04-25,30790480,Stephanie,Cindys place was great! My father stayed there while visiting us and its a great location. He said she was a great host. The bedroom was nice and clean and private with a private entrance. We will definitely consider having guests stay here in the future. Thanks Cindy! 
5685908,33688118,2015-05-31,31826802,Rachael,"I loved staying at Cynthia's, wish I didn't have to leave! When I arrived, I was happily greeted and shown to my private room downstairs, which was complete with towels, shampoo/body wash/conditioner, lotion, and wifi information posted. Cynthia also provided suggestions for things to and public transit information. The bedroom has its own door which was awesome and made it easy to come and go as I pleased. Over the weekend I even got to know Cynthia's roommates and some of her friends and we had a great time! Awesome experience overall and would love to stay here again!"
5685908,34153261,2015-06-05,31374569,Jesse,"Staying with Cynthia was wonderful. The place was clean, quiet, and comfortable. She was very friendly and accommodating. "
5685908,34978785,2015-06-14,5975507,Nicole,"The location of this apartment is unbeatable! Several bustling areas within walking distance, and downtown is a short bus or cab ride away. Cindy and her roommates were very welcoming, and the bedroom was very comfortable and clean. We were able to use the kitchen as needed, and having a separate entrance was very convenient. I will say there is some limited privacy: there is no interior door (stairs from the kitchen go directly into the room) which made it loud at times. Additionally, there is a half bathroom upstairs and a full bathroom (with shower) two floors up, making it a little cumbersome. Overall, though, really enjoyed our stay!"
5685908,35801507,2015-06-22,32511471,Candace,"Booking with an Airb&b was a first for my husband and I so we weren't  familiar.  The room was clean, bed was comfortable, and Cynthia was a wonderful host.  She wanted us to feel at home in her home.  We weren't there much,  so  we didn't utilize the kitchen or living room which was available to us.  There was a parking space in the back, which is especially nice in Seattle.
Great location!  Walking distance to everything.   We loved the bakery around the corner!  If you stay here, be sure to go.  There is also a Safeway and coffee shop one block down.  "
5685908,39496993,2015-07-24,33783548,Denise,"Cindy was a great host.  She has nice little touches like maps and brochures available.  And she was very understanding with me on my first airbnb experience - I didn't realize where the correspondence was on the website...oh well, Thanks, Cindy!"
5685908,39771882,2015-07-26,34959562,Jeff,Very punctual and communicated well.  Everything that was shown or represented in the photos and descriptions was exactly as experienced.  Awesome experience!
5685908,50018065,2015-10-08,19539762,Ziyan,Great location and efficient communication! love it!
5685908,51085367,2015-10-17,46188675,Dandan,The location is pretty good.You can walking to west lake center. There also some retraunt and supermarket nearby. Cindy and her roomate are young people and easygoing.
5685908,53268202,2015-11-07,2141829,Springroll,"Cynthia's location is pretty near to downtown ie Pike Place and near the Capitol area which has loads of eateries. There is also a huge Safeway just across the road and a couple of bus-stops around which makes it really convenient. 
We stayed in the basement and accessed it from a separate door. From the inside of the room there is a flight of stairs leading to the rest of the house and even though it only has a curtain partition we felt we had a lot of privacy. We share our bathroom with the host but that is not a problem with us as they kept it very clean. 
The weather was turning and as the bed was just next to the door it got pretty cold for me at night. The room does not come with a heater but we did not ask for it either as Cynthia prepared a lot of blankets for us. Also the door has glass panels so we get the occasional beam lights, though not directly, and noise from cars passing. For those who need complete darkness and silence to sleep may need to consider this. 
Cynthia is a wonderful and considerate host. You can tell by the number of blankets she had prepared for us and the jug of filtered water and cups on the dressing table for us. She made arrangements for check in really easy and checked in on us when we reached Seattle.  Once, she got locked out of her own house and was sitting on the porch waiting. She did not know if we were home and did not want to disturb us so she rather wait in the cold for her other housemates to come back. We just came back in a taxi and was surprised to see her. When we enter the house she jokingly thank us for letting her in into her own house. We had a good laugh. 
Our stay in Seattle was made much more memorable and pleasant because of Cynthia and I would certainly recommend her to anyone who wants a good location, fuss free and clean room. "

4130112,29987890,2015-04-15,1292021,Ben,Jordan's place was great. The house was as advertised and the hot tub and grill made it a nice place to come home to after a long day's work.
7869223,45317319,2015-09-01,41149347,Bec,"Place was amazing, Meghan was fantastic to talk to & very helpful! The place was easy to find, access to water taxi to go over to Seattle was great, place was clean and sticky notes where everything is! Highly recommend to anyone"

House was beautiful, clean, and stocked with all the necessitates!  We had a great stay!"
5813657,30811337,2015-04-27,30742815,Jamie,This place was the BEST! The area was cute and quiet. The house was spotless and so well taken care of. I came with my husband to have a little reunion with my famiLy and it was so perfect. My grandmother could not stop talking about how lovely the place was. 
5813657,31341870,2015-05-04,6530894,Dan,"The house was just perfect! The layout makes a lot of sense, and there is a lot of places to sit and relax or stand around and have some drinks. Two of the bedrooms have bunk beds, and two of the rooms have big beds. Perfect for any reunion or gathering of people. Would stay here again if we could!"

Beds were comfortable and the house is a nice layout. Would definitely stay here again. "
5813657,32200025,2015-05-15,29533660,James,"Great Experience for my first AirBNB,,,,really nice place clear direction on how to use the facilities"
5813657,32846506,2015-05-22,2224505,Naveed,Great home in a great location with kind friendly host. The house was conveniently located accurately described and very comfortable. My family visiting from out of the country was extremely happy with the accommodations and felt very relaxed and at home.  The whole house was thoughtfully decorated and then it is a perfect place for large families all wanting to stay together during a vacation. Overall it was a pleasant stay with a very kind and communicative host. highly recommend!!!
5813657,33278897,2015-05-26,32015059,David,"The house was a great house in a very good location near Downtown Seattle. We enjoyed all of the amenities of home, including the kitchen. Everything was clean and functioned. The Owner was very responsive! We would love to use the house again if we were ever lucky enough to travel to Seattle again.

"
5813657,33481027,2015-05-28,25109641,Yishu, This is a great place with cute decorations. Suitable for family and friends. 
5813657,33792657,2015-06-01,30018799,Nathan,"Had a great time down in Capitol hill, the house was in great condition and fit our large party well. The house was exactly as Blair portrayed and well worth the cost. Easy access to downtown and the rest of Seattle's amenities. "
5813657,34153821,2015-06-05,33727890,Dennis,The house was an absolute gem!  Everything was clean and fresh and better than expected.  There were fresh towels all over the place.  The welcome kits by the front door was a nice touch!  
5813657,36115304,2015-06-25,24853407,Jeff,The listing is accurate and this house is well-kept and comfortable. A truly wonderful experience for staying here one day with my friends. Definitely want to stay here for our next visit to Seattle.
5813657,36517787,2015-06-29,21048182,Gretchen,"Blair's house was a perfect spot for our girls getaway...
 There were 9 of us and plenty of room. 4 beds 4 baths.
Linens and all the house hold usuals were included.
We were within walking distance of Starbucks and lots of restaurants. A$10 dollar cab ride got us to Pike's market...
If I was doing another getaway with a large group I would highly recommend Blair's house."
5813657,37654813,2015-07-09,14895927,Brandon,"The house was lovely, and the location was great.  However there were communication issues that added unnecessary stress to the trip.  I was unable to reach the host until 2 hours after the stated check-in time, and were unable to check-in when we were able to reach him because the cleaning hadn't been done.  "
5813657,38106264,2015-07-13,27820007,Brenda,"First of all I can't say this enough the house and location was perfect we we re able to travel to every attraction within 20min or less which was great cause we were a big group ,it catered to the 3 two year olds we had this place is kid friendly ,we  were able to eat at the house thanks to all the utensils already provided this house is perfect for us it was all out needs were meant  sleeping arrangements and the first floor were great everyone got bed and speaking of the bed, sooooo comfy my in laws loved it would I reccomend this place yes! I hope to return soon made traveling a breeze for us,neighborhood is quiet and clean which was a bonus I hope to return to this home away from home and if anything was missing  the house book was all there and ready with brochures as well made picking up the phone for yelp non existing which saved us a headache only real problem was which one to chose."
5813657,40894463,2015-08-03,29592895,Megan,"The pictures are accurate and the layout of the house worked well for our group. The 3rd floor has two bedrooms, each with their own bathroom, the 2nd floor is the living space, kitchen and bathroom, and the 1st floor is the main entry, 2 bedrooms that share a bathroom and exit to the back patio (which is a little weird because you have to go through one of the bedrooms to get out there but was nice to have). The location was very convenient, close to downtown and in a cute neighborhood. It did seem like some of the fixtures of the house were not very sturdy... the silverware rack in the dishwasher kept coming off, one of the towel racks came off after just hanging a towel on it, and the place could have been cleaned better (I had to re-wash several kitchen items before using them because they were dirty) and the cleaning supplies were left out in the upstairs hallway. Fairly minor things that didn't greatly affect our stay, but worth noting. Overall the value of 4 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms (+ a half bath) and the good location were worth it for our group. "
5813657,41925941,2015-08-10,30130999,Raymond,"The house is amazing. Full kitchen 4 bed rooms. There was 10 of us staying for a Dota2 gaming convention at Key Arena.  We were close to downtown and is very convenient for us. 

Some down sides:
Bottom bathroom had issue flushing. 
1 parking pass which was not enough for a party of 10 as we have 3 cars and the garage was unavailable for us to park. 

However, it was a very nice place to stay. Bedding and pillow were really comfortable. Kitchen utensil were fully stocked. We would definitely come back and stay for the next convention if it is hosted in Seattle again. "
5813657,43029514,2015-08-17,17935169,Katie,Communication ahead of time was friendly. The house was very comfortable and clean without any clutter. The description on the listing was accurate. The neighborhood had a nice coffee shop just a few blocks away which was perfect for our morning needs. It would have been nice to have closer restaurants. Our family had a delightful time staying together!
5813657,44544763,2015-08-27,38123119,Mark,"Everybody loved the place! All the beds were very comfortable, every bedroom was private, enough bathrooms for 3 couples. The kitchen was well equipped and the living area was more than spacious enough for the 6 people in our party. The location was perfect! 5 min walk to bike rental station and a 10 min bike ride to safeco/century link and down town. Would definitely come back to this place"
5813657,45366353,2015-09-02,19044696,Alexandra,"Great place, easy check in and check out. "
5813657,46263403,2015-09-09,28746894,Ervin,Blair was very responsive and informative in all aspects prior to check-in. The house was clean and exactly as described. The beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of room for all of us. The neighborhood was quiet and in a great location. We could not have asked for a better stay. 
7638689,44264364,2015-08-24,14543981,Henriette,"We werden heel vriendelijk verwelkomd door de zus van de eigenaar. Zij gaf ons tips en ook Bonnie gaf via mail ons allerlei ideeën om te doen Alles in huis was overzichtelijk en schoon, de inrichting is modern. Het is een licht huis, er zijn heel veel boeken, ook in het Nederlands en het heeft een piano! "
7638689,46763553,2015-09-13,41645247,Mark,We had a great time in this beautiful Ballard neighborhood house. 
7638689,47227343,2015-09-16,8640540,Chris,"We had a fantastic stay at the Hummingbird House. From the moment we booked though our whole stay our hosts were super responsive, friendly, and welcoming. Their home is beautiful and in a great neighborhood. Luckily for us, their home was very kid friendly as well and our two young boys loved their time there."
7638689,47729441,2015-09-21,41494256,Melissa,We were kindly greeted by Dan who went over the house details. The home was very clean and quaint. The neighborhood was peaceful and nostalgic. 
6239108,33331447,2015-05-26,1323336,Peter,"Kanjin the host was great. He's a Buddhist monk and the money helps raise money for the monks, so that was cool, too. Kanjin made me feel welcome. The place was comfortable and nicer than I expected, much better than what it appears in the pictures. We had a great time. "
6239108,33865374,2015-06-01,25546242,Ted,"This was a nice, quiet place to stay - very picturesque and comfortable. Kanjin was very helpful and accommodating. Highly recommend. "
6239108,34495241,2015-06-08,1193016,Jennifer,"Kanjin was a great host, he was easy to contact in case we needed anything.  He texted to make sure our stay was going smoothly and he went over fun things to do in the area of Ballard.  

The apartment was great!  Just what we needed with a comfy bed and satellite TV.  There was also a futon in the living room so you could sleep there if you wanted.  "
6239108,35599946,2015-06-20,35377069,Michael,"A nice one bedroom apartment with all the amenities in a quiet neighborhood.  The location was a short drive to downtown Ballard where there were many interesting places to eat and drink.  I thought that the host was very friendly in our communications during my stay and the price was a good bargain.
I rated the stay a five star due the fact that nothing else could have been done to improve my stay and that the apartment was as advertised."
6239108,35827186,2015-06-22,34233436,Josh,Great 1 bedroom apartment near good stuff in Ballard. Kanji and Mike were very relaxed and accommodating. 
6239108,36584615,2015-06-29,35429012,Paul,"Beautiful location. The apartment was clean and inviting. Not far from the bus stop, and close to Golden Gardens park. Flexible check in / check out. Reasonably priced. Looking forward to coming back. Thanks Kanjin!"
6239108,37597898,2015-07-08,18693808,Matt,"Kanjin, Michael and Kazi were fantastic hosts, and went beyond what I would have expected them to as hosts during our 4 day stay with them.  Great at communicating throughout the process.  We were able to get the keys without any issues.  The apartment matched the description as advertised.  

The neighborhood is definitely safe.  We had a car, and they provided us with room to park it.  I can't comment on public transport in that area, though we were told there's a bus that picks up within a few blocks of the house.

Highly recommended as hosts and a great place to stay!"
6239108,38173376,2015-07-13,23981101,Samantha,"The apartment was great. Great location in a nice safe neighborhood, very clean, simple check in. It was an easy place to stay for the weekend, exactly what we were looking for!"
6239108,38518434,2015-07-16,7934628,Shannon,"Kanjin was waiting to welcome us when we arrived. The apartment is on the second story making for amazing views at sunset. The place  was immaculate, perfect for our small family. Surprisingly Quiet  for being near a busy part of Seattle. Downtown Ballard is adorable.
Parking is right downstairs. 
Be sure and visit Golden Gardens park on the sound while you're there."

When I finally arrived, getting into the apartment was a breeze and everything was incredibly clean with plenty of extra blankets for my nephew and niece.  I would certainly recommend staying here again."
6239108,40278146,2015-07-29,39200355,Helen,"This was a peaceful place with lovely views.  The bed is comfortable, the shower is great, and the kitchen is nicely laid out.  I liked the overall design of the apartment a lot.  The neighborhood is private, and almost rural in flavor, but Market Street in Old Ballard is just a few minutes away by car down 28th Avenue.  There are also bus lines nearby.  It's very easy to get to."
6239108,42269895,2015-08-12,9930449,Alice,Kanjin was great at making us feel welcome. The day we got in it was a little chilly and and personally came with more sheets and blankets as well as helped us turn on the heat. Very easy to reach through phone and message as well. The place is as described and has a comfortable sofa bed as well. Our week stay involved some cooking and all necessary utensils were provided. The Ballard neighborhood is lovely and peaceful but very short and easy drive into Seattle's center. Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle. 
6239108,42633363,2015-08-14,18492801,Ned,"Great apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Easy access, very comfortable, spacious!"
6239108,43794906,2015-08-22,38211195,Joseph,"Kanjin has a lovely home in the Ballard district in Seattle. It's very close to nearly everything but is in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood providing a nice private ambiance in contrast to any hotel experience. All amenities are provided for. I'd recommend visiting the local fish market and bakery on 24th and fixing a good home-cooked meal if you have time. Do yourself a favor and avoid hotels if you're able to and book this lovely townhouse for your next stay in Seattle. You won't be disappointed. Thanks again Kanjin!"
6239108,45405936,2015-09-02,33148510,William,We had a wonderful stay at this airbnb. There was plenty of space and it was very nice and quite. Kanjin was very accommodating to all our needs. I would highly recommend this place.
6239108,46426556,2015-09-10,42791503,Lea,"Kanjin's apartment was perfect for my parent's weekend stay in Seattle! It was stocked with everything they could have needed for the weekend and was warm and welcoming. The neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and close to downtown Ballard and Golden Gardens.  Kanjin was very accommodating and made our first Aribnb experience a good one. "
6239108,47584191,2015-09-20,14832866,Mark,"The Ballard apartment was the perfect place to stay for my needs.  It is in a very quiet neighborhood north of Ballard, near the water, in easy reach of anywhere in North Seattle.  It is much nicer and better priced than a hotel suite.  Kanjin was very responsive.  For example, I had a problem with the furnace.  Kanjin immediately arranged to have the furnace serviced and brought over a space heater to use in the interim.  Any place can have the occasional problem - what makes the difference is how the problem is addressed and Kanjin passed the test with flying colors!  I fully expect to go back the next time I need to stay in that part of town."
6239108,48838318,2015-09-28,43897604,Rex,"Kanjins place was an excellent first Airbnb experience for me. The host was very courteous, helpful, and made us feel welcome. He gave advice about the area, gave us his cell number to contact for any needs we had, and even filled up my car tires which had gone flat. The place itself was very cozy, clean, and very comfortable. All around great experience, I would highly recommend it."
6239108,52274208,2015-10-27,33398215,Denise,"It was so wonderful staying at this apartment. It was clean, quiet, comfortable in a beautiful area and perfect for our needs.

It just had a good feeling staying there. Check in was very easy and Kanjin provided us with lots of martials on public transportation to make it easy for us to move around and go places if we wanted to.

We will be back and are looking forward to staying again.
Thank you Kanjin

6239108,55196290,2015-11-29,44098315,Peter,"GREAT location - close to parks, a coffee shop & major routes to Seattle.  Appropriate for visiting couples.  Quiet.
Only possible issue - 15 stairs to/from.
We will stay there for all our future trips to Seattle."
6239108,57443912,2015-12-26,36826187,Brian,"We had a very nice stay in this apartment, it was exactly what we were looking for.  The apartment is clean and quiet.  Kanjin was very friendly and welcoming.  This is a beautiful part of Seattle with Puget Sound nearby and historic downtown Ballard is only a short drive away."

5470629,33538885,2015-05-29,1618,Elaine,"I had the great opportunity to be Barbara and Tau's second guest in their new garden level suite. I fell in love with it immediately - they really put a lot of thought and effort into making the space comfortable and welcoming for their guests, and provide such sweet little touches such as coffee, homemade cookies (yum), a little notebook with all the local information you would need to find your way around. I loved the space - open layout with a lot of great light. Very clean and very lovely. I don't want to rave too much about it otherwise it will be fully booked for the next time I want to go back ;).  Highly recommended. You will be very happy here!"
5470629,33725404,2015-05-31,33697911,James,"Our first experience with Airbnb was fabulous.  Barb had made us cookies and left other goodies upon our arrival.  It was such a nice treat after having traveled all day.  The garden apartment was even better than the pictures made it out to be.  It was newly finished and just had such a comfortable feeling we almost didn't even want to explore Seattle.  The location is perfect to walk to almost anything and everything fun.  Great eateries, shopping and farmers market all nearby.  We will be coming back to the area often and just hope that we can stay here again, it was that good."
5470629,34067270,2015-06-04,25749987,Sarah,"Barbara and Tau were wonderful hosts - easy to communicate with and available.  The place was wonderfully appointed, fantastic layout, and in a great neighborhood."
5470629,34442222,2015-06-08,3921030,Daryl,"I can only echo previous reviews. Our stay at the Ballad Garden Apartment was simply wonderful and it's true that it's even much nicer than the photographs suggests. Everything is brand spanking new and we were surrounded by good taste and good quality. This homey home away from home is in a quiet neighborhood with the occasional distant sound of children laughing and playing at recess, which we loved. The best bakery in town is just steps away (but plan on getting there early if you want to get in) and downtown Ballard is an easy walk. Perhaps most importantly, our hosts, Barb and Taru, couldn't have been nicer, more generous or more accommodating. One reviewer mentioned the homemade cookies, but failed to mention the oranges, granola bars bottled water and even enough coffee and cream to get us started. It was all over the top in the nicest of ways. If you're planning a stay in Ballard, you definitely want to stay here."
5470629,35377035,2015-06-18,25443893,Dean,"The Ballard garden apartment was perfect for our week long stay in Seattle. Barbara and Taru were excellent hosts. The apartment was  clean, airy and full of light. The bed was very comfortable. We loved the location as it is on a quiet residential street but close to great restaurants, bars, bakeries, the Sunday farmer's market and a grocery store. On street parking was available either directly in front of the apartment or within a very short walk. I highly recommend this apartment for a great stay in Seattle."
5470629,35801495,2015-06-22,29710279,Mary,The Ballard Garden Apartment was lovely. It was well appointed and had all the comforts of home. Barbara left us snacks and was very welcoming. The locations is very convenient to downtown Ballard as well as restaurants and coffee shops. We will stay again!
5470629,36412423,2015-06-28,24545897,Summer,"We had the best time staying in the Ballard Garden Apartment. We felt as if we were staying with family. The apartment is beautiful and so much more than we expected, everything is brand new. It was perfect for myself, my husband and our 9 month old daughter. Barbara left us some wonderful treats that was a nice suprise, we had coffee and snacks when we woke up without having to run to the store. The location is wonderful and walking distance to everything you'll need. Ballard is our favorite part of Seattle :) We hope you enjoy it as much as we did. We'll be back!!! "
5470629,37659859,2015-07-09,10001858,Eric,"We can't say enough positive things about Barbara's AirBNB apartment. 

Everything is really brand new, and very clean.  The layout is great, with a bedroom you can close the door to, in case one person wants to watch TV in the living room, or someone wants a nap.  The kitchen is perfectly setup for cooking, with everything you would need.  We did go to the farmer's market and had some 
fun cooking local foods...Morel Mushrooms.  It's good to have an alternative to all the great restaurants, it makes the trip more interesting and affordable.

The location is great, only a half a block to the bus stop, which will take you almost everywhere.  We never rented a car, and had a great time walking and bussing.  We were in walking distance of the Chittenden locks and the Nordic museum, both great.  We enjoyed the Natural History Museum at Washington University and MOHAI.
Don't miss eating at Ray's Boathouse and Volterra, and for desert the Pie Bar and Walt's Scoop, all within walking distance."
5470629,38560321,2015-07-16,37906849,Brendan,"Super easy to book and quick response. Barbara was a great host.  We loved both the place and the location. Photos do not do this place justice. Roomy, tons of light. Great little kitchen. Short walk to tons of great restaurants and shops. Highly recommended walking along Ballard Ave & stopping by Golden Gardens park for sunset.  "
5470629,38827210,2015-07-19,30739900,Louise,"Barbara was great. She welcomed us then left us to settle and be comfortable.  The location was fabulous.  So close to downtown and everything we needed.  Around the corner from our daughter which was perfect.  The unit was lovely, clean, new construction, comfortable, and Barbara was easy as a contact..  The property lacked for nothing. Thanks!  We hope to be back!"
5470629,40581175,2015-08-01,33157048,Andrea,This is a fabulous apartment with wonderful hosts! Comfortable and well appointed. Barbara has thought of every basic need from olive oil to shampoo and a hair dryer. Easy access to public transportation and a short walk into Ballard. I had a great time and will stay again the next time I visit Seattle.
5470629,41942365,2015-08-10,25454688,Rick,"Great spot in Ballard close to 24th and Market st shops/restaurants.   Brand new well designed apartment in owner's home.  Plenty of privacy and responsive friendly host.   Spacious with comfy bed and plenty of kitchen space.   Dining etc. Is Designed for a couple plus perhaps a small child or two; not for entertaining.  A great week.  Thanks, Barbara!"
5470629,42699153,2015-08-15,36964993,Marilyn,"We thoroughly enjoyed our first airbnb experience. Barbara was so welcoming and obviously put a lot of attention and love into the apt. Which made it feel warm and cozy. It had everything we needed and more...fully stocked kitchen, bathroom supplies (hairdryer too). Ballard and its lovation were outstanding with restautants and desert places like Hot Cakes"". Bus 40 tan right to downtown. We would love to come back and stay."
5470629,43496536,2015-08-20,12809623,Nick,"Barbara made us feel welcome and at home from the first minute. The welcome cookies are every bit as good as we'd been led to believe, the apartment had everything we needed, and the location itself is perfect: surrounded by a ton of good food, drink, and transportation downtown. Couldn't ask for a better experience."
5470629,44939354,2015-08-30,39251161,Aliza,"Barbara is a thoughtful and gracious host.  The apartment is an architectural jewel, designed, built, decorated and equipped perfectly whether you stay for a weekend or far longer. 
The unit is bright and incredibly comfortable with a high-end equipped kitchen and a great bathroom.  Barbara even provides cozy robes!  The bedroom is great with a very comfortable bed, a variety of duvet and lighter blankets and loads of space (closet and dresser) to unpack.  Gorgeously finished concrete black floors have radiant heat.
The whole place is spacious and so calming.  The wall color and furnishings gave us a very Zen/peaceful feeling.  Entrance is private.  Windows are double paned and we did not hear any noise (it seems there is construction on every block in Ballard.  We also did not hear any footsteps or sound from our hosts who live above.
The location can't be beat.  Walking distance from Market Street with  the best restaurants and shops.  QFC (upscale supermarket), is a quick walk.  Will definitely stay again and again."
5470629,45383870,2015-09-02,38091709,Melissa,"Barbara was a wonderful host and made us feel welcome from the first moment we arrived! The water bottles, cookies, and coffee were a wonderful welcome gift (and of course, we loved seeing her adorable puppy Darcy too!) The apartment was well furnished, comfortable, quiet, and in a wonderful location to lots of wonderful restaurants and, of course, coffee! We absolutely loved staying there and hope to come back and soon! Overall, this was the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in!"
5470629,47353598,2015-09-18,27536349,Debbie,"Barbara made us feel welcome. The apartment is new and very clean. It was wonderful to have a useable kitchen as I cooked several times, she even lent me some flour when I needed it! The neighborhood had coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and bakeries all within a short walk. The con for us was that there is a lot of construction happening on the street so it was noisy early in the mornings and no laundry availability.  But we did love playing with Darcy!"
5470629,48016500,2015-09-22,16173710,Kjersti,"We had a wonderful stay in Ballard. The apartment was cosy, clean and well stocked kitchen. Barbara was very helpful, she helped out in every way and we highly recommend this place. Would definately stay here again!"
5470629,48934297,2015-09-29,21773868,Jim,"This was our third AirBNB and each has exceeded our expectations.  Barbara's apartment could not have suited our needs any better.  Everything about it was very nice and very thoughtful.  We hope to visit the area again before long and we may even have to plan the dates around the availability of Barbara's apartment.   
Barbara, thanks again for everything!!!"
5470629,50807856,2015-10-14,9467509,Emily,"We stayed at Barbara's Ballard Garden Apartment for almost a week while our boat was in the shipyard in Ballard.  Barbara was excellent with communication, and her wonderful apartment was exactly as described on Airbnb.  The space is clean, open, and wonderfully kept.   Barbara provided special touches like homemade cookies and locally roasted organic coffee.  The neighborhood is super quiet, and there are plenty of fun things within easy walking distance (parks, groceries, restaurants, locally owned movie theater, Old Ballard pubs, Ballard Locks, Sunday Farmer's Market, etc).  Next time we need a place to stay in Ballard, Barbara's place is at the top of our list!  Thanks so much Barbara!      "
5470629,51211986,2015-10-18,7414848,Hal,"Barbara's place was lovely and clean and we enjoyed our stay.  Barbara was very helpful, thorough, and available for us.  Parking was a cinch and the bed is comfy.  Plus we enjoyed her super cute puppy."
5470629,52425579,2015-10-29,6523406,Debbie,"Taru was extremely welcoming, warm and professional.  The apartment was a perfect fit for our 5 night stay in Ballard.  It was everything we had hoped for.  A nice sized space for both my husband and I to work independently, a fully appointed kitchen for meal preparation, and a warm and cozy feel for when we needed our down time.  Any time we visit Ballard, we hope to stay again.  Thanks for the hospitality, Barbara and Taru!"
5470629,53833271,2015-11-13,1579152,Lynell,"Barbara's apartment is located in the lovely and cool Ballard area. Quiet neighbourhood, yet lots of great coffee shops, restaurants, vintage shops, etc in easy walking distance. The ground-level apartment was warm and welcoming, with our own entrance to this beautifully remodelled 1903 home and snacks ready for us. Comfortable bed, full kitchen and spotlessly clean. From the moment we made our first inquiry until we left, Barbara provided helpful, friendly and clear information about our stay. Thank you!"
5470629,54002576,2015-11-15,47069184,Carson,"Barbara made me feel so welcome! The apartment is so comfortable, clean, and well appointed that I wished I were staying longer. It's also larger that I thought it would be. It's truly a gem."
5470629,56996544,2015-12-20,9418,Emily,"We had a great stay in this beautiful apartment in Ballard! Barbara was a great host and the apartment was warm, clean, and well-organized with everything we could possibly need. Thank you!"
3652434,21264531,2014-10-13,9556282,Sebastiaan,Angelica and her husband are the best hosts you can wish for. They do everything to make your stay unforgettable. We had a very nice welcome. They are very interested and they tell you everything you need to know about the city. The room is very nice and pretty. You have the whole floor to yourself and everything is very clean. 
3652434,21646904,2014-10-20,9041000,Eleanor,Angelica was such a lovely host! Her place is really nice and comfortable with a great view of the water and city. Delicious breakfast too.
3652434,22386111,2014-11-04,23084232,Jack,"Angelica was away during my four-day stay but Randy and Frida (an irresistibly friendly middle-aged Golden Retriever) proved the perfect host and hostess. The ""City Life Views"" lived up to their billing and I enjoyed the nearby biking and hiking trails and the proximity to the U District.  Randy made me feel like a truly welcome guest in his home and every time I followed one of his suggestions as to local restaurants or points of interest, I was glad I had. I wholeheartedly recommend this listing and would be glad to stay there again. "
3652434,22514105,2014-11-08,23091353,Donny,"I'm hesitant to do a positive review because right now I really want to book at least 4 days a week (weekdays) every week until I find a permanent place because it's 1 block from my office, but I feel I have to. 

Angelica and Randy are amazing people and Frita is exactly what you'd expect - awesome dog. 

Breakfast of the week  ""Quiche biscuits and Greek yogurt"" 

Finally and really important - this bed you'll be sleeping on is AWESOME!!!!!!!"
3652434,22611304,2014-11-10,22936157,Seth,"What a wonderful place to stay in a new city! Angelica was great with logistics and setup, and very flexible on when we could check-in. As soon as we arrived at their beautiful home we found a wonderful space and fresh grapes and chocolate waiting for us. The bedroom, bathroom, and living room were straight out of a magazine, and there was a great view of the skyline and the Space Needle. The bed was one most comfortable either of us had ever slept in, and Angelica and Randy had delicious breakfast and strong coffee waiting for us. They were both gracious hosts, and were very helpful with offering us suggestions on where to go and what to see while we were there (hint: check out Ballard). They offered plenty of maps and guidebooks, as well as some local publications with ""best of"" lists. They gave us the rundown on the best Farmer's Markets in the area, and sent us off with a smile. This place will be our first choice the next time we're in Seattle. "
3652434,22912876,2014-11-17,3588696,Ashlee,"Angelica and Randy were absolutely wonderful hosts and provided us with exactly what we needed: a great location, a comfortable bed (memory foam) , suggestions of places to see and eat, tasty morning coffee and breakfast, and overall hospitality. The view from their home is great and close to just about anything. The upstairs area is really accommodating and open feeling. Thank you for having us Angelica! "
3652434,23223545,2014-11-25,1010475,Mike,"Was looking for a central location to show a friend around Seattle and Angelica's Top Floor sounded promising. And from the prompt replies and thoughtful inquiry about food allergies she made the welcome as seamless as an exclusive resort.
Was exactly as described with the whole top floor to ourselves so as to enjoy our privacy, or  amble downstairs to socialize with Randy and play with Freda, the best Golden Retriever in Wallingford! Great walkable area with safe quiet streets and the Burke Gilman Trail down the block.
Cool little restaurant down on the shore that has an outdoor fire pit.
My friend commented on how comfortable she felt when Randy brought up breakfast in his pjs. Both were really laid back yet fully aware of our presence.  Thanks Angelica and Randy AND Freda! for a most relaxing weekend.
Will be returning soon and recommending this   gem to visiting friends/family.
Mike"
3652434,23401110,2014-11-30,9147485,Tony,"The space was clean, spacious, and very comfortable. Bed was equally comfortable, and Angelica was very nice and we lacked for nothing. We would have liked a television, but two nights without Letterman won't hurt.
We enjoyed our stay very much."
3652434,23487002,2014-12-01,9188259,Laura Adele,"This place is perfect for anyone traveling through Seattle. We needed a place to stay for a night before the Seattle Marathon, and this was a wonderful choice. The place is gorgeous and private, but we were also made to feel at home with our guests. The bed was really comfortable, everything was very clean and organized, and the location is excellent. We were able to take a bus downtown just a few blocks away from their place. Angelica is very friendly, and made this AirBnB experience unforgettable."
3652434,23710894,2014-12-08,5951513,Kevin,"From the moment we arrived, Angelica made us feel welcome! She accommodated us with an early arrival and then later on, when I asked about a cup of coffee, she made a delicious espresso for my wife and I! The bedroom and entire top floor has wonderful views and southern exposure which allowed lovely light to stream in. 

After a relaxing afternoon, we were off to our Ball and didn't get home till about midnight. Having the front door code made coming back late easy. The bed, oh the bed! My wife fell in love with the adjustable (motor driven by remote control) tempurpedic bed. She loved slipping under the sheets with the gentle massage lulling her asleep! 

Angelica had set up a cool little vietnamese coffee set so I could make excellent coffee when I woke up. I enjoyed the views and the quiet morning while my wife slept in. The WiFi is free and fast and they have a great little travel book library to peruse as well. The next delight was the tasty breakfast prepared by Angelica. Fresh fruit, yogurt, and organic juice (orange and carrot mixed - delish!) was all really good. However, the special treat was the warm little french toast rolls with candied walnuts that tasted like mini cinnamon rolls! Her husband, Randy, was more than willing to share his recipe secret with us. :)  Oh, and another great espresso shot to start the day!

The private bathroom is well appointed with great little shelves to put your things on. The shower itself was a very nice rain shower type head that felt like a thick, hot waterfall as it cascaded over me. 

It is fun to stare out the windows at the passing boat traffic down below. You can see the downtown lights and even the Christmas tree on top of the Space Needle. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we parked either in their driveway or across the street during our stay. Their dog is super chill and very sweet. Not a peep and totally cool with us as guests coming in and out of the front door when unloading or loading our bags.

All and all, we had a wonderfully relaxing time in Angelica and Randy's warm home! They are fantastic hosts and we look forward to staying with them again in the future!"
3652434,23883864,2014-12-13,23091353,Donny,Amazing as always!
3652434,24534035,2014-12-30,16929965,Willie & Rin,"Had a great stay with Angelica & Randy. The place was exactly as photographed and had a very comfortable bed. The hosts were very friendly and we were even invited to join  them for a drink in their kitchen one evening, which we gladly accepted & enjoyed. They also provided awesome breakfast & helpful pointers for our visit. Would definitely stay here again and recommend to others."
3652434,24620795,2014-12-31,17765903,Kyle,"Angelica and Randy were delightful hosts. Everything else you read about their hospitality is spot on. In addition, the neighborhood where they are located is a neat little part of town within walking distance to Ballard, Fremont, and Udub. If we ever come to Seattle again, we won't hesitate to book a stay with Angelica and Randy :)"
3652434,24880018,2015-01-03,7719433,Ashton,Super cute living area and bedroom. Very close to a great part of town and downtown. We had a great time and Angelica and Randy were so wonderful! Absolutely great experience all around!
3652434,25239918,2015-01-10,12934633,Ryan,"Angelica and Randy are wonderful hosts.  The top floor room has a wonderful view that I enjoyed the entire stay.  This neighborhood is in the heart of Seattle-right by Lake Union, Fremont and UW areas.  Restaurants bike and jogging paths are plentiful and within walking distance. Parking was very easy in the neighborhood and always plentiful.

Anglelica was nice enough to make a nice breakfast with delicious coffee each morning.  I was even joined by their wonderful golden retriever, Frieda a couple times--very sweet dog and a nice bonus!

The bed was incredibly comfortable!  I slept amazing every night.  I would highly recommend staying here."
3652434,25395344,2015-01-14,8267428,Sarah,"I just had a quick 2 day trip in Seattle for work, but even in the short time I really appreciated Angelica's place as base camp. It's just what you would expect from the positive reviews. The house is right on the Burke-Gilman Trail (great if you're a runner), within walking distance of Gas Works Park, and in the hip neighborhood of Wallingford. Angelica is a wonderful host, she goes above and beyond by making a delicious breakfast available to her guests. The hosts were also very  respectful of my space - I had a whole upstairs suite available. "
3652434,25532954,2015-01-18,370964,Serena,"Angelica's space was beautiful and comfortable. I was only there for one night and being quite tired from traveling and interviewing, I didn't explore too much of the area, which is why all the napping and sleeping I did on the oh-so comfortable bed, was even more of an added plus. 

Although the name of this site is air bed and breakfast, I've rarely had breakfast included in my stays. Angelica's place was different for this very reason. She presented me with a gourmet breakfast and even made it dairy and gluten free due to my dietary restrictions. Absolutely amazing-her delicious fare and the fact that she made me breakfast and made me something on my diet!! 

Angelica and her husband also offered all sorts of ideas for settling into Seattle once I've moved, which was very helpful. All in all, a great stay."
3652434,25614515,2015-01-20,1888397,Bruna,"Me and my husband were at Angelica's place for a week and we are super happy with the experience. The room is great and it has an amazing view! The breakfast they served us every morning was really good and the neighborhood is very pretty and close to everything. But the best part of our stay was the fact that we got to meet this great couple that is Angelica and Randy and their super cute dog, Frida! They were super nice to us and helped us with everything we needed. We could not be happier with our choice!"
3652434,26122349,2015-02-03,8591326,Grant,"Angelica was an awesome host, she did a great job making me feel welcome at her home after a very long day of traveling. Despite being 13 hours later than my expected time she stayed up to make sure I found the right place. I appreciated her also having a beer and pizza waiting for me as I came in. Honestly wish more AirBnb hosts were like Angelica as this little act helped make my trip much more enjoyable! Very clean apartment with very comfortable bed and if coming back to Seattle again would not hesitate to book with Angelica again!"
3652434,26278538,2015-02-08,5099536,Christina,"Angela was an incredible host, going above and beyond what I would have expected. To illustrate --- one evening, I had a work emergency when my laptop broke down, and she generously lent me one of hers to finish a project on! I am forever grateful for that. 

The space (all of the 2nd floor is yours) is also beautiful and very welcoming. Clean, comfortable, and all the amenities if you need them (hair products/tools, toiletries, etc). You are just a minute walk away from a fantastic trail that takes you along the water all the way to a gorgeous view at Gas Works park. Also a nice walk to the U-district as well. I would absolutely stay here again when I'm back in town."
3652434,26473271,2015-02-13,1857087,Peter,"Angelica and Randy (and Frida the retriever!) were excellent hosts, dealing with last minute booking, being flexible with check in timing, and then being fabulously welcoming and relaxed.  The space has an absorbing view across the water, and feels very comfortable.  Breakfast options and service was special, and I had great chats with all.  I would highly recommend a visit and will be back."
3652434,26484141,2015-02-14,4290296,Willy,"Angelica and here husband were extremely gracious and welcoming!  Their home is beautiful, in a perfect location which is quiet enough but still very close to 'the action.'  I would recommend this to anyone!"
3652434,26552434,2015-02-15,10103404,Ann,"The neighborhood was nice.  The suite of rooms was quiet and comfortable, with great views.  It was an added touch to have breakfast provided.  "
3652434,26621148,2015-02-16,20894039,Martha,Angelica was so nice! She responded quickly and anticipated our arrival at our convenience. She was very welcoming and very kind to us and our dog. The loft-lounge area didn't have a door but the bedroom did and it was all very private. The breakfast was super yummy and a definite treat especially since she brought it up to us. We were very glad to have stayed at such a cute place with a great view. 
3652434,27009212,2015-02-23,3176825,Shannon,"The B & B at City View just ideal for a single person or a couple wanting to stay in the north end of Seattle, and close to the trendy districts of Fremont, Ballard and the University district. Angelica is the perfect hostess, and the place is charming - bright, open and airy, and the bed is super comfy. Breakfast was delicious, and was just the right amount - I left completely satisfied without feeling like I had been stuffed to the ears with carbs and sugar. And finally Frieda, the canine hostess, is equally as welcoming! If I ever need a place to stay in Seattle again, this place will be a the top of my list."
3652434,27152121,2015-02-26,335510,Sun,"We stayed 2 nights and felt right at home in the elegantly decorated suite. Angelica and Randy (and their dog Frida) are wonderful hosts who made us feel right at home, and the breakfast they brought up each morning was a great way to start the day. Highly recommended."
3652434,27236608,2015-02-28,551904,Michael,"A super comfortable suite, located meters from Lake Union, and hosted by an uber cool couple. Angelica and Randy are warm and welcoming, and quite knowledgeable in their world travels. For runners, Cheshiahud Loop is runner friendly and takes you through several neighborhoods. Just look out for bikers zooming by!"
3652434,27368796,2015-03-02,10387133,Lori,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay with Angelica and her husband, Randy.   Great location for restaurants and walks, close to the Fremont shopping area, and available street parking.  Highlights:  the bed and  pillows (temperpedic!),  an excellent shower,  plenty of space to relax, and a fabulous view.   Angelica made us feel very welcome  and at ease.  We highly recommend this listing."
3652434,27687662,2015-03-09,14864831,Michael,"This was a lovely place to stay for 3 nights.  Great breakfasts, bed and bath.  Angelica and Randy were very gracious hosts.  Recommended! Thanks."
3652434,27815522,2015-03-12,14387274,Karen,"Our hosts did everything they could to make us comfortable.  The bed and bathroom were cozy, clean and comfy.  The living area opens up to hosts' living area so we were always aware that we could be disturbing them if we made too much noise.  At one point my son made us all laugh so much that i was worried we would get kicked out.  It was late in the evening.   Same issue in that to get to the bedroom we had to pass thru shared front hallway of hosts.  
 There was a fridge but no way to heat water so I tried to make some bedtime  tea with  tap water, ugh.   Offered waffles for breakfast but surprised to see eggos on my plate, had not seen them on my plate since my son was a toddler.   Most B&Bs make something special or signature for breakfast.  Basically a friendly clean cozy comfy place with shared experience, nice hosts,  basic amenities.  
It was very handy to my son's home in Wallingford.  Son jogged back and forth to visit, we drove.  "
3652434,28043599,2015-03-16,8242084,Neil,"We were made to feel so welcome and comfortable during our weekend stay. Angelica and Randy are interesting and charming.
We were in Seattle to visit our three adult children; the location was excellent and easy access to everything around the city. Parking was not an issue, of which we were grateful. 
The breakfast service was really nice and the bed was amazingly comfortable!! 
LOVED the beautiful houseplants, patio and Frida."
3652434,28174470,2015-03-19,12704552,C. Mayola,"We only spent one night but it was exactly what we needed. Perfect location, beautiful views, and comfy digs. It was my first AirBnb experience and it went off without a hitch. I'd like to stay longer next time and explore the area more. Angelica was very welcoming and accommodating."
3652434,28340404,2015-03-22,28821521,Bert,Awesome space and better people. Best AirBnB experience I've had. Big open space and cozy bedroom. Angelica and her husband Randy are outstanding hosts that make you feel welcome - they're also really interesting to talk to. Highly recommend staying here if you can.
3652434,28408582,2015-03-23,28257003,Matthew,"It was a totally wonderful experience staying with Angelica and made our trip to Seattle so much better. The accomodations were spacious, comfortable, relaxing, beautifully decorated, fresh, and airy. There were dozens of travel books and maps of the city available and Angelica was full of perfect recommendations. I only wish we had more time to do and see them all. We were a 10 minute drive from all the sight seeing spots and had beautiful views of the lake. We would definitely stay here when we come back. Absolutely lovely experience."
3652434,28621949,2015-03-27,347313,Joe,"Angelica and Randy were very communicative and kind! They made the check-in process quick, easy, and convenient.

The location is FABULOUS! Within walking distance to: Gasworks Park, Fremont Bridge (Troll), Wallingford shopping district, and just a quick drive to the U. We walked to Green Lake Park (but we're urban hikers, and 4.5mi return may be a bit much for some).

We only stayed overnight, breaking up travel, but this was the best way to do so. They had coffee, tea, and breakfasts provided – which was an unexpected benefit. The space is cozy and wonderful – they do a great job making rainy Seattle seem tropical. "
3652434,28884146,2015-03-31,25487678,Chunchun,"It was a very good experience live in this place. The house is clean, and there has flower inside with good cent.  I will definitely live here again when I plan go Seattle. Angelica is so nice showing us around.  "
3652434,28959797,2015-04-01,29541578,Phil,"Angelicka and Randy were great! They welcomed me very warmly to a clean and attractive, as advertised. Additionally, there were some nice little chocolates and brochures of things to do in Seattle. Angelicka was also happy to recommend and direct me to interesting spots around town. Breakfast was lovely, and included some fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Probably the best I've ever had!"
3652434,29406059,2015-04-07,27578134,Fang (Flora),"great place and lovely host
we really enjoyed our stay there"
3652434,29627932,2015-04-10,14765368,Saundra,"Spacious, immaculate, great views and neighborhood with extra special touches such as beautiful patio/garden area, chocolates, Tempur-pedic bed, local magazines.  Private area and quiet - nice breakfast as described.  Randy and Angelica are warm and welcoming - recommendations we enjoyed were walking to Ivar's fish and chips bar, nice dining on the water, Pronto bike rental for ride around Lake Union, Burke-Gilman trail for nice run.  They even mailed us my daughter's necklace we left behind.  Super close to U-Dub and downtown.  Fantastic stay!"
3652434,29863620,2015-04-13,25375043,Katelyn,"Our first Airbnb experience was amazing! The suite was very clean and the amenities provided were great. Since public transportation was near by, it made it easy to travel around the city.  Our host was extremely accommodating and gave great suggestions about local restaurants and activities! Definitely wouldn't have been the same trip in a hotel. "
3652434,30298346,2015-04-20,22483566,Steve,"I had a wonderful time staying at Randy and Angelica's place.  It was exactly as described.  Location was fantastic with walking destinations in every direction.  From the University area with restaurants and shops galore to the zoo and parks (Seattle Sensory Garden was amazing!).   Downtown was an easy bus trip and the airport was a simple transfer to the Link at the downtown station.   Very clean, comfortable, quiet house with spectacular views of the downtown area and Space Needle.  "
3652434,30584682,2015-04-24,7571398,Theresa,Angelique's top floor suite was the perfect accomodation for me and my maltese Celeste while my husband had over night hospital stay at UW. Peaceful water and garden views. Just enough little snacks so I didn't have to go out food hunting. Angelique and her husband are very considerate and have paid the utmost attention to the details of their Airbnb. 
3652434,30797488,2015-04-27,29823702,Danielle,Angelica was a great and welcoming host! She provided us with everything we needed to feel comfortable and relax. The living space was as described and the views were fantastic. She and her husband gave us great recommendations for places to go in the area and throughout the city. The location made it easy for us to get around by foot and car. I will highly recommend this listing to any friends seeking a rental for their visits to Seattle!
3652434,31189728,2015-05-03,25678684,Andrew,Great stay. Angelica and Randy were great hosts.  The top floor was exactly as described.  Plenty of space. The food in the fridge was a real surprise. Thanks.  The advice of activities close by very helpful.  Bus stop to Downtown real close. All in all a great stay. 
3652434,31372064,2015-05-04,31551045,Judy,"Angelica, Randy and Frida were really sweet people (and pet!). Angelica called us immediately to let us know that we had left something behind. I only wish we had had more time to visit with them. Angelica made us cappuccinos in the morning which was very much appreciated. Great neighborhood for walking. It felt very safe. It was close to downtown and the university district. We would definitely stay again. 


"
3652434,31623264,2015-05-07,4888268,Peter,"Angelica, Randy, & Frida's (golden retriever) place was fabulous! We made a rather last minute reservation and Angelica was very accommodating with great communication. Their place is gorgeous and the sitting area & bedroom were very nice. They had beer, coffee and a light breakfast for us which was welcoming. Their golden retriever was very friendly, in & out was easy and the location was perfect (great city & lake views). Thank you for a wonderful stay in Seattle. "
3652434,31883408,2015-05-11,6815073,Lori And Dave,"We loved this quaint little home on the hill above Lake Union. Just two blocks from the Burke-Gilman trail and amazing views of the Seattle skyline and Space Needle. The suite was perfect. Room for relaxing, a neat and tidy bedroom with an amazing queen-sized bed and a lovely private bath. You can't go wrong picking this place. Angelica was a perfect host, always having coffee, continental breakfast and mid-afternoon snacks ready for us. We would be delighted to stay again!"
3652434,32073417,2015-05-13,31609430,Heather,Had a wonderful time in Seattle. The place was perfect! Plenty of space. The light breakfast was perfect. I would definitely stay with Angelica and her husband again! 
3652434,32359765,2015-05-17,31086955,Rob,"Angelica and Randy have a very beautiful home! The upstairs was very comfortable, and they provided many amenities for us. They were very helpful in suggesting things that my fiance and I could do while in Seattle. Their dog is sweet and didn't make a sound. The location is within walking distance to a bus stop, which is how we got around. Overall I would highly recommend them."
3652434,32485370,2015-05-18,29063738,Chardae,"Angelica and Randy were fantastic hosts and made me feel so welcome! This was my first AirBnB experience and I can't imagine a better situation. Their dog is so sweet and makes you feel right at home (if you have a dog, like me). I would recommend staying with them a million times over. Randy has some great local brewery suggestions, so make sure you ask him!"
3652434,32779973,2015-05-21,3794337,Leena,"I loved everything about this experience. My hosts were warm, charming and so accomodating.

For me, this space was everything I could hope for and more.
Wish I could move in!"
3652434,33228391,2015-05-26,25072219,Murray,Angelica is very pleasant and attentive
3652434,33897007,2015-06-02,27437762,Gustavo,"Angelica and Randy are really nice people and amazing hosts. They made everything to make us feel welcome and helped us with buses  schedules, how to go to places we wanted to, and other tips about Seattle. Their house is very nice and very clean. The suite is very good and allow you to have privacy. The neighborhood is very good and close to University of Washington (less than 15 min by foot). "
3652434,34622184,2015-06-10,27975375,Alyssa,Angelica was great and very helpful.  The water/coffee filter broke and she was immediately there to help remedy the situation.  She recommended restaurants and helped with public transportation. 
3652434,34805268,2015-06-12,33694930,Sarah,"Angelica's home was everything she described and more! It was in a great location, had a great view, was well decorated and very comfortable (temperpedic mattress!) Breakfast was super healthy and she even shared her delicious fresh cantaloupe. We also enjoyed her plant collection and garden. We would definitely recommend it and definitely stay here again! "
3652434,35449335,2015-06-19,27763864,Jikai,"Angelica and Andy are very helpful to my parents, even as they can only speak limited English. Their dog is amazing as well! They provided a lot of useful information about dining, touring around the city and Portland. Definitely will recommend Angelica's house if any other friends are visiting Seattle!"
3652434,35562354,2015-06-20,32630281,Terry,We enjoyed our stay.  The location was great; we were able to walk to dinner and then take the bike/footpath to a park with a terrific view of the city.  Angelica was very nice and the top floor suite was too. We really appreciated the stocked fridge in the morning when we had to leave. Thank you so much!
3652434,36102261,2015-06-25,32982192,Grace,"This stay was wonderful. The hosts fulfilled all promises, including leaving us plenty of coffee, tea, and other drinks and snacks in a mini fridge and water filter machine for our private everyday use. We had the upstairs to ourselves, with a door that separated the bedroom and bathroom from the living area. The bed is incredibly comfortable! And the views for my morning coffee were unforgettable.There was an outdoor patio available to us, though we only used it once. 

The location was walking distance to some nice views, but mostly bus or drive-able I'd say to most restaurants and shops. Though we did walk to a water-front restaurant for dinner one night. 

 I felt like I was in a nice hotel staying here. You will surely enjoy your stay."
3652434,36367658,2015-06-28,29048515,Michelle,"What a fantastic way to visit Seattle! The upstairs suite is lovely, private and so much more than I expected. The Tempuer-Pedic bed and pillows are very comfortable, the bathroom is bright and clean and it's outstanding to have your own living space to enjoy coffee in the morning, or reading in the late afternoon sun. Angelica and Randy are very friendly, and generous of both time and spirit! They make you feel welcome and valued, and are happy to share in conversations and make recommendations. The whole experience was wonderful and I can't say enough good things. Thank you so much, Angelica & Randy.
*$11-$14 uber/Lyft to downtown Seattle, very quick and convient"
3652434,36940237,2015-07-03,24492058,Patty,"This is a great one bedroom suite with your own living room and wonderful view of Lake Union, next to Fremont and the dollege district.   
Angelica and her husband are super nice and provide a very comfortable setting with comfy bed, private bath and some yummy treats in the fridge in addition to breakfast.
While not in ""downtown"" it's a 5 minute drive from Seattle Center and great getaway location.  I highly recommend the ""Top Floor Suite with City Views.  
Pat"
3652434,37138384,2015-07-05,29120553,Adrian,"Our very first airbnb experience and we landed lucky with Angelica & Randy who are the perfect hosts. Beautiful neighbourhood, very comfortable accommodation, very helpful hosts and Frida the friendly dog. Bus route on the doorstep, Angelica recommended Ivars Salmon House which was spot on and Irwins coffee house just up the road was the best for breakfast. Many many thanks to Angelica and Randy (and Frida) for helping to make our visit to Seattle such a memorable experience. This accommodation is top notch. "
3652434,38099634,2015-07-13,3461053,Lola,"Angelica was a perfect hostess. We had all the privacy we needed or wanted. The space is welcoming, super clean, and well equipped. My husband and I highly recommend a stay here for anyone in the Seattle area."
3652434,38283874,2015-07-14,34374354,George,We had such a great time. Angelica was so friendly and helped us out by opening her doors up to us. She also has the sweetest dog ever. I would definitely stay with her again and would record to anyone. 
3652434,38693854,2015-07-18,27486302,Lauren,"What a great area, a bit out of the city but glad we were. It was an easy walk to the city and grab a bike. Angelica and Randy were great hosts with lots of info and places to see. Upstairs suite was charming and relaxing. "
3652434,39166888,2015-07-21,33537433,Cheryl,"Although Angelica was not there when we arrived (she was running a 24-hour marathon!), Randy was very welcoming, great suggestions for dinner. Loved the space...it was better than described! It was so convenient to the University for us to attend a wedding. Also, many wonderful restaurants were within walking distance. We met Angelica when she returned the next day and chatted for a bit...what a delight she is! And the driveway parking was very much appreciated! Thanks for all your suggestions."
3652434,39594488,2015-07-25,400056,Marta,"We enjoyed our stay at Angelica and Randy's place; they are warm and very friendly hosts.  Their upstairs suite is comfortable and private. The organic goodies in the fridge and the coffee/cold water machine were a very welcomed, nice touch. Their house is on a quiet cul-de-sac and conveniently accessible to downtown via bus lines just a couple of blocks away. Their lab Frida is a friendly and very sweet pet.
We don't hesitate to recommend their place highly."
3652434,39912210,2015-07-27,30506105,Larry,"Angelica's communication was warm and welcoming. The suite is very comfortable and decorated with great style and nicely furnished. After encountering two traffic snarls on Northbound I-5 from Portland that extended the drive by almost 50%, it was wonderful to arrive and see beer in the refrigerator. There was also a nice selection of food and coffee that made the next morning equally pleasant. The location is great--2 minute walk from Lake Union and a 15-minute or less drive to downtown."
3652434,40200506,2015-07-29,27502968,Paul,"A very nice place, clean house with an upstairs that had a great view of the bay. Spectacular location. Great neighborhood. A nice selection of quick food on the go and Angelica had a wealth of resources on the area. We were sad we couldn't stay longer!"
3652434,40478436,2015-07-31,11708053,William,The host was very clear on accessing the top floor apartment. The house and parking are easy to find; it is set in an area that overlooks the Ship Canal of Seattle. It is handy to downtown and the University District.  We liked the outdoor setting area at the front door.  The bed was wonderful and the bath had a great tub as well as shower. You are in a wonderful setting here.
3652434,43270287,2015-08-18,4401743,Bryan,"Wonderful experience with Angelica.  Very communicative and a gracious host. The private space is bright and the bed is a temperpedic (which I sleep on at home) so it was great to not get a sore back from a night away from home.

There was so much breakfast to choose from, but I went for the home made scones and coffee.  Sitting in a chair in the morning sun watching the morning traffic on the bridge in the distance was a great way to start me day.

I highly recommend Angelica and her Top Floor Suite."
3652434,44232931,2015-08-24,41642609,Sabrina,"The place was great! Very well kept, and in a great location. The host gave us some awesome recommendations on places to have dinner and drinks around the house.
Would not hesitate to stay again. Thanks!"
3652434,44537992,2015-08-27,37163112,Casey,"My sister and I stayed with Angelica and her husband while we were just visiting Seattle. They have a beautiful home and are very friendly and welcoming. Angelica left breakfast options in the cabinet and even snacks mid-day which was super nice. The space upstairs was our own area, which was open and very clean. I would absolutely stay with them again!"
3652434,45066588,2015-08-31,33165037,Coventry,"We spent three great days at Angelica’s place. The upstairs suite has ample space, privacy and everything you need to feel at home. It also has nice views of the water. Angelica’s place is in a great location and we made use of the fact that there are excellent shopping and dining options within walking distance. There’s a coffee maker and refrigerator in the suite and Angelica makes sure you have a lot of options for breakfast. We look forward to staying there again!"
3652434,45633125,2015-09-04,19586759,Ian,"My experience was great!  Had a few questions about check in prior to checking in and Angelica was very helpful and prompt with her response!

Check in was seamless.  Code for door was easy to use.  

Location and view was perfect!  It was very close to downtown and just minutes away from the awesome Gas Works Park that we went to!

Amenities that Angelica offered was a plus!  The hot/cold water and coffee machine was perfect for morning and nights!

Overall we had a great experience and would definitely recommend staying here!"
3652434,46114025,2015-09-08,29731340,David,Our hostess made us feel very welcomed.  We arrived later than expected on a Friday night & Angelica was so kind.  The neighborhood & listing were very accurate.

It is in a great location with easy access to downtown and other fun neighborhoods in Seattle. The space was incredibly clean, comfortable and private.

This was my first Airbnb experience, and I'm very happy with my choice. Their dog Frida is so sweet!"
3652434,47993781,2015-09-22,37424216,Michael,"Great experience! Angelica warmly welcomed us, provided suggestions for restaurants, parks, coffee and more. All were fantastic.  Great location. The most comfortable bed my wife and I have ever slept in. The provided amenities were just like the 4 star hotels I grew up in. If this private suite is available reserve it and enjoy the hospitality. Thanks again Angelia. 
"
3652434,49654969,2015-10-05,25947898,Juncheng,Perfect house with perfect view! Angelica is so kind and easygoing. My parents really enjoy living in her house. The doggy is soooo cute!

Angelica has given the house Mexican decor, with Mexican hospitality to match ('mi casa es Su casa'). With yoghurt, beverages and fruit in the fridge, the tempur mattress and pillows, I thoroughly and Frida the dog, it all feels 5-star homely."
3652434,50897604,2015-10-15,23248462,Chris,Angelica and Randy were perfect hosts. They made me feel very welcome in their lovely home. Their top floor apartment was well appointed and all the little touches like breakfast items were extremely appreciated. I will definitely stay there again and cannot recommend them more highly.
3652434,51634965,2015-10-22,45036305,Steven,Angelica met us at the door when we arrived and showed us our wonderful suite. The refrigerator had some snacks and coffee that were nice for breakfast. Location was perfect for us. Walking distance to Fremont and Wallingford. 
3652434,52129019,2015-10-26,13992364,Glenna,Angelica was incredibly welcoming upon our arrival. We were in town for a busy wedding weekend and were able to come and go freely from the residence. Its a great location and the space was just perfect for what we needed. We definitely appreciated her hospitality and would recommend.

Angelica was flexible and communicative before and during the stay.  It was an absolute delight to stay with Angelica and Randy, and I would recommend their suite to anyone staying in Seattle."
3652434,56563135,2015-12-14,17429516,Patrick,"Nice space.  We were not able to take advantage of all of the amenities; this is a good place if you need to spread out.  Two large rooms, one good for relaxing or as an office.  Would recommend."
3652434,58072978,2015-12-31,51246498,Carlos,"We had a great experience. The loft  was well kept, beautiful views, very comfortable. We had a feeling of a home something that you do not get when you're go to a hotel. Well located nearby and water in the view of the city was great."
5578943,31249604,2015-05-03,31803349,Fuyue,It is awesome!! The room is downstairs and I used password to open or lock the door which is very convenient. The place is quite close to downtown and Sidney even provides a prepaid bus pass card. You have fruit and coffee in the room. I also love the shampoo and shower gel in fruit smell. Their dog is friendly and you could have a good rest at night.

5578943,31832995,2015-05-10,2065528,Oifan (Channie),"Gretchen & Sidney were the perfect hosts - thoughtful, there when you need them; unobtrusive when you don't. The studio was just as described and pictured. It looks newly renovated and is very attractively and thoughtfully done, from the cozy bed alcove to the kitchen cart containing everything you might need (dishes, hot water kettle, tea & coffee, fruit, etc.) The studio is located in a lovely, safe residential neighborhood without noise from buses or trucks. There is no commercial traffic at all. It is also convenient to buses to downtown."
5578943,32220270,2015-05-15,33221659,Jose Manuel,"Gretchen and Sidney are warm hosts. The neighborhood is beautiful and has some nice restaurants nearby on 34th Avenue and East Union.
I felt very comfortable and quite at home. The place itself is charming as well.

5578943,32550823,2015-05-19,30669293,Hilary,We loved this spot. It was in a great neighborhood and the space had everything we needed. We especially loved the kitchenette and the bus pass that they lent us. We were both extremely pleased with our stay here.
5578943,33449277,2015-05-28,31766419,Elena,"I stayed for 10 days, a longer term than the hosts previously offered, and my stay could not have been better. The space has a private entrance, is very clean, and has many amenities (including microwave and fridge) - and the hosts provide fresh fruit! The location is far enough from downtown to be peaceful and quite and close enough to downtown to be convenient; bus lines are nearby and will take you downtown within 15 minutes. Highly recommend! "
5578943,33998633,2015-06-03,31389404,Christine,Gretchen and Sidney made us feel very welcome during our stay at their home. On arrival we had some unexpected circumstances we had to deal with and they were very accommodating to our needs. We would definitely like to stay there again. The dwelling is exactly as pictured!
5578943,34244961,2015-06-06,29669494,Crystal,"Gretchen and Sidney did a great job. The room was clean and beautiful. The neighborhood was great. They even loaned me their bus pass, so I could take the bus downtown. A quick walk to the bus stop three blocks away. Thanks so much!"
5578943,34639501,2015-06-10,32079432,Fritz,"I had an excellent time at Gretchen & Sidney's house, I was there for four nights. The room looked exactly like the picutre, it was also quiet, clean and comfortable. The street was quiet and I took the bus to downtown everyday and the bus stop was about a block away. They provided a free bus pass which eased that whole process so much. Sidney and Gretchen both said hi to me when I arrived which I really appreciate and Sidney even got me a fan to cool down the room when it got warm from the outside heat. The fan did the trick wonderfully. I highly recommend their private room for others and for myself!"
5578943,34954808,2015-06-14,7427990,Bailey,Gretchen and Sidney's place was gorgeous and in a great location! They went above and beyond to make sure everything was provided - including a bus pass and fresh fruit! They were communicative and flexible. I would highly recommend this listing!
5578943,35310098,2015-06-17,32855356,Mike,Was a great place to stay very comfortable and accommodating. After we left we realized we had forgotten something and they held it for us and made themselves available for us to pick it is early in the morning on our way back through. I would recommend this place.
5578943,36015450,2015-06-24,32017107,Brenda,"Gretchen and Sidney were wonderful hosts.  Gretchen greeted me upon arrival although it was very late and I enjoyed visiting with her briefly about some of Seattle's places of interest.  I had a lovely time visiting with Sidney before leaving.  They made sure that I knew they were available if I had any questions or needed anything, but they did not intrude on my stay.  I spent most of my time with family members who live in Seattle so I didn't have any questions about the area but I know they would have been very helpful.
The studio was exactly as described, very roomy for a studio and comfortable.  The bathroom was large, clean and fixtures were up to date. Towels were bright white and plentiful and the studio was well stocked with paper goods.  The bed was comfortable and the little kitchenette was stocked with dishes, tea, coffee, fruit and oatmeal.  There is a pot for heating water, a microwave and small refrigerator so preparing light meals is certainly possible.  I took advantage of this for breakfast but ate out for other meals since there are so many wonderful restaurants in Seattle.  You can hear Gretchen, Sidney and their sweet dog Garbo walking above you but keep in mind this is their house and I found it less disturbing than the rowdy neighbors I had recently when I stayed in a luxury hotel. 
The neighborhood was quiet and well kept and the house is conveniently located just a few blocks from the bus stops.  You do need to be prepared to walk up and down hills because Seattle is a very hilly city.
I did rent a car and there was space to park it in front of the house but a car isn't necessary unless you plan on some excursions out of town.  Gretchen and Sidney prepared a wonderful notebook with helpful information and stocked the room with travel brochures and bus schedules.  
This was my first experience with airbnb and I would highly recommend it.  I also highly recommend the Madrona Studio.  If I make it back to Seattle, the Madrona Studio will be my first pick for accommodations.  I'm sure I will have to book it early though as I'm confident the Madrona Studio will not be vacant often."
5578943,36870046,2015-07-02,19598926,Jordan,Gretchen and Sydney are great hosts! They were always available if we needed anything and were truly interested in making our stay great. The neighborhood is nice and is a quick walk to several bus stops. The bus pass was awesome to use and made traveling the city a breeze. My husband and I stayed for a week and loved this place! 
5578943,37159600,2015-07-05,32452308,Billy,"Gretchen and Sidney were there to greet me and made sure I was comfortable with the accommodations.  They gave me helpful tips in getting around the city and provided a bus pass too.  The studio was super clean and stocked with all the amenities needed.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  After a long bike ride, I actually felt so comfortable that I had a wonderful afternoon nap.  I truly felt like I was on vacation at their studio."
5578943,37680428,2015-07-09,18816675,Jess,Lovely studio with all the comforts of home! Sid and Gretchen were wonderful hosts and made getting in and out of the apartment super easy. We loved the assortment of teas for guests and the wonderful generosity of providing a bus pass which came in handy. I would definitely stay again and highly recommend the studio. The neighborhood is adorable with easy access to downtown and close to some neighborhood gems like Madrona Park. 
5578943,38385346,2015-07-15,32551148,Jesus,"This was my first AirBnB experience. Gretchen and Sidney were fantastic hosts and very accommodating. There was an initial hiccup in booking dates, but immediately fixed through effective communication. The space was great for my boyfriend and I. Although most of our day was spent exploring the beautiful city of Seattle, coming back to the room at night felt very homey.  I would highly recommend this booking and hope to visit again. The neighborhood felt very safe and provided access to lot of local shops to visit. "
5578943,39001475,2015-07-20,1583147,Curtis,Beautiful place to stay and very tentive to our needs. Good conversations and great location to us to visit grandkids.
5578943,39435301,2015-07-23,38122564,Robert,"Let me start by saying this is my first air bnb experience, but it has already spoiled me for hotels. Sid was a very gracious host  and I don't know how he could have improved my experience. The  room is very nice with a spotless large bathroom. The garden in the back is whimsically beautiful, and the location is perfect for those who want easy access to downtown without being right in it. He even provided me with an orca card for the bus so I didn't have to spend a dime on transportation while there.  Highly recommended!"
5578943,39919704,2015-07-27,26825200,Stephanie,"This suite was exactly as described. Great for those looking for an authentic neighbourhood experience, with easy transit access to the city's core. We absolutely loved Madrona and found quite a great selection of places to eat. Sid was extremely accommodating and made sure that we had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. Oatmeal, fruit, coffee and tea was provided and also a preloaded transit card for our use, which we found incredibly generous and helpful! We would definitely stay here again."
5578943,40584940,2015-08-01,4796145,Greg,The studio was excellent and as advertised. A good base for exploring Seattle. Sidney was friendly and left us some excellent fruit. I would stay here again.
5578943,41934911,2015-08-10,32044867,Kathleen,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and it completely exceeded our expectations!  Sidney was a great host (we were sad that we couldn't have met Gretchen)!  From the moment that we arrived, we felt like we were at home.  All of the amenities that one would expect from a five-star hotel were provided.  And what a nice, cozy place to stay!  Very clean too!  The neighborhood was safe and quiet - which really helped us relax during our vacation.  And it was very kind of Sidney to save us a parking spot right out front!  We can't wait to go back to Seattle and stay over again!"
5578943,42389696,2015-08-13,26117259,Faith,"Excellent hosting! Gretchen and Sidney did an absolute amazing job at making us feel welcomed at their home. It was a home away from home. Their space was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. It is located in a quiet neighborhood was from the busy city, but very convenient to get to. Everything was great, very clean and great accommodations. "
5578943,43392127,2015-08-19,38406580,Elizabeth,"I stayed here with 1 other person, and we felt so welcome and comfortable! Their little studio is clean, private, wonderfully decorated, well located, and definitely even better than staying at a hotel. They even left some tomatoes in the fridge from their garden for us to enjoy. We had such a great time here, and highly recommend. Sidney and Garbo are also just so friendly and wonderful. We didn't get to meet Gretchen as she was out on a trip, but she's probably wonderful too :) "
5578943,45245681,2015-09-01,33672566,Donovan,"The place was clean and well kept, felt like they had thought of most everything one might expect to have available in a hotel. They even went above and beyond and helped pre-childproof the room with safety covers on the outlets knowing we had a toddler coming.  Sidney and Gretchen are kind hosts who are great to chat with if you have the time.  The neighborhood feels like a community with some good history to it, the hills are no joke so be prepared to warm of the calves.  Our favorite place to eat in walking distance was Hi-spot for breakfast and Thai place a couple doors down was also legit. "
5578943,46278734,2015-09-09,22201834,Elizabeth,"We absolutely adored our time in Seattle at Gretchen & Sidney's cozy studio. They provided everything we needed and then some, and were very helpful with providing suggestions of places to eat and go. We definitely had a hard time leaving and would love to return!"
5578943,46720077,2015-09-13,20623688,Alexandra,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Gretchen and Sidney's for our belated honeymoon. The space was cozy and we enjoyed being in the quiet neighborhood to relax in the evenings. We felt welcome and right at home! It was a quick walk to the bus stations to take downtown, but there were also some great restaurants in the neighborhood within easy walking distance. Oh, and a Molly Moon's Homemade Ice Cream location within a couple blocks. :) We loved our stay here and would highly recommend!"
5578943,47973175,2015-09-22,38855904,Brenda,"We absolutely LOVED our stay! The studio looked EXACTLY like the photos. Everything was so clean and organized. The studio had everything you could possibly need. It's location is close to downtown and more importantly close to really tasty local spots to eat. Gretchen was so sweet and helpful! She was even great to text over the weekend to ask for suggestions on where to go. Everything suggestion was spot on so I instantly trusted her judgement. I wouldn't change anything about our experience and I would hands down come back and stay here when we return to Seattle. The neighborhood is quiet (which I loved) clean, and you instantly feel safe being there. I woks recommend their home to anyone coming to visit. Thank you for an awesome stay! "
5578943,48395730,2015-09-26,39440066,Shivani,"We had a wonderful stay at Gretchen and Sidney's studio flat in Madrona. A beautiful neighbourhood and a great base from which to explore the rest of Seattle. Not far from downtown (bus and taxi will get your there) but equally quiet and homely. Our hosts were lovely and had set up the studio for us so well with towels, toiletries and fresh fruit. It was comfy and quaint. We really liked the books that we could dip into on a quiet night. I would definitely recommend this place! "
5578943,51717601,2015-10-24,13443724,Alexandra,"A wonderful place to stay with wonderful hosts!! Gretchen and Sidney were incredibly warm and welcoming, and were always willing to help!

The bus card they provided made getting around super easy too!! Thank you so much for hosting me!"
5578943,53004503,2015-11-03,9727792,Abby,"Our stay with Gretchen and Sidney could not have been more perfect! Their adorable home in Madrona was the perfect location for our trip. It was easy to walk and catch the bus (they even provided a free buss pass!), and there was also tons to do in the neighborhood! Gretchen and Sidney were very friendly, and provided a welcome book as well as answered any questions we had about the city. The apartment was even better than I expected. There was plenty of room for the two of us, and the bathroom was super spacious! The apartment has a code entry, so we were able to come and go as we pleased without disturbing the rest of the home. I highly recommend staying here for your next Seattle trip. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat! "
5578943,53692897,2015-11-11,16250122,Bonnie,"Wow, Gretchen has a black belt in communication; I've never met a more responsive and helpful host. The room is located on the ground and check-in was extremely easy with an electric keypad. The heated tiles and the nook inside made my stay feel comfortable and safe. Not to mention, the house is located 10-15 minutes from almost everything (Downtown, Fremont/Wallingford, Pioneer Square). 10/10 experience! "

5578943,56405432,2015-12-13,18756009,Ashley,"Gretchen & Sidney's place has been my favorite Airbnb experience to date! Their home was incredibly cozy and embodied everything I was looking for and more. Gretchen was sure to make me feel welcome and comfortable upon my arrival. Their place was full of thoughtful amenities to make me feel perfectly at home. I even took notes on how I can incorporate the feel of their abode in my own home! I was working long hours in Seattle during my stay, so when I came back at night I was exhausted. Their place was the perfect spot to unwind. Located in quiet, beautiful and convenient Madrona, everything was perfect - absolutely perfect! Thank you Gretchen & Sidney! I'll be sure to book again!"

Overall a very good experience, especially like the private entrance. 
The location is about 5 blocks away from Capital Hill, 5 dollar Uber ride. "
1970725,28433091,2015-03-23,10123627,Wendy,"My stay at Mark's went without a hitch. I arrived after midnight and had concerns about finding nearby parking and the entry, as well as gaining entry. Mark's directions (which included a photo of the front door from the street) and assurance of on-street parking were right on. He was responsive to all my inquiries. He made simple arrangements for the key and there was ample lighting when I arrived. The room was warm, dry and clean with a feeling of security. I had all the amenities I needed and the space was exactly as described. 
The location was quiet yet close to restaurants  and other downtown spots. 
I recommend Mark's place without any hesitation. 
"
1970725,29863792,2015-04-13,1501775,Craighton,"Mark's place is really perfect for what I needed. I was in town for a coffee trade show, and needed to come and go at odd hours, and the private entrance made that really easy. The actual space is immaculate—modern, clean, tasteful, appointed just the right amount, and just the right size. I loved it. Mark also went the extra mile by accepting packages for me a week ahead of time, and putting them in the room for me to get. How nice is that?! Great neighborhood, great place, great dude—A+++++++ would stay again."
1970725,30419218,2015-04-21,30883830,Justin,"Mark was a great host and his space was equally awesome! I told him this was our first time in Seattle and he periodically checked in with us to see if we needed anything or were looking for suggestions in the area.

The bathroom was also clean and had a nice large soaking tub / shower combo.  The wi-fi was fast, which is, of course, always important! ;)  Mark also checked in with me a few times over the stay to make sure I was doing fine and didn't have any questions.  Great stay!"

I loved the Trader Joe's grocery option. The room was clean and felt very private from the rest of the house thanks to the separate entry and patio. The overall vibe was relaxed and classy. Staying here was a true vacation. Mark was a great host, reachable and communicative. I'll be reserving this room the next time I'm in Capitol Hill! "

Comfy bed, hooks/hangers for clothes, a spacious shower, and a decent amount of natural light.
Also, Mark was very accommodating with our arrival time. 
I would definitely stay here again!"

My plans changed so I could no longer go, but my friend knew someone who could take my place, and Mark was very accommodating to this slight change in who his guests would be.  My friend says that it was really great, exactly as pictured, clean and easy to find.  I am told Mark was a great host, and that Mark even checked in several times to make sure my friends' stay was good."
1970725,40632141,2015-08-01,4266703,Nadya,"We stayed at Mark's studio for 2 nights in July. It's conveniently located (20-30 mins walk from the centre or a very short ride). Studio is nice and cosy, with lovely outdoor area and some flowers. We loved minimalistic colours and style a lot

Communication with Mark was easy and he was very helpful. We arrived late and Mark arranged keys for us, so that was very convenient. We followed his advice and visited a local pub which we enjoyed at lot after a very very very long flight from australia:)"
1970725,41126025,2015-08-04,38100557,Madeline,"Great room, wonderful experience!  Nice walk-able neighborhood with lots of local joints for coffee and food.  Mark was easy to communicate with and responsive!  "
1970725,41745469,2015-08-09,17292742,Sean,"We had a great time staying at Mark's place. It's a great location, and all the sights and fun areas of Capitol Hill are withing walking distance or a short bus ride away. 

Mark made us feel very welcomed, checking in to make sure we had everything we needed and he was very quick and responsive during the whole trip, even offering suggestions on places to eat.

The room is comfortable and has the amenities you'll need.  I would definitely stay again!"
1970725,44652088,2015-08-28,36440550,Fabrice,"The room and the bathroom were absolutely perfect, and it really feels like having your own apartment in Seattle. The neighbourhood is also very nice, and very well situated. The few recommendations Mark gave me were very enjoyable."
1970725,45080445,2015-08-31,13621588,Chen,My friend and I went to Seattle over weekend and stayed at Mark's place. The studio is very cozy and close to downtown. Neighborhood is safe and restaurants/bars/supermarkets are just a few blocks away from the house. Mark kept checking with us and making sure we stay conveniently. We didn't get a chance to meet him but we went to Skillet for brunch as he suggested. Food there were delicious. I had the burger with bacon jelly which was very tasty. Must give a try but remember to make a reservation! Our brunch was at 10:30am so Mark helped us coordinate with the cleaner and we could check out before noon time. Totally recommend to stay here if you visit and want some privacy.
1970725,45591824,2015-09-04,41113700,Amy,Didn't meet him personally but he was frequently in touch. Well described accommodations and accurately located. Would highly recommend. 
1970725,46147751,2015-09-08,13022489,Dana,"Great room and location in Seattle. The room was clean and just as stated in the listing. Mark was very accommodating to my friend and I, thank you for your kindness!"
1970725,46906288,2015-09-14,39762939,Eddy,"First time Airbnb user for both Ronda and I and it was perfect. Room was as described and Mark was very gracious. Not being very social media attentive, we missed a couple of messages from Mark. He was only trying to make the stay better. Centrally located, close to the major bus routes, and parking availability make this a perfect Seattle home base. The neighborhood is quiet, comfortable, and the folks living there are all very nice and helpful. Mark's place is close to a Trader Joe's, Co-op, and a cool coffee shop called Tougo's. 
We basically parked the car, downloaded the local bus/transit app, and stayed on the go. We had a great time and Mark's place was a big part of the success."
1970725,47838023,2015-09-21,22125775,Mark,"Mark made us feel very welcome - the room was immaculately clean, he was very responsive, and the room looked just as pictured.  The location is great at the top of Capitol Hill, and there's not much more that you could ask for! "
1970725,48887697,2015-09-29,40550571,Caroline,This was a great place. Room was clean and exactly as advertised. Easy to walk to Capitol Hill restaurants and shops and only a bit longer to walk all the way downtown. Mark was very helpful and hospitable. Definitely reccomend
1970725,50530561,2015-10-12,45065575,Vy,"Mark was a gracious host and very prompt with replying to all our messages. Since our flight got in at 9am, I had asked Mark of there was a possibility of checking in early. Luckily, he was able to accommodate us that morning. 

The listing looked like the pictures and was nicely decorated with a minimalis, cozy feel. If I wasn't such a water conservationist, I would've lived in that gorgeous bathtub! The mattress was surprisingly comfortable and the comforter kept us rather warm. We kept the windows open throughout the night and the area was relatively quiet, minus the few people coming home from the bars. 

We rented a car for our trip to Mt. Rainier, and had no issue with parking except our first morning. We drove around the area a couple of times, until we found a spot a block away. I think it was mostly due to commuters coming in and parking for the work day; there was plentiful parking that night and the weekend. It was a very convenient location; we were 10-15 min walking distance from the bars and restaurants of Capitol Hill and a 10 mintue drive to Pikes. 

Mike was a lovely host and we really appreciated him for letting us borrow his umbrella - saved us from a good soak! We definitely would come back!  
"
1970725,50956383,2015-10-16,4525987,P.,"This place is great. It was the perfect size and really centrally located. The design was modern and the bed was really comfortable. The only thing I'd caution a potential traveler about is that there's a fair amount of pedestrian traffic that goes past, even at night. If you're a very light sleeper, you might get woken up."
1970725,51474445,2015-10-20,69452,Paula,"Never met Mark, yet he and I texted the day before and throughout the trip.  The place was a little oasis in a the big bad city of Seattle (bad in an awesome way)!  Room is as it appears:  bed is very comfortable from mattress to comforter and the bathroom is modern and spacious (and I just love it when the host provides all the toiletries so you don't have to worry about forgetting them).  Wifi was quick and consistent.  Close to Trader Joe's and most everything else you'd need.  Great morning at Little Oddfellow which is now in Elliot Bookstore which is walking distance from location."
1724849,9018795,2013-12-02,836603,Karen,"Brittany's apartment is in a fantastic location and was very comfortable for our stay. It was quite clean and looks very nice. 

Brittany was a great host in terms of telling us everything we need to know about how to access the building/apartment and where to find towels, laundry, etc. The building concierge is 24 hours and was very friendly to us as guests - they were happy to give directions to different things in the building. The amenities in the building may be the best in the city.

The one thing I would highlight to pay attention to is that the apartment is listed as ""pet friendly"". If you have animal allergies, the traces of pet hair may trigger a few sniffles. 

Would stay here again on another trip to Seattle. :)"
1724849,9080801,2013-12-05,3955962,Veronica,Great location for many Seattle events! Nice building and apartment. Brittany  is very responsive to any problems and willing to fix.
1724849,9114348,2013-12-08,975693,Michelle,"Brittany's place is awesome. The layout is great and it's bigger than it looks in the pictures. Brittany was very responsive and made it very easy and carefree from key pick up to drop off. The apartment is right downtown near public transit, the market, the waterfront, and the museum. It's impossible to be without something to do in this area! I highly recommend Brittany's place."
1724849,9191089,2013-12-12,1117946,Rosie,"Brittany's place was great. Definitely a comfortable space for 2 and you could squeeze in a third person if necessary. LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! This place is literally in the middle of all the happening places in Seattle, Pike's Public Market, transportation, Ferris Wheel, a 25 minute walk to the space needle. Across the street from Seattle Art Museum. It was perfect. Check in/out was super easy. The apartment is well appointed and I would definitely stay again. 

The only thing I would highlight (as another reviewer has said) this is a pet friendly place, meaning the owner has a cat. Even though the cat was not there, inevitably there was cat hair - so if you're allergic this is not the place for you. That was not a problem for us thankfully.  "
1724849,9346614,2013-12-23,444482,Tom,"Excellent apartment, all as described.  Would not hesitate to book again on a future visit to Seattle."
1724849,9641357,2014-01-04,2829795,Elodie,"Nous avons passé un très agréable séjour à Seattle chez Brittany qui a un appartement vraiment agréable et idéalement situé, en plein coeur de downtown, à proximité de tous les sites culturels de la ville.
Brittany a très bien organisé notre venue en nous donnant toutes les instructions nécessaires. 
Encore merci pour cet accueil.

"
1724849,9967432,2014-01-21,2179720,Sandeep,My fiance and I visited Seattle for the long weekend and this place was absolutely perfect for us. It was my first time using Airbnb and Brittany was very helpful in helping me learn how it all works.  It was our first time in Seattle and this place was close to everything including all the touristy stuff and tons of restaurants/bars. Pickup and drop off was easy and the flexible check in/checkout time was helpful.  I would most definitely stay at Brittany's apartment again.
1724849,12852123,2014-05-12,13701370,Rachel,"Seriously, prime location! I used to live in Seattle and my boyfriend and I were visiting for a weekend and couldn't have asked for a better spot. The apartment is right across from SAM (art museum) that's a must see and a few blocks from pike place market. Highly recommended."
1724849,12954938,2014-05-15,14320956,Song,"Brittany's apt is in a great location in downtown Seattle! Main local attractions are all in minuts walk! The apt is very clean and quiet, you wont be worried about any distraction or disturbance by the traffic. Me and my wife had really enjoyed our stay in Brittany's place!"
1724849,13041818,2014-05-18,13561619,Allison,"We really hit the jackpot with this apartment. Prior to arriving, Brittany sent me a detailed message with instructions that answered any questions we might have had. Brittany provided us with a beautiful and more importantly clean space.The location is ideal if you're sight-seeing with all the majors spots within walking distance. 

In terms of the apartment, the security of the building is great. When we arrived there was a small hiccup with getting the key but Brittany was responsive and we got the key within 10 minutes of arriving.The laundry was a huge plus as we could wash out clothes mid-trip.

This place is a great value! We would definitely stay again."
1724849,22220611,2014-11-01,20182147,Sean,"Brittany's place was great! Couldn't ask for a better location or more fun place to launch your adventures into Seattle from. Her apt was very clean and had a great view! Thanks Brittany, hope to be back soon!"
7369,3721,2009-06-07,20217,Tim,"I was staying with Shireen for a weekend and my stay was way better than everything I initally expected. She was really nice and gentle, helping me with any sort of question to the city. Her home is absolutely tidy and cozy. I could stay on a bed in the living room which was comfortable. From the balcony you have a nice view on downtown. And I have never seen such a calm dog! The location is awesome as you need to walk only a few minutes to downtown.
I had a perfect stay in Seattle. Thanks again and sorry that it took me a while to leave this review!"
7369,4700,2009-06-28,21786,Kristin,Shireen was a great hostess and really understanding of my up in the air schedule. Her greyhound is a wonderful dog and her place is really nice. Located in a great area of Seattle with downtown a quick walk away.
7369,9635,2009-09-10,19047,Doug,I stayed at Shireen's place for 5 days this past week and had a great stay. Her place is centrally located easy walk to Pike Place Market and access to buses etc. I would recommend her place and next time I am in Seattle will look to stay there again.
7369,15370,2009-10-27,47540,Mario,"I was staying at Shireen' place for 4 nights and I had a pleasant stay.
Located in a quiet area and very close to downtown, the place is very, very clean, very well decorated, the bed is excellent (firm), the dog is super nice and super quiet, the shower works great, and the balcony is sweet, with a great view of downtown. Shireen is a great host, very helpful.  I will try to use her place again for my next trips to Seattle."
7369,18308,2009-11-25,53149,Andrew,"I am very happy to have stayed with Shireen. I found her place comfortable in every way, and Shireen herself is a warm, friendly and relaxed host. Next time will stay for longer! "
7369,24963,2010-01-27,72985,Farida And Randal,"Shireen's apartment is a great place to relax in the middle of Capital Hill area. I enjoyed our talks and the simple access to get in and out of the building. Margo, the geyhound is such a sweetheart. Clean, quiet gentle dog."
7369,25670,2010-02-07,76840,Sarah,Shireen was so warm and welcoming!  The pull-out bed was quite comfy and the location was perfect.  Margo the greyhound is sweet and gentle and the perfect greeter.  Highly recommended!

7369,58458,2010-06-28,136698,Jason,"Shireen was a fantastic host! Her place is immaculate and organized. She volunteered a lot of information about good local places to visit, and how to get there. She also made sure the fold-out bed was always ready for me, even when I came back at odd hours.

Note that if you must have your own room, this isn't the place for you: the bed folds out from her sofa in the living room.

Margo, her retired greyhound, is such a sweetheart. Not once did Margo bark or bother me, and she was very loving.

Thanks Shireen, I would love to visit again sometime!"
7369,60070,2010-07-02,129500,Gemma,"I only stayed one night with Shireen as I was flying in to Seattle briefly for work. Shireen is great. Super friendly and welcoming and a really interesting person to talk to. It was a real pleasure meeting her and I hope to stay in touch. The apartment is cute, clean and spacious. Decent bathrooms and showers are really important to me as a guest and Shireens facilities are awesome. I was comfy, well looked after and in great company. Thanks so much Shireen. "
7369,63258,2010-07-10,26068,Kimi,"Shireen was able to accommodate my reservation on such short notice- and I totally scored. It was a bit difficult for me to find her building at night, but once I was in everything was great. The space is clean, organized and beautifully decorated.  For the price, location, space and intentional host you can't beat it!"
7369,69108,2010-07-25,176337,David,Staying with Shareen was great. She strikes a good balance between being engaged and giving space. Here place is also in a great location in Seattle.
7369,74793,2010-08-06,60273,Martha,"Shireen's place is absolutely perfect for the price. I couldn't have asked for more convenient, easy, or flexible accommodations for my purposes--a quick one night stay on my way through town. Shireen is kind and friendly but very respectful. I appreciated her local's advice and general helpfulness."
7369,75081,2010-08-07,178611,Grant,"This is is truely the best place to stay in downtown Seattle. Not only is Shireen a great hostess but her apartment is beautiful. I plan to stay there sometime in the future if she will have me, which I think she will. As a self contained traveler I always bring my own sleeping sheet and towel which she seemed to appreciate. "
7369,77947,2010-08-13,190909,Kris,"$35?!  I couldn't have asked for more.  Comfy bed, great location and a more than helpful host.   Shireen makes coming and going easy and has great tips for making the most of your stay in Seattle or just let's you do your own thing.  Classy, friendly gal."
7369,89721,2010-09-03,175445,Alissa,"Shireen was very accommodating and her apartment is pleasant and clean. I stayed just one night, and was able to easily walk downtown and take the train to the airport the next day."

7369,239923,2011-04-25,403577,Erica,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Shireen for just one night.  Her apartment is cozy and quiet, and the pull-out sofa is pretty comfy!  Shireen is really personable and professional.  She helped us get a sense of the surrounding neighborhoods and went the extra mile in looking up directions and bus schedules to the Amtrak station so we wouldn't miss our morning train!  Thanks so much, Shireen and Margo!"

7369,348191,2011-07-02,598706,Anand,"The location is fine, but hard to get a good night's sleep. You get woken up before 8 am by sounds of breakfast. Don't expect much privacy."
7369,353995,2011-07-05,658864,M Justin,"Shireen is a gracious host, friendly, accommodating, and full of good information; her place is clean, cozy, and conveniently located; and her dog is very chill, and did not bark once.  Highest rating!"

Feel free to ask her anything about Seattle or directions to a point of interest and she will be sure to inform you from the best perspective. Margo  (her dog) was very well behaved and i would love to stay another night there anytime.
7369,388185,2011-07-21,544617,Chris,"Once again Shireen was a life saver, booked her last minute (again) and was pleased to stay in her home. She is very knowledgeable of the area so feel free to ask her anything."

7369,407148,2011-07-30,278102,Brooke,"I enjoyed my stay in Seattle and was glad I used Airbnb for the stay.  It's a good feeling my monies went to Shireen versus some Paris Hilton.  It was great weather and I wish I had more time to hang out on her cute outdoor patio. 

Shireen and her dog were nice.  She is particular about how she likes things set up and it's important to read the house rules where most but not all rules are listed.   

I was there for a conference and was downtown for a large majority of the time.  The neighborhood is great, safe and it's about 6 blocks or so to get downtown.  I walked most everywhere.  Across the street I discovered Sushi Maki, a great hole-in-the-wall sushi spot to get some of the best rolls I have ever had! Also, there was a 24 hour Fitness not too far away that I also walked to.  

I hope to come back to Seattle sometime soon!"
7369,418051,2011-08-03,850249,Colleen,"Shireen's apartment was very comfortable and in the perfect location—walkable to lots of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, as well as downtown.

Shireen is very businesslike and gives her guests plenty of space & privacy. Her dog is amazingly awesome, and friendly.
All in all, an excellent stay."
7369,696115,2011-11-06,665016,Vivian,"All the reviews were on point about Shireen and her place! This place is extremely convenient to travel throughout Seattle.

Thanks so much, Shireen!"

1520449,19120878,2014-09-07,15535064,Sarah,"The IO House is amazing! I stayed there for 12 weeks while doing a summer internship, and it was one of my best decisions during my time in Seattle. The location is convenient for grabbing groceries, getting good eats, and visiting awesome bars - basically anything you'd ever want is in walking distance. Living in the IO House, you'll never be at a loss for good company. I've had unforgettable conversations about technology, cultural differences, and life in general. The house manager is extremely accommodating, and if a problem ever arises, you can rest assured it will be handled in an extremely timely manner. (I once mentioned how the shower curtain looked kinda grodey, and it was changed the next day.) All in all, amazing location and great company!"
1520449,22136348,2014-10-31,13527726,Casey,"This house is a cool place to join the Seattle community. The location is really good and everyone in the house is extremely nice.

I had a really fantastic 1 week (email hidden) House ! Everyone was so nice and friendly, and although it was the first time in Seattle, and the first time for me to use Airbnb, I really felt like at home. I'd recommend staying here to everyone, especially if you are looking to meet new enthusiastic people. The room was nice, and I had a very pleasant sleep."
5061411,28712138,2015-03-29,6073582,Courtney,"Gorgeous! The house was immaculately decorated, modern, and in a great area.  Literally steps from the Fremont troll, cute boutiques, delicious restaurants, and great coffee shops. My friends and I had a wonderful time staying here and would highly recommend this apartment. We didn't get a chance to cook because we were busy checking out the neighborhood eats but the kitchen is super modern and we would have loved to take advantage of it. Seth was also incredibly helpful and responsive throughout our entire stay. We look forward to coming back!"
5061411,29197395,2015-04-05,28594542,Paul,"Seth's house was great. Perfect place to relax after a long day.  The house was clean and ready for us when we arrived.  The next time I'm in Seattle, I will definitely try to stay at one of Seth's houses."

7036707,39529952,2015-07-24,12339195,Lisa,"Kim was an awesome host! I honestly had a great time staying here! 

The kitchen is very convenient for long stays and if you don't like eating out much. There is also a Trader Joes 3 mins away (driving).

The bed was extremely comfortable and whenever I had a question or problem my hosts were very attentive! 

I would recommend this stay to anyone and maybe might event be back myself! :) thank you Kim! "
7036707,39803120,2015-07-26,2246005,Jesse,The cottage was lovely and very clean with plenty of amenities. The hosts made us feel very at home and the great location was a plus! Would definitely stay here again. 
7036707,40353156,2015-07-30,29216610,Cathy,"Kim and Chris greeted us with open arms, just like family! Kim's cottage was well equipped with all we needed. Kim helped with all our questions and was well educated about (email hidden)ey made up a book with FAQ and it was helpful to have.  I can't thank her enough for the great time we had there. Hope to stay there again soon. Thank you so much Kim :)"
7036707,40775568,2015-08-02,37100757,Karen,"We loved everything about our stay at the Madison Valley Garden Cottage.  The studio is lovely~ very clean, absolutely comfortable, with an eclectic decor that is interesting and inviting.  We felt very ""at home.""  The bedding and towels were plush.  There were lots of extras- a small bottle of wine, chilled water, snack-sized cheese, and some ground coffee.   The kitchenette is well-equipped.  Kim and Rachel graciously provided extra table ware to make it possible for us to host a picnic dinner.  We used the grill provided and enjoyed the garden setting, which is beautiful.  The cottage is within walking distance of many restaurants and a neighborhood park.  We found a great breakfast spot two blocks from the cottage.  The residential area around the cottage provided a quiet neighborhood for my morning walk- a big ""plus"" for me.  Kim and Rachel were very accomodating hosts without being intrusive.  We needed extra instructions (they provided their phone number for questions/help) to initially find the cottage.  After getting our bearings, however, we realized it is actually very easy to locate.  We would highly recommend this experience to anyone looking for a quiet, private spot to relax.   "
7036707,41392029,2015-08-07,28174303,Linsey,"Kim and Rachel were fabulous hosts.  The Garden Cottage was delightful, clean and had everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.    the garden was beautiful and the porThe neighborhood is nice, close to restaurants and shopping and a beautiful park, also an easy place to get the bus downtown.  

We were very pleased with our stay and would recommend the Madison Valley Garden Cottage to anyone!"
7036707,41668448,2015-08-08,4968124,Christine,"We enjoyed our stay at Madison Valley Garden.  Very convenient location for bus and restaurants, quiet, comfortable for sleeping, peaceful garden for relaxing, welcoming hosts.  "
7036707,42149383,2015-08-11,2886364,Galen,"Kim and Rachel were wonderfully accommodating. I had to change my reservation and there were no issues as they were home to meet me when I arrived in the late evening. 

The cottage is located in a safe neighborhood within easy walking distance to restaurants, parks, and a quick bus ride from the Madison Park Beach. 

The cottage itself was clean and well lit with all the essentials to cook small meals. For the price, this is an unbeatable spot away from Downtown and in a great location. "
7036707,42875261,2015-08-16,28567654,Jeremy,"This was a great place to stay!  everything you really need with a little more.  Mini fridge, shower, towels, toiletries, TV, Wifi, portable convection top etc.!    Really close to the main bus routes.  There was water, some mixers and a cute mini champagne bottle.  A few cheeses to comment.     When booking I thought this was whole home private, but they live in the house and converted their garage to a studio/apartment.   I would totally live there but wish I knew because I didn't  feel comfortable being able to bring anyone over. That's it!  All in all a great experience with great and fast replies.  There's a Teriyaki takeout place close and a cute cafe if you get there to early, all a stones throw away.   Things get really busy a mile or two away, which is perfect if you want to feel like a local and head out to be a tourist!  It was fun and great.  They are great hosts and I'm glad everything went so smoothly because it's stressful using bnb sometimes.  They'll leave you not stressed and you'll like what you picked."
7036707,43675025,2015-08-21,40083810,Fred,"Rachel and Kim were friendly and inviting. Their attention to small details was both enjoyable and thoughtful. The location was good since it was close to eateries and a small market. Additionally the Japanese garden and Seattle Arboretum are within a short walking distance. Also it was less than a five minute walk to the bus stop that had a straight route to Pike Market.  Once at Pike Market it is just a short walk to the transition hub which made it easy to get to other points of interest in Seattle. 

The cottage also had a very inviting garden to sit and relax in. Overall a very nice stay. If given the opportunity we would gladly stay again. "
7036707,43947510,2015-08-23,15906549,Christopher,"Kim met use at the drive and gave us a thorough tour of the apartment. They've stocked it well, no need went unmet. Our past experiences with Murphy beds had us a little worried but we were pleasantly surprised at how comfortable it was. The porch faces a lovely garden space shaded by a large fruit tree. On street parking wasn't a problem. A wonderful place centrally located to everything. Thank you."
7036707,44313567,2015-08-25,23090729,Daniel,"Kim and Rachel met me at the cottage when I arrived, a little later than expected.  They were very friendly, showed me around the well-appointed abode, and gave me some tips on getting around Seattle."
7036707,44777701,2015-08-29,36796415,Julia,Great place to stay while we went sight seeing in Seattle! About a 30min bus ride straight to downtown.
7036707,46275809,2015-09-09,36384016,Kevin,"My wife and I stayed here for exactly one week. The studio is located on a fairly busy street in an older residential area conveniently located a couple of blocks to buses, shops, stores, and a bar or two. Parking was not a problem, but limited.

The hosts are friendly, attentive and easy going. They were available via text quickly for any concern we had. It's apparent the hosts are conscientious about guests comfort and privacy. The studio is very clean and efficient with hardwood floors. The studio faces a backyard with trees and lush vegetation of different varieties making it very peaceful and private.

The studio was created from ""part"" of a ""detached"" garage which is located at the end of a typical older narrow driveway that runs down past main house. At the end of the driveway, a walkway goes between the end of the main house and the studio. Motion lights are strategically placed to light your way to and from the unit during dark hours. 

The entry to the studio is french doors from the backyard side which makes this studio quite private. During the day we'd open out the french doors to the wood deck with the lush private backyard beyond. This made the main 12' x 11' room with the murphy bed more open and airy while still being private. 

The queen size murphy bed was remarkably comfortable seeing as how my wife and I are accustomed to a king size bed. FYI, I am 6'1"" / 265 lbs and my wife 5'7"" medium size. There is a nice sized flat screen tv swivel mounted on the wall with a small table and chair directly below it. Internet reception was good and plenty of tv stations.

If you are my size ""most everything"" will be a bit small for you including the 3' x 11' bathroom which you enter from the center to the pedestal sink with the toilet tucked in to the left and small shower stall to the right. No picking up any dropped soap in this shower for the big guys.

The kitchen area is small but efficient with sink, microwave, toaster oven, hot plate, small refrigerator and a folding table mounted on the wall opposite the sink. Most everything needed for cooking was there. Kitchen is about 6' wide x 5' deep.

The 6' x 14'ish wooden deck overlooking the backyard has a small table and a couple folding chairs for hanging out. There is also a BBQ which we did not use during our 1 week stay."
7036707,47253632,2015-09-17,37840744,Rick,"We cannot say enough about how welcomed we felt upon arrival. The Cottage and setting are an oasis of peace just minutes away from great amenities. 

Details like cream for your morning coffee in the fridge, also sorts of local travel information and detailed instructions on every feature and equipment in the cottage were readily at hand. 

The garden space was a great place to kick back and read. We were comfortable making breakfast with the provided cookware and equipment. 

Parking was easy and the host were attentive and kept in contact to insure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. 

We loved our stay and look forward to returning on our next visit to Seattle to see family and friends.

Rick & Susan

7036707,50277305,2015-10-11,38737615,Brigitte,"The cottage was perfect. Comfortable bed, well stocked kitchenette and new bathroom. Everything was very clean and tidy. The cottage is very private and quiet and the garden is beautiful. 
Busses to capitol hill, downtown etc are all very close by and there are alot of resteraunts/shops just down the road also. 
The hosts were very helpful and accommodating and made sure we had everthing we needed for our stay. 
Perfect for a short or long stay. We're very happy that we found this place for our seattle visit. "
7036707,50642072,2015-10-13,42644332,Ryan,Went with my girlfriend for 2 days. Was more accommodating then I had antcipated.  Was a quick walk away from a lovely park.  Kim and rachel were very sweet.
7036707,54589038,2015-11-22,19343865,Farron,Kim was so accommodating and flexible with my requests! A pleasure to stay at her adorable bungalo.

7036707,56317458,2015-12-12,48517960,J Thomas,"Kim is an ideal host--a warm greeting,  thorough explanation of the BnB's ingenious features, and sincere commitment to answer questions/address concerns. The BnB has every imaginable detail worked out with almost an architect's or designer's level of anticipating the guests' comforts. Even on a grey rainy weekend in December the garden was an oasis in the city. On-street parking was never a problem, and the location is perfectly situated between downtown Seattle and the green neighborhoods of Madrona, Madison Park and the Arboretum. We will be back!!"
7036707,56846788,2015-12-19,46954094,Sari,"I'm a college student who stayed at the cottage with a friend and it was the bomb!  We met with Kim on the first day and immediately felt excited about our airbnb selection.  She was very welcoming and responsive/flexible with our needs from start to finish.  The cottage was cozy and literally stocked with everything we needed, including a binder with all the information you would need to know about using the cottage amenities, nearby restaurants, and city activities.  The personality of the cottage itself was adorably quirky, and we felt very comfortable  there.  It is located within walking distance or only a short bus ride away from most other major parts of Seattle and we had no problem getting around solely through public transportation.  I would recommend this place to anyone!"
7036707,57140082,2015-12-22,7268009,Hollis,"Kim is such a thoughtful and gracious host. She took the time to meet us even though our flight got us there on the late side. Her cottage book has EVERYTHING you would need to know and more - extremely thorough! The cottage is beautiful, private,  and cozy - wish we could have enjoyed their garden more - darn Seattle rain, but looked inviting and charming and was so picturesque to look at from our porch.  I had family over to enjoy a little holiday before the holiday and she even offered to loan us extra furniture. Just a wonderful, wonderful experience - location is a plus for me as well - as it was so close to friends and family in Madison Valley, Madrona, Leschi, etc. Cute restaurants and shops only a block away on Madison. I can't wait for my next visit! "
7036707,57516041,2015-12-27,21023776,Alex,"Our stay here was perfect. The cottage was comfortable, stocked with surprise welcome gifts and in a great location. We enjoyed the seclusion, and yet Kim was always accessible to us. The cottage is within walking distance of everything from coffee shops to great restaurants. When we go back to Seattle we will be looking to stay here again."
7788695,44270486,2015-08-24,42212938,Patrick,"This is Alice writing, Patrick's girlfriend. When I arrived at Anastasia's place, I immediately texted Patrick: it's better than a hotel! Everything is brand new. And when I say everything, means everything and more! Coffee, tea, microwave, fridge, filtered water, tableware, big tv, wifi, Netflix, aromatherapy, warm towels, closet... The bed is so comfy and it made me spend more time there than I planned! I want the same bed in my house! The room has a sofa and a table where you can have a snack watching TV. Everything absolutely clean and organized. Anastasia is the perfect host, and her family is very nice too. If you have a car, it's easy to park and near enough the touristic places. Try to catch the sunset at Golden Gardens beach - less than 10 min driving. We truly recommend Anastasia, the experience was amazing (better than we expected) and now her place is our first option in Seattle!"
7788695,45332098,2015-09-01,7251102,Maha,"Anastasia, Rob, and Malia were/are the best hosts ever! Everything about the space was well thought out and put together with care. Heated floors and heated towel rack in bathroom! Awesome tub perfect for relaxing in! Smart tv with the comfiest chair! And it smelled so great in there like a day spa! And that was just the amenities. Anastasia & family made us feel so comfortable and relaxed. They are just really kind and welcoming people. Thank you Anastasia for making our Airbnb experience so positive! "
7788695,45737304,2015-09-05,32633539,Rafael,This is a wonderful place with cozy atmosphere. Fantastic hosts that made me feel at home. Definitely recommend. 
7788695,46320396,2015-09-09,37928042,Deemetry,"My girlfriend and I needed a room in Seattle for Bumbershoot 2015. We have never been Seattle before, nor have had an airbnb before. Anastasia and her airbnb room were so great, my girlfriend is disappointed she can't leave a review of her own. Here's what earned that satisfaction.

First, the room. The room is exactly as advertised in the listing. (In ways better.) Private entrance, private space, privacy period. We were given complimentary tea, coffee, dinnerware, toiletries, shampoo, conditioner, cleaning supplies, towels, plenty of storage space, a fridge, a microwave, a coffeemaker, and even a key for each of us! We came unprepared for the Seattle rain (rookie mistake, I know) and Anastasia was happy to loan us umbrellas for our stay. The room smelled great and had a humidifier, towel warmer, tempurpedic mattress, jets in the bath (as well as a showerhead ofcourse), TV with netflix and such, and a great atmosphere. I honestly wish we couldve enjoyed the room more, we were so busy we didn't even take advantage of the TV, but every second spentin it felt very much at home.

The room is about a 5 minute walk from the metro D line, which takes about 30 minutes to reach downtown. It's located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood. We traveled the city very late at night each day we were in town and felt safe walking from the D line to the room each time. Anastasia was more than happy to provide us with printed metro info, directions, and to answer any questions about the city.

In a nutshell, the room itself is awesome. But what made us feel really fortunate was Anastasia and her family themselves.

Anastasia and her husband Robert are a very hospitable, pleasant, authentic couple. Their daughter is adorable, and we really can't wait to go back and see them again. Anastasia was attentive, respected our privacy, and made her self available to us with confidence. She really let the room and her preparations speak for themselves, but when we went to speak to her or ask for help, she (and her husband) spoke with enthusiasm and were as helpful as can be. I wish we could have spent more time just getting to know her and her family.

I mean, Anastasia even wrote us a goodbye letter! This was absolute icing on the cake for our stay.

We feel like we have family in Seattle now in a way. Anastasia and her home made our trip that much more special. It was a very enjoyable experience and really demonstrates the value that airbnb can offer beyond just a place to stay for a bit.

It offers an opportunity to connect with someone and their home.

Two thumbs way up! This listing was beyond expectations and we can't wait to go back!"
7788695,46546995,2015-09-11,42208409,Carmen,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was a great choice--so much better than a regular hotel. The location is perfect, easy access to downtown Seattle but in a calm neighborhood with lovely parks nearby. It was comforting to know I had a safe and secure home base to return to after the day's explorations. The room was very clean and thoughtfully appointed with quality products (great coffee!). The heated floor in the bathroom was a nice detail. 

Anastasia is a gracious host. She made sure I had everything I needed but was not obtrusive at all. With the private entry, I felt free to come and go without worrying about disturbing anyone. Thank you, Anastasia, Malia, and Rob for sharing your home with me!"
7788695,48255824,2015-09-24,41936628,Brittany,"Just by staying with Anastasia and Robert they gave us much more than we could have expected out of our journey. 
She goes above and beyond to make her guests experiences enjoyable. We had so much privacy, but she was still very good about communicating with us when necessary. the room was much nicer than any hotel especially for the price. And she has so much great advice and good recommendations for an array of interests. Also the location is great as well, we utilized the bus system extensively as there were many great sites within minutes of us. Don't be afraid to ask people questions and for help, everyone we met while out and about was very nice and helpful.
There's nothing they could have done differently to make our trip any more enjoyable, I really have no complaints. 

Thank you both for everything! 
-hugs"
7788695,48475178,2015-09-26,13649737,Troy & Carla,"Anastasia was a great host! We've done more than a dozen AirBnB stays and never had anyone better.

This was also the most nicely appointed place. All the fine touches. Many of the amenities you'd find at a five-star hotel."
7788695,48661555,2015-09-27,45037674,Aunna,"We couldn't have asked for a better experience! We felt welcomed from the time of booking until we left. The room is immaculate and extremely comfortable. When we left, we immediately talked about how there wasn't anything we could have asked to be different. If and when we are back in Seattle, we will definitely look to Anastasia again!"
7788695,48777956,2015-09-28,1520782,Lisa,"We could not have had much more go wrong leading up to our trip to Seattle, but Anastasia was extremely accommodating to our constantly changing timeline. When I finally arrived in Seattle (my wife and daughter couldn't make the trip because of baby allergic reactions) Anastasia was there to greet me and give me a tour of the really well maintained ""Burrow"". It was stocked with mineral water and coffee and a couple apples that came in handy in the morning. The place was spotless and charming. It was everything that was advertised and they even set out a kids cot for my daughter. Crown Hill was very nice and convenient to get around most of Seattle (at least all the places I was looking to go in my short stay!) They had a spot in the driveway for me to park as well. "
7788695,49632156,2015-10-05,20566557,Chris,"The room was lovely and was the nicest AirBnB place that I have stayed. All in all, my stay at Anastasia's was very pleasant. I only interacted with her and her family a couple times during my stay, but each time they were very friendly and outgoing and made me feel welcomed. Anastasia also gave me suggestions of places to visit during my stay in Seattle. The room was exactly as listed, equipped more like a hotel room than a guest room. The bed is very comfortable with controls to adjust the softness/firmness. There is also a mini-fridge, microwave and coffee pot. There is a private bathroom complete with a jet tub, heated floor, and heated towel rack. The listing is about a 30-35 minute bus ride or 15-20 minute drive from downtown Seattle in a quiet neighborhood with a supermarket (QFC) nearby."
7788695,50135896,2015-10-09,45313394,John,"The experience in this room is excellent, neat and well equipped. Expect to stay this room again if I visit Seattle in the future."
7788695,50328420,2015-10-11,43889721,Mandy,"My Seattle trip hit a snag in that I had car trouble on the way to Seattle. Robert and Anastasia and this beautiful room saved the day! Robert gave me a good mechanic recommendation, and being stuck at home while the car was fixed turned into a blessing! I watched movies, made tea and snacked from the provided treats, napped comfortably (white noise machine/air filter provided) and enjoyed the tricked-out bathroom (heated floors and towel racks, jetted tub!!). My car was fixed in time to pick up my sister from Seatac (about a 30 min. drive), and we had an amazing Thai food dinner that was just a few blocks away.  Other perks included an off-the-street parking space and fridge/microwave. Thank you so much, Anastasia, Robert and the ever-enthusiastic Maliyah for creating this beautiful space. I will be back!!"
7788695,50562376,2015-10-12,4050249,Jill,"A comfortable and cozy space; very clean, great bed, very quiet.  Hosts are great about communicating and made us feel very welcome.    Good value - would definitely stay again. "

Everything was perfect...clean as could be, coffee, chocolate bars, and special extras awaited us, and just that warm inviting feeling!  Anastasia and Robert were very friendly and responsive when the internet was not working.  Couldn't have been a better experience and special place to celebrate our 20th anniversary!"

Although our stay was short and we didn't get to hangout with them as much as we would of liked to, we absolutely loved staying at The Burrow! The room truly felt like a real hotel room with all the extra little homey touches that Anastasia and her family added to the room to ensure we felt at home! There were a couple of sodas, coffee, oatmeal, and dining utensils there for us to use, in addition to access to Netflix, and MY favorite, heated floors in the bathroom!!! I could've stood in there for hours! Everything was just as listed, and so much more! Their home is also located in such a cute neighborhood with great location to a lot of things to do! All I can say is thank you again Anastasia, and anybody would be smart to stay here! "
7788695,53123670,2015-11-05,6055896,Taehee,"This private modern suite is perfect for relaxing.! Anastasia was so kind and she organized everything in there. Coffee, tea, apples, towels and other many stuff! That was quite impressive!

Also neighbor is ok too. but if you have no car, it takes about 45-50 minutes to go downtown. (traffic jam in Seattle....) "
7788695,53365535,2015-11-08,45948337,Evan,Anastasia and her family were a pleasure to meet. They provided us with a lot of suggestions and advice on things to do in the Seattle area.  The room felt like a hotel suite with the heated bathroom floors and air purifier. We really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. 
7788695,53701791,2015-11-11,20916507,Swarandeep,We went to Seattle for long weekend and decided to here. This was a great decision!  Anastasia made sure the room was clean and ready before we got there.  It was very cozy and comfortable.  Anastasia also gave great suggestions for restaurants and checked in with us to make sure we had even we needed.  This was a great airbnb experience!
7788695,54124197,2015-11-16,23754666,Chris,Comfortable. Perfect for my 5 night stay. I was attending a seminar during the day near Seattle Center and the bus was so easy to access. Grocery store within a few blocks. Kitchenette perfect for breakfast and packing lunches. Thank you Anastasia for sharing this sweet part of your home. 
7788695,54458985,2015-11-20,37683893,Bailey,"""The burrow"" was very cozy. Comfy bed, and all the amenities of a fine hotel. The location was great and Anastacia was super friendly and had good suggestions on where to go for great oysters and happy hour. She suggested the Annex in Ballard which was excellent! Overall great experience.
I would stay again and recommend to others. "
7788695,54556233,2015-11-21,49110045,Michael,"Anastasia was so friendly and helpful with our check in.  The room looked better than it did in the photos, and was spotless.   Heated bathroom floor,  with the jetted tub was a very nice bonus.  Would love to stay here again.   Central location, and close to lots of activities, but we enjoyed the serenity the most."
7788695,54723843,2015-11-23,46229415,Amanda,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed staying in the burrow!
From the beginning Anastasia was very accommodating. She always responded quickly and was very understanding with out late check in. She was awesome and came down to make sure we knew how to work everything. 
The room itself was so comfortable.  You can tell that there was intentional thought placed in the details. We really enjoyed the heated floors in the bathroom and the parking was a huge relief. Anastasia provided us with snacks, and small breakfast items.  The Burrow was cozy and made for an absolute perfect stay."
7788695,55517525,2015-12-01,42291350,Graeme,A very tidy place with a nice bathroom and a few conveniences for guests. Seems like a nice neighborhood but we didn't have much time to find out as we just had a short stay.

We were so lucky to have such lovely welcoming hosts for our first AirBNB experience. Nice quite neighbourhood location though not too far from public transport to get down town.

7788695,57137802,2015-12-22,12145638,Emily,"Anastasia was the perfect host. The burrow was above and beyond our expectations!! It was super comfortable, quiet, and spotlessly clean. We loved staying there and cannot recommend it highly enough. Thanks so much for your hospitality!"
7788695,57292632,2015-12-24,41575845,Adam,"We could not have asked for a better host or a better place to stay for our first AirBnB experience. Anastasia and her family were very welcoming right from the start of our stay. Communication with them was very easy. When we arrived, the suite was clean and inviting. We had an extremely comfortable stay. Since we drove, the location was very convenient for us. We could park on the property and it was a quick drive to downtown Seattle. We highly recommend Anastasia and her place to anyone that is looking for a nice private suite to stay in. We look forward to returning in the future."
2858482,14650677,2014-06-23,779722,Kathy,"Jeanette and Brittany were great to deal with right from the start.Jeanette was not home during our stay so we didn't get to meet her but Brittany was very welcoming and had lots of great advice on things to see and do.Their recommendations for places to eat were spot on.
 Phinney Ridge neighborhood is adorable .Their place is very convenient to other charming  neighborhoods like Fremont and Ballard.Just a block to bus stop and great coffee places and restaurants and groceries.
  The bed and pillows were very comfortable and Brittany makes a mean espresso."
2858482,15635152,2014-07-13,16228970,Hanna,"Our stay (me and two friends) at Jeanette's and Brittany's place was amazing! Though they couldn't be at home at the time when we planed to move in, they prepared everything well so that it was possible for us, to move into the house, what was perfect for us! Further the neighborhood as well as their house is very nice! We felt very comfortable and well received!"
2858482,15980365,2014-07-19,4853396,Alex,"This was a great place to stay, really enjoyed my time here. Jeanette and Brittany were super welcoming. They really do offer you their home for your stay, are hospitable, easy-going and relaxed. The room is perfect, big and well presented, as is the rest of the home, which you can use. 

The location was perfect for me for the work I was doing, but I'd definitely recommend the area anyway for somewhere to stay. Loads of great coffee houses, a 5 minute walk to the wonderful Green Lake, and an easy bus ride to downtown on the Number 5. Was a great place to stay, definitely would come back here."
2858482,16121356,2014-07-22,272913,Erika  & Dave,"We loved staying at Jeannette and Brittany's place. The neighborhood is great, the house is colorfully and beautifully decorated, and both our hosts were warm and welcoming. They really encouraged us to feel at home, and went above and beyond to provide us not only with detailed info on Seattle but also on the San Juan islands where we were going before meeting them.  Amazing fruit salad, granola and coffee for breakfast. Everything was really a treat. Thanks for everything to you both!"
2858482,17374859,2014-08-11,8830465,Sheila,"Jet and Brittany were very welcoming and thorough. The information packet they provided was really helpful. We felt welcomed into the space and felt comfortable in their home. The house is in a cute neighborhood and it's just a quick bus ride to downtown Seattle. I wish the bathroom were a little closer to our room, but other than our stay here was great! "
2858482,18757126,2014-08-31,14487536,Peggy,"Our hosts were very flexible with the check in time! We even had a fresh scone on arrival. Such a ""homey"" and friendly atmosphere! "
2858482,18890844,2014-09-02,14248978,Alexandra,"Jeanette and Brittany were very welcoming and nice. They gave us tips about what to visit in Seattle.
The listing description was very accurate and the neighborhood very calm and nice. Their house is lovely.
If I have to go back to Seattle, I will definitely stay there again."
2858482,19106722,2014-09-06,38157,Annie,"I'm a frequent Airbnb'er and this was my favorite stay ever. 

Jet is fantastic. We made a somewhat last-minute booking and arrived late at night to boot. She was completely laid back about it and left the light on for us with instructions on how to get into the house. I even accidentally wandered into her bedroom instead of the bathroom that first night and she just laughed about it with me. 

Just like the rest of the house, our room was cozy and comfortable. Our room was spacious and had plenty of blankets, sheets, and pillows along with water and glasses (important since the room is upstairs and on the opposite side of the house from the kitchen and bathroom) and a lovely flower from her garden. There is a monkey puzzle tree outside the window that gives the room a treehouse feel and a blue jay would come visit in the mornings just outside the window about 2 feet away.

We stayed four nights and it felt like living with old friends. Jet's housemate, Brittany, was gone most of the time, but when she arrived home the final night, it was like meeting an old friend. 

I highly recommend staying with Jet and Brittany.

2858482,19968450,2014-09-21,20511874,Mia,"Jeanette and Brittany's house is located in a beautiful and quite neighborhood. The small green house makes us feel like we are at home! It is really cozy. The room we stay is big and there is a huuuuge and super comfy bed in the room. My friends and I love it to the max! Not only the room, we are extremely satisfied with the internet speed. There was one day that we didn't go out, just staying at home watching drama. I know it sounds a bit u productive =P Definitely worth the money we pay. The house is only 5 minutes walk to the bus station and it is only 30 minutes away from downtown. I will definitely recommend those who plan to visit Seattle to stay there!  "
2858482,23535887,2014-12-03,20640343,Natalie,"Jeanet and Brittany are wonderful hosts. I got complete directions prior to checking in, and the house looked just as pictured. The neighborhood was nice and was close to major points of my interest.

Their house is located in a safe neighbourhood close to local coffee, shops and market place. If you are staying in Seattle this is where you should stay. Cannot thank both of them enough."

Also had maps, dining suggestions, etc and its a block walk to a great neighborhood market.  Highly recommend and will return.  Thanks!  "
