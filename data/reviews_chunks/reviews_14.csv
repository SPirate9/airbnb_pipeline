Our host greeted us cordially, provided all sorts of useful information about the apartment and its features.  The apartment was VERY comfortable, great bed and all the necessary comforts to enjoy staying in and relaxing or going out and enjoying the neighborhood. The location is fabulous, a lovely neighborhood with great shops and cafes within a few blocks.  And it's very close to Seattle sights, a short drive or bus ride.  I can't wait to return!

1914051,26457470,2015-02-13,26544018,Brian,"Anna made me feel remarkably welcome. I appreciated her guide, and the little wooden sign in her yard to point the way to my room"
1914051,26952280,2015-02-22,11278939,Elisabeth,The location was perfect...only a few blocks away from Queen Anne Ave in one of my favorite neighborhoods with the best views of Seattle. The apartment suite was beautifully furnished and very clean. I felt really comfortable and at home staying here. I look forward to staying here in the future!
1914051,27266303,2015-03-01,26703960,Danielle,"We had the greatest weekend in Seattle. Our flight got in very late, but we had absolutely no problem getting into the apartment with the instructions from Anna. The place was very nice, clean and welcoming. Her neighborhood had nice restaurants and shops that were within walking distance. We stopped at the Macina Cafe every morning! Had it been a little warmer I think we would have enjoyed the backyard patio to eat the dinner we cooked one night. It was truly a great weekend. "
1914051,27480134,2015-03-05,18943921,David,Queen Anne is one of our favorite areas of Seattle. Shops and restaurant's are all within walking distance and the whole neighborhood is attractive. The apartment itself had everything we required and was stylishly furnished. Wi-Fi was free and parking was never a problem.
1914051,27726267,2015-03-10,27435868,Penny,"Anna greeted us when we arrived. The unit was clean, updated. Beautiful furnishings and a very comfortable bed with luxurious linens. For a basement apartment it had great light and looked out onto the yard. The ceilings are quit low so if you are tall this unit wouldn't work for you. We had no problem. Location is convenient to a great bakery and a 7 block easy walk to Queen Anne Blvd where you will find Trader Joe's, Safeway and lots of bars and restaurants. Betty's has a fab Happy Hour.
Hank and Penny"
1914051,27897789,2015-03-14,3301740,Jennifer,Everything was exactly as promised.  The apartment was stylish and comfortable and the location was good.  I especially appreciated the comfortable bed because when you sleep well you enjoy your holiday even more.  
1914051,28305779,2015-03-22,26049169,Yuepeng,"Overall, it's ok. The apartment is actually built on the basement. Cleanser seems be there for a really long time. And the washer breaks many times. Unluckily, I was so sick on the last day of leaving, and tbh I did clean up most of them, and put those mess into trash bags. And those linens I could not get washed because the washer is not working. "
1914051,28569639,2015-03-26,23091528,Xiaorong,"Having a nice stay at Anna's apartment. I met her once and she is really friendly. The place is comfort and cozy, close to Kerry Park and downtown. A small market is right next block, convenient to buy fruit, vegetable and meat."
1914051,29925930,2015-04-14,29036158,Diane,  You don't get or need a formal check in as you have excellent directions for self check in.  We did meet Anna outside one day.  She very charming and welcoming!
1914051,30218317,2015-04-19,2654879,Nolan,The apartment is exactly as its described. Everything in the place was first rate! The neighborhood is fantastic. Your a short drive/bus ride from the space needle and downtown. I would definitely stay here again. I could not have asked for a better place!
1914051,47108590,2015-09-15,43443353,John-Mark,"Our stay in Anna's apartment was everything we expected it to be - in the perfect location, clean, comfortable, and a great value. 

The apartment fit our needs perfectly and the host was quick to respond to questions and incredibly pleasant throughout our interactions. 

In addition to standard host etiquette, Anna accommodated our baby with a pack-n-play that she had. To take it one step further, our stay was unexpectedly extended and, while Anna's location was booked on those new nights - she was even willing to let us continue to use the pack-n-play at our new location.  This was an incredibly nice gesture, even after we were no longer staying at her place.  

I would highly recommend the location for a private, pleasant and affordable Seattle stay and a reliable and thoughtful host. "
1914051,47323157,2015-09-17,38926098,Michael,"Beautiful apartment in great location. Description and pictures represent the property well.  Anna was very accomodating, as arrived 3 hrs later than planned.  Communication was excellent. Very good instructions on location and how to access and phone number to reach the host.  Only had to wait 15mins after making booking to get confirmation.

Easy access, lots of street parking, in a very safe and quiet neighborhood. Plenty of natural light (more of a 1/2 basement apartment) with windows that look out on very pretty garden.

My wife was ecstatic, as had a Tempurpedic mattress, and slept really well.

Wifi worked well, and furnishings are all new. 5min walk to Upper Queen Anne with lots of shops and restaurants.  "
1914051,48175125,2015-09-24,5910705,Tanya & John,"We spent 6 nights in Anna's apartment in the Queen Anne area and loved it!  The area is great and close enough to all the tourist attractions without staying in downtown Seattle.  Anna's place had everything we needed to be comfortable the whole time we were there and she's a great resource for things to do and places to see. 

Make sure to visit Kerry Park, near Anna's place, for the best views of Seattle. We went during the day and at night and were amazed both times!  Thanks Anna for the recommendation!!

We would definitely stay here again Anna is a wonderful hostess!  Tanya & John"
1914051,48518327,2015-09-27,28657711,Maris,"Amazing location and beautiful place! We so enjoyed our time at your place. The location was perfect and so convenient to everything that we were doing in Seattle. Your condo was roomy and so lovely - we really felt at home. Thank you for your promptness to all questions - it was very helpful and appreciated! Wonderful host, wonderful experience!!"
1914051,49587172,2015-10-05,1458876,Michael,"Unit is beautiful and clean as a button, exactly as pictured.  Sun can be let in or the rooms darkened for sleep.  Great having laundry outside door but also secure.  I come to Seattle for ballet and found it easy to reach lower Queen Anne and studio on the #2 bus, less than a block away.  The area is very walkable.  I also used UBER and LYFT extensively.  Great experience, highly recommend."
1914051,50295185,2015-10-11,27225226,Jolie,"This home was very pretty and looked just like the photos. It had everything you could want or need. The location was absolutely amazing too. This city is full of culture and this home is right there with it. The only thing i would note is being downstairs from the main house you can hear everything including footsteps. Not a big deal, but made me super cautious of how much noise i was making too, which made it feel less like i was renting my own space. Everything else about the house was simply lovely and I would recommend it. "
1914051,51157269,2015-10-18,13570226,Angie & Jason,"Anne. Your place was absolutely amazing, once again thanks for having us!!!"
1914051,52342432,2015-10-28,11403573,Brittany,"Anna was an amazing host. She is welcoming, friendly and very helpful. The place is also great- extremely comfortable and clean. The location was perfection. My boyfriend and I rented a car (which I would recommend for a longer Seattle visit) and Anna's place felt very central. It was also nice to come back to a beautiful, quiet neighborhood after exploring all day. There are also some lovely restaurants/bars/cafes within walking distance. Not to mention, this neighborhood is gorgeous!
Thanks again, Anna!"
1914051,53211563,2015-11-06,20668723,Deborah,"Anna's home is in a quaint, lovely area of Seattle.  Lovely neighborhood shops and restaurants are in walking distance.  A sweet oasis in an exciting city.
Anna has taken great pains to make sure her lovely home provides a comfortable and pleasant atmosphere for her guests.  I can't imagine anyone would not enjoy staying at Anna's place."
1914051,53509408,2015-11-09,7669167,Jessica,"My boyfriend and I loved staying at Anna's place.  Anna was a great host. She has created a very homey and comfortable apt filled with all the amenities. The neighborhood is beautiful and very accessible to downtown and Seattle Center . If I need a place to stay in Seattle again,  I wouldn't hesitate to come back!"
1914051,53974179,2015-11-15,40654229,Tina,"Loved this little apartment and the neighborhood. So convenient and cozy. We really couldn't have asked for a better spot to stay near Seattle Pacific University. Bus and cafes as well as markets are all close. So glad we chose this place! 

FYI- this wasnt a problem for us because we are short, but the ceilings are LOW. Might be a little uncomfortable, especially in the shower if you're 6' or over. "
1914051,55717562,2015-12-05,45392181,Sarah,"Anna's place was perfect! Very clean, comfortable, and great great great location. Super easy to get on street parking and the neighborhood and surrounding areas were beautiful. We would definitely stay at her place again if we end up in Seattle. "
1914051,56396516,2015-12-13,15374282,Yen Chih ( Charles),"Anna's house is great and warm. She provide everything you want. It's quiet neighborhood, but it's basement, so maybe you can hear some sound from upside. However it's not problem to me. The washer and dryer cost just 2 dollars. It's cheap, but it's hard to get 8 quarters. I still recommend."
9389755,55144715,2015-11-28,3872338,Freya And Ben,"This was a great AirBnB experience, Garrett was super responsive and went out of his way to make sure we connected when required. The unit was private, quiet and just what I needed for my time in Seattle, it's a handy location for the lake, and all the best parts of Seattle it's near to the bus (which I tool to Ballard) and just a short stroll away from the train to/from the airport. Wholefood is just a few blocks away so you can set yourself up with food pretty quickly and easily. The place was clean, warm and the bed was VERY comfortable. I had all I needed to wash and dry my clothes and make basic meals, Internet was reliable and fast, nice TV (with basic cable)  All in all another great AirBnB and I'll look this one up if I'm coming to work in Seattle again. Thanks Garrett!"
9389755,55301274,2015-11-29,2564200,Alecia,"Garrett's place was fantastic! It was exactly how pictured and felt more like a hotel than any other airbnb I have stayed in. Check in was was easy and he was very accommodating by allow us to check out later than expected. The kitchen has anything you could possible need and was very organized. He has created a binder that explains the neighbourhood, building amenities and  lists the tv channels. Would stay here again and would recommend to friends. 
"
9389755,55875237,2015-12-06,6202383,Lauren,Great communication - Garrett was there waiting for us when we arrived to show us around and help with anything we needed. Location was perfect for us as we were working an event just a few blocks away. View from the roof deck is beautiful - make sure to catch the sunset!
5031383,41181536,2015-08-04,30717774,Nicolas,"Very welcoming place, I recommend. I enjoyed my short stay here. I didn't know the city at all but people here helped me a lot."
5031383,41546240,2015-08-07,37934425,JEB,"My experience at the Choeizan Enkyoji Temple was terrific. Mike was a truly welcoming and accommodating host, and everyone that came and went who was associated with the temple was kind and interested in my travels. 
I had my bicycle for this trip, and the location could not have been better. This location would also be perfect for someone on foot, as many public transit routes are nearby. It is also just one block from the Amtrak train station!
I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Great value in a great location with great people!"
5031383,41706287,2015-08-08,40453367,Debashish,It was an amazing experience. Mike is very friendly and everything was just perfect. The cat deserves a special mention as he was adorably cute.
5031383,42351057,2015-08-12,38655538,Clint,Great
5031383,43137401,2015-08-17,28645487,Ilana,"The folks who worked there were pretty pleasant, one offered me tea right when I got in. They put out cots for us and everything and there was generally always someone there. "
5031383,43344565,2015-08-18,37893261,Asger,Great place! Felt really welcome and got a lot of help on my further trips around the town! Can't put my finger on anything that could be done in a better way!
5031383,43470520,2015-08-19,3473613,David,"The stay was very pleasant and quiet. The host even woke up early for me when I needed to leave for my flight. Very helpful, and a quick train ride to/from the airport."
5031383,43681339,2015-08-21,22128815,Lindsey,"Good location. Early rise hour, but morning green tea with Mike is a nice way to start the day. Listening to morning service chants was pleasant as well. Interesting experience at a great price!"
5031383,44584702,2015-08-27,41422033,Bobby,"What a unique place. Mike is a good host and we got on well. It was a safe and restful place to sleep and the breakfast in the morning was good. Very central to the Seattle land transportation centers, to the stadiums and great food/cultural center of Seattle (International District). 

He gave me a great recommendation to a restaurant which went and it was really good. Mike, loved the place and they had great Japanese style curry! Thanks.
Bobby"
5031383,44722300,2015-08-28,41953615,Russ,"Friendly, clean, place to sleep... 2 blocks from train station.  Enjoyed my stay, and hope to do it again."
5031383,45437364,2015-09-02,33458274,Lillian Wendy,"Wonderful stay! I arrived at Chinatown around 5:30 am. When I looked up to begin my search for the temple, I heard someone calling my name. It was like a dream! Mike, from the temple, had walked down to escort me to the temple! It was in awe! We chatted a bit, had a wonderful prayer session, followed by a warm and welcome breakfast of miso soup and rice with another delightful guest. Mike was very helpful. He suggested places to go and how to get around. He is a very kind person. The location is perfect. Nice library. May want to bring eye shades and earplugs. Great atmosphere. Delightful people. Will stay again! Perfect for me. "
5031383,47077708,2015-09-15,41874668,Amr,"I was lucky to find this place. Michael and the temple visitors are a special group of folks. I was very encouraged by the way everyone was so friendly, and even more so by how seriously you all seem to value interpersonal relationships. I was most impressed by their humility, kindness, and respectful nature. Wherever that comes from, whether it be taught through their faith or their experiences- it just warms my heart. I had interesting conversations and really good laughs in a family atmosphere. It made me feel like home."
5031383,48490150,2015-09-26,45099097,Leigh,"Very nice stay in a unique but comfortable place. 
Easy and welcoming environment, close to public transport and walking distance from down town. 

Sleeping arrangement is a fold up bed if the main room of the temple shatter for some privacy. "
5031383,48822205,2015-09-28,41928830,Ronald,Mike was very welcoming and accommodating for my first visit to Seattle.  This location is very economical and is conveniently located next to the train station.  I enjoyed my time here and Mike was a very friendly host.   
5031383,50810646,2015-10-14,24896592,Quitterie,Mike was very nice and very helpful. Sleeping in this temple was a very nice experience.  The location is very close to all type of transportation. There is very good restaurant around the temple.  If you want to visit Seattle this is the place to stay but only one or two nights because there is no shower. There is a cat which is nice.
5031383,53100491,2015-11-04,47598295,Jacqueline,"Mike was great, as soon as I got off my flight I received a text explaining the lightrail was $3. to get to Kings station. That was at 6:30 in the morning, I walked out of King station and turned right, one block to the temple. I met Mike we had tea and chatted about things to see and do in Seattle. I left my one bag that had my computer and camera gear, Mike tucked it into a closet. I participated in a Buddhist ceremony which was a great experience. Then off I went to discover Seattle.  The write up was exactly what I expected. I came back at 8:00 that evening, set my alarms, comfy bed. I was the only guest that evening. It was quiet and restful. "
5031383,53440197,2015-11-08,19458732,Vincent,"Next to China town and the train station, the temple is nicely located.
Friendly host, with flexibility with my busy touristic schedule : once I got the keys, I could come in and out as I wish.
Wifi access was really handy.

Thanks for the stay !"
5031383,56312982,2015-12-12,48448342,Katherine,"Michael was a great host.  He made sure I was comfortable and provided lots of suggestions.  He helped me get oriented and Seattle was a great experience thanks to this awesome experience!! Hanako,  the temple cat, is a sweetheart.  The location is across from lots of bus stations and the link.  It is also about a block away from the Amtrak station.  COME  CHECK IT OUT!!! thanks Michael!!!! "
5031383,58112268,2015-12-31,6262713,Sara,"The accommodations are very basic, but I enjoyed talking with Mike (the host).  Very convenient to transit (Link light rail from airport)."
8081658,53972568,2015-11-15,44461916,Ramy,We have been in this location for the past 45 days and have greatly enjoyed our stay. Kelly has meticulously cared for this unit and it shows. It's very comfortable as advertised. The neighborhood is fantastic with great amenities and restaurants within walking distance. We hope to extend our stay a little longer!
7262358,39828657,2015-07-26,36948373,Elizabeth,I wish we could have stayed in this beautiful space longer! The neighborhood was gorgeous and the bed so comfy. Desiree was wonderful and communication was easy. We hope to return one day!
7262358,41511498,2015-08-07,3463371,Susan,"This is a lovely place. The apartment is sunny, clean & comfortable with a nice view of the main house garden and chickens! Desiree was very accommodating and even left a bottle of wine to greet us. Madison Park is a clean and quiet neighborhood lined with beautiful homes and gardens.  From the apartment it is a just a short walk to the beach (great for a brisk morning swim) and Madison Street where there is a nice little grocery and a number of restaurants & bars. I recommend the Madison Park Bakery for coffee and baked goods and highly recommend Independent Pizza for lunch or dinner. The 11 bus is also right there, we had no trouble navigating the city without a car. I would definitely stay here again."
7360078,39576640,2015-07-24,12596967,Lowis,"Jeff and his daughter were great people - Jeff was perfectly responsive very accommodating of my schedule in arranging for me to check in. I was shown around the apartment and was comfortable in no time. It's a beautiful apartment and room, the bathroom squeaky clean and spacious. The Space Needle is quite literally a stone's throw away and Pike Place Market a nice walk down the road. Highly recommended. Thanks Jeff."
7360078,40178529,2015-07-28,7965520,Richard,Didn't see Jeff in person. Great apartment and great location!
7360078,40297767,2015-07-29,39702426,Susan,Great place right down from the space needle. Good location. Jeff made us feel right at home. Would definitely stay there again and would highly recommend to anyone! 
7360078,40545418,2015-07-31,18199318,Sean,"The place is great. It's clean, in a great location, and Jeff is a kind and generous host. We were able to save some money (compared to hotels) and to get tips from someone from Seattle on what to do, where to eat, drink etc. Jeff and the place were awesome.

However, I do need to point out that when we booked the listing, it clearly said ""private bathroom"" which was something very important to my partner and I. Therefore, on the second day when Jeff asked us to clean out the bathroom of our stuff because we would be sharing it with two other people, we were a bit annoyed. While the stay was otherwise great, we never would have stayed there if the bathroom was not private. 

So, great place, great location, great host. BUT, the private bathroom may not be private!"
7360078,40851890,2015-08-02,12746241,Sasha,"Absolutely AMAZING home and location. Stunning views and a quick 3 minute walk to the space needle. About a 15 minute walk into downtown and great little restaurants along the way. Jeff was the perfect host, extremely kind and helpful with suggestions on where to go and what to see. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! Thank you Jeff :)"
7360078,41519124,2015-08-07,40067509,Emily,"Great experience, wonderful host, can't beat the location! Jeff's place was immaculate, and he was very friendly and helpful... and even let me do a load of laundry :). I'd definitely look into staying here again if I'm ever back in Seattle."
7360078,41704975,2015-08-08,38619984,Maxx,"Seattle is an amazing city! Jeff's apartment is right in the heart of it. Everything is within walking distance, I didn't need to drive my car once! The room was exceptionally clean and the apartment was very nice and modern. Jeff even had complementary coffee and fruit for his guests!  "
7360078,41880214,2015-08-09,11580728,Marin,Jeff was a very friendly and attentive host. The listing is in a great location and the rooftop is definitely a must. It was my friends first Airbnb experience and Jeff provided such a great time for the both of us. The listing is exactly as it is described and is very clean. Would definitely recommend this listing to anyone visiting Seattle.  
7360078,42016739,2015-08-10,1183231,Chris,"You get a comfortable room in luxury apartment, located in the heart of Seattle. And Jeff is a gracious and friendly host!"
7360078,44669019,2015-08-28,33504745,Erin,"Jeff was a fantastic host every step of the way. He took the initiative to provide water, fruit, and snacks (it's the little things that always make a difference) and was there to help whenever there was a need.  I loved the property and it was in the perfect location- steps from the Seattle Center and a close walk to all of the local attractions. The amenities were also fantastic and the rooftop deck is incredible. He was a fantastic host and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
7360078,45012285,2015-08-30,38972124,Neha,"This is our first experience with Air BnB. Jeff welcomed us so well, gave us our share of privacy, no disturbance, nothing. He had accepted our request at a short notice, very flexible. Location was perfect. Place was beautiful, nice and clean. Amazing view from roof top. It was raining, we weren't prepared, but it just added to our experience. Very relaxing trip for us, we didn't have to plan for this, that, travel, etc. etc. Everything we needed, was readily available, Jeff had water for us, coffee in morning, toiletries, fresh linen, towels, etc. etc. Shared Wifi connection. :)

One thing, our bathroom was shared and separate from our room. It was slight inconvenient when 4-5 people are sharing same bathroom. Well, just a learning for us, next time we will look out for granular details and share our expectations explicitly with owners."
7360078,45456270,2015-09-02,42339781,Chander,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9098494,54060680,2015-11-15,19406236,Avrohom,"This house was great! Seemed like we were spending the weekend in a Dwell magazine spread. The neighborhood was a mix of residential and commercial being off California Ave. the main artery that bisects east / west of W. Sea. there are plenty of interesting neighborhood shops and eateries as well as post office and banks. The house had good views (from the upper floors ) of Pugent Sound and Alki beach is just a little over a mile away. The linens on the bed were inviting, the mattress in the master bedroom comfortable and plenty of towels available. "
9098494,54522556,2015-11-21,34492282,Zubeidah,"Very nice and modern home--tastefully decorated. The host was responsive, patient, and understanding. She accommodated and responded to my requests/inquiries appropriately.

Note: second upstairs bedroom is an air mattress."
9098494,56786332,2015-12-18,48280105,Jan,"The house was great - location, views, and spacious! Although I was concerned about the parking, it was not an issue at all!"
9098494,57213111,2015-12-23,9532877,Lynne,"We had a great stay at Sheeba's.  Here's some info for future travelers:
Checkin:  Super smooth.  She sent us directions with everything that we needed for getting into the house and making ourselves at home.  
Suggestion:  Print the directions, keep them handy and read them often!  You need them to unlock the door, set up beds, work the TV, work the bathrooms, throw things out in your OWN garbage cans, find the linens and towels.  If you don't print those instructions, keep them handy, and use them, everything in the house might be a little more difficult than it needs to be.  
 
Location:  best we could have asked for!  Walk to Mass, 7-11, coffee, GREAT restaurants.  2 turns and you're on the bridge to downtown.  Split up, 1/2 took the bus back.  $2.50 and C line Rapid Ride drops you off 2 blocks away from the house.

Views:  So great!  Even with crappy weather.  

Space:  Plenty of room for everyone, until you eat.  Two stools by the counter is all.  We ate in shifts so the kids didn't mess the furniture.  A table with chairs would have been nice to use, (but may not be aesthetically desirable in such a beautifully decorated apt, I admit.)

Light:  no drapes past the 1st floor.  The light comes right in to your bedroom.  It was cloudy and we are early risers, so it worked for us.  

Beds:  2 beds are heaven.  2 beds are comfortable convertible sofas.  One's an air mattress.  Fine for a night, but one guest was not as happy as the others for the other 3 nights.  

Bathrooms:  only one working shower.   No tub.  We knew this going in, and girls showered at night to speed along the morning.   There are 3 powder rooms so no one had to wait to go.  

Walking:  If you can't do stairs, this may not be the place for you.  You can't shower without doing 2 flights.  Parking was a bit of an issue, (and it wasn't even summer time), but we found a spot every time.  

Pros:  location!, cleanliness!, style!, owner attentiveness!, size!, 4 very comfortable beds!  Great entertainment center with Netflix, local stations, Echo, strong WiFi!  

Cons:  none for us, but if you MUST have close parking, no stairs, lots of seating to hang out, 2 showers, a bathtub, or someone meeting and showing you very simple lodgings, you may not be as happy as we were that we stayed.    

We recommend and would stay again!

9098494,57442487,2015-12-26,7658285,Heidi,"We had a lovely stay at Sheeba's house. It was a great location for our little family, and we really loved being so close to coffee shops and grocery stores. The house itself is beautiful with lots of great aesthetic touches. 
There is ONLY ONE shower (which we were not informed of before our stay), so be prepared if you come with a larger group.
We all struggled a bit with the lack of window treatments, and the numerous church bells. It was quite noisy and bright, so after our first night, we ventured out for earplugs and eye masks. Come prepared!
The place also doesn't seem to have wifi; at least I never heard yay or nay from Sheeba. We were able to ""steal"" some from the neighborhood (#junctionlife), but it was spotty and unreliable. It would have been nice to have wifi in the home. "

She left me some information on the neighborhood, a bag of coffee for my arrival, and messaged me to ensure everything was all right. The room was great; quiet and clean, and the location is well-situated between Ballard and Freemont neighborhoods. Would definitely stay there again!"
1364440,10272179,2014-02-10,11454123,Sean,"Great place, fantastic location and Shannon was an excellent host.  Wouldn't hesitate to stay with her again or recommend her to others"

1364440,15938754,2014-07-18,6904797,Maria,"Shannon is a worthy host and she interacts with you in a very effective way.  Her place is nice too and the view is lovely.  It is comfortable like a sublet, or like you just happen to live in this place for a short time.  "
1364440,19083055,2014-09-06,18865724,Iain,"Lovely room in a great location. Shannon was a fantastic host, giving me suggestions as to what to do and lending me guide books. She even stayed up to meet me when my flight was delayed. An all round brilliant experience. "
1364440,19480731,2014-09-13,2204166,Isabel,Shannon was wonderful and her house was a comfortable and cozy place where to rest. Shannon is super nice and attentive. A great place!
1364440,32008683,2015-05-12,11332282,Ricky,"I stayed at Shannon's place for a weekend after a work trip in Seattle. Coincidentally, she had to be out of town when I was staying, so it was just me having the place to myself. Shannon was very considerate and communicative while handing off the keys, and giving me great tips on places around the neighborhood. She has a very useful tip sheet as well, which she'll email you if you stay.

Her place is great and exactly what I needed for a relaxing weekend. If you like walking, this is a great location about less than 20 mins one way to Ballard or Fremont. Easy to Uber in and out of, and there's a bus route close by, which I didn't use. There are hills around the area, which is something to consider if your not into that sort of thing. I didn't drive, but there seemed to be lots of street parking available. 

Her place was cozy and comfortable, and Shannon is a warm and considerate person. I'd recommend it to my friends."
1364440,32721328,2015-05-20,23317422,Angel,"Shannon was a great host and provided plenty of options for things to do while in Seattle. The room was quiet, clean and overall very comfortable. "
1364440,33298275,2015-05-26,1110582,Christina,"Shannon was an amazing host! Her house is situated in a really cute neighborhood with convenient transportation nearby. Ballard is a great part of Seattle to explore, and the views are incredible. Shannon went out of her way to make me feel at home and help me find my way around the city. These types of experiences are what I love about AirBnB!"
1364440,33849926,2015-06-01,19482183,Evan,"Shannon was great, and staying with her was great, too! The room is as described--neat, in a lovely home, and in a neighborhood near lots of great food and drinking, with easy bus access downtown if you need it, too. 

Shannon made me feel totally welcome, and if I'm in Seattle again anytime soon I would absolutely stay here again. "
1364440,34103933,2015-06-04,33699354,Ungsumalynn,"Although Shannon wasn't there to greet me in person on the first day, I felt as though she was there to make me feel right at home. I arrived when she had left for a trip, which was no problem for me at all, and I got into the house just fine and got accustomed just fine. First off, I really love the house. It's really cute and also had a great location! Everything about the home fit the description. Shannon also checked up on me to make sure I was doing alright, which I really appreciated. She seems really friendly and down to earth! I would love to go back to her home if I go on another trip to Seattle!"
1364440,34979848,2015-06-14,6437984,Gerry,"I enjoyed my stay in Shannon's. The apartment is in a nice quiet neighborhood  in Ballard. The room has a comfortable bed and the shared bathroom is next door to the room providing easy access. Shannon was quite welcoming and easy going. She even gave me a lift at the end of my stay, which was very considerate. There is access to a washing machine and dryer - this was also a plus since I ended up using the facilities in the middle of my stay."
1364440,35337793,2015-06-17,27367615,Tiina,"Shannon went out of her way to wait for me since I was caught in traffic, but when she needed to leave, she was up front and communicative. And when I needed privacy, she didn't bother me at all!

The location was great and the neighborhood was nice and quiet even though it seemed like we were on a big street. My room was in the back so I couldn't hear anything. I could walk down to Leary Way and had breakfast at The Dish cafe or dinner at Tray Kitchen (lots of fun - I recommend it!), and parking was plentiful and easy too.

Shannon's place was clean and neat, and even though the bed was a little hard, it was the nice touches like the hangers, lots of shelf space, an extra shelf in the bathroom for my toiletries that made the stay easy. I really felt like I was crashing at a friend's place for a few days while I find a new apartment (which is what I did!). I even said ""See you later!"" at the end of my stay.

1364440,36153253,2015-06-25,4154240,Danny,Shannon is a great host and was able to accommodate me at the last minute. Her place is clean and comfortable. 
1364440,37888659,2015-07-11,29614093,Sophie,"I had a great time at Shannon's. She was very hospitable and her place was clean, well put together and really close to public transport. It was also only about $10 for an Uber into Downtown Seattle if you're that way inclined! "
1364440,38132627,2015-07-13,34034544,Rachel,Shannon was a friendly host. It was easy to get around Seattle from her neighborhood. I absolutely recommend staying at her airbnb!
1364440,42686528,2015-08-15,18696270,Kari,"Staying at Shannon's place was ideal. Moving from across the country was hard enough but having a great place to stay with an awesome host made it so much easier. She's really flexible with scheduling and coordinating and most of the time I had the place to myself. Her house is comfortable and the room is perfect for a temporary stay. You're close to everything in Ballard and Fremont, as long as you don't mind walking and the bus is super close to catch to downtown. Definitely recommend. "
1364440,46300985,2015-09-09,1484921,Ronit,"Shannon was very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment is clean and organized, and the location is great.
We had a great weekend in Seattle, thank you!"
1364440,48469995,2015-09-26,7485789,Julian,"This is a clean, quiet place in a good area close to appealing parts of the city like Wallingford, Greenlake, Fremont and Ballard, and Shannon is very nice. Definitely a good value. "
7067650,43864264,2015-08-22,1865160,Adam,"Jarred was incredibly helpful with all aspects of staying at his place, even leaving us an awesome goodie back of coffee, red-vines and a few brews in the fridge!

His place is super comfortable (the most comfortable bed we slept in our entire trip), water pressure is great, and its very conveniently located.  Just down the street was a great breakfast spot called Louisa's.  Across the street is an AWESOME sandwich and beer spot called Mammoth (growlers, bottles and drafts).  You're a convenient and short (10 dollar Lyft) from Fremont or Capitol Hill.  It's an absolutely great place to stay.  

Our only issue was finding the door.  It's a 1/2 address so the entry was really from the alley.  Once we figured that out everything else was smooth sailing.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
7067650,45154800,2015-08-31,5246537,Kyle,"This place was extremely tidy and comfortable when we showed up. Jarred was super gracious by offering really good suggestions for places to go and providing some snacks/coffee in a care package.

I highly recommend staying here if you want to be in a beautiful part of Seattle that isn't right in the middle of downtown."
7067650,45541342,2015-09-03,391714,Lauren,"Everything about this experience was outstanding! Jarred & Tess are so lovely, so easy to communicate with and they made the process super easy and fun. They left detailed information, a charming welcome package, and were so helpful with recommendations for restaurants, bars, music venues, transport options, anything I needed.

The bungalow is so comfortable and cozy, exceptionally welcoming. There are thoughtful touches everywhere and the décor is eclectic and unique, you really get the feeling that you're in a good friend's place that happens to have excellent taste. Although it is described as a bungalow it feels spacious and there is great natural light. Comfortable bed, well stocked kitchen, super clean, I had absolutely zero complaints.

The location is also very cool. It is in a quiet neighborhood but is a minute's walk to a bus stop that will have you Downtown or in the University District in ten minutes. The buses are frequent and so convenient. A taxi or Uber to or from Downtown, the U District, Belltown or Capitol Hill is also super easy and affordable.

I will absolutely stay here again! Jarred & Tess are a delight, as is their beautiful space. Thanks so much for everything, you two! :)"
7067650,46017631,2015-09-07,10438954,Satu,"Tess and Jarred have encapsulated the essence of good AirBnB hosts: creating a homey but hotel-like experience for guests. My boyfriend and I spent 4 days and nights in Seattle, and could not be happier with our stay at the charming bungalow. We felt welcome from the get go with a friendly note waiting for us, along with beers, wine and fancy coffee beans (Stumptown, my favorite!).

The house was clean, cute, tastefully decorated with zero clutter and beautiful plants, and matched the description and the pictures (yes, the guitar was there too!). The entrance is through the alley, but it doesn't feel like some back alley house behind an apartment complex - in fact, the whole street is double lined with cottages, apartments and houses on both the alley and street side. If you are concerned about the proximity to the freeway like I was - fear not. Inside the house you cannot hear any freeway noise, and although sitting out on the patio you certainly hear it, it's not distracting and goes with the city vibe.

The bed is comfortable with a cushy down duvet and pillows, and the kitchen has all basic necessities to cook meals (the frying pan had seen better days but it did the job for simple morning scrambles). There is a library of modern classics that you always thought you should read but never got around to (I started on some Vonnegut, but didn't get through it in 4 days), along with tons of quality TV shows and movies on DVD. In the bathroom, the beautiful, rustic claw foot tub was an awesome surprise!

The location is great - close to everything, yet you feel like a true Seattleite walking down the street to your neighborhood cafe or corner market. Lake Union is a few blocks down the hill with house boat marinas lining the shore, but there is a nice enough path for walking/running. We didn't try out public transportation since we had a car rental, but parking was convenient right by the house.

Both Tess and Jarred were incredibly quick responding to my messages and texts, even at midnight on the day we arrived, but since we didn't encounter any problems during our stay (running out of toilet paper isn't really a problem..), we only chatted before and after our stay.

I would definitely stay here again, and recommend it to friends looking for a private, comfortable place filled with character, hosted by a wonderful and considerate couple.
"
7067650,46656848,2015-09-12,29630741,Molly,"Staying at Jarred and Tess's was really great. The house was clean, comfortable, private, and spacious with a lot of natural light. Our hosts were easy to reach throughout our stay, and even provided us with a lot of great suggestions for places to eat and sightsee, with a goodie bag and some beers left in the fridge as an additional plus! Especially helpful, they were flexible to our special requests, and seemed happy to help us out in any way they could. Would definitely stay here again. "
7067650,50306995,2015-10-11,29831920,Brianne,"Jarred and Tess's place is awesome. Not to mention they are both amazing and so helpful. My husband and I were moving to the Emerald City and needed a place to stay while we were house hunting. When we realized it was going to take longer than our initial booking, we immediately reached out to them to discuss our situation. When they got an offer for the time after our booking ended, they texted us and asked if we wanted to extend our stay, so that we weren't without a home. Their place is very cute and even our pets loved having the outdoor space to relax. All in all, we highly recommend Jarred and Tess's bungalow for any length of stay."
7067650,52127165,2015-10-26,44531271,Moira,"Charming place in a great location + off street parking. Unfortunately, there was a strong pet odor, which we did get used to, but I would not recommend this place for anyone who is sensitive to smells. Hosts were very responsive and recommended some great places to eat in the neighborhood."

We especially loved walking down the hill to 14 Carrot for breakfast and Mammoth for some excellent sandwiches and a great beer selection."
23192,5053184,2013-06-10,5880204,Kristina,We stayed here for a weekend in June and really enjoyed the location of the apartment.  The beds and sofas were all very comfortable and I would definitely stay here again.

The living room is a bit hot without air conditioner and the wifi is a little slow. Other than that, it is a great place to stay."
749758,4574992,2013-05-13,4742780,Doug,"Rita and Elwin were great. They are very nice people, easy to have a conversation with, and attentive to needs. They converted their house to a duplex and offer of the back half to you, with a couple of doors separating the spaces. For this reason, the house can be a little noisy. The walls are thin and you can hear things going on in other rooms. It isn't bad, but something you should be aware of before you stay here. Another thing you should be aware of is that the kitchen is very small. If you plan to stay for a long time and cook each night, this can become a problem. It is fine if you aren't staying for long or aren't planning on cooking a lot of big meals. It works well for most circumstances. The neighborhood that the house is in is great. There are many restaurants, bars, and grocery stores to walk to (although most require walking up and down a small hill). And you're only a 10 minute walk to bus terminals in every direction that can take you anywhere else you might want to go."
749758,49681684,2015-10-05,3563035,Sally,"Thank you, Rita and Elwin, for your friendly hospitality and comfortable apartment. My daughter and I loved meeting you both. Your place was so convenient and had a great little kitchen! Thanks for hosting and making our weekend carefree!"

749758,51839143,2015-10-24,27862449,Micah,"Rita and Elwin were there to greet us upon arrival. Both were very friendly and Elwin was a witty young man. He had several suggestions for restaurants in the area which was very helpful. The house is exactly as described and was perfect for my family of 4.  Off street parking was a plus, location was great, only 10 minutes to downtown Seattle. We were not at the house much but the washer and dryer came in handy. It is a very reasonable price for the location, cleanliness and spaciousness of the house. I would stay here again on any future trips if it were available."
749758,52467586,2015-10-29,41719145,Bianka,"Rita ist sehr komplikationslos und aufgeschlossen. Wir wurden ganz herzlich empfangen, obwohl wir nicht zur verabredeten Zeit einchecken konnten. Für das Abendessen hatte sie tolle Tipps für uns und auch sonst hat sie sich sehr um uns gekümmert. Die Betten sind sehr gemütlich und einladend, die Wohnung bestens ausgestattet. Ihr Mann Elwin ist auch immer sofort zur Stelle und konnte weiterhelfen. Obwohl man in einer Großstadt ist, liegt das Haus in einer ruhigen Gegend."

She offered us an incredible amount of advice on dining options and travel options (buses, trains, parking), and she was also so helpful with making sure that we were at home. She was very generous about sharing everything in her home, from her coffee and tea to towels. Her place is beautiful and the bed was so comfortable! We were so grateful for having a place to stay within walking distance of so many things in Seattle, and we couldn't have asked for a better host. Thank you!"

6812415,36224750,2015-06-26,14563992,Willie,Marianne was a great host. She took care of all our basic needs and was extremely friendly. Space was small but we were able to feel comfortable regardless.  My wife and I would defiantly recommend this host. 
6812415,36601601,2015-06-29,18365356,Timmie,"We got there around noon and  Marianne was upbeat,friendly and helpful. She opened her home to us and make us feel like home. Her place is a couple of street away from downtown so its not too noisy bt close enough that you can go anywhere on foot. She had everything ready for us and her place is clean and neat and well lit. She is very sophisticated and nice to talk to. I would recommend her place to  people i know. "
6812415,36899797,2015-07-02,4948321,Doug,This property was just as described. Marianne was very hospitable with a fresh pot of coffee in the morning. A perfect location with just a short walk to Pike Place and other attractions. I hope to stay there on my next visit.
6812415,37898185,2015-07-11,27863818,Jennifer,"Marianne was awesome! She went above and beyond helping me figure out how to get everywhere in Seattle and made wonderful recommendations. I really felt at home here. I loved the neighborhood, great central location, walkable to downtown and Pike Place which I loved, really cheap short uber ride to the space needle and other attractions! I felt safe in this neighborhood and would highly recommend this studio to anyone."
6812415,38025245,2015-07-12,22499649,Lily,"Marianne is a super sweet lady, very welcoming.  Apartment is just as pictured, compact and cozy.  Really comfortable bed!  Location is 10 blocks uphill from touristy area.  We walked, but cabs were easily caught and of course uber was also available.  Perfect for a quick in/out overnight stay. "

6812415,39043225,2015-07-20,10949228,Leander,"Marianne was awesome,  she provided us with everything we needed during our stay and tips on how to get the most out of our trip. When we informed her that we were thinking about bringing our bikes to check out the city, she went out of her way to accommodate us and even provided us with a map of the best bike routes for a safe and easy commute. The studio space was clean and inviting, there was fresh cut flowers, clean towels and linens waiting for us. The comfy bed and charming decor made us feel like we were staying in Paris above the Champs-Elysees, although we've never been to Paris, we're pretty sure its close. The space is well centrally located to where you can easily access all the must see spots in Seattle.  We didn't see much of Marianne during our stay, which is a shame because we really enjoyed meeting her, but she was great at keeping us informed and checking in with us. We would definitely look to stay here again next time we're in Seattle.  "
6812415,39413483,2015-07-23,36794622,Zack,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I've got nothing but good things to say about the experience. The space was very conveniently located, a short walk from both Cap Hill nightlife and the downtown area where I needed to work. The apartment itself was comfortable and clean and had some personality. And Marianne was amazing as a host. She drew me two maps of the area (one for places to drink, one for places to eat), made me feel welcome, and actually suggested a couple of specific nightlife activities. Would totally stay here again and I recommend it to others."
6812415,41635188,2015-08-08,6088254,Mihee,"Marianne was very warm and kind. She was easy to contact and helpful with directions and recommendations.

Easy walking distance to many attractions in Seattle.

The room itself has been kept very clean, functional as well as artisanal. Host Marianne was very welcoming and considerate throughout my whole trip. In short, everything made me feel cozy and warm. I recommend anyone that enjoys the airbnb community spirit to Marianne's!"

Marianne was a wonderful host--she had a drink waiting for (email hidden) downstairs as I arrived :) The studio is cute and thoughtfully decorated with momentos from her years of travel, and  I slept like a king in the super-comfortable bed. Thanks Marianne!"

Kriston was very helpful, he left us clear instructions for everything. Sophie is really nice cat, it is super easy to take care of here :) 
Location is wallkable distance to downtown, there is also public transport, so transport was very convenient.
We really recommend it as a great place!"
8102064,48019440,2015-09-22,43126798,Kelli,"I really enjoyed my stay on Capitol Hill, Kriston's place as well as his cat Sophie were very welcoming.  I am in town for business and the location was ideal. Kriston provided me with helpful information about the area and easy to follow instructions for the sweet cat. I definetly recommend."

As I was taking a late ferry in from Victoria, British Columbia, I was exhausted when I arrived. Logan was wonderful in welcoming into her home at a late hour. 

The room was exactly as I expected, so I slept quite well.

The next day, I was headed to a Sunday morning event in Northeast Seattle. Logan was simply superb in helping me get there!

This Lake City location was completely perfect for me, as it is quiet, close to buses, etc.

Logan is a bi-coastal American with a rich history, a great sense of humor, and a natural ability to be a host in her lovely home.

"
1097766,40497429,2015-07-31,19476223,Burak,Logan is one of the most down to earth person I have ever seen :D I talked with her everyday and it was enjoyable to stay at her house. She was very helpful and very responsive. House is very clean. Everything was above my expectation. Thanks Logan :D I will miss you. 
1097766,40846169,2015-08-02,17551053,Michel & Vanessa,"We stayed with Logan for one night to attend a wedding nearby. She is a great hostess who went out of her way to accommodate us and meet all of our requests. She has a very warm, welcoming and charismatic personality. The room was clean and even though the bed was a futon it was quite comfortable. We would definitely stay with Logan again in the future if we return to Seattle."
1097766,41442865,2015-08-07,26708339,Jenny,Logan was very nice... the room was perfect we stayed 1 night before going on the Alaskan cruise she took great care of us even helped us get around.
1097766,42019796,2015-08-10,39083009,Carl,The room was neat and clean along with the (email hidden)rfect for one person or a couple. Host was great really helpful and made sure your stay is a comfortable as she can make it for you.
1097766,42964625,2015-08-16,39844817,Aaron,"The Sun Drenched in Seattle room was very nice, and accommodated our needs very well. Logan herself was very friendly, available, and helpful in getting my brother and I settled and answering our questions both in person and through the Airbnb chat. The house was peaceful and easy to relax in. The amenities we were given covered all of the needs we had for our trip, and even had some fresh fruit available to guests. She has a very professional setup with stocks of supplies for her guests. As well, the house is in easy walking distance of buses and grocery stores. I would highly recommend this room."
1097766,44074592,2015-08-23,40746808,Thomas,Logan's very friendly and hospitable manner made me immediately feel welcome.  She explained the arrangements clearly.  The accommodation was well suited to me and I slept very well on the firm fold out futon.  The desk and chair were useful for some writing that I needed to do.  The bathroom facilities were clean and fully satisfactory.  Logan responded very helpfully when I mistakenly forgot my house key and arranged an alternate means for me to re-enter the house.  
1097766,44743928,2015-08-28,42385080,Keith,"Great stay :) Home was clean, inviting and Logan made me feel right at home. Looking forward to the next stay!!"
1097766,45914409,2015-09-06,43344159,Brittany,"Logan is absolutely amazing and it was a pleasure to stay at her home. Very comfortable, clean, and she definitely made us feel welcome. We were even lucky enough to try some of her homemade fried chicken! I will definitely plan to stay at Logan's again!"
1097766,53431826,2015-11-08,6426992,Michael,"We really enjoyed staying with Logan.  She was friendly and personable.  Katryn fixed her TV, which was kinda fun and had been a frustration for Logan.  The location is convenient.  We would love to stay here again."
3883392,22557376,2014-11-09,14996470,Jason,"Had a great stay.  The place is as shown in the pictures - great open living space, very comfortable and nicely appointed.  Neighborhood is nice and quiet, yet very close the heart of the Queen Anne and / or Ballard neighborhoods.  Roberta and Pat were very responsive and accommodating, and clearly take pride in their place.  As the first renter to review this property I happily give it 5 stars and it will be on my list for future visits to Seattle."
3883392,23047729,2014-11-21,23545134,Ilee,"Roberta and Pat were very welcoming, helpful, and easygoing. Everything was exactly as described. We loved their place! The place is near downtown yet in a very nice and quiet neighborhood. Everything was perfect! Highly recommend this place!"
3883392,23672225,2014-12-07,1965359,Bryan,"Simply off the charts, beautiful location and rental unit and simply the best host experience I have ever had on air BNB.  Whole experience was simply great.  "
3883392,33680561,2015-05-31,7799063,Dayna,"Roberta and Pat are authentic hosts - warm and welcoming.  Their rental home was perfect for us!  Location was quiet but very near downtown Seattle.  The space is beautifully decorated, very accommodating (coffee, breakfast options, quality linens...), and very spacious for 4 adults.  The 2nd bedroom with twin beds worked well for our almost adult children.
We loved the level of detail Roberta and Pat have put into making the space feel like a vacation should feel...special!   Well done!"
3883392,35535826,2015-06-20,25358748,April,The homeowners were very welcoming and quickly accommodated our requests.  
3883392,36406173,2015-06-28,5538652,Jeannette,Great place to stay! Location is close to downtown and it has great views. My baby slept great there and so did I - beds were comfortable. Place is very well kept and incredibly organized. There were even things I wasn't expecting that were provided for. Just note we went when it was super hot and didn't realize a lot of Seattle homes don't have a/c... So the heat wave got a little bit toasty. 
3883392,37318035,2015-07-06,5303028,David,The place was incredible. It was more than what my friends and I expected. Pat and Roberta were great host. The place is centrally located where you can get to different parts of Seattle easily. I recommend this spot for anyone who wants to stay there.
3883392,38613830,2015-07-17,35182533,Sarah,"We loved our stay at Roberta and Pat's! The only problem was that we had to leave! The apartment is inviting, super clean, comfortable, and so tastefully and thoughtful stocked. There wasn't anything we lacked. They provided us an air mattress for our little one, and they even stocked eggs, water bottles, snacks, and lens cleaning wipes, to name a few things! It was quiet, the beds and linens were incredibly comfortable, everything worked, it wss spotless, and they were kind and easy to deal with, yet unintrusive. I could not recommend this place or our hosts more highly! Thank you again for hosting us, Roberta and Pat!"
3883392,41316479,2015-08-07,8277133,Jan Jaap,"Prachtig, modern ingericht appartement in een prettige rustige buurt, maar vlakbij een bushalte, dus downtown Seattle is prima bereikbaar. Voorzien van alle moderne apparatuur. Heel prettig was het ook dat er van alles in de ijskast stond dat gebruik mocht worden."
3883392,42110818,2015-08-11,14195782,Joe,"This place was perfect! Very clean and in a nice district of Seattle. Pat and Roberta are very nice people. They had every thing very well organized. Seattle is a recycle friendly city, instructions were left to help us get used to the guidelines. We definitely took away a greater awareness. Thanks. This place is roomy, very clean, comfortable, close to the major tourist attractions. 5 plus stars!!! "
3883392,43211056,2015-08-18,6930777,J Douglas,"What a wonderful place, convenient to all.  From the cleanliness to the linen, all above and beyond expectation.  My boys and I had a wonderful stay and it couldn't have been a more perfect and comfortable location.  Thank you Pat and Roberta, you are truly unique and astonishing hosts."
3883392,43941966,2015-08-23,4270059,New,"Pat and Roberta were very thorough and available for questions. We texted and emailed leading up to our trip, and when we arrived (around 12:30AM!) to the house, they were there to greet us with smiling faces! 
There was everything we needed at the house, with detailed notes on how to use coffee maker, how to separate the recycling, how the shower works, etc. 
The apartment was in the cutest neighborhood in Seattle, had a great view, and was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again. "
3883392,49212601,2015-10-02,28458151,Jill,"We can't say enough about this Airbnb.  Even with the great reviews, we were still surprised at the special touches that made this rental a 5 star for us.  Communication  with Roberta and Pat before we checked in was a breeze. After meeting us at check-in they gave us a brief tour and offered to help us in any way during our stay if needed.  Things like coffee, cream and sugar, so you didn't have to rush to the store right away, a bathroom with plenty of plush towels and full bottles of shampoo, cream rinse and soap, along with a couple of dryers, magnifying mirror and a wonderful shower head (that we all commented on), were just a few of the special touches that this Airbnb had to offer. Not to mention the fact that the location couldn't have better. We rented a car, but it isn't really necessary if you are just there to enjoy the city and close surrounding areas.  We would highly recommend this rental to anyone who wants a place that you look forward to returning to at the end of a long day, or even staying in for a day during your visit to relax. It was just perfect.

7653539,41290280,2015-08-05,21018833,Jainu,"Oh my! Thank you Kristina for letting us stay in your awesome apartment. The location is awesome, you have so many eat out options. The place is so big and beautiful. Coordinating with Kristina was so much awesome, even though we were late, she made arrangements for us to pick up the keys. There is assigned secured parking spot. The place was so clean and functional, I felt as if I were at home. Her extensive collection is a must see! Kristina made sure she provided us everything we needed. Awesome host. "
7653539,42500318,2015-08-13,41170577,Bran,"Kristina made this so easy. I had to find a place at the last minute. She responded quickly, asked what I needed and made sure I instantly felt at home. Kristina's home is well decorated and the bed is oh so comfortable. Plenty to do around the area, within walking distance. Plus FREE PARKING!! Which is amazing. The apt comes with access to a outside lounge which is nice to enjoy in the evening and a small but nice gym. I would highly recommend this place!  "
7653539,46333693,2015-09-09,11737743,Mark,"My wife and I stayed at Kristina's apartment for 7 nights. My wife slept on the fold out sofa and I used the bedroom. The apartment did not have any place for us to hang our clothes: Kristina had all of her stuff in the drawers and closets so Jane and I lived out of our suitcases for 7 days. There isn't a TV so we watched streaming movies on my laptop at night. The number 41 bus took us downtown in about 25 minutes. Kristina provided a variety of good coffees and breakfast cereal with almond milk.
"
7506165,39888633,2015-07-26,12220023,Simon,"Eve & Michael were great.  The location is perfect for tourists who want to experience how someone can live in Seattle (high end apartment living) and those working downtown.  Easy walk to Pike Street Market, the Ferris Wheel and the restaurants at the Piers.  Also located 1/2 block from one of the cities many pronto bike share.  The condo itself is very nice with fantastic views (2/1).  Don't forget to go to the rooftop.  Phenomenal views!  This really helped make our first visit to Seattle not be our last.  "
7506165,40404628,2015-07-30,15430479,Fuzzy,"My host, Eve, was great to work with - very timely to respond to my inquiries both before we arrived and during our stay.  This apartment is brand new - a beautiful unit with great views of the city, water, and the stadium district. It has an awesome community roof-top patio that I would highly recommend as well.  Great location - easy walk to all the spots downtown - Pike's Place Market, restaurants, bars, shopping, etc...  No need for a car here, but if you do have one, parking is limited.  Overall, I would definitely rent from Eve again and highly recommend this unit.      "
7506165,40835294,2015-08-02,36745651,Chris,"Nice unit on the SE side of the building, we had a really great stay there and loved the location. Eve was very organized and communicative too, would definitely stay here again!"
7506165,42186102,2015-08-11,18014165,Jeff,"Morgan was a pleasure to work with. Great attention to detail and was in close communication before and during our stay to make sure everything went smoothly.

The apartment was super clean and basically looked brand new. The location can't be beat! We didn't bother with a rental car and just walked or took Uber where we needed to go. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat."
7506165,42954037,2015-08-16,38803472,Nancy,"My family and I recently stayed at Morgan and Michael's amazing downtown Seattle apartment. We were a bit hesitant as this trip was our first time using Airbnb rather than using a traditional hotel. My first impression upon walking into the apartment was ""WOW""!! The place was modern, immaculate, nicely decorated, and had great views. The check in process was super easy and our host, Morgan surprised us with a bottle of wine.

Positives about this place:
- comfortable beds/bedding (one of which was a King size which you don't often find)
- spacious bathroom
- kitchen with all the utensils and cookware needed to make a proper meal. In fact, we cooked two meals with fresh ingredients purchased from Pike's place.
- great rooftop views; there is a lounge area that has amazing views of the city and water. We had dessert and wine there one night and it was spectacular.
- the unit was great for a family of 4 needing a bit more room than a hotel can offer.
- everything was super clean
- this place has Air Conditioning which was a huge plus on the warmer days;
- close to everything. Walking distance to Pike's Place, ferries, shops, and restaurants.

Negatives about this place:
- Parking is very limited and was a bit of a pain as it was street parking. It became costly if you are sightseeing by foot and need to have your car parked most of the day.
- The surrounding area got a bit deserted and quiet at night so we were just a bit more cautious when walking around but we never felt unsafe.

Overall, this place was amazing. We felt at home the entire time. Morgan was a great host and even checked in with us the following day to make sure we were comfortable and didn't need anything. We'll definitely come back to Seattle and stay here again. Thanks Morgan and Michael!"
7506165,43731657,2015-08-21,37043849,Kim,Morgan's apartment was perfect! Close to tourist attractions and a great place to stay. The apartment is beautiful and the roof deck is awesome. I would absolutely stay here again!
7506165,43982557,2015-08-23,1037266,Corey,Fantastic city views.  Fireworks view over SafeCo!  Morgan is attentive and responsive.     Had a self inflating air mattress delivered for my little girls.  Roof deck is excellent.  Three days minimum needed to experience the area.
7506165,46614896,2015-09-12,717879,Bob,"This is a great apartment in a great location. 
Very convenient for the Bainbridge Island ferry and the light rail link to Seattle airport from Pioneer Square station.
The apartment is as described and was very comfortable in all respects.
Our hosts were very accommodating with our earlier than normal check in time and our departure time.
Rooftop area has stunning views over the water - this is not to be missed at any time of the day.
Would definitely stay there again. "
7506165,48581338,2015-09-27,43096400,Andrea,"Everything about this place was awesome!! I was nervous getting into the building since we arrived late and had to tell the concierge we were staying there, but there was no problem. The place was very nice, clean, and modern. The beds were so comfortable too!! We can't wait to go back to Seattle and stay here again!"
7506165,49747246,2015-10-05,4238460,Erik,Daniella was very accommodating and the apartment was lovely. Loved the big windows and large flatscreen TV. Rooftop views spectacular. 
723846,3451200,2013-02-01,2511088,Tara,"I rented this cute little cottage for two months.  The space is very clean and the design is very well thought out.  It is quiet, peaceful, quaint, and in a safe area.  You will not find better hosts, Cheryl and Steve are incredibly nice and accommodating.  Their house sits in front of the cottage and are easily reachable should you need them, but you will feel 100% in your own world.  Absolutely a fantastic space and amazing family!"
723846,4426912,2013-05-05,4050090,Liz,"Staying at the Seattle Cozy Cottage was a delightful experience. Cheryl and Steve are amazingly gracious hosts and seem to have thought of everything to make a stay here comfortable and stress-free. The clean, modern, and efficient studio space is well-designed and is outfitted with everything you need for a short or long-term stay. There are a lot of thoughtful touches in the studio -- from the wall of windows that looks out to the private garden and the skylight above the bed for stargazing, to the well-stocked kitchen and off-street parking space. There's even a washer/dryer in the unit.

The Maple Leaf location is a convenient home base for a visit to Seattle while still offering a quiet and private place to kick back and relax. I will absolutely stay at the Seattle Cozy Cottage again and I recommend it for anyone looking for a five-star stay on their next visit to Seattle!"
723846,4655168,2013-05-18,5775807,David,Awesome place and very accommodating hosts. I will return again

723846,6749457,2013-08-24,1619980,Aaron,"We lived here for three months during my internship; it was perfect for us! It's only a 15 min. bus commute (77 express route) or 30 min. bike ride downtown. Steve and Cheryl were sooooo generous and kind and helped us with anything we needed. We had our son while we were in Seattle, and they were so helpful with everything. The cottage is clean, very modern, has everything you need to live comfortably. The neighborhood is great, lots of stuff nearby. Highly recommend the cottage to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in a great location."
723846,6914028,2013-08-30,7209453,Phil,"We found the Cozy Cottage to be delightful and very
Scandinavian.  It remidended us of a relative's summer home in Southern Sweden.  The finishing touches were very nice and having coffee and tea avaialble was thoughtful, even decaf.  To make it even better it is just a short walk to our daughter's home in Maple Leaf.  Steve and Cheryl were extremely nice and helpful.  We hope to stay in the Cozy Cottage again

723846,7071680,2013-09-05,1726011,Katie,"Great place to stay! Had everything and more that we needed to make our trip just perfect. Cheryl and Steve were great hosts and provided us with great ideas for sightseeing options in the city. The location was closer to the city than we expected as well. Also, a lot of options for shops/restaurants within walking distance of the cottage"
723846,7446397,2013-09-20,5775807,David,"Thanks to Cheryl and Steve for the quiet, clean and well-appointed place.  No wonder they are popular.  "
723846,7572504,2013-09-24,5775807,David,Always a quiet and comfortable place the neighborhood was wonderful to walk in. Great restaurants nearby. Wonderful hosts
723846,9379194,2013-12-25,5787223,Matt,"The cottage worked out fantastically during a 3-month internship at UWMC.  Easy and enjoyable commuting by bike or bus, convenient access to food and drink (including a great (email hidden) & 15th Ave), views of the Olympic and Cascade mountains from 95th St, beautiful library within walking distance, proximity to multiple green spaces, and overall calm amidst the bustle.

Cheryl and Steve were incredibly generous and discreet, which is a great combination when living in such close quarters.  I felt very much at home during my stay and hope to be back in Seattle soon. "
723846,10935826,2014-03-14,10023231,Andrew,The cozy cottage was a great place for my extended stay in Seattle.  The hosts were fantastic and everything was perfect.
723846,11345322,2014-03-31,11201084,Susan,"I had a wonderful visit to my family in Seattle thanks to the Cozy Cottage.  It was just as wonderful and spacious feeling as it appeared in the photos.  since it was two blocks from my daughter and three from my grandson's school, I was able to walk to most everything I needed.  When necessary I found taking the bus quite easy (or even calling a taxi).  Everything was thoughtfully arranged and directions were complete.  If I needed anything Steve and/or Cheryl responded immediately.  The Kauffman family was generous in allowing my grandson's to visit, play in the yard and even join them for a card game one warm evening!  All in all, I would highly recommend the Cozy Cottage!"
723846,18779833,2014-09-01,5690373,Shannon,"Mike and I spent a 5-month rental at the Cozy Cottage hosted by Cheryl & Steve. We stayed here after moving our of our own home in Seattle and before leaving on a big trip. Both Cheryl & Steve were very welcoming and gracious hosts. It was a perfect balance of available when needed but we didn't feel as if they were hovering. The cottage was exactly as advertised and we loved it. The high ceilings make it seem much bigger than it is. We had a lot of things with us and yet there was room for it all to be either hidden away (under the tall bed) or put in cabinets. We were impressed with how much space there was. All our visitors agreed the space was great. It was an easy walk/bus-ride to downtown for work and the nearby park was great. I would highly recommend this rental and, again, Cheryl & Steve were great. "
723846,19505405,2014-09-13,21194727,Carol,"Cheryl and Steve welcomed me to Seattle with a beautiful snack basket and a cute welcome note.  They also texted me when the cottage was ready, made me feel so welcome on such short notice. The cottage had everything and more of what I was expecting - from laundry to dishwasher to full kitchen outfittings. Bed was super comfy and I love the privacy of it all, not disturbing the host when I got there late and left early for a work meeting. Most of all, Cheryl and Steve took me in on super short notice (less than 12 hours) and made me feel so welcomed. I can't wait to go back again!"
723846,19697162,2014-09-16,4407826,Christine,Cheryl and Steve were great hosts! Wonderful snacks upon arrival. The cottage is beautiful and quiet. There are restaurants and bars to walk to in the neighborhood and a wonderful park just a few blocks away.  I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle.
723846,19964773,2014-09-21,3958402,Cheyenne,"The cozy cottage was everything I had hoped for and more! I stayed for a little less than a week following an out patient surgery procedure and chose it because of its fair price, serenity, and distance from the busy center of the city. I found it incredibly clean, beautiful, and perfectly set up for someone of limited mobility. The hosts were incredibly sweet as well! Welcoming me with a basket of goodies and plentiful information. They were even so attentive as to notice that my itinerary was titled ""surgery,"" and let me know ahead of time that the bed might be a little high for comfort. The bed ended up being fine and my stay was absolutely wonderful!"
723846,20073506,2014-09-22,21468543,Kara,Truly a cozy cottage. Loved my quick visit and appreciated the little extra work put in by Cheryl and Steve to make sure our stay was enjoyable. Would absolutely stay here again. 
723846,22287298,2014-11-03,1033506,Mark,"The cottage is exactly as described and pictured. Public transportation is nearby and easy to use, especially if you use the Google Maps App. A grocery, pharmacy, local restaurants and coffee shops are all near by.  I stayed for 6 weeks and experienced my first autumn in many years.  I travel 8 months a years on business and use Airbnb often, Cheryl and Steve rate right up at the top as hosts in the business."
723846,23369612,2014-11-30,22305780,Peter,"Our stay was totally enjoyable.  The neighborhood was a lovely quiet one. The cottage was exactly as described and just what we needed, at a great price.   We really appreciated the welcome basket with fruit and snacks, and being able to make fresh coffee each morning (with real half and half from the fridge!).  We would definitely stay here again!"
723846,26661358,2015-02-16,24430008,Kevin,"We stayed at the cottage overnight for Valentine's day, and we loved it! It was very quiet and beautiful. Cheryl and Steve were very helpful and communicative during our stay. Thanks for having us! Definitely adding the cottage to our short list for when we need a home away from home. "
723846,27239039,2015-02-28,14018905,Justin,The cottage is exactly as described and pictured.  Cheryl was a lovely host.  Perfect stay overall.  
723846,27844333,2015-03-13,28079365,Donald,"Our hosts Cheryl & Steve are wonderful people. They met us on arrival, had everything ready to make us feel welcome and comfortable.
We come from Singapore and are here on holidays as well as to welcome our first grandchild that our daughter was delivering.
Staying at the fine cottage in a quiet neighbourhood, near our daughter's place was awesome."
723846,29485493,2015-04-08,11201084,Susan,"On my second visit to Seattle Cozy Cottage, my suggestion from the previous visit had been addressed and the bed was much improved - thank you Cheryl and Steve!  The Kauffman's are friendly and welcoming, but not intrusive.  I felt that I could ask any questions or make requests if needed.  I enjoyed my second visit and the beautiful red tulips that graced the front of the cottage."
723846,30764961,2015-04-27,26771686,Tim & Penny,"Cheryl and Steve were superb hosts in every way and the cottage was exactly as described, warm, cosy and quiet.  After a long and tiring flight from New Zealand we so appreciated the lovely basket of goodies to tuck into and a comfortable bed!  Our family plus beautiful new grandson live just around the corner so it was a perfect location for us as we could walk backwards and forwards to each other in about five minutes.  Loved the red tulips out the front as well!  
Thanks Cheryl and Steve for your awesome communication, hospitality and lovely baking - we'll be back!"
723846,34135343,2015-06-05,31718850,Martin,The description is accurate. My stay was very comfortable. Cheryl & Steve are accommodating hosts. I recommend their cottage. I will stay again if I could.
723846,34945887,2015-06-14,15141116,Bill,"The three of us had a wonderful, week-long stay at the Cozy Cottage. The space was very comfortable and clean, and looks just like the photos. Cheryl and Steve were both very friendly and accommodating. We arrived late in the evening, but it was very easy to park on the street and super convenient to use the electronic lock. It happened to be unseasonably warm during the day, but when we opened the windows and doors we had a nice breeze which kept the cottage cool. At night, there were plenty of pillows and blankets to keep us warm and cozy, and both beds were super comfy. We didn't end up using the stove or dish washer (too many great places to eat!) but it was nice knowing we had the option. The washer and dryer in the unit was such a huge plus! The TV and wifi were great to have at night when winding down and getting ready for bed- We were able to login with our Netflix account on the TV! Yes! It is a bit of a drive from the touristy areas of Seattle, but I'm so glad we stayed here. If you are looking for a quiet place outside of the downtown area with all the amenities of a stylish studio apartment, I highly recommend. "
723846,35466933,2015-06-19,31715578,Esther,"Cheryl and Steve made ample communication to prepare our accommodations. This was our first real trip to Seattle and our hosts created a lot of helpful recommendations to make it memorable and worthwhile. We also appreciated their very clear set of instructions on how to make our stay comfortable for everyone. The neighborhood was peaceful and very friendly. Cafes, convenient stores and bus stops are within walking distance. Parking was easy. Finally, the cottage was clean, modern and comfortable. "
723846,35803716,2015-06-22,32292316,Jake,"Our experiance with Cheryl was absolutely incredible. They were out of state during our visit, but ensured all was properly prepared for our stay. The cottage itself is amazingly cute, and I could not stop commenting how cool it was to my wife. "
723846,36184394,2015-06-26,4005712,Kristen,"Super cute place - very comfortable & clean!  We had a great time here!  

-If you are short (like me), getting in and out of the tall bed might be a challenge, but still manageable.

We ate outside in their cute garden and had some of their raspberries and blueberries that were just starting to ripen (bonus!!!).  

If we ever get back to Seattle, this is where we'll stay!
"
723846,36824353,2015-07-01,34223323,Lysander,The cozy cottage was exactly as it is described. Very Cozy! Cherl was very accommodating as everything was well listed and prepared for our stay. The cottage is also equipped for all necessities. It is well-located from downtown Seattle and other sites our family visited. Our stay was perfect and contributed our relaxing visit to Seattle. We would definitely stay with them again in the future.
723846,40583988,2015-08-01,26873752,Russell,"We felt very welcome by our hosts.  There were fresh flowers on the table and some goodies.  When we arrived, our hosts were on their front porch so it made for a warm welcom"
723846,41773489,2015-08-09,34532625,Mary Beth,We arrived to a clean and comfortable little house and found delicious local treats and information about the area.  We used the bus service to get around and I must say that it is a little slow but reliable.  
723846,42164810,2015-08-11,20896747,Beth,Cheryl and Steve were great hosts. They made us feel welcome but were not intrusive. The neighborhood is quiet and residential but not far from downtown Seattle. 
723846,42455150,2015-08-13,17693578,Sarah,We LOVED staying here!!  The cottage is amazing.  We loved learning how it was built as well :-)  Cheryl and Steve were very welcoming and even left us delicious brownies and some fruit!  I would HIGHLY recommend staying here!!
723846,43030897,2015-08-17,26001644,Craig,"This is a great cottage. It is cozy with lots of natural light. High-quality new construction. Cheryl and Steve were very nice, and we were greeted with a care basket of fruits and chocolate! They even had root beer and a new carton of half-and-half waiting in the fridge. Maple Leaf is a great residential neighborhood, and the location is convenient to most parts of Seattle. The location is also super easy to get to and from the airport using light rail and Seattle’s great bus system. The waiting time for an Uber was quite low. Great place!"
723846,44150925,2015-08-24,11225119,Cory,"Cheryl and Steve were extremely easy to stay in contact with and had the place set up for us when we got there. The cottage is exactly like the photos - absolutely beautiful, and they've even added a few extra things, like outdoor lights that fade on when you walk up to the door at night. There were snacks and beverages to drink if we were hungry and the bed was extremely comfortable and warm. They were quick to reply to any texts we sent and were easy to check out with.

The neighborhood was nice to walk around in and the bus was easy to catch into the downtown area. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again! I wish we could've stayed longer. "
723846,50283176,2015-10-11,35073006,Katie,"I stayed at the cottage for 5 weeks and loved it! Cheryl and Steve were very welcoming and thoughtful, and always easy to get a hold of if I ever needed anything. The neighborhood was great as well - lots of things within walking distance. The next time I'm in Seattle, I will definitely be staying here again!  "
723846,51799306,2015-10-24,38963401,Samantha & Andrew,"Wonderful!!! My husband and I stayed in the cozy cottage and loved how nice, modern, and private it was! Cheryl and Steve were always very quick with responses to any questions we had throughout our stay. We also loved the cottage handbook/folder with information on local businesses in the Maple Leaf neighborhood. We would definitely recommend the Seattle Cozy Cottage to anyone visiting the area! "
723846,52349271,2015-10-28,46124043,Osamu,"とてもかわいらしくて、本当にcozyなコテージでした。　一人旅で気楽に泊まりたい人には最適な選択肢だと思います。

Cheryl さんもとってもチャーミングで親切でしたよ。助かりました。

It was really ""cozy cottage"", and I liked it so much. I would defenately recommend to who travel North Seattle area alone.

Cheryl was very charming and kind. She was a good help for me.
"
723846,53263818,2015-11-07,46031237,Dale,"Cheryl met us as the shuttle pulled up and took us on a tour immediately. She asked that we let her know of anything they could do to make our visit better. We only had one issue and Steve took care of it quickly. You couldn't ask for more responsive, helpful hosts. The cottage was homey, quiet and comfortable. We won't hesitate to stay again on our next visit to Seattle."
723846,54027239,2015-11-15,22345060,Amanda,"We had a wonderful stay at the cottage! It immediately felt like home and was super clean. Cheryl and Steve prepared a nice little welcome basket with snacks which was very thoughtful. Overall we loved the cottage and Seattle and I wish we could have stayed longer. 
"
723846,54286719,2015-11-17,918867,Debbie,"Cheryl and Steve's cozy cottage was a small sanctuary in the city for me and my daughter while visiting Seattle. Located in a cute, safe and convenient neighborhood in North Seattle, the cottage is everything one could ask for and more. It is spotlessly clean, stylish and has all the amenities you would ever need. Not only that, but Cheryl left snacks, which is definitely the way to a girl's heart. After being in the car all day, I was also able to walk to nearby restaurants and cafes for my meals."
723846,55722403,2015-12-05,2833026,Mandy,"Cheryl greeted me upon my arrival and gave me a quick tour of the cottage. I enjoyed my stay and especially enjoyed reading in the nook where the bed is. There is plenty of light in the cottage. The lights outside the cottage are especially charming (you'll know what I mean when you see them).  
The Cottage was very clean. Cheryl and Steve have put a lot of hard work and love into its construction and it shows!
The location is really close to the I-5 which made it very convenient for me to get around. The neighbourhood is quiet and there are restaurants and cafe's within walking distance. I would recommend staying at the Seattle Cozy Cottage if you are looking for a place in the area. "
5615620,30271605,2015-04-19,22350871,Chris,"Amazing location and wonderful neighborhood, easy access to mass transit and so many things within walking distance.  I imagine it would be tough to find a more convenient location.  Apartment was clean and the host was very friendly.  I didn't spend much time in the apartment but I was very comfortable and it was nice to be able to look out the window and take in downtown.  "
5615620,30588420,2015-04-24,15344655,Clare,The flat had everything I needed for a good stay. Clean and comfortable. Helpful host - happy to give advice on things to see/ do in Seattle. The location is very central and ideal for exploring the market. Shuttle from the airport stops close by - so easy to reach.
5615620,30744304,2015-04-26,20405829,Eric,We stayed for one night and all went well. It's a very simple place but also functional and in a good location. Access to many of Seattle's attractions were within easy walking distance. Jesse met us on-time and gave us an intro to the place and some good tips on what to see in the area. There's a decent TV/monitor with Netflix which also came in handy for a late night movie. We'd stay there again. 
5615620,30953074,2015-04-29,3774320,James,Excellent host and space! Great view of downtown Seattle and literally 1 minute away from Pike Place. Clean and comfortable. 
5615620,31234218,2015-05-03,31368649,Daniel,"The host was very helpful throughout the entire process: toured the place together, always responded to messages, and provided plenty of accommodations, including Wifi and a Roku. The place was perfect for me being a short walk to my conference center, and I had a blast at Pike Place Market which is less than two blocks away!

It was my first airbnb experience and had a very smooth experience. Definitely recommend!"
5615620,32195891,2015-05-15,22217769,Marko,The location of this place can't be beat. Walking distance to everything. Pikes place is literally a block away. The apartment itself has everything you need. The hosts were great and check in and check out was smooth and easy. 
5615620,32707239,2015-05-20,18704249,Jocely,"Jesse was a great host! He was so helpful and courteous. Best thing about his apartment was LOCATION! Literally one block away from the Pike market, a very short walk from the shopping center and monorail station, 15-20 min walk to the space needle, and short walk to all the bars in Belltown. His place was super clean and easily accessible. It had all the amenities we needed in the room. We were able to use his Roku for Netflix and even listening to Pandora. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5615620,33119084,2015-05-25,31479062,Doug,Jes was very accommodating and provided an excellent apartment at a great value.  I highly recommend choosing his place for your Seattle stay.  It's one block from Pike Market and it has incredible views!  
5615620,33730356,2015-05-31,18114826,New,"Our experience here was fantastic! Location could not have been better-- super easy to walk anywhere or catch a bus. Jesse was super nice and helpful. The place was clean, convenient, and surprisingly super quiet in the mornings for being right downtown! I would highly recommend it and will definitely stay here again if we are back in Seattle! "
5615620,33970051,2015-06-02,14717665,Zachary,"Establishment as described. Great View! Host was easy to contact and flexible, Thanks guys! I'll be back!"
5615620,34079894,2015-06-04,7557053,Jim,"Jes was a very accommodating host. His place is very cozy and clean, and it is in a great location. It is just a block from Pike Place market. If you are looking to stay near the market or downtown area this is a great place to stay. "
5615620,34255407,2015-06-06,33681438,Travis And Barah,"Jes was right on time to let us in, very accommodating, and super friendly! The location is phenomenal!! It's literally a block from the famous market and we were overwhelmed with all the awesome things to do within a 2-5 minute walk!! Found the cheapest parking in all of downtown 2 blocks away! If you want to check out downtown Seattle and all it has to offer, this is the place to stay! "
5615620,34963259,2015-06-14,31615110,Veronica,Jes and Ashley were always quick to respond to my communication.  Their flexibility to meet me was greatly appreciated.  The location of their place was incredibly close to the market.  Plenty of reasonably priced parking around.  Appreciated the filtered water in the fridge.  It was great to grab a quick drink when we arrived as we were parched from travel.
5615620,35218842,2015-06-16,31999836,Megan,Awesome location! Exactly what we were looking for. 
5615620,35564593,2015-06-20,32906772,Kade,Jes and Ashley were very accommodating. Location is unbelievable. Not cheap but if you're looking to be in the action this is the place. 
5615620,35985886,2015-06-23,647999,Karl,"The location of this place is unbeatable. It is downtown, and it right next to the Pike Place Fish Market; that got old fast, but there are a number of great points right around there, and it is a quick walk to several other big neighborhoods.

Jesse met me there in the evening and gave me a thorough tour of the place. I felt quite welcome. As can be seen in the pictures, it is a small studio, and it seemed like it was one of the better apartments in a complex. It was exactly what I was expecting though. It was quite hot while I was there for Seattle, and the many windows in the unit made it quite easy to cool down.

I really had no issues. Considering the location and views, it was a great experience."
5615620,36295434,2015-06-27,14652667,Kathryn,Great stay! The place is in a great location and had everything we needed. 
5615620,36672368,2015-06-30,28185459,Maya,Everything was perfect. Jesse was a great and very accommodating host. The apartment was in the best location and we literally could walk to everything we wanted to do and see. I would definitely recommend this Jesse and his Pike Place apartment. 
5615620,37169234,2015-07-05,3200788,Kathryn,"Host was awesome! Super communicative, walked us through the space, and gave us the ins and outs of the space. "
5615620,37971593,2015-07-12,15236218,Greg,"Everything was great.  The place was very comfortable, the location is fantastic, and Jes was extremely helpful meeting us, getting us oriented, and providing resources."
5615620,38391202,2015-07-15,33651631,Bob,"Location, location, location. This apt is perfectly located downtown by pikes market. I attended the mozcon at the conference center and this place was in walking distance of all the activities associated with the conference. It was also really convenient having a grocery store a block away (Target). "
5615620,39012420,2015-07-20,33969702,Kevin,"Our host met my wife promptly, and was extremely polite, accomodating and ready to help with anything we may need. The apartment was clean and had the simple needs we required for our stay. We'd definitely recommend it to others! Thanks!"

So wonderful!!!"
5615620,39923326,2015-07-27,32621668,Allison,"Awesome apartment! Perfect for two people. Jesse was super sweet and accommodating. Location was amazing, down the block from Pikes Market and great restaurants. Money well spent "
5615620,40447522,2015-07-31,34310032,Sue,Jes was a great host.  He gave us all kinds of tips for exploring the neighborhood.  Apartment was a perfect location for enjoying Pike Place Market and close to public transportation.
5615620,41197481,2015-08-05,31622872,Stefanie,"The place was exactly as advertised,  clean, neat and well stoked with essential items, even razors. It was the perfect way to experience downtown Seattle and pikes place market. They were prompt on meeting up to hand over the keys and they were very helpful."
5615620,41345698,2015-08-07,19502167,Carissa,Great location! Ryan was very friendly and gave us some great recommendations. 
5615620,42385473,2015-08-13,26583437,Emily,"I was met by Jes and he was very accommodating, especially considering my flight delay.  Couldn't have been nicer and made sure to show me how the TV, internet, and locks worked.  The apartment is a true studio so it really does only fit two people comfortably - this was perfect for my travels though.  The location was spectacular!!  I really cannot stress how wonderful the location was!  The apartment was comfortable and everything I needed was accessible.  I felt safe at night and the surrounding areas seemed safe to me too (for those interested in night/club activities).  I didn't need it but the apartment does have AC (a plus this summer) and there is more than adequate ventilation so the apartment is not stuffy at all.  I really enjoyed being able to have the windows open.  Had no issues at all and highly recommend this apartment!  Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
5615620,42949912,2015-08-16,33602032,Brian,Ryan was very friendly and welcoming. He met us outside the unit even though it was late at night as our flight had us landing at 11PM. The unit is exactly as described and was perfect for our short stay. He even has a map on the wall of the downtown area that is really great for getting your bearings in a new city. It has a great view of the nearby pier and is a stones throw away from the Market and any conceivable form of public transportation. Our stay in Seattle was a wonderful experience. 
5615620,43919381,2015-08-23,21484909,Hongyang,"This is a great place, the location is unbeatable, aprt is clean and comfort!"
5615620,45401000,2015-09-02,22333708,Lauren,You can't beat this location in Seattle. Ryan was very accommodating and you can't improve on the convenience and ease of this listing. 
5615620,45980128,2015-09-07,40197043,Jordan,Ryan was incredibly welcoming and gave great advice on the local area.  The apartment was just as described and the location could not have been better.  We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go.  The apartment is literally right next to Pike Place Market.  We truly enjoyed our stay and the surrounding area.
5615620,46268410,2015-09-09,18049163,Shirley,"This was my first BNB experience and it was 100% positive. Ryan met us , showed us the accommodation, and a very detailed handy map of the area. Location could not have been better. Walking distance to many attractions. Was wonderful to sit in the morning and look out over the water while enjoying morning coffee.accommodation more than adequate. Building extremely quiet.every small appliance one could want. Full size fridge and stove.  Love the ninja blender. Came in very handy. All in all I cannot say enough about our experience. Many thanks to our hosts. Would highly recommend this Air BnB listing to anyone. "
5615620,46580400,2015-09-12,32015854,Cassidy,"Amazing location! A block from the Pike's place market with a view of the Bay. Very comfy bed too. Overall, great stay in Seattle! "
5615620,47267076,2015-09-17,14371286,Bill,"My stay was terrific.  Ryan was on time for check-in, helpful and nice.  I've been to Seattle many times, but this was my first Airbnb Seattle experience, and I'll never go back to staying in a hotel there again.  "
5615620,47741477,2015-09-21,426724,Kacy,"We'll never stay anywhere else in Seattle.  This place was perfect.  The studio was nicely appointed, spacious, and efficient.  It's everything you'd need for any length of stay.  The location, though, was what made this place unbeatable.  The view from his top story window showed Pike Place Market just one block away.  I woke up early, crossed the street before the crowds showed up, and picked up a variety of fresh foods from some different vendors.  After the 30 second walk back to the room, I fired up the frying pan and made a wonderful breakfast.  It was a great experience.  I only wish we could have stayed longer.  

As a host, Ryan was amazing.  He was very thoughtful, gave a nice orientation, and a had a lot of nice little lagniappes here and there.  He also encouraged us to give him as much feedback as possible on how to make the place even better.  He's what every Airbnb host should aspire to be. "
5615620,48608918,2015-09-27,44218434,Alex,"Had a great time in Seattle, the apartment is close to everything in downtown. Ryan was very helpful and answered any questions/concerns I've had very promptly. He even offered a partial refund himself when there was a small issue. I would definitely stay there again!"
5615620,49051956,2015-09-30,44308171,Charlie,"First, upon meeting Ryan, he was very friendly and polite.  As a first-timer using Airbnb, I felt I could trust my choice.
The description was accurate, great location and the neighborhood was excellent."
5615620,50409160,2015-10-11,29828770,Shai,"Ryan's apartment was great - cozy and convenient, right across the street from Pike Market. It had everything we needed (and more), and made us wish we stayed there longer. The location is absolutely great, and Ryan had nice tips and recommendations for things to see and do within a walking distance. We'll definitely be back on our next visit to Seattle. "
5615620,51154834,2015-10-18,36373427,Leslie,"Great central location, steps from the market & close to numerous great cafes, bakeries & coffee shops.  Ryan was very helpful. The space was small but comfortable & perfectly accommodating. Great view from kitchen area. Recommended for the adventurous traveler!"
5615620,51560676,2015-10-21,1632013,John,"Apt location was great. Close to market!  Can't beat 1 block. Internet was fast. Has roku for watching videos. Windows/walls are pretty thin, could hear music from other apts or the trash cars in the street, but not too bad."
5615620,52016495,2015-10-25,46559978,Matthew,Ashley and Ryan's place was perfect for my needs.     The location can't be beat- just a short block from Pike's Market and the rest of downtown.     The place was quiet and comfortable and Ashley and Ryan were easy to work with and quite accommodating to my schedule.    Would recommend and use again!   
5615620,52533988,2015-10-30,27270030,Kent,"I must say this is an interesting place. Overall I liked it. A couple of Plus and Minus thoughts to consider. The bed. Although comfortable it sits right on the floor. No Frame, so if you are not so nimble, getting up will be difficult. The carpet needs a good shampooing. The flat is basic. Very basic. Internet TV only, but all your needs are met. The hosts, and I only met Ryan, have the apartment well stocked with everything you need. The location for tourists is perfect. You are one block from the greatest market in America. There is lots to see around the area from that point. And the view from the kitchen window is very good. A safe building and area to stay.  If you want to experience the Kurt Cobain small apartment style of visiting Seattle  at a great price, this is the place."
5615620,53358201,2015-11-08,46039527,Jennifer,"Ryan was very accommodating to my check in time. I had a later flight and it was going to take me about an hour to get to downtown. He came down and escorted me to his studio. Once inside the studio, he showed me around, explained everything, and even gave me some tips! The location is perfect! So close to the Pike Place Market, aquarium, and even the space needle! I was able to walk everywhere I had on my list of things to do. "
5615620,53908610,2015-11-14,2477217,Jackie,It was a great apartment in a perfect location. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Ryan was great and gave us a lot of tips and recommendations about the city. Great communication and flexible check in/out times. Thanks again! 
5615620,54611982,2015-11-22,24796998,Dennis,"Location, location, location describes this place. Half a block from Pike Place Market, easy walk from the light rail, reasonable hike from the waterfront and the Great Seattle Wheel, etc, etc, etc. 
Ryan actually gave us an unneeded refund when he was delayed from meeting us due to traffic. A nice gesture.
Cozy and small but well stocked in a secure building. If you're looking for a convenient base of operations at a good price check this place out. "
5615620,55094962,2015-11-28,34396275,Brittany,"This place was exactly what I wanted, experiencing the ""city living"" was amazing. It's exactly how it's described, everything is walking distance from the Ferris wheel, to Pikes Place to the space needle! And no uber costed more than $8. We even messed up a little on the checkout time and he was totally cool about it! Super nice guy, even helps you out on all the hot spots near by. There is a target right around the corner about a block away if you need anything! Kitchen had all the essentials for a small meal. The view of the water was great, even when I wasn't expecting any view. I'm easily cold, and there is only a space heater which warms up the bedroom great Id just get some slippers for the rest of the place! Highly recommended! We're definitely coming back. Thank you!"
5615620,55575595,2015-12-02,9034942,Kyla,"You really can't beat the location of this apartment. It's very much ""no frills"" so if you're looking for an upscale apartment with a gourmet kitchen you should keep looking. If you're looking for a short walk to Pike Place Market and downtown Seattle, this place is ideal. It was clean, inexpensive and the host was very nice and very accommodating.  There are several reasonably priced garages nearby if you rent a car. We would definitely stay here again."
5615620,55977900,2015-12-07,10078435,Zackary,"This was one of THEE BEST places I've stayed with Airbnb. It got the description and was everything I needed while i stayed in Seattle. The location was right next to Pike's Place and walking distance to EVERYTHING in downtown Seattle. 

The apartment itself was perfect. I loved how the kitchen was a hidden nook in the ""back"" it gave it a really quaint homey feel. The view from the window in there was beautiful, you could see the ferris wheel against the backdrop of the bay. I would book here again in a heart beat."
5615620,56229195,2015-12-10,50594927,Travis,"Ryan made sure I had everything I needed and more. We didn't have time to be buddies because of busy schedules, but I could tell they genuinely cared about my comfort. The place was really great overall. Very clean, organized, and cozy. And overall great stay. Thanks once again."
5615620,56625227,2015-12-15,5707021,John,"My girlfriend and I had a great time here. The location was everything and the room had all one needs for a comfortable stay. Ryan was very pleasant and thorough during the greeting. Just a great, seamless experience-the way it should be with AirBnb."

3533112,17060792,2014-08-06,17974531,Elena,"We had such a great vacation in this studio while we were in Seattle, very tastefully decorated, and has just the right amount of everything. This place is the best use of a small amount of space that I've ever experienced. We also got welcoming flowers and little bottle of champagne. So sweet! My husband and I usually stay in hotel, it was our first rental property experience, and we felt very lucky that we were able to call this place home while we were discovering Seattle. Thank you again for a wonderful stay!"
3533112,17296974,2014-08-10,9516707,Heidi,"We did not meet Melissa but arrival and check-out was smooth and easy. The studio is very nice, newly remodeled, very clean and equipped with all your needs. Centrally located to visit all Seattle and surroundings, on the edge of Capital Hill with not a lot in walking distance. We had a car so it was perfect!"

I didn't get a chance to meet her because of my schedule, but she made our travel arrangements very convenient. The studio was really clean and looked exactly like the photos, I highly recommend staying here! "

3533112,40167926,2015-07-28,22844362,Marc,"Had a perfect stay at Matthew's Studio. Everything is like in the description and the bed is very comfortable.There was breakfast (juice, eggs, bagels etc.) in the fridge for us. It was also very very very clean. There are 3 different bus lines/stations next to the studio, which takes you to downtown in 35 minutes. Check-in/-out was easy. I would definitely stay here again."
3533112,41489218,2015-08-07,39536310,Franco,"The location was really good, comfortable and with everything you need. It's also near the city center in a strategically position to visit Seattle. Unfortunately I never met Matthew but he helped me immediately by email when I asked something. I suggest it with a pleasure like a perfect accommodation."
3533112,41856094,2015-08-09,5929869,Anita,"Easy access to downtown (we took Lyft and Uber, it was $5-8, for three of us cheaper than the bus) but also Capitol Hill. Walking distance to grocery store, Farmer's Market (Friday 3-7 pm) and GREAT bakery (Golden Wheat I think) around the corner. Lots of Ethiopian restaurants and a Thai restaurant just around the corner. Otherwise everything as described and very flexible host, thanks!"
3533112,42323634,2015-08-12,32803168,Stephanie,"Matthews' place was PERFECTION! Originally we were looking for something right in downtown, but this was even better!! It was so close to everything we planned on visiting like the Space Needle, Pikes, Safeco Field and a few others. We were very pleasantly surprised to see that 1/4 of a mile down the road was Grocery Outlet! Our favorite grocery store! We were able to go shopping for breakfast items, dinner items, and snack items since we hadn't planned on eating every meal out. Matthews' house was perfect for my husband and I for sleeping, cooking, and lounging before bed. We were out alot during the day's but it was a very nice feeling walking in the door after a long day of exploring. We were really surprised with a bottle of wine, chocolates, and a cars wishing us a happy anniversary!! It was the nicest gesture that they didn't have to do but did and it was very sweet and made our trip extra special. We will be booking again sometime in the future for sure!!!"
3533112,45160583,2015-08-31,25964333,Kyle,"I had a great time in Seattle thanks in large part to this convenient and comfortable studio. The location was easily accessible with only about  five minute uber ride into downtown. The amenities were great and had everything I needed for my trip. Although I never met Matthew, he was more than helpful working with my scheduling. I'd stay here again."
458197,1378271,2012-05-29,2239243,Chao,"Chris is a super nice and interesting person, although we did not see each other too often. We arrived 1 am and he is still waiting and help us enter the house (of course you shouldn't arrive so late). The location is so good that you are actually living in the Broadway. Tons of nice shops, restaurants in front of your door. I personally like the harmonic Asian/Chinese decorations in the house. The house is clean, kitchen is big, living room too. Nice to meet people in/out the house if you are around."
458197,3643734,2013-02-26,580537,Ryan,"This was a perfect spot to stay while visiting Seattle. This is a very professionally maintained hostel-type place that is beautiful, clean and in a good location on Capitol Hill. We did not have a car but this place is within easy to moderate walking distance of Belltown, downtown, and is along easily accessible bus routes to Fremont/Wallingford or to downtown. Would definitely stay here again!"
458197,4351595,2013-04-29,6016596,Meredith,"It appears to be a small rental with a separate entrance on the posting but far from it.  Sharing a bathroom with over a dozen people was not my intention.  The walls are also very thin so you can here everyone on the floor and below as well.  I would not recommend this, or any rooms at this house.  It is essentially an overpriced hostel.  "
458197,6311318,2013-08-07,6777341,Nicola,"We were passing through Seattle and this room was perfect for us. The house represented great value for money when we needed somewhere to lay our heads. The room was clean and fresh and there were thoughtful touches throughout the house, especially the girls' dressing room downstairs! Chris himself was a lovely guy, very friendly and gave us plenty of information and advice on where to go.  We can confirm that Liberty serves fantastic cocktails and Vivace, the most amazing coffee and (shamefully, for us Brits!) loose leaf teas.
The neighbourhood was supercool and relaxed, we felt very safe wandering around. I slept well and comfortably. If I were rooming with a friend again, and had the pleasure of visiting Seattle,  I'd happily return to our slumber party room!"
458197,7316601,2013-09-15,8660298,Cameen,"Finding Chris, and his AMAZING space, made my first trip to Seattle a breeze!! My brother and I were met with a welcoming smile, a key to our room, and permission to "" make ourselves at home "" ... So we did just that :) 
P.S.... Your dinner recommendation was SPOT ON!! We had and absolute blast!! - Although my brother is moving to Seattle, I know where I'll be staying whenever I'm in town.... THANKS CHRIS!!!"
458197,7637253,2013-09-27,6904235,Jw,"PureSpace completely exceeded our expectations as a place to stay, and Chris and Mateo were incredibly easy to work with, both when we were checking in and when we were checking out. Each room seemed to have its own theme; we stayed in the room called ""Slumber Party"", which had a bunk bed and was very cozy and comfortable. The house overall was amazing, clean, and had nice decor, as well as a spacious kitchen (not to mention a foosball table). We look forward to checking out some of the other rooms during our next trip to Seattle!"
458197,19234002,2014-09-08,16599444,Jae Hyun,It was comfortable and cheap room. I liked how the restroom was designed to save energy. Basement kitchen was awesome!

Beautifully crafted and cozy bungalo perched on hillside overlooking Seattle neighborhood. High quality interior cabinetry and workmanship. Lots of small and appreciated touches. Very peaceful neighborhood. Host thoughtful, available and accommodating. Excellent location for Seattle exploring. Would return in a heartbeat. Paul & Sarah"
9217030,56261818,2015-12-11,874728,Peter,"Brent's cozy bungalow has stunning views of the City and incredible vintage (and modern) furniture. Countless amazing restaurants, coffee shops and bars (breweries too), are just a few blocks away. Brent welcomed me in person, did a walk through and gave me great recommendations for dinner and breakfast. During the trip he communicated frequently and gave me a pro tip on how to run to Green Lake (thanks!). I've already recommended Brent's airbnb to my colleagues who travel to Seattle frequently for work.   "

The room is cute and comfy. You also get your own little yard! Highly recommended if you are visiting Seattle and looking for a place to stay. Cindy and Stephen are both very sweet, friendly and nice hosts. If you have any questions about where to go in Seattle, they will provide a lot of good suggestions! They also have a very cute cat named Little Orange. Love this place and will def go back next time I visit Seattle!"

First of all thanks for your hospitality. 
We had a fantastic holiday is Seattle and in our case, we just needed a place to sleep, your accommodation was perfect.
The room (quite new) was clean  and had enough storageroom.
It is situated in a very quiet area and close to several bus stops (line 5 and 40) to Fremont , Downtown, etc.
On walking distance there was the Woodland Park, Woodland Park Zoo and Green Lake Park.
Thanks for all, we loved your “Cozy Room with Private Garden”.

6179956,36331210,2015-06-27,35873140,Charlene,"We stayed at Cindy and Stephen's place for 3 nights. We had a wonderful time staying at their place.   Their house is new, clean and beautiful! It is also close to the bus lines and many cafe. The woodland park and the green lake is just near by where Cindy and Stephen's place is. I would recommend their place to anyone with no doubt! Thanks for making my first airbnb experience so wonderful! "
6179956,36563444,2015-06-29,34551441,Haley,"This was our first time using airbnb and we are very glad we did! 

Stephen and Cindy's place was very nice, quiet, and clean. The private entrance made it especially nice. The location was great; it's across the street from the zoo and right next to bus stops which take only about ten minutes to get to the city. 

Stephen and Cindy are very nice; on our trip the weather got very hot so they made sure we were comfortable and brought us a fan. We appreciated them and absolutely recommend their place."
6179956,37996075,2015-07-12,10087476,Kaitlin,"The room was very clean and cozy with a full sized bed large enough for two people. It comes with a private bathroom and a private entrance.  Stephen and Cindy were very helpful in providing recommended places to eat! Check in and check out was super quick and easy.
They do have a cat in the house which is separate from the room we rented. The cat meows a lot, especially in the mornings. Other than that, we enjoyed our stay and the thoughtfulness of our hosts!"
6179956,38384881,2015-07-15,30701349,Brenda,"Great place, very clean and quiet. We really enjoyed staying here, it's in a good location, we would definitely stay here again. "
6179956,38604730,2015-07-17,1646279,Lillian,"My fiancé and I enjoyed a lovely time at Stephen & Cindy's Cozy Room with Private Garden. It was cozy, clean, cute, and just like a little private hotel room. It was just what I expected it to be from the pictures. Stephen & Cindy were easy to communicate with and were very accommodating to our check in time. Everything was prompt, efficient, smooth and well done! :) The location was lovely and right next to an easy bus line and a good walk to the center of Fremont. The private entrance, with little courtyard were also both really nice. Cindy had ice water prepared for us right when we arrived and also left tea and chocolates for us. It was a great experience! Would definitely stay there again :)"
6179956,39390963,2015-07-23,4931637,Carrie,"Cindy & Stephen were very accommodating and flexible when our arrival time was pushed back a bit due to our train being delayed. When we finally arrived, we found the guestroom to be absolutely perfect! The private entrance is through a lovely little garden, and the room is cozy & comfortable with lots of light and simple, stylish decor, and absolutely spotless. We had requested an iron which was left for us in the closet and there was tea, candies, bottled water and an electric water boiler in the room as well. We felt immediately at-home and loved the neighborhood too! It was very quiet and safe and an easy walk or bus ride to multiple coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc. We appreciated the privacy and independence to come and go freely, and cannot think of a better little spot to call home for the four days we were visiting Seattle. We highly recommend this accommodation and thank Stephen and Cindy for providing such a lovely space for us.

The private patio sitting area was a real treat! Cindy was friendly, helpful and gracious (when we arrived 30 minutes earlier than we had told her). We appreciated the dining and coffee shop suggestions that she gave us. Their place is truly nicer than many hotels. We look forward to staying here when we visit our son! "
6179956,41942711,2015-08-10,4302755,Mathieu,"We loved so much our stay at Stephen & Cindy's room! Everything was perfect. Stephen wait for us late at night, the room is so clean, cozy and very well furnishes till the products in the bathroom. The private garden is a little place of serenity and poetry. Regarding the location, we enjoyed that part of Fremont north. It's an easy and cool walk to reach some marvelous bars and restaurants. We didn't have the chance to meet their cat Orange but we could speak with him through a door ;-) For sure, when we'll be back in Seattle, we'll immediately ask to Stephen & Cindy if we can rent another time their splendid room."

Their place was just as described and met our needs perfectly. It felt very new and very clean. The location was great and we had the opportunity to walk the path at Green Lake.  Thanks for opening your home to us!
6179956,45254055,2015-09-01,5635394,Michael,"I stayed for a full week in this wonderful and cozy apartment close to Fremont. Cindy has offered me a very warm welcome and was very easy to communicate with. The apartment is basically a private guest room (bathroom and mini-friedge included, but no opportunity to cook) and was very clean. The private patio is a big plus and makes it possible to enjoy a warm summer evening outside without having to leave the apartment. The area is very quiet but still very well connected to Downtown and the U-District. I would definitely recommend staying here."
6179956,46121529,2015-09-08,1600210,Susie,"Our stay was lovely in this little very private bedroom on the first floor of the home. It was peaceful, quite and serene and plenty large enough for a couple. We loved the location and could walk to the Fremont area with lots of shops -- about 8 or nine blocks away. Lots of cosy touches -- hot tea (NO COFFEE, so if you are coffee dependent you might take your own set up) and quite responsive hosts when we needed more towels and umbrellas!"
6179956,47582383,2015-09-20,44220764,Paul,"Did not have the pleasure of meeting Cindy, but Stephen was more  than accommodating and made me feel quite at home. Their place is modern and quant, much nicer/comfortable than some hotels I've stayed in. The peaceful sanctuary, garden area was great to relax in after the day/night hustle and bustle in the downtown area. I would highly recommend a stay in their beautiful home."

6179956,50472829,2015-10-12,39521339,Kimberley,Lovely stay at Cindy and Stephens. They were incredibly helpful and the room itself it well maintained and really clean.

The room is great - and very private and quiet - including its own entrance!  The location is great - walking distance to shops and restaurants and the bus downtown if 1/2 block away.  I would definitely stay there again!"
6179956,53027840,2015-11-03,10620,Pisay,"Stephen & Cindy were both super accommodating with my last minute booking which I truly appreciated. The room is exactly as pictured and nearly perfect for my needs. I was looking for a quite, private place to do some work from my computer and also within walking distance of a park so I could take breaks and stretch out. The room is private -with it's own entrance and full in-suite bathroom. There's a wonderful desk to work from and a nice amount of light. The patio is well taken care of and serene even in November. I especially loved being able to walk to the park across the street in the morning or to a cafe or market 5-10 minutes away. "
6179956,55793193,2015-12-06,46563333,Lana,"I really enjoyed my stay! This room was perfectly situated near Woodland Park, which meant every time I left the house I was greeted with a lovely park view. I did not have a car, and so I found plenty of cool shops and eateries within a few blocks or a short bus ride away - the bus stop is very close and convenient. I was in Seattle to complete some school assignments, so I found the room a perfect place to study and unwind from my busy days. It was very quiet. Stephen and Cindy were willing to accommodate my request to check in and out a little earlier than usual, and when I met Stephen, he was friendly, helpful, and made me feel comfortable immediately. Everything about the room was clean, neat, and orderly. It all looked new and fresh, waiting just for me. I loved peeking out into the garden, although it was too chilly to enjoy sitting outside! The private entrance meant I could come and go without disturbing anyone, and really helped me feel at home. I would definitely recommend the room as a cozy and comfortable home away from home when visiting Seattle!"
8643209,50053525,2015-10-08,41158892,Paige,"Jon was an awesome, super welcoming host. The room was great and within walking distance to a lot of rad places in Fremont and Wallingford. Another gold star!"
8643209,50420984,2015-10-11,46190429,Katherine,"Jon was super communicative, making checking in easy. When I got there I was given the tour and a general, and genuine, 'Mi casa es su casa'. The place was clean, comfortable, and just a great place to call home. The view is pretty incredible.  The surrounding neighborhoods had a lot to offer. I would definitely recommend this spot to those wanting a real feel for Seattle."
8643209,51244651,2015-10-18,39186135,Cory,Great! This is a very nice apartment and stellar location. Jon was super friendly and helpful during the stay.

2687172,51501516,2015-10-20,6219481,Letty,"Well, first off Seattle, I miss you so. Tiffany was great. I only interacted with her when she showed me around the apartment, but very sweet and made me feel very welcomed and not afraid to ask if I needed anything. 

The place itself is just lovely. It was small, but had character and was perfect for our stay. The decor is photo friendly and the view is mesmerizing. 

The location was also perfect. The neighborhood felt very safe at night, and there is lots to eat and drink around here. All walking distance as well as a Safeway if you want to pick up some groceries for your stay. The leaves were falling and the skies were clear so coming from Los Angeles, it was so refreshing to actually experience SEASONS. 

Only note is you may want to bring an extra set of blankets during the winter as it can get a little chilly but there was also some warming units so it's still very accommodating. Would definitely recommend anyone and everyone to stay at Falcon's nest!"
2687172,52288728,2015-10-27,22430892,Jeremy,"Very comfortable and cozy apartment. The location is wonderful, I even don't need to take a bus, walk home from downtown everyday with my mom. Tiff and her husband are so nice, my flight was delayed and I arrived at the apartment at 2 am, and Jack, Tiff's husband was still waiting for me! And they also gave me many suggestions during my visiting, and it was helpful!"
2687172,53502566,2015-11-09,8099949,Amanda,"The studio apartment is in a great, walkable location for someone visiting Seattle. The space is small but works well for two guests. The pullout bed was pretty comfortable. The view really makes the apartment, you can see the space needle and downtown from the large windows. 

The only negative is the radiator. I am a light sleeper and I was woken up by the radiator each night and early in the morning. I might recommend ear plugs if you are woken up easily. It did keep the place warm and comfortable for us. 

Tiffany met us at checkin. She was friendly and accommodating. "
2687172,54011330,2015-11-15,44795141,Amy,"Enjoyed staying at the Falcon's nest very  much! Tiffany was very helpful and accommodating and allowed us to leave our bags there several hours past the check-out time! 
It was very nice to be in Capitol Hill, where there are lots of shops and restaurants outside of the typical Seattle tourist activities!
Thanks Tiffany!! "
2687172,54739174,2015-11-23,7824438,Brittany,"This spot was absolutely perfect for my husband and me to get away for a weekend.

Location: This apartment is perfectly situated in Capitol Hill. We were able to walk to brunch, dinner, drinks, pool tables, etc. There is a parking spot which was huge because we drove out of the city for a day hike on Friday (though you'd be just fine with no car). The view is also spectacular - you can see the space needle and mountains in the distance. We loved watching the sunset here.

Host: Tiffany was so easy to work with. She lives nearby so she is pretty flexible and super responsive. The check in and check out process was wonderfully easy. 

We would absolutely stay here again if we were back in Seattle. Not to mention, the decor is incredibly charming.

Thanks Tiffany!"
2687172,55410923,2015-12-01,46892678,Tim,"The place is a little quirky, but it was comfortable and cute! The view is great!"
2687172,55924657,2015-12-07,47928968,Zach,"Had a great experience. Before our trip Tiffany was very responsive to my inquiries about Seattle and the appartment. When we arrived Tiffany had to step away, but Jack her husband responded promptly and showed us where we could park our rental car, conveniently gave us two sets of house keys, and answered all of our remaining questions about Seattle.

The appartment was well stocked with essentials like toiletries, coffee and extra blankets. When it was time to depart, Tiffany allowed us to put our keys on the kitchen table and leave whenever we liked.

My only constructive feedback and warning to future guests is that the sofa bed is a bit uncomfortable with wires in the frame that poke in the back from time to time.

Tiffany and Jack, thanks for being great hosts!"
2687172,56203390,2015-12-10,2515821,Sara,Perfectly located! Quaint vintage feel! Tiffany was prompt with communication and very thoughtful! 
2687172,56957300,2015-12-20,20330290,Khanh,"Tiffany's place was perfect: cute, great location, and good host. Tiffany contacted me on multiple occasions prior to checking in to make sure everything was ok. She even came down to get us on the day of checkin despite it raining. In a downtown with limited parking it was nice to have dedicated parking as well. Once you arrive, you'll be stunned by the perfect view of the waters and the space needle. "
8473625,54678871,2015-11-22,1442686,Tom,The apartment was pretty basic but very clean and in a great Capitol Hill location. Lots of light from the big windows and a comfortable bed. Connor was a great host and communicated very well.  A very pleasant place to stay.
8473625,56457549,2015-12-13,9684315,Jody,Good location. We had a nice time. Thanks!
1796302,8707726,2013-11-12,9803939,Christina,"Susanna and Patrick are great!  They provided me with everything I would've needed, in addition to giving great recommendations about places to see.  I was traveling by myself, but I felt very safe and comfortable in their home; it was nice to have a separate area so we didn't run into each other too much, but it was also nice to chat and get to know them.  I was lucky enough to catch a clear sun rise one morning on their private roof deck, a view that should not be missed!  I would definitely stay with them again the next time I'm in town."
1796302,8974901,2013-11-29,6760715,Heather,"Susanna and Patrick are extremely gracious and welcoming hosts, and the location of their townhome was perfect for me. I enjoyed being in walking distance of the quaint shops and restaurants of Fremont and at the same time, having convenient access to downtown via public transportation. I definitely hope to stay at Susanna and Patrick's home again in the very near future!"
1796302,9034880,2013-12-02,10004737,Adam,"Susanna was incredibly welcoming, and provided a very comfortable, clean and secure stay in a great location of Fremont. Everything was organized and she really made it feel like home for my brief stay, and not to mention this was during the week of Thanksgiving. I would highly recommend this to anybody looking for a relaxing stay with great access to shops, cafes, restaurants, and public transportation."
1796302,9183358,2013-12-11,10158716,Teri Thomson,"I stayed in Susanna and Patrick's home for two nights while interviewing for a new job in Seattle.  So glad I chose this over a hotel.  Susanna's hospitality was nurturing and attentive to whatever I needed.  And their lovely home calmed my nervous anticipation.  Their sweet dog Ruu (who guests can meet if they chose) gave me the most polite and warm doggie greeting as well, so I got my dog fix while missing my dog back home.

The room and adjacent bath were clean and comfortable -- everything I needed -- and warm and cozy during a December cold snap.  Very reliable Internet. The house is an easy walk to the wonderful shops and restaurants in charming Fremont.  I would love to stay here again."
1796302,9810849,2014-01-11,11135952,Diane,"Susanna was very considerate and attuned to the needs of a traveler.  I am very grateful for all Susanna's help during my stay.  Despite the provided ear plugs, the room and house were very quiet!  Clean; lovely furnishings; good access to public transportation. "
1796302,9824410,2014-01-12,808431,Phil,"Susanna was very accommodating, even with my late notice booking. Susanna and Patrick were extremely friendly, and their place was nothing short of perfect. Warm and cozy, private bathroom, walking distance to many restaurants, what else can you ask for? Easily my favourite AirBnb experience so far, and will definitely stay here again next time I'm in town. Thanks again Susanna and Patrick!"
1796302,9842910,2014-01-13,4285126,Denise,"Thank you so much to Susanna and Patrick for your help and hospitality that started even before we arrived. We enjoyed the cat snuggles and the comfort of having our own little area downstairs. We loved the location being so close to Downtown, Ballard, and Fremont. We'll definitely recommend to friends if they need a place to stay!"
1796302,9890219,2014-01-17,1415232,Demetrios,"Susanna and Patrick were great! They were both very hospitable and willing to help with whatever they could.

1796302,10283042,2014-02-10,11918271,Svetlana,We were very lucky to stay at Susanna and Patrick's house located in the easy going Fremont neighborhood. Susanna’s tips on local restaurants were very useful and two recommended restaurants that we visited (Tilth and Roux) offered superb food.  We would love to come back soon to explore more local art scene and indie music.  Thank you guys!
1796302,10399829,2014-02-17,537198,Laurie,"Susanna and Patrick have a beautiful home, and have thought of every detail to make you comfortable.  We walked into our room and thought this is waaaay better than any hotel!  They are kind and gracious, and bend over backwards to help you have an excellent experience. Bed was very comfortable, room quiet with private bath. WE will be back!"

1796302,10641558,2014-03-01,11918488,Meredith,"Susanna was a fantastic hostess during my recent stay. She was accessible and accommodating, and I felt welcome from the moment we first communicated. Her home is lovely, her pets are sweet, and her local knowledge is impressive. She provided expert guidance on everything from restaurants to city-wide transit, and she made sure my friend and I had everything we needed at all times. I'll certainly plan my next trip to Seattle around Susanna's availability. I can't imagine staying anywhere else!"
1796302,10796784,2014-03-08,3342420,Ivan,"Susanna and Patrick are fantastic hosts - respectful and nice to talk to. They gave us great tips about the neighborhood. We enjoyed walking out to a local restaurant for a dinner and then a morning walk to get some coffee and explore the area. Their house is very nice, modern and peaceful. The guest room and bathroom are pretty much spotless. We only wished we could have stayed longer."
1796302,10849968,2014-03-10,3904962,Kristan,"I arrived wet and bedrangled after a 4 mile urban Seattle hike. Susanna ushered me in, dried my wet clothes. The house was lovely. A fire in the living room, tea to warm myself and a comfortable bed.  Thank you so much for a lovely refuge and respite! She also made several restaurant recommendations. I hope I get to try them all out on future trips!"
1796302,11005911,2014-03-17,9851204,Alex,Susanna and Patrick were the best hosts and the room/house was wonderful! Very peaceful and conveniently located among the many great parts of Seattle. Would absolutely recommend to anyone passing through!
1796302,11178002,2014-03-24,10841448,Katrin,"Susanna is an amazing host - extremely accomodating, helpful and welcoming. The place itself is beautiful, super-clean and the bathroom in particular (thanks to a sizeable shower) feels almost luxurious. You have the lower floor all to yourself, have your own set of keys and can use the kitchen: if you're looking for a a ""home away from home,"" this is it. I'd definitley stay here again. "
1796302,11251360,2014-03-26,12431287,Mariah,"My sister and I stayed with Susanna and Patrick for two nights and had an absolutely wonderful time. Susanna is a really kind person and was very helpful with suggesting places to check out while we were in town. The house is very conveniently located, and it was easy to get around by bus and walk around Fremont. The room was clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. Their pets are great, super mellow and very friendly. I would absolutely stay with them again. "
1796302,11303780,2014-03-29,12704114,Amy,"Susanna was a wonderfully accommodating host, with an charming home in a awesome upper Fremont neighborhood. Just a few minutes to a bus stop to take downtown, and within walking distance of the cute shops and artsy sights of the Fremont area. The bathroom and bedroom were comfortable and well-kept, and the kitchen was lovely as well. Her dog was also a cutie, and her kitty is a complete lovebug. Really enjoyed our stay, and would be delighted to have the chance to stay there again. "
1796302,11444210,2014-04-02,5290426,Ryan,The house was amazing.  I almost wanted to move in and stay for good.  The amenities were impeccable.  They thought of everything that anyone would need for a visit or stay in Seattle and it was the best place I've stayed at through Airbnb.  I wish I was able to stay longer. 
1796302,11475094,2014-04-04,13423452,Caroline,Susanna was such a fantastic host. Her and Patrick were so welcoming and great to talk to. They also live in the most wonderful neighborhood which we could not get enough of! Both Susanna and Patrick knew a lot about the city and recommended the best places to go to. Everything was extremely clean and we felt very comfortable there. A great place to stay and highly recommended. We would absolutely stay there again.
1796302,11523935,2014-04-06,5796733,Dietmar And Patriza,I truly enjoyed my time in Susanna and Patrick's home. They are  wonderful hosts and I will stay with them again when the occasion arises. Great location to discover 'quirky' Fremont - some wonderfully authentic eating places in the neighborhood. 
1796302,11547589,2014-04-07,12882272,Allan,"6 stars out of 5.  Great space, lots of privacy, beautifully appointed and quiet.  Susanna & Patrick are terrific.  Very helpful, pleasant and easy-going. Perfect location near excellent restaurants and public transportation.  Couldn't have asked for better.  Will definitely be our Seattle getaway home away from home."
1796302,11855755,2014-04-17,11333183,Ellen,"What a wonderful; experience I had with Susanna and Patrick in their home.  The rooms (private bedroom and bathroom) were great and very comfortable! The Freemont area has so many interesting places to shop, eat, hike, etc.  Everything I needed was provided and more so!  I believe I have found the place I want to stay for all my visits to Seattle in the future!  With a new grandbaby in the area, I plan to check in quite often.  Thank you for this great experience!  I feel I made new friends in these two folks and that makes me very happy!"
1796302,11914519,2014-04-19,685405,Richard,What a lovely place. The location was extremely convenient and Susanna was a delightful host. She was so friendly as was her husband Patrick and she could not have tried harder to help us get around Seattle and really went the extra mile to accommodate our wishes in a very short stay. The room  with adjacent private bathroom was superb and the shower great. We had a lovely chat over breakfast and only wish we could have stayed longer despite the poor weather! We cannot recommend her highly enough as she made us very welcome and comfortable. We loved it.
1796302,12030775,2014-04-21,14243189,Kat,The location is spectacular and we had a great time exploring Fremont.  Susanna & Patrick were very accommodating and encouraged us to make ourselves at home.  Our room & bathroom were well stocked and homey.  We had a great stay; thanks Susanna & Patrick!
1796302,12187380,2014-04-25,13835400,Daryl,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Susanna's home. The accommodations were clean and neat, and well organized. All of our needs were met and exceeded. As an example, I asked if they had hot chocolate and the next morning there it was on the kitchen counter. They obviously made an extra effort to make us feel at home.

We  plan to stay again on our next visit to Seattle.

Sincerely, Daryl & Jan

1796302,12330461,2014-04-29,11972398,Louisa,"Such a wonderful first experience with AirBnB. The surrounding neighborhood was most excellent, and just around the corner were so many interesting places to eat and enjoy the unique Fremont neighborhood. We relied mostly on public transportation and the stops were just a jaunt away. Susanna and her husband were great hosts - but Royko the cat was furrily charismatic! A++, would AirBnB again."
1796302,12477197,2014-05-03,14773145,Laura,Susanna and Patrick were fabulous hosts! They gave TONS of recommendations for where to eat and visit and were flexible when we arrived later than we planned. I also really enjoyed having the privacy of the whole bottom floor and their friendly kitties to keep us company. The neighborhood was beautiful and nearby many neat restaurants and Seattle attractions. We had a wonderful time and would book with them again.
1796302,12845120,2014-05-12,4232831,Sara,"We had a lovely time at Susanna and Patrick's. We enjoy staying in different Seattle neighborhoods when we go down for overnight visits from Bellingham. Susanna and Patrick's location in Fremont was ideal, and they steered us to a great restaurant for dinner. We had the entire lower level of their beautiful home to ourselves -- it was extremely comfortable, quiet, and cozy with lovely furnishings. We would definitely go back!"
1796302,12974478,2014-05-16,13571232,Susan,"My husband and I have been in many homes around the world, and Susanna & Patrick's place was one of the best. Susanna understands how to make her home a restful and welcoming retreat for travelers visiting Seattle. Their home was clean, visually attractive,  and comfortable physically and socially. An added bonus was the level of privacy with the lower level set aside for guests. The location was fun for accessing some of the interesting neighborhoods in Seattle, and walking to most places you might need to go. We plan to stay here again when in Seattle! "
1796302,13143561,2014-05-20,492292,Brennan & Basia,"We had a great time at Susanna's house. It is a convenient location--  close to bus lines to downtown and walking distance to all of Fremont's attractions. Make sure to grab a sandwich from Paseo, which is around the corner. The bedroom was clean and the bed was super comfy. We slept wonderfully during our stay. Susanna was very kind, flexible and helpful. Great coffee too.  Thank you! "
1796302,13199269,2014-05-21,1722539,Robert,"Susanna was very friendly and we enjoyed talking with her. She gave us 
a lot of helpful information and has a lot of good info for the newcomer to Seattle.   
We really liked her place and would DEFINITELY go back. It is a nicely furnished room with a window opening out to nice shrubs, and birds singing outside. The bed is comfortable and everything was clean and light in color.  The bathroom was also very clean and new.  We had coffee and bagels in the morning. It was a comfortable and pleasant experience. "
1796302,13232755,2014-05-22,4920797,A.J.,"Susanna and Patrick were terrific hosts for my very brief stay.  I didn't get to their home until late at night, but they were up and waiting and helped assist me with my suitcase up the stairs and then down the stairs into their guest quarters.  The room was just right and the sheets were super comfy.  I was able to find very thing I needed in the bathroom and was able to travel to my morning appointments in downtown very easily.  The home is located very close to Seattle center and I was able to navigate easily to find their home late at night.  I will definitely book more nights there in the future and hopefully get to know Susanna and Patrick more!  Thanks for the wonderful hospitality!"
1796302,13277145,2014-05-24,12024105,Janet,I stayed at Susanna's place for two nights and found it to be very clean and comfortable.  Everything I needed was there.... even chocolates on the pillows!  Would definitely stay here again.  
1796302,13328140,2014-05-25,15575986,Trung,"This AirBnB was quite amazing. Honestly Susanna would be awesome at running a bed and breakfast because that was how our stay felt. Of the two other places that we stayed at this was by far the best in terms of house and host quality. 

Susanna was very prompt with communication and met us at her house once we arrived. She was very accommodating as we had to drop off our luggage early. The home is a beautiful modern duplex that is wonderfully decorated. The photos are very accurate. The room is in a small basement with its own bathroom so it is very private. There is a beautiful large window and an interesting selection of books. The bathroom and bedroom were very clean.

The location of this AirBnB is north of the Seattle Center and in the Fremont area. It's in a perfect location as its the next street over from a bunch of restaurants and coffee shops including Cafe Vita and Paseo (famous cuban sandwich place). The bus stop is very close (about 4 minute walk) and Bus 5 will take you virtually the entire length of the seattle downtown. Therefore if you wanted to go to pike's place, the space needle, aquarium, international district, etc. this line takes you close to all of them. The zoo and the Fremont market are also both within walking distance ( 10-15 minute).

Patrick and Susanna are genuine sweet people who were a blast to stay with. They even provided breakfast and cookies for snacks! I would definitely stay here again. "
1796302,13617288,2014-06-01,14807616,Ward,"Our room was very comfortable and private with access to the deck overlooking Seattle's skyline a welcome bonus.  Susanna's house is in a very fun and interesting neighborhood.  Just prior to our arrival, she notified us of a sudden trip for her but quickly lined up her sister to be there.  But we did arrive early enough to meet Susanna and felt very good about her arrangements.  She also provided an extensive list of restaurants and other highlights of the neighborhood.  We will definitely check with her about staying again on any future trips to Seattle."
1796302,13692097,2014-06-02,12436413,Vanessa,"Susanna took great care of us when we stayed in her beautiful home. It's clear that she really wants to make her guests feel comfortable--she provided a detailed welcome guide, made sure we had all the little odds and ends you want when traveling (hair dryer, travel guides and maps), and the bed was super comfy."
1796302,13890414,2014-06-07,8279498,Jean-François,"Susanna was not home during my stay but her sister Beth took care of everything. The house is amazing, with a great connection to downtown Seattle by bus.
Fremont is a lovely neighbourhood, packed with small coffee shops, street art and urban food. 
I would definitely recommend Susanna's house, it's just perfect. "
1796302,13967206,2014-06-09,15090452,Bernard,"We spent a very nice weekend in the house of Susanna in Fremont, Seattle. This is a very clean and comfortable house in a friendly and well-contained neighbourhood. We would come back any time. B. and I., Victoria, BC."
1796302,15173648,2014-07-04,10799812,Elliott,"I stayed with Susanna and Patrick for a few weeks during a summer internship and they were just wonderful hosts. Everything I needed was taken care of, and it was great getting to know them. 

I highly recommend Susanna and Patrick's place to anyone stopping in Seattle. In addition to having a great place to stay, you'll be in the middle of Fremont, which is a really fun neighborhood with plenty of restaurants, bars, and coffee shops within walking distance. 

I should also note that Susanna and Patrick have three very nice pets: a friendly old dog; a nice but shy cat who mostly stays upstairs; and a second cat, Royko, who is THE WORLD'S FRIENDLIEST CAT. Honestly, all he wants to do is be your best friend. "
1796302,15278572,2014-07-06,10397858,Emily,Susanna & family were very welcoming. Their two cats and dog made the experience very friendly and home-like. I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking to stay in a fun area of Seattle! 
1796302,15364432,2014-07-07,1623941,Kai,Susanna and Patrick were great hosts and can give you a lot of advice about the area. The house is very clean and the bed is super comfortable. The view from the rooftop is amazing! 
1796302,15465337,2014-07-09,14272556,Aaron,"Our AirBnB experience in Susanna's home can be described as organized and beautiful. The bedroom and private bathroom were nicely organized and filled with all of the resources you need, even instructions for what to do in an emergency! The view from the roof deck is outstanding. It really shows off the beauty of Seattle.

Susanna's home is located in a quiet and area. It is a short walk to the heart of Fremont as well as to bus lines headed to Downtown, the U-district, and Ballard."
1796302,16603636,2014-07-30,13478398,Cher,"I so enjoyed staying with Susanna in her beautiful home in Fremont!  I had a perfect accommodation in a very private setting -- a lovely bedroom and bath on a lower level all to myself.  The bed was comfortable and the bath and shower were very nice and super clean.  I had room for a long stay.  Susanna is a wonderful hostess and provided muffins, toast, fresh fruit, etc, each morning.  The location is great and just a block away from coffee shops, a local grocery, and a variety of restaurants as well as the bus lines to take you into Seattle.  Susanna's was just a few blocks away from my daughters home, the perfect location for a 3 week visit to see my new granddaughter!  I will certainly be back again soon!"
1796302,16979030,2014-08-05,14964845,Amoreli,My stay with Susanna and her husband was great.  They were very friendly and accommodating.  The room was small but warm and cozy.  The room and bath were perfect for  a week stay to visit family in Seattle.  Make sure to go to the deck on the roof.  Amazing views!  My interaction with them was perfect.  Susanna was always available by phone or text if I needed to get in touch with her.  I usually bumped into them briefly in the morning and evening if our paths crossed.  The neighborhood is wonderful with restaurants and coffee shops all in walking distance.  I would recommend their place to anyone visiting Seattle.
1796302,17473880,2014-08-12,19162887,Mike,"Susanna and Patrick were great hosts. We loved the townhouse, especially the deck. I would recommend staying with Susanna and Patrick to anyone. "
1796302,17620971,2014-08-15,6245706,Jessica,"Susanna and Patrick were very welcoming hosts!  Susanna had prepared a lot of tips and information about Seattle and Freemont that were very useful during our trip.  We were also welcomed with an assortment of Seattle guidebooks and brochures, chocolate on our pillows, and a very friendly cat, (who we currently miss).  The location was also wonderful, both with available free parking and a short 5 minute walk to a bus for downtown.  I would highly recommend Susanna and Patrick to any fun-loving patron. "
1796302,17742666,2014-08-17,14378468,Doug,We really enjoyed staying here.  Susanna and her husband are very friendly and helpful and even wrote a multi-page guide about Seattle. Their home is in a wonderful neighborhood with lots of restaurants and cafés and a great grocery store all less than a five minute walk.  Really a great place and a great bargain.  
1796302,17887673,2014-08-18,19579597,Lynette,"I was only here one night but Susanna and Patrick made me feel right at home. They even left a sweet birthday card for me, as I stayed on my birthday. Fremont is a fun area to hang out in with lots of delicious restaurants and cafes nearby. I would stay again in a flash! I definitely recommend Susanna and Patrick's -- a comfortable and friendly place to stay, living up to all the positive feedback I read about. Thanks!"
1796302,18015447,2014-08-20,18358861,Heeheun,"Susanna and Patrick were the greatest host I have ever had! They are lovely couple and their life is filled with love and care. The room was spacious and neat, and all the amenities were clean. Even the cat was friendly and lovely. Seattle trip was very pleasant and unforgettably great experience due to their effort to make me as comfortable as I could get. It is located in a nice neighborhood and close distance to many tourists' attractions."
1796302,18529287,2014-08-28,16506507,Norm,"Susanna and Patrick were great hosts.  Very accommodating with our arrival time.  Made us feel very welcome and gave some great suggestions for places to see.  The Fremont area is a great part of Seattle and we spent a good day exploring the area.  The bedroom and bathroom were very comfortable and as advertised. We would definitely go back and stay with Susanna and Patrick.
One highlight would definitely be their beautiful cat, Royko - all the best! "

1796302,18657354,2014-08-30,5215130,Greg,"This was an excellent Airbnb rental. Susanna and Patrick were very welcoming and helpful regarding things in the neighborhood, transportation, and so on. The rental is a bedroom and bathroom in the private downstairs area with shared common areas and kitchen. We had plenty of privacy and everything worked as it should. This house is conveniently located within walking distance of both Wallingford and Fremont ""downtown"" areas which have great shops and bars. Additionally, Vif wine and coffee bar is right around the corner and has some of the best espresso and pastries ever. Paseo is nearby and supposed to be great. Check out Theo, Brouwer's, and Revel down in Fremont and fresh IPA radlers at the Grizzled Wizard in Wallingford. So much to do, so little time..."
1796302,18934628,2014-09-03,11364451,Günther,"Susanna und Petrick waren liebe und aufmerksame
Gastgeber. Selbst unsere recht späte Ankunft am Abend war kein Problem.Das Haus liegt in einer ruhigen Gegend, mit ausreichenden Parkmöglichkeiten und kurzem Weg zum Highway. Susanna spricht sehr gut Deutsch .Dies ist besonders schön für Alle, die ihr Schulenglisch schon etwas vergessen haben."
1796302,19257998,2014-09-09,12428614,Katie,"Really couldn't have asked for a better host! Susanna thought of every possible amenity we could have needed.  She also had some recommendations for nearby restaurants that were spot on.  You can't beat this location either--walking distance to virtually all of Fremont, close to Ballard and easy access to the highway. The room was quiet, clean and very comfortable.  We also really enjoyed our cat friend who visited us periodically throughout our stay--what a sweetheart! Would absolutely recommend this listing to others!"

1796302,19562164,2014-09-14,7811582,Caitlin,"Susanna and Patrick were so awesome and hospitable! Susanna even bought gluten free bread for my celiac needs :) And their pets were so sweet too. The room is downstairs with its own private bathroom (bonus!) and the hosts' provided shampoo/conditioner and other bathroom amenities, which was super thoughtful.

Great location - we enjoyed the Fremont area the most in Seattle. There's a fun Sunday market and vintage mall nearby, plust a ton of restaurants and a tasty little gluten free, vegan bakery! 

Would definitely go back!"
1796302,19796396,2014-09-18,16265718,Michelle,"Had an amazing stay. The roof was a very nice treat and Susanna did a wonderful job making us feel welcomed. This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have gone better. Would highly recommend this place especially since it's in the Fremont district which is a great neighborhood for eating,  drinking,  and vintage shopping. The thing i loved the most was that she had a guide for must dos while in Seattle which helped us determine what we should really see.  Thanks again!"
1796302,20229922,2014-09-26,3525676,Izabela,"I spent 9 days at Susanna and Patrick's, and had a great stay. Susanna, Patrick, and their furry friends are lovely, easy going, accommodating, and I truly felt at home. The room and bathroom were comfortable and clean, there were plenty of towels, a hairdryer, shampoo etc. I was welcome to use the bread, bread spreads, spices, tea/coffee and the like. The house is quiet, and very close to a local shop as well as the heart of Freemont, which is a funky/artsy, vibrant area. This was the seventh time I used AirBnB in my travels, and although all the experiences have been very positive, Susanna and Patrick really went an extra mile as hosts - HIGHLY recommended!  "
1796302,20322123,2014-09-27,9810551,Duncan,The condo was very nice and Susanna was very helpful and accomodating.  
1796302,20638179,2014-10-02,5270429,Carina,"Susanna and Patrick were great - very welcoming, provided lots of useful information about the area and made us feel very comfortable in their lovely home. "
1796302,20983283,2014-10-08,18122900,Nancy,"Sussana was great!! She gave us a warm welcome, and her pets too.  Richard said bye to us in the morning, it was nice to meet you guys! Thanks!

Nancy and Saul"
1796302,21145439,2014-10-12,4995371,Stacy,"We had a wonderful stay. The place was homey, lovely, comfortable and private. Suzanna and Patrick had anticipated our every need and were gracious hosts. Highly recommended."
1796302,21515336,2014-10-19,4200932,Michal,We had a wonderful experience here. Susanna and Patrick were terrific hosts who made us feel very welcome. They even left me some chocolates and a birthday card on my birthday. The apartment is conveniently located near public transportation and is also in walking distance from a couple of great neighborhoods (and Gas Works park). All-in-all a wonderful place to stay! 
1796302,21656681,2014-10-21,6538919,Katelyn,"Susanna was a fantastic host! From the moment I booked with her, she has been super helpful with suggestions, directions and so much more. Fremont is a wonderful little neighborhood with plenty of gems to explore. Go see the troll, trust me.

The bed is soft and warm. The view from the roof deck is breathtaking. The shower is hot. In short, the place is a gem.

My only gripe is that I couldn't stay longer!"
1796302,21792822,2014-10-24,6172699,Sandra,"Wir hatten eine wundervolle Zeit bei Susanna und Patrick mitten im künstlerischen Fremont und trotzdem unglaublich ruhig gelegen. Unser Zimmer war traumhaft, gemütlich und mit einem super bequemen Bett und eigenem Bad ausgestattet. Das Haus ist mit so vielen wunderschönen kleinen Details ausgestattet, dass man sich von der ersten Sekunde an zu Hause fühlt. Bessere Gastgeber als Susanna und Patrick kann man sich nicht wünschen. Beide haben uns während unseres Aufenthaltes weit mehr mit Tipps geholfen, als man das normalerweise erwarten kann. Die Lage des Hauses ist perfekt, mit Auto und Bus leicht erreichbar und trotzdem super ruhig und sicher. Wir hoffen sehr, noch einmal das Vergnügen zu bekommen, bei den beiden übernachten zu dürfen. Besser geht's nicht!!! Und Susanna spricht so perfekt Deutsch, dass wir fast vergessen haben in den USA zu sein!!!! Schade, dass unser Aufenthalt nur so kurz war."
1796302,21949382,2014-10-27,15104415,Dennis,"Susanna and Patrick were very welcoming.  Though we arrived closer to 11pm than 10pm (as scheduled), Patrick was there to greet our cab at the corner and direct us to the house, and Susanna gave us a tour of the kitchen and the downstairs where we stayed -- and made sure we were settled in before telling us goodnight.  The accommodations were exactly as described, and we felt well situated.  If you want to stay in or visit the Fremont area of Seattle, you couldn't find a more convenient location than this -- just a block off Fremont Ave and close to many restaurants and shops."
1796302,22296153,2014-11-03,819721,Susan,"Our stay with Susanna and Patrick was delightful- like staying with my own adult children, only without the issues! We felt right at home and very comfortable. Came in early one evening, hosts were out, so we made a martini, turned on the gas fireplace and curled up on the couch with a good book and a couple of cats.
 
Our room and bath were private, quiet and everything we needed was provided, including lots of Seattle visitor information.  The location of the house is terrific.  Nice neighborhood with lots of neat shops and good restaurants close by. Street parking was always available and easy access to downtown and highways  made getting around simple. 
  We look forward to staying here again in the future when we come out to visit our family.  Felt just like home!"
1796302,22569676,2014-11-09,23336643,Erin,"We had a wonderful time staying in Fremont at Susanna and Patrick's! Susanna was super hospitable and helped us with directions and looking up hours of operation for sites we wished to visit.  The bed was amazingly comfortable and we slept like babies. We liked having the kitties around for cuddles and appreciated the organic coffee, coffee cream, bread and bread spreads for breakfast.  Susanna even left a beautiful birthday card for my girlfriend which was much appreciated.  She also gave us an ice pack so we could take perishables home to Canada.  Overall it was a lovely experience and I would totally recommend this space. Thanks Susanna and Patrick! "
1796302,22756799,2014-11-13,5080860,Lindsey,"Our stay at Susanna's was great. She accommodated us last minute even when she had a lot going on. Her pets are very friendly (especially if you enjoy cat cuddles!) the bed was extremely comfy, the neighborhood is great, and she even left us chocolates on our pillows. She has an amazing view from the balcony as well :) highly recommended! "
1796302,22809368,2014-11-15,22331623,Claudia,"Fabulous location, pleasant hosts. Almost as described. At the risk of differing from other reviews, we felt a bit misled by the prospect of having the “bottom floor of our home to yourselves,” combined with the sense of spaciousness given by the photographs (of the “shared” area). After all the hunting we did on the airbnb site, the description/photos did not prepare us for having to squeeze into a such a small space. This may be a flaw in airbnb expectation-management advice to hosts.

The bottom floor actually available to us was, simply, a small (cramped) bedroom— bruised shins from a jutting bed frame, and no place to turn around or set anything—and, certainly, a nicely-appointed bathroom. Clean and comfortable, but the only place to relax was on the bed, making a hotel option much more preferable. Susanna was quite preoccupied with work at the time of our arrival, so actually using the “shared” space on the main floor was not an option (which serves as Susanna’s workspace as well). We felt quickly relegated to the bedroom downstairs. Disappointing, given our hope to relax, stretch our legs, and get some reading in before a busy evening in Seattle.

Last thought: don’t plan on sleeping in—the early morning clatter (7 a.m. both mornings) of the (admittedly sweet) dog on the hardwood floor, directly above our bedroom, was not ideal. 

We realize that a critical review might make us seem difficult (risky on airbnb profiles), but in our defence, we are pretty easy-going, well-travelled, love Seattle! and have hosted many guests in our own home over the years."
1796302,22831389,2014-11-16,12995577,Liana,"Delightful! What a wonderful couple, so welcoming and hospitable. The home is lovely with everything you need, within walking distance of the coolest part of Seattle. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. Thank you for all of the sweet touches (especially the birthday card!) and great recommendations. Can't wait to stay with you again soon."
1796302,23126898,2014-11-23,23674925,Caitlin,Susanna and Patrick were very kind and responsive to any questions we had. Their home was in a very convenient location and well stocked with any amenities we may need. Would recommend for anyone wanting to stay in Fremont! 
1796302,23217232,2014-11-25,7140800,Cami,"Susana was out of town when we stayed in her space, but she coordinated everything, and everything was smooth! The space is cute, comfortable and clean, which are definitely the airbnb 3c's as far as I'm concerned! We loved staying here, and would definitely recommend it! "
1796302,23362915,2014-11-30,5375310,Asia,"The location was excellent. Susana was most thoughtful in every aspect including providing slippers, robes, travel necessities like a shower cap, etc.  We felt welcomed and cared for.  I would recommend her beautiful house to anyone wishing to visit Seattle. She left provisions for a continental breakfast and it was not only convenient but essential to get our day started. 
Thanks Susana for making our stay so great!"
1796302,23680288,2014-12-08,21665339,Justin,"Susanna and Patrick have a beautiful home in a very convenient spot in Fremont. Communication was great and Susanna was always easy to reach when I needed to ask a question. Right from when we reached the front door, we were warmly greeted, given a brief tour and thorough walkthrough of the amenities. We were shown to our room on the lower floor of their home along with a private bathroom. 

Both the bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well kept, with clean linens. A couple of nice touches in the bedroom, were the chocolate on the pillow and pitcher of water on the nightstand. She also provided a handy guide to Seattle highlights (which helped us dicover the excellent Espresso Vivace) It was very nice to find a relatively firm bed here, as other airbnb rooms that I've stayed in have had relatively soft beds. They also made coffee and breakfast available to us in the kitchen. 

Street parking was surprisingly easy to find nearby and there was easy access to highway 99 nearby, making downtown Seattle a mere 10 minute drive away. Much of of the Fremont district (great food, drinks, markets) was also easily walkable or a short drive away. The street is quiet, so there wasn't any audible noise from cars in the bedroom, yet the house is situated with convenient access to the highway. 

Susanna also went out of her way to make it a point that we got a chance to see the beautiful view of Mount Rainier and the cascades from their rooftop deck. It definitely was a great view from up there. and you could even see most of downtown Seattle and the Space Needle. 

Finally, their two cats were friendly (I forgot their names), but the male grey and white one was super friendly and really loved attention, but the female brown and white cat was a bit shy and would mostly run away from us. 

I'd definitely look to Susanna and Patrick's place first, the next time I plan to visit (website hidden);dr: great location and views, welcoming hosts, clean and cozy home, easy parking, friendly cats"
1796302,24066908,2014-12-18,24800152,Alex,"Awesome place in Fremont. It was my first time in Seattle, Susanna and Patrick were super nice and welcoming. They had great suggestions for my short stay there. Lots of great spots within walking distance. Was not disappointed in any food I had in the Fremont area."
1796302,24661990,2015-01-01,14644227,Nicholas,"Susanna and Patrick were wonderful hosts. They made us feel at home and gave us the scoop on the local scene and surrounding neighborhoods. Having coffee and simple breakfast items for the mornings was a plus too. Rue and his feline friends made us feel right at home as well. If you are looking to stay in Fremont, this is a great place!"
1796302,25105407,2015-01-06,24493513,Yuquan,"Susanna is sooooooooo nice. When we reached her house, she not only explain all the detail of the house, but also showed us the popular attractions around the Seattle. The day we arrive, the Mt Rainer is hardly see. Susanna is so nice, she text us when she saw the Mt Rainer is able to see through the clouds. If you are a dog and cat person, you will definitely love the house. They have a 14 year old dog ruu and a two cats. Ruu is so friendly and the boy cat is also as friendly as a dog too. 

If I have chance to go back to Seattle, their house is definitely i would choose again."
1796302,25147656,2015-01-07,25150241,Jess,"We had an amazing stay at Susanna's. She was extremely accommodating, and the room was very comfortable. The house was clean, and the pets were friendly. The Fremont area is beautiful, and the house is only a short walk to some great shops and restaurants. We took her advice and visited the Fremont troll!  And we took one of her suggestions for breakfast... the Silence Heart Nest. It was delicious. Can't wait to visit Seattle again!! "
1796302,25255413,2015-01-10,21094239,Wynne,"The room was very comfortable as it comes with a lot of privacy. Susanna does an amazing job preparing for my nephew and I, which makes us feel at home. Her bathroom is very clean and also provides extra necessities next to the washing bowl for the guests' use. She evens prepares tea bags, trail mix, water and even reusable bag for grocery shopping in the room for us, so thoughtful! Her house is amazing organized and clean with the company of 2 cats who act like dogs and an old dog which still has the energy to come up to you and say hello. Her house is very close to many attractions in Seattle such as the Troll under the bridge, downtown, and Space needle. It is also 2 blocks away to THE 2ND BEST Sandwich place that just reopened (So Good!! Tips: call and keep calling until they pick up to make a phone order and walk to pick up at the time they tell you to save the 30 minute waiting on the street). Also, totally worth checking out the coffee shop and the cookbook store within minutes away from Susanna's place.
Overall experience of the accommodation was very pleasant and comfortable, if I ever come back to Seattle I would definitely visit Susanna's warm & welcoming home."
1796302,25299702,2015-01-11,25519911,Phillip,"Susanna and her husband were very welcoming. They offered to help me with my bags and gave me a tour of their home. The offer you access to their kitchen, food, and tea. The room is clean, comfortable, and makes you feel at home. I enjoyed the privacy of the basement floor with my personal bathroom with a fantastic shower. If I had any questions or suggestions for a place to eat or to see, they were eager and accessible. The TV and WiFi were a nice addition. They have the channels listed near the bed like a hotel and readings to discover Seattle. I really felt like I was staying at a quaint bed & breakfast in a townhouse. Lastly, before I left for my flight, Susanna left a goodie bag with snacks for my travels which was a welcomed gift. Overall, Susanna and her husband are great hosts who enjoy having people stay with them. I wish I had more time to perhaps share a meal and talk. She is well traveled and  a sincerely engaging person. I would come back to stay in this room when I am in Seattle again. "
1796302,25376086,2015-01-13,15121499,Kathryn,Susanna is an outstanding host! Her home is absolutely lovely in the perfect location! Every detail was attended to and I could not have felt more welcome. Highly recommend!!
1796302,25473998,2015-01-17,25291976,Ute,"Wir erreichten Susannas zu Hause abends. Wir wurden sehr freundlich empfangen. Susannas Deutsch ist wirklich sehr gut und sie liebt es dies zu sprechen :) Wir fühlten uns schon beim Empfang sehr wohl. Das Zimmer ist wie auf dem Foto, sehr liebevoll eingerichtet und sehr sauber. Auf dem Nachttisch lag eine Liste, wo man die wichtigesten Details über Seattle erfahren konnte, zudem stand frisches Wasser parat. Auf dem Fensterbrett stand ein Korb mit diversen Karten von Seattle und Sehenswürdigkeiten. Wir hatten ein eigenes Badezimmer, dies war ebenfalls sehr sauber. Susanna zeigte uns ihr schönes Haus und die Dachterasse mit wunderschöner Aussicht. Es war wirklich sehr angenehm :) Danke vielmals für die liebevolle Gastfreundschaft von Euch beiden und vielleicht ein anderes Mal :)"
1796302,25603268,2015-01-20,18326742,Suzanne,Perfect location with convenient public transport and great food right around the corner. Patrick was the perfect host. Greeted us upon our arrival and made us feel very welcome. The room was clean and cosy with really thoughtful welcoming touches... The cats and dog greeted us but did not intrude. Look forward to coming back if circumstances allow....
1796302,25671302,2015-01-22,15121499,Kathryn,I love staying here! The house is wonderful! Hosts are amazing. It's totally perfect!
1796302,25817570,2015-01-26,21015536,Hilary,Susanna and Patrick were wonderful and welcoming.  We really loved the location and their animals are awesome!
1796302,25920605,2015-01-29,26717461,Ben,"Susanna and Patrick are great hosts. The room was very nice with lots of amenities, and in a great location in Seattle! New visitors will find lots of information about local activities, and walking distance to good food/bars."
1796302,25943876,2015-01-30,25943189,Jesse,Staying at Susanna's place was my first experience with airbnb. She was a very gracious host and the room and house was exactly as described. Very positive experience. Susanna was warm and friendly and the space was clean and homey. Would definitely recommend.
1796302,26202465,2015-02-06,23271378,Chris,"My flight ended up arriving 3+ hours late and I didn't make it to their house until after 10:30. Susanna was quick to respond to my messages as I was letting her know that my flight kept getting pushed back later and later.

The bedroom and private bathroom are downstairs and are very comfortable and quiet. Their gray cat is probably the friendliest cat I've ever met and he hung out downstairs with me for a while after I arrived. They also have a very friendly dog who enjoys having the back of his neck scratched and stepping on your feet. Bonus points if you see the calico and get her to come up to you.

It was raining (it's Seattle, so yeah) the morning after I arrived and Susanna loaned me an umbrella so I could go out and explore Fremont for a little while before transferring to my hotel for the night.

This was only my second AirBNB stay, and it was excellent. Definitely recommend them and would certainly consider staying again.

Uber ride to my hotel a few blocks from the market was about $10 if you want to get a ride into town from their place."
1796302,26236979,2015-02-07,7676913,Ryan,"Had a very last minute request to stay with Susanna & Patrick.  They graciously accepted and allowed my girlfriend and I to stay the evening in their AMAZING house with their AMAZING pets.  Very cozy bed, got great sleep. Private bathroom was wonderful as well!  Only got to chit chat a little bit but both hosts were so easy to talk to and very interesting.  I would stay here again in a second!! FULLY RECOMMEND!! "
1796302,26348541,2015-02-09,14851193,Alyshia,"Susanna was an amazing hostess - super friendly and helpful. We booked very last minute and she accepted our request within 5 minutes, and we also arrived much later than expected on a Sunday night and she stayed up and even chatted with us a bit once we got there. She helped us find a restaurant/bar that was open late and answered any questions that we had about the area. Speaking of the are - Fremont is awesome!! Super close to a bunch of cool breweries/bottle shops and great restaurants (Vegan and gluten-free options abound!) and only a 10 minute ride into the city (cab fare was super cheap also). All in all a great experience :)"
1796302,26464272,2015-02-13,4138425,Richard,I felt very welcome at Susanna and Patrick's home from the moment I arrived - very warm and welcoming people.
1796302,26642914,2015-02-16,12012154,Anne,"My boyfriend and I had a great Seattle trip, thanks in large part to Susanna and Patrick's hospitality!  They couldn't have been nicer.  They made check-in and check-out very easy, and in addition to all the amenities offered in their  home, they provided an extensive list of the many things to do around Seattle – many within walking distance of their home.  We didn't know much about Seattle prior to our visit, and we certainly lucked out with the location of this Fremont spot, and the abundant street parking made it easy to hop in our rental car and explore the rest of the city.  Their cats were very friendly, and wound up not being an issue for our allergies.  The room was clean and suited all of our needs...we would highly recommend this space and would be happy to stay here again if the opportunity presented itself!"
1796302,26841099,2015-02-20,13114174,Goria,"Susanna & Frank are very nice & considerate, they provided me with very detailed information regarding transportation, and recommendation on places to see, entertainments & restaurants etc, also snack & tea are provided, I even found chocolates under the pillow, Susanna also sent me Chinese New Year Wishes, they are so sweet : ) And their dog & cats are very friendly, one of their cat even slept with me at the night when I arrived : ) Moreover, I like the decorations in the house. During my stay, I made myself at home also enjoyed good privacy in their house. "
1796302,27011228,2015-02-23,12781970,Alex,"Susanna and Patrick were excellent hosts, and their townhouse in Fremont was absolutely lovely to stay in. We were worried about disturbing them because our flight into Seattle didn't get us to their place until close to 2am for check-in but they were super accommodating and gracious about it! And the day after our late arrival Susanna made sure to personally check in with us to make sure we had everything we needed to be fully comfortable and that we didn't miss out on any info due to our late arrival time. Their 3 pets (1 dog, 2 cats) were so friendly and cuddly and brought extra joy into our stay. And the accommodations themselves were very spacious, our room and bed were super comfortable and we had our own bathroom with a spacious shower. Their townhouse location also made it super easy for us to get almost anywhere in Seattle, it was only a single bus ride to downtown and at worst a 10 minute Uber/Lyft ride to another neighborhood. Their immediate neighborhood was also great to explore: we ate at 2 restaurants within walking distance of the townhouse that we really enjoyed. Thank you Susanna and Patrick for a great stay!"
1796302,27151003,2015-02-26,15121499,Kathryn,"I love staying here! Susanna is a fantastic host, who considers every detail to make her guests  feel comfortable and welcome. The space is great! Super private and in a wonderful location. I highly recommend and would love to stay again!"

We loved the Fremont  area. It had great restaurants, and was close to everything. Will definitely stay with Susanna and Patrick again!"

Howard houseknecht"
1796302,27595700,2015-03-08,96737,Len,"Susanna is a gem. We were only here for one night but she greeted us warmly and made sure every detail for our visit was ""just right"". Her home is charming, newer construction so quiet and comfortable, but traditional style with artistic touches throughout. Our room is comfy and the bed first rate. Did I mention the toast, coffee, jam?

Susanna provided a written listing of nearby restaurants and made recommendations we will be trying today; there are many within walking distance. Our plan is to your the Fremont neighborhood before moving on. Right now I'm writing this in their living room while the aging dog and two mellow cats snooze nearby.

So...barring allergies to lovely pets or challenges with stairs please make this your home away from home."
1796302,27847394,2015-03-13,4138425,Richard,This is my second time staying with Susanna and Patrick and it was wonderful - felt welcomed throughout and had great conversations and advice on places to see and things to do.
1796302,27946742,2015-03-15,27862114,Stephen,"Susanna and her husband Patrick were delightful to stay with. I really enjoyed the effort they put into making me feel welcome, including a fresh pitcher of water and a typed-up guide of their favorite things to do in Seattle. Their home is spacious but cozy, and the room had a comfortable bed and its own bathroom. The best part of staying here was definitely talking with the hosts, though - they are extremely friendly and we shared some great conversation over coffee that they made the morning that I left. I would highly recommend this listing, and would absolutely stay with them again in the future!"
1796302,28517729,2015-03-25,11333183,Ellen,"This is the second time I have stayed with Susanna and Patrick and their space is just ideal!  They are the most gracious hosts anyone could ask for! The room and bath are great, along with all the privileges of the house.  I highly recommend Susanna in every way possible! She and Patrick, and the pets,  have become my second family in Freemont! I wouldn't stay anywhere else!  Ellen Hayden"
1796302,29092903,2015-04-04,21146225,Emma,"Susanna and Patrick were wonderful hosts! They were extremely helpful in guiding us where to explore and what to do throughout Seattle. They made sure our stay was comfortable the entire time we were there. The room and bathroom were perfect and clean, exactly what you're looking for when traveling. Fremont is an awesome location, so close to the city by a quick bus trip and so many cool places in Fremont which is all by walking distance. Definitely recommend staying at Susanna and Patrick's whilst visiting Seattle! "
1796302,29613241,2015-04-10,28585413,Gregory,"Susanna and Patrick were wonderful hosts in lovely Seattle!  My girlfriend and I had a private bedroom and bathroom in the lower level of Susanna's home, but were able to enjoy the kitchen, living room, and rooftop deck (with stunning views of Mt. Rainier) at our leisure.  Overall we found the accommodations more than met our expectations. 

Susanna provided us with much-needed information about Seattle and the surrounding neighborhoods.  Fremont is a lovely part of the city with a few fantastic restaurants and cafes within a block or two of Susanna's home and a whole lot more a short walk (0.5 miles) down the hill.  Having a rental car definitely helped get around the city, especially if you're looking to explore the downtown area and other parts that are a bit far from Fremont. (Hint: avoid lot parking - we found it relatively easy to find street parking and it was a lot cheaper).

And the pets! Susanna and Patrick have two cats and a dog, and they're all lovely animals.  Expect to become very close friends with their grey and white cat, who spent a good amount of time downstairs with us (he's one of the nicest cats you'll ever meet).

Overall we loved our stay in Seattle.  Three days simply wasn't enough time for us to see everything we wanted, but we did as much as would could and loved every minute. "
1796302,29753385,2015-04-12,1892274,Gayle,"Susanna and Patrick are helpful , hospitable,and more than willing to answer questions and make recommendations.  Our accommodations were  squeaky clean,attractive,comfortable, and set up with great thought to absolutely everything we might need . It is only a few minutes walk to a large number of restaurants and a short drive to most places a visitor to Seattle would want to go. Highly recommended!"

You barely notice their pets, but all of them are friendly. I'm allergic to cats but haven't had any problems.  the view from the deck is awesome. Enjoy it while eating your sandwich from Paseo's ;-)
It's one of a couple really good restaurants in this neighborhood.  There are two bus stops nearby. So even without a car you can get around pretty easy. Next time we come to Seattle we definitely want to stay there again."
1796302,31188438,2015-05-03,7935682,Becca,Susanna and Patrick made us feel like family. Our room was cozy and comfortable with every attention to detail. We had full privacy downstairs. The rooftop deck was a fabulous place for coffee in the morning. We will definitely stay here again.

From the start, communication was smooth, quick, and easy via text messages. Upon arrival, Patrick greeted us and gave us a tour of their beautiful home. Everything inside and outside the home was exactly like the pictures shown on Susanna's profile. Susanna, Patrick, and their pets were friendly and made my boyfriend and I felt welcomed throughout our stay. Can't thank them enough for their hospitality! Wonderful host!!"
1796302,32446529,2015-05-18,21948363,Christian,"It was a very nice and comfortable stay at Susanna and Patrick's house in Fremont.

The bed was very comfortable!

The bad: the WiFi is a little slow.

I would certainly stay with Susanna again!"

"
1796302,33267069,2015-05-26,31398760,William,"Our 1st Airbnb stay feeling a bit anxious about staying in the same space as the host.  Anxiety gone..  Our bedroom suite with bath on lower floor, and main floor shared with Susanna and Patrick who pretty much staying in their upper loft most of the time making it feel as if the entire house were to us Solely.  Susanna very attentive, and fast responses to all communications.  Our hosts really helped make our stay as private as possible.  Guests with pet allergies carefully inquire.  Cats don't like closed doors.  "
1796302,33768294,2015-06-01,10486070,Jessica,Staying with Susanna and Patrick was wonderful! Susanna is a fantastic host with a lot of knowledge about Seattle and the surrounding areas to help guide us on our trip. She is very prompt in answering any questions or addressing concerns and is more than gracious. It was clear from the beginning that our comfort and convenience was one of her main priorities. We didn't get to spend a lot of time with Patrick but the little time we did get to spend with him was delightful. They are very kind and their pets are so cuddly- I considered taking one of the cats home. ;) I would recommend them to everyone I know! 
1796302,34024665,2015-06-03,33977249,Myleen,"Our first experience with AirBnb was very pleasant, all thanks to Susanna and Patrick. Susanna was very easy to talk to and she made sure we were comfortable from the beginning. Unfortunately we didn't see/meet Patrick, but we did meet their kids (dog and cats). One of their cats was so friendly; he joined us in our room quite a few times. They have a lovely home. The location was very convenient to everything we wanted to see. I would definitely stay with them again and recommend them to a friend."
1796302,34220081,2015-06-06,14845048,Moritz,"We had such a great time in Seattle thanks to Susanna and Patrick. 
It is obvious that Susanna has a lot of experience with guests, she takes care perfectly of travelers needs and provides everything you might need. Moreover there is a lot of useful information provided in the Welcome Guide that she hands to guests. 
Their lovely house is conveniently accessible by public transportation. We had the basement with a private washroom almost completely to ourselves. We could use their kitchen, the living room and the patio, which has a great view over Seattle, as well. I only wish we had spent more time there!"
1796302,34524003,2015-06-09,25298126,Laura,"Susanna and Patrick were so nice! Had a wonderful time in Seattle and felt really welcome. The bed was one of the most comfortable I ever had, the public transportation is really close and there are a lot of nice restaurants nearby"
1796302,34763043,2015-06-12,25533647,Hueiju,"Susanna and Patrick made our first airbnb experience very lovely! The house is located in a serene neighborhood in Fremont, close to everything you'll ever need. There are wonderful restaurants, popular tourist sights, and you can get to downtown in less than 30 minutes by a short walk to a nearby bus stop. Susanna and Patrick are very welcoming and conversational. We're so appreciative that they shared their kitchen and nice food/coffee/beverages with us. Dining on their rooftop deck is one of the most unforgettable experiences in Seattle - we were so lucky that the Mount Ranier appeared in sight after a cloudy morning, and a lovely humming bird came to say hello in time before we finished our lunch! Oh, and we miss Royko the lovely cat sooooo much....he's the most friendly and adorable cat we've met 3"
1796302,34988200,2015-06-14,33753714,Marla,"This was my first time staying at an airbnb and it was a GREAT experience. My boyfriend and I came out for a wedding and it was in a cute neighborhood in Fremont. We went to a near by coffee and wine bar, which was excellent. In addition, went to an excellent near by restaurant, RockCreek.

Susanna was extremely accommodating by letting me arrive early so I could get ready for the rehearsal dinner. The house was clean and comfortable. My favorite part about the place is the balcony upstairs that overlooks the city. Perfect place to go for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine. I would recommend  yo stay here if they are visiting Seattle."
1796302,35064660,2015-06-15,10989056,Christoph,"We had the most wonderful time staying at Susanna and Patrick's  place. The neighborhood was nice, parking was no problem and downtown Seattle ist just a short bus ride away.
Our room was clean and comfortable, as was our private bathroom.
Crispy bagels, amazing coffee (thank you Patrick!) and a nice chat were also most welcome for sure.
We have to come back for longer!"
1796302,35766662,2015-06-22,26703906,Vicky,"Susanna was amazing, she greeted us at the door even though we arrived late in the evening. The set up is amazing, didn't need a thing and the information she provides you with will get you to all the tourists spots with no problem. I would definitely recommend anyone to Susanna & Patrick, they were phenomenal in making you feel welcomed. "
1796302,36090754,2015-06-25,26354,Claire,"A wonderful stay!! Susanna was so warm and helpful, and has done so much to make her guests' stay comfortable, from the super-soft sheets to the little basket of toiletries in the bathroom to the books on Seattle and packet with suggestions for things to do and tips for getting around.  I would recommend this spot to anyone! "
1796302,36518522,2015-06-29,15173053,Martin,"Susanna was welcoming, has the place well organized, and was flexible about our arrival and departure details. The accommodation was really comfortable, quiet, and had everything we needed. Upper Fremont is a great little neighborhood, is easily walkable to lower Fremont, and buses downtown are frequent and two blocks away. "
1796302,36802071,2015-07-01,15377122,Coline,This was perfect! Susanna and Patrick are very nice and helpful! 
1796302,36935412,2015-07-02,36501296,Katrina,"Susanna was delightful and had thought through all the little details like toiletries and a fan for air flow. She was really welcoming as well and everything was so great, in spite of it being a last minute booking! Also love her pup and kitty. My friend got a good picture of me and the cat snuggling in the morning, in spite of only being there one night."
1796302,37453230,2015-07-07,30663242,Julia,"Susanna and Patrick are wonderful hosts! Susanna greeted us warmly, gave us a thorough tour of our room, kitchen, and the roof deck, and also gave great suggestions for neighborhoods to see and things to do. Our room was clean and inviting, and they even included tea, chocolate, and a welcome guide on the nightstand. The neighborhood is quiet, pedestrian-friendly, and feels very safe, both during the day and at night. The view from the rooftop deck is spectacular. Best of all: their pets are so sweet, particularly their gray cat, who will give you all the cuddles. "
1796302,37659104,2015-07-09,6200426,Lauren,"Staying at Susanna's place was great. We loved the location- it is in a residential neighborhood so it was quiet, but right around the corner were a number of delicious places to eat and get coffee. It is also near a number of bus lines so it made it very easy to get to downtown and to Ballard. Susanna was a great host because she was able to balance being attentive to our needs while still giving us space and privacy. The room is on the smaller side, but the view from the deck and having our own floor with a very nice private bathroom made it worth it. We also loved the cat who wanted to hang out in our room whenever we were there! "
1796302,38254512,2015-07-14,11430454,Paul,"There is only one word to describe our stay with Susanna and Patrick:  splendid.  They were warm and welcoming hosts throughout our visit to Seattle, and very helpful in guiding us through the city and its many attractions.  We enjoyed getting to know them (and their pets!)  Our room was cozy, clean and comfortable.  We relished our mornings,  sitting on their deck and watching the city go by.  Additionally, we appreciated their Fremont neighborhood, and spent many happy hours exploring it.  In short, we had a wonderful time, and hope to return someday.
"
1796302,38470061,2015-07-15,9350022,Katie,"Susanna was an amazing and attentive host! She was flexible with our late arrival time and checked in with us en route from the airport to make sure we didn't get lost. Her home is very bright, sunny and welcoming! She gave us a tour and showed us what was available in the kitchen for breakfast, which was laid out very well for guests. We had the lower floor to ourselves which included a bedroom and our own bathroom. Very nice and quiet neighborhood close to Greenlake. Will definitely consider staying with Susanna again next time we are visiting Seattle!"
1796302,38993861,2015-07-20,30769747,Lynda,"From the moment I arrived I felt like I was wrapped in a warm blanket.  Susanna greeted me warmly and provided all of the information I needed for my trip.  She and her husband were perfect hosts making me feel like a priority.
The home (located in one of the best neighborhoods of Seattle)  was quiet, comfortable, clean, and inviting. Everything I needed was within walking distance to the B&B.  My morning walk was around  beautiful Green lake and then off for coffee at a small, intimate coffee shop around the corner.  Finish off the morning with a breathtaking view of Mt. Ranier from the upper deck.

The bedroom and bathroom were clean and well furnished.

As stated in the listing, it was very easy to get to downtown Seattle by public transit. There are several great restaurants in the area (we loved Pie!). 

Overall, we had a pleasant stay and would recommend Susanna's to anyone visiting the area.  "
1796302,40401113,2015-07-30,19345740,Max,All was good. Susana was very chill and friendly. Pets were nice.

They are very kind and friendly people: we really enjoyed our conversations with them. The lower floor was ours, so we had al the privacy we wanted, but we were also welcome to sit in the kitchen and the living room, or at the deck to look at that beautiful Mt Rainier and downtown Seattle. Their pets are really cute: the grey cat wants to cuddle all the time. Susanne has written a small Seattle document of a few pages with the correct busnumbers, some good restaurants in Fremont ... It was very helpful. A fantastic airbnb experience!"

I'm so glad I decided to stay in this area (not knowing Seattle and what's where), because it's such a funky and interesting place, with lots of public art, awesome restaurants, bakeries, cafes, bridges, parks, etc. Easy access to downtown Seattle by public transit and driving distance to museums, parks and local points too. Thank you for sharing your beautiful house with us!"
1796302,53564822,2015-11-09,45098624,Pia,"This was truly one of  the best accomodations I ever had: It was all cosy and comfortable, extremly clean and tidy and it felt just like a real home away from home. We had the basement all for ourselves and were welcome to use both kitchen and livingroom. Susanna and Patrick are the nicest guys ever - having plenty of helpful recommendations for our stay (you can save space in your suitcase and leave the travel guide at home :-) Besides: There are lot's of travel books and magazines provided in the room.

Communication was fast and easy which was extremly helpful since we booked our stay only two days in advance. The area they are located in is great - there's a good choice of restaurants, bars and cafes just within short walking distance, the centre of Fremont itself is very nice and worth seeing and to the city centre (Pike Place Market, etc.) it's just a 20 Minuten busride. I highly recommend this place and I also recommend to immediately book it if it's free because their home is so popular that they are booked up most time of the year. And of five stars I definitely rate this wonderful place a six!"

The accommodations are just like home - very comfortable, quiet and private.  They are great AirBnB hosts as they really practice the right balance between taking care about me and leaving me on my own when I want to be.  I will for sure stay there again (if they will have me)"

Immediately after walking into the apartment, I was overcome with joy. After a long day of traveling I somehow get at home. Erin was an amazing host. There wasn't a moment where I hesitated to ask a question or where a response wasn't received within minutes. By the end of my trip, I did not want to leave! Loved every aspect of this listing and the gracious hosts made it all the better. Hope to stay again during my next trip out west."

Jean couldn't have been more communicative, available to help or have better style. Her loft was minimally decorated but had charm and style. The rooftop view was an even more amazing treat getting an amazing skyline view of the entire downtown with the Space Needle right in the center. Great neighborhood for a stroll to grab a coffee. Couldn't recommend this place more! "

It was our first Airbnb experience and it was great!

7775663,57333372,2015-12-24,51087567,Josh,"Firstly, Jean was super responsive to all inquiries both about the apartment as well as the area. The loft isn't right on the Pike/Pine corridor, nor on Boradway, but it's nearby to both. It was quiet, clean, and convenient."

4629020,34114170,2015-06-05,24477206,Denis,"I have stayed in Joy’s apartment for 5 months, and I have sincerely enjoyed living there. The place is very comfortable and well furnished. The apartment contains everything that is needed to feel home, including an oven, a microwave, a refrigerator, a dishwasher, a TV, a washer and a dryer.  Everything functioned well and was clean. 

Joy is also a very nice host. She made me feel welcome and was easy to reach if there was any problem. It always was a pleasure to talk with her.

The neighborhood is simply ideal. Every house seems to have beautiful gardens with tall trees and various flowers; this apartment’s garden is no exception! Whenever the sky is clear, one has a wonderful view on Mount Rainier from the apartment’s balcony. While the neighborhood is very quiet, there are grocery stores, cafés and restaurants nearby. Downtown Seattle can also be reached conveniently after only a short bus ride. "
4629020,35391489,2015-06-18,865360,Su Wei,"Joy's place was such a wonder, located in a quiet neighborhood with such pristine environment. My family and relatives from Malaysia loved it the moment we saw the place. With a bathroom that looks something out of a hotel catalog and a kitchen that comes fully equipped with everything we need to cook up a good meal, we thoroughly enjoyed the experience living here. Joy's garden was such a joy for my family to walk around, my father sat for hours, admiring the beautiful Seattle skyline while enjoying his cup of tea. All in all, it was a very satisfying experience for my whole family and it was the perfect location to get to anywhere with bus stops dotted around the neighborhood. "
17951,51488,2010-06-10,110908,Di,It is a cute and kinda quaint place (a nice little yard too;) The hosts are very nice and accommodating. We ended up inviting our local friends over to have dinner and enjoy the big and clean kitchen/dining room with us. It is definitely a great deal for the price. Free and spacious street parking in front of the house is also a plus. Only several blocks away from the center of this west seattle neighborhood where we got groceries. 
17951,52618,2010-06-13,61163,Jennifer,"This is a great space hosted by very thoughtful folks - they thought of most everything their guests might want to have on hand. The house is old and has tons of charm, lots of light and great views. I really enjoyed my stay."

It had everything we could have possibly needed. The location is great with lots to do nearby and Laura's suggestions were spot on. I hope we can stay again soon. I recommend this lovely, vintage spot!"
17951,23230483,2014-11-25,10642210,Andy,Laura's little studio is a great place to experience Seattle. Its cozy and makes you feel right at home. We loved it and would go back if ever in Seattle again.
17951,23530761,2014-12-03,3035173,Daniel,"Fine apartment. Very large. I could see this apartment well suited for a lengthy stay. BIG KITCHEN (tiny bathroom), Roomy living room. Great view of Sound and snow capped Olympic mountains. West Seattle is a gem. The apartment is the upper story of an old house. The floors sag noticeably in places, but this is not uncommon in older homes.  Sometimes the sounds of the people below could be heard through the wood floors. Not a huge negative. Indeed, If you like old things (and I do) this apartment will serve nicely."
17951,25493856,2015-01-18,3120633,Kristin,"Spacious, bright, great location.  Laura made everything very easy.  Much appreciated!"
17951,26815403,2015-02-20,3773826,Melissa,We had a lovely stay here. Everything was to our liking and it looked exactly as it did in the photos. Quiet neighborhood and very centrally located. Highly recommend. 
17951,27671216,2015-03-09,20916465,Ron,"Neighborhood and room were fantastic.  It was a typical pre-WWII neighborhood, with the charm those type of houses possess.  Super quiet, lots of street parking.  Listed as a ""studio,"" this room was bigger than many ""one bedroom"" units, with a large bed area, a larger ""sitting room"" attached (albeit, no divider), large kitchen, and a very small bathroom.  It was very clean and comfortable, with lots of extra towels, wash-rags and blankets."
17951,28579617,2015-03-26,15866457,Sohini,"The starlite studio was beautiful and super convenient! It's located on the cutest street on the upper floor of a very charming house. Instructions were very clear and easy, and everything we needed was inside the studio. Despite it being a ""studio,"" it was very spacious for my friend and I. The bed was a sleep number bed, which was an awesome surprise! I will definitely try and book again next time I'm in Seattle. "
17951,33465362,2015-05-28,32620877,Rachel,"Everything I expected, and more! I had no trouble finding the Starlight Studio or getting inside. Once inside, there was a binder with helpful information on a variety of topics. I was surprised by how much space  there was, and how many amenities were available to me. Thank you Laura!"
17951,34952759,2015-06-14,6530057,Chelsea,"I booked this apartment on behalf of my parents. It was clean and had everything they needed. It was easy to find, and they'll happily stay again!"
17951,39525554,2015-07-24,6459621,Emma,"We loved everything about the Starlight Studio! The apartment is adorable and very functional. Laura was responsive and quick to offer help (though everything was perfect). We were initially skeptical about staying in West Seattle without a car, but the C line was very conveniently located near the apartment. Plus, we were able to see Seattle from Alki beach, which was beautiful! Highly recommend the Starlight!"
17951,42463989,2015-08-13,29948802,Colette,"We were extremely impressed by the Starlight Studio. The apartment was much larger than it seemed in the photos -- more like a 1 bedroom than a studio and it was clean and well decorated. You could tell that the building is quite old, but that added to charm. The room had a beautiful view of the water and sunset. I was a little apprehensive about being in West Seattle rather than in a more central location, but since we had a car, this was no problem at all. In fact, the West Seattle neighborhood was very charming and I'm glad we had an opportunity to see it during our stay."
17951,46870516,2015-09-14,1589487,David,"Great place!  Very quiet neighborhood, very accessible to the rest of West Seattle and Seattle, clean and comfortable!  "
17951,52070700,2015-10-26,43300641,Leslie,"We really enjoyed our stay in West Seattle.  This apartment was comfortable and quiet, and in a lovely residential area.  Several great restaurants are an easy walk away, and the boat taxi to the Seattle waterfront is nearby as well.  Laura was easy to connect with by email or phone, and always responded promptly to our communications.  The apartment is cute and has a nice kitchen, should you want to cook in.  We recommend staying at the Starlight.  "
17951,53416234,2015-11-08,26815286,Pryor,"This studio is a gem and the host, Laura, makes everything about staying here simple and comfortable. The kitchen is well stocked with implements and an assortment of supplies and goodies. The living area is spacious yet inviting.  I'd return again - maybe even make a separate trip just for that purpose."
17951,54164473,2015-11-16,45684234,Amaris,"Absolutely Wonderful! My husband and I went to Seattle for a quick weekend get away for some much needed R&R. The Startlight studio was everything and more! I would like to mention a few extra gems that made our stay perfect! 
Heat Lamp in the Bathroom- Seattle can get a bit chilly, the heat lamp was a nice warm hug after a nice hot shower. 

60's inspired kitchen- It was so fun cooking up breakfast on a vintage stove! It was also nice to have coffee and snacks available. 

24 hour grocery store (SafeWay)
All of our needs were met with the 24hour grocery store down the same street as our stay! 

Sleep Number Bed- I think this is the reason we never left earlier than noon each day of our trip!

Overall Thoughtfulness- This was my first time ever trying Airbnb, and it was better than  any hotel. The studio provided everything from sightseeing info, snacks, extra linens, and a safe peaceful environment perfect to gain clarity in ones life. 

P.S. The Starlight Studio is really close to all Seattle attractions. Average time frame in GPS was 10 min to most areas.

17951,57996496,2015-12-31,2094605,Tony,Charming apartment with a view of the water. The host thinks of everything. Very comfortable and well furnished. Highly recommend!
8083242,46984179,2015-09-14,8355738,Priskila,"This is my first time using Airbnb. i am a mother sending son to college  that is located 20-30mins by bus/driving to the college. but we still stayed in the property for a week hoping it won't quite be a problem as we wanted to enjoy the downtown seattle before moving to closer neighbourhood. The neighbourhood of Bryan's is not quite close to the downtown itself. it's  approx 10 blocks from the clubs, cafes and downtown area. But Bryan has been very helpful to us that we could directly spot some great restaurants in downtown. Overall Amazing stay but I just didn't expect that a cat lives in the house and i am very allergic to the lovely creature. Bryan also moved in when we expected that it's entire apartment with one empty second bedroom so we would have a little bit privacy. i tried to be tolerable with the cat although Bryan moved her to his girlfriend's house but because i am also a housemother so i can't tolerate furry and dust left behind by the cat. Last few days of our stays i feel a bit hard to breathe. Overall we had great First experience because we can cook just like at home"
8083242,47823143,2015-09-21,42794326,Eddie,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I have to say, Bryan made it a great and worry free experience. Though we hardly interacted due to my schedule, he gave me the privacy I needed and made me feel welcome to used his apartment. The location was safe and minutes away from South Lake Union. "
8083242,48922560,2015-09-29,24236729,Jorge,"Bryan was very nice eh en we arrived! Je give as advice an toked as to the gas station that was near by.
The apartment was big but dirty. He left ine of the two bedroom in total disorder, even with two empty bottles of beer and clothes!
Under the bed and the sofá it was full of dirt!
The apartment is walking distance to downtown."
4520179,24939345,2015-01-04,23589023,Shelby,"Joy and Jeff are wonderful people. They were very welcoming, kind, and helpful from the get-go. They provided me with wireless internet when I asked for it and understand that I have an extremely busy schedule to work around. They would come and check in on me to make sure everything was replenished and that my stay was enjoyable. I enjoyed living here so much, that I have already created another rental for the next couple of months."
4520179,27550730,2015-03-07,22571422,Weibin,"It is so glad to meet Jeff and Joy. They are so kind and considerate.  They wait until 12:30 AM to meet me on the first day because of my  flight delay.  What is more,  they put some Chinese stuff in the unit  such as chopsticks, slippers and also Chinese version instructions for machines because I am a Chinese. These make me feel very touched. They also checked on me very day to make sure I enjoyed the stay and I really did. I will definitely recommend my friends to stay in their unit when they come to Seattle."
4520179,31054190,2015-05-01,15671339,Karen,"Before the trip Joy and Jeff were quick to answer our email queries and gave clear and simple instructions for check-in and out.
We found the flat to be clean and quiet and in a safe location close to amenities and tourist attractions. There was a lovely spot on the roof for sunning and relaxing. There was however a problem with the internet which never worked while we were there.  Also the apartment was sparsely outfitted with bare essentials for cutlery, dishes, utensils and towels.  None of this however dampened the enjoyment of our visit."
4520179,33397191,2015-05-27,3894767,Cindy,Good location near many attractions. Apartment has a lot of amenities  (rooftop and gym) which are great pluses.
4520179,33681956,2015-05-31,14556613,Shannon,"Joy was a great host, with good communication prior to and during my visit, and very clear instructions. Thank you!

The apartment was clean, two bathrooms are nice, W/D in unit are great, internet worked perfectly, and I made use of the exercise room in the building. It's a great building in a convenient neighborhood! As a previous reviewer noted, the supplies in the unit were sparse, particularly in terms of the kitchen, so keep that in mind if you are planning to cook. Also, the couch that folds down to the 2nd bed is not comfortable as a bed; I guess it ultimately got the job done, but it might be a problem for some."
4520179,40426228,2015-07-31,29578122,Marco,"I had an summer internship in Seattle and lived here for two months, and the experience was really amazing in all aspects!!
 
1. Location: very very convenient, 10 min walking distance to a great waterfront park, downtown financial and shopping area, pike market, Amazon campus, wholefoods, 2 min walk to space needle. The neighborhood is also very safe and quiet!

2. Apartment: the apartment is very new and nicely furnished. The washer and dryer in the unit are especially helpful. Joy and Jeff prepared pretty much everything you need in the unit. The building also has a nice gym and an amazing rooftop area with great scenes and good for gatherings.

3. The super nice hosts: Joy and Jeff don't live in the apartment, but they would frequently check in and ask what I needed. They gave me great advices on where to visit and regular updates on summer events going on in Seattle. 

I would tell two (website hidden) that I was particularly impressed by.

*Anecdote 1: I was especially impressed that they even bought a TV and Netflix account for me not long after I moved in because they wanted me to have more entertainment options in the unit. 

*Anecdote 2: I had a friend visiting me in the middle of the summer. As soon as Joy and Jeff heard about that they bought a memory foam mattress and brought it to the unit to make the downstairs bed more comfortable! 

Overall, they really provided a very comfortable and amazing experience. I felt really at home. I highly recommend it to everyone from those who are only looking to spend a few days in Seattle to those who are staying for more than a month like me."
4520179,41924060,2015-08-10,16221033,Sam,"Joy's place was clean and felt very welcoming. The rooftop was great for relaxing and enjoying the view, The condo is in a great location, it's close to the downtown and the space needle/seattle center. I walked everywhere and it was nice being close. I ate a many great restaurants close by as well. 
Overall I had a great experience and would recommend this place to anyone."
4520179,44185519,2015-08-24,25255616,Michael,"Joy is a well organised and a friendly host who made us feel very welcome. Prior to arriving, Joy sent through very detailed instructions on how to check in and even how to get from the airport to their apartment - which was extremely simple and much appreciated. The apartment is very clean and comfortable with ample space for 3 people. The location is fantastic, clean and full of friendly locals. The apartment is walking distance to the markets, space needle and downtown shopping area.  Thank you so much for a great stay. We'd definitely stay here again."
4520179,44754860,2015-08-29,28321583,Deborah,"We were greeted by Jeff (Joy's Husband) on our arrival at the apartment. He kindly showed us how to access the building and showed us through the apartment. It was clean and spacious and on the top floor. It was really quiet at night. It is in an excellent location and there are many restaurants a few minutes walk away. We were also able to walk to the Space Needle, EMP museum and the Chihuly glass and garden exhibition. It is a 30 minute walk to Pike st markets or there is public transport available nearby. We had a lovely time in Seattle and really enjoyed this apartment."
4520179,46143024,2015-09-08,37694553,Dianne,Location was GREAT! Joy was very attentive and was available if we needed anything! Would recommend this listing to anyone who is wanting a great SEATTLE experience.   
4520179,48795568,2015-09-28,27569445,Steve,"I had a great Airbnb experience! They provided us snacks and even a bottle of wine for my birthday. The photos are accurate and just what I expected. We really enjoyed how spacious it was and the fact that it had a rooftop with views. Perfect location, with everything in walking distance!"
4520179,49624518,2015-10-05,15890709,Yun,Joy was the best host and the house was cozy. I will be back :)
6278680,35004730,2015-06-14,33855344,Charles,"Gina's place was great and very welcoming. We spent a week there and found the place very tidy and peaceful, it felt more like a quiet little cabin in the city than an urban studio, which was very perfect. 
Gina was great at keeping in touch and made sure we had all we needed.

"
6278680,35583413,2015-06-20,18018747,Matt,Our stay at Gina's airbnb was awesome!!! A cool little set up! I will definitely stay here again if I get a chance to come back to Seattle! 
6278680,36045546,2015-06-24,35098661,Tonya,"My folks stayed at the home and had an excellent experience. Gina was very responsive and answered our inquiries quickly and had all the info needed to check in ready to go. The mini kitchen was simple but nicely outfitted and the treats left delicious (from the candy and salty snack foods, beverages in the fridge, coffee/tea choices to the special bakery tarts left one morning). The bed was comfortable - it had been hard to find a place with a King bed. The unit was well fixed up and comfortable to hang out in. They prefer a bit more bathroom space, especially counter space. All was clean and ready to go at check in. Thanks, Gina!"
6278680,38238940,2015-07-13,21360873,Dave,"Gina's Cozy West Sea studio was definitely a great place to stay.  We had a last minute booking for my mom.  Gina was super responsive and in communication to make sure the place was ready for arrival.  The studio was super comfy, lots of light, lots of privacy including outdoor seating and eating area, quiet, easy parking, easy access.  Had everything Mom needed to feel comfortable.  And the extra touches Gina provided, including a loaf of fresh baked bread, made things perfect.  Mom is already looking forward to staying again on her next visit."
6278680,38662744,2015-07-17,37851019,Celeste,"Gina was an awesome host, she set the bar very high! We had a great time, not to mention a TV with channels for days!  Also, a king bed , microwave, and refrigerator ! Place was great!
"
6278680,39115707,2015-07-20,38496897,Lc,"This was my first experience with airBnB and it couldn't have been more perfect. The cabin is located in a nice, quite residential area. Beautifully furnished & comfortable. It even has a little private yard! Kitchen was well stocked with necessities & even some lovely snacks! Cable TV, great wifi connection. Directions clearly laid out for both. Ample parking right next to cabin is an added bonus. Easy drive to everywhere, but away from the hustle & bustle of the city which adds to the peacefulness of the place. SO much nicer than a hotel. Gina is an A-1 hostess and stayed in constant contact so that nothing was left to chance. Not only would I not hesitate to book this cabin again, I would actually be more likely to visit Seattle knowing this charming place exists! I can't recommend this place highly enough!! 5+ Stars! ☆☆☆☆☆+ "
6278680,39967770,2015-07-27,32125916,Lorenzo,"First time using air bb and Gina's studio was perfect for a weekend getaway. From the courteous snacks of kettle corn, fresh baked baguette, and local suggestions like the junction west (email hidden)uld not have asked for a better experience. Thank you! Very quick bus ride into the city. Will surely return in the future."
6278680,40795170,2015-08-02,16464887,Cindy,This place was exactly as pictured and comfortably furnished!  Very snug and quiet location.  The kitchen is very well equipped and everything was so clean!!  Gina was a great host!  
6278680,42539025,2015-08-14,1581651,Karen,"Very Clean and Comfortable studio.  Gina was welcoming and accessible.  I stayed at the studio for two weeks and enjoyed the privacy of the little yard, the parking, but most of all the bed.  I think the bed was the most comfortable I have ever slept in.  I highly recommend this retreat."
6278680,43129470,2015-08-17,36452804,Carole,"The studio was everything we expected and more--- everything so well done and good quality.  Bed was super and we loved how quiet the area was.  Wonderful extra touches, snacks, creamer in the fridge, coffee and tea choices and the BEST bread---.  This was very convenient for us as there are limited places to stay in West Seattle.  We would stay here again."
6278680,43791704,2015-08-22,5994886,Andreas,"The apartment was great! We had 3 wonderful days in SEA and it was so nice to come home to Ginas apartment. It was very clean and nice, Gina provides the kitchen with coffee and tea. Thank you again - Andreas and Fabian"
1521633,6743851,2013-08-23,8147046,Tong,"The apartment is spacious and clean. It gets plenty of sun and feels really warm especially in the afternoon. Melissa is a great host. She went to shop for a new towel when I asked for one. It was also very kind of her to introduce me to other long-term properties when she knew I was looking for one. Overall, very happy stay! "
1521633,6832652,2013-08-26,7317455,Shannon,"Melissa was very responsive and the apartment is in a great location. It was also clean and large...but not quiet (dump trucks in the alley early in the morning). We stayed there on a hot week in Seattle and the apartment was very stuffy. It's nothing fancy but worked for a cheapish stay in the city. 

We were only given one roll of toilet paper for three nights, which I unfortunately didn't realize until mid-night. Luckily we had toilet paper in our car that my husband was able to run down and get. Also, there were no paper towels to clean up messes in the kitchen. "
1521633,17110158,2014-08-07,7333245,Eric,"The apartment was clean, quiet and fairly large (400 square feet). It was indeed a 3 minute walk to campus as well as a major bus stop, the university restaurant scene and a Trader Joe's. The kitchen had basic pots and pans. I think this is definitely a better option than staying in the (overpriced) local hotels for people visiting UW.

There were a few (small) negatives. The apartment was not ready until an hour after I arrived. They were vacuuming (apparently there had been a power outage). The outside of the complex is a bit run down.  The kitchen could have been better appointed (I had to go and buy paper towels). There was no AC, but that is usually not a problem in Seattle.

But overall, a really solid experience. I would definitely recommend."
1521633,17306643,2014-08-10,4668220,Johnny,"Melissa was very helpful.  The place is comfortable, clean, and in a terrific neighborhood.  There's no A/C, which is not a big deal.  Also would be nice if there were an iron already in the unit.  But I definitely recommend renting this place."
1521633,17423712,2014-08-11,14975583,James,"We stayed in Melissa's apartment for 1 night and although Melissa was highly efficient at communicating, for us this place was very much the epitimy of over priced mediocrity. The pictures shown did accurately reflect, however the complex was on an estate, the curtains didn't cover the entirety of the window space and due to the air con being installed so you couldn't shut the window we had to endure the noises of various people breaking glass rummaging through the outside dumpster all night. This is the first negative experience we have had, so writing a negative review is not something we do often.  However we do wish to stress that this might have just been an unlucky experience for us and the apartment may be in the process of being improved, if not then just be aware that it is in a good location but that comes at a price. "
1521633,40973749,2015-08-03,2020126,Matt,Apartment was exactly as listed. Nice location and Melissa was very accommodating!
1521633,41637732,2015-08-08,4474599,Stephanie,"My stay at Melissa's apartment was great. It isn't anything fancy, but it was spacious and a 15-min walk to the UW med school where I was attending a conference (and a short walk in the other direction to Trader Joe's). There are only very basic amenities so you'll need to stock up if you're staying longer than a couple days. There was some noise outside, but nothing that kept me from sleeping. The fan kept the temperature comfortable for the most part - it was kind of hot one day when it was over 90 degrees outside, but that's unavoidable in that kind of weather (my apartment in SF has the exact same problem). It's at the top of a 3-story apartment complex, so you'll have to hike up with your luggage, but it's in a corner and felt private even though there were often other people hanging around elsewhere in the complex.

I didn't really interact with Melissa much, because everything went smoothly with checking in, checking out, and everything in between. When we did talk, she was polite and responsive. Overall, I'd recommend this apartment as a good alternative to a hotel, especially if you're staying for long enough to want a place where you can feel settled in."
1521633,49826335,2015-10-06,44542952,Lyn,"The location is very convenient for going to UW, but we didn't get a parking place because the lots has all been signed. We had to walk a long way everyday just for parking. The living condition is fine but not high standard, but the apartment met our requirement. "
3726391,17396764,2014-08-11,1298803,Karen,"Donna was great. She replied to questions promptly and was very accommodating to our needs. The house was perfect - clean, nice deck and yard, fully equipped kitchen. She even left her charcoal grill out for us to use. Donna left clear instructions for everything. We were in town for a wedding and met other out of town family at Seward Park a couple times to swim and play. The last morning we had time to take the kayaks to paddle in Lake Washington - so fun!"
4061207,49026581,2015-09-30,2394272,Michael,"Lang extended our stay for a couple days and it was just as good as the first half. Definitely recommend this home. Very cozy, nice and large !"
4061207,49298548,2015-10-02,2394272,Michael,"My wife and I just moved to Seattle and we needed a comfortable place to come home to after looking for homes. This place was incredible. Very warm, cozy and inviting. It's a HUGE house and the price is great for what you get. We enjoyed the backyard with the tables and the garden as well as coming home to some cool Bengal cats hanging out on the front porch ! The TV area is inviting, and the main living room was good for just relaxing. We walked to Capitol Hill almost every day (30 min walk) and the neighborhood is quite friendly. 

Lang was really receptive to any questions we had, and left no questions un answered in his house manual, he even extended our stay a couple days and removed the secondary cleaning fee for us. 

My only gripe with the place is that we didn't get to stay longer ! Seriously. Thanks Langdon and co. that was fun.

Michael"
4061207,54365920,2015-11-18,15738388,David,The host canceled this reservation 15 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1249060,5386274,2013-06-27,6884486,Miriam,"Noelle was pleasant and very helpful, as she certainly was not required to sit with me for what was probably at least an hour -- telling me about the location/ neighborhood of more than 30 central Seattle addresses that I had gathered for my potential new home. That advice turned out to be pretty invaluable in the short few days set aside to find a place. 
She also had a very soft bed for her guests. 
Was a great choice for my budget and as a bonus, for the purpose of learning about  Seattle from a smart, helpful native."
1249060,5663018,2013-07-10,3720004,Zachary,"I had a great time staying in Noelle's place. The bedroom was spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. Noelle was a kind and generous host."
1249060,5794620,2013-07-16,7183153,Tim,The house was comfortable and clean. Noelle was friendly and helpful. It was only a short walk to Capitol Hill for entertainment. Definitely a nice place to stay. 
1249060,6174098,2013-08-02,3979556,Trailer Trash,Noëlle's house is absolutely charming and Noëlle is a great host who makes you feel at home while respecting your lifestyle - she is really generous and kind and also a fun character to live with ! I do recommend her comfortable house and charming company to anyone who likes to share a good experience with a cool strong and independent girl ! 
1249060,6694373,2013-08-21,7897702,Brett,"Noelle was great! She has a beautiful home, very much kind of a modern rustic, bohemian kind of feel. Its very easy to take public transpo anywhere in the city and just one bus route and 20-30 min from the Pike Place Market.  Highly recommend! "
1249060,6905313,2013-08-29,8283039,Brady,"Noelle was so incredibly friendly and helpful.  Not only was it a very welcoming place to stay, but I feel I made a life-long friend."
1249060,7403666,2013-09-18,7322910,Victoria,Noelle was a great host. We enjoyed our stay. Bedroom was clean and private. Thank you again!
1249060,7628307,2013-09-27,8617658,Shannon,My stay with Nicole was absolutely fine with no problems.  The location is equally great for walking into the city center or taking the bus.  It's also close to the International District which is nice especially for the restaurants.  
1249060,7776865,2013-10-02,806131,Katie,"We had a nice time staying with Noelle. The location is awesome - super easy to take the bus from downtown (get an Orca card) and walk to everything in Capitol Hill. I wish we'd had time to try one of the Ethiopian restaurants nearby. It poured all weekend so we didn't get to enjoy the backyard, but the room looked out on it and it was very pretty!"
1249060,8675062,2013-11-11,334416,Stephanie,"clean, comfortable room in a great location!  bed & shower were A+"
1249060,8850621,2013-11-21,3900006,Anne,"Pros: The bed is super comfortable--slept like a dream! The room was clean and a good size. Good water pressure in the bathroom. Nice towels. The location was pretty convenient with a to downtown, Chinatown/ID, and Capitol Hill's restaurants were walkable. Noelle was also very positive and accommodating with requests. For instance, she busted out a hair dryer and iron for me on a Monday morning.

Cons: The rest of the apartment looked clean but ""lived in"" upon arrival, but by the end of my 3 night stay had slipped below my cleanliness comfort level. (Lots of dirty dishes left in the sink more than overnight, food left out in the kitchen). I also would have like a little more pro-active coffee/DIY breakfast provisions. (As an Airbnb host, I know that's encouraged).

All in all a good stay, a fair price, a good location."
1249060,9804763,2014-01-11,10815850,Verne,"Felt just like staying with a friend! Noelle is very warm and smart and funny - I felt at home almost at once.

Location is good for quick bus or longish walk to downtown. Bed and bath warm and clean.

Definitely recommend staying with Noelle if you like meeting interesting people and feeling more a part of the city than a traveller."
1249060,11331053,2014-03-30,12962807,Payam,"Noelle is just fantastic! 
I had a very good time at her place and with her.
Her place is very clean, comfortable, and tastefully appointed. I really did`t miss anything there. 
Noelle herself is first of all a wonderful person, who is open-minded, nice, cute, generous and very thoughtful. I`d really like to keep in touch with her, and I just can recommend her place and company to any good friend I know. 
Thank you again, Mademoiselle ;-)
Hope to see you again one day!"
1249060,12464054,2014-05-03,4705621,Gleb,"Noelle was a great host. We didn't get to hang out much, but getting in and out of the house was a breeze, the bed and house were both clean and comfortable, and the location was convenient. Getting downtown on the bus was quick and easy, and the surrounding Central District is full of fun and interesting things to do as well. Noelle gave us a few tips for places to get breakfast in the area, all of which were great. I wish we got to spend a little more time in the big backyard, maybe next time! "
1249060,12672204,2014-05-07,6533637,Lauren,"We had a great stay at Noelle's cozy home. She was quick to answer our questions upon arrival, and although we only had the chance to meet her once, she's a very warm and pleasant person with great recommendations for dining/drinks/etc. While the area is close to bus lines, we rented a car and had no problem at all with street parking. I'd definitely consider staying here again due to its location and the host's accommodations. "
1249060,12933597,2014-05-14,10599785,Jacques,"Noelle is amazing! Very friendly and supportive. She gave me great support with everything.

The room and the appartment as a whole where perfect, I had the feeling of being home! Also the sunny and wide backyard was incredible.

And the location is also great, just in the downtown area with the advantage of being in a calm neightbourhood with lots of public buses and great places within 5/10min walk.

I hope it will be available next time I will go to Seattle
"
1249060,13139221,2014-05-20,1639616,Julio,"Awesome Room. Very Clean and organized house. The bed was very comfortable. Quiet and nice neighborhood. Bathroom was clean, hot water, linens, the works.

Easily accessible from downtown, on a very good walk. 1/2 block away from the bus stop, which takes you straight into the core of Downtown Seattle.

The Host was *extremely* accommodating to my needs, as well as to check into the room. Noelle provided me with good information about town, recommendations, etc. Most definitely recommend this listing, and look forward to going back there again soon!"
1249060,14347051,2014-06-17,13133044,Lynn,A great location with easy access to public transportation.
1249060,14564182,2014-06-22,12515626,Adam Nur,"Noelle is very friendly and has lots of information about Seattle. She can recommend many great places such as hiking route in the national park, seafood restaurant or some places that are not ""Pikes and Pine"". The room itself is nice and tidy with lots of amenities (wifi, kitchen/dining tools, towels and bath needs). The apartment is close to bus stop that can take you to the downtown..."
1249060,14874353,2014-06-28,3118516,Charlotte,"A short but nice stay for us! It is good room with a comfy bed! The backyard is great although we didn't really have time to use it. We liked the location with walking distance to downtown, but also close to bus stops if one doesn't want to walk both ways. Noelle was friendly, helpfull and flexible with check in and check out. She also gave us good tips on things in Seattle, was quick to respond and give us usefull information prior the stay. "
1249060,15058560,2014-07-01,5349346,Ian,My girlfriend and I had a pleasant experience at Noelle's. No frills - bathroom was clean and she had left clean towels for us to use. She also gave us a couple of great suggestions on some eats! Thanks Noelle!
1249060,15271736,2014-07-06,308822,Timo,"Noelle's apartment is located conveniently to Seattle downtown and places such as Capitol Hill. The house itself is old and comfortable, although it was bit messy during our visit. 

Noelle herself is very knowledgeable about Seattle and gave good advices e.g. about restaurants. Unfortunately she was very busy during our trip and we didn't have much time for interaction but the impression we got is that she would be very interesting person to spend time with! 

However, I have to mention also that we had bit of technological problems with check-in as she had sent check-in instructions only by text message that we never received and she was working and not able to answer phone until very late.
"
1249060,15469328,2014-07-09,17178171,Yi,"Noelle's place was beyond my imagination. It is the whole first floor of a house with a large back yard. Guest can own a private room, with view of the yard. You will be just at home because Noelle is like an old friend. She is an easy going young lady. We chatted a lot, at the same time, she did respect my privacy. The best thing is  about the transit. The stop of Bus 3 and 4 is just one block away form her house. And those two buses can take you to almost everywhere you want in Seattle, such as Space needle, Pike market. "
1249060,15678856,2014-07-14,202863,Daniel,I had the most wonderful time staying with Noelle. She's a pleasure to get to know and has a wonderful place. It's situated in a quiet neighbourhood but is close by to lots of great shops and restaurants as well as being round the corner from two transit lines which run directly to downtown. I had a lot of fun hanging out with Noelle and her friends but the setup is also perfect if you just want to do your own thing. She's a fantastic source of knowledge - especially about places to eat and drink - and a lovely host to stay with. I'd stay again in a heartbeat - highly recommended. 
1249060,16006625,2014-07-20,14768610,Timothy,"My host was incredibly kind and generous to me and my girlfriend. The room she provided was big, clean, comfortable, and well lit, the backyard is beautiful, and she gave us great tips in navigating the city. I highly recommend staying here."
1249060,16252471,2014-07-24,5726686,Angus,We had a wonderful 4-nights stay.  Noelle was very helpful with tips of restaurants and getting around in town.  The location is close enough to town but the neighborhood is quiet so we slept very well.  Walking distance to International District and a short bus ride to Pioneer Square is a plus.
1249060,17169438,2014-08-08,10240988,J. Hua,"It was a good experience in general. Noelle is very nice, friendly, and warm. Helpful with information to get around in the city as well."
1249060,17847627,2014-08-18,17871336,Matthew,"This house is a perfect place to stay for anyone visiting Seattle, but 
especially if it is their first time. The house is within easy walking 
distance of downtown, as well as a bus that circulates the cities major 
attractions. If downtown isn't your thing, you won't notice how close it 
is anyway. The backyard is great for relaxing, and there is easy access to 
restaurants and grocery stores. Noelle was a great host and her house is 
really the best place we stayed on our whole trip."
1249060,18054945,2014-08-21,5653409,Stijn,"Ik heb een erg comfortabel verblijf gehad in het appartement van Noelle.
Een ruime slaapkamer, gezellige woonkamer en een praktische keuken. Vanuit het appartement loop je makkelijk in ong. 20 min. naar het centrum. Terug naar het appartement is het aan te raden om de bus te nemen, erg steile weg naar boven. 
Noelle geeft je goede tips om Seattle te ontdekken. Het was ook erg gezellig om met haar te kletsen. Op de laatste avond hebben we lekker gebarbecued. Kort om, een aanrader.
"
1249060,18484763,2014-08-27,225191,Matthew,"Noelle was awesome, she made us feel welcome and the place was just as described. Really close to Capitol Hill and Chinatown the place is on a peaceful block. My girlfriend and I stayed there for 6 nights and came and went with ease. We had a few great conversations with Noelle and her friend (who I can't remember the name if but was really cool). Great people, I would recommend this place to anyone!"
1249060,19093532,2014-09-06,20287103,Amir,"Noelle was an exceptional host. She stayed in constant contact via text messages, made things simple and made sure I arrived OK. The room is huge, warm and has closet space. The Wi-Fi is solid. There is ample parking on the street, if you're coming in with a car. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great, great deal."
1249060,19688109,2014-09-16,3306763,Martina & Flo,"Noelle was a great host. She made us feel very comfortable in her apartment as she helped us to find some space in the refrigerator and brewed us coffee in the morning. The apartment is arranged lovely. The kitchen invites you to sit around a while and to have a chat with Noelle, who can give you great recommendations no matter what you want to do in Seattle. You are also free to use the backyard as well as porch to hang out at the end of the day. It was simply an absolutely wonderful stay."
1249060,20858152,2014-10-06,2585007,Nicole,My parents had a great time staying at Noelle' s place . She is very friendly and helpful ! 
1249060,25280218,2015-01-11,16113697,Zachary,"I think a couple of the reviewers said it best - Noelle is like an old friend. She was very friendly and helpful with directions. Her home is very cozy such that you don't really feel like you're in a strange place, which is kind of nice especially after a long day of traveling.  The location is also a short walk away from the bus that heads to downtown."
1249060,26364045,2015-02-10,14988304,Stephen,"Noelle was extremely nice and helpful, she even took the time to write us a color coordinate itinerary of restaurants and cafes we should make sure to try during our stay. While we did not get a chance to try them all, the selection we were able to visit was absolutely amazing. The apartment itself is very close to enough to keep you busy for a week just within walking distance. I will make sure to recommend Noelle to friends visiting Seattle in the future, and may have to make a second trip myself!"
1249060,26708237,2015-02-17,13829791,Angie,"We were really only at the house to sleep, and were out exploring during the day. It was nice to come home to a warm room and be able to shower :). The bed was super comfy too! Noelle was so nice and chatted with us for a bit one night. She sent me a list of recommendations of what to do in Portland (that was our next stop) which I thought was really great!! I recommend staying with her. Her house was cozy and welcoming and she is super sweet."
1249060,27113910,2015-02-25,27957999,Brian,"It was my first time ever using Airbnb, and it was a very positive experience. The house and room are very comfortable, clean, and welcoming. Noelle herself is extremely friendly and nice, but not at all overbearing (which I know is a worry for some). 

The location is also good; I walked downtown almost every day, which is a mile away (20 minute walk), and I ate at several nearby restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk as well as in the popular Capitol Hill.

I really can't think of anything that would have improved my experience. Thanks Noelle!"
1249060,27410700,2015-03-03,8594457,Harmony,"Noelle was a great host.  She stayed in contact with me and answered any questions I may have about transportations, things to eat in the area, etc.  The room was very clean as well as the rest of the house.  There was a heater and fresh towels for us to use.  
The neighborhood itself was safe. I walked around at night with my friend and we came back pretty late as well.  There are many things to do within 15 minutes of walking and even more if you're willing to walk 30-40 minutes.  There's also a variety of restaurants within 10 minutes of her space."
1249060,28084850,2015-03-17,26962134,Tanja,Noelle's place was absolutely wonderful. The house has a beautiful porch and is very cozy inside. It's within easy walking distance to a number of great coffee shops and restaurants and we also made good use of the Trader Joe's a few blocks over. Noelle was very welcoming and she made sure we had everything we needed. It was great getting to know her and we felt right at home!
1249060,28314057,2015-03-22,14604607,Harley,"From the first conversation my friend and I had with Noelle, her knowledgeable, serious, and often humorous perspectives on Seattle, coupled with her confident speech was intriguing. After getting a crash course in Seattle politics and gentrification (I asked for it), Noelle made some great recommendations for restaurants, was a very warm host (not literally but her place had good heating), and was just a very laid back individual (emphasis on individual). 

For those that aren't as chatty as I tend to be, I could tell Noelle was just as comfortable explaining the basics and then vanishing into the shadows (or that could just have been finals week?). In any event, I consider staying with Noelle one of my best AirBnB experiences to date. The accommodations were exactly as portrayed and the location was great. Totally recommended!

Noelle is friendly, warm and down to earth. She made me feel welcome and her place had lots of character. It was only about 20-30 minutes walk downtown where all the main sites are. Its also easily accessible by bus. Its also near to capitol hill (lots of nice bars and eateries) and also a 30 minute walk to volunteer park. 
Overall it was a great place to stay and is highly recommend. Will definitely stay again."
1249060,30875700,2015-04-28,9332035,Sandra,Noelle's place was a pleasure to stay in. Private and comfortable room and bed. She is also a charming host
1249060,31438126,2015-05-05,5764781,Nadine,"We spent the first two nights of our honeymoon at Noelle's home. It was simply amazing! The location is great as well, it's quiet and it only takes 20 minutes to get downtown or you take the bus which is only 3 minutes walk from her house. Noelle is the BEST host we ever had on Airbnb. She is kind, very helpful and knows her city and surroundings. She even offered to contact friends that can help in other places we planned to visit.
We were there in spring so we couldn't really enjoy the backyard because it was still a bit too cold but in summertime the beautiful backyard will also be a big highlight!
We highly recommend staying at Noelle's & for next time we visit Seattle we would definitely try to stay here again.
Thx again Noelle. "
1249060,32383827,2015-05-17,32051355,Courtney,Noelle was a perfect host and very happy to help our stay in Seattle a great one! We had somewhat indefinite plans with the ever changing Pacific Northwest weather and Noelle was happy to be available when we got in. Would definitely recommend. 
1249060,32713758,2015-05-20,3496100,Jessie,"We had a great time in Seattle. Noelle gave us some very good restaurant recommendations and was very friendly and quick with communication. Noelle kept to herself for the most part which was fine with us as we weren't at the house too much. We loved being near the Capitol Hill shops and a bit removed from the city. 
A couple things as recommendations; the backyard was in need of a clean up, especially since the yard is a main point that is advertised for this rental. Also there were dirty dishes (not ours) left in the sink for a couple days during our stay and the bathroom ran out of toilet paper and had no backup supply. These were small issues... Overall, we really enjoyed our stay at Noelle's. Thanks!"
1249060,33092428,2015-05-25,29844522,Mark,"Noelle was very friendly and helpful, her place was easy to find and not far from town - an easy 15-20min walk.  I would recommend her place to anyone."
1249060,33449074,2015-05-28,5093135,Grietje,"Communication was super easy with Noelle, she was very welcoming and the house was absolutely lovely. The garden was so very chilled out, great to have such a space to relax in in the middle of the city! I had a very nice time, and some good chats with Noelle about our work. Thanks Noelle!"
1249060,34069183,2015-06-04,22590535,Susan,"Noelle was a very welcoming host. I really enjoyed meeting her and had some great conversations.  One of the best things about Airbnb for me is the connection to new people.  I would gladly stay with her again in future visits to Seattle.
 The neighborhood was easy to access and to get around in.  I walked everywhere I needed to go, coffee, dining and to my daughter's home.  But super easy access to public transit if you want to go that route. The space I rented was clean and very comfortable.  Noelle made it easy for me to come and go as I needed."
1249060,34446703,2015-06-08,27611043,Kapil,"Wonderful place and Noelle is a wonderful host. Such a green and quite neighborhood.

She was really helpful and make us comfortable. Her lovely house is great. Pubilc transportation is very convenience it is very close to her house. I totally recommand!"

The house was lovely; the room was as listed and very comfortable. The neighborhood is cute and very quiet, and it is a great location. We really enjoyed our stay and have already decided to book again in a few months!"
1249060,37462743,2015-07-07,599591,Kristina,"Easy and clear communication prior to my arrival. I only met Noelle the first night but had a great impression of a warm person with a clear vision where she is heading in life and would have loved to talk more to her. She was super nice despite the fact that she was about to leave for the next 6 months the next day. (Packing for such trips is always crazy, yikes!) She arranged for the professional Pillow homes business to be my contact during my stay there - a very well organised solution and the Pillow services person was super nice, too. Enjoyed hanging out in the garden and exploring the city. So happy I went to Fyre Art Museum, which was one of her recommendations. The place is a dreamy, cosy retreat! "
1249060,38609593,2015-07-17,34557045,Sarah,Comfortable and relaxing stay.  Convenient location and easy access to public transit.  Clear communication and follow up with both Noelle and Pillow (AirBnB's property management company)  Thanks for everything!
1249060,39280561,2015-07-22,26542057,Jonathan,Thanks so much Noelle for a wonderful experience great apartment in a perfect location.  I had a great time.
1249060,39929639,2015-07-27,32859171,Robyn,"Noelle's house was exactly as shown, but SO much more! It was the cutest and homiest home away from home. We instantly felt comfortable and excited to explore Seattle with Noelle's house as our home base. 

Her recommendations are bang on. So perfect and excellent. We had epic meals and really incredible wanders around Seattle. 

Can't wait to come back. We'll definitely be returning to Noelle's home again. "
1249060,40269760,2015-07-29,38875387,Betsy,"This place was gorgeous and in the perfect location. We couldn't have hoped for anything better. Close to adorable capitol hill and downtown, a quick jump to the airport.  Noelle was very responsive, and her place gave me some great decorating ideas for my own home. Overall a great experience. "
1249060,41347567,2015-08-07,23976719,Theo,"The apartment is really cool, lots of interesting furnishings. The garden was lovely to sit in and relax watching hummingbirds and other wildlife.

The bed was really comfy, as was the sofa.

The apartment is in a nice neighbourhood and easily accessible to other parts of the city.

The property management people were helpful and made sure the apartment was clean and ready for us whilst Noelle was away.

Noelle left a really useful folder of things she recommends which we checked out and found to be great.

Anyway, highly recommended apartment!"
1249060,41794544,2015-08-09,37366786,Ruicong,Great little house! Noelle responded quickly to questions and set everything up as indicated on the listing. 
1249060,42846211,2015-08-16,19635638,Allie,"Noel's apartment was in a great location, walking distance from Capital hill.  Everything was clean and ready to go when we got there. There was a great binder of local recommendations that was an awesome guide to navigate the city. "
1249060,45931020,2015-09-07,17871820,Marc,"Noelle at the time was on a world tour. Therefore, they could not be present. But I had always good contact with Whats App and they patiently explained everything to me.
The apartment is located in a good place. And it is easier to take the bus to Downtown. The apartment is nice.
Would always go back there towards."
1249060,46372120,2015-09-10,4474693,Rubén,Cute appartment near city center. We liked it. Stayed for two nights to see Seattle. Quiet zone.
1249060,47066783,2015-09-15,27010902,Kate,"Noelle's place was lovely.  A great home from home that made you feel welcome.  Great advice in the welcome pack, and a really nice neighbourhood. "
1249060,47373976,2015-09-18,27301235,Dustin,"Noelle's place is super cute, clean and quiet yet a short walk to all the attractions that make Seattle great (15-20 minutes up to Capitol Hill or down to downtown and Pikes Place). Although my car sat parked for the entirety of our trip, as having a car is really unnecessary, parking on her street would clearly never have been a problem. Noelle herself was always quick to respond to any questions or communications and was a gracious host. Overall we had an amazing experience staying at Noelle's in an always amazing city. "
1249060,48068663,2015-09-23,21491271,Donnita,This was our 2nd stay with Noelle.  And once again her home was just what we needed.  Even when she isn't there she is gracious.  A great place to stay and save while visiting Seattle.
1249060,49641228,2015-10-05,41838444,Christopher,"I felt very welcomed at the apartment. The guide book was very helpful, the parking pass definitely came in handy for my rental car and the neighborhood was very quiet and made downtown very accessible with the buses nearby."
1249060,50176407,2015-10-10,23300256,Dan,"Amazing area and spot, very central to most activities in Seattle. Cozy and every aspect of the decor has been thought of."
1249060,50649450,2015-10-13,31886081,Nelson,"Awesome place!  Clean, cozy, neat, affordable and close to Capitol Hill, great time and I will definitely stay again!"
1249060,51292956,2015-10-19,17479879,Ilona,"Wonderful stay at Noelle's apt.  It is comfortable, spacious, charming and a great value in a convenient location for our visit with granddaughter at Seattle U.  We enjoyed planning our days sitting in the huge kitchen looking out on the backyard - far better than a cramped hotel room.  Many maps and guidebooks are available and the location is easily accessible to public transportation.  The bed was comfortable and the shower was good.  Noelle was not there during our stay, but all of my communications with either her or Pillow were practically instantaneous. Highly recommend!!"
1249060,51675579,2015-10-22,46878383,Sean,"Great space. Comfy bed. Didn't spend much time here, basically just slept as I was here for business.

Excellent location, parking is especially easy.

Was actually waaaay more than I needed. Recommend this space for couples or 2 or more people.

Great yard. Once again, which I had more time to enjoy the the lovely space."
1249060,53603625,2015-11-10,28421239,Alison,"Noelle's place was just as advertised. It was right in the middle of everything, had just enough space for us and was exactly as pictured! Noelle was out of town so Pillow helped with any questions during her stead. It was great!"
4017140,19706919,2014-09-16,16199216,Joel,"We had a great time with Michael and Fenway and thoroughly recommend staying at this property if you are visiting Seattle. We were the first guests so I have gone into some detail about our stay. 

Michael is a thoughtful host who had really taken the time to think about what a guest might need during their stay. The house is clean and welcoming, the bed is comfortable and if you have been travelling awhile you will surely appreciate the water pressure and shower nozzle in your private bathroom or the option of a nice bath.  We had full access to the kitchen and it was nice to have some small spaces in the fridge and cupboard set aside for us. The door from your bedroom goes out into a small courtyard and carefully tended garden which is very peaceful. We found the location of the property very convenient. It takes about half an hour and $2.5 to get downtown on the bus or a 10 minutes and $10-12 in a Lyft/Cab. 

Michael is a warm and charming fellow who we felt at ease living with. He is passionate about Seattle and shared his ideas of the best things to see and do with us. He took the time to settle us in but keeps a fairly busy work and social calendar so is not an overly attentive or smothering host. The layout of the property is good for an air B&B as Michael lives upstairs, the guest room is downstairs and the middle floor is the living area. If you want to socialise you can hang out in in the living room or you can retreat downstairs if you would like a little more solitude.

Fenway is an independent hound who is very devoted to Michael. He is not the kind of dog who has to win over every person he comes into contact with. If you are not a dog person I'm sure he will be quite happy to leave you alone. He is a big boy and I would echo Michael's suggestion that if you don't like being around dogs this might not be the place for you. We put in some time with Fenway and had a lot of fun with him.

We were sad to Leave Michael's place which is a sure sign of the great time we had. If we return to Seattle we would stay here again although I expect it might not be as easy to get a booking once word gets out about this great listing."
4017140,20525659,2014-09-30,8087726,Steve,"This is an awesome place.  Michael was a very nice host.  The neighborhood is very convenience to Capitol Hill and downtown areas.  He offered to meet up with us on the first arrival with his busy schedule day.  Michael is very friendly, sociable and gave us lot of tips and ideas on what to do.  The house was clean, warm and comfortable.  Great patio access directly from the bedroom with lots of plants, fruits and vegetables for a modern townhouse.  The garden is well taken care and decorative.  We got the bathroom all to ourselves on the first level.  It is private even though it does not connect from the inside of the bedroom.  Full use of the kitchen and living room on the 2nd level.  Did not go on the 3rd floor for the washer/dryer but Michael did offer the convenience use of that at time of arrival.  Oh, did I mention that Fenway, the dog, was very friendly and well behave.  Plenty of street parking for our car.  We highly recommend your booking with Michael."
4017140,21268599,2014-10-13,6448822,David,"My partner and I had a fantastic stay at Michael's place. Communication was efficient and Michael was very flexible about us dropping of bags early. Both the the bedroom and bathroom were modern and clean, with a cute little courtyard outside. We are always reluctant to stay in rooms with sofa beds, but the sofa bed in Michael's room was extraordinarily comfortable!! We really had the best night sleep we'd had in a long time. The area is suburban and nice, with a few cute cafés within walking distance. The house is indeed close to bus stops and not far from the city, however we found the bus service to be quite unreliable (of course not Michael's fault!). If you are in a hurry, get an Uber... Only about $10 to the city and $35 to the airport. Overall we had a great stay!"
4017140,21546436,2014-10-19,22104193,Cindy,"Michael was a great welcoming and accommodating host.  He was flexible and informative.  He is personable and warm.  He made a great recommendation for breakfast, a local eatery.  His home and garden oasis were accurate, clean, and comfortable.  The neighbourhood worked well for us and was central for our activities.  We accidentally forgot to lock our car overnight, and everything was fine.  We felt safe.  The neighbourhood was attractive and friendly. "
4017140,21638722,2014-10-20,22069289,Chris,"Michael was extremely nice our entire stay and his dog, Fenway is a sweetheart!  I would like to stay here again when I come back to Seattle. The bathroom was very clean and very private.  The room was very clean and comfortable with a lot of great natural light.  I am very thankful Michael invited us into his home. I do recommend staying here if you get a chance!"
4017140,22045364,2014-10-28,5666272,Dittman,"It was a nice big room with its own bathroom in the bottom floor of a large house in a safe and quiet neighborhood. There were buses nearby that took you to other busier areas of Seattle in 20-30 mins, nice place to stay to explore the city for a few days."
4017140,23445356,2014-12-01,22590872,Leticia,"i really enjoyed to live in michael house, the house is warm and cozy . He and his dog fenway are adorables. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. i love seattle and fenway too. 3"
4017140,25340625,2015-01-12,21234894,Jessica,Michael was great. He suggested some great places to hang out and gave us a great recommendation for brunch. The bed was very comfortable and having the downstairs with the bathroom to ourselves made it very private. Fenway was of course the best part of our experience. Such a sweet boy! We are going to stay with Michael and Fenway again next weekend if we go back to Seattle.
4017140,25421756,2015-01-15,2977500,Michael,"Michael was really welcoming and helpful with information about the neighborhood. I was staying on business for a couple of days. I had the room and a nearby bathroom to myself for the entire stay. The neighborhood is a little bit suburban so there are limited dining options. However, the I-90/Rainier bus station is less than 1 mile away so it was easy to get myself to and from work. This location met my needs very effectively."
4017140,25623423,2015-01-20,21234894,Jessica,This was our second time staying with Michael. We will always choose to stay with him if we have the option. Love seeing Fenway too.
4017140,26576903,2015-02-15,20367688,Scott,"The host was courteous, amiable, and knowledgeable about the city. The room was clean with an especially comfortable sofa bed. I would stay there again. "
4017140,26637978,2015-02-16,23084498,Tiffany,"Michael and Fenway were great hosts! Michael was very easy to communicate with and very laid back. Also, although I was skeptical at first, the bed was extremely comfortable. Everything was clean and cozy and the home was in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Overall, Michael's home was a perfect choice for a place to stay in Seattle. "
4017140,28429015,2015-03-23,17440990,Connie,"Michael was a great host! He made our first Airbnb experience very effortless. We felt very comfortable going in and out of the apartment and his dog was very well trained. The neighborhood was quiet and clean, each house with unique characteristics. We felt very safe in that neighborhood. Catching public transportation downtown was also very convenient! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was both neat and stylish. "
4017140,28613871,2015-03-27,27955415,Louisa,"We had an awesome time at Michael's place! Room and bathroom are perfect for two people. And even we haven't had enough time to hang out, we felt super comfortable! The bus was close by - 4 (to Downtown) in the morning and 14 (to Mount Baker) will take you back. 
I would absolutely recommend!"
4017140,28839922,2015-03-30,29710985,Colin,"Michael was very kind and considerate. He communicated promptly and resolved several issues with me about my travel needs (check in and out times, luggage storage, etc). His flexibility was a blessing. The room itself was very nice, clean, comfortable, quiet and private. Very peaceful after long days running around. The bed was very comfortable, and the bathroom was right by the bedroom and very nice. It was everything I could have hoped for as a place to rest and recharge, I'm so grateful. Michael's dog is very nice, well behaved and quiet. Everything was great, I highly recommend staying here, I would do it again in a heartbeat. Thank you Michael!"
4017140,29099879,2015-04-04,6162253,June,Our stay in Seattle was wonderful and staying at Michael's home was cozy and stress-free. We were very comfortable downstairs and loved the private back garden. Michael was very accommodating even as our travel plans fluctuated a bit. Thanks a bunch!
4017140,29704948,2015-04-11,30536871,Michael,Michael was a wonderful host!  The house was beautiful and it was nice to have the whole floor to ourselves.  The personal garden in the back is excellent as well.  Michael took time to explain the area to us and we were even able to spend a little time with him.  Highly recommended!  Would definitely return.
4017140,30452349,2015-04-22,4546229,Guillaume,"I had a great time at Michael and Fenway's. Michael's house is a great place to stay at. You get the whole floor to yourself, which includes a bedroom with a particularly comfortable sofa bed, a full bathroom and a private garden. Ideal to relax after spending a long day walking around in the city. The neighborhood is very peaceful. Street parking is free and catching public transportation to travel downtown is easy. Michael was very flexible in terms of check-in and -out times. He is very knowledgeable about Seattle and Washington and he took the time to give me great suggestions for places to eat, drink or hang out, not to mention places to visit on my way to Portland. Thank you Michael! Oh, and Fenway is super nice too. "
4017140,30928581,2015-04-29,28429698,Szymon,"The overall experience was great, the futon was comfortable, and the rest of the house was nice. If I plan to go back to Washington for a few days I would stay here again. The neighborhood is also nice, for walking around and looking at interesting houses."
4017140,31841476,2015-05-10,20409843,Shane,Michael was a great host. Beautiful house with a great outdoor garden area. The location was convenient for getting pretty much anywhere in the city and we easily found street parking during the entire stay.
4017140,32469143,2015-05-18,5409595,Luis,"Michael is a very good host, the house is confortable and the place to stay is really confortable, excellent stay in Seattle."
4017140,33599617,2015-05-30,31310855,Melisa,"My boyfriend and I stayed here and we really enjoyed it. The bed was bigger than I was expecting and was extremely comfortable! My boyfriend says it was the first time in months his back didn't hurt in the morning. The location was also really close to downtown Seattle. Michael was really helpful and gave us detailed directions on how to get to the house. We sadly didn't get to see him that often, but felt very welcomed at his place. "
4017140,33789615,2015-06-01,8938762,Staci,"Michael's Bed & Bath + Garden Oasis was a perfect solution for my needs. Located in a quiet neighborhood setting with just what was advertised: a bedroom and a bathroom on a floor all to myself. I was visiting family in the neighborhood and remodeling in their home meant finding a nearby place to stay. I did not spend much time here, just sleeping and showering; nonetheless, it suited just right. If I need to make similar arrangements in the future, I will definitely consider staying here again. "
4017140,34450406,2015-06-08,32857050,Willem,Michael was a really nice and friendly guestkeeper! He gave us nice tips to see the best of Seattle and made us a good cup of coffee to start the day perfectly! The dog is cute and the sleepingroom and bathroom are tidy and clean!
4017140,35420640,2015-06-18,2744983,Audrius,lovely and comfortable place. easy way to reach downtown. 
4017140,35657584,2015-06-21,31620755,Shane,Michael was a friendly host and we enjoyed waking up to the garden oasis outside our door. Would stay again!
4017140,36113479,2015-06-25,17799373,Kailin,"We did not get to see Michael much, but he was very flexible with everything. He provided detailed instructions on how to find the house, since it not visible from the street. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and close to public transportation that can take you to Downton Seattle. The amenities are new and modern, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was a little dirty, but clean for the most part. Another issue I had was that the bedroom and bathroom were directly across the main front door, so that could potentially get in the way of privacy. Overall, I would recommend this place. "
4017140,38283523,2015-07-14,4068216,Liz,"We had a fantastic stay! Michael was very accommodating and welcoming. The patio was lovely and the gardens were beautiful! This was the perfect location for all the things we wanted to do in Seattle. The room was great for my partner and me; it was super cozy and comfortable. Fenway is one of the sweetest, best behaved dogs I have ever met in my life. It was easy to come and go as we pleased. The neighborhood was adorable with lots of walkable parks and pretty gardens. All in all, we loved staying here!"
4017140,38649735,2015-07-17,37575841,Amanda,Michael's place was very nice and he was a good host. He was very flexible on our check in time and was nice enough to let us do a load of laundry while we were there. We had lots of space and loved the garden outside our door and how close it was to downtown Seattle. We would definitely suggest it to other travelers!
4017140,41331910,2015-08-07,32011565,Ilyssa,"Michael was more than accommodating even before my boyfriend and I checked into the private room + private bathroom in his townhome. He made sure to let us know he would be gone for the first couple days of our stay, where we could find our keys, and how to make ourselves at home. When he arrived home, we were able to spend several hours with him talking about our lives and interests--it was then that it was solidified how freaking awesome of a person he is. Michael (and his pup Fenway!) are loving, kind people who genuinely love adventure and sharing positivity with their guests. He's also a super talented pianist (thanks for serenading us!) We couldn't ask for a more wonderful host.

On to the room: spacious, private and all you could need and more in terms of amenities. Michael provides towels, shampoo, conditioner, Q-tips, toothpaste, and all the essentials. The room has a huge selection of DVDs, XBox video games, books, and travel guides. The TV is HUGE and already set up with Netflix (which we loved when we were going to sleep at night!) Both the bedroom and bathroom were super clean and tidy. The outdoor garden was where we spent a lot of our time eating our meals and relaxing when we weren't out and about in Seattle. It's a totally secluded paradise out there. We are avid cooks (rarely going out to eat), and Michael was more than willing to let us use the second floor kitchen when we needed and store our groceries in the fridge and freezer. 

The location is perfect for Ubering to anywhere in the city and we loved that we were close (but not TOO close) to everything. When we come back to Seattle, we will absolutely be staying with Michael and Fenway again. Thank you guys! "
4017140,42418230,2015-08-13,37740202,James,"Michael's space was ideal for my needs, relaxing and private.  Michael was a kind and accommodating host.  I would recommend the space to anyone looking for a room near the city."
4017140,43056251,2015-08-17,2249620,Keith,"Michael was very kind and helpful, and made sure that I had everything I needed. Unfortunately, we didn't spend much time together, but all interactions were very pleasant. His place is very nice and clean, and is exactly as pictured and described in the listing. The neighborhood was quiet, while still being located close to so many things. I would definitely recommend staying with Michael. "
4017140,45246700,2015-09-01,32935211,James,Michael was a great host for my stay in Seattle. Everything in the pictures and description was accurate.  You have the whole floor to yourself with private backyard and bathroom. It was super easy to communicate with Michael on the logistics of checking in and out. The neighborhood was very quiet and it was easy to get an uber to get to the downtown area. I would definitely stay again if I return to Seattle. 
4017140,46132114,2015-09-08,30490672,Brady,Michael was great and a very welcoming host. The space was clean. Everything matched his description. Great value for this price listed.
4017140,50783796,2015-10-14,30848971,Joyce,"Michael is a great host, really nice guy and was really welcoming throughout our time there. We got into town pretty late past 10pm but he was there waiting up for us. The place matched the listing, clean and had all the amenities we required, we also felt really comfortable with privacy we got with the entire ground floor to ourselves. Michael was really low key most of the time but also made sure to help us with any queries we had. Michael's kitchen was also an awesome convenience for when we needed to put together a quick breakfast instead of eating out. The 42"" tv with netflix was an added plus for when we just wanted to have a quiet day in. For anyone concerned about being around dogs, Fenway is the most obedient, quiet and sweet natured dog I've ever met, we loved being around him when we had a chance :). The location is really great too, easy to get around by buses or uber, even for us out of towners. The only thing I might add is that the cupboard has been replaced by the 42"" tv thus if you needed to hang your clothing, you will have to use the little closet outside the room. We had no issues with that as the closet space is just outside the room. All in all we had a great time there and really enjoyed Michael's company too, we'll definitely come back if we visit Seattle again!"
4017140,53532034,2015-11-09,47481870,Lillian,"Michael's home was beautiful! Having the whole front floor to ourselves was very nice because it made us feel less intrusive. I honestly loved the fact that there was Hulu and Netflix because one of the nights we were staying there it was raining all day, so we just stayed for half of the day watching movies. Michael was very welcoming and his dog Fenway was the most beautiful German Shepard I have ever met. 
Only downside was that Michael's home was a bit far from downtown Seattle. We mostly resorted to Uber to get around town; however, it wasn't too expensive (about $15 i think). There was public transportation but it was about a mile away and we were being lazy. I definitely recommend booking here!"
4017140,54148608,2015-11-16,47201897,Kathy,"This was my very first Airbnb experience and also my first time in Seattle! After browsing a few other listings, I definitely didn't want to be restricted with entry/exit hours nor share bathrooms. Michael's room is the PERFECT setup if you're looking for privacy! You have the entire first level to yourselves with a private, full bathroom and even a private door leading to the backyard (perfect for smoking). There is a heating system as well as TV. It only took us 10-15 minutes to get downtown- super convenient since we made several trips out there everyday. Abundant street parking in neighborhood. A bit confusing to find at first (it's behind another townhouse on the street) but my boyfriend and I loved being able to come/go as we pleased. We didn't get a chance to chat with Michael too much, as he was busy with work and we were busy exploring the city- but I wouldn't have it any other way! Michael's home was clean, cozy, and convenient! Would absolutely stay here again the next time we visit Seattle!"
934216,6174278,2013-08-02,6844232,Debra,"We had a great stay at the Harbor Steps Apts.  The location couldn't have been better, and we really enjoyed the partial views of the Seattle waterfront and full views of SAM.  Just a few things are needed to make this a 5 Star rental:  reading chairs in each of the bedrooms (perhaps two in the master, there is certainly enough space), 2 twin beds in the second bedroom instead of the queen bed, and balcony furniture (at LEAST 2 chairs and a small table).  The concierges were superb and were so accommodating when we arrived early and they stored our luggage for us before check-in.  "
934216,8149707,2013-10-18,8142540,Andrew,"HarborSteps was a fantastic place to stay. Perfect location, comfortable room, nice amenities. No complaints about that, would stay there again. 

We did however have issues with our host Jordan. He (maybe unintentionally?) pulled a bait and switch on us, raising prices immediately before we booked, then got us to click on a link to book a more expensive unit, then told us we would be staying in a cheaper unit since it was the ""last one left."" I would not have minded except that he charged us for the more expensive unit, then refused to refund the difference in the end. Emailing with him was difficult since he would be defensive and kept saying that we needed to sort it out with airbnb, taking no responsibility for the situation. 

I am not sure exactly what the mixup was but I was struck by Jordan's unwillingness  to help us out.  Airbnb stepped up in the end and refunded us our money. I would be reluctant to book with Jordan again. "
934216,15507936,2014-07-10,383168,Christabelle,"A central location, terrific views of the city and access to a host of facilities such as a workout room and swimming pool. The apartment itself was clean and well-stocked with towels. The concierge was very helpful. So was Jordan; he  got back to us quickly whenever we had a question."
934216,16616916,2014-07-30,16611095,Sheila,great location and very comfortable accommodations! everything described in listing was accurate.  thanks for a great stay
934216,18634399,2014-08-29,10001777,Jake,"Very professional, run much like a hotel. The place was very conveniently located downtown, and the included garage parking spot was great. The apartment itself was nice and clean, with a nice balcony overlooking the water (main picture shown is from the balcony). Overall a great stay."
934216,20080766,2014-09-23,7761019,Ray,"I've visited Seattle many times over the years, and this apartment was the best.  The views of the bay and port are fantastic, day and night.  The location is central to everything, restaurants, shopping, the art museum, and the running and biking trails.  Having a parking space is very convenient.  Hotels now charge a fortune for that.

The apartment itself is comfortable, with a washer/dryer, and kitchen, so it's perfect for longer term stays like ours."
934216,20764257,2014-10-05,18055169,Harper,"Beautiful apartment, great location in Downtown Seattle. Apartment was clean and tidy upon arrival, and the check-in process was easy. Look forward to contacting Jordan next time I'm in the Seattle area. "
934216,22303620,2014-11-03,17049593,Anthony,I did not get to meet Jordan but the place is fantastic. Harbor Steps..its basically a half-hotel but the rooms are full sized condos. Would definitely recommend staying here again..great location..walking distance to almost everything you need. Underground parking which is a huge plus if you're coming from out of town. Very easy and simple instructions for your stay.
934216,28159531,2015-03-19,4028607,Joel,"Check in was incredibly simple. The location of the apartment and its view are fantastic. StayAlfred was accommodating with our late check in and allowing us to checkout late. The condition of the apartment was not on par with its listing. The guest shower make horrendously loud noises while in use. The east exposed bedroom has broken blinds and lets in an abnormal amount of light in the mornings. The king bed is in terrible condition and slants out at each side. The wifi is ""1990s"" slow and practically unusable. Overall the apartment feels like an investment property with which the minimal amount of work has been done to appear livable. A hotel may have been cheaper and far more comfortable. "
934216,30529791,2015-04-23,214522,Nina,"We had an amazing stay. The apartment was clean, comfy easy to check in and out. Location great! I'D definitely recommended."
934216,32697424,2015-05-20,7852292,Ria,This was the perfect apt to enjoy the Seattle waterfront and Pike's market.  The apt itself was super comfortable and really nice.  The view was amazing.  The beds were comfortable and the layout was safe and cozy for our toddler to run around.  Only two issues that would NOT prevent us from renting the same apt:  it took a few tries to get wifi working (but Stay Alfred was very responsive and helpful) and there was noise from the freeway and construction creeping into the apt (but it didn't prevent my 2-year old from getting 10-11 hours of sleep at night or a 2 hour nap in the afternoon).  Parking is a bit tight for the stupid rental car we got but it all worked out.  We would definitely rent this apt and rent from Stay Alfred again!
934216,33399998,2015-05-27,26489535,Sarah,"Our visit with Stay Alfred went seamlessly. Another guest was going to be arriving before me and after calling and leaving his name, he was able to grab the keys and get settled. The apartment is in the best spot. Close to pike place, the Ferris wheel, and great restaurants--even the space needle and Century Link stadium were within longer walkable distances. We walked everywhere and had a great time. Would recommend to a friend."
934216,33534449,2015-05-29,33234214,Hao,This place is really nice. I really like the view of the water from the bedroom window. The host called twice before check-in to make sure no problem. I enjoyed my stay and definitely look forward to my next visit!
934216,34025121,2015-06-03,33897961,Valerie,"Great location, room on par with description and photos (more or less -- furnishings vary).  It was a very nice place and check-in was simple.  It was convenient that the concierge had a place for us to leave our bags before check-in and after check-out.  The TV only had 10 channels, there was only one wineglass, and I noticed that the snacks were empty when we checked in, but those things didn't really affect the quality of the stay."
934216,40775484,2015-08-02,26868464,Eric,"Pros
Great view and location, nice room.

Cons
It was hot and the two A/C units weren't strong enough. This place is great if the weather is cooler but when it's hot, I wouldn't recommend staying here."
934216,41412183,2015-08-07,4890834,Georgia,"This place really does have gorgeous views. The Great Wheel lit up our nights and we watched ferries slide by during the day. We absolutely loved this units proximity to Public Market, restaurants/bars, and transportation. I would highly recommend this unit for families with older children like ours."
934216,43466644,2015-08-19,24681814,Larissa,Good view of Seattle. Best location. Quick cozy.
934216,47268635,2015-09-17,40722798,Joanna,"We had a great time in Seattle and the condo was in a great location. The condo itself was nice, good view if you didn't look to the right at the construction.  Thought it was weird that there was coffee but no coffee filters so had to go out for coffee every morning.  The bed in the second bedroom was a little soft and you rolled towards the middle could be replaced.  Every condo we have rented before came with a few more amenities such as salt, pepper, some spice just things that the previous guest left which is nice so you don't have to buy everything if you want to cook. But otherwise it was nice."
934216,49781030,2015-10-06,33313328,Scott,This place was great!!  Booked it for my Brazilian friends for their first trip to the Pacific Northwest.  The location was great and it fit all 6 of us comfortably.  Being in the middle of the city was great for them to see all of the touristy spots and also close to the football stadium where we saw the Seahawks game.  Really recommend this place
934216,51655875,2015-10-22,43781051,Lan Anh,"This was a first time for us in Seattle. Everything went nice and smooth, check in was easy. The condo was clean, and had an amazing view of the harbor. Great location close to Pike Place Market and shops. Would definitely like to stay here again."
1476298,6410886,2013-08-11,390730,Jim,"We were the first guests in this apartment and even though we stayed just 1 night, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apartment has been tastefully furnished (such nice colors, the wall art) and feels far more spacious than we expected. The rooftop deck has amazing views of downtown and waterfront. The neighborhood is chock full of restaurants, cafes and bars."
1476298,6475209,2013-08-13,7902382,Curtis,"Neha was a great host and a very welcoming person. She made us feel at home and provided great amenities. Only downside is the street below has a few bars with substantial people noise and with the windows open can be a bit annoying late at night. Other than that, it is a simple walk to pikes and public transit is nearby. Tons of cabs driving up and down the streets surrounding so transit is super easy. Overall great apartment, very clean, and great host. Definitely would recommend to others and would stay again. "
1476298,6502805,2013-08-14,5683103,Carolyn,This is a clean and contemporary studio in a fabulous location.  Neha was a helpful host and encouraged us to take advantage of the decktop patio in the building (which was lovely).  She also let us know that garage parking was available for a reasonable charge.
1476298,6650091,2013-08-19,1021991,Heather,"Good studio to stay in near Pike Place. Loved that there is a full kitchen AND washer/dryer. Super-soft sheets. Excellent communication with Neha. She accommodated my late arrival. Near a few night spots, so the area nearby is lively."
1476298,6724885,2013-08-22,3493178,Alix,Neha and the apartment were both excellent. Neha was reliable and able to answer all my questions and even offered to make the place available before the normal 2:00 check in because of our arrival time. The studio was impeccably clean and in a very central location. I would definitely stay here again!
1476298,6769291,2013-08-24,3211094,Arnaud,"Neha's place is very handy and clean, well-equiped. Great neighbourhood, very central, and the flat is located in a brand-new building (many facilities). And Neha is very reactive and helpful (we had so many questions !). Definitely an excellent place to stay in."
1476298,6921876,2013-08-30,7935037,Alysia,"Neha's apartment was perfect for our trip to Seattle. It was very clean (brand new), centrally located, and had good access to many major bus routes. Neha was very responsive to our inquiries and made check-in and check-out straightforward. Make sure you visit the rooftop deck! We strongly recommend this property to anyone visiting Seattle for the first time. "
1476298,7267904,2013-09-13,5839109,Beth,This was a nice place to stay--very clean and very conveniently located.  I would definitely stay here again. I didn't get to meet my host--the keys were handled remotely--but she was very responsive and helpful via email.
1476298,7289219,2013-09-14,8046010,Heidi,"Neha's studio was clean and new.  It's a good value for the money.  I liked the location as it was easy to walk to downtown, Pikes Place Market as well as the Space Needle area.  Neha was very flexible and easy to work with in meeting our requests.  I was glad that we chose this unit."
1476298,7297595,2013-09-14,8779715,John,"This was the first time I ha tried airbnb and now I'm hooked!   Easy, fast, clean, private, great location and the hosts are very organized.  I will stay here when I'm in business in Seattle (if it is available) for sure.  Thanks you guys!!!!!

John"
1476298,7398688,2013-09-18,3023464,Deanna,"This place is in the perfect area as it is just a short walk away from some must-see Seattle attractions (e.g. Pike Place Market, Space Needle, Chihuly Garden and Glass, Shiro's Sushi, and countless Tom Douglas restaurants). The apartment is new, comfortable, and spotless. Neha is very responsive and we really appreciated how accommodating she was to our check-in and check-out times. She truly made everything so easy and we can't wait to visit Seattle again!"
1476298,7583681,2013-09-25,8424858,Edwin,"We loved staying in there studio apartment, it is convenient to everything and the rooftop deck is fantastic. Just wish we had more time to stay longer.
"
1476298,7743418,2013-10-01,3013793,Jackie,"The studio was very modern and the neighborhood super walkable to sites, great restaurants, and bars. Very clean and comfortable with all the amenities you'd need. Neha was responsive to our questions and met up with us to help us get into the building since the main entrance was undergoing construction while we were there.  I would recommend this to a friend and would consider staying again. Thanks Neha!"
1476298,7821412,2013-10-04,2032701,Ivan,"I found this space to be well maintained, well appointed, more spacious than expected, and in easy walking distance of Belltown nightlife. I will use it many more times. Don't wait until the last day to find the roofdeck!"
1476298,7856700,2013-10-06,736793,Michael,"Neha's place is great, I'd definitely stay there again!"
1476298,7952144,2013-10-09,2678441,Alanah,"Neha's place in Belltown is lovely! Very clean, very spacious, very good location! Loved Seattle and our hosts were very helpful. Totally worth checking out! "
1476298,7994673,2013-10-11,9303815,Rachelle,"Definitely recommend!! Neha super helpful. Apartment very clean. My husband and I spent the day walking around town. Close walk to Pike Market and to shopping downtown! Weather was nice, so we were able to enjoy the rooftop view and a glass of wine! Good selection of restaurants and bars nearby! Recommend Bath Gin and Co for a predinner cocktail!! Pictures posted are accurate as well! "
1476298,8151318,2013-10-18,8536729,Andrea Skye,"Neha was a fabulous host. The studio was adorable, and so much better than staying in a hotel in the area! I was attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center and I was a quick and convivent walk away. Also loved having all the delicious dining opportunities of Beltown literally at my doorstep. I would highly recommend both Neha and this studio, and would certainly stay here in the future."
1476298,8203096,2013-10-20,2554496,Matt,The accommodations were great and Neha was an excellent host. The location of her place was perfect for getting to many of the things we wanted to see in our short stay. 
1476298,8230989,2013-10-21,9247539,Michelle,"Thanks so much for a wonderful visit!  The studio was very clean, well appointed, and in an amazing location.  We were able to walk everywhere and Neha was a fantastic host! "
1476298,8261415,2013-10-22,8283867,Paul,"Great host, great clean, cute apartment in a perfect location! Would have liked a little later check out time, especially after a late night or late breakfast.  Neha was very prompt and courteous with any communications."
1476298,8420676,2013-10-29,6707650,Diana,Fabulous location and great clean modern apartment. Would have happily stayed longer. Thank-you.
1476298,8541259,2013-11-04,951135,Natasha,"Very comfortable stay at a convenient location - walking distance to both the Pike Place market and the space needle area and of course great views from the roof deck!

Neha was very accommodating to our needs - we needed to check in early and leave our luggage to pick it up later. She was very flexible which made our stay all the more enjoyable."
1476298,9390539,2013-12-25,10755923,Sean,"Very nice place to stay, for daytime walking you couldn't be in a better spot.  I had trouble initially getting in the building but Neha was very patient and helped me through it.  One thing they failed to include is that around midnight the street corner right outside the apartment becomes a corner to purchase crack....No joke, not kidding one bit, how has no one mentioned this in reviews???  I was asked if I needed crack, did I sell crack, did I have a crack pipe that they could use really quick...this is all in the time it may take to walk around the corner to get inside the building.  Looking down on the street from the window I must have seen minimum 15 deals on the first night.  I must say they were very polite crack dealers, not what I have seen living in NYC for years.  Neighborhood is obviously being ""gentrified"" so I assume sometime soon this will have been a thing of the past, but for now, be back inside before 11:30pm.  "
1476298,9615788,2014-01-03,156995,Courtney,Absolutely perfect location and Neha was incredibly flexible. The place itself was pristine. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat.
1476298,9960109,2014-01-21,8717527,Graeme,"We had a great stay and really enjoyed being able to walk from the apartment to lots of great restaurants and bars.  We also walked to Pike Market from the apartment, which didn't take long at all.  The apartment itself was clean, modern and perfect for our weekend stay. "
1476298,9992134,2014-01-23,7778222,Noora,"The apartment is in a new building and looks as pictured. It was in a good location in terms of proximity and overall  good experience. I will note that whoever is cleaning the place needs to do a better job. I was disturbed at the state of the bathroom, the toilet had not been cleaned and I will not go into detail, but it was not pleasant. I also noticed the kitchen was not wiped down very well (which bothered me much less)- this made me wonder if the sheets or towels were washed. I am happy to pay extra if it means staying in a sanitary place. "
1476298,10069689,2014-01-28,2608039,Kris,"Neha's place was perfect!  The studio apartment is exactly as pictured with lots of thoughtful touches. You can actually consider cooking here as she has provided things like pots, knives, even a full spice rack!  The location is great, walking distance to Pike Place, tourist attractions and downtown shopping. We caught some great music at the famous Crocodile, just one block away. Even though we never actually met, Neha was responsive within minutes when I texted and once we figured out how to get in, all was good. It was too cold to experience the rooftop deck and we didn't need the parking, but we would definitely come back.  It is perfect for a couple! "
1476298,10181081,2014-02-04,10114101,Jeff,Great location and bright sunny new space.  Secure parking is also a plus.
1476298,10225309,2014-02-07,8553839,Amanda,"The place was immaculate, great location. Walking distance to light rail, downtown, and the waterfront. We didn't have a car, but would have appreciated the parking which was provided if we did, as parking downtown is expensive. We would definitely stay there, again. Great first Airbnb experience! Thank you, Neha!"
1476298,10336213,2014-02-14,846701,Danielle,"Neha has a very comfortable and well equiped studio near downtown Seattle. There's a place on garage that's very handy if you are driving.
Lovely building also. You should check the rooftop that has an amazing view of the surroundings."
1476298,10365621,2014-02-16,11138588,Johnny,"Our stay was excellent! It was our first time visiting Seattle and Neha's place was a perfect location. The apartment was clean and fit to our needs. We loved that we were able to cook there too. The apartment was quiet and so close to everything. Neha was also kind enough to let us leave our luggage at the apartment before we checked in, since we arrived early. Overall it was a great experience! Highly satisfied and highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle!  "
1476298,10552945,2014-02-24,6098009,Bobby,"The apt was very nice and clean. The apartment was in a great location and the host was very accommodating. 

If you are driving, inquire with the host about parking. The apartment is downtown and is very difficult to find overnight parking. They have private parking in the building and offered it up (after we asked) for a small fee. Which was awesome. 

We would stay here again. "
1476298,10607531,2014-02-27,4461053,Allen,I found my new home in Seattle.  Perfect location and perfect hosts! 
1476298,10740567,2014-03-05,11279166,Alison,"Truly the perfect stay! The apartment was clean and comfortable and the location was superb. Could not have asked for a better situation, would stay again in heartbeat!"
1476298,10877698,2014-03-11,11404169,Eugene,"I'm super glad I chose your place. Being in the heart of downtown, it was really easy to visit everything.  Also, having a bus stop right outside the door made it very convenient to get around.  

Your place was very clean and accommodating with everything I needed.  I hope to stay with you again in the future!

Best,
Eugene"
1476298,10946802,2014-03-14,12741310,Bryce,"Sid and Neha were super helpful, responsive, and their place was great.  Smack dab in the heart of Belltown sweetness."
1476298,11110359,2014-03-21,11654534,Samuel,Great location. Highly recommended. 
1476298,11215590,2014-03-25,4299472,Allison,"Had a wonderful stay at Sid and Neha's place in Belltown- Seattle. GREAT location and extremely walkable to almost everywhere we wanted to explore.  The neighborhood does get a little rougher at night as with most places in Seattle, but it was nothing we worried about too much and didn't cause any issue other than a little street noise and colorful commentary outside the window in the wee hours. The apartment building is secure and really nice and the studio was clean and comfortable. Washer/Dryer in the room as well as full kitchen and wifi access. Great restaurants, coffee shop and grocery store all within the block. Although I didn't meet them, Sid and Neha were available to answer questions and made everything extremely easy. I would definitely like to stay again when in Seattle and would recommend to anyone looking for a conveniently located, comfortable place to stay. "
1476298,11328829,2014-03-30,6214299,Kelly,Super cute place in a great part of the city. I would definitely stay here again. 
1476298,11362949,2014-03-31,6214299,Kelly,Great place in a new building close to everything! Would definitely stay here again. 
1476298,11469936,2014-04-04,6654557,Corrine,"My boyfriend and I just spent 4 days in this lovely studio. The building was beautiful, secure and the apartment extremely well-kept. The location is amazing and truly walkable. We did do a decent amount of driving, but that's because I wanted to try restaurants all over Seattle, from Pioneer Square to Ballard. I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone looking for a modern, safe and close-to-everything spot. We loved it! "
1476298,11535026,2014-04-07,5110271,Jed,"Sid and Neha's apartment is in a great location for anyone wanting to walk to Seattle's landmarks (just be weary of some of the steep streets in the city). I never felt the need to take public transit or a taxi once during my stay, and Pike Place was a daily stop for me.

Wouldn't hesitate staying again on my next Seattle trip!
"
1476298,11629838,2014-04-09,9481319,Alexandra,"This apartment was perfect for our 2 day stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is ideal and felt safe with lots of cute restaurants just a few blocks away. It's also about a 5-10 min. walk from Pike Market and downtown Seattle, but you can avoid the hustle and bustle. Bed was a little soft, but apartment was extremely clean and having a washer/drier was an added bonus! We will definitely try and stay here again if we return to Seattle. "
1476298,11747070,2014-04-14,3238581,Jessika,"My hubby and I had a wonderful stay at Sid and Neha's. The studio was bright, clean and the bed was super comfy! It was easy to find with clear instructions.
The location in Belltown was perfect and we loved how fun the neighbourhood was. Great local restaurants and bakeries around and walking distance to Pike place and the Chihuly glass exhibit :D

Would highly this location and thank you to Sid and Neha for a lovely long weekend stay!
"
1476298,11893858,2014-04-18,4461053,Allen,The absolutely most perfect Seattle location.  Walk everywhere.  
1476298,11989247,2014-04-21,4777343,Margaret,Sid and Neha's studio was ideally located for an awesome time in Seattle!  It was clean and the instructions were easy to figure out. There were some minor things but overall had a great time!
1476298,12157242,2014-04-24,2333879,Davina,"This is a fantastic place in downtown Seattle! It is walking distance to everything one would need. (Try black bamboo restaurant near the apartment, wonderful!) The place itself was perfect, clean, and had all the utensils for eating in. The apartment also has a spectacular terrace that was wonderful for overlooking the city. Sid was a great host and left instructions for wi-fi and the keys for a seamless transition into the apartment. Well done."
1476298,12279156,2014-04-28,1307268,Stephen,"My fiance and I stayed in Sid and Neha's studio for a small weekend get away. The location was perfect, within walking distance of pretty much everything you would need. The Studio itself was nice, clean, and surprisingly quiet given the location. The rooftop deck was also great, and we were lucky enough to get to enjoy a bit of sun up there.

Would definitely stay here again!"
1476298,12545043,2014-05-05,13120121,明磊,"This is apartment is really really nice and SAFE!!!! Its location is also very good, about 8 mins to Pike Market and 10 mins to downtown shopping center.
The decoration is modern and new. The restroom is spacious and clean. My wife and I really had a wonderful stay in this apartment in Seattle.
Although I didn't have chance to see Sid, but he is very helpful  and answer my question via cell phone. The roof deck is a bonus, from which there is a really nice view."
1476298,12648688,2014-05-06,14362211,Kelly,Sid & Neha's apartment in Bell town was perfectly situated for a Seattle stay. Easy walk to restaurants and downtown. A great stay with gracious hosts. -Kelly
1476298,12971322,2014-05-16,12432474,Amanda,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and I cannot rate it more highly.
Great instructions on access, a beautiful space that was clean and had everything we needed and to top it all the perfect location from which to explore Seattle.  I will certainly be back.  Thanks Sid and Neha for everything.  I would like to add that I was traveling with my Mum who has mobility issues and this was a perfect apartment for anyone with disabilities."
1476298,13210582,2014-05-22,13239395,Wendy,"My husband and I came to Seattle for a couple of days and stayed at this lovely studio. The building itself is very modern and attractive. It is conveniently located - close to shops, restaurants, the ferry system and the market. The location doesn't require a car, and it was a wonderful experience to see the city by foot.

The studio itself is wonderful! It is bright and cheery, lots of natural light, modern vibe with a cozy feel. The decor is delightful. Everything about this experience was convenient and we'd return in a heartbeat and hope to stay here! "
1476298,13268235,2014-05-24,1672185,Tira,"Best location I think we have ever stayed in the US! Never been so close to the action but it wasn't too noisy once inside apartment. New, modern, and equipped with everything you'd need. Only negative was an incredibly squeaky bed every time either of us moved which actually affected our ability to sleep. I suggest potential renters check this has been fixed before booking. Once that has been fixed we would definitely stay again. Thanks!"
1476298,13816670,2014-06-05,4835129,Michaela,"Excellent stay in the perfect location. Easy check-in and out. Great communication. 

Rooftop really nice and relaxing, fun people and dog watching from studio window, very walkable to nearly everywhere downtown and waterfront. Loads of restaurants, cafés, bars and boutiques nearby.

Highly recommend staying and will stay again when back in the Seattle area."
1476298,14146790,2014-06-13,13183513,Erin,"The apartment looked as great as the pictures and it was seriously the most comfortable bed I've slept on it a long time! Great location that will allow you to walk or Uber to just about anywhere you want to go. We loved being able to wash clothes, use the fridge and the security of the building. 

FYI, if you go when it's warm out, you'll be using the windows for AC and there is some traffic noise at night, but it's definitely manageable. 

We would happily stay here again on our next visit to Seattle and send all of our friends here!"
1476298,14202451,2014-06-14,8116291,Tom,Previous reviews are accurate. I enjoyed my stay. 
1476298,14904344,2014-06-29,2214416,Jessica,"This apartment in Belltown was wonderful! My Finace and I stayed here for two nights. It was within walking distance to downtown, the space needle and tons of amazing restaurants and bars. The place was clean and a perfect size for the time we spent in it and make sure you check out the rooftop deck! Checkin and checkout was super easy and Sid responded to any questions I had. "
1476298,15139906,2014-07-03,9562682,Gary,Perfect location and very clean and properly appointed. Would stay again without hesitation.

"
1476298,15520356,2014-07-10,17727430,Z,Couldn't have asked for a better location! Loved out trip to Seattle because of this prime spot.
1476298,15822196,2014-07-16,12277640,Mardi,Great location for restaurants. Was a really hot unit even with the pedestal fan. Extremely clean and easy check in. If we were there for longer we definitely would have taken advantage of the bbq area on the roof.
1476298,15948550,2014-07-19,9633171,Stephen,This building and the apartment is wonderful. The location is fantastic and centrally located to the market as well as restaurants and bars. The experience with the key and access to the building was no problem. Instructions were clear and easy. The only con is that the apt has no AC. If it's hot in Seattle and have to sleep with the windows open then you will hear some street noise below. But otherwise it was a great stay and will definitely stay again. 
1476298,16016877,2014-07-20,16307600,Saagar,Location and apartment were amazing. Walking distance to everything and the rooftop view is great. 
1476298,16670745,2014-07-31,5442840,Patrick,"Excellent stay at this appartement !
Really enjoyed the roof top terrace, the overall modern feeling of the appartment and the close to perfect location in Seattle (we were able to walk to almost everywhere)
One comment : we have been renting the appartment during hot days of July and AC would have been an appreciated bonus  ( fortunately there were a fan in the appartment)

Would definitely stay again there for future visit to Seattle and warmly recommend it for other visitors "
1476298,17524147,2014-08-13,7723967,Megan,"Location, location, location! Dozens of boutique restaurants and bars only steps away. Also within walking distance to the piers if you need to catch a ferry. Check in was very easy and the staff on site even let us stow our bags for the day after we checked out. Very clean and bright with a nice sized bathroom. No air conditioning though this is probably not an issue most of the year. Who needs it when you're likely to be out in the city steps from the door. "
1476298,19543356,2014-09-14,19935723,Beñ,"Pros: The apartment is very clean and in an excellent location. The building has a nice rooftop chill spot and a game room. 

Cons: The bed was uncomfortable, and parking is not included (which is clearly communicated but still a bit of a hassle).

Neutral: This is a good option if you want an efficient, easy stay that feels more like a hotel. "
1476298,19590804,2014-09-15,8523080,Eileen,"What an incredible location. Close to Pike Place Market, the Space Needle and a number of shops and restaurants. Also, the rooftop deck has a terrific view."
1476298,20184182,2014-09-25,14601568,Stephannie,"Everything about Sid and Neha's place was great. The location was perfect...a short walk away from all the most popular attractions (Pike Place Market, Space Needle, etc). There are many bars, restaurants and coffee shops surrounding close by. The place was very cozy, clean and had spectacular views from both the room windows and top-floor deck. I will definitely  stay at Sid & Neha's next time I am in Seattle. This was my first Airbnb experience and I had no problems thanks to our wonderful hosts. "
1476298,20649357,2014-10-03,18493601,Kristina,"Comfortable studio in the heart of it all. Provided easy access to a wonderful dinner at the Space Needle and night on the town at the Pacific Northwest Ballet. Complex was clean, quiet, and well represented by the photographs. Definitely recommend utilizing the parking in the building, as surface lots in the area are pretty busy. Overall a great experience"
1476298,20810691,2014-10-06,13047331,John,"Outstanding! Could not have beaten the location..we walked everywhere - pioneer square, Seattle ferry station, space needle, pike place etc..no requirement for public transport at all. Walk score should be 100!

Apartment itself was clean and perfect size for two people. Surprisingly quiet from outside noise of main drag which was good for sleeping.

Would definitely stay there again next time. Thanks! "
1476298,21197035,2014-10-13,17884906,Kristen,"This was our first trip to Seattle and we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! Short all from all the major sites, lots to do right around the building! We were pretty much only at the apartment to sleep, and the beds were so comfortable we woke up well rested every day! Apartment very clean. Awesome views from rooftop! Great place!"
1476298,21698629,2014-10-22,10366345,Lindsay,Sid and Neha's place was great for our first time in Seattle.  It was close to many major attractions and many places were easily walkable.  The apartment itself was clean and comfortable.  The bed was very comfortable but also very squeaky.  Sid was very easy to get a hold of and easy to communicate with.  Everything on our trip went very smoothly.  
1476298,21940121,2014-10-27,5474242,Jessica,"The apt was in the perfect location for first timers like us. You are a short walk from the space needle, Pike Place Market and a slew of restaurants and bars. Sid was very friendly, but make sure you get in contact with him before you get to the bldg because only he can buzz you in. Other than that I have no complaints."
1476298,22446942,2014-11-06,23219874,Binti,Neha & Sid's place is wonderful! We were so close to everything in the downtown area. It was so easy to walk around everywhere and the place was so cozy! 
1476298,22771936,2014-11-14,754467,Casey,"Sid and Neha's apartment was awesome. It's located right next to all the best places to eat and drink and easily within walking distance to pike place market and downtown. I enjoyed my time in seattle a lot, largely because the apartment was so nice and clean and convenient. It's exactly like the pictures and I would love to stay there again."
1476298,23043814,2014-11-21,4079649,Nicholas,Great place in the heart of Seattle by great dining and night life. Recommended. 
1476298,23233310,2014-11-25,4024655,Anna,"Great place, everything went perfectly.  Very accommodating hosts and beautiful area. "
1476298,23352597,2014-11-29,10812149,Colin,"Great experience. Key pickup was easy and apartment was in a prime location. Walk-score very well deserved. The studio was clean and the kitchen had plentiful cookware and counter space. Comfortable bed and cool view from the balcony and windows. 

Definitely recommend Sid's place!"
1476298,23542379,2014-12-03,23633061,Anna,"The place is really great and the hosts are as well. 
Great natural light, clean, convenient and safe. 
Highly recommended! "
1476298,23590475,2014-12-05,23633061,Anna,"Sid was super responsive and wonderful to work with.
The location was great and I would stay here again and be hosted by Sid and Neha. 
Close to lots of live music venues and good restaurants, close to the water and convenient. 
The facility and apartment were clean and updated. 
"
1476298,23650459,2014-12-07,12879346,Hilary,"As we got nearer to check in, Sid was helpful to welcome me & text me the directions/instructions because my phone was almost dead & unable to access internet. "
1476298,23843529,2014-12-12,1675493,April,"Everything about the listing was accurate. Neat, clean, great view and very easy access to the building. This condo is located in walking distance to everything that makes Seattle fabulous. "
1476298,23917141,2014-12-14,9941843,Leah,"Great centrally located apartment in a vibrant part of Seattle. Excellent location, only a short walk to an abundance of good quality restaurants, bars and attractions. The apartment was neat and tidy with good quality internet. Sid was helpful and responsive. 

Downside: For people traveling by car ensure Sid secures the parking on site for you or you locate a cheap parking lot yourself. Parking was approximately $50 per day. 
"
1476298,23984527,2014-12-15,24748858,Matt,"Wonderful apartment in a vibrant part of the city. Sid and Neha made the whole process extremely easy and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a clean, well managed place to stay! "
1476298,24252642,2014-12-23,3416402,Ana Paula,great location.
1476298,24394376,2014-12-27,24807821,Rui,"Best part is the location. It is close to everything - walking distance to Pike Place Market, downtown shopping, restaurants and you can see space needle right downstairs.  The studio is very neat and cozy like you see in the picture.  A Roku is provided to connect to Netflix or other TV streaming accounts. There's also a party room and gym in the building with free access. Our host Sid is very friendly and helpful. He provided very clear instruction for check-in before the arrival. Contact him early if you want to secure a parking spot in the building."
1476298,24574305,2014-12-30,7149552,Christian,"Sid's home is centrally located in a favorite neighborhood of mine, Belltown. Great area full of some of the best restaurants in Seattle and close to most of the main sites in the city. Check out Umi sushi down the street and check out a fun speakeasy called Bathtub Gin & Co. "
1476298,24632001,2014-12-31,1153631,Scott,We had a great stay at this place! Location is excellent and the host was very easy to communicate with. 
1476298,24675453,2015-01-01,24842670,Connie,This is my first airbnb reservation and it was simple and sweet.
1476298,24869861,2015-01-03,5750216,Chris,"I stayed at Sid's listing with my girlfriend on a weekend visit to Seattle and it was everything we could have hoped for.  The location was fantastic, with easy access to major tourist attractions such as Pike Place Market and the Space Needle.  The apartment itself was very clean and modern.  Sid was a great host, he was very responsive before check-in and gave us detailed instructions throughout the process.  The only thing I would say is that since this listing is in such a popular location it can get a little loud at night.  Other than that no complaints here, it was the perfect weekend!"
1476298,25071584,2015-01-05,14454393,Jo,The place had a great location and was very convenient. Easy to access and tidy. 
1476298,25290216,2015-01-11,20918339,Jessica,"Hi there. We had a wonderful time staying here while we were visiting Seattle. Sid was very helpful when we got a little lost looking for it and answered any questions I needed. He even let us check in a little early! Thanks Sid!! Our favorite part about the place was the kitchen. We were able to grab some fresh local seafood from Pikes Place and cook it at the studio, yum!! "
1476298,25474371,2015-01-17,25363401,Kara,"This was our first time booking with airbnb. Our experience was easy, simple and impressive. He let us check in early, the studio was perfect for 2 people and the location was so convenient. Definitely a beautiful city and experience we were able to have because of Sid! "
1476298,25558218,2015-01-19,7895153,Rosie,"Great place right in heart of Belltown. Walking distance from all the tourist destinations, making it very easy to get around. Check-in was extremely easy, and the studio was quite comfortable."
1476298,25674880,2015-01-22,26319742,Xin,"Very good rooftop, clean and modern, highly recommend and would visit again!"
1476298,25801442,2015-01-26,14905421,Chris,Sid was great - very helpful and accommodating. Apartment was very clean and as advertised. Great location.
1476298,25895139,2015-01-28,2380343,Katie,"The location was so accessible to downtown with many nearby bars restaurants and coffee, and the apartment itself was well appointed-- so much cozier than staying in a hotel! Host Sid was incredibly responsive. "
1476298,26078682,2015-02-02,10110840,Michael,"The flat was great - very clean and easy to get to. Sid is great and was really easy to contact. The place is in an amazing location and feels fun and safe. The rooftop is great and the amenities were really nice too. 

They have parking under the building if needed too!"
1476298,26270771,2015-02-08,26327094,Veronica,"This room was amazing! It had a beautiful view and was in the middle of Belltown. The complex had a gym, pool table, foosball, and an AMAZING rooftop view. The place was very clean and modern, and a cute balcony with a nice view. There was a washer and dryer which was very helpful. The building was very safe, and there was garage parking if needed for a fee. If I had known how amazing this place was I would have stayed another night. I will definitely be back here for my next trip to Seattle! "
1476298,26531659,2015-02-15,25896031,Solange,"Location location location! My boyfriend and I stayed at this location for a long weekend. We had an amazing trip visiting Seattle and our little apartment was the cherry on top. Everything felt high end, the building, the apartment, the area! 

The apartment was very clean, modern and relaxing all at the same time. Sid walked us through all the steps via email on how to check in and check out, very simple. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! :)  

Perfect for a tourist. Near all the cool stuff!!! Museums, space needle, bars, restaurants. "
1476298,26723506,2015-02-17,11997873,Yun Xu An,很好。
1476298,26877368,2015-02-21,17104852,Michael,"Nice spot once I got the correct info, (wrong key box and wrong room number) but Sid got us back on track and we enjoyed our stay."
1476298,26969642,2015-02-22,27221302,Chris,Sid's apartment was great! It was very clean and easy to navigate. I would say the best part of Sid's place was definitely the location. You are dead in the center of Belltown which has a ton of restaurants within a couple blocks so that was awesome. The only thing I would have done differently is dropped my GF and our luggage off at the apartment and then went and found parking instead of finding parking and then carrying the bags over because we did have to park about 10mins walking away which is no fault of Sid it is just a busy city so parking isn't very easy to come by. 
1476298,27083063,2015-02-24,26555960,John,Very clean and was straightforward to get into the place even when my flight was 2 hours delayed in getting to Seattle. 
1476298,27119340,2015-02-25,7269509,Cath,"Great studio with wonderful kitchen and full entertainment system. Enjoyed my stay so much. The rooftop must be awesome in summer, check it out! Sid was a great host. "
1476298,27181274,2015-02-27,4987104,Marissa,Perfect location!! This Seattle studio was only minutes from the major city attractions. The neighborhood was awesome - on the same block as bars/restaurants. Super cool. Sid gave detailed instructions and was very accommodating! Would recommend this place to a friend.
1476298,27440130,2015-03-04,11997873,Yun Xu An,公寓的地点非常好，到mecy和派克市场走路不到10分钟，很方便，晚上也很安静。
1476298,27765589,2015-03-11,15379448,Xin,Really nice studio. Great location in downtown. It takes less than 10 mins to go to pike market by foot. You only need spend 4 dollar to go the place like Space Needle by using Uber. 
1476298,27838471,2015-03-13,5804555,Kathy,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle.  Walking distance to the fabulous Pike Place Market and many other fun spots.  Sid was nice enough to let us in early since our plane landed before normal check-in.  Just as a warning (not a criticism ) beware that parking is a bit of a mess in downtown Seattle.  I would recommend reserving Sid's parking spot if you bring a car. We wished we had.  This place is clean, has everything you need, and Sid is quick to respond if you have a question."
1476298,28205311,2015-03-20,6389874,Parker,"This was a great place.  Check in was seamless, and the apartment was clean and comfortable.  Located in a very cool neighborhood with good food and drink within a 5 minute walk.  Sid was very responsive to any issues or questions that arose during our stay.

I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future!   Great place, and great host!"
1476298,28600616,2015-03-27,25478168,Elliott,"The neighborhood was really nice and we were within walking distance of many great restaurants and attractions so the location was excellent! Also, the roof top had a superb view of the water and of the surrounding buildings. Being able to walk to the Seattle Center, Pike's Place, and the water made this location perfect."
1476298,29159837,2015-04-05,17823646,Kristen,"Gorgeous place with all the amenities, and the rooftop deck and grills were spectacular!  Really enjoyed our stay. Sid was helpful and efficient, and an ideal host.  "
1476298,29660638,2015-04-11,5419530,Shawn,"This is an awesome place to stay in Belltown!  Walking distance to a lot of great bars, food, Pike Place!  I'd definitely stay here again.  Sid was very communicative and made sure I had everything I needed before arrival.  Thanks Sid!"
1476298,30060972,2015-04-16,29816474,Mehmet,Great apt. Enjoyed the amazing rooftop
1476298,30439425,2015-04-22,25494624,Geoff,"Sid was accommodating and cordial.  The neighborhood was fantastic.  Vibrant night life, great restaurants, eminently walkable and close to wherever you need to be."
1476298,30684064,2015-04-26,27892528,Erik,"Great apartment. Easy check in. Location is perfect and close to many restaurants, bars, space needle, and pike place market. Would highly recommend for anyone traveling to Seattle. This place deserves its 98 walk score."
1476298,31609729,2015-05-07,12580967,Michael,"Great Studio! Check in process was well laid out and explained excellently. I arrived in Seattle in the morning was allowed to check in 4hrs early! The place was very clean and well kept. The location could not have been any more ideal, it was centrally located to all the recommend locations and within steps of restaurants.  "
1476298,31687807,2015-05-08,27020458,Will,Great little place in a great location! Easy to get in easy to check out - perfect spot in downtown/belltown.
1476298,31781766,2015-05-10,27206095,Jason,"Great location, convenient to the tourist areas around Bell st. Linens and laundry available in room. Fully stocked kitchen for making a meal from Pikes Market. 

Only advice is, if opting for the parking space, a compact car would be best fit. "
1476298,32136083,2015-05-14,31736175,Kellie,"What a wonderful place to stay in the heart of downtown Seattle! The check-in/out process couldn't have been easier or quicker! The apartment was quiet, clean and the building was safe and secure. Finally, the mattress had a memory foam top that was heavenly and made it difficult to get out of in the morning!! Sid does a great job of welcoming you to the unit, building and area from a distance which allows you to come and go as you please. Cannot wait to stay there again! "
1476298,32363341,2015-05-17,823835,Brittany,"Sid was great, who gave us clear instructions on how to check in. The neighborhood was great - close to Pike Place and fun restaurants. The studio itself was clean and bright; appreciated the little amenities as well."
1476298,33661829,2015-05-31,15790004,Jason,"We enjoyed the apartment and location very much. Check in was easy, and Sid was super accommodating of our late arrival - our flight was delayed about 4 hours. The apartment was perfect for our 4 day conference in Seattle and was in walking distance to a bunch of great restaurants, Pike's place, and the train to the airport. We'd definitely stay here again if/when we come back to Seattle! "
1476298,33862284,2015-06-01,34036883,Susan,"My husband and I stayed one night at Sid's apartment and we were very happy with our experience.  His check-in directions were accurate and easy.  We loved having a parking space in the garage, too.  The location was great and within easy walking distance to shops and restaurants.The apartment was spacious, clean and bright.  I happily recommend his apartment as a great place to stay while in Seattle."
1476298,34758937,2015-06-11,1331255,Connie,"Sid was an extremely communicative and helpful host. My flight was arriving earlier than the check in time and he was more than welcoming in allowing me to drop off my bags early while the unit was being cleaned. The studio was exactly as pictured and in the heart of downtown. I loved being able to walk to all the major sights like the Needle and Pikes Place, both which were about a 5 min walk away. I will definitely be using Sid's studio again the next time I am in town! "
1476298,34849652,2015-06-13,8204085,Sean,"Sid's apartment is exactly as described. The space is perfect size for 2 people, the rooftop deck is amazing, the building is high-class, and the location couldn't be better! We'll be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle. "
1476298,35198022,2015-06-16,26026655,Caroline,"Sid was very thorough and friendly in his welcome and instructions on how to access the space. The studio was very clean and fresh feeling. The location was perfect - just a few minutes walk to Pike Place and also to the Space Needle, etc. We had a great time in Seattle on our the last leg of our honeymoon, and the studio was a perfect home base!"
1476298,35776405,2015-06-22,406773,Tiffanie,"The apartment was larger than a regular hotel room and very comfortable. A number of tourist things were within walking distance (the Needle and Pike's Place) as well as shopping. Given the location, I was surprised at how quiet the area was - though if you aren't used to city noise I'm sure you would find it loud. Overall, we enjoyed our stay!"
1476298,36042239,2015-06-24,18136312,Madison,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Sid's place for a few days during our trip to Seattle. He gave us easy instructions on how to let ourselves in which was ideal. The apartment itself was very clean and in perfect walking location for our needs.

Everything we could have needed was already planned for. Thanks Sid! Looking forward to being in Seattle again soon!"
1476298,36375650,2015-06-28,25328109,Hayley,"This was one of the best travel experiences I have ever had. Sid was great. He even accommodated us by allowing us to leave bags in the condo before check-in and after check-out so that we could enjoy the city without dragging bags around. He was so helpful and kind even when we got a little confused about where to put our stuff. We absolutely loved evenings on the rooftop deck. It really is a great place to stay. If I ever return to Seattle, Sod will be the first one I get in contact with about a place to stay. "
1476298,36684934,2015-06-30,20451121,Phuong,"Sid was a very gracious host.  My cousin and I were returning from an Alaskan cruise and decided to stay in Seattle for a few days.  I asked Sid if I could check in early since the cruise docked early in the morning.  He was very responsive and accommodating by allowing me and my cousin to drop off our luggage in the apartment while it was being cleaned.  This was a huge burden off our backs!
The location of the apartment was very convenient and walkable to the major sightseeing attractions in Seattle and there were plenty of places to eat around the area.  I opted not to rent a car and public transportation was also readily available nearby.  We took the light rail to the airport from the Westlake Center station, which was about a 10 mins walk away."
1476298,36778582,2015-07-01,30609207,Evan,The place was very clean. Cute and the location was great. Only a little annoying having to figure out the parking situation. Sid was helpful in getting us situated but it was definitely a scavenger hunt getting in and situated. Other than that I would recommend it to others. 
1476298,37138744,2015-07-05,6173147,Liz,"This is not your typical AirBnB place; it's essentially a new and modern multi-storey apartment. The building and the unit (411) itself was really clean and spacious. The unit came furnished and there were kitchen utensils available should anyone be inclined to cook. 

The location is very central! We pretty much walked everywhere!

Couple of cons: the room faced Bell St and it can get noisy (re: people on street, sirens at night). It was unusually warm during our visit (4th of July weekend) and only a fan was in the room so we had the windows and balcony door open which probably added to the noise factor. There were also some unsavory looking characters on the street; they seem harmless although some of them did ask for money. 

Communication with Sid was a breeze. He was very responsive via email and text (except for some lag on the night that we arrived but no biggie). "
1476298,37946590,2015-07-12,4458250,Beth & AJ,"We had a great time in Seattle!  The best part of the place was being able to walk to everything, the only time we took a cab was to get to Safeco Field, which was an $8 ride.  The apartment itself was average, and without air conditioning, we had to leave the windows open.  There is a large homeless population in this area that hangs out in front of the apartment complex.  At all hours from the apartment you could hear everyone from down below.  We realize that when we went, Seattle was having an unusually hot summer.  The rooftop was nice and relaxing, and we used the gym a few times.  "
1476298,38253691,2015-07-14,10530406,Paul,"Sid is very responsive and accommodating; the check-in & out process could not have been any easier. The studio apartment is well-kept with updated appliances. There is also a rooftop area with great views of the city, grills, and plenty of seating.

The location was ideal and within walking distance to all major attractions (eg cruise terminal, space needle, pike market place, and most transportation hubs) as well as many restaurants and bars. We will definitely consider staying here in the future."
1476298,38488014,2015-07-16,31453917,Kevin,This is a nice space that very accesible to all the good spots in Seattle by walk. It is also right by Pikes Place where they have tons of good food. The apartment has a 24/7 gym and a nice lobby area with a pool table and big screen TV. The room was a nice studio and was very clean and had a nice layout. Sid was a very accomodating host!
1476298,39276872,2015-07-22,32541246,Kyle,Loved the apartment and the location. The neighborhood is fantastic. Easy check in and check out. Everything was perfect! 
1476298,39733056,2015-07-26,29054024,Lynn,"Both Sid and his apartment were great!  He was always quick to reply to any question I had, and very helpful throughout our early check-in.
The condo was spotless, and had everything we needed.  Best part was the rooftop terrace!
Location was also excellent.  We walked everywhere.....The market, space needle, Safeco, and more.  Great eating spots right outside the door, we especially loved the new bistro attached to the condo.
Thank you Sid!"
1476298,40327491,2015-07-30,33508128,Brady And Marilena,This was my first Airbnb expiriance and I have to say it was great. Sid left very detailed instructions and was always available for any questions. The place is really nice. Easy walking distance to anyplace downtown and near many great happy hour spots. I would stay here again in a heartbeat.
1476298,41388341,2015-08-07,2783867,Kenny,"The location is very nice - walking distance to all of downtown, but in the hipper neighborhood of Belltown just to the northwest. Sid made it very easy to get the key and come in. Since I was taking the train, I had to drop off my stuff a few hours before the apartment was ready, but the cleaner was able to let me in to drop off my bags."
1476298,41724251,2015-08-09,28357642,Eric,"Sid was very professional and responded immediately to some questions I had during our stay. I appreciate that he provided clear details in the process of checking-in and checking-out. The unit itself is not enormous, but it's all about location - it puts you in the heart of the action in terms of restaurants, bars, and shopping. I'd stay in this unit again, but perhaps I'll wait until the weather gets cooler - it was a little warm and uncomfortable due to the heat that particular weekend in Seattle. Overall, I had a pleasant stay and recommend to others."
1476298,42516481,2015-08-14,32063605,Kyle,"Check in was extremely convenient.  We often wondered whether Sid was real or just a computer, because everything operated so seamlessly.  Indeed, we never met Sid, but sometimes I think that is nice.  The place was a bit smaller than we had anticipated, but it was clean and very modern.  If I'm honest, the area was a bit rough at night.  It's clear that it is up and coming (i.e., hipster chic is on its way!), but we were awoken by people (and later dogs) fighting outsider of our window at about 3 am.  It was so nice to have a washer and dryer though, as I was on the 8th day of my travels!  Also, the roof terrance has excellent views where we were able to enjoy a bit of wine with a cool breeze."
1476298,43630360,2015-08-21,21617438,Dominic,My girlfriend and I loved staying in Belltown at Sid's apartment. The building was beautiful and modern. The rooftop patio was perfect for an evening nightcap. The neighborhood is perfect for young professionals and college students. Killer restaurant scene footsteps away as well as a great bike/running path along the water. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend Sid's place to anyone. Thanks again Sid. 
1476298,44094719,2015-08-24,28282607,Kali,"Our stay at Sid's place was exactly as he'd described. Check in was super easy, perfect instructions and he even arranged for us to check in a little early since the room was clean and ready. Place is completely as described. The neighborhood is in perfect walking distance to Pike's Place and many of the other attractions around. We enjoy walking, and didn't have to take a cab for our entire trip. There are a ton of restaurants and bars super close which is great. The neighborhood is noisy at night especially if you need to leave the windows open, but we were prepared for it and it wasn't a problem at all. We loved our stay in Seattle and would definitely stay at Sid's place again."
1476298,44516867,2015-08-27,29903241,Joelle,"Sid was a wonderful host! Since we arrived a few hours before check in with our suitcases, I texted Sid and he quickly responded  with info. on storing our bags in the unit so we could enjoy exploring Seattle by foot. What a fantastic location, walkable to many major sites. We started our mornings enjoying delicious coffees from Bedlam coffee shop (one block away) on the condo. rooftop patio--what a gorgeous view! Make sure to enjoy the sunsets up there as well.
The neighborhood felt safe and offered many restaurant selections. The condo was lovely, clean and the bed was very comfy.When the windows are opened, it does get a bit noisy. There is a fan in the unit, which blocks some noise and we were able to get some good rest. We will definitely stay at Sid's unit again when visiting beautiful Seattle."
1476298,45548156,2015-09-04,24526481,Ian,"My wife and I just spent 2 nights at Sid's studio and it was perfect!  The space is big for a downtown studio and was super clean.  If you are looking to explore the city on foot, this is the place. 5 minute walk to Pike Place market, 10 min walk to the space needle, and a ton of restaurants and bars really close. Communication with Sid was excellent, if we visit Seattle again, we will definitely stay here."
1476298,45922686,2015-09-07,4168866,Sylvie,We really enjoyed our stay here. Our flight didn't get in until late evening yet check-in was still super easy. The studio and building were clean and modern and it's in a great part of the city. We highly recommend a stay here.
1476298,46369571,2015-09-10,26653015,Jenna,"We really enjoyed staying in this apartment! The bed was ridiculously comfortable; I wish I could have taken it with me! We were able to walk to literally everything we did in Seattle (Space Needle, Chihuly, EMP museum, boat tour, aquarium) and the restaurants around the apartment were great. We highly recommend this place for your stay in Seattle!"
1476298,46472682,2015-09-11,35239787,Helen,"Convenient location, clean apartment in a cool but safe building and with great amenities, and friendly host who's willing to help. Thank you, Sid, for letting stay in your apartment while we were at Seattle."

1476298,48155682,2015-09-23,13934765,Michael,"The property was just as advertised and the check in and check out was very smooth. I called Sid when i arrive, and he called  me back in about 30 seconds - very responsive.  I will stay here again as the unit was well located, clean and fully stocked with everything i needed from comfy bath towels to soap and a razor for shaving.  Thanks Sid, your a great host. "
1476298,48292572,2015-09-25,17981778,Toby,"This place was in a fantastic location--7 minutes to Pikes Place and 10 to the space needle-----Sid was a good guy---he let us drop off our bags early and overall was really helpful.  I would recommend this place----the apt was nice and the facility was also nice with an outdoor balcony and pool table and ping pong downstairs

The only somewhat negative is that the apt itself is very small---much smaller than the pictures look like and there is no AC so it was kinda hot at night---other than that--stay here!
Toby"
1476298,48869640,2015-09-29,25815263,Molly,Sid was welcoming and helpful. Great place. Good location and the roof top was awesome.

1476298,49609070,2015-10-05,25759928,Darlene,"We had an amazing stay at The Studio apartment! The location can’t be beat! We were in walking distance to many great restaurants, bars and coffee shops – many within two blocks! The studio is located in a centralized location in Downtown Seattle. We walked to Pike’s Place, the Space Needle, and down to the waterfront. 

The studio is clean, bright and well stocked. It was very comfortable and we enjoyed the layout. We opened the balcony door to let in the cool breeze and lovely fall air. The check-in procedure was very easy; we arrived late on a Thursday night, but had no trouble getting in. Also, the building’s rooftop patio should not be missed! We lounged up there a few times; we watched a beautiful sunset and even had morning coffees there. 

I will absolutely recommend a stay at Sid’s studio. I’m already thinking about another visit soon. It was a wonderful experience and was the perfect location for our Seattle vacation. Thanks again!
"

Sid was a great communicator, always responded quickly to our questions and he even let us drop off our luggage early/check-out late.

The studio was just as described – gorgeous, modern and clean. We were able to enjoy the stunning views from the rooftop patio early in the morning and during sunset.

It is also so close to many good restaurants (specifically Lola, Biscuit Bitch, Tavolàta and Serious Pie) and all were within walking distance.

We are definitely planning a return visit!"
1476298,50803494,2015-10-14,5242499,Blake,"Place was awesome, great location for anything going on in downtown Seattle,  plus parking for only $15 made things extra convenient. 10/10 would stay again."

The apartment was lovely very clean and everything we needed it was in a great area of town, close to everything we needed, with no car we were able to walk to everything. Not a huge apartment but great for the 2 of us. Thanks Sid for your hospitality. "
1476298,52180735,2015-10-26,5124835,Tazo,"Great trip and made easier by staying in Sid's place. Clean, easy access, SUPER convenient to Belltown restaurants and the Pike Place Market. Directions were perfect evendors thought we got in late at night. A little street noise at night, surprising because the windows are double insulated, but not enough to keep you up. Very happy to have found it."
1476298,53038462,2015-11-03,46185796,Avon,"A great little place, very clean, tidy and convenient.

1476298,53935646,2015-11-14,48247788,Mai,"Sid's place was very clean and spacious for two people.  It is modern and convenient just as described.  It only took us about 5-10 minutes walk to get to Pike Place Market and all the shopping area downtown.  My boyfriend and I loved the neighborhood, so much so that we decided if we ever move to Seattle we would live in Belltown.  We were able to check in early which was awesome!  If we ever visit Seattle again we will definitely stay here.  Thank you Sid for making my birthday trip the best one yet!"
1476298,56273462,2015-12-11,50385399,Bob,There were some changes due to travel delays (weather!) and Sid was great working with to make sure we were able to stay.  We had a great time and really appreciated the location and how close it was to a lot of the places we wanted to visit.  The apartment was clean and well stocked with anything that we needed.  Great stay and even better communication.
1476298,56711383,2015-12-16,40384279,Eric,"The apartment is beautiful, clean, well furnished, and in an amazing location. I booked this place last minute because of a canceled flight and Sid was incredibly accommodating.  I will definitely be staying at his properties in the future.  "
1476298,57094230,2015-12-21,51472967,Jeremy,"The place was awesome, very clean and close to everything. Communication with Sid was very easy and he made it a pleasure. Couldn't have been happier with our experience."

7500191,40051405,2015-07-27,22539797,Christopher,Room was nice. Very well kept. Landlord was one of the nicest Ive dealt with since using AirBnB a year ago. Only complaint was the freezer was busted so no ice but Im sure he will have that fixed soon. 
7500191,40846826,2015-08-02,18080749,Adam,"Michaels place is in a great neighborhood (Capitol Hill) with tons of great coffee shops, smoothie spots, a 24 hr full scale grocery store, Etc Which is like a 3 min walk away, and a $6 uber gets you to downtown. Ambitious walkers could get there as well. 

Capitol Hill also has a fun pocket of upscale boutique clothing stores like Totokaelo & bars & clubs & food spots which is like .7 miles from this unit. 
Kitchen has a nice coffee maker, fridge, microwave/ anything you'd need. The bed is very comfortable & a smart TV is mounted on wall near the bed to stream Netflix Hulu etc. 
Michael is very prompt replying to texts & is very eager to help any issues that may come up. "
7500191,42025399,2015-08-10,30356882,Jeremy,"Michael was an amazing and friendly host to say the least. The space was even bigger than we originally imagined so from the time we walked in my group was blown away. On the first day when we asked about suggestions for food places around we were given a list of great amazing places to eat within walking distance. (Only was able to try about 1/2 them)

Public transport was within 2 blocks so that was nice and close. If one wanted to get anywhere there was a way. We decided to walk to downtown a few days, its not bad (If you exploring and walking)

24 Grocery store nearby (2 Blocks) if one wanted to cook there as well (Pots and pans were even in the room when we arrived!)

If any hiccup or dilemma popped up he would rectify it as fast as humanly possible. Next year if my event is in Seattle we would definitely stay there again."
7500191,44077727,2015-08-23,13754687,Matt,Great location and spot was exactly as described. A few blocks walk from some of the coolest restaurants and cafes in Seattle. Comfortable and very fast internet. A little noise from the building but nothing too bad. I slept like a baby.
7500191,44811146,2015-08-29,8612598,Kelly,"This was the perfect spot for me while I went apartment hunting during the week. Michael made sure everything was ready for me by the time I arrived and met me shortly afterward to ensure I had everything I needed. The apartment was fully equipped with everything I could possibly need (AC, toiletries, towels, TV, wifi) and was so comfortable and clean (the bed is the most comfortable bed I've ever slept on!). Great location, too - only a short walk to either Broadway or 15th and the neighborhood is quiet and serene. Would highly recommend!"
7500191,45984496,2015-09-07,40328979,Barbara,"Great apartment in a wonderful neighborhood.  Convenient to shopping, food, and downtown.  The apartment was well stocked with necessities and conveniences.  Michael was an excellent host, responsive to our needs.  Overall we had a wonderful stay!  I would definitely recommend this apartment."
7500191,49045723,2015-09-30,5452025,Andrew,"Michael was an awesome host. He greeted us promptly when we arrived, gave us with the keys to the apartment, and provided us with several recommendations around the neighborhood. He showed us where everything in the apartment was located and even checked in on us midway through our stay to make sure we have everything we needed. The apartment was extremely well kept and in a perfect location- plenty of coffee shops, stores, restaurants, etc. nearby. I'd definitely recommend this apartment to anyone I know- I highly enjoyed my stay. "
7500191,53467713,2015-11-09,9403098,Nancy,"Stayed a month at this lovely spot. Michael was really great about letting us rent for that long and very kind during a very emotional 
period for us. The studio is clean, charming, tastefully decorated and very comfortable. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay including quarters for the washing machine. It's in a very nice neighborhood in Capitol Hill, close to everything and I felt very safe walking everywhere. We needed to be close to family in Capitol Hill and Swedish Hospital and the studio was in a great location for access to both. We will definitely stay here again, a wonderful home away from home."
7500191,57275506,2015-12-23,51831048,Ron,"Simply put, it was devine! This year we had a company party downtown so I decided to stay on Capital Hill. While there were several options in the surrounding area, Michaels location was perfect. The space was located just a minute walk from the main shops, but you felt as though you had privacy if desired. A multitude of boutiques and cafes fulfilled any want or wish. The BNB's main level location with private access was perched above the city street. Michael's space was decorated and appointed with unique, comfortable furniture. Everything you could desire is there; Full bath, kitchen, dining nook and a walk-in closet allowing a guest to fully unpack and relax. Since the party was not until 8:00 PM I had some time to kill. While exploring the Hill was tempting, I felt most at ease and relaxed taking 2-3 hours in the space with a glass of wine. A nap?, yes that happened. I will definitely be booking again with Michael!"
5525073,39521893,2015-07-24,597045,Jason,"Great place! Large apartment and really nice value. Very quiet block with plenty of parking, and you'll have a visitor permit which is a lifesaver! Nice tv area and fireplace. Super comfortable bed too! "
5525073,42578433,2015-08-14,39383295,Duncan,"We loved staying at Andrew's house. It was a very clean and large space with enough room for 3. His house is beautifully designed and a joy to be in. The location was perfect for us, we walked to dinner every night and the bus lines were very close. Parking was tight, but we were always able to find a spot. We really enjoyed it and would stay there again."
5525073,50020728,2015-10-08,1979165,Benjamin,"The place was gorgeous.  Clean, ample amenities, a washer/dryer and (very toasty) gas fireplace in the unit, and the fantastic restaurants, bars, and waterfront of Fremont were all about a four-to-eight minute walk away.

I spent part of my four-day stay working at Google's office in Fremont, and the AirBNB had great internet, a nice desk, and plenty of coffee-and-tea tools at the ready.  It was a great place to start the day and an even better one to escape to at the end of the day.

It sometimes took a little searching to find parking on the street (though the parking pass definitely took a load off the mind), and there wasn't a ton of natural light, not that there ever is in Seattle.  But it was cozy, pristine, wonderfully stocked and perfectly situated, and Andrew was communicative, quick to respond to requests, and has the logistics of the AirBNB down pat. It'll be my first choice next time I come back to the Fremont campus."
5525073,51929649,2015-10-25,44692169,Jillian,"Wow, this listing is in a great location! It is within walking distance to many restaurants, shops, and Freemont attractions. Andrew and Heidi put together a detailed welcome packet for guests that made it easy for us to find fun things to do (and made us feel very welcome). The apartment was clean, cozy, and well organized. "
5525073,52537460,2015-10-30,1499027,James,"The unit was exactly as advertised. Very spacious, comfortable, quiet and clean.  The location is fantastic within a short walk of all the activities in Seattle's Fremont neighborhood. Andrew was an extremely responsive, helpful and gracious host.  They went above and beyond to list out tons of awesome recommendations within the immediate neighborhood.  The unit really did feel like home - they did a very good job on the updating on the space. Highly recommended if you want to stay in this part of town. Parking can be a challenge but Andrew provided a guest pass which was awesome."
5525073,56963874,2015-12-20,35585964,Alison,"Andrew was absolutely wonderful, very prompt communication and directions to the stay made arriving/checking in seamless. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed. Great location within Fremont, walking distance to many restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Whenever I had made a mistake and forgot to leave something, he went out of his way to help and was so nice and understanding. Would definitely recommend staying here! "
5525073,57644856,2015-12-28,1791359,Kevin,"With deepest apologies to all of of our previously awesome AirBnB hosts, this was by far the best AirBnB that my wife and I have had the pleasure of staying in, and I cannot recommend Andrew's place enough. Stop searching for an AirBnB in the Seattle area. It doesn't get any better than this!"

Pike place market is a $5 Uber ride away. A huge bonus and welcome surprise was the Starbucks Roastery and testing room a block away. It's their flagship store and a must see. James was incredibly responsive and great to talk to. I'll stay there again on my next for sure.  "
7735313,45297647,2015-09-01,40246178,Tabitha,James was very flexible when my flight was delayed and informative about the city giving sights to see and restraunt to try all in all he was a wonderful host.
7735313,46186530,2015-09-08,41666759,Marcia,"We had a great time! James was a great host, full of tips only a local would know. He checked in on is often enough that we felt welcomed, but now so often that it was intrusive. Location is convenient, near Pike Place market, the light rail, and Capital Hill places- Sitka and Spruce is around the corner. Place is exactly like the photos."

The location cannot be beat. It was an easy walk to everything downtown, and just around the corner from amazing restaurants and shops in Capitol Hill. We felt like it was the perfect central location for our first trip to Seattle. Getting the keys - which can sometimes be an exhausting process - was simple and easy. We were even able to stow our bags before check-in, since we arrived on an early morning train. "
7735313,48745033,2015-09-28,41374282,James,Good move in communication. Clean & well furnished. Some trouble logging onto wifi. More sports channels w b nice. Would stay again. 
7735313,49150547,2015-10-01,3552368,Jerry And Kamil,"Both James and his 'canopy' apartment are true gems. 

The space is tastefully decorated and well-equipped, and boasts treetop views and good light from its high floor positioning. For an added bonus, you can ride the elevator up to the roof top for stunningly unique views of the city. As for location, you truly cannot get much more central—just about everything is within walking distance! 

Excellent, friendly communication, typed out thorough details/information for your stay, and a sense that he sincerely cares about making your stay seamless are all reasons why James is a first-rate host. 

Would gladly return and highly recommend!  "

7735313,55009346,2015-11-27,46890262,Yao,James is great. He provided a lot of useful suggestions for Seattle tourists attractions and traffics. The apartment is very convenient for shopping. Pike place market is also walkable. 
7735313,55120284,2015-11-28,46901772,Andrew,Very easy and comfortable.
7735313,56414144,2015-12-13,49786649,Gus,"James made this experience very smooth and enjoyable.  He was available at all times for assistance despite being busy.  

The accommodations were as described and well maintained.  The surrounding area was one of the city's best places to be and its proximity to the convention center and downtown cannot be beat.  This is a must book property as an alternative to a hotel in the Seattle area as you get much more for your money.  There is a full bathroom, a full kitchen and refrigerator, heating and cooling appliances, a living area, secure access to the building, among many other amenities.

For those that may be interested, I was not aware of a gym in the building or see that one was listed in the online description.  "
7735313,57614784,2015-12-27,41968944,Maury,Very easy.  Place exactly as advertised. Would stay again.  Great location. 
7735313,58454229,2016-01-02,2552330,Patricia,Very clean apartment. Everything was as described. The apartment is only one street next to the heart of downtown. James was extremely accommodating. He offered to help and was quick to respond. 
9387189,55762232,2015-12-05,626760,Daniel,"Great experience at Party Central! It's a cute little studio on the main drag in Ballard with everything you need to stay in the best part of Seattle. There's live music all over the drag, so as long as you're prepared for the vibrant night life, you'll enjoy this place."
685600,17267116,2014-08-10,13887032,Tomasz,"Nikki is a great host and room is quite private with its own patio, which was great during summer. Location is super quiet and convenient. Bus nearby and groceries within walking distance. We didn't need a car during our stay. Park across the street is amazing for runs and long walks."
685600,17656376,2014-08-15,17334065,Antje,"Nikki was an absolutely wonderful host and the room was exactly as promised in the description!
From the first moment we felt welcome and at home. The kitchenette was great to get us started with tea, coffee and oatmeal in the morning, and there was even the possibility to sit outside in a private space and enjoy the good weather.
Since the room and bathroom are connected to the rest of the house only via a small entry area, one can be as private as one likes. At the same time Nikki was always happy to answer all our questions, suggest places to see and things to do etc. The discovery park right across the street is really a must-see!
The neighborhood and the area around the house are really nice and quiet. A grocery store is in walking distance and Magnolia Center with Starbucks, Subway and a few pubs/places to eat is about 15 to 20 minutes on foot. Downtown Seattle is easy to reach by bus.
We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Nikki's place and we'll definitely stay with her again next time we're in Seattle!"
685600,17982144,2014-08-19,14543885,Katherine,"I would definitely recommend Nikki's place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle! She is just outside of downtown in a beautiful neighborhood that is quiet and peaceful yet easily accessible to downtown. Across the street is Discovery Park, a sight that must not be missed! It has the best view in the entire area. Nikki was very accommodating, giving us tips for where to eat and how to navigate traffic. Her room is very private, off to the side of the house."
685600,18998817,2014-09-04,19849239,Anne,"Das Zimmer war wie beschrieben und die Umgebung ist super!! Wir sind erst sehr spät in Seattle gelandet, aber das war kein Problem. Nikki kann sogar deutsch! Sie hat uns kurz alles geziegt, weil sie dann weg musste. Das Zimmer ist sehr schön eingerichtet und das Bad ist sehr sauber. Nikki hat sogar Duschbad und Shampoo zur Nutzung im Bad gehabt. Auch eine Mikrowelle und Wasserkocher waren vorhanden. Kaffee und Oatmeal hat sie dür uns dagehabt. Das Zimmer hat einen Ausgang auf die kleine Terasse, so das wir abends noch draussen sitzen konnten. Die Umgebung ist sehr ruhig und genau am Discovery Park, den wir am letzten Tag auch angesehen haben. Auf jeden Fall einem Besuch Wert!! Am zweiten Abend haben wir Nikki und ihren Mitbewohner angetroffen und uns mit ihnen unterhalten können. Beide sehr aufgeschlossen und freundlich. Wir haben uns von Anfang an sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Haus ist zwar hellhörig, aber wir haben die zwei kaum mitbekommen. Alles in allem eine tolle Unterkunft. Es war unsere erste Erfahrung mit Air B&B und wir haben es nicht bereut! Wir würden jederzeit wieder bei Nikki übernachten. Sie hat auch sehr schnell auf all unsere Emails geantwortet. Sowohl vorher als auch während wir bei ihr gewohnt haben."
685600,22271165,2014-11-02,22114111,Samuel,"Nikki was great, very open and welcoming. The house is located in a very nice quiet and safe neighborhood right next to the park. The room was cozy and well equipped with all I needed to stay there comfortably without interrupting the flow of Nikki's regular activities. Everything was great. "
685600,25994018,2015-02-01,2487840,T.J.,"Nikki is, beyond being an excellent host, just one of the coolest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. The room is very comfortable for 1, plenty of storage space, and was beautifully clean when I moved in. Nikki took a genuine interest in my life and how I was doing, but was also totally willing to leave me to my own devices, which I appreciate. The proximity to Discovery Park is another bonus! If you can work around Nikki's completely reasonable teaching schedule, you will absolutely love it here."
685600,28784775,2015-03-30,25300674,Kristopher,"I had an amazing stay here.  Nikki was very kind and curteous, I really felt she wanted me to have the most pleasant stay possible.  The room was cozy and the private bathroom and personal sliding door out onto the patio were also pluses.  The proximity to Discovery Park (across the street) was something I utilized on nearly a daily basis.  The park is truly special and the sunsets I saw from the beech there were spectacular.  With a great host and wonderful location, I highly recommend staying here."
685600,31321886,2015-05-04,4017265,Ciara,"I had a great stay with Nikki and her place was perfect for my needs.  The room is large and comfortable with plenty of closet space and also has it's own bathroom which was convenient.  Since I was staying for a few weeks, I also took advantage of having the mini fridge and microwave set up in the room.  Magnolia is a really beautiful neighborhood and this particular location is just across the street from Discovery Park.  I took the bus downtown every day and was happy to find a stop so close to the house.  

Nikki is super sweet and friendly, you will feel at home right away!  We didn't see each other too much because of our schedules but she was always up for a fun chat when we ran into each other.  I would be happy to stay here again if I'm in the area!"
8098383,46060145,2015-09-07,26593805,Rhonda,"Bruce is a welcoming, considerate host. He was fully available when we needed his help with directions to the listing, yet he was quiet and unobtrusive during our stay. The space is much larger than a studio. It's more like a two bedroom apartment minus a kitchen.  There's a fenced in yard for your dog and a private entrance and parking space.  If you don't have a car, you can find multiple bus routes within a short  walking distance. This listing is much nicer in person than the photos represent. It is immaculately clean and tidy. There is so much to like about this space!  I especially love the big TV and cable, the comfy queen sized bed with fine linens, the large space (two bedrooms plus a living / dining room), and the black out blind in the bedroom.  I plan to book with Bruce again. "
8098383,46822452,2015-09-13,43566129,Marie,"This 2 bedroom was clean and spacious, exactly what I was looking for.  When I was looking for a room my priorities were: 1. close to family 2. reasonably priced and clean 3. with a reputable host.  Bruce's place and hosting fit all those things easily.  The neighbourhood is safe and quiet and getting to it was reasonably easy.  Bruce communicated well and provided directions and suggestions for coffee shops around the area.  I really enjoyed the coffee and book shop ""Vios"" at Third Place (6504 20th Ave NE, 15-20 minute walk or ~7 minute drive) My sister found a really good breakfast place called The Butcher and Baker (6412 Latona Ave NE driveable). I'd return to this BnB .  Thanks!"
8098383,47902791,2015-09-21,1626713,Jacqueline,"We had a fantastic 2-night stay in Bruce's wonderful basement suite. The suite itself was spacious, very clean and the beds were super comfortable. The cable tv, microwave, and mini fridge were welcome additions. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe and not too far from downtown Seattle. Bruce was more than we could have ever asked for in a host. He was welcoming, friendly and respectful and even drove us into town one morning. Thank you Bruce for hosting us!"
8098383,48628439,2015-09-27,7026182,Nancy,Bruce response to my request was immediate. He was very communicative and his instructions were very specific. My daughter and I arrive after dark yet with Bruce's instructions we were able to get comfortable in his spacious 2 bedroom studio. The studio is located in a quaint neighborhood walking distance to Javasti that makes both sweet and savory crepes. It is close to UW. I know because my daughter forgot some items and it only took me 25 minutes round trip to and from UW. My daughter loved your television and the reclining sofas. The beds were super comfy. And there was washer/dryer that was available a plus if we were staying longer. Thank you for sharing. 
8098383,49663901,2015-10-05,9507886,Geena,"Staying with Bruce was a great experience. The rooms were clean; he left us coffee, tea, cream and sugar; and there was even fresh bread when we arrived. He had great communication before and during our stay. Not only did he greet us (and offered his fresh baked bread) and through our stay he would check and make sure we had everything we needed. Bruce also was able to tell us of a few local places, directions to many places, and even drove us to one of our first destination. I will defiantly be referring Bruce's place to people I know that'll be going to Seattle. "
8098383,50538638,2015-10-12,16434822,Jessica,Bruce had a lovely home. It was very comfortable and spacious.  The bed was comfortable and the washer and dryer were very helpful!  The home was clean and cozy.  We felt extremely welcome. I would definitely stay there again. It was a great value. 
8098383,50950794,2015-10-16,44801884,Elizabeth,"Bruce's place is incredible. His location includes two bedrooms, a living room, and a restroom. The area of town is beautiful and there is a grocery store within walking distance. The only slight issue is that the location is about 45 minutes from downtown Seattle by bus. However, taking public transportation definitely allows you to get to know the city you are staying in.

I told Bruce beforehand that I was coming with six other friends and he was more than accommodating. We were all going our separate ways afterwards, so Bruce even allowed us to hold some luggage at his house and lent us his HOUSE KEYS for the day. He is such a kind, considerate host.

The stay was wonderful. If you are contemplating renting this place, take the plunge now!"
8098383,51333110,2015-10-19,44957731,Kimberly,"Bruce was a wonderful host. He met us at door, due to my poor navigational skills-Bruce was very welcoming and friendly. The neighbourhood was very nice and easy to maneuver-we felt safe there-we even tried a coffee shop Bruce recommended and loved it!  Bruce welcomed my daughter, who stayed with me. My first experience using airbnb was a positive one- I plan to stay at Bruce's place when I visit Seattle again."
8098383,51654521,2015-10-22,21270869,Rosemary,"Clean, quiet, roomy  place that worked great for myself plus my parents.  Host sent good directions which you would do well to follow!  We also followed the suggestion to check out the local coffee and crepe shop ( a short 10 min walk away) and were glad we did.  Yum!  One thing to know if there are more than two of you is that the bathroom is accessed via the second, single bedroom.  Not a problem for me since I was sharing with my folks, but FYI.  Beds and linens were comfy."
8098383,53385275,2015-11-08,30796398,Ricardo,We loved staying here! It felt like our own little apartment with a backyard! Bruce was very accommodating! We will definitely come back next time we're in Seattle! 
8098383,53645265,2015-11-10,4006775,Shameem,"Great neighborhood, near enough to campus.  Listing was spot on."
8098383,54057712,2015-11-15,6394178,Sagewood,such a cozy and comfortable space with a welcoming host. very convenient to Seattle Children's Hospital. Very pleasant neighborhood close to the University  and upscale shopping if you desire.  Wonderful host who left pertinent info very visible for his guests....
8098383,54613638,2015-11-22,6315157,Dave,Bruce was very friendly and welcomed us to his terrific studio. Rooms were very comfortable and the house is easily accessible.  Pictures and description were accurate and we enjoyed the size of the rooms.  Will plan to go back when we return to Seattle!
8098383,54883293,2015-11-25,16342934,Kyle,"Fantastic!
I recently stayed here for a couple days for after a shoulder surgery. Bruce was a great host. He was very accommodating, and the apartment was exactly as described. The beds were comfortable, and it was a perfect little hideaway to catch some recovery time."
8098383,55152395,2015-11-28,12932464,Sherry,"Bruce's place was wonderful! Good parking and easy access, lovely greenery in a pet friendly, secure yard. The beds and bedding are cloud nine! Comfy, friendly feeling! Bruce is the warmest, caring host you'll ever meet! Beanie insists that we come back again!"
8098383,55812355,2015-12-06,24524557,Katie,Bruce's place was great and he was always available when we needed him! And the beds were so comfortable. Would definitely stay there again!
8098383,56383699,2015-12-13,2112717,Rye,"My brothers, cat, and I had a great stay at Bruce's place. The unit looks exactly as pictured and is in a quiet and convenient location. There was lots of room for our luggage and space to park. Bruce is a welcoming, thoughtful host who went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. He even left cookies for us! "
8098383,56751085,2015-12-17,50789322,Sumer,"We were so happy to have Bruce's house as our base while visiting doctors and shopping. Between myself, my partner, my daughter, and a dog, we all had our comfortable spaces. As others have said in the reviews, the beds were wonderfully soft. As we were coming and going throughout the day, it was nice to have our own parking area and access to the rental space without having to worry about disturbing Bruce. His house is just north of the University Village shopping district, and a few more minutes away from Seattle Children's Hospital, where we were going. The place was very clean, it was stocked with all the usual amenities, and to my partner's delight, it had a very well balanced surround system on the TV with all cable channels available. We will definitely keep this place on the list for future stays. Thanks!"
8098383,56934695,2015-12-20,18062096,Jennifer,Bruce is a wonderful host!  His home was the perfect spot for us and he really goes out of his way to make you comfy.  We forgot something when we left and he went far above and beyond to get it back to us.  He's fantastic!  Highly recommend.
8098383,57033006,2015-12-21,30984656,Catherine,"Bruce was a wonderful host. He emailed us with great directions a week before our trip. The room is wonderful--extremely private and spacious, and the yard is perfect for dogs. Bruce came down to say hello when we checked, and he was extremely nice. We would stay here again if ever in the Seattle area."
8098383,57184988,2015-12-22,24268099,Eric,"My friends and I had a wonderful time at Bruce's! The place was incredibly clean and beautiful. The TV is nice, the beds are comfy and the place is very close to downtown Seattle. Bruce is very responsive and greeted us that night."
8098383,57575773,2015-12-27,50855035,Chelsea,"Lovely home! Two large bedrooms and a very nice bathroom!
We brought both of our dogs so the fenced backyard was perfect.
The little sitting area was very nice and had an electric kettle, tea and instant coffee.

"
8098383,57762345,2015-12-29,45683955,William,"Bruce was wonderful, made us feel right at home and was eager to help us with whatever we needed.  His description of place was accurate and we were not disappointed.  I hope to stay again someday and spend a longer time on great bike trail nearby."
7731836,56289224,2015-12-11,4209615,Nikolas,"Reese was a phenomenal host and her apartment was perfect for a quick stay over in Seattle. Though we I did not get to meet her in person, she was in communication as needed and very helpful. I would recommend her apartment to anyone wanting to hang out in the very cool Ballard neighborhood or to have something a little removed from the hustle and bustle of downtown.  Will definitely be staying here again when I return to Seattle. "
7731836,56964315,2015-12-20,26219136,Fernanda,"Reese was a wonderful host, very prompt to answer any messages and inquiries we had. She was very acomodating and sweet. I would highly recommend anyone who wants to see the heart of the PNW to stay here.

The house was beautiful, incredibly well located, clean, cozy, and with everything one might need for a fantastic stay in Ballard.

Overall a great experience.
"
7731836,57617338,2015-12-27,51175582,Nathan,Reese was extremely good at communicating and provided a very clean & comfortable place to stay in Seattle. I would definitely recommend staying with Reese to all.
3773568,19236643,2014-09-08,431646,Victor,"Darryl was great.  Upon our arrival he gave us a comprehensive tour of the house, gave us the run down on all the details we needed to know for our two night stay, and was quickly on his way, allowing us to settle in almost immediately after our arrival.  The house is very unique and has a lot of interesting decor that give lots of character to the house.  We loved the fact that there was no television in this house it really forced us to enjoy each other's company especially in the lovely backyard with koi pond and hot tub.  Honestly, you're not going to find a better place in Seattle for your money.  The location is literally a few minutes walk from Greenlake and we had a nice morning stroll around the lake on the second day.  There are several well known restaurants and bars nearby also in walking distance.  Overall, we just had an amazing time in this unit.  We simply couldn't have asked for more.   There was parking right outside the front door on the street and we never had trouble finding parking at any time of the day.  Bed was so comfortable we lifted the sheets to check what make/model the bed was.  My gf and I had the best sleep we had in months.  Neighborhood was quiet and it was amazing to wake up to so much sunlight in the bedroom with views of the koi pond, surrounding trees, and blue skies. Bathroom was pristine and ample clean towels were provided and rolled nicely like in a hotel.  Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
3773568,19442617,2014-09-12,8013414,Mahir,"All was as expected. Clean and comfortable. Quiet at night, but there was some cool places to go that we're walking distance. Safe neighborhood. "
3773568,19625380,2014-09-15,4525239,Roman,"I reserved Darryl's home in Wallingford for my family and it was the perfect place. Communication with Darryl was smooth, and he let us enter the home via a key code, which made arrival easy. The home is cozy but spacious, well-lit, and has numerous artistic touches. The 2 bedrooms and fold-out sofa worked well for our group and everything was super clean. The garden is especially beautiful and there is plenty of street parking. We enjoyed the compact shopping district a few blocks away with great coffee and several food options. If you have a car, the house is a 10 minute drive from Downtown. "
3773568,21322411,2014-10-14,22125626,Heidy,Darryl and his home are amazing! This was my first time booking with airbnb and he made it such an effortless experience for me and my friends. Everything we needed was available and the place was immaculate. The backyard is absolutely beautiful and made it so serene for us. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves here and we would stay here again in a heartbeat!
3773568,24362103,2014-12-27,2533382,Peter,Darryl was a great host. Communication was easy and the house was really nice. Very clean and cozy and a really good location. We would be very happy to stay here again. 
3773568,29362716,2015-04-06,29285291,Andrew,We had a very enjoyable experience staying at Darryl's place. It was clean and well-prepared for our arrival. It was a perfect place for us as two parents with a high schooler and middle schooler. The high schooler had the basement bedroom and bathroom to himself and felt like he was in his own bear cave. The middle schooler had a pull-out sofa queen to himself. The living room as a perfect meeting place for the mornings and evenings. The house is situated in TangleTown and very close to some great restaurants and a comfy cafe. It was just a few blocks from Green Lake which I was able to run around each morning to start my day. The hottube was a nice bonus after Sunday's run.
3773568,35928386,2015-06-23,23041137,Joe,"We were in town for a UW graduation.  The location of the house was perfect.  

The place was very clean and inviting.  The beds were excellent. Even the sofa bed was fine.   The hot tub was a perfect finish for a long day "
3773568,39226813,2015-07-21,15787263,Erik,Daryl rented to us for a one week hospital stay last minute. He was helpful and responsive. The residence was quiet and arrival was easy. Nice back yard and vaulted living space. Close to  Greenlake (popular Park). Sleeping arrangements are okay with one bedroom and pullout on main floor and one in the basement which is nice and cool but spartan and dusty.   Our nephew slept down there and was fine. No TV so come prepared to entertain yourselves. The furnishings are quirky but are sufficient. The loft of the house is blocked off to store his belongings. Overall a good stay with no problems.
3773568,41095963,2015-08-04,5377699,Susie,"Darryl's place was clean and comfortable for a short stay. The main floor was bright and nicely appointed, and the basement where the second room was located was comparable to a garden apartment type feel. The hot tub and back yard were a nice touch, and Darryl was very nice and communicative leading up to our stay. The neighborhood was beautiful!"
3773568,41931186,2015-08-10,14358092,Sarah,"We had a wonderful time at this airbnb!! There was plenty of room for both couples and it was super convenient to have three bathrooms.  We took advantage of the hot tub which was perfect in the cool Seattle weather. The neighborhood was also lovely and we enjoyed some nearby coffeeshops and restaurants and a run around beautiful Greenlake. 

Darryl made it easy to check in and out and the house was very clean and well kept. Would definitely recommend!

"
3773568,46219144,2015-09-08,1752031,Lisa,"Darryl's house is in a great location with a high walkability  score and quiet neighbors.  The hot tub was a special bonus on cool evenings.  The beds were comfortable, but our friends who stayed downstairs said the upstairs room is definitely the better way to go.  The linens and towels were clean and fluffy and smelled nice.  Most of the amenities were as described (including the circus performance gear in the dining room!)  During the day, the house was filled with bright sunshine (even by Seattle standards!), and the living room was a comfy place for our small group of friends to hang out."
6412858,48808613,2015-09-28,9708248,Andy,"Jennie's place was perfect for us.  Her home is pristine, the neighborhood is lovely and quiet, and only a couple miles from ""the action"" in downtown Seattle.  Her communication prior to and during our stay were clear and prompt, the printed instructions in the home were detailed yet simple, and overall she seemed very helpful and available (even though we never needed much help).  We felt great about our stay overall and we'll recommend her place to other friends visiting the area.  Thanks Jennie!"
6412858,52972519,2015-11-03,26277334,Jason,"Jennie was a great host who provided us with everything about the neighborhood and local area. The neighborhood was a quite little area of Seattle with great views. The house was modern, clean and cozy. It was home away from home."
6474341,35258571,2015-06-16,35049277,Andy,We had a great time at this listing in the Ballard area of Seattle. Valerie allowed us a very convenient check in and check out. The property was clean with comfortable furnishings. It was very conveniently located to the Ballard district and super easy access to downtown. We would not hesitate to stay here again.
6474341,36710461,2015-06-30,230115,Anika,"Valerie was very flexible and easy to reach. The space is very new and a great design. The location is really great if you have a car (free parking) and right on a bus line if you need to commute to downtown Seattle. The roof top deck was the best and we spent time up there every day. The master bathroom is amazing. It was nice to be some place that welcomed our dog, and the back of the townhouse is residential, so plenty of places to walk her. Just a note: this place would be terrible with anyone with mobility issues or bad knees as there are lots stairs. "
6474341,38158960,2015-07-13,35798839,Josh,"What a modern, clean delightful unit.  Could not have asked for an easier transition in and out, the kitchen was fully equipped, the shower with three ""zones"" delightful and the bed and couch very comfortable.  The parking space made getting in and out a breeze.

Enjoy your stay here, we certainly did.  Oh, and just three blocks up there is the best Thai restaurant and two blocks for delicious breakfasts.  What more could you ask?"
6474341,39317237,2015-07-22,15121499,Kathryn,"Valerie is a wonderful host. I had last minute changes to my travel plans and she was so helpful in finding ways to accommodate me. The listing is quite large and very modern with all the conveniences you could need. There is a great roof deck and garden which I totally took advantage of. The location itself is a short walk from beautiful parks and the water. If you are not coming with a car, 15th has plenty of public transportation and it's a really quick Uber ride to Market street or Fremont."
6474341,40119650,2015-07-28,1771849,Pamela,This is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle. The location is excellent. Valerie was easy to reach by text or phone. The bed is very comfortable. The rooftop and garden are beautiful. I would recommend this place for anyone wanting a comfortable place to stay in Seattle. I very much appreciated having coffee available after a long trip. 
6474341,40533180,2015-07-31,3684753,Joe,"Valerie was an excellent, communicative host during the entire process. The property was lovely and we wish we could have stayed longer than two days. We had a car, which made getting around the city very easy. The bed was extremely comfortable and the entire apartment was nicely furnished. There is a lovely vegetable garden on the roof deck. Overall, an excellent AirBNB experience and we would recommend this to others. One thing to keep in mind is that the apartment does face a relativelybusy road - so if you are a light sleeper, keep this in mind. This apartment is well placed to get to the Ballard neighborhood. I would recommend Pie Bar (for pie) and Staple & Fancy (for dinner). There are lots of interesting restaurants, cafes etc. in this neighborhood. We also liked Neptune Coffee in Greenwood."

The location was great and close to downtown Ballard where we spent most of our time. Looking forward to staying again."
6474341,42917377,2015-08-16,39368465,Genesis,"The house was wonderful and so was Valerie. It's very close to Ballard and Fremont area. We had one issue on the first and Valerie took care of it the moment we told her. I'd say the only negative is if you go to the apartment in the summer the bedroom doesn't have AC. But the AC in the living room is nice and ice cold. So all in all pleasant stay if recommend to anyone who wants to stay in Ballard. Very cool place, very nice host. "
6474341,45970416,2015-09-07,39398471,Leigh,"My husband and I went to Seattle for Labor Day weekend, and since we were bringing our small dogs, decided that an airbnb was our best bet. This was our first airbnb experience, and it was such a positive one! Valerie, our host, could not have been more accommodating, while also remaining delightfully unobtrusive. The space is great, and as others have said, the rooftop deck with garden is a lovely bonus! We didn't take advantage of the grill, unfortunately. We fully plan on coming back next year. Maybe we'll find time to use the grill then. :-) Thanks, Valerie!"
6474341,46638653,2015-09-12,7511824,Phil,"Beautiful townhouse.  Great for exploring Ballard, Fremont and Phinney Ridge areas.  "
6474341,55110785,2015-11-28,297313,Kerri,"The apartment/condo was really beautiful.  It was clean, warm, and very comfortable.  Everything about it was new and very modern.    The decks were great, we went to a nearby restaurant for dinner and we appreciated how Valerie was excellent in her communications with us before and after our arrival.  As I told Valerie, we were on a ""long walk"", and walked to the apartment, arriving late in the day, and left early the next day (stopping at a nearby delicious pancake place for breakfast!) for another day of walking.  My only regret is that we didn't get to linger longer in the apartment!  It was cozy and warm, and perfect.  Thank you Valerie for accommodating us and letting the kids use your air mattresses in the living room!  We all enjoyed your apartment, your clear communications via text/emails, and our visit to Ballard! "
8968494,53379519,2015-11-08,47031647,Kim,"Beate was a wonderful host - helpful in understanding the neighborhood (most importantly places to eat and drink and get groceries), very generous and kind. 
The house is beautiful and clean (PNW meets German Modern).
The location is absolutely perfect - right in the heart of Fremont and a quick bus ride from downtown.
I needed to add a few days to my stay, and Beate was totally cool with it. 
Could not recommend this place enough. No complaints. "
8968494,55126736,2015-11-28,47541309,Diana,"Beate was warm and welcoming, and I'm very thankful that my very first encounter with Seattleites was her. The house was perfectly clean, and my room super warm and cozy, I stayed for a couple of week and I got to even cook and share a meal with her! She is not only super nice but also so very easy going, and smart, never a dull moment when we sat down to chat. The neighborhood is close to so many restaurants, and even a market, a bus stop to downtown is a couple of steps away. Beate is such good company, and an incredible and thoughtful host. Loved loved staying here!"
7872980,43862054,2015-08-22,18514521,Mario,"Glenn was an incredible host. We had great communication leading up to my arrival, and when I got to his place, I was delighted to see how he had tidied up the place and left a list of restaurants/bars/coffee shops to check out in Seattle. The room was great. The apartment was even better. The view from the rooftop is worth checking out. Getting to and from downtown from his place is easy, and the Capitol Hill location is both very active and safe as well. I would highly recommend this place and Glenn to anyone checking out Seattle."
7872980,44988140,2015-08-30,39694737,Nicole,"Glenn hat uns sehr nett empfangen und im Apartment fanden wir wertvolle Tipps zum Ausgehen. Die Lage des Apartments ist ideal um abends in die hippesten Viertel der Stadt bequem zu Fuss zu gehn. Die Tatsache, dass es einen Tiefgaragenplatz gibt, ist sehr bequem und kostensparend. Zur Waterfront läuft man in ca. 15 min durch spannende Strassen."
7872980,45838718,2015-09-06,39881067,Leo,Glenn has a convenient spot close to many great bars and restaurants in Capital Hill. His apartment was clean upon our arrival and he even recommended places to visit nearby. Overall a great experience!
7872980,46567225,2015-09-11,35340821,Fernando,The location is perfect. You won't need to drive if you stay in this apartment. Glenn was really nice and helpful. I fully recommend to stay there.
7872980,48233238,2015-09-24,1742873,Patrick,"Staying at Glenn's was awesome! Super responsive and accommodating and the space itself was perfect. In a great location walkable to several restaurants and bars. Beds were comfortable, and lots of space to relax in. Would definitely come by again when visiting!"
7872980,48261246,2015-09-24,44967784,Bryan,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7872980,48409625,2015-09-26,38855334,Will,Glenn's place is amazing.  Perfect location and all of the amenities you would need.  Location is in the middle of Capital Hill and right in the middle of amazing restaurants and bars.
7872980,50204348,2015-10-10,11230629,Kenny,It was a nice area. A little further from Pike's than we thought but just a little longer walk. The accommodations were adequate. 
7872980,51383475,2015-10-19,1478099,Oliver,"Glenn's place was great. Everything was as described. The location is very convenient, and Glenn went out of his way to make sure we had a good time. I'd definitely stay at his place again."
7872980,52377879,2015-10-28,44532460,Ben,Great host and lovely apartment. Extra bonus: unit is a Valhalla of USB charging options! Thanks for everything!
3024336,14297714,2014-06-16,3666158,Lissette,Fantastic house in a great location. Very close to public transportation and lots of great places to eat nearby. It's a very comfortable home and having 1.5 baths is great. Camille let us use her washer and dryer which is an added bonus and we optimistically brought too many summer clothes and not enough cool weather clothes. She also had a lot of fantastic tips of where to eat. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
3024336,14626811,2014-06-23,1752852,Elaine,"The townhouse is clean and modern as shown in the photos.  We were able to fit our compact car in the garage which made it more convenient. The place is in a fantastic location with many great restaurants within walking distance.  Other than occasional noise from people leaving pubs at night, we enjoyed our stay and would recommend this place.  Camille was quick to respond to any question I had for her and gave us tips on where to eat in the area."
3024336,15048555,2014-07-01,15440115,Daniel,"For a first time user of Airbnb, I couldn't have had a better experience. Camille will go out of her way to settle any unknowns that may pop up for your trip. Her beautiful home made my trip greater in magnitude than I anticipated. The pictures in her listing don't do it any justice. Whenever I can visit Seattle again I will most definitely consider her place of stay. You will surely say ""we're home"" when you arrive at the front door after a full day of experiencing Seattle. Bonus: a bar with Bocce ball around the corner!"
3024336,15684416,2014-07-14,15740363,Alysha,"Camille was absolutely amazing! She not only provided her wonderful home to us but left us with detailed instructions for everything we could possibly need.  In addition, she left us with a list of some wonderful places to try nearby.  She was easy to get a hold of and was really quick with responding.  She was incredibly accommodating to all my needs and requests.  The home was very clean and well maintained and it was in a fantastic neighbourhood.  I would strongly recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay close to DT Seattle.  I will for sure be contacting Camille when I return to Seattle one day!"
3024336,16088973,2014-07-22,14446736,Kendra,The listing was beautiful! The beds were soft and comfortable and the kitchen area was stocked with anything we would need to cook during our time there. The neighborhood was full of little corner stores and lots of bars for the evening. Camille was attentive and responsive with any questions or issues we had throughout our stay. Wonderful host! 
3024336,16558115,2014-07-29,16643262,Edge,"Listing was just as described, and just what we wanted. Beautiful and comfortable home, helpful hosts, and great neighborhood"
3024336,17448014,2014-08-12,9565117,Eden And Pat,"We absolutely loved staying here. The neighborhood was so interesting and convenient to everything we wanted to do, the space so comfortable and cozy, the host do accommodating: they thought of everything, right down to great coffee and great neighborhood recommendations. Thank you, thank you."
3024336,17948257,2014-08-19,17991264,Carlos J.,"La casa se correspondía a lo anunciado. Era preciosa, bien equipada, bien situada y bien comunicada. 
La verdad es que nos sentimos como en nuestra propia casa
El barrio era muy moderno y lleno de alternativas interesantes.
Fue un acierto escoger esta opción para visitar Seattle."
3024336,18315562,2014-08-25,12711962,Rana,Me and my friends stayed here over the weekend and had a blast! The area is very accessible to walkways so we walked to downtown seattle everyday (30 minute walk). The house is very cute and tidy. The mattress on the couch is also so comfy! Also there are so many great restaurants nearby. The population of this area is mostly students since it is close to the university but that's what we enjoyed most. The nightlife is also very alive :) recommend staying with Camille. 
3024336,18570915,2014-08-28,19721082,Fay,"The apartment was lovely, clean and well equipped. The location was perfect for access to Seattle U, Capitol Hill and for walking down town.
Camille was really friendly, helpful and welcoming.
I can't recommend it enough!"
3024336,18875695,2014-09-02,225474,Flavilina,"Wow, my experience with the house and Camille were amazing. I was in town for PAX Prime and I didn't want to pay up the wazoo for the hotels in downtown. No way, dudes. No way.

The space is true to the pictures posted and it wasn't difficult to find. You can take the Link from SeaTac and transfer onto the bus to reach the house. No biggie. If you want to go into the city, walking is plausible but if you walk back, you have hills to climb. Haha.

The neighborhood has the college vibe going on because Seattle University is right there. So are the bars and restaurants. Sometimes it gets rowdy at night with those whippersnappers, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

As for Camille, she was spectacular! She was very accommodating and so nice. She went out of her way to help me out every time. I don't think I could thank her enough.

All in all, great place, great host. I highly recommend her.

"
3024336,19271197,2014-09-09,12449676,Rand,"Let me start off by saying that communication with Camille was very easy and the response was almost immediate. I never had to worry about getting information regarding the home or the reservation. Check-in and check-out couldn't be easier.

The townhouse is beautiful! The pictures do not do it justice! It's very modern and tasteful with a lot of unique touches that really make the place feel warm and inviting. I was in town for a volleyball tournament, and this townhouse was the perfect place to relax after a long, tiring day. I spent many nights on the patio enjoying the ambiance.

In terms of location, it's in an ideal spot. I was able to walk to Capitol Hill within 10 minutes and be around lots of restaurants, shops, and nightlife. Even better, it's like 2 blocks away from the frozen custard place! It's close to several bus lines that go to downtown, but you could easily walk that as well. It's also 1 block from Seattle University, so if you're child attends school there, it's also very convenient when you are visiting.

I would highly recommend Camille's home for your travels. Whenever I'm in Seattle, this will be the first place I look. Hopefully it'll be available, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's booked."
3024336,19691481,2014-09-16,20359780,Scott,"Camille was a great host!  This was my first time using airbnb and she made the entire process easy from check in to great things to do in their neighborhood.  The apartment was perfect for what I needed - was a great place to relax when not out exploring Seattle.  There are so many great restaurants all within 3 blocks including some of the best sushi I have had.  

Camille made sure everything was smooth during check in and the entire stay, even letting me leave my bags after I checked out since I had a flight much later in the day.  She had coffee ready to be made for the mornings and a full list of must sees.  I will definitely stay there again when I come back to Seattle."
3024336,20083743,2014-09-23,16879032,David Jack,"This place is fantastic! The pictures and description sold me on the listing and I was not at all disappointed. Camille is a fantastic host. She left great suggestions for places around the neighborhood, all sorts of directions for the house and even left her favorite local coffee for us to drink. So close to everything you want to do on the Hill without the bustle. Great, quiet neighborhood. Couldn't be more satisfied and hope to book with her again when I go back to Seattle. "
3024336,20502353,2014-09-30,19735351,Jay,"Wow, I can't think of a better place to stay while in Seattle. Camille's home was incredibly beautiful, spacious, and comfortable. 
As comfortable and stylish as the digs are, the location is the real winner. It is a very easy walk to almost anywhere in the city, including Pikes Place, the Space Needle, downtown, and to about a million restaurants, shops and bars. 
While it can be overwhelming visiting a new city for the first time and trying to figure out where to eat and what to see, we walked around like seasoned pros based on Camille's recommendations. 
I have a new favorite city, and I can't even imagine looking elsewhere if Camille's place is available! "
3024336,20926699,2014-10-07,7164133,Ana,Communication with Camille was easy and friendly. The house has an excellent location. The space was as described and we feel comfortable at the house. Everybody enjoyed the time we had in Seattle. 
3024336,21225094,2014-10-13,7750076,Ian,We had a great stay at Camille's place. The apartment is located right by capitol hill and there are lots of bars and restaurants nearby. Walking distance from the downtown too - especially the downhill leg! The apartment is well laid out and very roomy. The flat was exceptionally clean and well prepared for our stay. Bed was very comfortable and also a proper double sofa bed. Balcony was an added bonus too.
3024336,22617116,2014-11-10,23092045,Scott,Camille's property was amazing. She left us brownies and a list of great spots to check out while I was in town. The location of the property couldn't have been better. It is literally walking distance from  no less than 20 restaurants/bars. Couldn't ask for a better stay!
3024336,23481860,2014-12-01,8815669,Andreas,"This apartment is even more impressive than on the pictures. The couch was probably the most comfortable one we've ever enjoyed. The decoration was very nice. We didn't meet the host, but she left us a list of highlights in Seattle and other instructions concerning the apartment. The neighborhood itself is not extremely exciting, but it's close to downtown. We can definitely recommend this place."
3024336,24444055,2014-12-28,19657623,Alexandra,"Camille has a beautiful house and we had a great time staying there. We had everything that we could need, including some bonuses like delicious specialty coffee! It was also helpful to be able to park in the garage. My favorite thing about this house was the walking distance to Elysian brewery on Pike. We would definitely stay again. "
3024336,26718957,2015-02-17,15286352,Samantha,"This was by far my favorite Airbnb experience! Camille's place is beautiful, impeccably clean, and in an amazing location. Camille was incredibly communicative and helpful with everything. She left us a list of her favorite local places and some local coffee to try out... so thoughtful! Both of the beds are super comfortable and many restaurants, bars, and shops are within a short walking distance. I highly recommend staying here if you come to Seattle and hope to stay again myself one day.  "
3024336,28742387,2015-03-29,29043112,Simen,"Camille was very friendly and helpful at any point of time, and made everything a lot easier for us. We loved their apartment with its nice decor and great location, in addition to it being neat and tidy. Camille and Gaelen even left us their favorite coffee beans (which we enjoyed)! Would definitely check if it's available next time :) "
3024336,29936174,2015-04-14,29860433,Jeremy,"Camille's home was a fantastic place to stay. It's located in a great part of the city. It's very comfortable, spacious, and easily accessible. Booking with Camille was smooth and she had everything perfect for our arrival. "
3024336,32600185,2015-05-19,16837827,Jason,This property is well located and was clean and comfortable. Camille was very easy to deal with and communicated all the details we needed. Everything was as promised. Thanks for a great stay!
3024336,34456186,2015-06-08,11741170,Rich,"Beautiful home in a great Cap Hill Location!  We arrived to a personalized note from Camille with all the information we would need to use the wifi, TV, etc.  Even though the temperatures were in the 90s during our stay, the home managed to stay relatively cool which was nice.  Everything we needed was easy to find and the checkout procedure was way easier than some other AirBnBs I've rented."
