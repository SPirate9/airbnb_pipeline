5625964,37608100,2015-07-08,36329896,Steffen,"We had so much fun with Jill and John. They are great hosts, especially because they are so interested in so many things and they already have seen a lot of different places around the world. We spent a lot of time talking about all kind of things. It was great, thank you Jill and John!
Their place is really nice. It is calm and absolutely clean. And it has a very good busconnection from a bus-stop near to the house right into downtown. 
We always would come back and absolutely recommend this place. "
5625964,37870951,2015-07-11,16884291,Michael,"Jill and John are fantastic hosts, and the kindest, warmest, most interesting of people.  From the moment I stepped into their home, I was welcomed—not as a guest, in the commercial sense—but as a friend they just hadn’t met before.  
The room was clean and tidy, with a very nice private bath.  There is a nice view of the water through the sliding window, which opens to welcome a cooling breeze in the evening.  
I got the impression that if I had wanted to be left alone, my privacy would have been their priority.  But I was pretty excited about the coming weekend, and didn’t need to be left alone,.  Besides, I liked them as soon as we met, so we spent some time together.  They are the most gracious of company.  
I came to Seattle looking for a place to stay for the night, and left with two wonderful new friends.   "
5625964,38402190,2015-07-15,12301544,Timothy,"The home was lovely, clean, and very well kept.  Even though we arrived very late due to our flight arrival time, Jill waited for us and welcomed us.   The room is beautiful and just as pictured. The bathroom was stocked with plush towels and basic necessities.  Jill also showed us where the kitchen was located and welcomed us to use the refrigerator if needed.  She also provided us with a key that enabled us to come and go as we went to our appointments/engagements in the area.

Parking in this area can be a bit of an issue but we always found a place to park. "
5625964,38616838,2015-07-17,23574737,Heather,"Jill and John were so great! My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay here. It was a beautiful room/home, and the area they live in is absolutely amazing. They left us notes in the mornings giving us directions to the bus, and lots of recommendations on things to do downtown and in the area. We enjoyed our time in the neighborhood and their area than we did in the downtown/touristy areas! If we come back to Seattle, we will definitely try to book with Jill and John! "
5625964,39036677,2015-07-20,2259227,Kim And Charlie,"Jill and John were wonderful hosts - if we are back in Seattle, we would certainly stay here again! Fremont is a great neighborhood - close to good coffee shops and restaurants and breweries - just be ready to walk up and down some Seattle hills!  We had a great time exploring the area and getting to and from all other parts of Seattle by car or bus was incredibly easy.  Their townhouse is perfectly designed for guests - we had a comfortable room and bed with our own bathroom and the entrance to the house is right out the bedroom  -so we came and go as we pleased.  We had a fun time talking with Jill and John and loved their recommendations!"
5625964,40611563,2015-08-01,852996,Bartlomiej,Jill and John were amazing courteous hosts.  They have a great place and it was a pleasure to stay there. Highly recommended.
5625964,41951675,2015-08-10,34323121,Hanna,"Jill und John waren großartige Gastgeber, mein Freund und ich haben uns bei ihnen ganz wie zu Hause gefühlt. Das Zimmer mit eigenem Bad war ruhig, sauber und gemütlich, genau das Richtige für unseren Urlaubsaufenthalt in Seattle. Wenn immer wir Fragen oder organisatorische Probleme hatten, waren die beiden zur Stelle und haben sich Zeit genommen, uns zu helfen. Absolut empfehlenswert!"
5625964,43232136,2015-08-18,34217817,Neil,"Jill and John are wonderful hosts, who provided lots of information for us. We had a lovely time in their house which is very clean and has loads of facilities if you need them. It is very close to Seattle by bus, and the town of Fremont is great for arts, food and quirky sightseeing! Would love to come again someday."
5625964,44316762,2015-08-25,34649535,Chris,"Jill and John were perfect hosts. They were  friendly and helpful, and they were very knowledgable about what was going on in the local area. The house is in a great spot with lots going on within walking distance, and it's incredibly easy to get public transport to all of the tourist spots in the city. 
The room was comfortable and clean, and it was also great to have access to the washer/dryer and kitchen area. 
I couldn't recommend Jill and John more, this was basically the perfect airbnb!"
5625964,44809959,2015-08-29,40327310,Dees,"Jill and John were wonderful hosts. Besides providing a clean, comfortable, well-located room in one of the more interesting neighborhoods in Seattle, they made me feel welcome. They also shared important information about getting around -- where to catch the No 5 bus, a key transit mode from Fremont to downtown -- and about some of the delights of their own neighborhood. They were also simply good people to talk to."
5625964,45263593,2015-09-01,20682510,Nick,"Great neighborhood and Jill was looking for us as we had left a time of arrival. Very inviting and a friendly couple awaited up. They had just lost electrical service and explained how we could easily manage should the problem continue but it did not. It was the result of a wicked wind storm just a few hours earlier.
The room itself was just inside the door, very private, just right for us.
The living area was relaxed, warm and inviting and if we return to the Seattle area would likely try to find open days with these hosts again."
5625964,45693755,2015-09-05,17841021,Alex,"Jill and John were excellent hosts and were available to greet us even though out travel was very dated. Lovely home just as shown in the pictures, great guest room and private bath. AMAZING location right near all the happenings of Fremont. Highly recommend to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
5625964,45939520,2015-09-07,5012810,Don,"Our host, Jill made us feel welcome and made sure we were comfortable.  The room is well-appointed and  private with its own entrance.  The bed was comfortable and the bathroom was very nice. We only booked the room for one night but would be happy to stay longer.  The location in Fremont is very convenient with shops and services within a few blocks."
5625964,46739979,2015-09-13,40377339,Adelina,"Jill and John were such warm and inviting hosts and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. Their home is beautiful and the private room and bathroom were even better than expected. It's very convenient to take the bus so we parked our car on the street and didn't touch it for our entire stay. Jill and John gave great tips on where to go and how to get around. Fremont is a very fun neighborhood with a great mix of restaurants, cafes, shops, and nightlife. Unfortunately our stay in Seattle was short, but if we were to come back we would definitely try to stay with Jill and John again."
5625964,46890955,2015-09-14,28131377,Genise,"The listing was accurate except everything was even better than promised. The house was very clean and beautiful in a Zen, calming way. We asked  for restaurant recommendations that weren't super expensive but creative and they gave us four or five. Jill and John were great to talk to and very accommodating. "
5625964,47371507,2015-09-18,13523048,Bart,"Jill and John are very kind people. Jill greeted us when we arrived and showed us the room. She was very helpful in providing directions and giving advice over where to go and what to see. The room was very clean and is right next to the front door. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle! Parking is free on the street and the house is situated in a quiet residential neighborhood, really close to the space needle."
5625964,47657412,2015-09-21,38121442,Wei,"This stay was one that makes you go ""I wish I lived in Fremont"" being showcased by the wonderful Seattle trademark townhouses. The room was as depicted, but the bed's comfort can only be felt once you're there. I had a stuffy nose (that I had previously), but slept very well at night. Jill was very nice to accommodate our requests, and we even exchanged tips. The Fremont neighborhood was also very nice with views from atop the hill, as well as delicious diners, Theo's chocolate factory just a walk down. I would go back to stay with Jill and John over and over again."
5625964,47910244,2015-09-21,44341031,Aylette,Fantastic! My boyfriend and I highly highly recommend staying here. Jill and John were incredibly sweet and helpful. The room and bathroom were spotless and the bed was very comfortable. The location was also excellent. We would definitely come back!
5625964,48049261,2015-09-22,44173050,Erika,"Our stay with John and Jill was great. We stayed for one night and were in Seattle for two days. We met Jill, who welcomed us and gave us lots of helpful suggestions of how to get around and where to eat. The room was very clean and quiet. We didn't have much interaction with our hosts because we dropped our stuff off and then took off to go wander around, and didn't come back until later on at night. Our limited interaction though was great! Jill was very kind and accommodating, and if we head back up to that area, we'll be sure to book with them again.
"
5625964,48441202,2015-09-26,36125716,Cynthia,"Jill graciously greeted me and my daughter, and offered plenty of suggestions for the area. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. We were offered use of the kitchen, and Jill & John made us feel welcome. They deserve their rating as an airbnb super host, so I definitely recommend them!"
5625964,48554845,2015-09-27,31629111,David,"My wife and I needed a single night's stay which many times 2 nights is the minimum. Thanks for accommodating our special request.  Very nice room, very quiet and comfortable. Plenty of places to eat close by and a couple of nice coffee shops for the morning. Pretty area with close proximity to Fremont district. Would strongly recommend and plan to use again when in area. Thanks Jill and John!"
5625964,48814195,2015-09-28,39663539,Bev,"We felt very welcome, room was very comfortable, Jill and John were very friendly  yet respected our privacy"
5625964,49664913,2015-10-05,15249568,Brian,"Jill greeted us when we arrived at her beautiful house in Fremont. She gave us lots of tips for navigating public transit, places to eat and local sights. The room was comfortable, clean and the attached bathroom was convenient. The neighborhood is fun and has easy access to bus routes to various parts of the city."
5625964,51145147,2015-10-18,43445676,Kylie,"Jill and John were incredibly kind and helpful hosts.  The description of this listing was accurate, and the neighborhood was fantastic.  There were so many great places to eat, shop, and sightsee within walking distance, and there were great options for public transportation to various other places throughout the city.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
7597244,54927284,2015-11-25,48893460,Kari,"We had a lot of fun staying at Lisa Marie's apartment.  If we had of been on time (traffic) she would have been there to let us in and take us through the aprtment and neighbourhood but her text was perfect to get us in and she was quick to answer any additional questions we had.  The aprtment was clean and beautifully furnished.  We chose this place based on location and it did not disappoint.   It was walking distance to pike place, shopping areas, great restuarants and even Century Link.  There was also lots of parking in the area too if you have a car. "
7597244,55475562,2015-12-01,5864188,Marissa & Nestor,"Wonderful location! Lisa Marie was very accommodating and easy to reach:) Lisa Marie's apartment was beautiful and had gorgeous lighting in the mornings. It was very private and no noise was ever heard from the 2nd Ave bars/restaurants, but super convenient to go for drinks and food."
7597244,55963379,2015-12-07,44082443,Diana,"Lisa Marie and her place was excellent, well maintained, nicely furnished and comfortable. I cannot say the same thing about the about the apartment building itself. The building is run-down, old carpet, bad paint and a bit scary. Don't let this turn you away... after you get to Lisa Marie's unit all is good.

Centrally located, easy walking and close to rail and bus. Nice views.
We had a great time and Lisa Marie was very responsive when we had any questions.  Thank you."
7597244,56676853,2015-12-16,16533829,Isla,"We absolutely loved Lisa Marie's apartment! It was perfectly located and within walking distance to everything. We were able to walk to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, ferry terminal, stadiums and even Lake Union. If you don't want to leave the neighborhood, there are scores of bars, restaurants and coffee shops within a few blocks. We also made use of a small market a block and half away. We were able to get all of the essentials and they even had a decent selection of wine. The apartment itself was great! Very spacious and comfortable, with views of the Space Needle and Sound. Lisa Marie was very communicative and the most accommodating host we've ever stayed with. Would overwhelmingly recommend that, if you're ever in Seattle, you stay with Lisa Marie!"
4151093,20216207,2014-09-25,21505416,William,"Well organized booking and arrival processes.  Apartment was as described and expected.  Well equipped, good location, and good building amenities.  Apartment is comfortable for 2 people.  Any more than 2 requires use of the sofa sleeper, which proves to be, as with most sofa sleeper beds... uncomfortable.  Other than that, a great stay.  Thanks."
4151093,22651565,2014-11-11,21544775,Seth,The condo was exactly as described and the host was very flexible with check-in time; everything was easy peasy.  Our needs were anticipated and there were no issues with the rental.
4151093,50458335,2015-10-12,1017322,Paul,"Everyone was most helpful, including a late arrival by us and getting the key. All much appreciated and made our stay in Seattle wonderful. Great location, clean and tidy"
1163345,5003632,2013-06-06,281596,Jamie,"Great location. Nicely renovated space. The neighborhood is a little noisy, but hardly the fault of the owners. Had a great stay. Recommended. "
1163345,5280177,2013-06-22,3260566,Kirstie,"Darcy and Sean are absolutely fantastic. Great hosts and the apartment is clean and tidy. There is a full kitchen (although no microwave) and laundry facilities (SO helpful!)

The only drawback about this place is that it's very noisy - it's right over a club - and that the neighborhood isn't very nice. 
There are lots of homeless people on the streets surrounding the property and you might want to be a little cautious if you're travelling on your own.

All that being said though, if you know that the neighborhood isn't perfect, this apartment is excellent. And, as one of the other reviewer's said: the location really isn't the fault of either of the hosts! They're marvelous :)"
1163345,5328643,2013-06-24,5898018,Chris,"Darcy is awesome. So welcoming and friendly. No hassle getting in or out of the space. It was spotless and everything was incredibly comfortable. The space was great. And the price was just right.
Let me say this though. There is a club downstairs. And it can get very loud on the weekend. So if you aren't prepared for that or have kids I would suggest not staying at this location."
1163345,7189324,2013-09-09,8680751,Henne,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1163345,7464194,2013-09-21,8344598,Min Kyoung,"Darcy and Sean is a very very nice!!
A description of the house was well haejugo friendly.
Flight delays due to late check-out requests was for.

Apartment historic Pioneer Square
location is very close Downtown-
Was comfortable and clean.
Although the noise itgin Club...
If you're not keen on the sound is recommended.

Length of stay is shorter ahswiwotda.
If the opportunity presents itself again, I want to go next."
1163345,7511852,2013-09-23,5037382,Owen,"Darcy's apartment was clearly beautifully renovated recently and it was perfect for our stay.  An excellent location for anyone traveling for football and baseball-- or any kind of tourism; we saw multiple tour groups passing by to talk a little bit about the building and area.

Have a beer at the Merchants Cafe!  Darcy and her colleagues made us feel very welcome and I look forward to staying again on a future trip."
1163345,7805588,2013-10-04,5556227,Osiris,The reservation was canceled 50 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1163345,7838347,2013-10-05,1649187,Adam,The apartment was very cool and well located.  Darcy was a pleasure to work with.  The restaurant downstairs is tasty!
1163345,8084373,2013-10-15,6644406,Andrea,This was my first time using airbnb and it was great.  I had a great trip Darcy was there to meet me even though my times keep changing. The apartment was above a club so I was expecting it to be loud but it was so not a factor. The apartment is in a great location and close to the light rail which made it really convenient.  Darcy also allowed me a late check out.  All in all I would give my stay a 10 out of 10. I would definitely stay there again.  
1163345,8373107,2013-10-28,6533232,Trevor,"Awesome stay, great location, easy check-in/check-out!"
1163345,8825436,2013-11-19,4133073,Emily,Darcy and the place were both wonderful!  Darcy's bar and restaurant downstairs was both tasty and convenient. Darcy was so easy to work with and went out of her way to make our stay extra-special.  Great location too!
1163345,9505003,2013-12-31,3179610,Dwayne,"I went to Seattle for a Seahawks game and rode the train up.  This location couldn't be more convenient for arriving by train or for attending games at the stadiums.  It's right on Pioneer Square, and walking distance to more bars, restaurants and activities than you could possibly do in a weekend.  

The place was clean, the bed was fine, and access was convenient. It had free wifi and coffee available.  Very nice.  

Darcy and the team at Merchants Cafe were friendly and helpful.  

Only downsides: there is a nightclub just below this apartment that thumps pretty good until the wee hours on weekends.  If you're a light sleeper, that may be a problem.  Also, since the place is in Pioneer Square, there are plenty of homeless folks around. Like homeless everywhere, they are mostly harmless, just trying to make a living in their own way.  "
1163345,10685738,2014-03-03,956540,Michele,"I stayed at Darcy's apt. with three other young women for a conference that was being held at the Convention Center and we had a great experience. We are students on a budget so this apt. is a great value. Checking in and out was very easy because we picked up and dropped off the (email hidden) downstairs. Darcy was very responsive, flexible and a great host! 

Hop on the light rail at the aiport for about $3 and get off at Pioneer Station which is a 5-minute walk to the apt. The apt. is about a 20-minute walk to the convention center or a $7-$10 cab ride and is also very near to the International/Chinatown district. It is a 10-minute walk to Pike Place. 

I would say it can comfortably fit four people. Two of us shared the queen bed in the bedroom the other two stayed on futon mattresses in the living room. 

Some tips for travelers: We packed light and was able to wash our clothes in the washer and dryer. It was great to have a kitchen. We bought food at the Target on the way to the convention center so we could save money on lunch when we were at the convention center to use later for all the great eats Seattle has to offer. I would also recommend looking into car2go and registering an account before you go to Seattle so you can rent smart cars by the minute to navigate around the city. They'll send you a card to unlock the cars in the mail.  

Like the other reviewers said, the music downstairs can get loud, but we were so tired from our days exploring the city and attending the conference that sleeping was not a problem at all. If it is for you, this may not be the place for you. But, if you're looking for a great place for a great value with an awesome host, book it!"
1163345,10854711,2014-03-10,2532834,Kelly,"
Very nice room to stay and Darcy is a very friendly lady. I changed my schedule last min, but Darcy is very kind to help me get my key to check in. When I arrived the house, I was surprised I got a whole apartment with one living room, one kitchen, one bedroom and bathroom. Wash machine and dry machine are available, all cooking facilities are available in kitchen too. There's TV and DVD player in living room too. The sofa in living is bendable, I guess it could become a bed. So this apartment could fit 4 people maxim. 

The building is next to Underground tour center, just cross the street. Darcy's cafe bar is downstairs. Starbuck is only 1 min away, 7/11 convenient store is 2 min away, a very interesting kid toy store is 2 min away, also some good clothing store around. I really like a restaurant named Bengodi, Italian food, only 3 min away, I went twice in two days.....haha

Taxi is accessible, Darcy helped me to call yellow cab, only 5 min waiting. Bus is also around, 3 min walking to bus station, get #1, #2, #13  to city center and space needle. King Street station is 10 min walking distance or spend 5USD taking taxi. 

There is a big parking area next to Darcy's house too, very convenient. 

Pike market is not far away, I was shopping and walking on the way back from Pike market to Darcy's house, there are many stores on the way. "
1163345,11159066,2014-03-23,8503616,Lisa,Our stay at Darcy's place was amazing. The check in and check out processes were very smooth. We were comfortable during our stay and will stay again in the future!
1163345,11372033,2014-03-31,10020294,Jessica,"I recently traveled to Seattle to attend Emerald City Comic Con and I wanted to stay somewhere centrally located in case I wanted to hang around the city. The convention center is a short 20 minute walk from Darcy's place and you can also use public transportation if you don't want to walk.  Darcy was very helpful and cordial. I had read previous reviews commenting about the noise, but this was a non issue for my family and I.  I sometimes have trouble falling asleep after an exciting day, but this was not the case at the apartment. There is some noise due to the fact that you are in a city but it isn't a big deal. I would certainly recommend this nice and clean apartment. "
1163345,11484631,2014-04-05,11798819,Vitae,The rental was smooth and without a hitch. It was a nice one-bedroom apartment with a kitchen and washer & dryer (a big plus). As an added bonus there was even a bar downstairs. Very positive experience overall.
1163345,11560471,2014-04-07,5665522,Ryan,"Wonderful place, centrally located... Walk to Pike's Place Market, restaurants, groceries, nightlife, etc... Easy access, safe, comfortable.  Darcy was a great host, helping to accommodate us, by providing assistance in stocking some light groceries prior to our arrival. 

Only difficulty is parking.  "
1163345,12032862,2014-04-21,7057631,Justin,This was an awesome space! I felt safe and the room was clean. The shops in this area of town were also very quaint as are the places to eat. The host was nice and her staff great. I would stay again and may soon. 
1163345,12093389,2014-04-22,850221,Lori Michele,"Darcy is a very personable and helpful host.  The accommodations were just what I was looking for. The place is interesting, comfortable, well-located, well-priced, clean, fully-equipped and with help/service nearby.  I slept well!"
1163345,12444334,2014-05-02,14705835,Susan,"Great space, great location. Easy to work with. Cheers!"
1163345,12831480,2014-05-12,13783065,Jared,"My wife and I had an incredible anniversary weekend at Darcy's apartment. Right from minute one she was helpful and friendly. We got to the apartment from the airport later than expected and didn't have much time to eat before the march to the Sounders game started. Darcy immediately helped us out by putting in a stat order for a couple burgers and even let me wear her Sounders jersey to the game. The apartment was in the most perfect location - easy walking distance right in between the stadiums and Pike's Market. The music from the club next door really wasn't an issue at all and Darcy will continue to make things better and better with the sound proofing the apartment. It seemed like every accommodation was thought about and taken care of - towels, linens, pots/pans, dinnerware, even shampoo and conditioner. I would HIGHLY recommend staying at this apartment. Not only was it beautiful with the natural exposed brick walls and high ceilings, but Darcy was amazing and helped so much in making our experience unforgettable. "
1163345,12931727,2014-05-14,14813801,Konstantin,"The apartments are clean and spacious. Darcy is a friendly host. We had a lunch in her restaurant. It was tasty.
It was vary interesting to leave in this home, cause home is very old. But it well designed and it had everything we need."
1163345,13764145,2014-06-03,14601003,Mike,"This place is so awesome and Darcy is a great host.  I was transitioning from one Airbnb to another.  I didn't think it could better, but I was so blown away by the room, location, amenities (including a bar right downstairs) and the host. 
Backpacking it? Need to do wash? There's a washer and dryer!  I came downstairs for a beer while I washing clothes and Darcy picked up the tab!  So nice.
The room has tons of character and charm.  Super clean. If you're hanging about Pioneer Square, Pike Place or Belltown.  This is a great place to stay!"
1163345,13935532,2014-06-08,12075719,Kristen,"We stayed at Darcy's only one night, but wish it was longer! Getting in was so easy, and the (email hidden) downstairs were so friendly! The location could not be better, and the suit itself was clean and comfortable with all amenities. There was even a parking garage right across the street. We would definitely book again!  "
1163345,14268803,2014-06-16,86843,Nicole,"Did not have a chance to meet Darcy, but working with her over email was very easy.  Checking in and out at the Merchant's Cafe was also a breeze.  The unit was very charming and had all the amenities we could ask for (including washer and dryer!).  The only downside, as others have mentioned, is the Trinity club nearby that has music playing until approx 3:30a, but since we knew about it ahead of time we planned around this.  Great location and price, and the unit is comfortable."
1163345,14368506,2014-06-17,15286432,Johnny,We loved our experience!  So cool to be in such a historic building.  Great location and so fun.
1163345,14477653,2014-06-20,6136046,Kathy,"What a great place, people and overall atmosphere in the heart of Pioneer Square!
We loved the room and was super comfy in all aspects.  The folks working downstairs in the cafe were excellent and always there to help answer questions or needed anything.  Darcy  is wonderful.  There was a renovation(carpet and paint) in hallway but staff were apologetic and very kind and the renovation is looking great!  Cannot wait to come back and visit!  If you want to be in the heart of Pioneer Square; this is the place."
1163345,14610651,2014-06-23,3512068,Seth,"Great place to stay, nice location. The room was nice, but there were renovations going on. In the hallway. Some times were kind of noisy. I don't know how long they will last. It should be very nice when they are finished. 

There is some kind of club next door which also had some noise at night. Nothing that stopped me from sleeping though. I do consider myself a light sleeper. 

The merchant cafe employees were very helpful and pleasant. We needed some toilet paper later in the evening and they gladly helped us out. 

I would recommend this place to anyone. Overall good experience. "
1163345,15087961,2014-07-02,12704765,Esteban,"The apartment: Wonderful historic apartment -- the history oozes out of the walls. Nicely decorated and comfortable. We stayed in late June 2014 and would leave the window open at night so we could wake up to the call of Jonathan Livingston Seagull -- being from El Paso, TX this was a treat! Will definitely be staying here on our next visit to Seattle!

The location: Perfect location to explore downtown Seattle: Klondike Gold Rush Museum, Underground Tour, Pioneer Square bars, ball parks, Pike Street Market, Metropolitan Grill. We even walked to the Space Needle and the Experience Music Project.

Darcy Hanson: Couldn't ask for a better host. Always available, responsive and goes out of her way to please. Most people probably don't need an ironing board when on vacay, but being anal about my shirts, I needed one. My girlfriend called Darcy and she brought one right over. Not only that, but she had to scramble to locate a historical ironing board to go with the historical bldg. Thanks Darcy!"
1163345,15173132,2014-07-04,7523267,Kristina,Darcy was great and very helpful getting us situated into our apartment. The staff down stairs is also very nice as well. The location of the apartment is great and very close to pike market!!
1163345,15215038,2014-07-05,5393114,Annemarie,Darcy's place is in a great location in Pioneer Square. It is easy to walk to anything and there is a lot going on nearby. The apartment has wonderful decor and character in a cool historic building. Checking in is easy by picking up keys in the bar/restaurant downstairs. Everyone that worked there was helpful and friendly and we were able to drop off our bags before check in. We stayed there 1 night before and after our cruise and it was great. Thanks Darcy and staff at Merchants Cafe.
1163345,15445777,2014-07-09,13850983,Liam,"Great location, great room, and a great little bar and bistro down below would definitely stay again , and Darcy is very obliging"
1163345,15487561,2014-07-10,2568179,Sarah,"The location couldn't have been better. We were able to walk to pikes market (short walk) and the space needle (long walk). The neighborhood of pioneer square is also amazing lots of great shops and restaurants. The apartment itself was clean although a little warm in July. They did provide a fan in the bedroom so that was helpful. 
The staff at merchants cafe was amazing. So helpful and friendly. They let us leave our bags with them on our last day since we had a late flight. "
1163345,15531784,2014-07-11,15219449,Ray,Cool place.  I love the fact they are restoring an old heritage building.  The area is a bit rough so I'm not sure I would stay there with my young kids but I would certainly stay there again to go to a baseball or football game.  It's also very close to the train station.  They have done a nice job fixing up the rooms with wonderful exposed brick.
1163345,15672011,2014-07-14,13779754,Stephen,"The room is very cool!  High ceilings, brick walls, heritage building, it was really great.  The location is fantastic if you are going to catch a game (close to the stadiums).  Darcy was very welcoming and the staff downstairs were really nice as well.  "
1163345,15872243,2014-07-17,16438474,Steph,We had a great stay! The apartment was gorgeous and looked just like the pictures. Darcy was wonderful and spent a lot of time explaining the history of the restaurant/apartments to us. Location is very convenient to Pike Street Market. Would definitely stay here again!
1163345,15905465,2014-07-18,2127563,Janet,We really enjoyed our stay here. The location is fantastic and check in is conveniently downstairs in the bar. 
1163345,15958383,2014-07-19,15913790,Peter,"It's about a 15min walk to Pike's market and downtown.  Very centrally located.  A beautiful neighborhood.  Pretty safe to walk around and find stuff.  Overall, I had a great experience staying here. "
1163345,16307807,2014-07-25,3801996,Dallas,"Darcy's place is perfectly situated downtown, walkable to pike place market, shopping, and all the major attractions. The home has a ton of character and all the needed amenities (although wifi was difficult to connect at times). Parking can be difficult to find but there are many lots within walking distance. All in all, I'd definitely recommend Darcy's place! "
1163345,16514147,2014-07-28,18348607,Stephanie,"Highly recommend. Close to the bus lines, ferry, Pike Place, stadiums. Very clean and the bartender downstairs was very friendly and accommodating to our needs. Darcy allowed us to leave our luggage in the cafe hours before check in time. If you like old historical buildings, this studio is definitely the place to stay."
1163345,16829724,2014-08-03,14888101,Cheri,"Great location!   Clean room,  and the bartenders down stairs were super helpful with anything we needed. I would recommend Darcy,  she was a great host."
1163345,17819149,2014-08-18,4343864,Yvonne,"Perfect location !
The noise from the club nearby wasnt that bad. We loved the apartment very much.
Clean, like the photos, easy communication, perfect stay for Seattle.
 
"
1163345,17934715,2014-08-19,5453542,Mariya,"Darcy communicated very well, she always answer question and she let us leave our luggage in the cafe downstairs until 6pm for our evening flight. We got the apartment on 3th floor instead of 2th floor. Apartment itself is nice and clean. Major problem though is that it's a very steep stairs, luck of AC, also bedroom doesn't have window. When we entered apartment at night it still was very hot and stuffy. There is also no screens on window, so some fly entered appt. Window looks into another building window and garbage truck came very late at night to pick up garbage with associated smell from the open window. We were not able to operate TV (not a big deal for me). We didn't like neighborhood because of a lot of homeless people, but it's close to everything like Pike market (20 min walk). I would not recommend this apartment for the above reasons."
1163345,18164239,2014-08-23,1456641,Ben,Great place to stay in a fascinating part of the city. The apartment was spacious and comfortable. I'd definitely stay here again. 
1163345,18405636,2014-08-26,2984117,Robert,"We stayed above the Merchants Cafe in August.  As specified we asked for the (email hidden) and were quickly given the code and the keys.  Easy and efficient. When we got in the window was wide open and there was a breeze which is a relief when you are from Texas.  The apartment was clean and neat just as pictured.  Great location with easy access.  As in any city you need to be aware of some curious characters.  Great price for an historic building.

The only downside was that there are a lot of stairs and the noise from garbage trucks woke us at 3:45 AM.  "
1163345,18887571,2014-09-02,6194662,Tiffany,"We never met Darcy because she told us to work with her staff downstairs upon arriving.  We checked in with the bartender downstairs and she told us that we were in room 302 although the Airbnb listing stated 203.  I told the bartender that we were in 203 but she said that my name was for 302.  The bartender gave us the room key and didn't take us upstairs to explain anything about the unit - she just pointed that we had to go up the second flight of stairs.  When we unlocked the door, the place look ABSOLUTELY nothing like what was advertised on Airbnb.  The place we had was covered in pink and green with pink couches, rose paintings/pictures, rose shower curtains, rose sheets, etc.  I don't know whether or not Darcy uses the same pictures of one unit for all the units she rents out in that building but I felt cheated because it was false advertisement.  Darcy didn't even bother to tell us that the room would look different than what was advertised - no communication, nothing.  I not only find the lack of communication unacceptable but it's also exceptionally inappropriate to provide your guests with a place that was not advertised.  The kitchen, bathroom and bedroom were clean for the most part but the end tables in the living room had a thick layer of dust on it and used paint cans were left throughout the unit (such as on the kitchen counter).  Neither the bartender nor Darcy said anything to us about wifi even though the listing states wifi (one of the main reasons why we chose this place).  We had to text Darcy asking for the wifi information and the wifi worked only about 25% of the time - making it pointless for us because we were counting on wifi on our laptops to plan our trip.  The hallway and staircase for the building needs to be cleaned more often because it smelled of urine during our whole stay.  Overall, I would never take a listing from Darcy again nor would I ever recommend this place to any of my friends."
1163345,18946603,2014-09-03,2647574,Kari,"Location was good, pioneer square can be rough but I never felt unsafe.  It's a quick walk to pike's place market.  It was a little noisy in the building, a little hot.  The couch was very hard, the bed not a queen size as listed - actually a full.  It was super easy to check in, Darcy was very nice and we were able to do laundry which was nice.  It was a decent stay.  "
1163345,19634505,2014-09-15,18842525,Danielle,The apartment was awesome! Very clean and identical to the description. Parking was a little tricky but in a city that's expected. The lady who showed us upstairs was very nice and helpful! I would recommend this place!
1163345,19760968,2014-09-17,12882745,Diane,"This is a great apartment, with very high ceilings and beautiful woodwork. Everything was clean and nice, including the bedding and towels. It is super easy to pick up the key, since you get it from staff in the Merchant Café and Saloon downstairs. 
The location is great; right in Pioneer Square. Parking was easy right in front of the building (and free after 6 pm). We had fun talking to Alicia the bartender. I would definitely stay here again!"
1163345,19811321,2014-09-18,15783981,Barbara,"The apt was very unique, beautifully appointed, and a fabulous place to stay. It's right next to Pioneer Square and walking distance to the waterfront.   Looking forward to returning!"
1163345,20100461,2014-09-23,17256405,Mia,"First thing that needs to be noted is that the building is (or rumored to be) haunted. Ghost tours walk by the building and talk about its history. For some this may be a draw, for me, had I known, I'd have gone elsewhere. I feel like visitors really should be told this in advance.

The room was spacious, but to have a cooler room, the window needed to be open and the garbage truck woke me at 3am. It's a rougher part of the city and parking is difficult (but you can park in the lot across the street). It's quite a hike up the stairs, so unless you're traveling light, be prepared for a haul.

I wouldn't recommend staying here, only because the hauntings/hot air made me very uncomfortable. "
1163345,20330242,2014-09-28,13185200,Alexis,"Our stay at Darcy's place was what we expected. We never met her but since all the bartenders can help you to check in and out it was not a problem at all. The condo is beautiful and pretty spacious. We had everything described on the pictures. As we stayed 3 nights between thursday and saturday, it was indeed very noisy as advertised. We couldn't sleep without earplugs because of the nightclub. The location is great in regard of the city (not far from the activities) but the neighbourhood seemed not so secure. Nevertheless we never had a problem and we enjoyed our trip in Seattle."
1163345,21326041,2014-10-14,7833788,Kamrin,"This apartment is in a beautiful historic building in the heart of downtown. It's an easy walk to Pike Place Market and Seattle Center, so it's perfect for tourists. We loved staying here! "
1163345,22461850,2014-11-07,6877700,Scott,"What a great place to stay in Seattle. I love the location, Ray walk to lots of activities and dining. Check in was easy and friendly, the apartment has everything you could need and is very clean, and I didn't have any noise issues. I'll definitely be back."
1163345,22489601,2014-11-08,16393812,Jessica,Really cool location and space. Loved the exposed brick and location near public transport. It was located above an old bar. No noise issues during our stay. Easy to check in downstairs. Thanks for hosting and keeping in close communication. 
1163345,22572390,2014-11-09,12957586,Aran,"Really enjoyed the stay at Darcy's historic building. It is an authentic Pioneer Square experience. Darcy and her crew are very welcoming and helpful, and the color of the place is excellent. If you're looking for a homogenized room with disco staff you might try the W, but if you're looking for a place with character to stay after going out in downtown Seattle you will enjoy it as much as we did. Pioneer Square is rough, the night club noise runs late. But if that's not an issue you should sign on for the spacious, clean rooms that Darcy has set up. Cheers!  "
1163345,22861544,2014-11-16,11480648,Natalie,"My boyfriend and I were blown away by Darcy's beautiful space - it's much more charming and spacious than it appears in the photos! The apartment was very clean upon arrival and we had everything we needed during our stay. Picking up the keys at Merchant’s bar downstairs was very convenient. We didn't notice the noise from the adjacent nightclub, though we were out most nights. We did, however, get woken up early both mornings by loud footsteps from the guests upstairs, but this was no fault of the host and seems unavoidable in a historic building with wooden floors. Next time I reserve with Darcy I'll try to rent apartment 303 upstairs to limit the amount of noise heard from other guests.  Overall, highly recommended! Darcy's building will be my new go-to accommodation whenever I'm in Seattle. "
1163345,23057268,2014-11-21,10024767,Martin,Darcy was great and helpful. She stopped by early that evening to make sure I got in ok and that the check in went smooth.
1163345,23609621,2014-12-06,16551970,Lorina,Darcy was well organized and was prompt with responses.  Directions to get to apartment were clear and we had no issues.  We got into town early and were able to leave our bags until check-in so we didn't have to carry them around the city.  Apartment was in a lovely neighbourhood and was a lovely place to stay.  The only minor issue we had was that the cleaners must have left the windows open after cleaning. It was quite a cold day so the apartment never was able to fully heat up to a comfortable temperature.
1163345,23703888,2014-12-08,23491131,Tristen,Experience was as advertised. Merchants Cafe below was cool and bartender was super friendly and hospitable. It was like staying at a friends apartment that you didn't know.
1163345,24259760,2014-12-24,19393972,Andrew,"The apartment was great! It was exactly as advertised in a great neighborhoor. This was just like staying in a hotel, the staff at Merchants Cafe handles keys, check in, check out and everything we could possibly need. "
1163345,24609831,2014-12-31,12983293,Michael,"Second time we stayed in this building, and an easy, very positive experience. The apartment's right downtown, roomy, clean, very pleasant. Even parking was easy. "
1163345,25033702,2015-01-05,7940991,Rudy,"The room was lovely. The saloon staff were very pleasant and cheerful. Location was great, 2-3 mins from the airport train, 8-10 mins to Pike Place Market, 15-20 mins to Convention Center. Plenty of spare linens and towels.  The music does get thumping on weekend (as mentioned in the description), so light sleepers beware, but I slept through it without waking up! Darcy was especially helpful in moving our bags to our new room while we were busy at conference and couldn't get back in time for checkout/checkin."
1163345,25162964,2015-01-08,21738444,Jonathan,"This was an awesome place to stay.  This was my first trip to Seattle and had no idea where in the city would be good so i wanted to stay downtown but all the hotels are very expensive. This location was very cheap for what you get: a whole apartment to yourself in the historic, centrally-located district of Pioneer Square.  I hardly ever had to take a cab or bus, I walked everywhere!  The biggest sights are right nearby.  Check-in was easy and the place was quiet. If you want fancy, nice and new, this place is not for you.  If you like the magic of a historic building in a beautiful city, you will never want to leave. This place was worth every dollar!  "
1163345,25344614,2015-01-12,8189216,Mark,"I had a very good customer service experience with Darcy. I don't want to be too specific, so as not to set up specific expectations for others. But we had some of our own problems with our travels  Darcy has gone beyond what is expected to make sure we could make use of our time and expense. I can definitely recommend Darcy based on Customer Service."
1163345,25636181,2015-01-21,10992573,Joe,"We didn't meet Darcy, but the people working at Merchant's Cafe downstairs were plenty helpful. We tried to rent room 201, but it got booked simultaneously. Darcy was kind enough to move us up to 301 without issue (stairs, no elevator). Room 301 has a nice view Pioneer Square. It was plenty of space for two of us for a couple of days; bed, kitchenette, and dining table all in one space, with a separate bathroom area (with washer/dryer). It's a comfortable, old room. Towels and bedding was clean. 10% off at the restaurant for staying there. We didn't have an issue with noise on a Monday and Tuesday night. Would recommend these apartments for a quick stay, for sure. "
1163345,25749548,2015-01-25,2394613,Jorge,"The apartment was great! It had everything we needed and the location was unbeatable. There are bars, restaurants, coffee shops, attractions, and more within a five-minute walk of the place.

Although I didn't meet Darcy, the Merchant's Bar hostess was very attentive and helped us with questions about the apartment and to store our luggage."
1163345,26023478,2015-02-01,26119307,Karmen,Listing was as describe but felt more spacious than images show. Loved the location! Close to pretty much everything downtown or with in a cheap cab or walking distance. Right in the heart of Pioneer Square it's an authentic Seattle experience and we'll be renting again! Easy key pick up/drop off from staff at the cafe and they were very nice. 
1163345,26595524,2015-02-16,25279631,Nick,"The apartment was great and Darcy was very friendly. Although there is a club next door, and you can hear it through the walls, it wasn't as loud as the transients outside and the recycling truck at 4am. I would stay again."
1163345,26761391,2015-02-18,10374729,Leathan,Staff at Merchants was great. Darcy was great. Place was great. Great.
1163345,27222728,2015-02-28,4452081,Craig,We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our visit.  The tall ceilings and 100 year old brick made for a great ambiance.  The shower was hot and the bed comfortable! Would definitely stay again!
1163345,27689312,2015-03-09,11489087,Kelsey And Scott,"We never got a chance to meet Darcy but we only stayed for a night and were pretty much in and out. We did not do research into what merchants cafe was since the apartment is over merchants cafe. We should have done that since there was a soccer game playing when we checked in. We could hear the music and cheering from downstairs throughout the afternoon and evening when we were needing some rest time. We enjoyed the central location and building style. However the bed was not comfotable at all. We could feel the metal springs while laying down. The actually bedroom was not clean (carpet, under the bed, etc) but the rest of the Apartment was so maybe it just missed by mistake. "
1163345,27785013,2015-03-11,1777973,Mary,"Darcy's apartment was warm and cozy, and _perfect_ for what I needed! I was in town for meetings and this was the perfect place to relax after a long day. Picking up the keys from the bar downstairs was incredibly easy, and the bartender even helped me up the stairs with my bags! I will absolutely look into staying here again the next time I'm up at headquarters."
1163345,27825366,2015-03-12,1666467,Greta,"Excellent location, clean, old fashioned and stylish, awesome design.  Check in was easy and there in a giant parking facility across the street if you have a car.  "
1163345,28780198,2015-03-30,21327649,Kristian,"Located in the heart of Pioneer Square, this is one heck of a find! Everything was close by, including Starbucks (of course), and a few mom-and-pop restaurants (Planet Java diner was just a few blocks away and was fantastic!). The staff at Merchant's Cafe downstairs were nothing short of awesome. I will come back to this spot again! Thank you Darcy for everything!"
1163345,29082737,2015-04-03,27545209,Da Seul,"Darcy's place in Pioneer Square was very clean and more spacious than the images provided. The brick walls and high ceiling made a great ambiance. The listing mentioned possibly loud music on weekend nights, but my friend and I did not find it much bothersome (even on Thursday night before the Easter long weekend). Very easy check in and out with kind staff at the Merchants Cafe. Location was quite convenient as it is close to downtown. Overall, a great Seattle experience!"
1163345,30336212,2015-04-20,30590269,Susan,"The instructions for getting to the apartment from the Airport were clear and helpful, and it was very convenient to pick up the keys from the bar below.
We liked the location and the pictures represented the place accurately."
1163345,30500544,2015-04-23,25412089,Sarah,"The Merchant Cafe was in walking distance to most everything we wanted to do including Pike Market, Coffee and the Space Needle.  We took the Bolt Bus in and it was close to the drop off point as well.  It was really spacious, and had lots of kitchen space. My first time in Seattle & it was the perfect place.  The key pickup was easy and quick.  Close to a convenience store and Elm  coffee roasters ( awesome coffee ). Stayed Tues-Thurs and it was pretty quiet. Would definitely stay here again."
1163345,32161916,2015-05-15,654274,James,"My partner and I were so happy with this space. What's in the pictures and the descriptions is what you get –– a lovely, spacious suite in a nice building, well located in downtown Seattle. It was a great jumping off point for all our activities, nearby to the Pike Place Market, the stadiums, and the ferry, and was a fine place to get to come back to. Having folks around to make check-in, check-out, and any questions in between extremely easy is an added bonus."
1163345,33404987,2015-05-27,33589699,William,"The place was great! A cool hip and historic spot within walking distance of all your tourist needs. I had trouble finding the apartment, so I called her number listed and was pointed in the right direction. The bar downstairs was also very helpful."
1163345,33719108,2015-05-31,33445612,Travis,Awesome location. Very easy check in process by the folks in the restaurant/bar downstairs. The room itself was perfect for our needs and quite a bit larger that what we thought based on the pictures. Very cool space. The noise from the nightclub didnt bother us but we were out late the night we stayed there. 
1163345,33991081,2015-06-03,3490215,Sherm,"Great place. Spectacularly convenient. Spotlessly clean. Really good, historic restaurant.  
I just wish it stayed open later. I was working and never got ""home"" before 11:30 at night."
1163345,35365499,2015-06-18,17605971,Alexis,"Clean, fun, and convenient!  I would definitely recommend staying here if you're in town for a show.  We stayed on a Wednesday night and the apartment was pretty quiet, just normal city sounds. There's an overnight parking garage right across the street which is awesome.  Loved the exposed brick and decor!  The bartender who gave us our keys and showed us in was friendly and professional.  "
1163345,37313592,2015-07-06,21300989,Joshua,Great location right in Pioneer Square! Great vintage Seattle feel with exposed brick and an open layout. Everything we needed for our short stay.
1163345,37674743,2015-07-09,10607119,Ethan,Had a fun time and the place was great!
1163345,37743283,2015-07-10,32140836,Zach,Darcy's apartment was great! The pictures were exactly like the unit. The staff at Merchants Cafe were wonderful and easy to work with for check in and check out. They even allowed us a safe place to store our bags after checking out. The apartment itself was in a wonderful location. Easy walking distance to the Space Needle and Pikes Place Market. I would definitely stay here again.
1163345,39204489,2015-07-21,24344486,Kyle,Spent a great night in Seattle. The location is great. The waterfront and Pike's place are only a short walk. The staff at the cafe were very accommodating. Only negative was that the apartment was a little stuffy but that can be attributed to hot July weather.
1163345,40579991,2015-08-01,19414935,Neil,"Apartment was just as advertised. Check in was very easy. Relatively cheap parking was a little difficult to find in the area. The apartment had everything you could ask for, however, we were there towards the end of July and, even with the fans on full blast, it was very hot inside. All things considered, would definitely stay again."
1163345,40729505,2015-08-02,8500827,Jeremy,Space was clean and inviting. 
1163345,46697314,2015-09-13,9472657,Tiffany,Great apartment. Nice location. Looks exactly like the pictures and the guy from merchants cafe that let me in was really nice.  It was clean and I had no issues there. Would go again if I'm ever back in Seattle.  
1163345,46922305,2015-09-14,9536392,Lauren,"What a cool place, so much history!!! Perfect Pioneer location. Thanks again! "
1163345,47209468,2015-09-16,43522120,Jon,"This is a fantastic place to stay, really gives you a great feel for Downtown Seattle. No question, stay here and enjoy. "
1163345,48030814,2015-09-22,7673572,Leonora,"Apartment just as is described. Easy check in/out. I was only there for one night. A bit stuffy upon entrance, just turn on fans and open window. Steep stairs to apt. pack light or travel w/ a friend who will lug your bags. "
1163345,49585803,2015-10-05,14014240,Molly,"Everything held up to my expectations. The place was easy to find, clean and in a good location. "

1163345,50032972,2015-10-08,16351650,David,"Beautiful place, great neighborhood and very friendly and helpful staff right below at the Merchant's Cafe. "
1163345,50213663,2015-10-10,550114,Jacque And Dustin,"My husband and I had a great time staying here! We loved the exposed brick and vintage feel of the place, and especially loved the overall antiquity of the building. We were an easy walk to Pike Place where we had dinner reservations at Radiator Whiskey and we had a lovely time exploring the shops and bars between there and around our apartment. When we come back to Seattle, we'll be looking up a stay in Darcy's apartment again! "
1163345,50320222,2015-10-11,36087784,Ana,Great location and awesome apartment. Staff at Merchants were very helpful. Would definitely recommend.
1163345,51437062,2015-10-20,22218704,Daniel,"Seemless check-in getting the key from the bar. Place is cool with exposes brick, as it looks in the pictures.

The fold down couch isn't the most  comfortable to sleep on, so probably best for people who will only need the bedroom.

Location is perfect for exploring Seattle, walk to Century link field for a Seahawks game, do the underground tour just  around the corner, plenty of bars nearby. Short uber rides up to QueenAnne or for the night life in Capitol Hill.

Enjoyable stay all around! Thanks Darcy"
1163345,52642047,2015-10-31,25746059,Khoi,"The listing was accurate, and the apartment was clean. Check in and out were easy, thanks to the restaurant staff downstairs. "
1163345,53214113,2015-11-06,1101965,Lesli,"Great space and location!  Super clean and cozy, a perfect place.  Maria, who works in the bar downstairs, was a huge help.  Don't worry about the stairs- it's worth it."
1163345,53400239,2015-11-08,7008942,Karthika,"The location of this airbnb was great - super easy access in a cab even when it was raining, and it worked out well for us. Check in was a breeze thanks to the friendly bartender at Merchant's cafe.

While the first impression/design of the place was really cool, we found some basic amenities problematic: the bathtub clogged only after a minute or two of showering, controls for the heater and fans weren't easily accessible, the bed and sofas were very low quality. For the listed price, this was disappointing, and we wouldn't pick this place again."
1163345,55622142,2015-12-03,14949094,Liza,"The location of this apartment is very good – close to everything, however, the neighbourhood is a bit sketchy, especially when it gets dark. The apartment itself is large enough and clean, yet we found it to be rather gloomy and unwelcoming. The sofa in the living room is extremely uncomfortable – we wouldn’t recommend to rent this apartment if there are more than 2 of you. 

There’s no parking on site, but you can park across the street – expect to pay a lot for it, as it’s downtown."
1163345,56176072,2015-12-09,41627107,Dahv,"The apartment has a great ambiance, as seen in the photos.  The ceilings are high, and it's quiet (we were there on a Tuesday night).  We arrived late (after midnight), and they were very accommodating in getting us the key.  The only drawback was that the WiFi connection was slow."
1163345,56278013,2015-12-11,14717665,Zachary,"Best host experience to date. Arrived late due to travel issues, Darcy arranged for an after hours key pick up and GAVE ME A 2ND NIGHT FOR FREE. This was an unexpected level of top notch service, hosts like this is what makes airbb amazing.

The room was the most elegantly charming stay I've experienced. Aesthetic was flawlessly simple, and the location cannot be beaten. No questions asked, my next stay in Seattle will be in one of Darcy's rentals, the hostess with the mostess."
1163345,56344987,2015-12-12,45295379,Lars,"Darcy was very friendly, and the place was nice. Very convenient location! I would recommend it to others. "
7873208,44848760,2015-08-29,7836525,Jean,"En arrivant à la Crayola home j'ai été directement accueilli par Leah, gérante très sympathique de la maison. Après un tour des lieux, j'ai pu retrouver ma chambre dont la description correspond fidèlement à la réalité.
L'ambiance dans la maison est agréable, et la mixité culturelle donne lieu à des échanges très sympathiques! C'est propre, confortable et très bien situé pour aller en centre ville ou à UW.

6959336,37512474,2015-07-07,31602974,Drew,Check in was extremely easy and Nikki's home was very comfortable.  It was a little warm around mid day but cooled off nicely at night.  Temperatures were unusually high for Seattle so I don't think it would be a problem.  It was about 20 mins from the city.  Discovery Park was a great place to take walks in.  Thanks Nikki!
6959336,38314432,2015-07-14,4483416,Eitan,"Altough we didn't meet Nikki, she was very efficient and nice to us. Her house is very comfy and the local is VERY good!!! The park in front is a great for whom want to stay in the city and feel like in country side. Recommended."
6959336,39051585,2015-07-20,36575871,Charles,"Nikki has a great little house about 12 minutes from downtown Seattle. Beds in both bedrooms were comfortable and the shower has excellent pressure and water coverage - a definite plus for me.  We stayed on a very hot weekend and the home is not air conditioned, so we toasted a bit, but Nikki has fans in every room and we were all so tired after all our activities every day, nobody seemed to have too much trouble sleeping. There is a very large park directly across the street, which we didn't explore much, but provides an absolutely sensational view at sunset. We also discovered Chinooks, a ridiculously good seafood restaurant on the water only a mile and a half away from the house.  Finally, Nikki was kind enough to let my son play one f her guitars when we were there, which we couldn't get at any hotel. We paid less than half what we would have staying downtown, got the space of a Presidential Suite, peaceful, quiet nights and easy access to everywhere.  Tip: we tried Uber for the first time. They pick you up in minutes, get you where you need to be and cost a third of the price of parking downtown for a couple hours."
4243163,29285710,2015-04-06,12517530,New,"We had a wonderful time staying in the Penthouse. The beds were comfortable, the view was spectacular, and the building management staff was accommodating and friendly. I recommend Sea to Sky and staying at this lovely place. "
4243163,44903053,2015-08-30,35020381,Bruce,Everything was available and ready to go for us. Could not have been better.
4243163,49599068,2015-10-05,5050199,Gregory,The apartment was excellent.  I was there with a number of coworkers and it was a great space for multiple people to live and sleep for a few days!
4243163,51268033,2015-10-19,26256210,Angela,Had a great time.... Views were spectacular!!! Walking distance to everything we wanted to do. Highly recommend!!!!
6545773,37862260,2015-07-11,24464339,Lihi,I loved staying in Helene's loft! It was centrally located and super comfortable. She was easy to coordinate with and I had everything I needed to feel at home. 
6545773,38865046,2015-07-19,34728358,Kaui,Helene and Macy were very helpful from the very beginning! I highly recommend this adorable little studio apartment right in the heart of Belltown if you want to be in the middle of all the action. Pike's Market is just about a five minute walk away and there is no shortage of places to eat and drink around the area! All of the other cities are just a short bus ride or cab away as well. The rooftop deck has a gorgeous view and you can even see the Space Needle from up there. All of the neighbors were very  kind as well. 
463768,1508602,2012-06-18,1360766,Alyssa,"The house is gorgeous, with all the comforts of home. It's every bit as beautiful as it looks in the photos. John and Audrey were wonderful hosts and showed us around before they left on their vacation and we immediately felt at home when we moved in. The neighborhood is great with easy walking into Ballard, but out of things enough that it's quiet and has easy parking. . "
463768,2195155,2012-09-04,2975779,Peter,"This is a beautiful house in a nice neighborhood.  We stayed here to attend the Bumpershoot and see some of the Seattle area.  You'll probably have to use some form of transportation to get around, and there's a public bus stop nearby if you don't want to deal with personal driving in the city.  Light sleepers should beware that the house is next to a railroad track and has runs periodically through the night..  The layout of the house is outstanding and the kitchen was simply delightful.  The master bedroom and shower/whirlpool will spoil one. All in all, it was a delight to stay here.  The host was very quick to answer any questions we had."
463768,3084550,2012-12-13,2326984,Michael,"This is a great house. All new and beautifully done. It's the kind of place you want to hang out in. But the location is also great, because you're right near the water, and right near Ballard. John knows just what to recommend in Ballard. If you stay at this lovely house, you seriously need to go to The Walrus & Carpenter--killer oysters and great sea food. Sit up at the raw bar and talk to the oyster shuckers while you eat. We also had dinner at Bastille, a French Restaurant--one of the few places in North America that serves Boudin Noir, if you are so inclined. They too did a solid job.
John, made everything very simple, and stayed in easy communication."
463768,3215161,2013-01-02,2382422,Daniel,"The house was beautiful and spacious, decorated with plenty of Christmas cheer.  The neighborhood is wonderful and close to many restaurants, cafes, and bus stops.  Our family enjoyed the trip and look forward to returning."
463768,5587727,2013-07-07,2897164,Jennifer And Michael,"John has a great place in the charming and cool Ballard neighborhood. The house is walking distance to great bars,  restaurants and eclectic shops. Staying at John's place afforded us the relaxing setting of a quiet neighborhood but the close proximity to downtown Seattle. Would definitely recommend staying here. "
463768,6083078,2013-07-29,7364731,Annie,"This is a beautiful home in the great neighborhood of Ballard.  We came into Seattle on the train and were able to easily access the neighborhood and also head downtown via public transportation.  Having a spacious residence to use as ""home base"" throughout the weekend made for a relaxing trip."
463768,7903861,2013-10-07,1523525,Meghan,"An absolutely beautiful home in a great location. It's light filled and spacious with a gorgeous kitchen and a layout that encourages lounging. We are former Seattle-ites who were in town for a weekend. It was great to be located near some of our favorite places, a few minutes from downtown Ballard as well as Golden Gardens and the Ballard Locks. The Sunday farmers market in the neighborhood is delightful. Great food in the area includes THE best pastries in the city at Cafe Besalu, also: La Carta de Oaxaca, The Walrus and the Carpenter, Bastille, Volterra, señor moose.  Delicious quick options include Red Mill Burgers and Pho Than Brothers. Although the food isn't great, you also can't beat the deck at Rays Boathouse at sunset.  If you want to see neighborhoody Seattle you could do no better, you can occupy yourself for several days and never go more than a few miles.
Thanks for letting us stay in your delightful home! "

Lots of beautiful flowers and flowering trees, close to some of the restaurants, movie theatre, cools shops and great views.  Highly recommended!"
463768,13460824,2014-05-27,1481566,Khris,"PROS: Very nice home, well accommodated, with responsive and pleasant hosts! We needed three bedrooms and a hotel would have been expensive and separated our family so having a great place that we could all stay together at an affordable price in a hip neighborhood really made our weekend :)

CONS: I love trains so it was ok for me, however, they do run periodically near the neighborhood during the day/night so for those sensitive to noise this may be something to think about."
463768,15312788,2014-07-07,14551786,Greg,"Beautiful Home. Had a lot of fun staying there. Everything we needed was available to us. Some of the other reviews mentioned the train being quiet, and this did not seem to be the case. With the house having no AC, we slept with the windows open the first night. The trains go by throughout the night and were quite loud, even with the windows closed. Really glad we chose the house, but wish the train noise wasn't so loud. Thanks!"

It is in an excellent location (easy walk to Ballard, a bit longer but totally doable walk to Golden Gardens) with a nice view of the water from the master balcony and very clean and comfortable (great bed!). And it has good energy! Which is great. My husband and I really enjoyed being so close to Ballard's bustling (and fantastic) restaurants, etc., and appreciated John's restaurant recommendations. Check in/check out instructions were easy and totally reasonable. We only stayed two nights but would absolutely come back!"
463768,18301878,2014-08-25,14841702,Anne,John made the process very easy and his home was absolutely gorgeous.  Would definitely recommend to others!

The decor was my personal favorite, from the oh so cool baby blue painted piano to the long rustic yet modern wooden benches along the table that easily sat our party of 8 for meals. The surrounding neighborhood of Ballard is so cute and is full of cool little shops and restaurants. Highly recommend their beautiful home!! "

463768,40727358,2015-08-02,32133579,Julie,"We had the most enjoyable time this past weekend at this BEAUTIFUL home. Our host, John, with whom I communicated, was beyond helpful and prompt to answer any questions I had. His home included all we needed. We were busy with activities for our son's wedding during our days spent there, but there are many things to do and places to eat in the immediate area. I think I would love to come back next time to enjoy some of the surrounding neighborhood. If you are looking for a home to rent, THIS is THE one for you! You can tell by the photos of their family throughout the house, there's a lot of love and happiness within the walls of this home. It's a gorgeous house, yet very warm and welcoming, a true reflection of the hosts!!!! "
463768,41859316,2015-08-09,30849727,Collin,"Lovely home in a great area.  One of the best areas in all of Seattle is just a short walk away, which we took advantage of on our first night. 
Everything was easy to navigate (wireless internet+Bluetooth sound system), left us great recommendations  on where to eat. The second bedroom above the garage was huge and felt like its own master suite. Truly enjoyed our stay. A+"
463768,43988922,2015-08-23,12743234,Stephen,We really enjoyed our stay in Ballard- it's a great neighbourhood to visit and is convenient for central Seattle.  The house is perfect for families (we are a family of 5) and John was a great host. Some mention of the train in other comments ( it does run pat the house and does make some noise). This was not an issue for us.  If you are staying in Seattle we would definitely recommend.
463768,44962127,2015-08-30,34534207,Dayne,Had a great stay at John's place! Close to everything in Ballard and the house was even better than the pictures showed. Would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle looking for a comfortable place to stay!
463768,55815452,2015-12-06,27287341,Shannon,"Our stay last weekend was a bad experience. We arrived Friday night to a dark house without the heat turned on. It didn't take more than a few minutes to feel as though we were breaking and entering, that is, not welcome whatsoever. The kitchen was not particularly clean and the laundry room, where we were instructed to hang our clothes, was a complete wreck. In the master bathroom, only one piece of tiny, well-used soap was left for us, along with bleached-stained towels. The nightstands in the master bedroom had stacks of books on top of them. The master bed was very nice, and it was the only redeeming quality that we found here. Overall, we found the pictures posted on the Airbnb site to be very misleading. It astounds me that we paid well over $700 to stay here. Don't make the same mistake. 

"
23430,62352,2010-07-08,122895,Denise,"We had a great time visiting Seattle and the place was great.  Walking to all sorts of attractions was really easy from 3rd Ave.  The neighborhood has many great restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops sushi bars, you name it, it's all right there.  Everyone should try the little Italian place on 2nd.  Il Vita E Bella.  The guy running the place is one of those folks who come out and talk to everyone.  The food was delicious and service couldn't be beat.
Anyway, Urban Oasis was a fabulous place to be and we will definitely keep it in mind for our next trip to Seattle.  Yes, a little loud but that's just part of being in a large city.  It didn't bother me."
23430,63850,2010-07-12,111631,Mary,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Urban Oasis. Belltown is close to everything, with a supermarket across the road, and no problem to get the car safely garaged. The apartment was very up to date, with everything one could need for a short stay.  The only small complaint would be the very thin curtains which let a lot of light through if one tried to sleep late, otherwise highly recommended.
Cheers

23430,4572714,2013-05-13,776566,Sarah,"The apartment was clean and well-appointed, with all the necessities to cook in the kitchen. The location was central, but not in the noisy part of downtown. We were able to walk to Pike Place Market easily and shop there. The owners provided reusable bags which made picking up items at the market convenient. There are several instructions left in the apartment and emailed ahead of time in order to inform guests of all the information needed. We were able to get into the apartment with a lockbox code, which we prefer. There was also a thorough guide about the area of Belltown and recommended things to do left by the owners - a nice touch. The roof top deck is not to be missed. I enjoyed laying on the hammock in the sun and we spent an evening (our anniversary) with wine and snacks on the roof. Although there is a view of the water from the apartment, it's distant. Overall, we had a very comfortable stay. "
23430,6510992,2013-08-15,7014799,David,"The stay in Seattle with Seattle Oasis was lovely. It was very well organized and was a superb place to stay. We had some problems with a cancelled flight and they were terrific in helping us out.

The arrival and departure instructions were clear and useful, and the welcome package was really nice! If we're ever wanting to stay in Belltown again, we'd definitely look for this place."
23430,13207960,2014-05-22,6122040,Lucas,"Condo was small but in a great location for our family vacation. Check in was very easy and we were even able to leave our luggage in the condo even though our train arrived well before the 4 PM check-in time. Belltown is a lively neighborhood with lots of restaurants and nightlife, and easy walking distance to Seattle Center, Pike Place Market and Downtown. I would probably recommend this particular condo for only 2 people even though it does sleep 4, but we had a great experience with Seattle Oasis and I would definitely rent from them again."
23430,14270070,2014-06-16,13486593,Jane,"We had 2 condos for the same time periods.  Everything went smoothly, great central location.  All our needs were seen to.  We had a slight problem with a TV and a service person was there within a half hour and fixed it!  The condos were very clean, comfortable, more than met our expectations.  Host was very helpful and answered all our questions and made this part of our vacation smooth and without incidents.  I would recommend these units and this host again!"
23430,14485782,2014-06-20,14880438,Anna,"Great spot! Lovely view, lots of space. There was a pool, gym and it was super close to Pike Place Market. It was clean, they left a welcome package. "
23430,15670739,2014-07-14,7797725,Connie,"Lovely apartment in the heart of Belltown with many amenities!  We loved sitting on the balcony and enjoying the view.  We didn't get there until after midnight and getting access to the apartment was effortless.  It was great to have a secured parking area, we were able to leave our bikes in our car without worries."
23430,18616359,2014-08-29,2112066,Paul & Holly,"From the welcome basket to the beautiful view and location we LOVED our stay here and were made to feel very welcome. 

There are many great restaurants within easy walking distance, a grocery store and drug store just a block away and the city bus stops outside the front door.  Pike Place Market was only a 5 to 10 minute walk.

One thing that was a bit of a surprise was the lack of A/C - being from Houston where everything is air conditioned we were not prepared for the lack of it. The temperature in Seattle got up to the mid to high 80s the first hight we were there and sleeping at night was difficult. That said, no one has A/C in Seattle and the second night was much cooler and we slept comfortably. 

The kitchen was completely supplied with dishes, glasses, pots & pans and a dishwasher - they even had a garlic press! Plus there is a washer and dryer as well.

Thanks for a wonderful visit and we will definitely be back!"

23430,25809723,2015-01-26,12234386,Lauren,"We loved our stay at this condo! It is exactly what we envisioned- we just wanted a small space, nicer and more homey than a hotel room.  The space was very comfortable and intimate. I think it is a great value- I am a new airbnb user but I don't think you could find much nicer for the price. We did not need to contact the host much, but in terms of check-in and check-out procedures the people at Oasis were very available.

The location is excellent- close to the water, the market, and we were able to walk almost everywhere we needed to go for purposes of our trip. There is a bus stop right outside as well, and an available parking garage which was great.  I will absolutely stay with Darik or an Oasis property again next time I am in Seattle. I can honestly say I have no complaints- this condo was perfect and had everything we could have needed.  "

There is not A/C and it was very hot/difficult to sleep on the first 2 nights of our stay, although, admittedly, it is my mistake for not looking closer at the description. Otherwise, it was perfect!"
23430,46378776,2015-09-10,31671272,Meredith,"The condo was nice and in a nice/ safe building. The parking spot was a definite plus. It was also great to be near the touristy attractions such as the space needle. I would definitely recommend this condo for 2 adults. I do NOT advise people with small children to rent this condo. I was constantly worried they were going to break things, and there is not much room to spread out with small kids. But don't get me wrong, if only adults staying there, you are good to go!!!"
23430,49976625,2015-10-08,6105090,Joan,"Unfortunately, we were not able to travel to Seattle at the last minute.  But, when I called directly to cancel, I got wonderful treatment, very understanding of our situation.  We will be returning for our vacation to Seattle sometime in the future."
23430,51024823,2015-10-17,40639862,Molly,"Great place! Would definitely recommend and stay there again. Great instructions for gaining access to the building and right in the center of town. Condo was clean, beautiful view, super comfy bed and all around great place. Had a wonderful dinner at Ferry's upstairs oyster bar and GREAT cocktails at the Bengal lounge. Thanks! "
7037522,37803416,2015-07-10,33052393,Silvia,"We had a nice and welcoming arrival. We were the first ones in there and it was really nice, clean and new. It was a really nice area, quiet but still close to the city. We had a really nice time there."
7037522,38046074,2015-07-12,36963076,Max,We had a wonderful stay at Andy and Barbara place. It was very clean and we received a very kind welcome and tour of the place. 10/10 would recommend. Very close to the city with good restaurants in the area. 
7037522,38548831,2015-07-16,25998134,Lydia & Rod,"Barbara and Andy were gracious, helpful hosts. They were easy to reach by email or phone. Their studio apartment was spacious, very clean and nicely decorated.  Being in a great location, it took us about 15 minutes to drive right downtown (non rush hour), and is only minutes from lovely Seward Park. In all, a great experience!"
7037522,39440310,2015-07-23,38204049,Kay,"Barbara and Andy were very welcoming and we enjoyed the breakfast items and fruit they provided. Their suite was exceptionally clean and comfortable and was exactly as pictured. Thanks you for going out of your way to provide transportation information and for your suggestions on places to eat and even to buy groceries. If we are back in Seattle, we'd love to stay with you again!"
7037522,40625764,2015-08-01,21172765,Kevin,"Barbara and Andy were so very gracious in having me. Their fully furnished basement was extremely easy to access and was exactly what I needed for my stay. It's nestled in a quiet neighborhood, but close to great food and steps away from Lake Washington. If my travels bring me back to Seattle, I can only hope this Airbnb is available!"
7037522,40968159,2015-08-03,28540160,Zachary,"Barbara and Andy were great hosts and the apartment was beautiful. The only regret that I have is that I couldn't stay longer to take more advantage of the area and the list of activities and attractions that were provided. Everything was clean, and communication was great through and through. I couldn't have asked for better hosts, and can't thank them enough for accommodating my partner and I for a great weekend. "
7037522,42547990,2015-08-14,36004958,Beth,We rented the studio for two weeks with our nearly 2 year old toddler and our stay could not have been better!  Barbara and Andy and very welcoming and super friendly.  The studio has great space and it is an incredibly comfortable place to stay.  I highly recommend staying here.  It's a great neighborhood and close to downtown Seattle.
7037522,42890688,2015-08-16,1697863,Kate,"This was a great place to stay for a weekend.  It's walking distance to a beautiful footpath and an easy drive to Columbia City where I picked up coffee and great croissants.  Barbara and Andy did a terrific job of stocking the home with all the comforts you'd need.  The bed was comfortable and the kitchen well supplied.  It was a quiet neighborhood, but still close to everything.  I would definitely stay here again."
7037522,43266920,2015-08-18,36499799,Joanne,Our host was able to accommodate me with gluten free food for breakfast. The rooms were very clean and comfortable with the lake and boat yard at the bottom of the road. The surrounding area was amazingly beautiful with cafes and shops close by.
7037522,43793676,2015-08-22,38176296,Ann,"Since our hosts were not in town when we arrived they made arrangements with a neighbor to let us in and show us around.  The neighbor was very helpful and showed us how the locks worked and pointed out the breakfast items that the owner left for us, which included cereal, milk, yogurt and orange juice.

The location was (email hidden)t too far from the airport and the drive to downtown was very easy and quick.  The view of Lake Washington from the street in front of the house is very pretty and the walk to the lake is just a couple of minutes.  There was a booklet describing several local restaurants and coffee shops with maps showing how to walk to each, which was appreciated.

The bed was comfortable and there was a washer and dryer and kitchen if you were staying longer and needed to do laundry or wanted to cook.  Our visit was only three nights so we did not use either.

The only issue we had was that all three nights when we returned from a long day we were greeted by a very large spider, which really scared my son who has a real fear of spiders....think Ron Weasley.  He did a lot of research and sent a picture to a website that identified the spider as a hobo spider.  They said that these spiders are very common in the Seattle area in August, but that did little to comfort my son who looked up images of spider bite reactions and they were not pretty.  And I was not too excited to have to kill three of these 2"" diameter quick moving spiders myself.  

The owners returned home the night before we left, so we were able to meet them briefly before we took off, which was nice.  "
7037522,44167672,2015-08-24,18224932,Jennifer,"Andy and Barbara are very nice.   They made us feel very welcomed and gave us the grand tour.   Even had breakfast items for us in the morning!  

We were in town for a triathlon at Genesse park so studio was perfect location!  Parking was a breeze!

Thank you Andy and Barbara - we will be back!"
7037522,44932652,2015-08-30,37081,Andrea,"We enjoyed our stay! The studio was large enough for our toddler to explore and not get into trouble, and the nearby playground was an added bonus! It was great to have laundry facilities right in the bathroom and a kitchen that was thoughtfully stocked with breakfast basics. The home was close to friends as well as convenient to both downtown Seattle and SeaTac Airport. The hosts made it easy to check in and did everything to make our stay comfortable. Thanks so much!"
7037522,45449209,2015-09-02,27335951,Kyla,A beautiful studio in a charming neighborhood! Andy and Barbara were incredibly generous and friendly. Very easy access into some of Seattle's best neighborhoods! Highly recommend! 
7037522,45907552,2015-09-06,32522387,Jill,We had a lovely stay with Andy and Barbara and their first floor unit was well appointed and quiet. They even allowed us to air out our camping tent in their back yard! The neighborhood is very authentic and convenient.
7037522,46533514,2015-09-11,36216832,Angela,The studio is exactly what the listing says. It is very accommodating and roomie.    Great neighborhood and the studio felt like home away from home. Quiet neighborhood with beautiful views of the water. 
7037522,46720596,2015-09-13,38575667,Patricia,Our hosts made us feel very welcome. The studio was exactly as it appeared on airbnb. The neighborhood was beautiful. It was quiet and close to the water. 
7037522,48011468,2015-09-22,11077274,Judy,"This is one of the best airbnb's we have ever stayed in in Seattle.  Barbara and Andy could not have been more   gracious and accommodating hosts.  They had food in the refrigerator for a couple days of breakfasts.  We were not aware that there was a separate
room for the kitchen.  If we had time,  we could have cooked
lovely meals there with no trouble.  In fact,  it is such a lovely space,
well-laid out,  and with everything one needs,  we could have stayed
a month with no trouble.

Barbara and Andy have a huge yard,  with lovely landscaping.  They
invited us to share this space with our 3-year old granddaughter.
We brought her over twice to play soccer in their backyard.  They invited her to pick tomatoes off the vine as well as raspberries.
The use of outdoor space is an enormous plus to any airbnb,  and the hosts are quite generous in sharing that space.

I guess it is clear that this place and the hosts are quite exceptional.
We look forward to going back there."
7037522,48921001,2015-09-29,42788139,Laura,This studio was amazing! Everything from the kitchen to the bed was comfy and cozy. The place was extremely clean and organized. The kitchen was stocked with all the appliances you would need. Barbara and Andy made sure that I had everything I needed. There was an Airbnb guide book with local places to eat. This came in very handy and the suggestions were great. The location was perfect and just a short distance from downtown Seattle and all the touristy spots you would want to see for a first time visit. I'm very glad I got to stay here. For a first time Airbnb experience this was fantastic. I definitely recommend this place! 
7037522,49260198,2015-10-02,22310764,Cw,"The house is very beautiful and very near the lake. Andy and Barbara are very nice, even provide a lot of personal helps, appreciated! We enjoy it very much and highly recommend it!"
7037522,49680319,2015-10-05,6991492,Sukjin,"Andy and Barbara were very thoughtful persons. The place is very nice and cozy, with independent kitchen and bathroom. The house is located near a beautiful lake where we took a nice walk. We enjoyed our stay so much and we appreciate our host. "
7037522,50132083,2015-10-09,7657699,Anne,I stayed for two nights. I used to spend a lot of time on the Seward Park area and was happy to return and find Columbia City a happening place. The hosts provided great recommendations for places to go. The studio was very comfortable and well appointed. Hosts were very easy to communicate with. Thanks for the lovely stay. 
7037522,50942751,2015-10-16,43810308,Toni,This apartment was just a few blocks away from Lake Washington and it was still fairly close to all the touristy things in downtown Seattle.  Andy and Barbara were very hospitable and easy to communicate with.  It has a full kitchen and is fully stocked with all the equipment you need.
7037522,51196906,2015-10-18,1916976,José,"This wasn't just another weekend but an incredible experience, which couldn't be possible without these hosts at all.
The location is perfect, almost a dream, just one block from Lake Washington and a few from Seward Park, an outstanding landscape.
The apt is  just awesome: very nice furniture, bright, roomy, fully equipped kitchen; and everything so carefully prepared that makes you feel completely comfortable since the very beginning.
Barbara and Andy made sure to get everything ready to make my experience in Seattle memorable. They make the difference!
I'm looking forward to staying with them again!"
7037522,53505504,2015-11-09,43368802,Evan,Wonderful location near Seward Park and Columbia city . hosts were accommodating and attentive.  apartment is nicely renovated and separate from main living quarters
7037522,55146893,2015-11-28,10264088,John,"Andy and Barbara are terrific hosts. They greeted us warmly and gave us a nice presentation about the local area and tips on where to eat. The studio has its own kitchen area, which had everything needed to prepare meals. The location is spectacular and the studio is very comfortable. We stayed during Thanksgiving and they even shared some turkey and fixings with us! I definitely recommend the studio."
7037522,56662683,2015-12-16,46209635,Phyllis,"Barabara and Andy were great. They responeded quickly. The studio was just as advertised! Barabara had muffins and other breakfast goodies stocked for us! Maps and suggestions for destinations were left along with maps and brochures!  We were very comfortable! The bed was great! Wonderful location close to Seward Park where we walked . Beautiful! 
Saw eagles and many water birds!
the kitchen was small but nice and we able to cook! Very Nice! Highly Recommend!"
7037522,57679789,2015-12-28,4232724,Jill,"We booked this spot for our in-laws who were in from Texas for Christmas. My father-in-law said ""I wish we could live here!"".
The space is so sweet and charming. It's clean, updated and has good organizational details.

Andy and Barbara were super helpful.
We will definitely be using this spot for future out of town guests.
Jill + John, Seattle"
909102,4816188,2013-05-27,6340958,Kristen,"Staying with Frank was great!  He is friendly, well traveled and interested in meeting new people as both a host and a guest. He made us feel welcome in his home from the first communication to the moment we left.  His place is beautiful.  In addition to the nice en suite room on the entry level, there is use of the ""great room"" as he calls it, which gives you a super view of the iconic Space Needle and the water front.  It also includes his well appointed, roomy kitchen.  The double bed is very comfortable and the shower is fabulous.  There is a big closet as well as dresser for your use.  Frank was very accommodating; he made room for our compact car in his covered parking area.  (This may not be the case for larger cars)  He even made special German pancakes for us on my partner's birthday.  His place is located within walking distance of a large grocery store and the Seattle Center with events and various transit choices, It was a very pleasant stay and we would stay there again."
909102,5071982,2013-06-10,3884099,Frank,"We stayed at Frank's place for 1 night. Way to short. Queen Anne is a great neighborhood with many independent places for coffee, dinner, ice cream, lunch etc. It's not far from downtown either. Frank's place is wonderful, has everything you need and is clean and comfortable. The views from the house are fantastic and Frank is a great host and very welcoming. We felt at home and will come back when we visit Seattle in the future."
909102,5585804,2013-07-07,6722474,Crystal,"Staying with Frank was very plesent, he was very welcoming with his home and gave us much knowledge on where to go and what to see.  Highly reccomend this stay in his amazing home with him."
909102,5667034,2013-07-10,3622798,Mike,"I have to say that Frank was the prefect host. He has an amazingly spacious home, in lower Queen Anne. I stayed there with my roommate and his girlfriend, and Frank was extremely accomadating and gracious. Extending us a welcoming and warm environment. He is great gentleman, and I highly recommend staying with him if you have the opportunity."
909102,5945878,2013-07-23,6826646,Laura,"As my friend and I got ready for our trip to Seattle, Frank emailed to get our ETA and to give us an idea of the best options to get to his place from the airport. He made himself available when we arrived to show us the room and the rest of his lovely house. The room was just what we needed, clean, comfortable and plenty of space for two. We could see some of the best views of the city from his balcony/roof and the neighborhood felt very safe. He gave us a list of some of  his suggestions for things to do and gave us tips for how to get around. We found the location to be pretty ideal. We were close to lots of cafes and restaurants in Queen Anne, as well as walking distance from the Seattle center.  Frank was overall a very hospitable and considerate host. He made us feel right at home in his beautiful home. Staying with Frank was the perfect way to experience Seattle for the first time and I would certainly book with him again in the future. "
909102,6026411,2013-07-27,1698192,Bodo,"The perfect place to stay in Seattle! Frank was a great host, he had a lot of information on sights and attractions in Seattle. We had also great evenings with him on his terrace with fantastic view over Seattle, talking with him and spent a nice time. Our room  was really clean, nice and comfortable.The space, location, everything, was amazing!  We highly recommend this place and we will come back for sure at our next trip to Seattle. Thank you!"

909102,6078929,2013-07-29,747492,Nichole,"We had a great time in Seattle, partly due to where we stayed. Frank's place is the ideal location for visiting Seattle - he has a great place with a great view, great restaurants within 5 min walk, space needle within 15 min walk. Frank is friendly and very informative, gave us suggestions for places to visit. Our friend drove a Prius and could park inside his garage, we drove a Camry, therefore, we had to find street parking that's usually within a block away. Will definitely stay at Frank's again if we go back to Seattle."
909102,6416852,2013-08-12,4141799,Sally,"I really enjoyed my stay in Frank's beautiful airy house. My room was very comfortable, with plenty of available closet space.
The panoramic views from the great room and roof deck are lovely by day or night. At a short walking distance from the Space Needle, museums and other places in Seattle Center (as well as a variety of restaurants) the location is ideal and I would love to stay there again if I were to revisit Seattle."

909102,6970254,2013-09-01,3261258,Stephen,"Frank is a great host with lots of great traveling stories and a longtime airbnb user. 

Greeted us at the door, even though we were about an hour later than expected and shared a welcoming drink with us.

And the picture of the skyline is no lie. Absolutely breathtaking location. Frank, my girlfriend, and I had a drink on his terrace and talked well through the sunset.

The room is right off the main entrance and felt very private. We came and left with ease and felt very safe at Frank's house and the neighborhood.

10 minute walk to the Space Needle and Monorail which takes you right downtown and a couple blocks from Pike Place Market.

Frank was such a good host that he even gave us a ride to our car with our bags (because we kind of lost track where we parked... oops).

Frank said that his place has been booked solid, so if you see that it is available, BOOK IT! You won't regret it!"
909102,7067816,2013-09-05,6459045,Peet,"This is a highly recommended place to stay. Frank  is an excellent host and knows how to make you feel at home.  He even showed us around. Really great!!
Also he can tell you much about the city and places  you want to go. The private home is clean and comfortable.  
We had a very good time at this place and in the city of Seattle.
Nella&Petra"
909102,7225512,2013-09-11,3950020,Amy,"Bella Vista is the PERFECT place to stay when visiting Seattle.  Frank is a wonderful host with a gorgeous, well-appointed house in the heart of the city.  Enjoy!
"
909102,7344963,2013-09-16,4859699,Ann,"Great place, fabulous location, incredible view from the rooftop!  Wish we could have stayed longer."
909102,7605324,2013-09-26,2746372,Jellie,"I stayed at Frank's place for 10 nights and really enjoyed it. The room is great, comfy bed and good shower. Moreover, when the sun is out you get to enjoy the roof terrace, which has a stunning view. Last but not least, Frank is a very nice host. Thanks Frank!"
909102,7774681,2013-10-02,8254670,Kathy,"A beautiful home with a spectacular view.  The location was excellent also, convenient to local restaurants and bus stops as well as the monorail.  Frank was a charming host and a wealth of information about the area.  Will definitely be back for my next visit to Seattle!"
909102,7992676,2013-10-11,7526245,Linda,"Frank is a congenial host, a world traveler who is also knowledgeable about his own area.  His home is well-placed in the city, with great upstairs views, ready public transport, and immediate access to shops and restaurants in both the upper and lower Queen Anne areas.  The guest bedroom and connecting bath are quiet and situated near the front entrance at street level.   Most on-street parking requires a permit, but there are a few unregulated parking spaces within several blocks. Our four day stay was a good experience and we hope to return sometime soon."
909102,8060752,2013-10-14,1284016,Stacey,"Frank's place was beautiful and in a perfect location for the Seattle Center and lots of restaurant and grocery options.  The room was a beautiful, spacious room with a private bathroom.  The bed is a full-sized bed which is a little challenging for two very tall people like my husband and myself but it was comfortable.  The views of the Space Needle from the living room at night is not to be missed!"
909102,8279645,2013-10-23,2260550,Kelly,"Frank's place was great! We got in late on a Friday night and we had no problems finding his place and getting in. It is a very cozy room with a great rooftop patio (which we enjoyed a couple bottles of wine on). He had some great recommendations for food in the neighborhood which we took him up on. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, but a quick walk down the hill got you to several bars/restaurants. We were able to walk downtown, but it is definitely a hike. However, the transit system will get you there quickly and there's a stop close by. All in all Frank was very accommodating and we had a great stay at his lovely home."
909102,9106805,2013-12-07,9775104,Brian,"Frank offers a very pleasant place to stay, private en suite, easy access from the street and a beautiful view if you venture upstairs.  The only practical limitation is easy (close) on-street parking access given the neighborhood restrictions, but walking the hills is good for you.  Frank is friendly, not intrusive and accommodating, particularly as a delayed flight ensured a later than expected arrival."
909102,10200193,2014-02-05,2960677,Richard,"Frank is a wonderful host, with great communication and respect for his guests."
909102,10306440,2014-02-11,4377637,Vanessa,"We had a great time in Seattle and Frank definitely contributed so much to it. We liked him very much, he was friendly, great conversationalist, and did everything for us to be like in our second home. I strongly recommend consider Bella Vista if you plan to visit Seattle. By the way, beautiful house and awesome views of the city.
Thank you, Frank! "
909102,13216177,2014-05-22,9987950,Kenneth,"The listing was great and the host was great.  The location is very convenient.  Frank is very generous about making his space--all 3 floors--available.  The property itself is gorgeous, expensive, and well-maintained.

It was our first Airbnb experience and we leaned heavily on past reviews, which proved to be right on the money!"
909102,13476612,2014-05-28,2165103,Sue,"Frank was a great host, and has a wonderful condo. It is very spacious, quiet, and has an artsy feel to it. There were lovely views from the top two floors, although not much from the bedroom. It was nice having the adjoining bathroom/shower en suite. Frank was helpful in providing maps and recommendations of places to eat, grocery stores, etc.The hill to get there from the Seattle Center area is steep, but we got in better shape by the end of our stay, and the walk was quite do-able even though we had some joint issues. (Still, might not be the best place for someone to stay who had major physical problems as there are stairs between the bedroom and the kitchen /dining/living areas, as well as the steep hill to get there.)  On the other hand, the view of the lit up space needle at night was spectacular. We went there for the NW Folklife Festival, and appreciated being able to park in front, by paying Frank an extra $5 a night for a parking permit. Cheaper and a lot less hassle  than the parking onsite! 

It was nice to stay there in the secure building, and Frank was a very gracious host. I'd recommend him to others who wish to stay there."
909102,13757586,2014-06-03,11775455,Meredith,Frank was so great! He really helped us with area recommendations and showed us the best ways to get around. His place was spot-on-perfect for where we wanted to be for the weekend. The views from the roof were ridiculous.
909102,13970518,2014-06-09,15086957,Pierre,"Frank is a very kind and thoughtful host! He knows the city very well and is easily available for advise or general chat; I had a great time staying in his place (boasting one of the best view in Seattle, by the way) and chatting with him."
909102,14165994,2014-06-13,16206802,Yihuei,"Bella Vista is a very spacious and (website hidden). There is a 24 hour open big store call “Metropolitan” just within 5 minute walk. The public security, living surrounding, location is perfectly fine.If you want to visit University of Washington like me, there is bus 32 go directly to the university campus. The most important thing is that the host is an excellent person. Frank is such a generous , well-organized, helpful and hospitable host, which let us enjoy the fantastic view from the terrace at anytime, we enjoyed our stay in Bella Vista very much. Thanks for Frank’s open-minded attitude and rich life experience, made our stay is one of the highlights in Seattle."
909102,14468899,2014-06-20,14173603,Carrie,"We had a great time staying at Bella Vista where provided a good environment and location for us to discover more about the city. 
The space Frank provided was more than a privite room. We feel free to roam around the house, we even made our own breakfast just feel like home. The top floor of the house is my favorite , you can embrace the stunning view of the city whenever it's at the daytime or night time. 

6 days stay at Bella Vista brings us lot of beautiful memories. It is totally different than just staying at the hotel, especially Queen Anne hill is such a beautiful& unique place in Seattle, you can spend some time visiting this gorgeous neighborhood and sample something different at Queen Anne Ave.  Two of our favorite restaurants at Queen Anne Ave. (Racha Tai noodles& Toulouse Petit) where takes only 10 minutes walking from Frank's place , it's also worth to try. 

Stay at Bella Vista . Make your trip more than just a city trip. Contact Frank immediately you won't feel regret!!"
909102,14734717,2014-06-25,13525643,Valerie,"Outstanding lower queen Anne neighborhood.  Franks home was absolutely gorgeous, just as described.  Frank wad a great host, allowing many kitchen privileges and very knowledgeable about the area and surrounding areas. House was clean and bed was super comfortable.  Private entry and lower floor was very helpful. "
909102,14967336,2014-06-30,4590965,Barbara,"The description was accurate.  Just minutes walking to Seattle Center.  Definitely uphill coming back - good exercise!   Comfortable mattress on the double bed.  Spacious bathroom with a double sink.  Incredible views of the Space Needle and downtown.  The rooftop terrace is breathtaking.  Close walking distance (more hills!) to more amazing views of the Sound from Queen Anne Hill.  Our host was hospitable, helpful, and his lovely home was inviting. He provided lots of maps and tourist info.  $10 per night for a street parking pass.  Queen Anne is a lovely city within the City - we felt safe walking wherever we went.  Close to restaurants and grocery stores and other Queen Anne shops.  Great value - we would definitely stay there again!"
909102,15109094,2014-07-02,12905061,Karen,Frank was a very gracious and generous host.  The Airbnb was beautiful and the location was wonderful.  We so enjoyed his incredible view of Seattle from his rooftop.  
909102,15185139,2014-07-04,16102805,Kaisha,We loved staying at Frank's house in Seattle. The view from his rooftop patio alone makes this listing fantastic! Our room and private bathroom were both very clean and comfortable. We had no issues checking in or out of Frank's house. Our entire stay in Seattle was pleasant and the experience we got from staying with a local was very worthwhile. We would come back in a heartbeat - if only just to enjoy the views from the patio!
909102,15302970,2014-07-07,12271100,Jane,"Frank was very easy to work with in setting up the reservation, responsive to all questions and provided easy to follow instructions about how to get into the house since he would not be at home when we arrived. During our stay we were always on the go and only briefly crossed paths with Frank. The home is beautifully designed and decorated with charm. The view from the top floor was  a Seattle. We found everything to be very clean. The  sleeping quarters were perfect.  The bed was exceptionally comfy!!!! The neighborhood presents some parking challenges but we were lucky to find something very close and left the car for the rest of the time. Frank did offer parking passes for an additional fee which we declined. It  was easy walking to most anywhere we wanted to explore in the Seattle Center, downtown, waterfront and South Lake Union areas. There was a small hill challenge but we embraced that as all part of the experience. We would definitely stay here again if we were to have a return trip to Seattle."
909102,15490681,2014-07-10,15177432,Amy,Frank was a great host and full of knowledge about the city and surrounding area. His place is beautiful and well situated for exploring the fun neighborhoods of Seattle. His rooftop deck is spectacular with some of the best views of the city. It is a perfect way to end the night - with a bottle of wine and the city skyline. I recommend this place wholeheartedly.
909102,15941405,2014-07-18,751655,Andrea,"Frank's place is beautiful and he was a wonderful host! The neighborhood is quiet, quaint and perfectly located to Seattle Center with amazing views of the city and Puget Sound. Frank was nice to open up his home to us on a last-minute request and we were thrilled to have had the opportunity to stay here!"
909102,16198823,2014-07-23,7511693,Matthew,"Frank was an excellent host. He was kind and very informative, even including a list of excellent restaurants in the nearby area. The view from his place is exactly like the photo you see, and he allows guests to freely move about his home. 

Highly recommended!"
909102,17206242,2014-08-09,12514452,Tracy,Seattle is a wonderful place to vacation! So much to do! Frank was a great host- I wouldn't change a thing'
909102,17367424,2014-08-11,171383,Alice,A mixed bag. I am puzzled about this place -- is it really a youth hostel with additional private rooms that are listed on Airbnb? The bedroom suite was nice enough but noise levels are comparable to that of a hostel. 
909102,17679492,2014-08-16,6181790,Joe,Frank is a very friendly and welcoming host. The accommodations were excellent and the neighborhood was safe and close to all kinds of fun places to see. I highly recommend staying at Frank's if you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle!
909102,17999571,2014-08-20,5083780,George,"Frank is an extraordinary host.  He made it simple for us to come on the day our visit started, and he met us personally.

About the accuracy of his listing:  Very accurate, though the listing couldn't do his home justice:  It was even more lovely than we were expecting.  

The hill on which his home resides affords a gorgeous view of the city:  Just sitting at the dining table you can see from east of the space needle all the way to Puget sound.  Frank was very friendly and particularly generous in helping us with the area.  At the same time, though, he gave us plenty space (never felt ""crowded"").  

Both my wife and I loved the neighborhood! (Makes us want to come see even more! Our 4 days just didn't seem long enough.)   We only seldom needed to use our car:  Near-by public transit and walking were enough.
"
909102,18875893,2014-09-02,4706146,Anne,"We had an excellent experience staying at Bella Vista. When we arrived, Frank took us up on the roof deck, which has an incredible view of Seattle, and pointed out the sights for us and gave us a great recommendation for dinner. The house is beautiful, and you can relax in the kitchen or common area or out on the deck, or enjoy your privacy in the downstairs Airbnb unit. The room is nice with its own bathroom and a comfortable bed and it's quiet. Frank was generally available for friendly conversation or to answer any questions, but he never imposed on us. It's a fun neighborhood, with great proximity to events at Seattle Center and easy access to buses or the monorail."
909102,20227063,2014-09-26,2728303,Niels-Christian,"Outstanding place with a fantastic view and top notch location. Frank is such a wonderful, friendly and helpful host, I cannot praise him enough..."
909102,20445158,2014-09-29,20952406,Pat,"Frank made us feel very welcome.  He allowed us to use the kitchen and living space.  The views from his rooftop terrace were stunning and Frank had no objection to our having our son and his girlfriend up for wine and cheese one afternoon before a Mariners game.  Our room included an en suite, the bedroom was small but comfortable and with run of the house it was more than adequate.  Parking in the area is a little tight (and hilly), we found a space with unlimited parking about 3 blocks away, not a bad walk.  Thankfully we were able to leave our car there for the duration of the stay as our son transported us around.  This is a quiet and upscale neighborhood.  There are restaurants and entertainment in walking distance, buses and cabs are readily available in the area for longer trips like to Safeco Field.  A car is not necessary.    "
909102,22300304,2014-11-03,20568082,Daniel,"Really amazing house. The views are beautiful, and Frank is a very interesting guy. We really enjoyed our stay."
909102,26705454,2015-02-17,15743493,Sean,"Frank's house is very nice and clean. You can definitely feel how much love he put in his house. The room is located in the first floor of the house with private bathroom and close to the entrance door so it is very convenient. The view on the roof is astonishing, even better than Kerry Park which is walking distance. The neighborhood is quite and close to many famous attractions. Definitely recommend this place!  "
909102,28831465,2015-03-30,4145158,Walt,The house is as advertised. The rooms are nice and clean. You have your own toilet. The location is just a 5-minute walk to the space needle/seattle center. Only thing about going back is the uphill walk back but shouldn't be much of a problem esp for the younger and fitter ones. 
909102,28942186,2015-04-01,19971605,Griff,A wonderful host in a gorgeous place
909102,31953228,2015-05-12,8817068,Friederike,We really had a nice stay in Seattle! Frank was present when we arrived even if that was a lot later than planned. He knows a lot about the city's history and told us about it. The view from the rooftop balcony was stunning and being able to go there whenever we wanted was great!!
909102,32272346,2015-05-16,28052697,Dale,"Frank was great host...pointed out a great nearby restaurant...and made the logistics of the household very clear.  The room and bath were terrific.  I was very comfortable there, loved working on the second floor with the great view...and the easy walking access to many of the places I wanted to visit.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
909102,32474321,2015-05-18,2885098,Nancy,"Frank was a wonderful host. His home is very comfortable with great views of the city and very selective and special decor within. 
He is congenial and we enjoyed every conversation we shared with him very much.
He has good advice/recommendations for the Seattle area and many guide books available as well.
His home is close in and easy to access esp. from the Seattle Center.  
We feel very fortunate to have chosen this host and his beautiful home! "
909102,32863062,2015-05-22,24782023,Payam,"Great neighborhood, great place and great host was my experience.
The room was clean, the place was in a great location close to Space Needle and Frank was awesome."
909102,33355821,2015-05-27,11279423,Van," I thought all was great.  Beautiful as advertised.  very wonderful location!!  Very close to Seattle Center and lots of eating places.  Frank was a wealth of info and available anytime.  Comfortable, safe, very beautiful accommodations.  Thank you Frank for your friendly presence as we came in an out several times per day. "
909102,33543326,2015-05-29,12131039,Andrew,"You'd be crazy not to stay here.  Frank was super helpful, accommodating despite our near-midnight arrival time, gave tons of info about places to go and see, and, most important to us, had a nice personal touch.  And the room, kitchen, view, neighborhood are all great.  Very comfortable queen bed, and the bathroom had two sinks, which is nice for couples.  Unless you have health problems, it's walking distance to Space Needle, maybe 10 minutes (which has convenient Monorail to the center of downtown), and maybe 25-30 minutes to Pikes market and piers. Lots of good restaurants around, plus a 24 hour grocery so you can then get stuff and eat breakfast at Frank's.  "
909102,34122378,2015-06-05,29431676,Stefanie,"Frank was an awesome host; very helpful and with lots of advice of things to do in the area and how to get there. This was especially great as I did not completely plan everything I'd like to do in advance. The accomodation is in a great neighbourhood, you can walk everywhere and bus stops are close by. Everything went perfectly.
I enjoyed talking to Frank (even though I was out and about most of the time), as well as the great view from the great room and the rooftop deck. I can only recommend staying there!"
909102,34770042,2015-06-12,3740772,Catherine,"Great location! It’s an easy walk to the monorail for quick access to downtown, and a quick drive to I-5 for longer trips.  The house is beautiful, the deck overlooking the city perfect for an evening glass of wine.  The bed is comfortable, and Frank is a friendly and helpful host with lots of tips on restaurants and nearby attractions. It’s good to remember that you are renting only a room and a private bathroom in his home. This is a good place to stay if you want a home base for a busy Seattle trip. If you have a car with you, Frank offers a street parking pass for $5 a day. "
909102,35368798,2015-06-18,28657869,Ilona,"Frank showed us all around his becautiful home, and took us onto his breathtaking deck with a great view of the Seatttle Cente, downtown Seattle  and the water and  gave us a feel for the area."
909102,35549600,2015-06-20,30501047,Jane,"FABULOUS view !!!  Exactly what the pictures showed on the site.  Frank was great host and we really appreciated and enjoyed his hospitality and the overview of sites in the city and his neighborhood.  The bedroom / bathroom was perfect!  We have been raving about our stay in Seattle through Airbnb and have some friends that will be traveling to Seattle this fall and plan to look into staying with Frank.  Again, Thanks Frank for making our trip to Seattle memorable.  Al and Jane !!
"
909102,35920194,2015-06-23,24040943,Nancy,"Lovely home in a perfect location.  I was in Seattle for a wedding, so very busy with family and I needed a quiet place to rest and rejuvenate.  I was very comfortable and Frank made me feel right at home.  Thanks again for a great stay! "
909102,36138907,2015-06-25,17341659,Judi,"My husband and I spent two nights with Frank.  We had driven past Seattle several times, but wanted to explore the city then head over to Kalaloch Lodge in the Olympic National Forest for a few days. Upon arriving, Frank gave us the tour of his three story home.  The third floor balcony view takes in all of Seattle with beautiful views of Mt. Rainer and the Space Needle.  He gave us tips on what to do, how to get there and where to eat!  His home is lovely and comfortable.  The entry door is on the same floor as the guest quarters.  Would definitely stay again! "
909102,36293647,2015-06-27,33916681,Timothy,"Frank was a wonderful host with a beautiful home to stay in. My wife and I were only passing through Seattle to visit for a couple of nights, and he made us feel very welcome in that short time. It is a quick walk to Seattle center and the monorail. As a first time AirBnb user, I highly recommend staying here!"
909102,37449399,2015-07-07,29647261,Monica,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and visit with Frank; wonderful host, great location and hospitality!!!  Location is walking distance to the Space Needle and monorail to downtown areas.  The main street Frank lives on is uphill for those walking, but we enjoy walking and hiking, so for us it was great exercise walking to  various areas and hot spots.  We put in quite a few miles walking each day.  The view from his home is breathtakingly epic both day and night.  We had a fantastic weekend and came home with great memories!  Thank you, Frank!  We enjoyed getting to know you and hope to see you again!"
909102,37642777,2015-07-09,10944463,Nathan,Bella Vista was exactly as described. Frank has an absolutely gorgeous home with THE quintessential Seattle skyline vista from his roomy and comfy third floor patio. The bedroom suite is on the ground floor which was perfect for dealing with luggage and staying cool in the relatively warm summer weekend that we were in town. Frank is very generous in sharing his wonderful home. This is a great airbnb value! 
909102,38119652,2015-07-13,32610082,Hsu,Frank is a great host! He is friendly and gives us many good advice to tour abound Seattle! His is place is amazing beautiful and extraordinary! I was screaming when I stepped into the living room! The space needle is just in front of you! The view he has is spectacular! The location is also convenience! I think staying at his place is better than stay in 5 stars hotel! Me and my boyfriend love it and will definitely come back to visit again! :) 
909102,38404413,2015-07-15,32999369,Ali,Franks place is very conveniently located 10 mins from the Space Needle and his deck has awesome views of the Needle and the City.  Frank is a Seattle native and was very informative about the city thru out our stay. 
909102,38827506,2015-07-19,29743612,Jose Enrique,"Es difícil describir en pocas líneas todo lo bueno de esta estancia: la casa es preciosa, la habitación grande y muy cómoda, las vistas de la ciudad insuperables... Pero lo mejor es Frank. Estuvo muy pendiente de nosotros para asegurarse de que teníamos todo lo que necesitáramos, pero también para sugerirnos visitar lugares que no hubiéramos conocido de otra forma. Te hace sentir realmente en casa. Ha sido un placer alojarnos en su casa y lo recomendamos a cualquiera que pase por Seattle. Si podemos repetiremos en el futuro sin duda! gracias Frank!!! :)"
909102,39914892,2015-07-27,30979036,Danielle,"This place is as advertised and better. Frank’s home is beautiful and his kitchen is so big, we loved being able to make ourselves breakfast in the morning. If you love to walk, this is a great location for you! It is only a ten minute walk to the space needle and thirty minutes to pike place, we walked everywhere. 

Frank was a great host and is very friendly! He has lived in Seattle for quite some time, so he knows all the good places. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable, we were definitely pleased. Would definitely stay here again in the future. Would highly recommend anyone who is looking for a place to stay, to stay here. We had no problem finding parking during weekdays, once we figured out where we could park. If you don’t want to worry about finding parking, for a minimal fee Frank will providing you with a parking pass that will allow you to park right in front of his place and nearby. 

Thanks again for everything Frank!"
909102,40360538,2015-07-30,37616767,Todd,Frank was very accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. His home and surroundings were clean and just as described online. We will definitely stay again. 
909102,40726316,2015-08-02,5565783,Alison,The view was even better than the photos! Frank welcomed us warmly to his place. The advice we got added some treasures to our trip that we otherwise would have missed. Close to  transport. Comfy bed and good shower. It was pretty hot during our stay but the little fan in the room was enough. A beautiful base from which to explore seattle
909102,41190931,2015-08-05,170597,Karen,"Frank gave us a cordial welcome to his home and to the city, pointing out highlights of Seattle from the third-floor terrace, where we later spent lovely evenings reading and enjoying the spectacular view.  He generously offered us the use of his beautiful kitchen.  We did not have occasion to take him up on his offer but spent three and a half comfortable days in great proximity to the Seattle Center and many good restaurants.   The room was comfortable and very quiet.   Frank was a gracious host and we enjoyed our chats with him."
909102,41958804,2015-08-10,35716885,Vanessa,"Our stay at Bella Vista was ideal. Our host, Frank, gave us a great overview of Seattle, how to get around, and plenty of other tips allowing us to make our stay memorable. We enjoyed the chances we got to interact with Frank, but still felt free to explore with Bella Vista feeling like a home away from home. More than anything, the view from the terrace prompted us to linger with a glass of wine prior to any outing. If ever in Seattle, we would love to be Frank's guests again."
909102,42255831,2015-08-12,1618069,Jacob,Frank's Bella Vista is a little slice of heaven. He is a great host with a wonderful space. Convenient location and beautiful view. Would stay again.
909102,42833646,2015-08-16,31778140,Ben,"Frank's home is even more incredible than the photos. I honestly think it's better quality than any hotel you could stay at in Seattle. Comfortable room with your own fantastic bathroom and TV, and a great living space upstairs where we ate our breakfast under the space needle. Also 5 minutes away from some  great restaurants (Toulosse Petit and The Masonry pizza place were great) and the Seattle Centre which has a lot of great attractions. More importantly though, Frank went out of his way to give us tips and advice on what to do, where to go etc that made planning our days a breeze. Would totally stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks so much Frank!"
909102,43631249,2015-08-21,31038549,Flaulles,Frank is a gentleman and your house is amazing with a wonderful view of the city. We liked so much to stay there. We strong recommend. 
909102,45247654,2015-09-01,32598251,Andy,"We arrived in Seattle on the back some pretty big storms and we had to get to a football match (soccer) by 7pm. We arrived at 6.30 and Franck welcomed us and showed us around his home. He offered lots of ideas on places to go and venues to eat, which was fantastic. The room in his home he has to offer is great and is prefect for staying in Seattle. The house is no more than 10 minute walk from space needle and from there the monorail can take you downtown. We walked back from downtown and even that was only 40 minutes or so. We had a hectic schedule but it was a great time and would stay again. Thanks Franck"
909102,45493272,2015-09-03,24180824,Cristina,"Frank is a great host! He is very friendly, very accurate in the description of the room and extremely open to share his house with you. The house is one of the best we have ever seen, with a great view of the skyline of Seattle, and everything is as same as you can see in the pictures. The neighbourhood is very quiet and safely, and just some minute walk you will find what you need for breakfast, lunch, dinner and drink a beer. No more than 15-20 minutes quiet walk from the Seattle space needle. When I will come again to Seattle, of course I will come here: this actually is your house far from your house."
909102,45655775,2015-09-05,31525045,Tom,"Frank is wonderfully thoughtful and met us upon our arrival.  Bella Vista is wonderful, well cared for and in a great section of the city with an awesome patio deck view.  Thanks Frank "
909102,45996932,2015-09-07,21343050,Nora,Frank was a fantastic host! He was very helpful and really made our first airbnb experience really great. His house is beautiful and the area around the house is perfect for people who have never been to Seattle. We had a lot of fun and we would love to stay with him again!
909102,46261421,2015-09-09,26815111,Teresa,"A fabulous place to stay. Frank provided great information and advise both before and during my visit, he was great at accommodating my early arrival. This is a beautiful home with an amazing roof terrace. A short walk to Space Needle, monorail and some great restaurants. You will not be disappointed it is even better I real life. Thank for a great stay Frank."
909102,46488548,2015-09-11,15223192,Amy,"Spectacular view! We loved our stay at Frank's place. We were close to everything, and Frank gave us some great tips on where to go. He also told us about a very scenic route to take to Vancouver. Everything about our stay in Seattle was great! Thank you, Frank!"
909102,47027272,2015-09-15,2728303,Niels-Christian,It was an absolute pleasure staying with Frank again. His house is just great and perfectly located and Frank is a wonderful and engaging host. We had an absolute blast and are proud to call Frank our friend.
909102,48096795,2015-09-23,42107656,Tim,We had a fantastic time during our stay in Frank's house. Everything was very clean and of course the view from the rooftop was impressive. Thanks to his great suggestions for sightseeing we got a very good impression of Seattle. 
909102,48329537,2015-09-25,43780859,Kan,"Frank and his Bella Vista provided us a wonderful experience of accommodation at Seattle when we used airbnb first time.

We can easily enjoy the panorama at livingrom and terrace, just like what we had read in the description. Downtown skysrapers with landmark space neddle,peaceful Elloit bay... you can never find such a place to possess them perfectly. How we wish we can spend 25 hours a day watching them.

Frank, a wise  and thoughtful host, gave us many advice about our stay in Seattle. Our pleasant talk let us known more about local life than other travel ways. This is such a amazing experience.

I look forward to staying in the beautiful home again next time."
909102,48984025,2015-09-30,32507427,Garry,"Thank you for wonderful hospitality Frank.  We met on arrival and you provided information on the area for attractions, dining and transportation which was all very helpful.  The location was perfect.  You shared your home with us not only as a bed, but the roof top views of the city and watching the total eclipse of the moon.  Our discussion about travel in Europe will be of great value.  Thank you Frank."
909102,49432703,2015-10-04,37155662,Susan,"Frank made us feel right at home, the sleeping area is very private.  "
909102,50067894,2015-10-09,32418213,Cristina,Frank was very welcoming and accommodating for our stay.  The usage of the common areas of the condo and outdoor balcony were amazing and a real showcase of the city!  The room was very clean and size was comfortable for 1-2 people.
909102,50746979,2015-10-14,5335413,Kimla,"Staying at Bella Vista was wonderful.  Frank made us feel so welcome, and was a great source of information about the city.  His home is warm and absolutely lovely.  So convenient to the city center area.  Beds were comfortable and it was easy to come and go.  It was so fun to share a home with such a knowledgeable and welcome host.  "
909102,51608061,2015-10-22,38444222,James,"Yes, Frank greeted us at the front gate and was very friendly and welcoming, despite the fact that we arrived 90 minutes esrly."
909102,52433682,2015-10-29,46130899,Cole,Frank's location is very good. Within walking distance to everything. Our stay was perfect and the room was everything that we needed. I would definitely recommend.
909102,53612326,2015-11-10,45668421,Ashley,"Frank was an excellent host! It was our first time using Airbnb and we could not have had a better experience. Although he was busy and we did not get a chance to meet him, he always responded or returned our calls in a timely manner whenever we had a question. Frank even allowed us to leave our luggage in his home after check out so that we could more easily enjoy our last day in Seattle. Frank's home is beautiful and clean, with beautiful views of the space needle and city. We will definitely look into staying at his home again next time we visit Seattle! "
909102,55391203,2015-12-01,27805682,Janet,"He met us at the entrance and carried a bag then showed us around the entire place.  We did get a chance to talk a few times but we were visiting our daughter so spent most of the time with them.  The room was comfortable with it's own bathroom and some space for putting out and hanging our clothes.  We had a key to the house for the time we were there.  If one wants the best view of the Seattle Center and some of the Bay, this is the place. Our room didn't have the view but the upstairs was available any time we wanted it."
9318524,54493803,2015-11-20,7653075,Will,"Jocelyn's listing was great!  The space was clean and comfortable and located in a safe neighborhood.  Lots of things were walkable from there as well.  Plus, the view from the roof was breathtaking.  I highly recommend this listing!"
4364285,23344864,2014-11-29,15780972,Kemuel,"Natalie has an awesome place in Seattle!  My friends and I were on a road trip, we stayed at her location for couple of days, it was a really   Good time, her place is just like the pictures! It's very comfortable, I would stay there again if ever in Seattle!  Her location is pretty good, I got to everything really fast!  "
4364285,24510423,2014-12-29,25117251,Stephanie,"The neighborhood was great, there wasn't any noise during the night and it was very calm. The place is cozy and comfortable. I slept in it like it was my own place and was very happy upon arrival and departure."
4364285,40996285,2015-08-03,39069970,Brian,"Natalie's place was clean and had everything we needed for our stay.  Street parking was easy to find (both nights we were able to park right in front of the town home).  She was attentive to answer all questions and provide information we needed.  Washer and dryer came in handy for the activities that we did during the days.  There isn't A/C in the house, and we happened to be visiting when it was very hot.  There was a fan that really helped cool down the living room in the evenings, in fact, we slept in the living room because the airflow was much better than the upstairs bedrooms.

The neighborhood was safe and they seem to have friendly neighbors immediately across and next to them.  One even knocked on the door because they had thought we left our trunk open on our car.  I have to admit that it may have been a ""rougher"" part of town, but that's not saying much as Seattle seems to be safe city.  Very close to a Safeway grocery store.  It's a short drive to the city."
4364285,42434921,2015-08-13,26216462,Eli & Efrat,"We had great time at Natalie's place. Tha house was clean, spacious and comfortable with lots of storage place. The kitchen had all that we could think of. There was always parking nearby on the street and the neighbours were friendly and quiet
It does tend to get a bit warm during the summer evenings so we used to open all windows to get a breeze.
Everything was close by with the car (Airport, downtown, west seattle). Thanks. Natalie!  "
4364285,49218702,2015-10-02,39467878,Deborah,"We loved staying in this townhouse in Columbia City. The kitchen was well-equipped, which was important for us. Everything was clean and neat. Natalie was helpful both before our move-in and during our stay there. Short walk to some great restaurants (La Medusa, Geraldine's, Tutta Bella) and a fabulous bakery, which became our morning hangout. Even her neighbors helped us out, bing us overflow vegetables from their gardens! Also loved biking/walking to Lake Washington and Seward Park. Perfect location. "
4364285,53891723,2015-11-14,31673084,Debra,"Natalie was a very good host! The home was very nice, clean, easy, parking good, and close to stores! Very nice experience."
4364285,56545372,2015-12-14,7120671,Paul,Modern townhouse with on street parking closeby. Great to be able to take our dog. Location was convenient to freeway and city.  Plenty of room for the 3 of us. We had a couple of small issues which Natalie responded to promptly. 
7934356,43886788,2015-08-22,4934023,Travis,"My teammate and I made a quick over night trip to Seattle for an outrigger canoe race on Lake Washington.  Fortunately, Jenny's pad was still available when I got around to looking.  The location was 5 minutes from the race site, up on a hill in a quiet neighborhood, and Jenny was quick to accept my request.
The daylight basement 2 bedroom apartment was quite larger than what we needed but we appreciated looking out into the garden and being able to look down over the city below.
The apartment had just been finished the day we arrived and Jenny hadn't had time to stock it with pots and pans but she had put in the basics. Jenny asked if we needed some pots or pans because she said she would get them. I said I would just use the microwave but then realized that there wasn't one so I said a pot would work fine but when we returned from our outing Jenny had brought us a microwave for my breakfast.
As you can see, Jenny is a great host and the large apartment was great.
Thanks, Jenny!

Travis"
7934356,44385369,2015-08-25,24761042,Britain,Jenny is very kind and helpful. She wait us until 8pm in the first day. We had a happy holiday in her place.
7934356,45009467,2015-08-30,42125514,Mary,Host was welcoming. The accommodations were simple. The location was great
4777832,24252612,2014-12-23,24380126,Andrea,"Josh was an A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. host! So kind, respectful, & PROFESSIONAL. I had ""unique"" arrival and departure times- and Josh and his spouse were very accommodating and understanding. Their place was clean, cozy, and very warm. :) Due to the hot water pipes above their place, it made their studio a comfortable 73° ....so don't let the pictures fool you. I was comfortable in shorts during the dead of winter! So nice! With the thick walls and ceiling- it was very very quiet. Also I felt very safe in his neighborhood, with lots of parking too which is a plus! I would totally stay there again- and recommend his place to all my family and friends! Thanks again Josh!!"
4777832,24499031,2014-12-29,18694534,Alex,Josh (and family) and the loft were amazing!  They made their home very available to us and were well organized and prompt.  The loft is gorgeous and just a short drive from downtown.  The neighborhood was clean and quiet.  Street parking was a bit tight but available.  Thanks for making us feel at home Josh!
4777832,24899505,2015-01-03,12402598,Jennifer Jordan,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this space! The pictures make it look incredible, but upon first entry I was even more blown away by the attention to detail, natural light + woodwork (the tables are gorgeous). It is definitely industrial chic (which I love), but it also feels cozy. So if the industrial vibe isn't your usual -- I think you'll still adore this space. If you love to cook, the kitchen has every amenity you're looking for + SO much counter space to work from. The bathroom is spacious + the bed is cozy. Josh has left plenty of room for guest's to unpack, from a full closet/drawer setup to a full closet in the bathroom. Their guestbook of instructions made it easy to access the lightning-fast WIFI + figure out the rest of the place/building. Even without meeting them upon arrival, I felt comfortable and welcome in their home. For those visiting Seattle, another great perk is the location. You're just close enough to the city for easy bus access + inexpensive Uber/cab, but tucked away so that it's quiet. Minutes from downtown, I would highly recommend the loft to friends visiting Seattle for a weekend or more. It would also make a great spot for hosting a meeting, dinner party or girls weekend. Thanks Josh! "
4777832,25614051,2015-01-20,672985,Morgan,"We absolutely loved this space!  You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the design of the loft - it has a lot of character and a lot of style which made it such a fun place to wake up in in the morning, and come back to in the evening.  Josh was great too - very helpful, thoughtful, and responsive.  

The neighborhood is transitional, but the block the loft is on is really cute, and we went for walks (around the neighborhood, and also from the loft to downtown) and always felt safe.

We really had a fantastic weekend, and would love to come back and stay again soon!"
4777832,26119636,2015-02-03,323625,Amira,"Josh's place was amazing and more than you can ask for.  It was a great get away for me and my 3 best friends, a home away from home. It was spacious clean and close to the heart of Seattle. From the beginning to the end of my stay everything was simple to find (location, keys, extra pillows, etc), as you entered the apartment he had a property guide that explained everything I needed to know. If I had any questions he was very prompt in responses and always there to help. I couldn't have asked for a better host!! I definitely would book again in the future! Thanks Josh! "
4777832,26272430,2015-02-08,228678,Katie,"I never met Josh in person, but he was very friendly, warm, and accommodating in our communication through Airbnb. Their place is really fantastic -- I held my 30th birthday party there and the loft was a total hit -- a lot of space, very cool, great location. Getting the key was easy, and the fresh flowers were such a nice touch. Highly recommended. Thank you for being a part of making my celebration so wonderful!"
4777832,26371095,2015-02-10,1094944,Sara,"My girlfriends and I absolutely loved this place. Beautifully done, well stocked, comfortable and warm. The location was convenient and parking was just fine. I thought the value was A+. This is the kind of place that is exactly why I love air B&B! Thank you for being so easy to communicate with and generous with your lovely space :)"
4777832,26611917,2015-02-16,16112586,Nicole,Best air b&b experience I've had yet! Josh was a wonderful host. Communication was great. The space was perfect for our group of 4. We would absolutely stay again! 
4777832,26689178,2015-02-17,12713,Rovaira,Josh's place is amazing!  I hosted a birthday dinner there and everyone loved the spot.  Communication with Josh was super easy.  His property guide binder has all the info you'd need.  The neighborhood is convenient (street parking was easy).  I'd definitely recommend his place to folks visiting Seattle.
4777832,27002795,2015-02-23,23319366,Think,"We spent a weekend and Josh's amazing industrial loft, and it was truly wonderful - exactly like on the pictures if not, more beautiful. The kitchen was well equipped, the bed is super comfortable and the neighborhood is very quiet and close to the highway. Josh was very easy to communicate with and fast in respond. Would recommend this place for sure, and hope will have the chance to go back to Josh's place again in the future. 

Thank you Josh!

(Street parking available) "
4777832,27335514,2015-03-02,26761231,Chiara,"Our stay at Josh's house was super! it was exactly as described, very very clean, with all  amenities for guests. We really enjoyed our time and would recommend to everyone!  "
4777832,28024173,2015-03-16,9152134,Nathan,This space was perfect. The description matches the offering exactly. We felt comfortable using it. It is a trendy space in a trendy part of town. We used it for a small get together and it was a big hit.
4777832,28386035,2015-03-23,24981113,Shirley,"We used Josh's space for a 12 person dinner party and it was perfect! He made sure we had enough plates, utensils, glassware and even left fresh flowers for us. His responses were quick. I would recommend this location in a heartbeat, whether for a small party venue or overnight stays."
4777832,28794114,2015-03-30,25367615,Eric,"The place was great! We stayed there for a weekend and Josh made sure we were well taken care of.  We were flying into Seattle late so he offered to set up the pull out couch and provide beer for us.  What more could you ask for?  The loft has a great feel to it, we wish we had a place like that back at home.  Josh was very attentive and was flexible with our travel needs...I would recommend this place to anyone!"
4777832,29832734,2015-04-13,10113023,Will,"Josh was a great host, everything was beautifully curated. Something worth clarifying is that this is a studio and as such is a wide open floor plan, so if you expect privacy you will get none. But if you enjoy the company you are with this can be a lot of fun, as was our experience. Good location, fun space, good experience."
4777832,31173085,2015-05-03,19308093,Patrick,"Josh and his family have an awesome spot. It was an excellent location for our post-marriage dinner with our large family (25 people). Josh let us come check it out twice beforehand to help plan ahead. It felt intimate and elegant. They were very helpful, asking if we needed anything in terms of setting up or providing serving utensils. This space would also be an excellent place to stay in Seattle -- pretty good location, and very comfortable home base. It is truly an excellent spot."
4777832,33304015,2015-05-26,26705870,Mark,"Fantastic apartment in a convenient location in Seattle. Josh's attention to detail is impressive - the whole space is cozy enough for 2 and open enough for a big family dinner. Comfortable and stylish, the hardwood tables and concrete floors are beautiful. And the lighting is extremely nice. Great for a romantic getaway or family gathering. Josh was an excellent host, attentive and the house manual explained everything. One of my very favorite Airbnb's - would love to stay there again!"
4777832,33798243,2015-06-01,11787711,Tim,"It's with great pleasure that I get to write a review about Josh and his Home. Josh is an excellent host with great communication who has clearly thought everything out and is one step ahead. All information and help was provided upfront, and again supported in an organized binder that he left behind for us. It not only included information about the Loft Space, but information on local happenings, the area, and recommendations of local spots that we wouldn't normally have known about. He was also very generous in allowing us to use some spices and household things, allowing it to feel like a home away from home. The space itself is very impressive in design and in personal touch. Everything you could want, and more. The location is excellent as well, making for very quick commutes to the unique neighbourhood, or to Downtown. The neighbourhood is very safe and everyone we encountered around the area were friendly and helpful.

We had an awesome time here and are eagerly looking forward to returning to Seattle and staying with Josh again. 

Thanks!!"
4777832,34424550,2015-06-08,24458265,Jessica,What a great experience!  Josh was communicative and provided multiple ways for me to contact him if I had any questions.  The space is lovely and so functional.  I would absolutely stay there again and recommend Josh and his home to others.  
4777832,34980223,2015-06-14,21974793,Jesse,"Very nice place, as advertised. Josh has a cool, comfortable home that is clean and welcoming. Thanks for a wonderful stay"
4777832,35109383,2015-06-15,12923876,Lee,"We loved our night at Josh's loft.  The space was wonderful, just as described.  It was a great place to host a graduation dinner and the bed was super comfy.  It is tucked away on a quiet street but still pretty central in busy and growing- fast Seattle.  We had no problems finding the spot and getting in.  We hope to be able to stay again the next time we are in Seattle!"
4777832,35779109,2015-06-22,19533853,Gary,"Josh was a great host, the flat is really lovely and the entire experience could not have been better!"
4777832,36167446,2015-06-26,19723906,Naomi,"This was a brilliant stay - Josh and Piper provided everything we could ask for, including local brewery recommendations, and the kitchen was well stocked with items we were welcome to use. Well located, if a short walk to the nearest tourist attractions. Would definitely recommend their beautiful flat!"
4777832,37282197,2015-07-06,23004308,Dan,Loved the loft! We had four people in our party and it was nice to have plenty to come back to after a day of exploring Seattle and the local area. Only complaint was that Josh couldn't control the warm weather ;). Would highly recommend the loft and would stay again if we come back to the area. 
4777832,39146775,2015-07-21,28127146,Brian,"We wanted a reasonably authentic Seattle experience for our one night in the city, and we got it -- our mistake.  The words and pictures described the place well, and it was clean and impressive -- almost a ""Portlandia"" episode without the irony.  But it was incredibly hot in July, with no A/C and no ventilation; it helped a little (as the owners suggested) to open the garage door in front, but not much, and we certainly weren't going to leave it open all night.  The only bed suitable for adults was way in the dark, stuffy back of the place on top of some shelves (or some such), and it did not feel at all stable (although I should add that I am not a small person by most people's standards, about 6'4"" and 240 lbs. or so).  The shower was also a challenge, with a complicated multi-liner set-up that required (as near as I could tell) the user to set shampoo and soap on the sink *outside* the liners, making it important to line up the overlaps so that you don't have to step out to get to your implements.  

Fortunately, with all of these on-site challenges, I can say that Josh was quick to respond to my messages, and he and his spouse left a whole notebook of explanations and information for guests.  As hosts, they earn high marks, even if we ended up not enjoying their place.

Bottom line: know what you're getting here.  If you want a Seattle urban hipster experience to tell your friends and family about or perhaps to feel like you never left college (but have a lot more spending money to furnish your living place than most of us did as hungry student-types), then this place (with many clever touches and accoutrements) might well charm you.  But we also wanted a place to relax during our one night in the city (we were there for a concert at Key Arena), and it was simply too hot and stuffy (bearing in mind that we were there in the middle of summer) for these more mundane purposes.  (We ended up trying to sleep on the the convertible sofa, with all four fans in the place trained on us -- still with little luck.)"
4777832,39902938,2015-07-27,3360556,Dan,Josh did everything before our stay to ensure we were all set - he even allowed us to sleep more people in the flat than the listing states after I let him know I had friends who were having a horrible time finding anything in Seattle due to the number of events going on. Everything was awesome and the place is amazing. I wish we had more time to spend there!
4777832,40074157,2015-07-28,10577595,Brittany,We had an absolutely wonderful experience staying at this loft. My bridal party and I got ready there the morning of my wedding and it had everything we needed to make a lovely breakfast and relax. It was also incredibly gorgeous and made for some great pictures. Thank you for being so accommodating and providing a wonderful and flexible space!
4777832,40708910,2015-08-02,27555308,Tiffany,I was pleasantly surprised. The pictures were good but it was even better in person. We had extra guests and Josh already had the air mattresses blown up. Josh has an amazing space he is allowing people to borrow. And Josh himself is such a nice person. We were there for a Bachelorette party and it was the perfect space. Walking distance to many different places or a short uber ride.
4777832,41540381,2015-08-07,40244175,Eric,"Josh's loft was awesome! Perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle from across the country. Located on a beautiful, quiet street just a quick car ride from everything we wanted to see while there. The place was super clean and comfortable with a nice information binder revealing the quirks and secrets of maximizing your stay (read: wifi password). Wish we had more time to use the kitchen, it was beautiful. All in all, a great first experience with Airbnb!"
4777832,42506219,2015-08-14,13804251,Stefan,"We likes the Loft very much, the mix of furniture, the fully equiped kitchen, the possibility to drive downtown for a few bugs - all like we hoped it would be. However in this hot summer it's a little hard to cool down the room for a ralexed sleep, you have to roll up the door an use the many fans, but it works if you don't need less than 18 degrees Celsius. 
If you need any help, recommendation or have questions, Josh always answers your E-Mail very quick and is a real top host!
We would stay there again! "
4777832,43604143,2015-08-21,5492133,Christie,"This place was exactly how it was described, so beautifully decorated and spacious.  It was initially super hot and stuffy when we arrived,  due to being closed up for the day during a heat wave,  but once we got some fans going and opened the awesome overhead door,  it cooled off right away and was never too hot,  even when we were using the stove.  Lots of space for kids to play too and the hide-bed was huge and super comfy.  Josh was excellent at communicating with us,  his house guide was very good too.  Very well stocked with everything you might need too.  We would definitely stay here again!  Thanks Josh!"
4777832,45451647,2015-09-02,5784000,Kristin,"Josh's place was amazing and far exceeded my expectations. Everything was immaculately clean, and there were lots of unexpected little extras (ice cream in the freezer for me!) The space itself is beautiful and stocked with pretty much anything you might possibly need. The loft was so wonderful that I didn't even want to go out and explore - I just wanted to stay home and enjoy it. 

Josh himself was an excellent host as well. Great communication, really easygoing, answered all of my questions immediately. 

The neighborhood is fun as well and is in a great location for accessing both different Seattle neighborhoods. There's a fantastic coffee shop just down the street, and an superb climbing gym a two-minute walk away. 

I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
4777832,45582015,2015-09-04,206203,Amanda,"Josh's place was great-very clean, comfortable, and provided an unusual experience.  The kitchen is easy to work in and has everything you would need to cook a great meal. It is uniquely furnished with beautiful wood tables and several comfortable hang out spaces. The garage door wall is very cool. Josh was very responsive to questions and check-in and -out were easy. Parking can be challenging at certain times of the day. It could use a window that could be securely left open at night and I think Josh is working on that. I highly recommend this place and plan to stay here again in a few weeks, and again if I can get in! "
4777832,46174430,2015-09-08,41091016,Jessica,"There were sheets and an extra air mattress ready which was great, we brought our own bedding, but a nice thought.  The neighborhood is a little sketch on the backside of the lofts, but there are a lot of neighbors that keep an eye on the place.  Very cool street with a cafe and art gallery in the building.  We loved the industrial but cozy look of the loft!"
4777832,46327764,2015-09-09,29475254,Karlea,"Amaaazing place! I don't even know where to start. 

The loft was beyond spacious with the 4 of us.  And it was spotless when we arrived. I noticed there were back to back check ins/outs and was a little nervous, but everything was clean to the T! We found parking right in front almost every time we left and came back. The neighborhood/street felt safe. 
Location was perfect. Driving and ubering was fast and inexpensive. I loved how close it is to China town, about 7 minutes. 

Overall, the place is going to be a place you'll rave about for a long time! Everything Josh has to offer from roller blades, to a filled pantry, to games, to the open garage makes the place very comfortable and entertaining.  you will leave beyond satisfied :)"
4777832,46431355,2015-09-10,32493110,Andreas,"Although we did not meet Josh in person, we had a very easy Check In despite our late arrival at 11 pm only. Also, email communication was very nice and quick. The place itself is just marvellous. As the pictures show, it is a beautiful designed industrial loft. Neighborhood is good and the place seems very safe. We forgot a bag in the apartment but Josh was happy to send it to us. Highly recommended stay!"
4777832,46526496,2015-09-11,35925255,Annabelle,"Josh was very helpful in making our stay as pleasant as possible. He was available to answer questions upon arrival, and also left a binder of information about the loft. The loft itself was beautiful. I wish it was my own apartment. It's a super cool place in a super cool town. "
4777832,46600388,2015-09-12,10058602,Melanie,"The loft was great and exactly as pictured- the space is a quick/easy uber from downtown, which was super convenient. Josh was communicative and kind- all around a great experience."
4777832,46833188,2015-09-13,29296715,Nan,"Open and welcoming, the loft worked out great for us while in Seattle!   Josh responded quickly every time, which I appreciated as we had a lot of last-minute changes in our schedule.  The loft was easy to find, the parking worked out great.  Lots of games, books and toys - for young and old.  We loved it!  And oh, the beautiful, gorgeous tables!  A perfect kitchen to sit and have a relaxing morning cup of coffee and plan your day.   I highly recommend staying here if you like a unique, fresh  space that's right in the heart of things."
4777832,46888248,2015-09-14,24998592,Kaye,"We had a great time at the loft! It's such a fantastic space and our hosts were so generous and accommodating. The loft itself is beautiful and has so much personality, we can't wait to book another stay! "
4777832,47168092,2015-09-16,40429216,Riley,"Phenomenal space. Great access by car to the rest of the city, and there were also a few conveninently located restaurants/coffee shops within walking distance. We look forward to staying again next time we are in Seattle. Thanks Josh!"
4777832,47296616,2015-09-17,26026181,Sophie,"We spent a great night at Josh's place! It was beautiful, with every convenience you could possibly need. We really appreciated touches such as board games and toiletries in the bathroom. The only 'down side' was that the bed itself was a little difficult to get onto, but once on it was really comfortable."
4777832,47479463,2015-09-19,206203,Amanda,"This was my second stay at Josh's Huge Industrial Place and I again really enjoyed the spaciousness, comfort, great kitchen, friendly host, easy coordination, and it is wonderfully clean. It is something different and a lot of fun."
4777832,47680672,2015-09-21,20477098,Kate,"The industrial loft was wonderful and just as the listing describes. We had 4 adults and comfortably slept 2 on the sofa bed and 2 on the lofted bed. The space was well equipped with linens and other necessities. We had a wonderful evening with the garage door open and enjoying the late september warmth with a glass of wine. The location is a little far from where we spent most of our day (Freemont, Ballard). However, the surrounding street provides a great cafe and other necessities. Josh provided us with an OUTSTANDING itinerary for our trip and we had a great 36 hours in Seattle!! We would love to come back. "
4777832,47979954,2015-09-22,2829241,Jamie Marie,"Gosh this place was the greatest! It's centrally located, but more so, absolutely charming. Josh has put every possible thought into the home, and we loved every bit of it. The decor is outstanding with impeccable design sense, and had every amenity we could've wanted. 

Definitely worth a visit to Seattle just to stay here!"
4777832,48786245,2015-09-28,44015906,Paulina,"Amazing place, the most comfortable bed ever, and great location! It was a wonderful experience staying at Josh's place, he was extremely on top of communication, made us feel very welcome, had all the amenities I could ever want including a fully stocked kitchen which lead allowed us to throw together some delicious homemade pizzas! The space and decor is super trendy & fun, I felt like a true Seattle hipster, it was great! I'd live there year round if I could. Also, the area seemed very safe and was conveniently located!"
4777832,49140889,2015-10-01,13354540,Lars,"We had a great stay at Josh's Apartment. It was very spacious, clean, and the thoughtfully put together interior made it feel like home. In fact we spent most of our time in seattle there. Wish we could've stayed there longer! Communication was hassle free, and we got loads of great suggestions from the host. "
4777832,49619076,2015-10-05,36454716,Casey,"The loft was awesome, easy to find and the location was great. Super clean and organized which made everything super easy!"
4777832,49900772,2015-10-07,22005897,William,"Josh gave us everything we needed during our stay and the loft was beautiful.  Fully equipped is an understatement and the loft was convenient, with a quick walk or cab, to everything in the city."
4777832,50203352,2015-10-10,2492537,Aubrey,Josh was a wonderful host and his place was amazing! Just as great as it looks in the photos. The location was great also! It wasn't too far of a drive from any of the main sites in Seattle. The street was nice and quiet with plenty of street parking. I would recommend this place to anybody. I sure would stay here again next time I'm in town. 
4777832,50331817,2015-10-11,44207625,Marsha,"What a great place to stay! I wish we would have been able to stay longer. My daughter really enjoyed the plethora of toys and art supplies! That made the stay that much better. Everything you need and more. Parking was fairly easy on the street in front of the loft. The area was cute with a nice Vietnamese restaurant near by. We did take out and ate at the loft. With the garage door open and a lovely glass of wine it was wonderful! Thank you, Josh!"
4777832,50648576,2015-10-13,16429569,Chelsea,"The space was just as it was pictured and even bigger than I expected! The check in process was smooth and easy and convenient since I got in from working in Portland around 1:30am. The welcome packet was very helpful and they even left candy on the table for us. Everything was very clean and there were ample outlets. 
I am a photographer and used the space to sleep and and do photo shoots at, and it worked out perfectly. I was able to find parking quite easily on the street and anyone that couldn't find it super close by, didn't have to walk very far. 
The location was about 10-15 min drive from everything.
The neighborhood was friendly, and we even had a nice police officer offer his spot in front of the loft to my friend who was looking for a spot to park after picking up food, and waited for me to call her and have her come around to snag it. That blew my mind, since in California, cops aren't nearly as helpful. 
They offer their food in cabinet and refrigerator to you if you'd like it.. We didn't take advantage of that sweet gesture but I feel like that showed a lot. The bathroom was stocked with amenities, towels, toilet paper, and a hair dryer. 
There is no TV, but we didn't need one. They did have speakers set up though, which we used for music. 
There is minimal noise from the hot water pipes that run through the loft that make it so you can hear when others use water, however it wasn't a bother to us. All in all it was a great experience, and I highly recommend this place! "
4777832,50879536,2015-10-15,45431453,Stephanie,"We loved staying at this loft during our short stay in Seattle. It's a great location not far from the downtown area and the space itself was absolutely gorgeous. We really enjoyed the decor, especially the handmade tables, which were beautiful. Josh was an excellent host as the space was very welcoming with a great guestbook that was helpful and inviting. We would recommend staying at this place to anyone. Thanks, Josh! "
4777832,51123160,2015-10-18,40688915,Shelley,"This loft is amazing! The design inside is great, very artistic yet very homey! The space is very open and the kitchen well equipped! I love that they kept growlers at the loft so you can try some of Seattle's craft beer- I thought that was a great idea for guests staying a new city! I spent a majority of my stay in Seattle making a wedding cake for a friend who was getting married and I couldn't have found a better kitchen to use!  The loft location was ideal, it did not take us longer than 10 minutes to get to a destination driving. I would highly recommend this loft to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
4777832,51291410,2015-10-19,1610342,Nina,"Easy check in process. Simple. Great suggestions of what to do in area. We were in a great location so used Lyft to schedule a ride to and from a concert. 
Loft itself was amazing. Amazing. Fans everywhere, great place for photography. Beautiful artwork. Just really cool place. Clean and everything was easy to use/figure out. Could see why it gets warm in summer but with fans it was cool and perfect. 
Highly recommend. "
4777832,51499283,2015-10-20,13645965,Michal,I had a great stay at Josh's loft.
4777832,51619009,2015-10-22,7304320,Michele,Josh's loft was a great and well decorated place! There was extra toiletries for anything you may have forgotten and games for entertainment. The neighborhood is quiet and parking is easy to find. Overall a great place to stay!
4777832,51727969,2015-10-24,7384946,McKenzie,"Wow! What a space. The loft is SUPER cool; we felt cool just being there! 

Josh was great to work with; it was easy setting up the stay as well as accessing the space. There was even candy on the tabling waiting for us. Hip hip, hooray for chocolate! "
4777832,52064996,2015-10-26,42917442,Matt,"Josh made us feel very welcome. We were easily able to get into the house even with our late arrival and the place was clean, and perfectly as advertised. The loft was incredibly fun, we had our friends over for a little pre-wedding hang outs and everyone was enamored by the details of the loft. 

It is one of the most fun places I've stayed and it made me feel like a kid building forts. "
4777832,52339781,2015-10-28,17917393,Leah,"My husband and I stayed at the loft for my birthday and our only regret was not extending our stay for a couple more nights. Josh proved to be an excellent host and responded to our e-mail messages immediately.  Needless to say, the loft is gorgeous and offered the comforts of home. We will be back. "
4777832,52439554,2015-10-29,20415235,Stephanie,My family and I had a great stay.  It was very kid friendly and clean. I love how this space is decorated. Josh is really easy to communicate with and there were no problems. Fantastic all around!
4777832,52876756,2015-11-02,5782550,Cheryl,"This space is absolutely perfect for a small party. It really is beautifully put together.  Everything was exactly as described and Josh was a great host. He was easy-going and responsive. 
I may never host at home again."
4777832,53510696,2015-11-09,43227438,Anna,"If this loft is open during your Seattle stay, do not hesitate to take it. The place is delightfully decorated, and the owners are incredibly hospitable (they had candy available and allowed us to raid the food storage and refrigerator!!). You will undoubtedly feel at home. It's just a great place."
4777832,53646850,2015-11-10,47785231,Sue,"We definitely enjoyed our stay at the Industrial Loft and would return again. Josh was incredibly accommodating answering many questions prior to our visit and provided a number of great suggestions for places to go in the surrounding area. Thanks again Josh, you were a great host!"
4777832,53773233,2015-11-12,20331625,Vera,"The loft was absoutely stunning - the photos are very accurate, but it still surpassed my expectations. Josh was a communicative, flexible, and all around stellar host. 

This place is a gem and I couldn't speak highly enough for my time there!"
4777832,53822549,2015-11-13,44714902,Grace,"We loved this place! It had literally everything you could need. Josh was a great host and check in/out was quick and easy. 
Location was convenient.
We will definitely be coming back "
4777832,53991413,2015-11-15,11817782,Collin,Josh was a great host and made himself available for us to ask any questions we had! We loved our stay at his loft!
4777832,54151606,2015-11-16,6522446,Chloe,"5 stars all the way. If only all Airbnb's were this gorgeous! A unique place with a fantastic vibe. Top class furnishings and everything felt really high quality. Josh is a lovely friendly face to arrive to who could provide us with all our needs.

Can't fault you - wonderful!! Suffice to say I hope I come back."
4777832,54258704,2015-11-17,9143708,Drew,"Came down to Seattle to attend the Seahawks game from Vancouver — this was a perfect place to stay. Tastefully decorated and well-appointed, it's a great space that suited our needs. Josh was prompt in his communication and everything was as it was said to be. "
4777832,54634041,2015-11-22,39060964,Josh,"Josh gave great recommendations prior to my arrival. The space was huge indeed, and the collection of eclectic pieces was inspiring. My favorite was the pantry, a repurposed meal buggy next to the stove in the kitchen. "
4777832,55208717,2015-11-29,1221138,Karina,"Host was very communicative through the Air BnB system before and during the visit - though we never met them personally (fine with us) there was a sense that they were available for questions/communication. The place is beautiful, very very clean and in a central location. We had a great time staying here and as Seattle natives who were visiting from out of state we were able to host a Thanksgiving meal for our family in the large room with lots of seating. It was a magical evening and everyone enjoyed being in the unique space. We loved staying here and recommend it highly! "
4777832,55443713,2015-12-01,25706005,Monisha,"I had my 30th birthday party at Josh's loft and it was PERFECT! It was the perfect size for a small gathering, and it was so great to have all the amenities of a house versus just an event space. My friends were so impressed with the loft, and like the idea of hosting a small party at a place like this. The loft itself is thoughtfully designed with amazing details that gives it a funky, eclectic city vibe, but also has charm to make it feel comfortable and homey. Josh was great to work with as well - he was very responsive and accommodating, and generally a nice person who cared that my event went well and we had fun."
4777832,55902720,2015-12-07,39772519,Kylie,"Josh’s studio was beautiful. It’s clear that a lot of care and attention has been paid in setting it out. The kitchen was huge and incredibly well appointed, full of food, drink, and staples that minimized the shopping we needed to do. It slept the three of us comfortably which was great to come back to after a long day of sight-seeing. It was very close to coffee shops and a very regular bus to downtown which made it great for us to get to where we wanted to go. 
On a side note, the closest laundromat is 15-20 minutes away by bus, so be prepared and plan for that.  
All in all, Josh was a fantastic host, very accommodating and quick to respond to any questions we had and we'd have no hesitations in recommending this place to anyone :)"
4777832,56207263,2015-12-10,44301273,Dani,This loft is awesome! Great decor and anything you'd ever need. 
4777832,56505428,2015-12-14,33460960,Ross,Super awesome place and Josh made the experience really easy and smooth. Will definitely stay here again.
4777832,56738906,2015-12-17,47490098,Mitch And Morgen,This space was amazing !  Highly recommended .  
4777832,56883549,2015-12-19,595557,Shannon,"What a wonderful space.  From start to finish this was a perfect experience.  Josh and his family have a beautiful artistically  decorated, yet functional and comfortable home described perfectly.  The neighborhood is quiet and conveniently located.  Communication was clear and easy.  I was so happy with their lovely home that I booked another stay for next month before this visit was even over.  I recommend this live work loft for anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle that is clean, comfortable, spacious, unique and easily accessed.  Thank you Josh and family for the opportunity to experience your loft."
4777832,57014016,2015-12-21,40296500,Sarah,"Our experience was great! Josh gave us all the information we would need upon arrival, including a message before hand about how to get in and a great packet with all the details we would need to make our stay comfortable. The space is beautiful and was perfect for hosting a small gathering of friends."
4777832,57299234,2015-12-24,44303260,Patrick,Everything was Perfect :) 
4777832,57765045,2015-12-29,35656590,Lisa,"Lovely property- truly unique and fun to experience!
Josh was the perfect host- helped us out with an unexpected 'power-outage' on Christmas Eve, which was most appreciated.
Not far from downtown Seattle- easy to get to.
Many thanks, Josh and Family for sharing your loft with us!

9924107,57946851,2015-12-30,468844,Gannon,"Great place! Clean and cozy, close to tons of great stuff on Capitol Hill. Mackenzie was friendly and helpful. Would gladly stay here again on future visits. "
9924107,58405631,2016-01-02,32530632,Yeji,"Mackenzie was lovely! She was very quick to respond with any questions I had. Didn't have a chance to meet her personally but was greeted with a nice note, wine, and some snacks! She gave all these great recommendations for restaurants and activities to do. Would definitely stay at her place again if I came back to Seattle. The room was very clean and comfortable. Location is pretty good too. Walkable distance (10-15 min) to cafes, restaurants,etc."
6913414,47981726,2015-09-22,40116036,Heather,"Jenna was very responsive to all my questions and my family really loved how cute a cottage it was for our stay. The neighborhood was very walkable (several options for groceries/coffee available within 10 minutes), and we had no problems with parking at all during the entire stay. We'd definitely consider staying again the next time we visit! :)"
6913414,48883475,2015-09-29,21762050,Richard,Fast and accurate communication from the start. Very responsive and even gave a great coffee gift certificate due to some construction (no problem since we ubered everywhere). Safe and clean neighborhood. House was very clean and a pleasure to stay in. Highly highly recommend.
6913414,49666432,2015-10-05,43861982,Melinda,Beautiful well designed home to stay with my husband and our two young children. We loved the well thought-out layout of this little cottage. My husband is a contractor and was impressed by the details and work that was done there. The unit was really clean and well-stocked with all the needs for cooking and cleaning for our family. The location was great with a small market near-by and coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. We also used the public metro system with ease. We would definitely stay in this unit again and recommend it to others. 
6913414,51838601,2015-10-24,159909,Wiki,"Very nice cottage in a nice neighborhood in Seattle. The place is small, but super charming and well decorated. Downside is both rooms are separated by a sliding door so you don't have a lot of privacy."
6913414,52124163,2015-10-26,45604188,Becki,"We had a great experience staying at the property. It was clean well designed and felt like home. The beds and furniture were very comfortable. The kitchen was beautiful. The neighborhood was safe, close to a grocery store, coffee shop and easy to get to the highway. 
We will be using the space again. Our host Jenna responded immediately when we had questions prior to our stay."
6913414,52762506,2015-11-01,24903493,Suzanne,"The Cottage was absolutely delightful! It was better than the photos. The construction, the flooring, bedding, the fixtures - top of the line and it was super clean. Jenna was easy to contact and very responsive. And great care was made to make the space cozy and inviting through small details . I would highly recommend this place!!"
6913414,54782501,2015-11-23,33668471,Robert,"What a delightful, cozy cottage. Thoughtfully designed and well appointed, the photos accurately show you what to expect. It's located in a terrific neighborhood near the University with a great local coffee shop at the end of the block. I hope we have the opportunity to stay at the cottage again in the near future."
6913414,54946785,2015-11-25,29823552,Ben,"We had such a delightful time in this charming and beautiful little cottage a stone's throw from the U District, UW campus and bus lines to downtown. The interior design was so well thought through and executed, especially the radiant floor heating.  We felt like were staying in a Pottery Barn catalog.  We were blown away!"
6913414,55362229,2015-12-01,13109232,Leith,"
Jenna, thanks for letting us use your place. It was perfect for us.  It was so nicely decorated, clean and solid; and so it was great to come home to.  

We loved the privacy and quiet.

Thanks"
6913414,57174795,2015-12-22,8202342,Aram,"I loved this beautiful cottage.  Jenna did a wonderful job with the decor and design (industrial meets cottage).
The unit was clean and had everything that we needed to cook and make us feel at home.
The best part was the location.  It's literally in one of the best neighborhoods in UDistrict.  It's close to UW, Cohen Park, Buses, Ravenna and I5."
6716380,35611335,2015-06-20,5343304,Patrick,"I stayed in Jay's beautiful home with a buddy of mine for a long weekend to attend the U.S. Open. The location was prime! Walkable to all the action in Capitol Hill and Chuck's Hop Shop(an awesome beer place!)He provided some water bottles in the refrigerator and after asking brought down some pots and pans to cook. He was available when needed and communicated very well, particularly when I was first attempting to book his place. His family, who lived upstairs, was very sweet.  The space seemed like a mother-in-law kinda of setup. Jay was able to provide many useful tips and recommendations and the guidebook was helpful. The bathroom was clean with towels and all the amenities. He also allowed me to have a late checkout which was extra nice. The coolest part was the lock system. He invited me to use an app August that used Bluetooth technology for the lock. All I had to do was walk up to the door, wait for it to recognize the lock, push the unlock button on my phone and magic, the door unlocked!The space had a private entrance and parking which both were great. I highly recommend anyone staying here!"
6716380,38081084,2015-07-12,30318057,Brian,Perfect location and jay was great in helping us feel welcome and at home. The location is incredible and the space was perfect for my wife and I and our three kids. Thanks for making our stay in a Seattle extra great.
6716380,39318646,2015-07-22,11551631,Stephanie,Jay and his family were very accommodating and the location is just perfect for anything that you will want to do in/near Seattle. He and his family left for a long weekend while we were there and made sure that we had everything we needed before leaving us there. The accommodations were nice and he listened to our concern of not having windows that open (we are from the South East and love windows open during nice weather.) Jay was sure that we had fans for our comfort. He also made available to us his outdoor grill and seating area. Having an off street parking spot is a great advantage!!
6716380,39547467,2015-07-24,3406345,Jenny,"Jay's home was exactly as described. My friend and I were looking for spacious, comfortable and clean accommodations for a 2-night stay in Seattle. The area, as advertised, is extremely convenient via bus and car. While it was off major roads, you don't get the traffic that you would expect from a major road. The street that it is located on is extremely tight so driveway parking was super helpful. At the time of our stay (late-July 2015), there was construction going on next door. The one negative about the stay was that it was not mentioned in the listing. It looked like full construction was going on and a new home was being erected so mornings would get loud if you are a light sleeper. That said, the neighborhood itself was safe and quaint. I was able to go out for a run and walk both mornings who no worries.  

As a host, Jay was great! He responded quickly to emails and messages. He lives above the rental and came by after our very late arrival to check-in on us and make sure everything was OK. The keyless entry system through the August phone app is awesome & really alleviated any concerns about losing a key and whatnot. Overall, a great stay and highly recommend it for a wonderful space in a safe, convenient neighborhood and great host! "
6716380,39791875,2015-07-26,8205298,Matt,"Jay was a great host even though we unfortunately didn't meet. The unit is clean,  comfortable and provides everything you need. It's also in a nice little neighborhood of Seattle. Highly recommend staying here, I suspect I will be back."
6716380,42420006,2015-08-13,28884049,Jeff,"The whole experience was great. Jay was kind and welcoming. He also went out of his way to accommodate me. The unit was clean and spacious, and very comfortable. I couldn't have been happier with my stay."
6716380,42788937,2015-08-15,37534054,Uğur Mert,"Jay was very kind and helpful towards us. If i come to Seattle again, i'll definitely choose his house. He has good recommendations about the city so you dont need to worry about your vacation"
6716380,43313867,2015-08-18,28447615,Kevin,"The home was very welcoming and comfortable. It felt as if we were at home our self. The location is very convenient to every places. Followed Jay's advice, we left our car on the driveway and used ubers to go many tourist attractions. We had a great weekend trip in Seattle.  "
6716380,43993572,2015-08-23,35464540,Jennifer,Great location with easy access to downtown Seattle. The apartment was very spacious and the two bedrooms were perfect for our trip. Wonderful hosts! 
6716380,45126201,2015-08-31,36363046,Kevin,Everything was as it should be. Like the neighborhood.
6766708,35508342,2015-06-19,10218518,Cory,We have worked with Eve a few times now and she’s great! Nice place and location. We would definitely recommend.

6766708,41486709,2015-08-07,1809814,Ted,"Had a great stay with Morgan and Eve - the hosts were very responsive, and the apartment was beautiful, and in a good location. Plan to stay again next time I'm in town."
6812054,36821327,2015-07-01,2294171,Ro,"I recently relocated to Seattle and needed a place to stay for a week while my new place was being set up. That's how I found Amanda's posting and instantly loved it. Staying at Amanda's was the closest thing to being home away from home, especially if you've just moved to a new unknown city. To say her apartment was great would be an understatement and I'm almost tempted to not give away too much because I wouldn't want to share something so charming and cute with everyone. But that's not very nice and would defeat the purpose of this, so here it goes-- The apartment is conveniently located in Capitol Hill and close to everything the neighborhood has to offer. It was clean, comfortable and in fact cozy, filled with tasteful artwork all around, books and houseplants. The place matches the pictures, including Rhonda's, who is a lot more affable in person. The apartment comes with a semi-private deck, washer/dryer unit in the basement and other amenities one needs in a city apartment. I didn't get a chance to meet Amanda or Ben, however they were thoughtful to leave all the information I needed to know and had also arranged for their friend to let me into the place, who was friendly and helpful when I had any questions. I even had a drink with some of her friends/neighbors on the deck and they were a lot of fun. Amanda was a great host and was kind enough to make some excellent bar & restaurant recommendations in and around the neighborhood and checked in on me periodically. All in all this is a great spot for a short visit or a longer stay, take it without any hesitation. You'll love it!  "
6812054,38661179,2015-07-17,11406393,Alvin,"Amanda was very responsive throughout the entire booking process and stay at her apartment. Although I did not get to meet her, the check-in process was simple and her place was just as described in the pictures. The apartment was clean and very spacious. 

The location was excellent, short walk to all the Capitol Hill restaurants and bars. Absolutely loved the area and would definitely stay in the neighborhood again. "
6812054,38927896,2015-07-19,37839439,Jessica,"Our stay at Amanda's place was wonderful, and we felt right at home from the moment we arrived.  We loved the artsy feel of the apartment, and everything was clean and comfortable.  Amanda was great with communicating and helping us.  And you can't beat the location.  We were within two minutes of nearly everything we needed, coffee, yoga, groceries, dinner and more."
6812054,42339892,2015-08-12,40429091,Jeff,"Great host, nice place, very comfortable and conveniently located, tons of things to do. The decor was fantastic, I felt like home. I'd book it again and highly recommend to others."

We left a couple things at the house and Jenny was kind enough to send them our way. 

Great host and we'd definitely stay there again! "
6451305,35329194,2015-06-17,34479856,David,Jenny was great and provided us all the information we needed to easily access her house.  The house was awesome!  Very clean and in a great neighborhood with quick access to many of Seattle's attractions.  The beds were comfy and there was  a nice big couch and big screen tv in the living room for those times when you just want to sit down and relax.   I would definitely stay here again.

6451305,36563688,2015-06-29,33930306,Taylor,"Jenny was a wonderful host from start to finish! She was informative about the neighbourhood, the place was immaculately kept, it felt like staying in a hotel! If anyone is planning on using an AirBNB in Seattle, come to this place! Wonderful place to stay, I will definitely be back!"
6451305,36814860,2015-07-01,35828267,Jessica,"My family and I had stayed at Jenny's townhouse. It was our first time going through Airbnb, at first we were a bit skeptical but I'm glad we had stayed at Jenny's place for our first experience! It was so lovely and Jenny was so quick to respond to any of our questions and concerns. We would definitely stay there again!"
6451305,37075757,2015-07-04,32975892,Jeff,"Great clean, modern unit.  We enjoyed the convenient, walkable location.  "

Jenny is a great host with great communications. Walking distance to the bus and great restaurants. Perfect location in Seattle, nice neighborhood. Highly recommend this rental!"
6451305,39192551,2015-07-21,35883200,Rebecca,"The space is as beautiful (if not more so) as the pictures depict.  There was plenty of space to spread out and relax after days of traipsing all over Seattle.   

The location is as advertised, we were able to easily walk to Molly Moon's and the farmer's market on Sunday morning as well as being a slightly more strenuous walk to the waterfront (the return trip is almost exclusively uphill).

The kitchen is well-appointed, anything you need to eat in, which we did for several meals (breakfast and lunch).  

The garage was a perfect fit for the compact car we rented for our long weekend in Seattle and it was such a nice feature to have off-street parking included.  

Jenny was very communicative and responsive, a perfect host.  Because we have family in Seattle and a new addition to our branch there, we started joking that this would be our ""West Coast Home.""  If we are able, this will be our Seattle landing pad for the foreseeable future.

6451305,40101937,2015-07-28,33668258,Andrea,"This was an awesome neighbourhood, walking distance to almost everywhere we wanted to go and a short bus ride anywhere else. At the end of our trip it was starting to feel like home! A beautiful and modern condo with the main living area on a different level from the bedrooms. It was the perfect size for 5-6 people. We would definitely stay here again!"
6451305,41353746,2015-08-07,20031744,Alex,"Jenny's place was the perfect for my family to stay on our vacation! We had plenty of room for the 5 of us to cook dinner and relax after a long day of sightseeing and exploring the area. The townhouse was clean and comfortable, and had a great patio to enjoy the nice weather we had while there. And it definitely was a great place for walking, the neighborhood has plenty of awesome bars and restaurants, and we close enough to walk all the way downtown. The garage parking was also great for all this walking, we didn't have to worry about moving our car!

Jenny was often in contact and always available if any issues came up, but everything was already in place and we didn't have any issues. We would definitely stay again if back in Seattle!"
6451305,42410549,2015-08-13,36983878,Kurt,Very gracious host. Fabulous 3 story home. Pictures very accurate description of the home. My kids loved the surrounding. I even left some small items at the place when I checked out and Jenny offered to mail back! Jenny super helpful in offering advise on local eateries. Only thing of note is that the garage space is very small (won't fit anything more than a small compact car so I have to park my midsize sedan on the streets). Would definitely stay again.
6451305,43050050,2015-08-17,10490385,Austin,"My experience in Seattle was amazing! I couldn't have stayed in a more perfect place. The house has all the essentials (toiletries, towels, soap, shampoo, etc..) and anytime I had a question Jenny was very prompt to answer. Beautiful layout, only about a 15 minute walk to the famous Pike Place Market. I had an amazing experience staying in this home in Seattle, I would definitely staying here to anybody that asks. Thank you so much!
Austin Taylor "
6451305,46124976,2015-09-08,31212169,Jennifer,"Jenny's house was a wonderful, clean, comfortable space in a terrific neighborhood! I highly recommend staying here!"
6451305,46537612,2015-09-11,33792790,Yi,nice and clean houes. my parents they r enjoying this house
6451305,47158123,2015-09-16,12588517,Kevin,"Jenny communicated well, and made our time in her well appointed space, wonderful.  The location is great - parking can be a pain if you have a minivan or more than small SUV.  We had six in our group and the space worked well.

If we were returning to Seattle, I would do this space again - without hesitation"
6451305,47668336,2015-09-21,38971125,Allison,"This was a fantastic home in a perfect location!  It was perfect for our family of 6, and Jenny even provided toys and a pack and play for my nephew (which he loved!).  It is just as described and Jenny was very responsive, when needed.  The only minor drawback is the garage only fits a very compact car, so we ended up parking on the street.  You are walking distance from many delicious places to eat and drink - we loved Skillet for brunch - and Seattle U is a nice, quiet area to wander.  Highly recommend!  "
6451305,49613016,2015-10-05,39258950,Starr,Jenny could not have been nicer or more welcoming. She made me and my whole team feel like locals in Seattle. We even had to ship 18 boxes to this address and she made it so easy. I am looking forward to staying here again next year. 
6451305,50207318,2015-10-10,27105845,DONALD (Deke),"This was an excellent and convenient experience. The house is exactly as it looks and as described. It's right down the street from a bunch of hip restaurants and bars. A great location. I would say that parking can be fairly challenging in this zone as it is right next to a college, but that was a very minor inconvenience. Thanks again!"
6451305,50843477,2015-10-15,1238433,Michael,"Jenny's house was nearly ideal for our family of four, plus my brother who stayed with us.  The bedrooms are spacious and the home comes well equipped with many amenities.

The neighborhood is eminently walkable while staying very quiet and residential; it's located one block off a major thoroughfare, with coffee shops, bars, and restaurants less than a five minute walk away.

Jenny was always available, and coordinate a very smooth check-in.  The parking accomodated our full size car (barely!), and after pulling the car into the garage once or twice, it was easy enough.

All in all, a wonderful stay and we would gladly stay again on future trips to Seattle."
6451305,51446582,2015-10-20,42838504,Michael,"What a beautiful, easily accessible and safe accommodation. When we arrived we couldn't believe how modern and well-appointed the unit was. A short walk to downtown. Close to Trader Joes (the best grocery store). It was perfect for myself and four other friends. Jenny was great to. Always quick to respond, provide suggestions and then just let us enjoy our weekend. Would highly recommend. "
6451305,51734909,2015-10-24,10439763,John,"Grt location, but the house needs some TLC! Carpet was dirty, sinks slow, walls need paint. Otherwise we all loved our stay. "
6451305,52899122,2015-11-02,12990306,Drew,"Jenny was very responsive from the first interaction. She provided all necessary information in a timely fashion and was very kind in all conversations. The house was just as described, perfect for our group of 4, could have easily accommodated 6 when using the ground floor bedroom. Great location in Capitol Hill to restaurants and bars. Thanks Jenny! "
6451305,53968649,2015-11-15,17830186,Johannes,"everything was perfect, Jenny was very accommodating and quick to reply - the space was exactly as described and was easy to walk to and from downtown.

we couldn't have picked a better place.
highly recommended!"
6451305,56052185,2015-12-08,6573609,Michaela,"This place was great! We really loved the electric fireplace, all the amenities; dishes, blow drier, condiments, dishwasher, and great linens. Also, our son loved the box of toys, especially the musical guitar. The place was within walking distance of restaurants and a playground. We were just a few minutes from a great shopping and eating area, and probably a 20-30 min walk on a sunny day.
The only challenges we had was getting our small SUV in the garage. It is def a small space, and the heater in the kids bedroom was out, but it turned out that the upstairs stayed pretty warm at night without it..also the stirs were a bit slick, maybe some grips are warranted. 
Overall we loved it. Was cozy and perfect. We'd definitely stay here again."
6451305,56847790,2015-12-19,46196245,Larissa,We had a great trip in Seattle and we all love your house! It's amazing and comfortable! 
3811828,17327491,2014-08-10,7404602,Bridget,"Host was very nice and the place has a great view in a great neighborhood. The only two downsides were that there are many more people than there are toilets and the house can be creaky and loud if you are a light sleeper. If you want privacy, and to sleep in late, I recommend finding something else but if you want a cheap place to stay right downtown with the chance to meet some cool people and have a great view of lake Washington, then this is your place!"
3811828,18749469,2014-08-31,19986584,Lucien,Great location and hassle free stay! 
3811828,18997202,2014-09-04,19756288,Nico,"This is the first time I tried out Airbnb, and it worked out pretty well! My initial interaction with the host, Leah, was very cordial. Though it says in the listing that the host is Michael Toomim, I had no interaction with him whatsoever, so I'm not exactly sure what role he plays (landlord?). Leah was very nice and willing to help out with the booking process; ask any questions via Airbnb's messaging system and she will be happy to supply you with info before you head to your destination. Leah was also quick to give tips on the Metro system, but do your own research as well because it turns out that there is a more direct route from Seatac airport to Cap Hill/Montlake than what she recommended. Leah also works around the clock, so its best to text her (though I had the chance to talk to her on the phone as a courtesy call that I'm arriving).
The Cap Hill/Montlake property is a great place to stay if you're new to Seattle. Very nice, quiet, safe neighborhood. You are surrounded by trees, and the nightlife/downtown/University Disctrict is close enough for a bus/bike ride. The house is also very spacious and there are lots of rooms/hallways/stairs that you can get lost if you're not careful. Some of the private rooms have their own bathrooms, but I rented the shared room (which has 4 bunk beds--8 people at full capacity). For everyone without a private bathroom (majority of the guests), there's the unfinished WC (toilet only) and the only full bathroom where 5-8 people share. It can be a crazy affair when it comes to bathroom use, especially during Labor Day weekend when 11 of us were residing in one house.
That aside, the property is very hospitable--it's a home away from home, with new roommates every so often. I liked that Leah was accommodating to guests' feedback (especially bathroom woes), and overall maintenance needs of the house (the listing mentions most of it, so ask questions!). This property seems like a new addition to their Airbnb portfolio, so there will be things that are work-in-process. Read the listing carefully and judge for yourself if any unfinished maintenance work is a deal breaker. I had no problems with it since it doesn't interfere with my experience.
The best part of my stay in Cap Hill/Montlake is meeting new people! There are guests that stay for long term, and some for a day or two. All of them interesting folks. I'd definitely go stay here again when I'm in town :)

I'm rating it a 4 considering the price and the value I got for the price. I'm low maintenance, and I saw what I expected/what was described."
3811828,19500476,2014-09-13,16668459,Shu,"This is one of my best Airbnb experience ever. A giant house in Capital Hill with forest, lake & sunshine outside of the big window. And you meet so many cool people with the very welcoming and sweet host. "
3811828,20054055,2014-09-22,21170965,Nathan,"Beautiful neighborhood, great place to stay. Very convenient bus to downtown. The house is very comfortable and spacious. The hosts were so helpful with answering questions. I would definitely stay again ."
3811828,21602243,2014-10-20,20979105,William,"i stayed at the crayola house for about a month and i had a great time there. looking forward to coming back soon actually. the view when you come in is amazing. the house was colorful and people were warm and very hospitable.  they were very open to suggestions on house improvements and attentive to individual needs. for instance, allowing me access to a bike until i could get my own and letting me use a u-lock to keep it safe. they made a good effort to make the place feel more like a home, hosting potlucks and going out as a group for dinner and drinks. it really made the experience great and sparked a nice house camaraderie. especially since I am new to the area, this meant a lot to me and provided me with my first friends in the area. I highly recommend and am looking forward to stay with them again."
3811828,22804531,2014-11-15,22997966,Haitham,"It is a nice house, clean and organized, I was lucky to meet a lot of good friends which make me feel good . I will always be my first choice anytime I have to stay in Seattle. "
3811828,23877129,2014-12-13,7693924,Drew,"Awesome place, awesome people!  The crayola house is delightful.  It's also in a super convenient location for downtown or the east side or university district.  "
3811828,26288640,2015-02-08,2661846,Bradley,Excellent instructions for how to access the home and how to feel comfortable. Good location and great views of Lake Washington.
3811828,28679552,2015-03-28,7693924,Drew,Excellent as always!  
3811828,29475370,2015-04-07,30606091,Victor,"Excellent directions and instructions upon arrival.  Warm welcome with additional help from host, Jon, and other guests.   This is an excellent Seattle neighborhood, safe and walkable with the convenience of bus service and shopping nearby."
3811828,30335086,2015-04-20,25280683,Whitney,"Leah was really easy to communicate with. The neighborhood is gorgeous and right next to an excellent Arboretum. The house was remarkably clean considering how many people are staying there. Everyone was really respectful of others' personal space and just really nice all around. I didn't spend a ton of time around the house, but when I was there, I felt really welcome and had some awesome conversations with the people I met there. "
3811828,32655329,2015-05-19,33368541,Justin,Listing was accurate.  Host was welcoming.  Residential location in a nice neighborhood.  Couple snorers in the shared room but overall good experience.  Enjoyed the lockbox with key and study area with solid internet.  Comfy bed.
3811828,37465509,2015-07-07,29710417,Ashley,"Michael gave me a tour upon arriving and the space looked as described. It was in a convenient location next to a lot of cute shops and coffee spots. A lot of other people stay in this residence, some short term and some long term, so being respectful of everyone's space is key. People were sleeping at all times of the day in my shared room, so I had to be very quiet and conscious when getting something or dressing/undressing. Very welcoming housemates too."
3811828,38216910,2015-07-13,37313469,Andrew,Beautiful house and a very helpful host. Would definitely like to stay here again if I'm in the area!
3811828,39210945,2015-07-21,37281821,Kimberly,"Great place to stay, amazing view. A little hot when the weather is warm. Guest are pleasant and understanding to personal space. The rooms are organized and neat. Lots of guide boards to help guest find their way. Enjoyed my stay very much. "
3811828,43655501,2015-08-21,36841159,Irene,"Crayola House is one of a kind! I spent there three weeks and I really enjoyed my stay. The house is huge, everything is clean and well organized even if there's a lot of people. Leah is always ready to answer your questions with quick email response. It's a really nice way to experience Seattle! Totally recommended"
3811828,45391297,2015-09-02,11711985,Phillip,"pretty close to bus stop to go somewhere, good chance to mingle with other guys from different countries."
3811828,52855434,2015-11-02,15150824,Peter,Great value! The people are all friendly and very welcoming. It's easy to get downtown and there are nearby coffee shops and a library. If I ever need a place to stay I will definitely be back here. 
668169,2185862,2012-09-03,3249408,Lena,"Great experience. Charming house. Beautiful neighborhood (5 Min walk to Green Lake Park, perfect running track (5km)). Very friendly, helpful hosts. Very flexible regarding arrival and departure. Any questions were answered within minutes. Perfect  home for exploring Seattle. "
668169,4510569,2013-05-09,4563960,Acasia,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Nathan's. Nathan is a great host - very responsive and positive. The house is located in a quiet and pleasant neighborhood and the room/area we stayed in was clean and spacious.  I would definitely return and encourage others to stay here. 
Thanks for a positive experience!"
668169,5029880,2013-06-08,1142416,Charles,Had a lovely stay at Nathan's place in Wallingford/Greenlake. The room is super cute with a nice view of his backyard and a comfortable bed for two. Parking was easy and it's a short walk to lots of bars and restaurants. Nathan took extra care of us with some free concert tickets. Would definitely stay here again.
668169,5365860,2013-06-26,5131016,Daniel,"Nathan's place is a great getaway. Wonderfully quiet, the upstairs room is cozy with a great view of the back yard. Nathan and his housemates are respectful yet ready to chat you up offering suggestions about where to go, what to eat etc.  The location can't be beat!  Wallingford is beautiful and has a host of things to keep you occupied and a short trip to both Capitol Hill and Ballard for further adventures.  Highly recommend staying here!"
668169,5476862,2013-07-01,3800542,Lynn,"My sister and I loved our stay here! Nathan was extremely kind, responsive, and went out of his way to make us feel at home. Always had excellent suggestions. His housemates were equally welcoming, funny, and great to talk with, too. The neighborhood is gorgeous, safe, walkable, and with some excellent coffee nearby! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a scenic, peaceful stop in Seattle."
668169,5535213,2013-07-04,7043372,Shenoa,"My husband and I very much enjoyed our stay at Nathan's place near Greenlake. It's a very relaxing place and just as calm and low key as his listing indicates.

Coming from a place where everyone gets in a car to go somewhere, I adored being able to walk to the lake and great nearby dining. It a really great neighborhood with plenty of street parking so you can leave your car and go on foot.

Small thing to future guests: the large room is upstairs and gets quite warm during the day with heat waves. It cooled off during the later part of our stay and was quite nice the rest of the time."
668169,5796973,2013-07-16,3794068,Heather,"I had a great time staying at Nathan's House.
The room was large clean and well kept. It was my first airbnb experience and I am a fan!"
668169,6496899,2013-08-14,2910052,Eric,"The location of this house can't be beat.  If you're looking for a place near the city but not in the city with easy access to different neighborhoods, beautiful places to walk and near a few convenient and charming bars and restaurants this place is a great option.  Its a shared space with a shared bathroom but the host and housemates are very friendly and accommodating making it a great place to stay for our short trip to Seattle. "
668169,6571297,2013-08-17,7845150,Erin,"Nathan was a good host - we didn't see him or his roommates much, but Nathan was always available for questions, etc. It's a nice house, and the neighborhood is great. We loved walking to Zoka and Mighty- O as well as 45th. I ran to and around Greenlake and just wish I had time to do it again! We propped the fan in the window, and the heat was quickly dissipated, and we actually got cold. I'd recommend their place!"
668169,6824039,2013-08-26,7883430,Joey,"Amazing home just north of downtown- very quiet, safe and clean. The best part was the lovely lake and coffee shops right down the street! Also very friendly and super helpful housemates. I will definitely be staying here again when in Seattle. "
668169,7016772,2013-09-03,7738172,Emily,"We had a fantastic stay at Nathan's house! The room was perfect for my 2 friends and myself as we explored Seattle for 6 days. The neighborhood was very convenient to all things Seattle. Nathan was very helpful and welcoming once we arrived providing insight into the area and recommendations for restaurants and places to go. I highly recommend Nathan's home if you are looking for a comfortable, homey place to stay while visiting the area!"
668169,7145684,2013-09-08,7837820,Joan,"Nathan was a very gracious, caring host. He was responsive by text to one hiccup upon a late evening arrival and to a sound issue (I'm totally noise sensitive) as soon as I made it known to him. Socially, Nathan made me feel welcome, too. We had a couple of nice chats.

Why a 3? I saw other reviewers found it a quiet place in the evening. I must have hit a strange patch. There were a few issues for me that others didn't experience. (See above, I'm super noise sensitive.) If not for that, I would have given it 4 stars."
668169,42423023,2015-08-13,9106772,Jess,"Nathan's place was in a lovely neighbourhood with character and close to Greenlake and some good places to eat. The room was spacious. Nathan is a great host who communicates well with guests - I arrived while he was away and he had left great information.
Thanks!"
668169,42951667,2015-08-16,7259228,Imke,We had a perfect stay at nathans place.  The house is lovely and Nathan was really helpful and nice.  Our room was clean and had everything we needed.  We can definitely recommend this place for a Seattle visit!
668169,43841802,2015-08-22,5340931,Dan,"I had a great week-long stay at Nathan's place. Nathan and his housemates welcomed me into their house and made me feel right at home... This is exactly what airbnb is all about! The location is great a short walk to greenlake and a lot of cafes, restaurants, and bets. There are also a few easy public options for downtown access if you need it. I definitely recommend Nathan's if it's available for your visit!"
668169,44359224,2015-08-25,27026294,Neva,"Great place to stay!! Nathan and his housemates were really friendly, helpful and gave great advice for a first time traveler to Seattle/USA. The room was clean,comfortable and quiet. Close to some great local restaurants, the supermarket, pharmacy and really easy to get down town. Also really close to green lake, a beautiful place to go and exercise in the mornings or take a walk. Loved it and would recommend to anyone visiting the area."
7536074,39721859,2015-07-25,38094557,Billy & Lindsey,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6993019,39984322,2015-07-27,37038055,Yaron,"We had a great time staying at Jeff's place.
The apartment is located in the best location in Seattle, 1 min walk from every major attraction. 
Jeff was very attentive to every request that we had ensuring that we have everything we need to make our stay as pleasant as possible.

"
6993019,41790726,2015-08-09,15382608,Cadm,"This is a great apartment with some pretty spectacular views across Puget Sound. Access from/to the airport is also very easy via the light rail system.

It is spacious and well equipped and right by all of the bars and restaurants in the Pike Place Market area. Downtown attractions are mostly walkable and the monorail to the Seattle Center / Space Needle is just a couple of block away.

Jeff is a fantastic host as well, he met me to give me the full tour of the apartment as well as the many facilities available in the building and throughout the process was a great communicator responding very promptly to any and all queries. He is also a fantastic source of local knowledge having lived in Seattle all of his life! 
"
2980762,16132643,2014-07-22,17528015,Megan,Lovely time in Kim's home! She was very hospitable and made sure I had the information I needed for a great stay. Her home and neighborhood were very quiet and restful.
2980762,16192250,2014-07-22,16623822,Ross,"Kim was a great host. The bedroom and bathroom were both clean and well kept. Her pets are both very relaxed and calm. She was very flexible in her schedule for when I arrived and left. 

Look in the neighborhood for Awash to get some yummy Ethiopian food. "
2980762,16369023,2014-07-26,17974296,Trevor,"Kim was a really great host, and the room and bed were good. Kim was helpful in giving us advice on places to visit, and she is a really good communicator in terms of how to get in/out, time of arrival, do's/dont's in the house, etc. The private bathroom and bedroom were both clean and supplied with things like kleenex, TP, towels, shampoo/conditioner/soap, and ample bedding/pillows. The room is indeed down some steep steps, but not a problem for most people. We would definitely stay with Kim again in the future."
2980762,16527695,2014-07-28,3874966,Risha,Kim was really accommodating. She gave us restaurant recommendations and was in touch to coordinate giving us a key on arrival. The room (with double-bed) and adjacent bathroom was very clean and tastefully decorated. Kim even gave us a lift to the bus stop on our way back. The house was about 30 minutes out of the city centre but there is a strip of cute restaurants which are about a 15 minute walk away and a bus that is fairly frequent. 
2980762,16596756,2014-07-29,2831964,Quito,"I would absolutely recommend Kim's place to others, she was considerate and easy going.  The room was clean and had all the conveniences of home!"
2980762,17374401,2014-08-11,1874470,Julie,"Kim has her hosting act well together, especially for a relative newcomer to AirBnB. Her space is exactly as described, it's thoughtfully organized for travelers and she has the type of chill personality that makes for a good ""innkeeper."" It's got a good location for SE Seattle, halfway between beautiful Seward Park and the hip Columbia City neighborhood. Her dog Olive is still getting used to visitors and does tend to announce your entry, but she's an old sweetie and isn't any trouble."
2980762,17599598,2014-08-14,19653526,Jason,Kim was great during our stay. We were out and about most of the time but the space was great. Clean and comfy!
2980762,28003173,2015-03-16,26792908,Laurie,"Kim greeted me and was kind, the house exactly as described.  The two pets were there but not intrusive, the bathroom and bedroom perfect.  I loved how cozy the bedroom was and the shower: nice and hot.  Very private and just as described.  The location was perfect for me and what a nice area of Seattle to be in and for exploring!"
2980762,34336279,2015-06-07,32099484,Neil,"I appreciated Kim's friendliness and communication throughout my stay.  The space was comfortable, quiet, and the pets were never, ever a problem.  "
2980762,34674538,2015-06-10,5374281,Jeannette,"We enjoyed our stay at Kim's house. The room is exactly as pictured and very comfy and spacious. Also the private bathroom just across the hall was very nice and clean. Kim's pets are sweethearts and very easy to be around. They leave their fur everywhere, so guests have to prepare for that. Other than that, the house is very clean. The area is nice and quiet, very close to a nice park surrounded by water. We had a car, so going to the city was easy. There are nice cafés and restaurants nearby. Kim is nice and easy going and happy to assist with recommendations. "
2980762,35521070,2015-06-19,35728043,Subbarao,"Kim is a great host, clean place and is close to downtown and quite a few restaurants in the vicinity for dinner. Parking is handy at her place if you drive and have a car."
2980762,35711162,2015-06-21,32831961,John,Kim's place was just as described.  We found it very easy to get to the city by both bus and light rail.  Our bed was comfortable and everything was clean.  Kim was very accommodating and friendly.  
2980762,37397155,2015-07-06,24301089,John,Kim was a friendly and inviting host. I would not hesitate to stay again and I would recommend Kim's airbnb to all of my friends.  Our favorite aspect of Kim's accommodation for us was the privacy of the downstairs guest space. This was exactly as described and exactly what we were looking for.  Kim graciously made space for us when we purchased a few items at the grocery store. We enjoyed meeting Kim's pets too. They were perfectly behaved as described.
2980762,38164589,2015-07-13,3766515,Katherine,"Kim was a great host! The room and bathroom were updated, clean and well decorated. The location was great, just up the road from the main street with good coffee and food!"
2980762,38636642,2015-07-17,29468742,Lucia,"Me and my husband stayed at Kim´s place for four nights. The room was small, but nice and clean. Big plus is private bathroom and a parking place in front of the house. Most of our time we were out - hiking or exploring the city, so we met Kim only at the mornings and evenings. Kim is very friendly and welcoming. If we needed something she was always helpful.
We simply love her pets Olive & Rabbit !
Thank you for super time in Seattle :-)"
2980762,38925536,2015-07-19,26076602,Davis,"Kim graciously hosted my girlfriend and I for two nights. Her location was wonderfully kept and quite private, just what we needed. We also enjoyed exploring the neighborhood thanks to her recommendations. Thank you Kim for q great base from which to explore Seattle and the surrounding areas!"
2980762,39813548,2015-07-26,37444147,Kay,"Kim has a nice house in a nice quiet neighborhood. We stayed in the downstairs room with private bath, it was just as described. It was very nice and private. Kim was a great host and gave us a great dinner recommendation for Mexican food. 
"
2980762,40846605,2015-08-02,39551038,Tom,This was our first time staying at an Airbnb listing and we were completely happy with the experience.  The room is nicely situated and everything was great.  Kim is an excellent host and she made us feel right at home.
2980762,41982682,2015-08-10,37480444,Wanda,"Kim was very amicable and welcoming. We were in town for an event at the Key Arena and Kim let us drop off our luggage prior to check-in time.  We had our privacy and although we spent most of our time at the event, it was a pleasure chatting with Kim whenever we happened to meet.  The neighborhood is safe and there is a bus stop a block away which takes you on a 10 minute ride to the downtown area where you can find a variety of restaurants.   The room was very clean and spacious and had its own private bath and shower.  We had a very pleasant stay at Kim's and would definitely stay here again! "
2980762,43533183,2015-08-20,39660171,Sherri,"Kim is a fantastic host. She is welcoming and helpful. Her animals are sweet and a nice bonus if you miss your furry friends at home. The cat and dog do not disturb nor did we see them in our area of the home. 
Kim's home is a short 3 min walk from public transportation (takes about 20 min via bus to downtown).  She provided parking for our rental car as well. There is a beautiful park on a peninsula in the lake within walking distance. 
The room and restroom are comfycozy (nice/clean/welcoming). There are plenty fresh linens in the restroom. Kim provides a great environment for a traveler. She is friendly while giving privacy as well. I would recommend this listing and would definitely stay here again."
2980762,44374906,2015-08-25,20972633,Abdallah,"Kim was an amazing hostess and made  my first Airbnb experience remarkable. Her house is very charming and extremely quiet while being close to bus and light rail stops. My bedroom was perfect.The furniture is a mix of eclectic art, vintage finds and extremely comfortable bedding. I had a giant closet to hang my clothes, and two windows that made the room very airy and bright despite being a half basement. Also my private bathroom was very nice, clean and well stocked with towels, soaps and other toiletries that travelers always forget. The dog and cat are very cute and well behaved, I hung out with them for a bit but were not intrusive at all in any way. The sunny yard was great for reading and notes, or for waiting for a ride. 

Most importantly was the hospitality of Kim, she was very flexible and accommodating. She also offered a lot of tips and recommendations and was very discreet. I felt I had the place to myself as my privacy was very highly respected. Communication was super easy at all times. Thank you Kim"
2980762,45334961,2015-09-01,36008136,Sam,"The room was clean and and the neighborhood was great for us. It was a little under a mile walk to transit and nearby shops and restaurants. We loved Olive and Rabbit. Slightly expensive for what it was. The room is not attached to the bathroom, which was not a big deal, but with both doors being glass front, it feels a bit exposed. The house  is old so you are able to hear EVERYTHING. Just footsteps upstairs and the shower turning on was quite loud. Kim was welcoming and had lots of great insight on Seattle culture. "
5415077,28053296,2015-03-16,3394080,Marco,"Greg was an awesome host. I had just moved to Seattle, and he made me feel very welcome. The place is in a great location (Pike Place Market is awesome), and the building has a ton of nice amenities. The (very detailed) instructions were super helpful in getting settled into the place, and there was no confusion during check-in. 

The place itself is great, with a nicely sized room, your own bathroom, a fully equipped kitchen (with fresh k-cups for local sources!), and a HUGE patio, which Greg was nice enough to invite me out on for a drink. Awesome view. The sample sized toiletries were a nice touch as well :-)

Overall, very satisfied with everything. Would definitely recommend.  "
5415077,28187993,2015-03-19,27611911,Grant,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Greg's place.  The location is perfect- a block from Pike Place Market and public transportation.  The views of the Sound and sunset from the private deck are spectacular.  The condo was clean and had everything we needed.

Greg was a great host and a nice guy.  He was easy to communicate with and welcomed us into his home.  He offered us anything he had to share and was very helpful. "
5415077,28429243,2015-03-23,19476888,Aliza,"Greg's apartment is everything we needed for our exploration in Seattle. Very clean and quiet with an incredible location just around the corner from Pike's Place Public Market.

We got the key downstairs from the concierge without a hitch and had no problems with getting in. The apartment itself has a nice common space and access to an amazing public balcony that has a view of the market and the water. Really beautiful!

The only potential downside is that the bed itself doesn't have a frame and so is low to the ground, which may be a problem for some guests, but wasn't too much of an issue for me and my husband!

All in all, a great location, reasonable amount of space (not a huge room but definitely sufficient!), great experience in the center of Seattle with easy access to the whole city!"
5415077,28536573,2015-03-25,18723389,Pierpaolo,"Greg is a very friendly a nice guy and his aparment is just great!

Location, location, location... A+
I really don't think you could find another place located like Greg's, you are practically just a few steps away from everything."
5415077,28624833,2015-03-27,3744859,Scott,"Greg is a great host.  He had wine waiting and made me feel at home.  Perfect location, right in the thick of Seattle.  Awesome jog in the morning along the waterfront."
5415077,28819655,2015-03-30,19450946,Cody,"My experience at Greg's condo was everything I hoped it would be. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, the building's amenities were a great perk, and the location was perfect! It was great to be within walking distance of so many Seattle landmarks, especially Pike Place. Definitely consider renting out Greg's place!"
5415077,29316201,2015-04-06,28720567,Vincent,"Greg has an amazing condo in the heart of downtown and is a great host.  His instructions were spot on and helped make our first Airbnb experience relaxing and memorable.  You cannot beat the view of the market and (on a clear day) Mt. Olympia.  Walking distance to Pioneer Square, Capitol Hill, the waterfront and the Space Needle and made for a stress free vacation.  The condo also has a pool/hot tub, large workout room and rooftop patio with gas grills.  Everything you could want from a hotel without the high cost.  I'd recommend this location and host to anyone.

5415077,29565592,2015-04-09,29253898,Nandi,"It was a nice experience to stay in Greg's place. If you are not driving, there couldn't be a better location, it is close to all the famous places in Seattle, and only 30 mins to the airport by Link Light Rail. It is a modern apartment, just like the pictures, well equipped and very clean. Will recommend it if you want to stay in the downtown of Seattle. "
5415077,29801345,2015-04-12,27853468,Abdul,"Greg's place is great. The location is extremely convenient especially if your taking in the train from the Airport, he is just a 5min walk from the University station. His apartment is just two blocks from the famous Pike Place Market and walking distance to many attractions, great restaurants, and shops. 

Greg was very hospitable, and even though the living space was shared, we never felt uncomfortable at any time. He was very respectful and easygoing. 

One thing that was very polite of him was to allow a earlier check in time due to us arriving on an early morning flight and also late check out to accommodate our red eye flight. "
5415077,30311071,2015-04-20,29413302,Sonica,"Greg was extremely helpful by giving additional advice on getting there and very welcoming. The place was as listed and the neighborhood was vibrant, exceeding expectations."
5415077,30779283,2015-04-27,14015599,Ida,Location is key and this place was literally steps away from Pike's Market Place! And it is above a Target so it was really convenient. Parking was a little hard to find but it is in the city so parking is hard to find anywhere. Greg was really nice and energetic. He was communicative and I had no problems during my stay! My Seattle trip was amazing.
5415077,31347066,2015-05-04,28652753,Brittany,"Greg's place was exactly what we expected based on the pictures & description: awesome central location & amazing view! Everything we wanted to see was in walking distance or a few minute uber ride away. Greg was very helpful with recommendations of places to go around the city. 

Overall we had an awesome trip & would recommend staying at Greg's place if you want to be close to all the best Seattle has to offer!"
5415077,31923565,2015-05-11,31413400,John,"I had a great stay at Greg's place!  He was very hospitable and helpful durning my time there and I would definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle.  You also can't beat the location, just a block from the market and all the rest downtown has to offer.  Overall a great experience!"
5415077,32167833,2015-05-15,2846226,Emily,Greg was very friendly and a great host. The apartment is clean and amazingly located right near Pikes market and great restaurants.  My husband and I had a hard time sleeping because the two pillows were pretty flat and the room warm. 
5415077,32515264,2015-05-19,17252452,Sam,"Awesome. Super-easy check-in / check out. Convenient location, is an understatement. You can't do better for the value."
5415077,32892524,2015-05-23,29896300,Will,"Very enjoyable visit, this is the best way to experience Pike Place. I explored the city and grilled some fish from the Public Market right on his 5th floor balcony.   Thanks again Greg."
5415077,33670071,2015-05-31,1366292,Holly,Perfect location and Greg makes a great host! Walking distance to everything and his balcony makes his place that much more enjoyable. Highly recommended! 
5415077,34042555,2015-06-03,34683982,Domenico,We stayed only one night but the experience was very pleasant. Greg is a great host. The location is amazing and it has a pool inside you can access anytime. Very relaxing and super-recommended. 
5415077,34281370,2015-06-07,28512747,Eric,"We had an absolutely wonderful time staying at Greg's place right in the heart of Seattle. He was out of town for the duration of our stay, but he was still incredibly helpful and courteous even from afar. The place was so centrally located that it was easy and comfortable to walk to many of the places we wanted to go."
5415077,34946460,2015-06-14,30169754,Lesley,"Greg's bachelor pad provides basic accommodations in an incredible location.  The building's amenities were very helpful (business center and concierge).  He makes himself available by phone if he is not home and provides great recommendations for local attractions and restaurants.  His place is so centrally located you don't need a car.  Location, location, location!!

"
5415077,36414068,2015-06-28,16331991,Chris,"Greg made me feel very welcome. I was immediately comfortable, and his place was awesome! Perfect Location in Pikes Place Market the picture does it justice. Everything I needed was readily available. Already planning a return trip! 

Thanks Greg! "
5415077,36863439,2015-07-02,31181579,Douglas,Greg's apartment was in a great location that provided access most of Seattle's amenities. This is definitely a place if you're into the hustle and bustle of the city and great views!
5415077,37456784,2015-07-07,31370455,Letty,"Greg was extremely helpful and friendly. He gave detailed directions upon arrival and offered many helpful recommendations. He was also very accommodating with our arrival time and check in was a breeze. 

The accommodations were very basic but the location was unbelievable. Seconds from Pike Market! 
We would definitely return."
5415077,37835155,2015-07-11,13042305,Michelle,"Staying at Greg's apartment was wonderful. Great location, right by Pike's Market with easy access to public transportation. The private room and bathroom were clean and exactly what we needed for the two of us. Greg was extremely friendly and willing to offer up advice on where to go in Seattle. Greg was also willing to work with us with checking in and out...very flexible. Highly recommend! Would absolutely stay again when we visit Seattle in the future. "
5415077,38498177,2015-07-16,3730114,Lisa,"Greg made me feel welcome long before I arrived. He sent quick, thorough communications and continued to provide helpful tips and tricks for having a good trip to Seattle during my stay. Greg warmly welcomed me when I arrived even though I got in late on a Saturday -- really, really kind of him to do. I was so delighted to have such a quick, straight walk to the Convention Center for my conference (just a few blocks!), and ALSO be steps away from Pike Place Market. My fellow conference attendees were so incredibly jealous. I cannot recommend staying with Greg enough. "
5415077,39612644,2015-07-25,30669643,John,Stayed for a couple nights and we enjoyed our stay. Greg made sure of our comfort during out stay. He also accommodated our request regarding check in. And the best part of our trip was being steps away from all the action. Location doesn't get any better than this one. Will definitely stay again!
5415077,40924489,2015-08-03,35440207,Josh,"Couldn't ask for a better location! Minutes walk from everything! Would definitely stay with Greg if we ever go back to Seattle. He made us feel welcomed but also gave us our space. Due to us having a earlier flight in and a later flight out he was able to accommodate us with early check in and late check out b/c he did not have a guest the prior night, nor the day we checked out. He was kind enough to let us know ahead of time that the carpet had a stain on it from a prior guest. The stain had no effect on our stay there but thought it was a nice gesture that he let us know in advance. Most of our time at the apartment if almost felt as if we had the place to ourselves because Greg would be out most of the time. 

We were able to use the pool, hot tub, sauna and gym during our stay. Gym was a plus for me because all we did on our mini vacation was eat so it was nice to be able to walk a few feet to get a quick work out while my lady was getting ready.

Would highly recommend!"
5415077,42523856,2015-08-14,18822866,Sherry,"Great place! close to everything! Greg is very nice, even made us coffee in the morning. We had a great time there!"
5415077,43244493,2015-08-18,36183386,Hoang,"Greg wasn't home on the weekend we arrived but trusted us with his beautiful condo. The room was spacious and the bed was comfortable..and the travel sized amenities were a bonus. The location was prime! The market and waterfront are in walking distance, and any other touristy attraction was no more than a 7 dollar Uber ride away. He gave us great recommendations and when we met him on our last day, he was easy going, welcoming, and very down to earth. When we are back in Seattle, we would definitely try to stay at his place again!"
5415077,43933057,2015-08-23,30307116,Katrina,"Wow, this apartment is INCREDIBLE! Very clean, great view, private bedroom and bathroom with toiletries stocked, and that location literally cannot be beat. After two days of walking miles and miles around the city, the hot tub in his complex was a perfect way to end our stay in Seattle. I am so glad we chose this place. We only met Greg briefly but he was awesome and incredibly welcoming. We couldn't have asked for a better stay!"
5415077,44916750,2015-08-30,37091045,John,Awesome location and Greg is a great host. Recommended!
5415077,46129258,2015-09-08,23328809,Ashlynn,Great location and nice host. Was able to allow us to check in early so we could go see the town. Would recommend staying here.
5415077,46590355,2015-09-12,13652725,Brian,"As others have pointed out, Greg is a very warm host and opened his condo to me and my girlfriend for a couple of days/nights.  I’ve stayed at numerous airbnb’s and his pre-arrival instructions and communication are top-notch.  

The best part is definitely the location, which as others have mentioned, is literally a stone’s throw away from Pike Place.  It’s super easy to get to from the airport via the light rail (only $3!) as well as returning from our adventures on foot into the city.  Building facilities, which include a decent sized gym, a grilling area with a view, and a hot tub/pool/sauna, were all a nice plus.  There’s also a Target at the bottom of his building in case you forget any odds and ends.  Note: the pictures don’t really do the view from Greg’s patio deck justice.  The fresh air was amazing and I wish we would’ve had the time to cook a nice dinner, open a bottle of wine, and enjoy the sunset.  

One other thing worth mentioning: the place itself is pretty austere in terms of furniture and décor.  Everything is super functional and it kind of felt and smelled like my apartment with four dudes in college (which was oddly appropriate since I was there for my old college roommate's wedding).  It wasn’t so bad since we spent most of our time out in the city, but for those needing trendy/chic, I might look elsewhere.  

In any event, we had a great time and were blessed with fantastic weather.  The place is definitely a great jumping off point to tackle all of the coffee, oysters, and food that Seattle has to offer.  Thanks again for your hospitality, Greg!
"
5415077,47781557,2015-09-21,517906,Brian,"Greg was there to greet and make me feel at home with a brief tour.   I didn't see much of him after that because I was in tourist mode.   Greg's place is simple, straightforward and perfectly situated for a quick weekend on the town; exactly the way I like it.   I didn't use any amenities as I was there to see the city, not use a fitness room.    "
5415077,48565798,2015-09-27,7921652,Sd,"Greg is a great host.  I highly recommend him and his place and would stay there again for sure. 

From the time I reached out about the booking, we had excellent communication, and he also shared wonderful tips and insights about what to see and do. 

The apartment is easy to get to from the airport using public transportation. It's in walking distance to the convention center,  ferries and art museum and lots of great dining venues. It's bright and spacious and has a relaxed vibe such that you are right in the middle of things, and his place is a calm oasis. 

Thank you Greg for a wonderful stay! 


"
5415077,49639253,2015-10-05,42854642,Glenn,"Greg's place was really convenient for my short time in Seattle, close to the Pike Place Market and the water. The room was as described and even had a great conversation with Greg about coffee. Would definitely recommend his space if you're in the Seattle area!"
5415077,50052308,2015-10-08,6576108,Christian,"Greg was above-and-beyond welcoming, and made sure my stay was comfortable and flexible. The room itself is clean and cozy, and has a big window for morning sunlight. The apartment is spacious, and though I didn't take advantage of it, has lots of space for relaxing and watching tv. And finally, there's a solid fitness center and pool available on the same floor...awesome!

I couldn't have asked for a better host or a better location! I'll absolutely stay here again when I'm back in town."
5415077,50857795,2015-10-15,959747,Yves,"I had a very nice stay at Gregs ideally located place - Greg is friendly and the room + bathroom are providing real privacy.
I will get back to Greg for my next Seattle visit"
5415077,52595663,2015-10-31,44607256,Mari,"Greg was a great host, he was very communicative leading up to the stay and once we were there, checked in to make sure we had everything we needed. This location can't be beat, Pikes place is literally around the corner, and it is only two streets up from the train station. Plus, the Target downstairs was super convenient for anything we didn't pack. "
5415077,54504797,2015-11-21,41436832,Xin,"Greg is a super great host, he and his beautiful girlfriend are enthusiastic, do help us a lot. 
Their lovely apartment is fantastic, easy the reach from the airport, really close to Pike's market, very easy to catch buses, a big supermarket locates in downstair,big Macy's in 5 mins walk. The view from the deck is fabulous. There is a super comfortable coach in the living room. The kitchen is really great for everyone who loves cooking. They also provide wash machine so that we do not need to walk a long way to do the laundry.
The bed in our room is comfortable, a big window makes the room bright. The big bathroom is a highlight of the apartment as well.
All in all, Grey's apartment should be everyone's first choice in Seattle."
5415077,55903321,2015-12-07,5085356,Courtney,Greg was great with communication and we were able to have everything we needed. You can't beat the location.
5415077,56527042,2015-12-14,43725583,Blake,I would recommend this apartment to anybody! It was nice and in a great location. The hosts were supper friendly and organized! 
5415077,57122050,2015-12-22,43443365,Kelsey,"Greg's place was amazing! It was in a perfect location and was overall very nice. The condo had everything we needed, was clean, and was also very quiet. Greg was extremely nice and helpful. I would highly recommend staying here! "
3265292,14417031,2014-06-18,3939184,Savannah,Jeffrey and Joanne were incredibly attentive and great hosts! I booked the place for my aunt and dad and they were very comfortable. Super soft towels AND a welcome basket! Who doesn't love a welcome basket?
3265292,14719944,2014-06-24,6327091,Shannon,"Jeffrey and Janice were very accommodating hosts. The cottage is extremely clean and has been decorated with exceptional taste. The area is perfect for those who don't want to stay right in Seattle, the drive is about 10 minutes downtown and we enjoyed being out of the city closer to the beach. The beach is literally at the end of the street great for jogging, walking or going to get a coffee. The cottage is well appointed for short or longer stays and the backyard is a real advantage in the warmer weather with the BBQ and chairs. "
3265292,15111075,2014-07-02,6556636,Andy,"Alki Beach Cottage is a dream come true. Built in the '20s, it holds all the charm of a bygone era: built in wood & glass cabinets in the kitchen, etc. Joanne has done a lovely job with furnishings; the front room is comfy & cozy with contemporary furniture. The pull out sofa bed was perfect for our 14 year old, who said it was very comfortable. The single bedroom was so nice--with 2 windows; the Queen bed very comfortable as well. Joanne did not skimp on sheets, blankets & towels: all were of high quality, new & very white! The kitchen was well equipped with pots & pans, strainers & utensils; there is a gas grill out back with all the essentials as well. The backyard was private with plenty of room for Adirondack chairs, a table & 4 chairs, and, on the deck, 2 more chairs. There are so many places to sit & enjoy the neighborhood! There are even nice chairs on the front porch. It's a tiny place but we never felt cramped. And our son appreciated the internet connection so he could play his games at night. All in all, a very positive experience. "
3265292,15343449,2014-07-07,16746861,Linda,"What a great space for a vacation! I want to come back! Joanne and Jeffrey wrote back quickly, they responded to questions all throughout. They were attentive to needs and supplied us with everything we needed. This was THE perfect place to be. Quaint, clean and beautiful. I spent the mornings drinking my coffee in the backyard with the birds. Lavender and other beautiful plants are all around the cottage. Sweet place. Can't say enough good words"
3265292,15639164,2014-07-13,16786971,Cheri,"So grateful for the wonderful week we stayed at Joanne's beautiful cottage!  We were two women, best friends for about 28 years, meeting up in the Seattle area for a much needed week long ladies retreat. We were looking for a quiet place to catch up...and drink some wine, lol.  Joanne was an exceptionally hostess who communicated with us prior to out arrival and provided directions that guided us directly to the front door. We were greeted with a warm welcome note and thoughtful touches to make us know we were personally welcomed. This cottage has been carefully put together from a travelers perspective and provides comforts not normally found.  The entire cottage and yard were very clean and well stocked, in fact, the cottage seemed to anticipate our every need... There was even ice in the freezer. The beds were comfortable with uber soft blankets, and we enjoyed restful sleep during our stay-something I usually have to settle into when I travel! My friend was very taken with the colors used in the decorating of the house, it is indeed beautifully decorated. The attention to detail if striking and you can feel the care that Joanne has put into making sure her guests are comfortable. There are books throughout the home pertinent to Seattle (restaurant guides, city directory, historic books of the area) that invite you to connect and explore. There is also a wonderful listing she hasn't together with her personal recommendations and the wifi. Don't miss Metropolitan Market, speedy but Awesome selection! Also definitely make a trip to the fabulous Bakery Nouveau.

 We found a car helpful as we really were focused on exploring the area during the days. We really looked forward to returning to the tranquil neighborhood to relax in the evenings. The inviting backyard with Adirondack chairs as well as a glass table and chairs was perfect for relaxing, wine and dinner. We also walked to the beach, and enjoyed the local restaurants and parks in the evenings. Alki is convenient to Seattle (about 20 minutes) and we explored much of the Seattle sites on various days. The ferry system is also close by and there was a lot to see on the nearby islands that us easy to get to.  We did take day trips to Vashon, Bainbridge, Olympic Peninsula and explored Sequim and the Hoh rainforest (although the Hoh turned out to be quite a drive).  The cottage seemed to be just perfectly located, and very easy to get to.  In the end we wished we had stayed longer, it was such a beautiful vacation! Thank you so much Joanna! We were grateful for the opportunity to meet you briefly during our stay, and hope to return again to your lovely slice of paradise in Alki!"

Another adorable feature of this rental was the basket of treats the owner left for us. We both felt very pampered and valued to be there.
Did I mention the comfortable bed? It nearly guarantees a great night's sleep. Finally, it's so close to a quiet beach area and the popular/shop beach area that you can walk a couple of blocks in either direction. This is one rental not to miss."
3265292,17100214,2014-08-07,6939664,Barry,"The Alki Beach Cottage is one of the nicest and well maintained properties in the Alki Beach neighborhood. A very cute house that is a testament to both Jeff and Joanne's passion for the property. The house is located near the beach and is very convenient to downtown Seattle. The highlight of the property is a wonderful backyard that was difficult to leave in the morning and a great spot to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Highly recommend this house for anyone looking for a more unique, personal, boutique type experience. The hosts for this property, Jeff and Joanne, are two of the nicest and most thoughtful hosts my wife and I have experienced with Airbnb. They have a passion for the house, the neighborhood and are great hosts. The Alki Beach Cottage is a great value for money and a great choice for a visit to Seattle. "
3265292,17211766,2014-08-09,16870005,Julia,"This super cute Arts and Crafts era cottage is very clean and beautifully decorated with many original features still in place.  It has a pleasant backyard area and It is just a short walk from the beach. The kitchen is well equipped and there was delicious coffee, tea, and snacks laid out for us!   The owner could not be nicer!  We wish we could have stayed much longer!"
3265292,17514703,2014-08-13,17707357,Lee,"This is a lovely cottage, and Jeffrey and Joanne went out of their way to ensure that we were comfortable and felt at home. They set up a play-tent in the back yard for our little girls to play in, and left a wonderful welcome basket for us. We enjoyed the neighborhood -- it has a real beach community feel to it. The beach and an array of restaurants are a 10 minute walk from the cottage, but the blocks surrounding the house are quiet and residential. The cottage is a 10 to 15 minute drive from the water taxi terminal to get to downtown Seattle. The cottage itself is beautiful and comfortable. We hope to return soon!"
3265292,17760487,2014-08-17,17326713,Cynthia,"We stayed here with a 2 year old toddler for 4 nights. It was perfect for our needs, extremely quaint and comfortable, located a short walk from the beach and nearby parks. Our toddler was able to run around in the backyard and we enjoyed sitting outside during the short time it didn't rain. We even walked to the main business street in West Seattle which is about 1.5 miles away and had easy driving access to a variety of restaurants and shops. The only modern conveniences the house does not have is a dishwasher and washer/ dryer but we did not really need them during our stay. We stayed in West Seattle to be close to family but would not recommend this location if you wish to easily access the more central parts of Seattle as driving in and out of the area can be difficult with traffic. However if you wish to be near Alki beach and enjoy a relaxing environment it is a very good location. Joanne was very easy to communicate with before and during our stay."
3265292,18122453,2014-08-22,18012100,Steve,"The house was immaculate -- charming, with lots of little accessories that really made it feel like home.  Nice back yard, even had a tent with toys for the kids!  Would absolutely stay again, highly recommended."
3265292,18478467,2014-08-27,12134219,Jennifer,Our host made us feel extremely welcome and the house was even nicer in person than the description and photos.   Will definitely stay there when we return to Seattle.
3265292,18689122,2014-08-30,14546291,Katie,"Great host who got the balance right between being welcoming and helpful whilst also giving us our space. Had thought of everything and even got a fab welcome basket with a couple of nice surprises in it too. Beautiful house just a very short walk away from a very peaceful ocean view, restaurants and transport links into downtown and California junction. Really nice people, highly recommended. "
3265292,18986993,2014-09-04,17736029,Mike,"We'd stay again! 

Both Jeff and Joanne were really accommodating and the place was neat and clean.  They have a great eye for decorating. Quiet neighborhood.   There is no TV or internet, but the beach is right there, so you really don't need to be inside! "
3265292,19372794,2014-09-11,19747383,Tammi,"Joanne was a great hostess  .I went for 5 days with my daughter from grad school for a quick get away. My daughters favorite foods were waiting in the fridge when we got there. The neighborhood was fantastic. I am so glad we stayed outside the city this time. So much gourmet food everywhere. Joanne gave us some great tips on where to eat and what to do. The house was perfect, even cuter in person. I will definitely be back. "
3265292,19820109,2014-09-19,12785143,David,"The house lived up to its billing and was ideal for us - a British couple wishing to experience a Seattle neighbourhood.  The house is in a quiet street and is within easy walking distance of the local beach and shops.  Downtown Seattle is accessible by car or by water taxi.  We arrived late at the house due to the late arrival of our train, but Joanne who acted as host during our visit, had remained there to greet us.  She made us welcome by providing a number of items such as coffee, milk, cereal and fruit for our use.  The house was comfortable, had everything required for an enjoyable stay and was immaculately presented.  One point of particular note was the copious dedicated hanging space for our clothes.  Throughout our stay Joanne responded to our queries and made suggestions for places to visit.  Recommended."
3265292,20453163,2014-09-29,21234893,Emily,"This cottage was beautiful, very cute and super clean! The bed was very comfy, plenty of towels/linens. The kitchen was well stocked. Joanne made us feel very welcome, even meeting us at the grocery store to make sure we had everything we needed. She left some snacks and drinks in the house which was totally unnecessary but made us feel welcome and at home. She even provided Shampoo, conditioner and soap. Not sure if hair dryer is already mentioned in the listing but there is one provided. The house is a very short walk to the beach and the neighborhood is very quiet. We would love to stay here again if we come back to visit Seattle! "
3265292,21974228,2014-10-27,10554754,Elisha,"Where do I begin?! This was undoubtedly the BEST Airbnb I have ever stayed in. The house is absolutely incredible - stylish, functional, cozy, and charming, and is a short 5 min walk to the stunning Seattle coastline. Joanne was more than accommodating, and provided us with some yummy snacks, extra plush towels, and tons of neighborhood options for our stay. On top of it, she was very flexible when it came to checking in and out - something we haven't had with other Airbnb hosts. The bed is very comfortable and kitchen and bathroom areas were immaculately clean. We are so impressed by this home and its owners that we are already planning our trip back! Thank you, thank you, thank you Joanna and Jeffrey for making this an incredible Seattle experience!!! "
3265292,22357513,2014-11-04,20446672,Andrew,Joanne was a great host. She was very attentive and made our first Airbnb experience very enjoyable. She welcomed us in and was very informative about the Seattle area and had great recommendations on  places to visit. The cottage was in a nice neighborhood and just a block away from the beach. Everything was as advertised. Highly recommend a stay at the cottage!
3265292,22584169,2014-11-10,21266707,Susan,"Met us at the door, had a welcome sign with our names and gave us. Walk thru of the home.  Also asked prior about our coffee/tea preferences and special diet needs....nice touch!"
3265292,23244503,2014-11-26,22988530,Francisco,"This cottage is great!  Very comfortable, and the location is awesome.  Walking distance to Alki Beach and restaurants.  Host provides plenty of towels, and the kitchen has all necessary gear, with coffee maker and grinder, and blender.  The welcome basket/kit was a very nice touch. The hosts really do make every effort to make your stay enjoyable, and are readily available to answer any questions, etc.  Definitely a great experience. If I ever had the chance to, I'd stay again in a heartbeat. "
3265292,23437514,2014-12-01,7173185,Chris,"Joanne was a superlative hostess.  She kept in contact with us for the duration of our stay, but in a completely unobtrusive way.  The cottage itself is immaculate, in a wonderful neighborhood, and close to the beach and restaurants.  Our stay could not have been better."
3265292,23998944,2014-12-16,13609535,Eric,"Great cozy place, everything was clean and orderly. The instructions and communications with Joanne were great. Amazing experience, I will definitely be coming back to visit."
3265292,24706293,2015-01-02,21060386,Tatiana,"Joanne and Jeffrey are very rare hosts. We were traveling to West Seattle to celebrate Christmas and New Year's Eve with family. This was our first experience with Airbnb & we were delighted!!

From the moment I first made contact and rented Alki Beach Cottage, either Jeffrey or Joanne would respond almost immediately answering questions and making suggestions to make our trip one to remember.

Their Cottage is truly a dream from another era. We were greeted late at night by Joanne who had decorated the cottage with her defining inviting touches of twinkling lights, a beautiful floral wreath, fresh flowers with evergreens, & a Welcome Basket! 

The house itself was cozy warm, with lots of open space inviting you to relax & enjoy the season's aromas!

The bedroom was amply large with a huge walk in closet with plenty of wood hangers. The queen bed had a programmed mattress warmer & the fluffiest soft white blankets  which once entered - in this warm cocoon- you would drift off to sleep feeling like you were floating on a cloud!!  Two windows provided fresh air.

The living area was open and comfy - exactly as pictured. The Wi-Fi worked beautifully; the old fashion floor heater worked perfectly; the Information book was full of ideas; & the coat hanger placed for all outerwear when entering.

The kitchen was of another era. It was open & sunny.  I had read one negative review when the  Cottage first opened & they had responded that they had plans to take care of it soon. Thus,  I did not envision the kitchen as is - my only ""-"".  However, it was my fault.  Had I  e-mailed with the hosts prior to renting, the problem would have been realized & I may not have rented it. Then another huge mistake, as I would have missed out on this lovely experience. Without hesitation - I will rent Alki Beach Cottage on future visits to Seattle, using their vision & truly relax. Both a picture, as well as, their vision of how their kitchen would best be used would be more helpful for future renters. 

We went away for a few days & during our absence, Joanne reprogrammed the heater due to a cold snap that had come to the area as well as refreshed everything.

Joanne & Jeffrey truly want their guests to  enjoy their stay and go out of their way to make sure that happens!! 

They truly care about you! 

Two things shocked me.  First, they took the time to drive the length of Alki Beach to find the best vantage point to watch the Space Needle fireworks!  The second, as my husband was quite ill on the day of departure , we received a text of genuine concern from Joanne offering us to stay a few days gratis until he felt better.

Both were unexpected. 

We felt treated as family throughout & full of gratitude to Joanne & Jeffrey for everything!!!

AlkiBeachCottage -  5 stars!!

3265292,26391583,2015-02-11,10993947,Klaasjan,"We stayed about three weeks in this wonderful cottage. Although Seattle in January/February sounds grim, it is still a nice place to be. The location in West Seattle connects you directly to the waters of Puget Sound, which is all around. 

The cottage is well decorated, nicely equipped (lots of kitchen ware, linens etc). Joanne had prepared a welcome package with some delicious goodies. Joanne take the time to make yourself familiar with the neighbourhood and city and provides valuable tips for the stay.  "
3265292,26779998,2015-02-19,8835024,Céline,"This was the perfect place for us in Seattle. Alki Beach, is gorgeous. 2 minutes from the cottage you have access to the beach, with an incredible view on the mountains and on the city.
The Cottage is the most prettiest house have the street !!! The garden is gorgeous, with giants rhododendrons.
Joanne is the perfect hostess. She has thought about everything with refinement. Nothing is missing. All the details are full of attention (fresh tulips in the kitchen, canddles in the room...).
Our plane were delayed and she even ""track"" us to check our new schedule. We will come back !!!
"
3265292,27556128,2015-03-07,10993947,Klaasjan,What does it say when you return to the same cottage within a month? Well: It's great. I really like staying here when I am in Seattle. Especially with Summer coming up.
3265292,28391372,2015-03-23,26973271,Chelsea,"We were traveling to Seattle for work/vacation.  This home was a perfect landing place for our outings.  After being out and about during the day it was a great place to relax at night.  We were able to walk down to the restaurants and the beach (only two blocks away).    We were also traveling with a toddler and it was great to have outdoor space for them to run around.  For kids there is a great park near by and the neighborhood is very walkable. 

The living spaces were comfortable and had everything we needed.  The kitchen is well stocked with dinning and cooking tools.   Really appreciated the WiFi and it work great. There is also a great claw foot tub and a walk in closet large enough for all of the luggage.  

Joanne was very responsive to messages right from the beginning and was at the house upon our arrival.    Joanne was also very helpful with suggestions on places to eat and grocery stores near by.  We would recommend to anyone looking for a great Seattle experience. "
3265292,28623239,2015-03-27,7758368,Jake,Had a great stay at the cottage.  Location was fantastic - a couple of blocks from the beach and restaurants.  House was very well appointed and exactly as nice as what's advertised.  I stayed there w/ my wife and two kids - was cozy but fun and doable.  Joanne the host was easy and great to work with.  
3265292,29001923,2015-04-02,13251842,Dan,Best AirBnb so far!  Amazing place.  Thank you Joanne for making our stay so special.  
3265292,29500374,2015-04-08,28509761,Kathy,"Joanne was a gracious host, knowledgable and helpful but not intrusive.  Her cottage was cozy, very well tended and equipped and was well represented in the Airbnb post.  We loved the area of Alki Beach and West Seattle.  The immediate neighborhood was peaceful and quiet and residential; we enjoyed sitting on the front porch and back yard and walking the few blocks to the beach area.  I would definitely recommend this property and plan to return myself."
3265292,29990927,2015-04-15,30017833,Megan,"There is not enough we can say about our stay at the cottage.  We were greeted by Joanne upon our arrival, what a lovely host she is!  We spent our days taking a quick drive into the city to shop or eat.  Cruising along the shores of West Seattle.  Alki Beach itself has so much to offer within 1/2 mile or so walking distance.  If I could live in this cottage forever, we would.  The warmth of the decor, the simplicity of the surroundings, the attention to every little detail inside and out for us to enjoy our stay.  Joanne was so kind to recommend places to us or offer suggestions for things we may enjoy, we actually did everything she suggested.  
Alki Beach is a place where you must go if you are in need of some R&R from the hustle and bustle of your everyday life.  If you want to go sight seeing it is minutes away, but you have the luxury of returning to a beautiful retreat.  We grilled in the evenings and enjoyed the beautiful backyard and amazing sunsets.  Joanne filled the house with fresh flowers, delicious snacks that were exactly what we love and the linens were so beautiful.  This place is a true gem.  In the week since we left, I have reflected on our stay in Alki Beach for a week, and can only dream of going back to such a lovely place."
3265292,30585317,2015-04-24,31418972,Kevin,"Friendly, helpful owners. Clean, comfortable accomodations in a good neighborhood."
3265292,31342190,2015-05-04,21283245,Xuena,"Very cozy and comfortable stay, everything is same as what you can see from the photos. Beautiful garden and yard. Joanna is very responsive and considerable, you can get all the info from her easily, and she arranged all the stuff you would need in the house. The cottage is close to the Alki Beach, only 5 mins walk distance to the Starbucks. Great experience when I first time staying in Seattle, thanks very much."
3265292,31650031,2015-05-08,9538615,Roberta,"Joanne and Jeffery were amazing hosts and the cottage was exquisite, perfectly located and as comfortable as you could possible desire. Joanne shared all of the secret places in West Seattle and was generous with her time in acquainting us with the neighborhood. Alki Beach was two minutes away and we walked the long shoreline every day,. There are great nearby eateries and plenty of coffee houses. Not that you'll want to wander far from the cottage. Its comforts and appointments are simply charming. We found it hard to leave, and definitely will be going back!  "
3265292,33676228,2015-05-31,14698272,Lynda,"I loved staying at Joanne & Jeffrey's place in Alki Beach. Joanne is the perfect host. She had treats and basic foods waiting for my arrival. The location is great, walking around is easy, bus service a block away. She left helpful notes on restaurants and pointed me towards the an amazing grocery store, Metropolitan. The photos are correct but do not truly capture the charm of this wonderful cottage. Don't miss Cactus Restaurant. They make a mean Sangria and Mexican dishes that were super tasty. "
3265292,35566092,2015-06-20,23045337,Paul,"This was a very pleasant place to stay. Quiet immediate neighborhood with easy walk to restaurants and beach. Joanne was there when we arrived and welcoming. Good size place for an individual, couple, or couple with an infant. "
3265292,38249756,2015-07-14,17293264,Brandy,"My husband and I had been to Seattle once before and stayed in Belltown since it was a quick 2 day visit.  This time around we had 10 days and wanted something a little more laid back.  We definitely got what we were looking for and so much more.  Our flight was not scheduled to get into SEA-TAC until after 10pm and it was delayed an hour so we didn't even make it to the house until closer to midnight but Joanne was there waiting for us with a welcoming smile!  Incredibly informative and knowledgeable about the area, she made us feel like family in for a visit.  The house is 2-3 blocks from the beach along with several restaurants and coffee places.  Only a 20 minute drive from most of the places we wanted to visit, it was the perfect location.  We could even take a quick 5 minute water taxi to Pike Place Market if we didn't feel like driving.  More than once I remarked to my husband that if we weren't there to explore more of Seattle then I would have been just as content sitting on the back porch the entire time.  It was that relaxing.  Joanne was always quick to answer any questions we had as well as offer suggestions on places, things, and activities we might be interested in.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone with enough time to enjoy it.  Trust me, if its only a quick stay you'll be kicking yourself for not having more time!  "
3265292,39052439,2015-07-20,36482154,Amethyst,"We had a really great time staying at the cottage!  It is very cute and cozy with the beach and restaurants within walking distance.  J&J were always very quick to respond to questions and were very helpful. They really thought of everything to make our stay a good one - including a welcome basket with goodies and a very well stocked kitchen.  The house was very clean with stylish decor and had very nice towels/linen/pillows/etc.  I especially liked that the house was away from the craziness of downtown Seattle but a quick drive to the major tourist attractions - e.g. Space Needle, EMP Museum, etc.  The neighborhood was very quiet, and we always felt safe walking around.  Joanne was extremely helpful with suggestions on everything from scenic places to border crossing times to the best place to get a manicure.  If I ever go back to Seattle, I would definitely try to stay here again, and I recommend it to anyone visiting."
3265292,39612005,2015-07-25,1626124,Karie,"This house, it's amenities and location can't be beat. I used to call downtown Seattle home before moving overseas 6 plus years ago and from that prospective I can say it's a great base to experience Seattle from!"
3265292,40909029,2015-08-03,10132822,Jean-Louis,"Very nice stay in this cute cottage. It's very well equipped and ideally located close enough to the beach but in a peaceful neighborhood. This house is even better than the photos, so no surprise. The small yard on the back is perfect if you have kids. This is definitely one (or the best) of my best Airbnb experience all over the world. I highly recommend Joanne and Jeffrey's place. They are wonderful hosts."
3265292,41590254,2015-08-08,6320269,Charles,"Charming cottage, great host! We've enjoyed the place and Seattle very much. Thanks Joanne and Jeffrey."
3265292,42187190,2015-08-11,9651944,Ashley,My niece and I had an absolutely perfect stay at the Alki Beach Cottage!  Everything you could possibly think of and more was there for our use.  Easy walking distance to a myriad of beaches and restaurants. Joanne provided excellent communication from the get go and truly made us feel at home with all of the extra touches. Cannot wait to go back!
3265292,43035198,2015-08-17,14058429,Ryan,"Joanne and Jeffrey are gracious hosts, responsive with communication and treated you like a valued guest.   The space was comfortable, quiet and relaxing.  The kitchen is well furnished,  making it easy to prepare meals.  We enjoyed the walkabliy to the beach and beach front restaurants.  We would stay with them again and encourage friends to do the same."
3265292,43851530,2015-08-22,19011209,Tish,"We arrived to the cottage after dinner and were greeted by a welcome package. The package included everything from lemonade to bananas to a variety of snacks for our daytrips into Seattle. It seemed as though they had been thoughtful enough to get the snacks that our eight-year-old would enjoy.

  The cottage was super cute and was equipped for everything we needed. We loved using the barbecue and enjoying sunset while eating dinner. The cards and scrabble games were an added bonus!!

Joanne was easily accessible throughout our entire stay. She even offered us to be able to go back and take a nap on the day we were checking out before we left town. 

The Wi-Fi was perfect so that we could stay connected even while on vacation. We found street parking easily each day we were there. Without hesitation we would stay here again."
3265292,45578986,2015-09-04,30155197,Jeff,"Wonderful. This sums up our experience at the cottage, Alki Beach/West Seattle, and with Joanne. She was a gracious host, checking in to see how we were doing half way through while also leaving us to a romantic stay. Our next Seattle visit need not change at all."
3265292,46198559,2015-09-08,2313530,Emily,"This beach cottage is absolutely wonderful, the decorations, amenities , locations - its perfect for 2 people short trip in Seattle, we enjoyed so much. p.s. the kitchen is adorable, also the garden area with the grill machine, very cozy. Joanne was also a very nice host, would totally recommend it to anyone visiting! :) "
3265292,47107040,2015-09-15,43223219,Alison,"Joanne did a wonderful job answering our questions from the start. This was our first airbnb experience, and we were pleased with all aspects of the arrangement.
The cottage was exactly as represented on the site. Bright beach style design....very (email hidden)aceful and quiet neighborhood.
My husband and I would not hesitate to schedule a return visit!"
3265292,50026373,2015-10-08,45116691,Jacquelyn,"I had an amazing time at the Alki Beach Cottage!  It was just a short walk to the beachfront, restaurants, small stores, and the fabulous 2+ mile Alki Beach Walking Trail. The house itself was even more spectacular than the location!  Tucked into the quite West Seattle neighborhood, relaxation was uninterrupted and the property is very private. It's also perfectly furnished and equipped with everything you would need for any length stay.  

I was especially greatful for the extra little things they did to make my stay more accommodating. They knew I was coming in late that evening and left some goodies in the fridge in addition to the welcome basket in the kitchen!  They thought of EVERYTHING!!!  

I would HIGHLY recommend any property listed by Jeffrey and Joanne. "
3265292,50809089,2015-10-14,46031229,Samya,"Our trip was all that I dreamed it would be, the house was completely adorably perfect for my kids and I, Joanne made it feel like our home.  Just perfectly perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more!"
3265292,51083760,2015-10-17,46258379,Dwight,"JoAnne has this hosting thing down. You arrive to great smells, candle light, soft music, and romantic mood lighting. 

Too bad, I was traveling alone. But hey, there's snacks in the kitchen! 

JoAnne has thought of every convenience and consideration for her guests. I needed a place to stay while working on a project in West Seattle--so why not in one of Seattle's best areas of Alki Beach?  The sunsets are amazing just two blocks away and just around the bend you can see Mount Ranier.  Super convenient to ferries, the house is very cozy and comfortable for one or two people. There's good plumbing, water pressure, heat and a super comfortable bed!  And I loved the  back yard and meeting the neighborhood cats and dogs. The house, the host --the energy is just good here."
3265292,52659436,2015-10-31,1007057,Crystal,"While our stay was only for a few nights, Joanne's place was a perfect fit.  The decor is great and the house is a great size for a couple.  There were so many thoughtful amenities (the snacks and bed warmer were awesome) and Joanne was a total sweetheart.  She was really accommodating even with our last minute booking and was fun to talk with.  I can't recommend this cottage (and our hosts) enough!  Plus your just seconds from a gorgeous beach view and tons of great restaurants.  Loved it!"
3265292,55125130,2015-11-28,37896778,Judy,"Joanne and Jeffrey were wonderful hosts. They made the whole experience easy and enjoyable. The small touches--like chocolate on the night table--made us feel welcome. The cottage was just perfect, close to the beach, and fabulous walks and hikes within easy access. We especially loved the adorable kitchen, which was fabulously equipped with everything we needed for breakfast, lunch and even Thanksgiving dinner."

Joanne is a gracious and generous host, complete with a proper greeting upon arrival, which reminded me of my time in France. It has the perfect combination of Craftsman charm, beach cottage, and French style. Very comfortable, and I felt completely at home. I look forward to a future visit! "

Foi a primeira vez que minha mae estaria me acompanhando numa reserva feita pelo airbnb e minha preocupação era que tudo desse certo. Não poderia ter escolhido melhor!!!
O lugar é maravilhoso. Adoramos a decoração e a maneira como tudo é perfeitamente organizado na casa. 
Estavamos numa viagem longa e já era a 3a cidade que visitávamos e a sensação era de que estávamos em casa de novo pelo clima do apartamento. 
A internet wi fi é excelente, os quartos super confortáveis e a lareira na sala o diferencial. 
As amenidades oferecidas são ótimas e o fato de ter 2 banheiros foi perfeito para nós que estávamos num grupo de 4 pessoas.
Super recomendo o local!!!"

It is very clean & cute in a safe  walkable neighborhood with great coffee shops - restaurants within walking distance.  Easy access to 520 and not far from I-5. Kim was an excellent hostess and met me to show me around the cottage and explain the TV, etc.  My trip was delayed a couple days and that was no problem.  she is right next door so quick to respond but you have complete privacy.  I highly recommend it! "
7717813,46768409,2015-09-13,41436038,Lynne,"Amazing. Kim met at the house for a brief tour...she had left me some arrival treats which was so sweet. The house was immaculate and so adorable. I felt like I nestled in a cottage in the heart of Seattle...which I was. The bed, couch, water pressure all the things we care about in a house were perfection. I had a vacation of a business trip because of this home. Grateful for the experience."

We will certainly check Kim's calendar first the next time we need a place to stay in Seattle."

The cottage itself is cozy with a creative blend of modern and antique things.  I especially liked the bed linens--soft and luxurious!  Kim was great--gave me an brief tour of the cottage and then left me alone while assuring me she was available if need be.  Great stay!

486829,1440770,2012-06-08,2557870,Kristy,this was my first time with airbnb. i made a last minute reservation with lisa and michael and they were very quick to respond. they were very accomodating and helpful and had some good advice for me since i'm new to the area and was looking for a home for me and my dog. their little dog jesse was very cute but didn't seem to want a big dog in his home. (i think he was happy to see us go) and the cat was never around.
486829,1458896,2012-06-11,2423765,Jim,"Lisa and Michael were amazing and gracious hosts.  The bedroom was clean, comfortable and the queen sized bed gave us three nights of great sleep.  The internet connection worked well.

The bus stop for line 65 is directly across the street to the east of their home.  We enjoyed their dog Jesse and cat Jacques as well.  

We felt that we had made some wonderful friends and would love to stay with them again if we visit Seattle."
486829,1552034,2012-06-24,2653127,Catherine,"It was a delight staying in the Cascadia Room! Lisa Michael were out of town that night, but they were more than willing to make it work. They're located in Bryant, which is very close to the neighborhoods I wanted to be in (Fremont, U District, etc). Self-check in and out was very easy; Lisa was very clear in her explanation of where things were and how they worked. 

I would recommend them to anyone visiting Seattle!"
486829,1618154,2012-07-02,2761325,Peter,"My brother and I make a trip to Seattle once a year to catch a game at Safeco field. This was our first time using airbnb to make accommodations and it was cool! Lisa and Michael were great hosts and did their best to be sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed, including making up an extra bed on the couch so we could each have our own place to sleep. Michael even offered to come pick us up after the game...what a mench! I would recommend them to any other airbnb user."
486829,1670528,2012-07-09,2394478,Ovidiu,"We really enjoyed staying at Lisa and Michael's place.  They were wonderful hosts.  Although they were very busy getting packed up and ready for their own upcoming trip they took time to help us figure out what to see in Seattle.  The only downside is that we didn't get to hang out with them more!  The room is beautiful.  It is in a great, convenient and safe location.   
"
486829,1831433,2012-07-29,2929801,Jan,"We were in the area for a rather stressful family wedding.....couldn't have picked a better place to stay to feel at home, relaxed, and made welcome!  Lisa & Michael put us immediately at ease, and the house and our room were clean, comfy, and peaceful.  Had time allowed, we'd gladly have extended our stay!  An amazing array of breakfast items were available, and we enjoyed the entertainment from the wee pets. "
486829,1878781,2012-08-03,167243,Larissa,"Lisa and Michael were both gracious hosts. We saw each other a couple of times a day, and they were always happy to chat and help. Nice touches included snacks in the kitchen and fridge, great location (5-min drive to U-district; 10 sec walk to Burke-Gilman Trail; 5-min drive to I-5 and the 520 toll bridge; 2-min drive to shopping mall and supermarkets), and the adorable cat. The room has a very comfortable bed (great for sleeping off jet lag!) and a writing desk, plus a closet for storing my luggage. Easy free parking right outside the door. If you are looking for a convenient and comfortable place in Seattle, definitely consider the Cascadia Room!"
486829,1920399,2012-08-07,2722355,Sara & JD,"Michael and Lisa were amazing hosts, and made us feel at home after a long flight. They gave us a ton of suggestions about unique things to do while we were in Seattle as well as other cities we were visiting on our trip. Their apartment was very convenient (close to the University District and Fremont, walking distance to an outdoor mall, and a 10 minute drive into the city). The room was comfortable and clean.  They have two cute dogs and an extremely friendly cat.  We highly recommend staying with Michael and Lisa for a great place to sleep while you are in Seattle."
486829,1937329,2012-08-09,2222312,Lisa,"Lisa and Michael were wonderful!!  They were very helpful with directions, even printing them for us.  On two occasions they went out of their way to drive us downtown and to the Pike Place Market.  There is a bus stop just across the street.  They are very easy going, warm and friendly.  The room is comfortable and clean.  They were extremely flexible regarding check out which was of great help to us."
486829,2031776,2012-08-19,3091056,Daniel,Clean & confortable room + super nice host = Lisa & Michael's Cascadia room. Nice neighborhood + unbeatable price. I highly recommend this bnb to everyone!
486829,2359600,2012-09-21,2761867,Frances,"I had a great experience staying in the Cascadia Room!  I moved to Seattle in August and stayed in the Cascadia Room for an entire month while I looked for a place of my own.  Lisa and Michael were wonderful hosts who made me feel comfortable and welcome the entire time.  They are friendly, approachable, and very knowledgeable about the area.  They even helped me in my search for an apartment by offering advice about the different neighborhoods in Seattle.  They are aware of their guests' needs, offering them the privacy and space needed to feel at home, while still providing a friendly environment.  I really felt like I made a little home within their home for the month that I was staying there.  The room is very nice and offers a large closet and flatscreen TV.  It was also fun to hang out with their very cute pets.  If you are looking for safe, relaxed, and comfortable place to stay while in Seattle, I highly recommend staying in the Cascadia Room!"
486829,2873340,2012-11-12,4019729,Mohit,"We were looking for a one night stay in seattle saturday night, since all hotel rooms were booked, i turned to airbnb. Lisa was very friendly, place was clean and bed was comfortable. We had a good amount of privacy too. Great price for the room and very convenient to downtown if you are driving."
486829,2893800,2012-11-15,1664417,Fred,"Lisa is a really nice host, We book the room at the date we are going to stay and she respond and accept us very quick.
the room is nice and she has a cat is really cute. dogs are friendly too.
we would like to stay next time."
486829,3892507,2013-03-25,5208871,Sharrol,This room is in a convenient location for U district business or pleasure.  It is easy to find and in a fairly quiet neighborhood.
486829,4326638,2013-04-28,1925754,Robert,"Wonderful place to lay your head near the University of Washington! Lisa was a terrific host, gave a great coffee shop recommendation and directions (even shared some pancakes she had made for breakfast). Very friendly and welcoming environment. Cannot beat the location right next to the Burke-Gilman Trail and the U Village shopping center. "
486829,4718512,2013-05-21,3403929,Angele,"Lisa was very kind and was quick to help for anything! Her place is in a beautiful neighbourhood, with a great coffee shop and some delicious food! I had a workshop in the area, and the cascadia room worked out well! :)"
486829,6208208,2013-08-03,1652755,Brittani,"We moved into the Cascadia room after a two night stay in the Olympia room. Again, Lisa was so kind and laid-back we really enjoyed our stay while looking for apartments here in Seattle. Just like the Olympia room, the bed was great and the room was spacious; Lisa even let us keep our belongings in the closet, which was great since we had a lot to bring with us on our road trip. We would gladly stay with Lisa again and certainly recommend any of Lisa's rooms to say in while visiting Seattle."
486829,6232894,2013-08-04,702975,Lauren,Lisa's place is in a great location! Downtown is easily  accessible by bus and the UofWashington is within walking distance. The room is clean and the bed is comfy. Lisa was very sweet. Would highly recommend!
486829,6312988,2013-08-07,8942517,Sj,"Lisa's place was everything we could have wanted and more. She's the perfect host - is kind, welcoming and available - but just let's you get on with it. She's thought of everything a guest could need, going above and beyond with little things left in the room. Her place is easy to park at, and literally 5 seconds from the awesome bike trail that whizzes you to East to West across Seattle, and easily connects with going downtown. The bed is extremely comfortable and all rooms are neat, clean and tastefully decorated in cool, calm colours. Thank you very much Lisa! It was great to meet you and kick-start our trip. "
486829,6521328,2013-08-15,5155873,Christian,"Oh what more nice things can I say that hasn't already been said about Lisa. Lisa was an amazing host that kept great communication right up to the minute we left and arrived as well. Her beautiful home is cuddled up by the university district in a safe, quiet, and calm neighborhood. Transportation wise, there are bus lines outside of her home that go into the main university (where most of the campus attractions are) and take you into downtown as well. When my friend and I arrived we were greeted by Elise, another great and amazing co host that helped us settle in and meet Lisa's cute doggies. The room itself provides an awesome sleep away to heaven bed with utilities such as wifi, tv, personal refrigerator (thank you Lisa for the water and snacks btw!), microwave, couch, closet, and such. Our night was very pleasant in meeting Lisa, Elise and the pups for our first night in Seattle, we could not ask for anything more. This home provides more than just your typical bnb, it goes far and beyond! Thank you Lisa and Elise for providing such an amazing stay, Hope to see you both in the near future!    "
486829,6551448,2013-08-16,7953454,Robert,The room was clean and comfortable with an excellent location. Lisa was very helpful helping me find my way around the local area. This is a very nice place to stay and I would recommend it. Certainly if I was in the area I would stay there in the future.
486829,6576997,2013-08-17,2808857,Conny,"Lisa was a very nice host and the location was perfect for us.
I was thankful for the ear plugs in the room and the fact that
we could stay 1 night only to visit our son on the way to B.C.
Thanks Lisa
 "
486829,6640511,2013-08-19,8016766,Jennifer,"Lisa is a wonderful host. Throughout the booking process, she was extremely helpful and responsive, even providing us with great suggestions about what to do in the area. She was very accommodating with regards to our arrival time and made the check-in and check-out process painless. 

Lisa's house and the Cascadia Room were comfortable and inviting. My friend and I looked forward to returning every evening after our daytime adventures. It was a great knowing that we'd be coming back to a comfortable bed, internet, and TV. There is even a small refrigerator in the room, which came in handy for the fruit we brought.

Booking our stay with Lisa was a great experience from start to finish, and I highly recommend her place to anyone looking for an Airbnb in the Seattle area."
486829,6718409,2013-08-22,2170085,Kathleen,"Lisa is a wonderful host.  She really makes you feel at home. Her home is tastefully deteriorated.  The beds are very comfortable, I've been there twice.  I highly recommend her home as a place to stay in Seattle.
Floyd"
486829,6774853,2013-08-24,99856,Martha,Lisa was super accommodating even with our last-minute reservation request and late arrival. Comfortable and clean place for us to lay our heads!
486829,6831233,2013-08-26,2008142,Pooya,"This older house is in a nice neighbourhood in University District, and close to Downtown Seattle and other tourist attractions. Cascadia room has a queen bed, TV with cable, microwave, fridge, and other niceties you may expect from a B&B."
486829,6883668,2013-08-28,8241713,Lily,"Perfectly located for where we wanted to be. Right on the Burke Gilman Trail, which supplies easy walking and biking to grocery stores, shops, the university and hospitals. The room was clean and nicely decorated, as was the bathroom and rest of the house. Directions/instructions were clear. Key was provided for anytime-checkin. Would stay here again in a flash! Thanks."
486829,7735338,2013-10-01,6846051,Rachel,"Lisa was an absolute great host.  She was very accommodating and often went above and beyond to make our experience in Seattle great!  She was easy to get ahold of at all times and always promptly answered questions.  She really made us feel right at home.  She even cooked for us!!!  I can't say enough about her hospitality.  Additionally, the location was great!  Several close bus stops to get you anywhere you need to go in Seattle.  I would definitely recommend the Cascadia Room or any other room hosted by LIsa.  I can assure you, your experience will be better than you expect!"
486829,9778512,2014-01-09,10873694,Kyle,"This was a great spot to stay. Lisa was very friendly and really helped us out in learning more about Seattle, and what was to offer in the area. Super bed, quiet room with some extra commodities. Thanks for the Kona! Will stay again when we come back through."
486829,9811043,2014-01-11,3861163,Katie,"Wonderful to have a safe, comfortable, last minute housing option in Seattle. Lisa was quick to respond, incredibly friendly and flexible to accommodate our arrival. We found it very easy to take public transit from the airport; there are two grocery stores within walking distance from her home; and the home is a 30 second walk from the Burke Gilman Rails-to-Trails walking/running/cycling trail. What a way to start our time in Seattle!"
486829,9919903,2014-01-19,7761458,Kristin,"The most comfortable bed I've ever stayed in. Luxurious.  Nice, private spare room conveniently located in walking distance of Children's Hospital and a very nice grocery store. Not far from the interesting University things. Public transport appeared to be convenient (but I did not try it this time).

Room has fridge, hot water maker and microwave, and hostess shares her Keurig.
It was very quiet and private. The dogs do bark when you enter, but soon settle down."
486829,9988278,2014-01-23,10181073,Mary,"Lisa was very flexible about our nighttime arrival, and was very relaxed about letting us use her kitchen. The room was very comfortable, and the snacks and drinks she left for us made it feel like a bed and breakfast."
486829,10094863,2014-01-30,11368765,Joe,"Wonderful stay! This was my first time in a bed and breakfast, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I am so thankful I found Lisa's place. I was hoping for a quiet, comfortable, clean place that was near things to do...and Lisa's house provided that. I was not familiar with the area, so having Lisa help me with bus schedules, location, information, and local shops really helped ease the stress of an unfamiliar area. The house was cozy, clean, and the bed was unbelievably comfortable. Lisa is a cute, helpful, and gracious host. I would definitely stay with her again. "
486829,10302704,2014-02-11,188826,Ed,"Great location and VERY comfortable bed.  The house is very close to Children's Hospital and has easy access to local restaurants, etc.

"
486829,10406837,2014-02-17,12066576,Andrew,"Lisa is a very gracious host. I am very grateful and thankful that she allowed me to stay in her Cascadia Room for my brief stay in Seattle. The room was very nice, and I felt very comfortable.  I slept very well each night I stayed. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Lisa’s Cascadia Room, and it was a blessing having the opportunity to meet at talk with Lisa.  "
486829,10485231,2014-02-21,876371,Lucas,Lisa is a wonderful host and has a charming house in a centralized location. The room is homey and well-suited for my purposes. 
486829,12391202,2014-05-01,10970324,Eemeli,"We stayed at Lisa's place two months during spring. Our room was well equipped, with a TV, microwave and even a small fridge&freezer combination. Lisa was a very nice host and even bought us an extra electric heater during a cold week. The kitchen was well equipped although it was a tiny bit cramped. Lisa has two small dogs, and they got used to us right after we started playing with them and gave them a few snacks. I would suggest this place for anyone wanting to stay in a quiet neighborhood of Seattle that's quite close to the University of Washington. We had a good time and it was a very convenient location too."
486829,14104712,2014-06-11,6005176,Jeremy,"The house was in a great neighborhood close to Children's Hospital, a bike path and shopping. My communication with my host was clear and prompt. All expectations exceeded. Couldn't have asked for more. "
486829,14589234,2014-06-22,16975510,Jas,"So, this was my first time using Airbnb, and I would definitely used it again because Lisa made the experience great. First, she was very professional and thorough in providing me with information about the location and surrounding areas--even going as far as to provide detailed bus routes and maps. 

The place itself was very well kept and comfortable. She also spent some time with me explaining how everything worked. 

The neighborhood was also outstanding. As a law transfer student to UW, I found easy access to the places I needed to go. 

I highly recommend this place for old and new Airbnb'ers alike."
486829,14665532,2014-06-23,16800528,Ryo,"I just stayed only one night there, though, she was very kind to me and showed her good hospitality. "

486829,15636781,2014-07-13,14017854,Michael,"Having another sleep option at my sister's house, we decided not to stay in the Cascadia Room, as the bed surface was very high off the ground, too high for my wife's comfort. 

The listed room amenities included breakfast. My wife was told breakfast would be an energy bar. Maybe Airbnb should have a few breakfast categories under Amenities to provide more detail to potential guests.

Perhaps I'll have an opportunity to stay overnight in the future and provide a comprehensive review. "
486829,15738155,2014-07-14,1786717,Alejandro,"The bed was super comfortable, the house very nice and well-located, and Lisa was just a great host! She was very laid back and gave me everything I needed. She even lent me an iPhone charger since I forgot mine! I totally recommend staying here. "
486829,15899064,2014-07-17,17424376,Jerome,"Lisa was great and the place was great, too.  We felt very welcome and Lisa was very friendly and helpful.  She even gave us a little gift bag of souvenirs when we left.  We would be happy to stay with  her again."
486829,16213426,2014-07-23,16969777,Jennifer,Lisa was a great host. We weren't around that much as we had a lot planned for our time in Seattle but all the times we did interact she was very friendly! The room was exactly as described and the bed was really comfortable! 
486829,16670301,2014-07-31,2943961,Gurutze,"Lisa's place is really nice. The bedroom is full equipped, there is a microwave and a refrigerator; just say that the bed is pretty high -we didn't have any problem but maybe this may be a disadvantage for some guests-. Also she allowed us to use all the facilities of the house (kitchen, washing machine, dryer). The house is located in a quiet area close to the university. She has been really helpful to us. We really enjoyed our stay!

486829,16871307,2014-08-03,18403195,Diane,Lisa is a great host. The room was so comfortable and the location was great. Very quiet neighborhood and nice neighbors as well. I felt very welcome and relaxed.
486829,18497299,2014-08-27,19389150,Kimberly,"I'm an inexperienced airbnb traveler but have done a fair amount of Hospitality club and travel in general.  Lisa is definitely one of the best parts of this particular experience.  She will interact with you as little or as much as you want.  She's laid back and friendly but not in an intrusive way.  Her home and Cascadia room in particular were very comfortable for me.  You can treat this like a hotel room and close yourself up in your room and watch tv, read, or play on the internet when you are in your room. The television has cable and a Rokuku attached to it with access to Netflix.  The bed is high as others have said but I'm tall and it was fine for me.  Part of what makes it tall is a very thick foam topper which makes it more comfortable than many hotel beds I've slept on.  There's a microwave, fridge in the room and helpful dishes like cups and paper plates.  The neighborhood was easy to navigate with a bike/walking trail directly behind the property.  I loved the little vegan bakery down the street and walked to it several times.  Also, within walking distance are a couple of grocery stores in both directions.  The University if you don't mind a longish hike (over a mile) can also be walked to as well.  I had a car and tended to drive more often than walk.  There are buses that go by the house.  For those with a car driving to/from downtown is almost 5 miles but it's definitely heavy traffic to get there if you pick rush hour part of the day.  I also drove out to the Snoqualmie waterfall which was about 45 minutes away.  University Village is  about a mile away and worth hanging out for some shopping.   Her two cute chihuahua's are part of the experience.  She keeps them locked up when guests are around but will introduce them to you if you are open to dogs.  The bathroom is shared but she has a nice, neat orderly system for her guests where things stay nice and tidy.  After staying at Lisa's place I moved into a downtown hotel for a conference where I get the privilege of paying $26 a day for parking at Park Place (more at hotel) some fee for internet which ended up being completely down the first day and enormous throngs of daily traffic and people.  I already miss my airBnB home!"
486829,18639188,2014-08-29,20449047,Moataz,"Nice quite, neighborhood. Very welcoming host. She makes sure you feel as comfortable as you would feel in your house."
486829,18845163,2014-09-01,20381533,Lynn,It was very nice! Bed was comfy and Lisa is easygoing! We enjoyed our stay there :)
486829,20100505,2014-09-23,20292618,Sunil,"I had a great 10 day stay in Lisa's house in the Cascadia room. The room was comfortable, with a large king size bed, and well stocked with various amenities. I also had essentially  unimpeded access to the kitchen. Lisa was a great host: friendly and helpful in many ways, and now we've become good friends. Will definitely consider staying here again, and strongly recommend her to other AirBnb'ers looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
486829,21947100,2014-10-27,13887051,Adam Bradley,"Lisa is great - she is a true gem! She has two small dogs, who although not harmful, do bark a lot - so keep this in mind and how this will be for you. I had lots of access to the kitchen for cooking up food. Lisa was so kind to even have made us Pho soup one night. "
486829,36756554,2015-07-01,26187015,Michael,"I've got everything important for me: house facilities including kitchen, laundry room, rest room with shower - all worked perfectly! The wonderful little garden was an excellent place to spend time at the morning with cup of coffee and in the evening with self cooking dinner. I received all help and advices from very kind attitude hostess.   "
7050492,37901782,2015-07-11,36987303,Lida,"Jeff was great!  He meet us at the door and showed us around his place.  His home is clean and comfortable, and has a nice big window to enjoy the view of the city.  It also has a nice kitchen so you can cook instead of going out.  The complex also had a parking space available which was nice."
7050492,38455333,2015-07-15,1712249,Chris,"Jeff was a good host and very responsive in communications. Apartment was comfortable, safe and had all you'll need and want.  Great views and close to everything. No car rental needed. Airport Train ($3), Uber or 15 minute walks got me everywhere I needed to go.
"
7050492,38755774,2015-07-18,8104735,Ali,It was a great apartment in a great location! Close to everything we wanted to do.  Jeff was helpful and communicated very promptly! 
7050492,39803146,2015-07-26,15247067,Reesa,"Our stay with Jeff was fantastic!  He was extremely helpful and his place was exactly as pictured in his profile.  There are dozens of close by attractions, and you are about a $10 cab ride from anywhere else in the city you want to go.  I would definitely stay at Jeff's the next time we visit Seattle."
7050492,43180700,2015-08-17,3531171,Carlos,The place was as describe. It's well located. Bars and restaurants walking distance. Jeff was also really good at communication. We were happy about the experience :)
7050492,45139026,2015-08-31,39925258,Shelly,"This was my first ever AirBnB experience and if they are always as good as this I’ll never want to go back to a hotel! Jeff was the perfect host, his place was very comfortable and I’ll certainly be looking to stay there again next time I’m in town! Thanks Jeff!"
7050492,46554268,2015-09-11,32400579,Karen,"Really good views over Seattle to the Spaceneedle. We were prepared for traffic noise as a main artery of the North West economy runs below the balcony. The apartment has most things needed for a stay including wifi, It's easy to walk into the city from here or up to the water tower in volunteer park  and down to the docks or to lake union. We would stay again it's comfortable here and a good base. "
7050492,47101687,2015-09-15,6475666,Ryan,"Jeff was great. The place had everything we needed and some amazing views of downtown Seattle. We walked to pretty much everything from his place or took a short uber ride anywhere else. Jeff himself was easy to work with, communicated well, and was extremely flexible with us arriving and leaving. "
7050492,47450198,2015-09-18,9015601,Sarah,"Jeff's place was awesome! Great view and location. Super cool apartment. Jeff was super flexible and accommodating, too! Great communication."
7050492,48783743,2015-09-28,43189746,Bernease,"Jeff was a great host and very flexible with key pick up and return. Even after the flight was delayed and we had to move the key exchange at the last minute.

Everything was exactly as he said it was -- with some added surprises like coffee and use of his Netflix and HBO Go accounts. Would 100% suggest you pick this host."
7050492,52646572,2015-10-31,73310,Matt,"Jeff was a great host and his space is clean, spacious, and had a great view of downtown Seattle. It's located in the heart of Capital City and there are restaurants, bars, and coffee shops within short walking distances. I definitely would stay there again!"
7050492,57986261,2015-12-30,52583740,Max,"I had decided to take a last minute trip to Seattle from Portland and was lucky enough to find Jeff's listing available! He was very quick in responding to my booking request and very accommodating in person! His property is right on Capitol Hill with a stunning view of the city. Great location too- I was able to walk to many different bars in the area. The space itself was perfect! It was clean, had everything I could have wanted and more (including coffee which was my saving grace the next morning.)
Thanks, Jeff- you made my first AirBnB experience a great one!"
7535055,46403287,2015-09-10,41047504,Niko,We stayed at Eric's apartment from 9/4-9/9 and it was very clean and Eric was helpful throughout the whole process leading up to our stay. The apartment has an incredible view and is situated nicely in Capitol Hill and we had no trouble navigating our way around. Would definitely stay again!
7429207,43974640,2015-08-23,548179,Duncan,Brilliant host. Very easy to deal with and made us feel very welcome. The house itself was beautiful. 
4661374,54546963,2015-11-21,1276237,Vijay,Vinnette has a nice studio right near the heart of Belltown. She was very accommodating in that she took my reservation on short notice. She was communicative and quick to respond to my questions. She provided plenty of snacks and amenities (although I ended up not eating/using too many!). She also thoughtfully provided guides to the Seattle area and some of her own recommendations. I guess I am her first reviewer and I am happy to say it was a very pleasant stay!
4661374,56694770,2015-12-16,28867236,Victoria,loved staying here! this studio was adorable and in a great location. vinnette had everything I needed to make me feel at home. would definitely recommend her to anyone staying in Seattle! 
2809796,13265664,2014-05-23,13130135,Martin,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2809796,13982640,2014-06-09,13535371,Joe,The cottage worked great... We were able to enjoy a fire in the back yard and Kathleen was a great host!
2809796,14240155,2014-06-15,13064832,Lavina,"Wonderful! Adorable! Comfy space! 
This cottage is close enough you feel you are enjoying all Seattle has to offer yet far enough away you aren't annoyed by all the hustle of the city! 
Close to grocery stores, sports bars, the beach and so much more! We will be coming here anytime we make it back to Seattle! 
Kathleen is so warm and welcoming and accommodating! 
  "
2809796,14357586,2014-06-17,3111435,Amy,"Kathleen was excellent!!!! she greeted us when we came in late (because of the the plane and rental car), welcomed us, gave us a tour of the place, had all amenities there (and plenty of it!) everything was simple and easy. she was great I highly recommend her place - located in a nice section of Seattle close to downtown."
2809796,14923980,2014-06-29,15475164,Cassie,"My family loved our stay at the Garden Cottage. Kathleen was excellent at staying in touch and promptly returning any messages. She also met us the day of check-in to give us a tour of the cottage, inform us about local sightseeing, and how to keep in contact during our stay. The cottage is absolutely adorable. Very pristine, clean, well furnished, comfortable, and inviting.  It is located in a great location, very close to the West Seattle Bridge and also very close to Alki Beach with excellent views of Seattle. Kathleen's cottage is highly recommended."
2809796,15274691,2014-07-06,16550946,Jody,"Kathleen was a wonderful host! Fresh cut flowers and a bottle of wine were waiting when we walked into our darling cottage. So charming, clean, and comfortable. Loved sitting outside on the garden patio. Will love going back! Great deal!"
2809796,15776452,2014-07-15,17013053,Diella,"The cottage was perfect. My friends and I couldn't believe what an amazing find this is. We especially love the tea collection available for us. The kitchen is perfect if you want to save some money on your trip and cook in. This place is perfect if you're relying on public transportation in Seattle, multiple bus routes heading towards downtown plus a shuttle for the water taxi nearby. 

We highly recommend this place!"
2809796,15983067,2014-07-19,17420064,Deepak,"Wonderful host with quick response and very amenable.  Cottage was nice and clean in a safe neighborhood of West Seattle.  Easy drive to downtown Seattle and all the attractions.  I would definitely stay there again.  Much better than a hotel in that you get a kitchen, refrigerator and nice backyard to sit in the evenings.  "
2809796,16117948,2014-07-22,17149879,Bruno,"The cottage was great, perfect size for my wife and I.  The cottage shares a backyard with the house but they weren't out there, that we saw.  It had everything we needed for cooking and Kathleen offers any items from their house one may need.  Nice location, near enough to downtown but avoids the hustle/bustle and close to the hip Junction area.  Close to busline and free shuttle to downtown water taxi.  My wife said the bed could be more comfortable but I slept just fine.  Blackout curtains on some of the windows susceptible to outside light was a nice touch."
2809796,16273136,2014-07-24,18066068,Logan,"Kathleen was a wonderful host! She was incredibly responsive, seemed to have thought of everything we might need, and was always available to give advice for great things to do in Seattle. The cottage was very cute and I felt that we would have been happy staying there all summer long. The neighborhood is nice, feels safe, and is close to lots of good food and pretty walks around West Seattle. Parking was no issue. We greatly appreciated Kathleen as our host and would stay here again!"
2809796,17200754,2014-08-09,7834680,Bob,"Kathleen was very friendly and accommodating. She communicated well answering any questions we had promptly and made sure everything was ready when we arrived. 

I was surprised to find the cottage and yard much larger than what I had expected or gathered from the photos. It was located in a quiet neighborhood that we felt safe walking through (even late at night) and gave us some good exercise walking up (and down) the West Seattle hills! It was a very comfortable space that made us feel right at home.

I would definitely recommend this to friends and book the cottage again.  

"
2809796,17582825,2014-08-14,4609755,Sara,"Kathleen's little Garden Cottage was the perfect accommodation for us while we were in Seattle to watch the Mariners and Blue Jays, and Kathleen was the perfect host! She was flexible on our arrival time (we got caught up in traffic and decided to stop somewhere for dinner first), gave us a little tour and told us about transit to get around during our visit, and even left us a french press and local coffee to enjoy in the mornings. 

The cottage was clean and tidy, and equipped with everything we needed, including a washer/dryer which really came in handy during our 5 day visit. The area is very quiet which was nice after exploring the city during the day, and mornings spent enjoying a cup of coffee on the little patio in the backyard were very relaxing. Kathleen also invited us to enjoy the grapes that were growing on the vines out front, and tomatoes in the back. There were also wild blackberries growing just down the street which was a nice treat.

Getting around was very easy from this location. Transit is just a couple blocks away, as well as a free shuttle to the water taxi / alki beach area. We chose to drive downtown a couple of times too, which was just over the bridge. We also spent some time in West Seattle, along Alki beach and The Junction. There was also a 24 hour grocery store a short drive away.

We loved staying at Kathleen's cute little Garden Cottage, and would definitely stay there again. I wish we had more time to spend at the cottage! We highly recommend this accommodation to anyone wanting a quiet place to stay that is still close enough to everything.  And having a friendly, thoughtful host like Kathleen really made our first AirBnb experience a memorable one!
"
2809796,17653273,2014-08-15,19575485,Justin,We really enjoyed our stay.  Kathleen was super accommodating and the place was perfect.  We will try to stay here next time we visit Seattle.
2809796,18240726,2014-08-24,7106903,Amy,Great place! The cottage had everything we needed during our trip. Would definitely stay again. Close to the many sites of Seattle!
2809796,18442162,2014-08-26,19971892,Susan,"Our host, Kathleen was so accommodating.  She was very clear on everything we needed to know about locking up, the lights, lots of info on getting around Seattle. The space is a good size with lots of light and nice yard. It is in a great area, where you can walk along the shore and take the water taxi into Seattle, or its just a short drive across the bridge from her place.  She had coffee on the counter for morning with cream in the refrigerator (thank you very much!). And there was also a nice bottle of wine for us upon arrival, which was great.  We had just come from Mt. Vernon, with some bread we had gotten after a bakery tour and fresh cheese, so that wine was a nice surprise. There were two beds, one for my friend and I took the twin bed, very comfortable. It was spacious and open, very comfortable.  I would come back again."
2809796,18599748,2014-08-28,12805590,Amy,"Lovely little cottage, great location being close to downtown but nice and quiet. We had a great stay!"
2809796,18730001,2014-08-31,18257932,Pamela,"Great cottage in a quiet but convenient neighborhood. The cottage is equipped with everything you may need. We didn't have a car, but the location is close to bus stations that took us downtown in just 10-15 minutes. Kathleen the host is super friendly and accommodating, would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Seattle."
2809796,19229685,2014-09-08,7008250,Sarah,"Kathleen was very accommodating with arrival time, which was very helpful.  The place is very cute and has everything you need for a few days stay.  Great neighborhood with a couple local restaurants within walking distance.   Uber was $10-$15 into the city or we had the option of the water taxi.  "
2809796,19451663,2014-09-12,13177767,Mark,"We had a very good time and she 
is very kind and a helpful person.
You can contact her any time and she will guide you if you need. Place was nice and clean."
2809796,20154084,2014-09-24,14632143,Roger,"Kathleen was a superb host, trying her best to provide us with whatever we needed, and very friendly."
2809796,33313216,2015-05-26,33400861,Janna,"Our flight was delayed for many hours, but Kathleen, even at 5 months pregnant was gracious enough to wait up for us to give us the grand tour!  The listing description was on point!  We walked through wooden garden gates which help provide privacy from the neighbors and street views.  The kitchen was fully stocked with every utensil you would need during the stay.  Kathleen greeted us with a bottle of wine and freshly cut flowers on the counter and dining table.  The beds were comfortable, and there was plenty of storage and seating space.  The new addition of the smart TV for late night Netflix was a major plus!  The washer and dryer were very handy.  We adored the full size bathroom which had shampoo and such.  The backyard was super comfortable to enjoy some morning coffee or snack.  The gardens are a welcome to take in over hotel walls for sure!  Kathleen was super knowledgeable of the surroundings and gave excellent recommendations.  We found the nearest grocery store, (QFC) only 5 minutes away and bought a few food supplies so we did not have to eat out every night and afternoon.  We made sandwiches and found parks to enjoy afternoon picnics.  We took a stroll around the neighborhood and felt completely safe while checking out the local art and architecture of the homes.  The beach is not too far either which holds amazing views of downtown.  We had a rental so there was plenty of space in the driveway to park.  But we also took Uber pick ups which were always within 3-6 minutes.  This helped to save money on parking downtown.  This is a good location to feel at home even when visiting a big city.  We would definitely love to come back and visit and stay here again!  Very affordable!"
2809796,34961926,2015-06-14,6276634,Nate,Kathleen made us feel very welcome and comfortable. This is a great place to stay with kids! Our family of 4 (3 year old and 4 month old) loved this place. The backyard is also a bonus. Great location! The kitchen and ability to do laundry was huge for us.
2809796,35671116,2015-06-21,900166,Merry,"We just got back from an incredible five days in Seattle for our daughter's wedding. The garden cottage provided exactly what we needed. A self-contained place to stay where we could relax, do laundry, cook, and as an added bonus it was so cute and picturesque that our daughter's photographer took the first pictures of the bride in her dress in the garden. Physically, the cottage was exactly as described; fully stocked with anything you could think of needing. The bed was very comfortable. The huge closet is such a plus. The location was ideal for us; it was quiet and felt very safe. We would love to book it again for future trips to Seattle."
2809796,35979263,2015-06-23,35908629,Rachel,My two other teaching friends and I arrived at the cottage after a long days drive.  We were hoping to have a good place to rest that was close to the city.  The cottage more than exceeded our expectations.  It was quiet and the inside felt like a retreat.  The pictures did not do it justice.  We spent most of our time in the city which was a short and somewhat cheap uber ride.  This is definitely a place you should stay.
2809796,37332509,2015-07-06,34354566,Karly,"Cottage was comfortable and nicely decorated, and a last minute AC unit to combat the heat wave was a welcome surprise. Bottle of wine upon arrival was a nice touch also."
2809796,37772900,2015-07-10,35732917,Alexander,The space is perfectly advertised and cozy. A perfect home base for a week of exploring Seattle. Everything we needed was provided. An airconditioning unit was a pleasent suprise.
2809796,38279301,2015-07-14,27973047,Veronica,Sparkling water and wine in the fridge! She also kept our bags until check in time as we arrived in the morning.
2809796,38563239,2015-07-16,20576827,Mériam,Kathleen has been a perfect host. She made sure I have access to the cottage despite my (very) late arrival. The cotttage is very clean and well appointed. It is perfect if you are here to work and need a quiet space but you definitely have enough space for 3 persons. She also gave me a ride to the best Thai place I experienced after my day of work. A must-have for the smoothest trip to Seattle.
2809796,38715027,2015-07-18,33500167,Joan,"The cottage was exactly as presented. It was comfortable and cheerful, and very well equipped. Since we had family in West Seattle, the location was very convenient for us. Kathleen was the perfect host- she checked in with  us to make sure we were settled in, and then gave us privacy. We were very happy with the accommodations."
2809796,39930470,2015-07-27,20828775,Jenny,"Kathleen provided all the details promptly and in a kind manner. She followed up as well to ensure that we had everything we needed to enjoy our stay. 

The cottage was clean, cozy, very private, and it had a very comfortable bed. We loved it!"
2809796,40361335,2015-07-30,25856444,Kim,We had a great time at the garden cottage! Kathleen made us feel right at home. It had everything we needed for our 4 day stay. I highly recommend and would stay again!
2809796,42211030,2015-08-11,24494033,Colin,"Kathleen was a great host, and had no problem communicating with her. The place was exactly as listed. Nice little neighborhood that was close to downtown, but still had beaches and all sorts of cute little restaurants around. The on site washing and private entry were fantastic."
2809796,43274380,2015-08-18,39218081,Stéphane,"What a lovely romantic cottage. 
The location is perfect, easy to park, close to a fantastic beach side and easy to go downtown with the water taxi.
Our host Kathleen is wonderfull, always make sure we have everything and help us to get around her lovely neighbourhood.
We definitly recomand this place.

Thank you so much Kathleen for this enjoyable stay

Corine and stephane "
2809796,43673672,2015-08-21,28701714,Stephanie,"I cannot recommend staying here enough! Kathleen was so nice and helpful and responsive. And although her and her family live right next door, they totally respected our privacy. We took her up on both of her food recommendations and she nailed it. 

The space itself is the perfect airbnb: cozy, clean, bright, but with so many comforts of home. We did have a car and were only in town for a day, so the location was not a huge factor for us, but I can say it was convenient to downtown and the restaurants she recommended were barely a 5 minute drive. 

If you are thinking about booking, do it! "
2809796,44352317,2015-08-25,3906467,Karena,"Kathleen's cottage was wonderful, clean, and convenient to get to downtown Seattle. It's on a quiet residential street but close to the main area of west Seattle as well. Kathleen was super nice and her cottage had everything we needed, clean towels and toiletries, and a soft warm bed! Plenty of space and even outdoor space. I would definitely stay here again if coming to Seattle in the future! "
2809796,45471891,2015-09-03,36930280,Simon,The house was exactly what we were looking for. Close to the city and very private. Kathleen was very friendly and helpful with recommending places to visit. Would definitely  stay here again in a future visit!
2809796,45795874,2015-09-06,38496289,Molly,The garden cottage was absolutely adorable! I have no complaints. Incredibly comfortable bed and the perfect size for 1-3 people! Kathleen was wonderful and accommodating. I would absolutely stay here again and I have already recommended it :) 
2809796,47155642,2015-09-16,32805922,Xavier,"Kathleen was such an amazing hostess! After having to change my flight, my husband ended up spending the first night of our vacation alone in Seattle, and Kathleen had the cottage ready with a bottle of wine and gave him suggestions for great places to eat and hang out. Kathleen also allowed us to pick some of the grapes that were growing on her vines which were extremely delicious! 

The cottage itself was adorable and had all of the amenities you would want in a vacation home-comfortable and clean bedding, utensils, seasoning, sparkling water, a washer and dryer, etc. and the cottage itself was in a great location-close to Alki Beach and only a seven minute drive from downtown Seattle. We will definitely stay with Kathleen when we go back to Seattle next year!"
2809796,48212999,2015-09-24,4040671,Annie,"Kathleen was a great host! She was very accommodating, gave us a tour of the place, and offered great recommendations for the area! Our stay was very comfortable and clean! Was comfortable for 3 people. She did awesome responding quickly and making us feel right at home. She even had a bottle of wine for us! Great stay! "
2809796,49230360,2015-10-02,40436842,Chloe,I love this house! The style is so cute and warm! The land lord is so nice people and I saw their sweetie daughter~Everything  is neat and completed. The transportation also convenient. Those all comfortable for guests stay! This Seattle of trip is so impressive!
2809796,49536613,2015-10-04,30679400,Yoshi,"閑静な住宅街にある、きれいなコテージです。シアトルのダウンタウンに夜遅くまで居てもコテージまで近いのが魅力的です。ただ夜暗くなってから戻る場合、車のナビは必須です。West Seattle Bridgeを渡る時に途中で少し迷ってしまいました。チェックアウト時間が12時なのは良い点です。朝はゆっくり朝食の時間を取る事が出来ました。
また利用してみたいと思います。"
2809796,50545939,2015-10-12,44041763,Tara,"The cottage was exactly as described ! Very comfortable and had all the comforts of home: full kitchen, washer/dryer.  It fit the three of us perfectly. Kathleen was very accommodating and responsive. I had a red eye flight out and she kept my bags for me until I was ready to get to the airport. The cottage was super close to downtown and the airport. Very quiet and cute little place, would stay again!"
2809796,52134879,2015-10-26,46235385,Matt,"The cottage was wonderful! The bed was comfy, there was complimentary coffee to brew, and Kathleen was great. This was my first AirBnB, and now I'm spoiled. "
2809796,57060804,2015-12-21,11909092,Acacia,"Kathleen was great!  She was very welcoming and even accommodated and early check-in for us! The place is super charming, and she leaves it stocked with tea, and even a bottle of wine.  The cottage offers privacy and comfort.  "
2809796,57225444,2015-12-23,8922610,Robert Reinhardt,"Kathleen has a great place for settling in either after your trip or following a day in Seattle.  The ease of getting in and out of Seattle was SO convenient!  She has everything you need!!
  Thank you, Kathleen.  And thank you to your polite son who answered the door, too!"
2727808,12578250,2014-05-05,8870268,Dan,Rose was a great host. Super accommodating of our special requests. The location is GREAT for walking to the Fremont neighborhood in Seattle!
2727808,13760072,2014-06-03,15527348,Peter,Very cute converted garage with loft sleeping area.  Was comfortable and provided all we needed for our weekend stay in Seattle.  Very close to public transportation and the heart of the Fremont district.  The host was very sweet and accommodating.  
2727808,14125550,2014-06-12,15239881,Alix,"My boyfriend and I stayed for 5 days at the cottage. It was just as described, if not better. The cottage itself is very cute and cozy and thoughtfully designed. There are many thoughtful and artistic details that add to the experience, including beautiful wooden beams and skylight and a lovely view into the garden area of the backyard. The kitchen is fully stocked, which is nice for cooking. We loved Fremont! It's an artsy area with many veg-friendly restaurants, pubs, walking trails (which you can take to the Ballard Sunday market), and a great Sunday market. It was also easy to bus to downtown Seattle, as well as taking public transit to and from the airport. Rose Michelle is a kind and gracious host who was very understanding when we arrived later than we expected on Friday night; she also gave us some advice on driving in the area and how to get to the ferries (check out the islands to the north of the city if you can!). A wonderful place to stay!"
2727808,14482542,2014-06-20,16070289,Mike,"What a perfect little getaway! Busses, GREAT food and coffee just steps away. Rose is very sweet and allows you to set the level of interaction. We went to coffe and had a lovely chat! Like staying with extended family in Seattle very highly recomended. "
2727808,14878560,2014-06-28,14990842,Joel,"Cozy is the perfect word! Everything you need and a quiet spot to relax. Rose was awesome! Super nice and I would definitely stay here again. The neighborhood is also excellent, easy to get anywhere in Seattle and has everything you need (grocery, coffee shops, a few restaurants and bars for local fun!) "
2727808,15261237,2014-07-06,9636816,Mo,"Everything about this space worked great for our stay in Seattle. Location was fantastic. Using the public transportation from the cottage was a breeze. Although we spent a majority of the time exploring Fremont and downtown, the space was more than spacious enough for the two of us. 

Most important of all Rose Michelle and her faithful sidekick Melissa were BEYOND accommodating hosts. They went above and beyond any expectations I've ever had of an Airbnb host. Wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. "
2727808,15459503,2014-07-09,16598660,Kiley,"The cottage is perfect for a couple looking to explore the city; the between easy access to mass transit and two great neighborhoods within walking distance we were almost never there. 

While there is a lot of fantastic food in the neighborhood we enjoyed having the kitchen (and french press!) available for breakfast and snack prep. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Rose Michelle, but her backup Melissa was a fantastic host. We would not hesitate to recommend the cottage to friends taking a trip to Seattle. 

"
2727808,15817967,2014-07-16,14515074,Paul,"Very good experience.
Excellent communications with host and associate.
Very clean and well taken care; good and safe location.
Small but efficient and affordable."
2727808,16119551,2014-07-22,17202037,Jennifer,"We stayed at the fremont cottage for three nights and really enjoyed it. If you enjoy long walks it's 3 miles to the space needle, and you can take a taxi home for $15 bucks. The cottage was clean and looked as pictured. We would stay here again. "
2727808,17346155,2014-08-11,9078881,Peggy,"This was the best AirBnB we have stayed in. Great communications from Rose and everything was just as described. It's well cared for and so clean. The kitchen is beautifully set up and has everything you might need. Rose even has the place stocked with some basics and we have never had shampoo and soap supplied. The outdoor space was delightful. There is easy on street parking in a great neighborhood. It's a short walk to the Rapid bus to downtown and the regular bus stops just two blocks away. There is a great small grocery around the corner. Also the restaurants just a few blocks away on Fremont are excellent. I recommend the black and blue milkshake from Unneeda Burger and the meal we had at Rock Creek was amazing. Its a short walk or bus ride down the hill into Fremont, which is loaded with charm. I can't wait for our next trip to Seattle we will be staying here again. I could not write a review and not mention Louie, the sweetest cat on the planet, he made us feel right at home and we miss him. "
2727808,18484236,2014-08-27,6246162,Beth,"Rose Michelle has created a truly unique Airbnb experience.  Once you step inside the Freemont Cozy Cottage, it’s evident how much thought and effort has gone into providing travelers with a well-appointed and inviting space.  Everything about the cottage is darling.  The location is perfect for exploring Seattle.  Rose Michelle is an exceptional host and goes above and beyond to ensure a comfortable stay.  Nick and I look forward to our next visit in this sweet and cozy space! "
2727808,18883029,2014-09-02,10584300,Catherine,"Rose Michelle hosted my boyfriend and I for a 5 night stay in Seattle and everything was just perfect! Before our stay, Rose Michelle was easy to contact and she provided just the right amount of communication prior to and during our trip. 

It was very important to Rose Michelle that we felt welcomed, and I am so happy we were able to enjoy her lovely cottage.  She made us feel at home and was available if we needed anything, but respected our privacy as well. The cottage is so cute and cozy; it was perfect for two people. We found it was so convenient to have a full kitchen and we all the amenities we could need. The entire space was updated, neat and tidy.  

The Fremont location was fantastic- close enough to downtown for the activities we had planned and a very charming area with plenty of restaurants, and coffee shops for convenience. We went on several runs/walks around Greenlake Park, and thoroughly enjoyed the neighborhood. We also had a rental car and there was never any issues parking on the street.

I would not hesitate to stay with Rose Michelle again and would certainly recommend her cottage to anyone! "
2727808,19222477,2014-09-08,20229349,Melissa,"This cottage was even cuter than I thought it would be! My boyfriend and I had an amazing one week stay to explore Seattle for the first time. This place was perfect. It had everything that we needed and more! My boyfriend actually got sick on the first day, and to our surprise, the kitchen was stocked with various kinds of tea and a cute little kettle! We had a great vacation here. It is also very close to all of the major Seattle attractions and in the cute Fremont neighborhood. The host was kind and was not at all intrusive; but she would be there if you needed anything, like an extra blanket, etc. I would recommend this place to anyone! It's definitely better than paying $200 a night at a hotel with half of the amenities!"
2727808,19480467,2014-09-13,2649503,Carolyn,"The host made my husband and I feel extremely welcome; she even arranged for us to arrive early and leave our bags at the flat so we could explore the area; we were able to complete check in at the same time and come back later in the day.  

The neighborhood is fabulous.  Quiet street but just a few blocks from easy public transportation downtown or to the U. Wash, to great restaurants, grocery, laundry, coffee shops, biking trails.  The cottage is exactly as pictured -- it is small but oh so functional -- just perfect for two people.  Kitchen has a great gas stove,  refrigerator, sink, dishes, etc.  

VERY clean and lovely little yard.  Perfect spot for exploring anywhere in Seattle (by bus, by bike, by car -- parking on the street looked easy).  This is a fabulous spot, run by a warm, kind and generous host.  We highly recommend staying here!

Also - the bed is super comfortable!!  Great sleeping which made for good energy to explore and enjoy the city. "
2727808,19678468,2014-09-16,12009681,Amy,"This cottage was perfect for a long weekend in Seattle. Rose Michelle was very kind and easy to reach when needed. Though it may or may not become a regular feature of the rental, she even lent us a bike for exploring the area. As it turns out, this is a wonderful way to branch out from N. Fremont. Everything in the cozy cottage was thoughtfully combined and truly exceeded my expectations."
2727808,19821744,2014-09-19,13893649,Daniel,"We loved staying in Rose Michelle's cottage. The neighborhood is fantastic with great coffee a block away to start the day. I had the best Cuban sandwich I've had at Paseo which is around the corner from the cottage. Never had an issue finding parking near the address. Transportation is easy by bus to downtown. Cool bars and restaurants down the hill into the heart of Fremont with a slight uphill walk back after a night of eating and drinking. This location seemed central to all the neighborhoods in Seattle. We were able to spend time in Fremont, Ballard, Wallingford, University, and downtown. The place is unique, block is quiet and Rose Michelle is the perfect host and a kind person. You can tell she has put love into the cottage and to make it more than comfortable for guests. And of course, we loved visiting in the yard with Louie the cat, so friendly. No doubt in my mind, if I made another trip to Seattle, I would stay at the cottage again."
2727808,20089133,2014-09-23,18516645,Erika,"My husband & I stayed at Rose Michelle's cottage for 4 nights while visiting Seattle. We enjoyed our stay greatly! We arrived pretty late our first night and she was accommodating and left us the key to the cottage and then met with us the next morning. The cottage was cute, plenty of space for the 2 of us, very clean. Rose Michelle's kitty, Louie, hangs out in the backyard often and we enjoyed giving him some pets & attention. We loved having the French press & coffee grounds provided and made some almost every morning! You could certainly cook a full meal in the kitchen if you wanted to. The neighborhood/area is great. We were within walking distance of everything in Fremont, Theo's Chocolate, numerous restaurants & bars, etc. Downtown proper is not very far and public transport seemed numerous, though we did have a rental car. One note if you do have a car: parking can be kind of dicey. We generally were able to find street parking near the cottage, but brush up on those parallel parking skills if you are not from the city! "
2727808,20263700,2014-09-26,14797238,Paul,"Rose was very welcoming and easy to communicate with while making arrangements. I stayed for three nights, and really enjoyed the cozy (and *very* clean) little cottage - it was just as described. 
There are a number of excellent restaurants just two short blocks away, and plenty more down the hill in Fremont proper. 
Overall I had a great experience and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
2727808,20437051,2014-09-29,20672844,Kseniya,"Had a wonderful stay at the cottage. Our first time in Seattle, and fremont was a great neighborhood for home base. Lots of delicious places to eat around, and right next to a bus line to downtown. The cottage itself was charming, Rose Michelle and Louie the sweet cat were very welcoming "
2727808,20663052,2014-10-03,12538900,Ellen,"What a lovely cottage!!  Very clean, well-lit, comfortable, good wi-fi, and convenient.  Nice walk to the main streets of Fremont, and one block to both grocery store and a very quick bus to downtown Seattle.  Well-equipped kitchen, privacy, very comfortable bed - I was there for 4 days and lacked for nothing."
2727808,21596356,2014-10-20,21248003,Drew,"My fiancée and I were in Seattle for a friend's wedding, and stayed in this adorable cottage. Rose Michelle was a very gracious host, laid back and made the introduction and settling in painless.

The Fremont neighborhood that the cottage is located in has a lot to offer in terms of little coffee shops and tasty restaurants, and is generally accessible to the rest of Seattle via bus (if you happen to be driving then even easier, however we chose not to have a car and this worked out just fine).

The little loft bunk area in the cottage was really cozy and extremely romantic, and the layout still feels open and not claustrophobic.

I would highly recommend this stay. The price and charm make this option a superb alternative to a local hotel."
2727808,22028204,2014-10-28,16327267,Matt,"Rose was an excellent host and we had a great time in what was a fun neighborhood of Seattle. The cottage was very comfortable, clean and  conveniently located. Rose was easy to contact and was even able to accommodate our early arrival.

Thanks Rose! "
2727808,23015137,2014-11-20,15109166,Bill,"Rose Michelle was great.  Our flight into Seattle was delayed 3 times, ultimately culminating in us arriving well after midnight.  She was kind enough to start the heater for us so we could crawl into a nice warm bed in a cozy cottage when we finally did arrive.

The next morning we met with her (and Louis!) and she gave us some great tips on places in the neighborhood to check out.

The cottage is exactly as pictured: clean, comfortable, fully stocked.  Some folks may have a hard time getting up to the loft bed, but you probably could have figured that out on your own.  It also warms up quickly, which was nice for a couple San Diegans visiting Seattle in mid-November :)

The cottage is also pretty conveniently located.  Great coffeeshop and diner re staying."
2727808,23367925,2014-11-30,9905115,Jean,"We felt welcomed to Fremont Cozy Cottage, a light-filled and comfortable abode. Cottage was perfectly located to use public transportation. We cooked in or walked to nearby coffee shops, grocery, and restaurants.
It was a great first adventure to Seattle.
"
2727808,23764342,2014-12-09,22164056,Jordan,"Rose Michelle was a wonderful host! She welcomed us, and then left us to start our short vacation in Seattle. The cottage was the perfect size for us (even got our wheels turning about how easy it would be for us to live in a small space someday), and contained all of the amenities we could need. Hot shower? Check. Enjoying a cup of tea at the table while rain hits the skylight? Check. Lovely neighborhood that was a great hub for getting around on the bus? Check.

All in all, a wonderful place for us to rest after long days of exploring.
(And, we had breakfast at nearby ""Ha!"" twice... the eggs benedict and mimosas were stellar!)"
2727808,23880632,2014-12-13,13096314,Mary,"The cottage is absolutely lovely, and so is Rose Michelle. It is the most cozy, warm, and inviting space, and Rose Michelle has supplied it with everything that you could possibly think of needing. One of my favorite airbnb experiences. I will definitely be staying here again the next time that I am in Seattle. "
2727808,24011562,2014-12-16,9746536,Debbie,"Rose Michelle was a great communicator, fast feedback, answered all questions!  Great location, very cozy, very clean accommodation, easily accessible to everything, very bike-able!  Had a great weekend in Seattle, thanks Rose Michelle!"
2727808,24472126,2014-12-29,22695647,Grant,"The cottage was clean, cozy and very well equipped. There really wasn't anything we missed from the comforts of home. Lovely stay. And Rose was great. Always willing to help but never in the way. I highly recommend!"
2727808,25014603,2015-01-05,22734703,Nis,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Rose's cottage, and would definitely consider it for our future visits to Seattle. 

This is a cheerful sort of place, well-designed, bright and tidy -- actually, it's immaculately clean -- nicely equipped if you plan to do your own cooking, located in a quiet neighborhood. 

Rose welcomed us on arrival and then politely left us to our own devices. The wi-fi connection was good, there was an excellent coffee shop just two blocks away (but where in Seattle can't you say that?). The bathroom has a nice shower with a tub, one of the reasons we chose this apartment, and there's just the right amount of storage for a one-week stay. 

If you're considering this place, we'd offer only one bit of advice to guide your thinking: You will need to be spry enough to climb  the little ladder to the comfy loft bed -- and also to clamber down for a bathroom visit in the middle of the night. This was no problem for us, but might possibly be for some.

All and all, this was a delightful home base for our week in Seattle. Thank you, Rose Michelle, for putting so much thought and care into this place, and for making it available on airbnb!"
2727808,25369580,2015-01-13,24882622,Sean,"The property was great. The location was great. Rose was great. The kitchen is fully functional, which was nice since there is a market less than ten minutes away. The neighborhood of Fremont is very laid back and you can explore everything it has to offer within walking distance from the cottage. Highly recommend!"
2727808,25600381,2015-01-20,8619933,Anne & Andy,"Rose Michelle's cottage was clean, cozy, warm and walking distance to all of the fun spots in Fremont District. We highly recommend her spot.

Rose Michelle always responded to our emails in a timely manner. Upon our arrival, Rose Michelle came by and asked if we needed anything. She made everything easy and we definitely appreciated that while on vacation.

Thanks Rose Michelle!"
2727808,26258721,2015-02-08,15884403,Megan,"The cottage was perfect for a week in Seattle!  The location is great for accessing the Fremont area, with easy bus links to other parts of the city.  I was in town for work, and the cottage was the perfect respite after a long day and also provided a good working space with wifi access.  Rose Michelle greeted me on arrival, and was kindly available if needed during my stay.  I would definitely stay here again when back in the Seattle area. "
2727808,26390277,2015-02-11,10364482,Joe,"What a great little cottage! It was as expected--newish and cozy--great for a couple. Rose Michelle was very accommodating to our situation (we had to take an earlier train because of a mud slide) and the neighborhood was really fun and accessible: two coffee shops around the corner, a nice little grocery store, rapid ride bus stops, bars, and more. We would definitely return!"
2727808,26690072,2015-02-17,23833966,Samuel,Amazing time! The cottage was absolutely perfect. Great location and rose was very helpful. We had a great weekend and I would say this is the best bnb we've stayed in. Thanks rose!
2727808,26843140,2015-02-20,21488253,Sarah,"The Fremont cozy cottage is just that, a cozy cottage, and more. It has everything you could need for traveling solo or as two. The cottage itself is nice and private and its location is perfect for zipping practically anywhere in Seattle. Rose Michelle was so very helpful. She has truly thought out the guest experience and is so kind and accommodating. I would, hands down, return to this little cottage. It was a mini home away from home. "
2727808,27320753,2015-03-02,1135839,Greg,"We had a great stay in Rose Michelle's cottage! The apartment had a nice cozy layout, and was stocked with everything we needed. The neighborhood had a warm vibe (we especially liked nearby 'Ha!'), and was close to downtown Seattle. Having our rental car was useful, but we noticed there were a few bus stops close by. And finally, Rose Michelle was an excellent host (as was her lovely cat)."
2727808,28303477,2015-03-22,26063323,Daniel,"This was absolutely one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had. Every aspect of my partner and myself's stay was perfect. The close proximity to downtown, restaurants, coffee shops and the zoo were all but a brief moment away from us. From the beautiful flowers and plants just out the window, to the morning light through the skylight, every aspect of our stay here was like a dream. Rose gave us every accommodation we could think of and helped us with any questions we had. This cottage is a warm, clean and cozy place that makes you feel at home the instant you arrive. Our stay here was the first stay my partner and I have ever had in Seattle and I believe I speak for the both of us when I say I wouldn't want to stay in any other place in Seattle before this one.
The memories I have had here, in just the span of a week, will last me a lifetime. I am so grateful that I have had the chance to stay here and hope to come back many times more."
2727808,28881101,2015-03-31,240339,Andrea,"Perfect location for a long weekend stay in Seattle (stayed 4 nights for a conference downtown). The neighborhood is VERY walkable. Great places to eat and have coffee in Fremont, Ballard, Phinney Ridge, or Greenlake. Or a couple blocks either way down the street. Bus connection to downtown or U-district super easy as there are multiple options. Rose Michelle was very welcoming. I only saw her once when I arrived. I felt I could have easily gotten in touch with her if I needed to but didn't need to. The cottage is super cute. Just right. Took me a couple of nights to fight the light switch for the loft. Everything works great. Cute little kitchen. Thank you!"
2727808,29068368,2015-04-03,3899930,Ariel,"A lovely, clean, and we'll kept cottage. Exactly as advertised.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
2727808,29419760,2015-04-07,14060060,Laura,"I really enjoyed my stay at Rose Michelle's cottage. The location is fantastic...lots going on that is walkable in the Fremont neighborhood, great restaurants, coffee shops, etc. The bus to center city Seattle stops close by so getting around is easypeasy. I did have a rental car and thankfully parking was available and free . Rose Michelle was really nice, welcoming and available. The cottage was quiet and a lovely place to hang out and plan my time in while in Seattle. Would recommend it highly! "
2727808,29794622,2015-04-12,4812224,Daniel,"Rose was very kind from her very first response and accommodated me the same night, even though I reached out to her that afternoon — thank you Rose! The cottage is very cozy, and although it’s small, it’s got everything you need — kitchen, dining table, couch and comfy loft. Rose’s instruction sheet is very detailed and talks about about how to handle the gas heater, the fan, and all things garbage & recycling. The Wi-Fi is also decent and allowed me to work from the cottage for one day.

The neighborhood is easily reachable from downtown Seattle in 30min and offers great food with Uneedaburger, Paseo, and Pecado Bueno.

I would not hesitate to stay at Rose’s cottage anytime :)"
2727808,29986703,2015-04-15,7056782,Sean,"From initial contact to checking out, Rose was responsive and very kind. The cottage is very cozy and has everything you need, including a kitchen, dining table, couch and comfy bed. I would definitely book this cottage when I'm next in Seattle."

2727808,31610610,2015-05-07,5414928,Alexandra,"Rose Michelle's place was perfect for our Seattle stay. The cottage itself has everything you need and is the perfect size for two! We loved sleeping in the ""nest"" as we called it up in the loft. The area is great, coffee shops in walking distance and really the perfect home base for exploring Seattle and beyond! We stayed here for 5 nights and would stay here again next time we're in Seattle! "
2727808,32070700,2015-05-13,13478398,Cher,"Rose Michelle's cottage was just perfect for my stay in Seattle.  It was just as quaint and adorable as the pictures show, and immaculate as well, and Rose Michelle was a wonderful host, easy to work with on every level.  Don't miss my favorite spot for coffee - Lighthouse Roasterie, just around the corner.  This cottage is a quiet get-away tucked in a great neighborhood!"
2727808,32328485,2015-05-17,13960017,Tonya,Rose was great.  She greeted us on our arrival and showed us around.  The area is great and the little apartment is awesome.  We have no complaints about the place.  We were glad to have wifi and the Fremont area was great for food.
2727808,38931960,2015-07-19,3411307,Wes,Rose was our ideal host for our trip up to Seattle. She was genuinely interested in making sure our stay was pleasant and that we had everything we needed. We always enjoy our stay in the Fremont area as it's one of our favorite areas in Seattle. The proximity of the cottage to restaurants and coffee shops makes it one of our new favorite spots to stay!
2727808,42267516,2015-08-12,34392907,Paul,"Rose Michelle was very welcoming and we trully enjoyed the cozy garden house. Everything was impeccable, so many great amenties were provided (coffee, kitchenware, shampoo etc.) and we trully felt at home.

The neighbourhood was great with nice places to eat and have a drink. We would gladly come back."
2727808,44564986,2015-08-27,40286900,Kelsey,"Rose Michelle's place was great. The cottage is cozy, clean, comfortable and well stocked. The location is perfect - a quick bus ride to downtown and a easy trip from the airport by transit. The neighbourhood is full of great restaurants and a grocery store for all your eating needs. Rose Michelle was great, easy to get ahold of and lots of help. Highly recommend this place!"
2727808,48175637,2015-09-24,14816869,Daniel,"Wow. What a perfect place to stay. The cottage was exactly the way it looked in the pictures. Which needless to say it was great! Everything was immaculate and all that you could possibly need was provided. The neighborhood had plenty of restaurants and a good market all within a short walk 

Rose made me feel welcomed from the moment I arrived. When I had to say goodbye after the 8 days I spent it was like saying goodbye to a good friend. Thanks for everything Rose Michelle!"
2727808,48561805,2015-09-27,6888041,Samael,Rose's cottage is clean and warm. She is a considerable hostess and we enjoyed our vacation so much.
2727808,49618689,2015-10-05,41209594,Jay,"Great place to stay on a visit to Seattle. Conveniently located. The cottage was very comfortable and clean. Rose Michelle had all the little details dialed...great coffee for the french press, nice toiletries, and the like. Would not hesitate to stay here again."
2727808,50441205,2015-10-12,38961261,Maya,"This was our first trip to Seattle and the Fremont Cozy Cottage was the perfect spot for us!  It is very clean and well-cared for, and we used the kitchen every day, which had everything we needed.  There was plenty to do just blocks away, but the best part was the bus stop literally around the corner.  In 10 minutes, we could get to the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, shopping, restaurants, and many other hotspots.  

Rose Michelle was a thoughtful host who left local publications for us about things going on in the city, and touched base before we left to make sure everything went well during our stay.  We would definitely stay with her again.  "
2727808,54147197,2015-11-16,14080475,Kevin,Rose was very accessible and was able to answer all of my questions in order to make my stay at her Cottage very enjoyable.
2727808,54984430,2015-11-27,204160,Jennifer,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at RoseMichelle's Fremont cottage. The location was excellent - close to several bars and restaurants, a Cafe Vita down the street, and the bus into the city was right around the corner. The cottage was the perfect size for a couple...it was clean and welcoming and had all of the amenities you need. RoseMichelle was a great host. I would definitely recommend staying at the cottage; my husband and I are hoping to stay there again. "
2727808,56923036,2015-12-20,47341397,Sarah,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Rose Michelle's cottage for our first 2.5 weeks in Seattle, allowing us time to find permanent housing. This was a great decision! The cottage was perfect, exactly what the photos illustrate. It is small but Rose Michelle has thought of everything to make the cottage comfortable and enjoyable. And it is in a great location in Fremont, there are plenty of amenities within walking distance. I would definitely recommend this place as a base camp to explore the city! "
2727808,57220418,2015-12-23,18018702,Eugene,Excellent and responsive!
5695344,30842208,2015-04-27,31619878,Bill,"This is a terrific place for a weekend stay.  ""Sanctuary"" is a fiting title.  The room and home are warm and inviting.  Roseanne is a charming and attentive host.  The listing description was modest compared to the experience.  There is abundant art in the room and throughout the home.  The deck and garden are a bonus creating a spaciousness I enjoyed very much.  The home is well located for trips throughout Seattle and to local parks - including beach parks.  The space is so well-decorated, and no surprise considering the host is a gifted artist.  Waking up to a sunny view of the deck was perfect.  Lisca the cat is as sweet and friendly as they come.  The space helped me relax and move more slowly - exactly what I needed.
"
5695344,35719568,2015-06-21,35365766,Charlotte,The host greeted me at the assigned time.  The room and home were very comfortable and appealing.  I especially enjoyed the wonderful weather and the neat balcony off my room.
5695344,43154416,2015-08-17,36185728,Steven,"Roseanne was an absolute pleasure.  She was incredibly accommodating and hospitable.  I found myself resisting the urge to talk about every art piece and picture in the house, because she no doubt would have indulged me.  She was also very patient and kind toward my young daughter.  I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  "
5695344,54807631,2015-11-23,715551,Mary,"I stayed over one night in Seattle for a professional training seminar and Roseanne's house worked great for that. Good location, quiet setting, good bed, bath and kitchen.  I ended up having the whole house to myself! I'm sure in summer, the garden in the backyard is beautiful. Thank you, Roseanne."
6776229,44863335,2015-08-29,41589848,Karen,Lovely apartment. Good lake view.Convenient.Clean. I like the coffee machine.
6776229,45023940,2015-08-30,42434730,Mandy,Stayed one night to be closer to a wedding.  The host was very welcoming and responsive.  The unit is extremely clean and comfortable.  The kitchen is well stocked.  Great view of Lake Union!  I would stay again.  
6776229,45447717,2015-09-02,15497077,Michael,The apartment was very nice and clean.  Everything we needed was provided for us. The host was very helpful and prompt to help us during our stay. 
6776229,46064152,2015-09-07,4514539,Bradley,Great place! Super convenient to the major Seattle neighborhoods. Comfy and quiet. Made for a great base camp for a long weekend of exploring. I'd stay here again.
6776229,46645603,2015-09-12,42927613,Steve,Had a great experience. Everything was as described. Great balcony view!
6776229,46972936,2015-09-14,43223796,Atsuko,"The host was very attentive for our needs, much appreciated their flexible hospitality! Apartment was clean, efficient for all your need, and has a killer view of Union Lake. Enjoy our stay at your place, thank you so much :) "
6776229,48585806,2015-09-27,17914940,Leilani,"This was a great home base for our weekend in Seattle. The location made it easy to get around by car and public transport. Though our outings were fun, we were also happy to spend relaxed time in the very comfortable apartment. "
6776229,49357585,2015-10-03,43777699,Frank,The apartment was exactly as advertised - clean and comfortable.  It served as a good home base for exploring Seattle's many neighborhoods and downtown.  We would welcome the chance to stay here again if we're ever back in Seattle.
6776229,49826317,2015-10-06,44543484,Tally,"Great, convenient spot to stay in Seattle. Located in a place that made getting around quick and easy. Very clean apartment. "
6776229,50684719,2015-10-13,45117777,Malene,Everything was as described. We enjoyed the stay very much. 
6776229,51333328,2015-10-19,44887317,Lauren,"We had an amazing stay at this apartment during our trip to Seattle! Everything was very clean, the view was spectacular, and the neighborhood was very quiet and central to many locations we visited. Tim provided everything we needed and made our stay very easy. We would love to stay here again when visiting Seattle! "
6776229,51832765,2015-10-24,16912599,Robert,"Timothy made it very easy for me to enter and exit the apartment.  He and Brittany were as helpful and as responsive as one could hope for.  The place was perhaps better than described... was very spacious, well equipped with a view to boot.   The gym was better than I expected and the unit very clean and (website hidden), with hbo on demand and good wifi once I locked into the correct password. Location is great for people with a car or those that like to walk.  The cool neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Ann's are accessible at about .6-7 miles to Fremont and 1 mile to the heart of Queen Anne's.  If you don't have a car, the E line bus is a cinch and you are downtown in 12 minutes.  I took one cab the whole time.  I got to the airport, faster than a cab would have taken by one bus and the light rail.  I did not cook, but could have done so with a nice modern kitchen.  Washer and dryer also for those staying a while.  I recommend this listing highly. "
6776229,52135219,2015-10-26,18762180,Javieree,Sstreamlined check-in. 
6776229,53098898,2015-11-04,39088189,Neil,"We very much enjoyed our stay here.  The area is nice and fairly centrally located.  Having a car definitely made things easier, and the reserved parking space was a big plus.

The apartment is not huge but is a step up from a typical hotel.  The living room is large and spacious, and the kitchen is large and well-equipped enough to cook normal meals.  There's a separate bathroom with tub and a normal-sized bedroom as well.  The view of the river from the balcony is fantastic.

The appliances, such as the dishwasher, washer, and dryer, make this a practical place for a longer stay, although we only spent 3 days there.

All rooms are well-appointed, clean, and comfortable.  We also appreciated the included sundries such as shampoo, coffee & tea, laundry detergent, a Brita water filter/dispenser, and some basic cooking ingredients.  

The host was very responsive and helpful when we contacted.

Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and we would gladly stay here again."
6776229,53767422,2015-11-12,206203,Amanda,Heart of Seattle has heart. Located near everything and easy public transportation. It is clean and well equipped for cooking homemade meals. Easy check in and out. Free parking which is a bonus in Seattle.  Pretty decent view also. I would definitely recommend this place.
6776229,54411491,2015-11-19,47702512,Erin,What an amazing view! I did get the chance to briefly meet the host and super gracious. Perfect location and amenities for our stay. I will certainly come back on another trip.
6776229,54931195,2015-11-25,3610789,Jane,"Tim and Brittney were great hosts.  They were very communicative and answered questions prior to my arrival.  The place was exactly as pictured and even better than what I imagined.  It feels like a brand new 1BR that is laid out well for the amount of space.  I was staying alone for almost 4 days and enjoyed my time there.  

The place comes equipped with everything you need including a washer/dryer which was super helpful for me as I am staying in Seattle for a full week.  Clear instructions were left in terms of how to leave the place.  I had one minor SNAFU while I was there but Tim and Brittney quickly contacted the building and got back to me as it was a building-wide issue and not specific to the unit.  

Overall I would stay here again, the place had a great view, the workout room was a nice bonus.  The only thing to be aware of is that there are multiple entrances which can cause confusion to Uber drivers so you're better off trying to meet them on 6th Street instead of Aurora because the turn comes up very quick.  "
6776229,55101807,2015-11-28,39947239,Janet,The host was very accommodating to my need to check in a bit earlier. The coffee and the holiday decorations were a welcome touch.  
6776229,55685385,2015-12-04,27800744,Margaret,"Tim was available and helpful and made everything very easy. The place was super cute, and exactly as advertised. It surprised me that it was so quiet, you can't hear any of the traffic on Aurora. I would stay here again."
6776229,56520387,2015-12-14,9709773,Liz,"Lovely decor and comfy furnishings, exactly as depicted in the photo.  The place has a great sized bathroom, also tastefully decorated and accessible with railings (which was a great surprise). Little holiday wishes on the bed pillows and kitchen table. Great view of Lake Union. Couldn't have asked for better accommodations.  Would definitely love to come back again and take advantage of the roof deck and exercise facilities."
6776229,57049954,2015-12-21,48988277,Dimitri,"The accommodations were wonderful and Timothy was very helpful with any questions we had during our stay. The apartment is very clean, nicely decorated and has a spectacular view! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!"
8072907,44877931,2015-08-29,12577068,Ted,"Convenient Belltown location - walking distance to various restaurants and shops. Apartment was clean and cozy, pictures & description is accurate. We enjoyed our stay and appreciated our host's hospitality. "
8072907,45041694,2015-08-30,1484950,Tyler,Loubna was waiting at the apt to greet us and gave us a quick tour. its a great apartment (across the street from a fire station where they practiced with chainsaws at 10am) and we enjoyed the comfortable layout very much. would recomend to anyone looking to stay near downtown seattle.
8072907,46052510,2015-09-07,42524040,Gina,"Loubna was a fabulous host greeting us at the door and being sure to answer any questions we had about her home or the area before she left. She also gave us her cell phone number in case any other questions came up and supplied some light snacks as well. The apartment was perfect for our needs and the location cannot be beat! It was myself and two children and we each took a tun on the couch which was comfortable enough for children or a shorter adult. If you are flying to Seattle and mostly staying in the area don't rent a car. It's an easy walk to the Space Needle and the surrounding sights as well as Pike's Place... Belltown is filled with restaurants and Loubna has a small kitchen for light cooking to save on expenses. The apartment felt secure and was very quiet, but there is street noise with the firestation directly across the street. I would love to stay here again on my next trip to Seattle. "
8072907,47776863,2015-09-21,4856728,Cindy,"Loubna was a great host - she was out of town, but arranged for a friend to meet us at the apartment and show us around.  She left fruit and muffins for us, as well as clean towels and miscellaneous mini toiletries in case we needed it.  The apt was neat and clean, and was across from a fire station and next door to a psychiatric clinic which made for some moderate street noise pollution.  But the bed was so comfy that I could pretty much fall asleep again right away.  The location is super convenient, and within walking distance to great restaurants/bars/Pike Place/Space needle."
8072907,48570260,2015-09-27,33619525,Daniel,"This apartment is very adorable. Loubna was not able to meet us to give us a key but her friend met up with us and showed us around the place before leaving and was very nice and friendly! Loubna has toiletries in the bathroom (awesome ones!) that she bought for AirBnB guests, which was a delightful extra touch. She also had some food in the kitchen, like homemade muffins, that were available to us--also a great, unexpected extra touch! "
8072907,49473876,2015-10-04,19313301,Seana,Great location and friendly host!
8072907,50327670,2015-10-11,8093675,Rosa,"Loubna is great host, she keep contact me and warm reminder all the time. The apartment is great location and sweet and really convenient to go anywhere. Defiantly recommend!"
8072907,51917119,2015-10-25,12237545,Sarah,"Loubna was a great hostess and her apartment is wonderfully cute and cozy! We loved the walkability to lots of Seattle sights and the Belltown neighborhood has lots to offer in terms of restaurants, coffee shops, bars, etc. If you have three people staying, the couch is also plenty comfy to sleep on. Loubna was also gracious to let us check out a bit late on our final day, which we very much appreciated. 

The only downside to the apartment was the street noise and noise from the fire station across the street -- the apartment is not quite ground level but is close enough to the street to have substantial noise from cars and pedestrians on the street. 

Otherwise, we very much enjoyed the apartment and Loubna was a great hostess!"
8072907,53488532,2015-11-09,45775003,Charlene,Loubna's place was a wonderful choice for us. Her description was accurate and we especially enjoyed the location. The little 'extras' she left for us were very welcoming. Thanks Loubna.
8072907,53990947,2015-11-15,23543514,Charles,"Loubna's place was great! Walking distance to Pike Place, the Space Needle, and great restaurants and bars in downtown! The place was also clean and Loubna was very helpful! "
8072907,55869722,2015-12-06,11815281,Claire,"Loubna's place was perfect! I was in Seattle for a craft show and the apartment was walking distance to the venue.  We found some great coffee shops and restaurants nearby and everything we needed seemed to be in close vicinity.  Loubna was a great, communicative host and the apartment was really cozy and welcoming.  We had everything we needed and more! "
8072907,56416461,2015-12-13,45406989,Michael,Loubna's apartment was located in a great part of town and she made our stay very easy with tips for fun activities in the area. The apartment was as described and very clean. We would stay with this host again.
1305009,5949175,2013-07-23,5490171,DeeAnna,"Joel and his family were perfect hosts and I had a great stay with them.  From our initial communication to my departure, Joel was always available to answer questions and just to make sure I had what I needed. The actual unit is in a finished basement with a separate entrance.  It was super clean, had a comfortable bed, clean linens, french press which was perfect for my coffee addiction, Wi-Fi, separate lounge area, and cooking essentials. The DeJongs are a lovely, lovely family that respected my privacy and at the same time made me feel very comfortable and cared for.  I was lucky enough to meet the three DeJong children which were little gems of people. 

Having the lightrail a block from the unit was super convenient for getting downtown.  4 blocks away on Ranier street there are plenty of restaurants...my favorites were La Medusa and Tutta Bella.  

I felt very comfortable and safe staying here and it was exactly what I was looking for as I transitioned to a new city and job.  "
1305009,6093504,2013-07-29,7616650,Lindsey,"This was just what we needed during our trip to Seattle. The space was nice, as pictured and clean. The TV room was in the basement (on our level) so it was nice to curl up after a busy day and watch something on Netflix. I liked having an outside entrance and the back yard looked like an oasis - though we didn't find the time to spend out there. The location is very convenient, many places we were headed were only 5 miles away. The ceilings are low but my husband is 6'1"" and he wasn't uncomfortable even though he only had a couple extra inches of wiggle room. Overall we wished we had spent more time at Joel's house relaxing and enjoying the comfortable accommodations. We would definitely stay there again. "
1305009,6465584,2013-08-13,7441782,Garth,"Overall, the unit was very satisfactory.  The kitchenette is small but had most what I needed - a toaster would have been a good addition.  A tall person would have been uncomfortable as the basement unit had low (website hidden) was only connected to Netflix - so couldn't get local news, etc  The house was very conveniently located one block from light rail so very easy to get downtown with no hassle.   "
1305009,6850632,2013-08-27,7044208,Elizabeth,"Myself, adult daughter and two toddler granddaughters just stayed with Joel and his family and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  They had everything we needed and accommodated my two grandbabies by supplying us with a pack and play so that they could sleep and allowed them to use their kids' playroom which was the highlight of their day.  Their backyard is to die for especially if you have children but if you don't, it is just relaxing to sit around and enjoy the peace.  They are located very close to the light rail which was very convenient and only about a 15 minute ride to downtown.  Joel and his wife were extremely friendly and helpful and they never made us feel like we were a bother even after I kept asking questions.  Joel was very responsive to my emails and always had suggestions for us. They gave us our privacy and were very accommodating and we felt as though we were home.  I would highly recommend staying with Joel and his family.  "
1305009,7070985,2013-09-05,7830391,Alex,"Joel and his family are excellent hosts.  The space is a great refuge after a day spent sightseeing in Seattle, or hiking in the nearby mountains.  The backyard terrace is a perfect spot to enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning just as the sun comes over the hill (we visited in late August).  As an extra touch, they even allowed us to pick some items from the garden if we desired.  I would definitely recommend this spot to someone visiting Seattle."
1305009,7356727,2013-09-16,8573515,Anne,"Joel provided us with a warm welcome by inviting us for a drink at the  fire pit in the backgarden, were we spend a wonderfull evening. He and his kids were great hosts.  My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at their nicely decorated basement appartement.  Close proximity to the lightrail is really conveniënt for visiting dowtown.  Please note that tall people could experience some difficulty with the low ceiling., especially in the shower. That aside, we highly reconmend this place."
1305009,7589352,2013-09-25,8797623,Mark,"Great stay , great hosts. I highly recommend anyone to stay at this wonderful location."
1305009,8143663,2013-10-17,7397923,Lauren,"This was a great place to stay for us while our house was undergoing plumbing work. The location was great and the space was serene, relaxing and well equipped. Joel was flexible and responsive, and gave us privacy, so it didn't really feel like we were staying in someone else's home. I will definitely be recommending this spot to friends and family when they are visiting and looking for a place to stay."
1305009,14250795,2014-06-15,9451204,John,Great hosts and great place to stay that exceeded expectations all around - I look forward to returning. Joel even went so far as lending me a mountain bike which I used to cruise all around Seattle and the Eastside during my week in town - totally laid back place to stay with a beautiful garden and green space behind - an excellent and private basement apartment that is a great place to stay. 
1305009,14489924,2014-06-20,16535434,Nancy,We had a great time! Rental was clean and cute. Joel & Mary we're friendly and helpful. They even let our kids use their children's toy room.
1305009,15637351,2014-07-13,16549827,Lisa,"Great stay! The suite is very conveniently located just a block from the light rail station and a few minute walk from the shops and restaurants of Columbia City, and Seward Park and Genessee Park. The basement is exactly as listed, with short ceilings especially in the bathroom, but that was not a problem for us or anyone over six feet. The kitchen had some good basics to make preparing basic meals a cinch. The bedroom was dark and the full sized bed extremely comfortable. The living room with Netflix made our visit really special too."
1305009,16416666,2014-07-27,712788,Siems,"We had a great time in Mary & Joel's basement apartment! Enough space, separate tv room, kitchen ... The location is close to Seattle, yet has its own charme. Definitely try the gourmet pastries at Columbia City Bakery and exotic BBQ chicken at Island Soul. We thank our considerste hosts and their lively, polite kids for two relaxing, fun weeks!"
1305009,16586072,2014-07-29,16153612,Steve,Unfortunately I had to cancel. I put in wrong dates. The host was very understanding. 
1305009,16749514,2014-08-01,17616856,Tasha,"We did not meet Joel but the check in process was very simple and we enjoyed our stay. The basement was great and very close to the light rail station which will take you straight into downtown Seattle. 

We didn't agree with the cleaning fee that was charged. The room was not disgusting, but there was a dirty towel in the bathroom and the shower was covered in hair. We did not understand what the fee was for when we had to take the bins out and strip the bed, (this did not bother us doing this) but we didn't understand what the fee was for.

A very nice stay, thank you."
1305009,30401610,2015-04-21,29702494,Anne,"What a charming family and charming accommodations. It was exactly as pictured and written. We were very comfortable. 
The location is so convenient to the Link and yet removed from the hustle bustle. 
Mary and Joel were very gracious and helpful.
We could not have been more pleased and will use again on our next Seattle visit."
1305009,35738521,2015-06-21,26439669,Robin,"I stayed at Joel and Mary's home for two nights. They were very nice and accommodating. The basement unit was perfect for me, with a useable kitchen and wifi. The neighborhood was a good location for me"
1305009,51266838,2015-10-19,22280195,Sara,"Wonderful place to stay! I stayed 3 months while on assignment for work and had a great time living here. Cozy and homey apt and such a fun backyard.  Joel and the family are super sweet and friendly. Great location to be near the light rail and hop on to downtown, along with the cute columbia city downtown just a few blocks away. And close to I 5 for longer drives.  Great home away from home!:)"
1305009,52762550,2015-11-01,46583335,Hilary,"Wonderful, quiet accommodations. Having the kitchenette and bathroom available for private use was fantastic. The bed was very comfy and overall a comfortable experience. Reservation and check-in were hassle-free.

Everything was clean and cozy, and very well thought out for guests.

The ceilings (particularly the shower) are quite low, so if you're much taller than 6', expect to hunch quite a bit. "
1305009,53478197,2015-11-09,12100272,Leigh,"Arriving at Joel's was magical. So much greenery and a pumpkin that one of his children had carved Welcome on it was lit by my backdoor. Their backyard is amazing!

Joel left instructions for the stay and gave helpful advice for a natural food store near by. The light rail is 2 blocks away and it takes you to downtown Seattle in 15 minutes. Everything is very convenient. 

The space you rent is like your own little apartment with a very nice hot shower and quaint bathroom. There is a kitchen that is excellent with many amenities. There is also a small kitchen table perfect! The bedroom and the bed are antique looking and very cozy. The bedding is beautiful, large closet space, and a desk. I have to say they even leave mindful things around for you to browse through or take part in. (Mindful coloring).

Joel and his family are really working to improve their community. They partake in events of tree planting and recycling. These are good people.

I would advise that they do have small children and it can get a little rambunctious and a little loud at times. Its children, but if you are not use to family life this should be noted to you. The kids are up kind of early and their day is beginning, so you do not sleep very late.

Overall, it was a very magical and lovely experience."
1305009,54827029,2015-11-23,49136419,Mike,The place was nice and comfy. It was great basically having your own apartment with small kitchen. 
1305009,55296225,2015-11-29,15614782,Deanna,"The space is beautiful, warm and inviting. The location is perfect, being in such a quiet place and so convenient to the light rail and downtown Columbia City. We honestly couldn't have asked for a better stay and look forward to staying with them again! It is true about the low ceilings, but for our height we were just fine."
1305009,55514591,2015-12-01,1846920,Scott,"Our stay at Joel's was great. We were in for a couple of nights and everything we needed was provided for. Joel was easy to communicate with and was quick to reply. 
We took a walk around the Cheasty Greenspace next to the house which was nice having so close. I would definitely recommend a stay here."
6390214,33313046,2015-05-26,18230155,William,"We really enjoyed our trip to Seattle, and Emily's studio was the perfect home away from home.  

Emily reached out to us right away to make us feel welcome, accommodated our trip schedule, and made sure we had everything we needed.  She left a few necessities for us (which came in handy!), and there was even some cold beer in the fridge waiting for us!  

The studio was located right in the heart of Capital Hill, so we comfortably walked everywhere we wanted to go.  When we stayed in, the full kitchen and comfy bed made us feel right at home.  We'd definitely stay here again!
"
6390214,34662537,2015-06-10,4119824,Sooyun,"Emily was a great host! Although I didn't get to meet her, she was very communicative. She is very generous and accommodating. Her place is comfortable and very conveniently located. I would stay here again for my next visit to Seattle! "

The best part was the location. I had a great time in the area, there was so much to do. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. "
6390214,35812868,2015-06-22,32277457,Ylva,"This was great! Emily has been a great host and easy to communicate with. The place was just as the photos told and Emily had described. We came to a tidy and nice place. Emily had left a note for us with some information and we felt very welcome. Clean towles, soap, toothpaste, chocolate, coffee, milk and beer were some of the things she had submitted for us. We usually woke up to the birds singing, and one day to the dumpsters being emtied, but it was a quiet and calm neighbourhood. We walked to downtown Seattle in less then 30 minutes. If we had had more time we would spend more time in Capitol Hill.  There were a lot of great shops, cafes and restaurants. The Cal Anderson park seemed like a nice place for a picnic or just relaxing in the sun (but we didn't have the time to do so). "
6390214,36316863,2015-06-27,17528773,Beverly,"Emily was responsive and hospitable.  The studio was comfy for the two of us and our baby.  The neighborhood was quiet and conveniently located to the freeway and eateries.  Thank you for hosting, Emily!"

6390214,37381236,2015-07-06,36361179,David,"Emily has been a great host.
She left the apartment clean and nicely ready with a welcome note, some instruction on how to move through the city and... chocolate!!
We felt at home.
The neighbourhood is vibrant at night time, with loads of good little restaurants and bars within walking distance.
You'll have a great experience overall.

Thank you Emily! 
"
6390214,38142495,2015-07-13,34606956,Jonathan,"This studio was the perfect place to stay for our trip. Excellent location. Emily was very easy to work with. She was flexible and always (website hidden) up to date with any changes. She even got us a parking pass!

Emily provided toiletries, coffee beans, press pot and towels. We were in want of nothing. "

She left us a nice welcome letter, towels plus some toilet articles and even chocolate, coffee and some beer in the fridge! Communication was very friendly, reliable and quick. 

The location is very convenient, you can reach downtown by bus in around 20 minutes, but if you're a bit adventurous you can sign up with the Seattle bike share program (called pronto) for a day pass and take a bike which is fun, at least downhill. Another tip, you can get a very nice breakfast on Broadway in a place called Americana.

It was a perfect stay for us, thanks a lot Emily!"
6390214,40241756,2015-07-29,8013961,Chris,"This is my second time staying at Emily's apartment and like last time she was super accommodating and easy to work with.  The apartment is clean and she thoughtfully left out a towel, soap, and a chocolate!  She provided an iron and ironing board which I used.  The wifi was solid and the location on cap. hill was just great."

I was in town on business, and all the amenities plus the personal, thoughtful attention of the host made for a stress-free trip. I really felt at home in her lovely studio."
6390214,45311367,2015-09-01,41334951,Hans,"During a time where everything seemed to be booked out in Seattle, Emily offered her lovely apartment. It's a bright and clean studio, and having a full kitchen with amenities like coffee and tea made it feel like home and our mornings more enjoyable. Check-in and check-out was easy and the location in Capitol Hill is perfect with lots of restaurants and bars around. You can rent bikes in the nearby park, or even walk to downtown.  I was traveling with a friend and Emily offered us an air mattress in case we wanted separate beds - that was very kind and expected!

All in all a very positive experience for me as a newbie here on Airbnb."
6390214,45710689,2015-09-05,6509991,Mark,"I love the place. It's in the perfect location and nestled close to a park, lots of restaurants... and most importantly, great coffee!

Emily was an excellent communicator and very accommodating to check-in and check-out times. I really appreciated her kindness and opening her home to me.

Thanks Emily!"

Her place was neat, clean and very well located for exploring Capitol Hill. "
6390214,53469583,2015-11-09,14125669,Jeff,Emily's apartment was the perfect home-base for exploring the city and couldn't have been in a better location. She was incredibly accommodating and responsive throughout the entire process and was even sweeter in person than over texts/emails! Would not hesitate to stay here again.
6599960,35491854,2015-06-19,29695315,Natali,Me and my family had a wonderful stay at Jesse's house. The place was better than expected and the quiet beautiful surroundings were very amazing. Jesse was very welcoming and attentive. He was always making sure we had everything we needed as well as space. He made sure we had a comfortable stay. Definitely a great place to take a little break and have a nice retreat. 
6599960,35850153,2015-06-22,35036881,Regina,"Everything was perfect for us - the neighborhood, arrangements/accommodations - we truly loved it! Felt like home for the short period of time we spent at the apartment. Thanks for additional suggestions/hints about neighborhood events."
6599960,36615326,2015-06-29,31675274,Norma,"Ravenna Retreat was a great stay! The place looks better then in the pictures! They left a note with ideas of what to do and Emily was very helpful, letting us know where to get groceries. Being able to eat outside for almost all of our meals was so nice! My mom and sister slept on the bed, and I on the couch. Both were really comfy! The only bad thing we experienced was with parking. Make sure you absolutely follow the parking rules. They DO tow :( 
But it was an overall, great stay! I would definitely recommend if you are in the Seattle area. "
6599960,38651444,2015-07-17,22063813,Dave,"The host (Jesse) was very attentive, the unit was very clean and as shown in the pictures.  The backyard/patio was a nice quiet space to be in.  The bright open spaces both inside and out were greatly appreciated, comfortable for our family of four and reminded us why we prefer Air BNB over hotels.  Oh,and the bed is very comfortable. :)"
6599960,39308629,2015-07-22,2145759,Simon,"They were waiting for us, and gave us a tour of their cute apartment. They had coffee for us, and were absolutely accommodating and welcoming."
6599960,40123113,2015-07-28,36486358,Melanie,"Jesse made us feel very welcome! He accommodated our late arrival time and provided many recommendations. The apartment is very spacious and clean. It felt very relaxing, especially with the private patio. Like a home away from home! "
6599960,40489017,2015-07-31,961578,Lauren,"Jesse is a wonderful host and his sweet Zen pad is the perfect place to stay if you're in the U district. Literally on Ravenna park, I awoke to the sound of falcons hunting and song birds chirping , w/verdant views throughout the house. The only noise you here is from the street, which can be loud, but otherwise a peaceful and simple place to let your head. I would definitely stay here again."
6599960,41104247,2015-08-04,10147331,Anna,Jesse was flexible with our arrival time and the apartment was clean and comfortable. Great and convenient location in Seattle! 
6599960,41624270,2015-08-08,35730514,Joni,"Jesse and Emily were great host, they went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. The house was perfect for our family of four. There are nearby grocery stores and restaurants that are convenient for busy schedules. Free laundry and wifi available. Very convenient location, would definitely stay here again when in the area. Highly recommend!"
6599960,43447558,2015-08-19,15127650,Ruth,"Jesse's place was well-appointed and mostly peaceful, with a comfortable bed. The patio, which overlooks a park, was lovely, and the location is in a great Seattle neighborhood. But ... parking on a busy street is difficult."
6599960,45084631,2015-08-31,17763929,Becca,"Jesse's space was great, very private. The location is perfect walking distance to shopping and food. The kitchen is well stocked and large enough to cook. Unfortunately the power went out due to a wind storm, but Jesse had plenty of board games to play to keep us occupied in the evening. "
6599960,55862880,2015-12-06,9191265,Lauren,"I took a trip to explore Seattle with a few girl friends and we really enjoyed our stay at the Ravenna Retreat.  The location is great, as it is very close to running trails as well as walking distance to a large shopping area and great restaurants! Jesse was very welcoming and helped us get settled very easily. We would book this apartment again."
6599960,56984794,2015-12-20,51358803,K.G.,"This was a great place to stay and really close to our folks' place. Our host was very responsive by phone if we had a question. The apartment was cozy, quiet and totally clean, and the gas fireplace was a welcome feature on a cold December day. We even had a sweet little Christmas tree lit up and waiting for our arrival. Weekday parking might be a little challenging, but we were gone all day and there was always someplace to park at night. We would gladly consider staying here again!"
1828232,14362541,2014-06-17,15817241,Jasmin,"David was a great host. He was great to communicate with while we were planning the trip and he was great after we checked in as well. The apartment was amazing, with beautiful views of Seattle and the Space Needle. He thought of everything it seemed. There was toiletries in the bathroom, beer in the fridge, and some very delicious chocolates on the bed. I stayed with my boyfriend while attending a wedding, and this apartment was walking distance to the wedding, and to Pike Place and the Seattle Center. The whole trip was fantastic, made even better by the fact that we had a great home base to re-charge in. "
1828232,14573501,2014-06-22,4956774,Edward,"David's place was awesome. Excellent location as it was only a mile away from Pike Place Market, and many nightlife/coffee establishments. I stayed with my cousin and it was perfect for two, although three would work too (2 on bed, 1 on couch). The view is great with a clear view of downtown and the Space Needle. David was also a great host - provided towels, toiletry, recommendations, and most importantly...BEER! I would highly recommend this place and would definitely stay again. Thanks David! (Disclaimer: if you are allergic to cats, might reconsider as my cousin was reacting pretty strongly, but after leaving the windows open, and with the help of the rain the apartment cleared up pretty well)"
1828232,15707917,2014-07-14,9684315,Jody,Best host ever! Gorgeous apartment! I really enjoyed the view of the needle! Would love to stay there again. His communication made it so easy to check in. Can't say enough about how nice our stay was.

The fridge always has beer in it for us too! the location is very walkable (close to many capitol hill restaurants, shops, cafes,and bars). Beautiful views of the Space Needle! Perfect place for a weekend getaway!  Can't thank David enough for hosting us. Hope to get back there soon."
1828232,23736172,2014-12-08,6342137,Nick,"David was an excellent host!

7203408,39084578,2015-07-20,35986946,Diane,"Taylor was such a gracious host. The day of our arrival we met at the airport as she was flying out. She offered lots of tips and suggestions for enjoying our stay.  The apartment was sweetly decorated with big windows that let in the fresh air. All of our needs were met: plenty of fresh towels, air mattress, pots and pans, bottled water, coffee and more. Apparently no one is Seattle has air conditioning but the apartment does have a floor unit, which was much appreciated because the week was atypically hot. The location was perfect and within walking distance for exploring the city - we felt like locals! As a woman traveling with two teens, I felt very safe in the apartment and surrounding neighborhood. "
7203408,39325234,2015-07-22,4588939,Romey,Your place lived up to the darling picture I saw on the site. Very clean. Very comfortable. I appreciated you arranging someone to meet me in person to get the keys and help with my luggage. Thanks for the late check out too!
7203408,39541233,2015-07-24,10033249,Mark,"Taylor has a lovely home in an awesome location. She was really organized and communicated everything, even though we didnt actually meet. Thanks so much!"
7203408,39820110,2015-07-26,14735215,Melanie,"LOVED the space!!  Taylor's apartment is spacious (slept 4 of us very comfortably and could probably have slept one additional smaller person on the couch) and beautifully decorated!  She left personal touches all over the place that made staying so comfortable - kuerig coffee pods including fresh creamer and sugar, little Kashi snack bars, water bottles in the fridge, the wifi password typed up and framed for easy access, soft towels and wash clothes for all of us, and a folder with lots of clear instructions and guidance for your stay.  It is an older home with the obvious worn edges and styling,  but again, it was so beautifully decorated and maintained that it just felt like home!  She was also very responsive to all of my questions. She was out of town during my stay, but she had a friend who met us and made arrival still easy and smooth. She doesn't charge a cleaning fee as she asks you to put all the dirty sheets and towels in a basket and clean any dishes you use, etc. but it was very easy and totally worth it. She was even able to let us keep the keys a bit longer so we could leave our luggage there on the last day so we could traipse around town without our luggage. Not sure she would always be able to do that, but she responded within minutes to let us know. Overall, we absolutely LOVED our stay!  I would highly recommend the space and will definitely stay here again whenever I'm back in Seattle."
7203408,41855961,2015-08-09,39865666,Tom,"It was a great stay and Taylor and Tim has a lovely home.  The location was a easy ride to anywhere in town.  Kerry park is just a short walk away And the view was fantastic.  we love the personal touches and the unique decoration.  Overall, I'd definitely recommend  Taylor's (website hidden). Tim stayed up until mid night to give us the keys.  Thanks Tim. "
7203408,42053194,2015-08-10,40119454,Brittany,"The host was extremely welcoming. Taylor showed us around the place and had snacks, water and other little things set out for us to use during our stay.  The place was a great size, comfortably fit three, and was very comforting and inviting. The location was also great. It was within walking distance to the needle and nearby restaurants which was super convenient. Definitely recommend and very affordable for the location and apartment!! "
7203408,42450004,2015-08-13,34238141,Megan,"Taylor's apartment is in a great location. There are lots of restaurants and attractions so close. We were able to walk to the Seattle Center then take the monorail downtown. The apartment itself was the perfect size for the 2 of us, it felt very homey. Such a cute space that had everything we needed for our stay in Seattle!"
7203408,42592707,2015-08-14,18822866,Sherry,"Great place! Taylor is nice, we arrived late but he was patient to wait us."
7203408,42927722,2015-08-16,35805741,Cynthia,"Taylor's apartment is located just a few blocks walk from the Seattle City Center. It was so convenient that we parked our car on the street, for free, and did not use it even once. The rooms in the apartment are large, pleasantly decorated and clean. Treats and coffee were available upon our arrival which was very thoughtful. There is a full kitchen and a large living room with a Blu-Ray player and lots of movies. There is also a wonderful 24 hours Metro Market a couple of blocks away. It was an excellent stay and we would book again on any future visit to Seattle."
7203408,43704068,2015-08-21,36605451,Jennifer,"I had a great experience staying at Taylor's apartment. My friend was flying in from England to see Seattle for the first time and I really wanted to find a location that was welcoming and close to downtown. The apartment was just that and exactly as described: bright, clean, and within walking distance of downtown attractions. When my friend and I stayed there, we walked to Pike Place Market, the waterfront, the Space Needle and more. The accommodations were very comfortable. The neighborhood is safe and very close to restaurants and groceries.  

Taylor was always prompt in responding to my logistical questions. For example, when I inquired about parking, she immediately provided a helpful parking map to help me find free parking. When I was afraid that we would be late in checking in due to flight delays, she assured me that she or her husband would be there to check me in. 

Overall, I had a wonderful experience there and my friend from England had a great Seattle experience. I would stay there again!
"
7203408,44033931,2015-08-23,17715112,Robert,"Taylor made us feel very welcome.  She laid out lots of blankets and sheets for us upon arriving and the apartment was stocked with complimentary coffee and granola bars.  The space was bigger than we originally envisioned and there was plenty of room for 3 of us to fit comfortably.  The apartment was located in a cool part of town down the block from restaurants, coffee shops, etc.  All in all a great experience."
7203408,45810327,2015-09-06,11004877,Thomas,"Taylor and Tim were very welcoming - they were easy to contact and very pleasant to deal with!
The apartment in lower Queen Anne is spacious and very comfortable as well as well situated.
Parking is spare in the area, but there are lots of car2go in the neighbourhood to make getting around easy. "
7203408,46056375,2015-09-07,30116641,Kiera,"We adored this space. I did feel like the photos did not do the place justice. Very warm and refined home made us feel right at home. 

The location was great. We were able to walk to all the neighborhood local stores and restaurant, easy walk to the waterfront sculpture park, space needle, and belltown.

Taylor was and excellent host that pays extra attention to extra details. "
7203408,47692179,2015-09-21,18652212,Jennifer,"Taylor's place was perfectly located - allowing us to both experience the city as locals (with great restaurants and shops near by), as well as tourist (just a short bus ride from all the major attractions). 

The apartment was also impeccably well decorated with all the comforts of home.

I'd recommend her unit to anyone looking to visit Seattle!"
7203408,49492845,2015-10-04,1841453,Nedra,Great central Seattle location.  Light and bright exactly what we were looking for. 
5195064,26766489,2015-02-18,27624023,Jasmin,"Our stay at Luyao's place was very nice. Lea was out of town, but her boyfriend was welcoming and gave us the keys. The bed was comfy and the house was clean. I'd recommend this place to someone looking for a quieter neighbourhood but still close to downtown. "
5195064,27816717,2015-03-12,7188467,Sadie,We had different schedules so I only met her once but it was what we needed. My husband and I are quiet people so it was nice to have that privacy. We ran into Tao a few times and he was really sweet and left us to our privacy. The room was big and the beds were very comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. 
5195064,27865192,2015-03-13,26142555,Annika,"We stayed for one night at luyao's and Tao's place. The room is big and there is plenty of space to put your stuff. The bed is very comfotable! Everything was clean and tidy, we really enjoyed staying there."

5195064,28401370,2015-03-23,27810503,Carol-Lynn,We had a wonderful time staying at Luyao's place. It was a wonderful neighborhood with beautiful views. A very easy ride to downtown and in walking distance to several bars and places to eat. Luyao and Tao were very friendly and the bed was super comfortable. A great place to stay! 
5195064,28496644,2015-03-24,27720453,Maree,Review done as we added a day in seperate booking
5195064,28565037,2015-03-26,27720453,Maree,"My husband and I, both in our 50's, stayed with Luyao and Tao for 3 nights. The upstairs room was very spacious and the queen bed extremely comfortable. Enormous wardrobe space, large desk and chair are also provided. We could enter and exit the home without disturbing the living area and there was kitchen items and fridge/ cupboard space allocated for guest use. The shared bathroom was adequate and even though there was another guest we had no waiting. 
We had a car so unsure about public transport but parking in the street was easy. We would recommend this lodging to Seattle visitors.

Luyao keeps a powerful hairdryer in the bathroom which made packing a little easier, and even though we shared a bathroom with other guests, it wasn't ever a problem. Stay here–it's a great value."
5195064,29177265,2015-04-05,27817673,Ziyun,Nice host. The bedroom was big and clean. The bed was comfortable. 
5195064,29672288,2015-04-11,28296365,Christine,"Luyao and Tao have a lovely home, and were very friendly. Our room and bathroom were very clean, and they were very helpful and quick to respond to messages."
5195064,29798989,2015-04-12,22612119,Srikar,I had a pleasant stay. Hosts are very welcoming and helpful. Everything is accurate in description. I recommend this place. 
5195064,31050114,2015-05-01,29957858,Hang,"We stayed at Luyao and Tao's place during our 3 night stay in Seattle. They were really nice and accommodating. The room was clean and  spacious, which we really enjoyed. We were traveling up the PNW for a few days already so we wanted to do a load of laundry before we continued our trip and so they let us use their washer/dryer and detergent. Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would totally recommend any other travelers to stay here if they're visiting the city. "
5195064,31302521,2015-05-04,28151157,Janina,"Luyao was very friendly and helped us out where ever necessary. The room was spatious and we had everything we needed! Concerning the location in Seattle, one has to be aware of the bus timetables at the weekend."
5195064,31811563,2015-05-10,29803546,Satadru,"Luyao and Tao were very hospitable and welcoming. The house is situated in Magnolia and the area though situated near the city is not noisy. The room was quite big, very clean and very close to the bus stop for taking a bus to downtown Seattle. Luyao provided all the amenities (including Wifi :D).  Awesome place to stay, definitely 5 star!!"
5195064,32122772,2015-05-14,31117951,治,perfect!!
5195064,33206191,2015-05-25,18896689,Anna & Iván,"Perfect! It is a huge room with a comfy bed. 
They are really kind and helpful.
There is free parking for the car around their house and they let us lock our bikes in their little yard. 
We usually park our car and discover the cities with the bikes; the location is perfect! Nice ride across the canal to downtown. "
5195064,33413477,2015-05-27,24591221,Mélissa,"Very Big and clean room! You get everything you need!
You are not far from public transportation which take you downtown within 30 minutes..
A very good place to stay in Seattle !"
5195064,33552078,2015-05-29,23878854,Siyi,"Friendly and cute couple! The house was clean, neat, and quite. Everything was great from our experience with them. It's not far from buses and quite convenient to go downtown. "
5195064,33953716,2015-06-02,20863083,Josh,"Clean, comfortable, and courteous! What more could you ask for? Great location at an even better price. I would recommend spot to anyone."
5195064,34566530,2015-06-09,21957941,Rubal,"The room was very clean and spacious! and Luyao was very responsive and helped us anytime we needed anything. There was a large desk in one corner with a comfortable chair. There was plenty of storage in the room as well for our luggage and other things. The bathroom was shared so the cleanliness also depends on the other guests that are sharing it at the same time. There is a hair dryer to use in the bathroom. The only discomfort we had was there was no fan (it was hotter than usual that weekend) and if you open the window at night, there is some street noise which may wake you up as it did me. "
5195064,35239148,2015-06-16,4702211,Nancy,"The price was very reasonable, the location was good. The room was adequate."
5195064,35494896,2015-06-19,34787992,Yiju,"Luyao is very timely response whenever I reach out to her. The house is in the quite neighborhood, and just 1 minute to the bus stop. The room is spacious."
5195064,35822732,2015-06-22,33979559,Kevin,"Luyao was a great host and very accommodating to my needs. The room was very cozy, clean, and had everything I needed. "
5195064,36052500,2015-06-24,11712017,Chen Yu,房间很干净，也很整齐，房东超级nice！房间很安静…特别赞！
5195064,36553250,2015-06-29,10162478,Acacia,"Luyao and her husband were great hosts! Their place is very quiet and comfortable. It was only a half block from the 33 bus stop so it was really easy getting to downtown and the other neighborhoods. This room is on a separate floor from the hosts room and the living room/kitchen. You do share the floor and the bathroom with another room they rent out but we stayed for 5 days and never even saw the other guests so it worked out really well. 
Luyao and her husband are total AirBnB pros so everything is very organized and neat. 
Would definitely stay here again!"
5195064,36881990,2015-07-02,34306847,Allan,Luyao and Tao were just very kind and friendly hosts. The room was exactly what was described and it looked even better in person. It was very clean and spacious. My girlfriend and I were very pleased with our stay and amenities that were offered by the hosts. The location of their home in our opinion was ideal. There was street parking everywhere outside of their home and it only takes one bus to get downtown. I would consider this place again if I were to come back to visit Seattle!
5195064,37100713,2015-07-04,21334610,Ricky,"Clean, quiet, spacious room. Neighborhood very residential with few vegetarian-friendly restaurants nearby. Hosts were very kind."
5195064,37330090,2015-07-06,27731942,Lu,"抵达西雅图的当晚，LUYAO和先生还有他们的朋友一起在客厅等候我们，感觉真棒！他们是一对很温馨的夫妇！
整个屋子明亮而整洁，房子很新，房间也很大，我们的床应该是King Bed！这里去派克市场很方便，出门走不远就有33路公交车可以到。
这个街区安静祥和，邻居们也很友善！
"
5195064,37759960,2015-07-10,33705952,Elaine,"Luyao I would like to say thank you very much for hosting us three days. Everything nice, quite room convenient location etc. recommend this if you come to seattle"
5195064,37983650,2015-07-12,15341587,David,"Great place, great people. Bus to downtown very close to the house. It takes about 20 -25 min to get to the center. Good Irish pub and restaurant 5 minutes walk from the house. Quiet and beautiful room, very clean shared bathroom (only with one other guest). Luyao is very nice, helpful."
5195064,38604664,2015-07-17,34073740,Thao,"Normally, my friends and I stay at hostels when traveling, but we decided to give airbnb a try and chose Luyao's place. It was the best decision we made on this trip. The room was clean and tastefully decorated. Both the bed and pillows were comfortable (I especially love the soft pillow). Luyao and Tao (the hosts) were both very nice. Our flight was delayed and we didn't arrive in Seattle until 1:00am, but Luyao was able to accommodate our late arrival. The location of the apartment is also ideal. The bus stops are just down the street and take you to Downtown quickly. If you want to travel and still feel like you're returning to a home after walking up and down the hills of Seattle, stay at Luyao's apartment! "
5195064,38802894,2015-07-18,4542160,Naomi,The place is in a nice clean state. We had a comfortable stay at Luyao's place. Will recommend!
5195064,39024639,2015-07-20,34690906,Aurelia,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Luyao and her husband for two nights. Upon arrival, we were shown our accomodations upstairs. The room itself is just as pictured: a very spacious room with a large desk, several plastic drawers, and an entire closet-worth of space. The guest bathroom is shared with the other guests staying at the house. It was never a problem because our showering schedules didn't overlap and the bathroom was always kept clean. Shampoo, body wash, towels, q-tips, and floss were provided for guest usage.

We were given the key and given the freedom to enter and exit the home as we pleased (at any time). Luyao is very trusting of her guests, and her only expectation is for guests to abide by basic home etiquette. We had access to certain appliances in the kitchen downstairs-- the coffeemaker, toaster,  and water boiler, which we did have the chance to take advantage of, but was definitely nice to have. The wifi is very fast and reliable, which made evening web-surfing very enjoyable.

Both Luyao and her husband Tao are quiet individuals who are very welcoming and open to new visitors. Our contact was kept to a minimal, since we were out most of the day, but they would open the door and say hello as we returned. My boyfriend and I keep to mostly keep to ourselves, so this arrangement worked very well for both parties. 

Parking was provided on the street, and the home itself was about 20 minutes away from downtown Seattle. The nearest drugstore, gas station, and foodplace is at most 5 minutes away.

If you have a set agenda for your trip and are just looking for a very clean, comfortable, and quiet place to spend the night, I highly recommend staying here. If you're looking for a highly-interactive host-to-guest BnB experience, I would suggest searching elsewhere.  

We were very pleased with our stay, and would definitely stay again if we are back in the area."
5195064,39408015,2015-07-23,27778039,Moojin,Luyao and Tao are very kind and the house is so lovely and comfortable. It looks like same as the picture and the room is very clean. It is very easy to communicate with host and they alwayse answered very kindly. I really like her place and i want to recommed to everyone :)
5195064,39563799,2015-07-24,14105064,Heather + Allan,"Good central location to downtown Seattle.  Home is clean and comfortable and quiet.  Luyao helped us to find our way out of the city, provided us with use of the kitchen and helped us with any questions we had. This is an excellent choice if you are looking for a more private airbnb experience."
5195064,39940016,2015-07-27,22567355,Kimberly,"Great stay! Everything was super organized and laid out perfect just like a hotel. I'll say it probably wasn't the best fit for our almost 2-year old, but few things are. Great place, PERFECT location!"
5195064,40227213,2015-07-29,9181558,Julie,La maison est bien située pour rejoindre le centre ville de Seattle et nous avons apprécié avoir accès à la cuisine et au lave linge. La chambre est spacieuse et correspond bien aux photos. Luyao et Tao ont été courtois et ont pu répondre à nos questions. L'accueil fut un peu compliqué puisque nous n'avions pas pu lire le message de Luyao du jour même nous indiquant qu'ils seraient en retard.
5195064,40395142,2015-07-30,1762787,Dave,"This was my first experience with AirBnB so I hope that my review is not overly negative.

The BnB was part of a bigger house. I arrived and knocked on the door. I had booked through a women named Luyao but her husband answered the door. He was not exactly unfriendly but didn't exude warmth, despite my attempts to be chatty. He pointed me in the direction of the room and up the stairs I went. 
The room was clean, that's for sure, but rather spartan. There was a double closet full of shelving - if I wanted to stay for a couple of months, I would have had room for all of my clothes as well as a few other boxes of belongings. There was a desk with a chair and a small fan on the floor. The bed itself was ok but the pillows meant for sleeping (not the decorative ones) were pretty flat and small and there were only two. The room was upstairs and was hot. There was a small fan but it just did not kick out enough of a breeze to cool me down. I was hoping for a TV but none was in evidence. There was wifi, thank goodness, so it was a good thing that I had brought my iPad. It wasn't clear to me if I could share the family TV but that would have been uncomfortable, at least for me. 

In the write up for the BnB, they had said that shampoo and soap would be supplied for people staying short term. I went into the bathroom and the only shampoo and soap were half empty containers in the shower and a used piece of soap. It felt like I was using someone else's bathroom supplies!  

As for the B and B part - well I was welcome to use the kitchen, according to the instruction sheet, but there was nothing about breakfast being provided or food, for that matter. I didn't want to buy a loaf of bread in the morning just so I could have 2 pieces of toast! In my travels in Europe, the second B meant breakfast - I guess not in this case. 

I went back down after the shower to go for something to eat at a local pub. I made a bit of noise at the door because I knew my hosts were there but I didn't get a response. 

It was definitely a clean place to stay in a good area and a very good price. Most people who have stayed love this place, according to the reviews, so I am definitely in the minority but I felt that the hosts were a bit too shy and not in evidence and that the room itself, although large and clean, lacked the feeling of being more than just a place to sleep. "
5195064,40954349,2015-08-03,21987295,Aegean,"When we first arrived, the host wasn't there, but they left us the keys and stuff along with a letter that has rules and regulations on it. I really like the house. The room was clean and neat. The bathroom was very clean as well. They have prepared everything for us so it was, all in all, a wonderful experience."
5195064,41947563,2015-08-10,25760395,Andy,"Great experience, Luyao was very welcoming and made sure I had everything I needed! Great room, tons of space to put stuff and the desk is very convenient. The location is great, quick access to the city.

Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
5195064,42546633,2015-08-14,37194235,Lei,Great experience overall. The bedroom and bathroom were all pretty clean. Luyao and her husband are very nice and they provided everything for us. The only thing that bothered us a bit was the guest wifi. 
5195064,42860095,2015-08-16,23464996,Minju,"Luyao's house was comfortable and quiet. The room was spacious and everything was clean and neat! However, wifi didn't work well. It takes about 30~40 min to downtown Seattle by bus. The bus usually doesn't keep the time but if you get the bus, it comes right in front of her house! If you don't like waiting for a bus for a long time and are willing to have a 10~15min walk, I would recommend you to take bus line D. Overall, it was a really nice experience to stay at her place!"
5195064,43095891,2015-08-17,38744486,Thomas,"Sehr schönes, großes Zimmer, ruhiges Haus und ordentliche Wohngegend. Luyao hat uns sehr freundlich aufgenommen, alles gezeigt und noch einen Essenstipp fur's Dinner gegeben. Auto war gut zu parken. Wir können die Unterkunft sehr gut weiterempfehlen. "
5195064,43935059,2015-08-23,17471827,Kimber,"Luyao's home was beautiful! My friend, Natalie, and I stayed with Luyao for a week and had an amazing time. The room is clean and so, so spacious and the bed is absolutely heavenly after a day of walking around hilly Seattle. The neighborhood was a quick bus ride away from downtown (I would guess about 15 minutes, but it felt like less) and the closest bus stops are about a 5-minute walk away from Luyao's front door. We didn't interact much with our hosts (we are night owls and usually didn't wake until after everyone had left the house), but when we did they were friendly and helpful. A cabinet with glasses and kitchenware for guests to use and toiletries provided by the hosts are clearly marked. We did have to share a bathroom with other guests, but our unorthodox sleep schedule worked well in that way and it was never an issue. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable! I would definitely recommend staying here!"
5195064,44903093,2015-08-30,34924744,Siqi,"My first Airbnb experience was great. The host was easy-going, and friendly. The bedroom was as clean as the photos look like. The bus station to downtown is 2 minutes away by walk. I would recommend it to others who would like to live near downtown Seattle, and explore Seattle."
5195064,45384998,2015-09-02,16400154,Ashley,"Luyao was a very friendly host and very communicative! Her home is very clean and cozy with a lot of space. The location was good but is a 5 minute walk to a bus stop, which was a good distance for our needs."
5195064,45586347,2015-09-04,40553643,Soo,"집이 사진으로 보이는 것만큼 깔끔하고 좋았습니다 
집주인 분들도 친절하고, 정말 만족스러운 경험이였어요 "
5195064,45897580,2015-09-06,20935418,Reetu,"Luyao was very sweet, responded quickly, and made my stay nice and easy. I LOVED how clean and comfortable the space was. I had just arrived in town after a VERY long drive and just wanted to rest for the night. My stay was very peaceful and I was able to recharge. I would highly recommend!

P.S. The bed was SO comfortable!!"
5195064,46294632,2015-09-09,40322426,Andy,"Luyao was sincerely a welcoming host.  Very helpful and kind.  Offered all the basic necessities and the stay was clean.  From the reservation to end of the stay, everything was smooth and easy."
5195064,46543645,2015-09-11,43055585,Zhu,很好的体验，LUYAO非常nice，帮了我许多忙，五星推荐
5195064,46906122,2015-09-14,38125951,Sadat,"Luyao was very accommodating and provided a lot of quick and useful pre-stay communications. She allowed us to check in early, however, We never made it there until after 10pm and still had no problems getting in. The room was clean and ready to go when we arrived. I never actually got to meet Luyao but I would recommend her place if you're on Seattle for a quick stay. "
5195064,47849165,2015-09-21,43898074,Jamie,"We had a great stay in Seattle. Upon our late arrival, Luyao's husband awaited us and showed us around. He was very welcoming and friendly.  The room was very clean and large and fresh towels and slippers were provided. The house was very quiet and even with there being other guest staying we had absolutely no problems. Great neighbourhood and easy to find. Street parking was right outside and we didn't have any problems finding a spot. Overall great experience and we would be happy to stay here again.  "
5195064,48906171,2015-09-29,36249021,Rachel,"Absolutely a nice & first experience on Airbnb, as other guests said, the room is quite clean, quiet neighborhood, and nice people living around. Luyao and Rentao were both accommodating, we had pleasant talk whenever ran into each other.

Slippers, towels, shampoo and tooth paste are well prepared, you can release your luggage case if you don't mind to try something different during stay.

Parking is not a big issue, find a spot on the street beside is not a matter.

Convenient place to downtown area, restaurant, gas station and grocery store can be found nearby.

Overall, nice and comfy place to stay if u are looking for a lodging while stop by Seattle.
"
5195064,49173357,2015-10-01,15156605,Alan,"Listing as described. Luyao & Tao were in constant communication on when we'd arrive so we could meet and get a tour of the house. Room/bathroom/kitchen were as described and very clean. We loved how Luyao labelled everything that was for guests to use (fridge space, cupboard space, kitchen utensils, plates, etc.). Would definitely stay here again!"
5195064,49481240,2015-10-04,30595905,Li,很好很方便
5195064,50318097,2015-10-11,43716727,Maxine,The place was exactly what we were looking for! Luyao created a space for her guests that was clearly delineated and extremely useful. It was private and restful. Traveling is so much easier when you have an actual home base and Luyao made her home available as our own. 
5195064,52661024,2015-10-31,20211278,Casey,"My brother and I were just in Seattle one night, so this was a perfect little stop for us just to sleep and then take off the next morning. The room was nice, with a desk and a comfortable bed."
5195064,53560374,2015-11-09,12813079,Phil,Very peaceful night's sleep in this convenient and well looked after joint! I suffer from early morning insomnia and am usually awake before 5 but on this memory foam I slept until an unheard of 7! Really a great place to crash. Will be back!
5195064,54722366,2015-11-23,3517410,Meghan,We had a wonderful stay! The room is very clean and plenty of space for us. The house quiet and conveniently located. We'd definitely stay again!
5195064,55013496,2015-11-27,4384343,Calvin,Ms Luyao's place is described as posted. Very clean and comfortable. Host is very nice and helpful to traveler whom take time to tour the area with tip and provide reasonable accommodation for the stay. Highly recommend place to stay in Seattle. 
5195064,55590379,2015-12-02,14420322,Amber,"This is a great place for 1 or 2 people who want quick access to downtown. Luyao's place is just a few minutes away from downtown Seattle (without having to take the freeway!). The room is very clean and the communal areas (bathroom and kitchen) are clearly labeled. I enjoyed their cute cat and the overall simplicity and ease of this stay. Even though there was another party staying in the second room, we didn't feel the burden of shared spaces. As a remote worker I had to work from the room all day and the wi-fi connection was great and was even able to stream the Walking Dead without issue (major plus). "
5195064,56745385,2015-12-17,971667,Paul,"Very comfortable room, but be sure to ask Luyao for the heating if it's cold out. I foolishly didn't! Luyao and her husband are charming and very accommodating."
5195064,57227999,2015-12-23,49132565,Desmond,"The place was as pictured but the room was larger than we expected it to be. Luyao and her husband were also very friendly and accommodating, which makes you feel really comfortable and at home. I will definitely return if I am in Seattle."
5195064,57453741,2015-12-26,49673972,Yu Ting,地點很方便，家裡的用具十分齊全，提供出外旅行一個方便的經驗，特別是家裡的小成員，是旅行中的美好回憶。
3345341,14664929,2014-06-23,16020624,Jason,"Amy's place was conveniently located, about a 5-10 minute walk to the center of downtown. I booked on short notice, then had a long flight delay and Amy was very accommodating. The place was clean and exactly what I needed. She has a good mix of books (Sun Tzu sitting next to node.js) and left me donuts and bacon. I would definitely stay there again."
3345341,14839029,2014-06-27,15720471,Gabe,"Amy was great, she brought and picked up the keys and she had breakfast food stocked in the kitchen. The apartment was exactly as described. I was near everything downtown. The bed was quite comfortable, I wouldn't have known it was not a ""real"" bed.  I felt quite at home."
3345341,15004048,2014-06-30,5462607,Joel,"I had an excellent stay. It was just what I needed for an extended work weekend in Seattle. It's location is great - easy walking to downtown. She even provided breakfast food, toiletries, and was helpful regarding check-in/check-out."
3345341,15703867,2014-07-14,13326973,Oleksandr,"Everything was really good. Location is pretty convenient for getting everywhere by public transport. Also we got ORCA card from Amy. So one person could travel for free by public transport.

The apartment was clean and stylish. We were almost like at home.

P.S. Amy let us leave our bags before check-in time. That was a real plus."
3345341,16113782,2014-07-22,7953562,Shea,"Amy arranged a convenient key pickup for us. The apartment is exactly as in the photos. Comfy memory foam bed, plenty of lighting, internet. Had a bit of trouble with the lock becoming jammed the first night but got it unstuck using graphite from a pencil from the very-nearby convenience store. After that it was fine.

The neighborhood is downtown near hotels and plenty of restaurants. It's about 15 min/ 1 mile walk to Pike Market and around 25 minutes walk to the Space Needle. 

Nearby parking is scarce and expensive, but I think that goes for all of Seattle.

Kitchen was stocked with tasty snacks and the restroom had a nice supply of toiletries in case you forgot yours. If you can book it, definitely stay here. Amy knows what people need when they travel."
3345341,16238965,2014-07-23,270988,Jonathan,Amy was super accommodating and made my last minute booking really easy.  She was super responsive and helped me and a buddy out of a bind.  
3345341,18322371,2014-08-25,4382075,David,"The apt was a perfect launching spot to get around Seattle. For those looking for shopping (we weren't) there's a giant mall right around the corner, but we liked it's proximity to both Belltown and First Hill neighborhoods which we we spent time exploring. 

Amy was out of town but her friend left us the key and it was easy peasey to get in. Heads up- a number of Uber drivers we used have a hard time finding the place because it seems that whatever navigation package they use doesn't like that section of 8th ave- we found it was easier to say the cross streets than the address.

The place was clean and well appointed. There were even a few food items stashed in the fridge in case we didn't feel like checking out local restaurants (there were plenty of choices)."
3345341,18940923,2014-09-03,4315947,Lester,"We had a great stay at Amy's place. The apartment is walking distance to everything downtown. A quick and cheap train ride from the airport lands you a five minute walk away from the apartment - this was incredibly convenient.

The apartment is a great size for 2-4 people and is comfy, clean and filled with all the amenities you will beed while travelling. 

Amy was very quick to respond to any queries before, during and after our stay.  This was definitely one of the best AirBnB experiences we have had! 

Thanks for a great experience and we look forward to staying again next year. "

The area is perfect, very close to downtown, cute shops, cafés and some of the best and fresh seafood we've eaten this trip. Easy access to public transit, walking distance to the market and the waterfront. What a nice spot! I totally recommend staying here. :)"

Carpet and couch definitely need a good shampoo though."
