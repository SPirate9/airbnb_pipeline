3270492,23593156,2014-12-06,17606392,Jc,"Max was a friendly, welcoming, and helpful host.  The home was clean and conveniently located in downtown Seattle.  Access to the apartment was simple via the Light Rail, and most of the places that I was interested in visiting were really close by."
3270492,24709426,2015-01-02,21220149,Liz,"Max was an excellent host! We arrived an hour earlier than expected and Max had no problem meeting us to let us into the apartment. He stocked the kitchen with wine, yogurt, bread - everything we could have possibly needed. 

The place was perfect - we had a comfy bed, closet space to hang clothing, nice bathroom with shelving for our toiletries and plenty of towels. 

You can't beat the location! Even in December we walked everywhere. 10-ish blocks down Pike to the market, around a mile to the Space Needle, and just under a mile to pioneer square. 

Highly recommend Max and his apartment!!"
3270492,26006817,2015-02-01,25194852,Mario,"Max was a great host!! We had a late flight and Max still met us at the lobby. The space is very clean, and equally comfortable. An A+ experience all around. Thanks again Max!!!"
3270492,26121707,2015-02-03,23144591,Ezequiel,Great place. Great guy. Great location. He is also an actor and helped us practice our sales pitch :-)
3270492,26186520,2015-02-06,4274504,David,"What a great location, right between everything. Also super easy access to bus lines to get around. Nice apartment, very comfortable stay."
3270492,26300575,2015-02-09,17094707,红霞,"Max is enthusiastic and helpful！Our English are not good, so there is very little communication between us. But it is also a good experience of our first Airbnb! "
3270492,26532612,2015-02-15,16553064,Elizabeth,We had a wonderful time staying at Max' place. We had use of our own bathroom which was right across the hall from our bedroom. The shower is a small stand up shower. There wasn't much light source in the bedroom but we were only sleeping there anyway. The bed was comfortable. Max was very helpful and accommodating. The location is very central - we walked to a few tourist attractions and the downtown shopping area. Thanks for your hospitality!
3270492,26933955,2015-02-22,26928043,Kris,"Our stay with Max was awesome! Great place that is clean, comfortable, and the perfect location where we were able to walk to bars, restaurants and attractions in the downtown area. Max was very accommodating and friendly. I would highly recommend anyone to stay with Max if visiting Seattle!"
3270492,27173622,2015-02-27,27328433,Shirley,"Staying in the heart of Seattle was wonderful. Max's hospitality was warm and welcoming. Being new to the area, Max helped direct me to locations in the area within walking distance. In all, Max's place surpassed what photos can present. It was a lovely place and I look forward to visiting again."
3270492,27347252,2015-03-02,9017603,Manasa,Max's apt is in a perfect location. We were able to walk to everything and few mins away from monorail. Apartment is neat and comfy. Max is very flexible with timings and provided info about local bars. It was great stay!!
3270492,27618436,2015-03-08,28189471,Daniel,Max is a gracious and accommodating host. When I arrived at midnight--he was flexible and showed me around the neighborhood. Max conversed with me for hours about our mutual interests! 10/10 would recommend!
3270492,28171705,2015-03-19,19775802,Carly,"Max was very accommodating with our late check-in. The room was exactly how we expected the space from pictures and you have a private bathroom. Everything was perfectly comfortable and clean.  We loved the convenience of the area especially since we're from NYC and don't drive. Walking/bus/uber from Max's place made Seattle all very accessible. If Max would be so kind, we would love to stay here again!"
3270492,28320215,2015-03-22,27762872,Andrew,"Maximilian's condo was a perfect spot in which to explore Capitol Hill and downtown.  Max met up with us and was great to communicate with leading up to our stay.  His busy schedule pretty much left us to enjoy his stylish flat alone. The room was comfortably appointed with great natural light from two decently sized windows.  Be prepared to pay for parking if you're traveling by car.  The closest garage is at the convention center at $30/day or deal with street parking.  All in all, a great experience!"
3270492,28529219,2015-03-25,24553620,Kiko Ziqi,"Max is a very nice host! Staying in his apartment is a lot pleasure. Also the location is great too, easy access to Pike Market and shopping malls."
3270492,28709964,2015-03-29,11442279,Walt,"Max's apartment is clean and spacious. The location is perfect for exploring Downtown and Capitol Hill. Max met me with very short notice late at night when I arrived to Seattle from Dublin, and his generosity and kindness were constantly apparent. Thanks, Max! "
3270492,29156863,2015-04-05,21413652,Cara,The location was very convenient and Max made the whole process comfortable and easy. Thank you Max!
3270492,29477530,2015-04-07,16876650,Teri,The reservation was canceled 37 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3270492,29624122,2015-04-10,11191559,Hayley,"Max is a kind and gracious host. The apartment is spacious, tidy and very comfortable. Great location too! Would certainly stay again. "
3270492,30094555,2015-04-17,1533204,Christopher,Max was a great host! He made sure I had everything I needed. His apartment is great and very centrally located downtown. Highly recommended!
3270492,30214137,2015-04-19,19584902,Pablo,"Max is a cool guy. 
He has a great place right in the heart of seattle. You get your own bathroom which is awesome. 
Will definetely ping him again on my next Seattle visit. "
3270492,31878303,2015-05-11,5533063,Danielle,"Max was a very courteous host. His apartment was in the perfect location for us to walk to the market, the space needle and other tourist attractions in the downtown area. The apartment was clean and provided all of the amenities that we needed (although the bed was oddly missing a flat sheet). Overall, we had a great experience!"
3270492,33711150,2015-05-31,33115275,Christopher,Max was a great host. I enjoyed my time in Seattle.
3270492,35193316,2015-06-16,18343090,Dennis,"Great stay in Seattle. Max was an excellent host, the apt was clean and comfortable, and the location allowed walking to main tourist area in the city."
3270492,35636623,2015-06-21,6639326,Christina,"Staying at Max's place was great! The location was awesome, we were within walking distance of so many great bars and restaurants as well as downtown. He gave us some recommendations for the area and was very helpful with things to do. His place was just as pictured; everything looks great and the bed was super comfortable! All in all, our experience with Max was awesome! My husband and I would definitely stay at his place again!"
3270492,36013822,2015-06-24,26635082,Leigh,"If you are looking for a great place to stay while seeing Seattle without walking out the door into a sea of other tourists, this is the place. We enjoyed conversations with Max and his friend, slept well, felt safe and enjoyed the spotless private room and bath.
In the heart of a very expensive city, this place is a real ""find."""
3270492,36363223,2015-06-28,26903127,Jim,"This apartment is really lovely, a short walk from the action it a $5 Uber ride to Pike Place Market or the Space Needle.  Max is a brilliant host helping us with our bags, showing us around and providing great tips for our stay.  "
3270492,37032746,2015-07-04,9691696,Suzi,Beautiful spacious room within walking distance of major attractions. Max is a wonderful and generous host who has lots of good suggestions. We were super comfortable and would love to stay here again sometime.
3270492,39265685,2015-07-22,5021518,Susan,"Max ist ein sehr netter Gastgeber, der uns herzlich willkommen hat und uns wie zu Hause fühlen lassen hat. Unser Zimmer und separates Bad waren sehr sauber und wir durften uns frei im Wohnzimmer und Küche bewegen. Max hatte auch sehr gute Insider-Tips für die Stadt, was man unternehmen kann und wo es was leckeres zu essen gibt.
Wir können ihn wärmstens empfehlen und würden immer wieder bei ihm wohnen :)"
3270492,39731618,2015-07-26,28652235,Christine & Kirk,"Absolutely wonderful stay with Max in Seattle! Location was perfect for getting to all attractions on foot, and made you feel like a local! Accommodations were clean and quiet. Max was available when we needed him but gave us plenty of privacy and space to come and go as we pleased. 
Would definitely recommend staying with Max, and we will definitely be staying with him the next time we come to Seattle!"
3270492,40294096,2015-07-29,12798998,Laurence,"Very responsive, welcoming & accommodating. Compact, well appointed apartment, comfortable bed, excellent attention to details eg toiletries, clothes hangers"
3270492,41688452,2015-08-08,39540059,Shailja,"Excellent stay. Great location, beautiful apartment. Arlo was helpful in making my Seattle trip fun! "
3270492,42454949,2015-08-13,39969753,David,"Great place to stay, both in terms of location, the space itself and arlo being a fine host."
3270492,43288858,2015-08-18,19059626,Antonio,Perfect host. Room very clean and comfortable. Everything was good!
3270492,44176838,2015-08-24,39374682,Ru-Ting,"The apartment was great. It was maintained nicely, clean and located in a good area, quiet and convenient for exploring the downtown area.  Maxi and Arlo were undoubtedly great. They were nice, generous and easygoing people. We were freely to use everything we needed. It was such a nice experience while we stayed  in this lovely place."
3270492,47058802,2015-09-15,91308,Sho,"Great location, and Maximillian is super friendly. The room and bathroom were equipped with everything we needed. Enjoyed staying here for our first visit out to Seattle."
3270492,47687399,2015-09-21,40058937,Leana,"Max was such a nice host! Everything was just as described and we found everything to be nice and clean. I had forgotten shampoo and Max already had some for us in our shower = lifesaver! 

Also, Max gave us great recommendations for food and both places we went to were delicious! This guy knows his stuff :) 

He was very sweet and quiet and we never felt uncomfortable. He even invited us to see the play his company was showing, but unfortunately, we didn't have time. 

 It was nice to come and go as we pleased. The location was also great, about a 10-minute walk to Pike Place market and most of the locations we had to go to. From his place, an Uber ride to any of the main attractions ranged from about $5-$7 which was very doable.

 I loved the bed sheets - very soft! He even left the light on for us in our room when we came home very late one night. Great place to stay and a very nice guy! Thanks for everything Max!"
3270492,49003112,2015-09-30,40079191,Daryl,"A great choice! I have no complaints about my stay. It's a fantastic location and the apartment is clean with your own bathroom.  Unfortunately I can't review the host, because I barely saw him due to being out most of the time. So it actually felt like I was staying in a hotel! But my few encounters were positive. Max is a friendly laid back guy and made me feel very welcome. "
3270492,49778541,2015-10-06,11870960,Victoria,Max was a great host. He was kind enough to wait for us and show us around the apartment upon our arrival.  We did not see him much during our trip as we we're out for most of the day.  Room was perfect for two people.    
3270492,50957878,2015-10-16,19402431,Michelle,"I cannot say enough great things about Max and this airbnb location! Max was very flexible about our check-in and out time. He was very informative about things to see and more importantly, EAT! He's not kidding when he says that his place is a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market (I timed it myself!). Also, f Starbucks Roastery and Reserve and Taylor's shellfish is on your list of places to visit while you're visiting, this airbnb location is literally 2 blocks away - just saying :).

I think the gesture that made me feel really welcomed was when Max texted me after our first night there to ask if everything was okay and if we had slept well. I thought that was great hospitality and I feel very lucky to have found this gem. Thank you Max for a great stay!"
3270492,52052881,2015-10-26,13834756,Shane,Maximillian was a great host! The space was very comfortable and clean. He had great recommendations for places to check out and was very friendly and generous. Highly recommended. 
3270492,52566628,2015-10-31,2821210,Margaret,"Max was a great host.  I arrived a half hour early and he met me at the door of his building.  The apartment was clean.  The room had a comfortable bed and separate bathroom.  It was right next to the Convention Center, with restaurants and a movie theater within 2-3 blocks.  Max said I was welcome to use his fridge and even cook if I wanted to.  Great experience!"
3270492,53328209,2015-11-08,42479441,Vachelle,This apartment is in the perfect location! Just a short rap from the light rail station. Right in the heart of downtown and walking distance from the Pike Place Market. But even better than that is that it was walking distance from so many excellent little restaurants and bars that weren't touristy. Max's apartment was very clean and quiet. We hardly saw him because he a very busy man and we were out exploring all day but he was so nice and provided everything we needed. I loved the neighborhood and would definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle. 
3270492,54604636,2015-11-22,1483773,Virginie,"We loved our week-end at Max's place! The location is really awesome, we could walk to a lot of neighborhoods and enjoyed it a lot. Max's place is great, comfy and max was very kind. Strongly suggest!"
3270492,56779212,2015-12-18,15503774,Cherrie,"Max was there to welcome me and my boyfriend upon arrival. His room was very cozy and clean, nothing to complain about :)

Thanks Max!"
3270492,57614452,2015-12-27,41228278,Ying,"Live with host, who just worked to NY.  He was hepful and ask his friend to pass the key. Good location, clean rooms and the kitchen is free to use. The bathroom is small."
5402304,27743382,2015-03-10,7043575,Rick,"Michele and Denny are among the most gracious and accommodating hosts ever. They made me feel immediately at home and were anxious to ensure my comfort and satisfaction in every way. They were responsive to any inquiries or requests that I had.

The apartment is beautifully done with top quality finishes and kitchen hardware and appliances. It is well planned and laid out and offers plenty of space for two to four guests to be quite comfortable. The location is excellent with many great dining options nearby and easy access to several important Seattle neighborhoods. Downtown Seattle is easily accessed via either I-5 or SR99 and neighboring Ballard and Wallingford offer many great dining and entertainment options for days or evenings to complement those right in your backyard in Fremont. Can't say enough good things about this listing which is also a great value!!!!"
5402304,40905323,2015-08-03,475868,Sarah,"Staying here was excellent!  The flat exceeded all my expectations, and everything you could think of (hangers, kitchen equipment, etc.) was there and brand new.  Fremont is also a great neighbourhood and the flat is very well situated!

Michele and Denny also went above and beyond as hosts - I stayed for a month (and had various guests throughout, which was not a problem) and they checked in regularly in a way that was thoughtful but not intrusive.  I wholeheartedly recommend staying here!"
5402304,43019277,2015-08-17,68362,Caroline,My daughter and I very much enjoyed our stay at The Fremont Flat. Denny and Michele were very welcoming and even supplied us with lovely fresh eggs from their backyard chickens. The flat was beautiful and spacious. 
5402304,43599283,2015-08-20,9294958,Felicity,The host canceled this reservation 122 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5402304,44305116,2015-08-25,4762533,Stephanie,"We loved staying at Michele and Denny's in Fremont! The flat offers luxurious accommodations with easy access to all that Fremont and Seattle have to offer -- it is within walking distance to the bike trail, Fremont, and there are many bus lines to downtown right outside your door. Michele and Denny are generous hosts who made us feel right at home with fresh fruits, fresh eggs from their chickens, and fresh flowers! They paid close attention to the details in this remodel -- we would definitely return on our next visit to Seattle!"
5402304,44936856,2015-08-30,38931815,Cindy,"Michele was the most gracious host and even invited me for a tour of their other rentals.  The Fremont Flat was a most amazing place to stay, beautifully designed and comfortable.  Everything you could need was available.  The chickens provided delicious eggs and the flat is within walking distance to many tourist locations. I would stay here again if I ever return to Seattle. Thank you Michele, I have never felt so welcome in a hotel or a city."
5402304,46386820,2015-09-10,25061176,Lizette,"The Fremont flat was fantastic!!! Out hosts, Michele and Denny were wonderfully attentive and generous. The space is beautifully decorated, spacious and clean. We love to cook so the kitchen was perfect. Would love to stay there again next time we visit Seattle. "
5402304,47979230,2015-09-22,33829841,Mary,"We were made very welcome and the apartment is actually nicer than the pictures! Extremely comfortable, facilities very high end. Location ideal, good neighbourhood. We'll be back, I would be happy to recommend it to anyone.
Thanks, Michelle and Denny"
5402304,48714337,2015-09-28,4901025,Janet,"The Fremont Flat was a perfect place to stay while we brought our daughter to move in at UW. We wanted an alternative to a hotel in the University District where we could start getting to know other Seattle neighborhoods. The flat was impeccable-very new, modern, and comfortable. Michele was very accommodating when we arrived late at night and helped us get acclimated. The neighborhood is close to everything and only a couple of miles to UW. We would definitely come back."
6783394,36912945,2015-07-02,32859553,Mustapha,"Mack was very kind. We were the first guests to stay at the apartment, and unfortunately the host didn't have time to set it up as advertised. One example: when he met us at the apt, He let us know that he'd moved in the day before, and that the wireless wouldn't be hooked for a couple of days. He kindly provided a hotspot password as a temporary solution, but the speeds were inadequate to accomplish what we needed. 

As I said, Mack was very kind as a host. But our stay as the ""guinea pigs"" at this property was not perfect. Location was convenient, but parking complicated. Best not to have a car here. "
6783394,37793049,2015-07-10,3341011,Joni,"My son and I stayed at Mack's loft for just a quick overnight trip to Seattle. The place is clean and well care for. Parking isn't available within the garage. And super limited at best, on the street. However , the loft sits right off the main street of Elliot so public transportation is easily accessible. (Once you're inside the apartment the sound of traffic is minimal. )
Located up the hill a few block is N Queen Anne with plenty of shops , coffee & restaurants. Be prepared to walk up some steep hills! The waterfront is across the street and easily accessed as well. 
All in all the space served us well for our purpose and Mack was very accommodating. "
6783394,38550317,2015-07-16,37802809,Guerin,"The place was wonderful; a cool loft right across from the water.  I used the kitchen and laundry as well which all worked great.  They even had a few fresh snacks in the fridge.  I left some as well following my stay.

Mack had his contact meet me and walked me through the place.  It's right next to downtown ($5 uber ride away) and perfectly located.

Only thing I would mention is that you are on a fairly busy street.  There's also no a/c which sounds pretty normal for Seattle however it was unusually warm.  Plenty of fans through the unit and the windows allow lots of air in.

Lastly, it's right across the street from an AWESOME running path.  I did 4 miles 2x across a ped bridge and directly against the water - an absolutely awesome run and lots of active people there.

I would totally recommend this place."
6783394,38897020,2015-07-19,24500179,Marc,Mack is a very helpful and friendly host . His apartment was very clean and cosy. Location is good too. We had a great stay in Seattle! Thank you Mack!
6783394,39135478,2015-07-20,38798959,Manvir,"It was my first time using AirBNB and I was hesitant at first but Mack made us feel welcome. He was there waiting for us and directions were straight forward. It is a nice, clean, modern loft and exactly as in the description. Having 2 washrooms (1.5 to be exact) was a plus when getting ready in the morning or getting ready to go out. The only downside was that there was no A/C and it was one of the hottest days of the year but to counter that Mack supplied us with 3 fans which did help a lot. I would stay here again as I do visit Seattle often. 
   "
6783394,39796092,2015-07-26,29851162,Brent,Mack was a very attentive host.  Seattle was in the middle of a heat wave and the apartment was pretty warm (facing West) so he went out and bought a portable A/C to help cool the place down. Kudos to Mack.  He really tried his best to make us feel comfortable and at home. Public transport across the street was very handy to Downtown.
6783394,40386777,2015-07-30,24534178,Tara,"Mack is an amazing host! I can't say enough good things about the place and his hospitality. Not only were the details thought out, but he went above and beyond to coordinate check-in and check-out while being incredibly responsive. 

It's evident he cares very much about his guest's experience. He respects the Airbnb vision and provided a very accurate description. 

The location is perfect and so is the place. I highly recommend booking. "
6783394,40927700,2015-08-03,22626929,Linda,"First, Mack is an amazing host! From our first interaction after confirming, he went above and beyond by sharing his home, city details, restaurants, grocery store, attractions and was available by phone or email should something needed. Nothing needed!! The location could not be any better for downtown and waterfront (Pike's) and the loft has everything you need and then some! My husband and I loved the bed, awesome sleep! It was unusually hot, he had a portable air conditioner installed!! What hasn't he thought of? Even topped it off with some very nice ear plugs!! We had a great visit, our first in Seattle, and, I have to say, having such a great interaction with Mack pretty much foreshadowed a great time!  It is 1.5 miles from Pike's market, walkable if not time constrained, or 8 minutes by Uber or Taxi. "
6783394,41373851,2015-08-07,36007356,Eddie,"First time in Seattle and loved the experience. Great Unit, it was clean but unusually hot during our stay. Portable ac is available as well as portable fan both downstairs and upstairs. Make sure u lock windows while away,  portable ac is hooked up to window  and needs to be cracked open to let air out, since unit is on 1st floor be careful cuz a person can squeeze thru the window. Also the window next to door needs to be LOCKED if u leave it cracked open someone can stick their hand thru the window and unlock your door, please beware! Besides that unit is close to pikes market and nice eatery spots up the steep hill. If u decide to cook whole foods and Safeway is close by. If u decide to get a parking spot in garage make sure u have small car, parking stall are tight fitting. I had a Ford Mustang my girl 5""2  had to park car and she had tough time getting out of car. The stall that was provided to us had a wall to the right and to the left was car that didn't move during our entire stay. "
6783394,41667557,2015-08-08,19521750,Leif,"Great location, near downtown and waterfront. A little noisy since its by busy street"
6783394,42279916,2015-08-12,5019767,John,"Mack is easy to reach for checkin and questions, and he was awesome giving tips for dining, shopping, and neighborhoods to see. "
6783394,42912752,2015-08-16,28893468,Joe,"This loft is in a great central location, close to Belltown, Downtown, Fremont, and Queen Anne neighborhoods.  There is also a convenience store less than a block away for those last minute supplies.  The space was well stocked with essentials like cookware, bathroom supplies, and had very nice appliances (TV, dishwasher, washer/dryer) perfect for a longer stay.  Mack and Diane were also very gracious hosts, making me feel at home from the very beginning and answering my questions promptly throughout our stay!"
6783394,43430461,2015-08-19,29631292,Hong & Sofia,"Everything was perfect. Perfect location in my opinion, everything was within a 2 minute drive or a $5 Uber ride. I would highly recommend getting the parking permit from Diane & Mack. The place looked really nice and provided us a great home base. The place was perfectly described and I knew exactly what to expect when I arrived to to their excellent communications skills"
6783394,44013960,2015-08-23,40723717,Luis,"This place was awesome! Super cool loft, had everything I needed and was in an area where everything was a quick Uber ride away. Mack was super helpful when I needed him, responded to text messages and even offered to come by and reset the wireless router when it was running slow! I would totally recommend this loft to anyone I know! Thank for the great place to stay, Mack!

"
6783394,45488102,2015-09-03,9428982,Carey,"A great apartment in a good location of Seattle. Plenty of space and amenities, good welcome and I had everything I needed here.

There is a beautiful area to go running nearby.. ask Diane or Mack!

Thank you guys for making your apartment available and for making me feel so welcome."
6783394,45848827,2015-09-06,22581619,Nivia,"Having never been to Seattle before, I was initially wary of the loft's location on a busy street, in a seemingly remote location. However, I quickly realized that everything was accessible within a 5-7 minute drive. The loft also came with a parking spot, a rare gem in Seattle.

The loft itself is clean, comfortable and cozy. As others have mentioned, there is some noise from the street; however it's barely audible in the sleeping loft. The furniture was also very comfortable; and I thoroughly enjoyed the free Roku subscription, with Netflix, HBOGo and other favorites.

Lastly, you couldn't have asked for a better host with Mack; he was quick and attentive and made my husband and I feel welcomed. 

Overall, I started out wary but ended up very delighted with my choice. This is a hidden gem!"
6783394,46157043,2015-09-08,14421790,Liz,The loft was clean and everything was accurate as it appears on the listing.  Rooftop was amazing and location is perfect for jogging/running by the beach.
6783394,46528847,2015-09-11,19410994,Shane,"Had a great visit here and would recommend to others. Apartment is in a great location accessible to many cool spots. Accommodations are very comfortable and everything in excellent working order. 

Only downside as others have mentioned is the window situation - tough to leave them open for better circulation when weather is warmer because they increase noise from busy street and also could make apartment less secure.  The fans help a lot to alleviate this issue  "
6783394,46643574,2015-09-12,15376172,Peter,"We had a great stay at Mack and Diane's place--it was very clean, centrally located and nicely appointed. 

Appreciated the easy communication and early check-in!"
6783394,47120980,2015-09-15,43805893,Ryan,The stay I had with Mack and Diane was amazing! They were very nice and quick to respond. The home was a very nice loft located on the north side of DT Seattle. We walked to the Space Needle in 20 minutes. 
6783394,47235548,2015-09-16,22939717,Christopher,"It was a beautiful loft.  Clean, modern and accommodating. They were punctual in handing over the keys and there was a parking space for our vehicle.  Thanks for letting us stay in your wonderful home!!"
6783394,47543604,2015-09-20,19866181,Stella,"The loft is gorgeous, and exactly as pictured. We were too introverted to seek out the communal balcony, so we never caught the view, but the location's just a stone's throw from the water. We were able to walk to the EMP and Space Needle, and everything else was a $10 Uber.

The apartment is meticulously clean, and the furniture all comfy and new, and Mack and Diane were friendly, helpful, and fantastic about communication. We had a great stay overall, but if you're a light sleeper be aware that the front door is frosted glass, so diffused streetlight glows through at night. Because it's a loft, there's no blocking this out from the bedroom, so if you need total darkness grab an eyemask. "
6783394,47874437,2015-09-21,6932303,Carolyn,"Listing was exactly as described - very clean with everything we needed for our one night stay in Seattle. Minor downsides were that the upper floor got a bit stuffy when the windows were closed and the place is located on a higher traffic street. Closing the windows took out most of the noise from traffic though :). 

The location is close to the water and a healthy walk away from the main tourist spots (took us about 20 minutes to walk to Pike Place area). The walk to Pike Place was gorgeous since we passed through Olympic Sculpture Park.

Mack & Diane were able to accommodate a slightly earlier check in which was fantastic. There was a slight hiccup in communication around check in and check out but we were still able to check in and out without issue, though we didn't get to meet Mack in person."
6783394,48152951,2015-09-23,42775521,Guy,"Amazing apartment! Stayed 2 nights with my girlfriend. 
When we arrived Mack kindly greeted us and showed the place and parking. 
Apartment had everything we needed and more! We felt right at home.
The rooftop of the building has a very cool place to hang out.
We walked to pike place market and downtown, took us about 20 minutes. Uber back cost us 6$.
Mack is truly the best host. We accidentally forgot the apartment's umbrella in our bag when we left but when I told Mack what happened he just said ""no worries :) it's cool that you have it."""
6783394,48340395,2015-09-25,21374011,Jordan,Diane and Mack were excellent hosts and their loft was gorgeous. Perfect location to walk around and enjoy great food and drink. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle!
6783394,48760995,2015-09-28,43297434,Philip,"Good location, nice apartment with easy & prompt communications and straightforward check-in with Dianne and Mack. "
6783394,49064102,2015-09-30,29595316,Sarah,Wonderful location and within walking distance to most anything you want to see in Seattle. We like to walk so it was just perfect. Very clean and all necessary amenities were available. Thanks Mack and Diane!
6783394,49237165,2015-10-02,27235662,Sheldon,first off the place was great! we did not get to meet Diane but we did get to meet Mack and he was courteous enough to meet us at 1130 at night to show us the apartment. He also left us a lil map and places to eat. over all the place was exactly what we were looking for. if I had to leave something negative to say it would only be the fact that we were on ground floor but we actually liked that but I know others wouldn't. so all in all 5 STARS goes too this lil loft 
6783394,49812099,2015-10-06,34821064,Robert,The stay was fantastic.  Our host greeted us and showed us how everything operated and where everything was and stayed long enough to fill us in on some of the attractions around town.  I can't wait till I need to go up there again.  I will definitely give them a shout.
6783394,50219041,2015-10-10,4327514,Qianqian,The apartment is awesome. We had a really great time there. 
6783394,50413756,2015-10-11,2192271,Anna,"Diane and Mack were amazing hosts. They were very welcoming and helpful. The place is very clean, cozy, private and in a great location. "
6783394,50716050,2015-10-13,22460289,Teresa,"The loft is warm and clean. The bed and pillow are very soft. The TV connected to Chromecast so that you could watch movie in your iPhone (even Youtube and bilibili) conveniently. The location is not very far from Pike market, you can call a uber to visit downtown Seattle and it would cost around 8 dollars. Btw, although we didn't meet Diane & Mack, they still give us some suggestions by messages. It's a good choice to settle down, would consider it next time. "
6783394,50755794,2015-10-14,8030092,Rita,"This apartment was easy to get to, spotless, comfortable and affordable.  It is modern and has all the amenities you could want.  
Mack and Diane responded immediately to my questions and texts.
They thought ahead by providing ear plugs since the street traffic can be significant at rush hours.  
Thank you Mack and Diane!  "
6783394,51833740,2015-10-24,23292602,Alanna,We enjoyed staying at Diane and Mack's apartment in Seattle. It was spacious and in a great neighborhood. It was a little noisy (it's located on a busy street) so if you are one of those people who need absolute quiet it would be something to take into consideration. 
6783394,52022659,2015-10-25,15936411,Ed,Diane and smacks place was great. They were very accommodating and everything was clean and well appointed.  
6783394,52523933,2015-10-30,46423318,Casey,We loved staying at Diane & Mack's loft! It was exactly as advertised & very close to downtown attractions!
6783394,52934296,2015-11-02,780508,Anushka,"This loft is beautiful, very clean and tidy. There was a coffee maker and a few granola bars provided. We walked everywhere and there's a nice running path nearby. Only downside is that it's a little noisy but they provide earplugs and it didn't disturb our sleep at all.
One thing to note - parking is $25 a day for a secure spot and our spot was taken when we arrived, an unpleasant surprise on a rainy Seattle evening! Diane and Mack suggested that we talk with the property manager about it which didn't sound fun during vacation (particularly because they had mentioned on the listing that we should be careful what we say to them, so just seemed confusing and stressful), so instead we parked outside for the weekend and were afraid to take our car anywhere in case we couldn't find one of the few free 24 hour spots nearby. Additionally Diane and Mack didn't offer to refund us for parking until we brought it up. "
6783394,53284721,2015-11-07,21453,Katy,"We had a great stay in Seattle! The loft was clean and perfectly located- only a short Uber to Pike Market Place, Capitol Hill, and lots of killer coffee shops. Parking was easy as well."
6783394,53631131,2015-11-10,47136383,Chris,Mack made us feel welcomed by providing suggestions for restaurants/breweries and by being extremely responsive in the preliminary booking stages.  He was more than accommodating in all aspects.  I originally booked another of Mack's locations which turned out to be unavailable during our trip dates.  He offered the 600 Elliott Ave location and honored the original pricing; I appreciated the accountability and fairness.  The listing was accurate and the place was perfect for our stay.  The loft complex was safe but the loft was on a busy street and not really walking distance from downtown.  I enjoyed my stay at Mack's listing and would stay here again. 
6783394,54026875,2015-11-15,47812320,Kristine,"The loft was perfect, exactly like the pictures! My friend and I thorougly enjoyed the space. I'm very picky when it comes to lodging & this did not feel as if you were ""staying at someone's"" house - meaning it was hotel-like yet with a wonderful cozy and warm atmosphere. Very close to downtown, extremely clean, well-appointed amenities including ear plugs for the street traffic which didn't bother me - that coming from a light sleeper that actually slept downstairs on the comfy couch. It took a while and some back-n-forth msgs to figure out how to use Chromecast. But Mack and Sophia were great & fast with responses. Street parking has limited hours but still great if you don't mind moving it before the morning traffic rush. Can't wait to return for another stay!"
6783394,54614352,2015-11-22,8077478,Kenneth,"The loft is gorgeous and spacious, with all the necessary amenities. It is about 30 mins to Pikes Place as mention through a very scenic walk through Olympia Sculpture park. The roof top looks awesome though it was too cold during our stay to properly enjoy. The kitchen was well equipped as well if you are looking for some cooking from ingredients from Pikes Place market. 

Mack and Sophia was responsive throughout and would recommend for your stay in  Seattle. 

As per some who mentioned, the unit is along the main street with windows which we left shut during the stay. As it was cold, we did not had any issues. "
6783394,54895132,2015-11-25,23725035,James,"We had a great stay at this beautiful loft!  We loved that it was centrally located to downtown Seattle, and really enjoyed the rooftop deck overlooking the water.  The loft was really clean and exactly as described, however it was a bit noisy at times, being located on a major street.  Overall, we would highly recommend this listing!"
6783394,55036820,2015-11-27,48508175,Ian,"Mack and Sophia were excellent hosts and both my girlfriend and I felt very comfortable in their home trying airbnb for only our second time. They not only responded quickly to any of our questions about the location and check in/out instructions but were also cool by providing us a list of places to check out in the city. The bed was very comfortable and their home provided more than enough space for two.  All I can say further is that the easy check in instructions sent to us through email helped us to quickly drop off our stuff and get back to the downtown area and enjoy such an eclectic city as Seattle. Great vacation, thanks you two."
6783394,55332004,2015-11-29,49999438,Kristin,"We had a very nice stay . Apartment was nice , clean and  hosts were excellent with communication . "
6783394,55622511,2015-12-03,3429394,Stanislav,"Hypercritical host, but nice apartment, may be a little bit noisy, cause located near the road.
"
6783394,55919858,2015-12-07,767152,Nichol,"Nice and easy stay at Mack's place.  Very clean, smooth check-in process and conveniently located.  We easily walked to Queen Ann, Belltown and Seattle Center, even in the pouring rain:). 

There is street noise, but that can be remedied by the ear plugs they provide, or, like we did, by simply climbing into the uber comfortable bed.  Seriously, the bed was awesome - great night's sleep!"
6783394,56049916,2015-12-08,1662875,Jessica,"The hosts and place were great! I didn't meet them in person, but received detailed information prior to arrival and had no trouble getting into the unit or checking out. 

The place was spacious and had everything we needed in a great, accessible location. The linens and bed were nice. There were a few nice touches like leaving earplugs on the nightstands in case guests needed further insulation from any street noise (though it wasn't a problem for us). We didn't have time during our stay to make use of the kitchen or living area, but they appeared well-equipped and comfortable, making this a good option for a short or longer stay. 

I'll definitely check it out if I'm in Seattle again and will encourage my friends to do the same."
6783394,56577599,2015-12-14,49182702,Sabah,"I had to make a rushed reservation and Mack was very accommodating and communicated quickly. Their posting was very accurate and a comfortable home base. My Uber trips to downtown were about 5 minutes, it can add up so I would plan on being efficient with commuting downtown."
6783394,56928342,2015-12-20,44434412,Simon,"This was the best airbnb experience I ever had. Mack and Sophia were really responsive and carried a caring mentality since day 1. The loft is beautiful and was perfect for me and my girlfriend. Everything you need from laundry detergent to cups to a laundry basket is there for you to use. The chromecast was also set up already so you can enjoy a movie or tv shows with no lag on the streaming at any of my usage. Although Seattle is known for rain and it did rain pretty bad sometime during our stay, having a loft like this to stay warm and cosy isn't too bad at all! My girlfriend and I gave this loft a 5/5!"
6783394,57310716,2015-12-24,10077991,Yue,"My first impression is noble, I really like the style of the house. Bluetooth speakers, wireless television, this is a very relaxed environment. Outdoor is the sea. Comfortable and cozy loft bed so I spent three wonderful evening. Mack is a great and thoughtful, he very quickly done all my requirements. And on the kitchen wall have some suggestions and helping that he leave. Clean, comfortable, and convenient transportation. This is for you most satisfied with the choice."
6783394,58164015,2016-01-01,21299661,Thomas,"Mack & Sophia were awesome hosts and their loft was perfect. It was clean and spacious, and they provided clear instructions. Their place is in a central location to all of Seattle's Must-See areas. We definitely enjoyed our stay. "
5228066,28447901,2015-03-23,16645756,Sheryl,"Allison is a wonderful host in every way. She replied very quickly to the initial inquiry, responded promptly to questions, and went over and above with flexibility regarding the dates we needed her apartment for. The apartment is exactly as described and shown in photos--immaculately clean and lovely. Highly recommended!"
5228066,47260512,2015-09-17,39561354,David,"Allison's apartment is as advertised - sunny, spacious, and beautiful.  This was our first experience with Airbnb, and we felt very much at home.  We enjoyed being able to make our own breakfast each morning, and to relax and watch TV when we returned at the end of the day.  The decor of the apartment is fascinating: artwork and photos from Africa, and license plates from several foreign countries and Alaska.

The apartment is conveniently located with quick access to Seattle's major highways.  There are supermarkets, and a neat Italian restaurant close by.  "
4679983,25273482,2015-01-11,24403183,Erin,"Mark was a great host and the apartment was completely charming. I found it far more relaxing as a home base than a hotel, and much more affordable. I slept great here.

The neighborhood is perfect for walking, but there is a parking pass if you have a car (another huge saver!). Plenty of great coffeeshops and chill bars for tapas, cocktails and microbrews."
4679983,25387204,2015-01-14,23357819,Fan Hsuan,"It's definitely a very good place for traveling, household is a very good guy. I love the atmosphere make me feel home, but girls should bring hair dryer themselves."
4679983,25934581,2015-01-30,25857139,Brian,Everything was all set and very clean when I got there.  Mark was very helpful and flexible with me moving to Seattle and overall the process was so simple.  Great location as well! 
4679983,27085223,2015-02-24,2257446,Tina,The reservation was canceled 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4679983,28222974,2015-03-20,28709966,Teresa,"This place feels like home! Looking to move into the area and want to daydream about what living in Capitol Hill would feel like? This place is for you.

I spent most of my days out and about in the city. This apartment was the perfect location to pop in and take a nap, then go out again in the evening. Close to restaurants and walking distance to evening events. 

I didn't have a problem with the office space and enjoyed being able to ask for food tips."
4679983,29750455,2015-04-12,21098257,Kenny,Mark was a great host and told us about some local restaurants and stuff to do in the area. We were gone by the time he and his team got to work every morning so it felt like we had the place all to ourselves. We even made a mistake in our booking and he was super flexible and worked with us. Highly recommended!
4679983,30424312,2015-04-21,1816520,Lou,"Mark was really communicative with me about the process of getting into the apartment, which went really smoothly. The room was affordable, close to the convention center, and worked really well since I was out and about while Mark was using it as an office during the day. "
4679983,30517986,2015-04-23,30672824,Julius And Catherine,"In short: Rooftop views, chill atmosphere, awesome neighborhood and great host!

Mark is a super laid-back guy and has a really sweet airbnb location in Capitol Hill. The neighborhood has tons of cafes, restaurants and shops within walking distance, practically next door. Our place was on the 6th floor in this charming building that seemed to be a hotel before. It has tons of character, a good example being this elevator which you had to open the door yourself. Loved it!

When we arrived, Mark gave us a warm welcome, showed us the place and introduced us to his coworkers. They use the space as an office, which is pretty cool because my friend and I had the place to ourselves during the evening. Though I'm sure I would've been comfortable chillin' in the living room while they were working, had my friend and I not gone exploring. The view from the apartment is awesome; you can see the space needle from the living room. Our bedroom and bathroom were clean and tidy.

All in all, it was a very painless and comfortable experience staying at Mark's place. Would definitely recommend!"
4679983,40714426,2015-08-02,27005316,Daniel,"Mark was a great host.  It was my first Airbnb experience, and Mark made it feel like home for three months.  It was a perfect place to stay for the summer.  I rarely saw Mark's coworkers, since I left for work early and arrived late, but when I did, it was always pleasant.  I couldn't have imagined a better location to spend the summer; the flat was in the heart of Capitol Hill, surrounded by restaurants and bars, but without the noise, and the living room had a view of the skyline.  All in all, I could not have asked for a better experience.  "
4679983,41760943,2015-08-09,29909099,Ben,"This place is amazing! exactly as the title says it is a perfect sleep and work space right in the centre of Seattle within walking distance of everything.
So simple, so perfect, i couldn't have asked for more."
4679983,42541344,2015-08-14,22549309,Amy,"We had a good stay at Mark's place! The location was great, everything was in order and Mark was a great communicator! He gave us detailed recommendations of what to do in Seattle. The drawback was the apartment building itself is old, with old style elevator and old bathroom fixtures. Overall a good stay."
4679983,44149759,2015-08-24,20220706,Martin,"Great place to stay, amazing location, everything what you can see in Seattle is very close. Mark was amazing host, always willing to help us with anything."
4679983,44580686,2015-08-27,1540717,Alex,"Mark was communicative and helpful.  While he and his team are sometimes around working during the day, we were pretty busy ourselves during those times, so it still felt like we had the place to ourselves for the most part.  Location is very convenient."
4679983,51466323,2015-10-20,30067752,Lauren,"Seattle is wonderful! We had a restful fall break and Mark's place was perfect for our stay. Close to a lot of coffee spots and really good local food. You literally walk down a long hill, a little less than a mile, to Pike Place Market and the waterfront! Walking back up that hill has given me better looking calves :) We could not have asked for a better location. The older style apartment was cozy and Mark was really good at communicating about when he and his coworkers would be there. I would definitely stay here again. "
4679983,52407678,2015-10-29,5094623,Pramote,"Everything was great!  Mark was a very helpful and fun to meet--wish we had more time to talk.  The location is very nice.  The room and the whole apartment is very comfortable.  I was out most the time and got back late--so I felt like I got the whole apartment to myself.  The building is very classic.  Only one thing, the elevator is an old one with manual door--it is kind scary at first, but pretty classy.  Love everything!"
4679983,52747650,2015-11-01,46506897,Alexa,"I enjoyed staying here. The apartment was centrally located in fun Capitol Hill. It was a beautiful walk straight to Convention Center and Pike Market. The apartment was in beautiful condition but had a lot of character at the same time. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable. I had everything I needed from extra blankets to towels. There was even an umbrella for the rainy Seattle weather. Overall, a terrific stay. Just remember to clarify check-in and check-out time."
4679983,53062987,2015-11-04,20586174,Jennifer,"Cute apartment in a great location. You are right in the heart of everything. Older building but spacious enough. Our stay was not for fun on this trip, but we would recommend this to anyone that wants to be in walking distance of the sights, restaurants etc"
4679983,53336245,2015-11-08,14101045,Katelyn,Can't beat the location if attending a conference at the convention center. Near many local bars & restaurants. Clean space. Comfortable bed. Charming old school elevator :)
4679983,54866382,2015-11-25,45854677,Mehdi,"I had a pleasant stay at Mark's place. 
He is so kind and welcoming. The place is also clean, lovely, and close to various business and entertainment facilities. "
4679983,55215350,2015-11-29,7444795,Donald,"Great Location! Everything in Capitol Hill and Downtown accessible most easily by walking and or transit. Great restaurants, great vibe, great building with character. Great space for anchoring oneself and tackling your Seattle List or just wander from. Very basic accommodations, large space and great view. Mark made it easy to come and go, never even saw him. And for me, the afternoon sun in the apartment was a great bonus-of course its Seattle, so the sun may not shine-and permitted me a few minutes to relax with a brandy, look out over the city and get refueled for the evening holiday events."
4679983,55740845,2015-12-05,22687771,Sandra,"This is a very good place to stay in a great location. It was just as Mark described it. Nothing fancy but very comfortable apartment in an historic 1926 built apartment building. Really gives a sense of what it would have been like to live in Seattle in the boom of the 20's. Full kitchen and bath. Very clean and with everything you need. Lots of space for stowing luggage, including the spacious walk-in closet in the bedroom. Very quiet at night as bedroom is away from the street, and you are up high. Lively neighborhood and safe to walk around at night. As Mark said, shared space in the front room with a person or two working on computer sometimes during the day work hours. No problem at all. Mark was a good host. Good communications and helped get me oriented to the neighborhood. "
4679983,56377373,2015-12-13,35667605,Ryan,The apartment was is a great location with fun nightlife easily walkable. The apartment was warm and clean with a comfortable bed and a nice hot shower. I only encountered workers twice in my 7 day stay and they were friendly and accommodating. Mark was also very friendly and helpful.
4679983,56672978,2015-12-16,46583471,Erica,"My best friend and I stayed here for 2 days and absolutely loved it. Mark and his coworkers use the living space during the day as an office but are incredibly polite. We never felt awkward having them there in the morning before we headed out and in fact it was nice being able to ask a quick question or two! The room/bed was very comfortable and fit the two of us just fine (though we are 2 women under 5'5 so that might not work for larger male fellows). We especially enjoyed having a huge in room closet to store our bags. While the apartment wasn't very modern appliance wise it was very clean and the porcelain tub was a great way to warm up at night. This apartment is located right up the hill from downtown but also has lots of fun little shops/restaurants nearby. This was great for us as we didn't need to rent a car to get around. Overall, this was a super fun place to stay and we'll definitely be back. Thanks Mark!"
4679983,57073309,2015-12-21,36971005,Jason,"Mark was an excellent host. From the booking through checkout, he was extremely communicative and helpful. The apartment was cozy and a great deal for the location! I would definitely book with Mark again."
2526129,15099143,2014-07-02,15535498,Amanda,"Suzanne was an excellent host! My husband & I live in Seattle & rented the house for some out-of-town guests joining us for our wedding. The house is situated in a nice residential area on the edge of Capitol Hill & the Central District. It's just far enough away from the hubbub of Capitol Hill to provide relatively easy parking. It is just a block away from Chuck's Hop Shop (an amazing beer palace), Katy's Cafe (great local-owned coffee shop), & Central Cinema (an awesome movie theater/bar). The house was warm & inviting & the backyard was a lovely retreat. My guests had a wonderful stay & would highly recommend this charming home. "
2526129,36116982,2015-06-25,34361419,Fengnian,"Thank Suzanne and her family so much for providing us with such a wonderful experience. We felt literally at home at their place. The house is large enough for my family of 5. Definitely a great place to stay at Seattle! Location is also great, short driving distance to all attractions in Seattle!"
2526129,38393179,2015-07-15,27709974,Connor,This was a wonderful place in a fabulous location!  Plenty of room and a wonderful backyard.  Very convenient and Suzanne made the entire process seamless! 
604600,19397276,2014-09-11,7857869,Patricia,Correspondence was great.  Very efficient and effective host.  She worked on this reservation last minute for our company!  Our guest was very pleased with this accommodations!  Thanks Magalie!
475361,1589681,2012-06-29,1937432,Lilia,"Marilyn and Cynthia were very warm and welcoming hosts. The very first morning Cynthia was so kind to invite us for breakfast to a German bakery, just to make us feel home. Their house is nicely located, directly at a creek surrounded by beautiful trees - perfect for a good sleep after a relaxing jacuzzi bath. It was also a pleasure to see their art and the place where they are creating it. I warmly recommend that place!"
475361,1731269,2012-07-17,2521520,Thomas,"Marilyn and Cynthia were gracious, helpful hosts.  We enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning to Seattle and their welcoming home.  Spacious, comfortable, clean and inviting are words describing the accommodations provided and the ability to enter and leave using our own door without bothering the hosts was an unexpected bonus.  Lovely people and wonderful accommodations.  "
475361,1778136,2012-07-23,769463,Patty,"This proved to be an ideal choice for us, as we visited Seattle for the weekend.   The rooms available to us were so convenient and the property location was easy to find and access was great.  Our hosts were very accommodating and so interested in providing a comfortable stay for us.   We truly enjoyed our stay!"
475361,1935006,2012-08-09,3041036,Napaporn,"What's not to love? Great location, clean, spacious. Washer and dryer is a bonus! We rented a car and this place provided a perfect parking spot :) Marilyn and Cynthia were kind and warm."
475361,2183888,2012-09-03,2374658,Dean,"Marilyn and Cynthia are great hosts; they perfectly tread the fine line between going above and beyond to help their guests, to leaving them their privacy. They were both nice enough to go out of their way to drop us at a transit station so that we could head downtown. Their place is ideally located in a perfect setting, and is only 10-15 mins downtown by bus. We found Marilyn and Cynthia a pleasure to stay with and cannot recommend them as hosts, or their place enough."
475361,2401265,2012-09-24,3582601,Heidi,"Marilyn and Cynthia were great hosts. Their home was clean, comfortable and very well located to the University District.  They gave us great tips on places to eat and and had maps available in our living area to look things up.  Their home is located in the city but seemed like it was out in the country.  There was a creek running through their backyard and they had a nice sitting area outside just to sit and relax.  This was an awesome place to stay and I would recommend their home to anyone needing a place to stay in Seattle.  We truly enjoyed our stay!"
475361,2499041,2012-10-03,3630860,Vasili,"Hello there!  I am a snobby 33 year old from Wisconsin.  I stayed at Marilyn and Cynthia's Treehouse Suite for six days in October.  And let me be honest with you:
IT WAS FANTASTIC.

The Suite is huge.  There's a bedroom, a private sitting room, a kitchenette, a private bathroom, and LAUNDRY FACILITIES!   That was the best part for me.

The Suite is surrounded by lush greenery and trees, and I felt refreshed looking out the window every morning.

The bed is extremely comfy, by the way.

In addition, Cynthia and Marilyn are wonderful hosts.  They are warm, interesting, respectful, and original.  I look forward to staying with them again!"
475361,2882753,2012-11-13,4088409,Will,"Peaceful and quiet space, excellent location, very kind and gracious hosts. "
475361,2898652,2012-11-16,3839130,Ted,"Marilyn and Cynthia's place was bright, roomy, and airy, with windows on three sides, offering views of trees and (on one side) a small creek.  The hosts were personable and willing to help but also willing to give space to a guest with a clear itinerary of their own.   The neighbourhood is quiet and residential.  There's a Starbucks and a few restaurants nearby but you'll have to drive or take transit to reach the more diverse university or downtown spots.  This is a great location for people who have activities in north Seattle or the northern suburbs."
475361,4384576,2013-05-01,2185049,Oxana,"Marilyn and Cynthia are awesome hosts - friendly, welcoming and helpful. We had a nice stay in their specious basement with lots of windows and green views. A big bonus for us was a jacuzzi. There is also a laundry facility, a microwave and a sink. The place is family friendly, can be easily baby-proofed and the hosts also provided us with a crib.

The neighborhood is quiet and there are 2 excellent places for Asian food lovers - a Thai and Vietnamese.    

We would definitely stay there again.
"
475361,4538516,2013-05-11,4963704,Katja,"If you go to Seattle and want a really nice place to stay, we recommend Cynthia and Marilyn’s house in Lake City, Seattle. We had the whole basement of the house to ourselves, really lovely! We had our own bathroom, access to the washing machine and dryer and they made sure that we had everything we needed. We could always come to them when we had questions etc. In those cases they had to pass through the basement, they were very careful not to intrude on us or our personal space. We really appreciated it. These two interesting artists were warm and welcoming hosts, we really had a great time! They introduced us to the neighborhood and we really enjoyed their company! Thank you very much for the good talks and good luck for your projects and future endeavors!"
475361,4696364,2013-05-20,4928517,Andre,"Marylin and her partner are super friendly! They were giving me and my girlfriend such a nice time, that if we will come back visiting Seattle her place will be the one where we want to stay!

My impression:
clean: 5 from 5 stars
private: 4 from 5 (shared zone in the atelier, but they respect the privacy!)
location: 5 from 5 stars (super quiet and lovely)
bed: 5 from 5 (comfortably and big enough for two people)
bathroom: 5 from 5 (could be bigger but don't have to & very clean)
price: 5 from 5 (FAIR!)

And the best, they introduced us germans to the German backery close to their house. And we appreciate the taste of home!!"
475361,5002779,2013-06-06,6690636,Linda,"This was our first experience using AirBnB and it was great. The hosts were super friendly and the place was spotless. 4 minute walk to the express bus to downtown and food options nearby.
Marilyn and Cynthia have lived in the area a while so have plenty of info to share if required. The area is very green and leafy and a quite residential street. We loved it and would recommend staying here."
475361,5434122,2013-06-30,6387802,Ben,"It's a good thing airbnb put a 500 word limit on this review, or we would go on forever about how much we enjoyed our stay with Marilyn and Cynthia!!!  

Everything they advertise is accurate and in perfect working order: the jacuzzi tub, laundry facilities, kitchenette and internet we took advantage of the most. The pictures are actually deceiving, in that we had more private room than we anticipated. The sitting room is quite large and when the french doors are open to the bedroom, it is a very large and completely private space. As mentioned, Marilyn and Cynthia do make use of the central room in order to access their vehicles in the garage. They were always cautious and courteous upon 'passing through,' and made sure to knock and announce themselves. We never had an issue. We also never had a conflict with the space in the central room where painting is done and art is created - we communicated well about all of these things. Which brings me to my next compliment: Marilyn and Cynthia are great communicators! They are very knowledgeable about Lake City, and Seattle, in general. They provided us with bus, train, and ferry schedules upon our arrival - and Marilyn even created a personalized 'local map' while I was there for future guests, taking advantage of our input as well (great Thai food nearby at several locations!)
Their location is amazing, and we found everything we needed (grocery, restaurants, drugstores, pubs, post-office) in walking distance. We bought ORCA cards and rode the busses during our stay and it worked out perfectly - there are bus stops within 2 blocks of the house, and options to travel in all directions . . . the 522 express took us directly to downtons Seattle in only 21 mintes! 
Not only do you have a lot of privacy inside of the house, but the cul-de-sac makes you feel enveloped in nature - we awoke to the sound of birds and a view of nothing but trees most mornings!
Marily and Cynthia are wonderful souls - and true artists. I offered my strength and wingspan during our visit, and Marily took advantage: allowing me to help her retrieve her art from a local gallery . . . in the days that followed, it was wonderful to see the various faces on the paintings that I now recognized as familiar friends. 
We enjoyed ourselves so very much that we wanted to extend our stay in Seattle, which we were thrilled that Marilyn was willing to accommodate us for! 
If you are looking for a peaceful, comfortable (oh, the bed is amazing too, did I mention that?!) and magical little getaway spot away from the city, but near everything, then we recommend the NE Seattle Artist Treehouse Suite. 
Thanks for everything, Marilyn and Cynthia - we hope to do it again someday!
All the best,
Ben Blazer and Carin Bendas"
475361,5805106,2013-07-17,467369,Sheau,"Love Marilyn's place.  One of the best features is the view from the window.  We love waking up seeing the thick ""forest"" outside and imagine that we are indeed living in a treehouse.  The other feature I like very much is the easy access to the washer/dryer.  When you travel with two kids, laundry is very important and doing laundry in her place is just so comfortable!"
475361,6052762,2013-07-28,7196527,Lizi,"Beautiful home, spacious and well outfitted.  Didn't have to ask for anything as Marilyn gave us a great orientation of the place and all was easily accessible.  She and her partner were always available if any questions did arise however none did.  Wonderful location, so much in walking or short driving distance.  Marilyn made this weekend very comfortable and as relaxing as we wanted."
475361,6310277,2013-08-07,7635699,Anna,"Marilyn was warm and wonderful, greeting us at the door! The accommodations are lovely and conveniently located close to the bike path and many of the bus lines to take you downtown and up north. They have many resources available to help you explore and navigate the area. You can tell they are thoughtful and care about their guests.  "
475361,6369655,2013-08-10,7218077,Christopher,"I found Marilyn and Cynthia's home for my sister and niece to have a place to stay during a recent visit to Seattle (I happen to live in the same neighborhood). I did visit twice during their stay, and I can vouch for all other previous reviews: their home is quite pleasant; the accommodations are as advertised -- great if you don't need a kitchen; and as hosts Marilyn and Cynthia are warm and gracious."
475361,6466088,2013-08-13,7478786,Fred,"Marilyn and Cynthia were wonderful hosts. We arrived extremely late and, despite the hour, they welcomed us with open arms.   Their space was very clean and comfortable. I would highly recommend them to anyone. Thanks to Marilyn and Cynthia, our first experience with airbnb was incredibly pleasant. "
475361,6518760,2013-08-15,7737055,Lisa,"Marilyn and Cynthia were lovely, friendly and incredibly helpful to my friends and me during our stay.  Their home is clean, comfortable and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend staying with them for a quiet and relaxed stay!"
475361,6556913,2013-08-17,6394347,Jennifer,"Marilyn is a great, kind, and communicative host!  The space is very clean and well kept too.  My friend and I felt very comfortable staying there.  "
475361,6850522,2013-08-27,1346181,Alissa,Great experience! Marilyn & Cynthia were fabulous hosts. Clean and comfy accommodations too! 3 Thanks so much for our great stay!
475361,7017080,2013-09-03,6816128,Sigríður María,"Marilyn is the perfect hostess, friendly and respects your privacy. The Suite is exactly as described, comfortable and we were very happy with our stay. Everything was in line with or exceeded our expectations."
475361,7165611,2013-09-09,7680425,Liz,"Our only complaint about our stay at the Artist Treehouse B&B was that it was too short!  We spent four wonderful nights  surrounded by beautiful art, trees on three sides, and the sounds of a ""babbling brook"" outside our window. Our gracious hosts, Marilyn and Cynthia were extremely kind and thoughtful.  We loved Seattle and definitely hope to spend more time at the Treehouse Suite in the future.  I would highly recommend it to anyone visiting the area."
475361,7419570,2013-09-19,8399071,Jazz,Marilyn and Cynthia were great hosts!  They were very friendly and accessible.  Their house was clean and beautifully decorated.  It was a great deal for us! 
475361,7605588,2013-09-26,3441164,Ami,"This was a very lovely house, in a quiet neighborhood. My husband and I spent 6 days here, and we had a very nice relaxing stay.    We even brought in our digital piano (which we had brought on the big rental car across the country from NY), and got some good practice done.  The house is surrounded by trees, and we really did have the impression of being in a treehouse.  And everything was perfectly functional from internet, washing machine, to kitchen supplies (the shower was great!  really good water pressure and temperature regulation.  and they have jacuzzi in the bathtub).  The whole place was very clean and comfortable, with a sitting room and a comfortable bedroom, and an atelier (we put our keyboard there) with the kitchenette.
The hosts Marilyn and Cynthia were very kind and gracious (very good artists too).  They were very discreet and gave us full privacy, yet whenever we needed something, they were always available to help us (like the wine cork-screw!).  
Would love to come back again!
Thank you Marilyn and Cynthia!
"
475361,7966606,2013-10-10,4705042,Richard,"A wonderful shared experience with helpful, kind and very creative people.  Loved our stay."
475361,9059293,2013-12-03,2315832,Abbie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our Thanksgiving stay in the Artist Treehouse Suite. Marilyn and Cynthia could not have been kinder or more fun to talk with, and it's a joy to be in the presence of their artwork. Their guest suite is clean, private, comfortable and well-equipped, light and bright during the day and so nice for a good sleep at night. 

We loved having a sitting room, with the gas fireplace in the cast-iron stove to make the space even more cozy. Privacy and independence are important for us when we travel, so that we're not disturbing our hosts as we go about our day, and Marilyn and Cynthia give you that in spades.

You'll have everything you need here, and don't hesitate to ask for anything from your lovely hostesses if anything comes up. No worries about wiring or outlets if you're as gadget-dependent as we are, with everything convenient and easy. The kitchenette includes everything you'll need for microwave and water-kettle living, with all the dishes and silverware provided. There's even a hair dryer for you in the bathroom (and the shower has fantastic water pressure!). We didn't need to do laundry while we were there for our 4-night stay, but it's definitely a big plus to have convenient access to the washer & dryer for longer visits.

The house is in a cul de sac off of the street, wooded and private but still close to everything. So pleasant! The neighborhood has a wealth of shopping and restaurants, and the Burke Gilman Trail is close by for more walking and cycling. Don't miss the Kaffee Klatsch bakery (delicious breakfast biscuits! incredible pastries! great coffee! warm and lovely staff!). The Breakfast Club diner has a lot of character. It's easy to get around by car from Lake City, but bus service is extremely convenient, too. We'll definitely look first for Marilyn and Cynthia's Treehouse Suite the next time we're visiting family in Seattle!"
475361,9190236,2013-12-12,9234224,Michele,"Marilyn and Cynthia are wonderful hosts! They made our stay special with such little touches as providing coffee, a selection of teas and cream to get us started in the mornings, and turning on the lovely gas stove in our private sitting room every evening so we would come back to a warm, cozy space. The sitting area looks onto a little ravine, with green trees all around and very private and the bed was absolutely heavenly!
The house was easy to find and is quiet and restful, even though it is only about three blocks from a main thoroughfare, which has all the basic amenities and good bus service to the nearest mall and downtown.
We enjoyed a couple of visits upstairs with Marilyn and Cynthia. They have great stories to tell about their travels and about life and it was a pleasure to spend time with them. We know our way around town pretty well, but I'm sure they would be excellent resources for first-time visitors, so don't hesitate. I will definitely be staying with them again the next time I'm in Seattle! "
475361,9278369,2013-12-17,2315832,Abbie,"We got to stay with Marilyn and Cynthia again a couple weeks after our first visit, when I had a job interview (didn't get it, booooo). Once again the Artist Treehouse Suite was everything we needed, and Cynthia and Marilyn the kindest of hosts. Also got to enjoy the ease of driving from Lake City to the legendary Maltby Cafe for brunch with a friend (just hop on Lake City Way northbound, and in 20 minutes you're there!). 

Marilyn and Cynthia are the most gracious of hosts, even when they're not having the best days themselves (they had a minor plumbing crisis and a bad health day the day we arrived). Once again, we *love* having the sitting room and the bright airy space when we stay with them. And the art! What a wonderful place.

Happy New Year, Marilyn and Cynthia, filled with every joy and prosperity (and good plumbing!)!"
475361,11040411,2014-03-17,12237905,Carol,"Marilyn has a delightful place to stay, especially if you love art! She and Cynthia are wonderful hosts. It is a bit of a shared space but they are very respectful about coming through the basement from the garage and stay out of your way. 

Marilyn even took the time to show my artsy daughter some of her artworks, which was a wonderful treat for her! 

The basement is cozy and has a microwave, toaster and mini-fridge. Jacuzzi tub is also great! It's a quiet cul de sac with nice leafy views out the sitting room and a comfy bed. It's an easy stroll down to the lakefront if you want to take in some views, too, and an easy drive to shopping and dining.

If you prefer having a completely private airbnb place to stay this won't be for you, but if you can share a little and enjoy having hosts, Marilyn is the best!"
475361,11557624,2014-04-07,11666475,Celine,"My husband, 2 boys and I had a very comfortable stay with Marilyn and Cynthia. We particularly enjoyed the bright and clean space, the Franklin stove and the little creek above which the house sits. One night we even met a family of raccoons on our way ""home"". That was fun! Our hostesses were very friendly and helpful. And we got to see Marilyn's artwork!... We're grateful for their kind hospitality. "
475361,11923840,2014-04-19,11636305,Michael,"We are so happy to have found this fine airbnb within walking distance of our son's home in the northeast corner of Seattle.  Also very accessible to excellent public transportation to University of Washington and downtown. The Treehouse Suite provided a perfect respite for naps and restful nights after busy days.  The bed  was excellent; the jacuzzi  tub was a lovely bonus.  Everything was very clean and we had everything we needed.  We especially enjoyed relaxing in the ""treehouse"" sitting room with it's gas fireplace and the sound of a babbling creek outside. The eating area is well equipped with a microwave, electric kettle and refrigerator.  As coffee drinkers, next time we will take our own drip cone and filters to make real coffee for ourselves.  Other than that we lacked for nothing.  To top it off, the hosts are inspiring as well as gracious.  We look forward to future visits with them at this convenient, comfortable, delightful airbnb! "
475361,13250357,2014-05-23,14903970,Josephine,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle.   The ""tree house"" was very clean and quiet and comfortable!  Charming retreat with a friendly host!  We loved it! "
475361,13519686,2014-05-29,11636305,Michael,This was our second visit to Marilyn's Tree House Suite.  We are so glad to have found this place to enjoy our frequent Seattle visits.  It is perfect for us and we feel very welcome and well taken care of there.
475361,14028815,2014-06-10,8438991,Hanna,"I had such a lovely time at Marilyn's! She and Cynthia were great hosts. I generally like meeting new people when I travel, so this situation was ideal. Marilyn and Cynthia took the time to show me their art, which I was really curious about, and were really great, involved hosts. I would also like to mention that the bathroom was so clean, which was delightful. Thank you for having us 3"
475361,14194691,2014-06-14,13791723,Richard,"My stay at Marilyn's place was great--you have the entire downstairs to yourself, bedroom, bathroom, large living space and it's very quiet.  You can walk the neighborhood and enjoy all of the unique craftsman homes or you can walk or drive to the restaurants on Lakeview Blvd.  Marilyn is a working artist and her work adorns the walls of the house--I was given a tour of the rest of the house and enjoyed my conversations about her work.  I would stay there again."
475361,14531584,2014-06-21,1311999,Eric,"Marilyn was a thoughtful, generous, and helpful host. The downstairs area is clean, fun, and Marilyn takes great steps to make it as private as possible. We enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and some of the local food spots, it made staying in Seattle easy and relaxing."
475361,15049171,2014-07-01,15695820,Steve,"Marilyn is very warm and considerate hostess. Her house is very comfortable.  Even though it is only about 100 yards from a major street, it is very quiet at night. We  like the sitting room in the lower level that looks out to a wooded area. The furniture are simple and adequate. Marilyn even shared her arts with us. She is a very creative and passionate artist. We enjoyed staying at her house. "
475361,15395981,2014-07-08,6109467,Thomas,"1st time using AirBnB and based on our experience with the ""Artist Treehouse Suite"", we will certainly use them again. Very comfy and plenty of room for two.
It was like staying with your family only more private/separate accommodations.
The general location was great: Walk to the end of the drive and turn right for convenient shopping or turn left and head for Lake Washington to walk the Burke-Gillman Trail less than one mile away.  The house sits on  private driveway with 3 other homes, surrounded by trees,  but once inside your suite you truly feel secluded.    Marilyn & Cynthia  are gracious.  They are willing to socialize and share there gifted artistic talents and works, and just as willing to be invisible and give you space.   We would  definitely stay there again."
475361,17840350,2014-08-18,17403612,André,"Thanks a lot to Marilyn,the best host ever. The Tree House is a dream but Marilyn with her warm and open minded way is unbeatable "
475361,18182730,2014-08-23,294226,Leslie + Janel,"Our stay in Marilyn and Cynthia's home was great. The space was cozy, well equipped, had a comfortable bed, and lovely green surroundings. We were happy to take the tour of the house to see the various art projects created by our hosts through the years. Marilyn was very attentive and prepared to answer any questions we had. The location was convenient and the home served as a great landing pad while we visited Seattle for a day long event. Thanks to Marilyn and Cynthia for opening their home to us!"
475361,18486469,2014-08-27,19051777,Yelena,They are wonderful. Very caring and helpful
475361,19137007,2014-09-07,18974424,Ruo Peng,"Marilyn's tree house is very clean, and if you would like to  have a decent sleep, this place is super quiet at night. Great location, near downtown. I will stay her place again if I come back to Seattle in the future. "
475361,19388198,2014-09-11,7099532,Jk,"Marilyn is very kind and helpful. The place is nice and quiet, not feel living in   
 city at all. Rooms are clean and spacious. Living with original art works around you is a plus that you wouldn't have in a hotel. Also good advices about attractions and transportation made our trip more enjoyable. We are very happy with our stay here. "
475361,19612237,2014-09-15,19707796,Chrystal,"Marilyn did make us feel very welcome, and the neighborhood was a short distance to kiddo friendly locations and to a class my partner was attending during our stay. I was slightly surprised that the ""jacuzzi"" is a jacuzzi bathtub- but the room was cozy. No big frills or thrills- but a good find for a good price. "
475361,20596510,2014-10-02,15303272,Hege,"I felt that I got a very warm welcome. I immediately felt at home. All through my week long stay I felt well taken care of and got all the privacy that any person would need. 
The unit I rented was perfect for me, very clean and spacious. To have my private bathroom, livingarea as well as bedroom felt just perfect. The kitchenarea had all the necessary utilities for me. 
The location was also perfect, close to shops and some restauranter, as well as the busstop.  The area is a quiet one with little traffic."
475361,22566103,2014-11-09,23314387,Marc,"My host waited up for me until nearly midnight and then was very gracious and friendly and welcoming, even though it was way past her accustomed bedtime. The room itself--and especially the bed--was cozy and comforting and I slept like a baby. In the morning I opened the curtain by the window next to the bed and sat up in bed and wrote for a little while; it was delightful. Everything was clean and sweet. I have no complaints. It was also a cheerful little space. And quiet."
475361,26553541,2015-02-15,25513923,艾灵,"I like Marilyn very much for she is so nice! She is so careful that she prepares everything in her room. Her house is so clean and warm, so big for children playing and drawing. Machines works good in the room and the room is so quite with many trees around. Marilyn got a bad cold, so we regretted haven't spoken so much to Marilyn. Thank you! For my English is not very good,I hope I have already expressed my meaning and thankful to Mariyln!"
475361,26748305,2015-02-18,26608071,Richard,The hosts are friendly and accommodating. The neighborhood is quiet both day and night. The lodging is very suitable for a guy or gal who needs a comfortable place to sleep and who intends to eat out for meals. Everything was clean and (website hidden) and wifi as advertised.  
475361,27308558,2015-03-01,221145,Rafael,"Marilyn and Cynthia were charming hosts, and our living quarters were light, clean, quiet, and very comfortable.  I really liked the forested setting with the little brook running below our window.  We found the space very conveniently laid out and stocked, and they were very responsive to anything we needed.  We were very sorry to leave and would definitely come back!  We would absolutely recommend this place!!"
475361,28854091,2015-03-30,30022563,Greg,Marilyn was a wonderful host and we really enjoyed seeing so much of her art.  The accommodations were just as described - very comfortable and convenient.  She offered first rate hospitality from a lovely lady who provided everything we needed and more.
475361,29370045,2015-04-06,30492541,Steven,We had a wonderful visit and thoroughly enjoyed Marilyn's hospitality.  The accomodations were great and the location was wonderful.  Marilyn made sure we had information on the area which is appreciated.  
475361,29792433,2015-04-12,23486672,Sarah,"We were greeted upon arrival at Marilyn's house and shown our space for the weekend.  She was a wonderful host.  We were given just the perfect amount of information about the neighborhood and places to go.  We tried a coffee place that was recommended by her.  It was a nice walk in the morning through the neighborhood.  The space is very clean,quiet and perfect for our trip.  Even the cot was comfortable to sleep on!  Access and location was ideal for our stay.  "
475361,30473456,2015-04-22,484580,Laura," The apartment was even better than we had imagined from the listing.  Marilyn greeted us warmly when we arrived late at night and brought us muffins for breakfast.
 It is quite a spacious set up with everything one would need: refrigerator, plates, silverware, kitchen sink, coffee-maker, microwave, washer/dryer etc.  Everything  is clean and new.  There was plenty of room for our son to lounge in the sitting room and watch tv or read.  The apartment is sunny and beautifully decorated with Marilyn and Cynthia's colorful art.  It was a great place to wake up to seeing the tops of the trees out the windows.
We had privacy even though the hosts were upstairs.   By our own choosing, we had some lovely chats about art and love and life with both our hosts. The location worked well and was easily accessible to wherever we wanted to go.  We were glad we did not stay downtown.
Their house is in a cul de sac with two other houses and feels very safe and is beautifully landscaped with flowering trees and shrubs.  We would definitely stay there again since it was very convenient, warm and welcoming."
475361,30694349,2015-04-26,28936684,Edward,"We enjoyed our stay, the rooms were as advertised, very clean and comfortable. Marilyn's house is in an excellent location as many stores and restaurants are within a 5 minute drive. Our host was very friendly and informative. I will likely stay here again when we visit our daughter and family."
475361,32598370,2015-05-19,4442834,Kirsten,"Where do I start?! Marilyn has to be one of my all time favorite hosts. She had everything so well planned and set up for our arrival including delicious muffins! We were able to see some of the amazing artwork that her and Cynthia have painted, it was like walking through an art gallery. Her Oracle Project was incredible beyond words, ask to see it while you are there! My husband left his water bottle in the mini fridge downstairs and we didn't realize it until we had already checked out and locked the door behind us. We woke up Marilyn to get back in quite early in the morning and she was a doll to get up and accommodate us. We had an excellent time at this airbnb and we will definitely be returning in the future!"
475361,33710371,2015-05-31,33080676,Mary,"It was as advertised. Lovely home in a beautiful area. Everything was close by even an LA fitness to which we have a membership to. She had Dr. Pepper for us in the mini fridge, which I thought was a lovely gesture. I had posted on my profile that we love Dr. P. So it was great of her to have some upon arrival. We weren't there for very long, so we were never there only to sleep. I wish we had more time to see all her art. But it was a wonderful experience. I loved it! Thanks!"
475361,34453136,2015-06-08,1303838,M,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at Marilyn's tree house suite very much.  This beautiful, extremely clean and comfortable home is conveniently located from Seattle downtown. Marilyn is a very kind and loving host. We even got a preview of Marilyn's  Oracle art project, which is very impressive.  We would definitely stay here again during our next trip to Seattle."
475361,35090122,2015-06-15,31642499,Magdalene,"The host was so charming and wonderful.  Made sure we were settled in, kept us up to date on things happening around the town...provided great advice.  
She kept a clean and cozy house for the three of us.  She cares about the Earth and asked us to be respectful of it.  I LOVED that, it is so good to see people really dedicate themselves to making this planet better.  
Great location, easy access to everywhere. Oh and she is a fabulous artist who shared some of her recent work with us!!!!  Thank you!!!
"
475361,35405785,2015-06-18,22399164,Wesley,It was a decent location quite near to the I5.
475361,35796553,2015-06-22,32016630,Leeds,"We enjoyed our stay immensely. Marilyn was most helpful in getting us oriented to her space, the local environment, and the Seattle experience. She explained the details of our accommodations and made us feel most welcome, even brought us a few goodies. The habitat and general feeling of the space was delightful."
475361,36266787,2015-06-27,29660138,Dianne,"Marilyn and Cynthia greeted us upon arrival and made us feel welcome immediately by giving us a tour of our area, instructions as to how everything worked, made a map of the area available to us with highlights of recommended eating establishments.  
Neighborhood was busy but the house was nestled amidst a wonderful wooded area and since we were downstairs we were relatively cool even when the outside temp was 92!"
475361,36593277,2015-06-29,16500198,Emily,"Marilyn was welcoming and the space was wonderful!  We had a very relaxing stay and found the location extremely convenient as it was a only a quick drive to downtown Seattle.  The downstairs space was clean, roomy, and very comfortable.  "
475361,37050356,2015-07-04,19758373,Liz,Our hosts were very welcoming and very helpful upon our arrival.  The apartment was just as described and very comfortable for our family of four.
475361,38449522,2015-07-15,2039570,Stuart,"I had a peaceful restful stay at the Tree House. Marilyn and Cynthia are very kind and considerate hosts. The accommodation was warm and homey, just what I needed after a long day of work. I really felt like I was at a special place given Marilyn's paintings all around and her Oracle project.  I wish I had a little more time to have spent talking with my hosts; they are exceptional people and I would be happy to return."
475361,38987295,2015-07-20,26487222,Ellen,"We had a great time at the treehouse. The house is very comfortable, well decorated and spaceous. Our hosts were very warm and helpful. Thanks Marilyn and Cynthia."
475361,39562864,2015-07-24,38394625,Matt,Marilyn was a fantastic host and an absolute pleasure. We had plenty of privacy while still feeling very welcome in her home. She was very sweet and very helpful and we would definitely recommend her. 
475361,39938320,2015-07-27,34533194,Fred,"
We were met by Marilyn and she made us welcome and settled us down in our unit. Everything was great.  The neighborhood was interesting and there were many restaurants nearby. This was our first experience in a large city neighborhood  and was the reason we decided to stay here.  All in all, a very pleasant experience."
475361,40401895,2015-07-30,39545591,Eric,"Marilyn is an absolute sweetheart. She gave good advice, was very helpful, and replied to all my messages quickly. This was my first airbnb experience and after this experience with Marilyn, I would definitely do airbnb again (and stay at her place as well if I go to Seattle again). It's a great location to stay, a quiet & safe neighborhood. And definitely a place to call home for a few days ☺️."
475361,40881413,2015-08-03,24996220,Kirsten,"Marilyn and Cynthia gave us a warm welcome when we arrived in Seattle. Everything was exactly as described and they even supported our 'special needs' for wheat-free bread. Their house is very comfy and quiet and filled with neat art pieces - produced by themselves. 
Definetely recommended for future stays...
Bests, Romy&Kirsten"
475361,41602048,2015-08-08,1912299,Rose,Marilyn and Cynthia were so sweet and helpful. The Artists studio was very cozy and charming. Very close to the lake and you can jump on the Express Bus and be downtown in 25 minutes. We had a lovely time.
475361,42401833,2015-08-13,35917825,Robert,"Host was very solicitous about our welfare and did her best to appraise us of a possible plumbing problem which got resolved without us being inconvenienced.

Can't say it was a neighborhood in the usual sense, but it was well-located for our purposes. The apartment itself was rather unconventionally arranged, but the bed was comfortable and the seating area also. People who expect to cook a great deal might be disappointed, but we didn't and weren't."
475361,43041233,2015-08-17,15007173,Mary,"Wonderful! Marilyn and Cynthia were gracious and accommodating.  They have a gentle warmth- like we've know each other for years. They shared  the stories of their beautiful art work with us and even offered inspiring tips to our aspiring artist daughter :) we had a lovely time! They offered suggestions for navigating the town and graciously pointed out Seattle highlights on the various maps.  The duck ride:) 
(We will continue to have duck days as a family and a couple as inspired by you and our time with you! ) thank you!
Mary and family "
475361,43799965,2015-08-22,33817927,Raye,"We had an excellent stay with Marilyn and Cynthia! We spent a lot of time sightseeing and it was nice to come back to the house and area in the evenings. The house is in a great location. You're not too far from downtown but it's nice at the end of the day to get away somewhere quieter. There are also some great restaurants in the area (make sure you take a look at the food map Marilyn made). The place was also clean, comfortable, and you got the added bonus of being surrounded by art. We would definitely come back :)"
475361,45931820,2015-09-07,13349436,Kelly,"Marilyn and Cynthia were outstanding hosts.  They made my friend and me feel so comfortable from the moment we arrived.  She showed us around the space and made sure to point out all of the important notes about staying there.  We were able to come and go as we pleased, exploring Seattle and the surrounding area by day, and resting at the suite in the evening.  This location is not directly downtown, but it is pretty close to the 5, and there are buses nearby.  We had a vehicle and were able to get to almost everywhere we wanted to see in the city within 10-15 minutes.  The suite is ""downstairs"" - I wouldn't even really call it a basement - but it is still quiet and has a lot of windows/pretty natural light (but without waking you up first thing in the morning!).  The shower was so amazing, it had outstanding water pressure.  I was able to utilize the efficient washer and dryer as well.  There are tons of Seattle and San Juan Island maps, as well as a large road map with focus on the area in which they live.  On that part, they've marked local establishments so you can pinpoint their locations easily.  I cannot thank them enough for a wonderful stay.  "
475361,47775189,2015-09-21,42350378,Rainer,It was a perfect stay with Marilyn. Everything as described and Marilyn was a very helpful and nice host. Really nice area as well and parking in front of the house. And I am looking forward to funding your art project on Kickstarter. 
475361,49044978,2015-09-30,43976132,Adriana,"Marilyn was great! She was very easy to talk to and a great host! The house was very homey, and my parents (who were the guests) made the comment that it makes you feel like your just spending the night at a good friend's. Better than any hotel they would have stayed at. The house was a perfect central location for those who are wanting to experience the downtown area and Seattle's great neighborhoods. "
475361,50705486,2015-10-13,20657639,Scott,Our host was very welcoming and accommodating.  Our visit was related to relocating in the area and not so much a vacation getaway so we didn't spend much time exploring the neighborhood but Lake City appeared very nice and convenient to getting around the area.   
475361,52759094,2015-11-01,46873117,Linda,"Lovely, quiet neighborhood and the accomodations were perfect.  A place to sleep with a comfortable bed and a really nice sitting area off it with a tv.  She says there's no kitchen but there is a fridge, a kitchen sink, and a microwave and a table to eat at. She has supplied dishes, cups, glasses and just about everything you could need. Highly recommend this location for people looking for comfortable accomodations in an area with no hotels really.  Marilyn was spectacularly friendly and helped us out quite a bit."
1450262,6409184,2013-08-11,535774,Peer,"This is the nicest home I've ever stayed in through AirBNB- our host was organized, clean, polite and respectful. Me and my friends absolutely loved it and we all were talking about how we'd stay there again in a minute if we were ever in Seattle again and if out host would allow us back.
Cheers"
1450262,7073148,2013-09-05,8058427,Kate,"After a long trip from New Zealand with 3 small children, we arrived in the dark to Sarah and Ron's brilliant home in Seattle. We all flopped into bed after a 13 hour flight and a 5 hour drive down from Vancouver, and then wow what a lovely surprise we got in the morning. A stunning home, comfy beds, a lovely bath, a fully equipped kitchen with EVERYTHING you might need to whip up a magnificent feast and a safe and secure garden for the children (even the neighbours were lovely). Laurelhurst is a fabulous area, there is a park just around the corner and the most amazing mall 10mins walk away.
Sarah answered every query we had quickly and provided us with all the info we might need and more. We are only sorry we couldn't stay longer!"
1450262,7488374,2013-09-22,8380992,Sera,"We loved Sarah's place during our stay and the neighbors are great as well.  The house is clean, beautifully decorated, and very quiet.  It was so clean that we could walk around the house in our socks and indoor-slippers my parents-in-law brought and left our shoes at the entrance just like we do in our homes.  Our toddler lying around and playing on the floor didn't scare us a bit at Sarah's place.  Sarah also provided us with a Sleep-N-Play, so our toddler could sleep safe and sound, and the shades completely blocked the morning sun, so each day, our toddler woke up 30 minutes later than the previous day and helped us to adjust to the time zone.  The neighbors we ran into were very friendly, and most of them talked to our toddler and let her pet their dogs.  We enjoyed the nice restaurants and shops nearby on 45th street, and the catholic church is only a block away, so we just walked over for Sunday service.  The parking was also great; we had an option to park inside of the garage, but parking in front of the garage worked for us.  We'd like to stay at Sarah's place again when we visit Seattle if the house is available."
1450262,7859578,2013-10-06,7570404,Ken,We had a great experience using this home for our study!
1450262,10217965,2014-02-07,11019337,Hugh,"My wife and I had a great time at Ron & Sarah's place.  Their home is very spacious, clean, comfortable and well-equipped — so much better than a hotel for relaxing.  We were in Seattle celebrating our 20th anniversary, and the house was absolutely perfect.

I should mention that this was my first time using Airbnb, so I was a little skeptical about how everything would pan out.  From reading the reviews to the detailed information that Ron and Sarah provided, all of my concerns were quickly put at ease.  From the beautiful decor, spacious rooms, two-story layout, technology resources (DVD, cable, TV, Internet) this is an EXCELLENT place to stay while in Seattle.
 
If you like well appointed rooms, spacious accommodations, and being just minutes away from the hustle bustle of downtown Seattle . . . Staying in this beautiful home would be a great choice!"
1450262,13689220,2014-06-02,15159751,Jessica,"Great clean, modern and beautiful home in a quiet, family friendly neighborhood. We stayed for 10 days with our 2 young children (ages 2 and 4) and they enjoyed the backyard and nearby parks. What a wonderful way to feel at home while on holiday visiting Seattle. Hosts were also prompt to respond and flexible with our needs. We would most definitely stay again- highly recommend.
"
1450262,15996762,2014-07-20,11106271,Eric,"Sarah was a great host. The house is beautiful, was clean, and was fully stocked with everything we could possibly need for our stay. We loved the Laurelhurst neighborhood, and found it very easy to get to the other parts of Seattle with our car."
1450262,16975608,2014-08-05,14487583,Changgen,"My family stayed Seattle for a 15 days holiday, Sarah's house is perfict, better than my expection."
1450262,17274493,2014-08-10,16067775,Lisa,"This house was perfect for our needs. It is lovely and in a wonderful quiet neighborhood. We were an easy drive away from downtown but did not have to be in the constant crowds.  There are tons of restaurants within 10 minutes of the house.  The house is very nicely designed and furnished. Everything is classy as well as comfortable. The kitchen is amazing.  The master bedroom is quite large with a beautiful bathroom.  The second bedroom is smaller but very nice. 

Sarah was a very attentive host and made sure we had everything we needed. When we come back to Seattle, I will definitely try to rent this house again. I highly recommend it.  "
1450262,17816040,2014-08-18,13057649,Nancy,"This house was perfect for our needs during our stay in Seattle.  The neighborhood is so quiet we hardly knew there were neighbors around us.  We took daily walks with our infant grandson and found a beautifully maintained park and playground nearby.
The house has plenty of space to spread out and yet cozy enough to spend family time together.  We found everything we needed to provide home cooked meals in the well equipped kitchen.  
The hardwood floors are beautifully maintained and we followed the advise of another reviewer and took our shoes off at the door (just like home).  
I would highly recommend this beautifully decorated and comfortable house to anyone looking for a home to stay in while visiting Seattle.  
Sarah and Ron are quite accommodating hosts.  They responded immediately to any questions I posed.  We felt quite at home in their lovely house."
1450262,18805586,2014-09-01,17289249,Elizabeth,"We had an absolutely perfect time in Seattle. The house is EXACTLY as described... Spacious, gorgeous, full of the finest amenities! Location was great and getting to and from Seattle was a breeze with our rental car which was easily and safely parked in the driveway or garage at night. Sarah was extremely quick at responding to any messages sent. I would HIGHLY recommend this for anyone needing a place to stay in Seattle!"
1450262,19282124,2014-09-09,16823213,Michael,Everything was exactly what it was listed as. It was a very nice and clean experience.
1450262,19636521,2014-09-15,4390156,Yasmeen,"The house was exactly as we expected and as advertised online. It was beautifully finished and decorated, and was a very comfortable place to stay. We were in Seattle on business, and the location and house were a great fit!"
1450262,21257146,2014-10-13,22176826,Lelani,"Sarah was a very accommodating host. The house is beautiful, especially the kitchen. It's clean and exactly as pictured. It is in a very nice, quiet location. "

Thank you Sarah and Ron!!"
1450262,33407357,2015-05-27,29341657,曉元,This house is so beautiful and in a quiet nice location. Sara is reponsible and very easy to communicate. I enjoyed this trip so much.
1450262,33774885,2015-06-01,6221054,Gavriel,Great house in a beautiful quiet neighborhood. Very easy rental process. Very responsive hosts. The house has plenty of common space with a nice open feel. The kitchen is modern with a great layout. The backyard is well maintained with a very private feel. The master bedroom is huge with a lot of natural light. The master bath is great with a big shower and really big bathtub. Very clean and well maintained.
1450262,34622862,2015-06-10,482402,Lin,Amazing house. Felt like we were staying in a presidential suite! Everything was way beyond our expectations. Would strongly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay at Sarah and Ron's place!
1450262,37939534,2015-07-12,11106271,Eric,"My family and I stayed at Sarah's house twice, and we will definitely try to do so again. Not only is the house spacious, clean, and modern, but Sarah keeps it stocked with everything you might need during your stay. The neighborhood is quiet, and is just a short drive from busier areas such as the U District and Wallingford. I highly recommend this house."
1450262,41927093,2015-08-10,30781799,Gabriel,"Sarah made me and my friends feel very welcome at her house and was always available to answer questions. The house was stocked with tools for all forms of cooking we could think of and it was extremely comfortable with plenty of room for myself and 3 other people to live comfortably for a week while on vacation. The house is beautifully furnished in a way that always made me feel welcome after a long day of exploring. If I return to Seattle on a future vacation, I would definitely check to see if this house is available first."
1450262,43242159,2015-08-18,36039177,Aaron,"Our time at the executive retreat was a pleasure.  The house is immaculate and had everything we needed or wanted.  It was exactly like the description/pictures on the profile.  The hosts were very accommodating, especially given our AirBNB rookie status.  The neighborhood was very quiet.  I can't say enough good things about this experience.  Thank you."
1450262,45466761,2015-09-03,35103366,Dawn,The Executive Retreat was exactly as listed.  The home was exceptionally clean and very comfortable.  This was our first experience with Airbnb and we must say that the home met and exceeded all of our expectations.  Sarah was very responsive to all of our inquiries. 
1450262,46172210,2015-09-08,10684800,Mingming,Sarah is super nice and her place is awesome. Really enjoy this trip!!! I would stay here for sure if I travel to Seattle next time.
1450262,48894132,2015-09-29,26027491,Daniel,The house was amazing! It was better than the photos show. I would definitely come back to this location again. Having/renting a car is highly recommended as uber drivers don't frequent the area.
1450262,55252385,2015-11-29,43540736,Kathy,"Sarah and Ron were very good hosts! We (husband, two grown sons) stayed there over Thanksgiving and loved their home. It is sunny, updated, comfortable and perfect. The kitchen was well-stocked and great tv for watching football and movies. Master and bathroom are beautiful and big. Nice guest room. Comfortable beds (and I'm picky!) The neighborhood is very quiet and residential...but near UW district where there is a lot of shopping/restaurants. Great walking neighborhood. Easy to get downtown. Felt like home! Thanks for the bottle of wine - and hoping that was for us since it was on the counter! I hope to stay here again on our next visit to Seattle - thanks for everything!"
3858725,18514256,2014-08-27,450271,Jesse,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3858725,28836050,2015-03-30,29343553,Jessica,"Sara is an excellent host, and her apartment is a great place to stay while in Seattle.  She was easy to communicate with and flexible with check-in and check-out times.  Her apartment was very clean and in an excellent location.  I loved how it was easy to walk downtown as well as to all the bars / restaurants in Capitol Hill.  And the view is so pretty!  This was my first AirBnB experience, and thanks to Sara it went perfectly :)"
3858725,29645962,2015-04-10,5277439,Jonathan,"Sara was an amazing host. She was very accommodating with the arrival and departure time, her place was very clean and had amazing amenities! Very centrally located, with parking as well. Could not have asked for a better experience. I would definitely recommend to a friend and stay again."
3858725,32987578,2015-05-24,16129528,Michael,"Sara was fantastically welcoming. She was incredibly fast to respond, both by email and text. She met us at the apartment and made sure we were comfortable with everything. We also met her landlord and had his contact information as well. She also showed us how to use her apartment's security system. We didn't, and there was no need to, but that's very nice if you are nervous. 

Her place was fastidiously clean, with all the amenities we needed. Very comfortable bed. There was a great fan for white noise and to keep us cool on the couple days the high was near 80. The fan blowing in front of an open window cooled the bedroom down quickly. We ran low on hot water in the morning (around 7 AM), likely as lots of people were up and showering. At other times in the day, there was plenty. The kitchen was well-stocked with all the dishes and silverware we needed. 

Sara's apartment is located right by an interstate highway, and you can hear distant traffic noise. The neighborhood itself is very quiet. We heard no sirens or car honking. The view from her windows cannot be beat; not even her pictures do it justice. 

You can walk everywhere you'd want to go right from Sara's place. We walked all over Capital Hill (obviously), Downtown, Lower Queen Anne, South Lake Union, Eastlake, Westlake, and the International District. Her apartment is in the perfect location for tourists. And if not wanting to walk, Uber will take you anywhere in a few minutes, or you can catch a bus or light rail. 

If returning to Seattle, we would try to stay at Sara's place again. It's a great place with an even better host!"
3858725,33976312,2015-06-02,3782909,Dexter,The host canceled this reservation 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3858725,35674173,2015-06-21,32990209,Katie,"Our time at Sara's apartment was absolutely amazing! The apartment is about 10-15 walking distance to anywhere in Capitol Hill which is basically the best neighborhood to be in. Tons of restaurants and awesome shops. 

The apartment itself had amazing views and was super comfortable and safe. The balcony has a hammock and you can leave the sliding door open for an amazing breeze. The bed was more comfortable than mine at home and all the furnishings were very tasteful. This was my first air b&b experience but definitely not my last. 

The only slightly negative thing was only having one set of towels and no wash cloths but that was easily fixed by walking to the nearest grocery store and grabbing some. 

Lovely place, lovely host even though we never met her face to face she was very helpful and checked in with us to make sure we were fine. :)

If we are ever in Seattle again we would 100% stay here again.

"
3858725,37177862,2015-07-05,31690876,Carolina,"Sara is such a kind and honest hostess. She waited for me at her place, showed me her super chic home and gave me a detailed description of the logistics of the place. She also gave me excellent ideas on what to do in the coming days. During my stay, she checked in with me and pretty much made me feel at home. This is the loveliest place I have ever been in during my Airbnb experiences. I would definitely love the chance to stay there again. Spotless and beautiful place. "

3858725,39911819,2015-07-27,11346406,Greg,Great neighborhood. A little loud by the highway but nothing I couldn't sleep through. Sara was very accommodating to my schedule and made sure I could check in and check out when it was convenient for me.

The place is as described on the listing. Location is pretty good, walking distance to the broadway which has good eating places. Through the balcony you get a good view of the Seattle night sky.

4693488,25795041,2015-01-26,24411652,Jeff,"Chris and his family are extremely nice, and he did his best to make sure the apartment had everything we needed and that we enjoyed our month long visit. We were the first to stay here, so there were some kitchen items that I think he just forgot to stock. We let him know and in a couple of hours he was there with the things we needed! He had clearly put some effort into making sure things were ready for us, providing several pages of info about the nearby businesses, as well as a welcome basket of drinks and snacks! 

The place was clean, and looked just like advertised. As the description mentions, tall people (like me!) will have to be careful and duck in a few places. 

The neighborhood is great. It's a quiet residential area, with plentiful street parking, but one block up the road is Greenwood Ave with lots of shops and restaurants. If  you want to head towards Fremont or Downtown, you can walk to both the 5 bus (closest) and E bus a little farther. 

All in all it was a great place to stay and beats the heck out of a hotel! Thanks Chris! "
4693488,26706912,2015-02-17,27133127,Jason,"Chris was an awesome host, and made us feel right at home. The place was cozy, clean, and in close proximity to some great restaurants and cafes (plus easy access to other districts). Parking was easy to find, too. Definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a quiet place to relax!"
4693488,27017489,2015-02-23,27534905,Katie,"We had a great experience in the house! The house was a basement area transformed into a house, but it was very cozy. The accommodations were warm, and he left us a nice basket of goodies to snack on. He also provided a list of cool restaurants, and shops to go to in the area. We had a wonderful trip, and the only thing I would mention is that this accommodation would not be suited for people over 6 feet tall. Either than that, it was perfect! Go pirates!"
4693488,27378011,2015-03-02,23506696,Beth,"Chris greeted us upon arrival with a great sense of humor and excellent hospitality.  His detached apt was nicely decorated and comfy! Located in the Greenlake area of Seattle, Chris's unit was ideal for a great outdoorsy weekend. We recommend it to anyone who wants to see the serene beauty of Seattle."
4693488,28055221,2015-03-16,6988525,Lindsay,"I highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Seattle. It was clean, quiet and in a fantastic location. The kitchen is well equipped if you want to eat in or just a block from many restaurants if you want to eat out. Chris was a great host. He left a few snacks, which was must appreciated.  Plus a helpful list of places within walking distance helped us make the most of our weekend."
4693488,28496664,2015-03-24,20402024,Nick,"Great place in a great neighborhood with a great host to boot--the perfect place for a longer stay with nice addition of a washer/dryer and easy access to the Phinney/Greenwood neighborhood.  Chris is super flexible and very accommodating, leaving you alone if you need it.  Highly recommended!"
4693488,30333356,2015-04-20,15569827,Allan,"Loved the place. Loved the location.  Bed is super comfy. Chris is respectful of privacy, yet fully available for assistance. I will definitely stay here again and will recommend it to family and friends. "
4693488,31523775,2015-05-06,1963765,Betsy,"Chris is by far the most accommodating host we have encountered through Airbnb thus far. Very nice person!  

 His place is spacious, clean and well laid out. We couldn't have been more pleased staying at this location. The area is just lovely with many places to dine and shop by foot. We will definitely book this location on future Seattle visits. Thank you Chris!"
4693488,32596780,2015-05-19,47227,Mari,"Chris' place was just as described. It was very spacious and comfortable, and had all the amenities we needed for a nice long-weekend stay. He was very easy to communicate with, and made sure we were settled in. The place is in a great residential neighborhood, with easy access to many local shops, and convenient access from the freeway. Thanks, Chris!"
4693488,33514434,2015-05-29,30358160,Sherry,"Chris's place was great. For the price, it's a good value because of the location, a quiet residential street with easy access to the city and greenlake. He was very courteous and easy to get a hold of when needed. Be aware the ceilings are low as described, and the floor is uneven in areas. Overall a satisfactory place for my visiting family. Thanks!"
4693488,33964068,2015-06-02,24241413,Elena,"Chris made us feel welcome with cookies, chips and bottled water upon our arrival! He also provided us with a list of information about the neighborhood and the surrounding area.

The place looked exactly as it did in the photos. It was clean, comfortable and cozy. The neighborhood was lovely and walking distance to a bus stop. 

Being a photographer I brought my camera along. Unfortunately, I forgot to bring a tripod. Chris was kind enough to let me borrow his! 

We loved our stay and would highly recommend this AirBnB to anyone visiting the area!"
4693488,36858973,2015-07-02,2107788,Mason & Renny,Chris and family were great. Gracious and very welcoming.  Plenty of space for a family of 3 and perfectly comfortable enough for a month-long stay. 
4693488,38896822,2015-07-19,36989478,Johnathan,"Great neighborhood to stay in while visiting Seattle!

Great location, close to downtown by bus, and walking distance to  local restaurants/bars/coffee/grocery store!

Place was as described and very clean.  Chris made us feel welcome by having water, snacks, uber/lyft codes, and suggestions for local places to go.  We would stay here again if we are in the Seattle area!"
4693488,41208627,2015-08-05,34409093,Skot,"our host was very friendly over email, and had great communication with us leading up to, and through, our stay; we didn't ahve a chance to meet him in person, unfortunately. There were bottles waters and some light provisions waiting for us which was much appreciated. The property itself was quirky and well decorated. It suited our needs for the few days wonderfully, and we'd happily stay there again. This place is in a great neighborhood, and there was ample street parking close by if not directly in front of the house."
4693488,42115482,2015-08-11,14225176,Raymond,"As we were arriving after 16 hours travelling from England we asked Chris to purchase some breakfast supplies for us which he kindly did.They were there on our arrival at his spacious, comfortable and well equipped basement apartment which more than met our (email hidden)ank you Chris for that and the other snack items which were very much appreciated.
"
4693488,42704627,2015-08-15,15,Kat,"I live locally but my place is small, so Chris's apartment was a great solution for my mom and stepfather when they came to visit. They found the apartment to be clean and comfortable. They also thought the location was super convenient and enjoyed being able to take the very short walk up to the coffee shops, Ken's Market and the pubs on Phinney Ridge. There was plenty of parking for their rental car right near the house. Chris was a great host!"
4693488,43927659,2015-08-23,19070579,Diana,"Chris was so easy to communicate with, even letting my parents stay in the apartment. I just saw them for lunch and they could not stop raving about Chris and his place. Chris was kind enough to have left some refreshments after their long flight, a pleasant surprise. The kitchen is a nice size, with everything you need to cook a meal (pots, pans, plates, utensils, etc). The entire apartment was very clean and the bathroom had towels, soap, face wash, etc. The WIFI worked great and the living room had a very comfy couch and a library section to relax with after a long day. The bed was equally as comfy, not too soft, not to firm. There is plenty of parking on the street, the neighborhood is safe and we do not hesitate to recommend this place traveling to Seattle. 
Thanks for a great stay Chris!"
4693488,45250068,2015-09-01,34930136,Verena,"Chris ist unglaublich hilfsbereit, begrüßt seine Gäste herzlich und steht ihnen mit Rat und Tat zur Seite. Seine freundliche Art und die vielen aufmerksamen Kleinigkeiten haben uns davon überzeugt, dass wir Chris auf jeden Fall als Gastgeber weiterempfehlen."
4693488,46403722,2015-09-10,2506333,Jasmine,"Let me just start with Chris was amazing! When I entered the home there were snacks and bottles of water waiting there for us. He also made an effort to come down to say hi and wished my mom a happy birthday.

The place was quaint and a homey feel. I would stay there again."
4693488,47059642,2015-09-15,39478696,Tim,"What a great place! The apartment is in a great neighborhood, close to everything the city has to offer. I suggest using Uber car service to get around. Rides took no more than 5 minutes to arrive, and it was never more than 15 minutes to get to most places. Chris was a great host, promptly answering any questions I had, and suggested some great things to do and check out. Saying the apartment was ""as described "" would be an understatement. It had everything I needed, and was very clean and comfortable. I will definitely stay here again when I return to the Emerald City. 

Tim, Basalt, Colorado.  "
4693488,50584218,2015-10-12,19699926,Kathy,"Chris's apartment was perfect for us as it was close to where our daughter is living while attending The University.  The neighborhood is beautiful and there are many coffee shops and restaurants are nearby.  There is also a great grocery store nearby that has many organic options.  We really appreciated having a washer and dryer and a kitchen that was nicely equipped.  Chris made it very welcoming with chips, bottled water, and hummus.  Thank you Chris - we will be back!"
4693488,51387692,2015-10-19,34866800,Christopher,Chris's place was exactly what I was looking for on my work trip to Seattle: quiet and private but close to amazing restaurants and bars and a short bus ride away from downtown (and just about anything). He was also an incredibly gracious host and I would absolutely stay here again. 
3143227,13898129,2014-06-07,15615252,Trenton,Paul is a very good host. He responds email and answers all questions very quickly.

Thank you paul."
3143227,15932192,2014-07-18,17466117,Ken,"Great place to stay.  Communication was very prompt.  The location to Capital Hill and Seattle in general is perfect.  Didn't drive, but it looked like there was always parking out on the street.  The room was warm (it was hot in Seattle when I was there) but it cooled right down with the fan provided.  While it's just a room, you feel like you have the run of a whole house."
3143227,16113201,2014-07-22,17014450,Tracy,"This is a great room with a very comfortable bed.  Nice hot shower, great towels, and very quiet all night.  Paul made me feel welcome and at ease.  The beautiful kitchen was stocked with a large variety of coffee and tea.
Although just 2 blocks from the night life of Capitol Hill, this property is a sanctuary from the hubub.  I high recommend staying at Spring Street Center in Seattle."

"
3143227,16362436,2014-07-26,8141632,William,Is what Airbnb is all about. Will stay again when I return to Seattle.
3143227,16532651,2014-07-28,4651486,Gauthier,"Clean,  well located house with a residential neighborhood 10 min away from the city center. Thanks for the stay !"
3143227,16931808,2014-08-04,7981469,Jeff,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was extremely impressed with the accommodations provided by Paul and the Subud community. Here is a play-by-play of my weekend.

Friday: I arrived at the Spring Center at night. It's on the corner of 15th and Spring, right across the street from the park so it was very easy to find. Parking on Spring Street was relatively easy after you find a spot. Just be prepared to parallel park on a hill. Typed in the code and got in. Walked upstairs and found that the room was bigger than I had imagined (the picture made it look small). There was a table and extra pillows in the closet. Looked around and was surprised to find all that many of the amenities you would find at a hotel were provided (Towels, soap, etc.) along with access to a full kitchen. There was water, ice, cups, coffee, tea, and just about everything you need. Had I known this I would have brought food to cook instead of eating out every meal. Did some pre-drinking at the house and then decided to go out.  Many local bars were walking distant. Huge plus! Got back late and knocked out like a baby since the bed and sheets were super comfortable.

Saturday: Woke up to the sun shining into my room – and it happened to be raining too which is kind of weird but I guess that’s Seattle! I didn’t realize the window was facing the east so if you do get this room get ready for an early awakening as it gets bright and hot. There was a small fan but no AC. Paul had provided me with a list of restaurants and destinations so I decided to check out Skillet, which is a 5 minute walk from the house. I thought I would be taking transit the whole time but I ended up using Uber/Lyft/Sidecar, which was convenient and saved a lot of time.

Tips: The bathrooms were clean but everyone uses the one upstairs because it’s next to the rooms. The one on the first floor is bigger if you don’t mind trekking downstairs. And there is a little balcony where you can hang out and have a nice outdoor meal.

3143227,17238662,2014-08-09,1452570,Emily,"Really enjoyed my stay! Clean, quiet, and a great location. Couldn't have asked for better accommodations."
3143227,17376652,2014-08-11,22640,Stacy,This place is such a great deal. It was clean and for the price it's unbeatable. It is a great location close to shops and bus lines. Having use of the kitchen and access to laundry and a clean quiet environment was wonderful.
3143227,18501047,2014-08-27,5098623,June,"Spring Street Center was the perfect place for me to stay in Seattle. It's affordable, clean and beautiful. Paul is very welcoming and I felt right at home. It's super close to everything including awesome yoga studios, cafes, a co-op and trader joes! I loved sitting on the deck eating meals and watching the sun set, there's a great view of the space needle. Also, the kitchen is very clean and wonderful and my bed was comfy. overall this is the perfect place to stay for a peaceful lovely experience in Seattle. Thanks Paul! I can't wait to come back. :-) "
3143227,19268614,2014-09-09,3201333,Allen,"Paul's place was very spacious, tidy,  and quiet.  Everything that you'd expect in a house was made available.   Parking was plentiful and the neighborhood was very peaceful. It was a very smooth experience,  and I would definitely come back next time I'm in Seattle!"
3143227,19944458,2014-09-21,16513248,Sang Hun,"Great place convenient to access to downtown Seattle. 
A comfortable, clean, and quiet guestroom.
An economic but wonderful room rate."
3143227,20561611,2014-10-01,20315605,Payam,"I had a great experience in this place. Great location, nice house, everything as promised. I met Paul very briefly a few days after my arrival, which means that entering the house was very uncomplicated. Will definitely go there again. "
3143227,21383296,2014-10-16,437363,Vincent,"That worked out perfectly for me! Great location, Great value and friendly host! I would definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to visit Seattle!  "
3143227,21961828,2014-10-27,21637842,Joe,"This place was exactly as promised. I actually never even saw my host or anyone else in the house, since I was at a conference and wasn't there much beyond sleeping. It worked out perfectly for my needs, and the location was CRUCIAL. It was only a mile walk to downtown and I didn't even need to take a cab to get to my conference. It couldn't have worked better. The instructions to get there from SeaTac airport were great. Public transportation in Seattle is fantastic and cheap. Only $2.75 to take the light rail into downtown. "
3143227,22152166,2014-10-31,21061918,Avery,"Staying at the Spring Street Center was a great experience. I didn't actually meet Paul in person but he was good with communicating via messaging and phone. The check-in and check-out process was flexible and convenient. I was able to leave a few bags in the house after I checked-out while I waited for my flight to leave.

The room was comfy and clean. The kitchen and laundry had everything a guest could hope for. The neighborhood seemed very nice and easily walkable to restaurants, groceries, coffee shops and bus lines to other parts of the city.

Would definitely stay again."
3143227,22585674,2014-11-10,21098893,Gustavo,"Excelente anfitriao, muito solicito e divertido. A vizinhanca e tranquila e quieta, perfeita para descansar. O quarto e limpo, organizado e muito confortavel. Recomendo para quem buscar um lugar amigavel em Seattle."
3143227,24234637,2014-12-23,21620376,Edgar,"My stay at this property was amazing! In huge part thanks to the personalized tours offered by Paul on my first two days in Seattle. I was offered with a lot of information and tips which I was able to use during my entire trip. I was able to move throughout the city by using the public transportation (any smart tourist/traveller with a smart phone will be able to accomplish this) and my very own set of legs. The Subud lodge was very conveniently located to a lot of little cafes, convenience stores and other places of interest so I walked everywhere and didn't even need the services of any uber drivers during this trip! Being from San Francisco, the weather in Seattle was not too harsh on me and I tried not to use my umbrella when walking on the streets since the rain in Seattle is more of a shower than actual rain. My room was very comfortable and quiet, the house was very clean and I really appreciated the kitchen, it saved me a lot of money. I only spent about $55 worth of groceries that lasted me for my entire stay. I am so glad I stayed at this property and will definitely suggest it to any of my friends visiting Seattle and plan on staying there again when I visit Seattle in the future. Thank you Paul, you are awesome!"
3143227,24369652,2014-12-27,11212345,Michelle,Spring street center was a great place to stay. The room was large and common areas were perfect for my needs. Location was a short walk to downtown.  Did not meet Paul in person but we did txt a few times and he was helpful and seems like a nice guy. Would definitely recommend the place to others.
3143227,25243498,2015-01-10,20071210,Luis,"Great home and room. Very clean and comfortable. Was fun to meet another guest at the house. Its very close to the bus stops, and if you enjoy walking a little, you can make it to downtown in half an hour.

"
3143227,27349932,2015-03-02,27564756,Callen,Paul was incredibly accommodating and welcoming! He responded quickly to messages and was very friendly in person. The trip was so lovely as a result. I would stay here again if I ever travel back to Seattle!
3143227,27997907,2015-03-16,26268681,Wenjun,"Great house! Paul is a nice host and gave me many useful suggestions to move in. The facilities in the house are easy to use, with detailed and clear instructions. The neighborhood has beautiful landscape, decorated with fully-bloomed cherryblossom, and all kinds of plants. Anyway it is an ideal place for your temporary stay in Seattle."
3143227,28570537,2015-03-26,28591840,Willi,"Thanks to Paul I had a memorable time in his city. He literally went out of his way to make my stay unforgettable, and I deeply thank him for that. Paul is an awesome host and he has a lot of information and recommendations about the city that are definitely worth following up on. The house is in a very good neighborhood, quiet, yet not far from some interesting nightlife. It's spotlessly clean, and fantastic value. I cannot recommend this place highly enough.
One last word: I will be back, and if it's only to meet Paul again!"
3143227,28869022,2015-03-31,11725021,Joel,"Spring Street has been my best AirBnb experience thus far. It is located in a lovely neighborhood within walking distance to bars, restaurants, a coop grocery store, and downtown Seattle. The building itself is charming, well-kept, and has all the amenities one could like.

Paul gave me a fantastic poetry/ anti-gentrification tour! I saw Denise Levertov's grave, which is curiously nearby Bruce Lee's.

Rooms open directly onto the hallway, so with a full house noise can be a bit of an issue. I found myself wearing earplugs when going to bed."
3143227,29934453,2015-04-14,29738636,Scott,Paul is super friendly. He gave me some good suggestions for places to visit. The house is immaculate and very comfortable. 1.1 miles from the convention center was an easy walk. I felt very safe in Seattle.
3143227,30612211,2015-04-25,5944756,Hasan,"I never met him, butPaul is a very good host. He responds email and answers all questions very quickly."
3143227,31084118,2015-05-01,25869890,Chanhwi,"Paul is a nice, kind and open-minded person. I arrived there quite earlier, but he let me enter the house easily with a password on the door. In the next morning I met him in person and surprisingly he gave a city tour to me for over an hour. He recommended some good restaurants, juice bars, sushi bars, and sake bars. We went to the Bruce Lee's graveyard and Volunteer Park and taught me how to take a shot of brilliant Space Needle photo shot there. 1st floor of the house is a roomy living room and a modernized kitchen. Kitchen has everything. It has even cooking oven, dish washer, and espresso coffee machine. I strongly recommend this place. "
3143227,31553270,2015-05-06,7936651,Sam,"Room was clean , communication was good even though Paul was out of the country, great value for the price . Great location with a short stroll to Capitol Hill (one of the coolest neighbourhoods in Seattle) and downtown isn't too far either"
3143227,32141173,2015-05-14,16679159,Serena,"My stay at Spring Street Center was amazing. The house is very clean and comfortable, and the staff very kind. I strongly recommend this place! "
3143227,32763863,2015-05-21,28556236,Hendrik,"I had such a great time. Just love Seattle. The place is great. Very nice neighborhood and just a 15min walk to the heart of the city. The place was very clean and provided more than needed.
Thank you very much, for this experience!"
3143227,33152810,2015-05-25,13335563,Abesh,"The room was great and Paul was very communicative with almost instant replies to my thousand questions. Even though he wasn't physically there, the room was clean and kept ready. This is a great listing and I was super happy!"
3143227,33775364,2015-06-01,6868073,Esther,"Great experience! Paul was awesome responding to any little question. The space was clean and comfortable, in a PERFECT location. 

I was traveling alone for work and had no problems with noise or disturbance from the other guests, even though all the rooms were booked. 

If you are ok with sharing a bathroom (there are 2 and they are very clean) then I would HIGHLY recommend the Spring Street Center."
3143227,34074532,2015-06-04,32363481,Sean,"I had a great time in Seattle staying at Spring Street Center. All areas of the house were very accessible to guests. The room was clean, had all necessities, and the location was great - about a half hour walk to downtown and Pike Place, but in a quiet residential neighborhood. The hosts, including Paul, were very welcoming and had great suggestions. I enjoyed meeting people from all over the world in my brief stay, and would recommend this listing to anyone."
3143227,34246760,2015-06-06,2785019,James,"For the price and location, its a pretty great deal. Everything is pretty seamless, you more than likely will not meet the host. Just be wary that it's more like a private hostel, and your experience may depend on the quality of the other guests in the neighboring rooms. There is no sound proofing so you hear everything in the hallway, so it can be quite noisy especially if other guests are moving around late at night, which was common during my two night stay."
3143227,34633177,2015-06-10,26728754,Lisa,"Your facility is lovely, in a perfect area. Couldn't have been more comfortable or felt more welcomed there ! I met a few of the other guests in my first days and they were awesome. A woman visiting with her husband from Canada, and a young exchange student touring the US before returning home to live.  Interesting and friendly. 
The room was perfect Paul, right down to the little details! The fluffy linens with the shampoo and body wash! The deck upstairs out back for solitude and pondering ! The extra fans for those of us used to AC.The washer and dryer for convenience. All the comforts of home, and then some ! Thanks Again Paul!!"
3143227,35205170,2015-06-16,14704531,Robert,"I only met Paul briefly as I was checking out, but he was very friendly, and we had a great chat about all sorts of things. Paul runs his place very professionally and was very easy to communicate with and helpful through messages before and during my trip. 

You'll enjoy your stay with Paul if you appreciate a house that's respectful and well organised."
3143227,36030551,2015-06-24,15063323,JOseph,"I stayed four nights and found the house and room to be extremely clean and comfortable. It felt like a basic dorm room, but of course far more tidy. The house has a welcoming feel  to it, and the location was perfect for my needs. I never met Paul, but he was kind and accommodating when we emailed or spoke on the phone. I'll stay there again when I next visit Seattle."
3143227,36222805,2015-06-26,31789649,Avril,"It's a very nice and warm place. Room, kitchen and bathroom are all clean and well organized. Only 30 minutes walking to downtown. I would definitely visit Seattle and chose here to stay again. Also wanna send my special thanks to Marston. 非常棒的地方，舒适温馨！"
3143227,36515608,2015-06-29,23552612,Kasey,"Paul was extremely accommodating!  He immediately made me feel welcome in the Spring Street Center.  The residence definitely feels more like an international house than a religious meeting hall.  My neighbors were foreign tourists throughout the weekend, and we all had a pleasant time relaxing on the patio or downstairs together. I would definitely stay here again!"
3143227,36920356,2015-07-02,31343043,Ellen,"This is my first time for using airbnb. It is amazing. The house is very nice and clean. The neighborhood also is safe and beautiful. Transportation is convenient. We took bus 2 for several times to go to city center. Also by walk, around 30 minutes. Though I can not see Paul, but It is very easy to do everything by myself. All directions are very clearly. Paul is very kindly and allowed me to put my luggages in the first floor earlier than checkin time and later than checkout time. Thanks, Paul. I will introduce your place to my friends. I also will stay your house again with my next trip. Ellen "
3143227,37448793,2015-07-07,2893286,Oscar,A great stay once again at the Spring Street Center!  My team enjoyed the comfort of all four rooms and the super convenient location.  We'll be back next year!
3143227,37715958,2015-07-09,37451290,Scott,"Felt lucky to discover this listing, especially last-minute, as it is usually booked well in advance.   This is a very special place - peaceful, well-organized, extremely clean, with (for me) just the right mix of privacy and group encounter.  This is a good one, worth planning ahead for."
3143227,38309641,2015-07-14,15924982,Travis,"The room was clean, quiet, and peaceful. Just what I needed. Will definitely stay here next time I pass through Seattle."
3143227,38717549,2015-07-18,26392170,George,"I had a great stay in the Spring Street Center. The street is nice and quiet but close to cool stuff in Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus or bike. The room was comfortable and spacious and had a great view over the park across the road.

I didn't actually meet Paul but he was very communicative by text and phone."
3143227,40101239,2015-07-28,34470831,Marissa,"I stayed an entire week at Spring Street, and could not have asked for better (or more affordable!) accommodations. Common spaces were well-maintained, and Paul was friendly and quick to answer any questions I had via phone and/or the airbnb site. I thought I might encounter issues with noise (being that there were multiple guests in the house at once) but everyone was very considerate of one another. The hubbub of Capitol Hill and downtown were easily accessible via walking or the bus, and the area surrounding the house felt safe. Truly, Spring Street is a very special place! "
3143227,40571150,2015-08-01,34605,Karinne,"The Spring Street Center is a wonderful place to stay. It was very easy and quick to arrange everything with Paul. The house is beautifully cared for and the rooms are simple but perfect for a small retreat. Though all four rooms were full over the course of my stay, it was never a problem or a wait to share the bathrooms -- there are several -- and the house promotes a feeling of respect and peace among the guests. The neighborhood was really nice to walk around, and convenient to many excellent eating places. "
3143227,40919136,2015-08-03,9089729,John,"I stayed at the Spring Street Center in Seattle's Capital Hill neighborhood at the end of July, 2015. I would highly recommend this lodging to anyone who is looking for budget accommodations in the city. The location was ideal for my visit, as it was central to the nightlife and entertainment district of Capital Hill. The room itself was small and spartan, with a twin bed (Room 1). Other rooms had larger beds. I think there is enough room to upgrade to a queen or at least a double. 4 rooms share 2 bathrooms and a full kitchen. Everything was quite clean.

This is a spiritual center, so you have to keep an open mind and be respectful. Paul, the host, explained all of this in a very detailed welcome message. It's very self-service - I never even met the host. Received a door code via email prior to arrival, and did not see another person there for the first 48 hours. Altogether it was a great stay. Oh, if it's summer, you should know there is no A/C, but that probably only matters a few weeks out of the year."
3143227,41924425,2015-08-10,30109571,Bradley,"The room is nice and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet and felt very safe. The house is very clean and well kept. I really enjoyed my stay here, and will definitely be returning if I ever make it back to Seattle! The location is also great since it is a block away from the bus station and several great restaurants. "
3143227,43490281,2015-08-20,34708889,Chan Kook,"The room was really nice. It was my first visit on Seattle. It was pretty close distance from the downtown Seattle. I was able to get anything from the neighborhood. Even though the room is quite cheap, the room actually has everything for the visit. I definitely use again if I go to Seattle."
3143227,43959885,2015-08-23,25722817,Rob,Paul was a great host. He even went the extra mile to drive me into town and give me some pointers on good dining opportunities and attractions. Accommodations were as expected - basic but good value.
3143227,44667870,2015-08-28,5861869,Fabian,"this was the best choice i could do for seattle at this price. the house is very charming and offers everthing you need for a pleasant stay. the neighboorhood is super relaxed, save and is situated in one of the hipster areas of seattle, you will find various cool cafe's, bars, restaurants and clubs. paul took care about everything in a proper way, was always very quick in responding and made my stay there so uncomplicated. finally we met and he took me for a quick tour through the city and brought me to the bus station, what a great guy! will definitely stay there again when coming back to Seattle.."
3143227,45548466,2015-09-04,7661966,JiHyun,"Although I didn't meet Paul in person. He recommended me great places to visit and eat in Seattle. Also, the place was very neat and quiet. I would highly recommend this place if someone close asked me where to stay in Seattle."
3143227,46381396,2015-09-10,19407370,Matt,"I loved my stay at the Spring Street Center. It provided everything that I needed and was in a great location not too far from the Capital Hill area. While Paul wasn't present during my stay, he communicated with me everything I needed to know. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone who is visiting, and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
3143227,46675533,2015-09-12,35383225,Sivan,"Wow, what a great decision! I highly recommend! Great location, you can walk downtown or take the bus it's super close to the house! Clean and comfortable, wish I could stay longer!!!!! "
3143227,47438632,2015-09-18,44177956,Carl,"A nice quiet neighborhood, a safe and secure room in a nice house, nothing creepy or off putting about it. 
Paul is a very welcoming host.  Great location. I will stay there again or recommenced to anyone looking very affordable and basic, clean and comfortable accommodations. "
3143227,47662589,2015-09-21,10787634,Gina,"Spring Street Center was clean and well-kept during my stay in Seattle. The house is close to the bars/restaurants/shops on Pike Street, while still being in a quiet neighborhood. The front door code takes a little getting used to, but was ultimately more convenient than picking up/dropping off a key. Since the house is set up to have more than one guest at a time, there are helpful tips and instructions in the kitchen, bathrooms, etc. One thing to keep in mind, though, is that because of the hardwood floors and the old(er) residential construction it can be a little bit ""boom-y"" at night. Great house, great host, highly recommended!"
3143227,48692948,2015-09-28,15961873,Taliesin,"I had yet another wonderful experience with AirBnB at the Spring Street Center in Seattle. Paul is terrific! He is very responsive and kind. I knew from our initial communication that the Spring Street Center would be a wonderful place to stay. The home is clean, tidy and very welcoming. My room was spacious and cozy. Paul and his community make it possible for like-minded souls to enjoy their lovely center and I am very grateful to them for providing such a special home-away-from-home. "
3143227,49287904,2015-10-02,33806733,Robinson,"I thoroughly enjoyed the stay in the house. The house was extremely clean and had everything I needed during my stay. It's only a short commute away from downtown so the location is ideal. Paul is also very nice to speak to, he came by twice to check on the guests to ensure everything is going smoothly. I'll recommend this place if you are traveling to Seattle."
3143227,49650595,2015-10-05,1288737,Aaron,Great spot to stay!
3143227,49893500,2015-10-07,7776627,Elizabeth,"My recent stay at the Spring Street Center was great!  The house is lovely, quiet and calming and the rooms are pleasant, comfortable and very clean. The kitchen is beautiful and recently renovated.  The house guidelines are simple and as long as someone is okay sharing two full bathrooms among four guest rooms and sharing a kitchen, which I found to be absolutely no problem, this is an ideal place to stay.  Location is in a quiet part of a neighborhood bustling with activity and is an is an easy drive or bus-ride into downtown and all the big local attractions. I highly recommend this lodging and have plans to stay there regularly as I travel from Portland to Seattle. "
3143227,50650342,2015-10-13,30158973,Selena,"The location of the house is very good ,Walking few minutes can catch the bus to downtown,it is very convenient.The room is very tidy,I really love the bed,it is very comfortable.I have a good rest at night after walk a lot at the daytime.Paul is a very nice and helpful person.I appreciated for his help.I have a great time at Seattle.I definitely recommend to stay at Paul's house."
3143227,51458288,2015-10-20,44265132,Russell,It has been a great stay at the place. Everything is organized and stuff is prepared. Really enjoyed the stay there!
3143227,52698208,2015-11-01,43744909,Moonkyung Dalgang,"It was a great stay at spring street center. I've spent 11 nights there, had no problem at all to reach places for coffee, to eat and to volunteer park where I needed to be most of the days. I'm sure everyone stayed will agree. 
Thank you spring street center. "
3143227,53980169,2015-11-15,27450433,Lili,房子的总体清洁程度是不错的。一共四个Air房间出租、公用一个卫生间。没有早餐。不用见房东也没觉得有不便。出门不是很方便 基本都要向西步行15-30分钟（根据要去的地方不同）。
3143227,55366656,2015-12-01,26374136,Kathleen,"I loved staying at the Subud house ...a real home in a residential neighbrohood. Paul was wonderful .... always available by phone for any questions I had. The room was spacious, clean, comfortable with everything I needed (bedside lamp, electric outlets, iron+board, closet, drawers ...). And the price was right. I'll stay again on any trips to marvelous Seattle."
3143227,56114813,2015-12-09,45617141,Takahiro,"Even though I inadvertently entered and used the wrong room where I hadn't booked,  the host flexibly arranged the setting."
3143227,56259275,2015-12-11,30714013,Olivia,"Near this place is so beautiful and quite.
I liked so much!
You can take a bus 2 from downtown to come home. It's easy."
3143227,57430601,2015-12-26,45172885,Qiyun,This place is amazing. Transportation here is convenient. Bus is accessible within a 3-minute-walk and the house is near downtown. It is really clean and beautiful，and it has everything you might need： Wi-Fi，laundry and a wonderful kitchen.
117862,324785,2011-06-20,662510,Brandon,"Matt was a great host, and we enjoyed our stay at the apartment."
117862,573430,2011-09-27,850933,Steve,"Most aspects of the stay that were worthy of 5 stars and others that would warrant a 2 star rating, the latter not being in any way host-related. 4  Star overall.
5-star: 
- The property is close to most popular Seattle attractions
- View is *exactly* as advertised. Beautiful view of the Space Needle.
- underground parking a BIG relief!! Parking is scarce in the area
- nicely laid out property; PLENTY of space for 2 people
- owner accessible and very accommodating
2-star:
- Street noise can be a problem. The streets are narrow, buildings mostly 2 story and above so the sound of traffic (large trucks during our stay) reverberated and was amplified by the surrounding buildings 
- if the weather is warm (and it was for half of the visit) it will get uncomfortable in the apartment. To be fair, this is common in (website hidden) is not necessary most of the time but the lack of it when it is hot and humid is, well, uncomfortable. A couple ceiling fans and the issue is moot.

Matt's place is perfect for the couple visiting Seattle and want a clean, comfortable, spacious place to rest and relax. 

Read the amenities carefully. A TV is not included. 

Anyone wishing to enjoy the Seattle attractions by day and catch a couple of televised sporting events at night or catch the scores of the teams back home, will have to do it with a computer instead of ESPN. "
117862,842628,2012-01-06,2695525,Avni,"Best part of this condo was the view and the location. Waking up and falling asleep to the view of the space needle and the lush mountains at a distance was really relaxing. Condo is in best location of Seattle, Capital Hill, a place full of trendy restaurants and lovely dive bars. Downtown is walking distance to Shopping district and the pier. Matt is a very responsive host, always answering all my question within minutes. The bed was comfy, size of the condo was perfect for 2 people, and the heating worked very well. Only negative of the condo was the bathroom was a bit dirty, and the condo did not come with the basics (shampoo/condition/soap/hairdryer) that I had become accustomed to at other Airbnb spots. However, this wasnt a big problem since there was a Supermart down the street. I give this condo an A-."
117862,9149020,2013-12-09,10338223,Deanna,"The location was perfect, walking distance to everything I needed and the free parking was a bonus! The apartment was clean and comfortable and had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. Matt was helpful when I had any questions. Will probably try and stay here the next time I visit, already recommended it to my friends!"
117862,9396276,2013-12-26,2439300,Scott,"This condo rental has an outstanding location and Matt has provided it with everything you could possibly want (as he states, no TV, but I streamed whatever I needed).  I'm a Seattle resident who needed to make way for out of town family members over the holidays, and knowing the city I chose this area for my two-week stay. You can walk to a myriad of interesting shops, restaurants and bars--Capitol Hill is probably tops in the city for that sort of thing--and the walk downtown isn't too bad either.  If you don't want to walk, there are several frequent bus lines within a couple of blocks to Downtown, the Seattle Center and to the UW.  Having a parking spot included is an extra bonus especially when you look at other central Seattle places...you won't really need a car unless you need to commute like I did, but if you have one it's really a plus to have a place to park in that neighborhood!

The unit is pleasantly furnished and the view is as described--maybe better--you see the Space Needle directly through the window and all the lights of the city from Downtown to Lake Union spread out before you.  Very little noise, especially for the center city--being the winter I rarely had the windows open, but if you do you will get some noise from the freeway nearby.  The street is quiet.

Checking in/out could not have been simpler.  I am certain Matt would have provided any assistance I needed but none was.  The washer and dryer worked fine.  Not certain whether or not I was on the unit's wifi as there were no directions given in that regard; I was connected automatically to something but not sure if it was correct.  At any rate, I had no problems with it.  Also no information given about garbage/recycling, which is actually outside the building and around the corner, tucked in to a garage entry.  It took me a little while to find it!

I definitely recommend this unit not only for the outstanding location but for the fact you literally need nothing from cleaning supplies to about everything possible you'd want in the kitchen.  A very pleasant stay.

(don't forget to treat yourself to one of Seattle's hidden food gems just a block or so away--the walk-up Malaysian place Kedai Makan is only a take-away window but the food is great and you can take it back to your temporary Seattle home!  Plus it's open late for those days you're out and about....)"
117862,9502307,2013-12-31,8883745,Michael,"Matt's place had everything we were looking for---Capital Hill area, convenient to all downtown Seattle, really well-equipped kitchen with gas stove and all basic appliances and utensils, comfy queen-size bed, quiet, plenty of room all around. The addition of the secure garage was a real plus given the limited parking in the area.  Matt was very quick to respond to emails as well. I'd stay again, without question. "
117862,9652374,2014-01-04,9775892,Brendon,"We had a wonderful time at the apartment!! Great location in Capitol Hill and Matt was a pleasure to work with. Check in was a breeze and the place was well stocked. Try breakfast up the hill at Arabica, amazing!!"
117862,10046738,2014-01-27,359175,Arvis,"Matt's apartment was perfect. Spacious, clean, great location, nice view. Free underground parking was very convenient in this part of the (website hidden) would be a great addition but that's not essential. Did not meet Matt personally but he handled the check in perfectly from distance."
117862,10126766,2014-02-01,4379729,Wei,Great location. Convenient check in. Well stocked everything (towels kitchen stuff) to make it feel like a home. Timely response to inquiries. 
117862,10429565,2014-02-18,11614489,Theresa,"The view and location were great and the parking helped a lot for the area. Lots of great restaurants and bars within walking distance. The unit had everything we needed. As someone else pointed out in a review, there isn't a TV but that was fine for us since we didn't come to Seattle to stay in and watch TV. We'd definitely stay here again if we were in the area. "
117862,10686104,2014-03-03,10864276,Olaf,"Had a great stay here.  The view and the apartment are just like in the pictures.  Fantastic neighborhood full of restaurants and bars, but the apartment itself is on a quiet side street.  Matt was super responsive to all my communications and made the logistics real easy.  I'd definitely stay here again or recommend to a friend."
117862,10829147,2014-03-09,7037450,Kevin,"We loved our 2 night stay in Matt's condo. The neighborhood was perfect, within walking distance to tons of bars, restaurants, shopping, and some great running routes. And don't underestimate the value of having guaranteed parking in this area -- definitely a huge plus.

We thought of the condo itself as a nice alternative to a hotel room (rather than a stay at a comfortable home). It's very clean, everything is new and works perfectly, but it doesn't really have much in the way of character. That didn't impact us at all and we'd gladly stay again."
117862,11019674,2014-03-17,8348715,Rick,"Matt has a great place. This is our second time staying there. Always clean, nice area and view of the space needle. Next time I need an Airbnb in Seattle, Matt will be the first place I look into."
117862,11181070,2014-03-24,7228730,Steven,"Matt was an excellent host.  His place is incredibly clean, in a great location, and has phenomenal views of Seattle!  "
117862,11283695,2014-03-28,12681962,Julia,"I loved this place! Location and parking are top of the list, but it was quite comfortable and well stocked. I wish I had brought my laptop for a midnight movie, but the area has so much to do that I stayed busy!"
117862,12593929,2014-05-05,14861237,Michael,"The Condo
Very clean, fully furnished, well appointed, and nicely decorated.  Fantastic view of the Space Needle and Puget Sound.  An ideal retreat for those who prefer to live like the locals when traveling.

The Neighborhood
Ideally situated as a launching point for all Seattle-area attractions.  It's a quick shot into downtown, Pike Place, the Space Needle, museums, etc. Most are within 2 miles.  It's also close to the freeway making it easy to head out for longer, more distant adventures. Filled with restaurants, shopping, and bars the neighborhood itself has plenty to offer.  There is an awesome Starbucks just one block behind the condo.
 
The Host
Matt was gracious and helpful.  Easy to reach if you have any questions.  Highly recommended to anyone. We will be back."
117862,13086859,2014-05-19,10360056,Taran,"Apt was great. Huge, clean, with lovely views. Everything even better then expected. Host was friendly and easy to reach."
117862,20496858,2014-09-30,18219983,Julie,"We really enjoyed staying at Matt's unit.  It was clean and very welcoming.  It was a great location with a beautiful city view.  Furnishings were great!  Also, Matt was very responsive and welcoming if we needed anything.  We had a fabulous time!"
117862,34999834,2015-06-14,2766729,Delvin,"Matt's apartment was clean, closely situated to downtown and spacious.  We had an awesome stay and couldn't believe how close we were to restaurants, shops and entertainment.  I would highly recommend staying here."
6852243,48648106,2015-09-27,4243844,Rachel,"Trang's apartment was great! In a nice secure apartment block with a comfy bed and well sized private bathroom. Her communication was excellent and even though she wasn't available when we arrived, her housemate showed us around and made sure we had everything we needed. Would definitely recommend this place :)"
6852243,49302980,2015-10-02,44340256,Paul,The host was very helpful and went out of her way to make me feel welcome. 
6852243,49567958,2015-10-04,3586924,Mary,"Trang was very welcoming and responsive. The room is small but very efficient, in a new apartment shared by other guests. Trang lists the location as Yesler Terrace but it is really very near Capital Hill - a nice mixed neighborhood."
6852243,49860016,2015-10-06,11248248,Rosaleen,"Trang was a wonderful host - she went above and beyond, even before we arrived at her apartment! She was extremely helpful and responsive, and even checked traffic conditions while we were en route, and was readily available via text our entire stay. The room was small and minimal, but comfy and perfect for our short stay. The apartment was very clean - not to mention a fantastic location - a short walk from Century Link Field. Overall, this was perfect for what we needed, and Trang was just the most attentive and friendly host - we couldn't have asked for more :)
"
6852243,51101930,2015-10-17,28527374,Riku,"My decision was good. Actually, Trang's place was so nice. If I have a chance to visit Seattle, I would come back here again 100%."
6852243,51997358,2015-10-25,15196458,Eugene,Trang is a very welcoming host. She gave me very useful advise on places to visit. The room is clean and comfortable. Location is good -  it took me only 15 minutes to walk to Sky View Observatory or 25 minutes to Pike Place market. 
6291829,37476639,2015-07-07,34292251,Angie,Kary was wonderful with all communication exchanges both prior to and during the trip.  The house is beautiful and so convenient to everything Seattle has to offer from city living to the gorgeous outlying nature preserves.  We were pleased with the dining recommendations offered and enjoyed a wide variety of menus within walking distance of the house.  Thank you for allowing our family to enjoy your home!!
6291829,37862643,2015-07-11,10076027,Sabrina,"House was beautiful, very clean and perfectly located.  katy was easy to work with and all was as promised.  This is an excellent place for a group - would highly recommend this to anyone!"
6291829,38576860,2015-07-17,6949593,Anne-Lauren,The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6291829,41358315,2015-08-07,29094118,Daniel,"The listing was a little modest. The house was outstanding and the neighborhood better. Kary's home was all we could ask for, beautifully kept and perfect for us. "
6291829,41943504,2015-08-10,26698359,Christopher,The home and neighborhood is exactly as it is described. A great place in QA with lots to do all in walking distance.  There was a near cancelation from the owner but she worked it out and we got to stay in the home.  Glad we did because it is a beautiful home and perfect size for our 10 out of town guests.
5422159,28134215,2015-03-18,27114267,Mike,Jen's downtown apartment was perfect. The location couldn't have been better. She accommodated our early check in request and we found an extremely clean and well furnished apartment. I will definitely consider booking with Jen again if I'm in Seattle.
5422159,28583029,2015-03-26,13703266,Matt,"Great location & Jen was very helpful in accommodating my late arrival. The high ceilings are really nice, and it's a quick walk to everything downtown. She was quick to respond and the apartment was clean and had everything you would expect at an apartment (dishes, laundry, dish washer). Def recommended!"
5422159,28719870,2015-03-29,2189733,Brian,"This is good deal for an amazing location--you can exit the building right onto the Harbor Steps, and find great waterfront views, restaurants, cafes, and a deli without even crossing the street! All the attractions of downtown are within a short walk.

The apartment itself is very sparely furnished; it doesn't include complimentary toiletries, and the kitchen isn't stocked with salt or oil or other staples, so self-catering isn't a practical option. But if you're planning a busy weekend without much time sitting around the house, it's a very comfortable and convenient place to rest!"
5422159,29304243,2015-04-06,5735945,Alexandra,Had a great stay at this apartment! Lovely clean building and very convenient location for the conference that I was attending. I even got to make use of the gym and the library while I was there. 
5422159,29744537,2015-04-12,2209026,Kristen,"Jen's place was perfect for me while I was in town for a conference, conveniently located a short walk away from from the Convention Center,  Pike Place Market, and the waterfront trails for jogging. Her complex has a very nice gym, and her apartment had all the amenities I needed. Jen was easy to communicate with and I would recommend this spot to other guests."
5422159,31042026,2015-05-01,2356845,Frank,"This nice studio is ideally located on the Harbor Steps, midway between 1st and Western Avenues and just across from the Seattle Art Museum.  Pike Place, the Great Wheel and the waterfront are a short stroll away.  Restaurants, bars and shops are all around.  The flat is somewhat spare, but it has the essentials for a comfortable stay.  Wi-Fi was fast and reliable.  The TV has a good cable channel selection (TCM, AMC, local channels, sports), as well as Smart-TV with Netflix and many other options.  The new pillowtop queen mattress makes for a good sleep.  The heating worked fine on the few chilly nights.  The building’s gym, library and comfortable common areas are added pluses.  Jen happily accommodated my late check-in.  I did not meet her but check-in with her colleague went smoothly.  Check-out was simply a matter of leaving the key and locking the door.  I would certainly stay here again."
5422159,33093213,2015-05-25,14936302,Jon,The unit is in a great location near Pike Place Market.  It had everything we needed and was very clean.  Jen was very accommodating with an early check-in then a late check-in after our flight was cancelled.  I highly suggest staying at this location and I will again when I am in Seattle.
5422159,34060523,2015-06-04,12857868,Carolyn,Everything was better than we expected. Ideal location for us. We'd definitely stay here again!
5422159,34416027,2015-06-08,30022968,Tim,"I would echo the other reviews so far in terms of good cleanliness, central location and Jen as a good host.  We would recommend the stay.  I wanted to add a few more notes.  The location is great being near the harbor steps.  There is access to both the lower waterfront level and the elevated 1st avenue level (via skywalk on the 6th floor) from the building.  This is helpful to get started on the right city level when leaving the building.  The SeaTac train station is just over a block away and was convenient for airport transfer and uber was fast and cheap for downtown navigation.

Jen had a representative that helped accommodate our late check in as well and was attentive when we requested some things for our stay.  The sleep accommodation for the 3rd person is a non-convertible couch.  It is comfortable, but it would not fit a tall person.  I am 5'9"" and I'm slightly tall for it. "
5422159,34672894,2015-06-10,34566818,Carl,Jen did a great job communicating with me and getting checked into the unit. Great location in the city. The unit was just as described. Lots of attractions close by to the unit. 
5422159,34945861,2015-06-14,30052199,Darren,"Great, quiet apartment with all the amenities you need, really. Check in was smooth & easy. Wonderful location; ideal for all things central. Just steps from the market, waterfront, transit and some great bars/cafe's/restaurants. 

Didn't meet Jen, but she was always at the end of the phone if needed; very polite and quick to respond.

Will definitely stay here again."
5422159,35303503,2015-06-17,31798263,John,"Jen accommodated our early check-in, by having her lovely friend welcome us (family of 4; 2 children under 4). The apartment is truly centrally located, as you can literally step out the back and into Post Alley! From there, it is a mere couple blocks to the Pike Place. The apartment is clean, and simply furnished. Thank you for taking care of us!
"
5422159,35455603,2015-06-19,28704550,Tim,"Location was great, a few blocks from Pikes Market. Had to wait a bit for check in due to traffic etc, but once we got in, everything was perfect. Thanks again! "
5422159,36006840,2015-06-24,25604890,Mike,"This place is in a fantastic location! Easy walking to Pikes Market, ""gum alley"", and the wharf area. Many restaurants and shops nearby. We didn't get to meet Jen, but her friend met us and showed us to the apartment. It is clean, minimally furnished, with a comfortable bed. Because of its great location downtown it is somewhat noisy, too noisy for us to enjoy the outdoor balcony that has a peek-a-boo view of the water. This apartment is perfect for seeing downtown Seattle."
5422159,36383576,2015-06-28,31547609,Darren,"I did not interact with Jen at all, other than a text to line up check in/out. The location is the best thing about this apartment. It is in a perfect spot! It is a close walk to anything downtown as well as the waterfront. There is a restaurant called ""Vons"" right beside the building that is a great place to have a bite! The apartment is simple, but is perfect for a single person or a couple. Also, either there isn't any A/C or I didn't know how to work it, so on a sunny day the apartment could get warm. To get over this, go explore the city! "
5422159,37326837,2015-07-06,29277512,Erica,"Jen's Seattle apartment was great! It's in a great location -  5 min. walk to the Great Wheel & Aquarium, 5 min. to Pike Place, and about 7 min. from the University Park station which connects to SeaTac as well as the monorail to Seattle Center at Westlake Station. The neighborhood is very quiet, so quiet that we left our windows open at night and weren't woken up by street noise. There is no AC, which normally wouldn't be a problem, except there was a heat wave the weekend we visited. We closed the blinds and windows before leaving for the day, so it kept the cooler air in, but it still got steamy in the evenings.

During my stay, Jen responded quickly to questions. Before my stay though, I hadn't heard from her about how to pick up the keys after attempts to contact her via AirBnB messenger, email, text and phone call 48 and 24 hours before my flight. She got back to me at 9p the night before, but apologized for the delayed response.

Overall, it was a great stay, and I would stay again. Thanks Jen!"
5422159,37739467,2015-07-10,11561495,Peter,"Located a few blocks from Pike Place Market, the apartment was perfectly located for those wanting to see the hub of Seattle like us. It's also close to the train/bus terminals and so we were easily able to explore outer Seattle without a car. The apartment itself is well stocked, bathroom is clean and nice, and the bed is adequate (on the softer side of life) depending on your (website hidden) has a lots of channels and we were able to relax during our stay. 

For now, the only (slight) downside was the construction site diagonally across from the apartment as well as the hum from the factory. We needed to keep the windows/door open because of the heat so had to buy earplugs which easily blocked out the sound for sleeping. 

Jen is a great communicator and accommodated our early lunchtime check in even though work was busy.  "
5422159,38260892,2015-07-14,30846523,Nick,"The apartment is in a great location; walking distance to anywhere in Seattle you want to go. It is modestly furnished but lacking nothing we needed during out 4 night stay. Jen had a friend meet us to check in whom, although a little late, was very nice and helpful. At times she was hard to get a hold of, but she explained she was traveling and had limited access to internet. I would recommend this place to all."
5422159,38472169,2015-07-15,38464234,Matthew,"Jen was kind enough to book us on short notice. Her place was in a good location quick walks to all Seattle attractions. Jen's communication could be better. She initially said she would try to get us in early but if she was unable we would have to meet around 5 to 6 to check in. We didn't hear back from her until I emailed her around 4 to confirm a time to meet. She had her friend meet us at 6:00, though late, was very courtiuos and helpful. He did warn us that the place had not been cleaned. We soon discovered he was correct. There were dried cereal, milk and sunflower seeds in the apartment and bacony which made it hard to swallow the 60 cleaning fee that we were charged. We texted Jen and let her know the condition of the apartment to which we recived  a response. "
5422159,38987303,2015-07-20,27206317,Julie,"Jen was not available to meet us personally but she arranged for her neighbor to meet us.  He was there to meet us within minutes of our arrival even though we were delayed and it was close to midnight.  The apartment is beautiful!  And really absolutely perfectly located.  Plush towels in the bathroom, comfortable bed and pillows, soft sheets. Spacious, pretty, nice living room.  Very roomy for a studio apartment.  We loved the courtyard right down the hall and the easy access to either Western Ave. or 1st Ave.  Just a very short walk to Pikes Market.  This is a very nice apartment in a very nice location.  The only downside?  It was in the 90s the weekend we were there and no AC.  OK, I understand that no one in Seattle has AC but not even a fan.  It was a bit hot and uncomfortable sleeping a couple of nights.  A fan, even a table top fan, would have helped greatly.  That said, I would definitely stay here again.  The hot nights were a small price to pay for such a sweet place in such a nice location.  "
5422159,39505153,2015-07-24,16789725,Bradford,This was a perfect place for business travelers. Very low maintenance and perfectly located at a reasonable rate. Jen and her friend who came to let me in initially were very helpful and communicative. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. 
5422159,39738855,2015-07-26,30245804,Aaron,"Jen was a great host. While we didn't actually meet, we kept in contact through messages and she was always prompt in replying. We met her associate who checked us in and showed us around. The place was clean and organized. Cable tv, and wifi were provided and we did watch a little Netflix before bed. The studio is just a block from the waterfront and a couple from Pikes Market. We didn't actually stay in the studio very much because we were hitting the town. By the second night we had walked around Seattle so much that the hotub was awesome. We even met some visiting Blue Jays fans in the pool area. All in all we really enjoyed our time. Thanks Jen."
5422159,40311219,2015-07-30,30415410,MaryAnna,"Location, location, location!   This apartment is in a prime spot to easily access Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, the waterfront,and downtown Seattle. Jen was super accommodating in letting us check in early!  The apartment was very nice. One suggestion I would make is to have a fan in the apartment. It was quite warm on the days we were there, so a fan would have been helpful. We will definitely rent this apartment again if given the opportunity! Thanks Jen!!!"
5422159,40540777,2015-07-31,27697451,Casey,Great location! Close to Pike's Place and the harbor.
5422159,40719514,2015-08-02,4430096,Stephen,"This apartment has a great location in downtown Seattle. The apartment is spacious (love the high ceilings), clean, and Jen was a fantastic host.

It's a great deal for Seattle, and the location couldn't be better!"
5422159,41731447,2015-08-09,28580599,Alexandre,"The listing was very accurate. The appartment was clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was great. Jen was very hard to reach just a few days before our arrival, which was quite stressful. Apart from the communication problems, everything was fine."
5422159,42516831,2015-08-14,30547398,Kyle,"Great location in downtown Seattle. Easily accessible from the airport via the Link light rail (station is one block from the property). No need to rent a car if you're going to be sight seeing in Seattle. Easy walk to ferry access to Bainbridge Island.
Spacious room for a studio apartment....everything seemed new/updated.
There was no air conditioning, which usually wouldn't be a problem, but it was unseasonably warm during our stay there. There is an ongoing construction project across the street that added some noise in the morning, but it was a quiet place at night.  "
5422159,43047420,2015-08-17,9430580,Christina,"We really enjoyed staying at Jen's apartment in Seattle. It was clean, comfortable, and conveniently located in a popular Seattle neighborhood. The wireless internet works well and there are lots of useful amenities like hair dryer, iron, dishware, coffee maker, etc."
5422159,43911197,2015-08-23,25054315,Philip,"The location is great for many of the tourist attractions in Seattle. It is a clean, modern studio Appartment. "
5422159,44592943,2015-08-27,10042488,Wyatt,Had a great stay in Jen's downtown apartment. She was a responsive host and the place was clean and comfortable.
5422159,45657053,2015-09-05,28720279,Denise,Great apartment and location.  A few minor issues which i have raised with Jen but nothing that would stop me recommending it.  Arrangements are a bit confusing though.  Itinerary shows one address then got changed to another then met be someone else and taken across the street.  Get clarification of correct address when you book.
5422159,45992982,2015-09-07,20367576,Christine,"Our stay at Jen's apartment in Seattle was great! It was very close to the Seattle waterfront and a short walk to the Public Market. The apartment was in a nice building and was very clean. The bed was a little uncomfortable...it dipped in the middle a bit, but we only stayed for two nights so it was fine. There was a small view of the waterfront from the patio which was a nice little surprise. Parking was a big concern for us when planning our trip. There was a parking garage attached to the building, but it was pretty pricey. Street parking was free on Sundays, but it was very difficult to find a spot and the majority of spots have a 2 hour max. Jen was great at responding to all of my inquiries. Her friend Kelly checked us in and made us feel comfortable with the check in process. This is definitely a great rental for someone without a car!  "
5422159,46746842,2015-09-13,40943570,Stephanie,Great location. Excellent host. Clean apartment. Recommend taking shuttle link from airport.
5422159,47717620,2015-09-21,41273041,Carol,"The apartment is in a great location, close to the Pike Place and the downtown area. It is spacious, comfortably furnished and clean. We had some difficulty contacting Jen on the day of our arrival to meet at the apartment and get the key, but eventually her friend met us. "
5422159,48156449,2015-09-23,325551,Aarti,I want to come back!
5422159,48422442,2015-09-26,41582758,Julianne,"This place is in a fantastic location! I took the light rail from the airport and it was about a block away form the train stop. Jen is easy to get in contact with. Her friend Kelly met me with the keys and showed me around the unit. The building felt very secure and location safe. I was traveling by myself so this was an important factor. The street the building was on was actually pretty calm which was nice. 

I walked everywhere. The only time I ever got into another form of transportation was using an Uber to get back to the airport. I would have taken the light rail again, but my flight was crazy early in the morning and the light rail wasn't an option. 

There is no AC in the unit. This isn't a problem and I 100% knew that going in, but my spoiled, Florida, central air loving self thought it was worth a mention. There is a small fan provided, but I know that Seattle had a much warmer summer than normal and it might be something to consider. Or not. Honestly, I spent so much time exploring the city that it really didn't matter. The apartment is spacious and clean and had everything I needed. 

I'll say it again, this apartment is in an absolutely fantastic location and I would definitely stay here again if I ever find myself back in Seattle. "
5422159,49208004,2015-10-02,21158589,Wimjoost,I stayed in the apartment alone for one week during a conference in the Washington State Conference Center. It felt like home richt away. Everything you need is there. A comfortabel bed. A bit noisy because of All the building activity around. The situation is perfect. I loved the Harbour Steps to start with. Free morning fitness!
5422159,49832025,2015-10-06,7858520,Emily,This place was extremely comfortable and convenient to many parts of Seattle!  Arrival was smooth and access to the apt. was easy.  Very clean and accommodating :)
5422159,50963545,2015-10-16,38566200,Chelsea,"I didn't speak with Jen in person but her friend Moss helped me in the building - it is exactly as advertised, right downtown really close to the waterfront and within walking distance to a lot of bars/shops/restaurants. The bed was very comfortable and Jen was very hospitable with the toiletries she provided in the bathroom and local beer in the fridge!

The only thing I was confused about was the actual apartment is not where it listed on this page - but it's only about a 5 minute walk away. Maybe this is for privacy reasons?

Regardless, I would recommend this place to stay if you want to check out downtown Seattle!"
5422159,51748412,2015-10-24,2356845,Frank,"This is the second time that I’ve stayed in Jen’s Harbor Steps studio flat and recommend it highly for its central location, amenities and, in particular, its value versus a hotel.  The photos and description are accurate.  In fact, improvements since my last stay include a nice rug and patio furniture.  Wi-Fi is fast, reliable and password secured.  

Shops and restaurants are just outside the door.  The Seattle Art Museum is across the street.  Pike Place and the monorail to the Space Needle and Seattle Center are a few minutes’ walk.  I stayed for a week this time and enjoyed it thoroughly.  We did have a communication kerfuffle that delayed my check-in, an inconvenience that Jen sorted it out properly in the end."
5422159,52428217,2015-10-29,4921403,Anders,"The commutation from Jen was perfect, with the check in process being extremely easy. Her friend Moss, who is extremely friendly, showed me around the place and was right on time with the key exchange.

The pictures do not do the apartment justice, it is perfectly clean, honestly appearing that nobody has ever lived here before! Very comfortable bed, huge space, so it does not seem like a studio at all.  The place was literally perfect and I will definitely be staying here again ASAP. 

Building is very secure and has multiple  24 hour gyms and general hang out areas....again, above and beyond what I expected.

Best place in Seattle!!!"
5422159,53507064,2015-11-09,24277309,Walter,I would recommend staying in this apartment if you are looking for convenience.  Major attractions are within walking distance and also stores like target if you need some necesities are close by.  The apartment was clean and well maintained.  Perfect place to enjoy your stay in Seattle
5422159,54170739,2015-11-16,47990671,Vlad,"Jen has a great place, located right next to Pike Place Market. Walking distance to everything (website hidden), WiFi, better than staying at a hotel!
Jen was very helpful and quick to respond to my messages, I would definitely stay there again if I come back to Seattle."

2933877,16319164,2014-07-25,17929237,Albert,We met up with the host easily and they were able to provide us with a tour and explained how everything worked. The apartment was easy to find and located in a convenient location. We easily walked around to Pike Place Market and restaurants in the area. The apartment had all the basic necessities and felt cozy.  
2933877,17880863,2014-08-18,11022075,Matt,"Thank you for an amazing stay!  Everything was great, we couldn't have asked for more.  You definitely made our trip to Seattle a great one."
2933877,18874448,2014-09-02,15603512,Chris,"Place is exactly as advertised, clean, and right across the street from the convention centre.  Doug greeted me on time and gave me a good overview of the place.  I ran into him several times during my stay as he was fixing, cleaning, and welcoming new guests to the other suits he manages.  Always very friendly.

The portable AC unit had trouble keeping the place cool during the unusually hot days at beginning of my stay but once the temperatures returned to normal I didn't need the AC unit.

Kitchen had all the cooking utensils I needed.  Never heard any noise from the neighbours.  The neighbours where so quiet I was worried I was being too loud.  You can hear the freeway and other downtown noises but I only noticed it because I come from a much smaller city then Seattle.

Overall a very nice place and I would stay there again."
2933877,27920478,2015-03-15,24479530,Samantha,"Apartment was exactly as described, within walking distance of just about everything I needed and adequately furnished/equipped with kitchen needs. I fell in love with Seattle on this trip and it was a great little apartment to come home to at the end of each fun-filled day. "
2933877,34156123,2015-06-05,33804851,Floor,Great place to stay for a business trip. The place was clean and quite. Doug did an awesome job in getting me settled in. 
2933877,34635293,2015-06-10,31420313,Arlener,"The hosts were very accommodating to my needs.  My flight did not get in until 11:15 so I wasn't able to get to the apartment until a little after midnight and even at that hour I was greeted with enthusiasm and given a great overview of where anything I might need was located.  I appreciate that Doug went above and beyond and let me know where the nearest stores were with an emphasis on what was still open.  I immediately felt welcome!  In fact the neighborhood in itself also seemed welcoming and just really nice and comfortable, which was a really good thing since I had to walk everywhere.  I also greatly appreciate being able to extend my checkout time by a couple hours due to an unforeseen circumstances.  Everyone that I dealt with for this stay was extremely pleasant and easy to work with making this experience a great one.   Overall, this was a great stay and I would recommend them to anyone.    "
2933877,35458769,2015-06-19,20668429,Roxanne,"This was a great little condo in a great location.  Close to convention center and Capitol Hill neighborhood.  Friendly residents, too! We were met promptly, given a quick overview, and we were set! Everything was very convenient.  Highly recommend! "
2933877,51011355,2015-10-17,37084948,Maria,"Great experience. Rebecca was always prompt to respond to inquiries. Doug was helpful and friendly at check in, and also quick to respond to questions about the property. The studio itself was very comfortable, well stocked, and the location was excellent. I had a wonderful stay and would love to stay there again if I was in the area."
2761092,40023923,2015-07-27,19786493,Kristin,"Amy's space was absolutely charming. My sister and her girls stayed here, and Amy made sure they felt right at home. The pictures do not do justice to what a cute home this is. I will definitely rent from her again the next time I have guests in town."
2761092,40378868,2015-07-30,23589429,Lauren,A friend and I rented Amy's place during a roadtrip up to Seattle. Amy was marvelous! She was very hospitable and even kept an eye out for a FedEx package that we ended up needing to mail at the last minute. She was great at staying in communication and answering any questions! She provided a list of things for my friend and I to see during our stay. Would definitely stay here again! 
2761092,41009494,2015-08-03,39341161,Dawn,"My sister, son and I stayed at Amys for one night. We loved the comfortable atmosphere she has created in her home and would definitely stay here again. Everything we needed was provided and the place was very clean and comfortable. Much nicer than staying in a hotel."
2761092,41822417,2015-08-09,38772385,Robert,"Amy was an outstanding host, she made sure we always had what we needed and was able to help us when we needed an iron which was a huge relief. She also had a very organized and clean house with sticky notes all over that helped us with random, but necessary, facts or tidbits. She responds to any text within the hour or right away. I am very pleased I was able to stay here and would recommend anyone to stay with her. Thank you Amy"
2761092,42443099,2015-08-13,29821253,Oscar,"We felt we had everything we needed for our trip. Admittedly we came to check out the local nightlife and we were not disappointed. She gave us a list of local pubs and eateries which we enjoyed. This next thing may seem trivial, but she also provided us with purified water. It was the little things that made this place great. Thanks Amy!"
2761092,42610804,2015-08-14,25230985,Max,"Not too bad! Rental car was great to have, we were in downtown Seattle in no time. The space was cozy and modest, but without a proper kitchen or laundry. Amy, however, was more than happy to open the separating door and let us use those amenities, and invited us to eat the Indian food she had just brought back from a catering job. The main drag that the house is located on is quite noisy, but Amy left us some earplugs to accommodate for that. She also set us up for breakfast, coffee, and a nice shower. The space had everything we needed."
2761092,42905276,2015-08-16,8823219,Jason,The place was clean and well stocked. Loved the quirky charm and great location. Amy was great to interact with. Would definitely stay again.
2761092,43277638,2015-08-18,16003437,Cassie,"Amy is a sweetheart, very accommodating and available if anything requires attention or if you have any questions. The house is adorable with a lot of character and a fun, artsy feel (you can tell a lot of thought and creativity went into the decor). Fantastic location, will absolutely use again!"
2761092,43703070,2015-08-21,41307613,Raymond,"Amy was a fantastic host.
Appertment is very unique. 
Everything was perfect"

2761092,46677457,2015-09-12,12715027,Maggie,The host is helpful overall. Home decoration is decent and delicate. The only thing is the location as it is right next to busy traffic. It is a bit noisy at night. It would be better also if kitchen can be opened up to use. 
2761092,46945070,2015-09-14,40893223,Jerry,Amy and husband were very nice. Place was very clean and comfortable. Convenient location to freeway and nice neighborhood.  Would definitely stay here again. Everything we needed and more.
2761092,47398825,2015-09-18,19197049,호철,it was so perfect to stay durng our trip so that it was very convenient to go airport. the house is very confortable for us to stay and it was very clean.
2761092,48571918,2015-09-27,41206121,Sheena,It was an amazing place to stay. Love the corky decor:) Beautiful view of mountains! Great location to catch the bus for downtown. Can't wait to visit again
2761092,49469725,2015-10-04,5180658,Michelle,"Amy and Eric were wonderful.  They made it easy to find the house with emails and texts.  And they had everything organized so we didn't have to wonder what light switch turned on what (as it is an old home and they are quirky LOL).  House rules were clear and concise. Everything was as described, so there were no surprises!
The beds were comfortable and so were the pillows. :)  And we loved the little lights in the rooms and outdoors.
They made us feel very welcome and even had popcorn and breakfast bars available for us.  What a great experience to stay in this home.
We loved staying at this home and would do so again!  One of my favorite places to stay in this area."
2761092,50334987,2015-10-11,35098688,Callie,"Amy's house was very clean and cozy. She put a lot of thought into making sure I had everything I needed. There were snacks, tea, coffee, cocoa, ear plugs, and notes everywhere making sure I understood the little quirks of her house. She provided restaurant recommendations that I was able to use during my stay. Her space was large, and I am glad I stayed here."
2761092,51825327,2015-10-24,18269204,Johanna,"We had a wander full stay. So many thoughtful touches, like tea and essential oils! Kind helpful hosts. Good location in a walkable neighborhood. Beautiful space. I miss it already!"
2761092,56950776,2015-12-20,38441149,Jason,"We had a wonderful experience ! Amy made us feel so welcome, the home is very comfortable and full of character. 
We would definitely recommended Amy's home to anyone looking to stay in Seattle !
Thank you for everything, you and your home are amazing !"
2526405,11166294,2014-03-23,10843588,Sara,"Soaking up the sunshine in Chris's beautiful little room was just what we needed to recharge. All of the good design was a delight. There were wonderful books, warm blankets...not that we needed them. It was a lucky spring day that we got to have the window open! Sunny. Simple. Quiet. I'd recommend this to any of my friends. Thanks Chris! "
2526405,11334308,2014-03-30,13210121,Annette,"Great! We had the whole upstairs, it was in a great neighborhood, and there was a sweet binder full of information and fun things to do. Recommended! Only personal issue was the non-intuitive shower heat control. "
2526405,11786068,2014-04-14,14134185,Kenny,"Clean room, beautiful house, can't beat the location. Seriously my favorite part of Capitol Hill, everything is walkable. Chris was very accommodating. The dogs are super friendly. All around great place!"
2526405,12353785,2014-04-29,5222424,Jaroslav,Very nice and clean place. Great location for trips to downtown or around Capitol Hill. Highly recommended!
2526405,12388851,2014-04-30,4001362,Clare,"I give it 10 stars out of 5 (can we do that??)! What a fabulous stay we had here. Chris got back to us within minutes after we requested a last minute stay. Their neighborhood is lovely and there is tons within walking distance. The bed was comfy, the towels were fluffy, and their space was clean and welcoming. We had the pleasure of sitting and sharing some wine with them at their table when we arrived...one glass of wine hopefully was the beginning of a fantastic friendship. Cheers to these two! I definitely recommend their place :)"
2526405,12853540,2014-05-12,7193247,Claire,"Chris was a friendly, interesting host and the apartment was an ideal base for our week's stay in Seattle. We really loved the decor of the house, and the downstairs kitchen area was really spacious - we cooked in quite a lot. Recommendations for the Capitol Hill area and beyond were also on point. All in all, a top notch rental. "
2526405,12960572,2014-05-15,9619750,Sebastian,"It is a very clean and nice place, great to meet seattle, close to restaurants and bars, Chris is a great host. recommended !!!

Lugar limpio y agradable, genial para conocer seattle, cercano a restaurantes y bares, Chris es un gran anfitrion. totalme recomendable"
2526405,13157029,2014-05-20,1546246,Denis And Anthonia,"What a gorgeous house in Seattle's nicest neighbourhood! Chris went the extra mile to make us feel at home - he's an expert AirBNBer. We felt like we had plenty of privacy in our room and, as the listing says, so much sunlight. Also - for people who have high bathroom demands - theirs is gorgeous!!"
2526405,13478707,2014-05-28,3579623,Lucas,"We had a great stay with Chris and his housemates and would happily recommend their place to anybody. They're place is clean and comfortable and everybody made us feel welcome and gave us our privacy. Our room was bright and had plenty of room to hang jackets/clothing, so we didn't feel like we were living out of a suitcase. They included a recommendations kit in the room, but were also happy to offer advice in person. I also found Capitol Hill totally charming and the house is better situated in the neighbourhood than it might first appear (i.e. it's close to Volunteer Park and some good restaurants etc. on 15th and 19th. Plus the #10 Bus is right there, which takes you directly downtown."
2526405,13628253,2014-06-01,15529607,Sarah,"My sister and I stayed with Chris and Carly for a few days and we had a great time! The space is perfect; clean, comfortable, welcoming (there was chocolate and wine!) and the hosts were super friendly. 

The neighborhood is great and there are lots of great restaurants and spots to see. If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle just stop now and pick this one! "
2526405,13799907,2014-06-04,11772910,Aron,You can't go wrong if you decide to stay by chris! It's a nice neighborhood and everything is within a walkable distance. I got all the privecy that I need and had enough space just for me.
2526405,14892080,2014-06-28,3837736,Danielle,"I was very impressed with the private room and space within the home in the Capital Hill neighborhood of Seattle.  It was in an excellent location, just off of the main street and easy access to other parts of the city. 
As a host, Chris and Carly were perfect - very nice and pleasant and a wonderful guest gift of wine and chocolate when I arrived.  The room was very clean and organized as well as other parts of the shared living quarters. 
I would highly recommend this space to anyone looking to stay in Capital Hill or the Seattle area!


"
2526405,15041372,2014-07-01,506464,Mina,"Chris was very accommodating and nice. He answered any questions we had and was a very fun person to talk to. Their place is 2 blocks away from 15th ave, and all it's cool restaurants! we loved just walking out the door and going to bars and restaurants! You can also walk to the Volunteer park which is nice, and it's also not too far of a walk to Downtown and space needle either. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
Our only little complain was the bed wasn't super comfortable and it didn't have a headboard, so reading or looking laptop in the bed was kind of hard. If you are young and wouldn't mind that, this is the perfect place to stay, for older people with back problems it can be a little issue. "
2526405,15335404,2014-07-07,16399020,Bryan,Chris's home was wonderful. This is a quiet retreat that is very close to everything worth doing in Seattle. The hosts were also very welcoming and friendly. I would stay with Chris again.
2526405,15592411,2014-07-12,11273977,Amanda,Great place in great neighborhood. Lots of restaurants/coffee shops 2-3 blocks away but house itself is on quiet street.  Short bus ride to downtown.  Room had everything you needed. Chris was so helpful in telling us about the different neighborhoods of seattle. And everyone in the house is very friendly.   Thanks Chris and Carly!  We had a great stay! 
2526405,15892413,2014-07-17,8038334,Stephanie,"This is a great quiet space that is spotless and thoughtfully laid out. I had an interview and needed a lot of quiet time, and this was a great place to be for a short stay, and Chris is kind and prompt."
2526405,16066788,2014-07-21,11693747,Mónica,"We spend four amazing days in Seattle! Chris was a really nice host! The house was cozy with a garden, the room was as expected, big, lot of light and very clean! The bathroom was brilliant! There was a lot of information in our room about Seattle and very good recomendations about restaurants! The location of the house was perfect!!   and the flatmates were really nice aswell with us and helpfull!!! We recomended this house to everyone!!! "
2526405,16227720,2014-07-23,18015382,Jared,Nice place in a great location.  Ada's Technical Books and Cafe is a can't-miss local business.
2526405,16553122,2014-07-29,16016359,Brittney,"Stayed at Chris's  during Capitol Hill Block Party Weekend and had the place to ourselves! First time using airbnb and found it so much more welcoming than a hotel or resort. Loved how close everything was, walked the whole time we were there! Great location, great people!"
2526405,16696525,2014-07-31,19010307,Tia,"Chris is the bomb digs, his style was on point. He was very nice and helpful and we enjoyed staying here as it made our first airbnb experience a pleasant one. "
2526405,17279206,2014-08-10,10730782,Carmiel,"Chris was so kind and accommodating. I had booked his place for my coworker, who could not use stairs for health reasons, it turned out. I took her place and Chris switched the sheets and towels for me, making sure everything was like new. He and his girlfriend are very amiable, warm, and available, and they seem to easily read if a guest wants space/privacy or conversation. The shared bathroom was never an issue. It was great for an extended stay and would be equally easy and fun for a short trip. Thanks!"
2526405,17945423,2014-08-19,16617670,Jane,"Chris emailed me ahead of time with detailed info about how to get into the house, names of housemates I might meet, what I could help myself to in the kitchen, etc.  The house is in a great location with lots of fun places within walking distance, including a beautiful park; there's a book of information about local restaurants, things to do ,maps, etc, with a list of his favorites (which were great).
The room is clean and bright and the bathroom and common room comfortable as well.  There's a nice sense of order in the house, but in a relaxed way.  My husband and I felt very welcomed by Chris and his housemates, but also totally free to come and go as we pleased.  
It was helpful to have a parking space available."
2526405,18329645,2014-08-25,15046238,Michael,"Excellent host. It felt safe to walk in the neighborhood with my 9-year-old child. Lots of restaurants available in a short walking distance. The room is nice -- it has hardwood floors, a bed and a desk. The window provided nice light & fresh air during our weeklong stay at the end of the Summer. The host provided clean towels for our use, which was an unexpected bonus."
2526405,18555650,2014-08-28,19002837,Jason,"Chris was very responsive, gave us great instructions before arriving and provided us with a binder of things to do/see in the area when we arrived. The place is walking distance to the bus line and there was a parking spot available for our use. The room is very bright and clean, along with the bathroom. We we're barely there during the day and used the room primarily for showering and sleeping. We we're free to come and go as we pleased, and had full use of the bathroom (we made time slots in the morning which was very flexible). I would recommend this place if you need a place to sleep/shower. "
2526405,18877657,2014-09-02,2477333,Nandana,"This was definitely one of my top AirBnB experiences! The location really can't be beat -- its in a beautiful well-connected neighborhood with great cafes and restaurants right around the corner. The space itself was spotless and so thoughtfully designed. Loved the rack to hang clothes, the folder with Seattle recommendations (we used many!) and the bottles (plus glasses) for water and wine. Sharing the bathroom was no problem at all -- especially because it was always so clean. Oh and communication with both Chris and Carly was a breeze. Highly recommended! "
2526405,19049514,2014-09-05,20523702,Gabe,"The house was in a great neighborhood and the room was excellent. Definitely a better feel than the hotels I had been using on business. Chris was really helpful in the run-up to my stay, and he and Carley thoughtfully provided a list of bars and restaurants in the area. Truthfully, it seems like it would be hard to go wrong in this area though. 
The amenities are excellent--the room and bathroom are well appointed and there is a small sitting room to enjoy some of the books provided. Friendly pooch downstairs greeted me when I came in and gave a nice feel to the whole place. Would definitely stay again. "
2526405,19142992,2014-09-07,1841334,Soon,We stayed at Chris's place when we were at Seattle last weekend. The room  (rest of house as well) is very spacious and clean. Chris and his girlfriend are welcoming in an unobtrusive. The neighbourhood is fabulous and we left our hearts at Ada's Technical Books (an amazing coffee shop). And walking distant to many great eateries. We did not have much time to connect with the host. We will definitely stay here again on future trips. 
2526405,19296949,2014-09-09,19990076,Sue,"This is a wonderful bedroom. It is very open and airy. The bathroom is especially nice. The hosts left a notebook with a map and menus along with instructions. There was also water, wine, and a chocolate bar in the room. They are very well organized. The emails I received wee very helpful, too."
2526405,19398452,2014-09-11,6009092,Kankshit,"Chris is a great host. Given that I was looking for a place last minute, he was very responsive and made the process effortless. The room I stayed in was very clean and organized. Before I checked in, Chris sent a detailed welcome email with all instructions and much needed information. Their home is very beautiful and artistic. The neighborhood is a few minutes drive / cab ride from Central captiol hill... which made my life very easy. They have a binder in the room with all information someone new to Seattle would need. The food recommendation was spot on! Overall, I would definitely come back to stay with Chris! "
2526405,19625472,2014-09-15,19639471,Tim,"Staying with Chris and Carly was awesome! Great and kind host! Made 
Us feel right at home, but gave us plenty of privacy.
Great location! Centrally located to everything. Shops and restaurants
Nearby. Other sights and attractions 
Just a short bus or ferry ride to some fun attractions. Thanks Chris and Carly for making our trip one to remember. "
2526405,20150540,2014-09-24,8977520,Maribel,Chris and Carly were wonderful hosts. Their home was located in a beautiful part of Seattle and many great local places to eat. Their home was very clean and we felt very comfortable staying there. 
2526405,20349513,2014-09-28,8803508,Jarrad,"Great stay! Chris was kind and completely low-key, and the room was comfortable and cozy (with loads of natural sunlight). Host communicated well pre-trip and offered lots of great information about the city in the room. Would absolutely stay with Chris next time I'm in Seattle."
2526405,20542718,2014-09-30,262972,Sarah,"We stayed at Chris' place for 2 nights. The house was very cute near everything we wanted to explore on Capitol Hill. The house has great style and lovely treats. The bed was comfortable. We would stay here again anytime. 
"
2526405,20656924,2014-10-03,3521359,Jennifer,"Chris's flat is located in a great area. Easy access to bars, restaurants, etc. in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, which we loved. Parking in the area (and pretty much everywhere) is tricky, so the off-street parking available here is awesome. If you're just looking for a room to stay in while you're in town, this is it. Although we didn't really cross paths that often during our stay, Chris and Carly were super-friendly. They had a couple of friends over one evening and we had a nice time chatting with them. It is a bright room with loads of natural light, so it's good for early risers."
2526405,20793495,2014-10-05,3031883,Elaine,"The space: very well decorated room that was spacious and bright.  Loved the morning sun coming through the windows.  The hosts provided some toiletries and a bottle of wine as well.  The shared bathroom is small and definitely shows signs of use (shared with the two other tenants), but perfectly adequate.  As a space in and of itself, we were very happy staying here.

However, I hate to say that my boyfriend and I are disappointed in our experience with the hosts!  We have been using Airbnb for several years and the part we enjoy the most is interacting with our hosts.  While we appreciate having space, we also find it invaluable to talk to hosts who are locals!  In this case, Chris and his girlfriend provided a binder with some restaurant and other tourist suggestions, but the only time we talked to them was when we checked in.  When we arrived, they pretty much immediately retreated to their side of the apartment and were non-existent the rest of the time.  So sadly, my boyfriend and I felt a little unwelcome in Chris' apartment which is not a great feeling when sharing an apartment/bathroom.  "
2526405,21146441,2014-10-12,165690,Chirag,This was an awesome place to stay in Seattle. Incredibly centrally located and Chris is a great host! 
2526405,21283916,2014-10-14,16776702,Rina,"Location: Capitol Hill is a wonderful place in Seattle downtown. Of course, there are lots of good taste restaurants, bar, and cafes. Especially, there has beautiful townscape so I really enjoy walking around the neighborhood. I think Seattle is very safe and calm city in the United States.

Room: House is so clean and so cozy. I really impressed about their art collections, fanitures, and daily tools. All of them are in good taste! The bathroom is located same floor that also clean.

Host: Chris and Carly are very kindly. Chris prepared for welcome wine and water! It's so amazing! I was moved that. I'd like to see them again next time. "
2526405,21395635,2014-10-16,4853490,Desiree,"We had a great time at Chris' place. We had some problems getting into the apartment but Chris helped us within minutes. He and his roommates are very friendly, although we didn't see each other very often. He has the cutest dogs by the way. The room is as described, the bathroom, especially the shower, is awesome. Everything is very clean and we were greeted with a bottle of wine, chocolate and water. The location of this place is awesome. We walked downtown and you have to try out the restaurant recommendations - they are to die for!"
2526405,21527532,2014-10-19,21184814,Corinna,"I would highly recommend this place for travelers that want to see Seattle without having to get a headache driving & parking in traffic. My boyfriend and I stayed for a weekend and had a great time. The place is very clean, modern and cozy. Chris left the sweetest little touches in the room to make us feel welcome, a glass jug of water with water glasses, a bottle of wine & wine glasses & even a nice bar of chocolate. We had privacy for entrance & exit. There's a place to park your car & it's only a 40 minute walk to Pikes Place. We left our car at the house and just walked to our tourist destinations and it was perfect. The neighborhood is beautiful, family oriented and conveniently close to many great restaurants & bars. "
2526405,21913738,2014-10-26,21486515,Elena,"Although Chris wasn't in town we had a lovely stay! The room is cozy and bright; the bed is comfy. The house is really centrally located to great restraunts and bars on Capitol Hill, and to downtown if you don't mind a bit of walk. Chris has also compiled a super helpful binder of menus,  maps, etc. We didn't take advantage of the coffee, tea, or breakfast that is provided but I can only imagine it's nice as well. However, we did take advantage of the really nice bottle of wine that was left for us. The other housemates are also very nice; the dogs are cute and sweet too! We felt very welcomed the entire time. Thanks to everyone for our great experience!"
2526405,22250991,2014-11-02,12040495,John,"Cheerful, easygoing, hospitality was the hallmark of  my stay of close to week. My room was larger and more inviting than expected from the humble photos—the window offering natural light and a pleasant view of nearby trees and houses. The shared bath and kitchen were well above the airbnb average in terms of taste, cleanliness, spaciousness, and comfort. Privacy was carefully defined, while at the same time the hosts were accessible and friendly. I cannot think of any improvements to suggest, to be honest.  I very much hope that Chris's airbnb room will be available the next time I plan a visit to Seattle. "
2526405,22380675,2014-11-04,12040495,John,"The room and the house were such a fine fit with my needs that I added these two days onto my stay—for about a week total. So technically this is my second stay. Chris is exceptionally well organized and helpful in the check in and check out. The room was perfectly clean, bright, recently painted, with a comfy bed. I found the kitchen is, like the room, spacious — I was always happy to return to the house after a day of work. 
"
2526405,22846055,2014-11-16,22829491,Margarita,"Chris is an amazing host, my friend and I felt welcomed at his house. The place is nice and clean in a good area. His roommates are sweet as well!

Thank you guys!"
2526405,23401611,2014-11-30,23349455,Marieke,"The description of the room was very accurate. I didn't get to meet Chris and Carly as they were not at home, but they gave me perfect instructions on how to get into the house and room and left a binder with some useful info on the area.
Bottles of water and wine were a very nice touch and very welcoming too :)"
2526405,23496028,2014-12-02,11688525,Jennifer,"Nice interesting folks, clean comfortable room.  Very convenient location.  Especially appreciated the great reading-in-bed light -- in fact, the only really good one we've encountered in a number of AirBNBs.

"
2526405,24161421,2014-12-21,4742266,Alysha,"Chris was a friendly, very communicative host! He emailed me ahead of time with very detailed instructions on how to get into the house. The room, bathroom, and common spaces were very clean (AND the bathroom has heated tiles and a really good shower)and Chris and his housemates were lovely people, and the dogs were so sweet! Staying in Capitol Hill is definitely the way to go if you're staying in Seattle, and this is absolutely a great place to crash in CH! "
2526405,24534585,2014-12-30,10874991,Camille,"Chris and Carly were such great hosts for our stay! We came from Houston and didn't know much of Seattle, but their location is superb. They're maybe 4 blocks from a bike kiosk, and just a short 15 minute ride away from Pike Place Market. Even though Chris and Carly weren't around much, they always answered my texts almost immediately with any questions I may have. The room was quite wonderful, and my boyfriend and I both had a great nights sleep there. They left us some very nice water, both sparkling and flat, and a really well thought out binder with some things to do and places to eat at in the neighborhood. We loved our time in Seattle and are so happy we could utilize Chris and Carly's great place. Thanks guys! "
2526405,24676872,2015-01-01,24881928,Belle,"Centrally located within Capitol Hill, easy walk to Capitol Hill's main street and not too far to walk downtown either, we just caught and cab or a bus back when needed. The room and apartment were nice and clean. Extremely cute dogs, and friendly hosts who we didn't see much of as it was only a brief stay."
2526405,25375150,2015-01-13,5178185,Joel,Chris was an amazing host ... very responsive and accomodating.  His place is exactly as advertised and the room was great.  I would not hesitate to stay with him again.
2526405,25615220,2015-01-20,25958060,Brenon,"Although Chris couldn't be there when we first arrived, he gave us detailed instructions on how to get into the house, which made it extremely easy. We were also greeted with a bottle of Pellegrino! The room was clean, spacious, and bright -- just as the listing stated. It is centrally located, and a short walk from many great bars and brunch spots. We had a rental car, but you can walk to Downtown and central Cap Hill if you want to get some miles in. I highly recommend staying with Chris and Carly!"
2526405,25782330,2015-01-25,21977658,Jeremiah,"Chris was a great host! He greeted us warmly as did his lovely dogs and friends. The house was perfect and just as described, although the parking was tight for my pickup, although we all made it work. And the shower?! Truly lovely!The bed was magnificent and I'm a pretty, pretty, pretty particular sleeper;) Any would enjoy a stay in this lovely abode! Thanks again, Chris!"
2526405,26764135,2015-02-18,251417,Carolin,"Chris and Carly are great hosts! They are friendly and communicative and made us feel very welcome. My husband and I stayed for 5 days and had an amazing time. Capitol Hill is a great neighbourhood and the house is ideally located - in walking distance to many good bars and restaurants. The room is very nicely furnished, clean and bright. We couldn't ask for more!"
2526405,27404079,2015-03-03,27451523,Yang,The house is prefect and neighborhood is nice. It's definitely the best host we met in USA. Chris is a conaiderated person. I will strongly recommend people choose the spot as Airbnb place in Seattle.
2526405,27624353,2015-03-08,2150714,Audrey,"The space was so excellent! Six out of five stars! One of the best airbnb experiences I've had to date. Adorable hosts, beautiful area, the most comfortable and welcoming room and facilities. I would enthusiastically recommend this spot for any visitor (fit two of us very comfortably) to Seattle. "
2526405,27898964,2015-03-14,27061750,Ava,Chris and Carly were wonderful hosts. They were very friendly (as were their two dogs). I highly recommend this location. Everything was clean and Chris' check-in information was clear.
2526405,28406101,2015-03-23,10489831,Stephanie,"The place was super comfortable and in the best neighborhood possible. Right next to a bunch of really nice coffee shops and places to eat, yet far from the city noise. 
Chris was great. Me and my boyfriend were out most of the time, so we only got to hang with him once, but he was always available to help making our stay better (even with our late check out). Molly, Lilah and Abby are a treat. 
It was a wonderful stay. I'd definitely do it again."
2526405,28651477,2015-03-28,26958936,Caitlin,"Chris and Carly were great hosts! They were super accommodating and even let us stay a day earlier than originally planned! My boyfriend and I stayed for 3 nights and had an amazing time. Capitol Hill is a great area and the house is in a beautiful location-walking distance to great bars, coffee shops and restaurants. The room/entire apartment looks exactly as advertised. We really enjoyed our time in Seattle and definitely recommend Chris' place!"
2526405,28902794,2015-03-31,11977364,Jackie,"Chris and Carly were great! Chris gave us delicious food recommendations when we got there- very nice guy. Speaking of which, It was VERY easy to get there from the airport on public transportation (via city link train and bus). Once at their place, we were able to walk everywhere! Excellent, central location with lots of great eats in the immediate area. There were several busses nearby- maybe 2 blocks- to help get you downtown if you don't want to hoof it. Their area was adorable! We loved strolling and looking at all the fancy houses nearby. The room itself was great- clean and simple with a window for fresh air. Nice shower with good pressure & hot water (just read the directions first! Ha) and oh, it had heated floors! Would HIGHLY recommend staying here to anyone. We had a great time."
2526405,29279302,2015-04-06,9236315,Oscar,"This room was perfect for our short stay in Seattle. It is a quiet and spacious room with great natural light and Chris was very friendly and hospitable. We got around by bus, which dropped us off down the street from the house. Overall a great experience. "
2526405,29850243,2015-04-13,5222424,Jaroslav,"Second time staying at Chris´ place and again it was perfect. Nice place and great location ... just watch your beer, Chris´ little dog is a drunkard :)"
2526405,30482149,2015-04-22,19066998,Anthony,"Chris and Carly were excellent hosts. Very quick and efficient with communication in the days leading up to my stay. Whenever I had questions, they answered quickly and kindly! The room itself was beautiful, big white and sunny with a desk to do some work and even had a bottle of sparkling and still water to quench my thirst!! The location couldn't be better- close enough to Downtown Seattle but far enough away in a residential neighborhood so that you really feel like you're getting the authentic Seattle experience. This house is easily accessible be transit and by walking from the downtown area! If you are looking for an AirBNB in Seattle I suggest you look no further. "
2526405,30622139,2015-04-25,26558923,Connie,"Chris and Carly were welcoming and kept to themselves during our stay. Their home is very lovely and accommodating. My friend and I stayed three nights there and found the location was perfect for what we needed since we were out experiencing Seattle during the day and just needed a place to sleep. The room was very clean, the bed was comfortable. The bathroom was shared, clean and had heated flooring which is great and had an awesome shower. There was also free back private parking which was a plus."
2526405,31244597,2015-05-03,2902631,Paul,We had a great time at Chris's place. It was very clean and comfortable. There is all you need to spend the best time in Seattle. If I come back I will definitely try to stay there again. Thanks a lot Chris!
2526405,31737529,2015-05-09,32113748,Joyce,"This was my first Airbnb stay, and I think that it went really well! Chris did a great job with communication prior to my stay. The description and instructions were clear and accurate. Everything was well-organized.  Our accomodations were clean. I loved the bright room, which was very comfortable. I slept well! Little touches like the bottles of water that Chris provided were nice to have after a day of sightseeing in Seattle. The location itself is very convenient to shopping/dining, and a quick ride to sites like Pike Place Market (traffic dependent). My boyfriend and I rented a car and the parking space right outside was extremely convenient. I would be happy to stay here again if I come back to Seattle!"
2526405,32277672,2015-05-16,9649288,Elizabeth,Host made me feel welcome. Listing accurate. Good job! 
2526405,32674579,2015-05-20,26804416,Holger,"We had a really cool time at Seattle. Thanks a lot Chris! Everything was well prepared, clean and  comfortable. Chris is a very nice guy and made our short stay in Seattle very pleasant. The house is in a nice, calm and safe neighborhood. Pubs and restaurants you find within a 5 min walk. Downtown you reach in 30 min. Also public traffic is nearby if you need it. We didn't."
2526405,32990260,2015-05-24,4312995,Monica,"Chris and Carly are very nice and welcoming. The location is fantastic. Restaurants, shopping, coffee everything is so close by. Very walkable and central so cabs are cheap an close if you want one. Had a great stay and would most def return. "

"
2526405,34225801,2015-06-06,30804269,Veronica,"We felt very welcome by Chris and Car. They are very chill but knew we could count on them if we needed some advice/suggestions/help. Their house is cool, comfortable, clean, located in a great neighborhood and had everything we needed for our four days in Seattle. The fact that parking is available is a plus in the neighborhood. We felt safe and would consider staying with Chris and Car again!"
2526405,35463663,2015-06-19,31628131,Michelle,"Chris and Carly were absolutely wonderful hosts. They happily answered all my questions and provided excellent neighborhood recommendations. The space was exactly as pictured, neat and clean. I plan to stay with them again for any future trips."
2526405,35927593,2015-06-23,21151474,David,Chris was a fantastic host. The room was as shown and the guide binder he provided was a great help. He even provided a few foodie magazines for my girlfriend! Chris and Carly were extremely hospitable and I would recommend to all others. Fun dogs too!
2526405,36221587,2015-06-26,3521713,Emily,"Chris was welcoming and kind. The room was light and comfortable, and the area vibrant. I feel lucky to have stayed there!"
2526405,36682134,2015-06-30,5080621,Izzy,"We had a great time in Chris's place in Capital Hill. Chris was very kind and was always willing to help us during our stay. The house and room are small but everything in the house is nicely arranged and decorated. From the food and separated bags for garbage, I could see Chris and other housemates are healthy and eco-friendly people. Chris provided some fruits and cereals for breakfast for us and that was great. The bed was queen size and was a little small for my tall boyfriend, but the mattress of the bed was great so we could sleep very well. The shower was a little tricky to use but it was great. There were some toiletries(body soap, moisture cream, razor, scrub,etc) for the guests in the room and that was great too. The neighborhoods are very quiet and very close to the main street that has many cafes and restaurants. I definitely recommend Chris's place for staying in Seattle, and I would love to come back there again."
2526405,37141219,2015-07-05,12040495,John,"Count me a thoroughly contented repeat visitor . Spacious room and an even more discuss kitchen, where I always feel welcome by Chris & Carly.

The location was in Capitol Hill area which has numerous restaurant and cafes which I love so much.  Chris and Carly are great hosts. They were very kind and tried to help everything make us comfortable. Even they gathered lots of information that we can use to travel the town in the room. Thanks Chris and Carly!"
2526405,39287581,2015-07-22,7368057,Ken,It was a pleasure to stay at Chris' place and he was very kind and accommodating. The location was also excellent: quiet but also very close to all the great shops and restaurants on 15th Ave. I would definitely like to come back again in the future. 
2526405,39616930,2015-07-25,8832975,Amy,"Chris and Carly are really welcoming and wonderful hosts! They provided a lot of info before we even arrived and answered all our questions about Seattle and surrounding areas when we got there. The room is comfortable, quiet, and clean, and had everything we needed. Their place is located in a great neighbourhood...tons of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, grocery stores, etc. all within walking distance (definitely check out Canon for cocktails and Oddfellows for breakfast or lunch). Nice walk into downtown, and easy to get across the bridges into Fremont and U District by bus. I would definitely recommend staying here!  "

They also put a memory foam top on the mattress for extra comfort. Although the bed is a full my partner and I had plenty of room and slept comfortably. They also provided complimentary toiletries and water for the guests to share. Chris was polite, accommodating and informative. He really made our first Airbnb experience a great one! "

Their place is spacious and sparking clean with a gorgeous bathroom, and is exactly like if not better than the photos. The night-time photos don't show how bright and gorgeous the rooms are in the day. I highly recommend them, and wouldn't hesitate for a moment to stay here again."

2526405,45936493,2015-09-07,9885582,Elisa,"I had a great stay at Chris' lovely home. For a shared space you have plenty of privacy and come and go as you please. The bedroom is extremely clean and comfortable. Chris even left a binder full of things to do in the neighborhood and all of Seattle. The location was close enough to great restaurants, bars and sights and far away enough where you can relax and nap in the quiet airy bedroom. I would definitely stay again! Also his two pups are adorable. Thanks for having us! "

The location is great too, in a safe neighborhood with plenty of restaurants within walking distance (thanks for your recommendations when we checked in!) and frequent public transportation (the 10 bus line). We especially appreciated the extras–toiletries, space heater, and binder with local maps and activities. Would highly recommend both Chris and this space."

If you're looking for a super easy place to stay for a few nights Chris and Carly's home is a sure fit! The interior was minimalistic, modern, and clean and the little touches like complimentary toiletries and a heated restroom floor sweetened the deal. This was our first BnB experience and I will definitely be recommending!"

8627921,50413832,2015-10-11,4343906,Yesica,"Staying at Linda and Peter's place was great!  My folks and I were their first guests, and Linda and Peter went out of their way to make sure we had a warm and welcome stay.  We were greeted warmly upon  our arrival and Linda did everything she could to make sure we had a good weekend - she prepared a list of dining spots in Columbia City for us to try, there were board games in the living room, and she even stocked the fridge with goodies in case we needed a snack!  The space itself is spacious, clean, and overall comfy.  I highly recommend Dahl House :) "
8627921,51841193,2015-10-24,23217059,Brett,"My fiancé and I stayed at Peter and Linda's for two nights and were very pleased with our stay. The Dahl's were very friendly and went out of their way to be accommodating. The home was very clean, cozy and comfortable! "
8627921,52433398,2015-10-29,35013047,Roxanne,"I was welcomed at the door with friendly smiles, and introduced to Linda's husband, Peter, and their adorable little white dog, Chance.  Chance is very quiet, by the way, and does not invade the Airbnb space at all.  Linda showed me to my rooms, which are spacious and comfortable, and oriented me to the coffee machine and fireplace, and asked if I thought the bed would be comfortable and warm enough with the blankets that were on it."
8627921,52768603,2015-11-01,2838076,Erin,"Our family of five had a wonderful two-day stay. The rental is in a quiet residential neighborhood but just a short drive from downtown. There were also plenty of parks and walking trails in the area (wish we had more time!) The mini-fridge and microwave were very convenient for quick meals, and for sleeping there was the main bed, a futon bed, and an available air mattress. Linda was super friendly and helpful, and we would not hesitate to stay here again the next time we are in Seattle."
8627921,53623126,2015-11-10,1552491,Elizabeth,"This was an absolutely perfect place for us.  Linda and Peter provided everything we needed and more.

430610,1980521,2012-08-14,2350223,Eric,Great house in one of the better parts of Seattle. Seth was terrific to work with. We would stay here again. 
430610,2038805,2012-08-20,1934087,Angela,"Wonderful place. Went with my husband and both our moms to visit my daughter. The place is on a very narrow neighborhood street so parking my big car was difficult, but we knew that going in.  The communication with Seth was great, the place was exactly as advertise, and it was a perfect stay."
430610,2135522,2012-08-29,3108710,Lorine,Great brand new house and location. Wonderful roof deck to enjoy the views. Seth was very helpful and accommodating.
430610,2292919,2012-09-14,2887384,Karyn,"5 of us stayed at Seth's beautiful home. It was cozy, open and very clean. The views of Seattle and the sunsets from the roof deck are fantastic. 

Seth was a great host and always answered quickly to our few questions. "
430610,2321480,2012-09-17,1925080,Chris,"My two business partners and I rented this house while we were in Seattle for 4 days. It really couldn't have been better for us. We each had separate bedrooms and baths, the main space was great for working sessions, and it included all the equipment we needed to live, cook, and work. Plus, the roof deck is amazing, even better than the pictures.

The location was even better than we expected, with Wallingford's main drag AND Lake Union both a 5-10 min walk. Plus, the downtown busses stopped just a couple blocks away.

Our trip was great, in no small measure because of this house."
430610,2328933,2012-09-17,3552356,Griffin,"Seth was quick to reply and very friendly. It's a beautiful home and we had a great stay! Everything was great, except I think the cleaners may have forgotten to clean the 2nd bathroom on the 2nd floor.. but that's ok! We had a great time. Thanks!"
430610,2425177,2012-09-26,3531443,Daniel,"Last Monday will likely be remembered by most people as the Battle in Seattle between the Seahawks and Green Bay Packers on nationally televised Monday Night Football. The controversial Hail Mary touchdown pass that gave Seattle the win may forever be in question, but thanks to Seth my guests did not have to experience ""simultaneous possession"" when it came to sleeping arrangements.

Okay, that was a hard fought analogy. The real story: I unexpectedly had 6 guests coming to town from Copenhagen for work. I had no idea Monday Night Football would mean that every hotel room in downtown Seattle (and beyond) would be booked. I quickly found Seth's listing—the only place that could handle at least 3 people in separate bedrooms, but he (understandably) had a 2 night minimum. I emailed, he quickly replied and was kind enough to accomodate my guests a day before the big game. They LOVED the house—it was clean, stylish, had great sleeping quarters and all the bathrooms were stocked with toiletry essentials. A great start to a long Seattle work visit. Seth's place is on my short list of accommodations the next time I have a group of folks in town.

Seth ... for the undisputed TOUCHDOWN!"
430610,2498245,2012-10-03,3563996,Brian,"A great experience!  My parents had never been to Seattle, and I had only one brief prior visit.  I was tasked with finding a place to stay, and searched all the recommended hotels.  We wanted easy access to downtown and also to experience the flavor of local neighborhoods.  With Seth's place, we got the best of all worlds.  It was less expensive than city hotels; the location is perfect; and the home is fabulous.  

After comparing hotels, I called my buddy in Seattle, lamenting at the high prices of hotels.  He is an experienced traveler and directed me to AIRBNB.  

Seattle hotels are expensive.  We saved money by staying here, and did not have to pay taxes, costs or parking fees.  We had a full kitchen, several separate bedrooms, and parking.  The house gave us all privacy plus an open eating and living area so we could hang out together.    

The location is great.  In Wallingford, enjoy Murphy's, the local Irish tavern, a grocery, several decent restaurants, and, of course, coffee shops abound.  You can walk to Fremont and its market and great shops, quick drive to the Ballard locks, and immediate access to both 99 and I-5.  Easy access to downtown, the fish market, sculpture park, and day around Puget Sound.  My friend lives in West Seattle, another cool neighborhood, and we never had to drive more than 20 minutes to get to his house.  I spent a day walking over to the University, checking out the campus and local shops, and a great lunch at Thai Tom.   

The house is a modern and clean, with three separate bedrooms.  I stayed downstairs with a full bath, and my parents two floors up, with their own master bedroom and full bath.  In between was the full kitchen, gas stove, eating area, and living room with couch and chairs to watch the large screen tv.  Wireless internet included.  The coolest was the top floor -- full roof access with view of the city and Lake Union - just awesome.  

Seth was absolutely professional, and always in easy contact.  The weather was sunny, mid-70s every day.  No rain.  What a beautiful city.  

     "
430610,2738929,2012-10-28,2134085,Laura,This modern loft space is great - especially the heated floors! The kitchen has everything you need. Beds are very comfortable and Seth was great to work with - fast and easy. The location has easy parking and is close to everything. Thanks Seth for a great stay!
430610,2892160,2012-11-15,4087127,John,"Seth's home was beautiful and I found everything exactly as advertised. I was very impressed with how new and clean the location is. I felt like I was the first person to stay there which was all the more impressive seeing the other positive reviews from groups who have as well. The beds were really comfortable, the home had great bathrooms, a wonderful kitchen and inviting main floor. The rooftop deck has an amazing Seattle view and it's especially beautiful with a glass of wine at night. 

Seth was also a wonderful host. It was easy to get in touch with him, he was helpful on the questions I had and I felt like he really cared about the comfort and enjoyment of my stay.

I'll definitely want to stay at Seth's place the next time and highly recommend it to anyone looking for the best place in the area."
430610,3082343,2012-12-13,4043781,Mike,"Great house, easy check-in & check-out.  Would absolutely stay here again when our group comes up to Seattle again!"
430610,3455129,2013-02-01,4488584,Jingfan,"It's really a perfect I've ever had. Seth has prepared everything in the house. Very clean! 100% recommend, and the location is very good too. The area is very nice, quiet and sate."
430610,3655159,2013-02-28,2518131,Marcus,"The house is simply great, the communication with Seth was super-fast and very nice all the time! The team (CEO, CTO, CFO) enjoyed the stay a lot and will choose to stay at this place again next time they visit Seattle. 100% recommendation for anyone considering this location for his/her next vacation/business trip!"
430610,3769713,2013-03-12,4676965,Donna,"In one word ... AMAZING.  Seth's beautiful and modern home welcomed five guests on a Fri night and we shared many breakfasts, dinners and conversation in every inch of the house!   There is an ease, comfort and a peace in this house that supports closeness, conversation and connection.  And the view from the top deck ... like a 3-d postcard of downtown Seattle and the space needle!  I WILL stay here again!  Come experience the warmth of Seattle in a modern setting!"
430610,3973160,2013-04-01,890448,Lori,"We have visited Seattle a few times and this area was our favourite so far.  Now the house....it is awesome.  The place/space was perfect for our group of 5.  It is sooooo quiet.  We have forced air in our house and radiant heat in Seth's place is the best.  The neighborhood is quiet and lovely as well.  We enjoyed walking around and checking out the fab Seattle houses and amazing and creative front-yard gardens. The roof top view is amazing, wish we spent more time up there....next time.  The house was well stocked and the manual Seth provided pretty much covers everything you need to know.  Communication with Seth consisted of quick and easy text convos.  Nice and low key.  What more can I say?  2 thumbs up from our entire crew!"
430610,4083919,2013-04-08,177423,Donnie,"Great house, great location, great experience. Highly recommended!"
430610,4334785,2013-04-29,391698,Luke,"Great location, comfy beds, and Seth was very communicative via texts."
430610,4543499,2013-05-12,4595902,Dan,"A great stay at Seth's house.  Great house and location.  Myself and my colleagues use AirBnB when we need to be in the same city for work and love the idea of exploring local neighborhoods.  It's also great to be in a house so that we can eat, plan and play together.

There were a couple of small issues with house prep but Seth was a gentleman and got them resolved immediately.  Thanks Seth for being so responsive and welcoming.  "
430610,4663299,2013-05-19,5865217,Tyffany,"Beautiful home in perfect Seattle location. Rooftop deck is amazing, if you are lucky enough to get a sunny day, you can see the entire city. We rented for a business trip and couldn't be happier about our experience. Thanks! "
430610,4866652,2013-05-29,6377664,Alisa,"I loved this place.  It was clean, beautiful, modern, spacious and perfect for us. With 3 bedrooms, 3 baths, 3 floors and a roof deck, we had plenty of space and privacy.  Seth was easy to communicate with and responded quickly. I would easily recommend it to anyone, and wouldn't hesitate to stay at Seth's place again while visiting Seattle!"
430610,5872810,2013-07-20,7342802,Peter,"We loved the house. Everything was immaculate, the appliances are basically new and work perfectly. So nice for each bedroom to have its own bathroom. And the view from the deck is incredible as many others have pointed out.

Seth was wonderful to work with - responsive and helpful at every step in the process.

We also loved the neighborhood - it's like a small town but the big city is just a short drive. We stopped by Fremont Brewing, ate at Bizzarro Cafe (don't miss the bathrooms), and walked around Green Lake. 

The only negative is the driveway, which is not for the faint of heart - It slopes down toward the house. Getting out in the morning was adrenaline-inducing. If you are nervous you can find a spot on the street fairly easily.

This was our first try at using airbnb and overall it could not have been more perfect."
430610,6125356,2013-07-31,5624781,Cathy,"We liked Seth's house, especially the bath for each bedroom. Accommodations were clean and nice. Rooftop deck was good for gathering, house was close to Seattle attractions. Fresh flowers were a nice touch. Beds were comfortable and air mattress was great. Driveway too steep and garage is small. Parking on street a better option. "
430610,6559683,2013-08-17,7075293,Amy,We recently stayed at Seth's rental home and absolutely loved our time there! Seth was extremely easy to work with and very prompt to respond. The house was in perfect shape and the roof top patio was phenomenal. I would highly recommend this location and Seth. Thanks again for a great trip!
430610,6708053,2013-08-22,2382422,Daniel,"Wonderful house with incredible views of Lake Union and downtown. Excellent location - close enough to walk to plenty of restaurants, parks, and shops. The house was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described. Seth was very responsive whenever I had any questions. My family wished we could stay longer and would be happy to stay there again."
430610,6916261,2013-08-30,7609133,Mary,"This house is really nice - spacious, clean and it is located in a very nice area - close to Union Lake and a great park. The rooftop deck has a great view of Seattle. Having 3 bedrooms and 3 baths and a nicely furnished kitchen, a living and dining room was much better than staying at a hotel. It was a short drive to downtown and many other locations. Seth responded to emails and calls very quickly.  We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it."
430610,8162145,2013-10-18,3221445,Kedar,It was a great stay. Seth is really helpful in answering questions even when he is not in country. House is beautiful and clean. Near to great places to eat and hang out. 
430610,8485260,2013-11-02,7570404,Ken,Host was very accommodating to our needs. Great space!
430610,8573992,2013-11-05,2396938,Ed,"Very comfortable condo! Easy stay. No issues. Seth makes it easy. Location is Nicely wedged in Wallingford with easy access to Fremont, Lake Union and Greenlake. Enjoyed the visit."
430610,8900887,2013-11-25,9349301,Jeffrey,The house was wonderful and Seth was helpful and attentive. Highly recommended for a stay in Wallingford!
430610,9201930,2013-12-13,3394000,Christy,"Not only is this house visually modern and beautiful it is also green and high quality: radiant floor heating, tankless on-demand hot water, toto toilets, quality linens, and solid furniture. The views of Seattle are awesome and had this been a summer stay I'm sure we would have enjoyed the rooftop deck! The house easily accomodates 6 with 3 comfy queens and 3 full baths. The only drawback we found is that noise amplifies down to the lowest level, so whoever is trying to sleep-in shouldn't be down there. Seth is a fine host and has a great property! With our office in the Green Lake area, I'm sure we'd like to use this property again for out of town guests!"
430610,9261531,2013-12-16,9473492,Jeff,The place was as beautiful as advertised.   I would definitely stay again.  Great quiet neighbourhood that's a short drive to great shopping and restaurants.   
430610,9341460,2013-12-23,1109823,Meghan,"I arranged for my family (six adults) to stay at this lovely home for the Christmas holiday. This house was absolutely wonderful! Besides the comfortable beds and well stocked kitchen (it had everything you might need - pots and pans, coffee maker, good knife set), one of our favorite things was that all the bedrooms were on different floors from the main living space. This meant people could be in the kitchen or living room without the fear of disturbing or waking up people in their bedrooms. The view from the roof deck was amazing - I wish my family had visited during the summer so we could have spent more time up there. 

The house location is another huge plus. It is located on a quiet street within walking distance of two great neighborhoods, Fremont and Wallingford, which have shopping, grocery stores, and locally-owned restaurants and coffee shops. 

Seth was very easy to work with and responsive to our inquires. 

My family said they would definitely stay here again."
430610,12156487,2014-04-24,231696,Octavio,"A beautiful modern townhouse that lives up to its reviews.  Very clean, great light, awesome location.  Seth respected our privacy but was very responsive to any needs that came up.  Thank you!"
430610,12643785,2014-05-06,8402472,Jay,"Seth's place is simply wow! Tastefully decorated, it is located conveniently close to everything. Seth is a very responsive host and was flexible to accommodate my last minute plans. Will definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle!"
430610,12883588,2014-05-13,8901425,Dave,"Absolutely stellar, including brilliant attention to detail.  An exceptional property in an exceptional location.  Must ty!"
430610,12970973,2014-05-16,12411631,Rhys,"Hello,

Im with a group of 6 other people doing a tour around America and Canada.

We've stayed at 4 AIRBNB homes so far and Seth's house has taken the cake.

It's in a great area away from the city but close enough to get there in 10mins. The house photos don't do it justice, it's much larger then it looks incredibly spacey, clean and incredibly modern.

With 7 grown men plus bringing a whole band was still enough room for us all to fit and sleep. The rooms were kept nice and with most rooms having their own bathroom and shower. 

Seth has even gone the extra mile with a brand new kitchen and tv with most main living areas with a I-Pod dock and a roof top to drink and relax.

I would highly recommend others to stay here its beautiful it's close and big enough for a family or a group of friends.

Thanks "
430610,13254402,2014-05-23,2699053,Kirk,"Seth was an excellent host and responded to all communications quickly and concisely.  I stayed in his home with two co workers from Tokyo and they were both impressed with the spaciousness and the comfort of the bedrooms.  I have family in the area so I am quite familiar with Wallingford, because of this, I didn't get many recommendations from Seth on local spots, but he has a list printed out in the guidelines that are on the kitchen counter.  The DVD's were a nice touch, we watched Despicable Me II since I thought it would break the language barrier.  If you are looking for a spacious, comfortable abode while in Seattle, do you yourself a favor and stay with Seth.  The local spots are great, bus service to the convention center takes 30 minutes and the amount of windows in the place make it bright and airy."
430610,18171540,2014-08-23,10980135,Ahmad,"We spent 5 days at Seth's house, it was a wonderful trip, we liked the house. For sure, we will deal with him in the future."
430610,18621805,2014-08-29,10189898,Kaisa,"We enjoyed our stay at Seth's place. The neighbourhood is very lovely and peaceful, with an easy access to all around the city. The house was great for a group of 6 people."
430610,18813300,2014-09-01,4134474,Andrew,"Seth's place was awesome and in a great area.  He was very responsive and was helpful during our stay.  The place itself has everything you need and perfect if you're traveling in a group.  The best part of the house is the rooftop and its view of Downtown Seattle. Wallingford and Fremont are right down the street and its a quick Uber ride or walk to coffee shops, restaurants, and bars.  I highly recommend Seth's place and I would definitely book his place again the next time I return to Seattle. "
430610,19079612,2014-09-06,11950260,Ryan,This place was absolutely amazing and Seth the greatest of host! It is exactly as described. The views of Seattle and the neighborhood really tied the whole experience together. It was not only functional but also really lovely. Thank you.
430610,20246862,2014-09-26,1255936,James David,"Seth was the perfect host--everything was smooth and easy. The check-in process was simple--a lock box on the door--and the information packet Seth provided was comprehensive and answered all our questions. The house was just as described--clean, modern, well-appointed, and had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. the roof deck was the real highlight--the views were fantastic and the furniture perfect for lounging and enjoying the sun. We easily found parking on the street, but we could walk to a number of shops and great restaurants in the neighborhood. The location made for a quick drive into downtown--10 minutes across the bridge and we were right in the middle of all the sights. We would definitely stay here again!"
430610,20392045,2014-09-28,11822126,Nick,"The house was good and true to the photos. Roof deck has awesome views! House was clean, well located and kitchen well stocked. "
430610,21539085,2014-10-19,21938481,Brant,"This home is in a great location and neighborhood.  We loved the access to running and walking by the water.  Freemont neighborhood has a unique feeling we would enjoy staying again.

The host made sure we were taken care of before, during and at the end of our stay.  We appreciated his interest in making sure the house met our needs.

We would stay at this location and/or rent from the owner again!"
430610,22999192,2014-11-19,1554184,Dawn,"Seth's house was great for our short stay in Seattle. Once the radiant heat kicks in, the place warms up nicely and provides a cosy refuge from some chilly Seattle evenings. The house is clean, well-equipped, and within walking distance of downtown Wallingford with plenty of dining, shopping and grocery options. Thanks for having us, Seth! "
430610,23632432,2014-12-07,892056,Alex,"This was a great place to stay, plenty of room to relax in the main living room and kitchen area, and comfortable bedrooms to sleep in. Easy walking access to Fremont and Wallingford neighborhoods."
430610,23794237,2014-12-10,11713433,Demi,Great location and beautiful home. Seth was a great host and made the process easy.
430610,24040905,2014-12-17,24707674,Janine,"description and pictures of property were perfect.  Clean, great neighborhood, loads of kitchen tools and supplies, everything you need to feel at home. "
430610,24324929,2014-12-26,22532185,Jeanne,"This home, its amenities, and location are just as described and were perfect for our week-long stay.  The house is clean and spacious and exactly what our group of six was hoping for.  It's in a great neighborhood that is easily walkable to two lakes, a park, and the restaurants and shops of both Fremont and Wallingford, and downtown Seattle is accessible via either public transportation or a 15-20 minute car ride.  We especially liked the rooftop deck with a view of the city, the radiant heated floors, and a well-equipped kitchen that made it a pleasure to cook there.  Seth was very responsive and available, and communications were quick and easy.  We would definitely stay at this location again!"
430610,24523616,2014-12-30,21503023,Joanne,"The house was very nice, modern design and up to date amenities.  We had a couple of minor questions for Seth and he responded quickly with excellent support.  The neighborhood is very nice with excellent views from the roof-top deck.  Although at this time of year it is a little cool to spend much time up there.  the floor heating was especially nice although I don't think the previous renters used the third (bottom) bedroom, so it took a few hours to warm it up.  But once up to temperature, it was very pleasant.  There was a full complement of dishes, silverware, pots and pans etc. even some spices and condiments."
430610,25480508,2015-01-17,24904648,Victoria,"Awesome place to stay - Seth was a great host and let us know about every little detail of the house before we even got there, complete with PDF overview. Thrilled to be able to send that to the rest of the people staying with me. Even had exact pictures of where to place the trash! Definitely stay at this place. Seth is really responsive and great to work with as well - always getting back to us within minutes if we had questions!"
430610,26233442,2015-02-07,11360711,Elizabeth,Great place for a visit to Seattle.  Close to great restaurants and downtown.
430610,26571321,2015-02-15,23488250,Khajoo979,Good location and the house had all you need for a comfortable stay 
430610,26654172,2015-02-16,6188610,Nick,"This place is all you can imagine and more. The pictures are just the beginning of what you will find in this great space. No need to worry, everything you need is available, from kitchen supplies to towels and shampoo. The only thing I can say that was a negative was the fact that the cleaning fee was so expensive and we were still asked to do laundry before we left. Our stay was only one night (which really meant less than 24 hours) and we still paid the 100+ cleaning fee which was fine but then to be asked to do laundry was strange. Seth was good about it when i brought up the fee, he allowed us to leave without the laundry. Overall it was great just a bit strange."
430610,26950004,2015-02-22,27551652,Marc,Great stay. Great and very efficient communication with Seth. We received all information immediately and as soon as possible. No problems at all.
430610,27106507,2015-02-25,5581926,Justin,"I use AirBnB for work travel...and sometimes I browse AirBnB for locations that I may use for my film/video projects.

I selected Seth's house for a Seattle shoot for a financial services client. I loved the modern look with some exposed wooden beams and trim, the concrete flooring and modern kitchen and furniture. 

I know Seattle very well because I live here, and if you are visiting from out of town, this is a great location that is easily accessible to downtown and fun neighborhoods like Freemont and Ballard. 

Seth was a great communicator and promptly responded to my inquiries. When I arrived, I found the house to be clean and well organized.

The top deck has a great view of the city, and would be an excellent place to relax and sip on an afternoon cocktail or glass of wine!

My overall experience was positive and I would recommend Seth's home for any travelers to Seattle."
430610,27267039,2015-03-01,3096440,Brenda,"The house is beautiful and in a perfect location close to the UW (which we were there to visit) and downtown. The neighborhood is very quiet, and the view from the rooftop is great! Seth was easy to communicate with and gave very clear instructions for check-in and check-out. We'd definitely stay there again. "
430610,28211019,2015-03-20,11960115,Alice,"This house is in a great neighborhood.  We enjoyed walking everywhere, including to Green Lake, breakfast at Julia's and dinner in the Freemont neighborhood.  Seth's guide to the house was very detailed and the house was as advertised.   The house was also nicely stocked with pantry items like salt/pepper and coffee filters (items that are a pain to get if you are just staying for just a couple of nights).  Thanks for a great stay Seth!"
430610,28347032,2015-03-22,29072384,Alice,Our stay here went very smoothly! The house manual was very descriptive and helpful. The house was beautiful and had an amazing rooftop view. 
430610,29829855,2015-04-13,3277083,Joseph,Beautiful place. Easy access to downtown Seattle. Nearby restaurants and natural food coop. Host was perfect. 
430610,31084467,2015-05-01,11511867,Alex,"What can I say? Seth's place is absolutely beautiful. The modern/industrial feel of the place was incredible. I've always wanted to experience living/staying in a place like this! The design and decoration of the place is stunning and the view from the rooftop is spectacular. My coworker and I stayed here for 2 nights and thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! Seth was the perfect host and communicated quickly and efficiently with us. He provides guest with an ""instruction manual"" of sorts that was very helpful and made sure our stay was fun and smooth for both parties. We didn't walk around the area too much, but the neighborhood definitely felt safe and we saw many conveniences very close by. His place is well stocked and has everything you would need. We also loved the chocolates on the towels left in each room :) 

I would highly recommend Seth's place if you're staying in Seattle! "
430610,31519447,2015-05-06,29416753,Alison,"This house is in a great neighborhood and very close to downtown. We loved the view from the roof and the very modern feel of the building. We would definitely stay here again but here are some things to know:

1- shortage of towels. The house sleeps eight but there were only five towels
2-there is no cable and no password for the Amazon prime account
3-the owner only provides 2 rolls of toilet paper for each bathroom. Stock up before you arrive
4-bring socks! This place has heated floors but we were not cold but didn't want our feet to freeze so just bring extra socks. 
"
430610,32090878,2015-05-13,10668443,Rongrong,"Very good location. My mother and i spend almost a week there. House is clean. Seth have a good taste for the fitment. My mother are willing to take care of the house, cause it is real like a home. Also Seth is very good communication. Anything you need help, he will reply you at the first (website hidden): bed is confortable as home.
We hope will have chance to come back again."
430610,42665241,2015-08-15,31938874,Carmen,"The house was great in a wonderful, central location.  Very quiet neighborhood as well.  "
430610,44795263,2015-08-29,24347884,Deborah,"We had a wonderful experience with Seth as our host. He always responded quickly to our questions before and after arrival. The house was very well appointed and extremely comfortable. Good WiFi connection. The four of us had plenty of room to spread out. The rooftop deck was a great feature and we enjoyed watching Netflix on the large screen TV after exploring the Fremont, Wallingford and University of Washington. We had a rental car so also were able see many other sights in Seattle. Great base of operations for anyone interested in UW. "
430610,45182770,2015-08-31,2423382,Shaina,"Our stay at Seth's apartment was wonderful. It is a huge, clean space with an amazing rooftop and views of the city! I would highly recommend staying here - Seth is easy to communicate with and made for a wonderful stay. Thank you, Seth!"
430610,47604046,2015-09-20,12909056,Dan,It was very easy to communicate with Seth.  The place is beautiful and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
430610,49253667,2015-10-02,43940813,Rakesh,"We stayed at Seth's place while in Seattle to drop our son to the university and loved every bit of it. Google maps give an accurate direction to the flat. We arrived a bit early and Seth was kind enough to allow us to keep our luggage in the garage while flat was being cleaned up and informed us as soon as the flat was ready. The flat is exactly as seen in pictures. The location is excellent and very central, a few minutes walk to Burke trail, Wallingford Ave and Fremont. University is 30min walk or best by bike in 10mins. Beds were very comfortable and kitchen and toilets were well supplied. We were able to log in to Netflix and enjoy the big TV, so never a dull moment. For few days we were 6 people staying and it was very comfortable. Overall a great experience. Only two things one needs to be aware, if one is averse to climbing stairs this place may be inconvenient. Also if you are bringing in a big car the garage slope is steep. Though street parking is easily available. Thanks Seth looking forward to visiting again."
430610,50533993,2015-10-12,12109885,Susie,"Highly recommend and hope to stay in this fabulous home again!!Seth's home was awesome and exactly how represented!  The rooftop deck has a gorgeous view of the city skyline.  The home is conveniently located to downtown,the University and is in an adorable, safe neighborhood with great restaurants."
430610,51719525,2015-10-24,34584543,Robert,"The listing was as advertised, and the pictures are accurate. Seth left very detailed instructions on how to operate all the appliances, etc. Without traffic, it's only about 15 minutes to drive downtown, so it's pretty convenient. There is parking in the driveway, but street parking seems to get tight at night, so only count on one space for sure. The wifi, the heating, and the kitchen appliances all worked well, and the place has clearly been renovated during the past several years. There are three bedrooms and a convertible sofa. We didn't use the roof, but there are chairs and a table there (no barbecue that I could find). Seth was responsive to our text messages, and although we didn't meet him, a professional host."
4423130,24455557,2014-12-28,24048508,Ida,"David is an impeccable host, with a very comfortable home and neighborhood.  There were numerous places to eat within 5 minutes. The room was exactly as pictured and described.  It is a very relaxing hideaway - I only wish I could have stayed longer.  Thank you David, I hope to stay here again."
4423130,25320036,2015-01-12,24748003,Bekki,"The place was great. We were there for a wedding, so was mostly out and about for the weekend ( the place was half a mile from the venue). David made us feel right at home.  The only bummer was I couldn't get my laptop to connect to the wifi, but I blame operator error :) "
4423130,28355088,2015-03-22,4333325,Rev. Meredith,"David was there to greet me and to show me the suite when I checked in early in the day on my way to my seminar.  His home is so lovely! It had everything we could possibly need in the suite and he offers his guests the use of the full kitchen downstairs if needed.  I had a delicious fresh decaf Americano in the room without having to leave the room n the morning!
David even responded to my text late at night with a question after my roommate went to sleep.  He is an excellent host with a beautiful, clean home!  It is very convenient to I-5 and the Northgate Mall as well.  He recommended a few places for breakfast which was helpful.  "
4423130,28913476,2015-03-31,6097333,Karen,David was a great host and made us all feel welcome.He had everything ready and provided us all the info we needed about the home.He was easy to contact for questions..
4423130,29626499,2015-04-10,29671575,Graham,"We were made to feel very welcome by David, our host.   Our accommodation was very comfortable, set in a quiet neighbourhood, with easy access to nearby shops and transport services.   These were all in a comfortable walking distance.   We found the description and photos on the profile were accurate - there were no surprises.
David was a very considerate and accommodating host.  He was sensitive to our needs and requirements.
Many thanks for a very enjoyable stay.   "
4423130,30784665,2015-04-27,29407217,Rhyno,"I really liked the homeyness of David's top floor unit. Warmly decorated, very comfortable bed with lots of soft pillows. The skylight and end windows bring in lots of light. His photos are accurate and the space feels larger than the pics reflect. I was very happy with my stay and even though I only saw David for a few moments of my last day we stayed in touch by texting which he responded to promptly. I highly recommend David's place."
4423130,31542379,2015-05-06,17848320,Tanya,"We were not a good match for host and client, however, David is responsive and communicates well. "
4423130,32440725,2015-05-17,1189033,Delaina,"David, my host was very pleasant and the accommodations were wonderful. Close to shopping, entertainment and Starbucks. The neighborhood is safe and very quiet with a nice view from the private deck. The bedroom was equipped with cable, small fridge and coffee, perfect for 1-3 people.
I will return  "
4423130,33403429,2015-05-27,32999354,Jingzhe,"David is a great host, he provides everything we need. The upstairs suite is larger than the picture described, and it can accommodate more than two people. The house is located in a great neighborhood,  10 minutes walking to a mall, movie theater, and couple good restaurants.  During our stay, even we just saw David two or three times, David is doing his best to make us feel more comfortable.  We will be happy to stay with David when we decide to visit Seattle again. "
4423130,34720331,2015-06-11,32165329,Amanda,"David's home was very welcoming and accommodating. The room was even bigger than I expected and had everything I needed (shampoo, lotion, hairdryer, fridge stocked with water, microwave, air conditioning). I met David on my second day and he was very friendly! We kept in touch every day and there were no issues with me coming and going as I pleased. The location was prime for me. A short walk to a variety of restaurants and coffee shops, the mall, and very close to I-5. His patio was relaxing and also accessible whenever I wanted. I looked at multiple listings before I decided to go with Davids and I'm so glad I did! I'll be using him again when I plan another trip to Seattle."
4423130,34916416,2015-06-13,137044,Karen,"Lovely suite...comfy beds, well stocked - and in a very convenient location.  David was most accommodating and a generous host. "
4423130,35054079,2015-06-14,11063340,William,"David has been a gracious host and was at hand to welcome me to his lovely home and suite. The suite was bigger than I have expected and it has two beds in the room. What you see in the photo is as real as you can get. I have never ceased to stay wity Airbnb everytime I am in need of one and David's place is what I would recommend to all of you. Being a hotelier myself for a decade now, David's suite exceeded my expectations and I am impressed by the hospitality rendered to me. Though I didn't get to meet David before I departed from his place, I hope we get to cross paths again in the near future. Thank you David for your lovely place."
4423130,35251364,2015-06-16,34586252,Shuo,The room is warm and sweet. It is good to stay for one night!
4423130,35365019,2015-06-18,26811079,Carri,"David was a gracious host. Loved the fact he was also in the wine biz. 
Accommodations were fine. Low ceilings watch your head....and I am short. "
4423130,36075703,2015-06-24,1181487,Pk,Very prompt and courteous.  Everything as advertised and a few things more.
4423130,37229942,2015-07-05,19480682,Philipp,David was a great host. We stayed only one night but we really enjoyed it. The whole neighborhood is very friendly: we were warmly welcomed- thank you for the beer and the suggestions of how to celebrate July 4th! The room itself is nice and as described.
4423130,38183998,2015-07-13,4822144,David,"The suite was on the top floor. It was quiet and comfortable. 
The Air Conditioning was adequate for the temperatures for the 3 nights we stayed. 
The rental was excellent for the price, and I would stay again. 
Our host was not present during our stay which had us feel as if we had free access to the entire home, and, our course was long hours which had us feel we weren't taking away from our hosts sleep. "
4423130,38560921,2015-07-16,12911667,Amy,Felt very comfortable to do my own thing and welcome to visit if I liked.  Was so close to everything I needed and in a nice neighborhood with lovely neighbors.  Parking and wifi an added bonus.  Space exactly like the photo and common areas- clean warm and inviting.  Quiet and relaxing.  Loved it!!  
4423130,38916737,2015-07-19,32554819,Yvette&Ralph,GPS did a wonderful job getting us there. The rooms were cool (A/C's were on) And just as pictured. Missed David the 1st day but met him at the house after a long day in the city our 2nd night. Very polite and courteous. Everything was great. The sunset on the patio the 1st night was beautiful (my daughter said-we drove all night & slept through it) Comfortable beds & all the amenities were there. We didn't need anything but a towel or 2!! Thanks again David!
4423130,43145550,2015-08-17,40514712,Lorrie,"The suite is wonderful; comfy beds, lots of natural light, stylishly decorated and well-stocked with many extra amenities.  David’s home is located on a perfectly quiet street in a nice neighborhood that is close to everything anyone might need.

David is an extremely generous, friendly, fun-loving host.  He went out of his way to offer my daughter and I excellent shopping, dining and sightseeing advice.  As an added bonus, he let us in on some of his favorite wine-tasting spots, which made our trip to Woodinville a wonderful experience!  

Our trip couldn’t have been better! 
"
4423130,43726163,2015-08-21,26771088,Jason,"I really enjoyed my stay in this suite.  The host, David, was incredibly helpful, telling me about the area and recommending things for me to do, the space is great, very comfortable and in an ideal location within Seattle.  David was always available via text which was very helpful.  I could not have asked for a better host, thank you for making this a great stay."
4423130,47130055,2015-09-15,43983677,Jiaming,David text us his own schedule to let us know when we can move in. We are actually having the whole house to live. 
4423130,49036094,2015-09-30,39409624,Heng,"This is our first Airbnb and David's made this experience so nice! The place is just as described located close to downtown , and meanwhile easy to connect to Road 5 to explore the spots near the city . The place is nice and clean. My family had a great time . Davide is a great guy ,we even had a chance to join the party David hold and met some very interesting and nice people . I would say it is a place where you have a privacy and meanwhile so convenient to explore the city . we will definitly recommend it and will come back again"
4423130,50420916,2015-10-11,39744025,Bessy,"3 of us had a last minute trip, though we didn't get to meet David, he was very responsive, made sure we had all the information needed. We stayed upstairs with our own room, there were two beds. The beds were comfortable. We shared bathroom downstairs.  The house was really clean and David provided everything we needed to stay. Location is great as well, around 15 mins driving from downtown and UW. Absolutely recommended place to stay in Seattle. Thanks David!"
4423130,51392497,2015-10-19,23352517,Adrien,David's home is well appointed and set in a quiet cul de sac in a pleasant area to the north of Seattle. It is PERFECTLY located for an express bus service into downtown Seattle. Headroom notwithstanding the space is perfectly comfortable - with two queen/double beds at opposite ends of the private floor.
4423130,54483110,2015-11-20,49046947,Hong Ki,"Nice room ever I stayed overseas
Go! And stay!
The best place in seattle"
4423130,58479472,2016-01-02,27851707,Filip,"I stayed here with a friend. We felt really welcome in the house. The room is as advertised, if not better. There's a set of appliances available for personal use, including a TV and a microwave. David is a really friendly guy with an interest in wine so we had no issues at all."
6168975,35022010,2015-06-14,11756065,Nancy,"Veronica is a terrific host.  She was easy to reach and communicate with.  The place was just as described, perhaps even better.  Super clean and comfortable.  We did not cook there, but it looked like there was everything you could possibly need in the kitchen.  The area is convenient to the Seattle area.  We took the light rail to downtown without any trouble at all.  The neighborhood is very quiet, off-street parking a plus, enjoyed some outside time on the roomy deck, and ate at local eateries.  Wonderful stay!"
6168975,36325449,2015-06-27,33976363,Christopher,Really enjoyed the stay here - the place was clean & inviting; the view spectacular! it was everything the ad said and so much more!  Veronica was such a gracious host and made sure we were taken care of - will try and stay here again - if we can get in :-)
6168975,37486666,2015-07-07,35159588,Luke,"We stayed at the house over the July 4th weekend and for the most part were satisfied with the location.  We did notice that the house smelled somewhat like cat urine and that a cat could be heard meowing during the day at times inside of the house.  The garbage disposal was also broken, but we were able to dispose of food waste regardless without much hassle.  The biggest issue came at the end when we were billed additional money for having an infant in the house.  Based upon our reservation, we thought that reserving the house for 3 adults would be fine (even given extra charges for the 3rd adult that the owner charges).  However, we were later informed that an infant does count towards the number of guests and that we would owe an additional $56 per day on top of the $56 per day we were paying for the 3rd guest.  The incremental charges for a baby, on top of already paying $56 for the 3rd guest per day have left a bad taste in using AirBnB (at that point should have just used a hotel).  I will admit that language in the listing does allow for those charges for a guest of any age, though given that no accommodations were made for the baby it's hard to see what the $56 per day bought us."
6168975,37794892,2015-07-10,4051152,Virginia,Terrific house with a great location. Only wish we could've stayed longer to really take advantage of all of the amenities. The deck alone could have been my respite for two days straight.
6168975,37986992,2015-07-12,17375038,Aviva,The was beautiful and matched the pictures perfectly. We had mentioned we were having a family get together for my birthday which made her a little nervous which is fair. This is a beautiful home- if you rent it take care of it so it stays that way. There are plenty of others you can rent who could care less about the condition they give it to you. It net our expectations which were quite high and it's worth staying in! We will definitely rent from her again. :) 
6168975,39191440,2015-07-21,34451613,Cody,"Location was great, close to running paths and the city.  Host had a welcome plate of cookies, wine, and beverages in the fridge for us. House was clean and as pictured in the listing.  "
6168975,39572147,2015-07-24,5565463,Regina,"Veronica is a wonderful host. Her place is very cute, warm and clean. We felt there like at home. Also having her cat around the house was, for us cat lovers, great pleasure. I would recommend Veronica's place to anyone."
6168975,39958132,2015-07-27,19463670,Kevin,"Nice quiet neighbourhood, easy to get to the ballpark and the city via public transit ($7 cab ride or 1 mile walk to the LRT). 
Nice house with plenty of room and a killer deck.
Veronica was very welcoming and helpful. Highly recommended."
6168975,40462497,2015-07-31,7265566,Raphael,The place is great. Veronica is great.  
6168975,41228698,2015-08-05,17866527,Julian,I had a great time at Veronica's place. It was quiet and clean. I was in Seattle looking for an apartment and she helped with info about the neighborhoods. The house is walking distance to some good places to eat or you can just walk along the lake since that is just down the hill. It was easy to get a hold of Veronica if I had any questions and I would definitely stay here again. 
6168975,41765712,2015-08-09,30175206,Richard,"Our host was very welcoming and could not have been nicer.....We were quite comfortable during our stay, though we were away modt of the day sightseeing and visiting! "
6168975,42175047,2015-08-11,31631821,Heather,This beautiful gem of a home was the perfect gathering place for entertaining my family while they were visiting Seattle from out of town.  I live in Seattle but my condo is too small to accommodate family visits so Veronica's lovely home was the perfect solution.  I highly recommend this home... the views of the lake were even better than anticipated.  The neighborhood is peaceful.  Plenty of space in the home and a large wrap around deck w/ BBQ.  Veronica was incredibly gracious and warmly welcomed us upon our arrival.  She responded promptly when we had a question during our stay and met us outside the home as we departed to say goodbye.  I couldn't have asked for more.  Thank you Veronica!
6168975,43075077,2015-08-17,2051222,Patti,"Veronica's home is pretty and comfortable and very clean. The deck is huge! Veronica was so thoughtful and left us a snack and some drinks.... Much appreciated because we got in late. It's located close to the airport and was easy to get to. There is a cute shopping/restaurant area nearby, within walking distance if you don't mind hills. Or if you don't want to walk, the neighborhood is well served by Uber. We would come back anytime. I highly recommend this place! "
6168975,43423323,2015-08-19,25113435,Judith,"Veronica, was very responsive and she and the her house had many touches of welcoming.  Good directions, snacks, and nice tourist support and information.   The place was very nice , clean and convenient .   The neighborhood was quiet and I loved the views from the house and deck."
6168975,44133083,2015-08-24,22064778,Michael,"I picked this listing because of the location and my need for a two bedroom two bathroom house. The owner, who lives in a basement apartment beneath the house, is friendly and helpful. 

The house was as described in the listing, and was clean and appropriately staged as a rental. It was very comfortable to stay in, and we appreciated the nice deck with BBQ, comfortable chairs, and view of the lake. The neighborhood, very close to Lake Washington, is very quiet with very little through traffic, but it is very convenient to downtown Columbia City and the light rail, which will take you to the airport or downtown.

We appreciated the extra features that made for a nice touch, including bath products in the bathrooms and some food and drink in the refrigerator. Overall we had an enjoyable stay and would not hesitate to return."
6168975,45107776,2015-08-31,38827993,Ann,"Our hostess, Veronica, was more than welcoming and gave us some very good tips on restaurants to dine at and good walking trails in the area.   She gave us information on the light rail and places to go while in Seattle.  Coffee and scones were left for our consumption as well as wine, beer, and chocolates in the refrigerator.  She went out of her way to make us feel right at home!  "
6168975,47089300,2015-09-15,41759380,Tim,"I was delighted to find this home in my airbnb search for suitable lodging for my visiting relatives, one of whom is quite elderly and frail.  It's a very accessible, lovely and cozy bungalow in a quiet neighborhood, very much as advertised.  Veronica has tastefully remodeled it and equipped it with updated appliances, modern kitchen, etc.  It has a terrific deck (with barbecue grill, table, and nice views), a well-stocked pantry, and a great location (close to Seward Park, Columbia City and Light Rail).  While I did not actually stay in the house myself (though I shared several wonderful evenings on the deck), my relatives reported that it was very comfortable, that they thoroughly enjoyed their stay, and that they would love to stay there again.  Veronica is a warm, attentive and accommodating host, and I especially appreciated her sensitivity to the unique challenges and needs of an elderly guest.  I would not hesitate to recommend this listing, and Veronica, to anyone looking for a great place to stay when visiting.       "
6168975,47512258,2015-09-19,42598333,Lyn,"We really enjoyed our three day stay in Seattle. Our host Veronica is really really nice throughout our trip, who is easy to contact. The house has all that you want, various kinds of cooking tools, bath wares etc. It is clean and warm with a brilliant deck and great location. It's close to Lake Washington where you can enjoy the lake view and trials. 

We would absolutely come back in the future! Thank you and look forward to seeing you:)"
6168975,48126156,2015-09-23,43947034,Rena,"We loved staying at Veronica's house while in Seattle for a friend's wedding recently. The location was very convenient for us, in a quiet neighborhood, with a short walk to parks, jogging trails, and the scrumptious Both Ways Cafe (with a 10% off guest coupon!). The house itself is spacious, beautiful, and very clean, with lovely deck views. Wi-fi worked perfectly. Kitchen and bathrooms are well-stocked with supplies. We especially appreciated the welcoming snacks and beverages in the fridge!  Veronica is very responsive and friendly, and I recommend her home as a wonderful place to stay! We'll be back :) Thanks again!
"
6168975,48554241,2015-09-27,14246987,James,"Veronica was a warm and energetic host who seems to truly love welcoming people to her city and home. The house is immaculate and stocked with anything you should need--kitchen supplies, shower items, books, and tourism magazines. We especially loved that there were fans as we are used to sleeping with the sound. Had we not had a fan, it would have been a silent night as the neighborhood is very quiet. Speaking of sleeping, we stayed in the master bedroom and the bed and comforter were very comfortable.  Veronica gave suggestions for nearby places to eat and websites to use for planning hikes. Take her suggestion and the 10% discount for Both Ways Cafe, which is within walking distance. Their breakfast and coffee were wonderful. She also helped us navigate the area quicker by suggesting to drive along the lake's coast when the main streets were busy.  One thing to point out is although you have an entire home available to you, it is connected by a staircase (with a closing door) to her personal space in the basement.  This was not an issue for us. Yet generally speaking, we think Airbnb should have a label for ""Entire home connected to owner's residence"" or something along those lines for postings like this. All in all, a great host, home and location! Veronica set the standard high for us and if ever in the area, we would stay again."
6168975,49059037,2015-09-30,27682613,Bob,"This really is a beautiful place, very near Lake Washington in a nice neighborhood. There are two large bedrooms each with a bathroom. Great attention had been paid to every detail. The rooms are large and nicely furnished. The kitchen was well stocked with condiments and snacks as well as dishes and cooking utensils.  Arrangements had been made in case our host wasn't there when we arrived on our somewhat uncertain schedule. She was there and proved to be charming. My sister and I stayed here for three days and enjoyed every minute. I highly recommend it."
6168975,50584448,2015-10-12,23531341,Christina,"My daughter and I had a wonderful stay at Veronica's Lake View Retreat.  The home is charming, CLEAN, well-provisioned, comfortable beds, large furnished deck.  Great location just blocks from Lake Washington.  The fridge and cupboard were stocked with drinks, snacks (including child yogurts for my daughter), chocolates, a bottle of wine - really appreciated!  Veronica met us upon arrival and showed us around.  She is very friendly and welcoming which made us feel right at home.  She was staying in the MIL during our visit but we never heard her.  We both wished we could have stayed longer than 2 nights.   She is also great at communicating by email, very prompt replies.  Thanks for a wonderful AirBnB experience, Veronica!"
6168975,50946353,2015-10-16,44409230,Chloe,"It is a comfortable and friendly place, near to Lake Washington, has a beautiful lake view from the house. Veronica is very kindly and nice."
6168975,51539440,2015-10-21,12767560,Julie,"My aunt and I recently stayed at Veronica's lovely home and could not have been more comfortable or felt more welcome.  The home is even more beautiful than in the photos the view of the water from the deck is incredible!  Veronica's extra special little touches, such as a fridge stocked with gourmet snacks and beverages, seasonal decor, and cozy bedding made our stay there just perfect.  The location was ideal for us as well but bear in mind it is not walking distance from the light rail so a car is required.  There is off-street parking.  I will definitely stay there again on a return trip to Seattle."
6168975,55562046,2015-12-02,924244,Cheryl,"This is a lovely house, beautiful muted colors and decor, cozy and well designed for two couples or a family. The host was away when we arrived, so we let ourselves in and felt immediately welcomed by lots of snacks and drinks in the kitchen. We loved the  location, a couple minutes walk to beautiful Lake Washington, and a very quick drive to downtown Columbia City. Lots of restaurants, shops and a cute vintage movie theater. We were there for a week, which went by much too quickly!  Veronica is a great host, warm and friendly, and you can trust this listing. "
6168975,57641171,2015-12-28,16015753,Connie,"Our stay at Veronica's from December (phone number hidden) was a most pleasant experience.  Veronica was a gracious hostess whose home was neat, clean, and well appointed.  Our trip to Seattle was to spend the Christmas holiday with our children.  Our plan included preparing a Christmas dinner for the family (five of us) at the Airbnb location.  

The kitchen was VERY cook friendly and since I was cooking major meals, I appreciated that.

The location is great; quiet, with plenty of safe street parking.  We could walk just a few blocks to Lake Washington and enjoy the hiking path as well as waterfront.

Veronica was very prompt in addressing all of my questions.  It was a joy to meet her and I would pronounce our stay a huge success.

Thank you Veronica!"
1090449,4522940,2013-05-10,6119611,Qiang,Enjoyed our stay in Chad and Ruben's place. Very close to downtown and convenient for all the sights. Chad and Ruben's were hepful and would certainly recommend them to other Airbnbers
1090449,4616182,2013-05-15,6067712,Jesus,"Loved this place. Chad was very quick to respond and scheduling was easy. The apartment was great and comfortable. The streets were very serene and cool, even in hot weather, since there are so many trees around. The interiors were nicely decorated and clean. The entrance was easy to find and accessible from the street making it really easy to load and unload luggage. If I have friends or family staying on the hill again, I'll definitely send them here first."
1090449,4685965,2013-05-20,6064079,Susan,"I really loved the unit and the location.  It was clean, comfortable and modern.  I enjoyed having a fully equipped kitchen and the wi fi was a plus.  I was really surprised at how quiet it was and I couldn't hear anyone upstairs!  It has its own entry way and is a block away from all the awesome restaurants, bars, coffee shops and shopping!  Would definitely stay here again! Thanks Chad and Ruben! "
1090449,4775297,2013-05-25,6156434,Steven,"We really enjoyed our stay at this location in Seattle. The apartment was well taken care of, and included all of the basics that you would need to feel like it was home. The location itself was a fantastic spot in Capital Hill; it was close to a lot of neat shops and restaurants. 

As a host, Chad kept his distance and made sure that we had our privacy. I did request something upon first arriving and he was very quick and responsive to this request. 

The stay here was great, and I would definitely stay here again upon returning to this lovely city!"
1090449,4910859,2013-06-01,6467505,Ben,"Chad and Ruben are easy to contact but gave us a lot of space and were never overbearing. Their apartment is clean and in a very nice, quiet part of Capitol Hill. "
1090449,4946723,2013-06-03,4693796,Debbie,We had a lovely stay here! Chad and Reuben are wonderful hosts-- super responsive and very friendly. The location is fantastic. A great place to stay when visiting Seattle!
1090449,5278200,2013-06-22,6371169,Lance,"Chad and Rueben's apartment was exactly as it was described online. It was very spacious, clean, and comfortable. This is a great place to stay if you want to explore Seattle. They were also very accomodating and ready to provide whatever I might need from the apartment. Recomended."
1090449,5398125,2013-06-28,6265223,S B Hadley,A great experience. The hosts were communicative and easy-going. The location was convenient to all the tourist attractions. I would definitely recommend this flat to other Airbnbers.
1090449,5722644,2013-07-13,7308390,Jon,"Great Capitol Hill location. Walking distance to restaurants and bars as well as downtown. Nice apartment, very clean and quiet."
1090449,5878638,2013-07-20,196444,Morgan,"Last minute we were stuck in Seattle without a hotel room! I messaged Chad and Ruben and they got back to me and had the place ready for us to move in, in under 2 hours! Once we got there, the place is adorable and had awesome little touches like a few local beers, an i-phone charger, lots of towels and a SUPER comfy bed! Also, they apartment has GREAT wifi (one network for the bedroom and another for the living room) AND entry was seamless with their door combo system! 

Beyond their apartment, its situated in a great little neighborhood with lots of cool and affordable restaurants and lots of fun vintage stores! 

If I get the chance to go back to Seattle again soon, I would 100% stay here again! "
1090449,5946798,2013-07-23,2284610,Alex,"A couple friends and I stayed with Chad & Ruben for our first visit to Seattle. It was great! The apartment was very roomy and clean, and the air mattress provided for larger groups is gigantic. They even left us a surprise gift that was very enjoyable -- I'm not going to spoil it...

It's very walkable to downtown Seattle and nightlife in Capitol Hill. We all had a great time staying here."
1090449,6013793,2013-07-26,6848514,Ranjan,"Chad and Ruben were really helpful. The place was nice and clean.
My wife and I lived with our two young boys for three nights. We felt the place was little too small for our family of four. May be the place is just right for two. 
I think the pictures on the website make the rooms look much larger than they actually are. Close to downtown helps but the parking can become extremely challenging at times. One evening, I spent more than 30 minutes looking for a suitable place to park. 
Very helpful hosts and a nice neighborhood.

1090449,6074146,2013-07-29,6214383,Stefanie,"Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. It was easy to communicate with them prior and during our visit, they are very well-organized (great door code system and helpful information in advance) and they made us feel very comfortable in their home. The apartment is really comfy, perfectly equipped and the location is just great. We enjoyed our stay very much, it couldn't have been any better!"
1090449,6216788,2013-08-04,1854537,Emily,"We loved our stay at Chad and Ruben's! The apartment was super clean, cute, and well located. While we didn't get a chance to meet Chad and Ruben, they checked in via email when we arrived to make sure we had all we needed. I mentioned that my husband and I were heading to Vancouver after Seattle, and they gave us some awesome tips on events happening in that city as well. Loved our stay - thanks guys!"
1090449,6277849,2013-08-06,1397318,Kyle,"Chad was great.  I rented his place for family to stay at during a wedding and he made the arrangements hassle free.  I also love that they use a keypad doorlock which removes the hassle of coordinating key pickup like many other Airbnb's.  
Also, a great location on Capitol hill with restaurants, shops & markets nearby and a very quick walk to downtown.  Definitely recommend!"
1090449,6363923,2013-08-10,6230226,Catherine,Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. The apartment was well kept and in a great location. I highly recommend this apartment!
1090449,6534094,2013-08-16,1938969,Jennifer,"We visited Chad and Reuben's suite with our 2 year old daughter.  This is a very affordable, clean, comfortable, nicely decorated suite.  The kitchen is well stocked, the linens are nice and the bed is very comfortable. 

The neighbourhood is one of the best places to stay in Seattle.  The restaurants and shops on Broadway are excellent.  We walked half an hour to all the main attractions in Seattle (or took the bus in 10 minutes).   Volunteer Park is within walking distance, which is a beautiful way to spend an afternoon.  

Chad was very easy to correspond with.   We didn't get a chance to meet him, however he texted us to make sure we settled in all right, and was open to any needs we had.  Parking is street parking, and can take a bit of time to find, but there was no problem for us in that - it was free, and we didn't have to drive in Seattle once we were there.  We love Capitol Hill!

We will recommend this place!"
1090449,6733536,2013-08-23,7411509,Lydia,"Chad and Reubens place was our first Airbnb experience.  We loved it.   We especially enjoyed the complete kitchen with a gas stove.  We walked down to Pikes Market everyday to buy ingrediants to come back and cook with!   Place was clean, neighborhood was quiet, and the bed was comfy!  Host's are good at communicating and made themselves availible if we needed.
  "
1090449,6943225,2013-08-31,8071699,Catherine,Chad & Ruben were great hosts! The apartment was the perfect place for us to stay - great size and location. Chad and Ruben were very responsive to all of our questions and provided great advice on neighborhood sites and eats. I'd highly recommend staying with them. 
1090449,7006410,2013-09-03,5382061,Jacob,Ruben and Chad were great hosts. I wouldn't hesitate to rent from them again!
1090449,7133143,2013-09-08,6559342,Jamie,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle and Chad and Ruben could not have been more accommodating. We were supposed to come in June but my husband got very ill. They were gracious enough to roll over our entire rent to September 2, 2013. I would highly recommend   the place."
1090449,7257512,2013-09-13,8336429,Michael,"Chad and Ruben's apartment was such a comfortable haven in which to reside for my visit. It is spacious for 1-2 visitors. Comfortable bed/room, great bathroom, well-supplied kitchen, great storage and comfortable and clean living room. I could not want for anything more on the inside. Outside it was the most convenient  spot to be; it was 2 short blocks to Broadway- the main drag on Capitol Hill, 2 minute walk to restaurants, bank, entertainment, taxi, bus.  It was 1 block to Olive Way which is a main connector to downtown Seattle.  There was construction on the little alley where the entrance to the apartment exists- there were earth moving vehicles, and noise, and Chad inquired to see if I was inconvenienced, and I was not. 
   Prior to my visit, Chad and Ruben suggested attractions for my first visit to Seattle- and that was so helpful. They seemed to be a lovely couple and I wanted to spend time with them, but alas, I was busy and they were as well.
   I want to return to Seattle again next year, and will wish to stay in this apartment again; this is my first experience with Airbnb, and it was terrific!"
1090449,7342916,2013-09-16,1718187,Stephen,"We had an amazing time at Chad & Ruben's! The listing was exactly as described and a perfect setting for myself and my two friends. Chad and Ruben were super friendly, organized and easy to communicate with from the beginning to the end of my stay, and were accommodating to any questions I had. The listing was extremely clean, and the bed and air mattress were very comfortable to sleep in. Although parking was a little tough, the location is perfect to walk around to Broadway and towards downtown. Highly recommend as they are 5-star hosts! "
1090449,7552523,2013-09-24,7763932,Jillian,"Great location in Capitol Hill. The apartment itself is nicely stocked with lots of towels and pillows, has an easy personalized-code entry system, and is definitely enough space for 2 people. One note is it that while the apt was neat and tidy, it wasn't lick-food-off-the carpet clean. As for the hosts, Chad and Ruben were very responsive and helpful, even providing a space heater one night when we were chilly. Would definitely recommend them."
1090449,7624227,2013-09-27,1939121,Heidi,"Chad and Ruben were perfect hosts. The place was as described, comfortable and very central. They even brought us extra blankets and towels. Thanks!"
1090449,7695846,2013-09-30,2488248,Ben,"Great location. Many friends indicated we may want a rental car in Seattle. But we were midwesterners in for a wedding who only wanted to eat and drink. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere we wanted. 

We really enjoyed the private set-up and keypad access made it easy for our whole party to feel free to move around. The apt was clean and ready for us with fresh linens and towels, couldn't have asked for more."
1090449,8044735,2013-10-14,8439891,Jennifer,"Chad & Ruben's place is extremly cozy. We had 4 people, and the provided airmatress was very comfortable. The location was a unique neighborhood, about a 30 minute walk to downtown. We did not get to meet our hosts, but they kept in good email contact prior to our arrival. I loved the key code system they provide to get into the unit. No keys required! Parking was a bit tricky, but it gave us a chance to see more of the neighborhood as we hunted for a spot."
1090449,8141680,2013-10-17,1176065,Karolina,"Chad and Ruben were excellent hosts. They were prompt and helpful in communications and had everything perfectly set up for our arrival. The apartment was wonderful - private, meticulously clean, beautiful, comfortable. I would certainly recommend their place to anyone visiting Seattle!"
1090449,8254937,2013-10-22,8714218,Paul,"Just returned home from spending 4 nights in Seattle and Chad & Ruben's apartment was the perfect place for us to stay.  As others have mentioned, the combination lock make it very convenient and we didn't have to worry about keys.  The apartment was very comfortable and the communication with Chad & Ruben was excellent.  Very convenient to restaurants and shopping on Broadway, just a short walk.  If you stay with them, highly recommend Analog Coffee Shop just two blocks away on Summit Ave.  We look forward to returning to Seattle and hope to stay here again."
1090449,9081047,2013-12-05,9700348,Kevin,I had a great experience with Chad and Ruben! This was my first time using Airbnb and they were extremely helpful in helping me understand the process. Their place was also very convenient and comfortable.
1090449,9987587,2014-01-23,71765,Giovanna,"Chad and Rubens home was just as advertised. Comfortable, safe and clean, easy to get to and has a super comfy bed. I'll stay again in the future!"
1090449,10042242,2014-01-27,3013239,Jared,"Friendly hosts who are super responsive by airbnbmail, a clean place, easy to pop in and out of, and a good price. All my wife and I could have hoped for on our trip to Seattle! "
1090449,10189500,2014-02-04,1407679,Hamad,Great place to stay. Wallking distance to many local restaurants and bars. The place itself is clean and very well decorated. I'd stay there next time I'm in Seattle.
1090449,10454901,2014-02-19,5766707,Laura,"My boyfriend and I just spent a fantastic three nights at Chad's and Ruben's apartment in Capitol Hill. The place itself was clean, well-decorated, and comfortable.  Because we arrived late at night, we very much appreciated the key-code door lock, which eliminated the hassle of exchanging keys. 

We also really enjoyed the neighborhood - staying here felt like having a home in Seattle. The location was quiet and peaceful during our stay, with little car traffic or other noise. The market, bars, and restaurants were convenient and delicious, with many options within walking distance. Try Kedai Makan if you're in need of some quick late-night eats -- we had the dal curry with roti TWICE because we liked it so much. We did not have a car during our stay, and were able to use several nearby bus lines. 

I did not have the opportunity to meet Chad and Ruben, but they responded to me quickly and cordially by email and text whenever I had questions. I highly recommend the two of them, and their apartment. They were perfect hosts. "
1090449,10504447,2014-02-22,12067636,Julie,"My friends and I stayed for two nights, and the overall experience was lovely. The place was clean and comfortable, no problem to find with the instruction given. Definitely recommend.   "
1090449,10580586,2014-02-25,7356518,Matt,"Stayed at their place for a long weekend, my first in Seattle. This apartment contributed to a stellar weekend. Access was easy, location is perfect and the apartment is perfect for a couple. Can't thank Chad and Ruben enough. "
1090449,10673715,2014-03-03,2299244,Ruth,"This is a charming and convenient apartment in a quiet neighborhood close to restaurants and within walking distance of downtown. Chad and Ruben were so kind and helpful -- they left a welcome gift of two very good beers in the fridge, and Chad came out on the street to make sure I got home safely when my cab stopped in the wrong place one night! The apartment is very clean, modern, and well decorated. It's on the ground floor with its own entrance. I enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay there again."
1090449,10826224,2014-03-09,2187925,Jana,This is the cutest apartment in a fantastic location!  it was so hassle free with the door code and perfect if you are visiting seattle without a car.  Definitely a winner!  
1090449,11030680,2014-03-17,623663,Meg,"Me and 3 friends stayed at Chad and Ruben's place and it was very comfortable, clean and quiet. They had everything ready for us upon arrival and were readily available if we were to run into any problems. They were ideal hosts."
1090449,11222440,2014-03-25,12299356,James,"Chad and Ruben were fantastic hosts! And their place was perfect for my purposes.

I'd recommend this place to anyone, and would certainly use is again if coming back to Seattle again."
1090449,11394309,2014-04-01,11123917,Maria,"Four of us stayed during the Emerald City Comic Convention... It was nice to have a place to stay away from the hustle and bustle, but only 5-10 mins away by bus. Chad & Ruben were great hosts & responsive to questions."
1090449,11623018,2014-04-09,13352874,Jo,"We had a lovely time in Seattle and Chad and Ruben were lovely. They have a sweet flat and was everything we needed. Thank you Chad and Ruben. We would definitely come again. Kind Regards, Jo and Sheila"
1090449,11731511,2014-04-13,14104507,Kimberly And George,"Well, hello to all of you who already use this terrific service.  We learned of Airbnb in a grocery store when we extended our stay in Seattle and our hotel room was no longer available. That night we searched through the possibilities and found Chad and Ruben's place.  With a great deal of help from a fantastic Airbnb rep. (as I am not great at technology) we were able to fill out our profile and information and secure a stay in their perfectly located apartment.  We found it exactly as they described and it suited us very well indeed!  Thank you so much for accepting our request with literally no notice and for being available to answer questions about the neighborhood.  Next time, we must meet to say hello!"
1090449,11989655,2014-04-21,4785645,Carrie,"This apartment was in a great location, pretty close to downtown and with lots of good bars and restaurants around. Loved the neighborhood. This apartment is kind of an ""in-law suite"" in a house, but it has a completely private entrance, and the keypad is perfect. Would definitely stay here again."

1090449,12338008,2014-04-29,11203645,Kirsty,"We had a great time here.  The apt is in a fantastic part of Seattle - quiet, leafy but close enough to the main streets to walk to go out.  Bus stop a block away to get downtown or only $10 in a taxi.  Apt was in good condition, really clean and plenty of room.  We were a party of 3 so used the airbed - it was like nothing I had seen before, it was huge!  Chad and Ruben were really quick at responding to emails as well.  Would recommend to anyone coming out."
1090449,12665956,2014-05-07,10243567,Iana,"Wonderful apartment in a great location, close to shops and cafes. Near the center. everything was perfect, would recommend to all."
1090449,12763163,2014-05-10,14865649,Keiko,"Chad and Ruben's place was a nice place to come back to after our days out in Seattle. Comfortable bed and big leather couch, clean throughout. The neighborhood was convenient -- we walked to many areas, although it was a long walk to Pike's Place. The Frye museum is nearby and is a lovely place to visit. We didn't meet C and R in person but they were prompt and helpful with messages prior to our arriving."

Although I didn't get to meet them, they kept in regular contact and were really helpful and responsive. Thanks for a great stay, guys! "
1090449,13875337,2014-06-07,1143523,Josh,"Chad & Ruben were amazing hosts. Everything about our experience has been nothing, but stellar. They are very responsive, friendly and helpful hosts throughout the whole process. They even went the extra mile and helped out with extra requests that we had. All in all, their place was spotless and in an amazing neighborhood. Would love to stay there again."
1090449,13950459,2014-06-09,13139153,Mary,"Chad an Ruben were wonderful hosts.  They were very informative and responded quickly to emails.  The place was tidy, cozy, and clean.  It was perfect for my friend and I.  The location was within walking distance to restaurants and shops and was a little over a 1 mile walk to Pike's Place.  I recommend not bringing a car since parking is tough to find - especially on Friday and Saturday evenings.  Overall, we had a wonderful visit and would stay at Chad and Ruben's place again.  I highly recommend!  "
1090449,14114478,2014-06-12,1474557,Christine,"I stayed here with my husband for 3 nights in early June. It was my first time to Seattle and I loved the proximity of Chad and Rueben's apartment to the downtown area. There are a few buses that run daily, but we mostly walked, since it was only about 1-2 miles to the things we were interested in seeing (plus walking those Seattle hills was great to balance out all the amazing food we were eating). It was so nice to be able to come ""home"" after a long day! The apartment had everything we needed - it was clean, the check in process was easy, the bed was comfortable, and there was a hair dryer in the bathroom as well as two bottles of water for us in the fridge. They are quick to respond and so accommodating. Thank you, Chad and Rueben, for contributing to a great trip to Seattle! "
1090449,14276766,2014-06-16,7131738,Jackie,Thanks guys for hosting our trip! The place was lovely and such a great location close to downtown in such a quaint neighborhood!

1090449,14517113,2014-06-21,19829,Stephanie,"We had a fantastic stay in Seattle and loved Chad and Reuben's home in Capital Hill.  Great location and lots to do.  We walked downtown easily.
Chad and Reuben are so friendly and helpful.  They were very quick to get back to us when we had a question.  Would definitely stay there again if we are ever back in the area!"
1090449,14737049,2014-06-25,2704374,Gina,"This apt was great for my short stay in Seattle! I love the Capitol Hill area; it only helps that it's a shortish downhill walk to the downtown area. Everything was clean and tidy; good communication with hosts, access code entry is helpful! Thanks!"
1090449,15135073,2014-07-03,13972524,Kevin,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Chad & Ruben's place on Capitol Hill. Their place was very clean, had a comfy bed, and a kitchen that allowed us to not have to eat out all the time. The location is fantastic and we were abel to walk most places or easily use Uber and Car2Go. The central location is great for seeing Seattle. 

We did not get a chance to meet Chad and Ruben but they were available if we needed anything and we would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle. "

It is a relaxing space with plenty of room, and it is just a quick walk to all the restaurants and shops of Capitol Hill.  We didn't meet Chad and Ruben in person, but they were in touch throughout the weekend to make sure we were set (they even messaged us directions with the best viewing location for the  4th of July Fireworks).  The keyless entry made checking in a breeze!"
1090449,15414062,2014-07-08,14019688,Michael,"We spent the remainder of our multi-location vacation reminiscing about our great stay at Chad & Ruben's!

Chad & Ruben were very accessible and helpful through the booking process and through our stay. 

The apartment was updated and very clean and tidy. The bathroom was modern and spacious. The neighborhood felt safe and was convenient to stores, restaurants, and bus stations.
"
1090449,15527854,2014-07-11,1976573,Lynda,"Great, central location.
The apartment was very well set up and comfortable to stay in. "
1090449,15751521,2014-07-15,14171999,Julie,We met Chad and Ruben shortly after we arrived and they were very welcoming and friendly. The apartment was everything we expected and Chad and Ruben had gone to the effort to leave us a fabulous welcome artwork on the whiteboard. We would definitely stay there again or recommend it to others.
1090449,15966342,2014-07-19,16831585,Nicole,"Chad and Ruben made my first Airbnb experience a great one. Everything was clean, comfortable and delivered as promised.

Even though we did not meet in person, all the instructions were well communicated and they promptly replied to questions I had via text.  The apartment was very clean, comfortable and well decorated.   The neighborhood was safe, quiet and an awesome area with wide selection of restaurants, coffee shops (close to the original Top Pot Doughnuts shop) and strolling the shops around Capital Hill.   The keypad lock on the front door made it very convenient to check in and never had to worry about a key.  Parking in the neighborhood was a bit of challenge but Chad & Ruben provided info on a nearby overnight parking garage,
and there are other nearby parking lots that have reasonable parking fees.
Overall great stay and location in Seattle!"
1090449,17555632,2014-08-14,1241829,Nicole,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chad and Ruben's apartment! 

It was extremely well situated close to great restaurants, markets, theatres, museums etc available at Capitol Hill, South Lake Union, Lake Union and the city which were all within easy walking distance as well as the Space Needle!

It was also a very easy walk to access car hire on Howell Street near Denny Way and then freeway entrances which were right there for day trips around Seattle and longer trips to Oregon.

The apartment was accurately described on the Airbnb site and was very comfortable and well supplied with linen as well as plentiful information for visitors and also had free wifi.

As we were visiting family we did not need to contact Chad and Ruben whilst we were there but they kept in close contact making sure our needs were met.

Thanks Chad and Ruben for a great stay!!"

Access to the unit was easy with excellent instructions and guidance for how to use the apartment. The location was perfect to visit our son get around town, and the neighborhood is fantastic. We felt very safe walking around at night. The apt. is quite large and the kitchen worked for what we needed; i.e. breakfast and full sized refrigerator.  The bed was quite comfortable. All in all it was more than advertised and we will definitely come back if we need a place to stay in Seattle."
1090449,18489337,2014-08-27,6548475,Navin,Great location and very comfortable apartment. 
1090449,18784820,2014-09-01,13233050,Nicholas,"This place was great. My friends and I were in town for a convention and the place was a short walk from the convention centre. There was a nice welcoming picture for us when we entered (complimented with a Godzilla). I would absolutely love to stay here again when I'm in the area. Very nice, very clean, felt like a home away from home. "
1090449,19118723,2014-09-07,5452222,Amanda,"We enjoyed staging in this lovely apartment in the convenient Capitol Hill location. It was very close to busses and was a friendly neighborhood overall. 

The apartment itself was clean and comfy and the hosts made sure that we got in ok but lent us privacy in the space. 

Great communication and accurate directions. Highly recommend. "
1090449,19673823,2014-09-16,16617860,Caitlin,"We loved staying at Chad & Ruben's place.  Very comfortable and clean.  Not much neighborhood noise and extremely convenient.  Only a couple blocks from Broadway street, which has nearly everything one might need, restaurants, grocery stores, bars, etc.  Very walkable neighborhood! I would highly recommend Chad & Ruben's place! They were a pleasure to work with! "
1090449,19838674,2014-09-19,20741705,Linda,"Sweet place! Actually bigger than it looks, with a spacious living room. Perfect for people coming in by air and shuttling into town. Difficult parking and two hour limits for people coming in by car. Lovely neighborhood, walkable to great dining and drinking establishments.We walked to Monsoon, Le Zinc, Kingfish Cafe, Anchovies and Olives, etc. Very clean, well kept, with nice touches. "
1090449,20006644,2014-09-22,17614703,Candice,"My boyfriend and I loved staying in Chad & Ruben's home! This was my first Airbnb rental so I was somewhat hesitant at first. However, they were very accommodating and made me feel really comfortable! Their home was exactly as advertised (it's actually a little bigger than in the pictures!).  The neighborhood was very central and close to everything. We either walked or took a short lyft/uber everywhere. This was my first time in Seattle and I went to celebrate my birthday. They even had a birthday card and a bottle of wine awaiting my arrival--so sweet! This was the best birthday ever! Thank you Chad & Ruben, we will be back!!! :)"
1090449,20338119,2014-09-28,8208015,Leon,"Chad and Ruben were very communicative and available from the moment I booked my first ever U.S. AirBNB experience with them.  Apartment ""instructions"" contained all the information one could want and the apartment itself was in a great location off a quite side street; plenty of coffee and food nearby.  Thanks for a great Seattle experience - would definitely recommend!  -LS"
1090449,20900314,2014-10-07,124427,Lee,"Chad and Ruben were awesome hosts.  Though I did not get the opportunity to meet them, we were in contact by phone and email.  The apartment was lovely and I was very surprised when I entered to find a beautiful flat screen tv.  Previously the listing did not include a tv, but it was nice since I didn't go out in the evenings.  The neighborhood was quiet, felt safe  and everything that I needed was within walking distance.  I was able to walk downtown but since the neighborhood is very high up, I opted to use Uber for the ride back.  Uber was wonderful and I would not hesitate to use again.  Drivers were friendly, cars were new and very clean, cheaper than a cab and some offered free bottled water.  So, I am definitely recommending Chad and Ruben as wonderful hosts for your next trip to Seattle."
1090449,21138569,2014-10-12,1286432,Michael,"Very nice place and very convenient location. All the amenities were perfect. The host were very responsive and helpful. Thank you. We loved the service and the place.

Parking problems though. Could be lucky and not have any problems. But if not so lucky you'd keep changing parking location and keep paying additional fees. Not a pleasure when parking expires at 6 am on saturday morning. Otherwise face tow away. "
1090449,21283270,2014-10-14,6176472,Ann,"This apartment was in a perfect location for our short visit to Seattle.  We were able to walk to the Pike Market (it's only 1 mile), however, if you take a cab, it's only about $9 to downtown.  There are plenty of restaurants, coffee shops and bars nearby.  Chad and Ruben were quick to reply to our requests.  The apartment has plenty of space for two people and it is well-equipment.    The neighborhood is quiet and charming and we felt totally safe walking at night.  "
1090449,22020396,2014-10-28,2690301,Danica,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chad and Ruben's apartment. Capitol Hill area is a safe and trendy neighborhood within walking distance to great restaurants, convention center and Pike's Market. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, nicely decorated and very convenient to check in/out. Chad and Ruben also respond very quickly to questions (ex. recommendations of places to eat). You might have to drive around a bit but we did find free parking on a nearby street which was great. If you want to bike around the city, there's Pronto bike sharing stand nearby and Volunteer Park close by. When we visit Seattle again, we will love to stay here again! Thanks again for a great trip, Danica & Scott "
1090449,22402288,2014-11-05,6368085,Songphan,"I really enjoyed staying at Chad and Ruben's.  The unit is cosy and clean.  The amenities are sufficient for staying for a few days to a week.  The neighborhood and location is great, quiet, safe, and easy access to restaurants, shoppings, and even downtown.  Although I had a problem with wifi on the last day of the trip, they responded promptly.  I would stay here again if I have a chance to come back to Seattle."
1090449,22531302,2014-11-09,2898992,Frank,"Exact as described. Solid place, great location. Chad is awesome and will check in to see your trip went smoothly.  Very clean, well kept. Excellent all around. "
1090449,22680852,2014-11-11,15683994,Steven,"Fantastic experience!  Place was clean and comfy and very conveniently located.  Chad and Ruben were very helpful and accessible - we arrived in town early, and really appreciated them storing our bags until our place was ready.  Highly recommended.  "
1090449,23632810,2014-12-07,1341424,Melissa,"Chad an Ruben's place was nice and comfy! The area was pretty cool for wandering around too. Checking in and out was straight forward, recommended stay!"
1090449,23965814,2014-12-15,24268352,Will,"We had a very positive experience. It's a nice studio (first floor) apartment on an alley. The location can't be beat, and it is spacious for a 1BR apartment (perfect for a family with one or two small kids). The hosts are very professional. The accommodations are not luxurious, but things were clean and functional. Parking is very difficult in the neighborhood (especially if you arrive, as we did, on Saturday night), but that's because it is a desirable neighborhood. "
1090449,25025421,2015-01-05,7244123,Mads,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Ruben and Chad's lovely apartment in Capitol Hill. The apartment was the perfect place for our getaway to Seattle and the diverse neighborhood was even better. We enjoyed every aspect of it and will definitely recommend it to others who are going to Seattle. We were in communication with our hosts throughout the stay and they gave good recommendations etc., which made us feel welcome. 

The apartment was clean, fresh and new and had all the amenities you could wish for. It was also really quiet and just a short walk from downtown. Grocery shopping and restaurants were just a 5 min walk away.

Thanks!"
1090449,25627912,2015-01-21,22243193,Lia,"We arrived in Seattle to a light drizzle and a loaned umbrella & cute welcome note in the kitchen from Chad & Ruben. This was our first time using Airbnb, and throughout the week we were in town, our hosts were quick to respond to any requests (e.g. ""where is the hairdryer?"" and ""we're out of toilet paper!"") The biggest issue we had was that some of the dishes in the kitchen were dirty (glasses with lip marks, bowls with crusted food). Chad & Ruben immediately picked up the items and offered up replacements, as well as a gift card as an apology.

The unit itself was itty bitty, but served as a fine crash pad after a long day of exploring the city. While there is a coat closet in the living room, there are no other drawers for unpacking smaller clothing. However, the bathroom had ample storage space and the TV was a nice surprise when we felt like spending a night in with some take-out.

The location of this unit is perfect – close enough to everything exciting that we could walk everywhere, but removed enough that we didn't have a noise issue, even with the bedroom right on the street level.

Overall, Chad & Ruben were lovely hosts and the apartment was perfectly serviceable. Thanks for a great week!"
1090449,25771457,2015-01-25,26307856,Sara,We absolutely loved our stay at this comfy 1 bedroom home. We had 2 people the first night then added another two for the second night. The air mattress was comfortable. WiFi connection strong. You have a full kitchen as well as large bathroom well equip with plenty of towels. The check in/check out process was seamless and hosts communicative. The location is ideal and we plan on staying here again in the future. We would definitely recommend this place to our family and friends. Thanks C&R!  
1090449,26463206,2015-02-13,6212486,Nigel,"The listing was accurate. The apartment also featured a large flat screen TV. Chad & Ruben were extremely helpful and I greatly appreciated the welcome sign upon entering the apt! The Apt was fully furnished, incl. all kitchen utensils and requirements

The apt is located perfectly for getting around capitol hill and nearby. I would definitely stay again."
1090449,26856963,2015-02-21,14150065,Damian,"What an excellent bachelor pad for a week.  This unit is very well appointed and  in a great location within walking distance of  the CBD + the young and groovey & GLBT style of Broadway & Capitol Hill. As a country visitor I was in heaven.

Note to all to read instructions properly before arriving, which I did not do but thanks to Starbucks nearby i was able to  get some wifi and check it out correctly.
The apartment has everything you could possibly want as well as being safe and sound.
Recommend for a couple or a single seeking urban activities

1090449,27890314,2015-03-14,27166890,Clint,"Chad and Ruben are awesome hosts! Very accommodating and comfortable space. Great location too, convenient to everything. Would highly recommend the city for vacation and this Airbnb listing specifically."
1090449,28356724,2015-03-22,11616918,Erik,Chad and Ruben were very helpful and welcoming with a last-minute booking. The apartment is very nice and well-located. We had a very pleasant stay. (Thanks to you both!)
1090449,28518014,2015-03-25,26814574,May,"Chad and Ruben were great! Their place was super cozy with four people- comfy bed and blowup bed, clean kitchen and bathroom, and in a good location walking distance from cafés and bars. Would definitely stay again!"
1090449,28791703,2015-03-30,20288096,Julie,"Convenient neighborhood, easy walking distance.  Very lovely home.  Really comfy bed!"
1090449,29553047,2015-04-09,5033665,Nazaneen,"Fantastic stay with our 2-year-old.  Very conveniently located for those who like to walk, we even walked downtown and to Pikes Market etc.  Place is as advertised, and worked well with our toddler.  Only caveat is there is no door on the bedroom, wasn't a big issue for us though may be for others of you need that privacy.  Chad and Ruben were great hosts and have very thoughtfully set up the apt.  Would def stay there again.  "
1090449,29737873,2015-04-12,6533647,Lisa,"We enjoyed a two night relaxing stay at Chad and Ruben's apartment. It was just as everyone described. Communication with our hosts was easy via text and they always responded quickly. A sweet welcome sign greeted us and everything was clean and ready for our stay.  Check in (and out) was no problem at all. The apartment is very nicely decorated, has dimmable lighting and the leather sofa and chair are easy to sink into.  They have a large flat screen tv which was a plus. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom had nice towels and the kitchen was well equipped.  We were able to prepare and enjoy a delicious dinner.  Although it is located on the street level you don't hear much noise. Its a great location, walkable to most everything.  We were very pleased to find such a lovely place to stay and will hopefully be back soon.  "
1090449,30322966,2015-04-20,7172045,Ann,"Our stay at Chad and Ruben's was wonderful.  The one-bedroom was cozy and comfortable.  Chad was really helpful with several questions we had.  We'd recommend their space to anyone visiting Seattle.  The location was terrific...close to restaurants and the downtown area.  Thanks again, guys!

1090449,30863892,2015-04-28,27425905,Matthew,"TL;DR : I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else when I visit Seattle.

This was the perfect place for our week's stay in Seattle. Lovely accommodations in Capitol Hill - a surprisingly quiet neighborhood considering the abundance of shops and local restaurants. We were made to feel welcome and the hosts were available for any questions we had while allowing us complete privacy.  Most everything we wanted to do was in short walking distance, and even downtown was only a 25 minute walk from the door. Though, coming back from downtown you may want to take an Uber if you have an aversion to hills. 

We originally had a rental car for our stay even though the hosts warned us that parking in the immediate area would be difficult. Unless you absolutely need to spend significant time away from the apartment across town we found keeping track of the rental more trouble than it was worth. Taxis/uber tended to be far cheaper and less stressful to get around when we needed to stray far from home."
1090449,31234893,2015-05-03,17827465,Derek,Chad & Ruben had an excellent home for us to stay! It was well located and nearby parking was available. The unit lived up to its description perfectly! We found it to be the perfect size and location -very comfortable and cozy. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Capitol Hill!
1090449,31609781,2015-05-07,8219655,Rob,"Fantastic apartment and great location. I stayed here on a business trip as the hotels in Seattle are scarce and expensive this time of year. It shattered my expectations - the apartment was well kitted out with everything I needed, but also made me feel like I was somewhat on a mini vacation.
The location is great, just a block and a half from Broadway which is where everything is restaurants, supermarket etc.
"
1090449,31894270,2015-05-11,19346281,Jenine,"Two of my girlfriends and I spent a weekend in Seattle at Chad and Ruben's apartment. It was just the right place for us as it was close to the dance studio that we needed to go to as well as within walking distance to Pike Place Market and the museums during our breaks from the dance festival. Their place was a bit on the small side but it was perfect for 3 people with just enough space for everyone to place their things, have room to move around, and get a great night's rest after a day of dancing. Chad and Ruben have been such gracious hosts. We didn't need anything extra from them but it was great to know that they were willing to help us by being just a text message away. We really enjoyed our stay and we hope to be back in Seattle soon!"
1090449,32326907,2015-05-17,23469908,Anne,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Chad and Ruben's Capitol Hill apartment. The apartment was exactly as shown in pictures and the hosts were responsive from beginning to end. The apartment truly is walking distance from so many wonderful Seattle bars, restaurants and coffee shops. We also walked to Pikes Place Market which was a little bit of a hike but completely doable. Would recommend this adorable apartment to friends and stay again in a heartbeat. Thanks for having us!"
1090449,32969341,2015-05-24,12350178,Rebecca,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was great size, very clean and quiet. The location was in close walking distance to bus stops and a great Starbucks. The food recommendations we tried were all fantastic as well. Would definitely stay here again, great communication the whole time with any questions we had."
1090449,33393851,2015-05-27,6848974,Richie,"Although Chad and Reuben were out of town during our stay, they did a great job of preparing for our stay and accomodating our needs. Their place was tucked away, but perfectly situated in a lively neighborhood. It had everything we needed. Thanks guys ;) "
1090449,34059680,2015-06-04,5488778,Fangran,"I'm really glad that I stayed in Chad and Ruben's apartment instead a hotel. The apartment was a really cozy and clean space and located in a very convenient neighborhood--just steps away from bus stop, grocery store, restaurants, etc.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!!"
1090449,34625583,2015-06-10,12267397,Joseph,This apartment is very convenient to all of Capitol Hill and a very easy bus ride to downtown as well as the Space Needle.  The keyless entry made everything easy. Very quiet at night! Thank you Chad and Ruben!
1090449,35205358,2015-06-16,29712656,Vicki,The listing description was very accurate and the hosts definitely made us feel welcome! We had everything we needed. We were able to go to the grocery store and save money by going out to eat since there is a fully stocked kitchen. Capitol Hill has great restaurants and is close to everything we wanted to see in Seattle.
1090449,35904506,2015-06-23,26660821,Tony,"Chad and Ruben's apartment was well located, next to a vibrant community but quiet and relaxing. Just a short walk to lots of shops and restaurants and walking distance to the main attraction (although public transport is easy if you prefer not to walk).

The apartment was well equipped and clean and ad an extremely comfortable bed. The apartment exceeded our expectations and was far better than staying in a hotel.

We did not have a lot of contact with Chad and Ruben but each time we did contact them they responded very quickly and we're really helpful in providing recommendations for restaurants.

All in all a great experience and we'd definitely recommend it."
1090449,36160214,2015-06-25,31695360,Hae Yoon,Chad and Ruben greeted my family with a warm welcoming note. The apt was much closer to downtown than i thought. It was like 5 mintues drive to the market place. And the apt matches with the descriptions very accurately. It was a one bedroom basement apt with a kitchen and a bathroom. My family and I had a very pleasant stay at Chad & Ruben!
1090449,36658925,2015-06-30,28225210,Jason,"Chad and Ruben were fantastic hosts! They were very quick to reply to our messages and were accommodating/flexible with our travel times. The suite was comfortable (especially during some very warm days!) and the central location was incredibly convenient. We would definitely recommend their home to our friends and family, and will certainly look them up, again, when we plan our next visit to Seattle!"
1090449,37300182,2015-07-06,26481852,Jason,"Chad & Reuben were great hosts.  They communicated wonderfully with us and were always available if we needed anything.  The house itself is great and just the right size for us.  More importantly, the location of the home is perfect for the first time visitor that doesn't mind losing turn down service for feeling immersed in the local vibe.  We were able to walk to just about everywhere, including a 4 mile hike to Leschi and the lake that I don't recommend if you aren't a seasoned hiker.  Closer to home, Broaway is two blocks up the hill and has every restaurant and store you could possibly need.  Also Dick's famouse hamburger joint is three minutes from the front door and open til 2AM, go there, you will like it.  There was a great little independent coffee shop two blocks down and a Starbucks within a minute or two.  You could spend your entire time in this little neighborhood hanging out.

But more importantly, you can walk or take an affordable car service on a quick trip to downtown, Seattle Center, U of W and just about anywhere else.  We were able to walk to a lot of our destinations, see them and then take a car back everyday without breaking the bank.  And with the small kitchen, you're able to get some staples or even cook for yourself if you don't want to go out for dinner.  And during the 4th of July, you can follow the locals down the street to watch the fireworks without trying to fight the crowds at one of the larger venues.

Nice touches to the room were having a ROKU, WiFi, a super comfy air mattress, and keypad entry that meant no one had to keep up with a key.  

I'd definitely tell anyone I knew to stay with Chad & Reuben in Seattle.  "
1090449,37952389,2015-07-12,11324830,Kimberly,"My husband and I had a great stay in Seattle.  The apartment was on a quiet street in Capitol Hill very close to many restaurants and shops. Was also an easy walk downtown/pikes place.  We also had a car and easily found parking. The apartment was clean and nicely decorated, very comfy bed and couch.  The hosts were easy to get in touch with and always responded quickly.  Would stay there again. "
1090449,38372909,2015-07-15,10450899,Phil,"The apartment worked out very well for our trip to Seattle. The living room was spacious and the kitchen well-appointed.  Access to the apartment was easy and the owners were professional and experienced AirBnBers.  The neighborhood is great and we walked everywhere...Broadway, the heart of Capitol Hill was a few blocks away, and even Pike Place was a pleasant 30 minute walk downhill. "
1090449,38639530,2015-07-17,28733193,Kevin,"Great location. Very close to my favorite italian restaurant altura. Value for the money. Love the place, it is cozy. Love to stay here again."
1090449,39738857,2015-07-26,29280566,Kim,"Chad and Ruben were wonderful hosts. They kept in great contact with us prior to our trip. We were very impressed with their promptness and detail in answering our questions. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described. It was very clean and newly updated. The kitchen was fully equipped, which allowed us to eat in a couple of meals to save a little money. The location of this apartment gave us access to unlimited things to see and do. We felt very safe in this neighborhood and walked just about everywhere. We hope to stay here again in the future!"
1090449,40326805,2015-07-30,2456743,Cynthia,"I had an amazing experience in Chad and Ruben's house, the apartment was very cleaned and organized.
On top of that the location is great, we could walk to space needle and downtown, if you looking for night life and good restaurants this place has the perfect location."
1090449,40913864,2015-08-03,16398812,Kevin,"The place is just as described - great location, pleasant apartment, communicative hosts. Would definitely stay there again. "
1090449,41493349,2015-08-07,39744132,Sudon,The place is clean and the location is very convenient to explore the downtown Seattle. Chad and Ruben gave us very flexible check out time to make my trip easier and great. 
1090449,42288939,2015-08-12,290444,Alan,Chad and Ruben were a pleasure to deal with.  Great communication and responsiveness.  Our stay was brief but everything went smoothly. 
1090449,42849016,2015-08-16,34872525,Amy,This place was fantastic! The location of the apartment is convenient and safe. It is right near Olive Avenue and Broadway. Several options to eat and drink in the vicinity. The apartment itself was spacious and clean. Chad and Ruben are great hosts! They respect your privacy but are also available if you have questions. If we come back to Seattle we would definitely want to stay here again. 
1090449,43653064,2015-08-21,2000549,Linda,"We had a great stay at Chad and Rubens apartment. It's in an excellent location, just a few blocks from a great coffee shop (Analog Coffee) and plenty of great food choices too (Kedai Makan and Tacos Chukis were our favs). We got into town to see all the sights very easily on buses. Communication was great and check in was a breeze. "
1090449,44284923,2015-08-25,16450024,Fiona,"Chad & Ruben's place was amazing. It was everything we had expected it to be and we truly appreciated how flexible Chad & Ruben were with check-in. We loved the Capitol Hill area as it was very cozy-feeling and an overall nice place to walk around. The people around the area were nice and Chad & Ruben's place was close to Downtown and to all of the places we wanted to go to. Our Uber rides averaged around $5-$7 just to go to certain places downtown, so very affordable! There was also various Zipcars available for use around Chad & Ruben's place, so the location was just perfect for us.  In addition, Chad & Ruben's place was the perfect size for my guest and I. We loved the living room area as it had a large couch for us to relax and watch TV and the bed was comfy as well. We were very thankful for everything Chad & Ruben had provided, especially the extra blankets as my guest and I found Seattle to be slightly colder than we had expected. Overall, we highly recommend Chad & Ruben's place if you plan on visiting Seattle. Chad & Ruben were so accommodating and we really appreciated how helpful they were with anything we needed. Thanks, Chad & Ruben!"
1090449,45243499,2015-09-01,9123221,Devon,"Chad and Ruben were great to communicate everything I needed to know for my family's stay in their apartment. It was a fantastic home base for our trip to Seattle. The place was quiet, cozy, and a short walk from downtown. We loved it!"
1090449,45581114,2015-09-04,10731813,Angela,"Thank you both very much, we were made to feel very welcome and you were very accommodating :) The location is great to get a bit more of the local feel and an easy walk to downtown. "
1090449,45818319,2015-09-06,17149425,Celeste,Chad and Ruben's apartment was very clean and centrally located. Checking in and out was simple thanks to great directions and communication. We enjoyed our experience and would definitely stay with Chad and Ruben again.
1090449,46496662,2015-09-11,40423707,Susannah,The apartment was small and convenient if a little dark
1090449,47697266,2015-09-21,21229841,Geoff,"I had absolutely no complaints about this listing. It was exactly as described, clean, and well kept. The apartment was quite comfortable (as titled) in both size and functionality, and it did not take long to start to feel like home. The kitchen had all of the items that you would need to prepare food and was very well suited for the light breakfast or lunches I made before heading out to explore. 
I'm not sure it would be possible to have a better all around location with short walks to downtown, pike place, Seattle center, and capitol hill, not to mention the variety of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars located near by. I walked nearly everywhere I went during my stay and did not once feel nervous or uncomfortable about the neighborhood and surrounding area. 
If I did have a car with me street parking would have been a bit difficult, but from what I came to understand finding parking is a universal problem throughout Seattle. Besides, with a location like this why would you need to drive at all?
I did not get to meet either Chad or Ruben, but I am sure they would be very nice people. The listing was ready on time, their messages were quite prompt and polite, and there were no problems at all during my stay. You would be lucky to be able to book this listing for your trip."
1090449,48929011,2015-09-29,16072837,Philipp,"Our stay at Chad & Ruben was great. It was super clean, located in a great Area (with great restaurants nearby). 

Communication with Chad&Ruben was easy and very fast. 

We can recommend Chad & Ruben and their flat for 100%. We had a great stay."
1090449,50182554,2015-10-10,1882586,Greg,"The apartment is great: very clean, ample space, fantastic neighborhood, and a good value.

We'd definitely rent again, but a few things to know:

The bedroom faces the street, and there's occasional street noise, especially if the windows need to be open.

Some changes of level inside that take a bit of getting used to.

The water pressure in the shower is amazing, but the shower stall is a bit cramped.

The kitchen is fully equipped with dishes, pots, pans, and utensils, but if you're going to cook, bring condiments, spices, etc. - not much here."
1090449,51023852,2015-10-17,10219457,Virley,"I loved staying at Chad & Reuben's! It was perfectly located, I walked everywhere! I enjoyed a nice 3 mile run to the space needle in the morning. They were steps away from great restaurants, bars, and a 24/7 supermarket. Their place was beautiful, clean, and as pictured. Although, I didn't realize there was no door for the bedroom haha. Overall, great place, no issues at all. I'd recommend to anyone! "
1090449,51956157,2015-10-25,30999122,Amanda,Chad and Ruben were extraordinary! We were greeted by a sign in the kitchen and a listing that was exactly what we were expecting! The location is in walking distance of so many wonderful spots. We took Lyft the entire trip and the most expensive ride was $7!!!! You really can't beat this! 
1090449,53421723,2015-11-08,25510074,Jerek,"The apartment was very clean and nice. close to everything. We really didn't need a car. Nice area and i enjoyed the walk thru town. I never met the host, but their  response to my questions was very prompt. I will stay again"
1090449,54767536,2015-11-23,6288229,Angel,"Chad and Ruben are great hosts! They gave precise detail on how to get into the apartment and are extremely fast at replying to all messages. The apartment is just as the descriptions and pictures show, and then some. It is located right in the midst of busy Capitol Hill, where some of the best bars and restaurants are located, but off to small side streets, so you can come home to peace and quiet. The neighborhood is very hip and safe.
The bed and pillows are memory foam and super comfortable. When you move, it does not disturb the person sleeping on the other side. There is also a rain shower head in the shower that has amazing water pressure. The apartment has a Nest thermostat, so the entire place was always the perfect temperature upon coming home from the cold. There is actually a nice little flat screened TV with Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV, in the living room. One of the best parts of the apartment was probably the L-shaped couch. It was so comfortable that our friend decided to sleep there all 5 nights instead of getting the inflatable mattress out.
The price really can't be beat for the convenience of the location. I highly, highly recommend staying at Chad and Ruben's listing."
1090449,56273266,2015-12-11,44792735,Paul,"Excellent location, nice size, a steal at the price. It's a little cozier with the street than I might otherwise choose, but that's not too noticeable except when the windows are open."
1090449,56794626,2015-12-18,952292,Andy,Chad and Ruben's place was great for our 2 night stay in Seattle. They were great to communicate with and getting in/out of the apartment was really straightforward. Recommended!
1090449,57064209,2015-12-21,15029406,Kevin,"Although we didnt really get to meet Chad & Ruben it was overall a very pleasant stay for us. The place is central and very conviniently located, and everything was very prepared for. We checked ourselves in and out with the instructions provided hassle free. Only thing I'd say is that it's in a basement so sound proof isnt ideal. But I guess we are early sleepers so that is why...if you dont sleep like us around 10:30pm this wont be a problem at all for you. Also wish Seattle's weather could be nicer!!

Chad & Ruben are very awesome hosts definitely will recommend this place to my other friends who will pay Seattle a visit in the future. "
1090449,57977600,2015-12-30,33356626,Christine,"The apartment was really nice, clean and conveniently located. Chad and Reuben were really great to work with. We have two kids and they could play and run/crawl around. The Netflix and wifi was really great too. I would absolutely recommend staying there! "
955506,3920939,2013-03-27,522959,Michael,"We had a great experience at Matthew's place.  It is spacious, clean and comfortable.  The location is very convenient - close to the 5 freeway, and a short walk to the restaurants and shops around Green Lake.  Matthew was very responsive, and available if we needed anything - which we did not.  I would definitely stay here again, and have already recommended his place to a friend.  "
955506,4458685,2013-05-06,4016681,Kate,"Beautifully appointed, and immaculate, main (upper) level of a cottage, about 6 blocks north of Green Lake, and just 1 block away from Aurora Ave. (a main thoroughfare that runs straight into downtown).  Street parking was good - never had to park more than a short block away.  Best of the 3 airbnb places we've stayed at in Seattle.  Thanks Matthew!"
955506,5159530,2013-06-16,2347650,Janice,"We enjoyed our stay at Matthew's cozy bungalow.  It was great to be close to the lake and close to our Seattle family.  The home was well appointed, clean, and very comfortable.
Thank you, Matthew

955506,5873802,2013-07-20,7335677,Renee,"The home was beautifully decorated and a delight to stay in.  It was very clean and comfortable.  I loved the house and the yard.  I will definitely stay here again.  .  I stayed one night at the Decca Hotel and this house was 100 times better.  Great house, great location."
955506,5904055,2013-07-22,3995641,Sara,"The bungalow was perfectly located, within walking distance of Green Lake.  The place is clean, bright, and the kitchen was well equipped.  The bedding was all in excellent shape, and the beds were very comfortable.  Will definitely stay again.  "

955506,7190512,2013-09-10,2054970,Teri,Spent 6 days at the cozy bungalow in conjunction with our daughter's wedding. It felt like our home away from home and was very enjoyable.
955506,12389057,2014-04-30,14020372,Conny,The reservation was canceled 79 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
955506,12415001,2014-05-01,14609447,Tom,Matthew's bungalow was a perfect place for my daughters and me.  It was exactly as described in the listing and Matthew was a perfect host.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
955506,13622847,2014-06-01,7379729,Tim,"We really enjoyed our stay! 
What a lovely place... clean and bright, couldn't fault it. 
Perfect location, lovely street, very near the lake. 
Would without doubt stay there again.

955506,14974634,2014-06-30,1093631,Dan,Great house in a fantastic neighborhood! Matt was very helpful. The house was clean and comfortable. We would definitely come back again.
955506,15315532,2014-07-07,3963056,Don,"We enjoyed our stay at Matthew's place.  He was very responsive and easy to  communicate with.  The location was convenient to the wedding we attended, plus we were 4 blocks from where our relatives were staying.  We especially appreciated the private parking spot in the alley.

We appreciated the stylish decor and furnishings in the house.  The house was a perfect compliment to our Seattle trip!  "
955506,28764764,2015-03-29,1121760,Tom,Matthew's house was cozy and comfortable. 
955506,33946154,2015-06-02,17181241,Ashley,"Matthew's house is incredible. If you have an appreciation for clean, vintage inspired design, warning: you will absolutely fall in love with his place and never want to leave. My friend and I were at the Bungalow for 2 weeks and it felt like home. Matthew himself is so welcoming and his house is spacious and comfortable and in a very sweet, quiet little neighborhood. We loved being so close to the lake, and the house is perfectly in between the 2 main freeways by just a few blocks. There's a great little coffee shop in the neighborhood, as well as a ton of good restaurants in the area. The house has a big window in front which was one of my favorite things about it, and a cozy couch and chairs to sit on while sipping your morning coffee. If you'd rather be outside, the back porch is amazing. My friend and I made many meals in those two weeks we were visiting and ate most of them there. There is also a fire pit in the backyard that Matthew encouraged us to use (and of course, we did), a BBQ and a little garden. The rooms are clean and very tranquil. Again, the design details in this house will make you feel like you're staying in a West Elm showroom. It's truly beautiful. We had such a great time there, and Matthew was more than helpful in recommending great restaurants/ cafes and outdoor activities to check out during out stay. You will not be disappointed if you stay at the Greenlake Bungalow!"
955506,36531647,2015-06-29,25243330,Lesley,"Matthew met us as we arrived at his home. He was very warm and welcoming. The area is lovely with lots of lovely trees and was close to our grandchildren, which was wonderful. It is close to Green Lake where you can take lovely walks.
The pictures are very accurate."
955506,37567005,2015-07-08,1675458,Shehla,"Matthew's Bungalow has great location and great esthetics! Comfortable living area.
Beds/bedding were comfortable and would have made for comfortable nights, had it not for the heat wave Seattle experienced while we were there. To make matters worse, the only operational window in one of the bedroom was broken and wouldn't open beyond a crack.
Our other disappointed was the designated parking spot mentioned in the listing was not available. We had to find a spot on the street, which was not hard, specially, during the day, but became increasingly difficult after 5pm.
The last gripe was, fresh towels were not available when we checked in late afternoon. They were still in the washer, and, Matthew asked us to run them in the dryer. Finding a stray sock with the load was an unwelcome surprise!"
955506,40088450,2015-07-28,1522448,Jeffrey,"Mathew has a beautiful home, spacious windows and a fantastic covered deck off the kitchen which is a great space in good weather. Beds are great.   Wonderful place, great location.  "
955506,41075909,2015-08-04,33403289,Tom,Matthew was very attentive to our needs and welcoming. Very easy to interact with. The home was comfortable and we felt right at home. He always responded to us very quickly and was an excellent host.
955506,42150745,2015-08-11,6464900,Susan,Matthew was very attentive - nice place - good location - perfect for the four of us!
955506,55117985,2015-11-28,8324745,Cynthia,"Matthew was a wonderful host. His house is lovely, well-decorated, clean and extremely comfortable.  We especially loved the working fireplace!  Matthew was always available- he was quick to reply to all my texts and emails. I highly recommend staying at Matthew's home!"
955506,57649738,2015-12-28,2153685,Sheila,"This was a great rental. Adorable 2 bed/1ba in a great neighborhood.  Matthew was extremely helpful and even provided us with a Christmas tree!  The house is charming and has been nicely updated. We had a great  Christmas week visiting our son and I was able to cook a full Christmas dinner and a belated Hanukkah latke dinner as well  Had a couple small problems with the tv and heat but Matthew came over very promptly to fix. Close to Green lake which is a great walk and definitely go to Duke's for wonderful chowder and seafood. Highly recommend

9652574,55334656,2015-11-29,15863803,Ankur,Great experience. Adrian is very friendly.
6961346,48622817,2015-09-27,44115932,Jay,Bright funky space in a cool building. Katrina was very accommodating and gave us some tips on local hot spots. Fresh fluffy white towels and homemade muffins were a nice touch!
6961346,48966520,2015-09-29,19659153,Gokhan,"Place is in the perfect location by Queen Anne neighborhood. You can walk to one of the top rated restaurants in the country for breakfast. Katrina was very helpful, left us toothbrush, shampoo, body wash, conditioner and two very sweet cats :)  I will definitely stay here again. "
6961346,49060979,2015-09-30,3553325,Mei,"It was really nice stay here, the host Katrina is very friendly and very helpful, and kind enough to accept my last minute change on the check in time. Both cats in the house are adorable, lovely. And Katrina even left some homemade muffins for me, made me feel like so much at home, thanks to her, I have a wonderful night in the place. "
6961346,49925791,2015-10-07,4202859,Josh,"Katrina was an awesome hostess and really went the extra mile to make us feel welcomed and comfortable. The apartment itself was small but adorable and made for a relaxing stay. It's close to some great touristy things for the daytime if that's what you're looking for as well as some delicious restaurants and fun nightlife. Overall, I would definitely recommend. "
6961346,51223899,2015-10-18,44307992,Barry,"Katrina has a charming studio located on a main bus line through the Queen Ann neighborhood just north of downtown Seattle with kitchen and breakfast alcove. A bed is hidden in what was a walk-in closet with window. Two friendly cats complete the experience. Food, shopping and things to do are nearby. Katrina has stocks some goodies for her guests.

I found the bed very comfortable, but it is soft. If you are one of those people that needs a very firm bed, this studio may not be for you. While the mattress is soft, there are no springs or sagging. It is a bit like sleeping in a cloud! I generally prefer firm mattresses but had no problem at all. 

Everything was clean and well maintained. The ventilation is good. There's electric heat if you need it. One night the cats toppled the flowers, that was the only problem. Not a big deal. 
"
6961346,51481304,2015-10-20,22422513,Ami,"Terrible. Long story short, she cancelled our reservation at the very last minute. By the time we found out she cannot host us (6pm), we were already in Seattle with suitcases and had to look for an alternative hotel for THAT night. We ended up with paying more and staying at a shitty hotel. (You know downtown Seattle is not cheap to stay)  

She said her room had a plumbing emergency and got locked out. I really think she was in a trouble and feeling very sorry for us. She was so nice in e-mails, she even offered a ride from the ferry terminal (which she did not show up, though). However, for the fact that my friend came all the way from Japan to enjoy her trip, I was very very disappointed and pissed off. 

Of course I requested a full refund already. "
6961346,51945912,2015-10-25,16515240,Kevin,"Katrina's appartment is good located (15min walking distance from the Space Needle) and well equiped. 
However the bedroom is a bit cramped.
Katrina is very welcoming and flexible regarding check in and check out. Plus she stayed available for any request.
We recommend this place for visiting Seattle."
6961346,52766798,2015-11-01,13874136,Zack,"She was very thoughtful- we didn't use most of it, but there were spare phone chargers, toothbrushes, etc. It was pretty casual, but I was impressed overall. She was also very flexible with our shifting schedules."
6961346,53146249,2015-11-05,9632244,Hannah,"Katrina was very welcoming. She graciously picked us up from the airport and on our drive offered lots of suggestions for restaurants and bars in her neighborhood and beyond. She was very punctual with her responses, and available as needed during our stay. The neighborhood, Queen Anne, was easily accessible to other parts of the city, and also has its own perks such as cafes and restaurants. 

Katrina's home was cozy and she was ready for guests - she provided us with small toiletries and clean towels. I did find that I had some problems with my allergies. While we kept the door to the bed closed, it is worth noting that if you have had difficulties with pet/cat allergies in the past - this may not be the best spot for you. "
6961346,53265573,2015-11-07,40322155,Deborah,"Katrina is just the nicest, most open and accommodating host I could imagine, and her place is immaculate, roomy, and SO comfortable!  She has mastered the apartment space beautifully, and the bed space is exceptionally comfy and cozy while still being roomy.  Katrina goes out of her way to provide any amenity you might need, from forgotten toiletries to local recommendations.  Lots of great small touches that made us feel welcome and at home.   And she's super responsive if you message her with any questions.  The building itself is beautiful and the neighborhood is lovely and safe.  Public transportation, if desired, is a stone's throw away and there is an amazing nearby restaurant for breakfast or dinner.  Most fun of all are Katrina's cats - the MOST loving and adorably playful kitties you could want to spend time with if you need a kitty fix or just love cats.  We will absolutely be back for any future visits to Seattle! "
6961346,53384824,2015-11-08,30067415,Anna,Katrina was very welcoming and accommodating to our needs. She went out of her way to make us feel welcomed and comfortable and to make sure our stay at her place was the best experience possible. Her studio apartment is located in my favorite spot in Seattle and I could not have asked for a better experience for my husband and I for the evening. 
6961346,53996800,2015-11-15,6721892,Chad,"Katrina met us right at the door with a warm welcome and big smile! After a quick rundown, we were on our own in her cozy studio with her adorable cats! There were a couple times we needed to get ahold of her, and she was super quick to respond; she was also quick with recommendations of excellent spots in the Neighborhood: dead on with her recommendation for brunch at Toulouse Petite, Incredible! This a great little spot in the heart of my favorite neighborhood of Seattle."
6961346,54331620,2015-11-18,47420078,Brittany,Katrina was very nice & super helpful! Her place was nice and the bed was SO comfortable!
6961346,54869495,2015-11-25,41660998,Austen,We had such an awesome time in Seattle at Katrina's place! The location and space was absolutely perfect. Katrina was super hospitable and provided great local recommendations. The kitties were an added bonus---so sweet and cuddly! I would stay here again in a heartbeat  
6961346,55113163,2015-11-28,46117918,Yefim,"Had a very pleasant visit at Katrina's place, would stay again because of the location. It was convenient to be so close to downtown and within walking distance to many places. If you're allergic to cats, I'd think twice about staying here because the cats will try to sit on your lap. Otherwise, everything was great and the home was well-heated which was appreciated."
6961346,55566376,2015-12-02,38387081,Nathan,"I'm pretty conflicted on what was the better experience during my time in the heart of the city - Katrina, her 2 snuggle kittens or exploring Seattle. As a former Seattlelite, Katrina's place was in the perfect location which paved a lot of nostalgic memories (Tower Records, Supersonics, etc.). Her place was exactly as described. Has a very antique vibe mixed in with some modern elements (big screen gamer television) that blend in perfectly. She even went out of her way to bake me and my cousin cupcakes during our visit. I guess I kind of bribed her into it because it was my birthday and all. I would definitely recommend Katrina's place to anyone looking to stay in one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle. 10/10 would stay here again and snuggle the cats all day."
6961346,56030621,2015-12-08,5080211,Tram,"Upon arrival Katrina met us at the door and graciously took us up to her place to show us around. We had a few setbacks with the apartment (all of which were out of Katrina's hands), nonetheless our stay was pleasant. The television was broken during our stay, but Katrina refunded us money to make up for it. We really enjoyed cuddling with her cats during our 3 day stay. Parking can be a problem depending on the time of day. However, we always found a parking spot for the night. Overall her apartment suited us for our short stay. I would recommend staying there, especially if you like cats! "
6961346,56317830,2015-12-12,14864410,Eileen,I had a warm welcoming stay at Katrina's apartment. Check-in and check-out was super easy and smooth. The listing description was very accurate. The cats were super friendly and clingy. Overall the hospitality was great and had another amazing experience. 
6961346,56404449,2015-12-13,15860572,Sara,"Katrina was excellent communicating regarding key pick up and drop off. Her house was lovely and clean, and her two bow-tied cats make for excellent furry hosts!

"
6961346,56946517,2015-12-20,23955390,Erica,"Katrina was a wonderful host! We were traveling from Vancouver, WA to Seattle, WA to get all of our northern McMenamin's stamps for our McMenamins passports. We had arranged to met Katrina at the apartment at 2pm, but when we got to Centralia, we realized that we were missing a passport. Considering this was the main purpose for our trip, we didn't have much of a choice to turn around and go home to get it. When I notified Katrina of the change she was very accepting, and we met her at the apartment at 4pm to pick up the keys. I was very surprised  by the amount of free street parking; we didn't once have an issue getting a spot near the apartment. The apartment requires a main key to get into the building itself, we so we felt very safe during our stay. Katrina's studio is clean and bright, and I am very amazed at her dedication to minimalist living (I wouldn't be very good at it!). The space is a great size for a couple who is staying. The bed is a queen and is very comfortable, as is the comforter and pillows. The cats were fantastic....extremely lovable and cuddly. I love cats that give lots of attention, so to me, this was paradise! We didn't use the kitchen during our stay because we were out so much, but it was equipped with everyone one would need. I believe my only 'complaint' about the stay is that the water pressure of the shower is very low, but this is probably because of the age of the building. The shower head still has a good spread of water and it was not lacking in heat. I think we found that the towels were kind of hard to dry off with because they didn't soak up water very well, but this really isn't much of a deal. Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend that others stay here. Katrina texted to check in with us and make sure all was well, which was sweet of her. If you're looking for a place in the Queen Anne area, this would be it! You're within a 20 minute walk to the Space Needle! Enjoy! "
6961346,57930381,2015-12-30,22343394,Andrew,Wonderful place in the quiet Queen Anne's neighborhood. There was enough room for three people in her studio and her cats were awesome. Katrina was a very gracious host. She provided recommendations for us and also checked in with us everyday to see if there was anything we would need. I would definitely stay in Katrina's studio again
6961346,58156747,2016-01-01,18773088,Alexa,Katrina is communicative and easy going. Her place feels like home and the cats are so sweet! Great location. Awesome apartment. Highly recommended.
3793047,17413161,2014-08-11,2659789,Arthur,Adam was great in communicating directions and arrival information.  Location is fantastic.  A ten minute walk to downtown and set on Capital Hill with tons of restaurants.  You do not nor should bring a car.  Adam's place was exactly as the pictures show.  Adam sent a few texts to make sure everything was fine.
3793047,18136974,2014-08-22,6174005,Maria,"Adam had described the way to the apartment and where to pick up the keys very well. We did not meet Adam during our stay but he was always easy to communicate with and answered quickly if we had any questions. 
The apartment was just as the pictures shows, and the view was great! The flat was situated absolutely perfect, between Down Town and Capitol Hill, with walking distance to restaurants and bars as well to some major tourists attractions such as Pike Market.
"
3793047,18433235,2014-08-26,19403623,Luis,"Adam's place has all the basics and is just like it appears in pictures. The location along the Pike/Pine corridor is very convenient, both to downtown and Capitol Hill. The immediate surrounding area is alive with lots of restaurants, bars, shops, and hangouts, so there was never a shortage of things to do. Adam was extremely good at communicating before and during our stay. He answered all of my questions very quickly, and I always felt he was just a message or phone call away. Street parking is somewhat tough, but I managed to find a block of unrestricted street parking just two blocks from Adam's place. Bus service in the area seems fairly extensive, so that would probably be a good alternative. All in all, we had a great stay at Adam's place and would recommend it to those looking for a convenient place to stay."
3793047,19354550,2014-09-10,19293466,Joanna,The reservation was canceled 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3793047,19531050,2014-09-14,19173187,Gabriella,"Adam was such a great host during my trip to Seattle. He was very good about checking in with me close to my arrival, while I was there and prior to checkout. Since he had the opportunity, we exchanged the keys in person and he was very warm and helpful with all of my ""how to get around Seattle"" questions. He left little pamphlets on sight seeing for me and a white board with helpful information on Seattle and good to know's for the apartment. 

The apartment is true to pictures, clean, comfy and was in a great location for my long weekend stay. It was just me but I am sure that a couple could stay there easily. Very easy to get around by light rail, bus and it was fairly easy to catch a cab on the street. I also ventured out on Saturday night a bit and it was a fun neighborhood for bar hopping. I recommend this listing."
3793047,19701246,2014-09-16,20857117,Betty,"Awesome locations for bars and good food. Capitol Hill is very lively, especially over the weekend. No problem communicating with Adam. I enjoyed my stay!"
3793047,20246049,2014-09-26,20801166,Allison,"This apartment was close to downtown. Adam was a good host and great to communicate with, very friendly and helpful. A little noisy, but this place suited our needs perfectly for a short trip to Seattle."

3793047,20619875,2014-10-02,2861763,Taylor,"Adam's house was really great! His house was clean, comfortable, and in a really awesome location.  Adam was super easy to get in touch with and was always quick to respond.  He met us upon check in and gave us some great tips for some things to see and do around Seattle, and helped us to feel right at home.  I would definitely stay here again, thanks Adam!"
3793047,20667566,2014-10-03,8291188,Erica,"Loved this location!  Very close to some incredible restaurants and bars.  Also, very close to public transit.  The place was very comfortable and Adam was great.  He was a prompt communicator and a gracious host."
3793047,20843763,2014-10-06,21137101,Kaleigh,"Adam was a great host, easy to get a hold of and his apartment was perfect for our short stay. The apartment is in great shape and in a really fun, central area."
3793047,21127981,2014-10-12,19638366,Elisabeth,"Adam is a thoughtful and attentive host, quick to answer questions and full of helpful information. I appreciated knowing I could reach him if I needed to. The apartment is right in the middle of things - very convenient for getting around, but also quite noisy at night. Still, with the windows closed we slept just fine. There are plenty of coffee shops within steps of the front door, and of course the Convention Center - our destination for the weekend - is just blocks away. And the view is fantastic! Space Needle right outside the window! Overall, it was a very positive first airbnb experience for me."
3793047,22525545,2014-11-09,18377434,Romain,Thank you for everything! Adam a great apartment and great neighbors.
3793047,22853916,2014-11-16,13348897,Vance,"Johns place was awesome! The location is amazing! Very close to cafes, bars and restaurants. We walked to popular capitol hill bars, pikes place and downtown easily. There is a great view of the Space Needle. The bed was a little too firm for me, but thats just a preference. We were surprised to find no microwave, but it did not bother us. Overall we had a great experience and would stay here again! "
3793047,24268827,2014-12-24,18302074,Julie,"Listing description was accurate and Adam was in reach for communication.  Apartment smelled and looked really clean. Neighborhood was close enough to walk to downtown.  Minor trouble with wireless, but Adam fixed that in a timely fashion.  Thanks for everything!"
3793047,27936308,2015-03-15,5008934,Tera,"Adams place was perfect for what I needed. Literally steps away from my workshop! I love the neighborhood. Lived there many years ago. Shopping, coffee, and awesome places to eat, all in walking distance. I would choose Adam's place again if I were coming back to Seattle! Thanks Adam! "
3793047,28400646,2015-03-23,27760277,Doug,"Adam was an awesome host! Super welcoming and quick to respond to emails/texts. Adam was really helpful when it came to answering any questions about Seattle itself and provided a lot of information, even checked up on us to make sure we had things to do and gave out suggestions. Adam's studio was just as described, it was nice and cozy! I really enjoyed the view Adam's studio provided and was more than happy with the amount of space it had! Location is right at Capitol Hill and about a 10-15 minute walk to the downtown area. The proximity of his location is close enough to walk anywhere, but there's also bus transportation right by his location as well. Having a car isn't necessary (even though we rented one) but if you rent one, there's some street parking spots with 2 hour limits. If you're planning on renting a car, on the weekends in the downtown area there's garages for $8 the whole day! (no ins and outs).
Thanks Adam for your hospitality, we really enjoyed Seattle and your studio! You were more than helpful and I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here if you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
3793047,28697129,2015-03-29,2589523,Erin,Fantastic studio. The studio is clean and comfortable. The kitchen is small and functional. The internet is fast and reliable. It's perfect for a single person or couple. Adam was very responsive to any concerns.
3793047,29329210,2015-04-06,13067478,Vincent,The description of the apartment was as accurate as it gets! The apartment is within walking distance from downtown Seattle. The instructions left by Peter were super clear and he was very easy to contact during our whole trip. Just one word: excellent! 
3793047,30385289,2015-04-21,11078963,Len,"If you are attending a conference at the Washington State Conv Ctr in Seattle and want a taste of the city this is the place to stay. Great location, safe and exciting neighborhood and lots of places to eat, shop and hang out. The conv ctr is a 10 min walk and we walked to Pikes Place Mkt, the waterfront and South Lake Union among other places (note, we are New Yorkers so we enjoy walking). Adam's pictures are accurate, it is a studio apartment and he offers the use of free Wifi and his large TV, but we were not in the apt much. Great views of the city. If you like seafood check out Taylor Seafood Farm a block away. My husband ate lunch there every day saying it was his favorite place on earth. We would stay again. "
3793047,30765085,2015-04-27,27528495,Edyta,"Adam's apartment was in a perfect location,  with many restaurants,  coffee shops,  stores etc within walking distance.  The view of the Space Needle was great! The apartment was spacious and clean and Adam was very friendly,  easy to reach, and willing to answer any questions."
3793047,31777746,2015-05-10,13238710,Anjelica,"Adam was a really great host. Easy to communicate with and very accommodating. The apartment was super clean, and it's in an amazing area really close to downtown and Capitol Hill. The bed is a little uncomfortable because it's a kind of futon bed. During my stay there was some loud construction directly across the street, but Seattle seems to have ton's of construction happening everywhere. Overall, Adams apartment was nice and the location was perfect."
3793047,32397355,2015-05-17,3084162,Emily,Adam made us feel very welcome. His place was in a really good location.  The place had exactly what we needed for our weekend in Seattle. 
3793047,33700270,2015-05-31,32439235,Sebastian,"Adam was very welcoming before and during the trip, even after we had issues with our incoming flights.  His location was great as it was within walking distance of many things to do downtown and public transit.  The place was great and we are glad we choose to stay here!"
3793047,35200275,2015-06-16,6031885,Mem,I had a great time staying in Adam's apartment - the location is great and the apartment a good size. Being able to see the Space Needle from the apartment was a treat. Adam gave clear instructions and contacted my on numerous occasions to check if everything was okay. I would recommend staying at Adam's place. 
3793047,39263105,2015-07-22,27302086,Kristen,"Really convenient location close to bars, restaurants and an easy walk to downtown. The apartment was as shown in the pictures and very clean."
3793047,40195808,2015-07-29,8058990,Bianca,"Adams place was great! Perfect location, apartment was clean and as described. 
Adam was very easy to get a hold of and extremely helpful. Key exchange was smooth.
Loved our stay in Seattle.
Highly recommend.
"
3793047,40816249,2015-08-02,2306119,Iris,"It was perfect staying at Adam's studio while we were in town for the Seattle Art Fair! He was thoughtful, intentional, flexible, and hospitable. We had a great time at his studio- it was convenient and just what we needed!"
3793047,41135626,2015-08-04,5703380,Gloria,"Adam is a nice and flexible host though we ended up not actually seeing him in person. We had some issues with the heat wave and construction happening at the time of our stay and decided to leave early; Adam was super understanding about the situation. 

The neighbourhood is amazing if you are interested in food and shopping - everything is so walkable. And the apartment is super affordable for the location. One thing to note is that if you are driving in, the overnight parking situation is challenging. None of the very close lots seem to allow it and street parking is a bit of a gong show."
3793047,41659368,2015-08-08,15101985,Thiaga,"Adam was prompt with all his communications. The apartment was as advertised, and was given to me in a clean state. For the price and location, this is easily one of the best deals you can get. "
3793047,42627689,2015-08-14,34915044,Nick,"The studio was a great, centrally located place to stay during our short trip to Seattle. We were a short walk from great restaurants, bars, coffee, and transportation. The studio was as advertised and worked well for our needs. Thanks, Adam!"
3793047,42644966,2015-08-14,10537617,Chi,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3793047,42976977,2015-08-16,4662388,Laura,"We LOVED our stay at Adam's place. It was the perfect size for me and my boyfriend, it was clean and the location could not be beat. We were able to walk many places to enjoy the sites as well as some great restaurants and night life. Although we never met Adam directly, he was a great host and made checkin/checkout and communication with him very easy. I would absolutely stay there again on my next visit to Seattle! "
3793047,44024530,2015-08-23,41049403,Molly,"Adam's listing description was perfectly accurate! The space is exactly as it looks and there were no unpleasant surprises. The neighborhood is AWESOME and a lot of fun. We arrived really late Friday evening/Saturday morning (around 1AM) and it was clearly a lively, social area. We closed the windows and had no problem falling asleep.  It was my first Air BnB experience, and Adam was extremely easy to work with; the lines of communication were always open and he made the process seamless. You're walking distance to quite a bit, and for the couple of times I was feeling lazy, Uber was an easy option that always was $7 or cheaper. I love Seattle and now love this studio and area! I look forward to hopefully returning again soon. Thanks Adam! "
3793047,45303764,2015-09-01,32600082,Siefe,Fantastic room and in such a great location! Host checked in on me numerous times to make sure things were going ok. Highly recommended! 
3793047,53237619,2015-11-06,7341683,Lisa,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3793047,54095986,2015-11-16,29663879,Karen,"Adam was a great host, and his apartment was the perfect spot for my visit to Seattle on a very rainy weekend. Even though Adam was out of town when I arrived, he arranged for me to get the keys from his neighbor and the check in went smoothly. The apartment is in a great location and had everything I needed for my time in Seattle. I would definitely recommend Adam as a host and his Capitol Hill apartment as a great location for a few days in the Emerald City. "
5340242,43915604,2015-08-23,15061260,Greg,Nice place. Conveniently located near a bus stop and a small grocery store.
9311687,53730912,2015-11-11,47905406,Carlos,"Bre was very nice and a great host; her place is clean and cozy a secure apartment building in downtown (bell town). There are Starbucks, food stores and restaurants walking distance from her place.   
I was very fortunate to find her place in Airbnb because it allowed me to complete some business errands in Seattle Downtown by walking therefore avoiding parking hassles.
Overall her place is very comfortable in a good location. I enjoyed my stay. "
9311687,54192416,2015-11-16,5311933,Yulun,The location is very convenient and Bre is a wonderful host. Everything was great as expected and I really enjoyed my stay. Recommended to everyone!
9311687,54549063,2015-11-21,40245187,Abhinav,"The location of Bre's place is excellent, bus stop is right outside the building. The room was small and should be comfortable for 1 person.  The bed was a little larger than a twin size. They have sliding doors only for the guest room and bathroom. It took a while to close the bed room door completely whereas the bathroom door does not close fully. Apart from these little niggles this place is very good if you have work in the downtown area."
9311687,55038400,2015-11-27,24269737,James,"The listing was great, just as described and very nice. Clean comfy and more spacious than expected. Having the whole room and bathroom to myself was nice. Bre also gave me suggestions for local places to visit and was extremely accommodating of check in and out times."
9311687,55462032,2015-12-01,43369317,Marshall,"Bre was a great host!  Her place was nice, and in the perfect location in Seattle to genuinely experience the best the city has to offer.  The rooftop access was unprecedented and she went out of her way to make sure that we were satisfied guests.  Although I misunderstood expectations on a couple of instances, Bre was more than accepting and gracious, and for that I am grateful!  Would definitely recommend her space!"
9311687,55936994,2015-12-07,48613163,Ally,"Location of this apartment is great, we were able to walk everywhere in Seattle. Unfortunately the bed was only a single which we weren't told about and we rented for two ppl so it was a squish, also communication wasn't great as we were left outside the apartment for an hour waiting to get in. Afraid I would actually stay in the Belltown Inn next time, just next door and same price for a bigger space."
9311687,56447309,2015-12-13,980239,Sue,"Bre gave me the reservation on short notice, and I really appreciated her timely communication.  Her place is in a great location, walkable to everything in downtown Seattle.  She provided privacy and was responsive to questions I had.   The bedroom faces a busy street with a bus-line.  It was a bit noisy on a Friday evening, but the ear-plugs I use for sleeping helped."
9311687,57034508,2015-12-21,36716254,Monica,"Bre was a great host, she was very informative and gave great tips on where to go. She was responsive to anything we needed. The apartment location was in a nice area, close to downtown and Pike Place. Inside the apartment, it felt like home and was very clean. I recommend staying with her; Belltown is a wonderful hip place and Bre is an awesome host."
9311687,57562622,2015-12-27,50236918,Connie,"An amazing host and the best location! It only took us several minutes to walk towards the light rail station,pike market and northstrom!
Bre is a friendly host and always gives useful suggestions! And she left us pretty much private space which is very sweet:)
Everything is clean and neat, especially the bathroom!
A good choice! :)"
7824929,44358774,2015-08-25,9127473,Lisa,"Jed and Megan were wonderful hosts and we extremely enjoyed staying at their place (so much that we didn't go out once - or twice)
The house is newly built so everything is new and everything is kept in pristine condition from kitchen to living room.
They have a gym which is great and the bus to Downtown couldn't be more convenient.
Any shopping can be done by walking a max of 10 minutes and their kitchen has everything you could ever need.

Their cats are the gentlest and cutest cats ever - we're already missing them. (This comes from someone who's usually not the biggest fan)

I could just recommend anyone to stay at Jed's place. "
7824929,45629329,2015-09-04,8576371,Jean,"Checking in and out with Megan was easy. She was friendly and welcoming.
The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable. It was nice to have the use of the kitchen for a quick breakfast."
7824929,45704632,2015-09-05,7356659,Amelia,This was our first airbnb experience and we were very happy with everything. Jed and his wife Megan were very friendly and provided great restaurant suggestions. The room was spotless and comfortable. We selected Jed's house based on its Ballard location and enjoyed the neighborhood feel and easy walk to restaurants.  
7824929,46057467,2015-09-07,8283262,Meaghan,"We consider our stay at Jed and Megan's home our favorite spot since using airbnb! Their home is modern and beautifully kept, the neighborhood was fun and we were made to feel extremely welcomed and comfortable. We highly recommend staying there!"
7824929,48768164,2015-09-28,21342645,Elissa,"We had a great stay at Jed and Megan's. Their house is in the perfect location. Finding parking nearby was no problem. We were able to walk to restaurants, shops, and the Ballard Farmers Market within 15-20 minutes. A bus stop, which makes frequent stops heading downtown, is within a few blocks. The whole house was clean and well kept. The bed was very comfy and we enjoyed the wine and snacks they provided on arrival. Their two cats are friendly, quiet, and well-mannered. "
7824929,49554577,2015-10-04,45326878,Michelle,"The room was very clean and sunny. It was great to have our own bathroom. Jed was kind enough to let us store our bicycles in the garage overnight.  Jed was flexible with our itinerary and got back to us right away when messaging. The house was close to Ballard and we absolutely loved the cats, they were super friendly. Overall a very nice stay!"
5383192,36515902,2015-06-29,25541428,Terry,"Christine made us feel very welcome. The neighborhood, house and yard were lovely. "
338043,49939360,2015-10-07,21052269,Alisha,"This apartment was in a great location and it was very close to restaurants and bus stops to be able to reach all the tourist attractions.  Judy was easy to get in touch with when needed and overall our trip was enjoyable.  

The only thing I wish we would have been aware of before booking is how noisey it was.  The apartment is right by a grocery store which has an annoyingly loud (fan?) belt that makes a a screeching sound every time it turns on.  Also, deliveries start pretty early which add to the noise as well.  If you can get past the noise, the rest of our experience was great."
338043,50118803,2015-10-09,13608998,Randy,"There were absolutely zero hiccups, bumps, or issues of any kind and Judy was graciously accommodating. The location couldn't be better as it is literally in the heart of Capitol hill and no more than 5-10 minutes away from some of the best of Seattle's shopping, food and nightlife. The unit itself is absolutely perfect and even had a washer and dryer (which we used). The bed is super comfy and all the linens, towels, and amenities are top notch! I HIGHLY encourage anyone to book Judy's properties because it's obvious that she ""gets"" it. "
338043,51186478,2015-10-18,187827,Liam,The apartment was just as pictured. Great location very good communication. No complaints whatsoever.
338043,52429373,2015-10-29,35908286,Ulla,We felt very welcome and the appartment was exactly as described. Judy was very responsive and helpful. We picked up the key from a lockbox and it worked out perfectly. 
338043,52811836,2015-11-01,47846730,Taylor,Apartment was in a great location and communication with Judy was excellent. Amazing host!
338043,53576595,2015-11-09,22224146,William,"Fantastic location. Incredible rooftop with space needle and sunset view. Highly recommend this spot for anyone looking for the convenient, clean, Cap Hill experience. "
338043,54055065,2015-11-15,16436035,Dan,Exactly as described and Judy is great at getting back to you quickly. The rooftop is unbelievably beautiful. You get the perfect view of the entire city. 
338043,55528372,2015-12-01,49512735,Nicole,"This place was amazing! Great place to stay, great location. And the rooftop was STUNNING "
9508837,55708730,2015-12-04,4061064,Hans And Dorothy,"the lights were on and the fireplace was going.  lovely! Everything is so brand new, and it's so immaculate, they've really done a beautiful job.    The space is small but the high ceilings give it a feeling of being about twice as big.  It's a perfect little getaway space."
9508837,55773877,2015-12-05,50511738,Andrew,What a beautiful home this was. It met all my expectations. In addition to having everything I needed in home the layout way warm and cozy. The location was perfect only a short distance from the city but without all the city traffic and noise. The hosts were very accommodating to all my questions even gave a great dinner recommendation. I will without a doubt be staying here again next time in Seattle
9508837,56229723,2015-12-10,16286667,Justin,"What a GREAT place!
Home was brand new and very nicely furnished. The hosts spared no attention to detail including a HUGE shower and heated bathroom floor. 
The proximity to amazing restaurants was just perfect.
Hosts were attentive and accommodating, but also kept perfect distance despite being next door :)
Ample street parking was also nice, given it was in Seattle proper.
Will definitely go back at first opportunity
"
9508837,56975932,2015-12-20,7311413,Joshua,"The experience was absolutely lovely, the hosts were very welcoming, accommodating and helpful. The loft was beautiful and well stocked. 5 stars!"
9508837,57085478,2015-12-21,48614920,Darlene,"Fantastic location close to everything. Fabulous place clean, warm, cozy, and inviting. The hosts were accommodating, helpful, and very friendly. I look forward to another stay there in the near future. "
9508837,58367019,2016-01-02,2225567,Cassie,"AWESOME PAD. Very accommodating and responsive. Loft was in pristine condition, easy to find, and lots of blankets and other necessities for guests. Directions and instructions for how to use all remotes were very precise and helpful. It had everything we could have possibly needed. Would highly recommend. "
3380159,15075736,2014-07-01,17173003,Lauren,"Miranda and Mike couldn't have been more pleasant or helpful. They greeted me exactly when I landed, which was later than their stated check-in time (same thing with my late checkout); they were also very attentive in terms of any needs or special requests. And they went above and beyond by giving a baggie of local goodies.
The amenities were more than what I had anticipated, and the apartment was clean, spacious, and extremely convenient in terms of walking distance to local attractions and offices. Would absolutely recommend this apartment and will look for it when I go back to Seattle!"
3380159,15711500,2014-07-14,10298154,Wendi,"Absolutely loved Seattle and this location simply can't be beat!  The condo is exactly as the pictures show.  Very clean and well appointed with a full kitchen and large bathroom.  If you travel during the months when Seattle's temperatures are high - keep the blinds down during the day.  We visited during a rare heat wave and really put the air condition to the test.  I believe our host have made some revisions that will eliminate the unit getting uncomfortable in the future.  That said, the view from the living room is beautiful.  It is a wall of windows to the ceiling and the view of the water, Ferris wheel, mountains, is wonderful.  We were also given access to the rooftop patio which gave the same amazing view but with the Seattle sea air surrounding you.  We sat on the rooftop patio virtually every evening and enjoyed the lounge chairs and sunsets.

Getting around from this location was especially easy.  Although we walked almost 10 miles a day - it helped justify the great food, wine, and pastries we nibbled.  

Pike Market is directly next door and we got fresh fruit, local wines, and amazing cheeses from the market.  They also had a wine tasting at one of the shops with local and imported wines.

The Piers are easy to get to - just walk down the hill and choose your destination.  We took the water taxi to Alki Beach - once on the island, a free shuttle circles the island and makes it easy to sight see, shop, or just enjoy a cold beverage and stare at the water.

We took the ferry to Bainbridge and enjoyed the art and the quiet little town.

I found a beautiful piece of jewelry in the Pioneer section of town.  Could have used more time shopping and seeing the older architecture.

I could go on and on - there is so much to see and do.  I look forward to coming back - hopefully soon!

Enjoy!

"
3380159,16358455,2014-07-26,17293016,Marjorie,"Miranda and Mike gave me prompt answers to my questions on location and check-in.  The apartment looks exactly like the picture, but is a 1000 times better.  Every thing was clean and well maintained.  I felt secure with the two entrances well lit and locked.  We loved the location, one block from Pike Place and one block to the waterfront."
3380159,16575737,2014-07-29,2323906,Trung,"Mike and Miranda's place was absolutely perfect, just right around the corner from Pike's Place market and across the street from the pier!! The roof top was absolutely wonderful after a long day of walking. We'd sit out, enjoy the view and soak in the fresh sea breeze. I cannot say enough good things about their place, but one thing I cannot emphasize enough is location location location! Plenty of fantastic restaurants and bars within walking distance and minutes away from the Space Needle, downtown shopping and just a short cab ride to Capitol Hill. Miranda was very prompt with communication and accommodated an early check for us! The apartment itself is very clean and tastefully furnished. I highly recommend Mike and Miranda's place."
3380159,16646339,2014-07-30,14868038,Hilary,"Mike and Miranda were amazing hosts! The apartment was spotless, spacious,  and as gorgeous as it looks in the photographs. Everything we needed was ready for us, from extra linens to air conditioning for the (rare) Seattle heat wave. They absolutely thought of everything. They had even left fresh flowers behind from a recent trip to the market; the apartment smelled like lilies! 

The location of the apartment is fantastic. It is located immediately next door to both the Four Seasons and Pike Place Market. There are phenomenal views of the Seattle Ferris Wheel, Puget Sound, and West Seattle from both the apartment and an easy-to-access rooftop deck.  We were able easily able to walk to the waterfront, the aquarium, and great restaurants. 

Both booking the apartment and checking in were incredibly convenient. Communication was friendly and prompt. 

I cannot recommend this apartment enough--a must stay if you are visiting Seattle! Thanks Mike and Miranda!"
3380159,17218388,2014-08-09,17613212,Kimberly,"Miranda was very accommodating and a pleasure to talk to.
The place was as beautiful as the pictures.
Location was perfect walking distance."
3380159,17527293,2014-08-13,17466661,Monika,"The place was just as shown in the pictures and it was very, very close to Pike Place Market.
It was a little warm in the suite,but once the air conditioning was on it was slightly better. 

The location is good, but slightly noisy as it faces a busy highway. If you're used to this type of busy, loud noise - it's a good option. 
"
3380159,17715877,2014-08-16,19523886,Rebecca,Great location in downtown Seattle. The apartment was comfortable and convenient. The rooftop terrace was lovely on a summer evening. The property manager was gracious and kind. I would stay here again.
3380159,18033998,2014-08-20,19809848,Curt,"The condo was perfect for our needs in Seattle.
The location in Seattle was awesome, close to public market, waterfront and downtown stores.  Enjoyed especially walking to Pike Market for early breakfast.  The weather was perfect in Seattle, so was very pleasant sitting out on rooftop garden patio in the evening.
The condo itself was well equipt with everything that you need for stay.  It was clean and modern just like the listing.
There were only two minor things that distracted from the visit.  The place is noisy, but that is somewhat to be expected being in downtown Seattle.  The other thing was parking.  That turned out to bit more issue than we expected.  A lot of the parking lots locally had limits to the time could park.  In future would probably consider public transportation to the condo leave rental car at airport.  With the location of the place so convenient a car is not really needed.  There are bike rentals and other transports within easy walking.
We enjoyed our stay there in Seattle and would consider this condo again. "
3380159,18359706,2014-08-25,6570242,Nicolas,"The condo was exactly what I expected and is described by the host accurately. The communication with the host was great and the location can't be beat.  Bobby (who checked us in) was amazing and helpful and friendly. The condo is on the smaller side (for a condo, way bigger than a hotel room) but everything is very nice, updated and comfortable.  You can't find a better location.  We walked to Pike's Market and bought stuff for dinner and sat on the roof deck every single night.   We had all of the things we needed to ""live"" in the condo and didn't need anything but our clothes!  The only gripe I had was that there is a lot of road noise.  It didn't bother me much but you could hear cop cars or firetrucks on the freeway at night.  Not a huge deal to me but could bother some.  Other than that, the place was perfect and I'd visit again in a heartbeat! "
3380159,18658426,2014-08-30,2306147,Ignacio Everardo,"Fantastic location.  Close to restaurants, Pike Place Market, Seattle Art Museum and aquarium.  Amazing rooftop deck.  Fast wifi.

Drawbacks: no central air (typical for Seattle), but portable air conditioning unit not sufficient to cool main room on hot days, a lot of street noise, suspicious neighbors (we got a little paranoid).

But overall, a good experience.




"
3380159,18901274,2014-09-02,6263463,Erin,"The place was clean, internet was fast, check-in efficient, and it looked just as we expected from the pictures.

This place is quite noisy. The highway you can see on the pictures is the Alaskan Way Viaduct that has plenty of traffic all night. The streets around the building are also popular with tourists and we could overhear every conversation at 2am. On a weekday starting at 7am more and more delivery trucks drove past the house and some unloaded their things loudly right outside the window.

The location can't be beat if you're going to be downtown a lot. We headed out to various neighborhoods on most days and didn't actually spend too much time around there."
3380159,19827283,2014-09-19,8351201,Mary Ann,"Mike picked me up at the airport and helped me get situated in the condo.  It couldn't have been an easier check in.  Mike and Miranda were available to answer any questions.  I had a wonderful 10-day stay at Mike and Miranda's place.  Everything was as described, all the amenities that you need, a home away from home.  "
3380159,19971034,2014-09-21,20489801,Dong,"The apartment is locate in the best place just 1 min from the Pike Market, but doesn't sacrifice the quietness. The room is super clean and Miranda keep everything in  good condition, all you need are already at right place! I was 1 hr later than schedule due to the traffic, but Miranda is patient and waiting for me at the lobby. Besides, the roof is nice and enjoy the scene without crowds and noise. Definitely will come back again! A nice experience in Seattle."
3380159,20131093,2014-09-23,6430679,Donna,"Phenomenal location! I've visited Seattle several times and couldn't have hoped for a better location! Getting around was especially easy. I was able to walk to most places without a car and really enjoyed waking up so close to the market and nice restaurants.  

The hosts were pleasant and accommodating. The place looks exactly like the pictures and even better with a larger than expected bathroom. Check-in/check-out went really well. 

My highlight was probably the Alaskan King Salmon entree at Elliott's Oyster House around the corner. All-in-all a great trip. Hope to make it back here again soon. "
3380159,20304437,2014-09-27,8730675,Ravi,"We had an absolutely amazing time staying at Miranda's place.Apt is very conveniently located next to pikes place.Apt itself was very clean and nicely furnished.Miranda was nice and easy to communicate with , all in all very good experience and will definitely stay here again ."
3380159,20529708,2014-09-30,4461053,Allen,Amazing location.  Walking score should be 200!
3380159,20855729,2014-10-06,21488827,Heidi,"This was our first time using airbnb, and we were extremely satisfied. The place looked exactly as shown; clean, modern, and perfect for 2 people. It was in the perfect location in Seattle. It was quite nice to have a kitchen and a washer and dryer if we needed them. We were in heart of the city, and most everything was in walking distance. To top it off, our hosts Miranda and Mike did all they could to make our stay enjoyable. They went out of their way to accommodate us, and were extremely quick to answer any questions we had. Thank you both so much!! If we come back to seattle, we will definitely stay at your place again. Take care!! All the best, Heidi and Scott"
3380159,21674493,2014-10-21,20951804,David,"Miranda was excellent! She is extremely accommodating and quick to respond. She left us a bottle of champagne as a welcome gift and checked in with us during our week-long stay to make sure things were going great. Couldn't have asked for a better host.
The listing we stayed at was as advertised - super cool flat, great views, and super close to everything. The kitchen allowed us to shop at Pikes Market and cook at home. The rooftop views were so cool, and we loved the location. Wonderful experience! I would highly recommend it. 
Parking can be tricky if you have to rent a car, but that's all of Seattle for you.  The parking lot across the street has a reduced rate if you went before 10am. The only issue we had was with the noise outside. We could hear cars and people at most times of the day/night, and it was tough to get solid sleep on most nights. Besides that - everything was perfect! "
3380159,22010400,2014-10-27,2403288,Alok,"I had a great time here. The apartment was fully loaded with every kitchen accessory I needed. The location couldn't have been more perfect. I walked every where and ended up getting rid of a car I rented. Easy access to restaurant, bars, the ferris wheel, gum wall and pike's place market was just a few seconds away. The apartment was furnished really nicely and the roof deck view was perfect. Will definitely stay here next time I'm back in Seattle.
"
3380159,22173662,2014-10-31,7547042,Christopher,"Miranda was a great host! She was responsive, communicative, and helpful. The listing is accurate: this is really an awesome spot to come 'home' to when you are visiting Seattle! Just a few steps in each direction takes you to the market, downtown, or the water. I can't imagine a better spot or apartment! Thank you!"
3380159,22344061,2014-11-03,7652508,Kimberly,"Wow! What an amazing experience and a beautifully decorated property. There are so many wonderful things to say about our stay, I'm not sure where to begin. Miranda made the check in process so easy and simple. Her level of communication before, during and through checkout were fantastic. She's so thoughtful and inquired often if there was anything we needed. As a Welcome Home gift, she left us a bottle of champagne & chocolates. It's the little things that are the best. 

The apartment is in a secure building in one of the best areas around the waterfront. We had access to amazing dining, shopping and the pier. There's really no need for a car if you are staying in the downtown area but we did rent one for a day to explore and parking was extremely easy. I think we lucked out in that department. 

Honestly, the pictures only paint half the picture of how well appointed this one bedroom is. And it's quite spacious for a party of two. The kitchen has everything you could need to cook and the market is so close. It feels like you live there instantly! 

It is in the heart of the action so there was some late night noise over the weekend, but on our last night, it was extremely quiet. It's a bit of a trade off for the location and being in the heart of things! 

I will definitely stay here or at one Miranda's properties again. It was wonderful!

"
3380159,22552373,2014-11-09,6719912,Colleen,"This was a terrific place to stay.  It had easy accessibility to Pike Place Market, Downtown shopping and great restaurants.    We watched the sunset over the Olympics while a ferry was coming in.  The downside is parking is not perfect and it is a  bit noisy.  Miranda was very helpful and welcoming."
3380159,22874262,2014-11-16,17075758,Marijean,Miranda was a wonderful hosts the location was perfect and the condo was very clean.  You will have everything you need and never need to drive. Enjoy!

3380159,24318428,2014-12-25,6095670,Nicholas,Great apartment. Well decorated and right next to Pike's Place market.   Had everything I needed. Internet was fast and reliable. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay!
3380159,24950650,2015-01-04,24088219,Yuelun,Great!
3380159,26270062,2015-02-08,21784012,Daniel,Amazing location! Condo was clean and had everything we needed. Perfect place to stay while visiting the city. Can't wait to go back!

3380159,27908950,2015-03-14,17999984,Michael,As advertised. Smiles all around. Exceptional host experience with Eve.
3380159,28099340,2015-03-17,434732,Angelo,"Clean property, excellent location, perfect as described."
3380159,28892753,2015-03-31,23951179,Howard,"The location is perfect to take in all the sights and energy of downtown Seattle, Pikes Place etc.. others have mentioned the same.. The apartment itself is spacious and well appointed. Everything you might need for a comfortable stay is there... Eve is a really great host. She rapidly responds to questions and queries and does everything she can to make your stay perfect.. 

Its close to the freeway so there is a bit of traffic noise but this is part of the location, location, location - can't go wrong staying here..
This is a gem of a place in the Emerald City."
3380159,29468908,2015-04-07,30440139,Fan,"The apartment is great! Its location is very close to Pike place market, Seattle aquarium and so on. My parents can directly see the ocean view from the room. They felt very welcomed. Eve is helpful. Thanks for her hosting,and my parents had a great experience."
3380159,29731044,2015-04-12,14336954,Arianna,"Had an amazing experience at this home.  Location couldn't have been better, the host was most helpful and easy to work with and would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arose."
3380159,31065820,2015-05-01,18421323,Sean,"Eve is a lovely host.  She communicated clearly and coordinated checkin with me even though my plane was late getting in.  

The apartment is delightful.  There are big bright windows facing Western avenue and looking out at the ferris wheel.  Linens and towels were all clean and fresh, and the bed was really comfy.  I slept great and felt refreshed every morning."
3380159,31687021,2015-05-08,32783126,Heather,"My husband and I had a wonderful visit to Seattle- in large part to the incredible apartment Eve and Michael have! The location is surrounded by the best restaurants we have ever eaten at...and plenty of stores, shops and bars all in walking distance. It was our first Airbnb experience and set the bar high for future stays. Beautiful space, memorable stay! Thank you! "
3380159,33027813,2015-05-24,737083,Esther,"Eve was an amazing host. I gifted this listing to my brother as a weekend getaway and he could not stop talking about how wonderful and inviting the space was. A classic case of FOMO on my part, easily remedied by staying at her listing myself when I find myself in Seattle. Thank you Eve for being incredibly communicative and welcoming to my brother.  "
3380159,34652290,2015-06-10,33469919,Debra,We had an amazing stay! Eve was quick to respond and the unit was exactly as advertised. Great view of the Ferris wheel and an easy walk to waterfront fun!
3380159,35213298,2015-06-16,30892008,Nisha,Eve was very warm and welcoming! She was quick to respond to all of our questions during our stay in Seattle. Thanks for a great experience!
3380159,35440224,2015-06-18,27971915,Brad,Eve was great.  Super easy process and great location.  Will rent from her again.
3380159,35575353,2015-06-20,6838375,Tho,Everything was amazing!  Eve provided the easiest check in and check out processes ever!  The place was super clean and had all the amenities that we needed.  The best part was the view of the room since you can see the Ferris Wheel and waterfront.  It's close to everything we wanted to see including the gum wall and pike place market.  There is nothing negative I could say about Eve and this special place.
3380159,36176813,2015-06-26,30949668,Fabre,"I had a very good stay at Eve's. Prime location, extremely convenient to reach any place downtown and particularly Pike Market. The flat is well appointed with a very good bed and powerful shower. The only downsides are the close proximity of the very noisy highway (earplugs advised), and the lack of air conditioning (portable units were provided, but windows need to be open for the air ducts, which means even more noise coming in). "
3380159,38145908,2015-07-13,35077699,Gayle,Very accommodating host. They were able to get us in several hours earlier then scheduled. It was very clean and modern and the bed was extremely comfortable. Would stay again.
3380159,38999174,2015-07-20,32227564,Derrick,"Eve was very flexible with our check in and check out times.  Just make sure you give her notice of your flight plans so she can plan accordingly.   The apartment is perfectly located near the Seattle waterfront (across the street) and Pike Place Market (It's just a quick walk up post alley where you will find the famous gum wall).  The apartment is tastefully furnished and has all the amenities that you would need to feel at home.  The shower was amazing!  A few minor annoyances:  two loud floor a/c units that do just an o.k. job in cooling the apartment. (Temperature in Seattle that weekend got up to the mid 90's). Windows are single pane and you will hear noise from passing cars, tourists and those duck tour riders who can get rowdy sometimes. Lol."
3380159,39644343,2015-07-25,35461124,Bozena,"This place was amazing, very comfortable and spacious. Rooftop was a great place to unwind. Can't beat the location, we walked everywhere!! Eve was great, let us check in early and met us on time. She even checked in the next day to see if everything was as expected. Highly suggest this place to anyone traveling to Seattle. Cant really imagine staying at a hotel again. "
3380159,41736490,2015-08-09,31370054,Josh,Lovely place in an absolutely fabulous location. Hosts were helpful and welcoming. We had a wonderful trip!
3380159,44458012,2015-08-26,40433601,Rith,We really enjoyed being in a prime location and didn't have to take a cab once while in the city.  The place was clean and had a beautiful kitchen setup. The king size bed is nice and the sheets were high quality soft. Overall we enjoyed the place and would come back. 
3380159,47090057,2015-09-15,42686138,Julie,"The location could not be more perfect. Daniela met us to help us get situated then followed up with offers of suggestions of things to do. The apartment is well appointed and exactly as it appears in the photos. It can be hot, although fans were provided. And there is traffic noise from an elevated freeway. This is only an issue when the windows are open...when it's hot. Overall, a great experience."
3380159,48772953,2015-09-28,42698281,Sarah,"We had a great experience! Daniela was great to work with, even before we arrived. She walked us through everything and gave me her cell if we had questions. The apartment itself was awesome. Very clean and modern...very Seattle. It backs right up to Post Alley, which was convenient so we could quickly get to the Gum Wall, Pike Place, etc. The second entrance allows you to access the rooftop terrace and is at street level right next to the Four Seasons. There is a nice large CA King bed and there was even a bottle of wine on it for us when we arrived. 

The only issue we had was the noise. We visited in late Sept. and the weather was still very warm, so we initially left the windows open the whole tine so it wouldn't get stuffy. It was extremely loud from the nearby stacked highway (mostly during rush hour in the am and pm). However, there were two portable a/c units that we ended up using and that kept the place cool without having to open the windows. You will still hear the noise with the windows closed but it's much more muted.

Overall, this is a wonderful place that we would return to again!"
3380159,51578180,2015-10-21,33840193,Leslie,"Great location, Daniela was very responsive and welcoming.  Cute place, loved the big TV and access to amazon and netflix.  Loved the rooftop.  Only complaint is that it gets VERY VERY hot when the sun is out."
4669377,23669978,2014-12-07,23176875,Michael,"Great location, clean apartment, comfortable furniture.  Everything worked and the host was super responsive.  Just a perfect place in the center of Seattle."
4669377,30835773,2015-04-27,28068679,Josh,"Marilyn was such a wonderful host and was so helpful with a couple questions we had in the beginning of our trip, responding immediately.  The condo was beautiful and spacious and was everything we hoped for! Had so much fun and can't wait to return to Seattle. "
4669377,31201342,2015-05-03,12094116,Joe,"Really enjoyed our stay here! The condo was roomy and comfortable, and the location is just about perfect for visiting downtown Seattle. Having garage parking was a huge plus, and my kids loved the pool. Overall, it was a perfect choice for us."
4669377,31861774,2015-05-10,13344685,Dennis,"Marilyn was responsive and clear in her instructions. You can tell she is a very experienced host, but she also has a nice personal touch to her interactions. The listing was was perfect and is within walking distance to most major attractions in Seattle. As a bonus, the fold out bed was one of the most comfortable fold-outs I've ever come across :) "
4669377,33170749,2015-05-25,31541854,Anna,We had a wonderful stay! The place was clean and is in a truly perfect location. We will be back! 
4669377,33699122,2015-05-31,595256,Alex And Rico,"Fantastic location, nice apt, responsive and flexible host, but the toilet doesn't flush reliably (a problem the host is aware of and has tried in the past to fix), and when I was there the coffee machine was broken but Marilyn came and replaced it with a new one. "
4669377,36069300,2015-06-24,17590925,Ken,All was good and we enjoyed our stay.  The street can be a bit loud late at night if you want the door or windows open.
4669377,38739872,2015-07-18,36034129,Abdullah,"The owner, the apartment and the location were perfect. 
"
4669377,44903480,2015-08-30,35113249,Vincent,Fabulous location and a wonderful apartment. This space accommodated myself and my friends wonderfully and everything was provided to make our stay comfortable. Host was on top of everything and check-in/check-out was streamlined and straight-forward and easy. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here.
4669377,47666730,2015-09-21,38506642,Dan,"First off, Marilyn is a super host! Checkin was seamless and fully automated and the apartment was very clean and full of light.  Parking was secure and so was the building.  

The location was right in the middle of the hip Belltown district of Seattle.  Short 10 minute walk to Seattle Center/Space Needle and equally short work to the Pikes Market and WaterFront.   The best part is when you are tired from the sights and walking all day long, all the best bars and restaurants are right downstairs and in the surrounding area.  Bakery downstairs is amazing!  Nice loading and unloading spot right in front (Great for using Uber and checkin/out).

The only con, not for me but may be for others,  is this is on a very busy street and popular part of town.  Weekend nights can get a little crazy outside.  With the windows closed this is a non-issue but the apartment gets stuffy. Even with the AC on in the front room, the bedroom is warm.  

Overall this place is awesome!!!  Thank you Marilyn for the great place to stay in Seattle!  We will be back if you will have us!

Dan and Shannon    "
4669377,48531501,2015-09-27,2514799,Jenny,"This was my first time renting airbnb and it was a great experience. Marilyn was an awesome host and very responsive to any questions I had. Checking in was very easy and the parking garage and building itself are very secure.
We had a group of 5 girls and the fit was comfortable. The location of the unit was great, walking distance to many of Seattle's great eats and main attractions. The only problem I had with the unit was that because it was on a main street and a prime location it was a little difficult to sleep because of all the noise from the street. If you are an easy sleeper then that will not be a problem. Other than that I would highly recommend this unit and would like to thank Marilyn for helping make our trip to Seattle wonderful. 
"
4669377,49054620,2015-09-30,5075831,Ciaran,The listing was perfect and had everything I needed. I stayed here before and will be back again for sure Marilyn always looks after us.
4669377,49602979,2015-10-05,7632334,Daniel,"Great stay. Everything was exactly as advertised. Great location close to practically everything. The condo was extremely well equipped and very clean. The only warning would be ,is that it can be quite loud in the night with street noise , and  deliveries below condo at bakery etc in early early morning hours."
4669377,54690106,2015-11-22,49497174,Stephanie,This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great.  The place matched the description well.  The apartment is very cute and in a great area.  The directions were clear and parking was very easy.  Loved that the pool and gym were literally one door away.  Thanks so much!!
5500752,34955703,2015-06-14,31304537,Jill,"When we arrived, there were fresh flowers, chilled wine, and even a bar of dark chocolate.  The cottage was clean and charming.  The neighborhood is just a few blocks away, walking distance, from our daughter's home.  Very comfortable and convenient. We would definitely return."
5500752,37059179,2015-07-04,19062695,Andrew,"Our hosts were very welcoming and accommodating.  The house was very clean, cozy, and secure, with a beautiful yard in a quiet area.  We really enjoyed having breakfast on the patio in the mornings.  We checked out Cloud City Coffee nearby, per their recommendation, and it was wonderful.  And we got to feed the chickens!

It was a short drive to I-5, which made getting around the city fast and convenient.

We highly recommend this listing."
5500752,38753303,2015-07-18,8070246,Dan,"While conveniently located, more important is how peaceful and comfortable the cottage was. I felt very much at home and appreciated the many little touches ... as well as some of the eggs! When I had a small issue (burnt out bulb) Katrina was very responsive. I highly recommend staying there!"
5500752,42868446,2015-08-16,9771167,Nicole,"This cottage is absolutely adorable. We stayed for 2 weeks, and were able to cook, watch movies on the awesome entertainment system, and relax in the lovely garden. Katrina and John are great hosts and very respectful of our privacy and always responsive to our needs. Seattle is a great city and this is a perfect location to drive to see all of the awesomeness Seattle offers. Thanks so much, and we hope to be back someday."
8412143,49831887,2015-10-06,34934133,Emily,"Kevin was very helpful and responded quickly.  The place was just as listed and is in a great location!  Coffee, the Fremont Sunday market, the Burke-Gilman Trail (for running), great restaurants and bars -- all within easy walking distance.  Really happy with the experience!"
8412143,50050080,2015-10-08,45777069,Allen,Great space in a great location! Kevin was amazingly quick with responding to my questions. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who stays in Seattle! 
8412143,50675167,2015-10-13,12198712,Michelle,"This apartment is in a great location - a few blocks in either direction from cool restaurants, shops, and bars - and had everything we needed for a long weekend. The apartment is cheery and well laid out, bed is comfortable, everything was very clean, and TV had many netflix/hulu/amazon options. Bathroom is well done. Be aware that this is a ground floor unit so you may have some street noise from folks walking by (this wasn't an issue at all for us but extremely sensitive sleepers should note the bedroom window opens to a main road). "
8412143,51188742,2015-10-18,45374775,Sharon,"Kevin was pleasant, easy to get in touch with, and responsive to all my questions and requests. Coordinating travel and arrival plans was straight forward and easy. Everything he said was accurate and accommodating. Great experience with the host, thank you! 

This place is in an absolutely amazing location. One of the most walkable places I've ever stayed and also close to bus lines for day excursions to farther away parts of the city. Super-convenient and affordable.

The structural condition of the apartment itself seems to need a bit of maintenance.  Even though Kevin definitely keeps it extremely clean, fully functional, and stocked with amenities, the space still could use some more sprucing. Still, for the price and location, and especially if you're a low-maintenance traveler (on the smaller side since the layout of the bathroom is extremely tight), this place is the best!!"
8412143,51479824,2015-10-20,6656484,Kevin,Kevin was a very responsive host and was able to accommodate a special request. The place itself was comfortable and a great launching off point for the rest of Seattle. Highly recommend this place and its host to anyone.
