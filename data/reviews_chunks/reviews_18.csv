67270,7041333,2013-09-04,7933856,Kate,"we stayed with Jean in Seattle for three nights. This was our first air bnb experience and couldnt have been bettet. We were extremely comfortable here and mike and Jean were so nice and helpful during our stay. Jean helped us navigate the bus and train schedules and allowed us to print tickets for our excursions from her home computer. The accommodations were extremely clean, spacious and private. Mike was very helpful when we were trying to plan how to get to the ferry port in anacortes on our last day. An overall great experience. Highly reecommended!"
67270,7581845,2013-09-25,758224,Tim,"The rooms are located in the basement, but it totally does not feel like a basement - not damp, lots of windows, and you get a lot of privacy. The house is located on a very quiet street, so it's ideal for getting a good night's sleep. Very spacious - large bathroom (no tub, but large shower), sitting area with a couch table and chairs, and a separate bedroom. There's no wi-fi, only an ethernet cable with doesn't work with macs, so we had to go to the local coffee shop for internet. No TV, which was fine with us. But the kitchen area was pretty spartan - a hot water kettle and a mini-mini-fridge. A couple of mugs and tea bags, but no dishes, microwave, or snacks. The family requires no shoes in the house, so we brought our slippers, which was great since the floors are finished concrete - beautiful, but tough on tender toes! "
67270,7889459,2013-10-07,6200381,Adrianne,"We stayed at Jean's place by Lake Washington and we were very impressed by the quiet and private space, the clean and comfortable room, and by our friendly host. Their home is both beautiful and welcoming!"
67270,8052073,2013-10-14,5053141,Ellis,"We would definitely stay here again.

The space is very clean, spacious, and very tastefully
decorated.  There is a bedroom, as well as a living area
with a desk, sofa, chairs, some books, and a minifridge.
There is also a large washroom with a beautiful shower.
The bed was comfortable.  Our interactions with the owner
were pleasant."
67270,8279835,2013-10-23,8759818,Frances,"The host was very welcoming and her family was delightful.
Mike, Jean's husband, was very patient when he returned things I dropped as I left the home each day on the way to my waiting ride.
The two teenagers are wonderful.  It was so nice to talk with them.
The accomodations are below ground but light and airy, as described.
The family was very gracious.
In a word: RECOMMENDED."
67270,8293517,2013-10-24,431016,Ana,I had to cancel this trip...
67270,9062813,2013-12-03,1588277,Ian,"We have stayed many times with jean. As always, her place is perfect for our needs- close to our son and his family and to good friends. It is private with an excellent bathroom with large walk-in shower, and a private bedroom with a comfortable bed, and a nice sitting room."
67270,9278927,2013-12-17,1633626,Amy,"The space was exactly as shown in the images and Jean was very hospitable.  The bed was comfortable. If staying here, I would recommend having a car.  I would book it again. "
67270,9388343,2013-12-25,1588277,Ian,"The place is a gem for us. As always ( this is our 6th or 7th stay), the place suits our needs perfectly. We are often in seattle visiting our son and his family, and we stay here whenever possible."
67270,9467747,2013-12-30,7930696,David,"This was our first time as airbnb guests, so we're extra-happy.  Jean and Mike are wonderful people and their owner built custom home is immaculate, quiet, comfortable, green, and welcoming.  A few blocks to Lk. Washington, where we walked a lot, and close to PCC, Cafe Vita, The Flying Squirrel Pizza and Both Ways Cafe (great bbf).  Thanks for sharing your home with us!"
67270,9839402,2014-01-13,10978130,Mark,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was perfect!  The house is immaculate, the space we stayed in was roomy yet cozy.  We had plenty of privacy.  We slept so soundly we didn't know a huge wind storm had occurred during the night. We can't wait to return when the weather is good enough to explore the neighborhood.  Super-nice family!"
67270,10094193,2014-01-30,1588277,Ian,"Jean's place is perfect for our needs. Comfortable bed, excellent shower, roomy sitting room, and close to our son and grandchildren. Ian

67270,11521281,2014-04-06,9262108,Jonas,Jean has an amazingly beautiful home in a really beautiful part of town. Glad to have found this little gem. Really easy to find and in a nice quiet area. It felt like a home away from home. The space was nice and clean and at a good temp. The animals are super cute and friendly and so are Jean and Mike. Really only spent time in the area sleeping but I'd stay here again when I return. We had a wonderful experience!
67270,12340529,2014-04-29,12603824,Jennifer,"Very clean space. Lovely shower and bathroom.  No wifi, however there is an internet cable. Very easy to coordinate with Jean. "
67270,12599279,2014-05-05,7209026,Chris,"This was one of my best airbnb experiences. The home has a great private sector: bedroom, bathroom and the living room. Everything was clean and very well arranged . If all airbnb stays are like this, hotels can close. Highly recommend!"
67270,13184035,2014-05-21,13120075,Alan And Michelle,"I had a wonderful stay with Mike and Jean Toutant and their children.  Their basement apartment was perfect for me with a bedroom (comfortable bed), living room with desk, and a private bathroom.  Additionally I had free plug-in Internet access.

I entered their house through the front door with my own key and within a few steps accessed the door to their basement.  I connected with Jean and her family members about every other time I entered the house.  They were always friendly and willing to chat whenever I wished.  

In addition to the fine accommodations and super hosts, this house is in a wonderful residential neighborhood close to Lake Washington.  I ran along the lake to Seward Park most mornings.  "
67270,13489547,2014-05-28,105888,Jerry/Aida,"We enjoyed the clean and comfortable accommodations at Jean's home, located next to beautiful Lake Washington and convenient to all Seattle venues.  The ethernet connection worked well for our computer needs (no wifi) and the on-street parking in this quiet, residential neighborhood served us well. "
67270,14017373,2014-06-10,1552491,Elizabeth,Jean and her family are extremely welcoming and accommodating.  The home is beautiful and so is the location.  I really enjoy coming here.  Have stayed twice and hope to again.
67270,14170042,2014-06-13,13865619,Clémence & Vincent,"Nous avons passé un excellent moment chez Jean. La chambre est très confortable et parfaitement indépendante . Petit plus, le lac Washington à une centaine de mètres est splendide! "
67270,15561368,2014-07-11,7581778,Elizabeth,"We are Seattle natives who stayed with Jean while looking for an apartment, and our stay was delightful. The property is so close to Lake Washington for some sunbathing or swimming, or a quick drive/walk from the adorable Columbia City neighborhood. Parking is a breeze on the street (not true in most parts of Seattle!), and the area is quiet. 
It's nice to have your own private space in the basement, with a separate lounge/desk area from the bedroom. You can tell that a lot of thought was put into the furnishing and construction of the house. The Ethernet cable made connecting to the internet easy. 
Jean was always friendly whenever our paths crossed.
"
67270,15771020,2014-07-15,5443818,Emily,"We had a wonderful time staying with Jean and her family. They're very nice people who provided everything we needed for a weekend in the city. They even let us borrow their laundry rack to dry our clothes in their beautiful backyard.

Their home is beautiful and immaculate, and the guest apartment is also spacious and comfortable, with the nicest bathroom we've ever encountered in an Airbnb. The location was convenient for driving almost anywhere in Seattle and the home is within walking distance of restaurants, coffee and the lake.

Overall, this was a great value and a wonderful experience. Thanks!"
67270,16563977,2014-07-29,16195478,Inho,"Jean & Mike's house is really super clean and I can't forget warm hearted hospitality of Mike. When we stayed, Jean was not there but Mike fully handled what we needed. If I have chance to travel around Seattle again, I bet to choose their lovely place again.

Inho & Sunyoung"
67270,16772219,2014-08-02,15984722,Krystal,"The description was accurate, and the private apartment-like space was exactly what I needed.  The neighborhood (which is very quiet and green) was located just a few blocks from the shore and walking distance from a cafe and pizzeria (expensive but worth it).  You are close, a 10 min. walk, from a grocery store, and just one block from the bus stop.  I did not rent a car, and was able to get around the neighborhood and to and from Seattle easily.

The hosts were very nice, accessible, and respectful of your space.  I would definitely use their listing again, when I'm in the area.

Side Note:  Verizon phone customers may have spotty service in the room."
67270,16997482,2014-08-05,17520446,Etienne,"It's a great place to stay in Seattle! Lovely people, very good location, quiet and safe. Around 30 minutes from the house to the city, very easy by bus or light train. I would (will?) come here again. Thank you Jean and Mike!"
67270,17117101,2014-08-07,16915548,Roland,I highly recommend Jean and family if you are looking for a comfortable and quiet place to stay while visitng Seattle. The near by park is an added feature.  
67270,17226376,2014-08-09,10575769,Alyson,"We had a great stay at Jean's home! We liked being able to walk to the light rail, and having a quiet clean place to come home to after a busy day in the many neighborhoods of Seattle. "
67270,17453121,2014-08-12,8419930,Beth,"My husband and I were doing a workshop in Seattle, and found Jean’s place perfect for our needs! Even though our flight brought us in to Seattle in the wee hours of the morning, Jean graciously greeted us and showed us to the downstairs suite.  The room is pleasant and feels private, as it is on the lower floor, separate from the rest of the house. The bed is comfortable, the furnishings tasteful and with clean lines; elegantly simple.   The bathroom is spacious and impeccably clean.   Although we did not end up using the fridge, it was nice to know it was there.  I highly recommend this location for a clean, quiet, accessible stay in Seattle. "
67270,17691213,2014-08-16,3076196,Alan,"Jean and her family were very warm and welcoming.  The space was as described, clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood is very walkable with a great bakery and coffee shop close by.  After only a few days there we felt like regulars in the community.  Jean also provided a great knowledge of the city with tips on things to do.  We appreciate their hospitality.

"
67270,17949939,2014-08-19,18106189,Martin,"The room was the perfect start to our   
trip: comfortable, clean, near to the city, in a nice neighbourhood... And Jean & her family were absolutely helpful and friendly. Thanks for everything!"
67270,18058918,2014-08-21,4864549,Jaki And Rob,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Jean's.  Her home is lovely, clean and comfortable.  It's located in a beautiful neighbor within walking distance to Lake Washington.  There's a great co-op also just a few blocks away where we shopped.  Jean is an ideal host - friendly, helpful, generous and considerate of our needs, making us feel comfortable and right at home.  We appreciated her understanding and flexibility with our change in arrival time.  
We certainly hope to stay here when we visit Seattle again next year and highly recommend it to others.
"
67270,18657917,2014-08-30,3404314,Cindy,"We were very happy with our stay at Jean's. The apartment was immaculate, tastefully decorated, and comfortable. We were in Seattle to babysit our grandchild while his daycare was closed and spent very little time in the apartment—leaving first thing in the morning and returning at bedtime—but we enjoyed the time we did spend there (the sofa is lovely for reading! the shower is great, with shampoo, conditioner, and soap). And we especially enjoyed glimpsing Jean's beautiful house (the apartment is in the basement, accessed from the main entryway of the house), beautiful family (our occasional encounters were very pleasant), and the amenities of the neighborhood—Flying Squirrel pizza (great gluten-free crust!) and PCC market. We would definitely stay again."
67270,18808752,2014-09-01,2670499,Una,"Jean was a great host, our arrival time changed unexpectedly and I found her to be accomodating and understanding. She lives with her family in a beautiful home in the Columbia City area of Seattle, a few blocks away from a lovely lake-side path. The area is safe and residential with a few options for eating out, and about 45minutes-1 hour from the city center by public transport. The guest accomodation is like a mini-apartment (without access to a kitchen but with a kettle) in the basement of the house, but there is plenty of light. The space is clean and comfortable and their pets are kept out of it. Jean left us plenty of maps and information about Seattle which helped us to organise our stay and make the most our visit."
67270,19088955,2014-09-06,19749335,Beau,"This was a very quiet, bright and private basement room. Parking was convenient, and the garden and home were even more impressive in person. It was our first airbnb experience, and we really couldn't have been happier with the room and location: it was very clean and close to many Seattle highlights. We really enjoyed the Columbia City neighborhood: we ate at the Flying Squirrel pizza twice (one good and one so-so experience), picnicked at Seward Park (very close to the location), ate some delicious pastries from Columbia City Bakery (awesome pastries!) and drove to downtown by car. Our only recommendations would be to replace the internet cable as it popped out frequently and provide some mugs to drink the tea provided. Thank you so much for a great stay and experience, Jean!"
67270,19342918,2014-09-10,16526632,Greg,"We were greeted at the door by Mike who kindly provided info for our short stay.  The space was awesome, a truly restful private spot after a long drive. It is spacious, very clean, and oh so quiet!  The bed and linens are first class, providing a great night's sleep.  In a city of $300/night hotel rooms, this spot certainly has them beat, and the host has done an exceptional job of providing a special oasis.  Thank you very much for allowing us to stay!"
67270,19399804,2014-09-11,1542457,Michael,"Beautiful home, and wonderful (short) night's stay at Jean and Mike's home.  Comfy bed, immaculately clean rooms, and Jean was really flexible with my shifting arrival time.  Definitely recommend. 

"
67270,19608185,2014-09-15,19469461,Erin,"A quiet and lovely place to stay with a friendly host/family. I would recommend this airbnb to anyone and would stay there again, in a heartbeat. The bed is very comfy too. "
67270,20000149,2014-09-22,10121388,Cormac,Very friendly and helpful hosts. The room was very spacious and comfortable. Nice part of town. 20 mins walk to light rail station leading to airport/downtown. Definitely will stay again if I am in Seattle.
67270,20364991,2014-09-28,13701254,Lassa,"What a great place to stay! If you want to sleep peacefully surrounded by nature when visiting a big city, this is it. You'll have your own mini-apartment that's comfy, quiet and a 10 minute drive into downtown Seattle. And Lake Washington is a few short blocks, a great place to walk, bike, run, contemplate life. Jean and her family are private, sweet and very respectful of privacy. Also, there's a great coffee place as well as a terrific pizza place within 2 blocks...excellent location and lodging. "
67270,20511692,2014-09-30,13120075,Alan And Michelle,"This was our second stay with Jean and her family.  Their home is beautiful and close to Lake Washington.  We enjoy getting out on the lakeside trail that is just a few blocks from Jean's house.

Our suite of rooms at Jean's house was immaculately clean, quiet, and spaceous.  We always find our interactions with Jean and her family to be pleasant and fun."
67270,20572796,2014-10-01,20155027,Matthias, Jean is a very friendly person. I felt immediately welcome. The room was clean and quiet. The bed was very comfortable. The location of Jean's home is very nice. Overall a greate stay and i recommend it. 
67270,20705018,2014-10-04,96531,Stan,"We throughly enjoyed our stay at Jean's. The room was actually a spacious mini-apartment with plenty of space for reading, relaxing etc. Although we were apprehensive about staying in a below grade room, the spaciousness, high ceiling and large windows made it very comfortable. The apartment was immaculate and the bed extremely comfortable. Construction details (the house was built by Mike) were very impressive.

We  are familiar with Columbia City and were very happy to be back. Although the neighborhood is residential (& very quiet), there are two recommended places to eat only two blocks away. The PCC organic co-op is a short uphill walk away.

Finally, we appreciated their offer of a ride to the light rail line as we were heading to the airport. It saved us either a one mile walk or the wait for a bus. Thanks for everything."
67270,20858130,2014-10-06,9297503,Mason,Jean made us feel like home first thing when we walked in the door. She showed us our amenities and was in communication with us throughout our stay. Highly recommend. 
67270,21168679,2014-10-12,5441919,Doedo,Our host greeted us when we arrived at 9 pm.  The basement  was spotlessly clean with a lovely bathroom. Bedroom was exactly like the pictures. We wouldn't really call the basement light an airy but the deep window wells do let in some natural light. The sitting area at the bottom of the stairs is dominated by the hosts laundry but they have a tea kettle and some tea and chocolates out for guests. Bed is very firm and the floors are concrete.  Note that internet is not WiFi. Make sure you have something that can connect to a Cat5 cable. Otherwise very pleasant neighborhood. Good parking and the host's recommendations for breakfast were great. 
67270,21411027,2014-10-16,15112136,Teri,"Great place to stay.. Enjoyed my room.  Quiet room downstairs. Great private space with own bathroom.  Very comfortable space with couch,  desk in living area.  Great lighting a nice Overstuffed chair in bedroom with queen bed.  High speed Internet.  Nice touch having shampoo and such in shower.  Family was home but was still peaceful in room.  I would return.  I had to stay overnight for a job interview and was a perfect location very easy to find home from the main location.  Forgot my phone charger and there was a Walgreens and Safeway nearby.  Felt safe travelling alone as a female in unknown area.  Thank you for a relaxing evening."
67270,21787675,2014-10-24,1885632,Suzanne,"Jean could not have been more welcoming.  She changed her personal schedule to accommodate my arrival time, then made me feel right at home.  This is a very comfortable apartment on a quiet street near great shops.  Easy on-street parking in this safe residential neighborhood makes this an attractive location for a woman traveling on her own.  At the same time the ample apartment means that a couple can stay here comfortably.  I would happily stay here again.  "
67270,21838813,2014-10-25,3904078,Lisa,"Loved our stay at Jean's place. Spotlessly clean, quiet and private it was perfect for us. The bed was very comfortable and the basement was well equipped for all you need. Loved the close location to the lake, if we had of had more time we would have spent more time walking the beautiful shoreline."
67270,21935825,2014-10-26,9454532,Katie,"Jean's place was so lovely. The proximity to the lake was a treat, and we appreciated her flexibility! Quiet, private and cozy. "
67270,22343143,2014-11-03,15567437,Curt,"Wonderful experience.  The lodgings are in the basement area, but large egress windows let in lots of light and the rooms (bedroom, sitting room, and bathroom) are well-sized and have modern finishings.  There was never any problem getting in and out at early/late hours.  The home is close to Columbia City neighborhoods and Seward Park, but we had no problem driving to Capitol Hill or other neighborhoods.  I would highly recommend it."
67270,22514861,2014-11-08,5974047,Jennifer,"Jean's place was beautiful and comfortable,  in a lovely area that was very  accessible to both neighborhood eats and the downtown vibe. Would love to stay here again."
67270,23482670,2014-12-01,19653493,Sandy,Perfect location and wonderful space for our overnight in Columbia City.  Everything was perfect and the hosts were very accomodating.  I would certainly recommend to anyone visiting the area.  It is a very quiet neighborhood and Lake Washingtion is within walking distance as is a nice cafe and Pizza Place.  Sandy
67270,23652493,2014-12-07,7158466,Lorissa,Had a wonderful experience with Jean and her family.  Her husband built their beautiful home!  Such a beautiful place!  The accommodations were perfect!  Very private with lots of great restaurants/pubs nearby.  Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area.  Great family! Was nice to meet Jean and Mike's children Ella and Emmett.  Everyone was so welcoming!  Thanks again Jean and Mike!  Merry Christmas to you all!  Lorissa and Jim
67270,23932948,2014-12-14,24379547,Rachelle,"What a beautifully restored home! The basement suite is warm and light with a comfy bed, a huge shower, and a large sitting area. A lovely place to host out of town guests or hide away for a Seattle weekend."
67270,24455923,2014-12-28,1465523,Elise,"Jean's house is lovely, and the basement is like a mini apartment -- spacious and private. It was easy to coordinate with her, and she was flexible about my check-out time, which I really appreciated. I'd definitely stay there again for future weekends in Seattle."
67270,27634218,2015-03-08,2150714,Audrey,"The space was accurate in regards to the listing. The private lower living space was comfortable and clean. The neighborhood is quiet and cozy, with lovely public parks and an awesome pizza place in Columbia City. "
67270,27904617,2015-03-14,25969096,Roini,This was a beautiful house in a great neighborhood. The room is in a very nicely finished basement that was surprisingly quiet and private. I would recommend having a car as it's a bit of a walk to Columbia City and the light rail. 
67270,28333390,2015-03-22,26260531,Michelle,"Jean and Mike were both great hosts. They answered our many questions about Seattle and were around if we needed anything. The basement is cozy and feels very private. Also, the lake is less than a block away and makes for a lovely mid-day stroll. Highly recommended!"
67270,28582468,2015-03-26,15711925,Jennifer,Jean was a wonderful host.  It was a welcoming place to stay in a beautiful neighbourhood.  Having access to the downstairs basement was cozy and private.  Everyone in the home was very gracious.  Such a pleasure! 
67270,28691390,2015-03-28,1433507,Jim,"Jean was very welcoming and accommodations were very nice. The room and bathroom were in a very nicely furnished basement that felt very private. 

The neighborhood is very nice. Parking was very easy, and it is a nice walk to Columbia City.

We only stayed one night, as our visit to Seattle was very short, but we would definitely stay again if we visit Seattle."
67270,28897820,2015-03-31,4337235,Bena,"We had a great experience in Seattle. It was a very cute neighborhood that was close to public transportation and the lake. Jean was super sweet and gave us great tips about places to go and buses to take. They provided a fridge, tea kettle and a variety of tea (brownie points for honey ginger tea!). 

It's stated in the amenities but the internet is connected via ethernet so make sure your laptop has the port. If you're running on a Macbook Pro or Air, you'll need an adapter. "
67270,29609568,2015-04-10,4196186,Karen,"Jean was most welcoming helpful.  The accommodation was private, clean, quiet .... perfect!  We loved the walkable neighbourhood - a couple of blocks to a beautiful walk along the lake and a few blocks to restaurants."
67270,29782342,2015-04-12,6852480,Natalie,"This is a lovely home in a great location. We didn't have time to explore as we were busy with other things but there were a few great neighborhoods to browse and the lake within a few blocks. 

The space is very nice - and very quiet! A bedroom, a sitting room and a big, walk-in shower in the bath room. The bath was stocked with lotions, soaps and shampoo if you didn't bring your own.  

No wireless wifi so bring a laptop you plug into if you want to  be connected. 

I visit Columbia City regularly and will definitely give Jean a call when I need a place to stay. "
67270,30353853,2015-04-20,31113853,Kevin,"The space at Jean's home exceeded my expectations. Jean and her family are gracious and helpful hosts.

The space has one bedroom, a lovely bathroom, and a reading and relaxation area. There is no television; a plus for me as I thoroughly enjoyed the quiet during what proved to be a hectic visit with family. There are outlets and connections for your computer use to view online programs.

Jean's home is in a beautiful neighborhood and she maintains a beautiful garden. Her home is very close to Lake Washington and Stanton Park. This area is a ""must-see"" for bird-watchers and nature lovers. There is a wonderful coffee house and small restaurant nearby. The specialty pizzas in the restaurant are delicious and reasonably priced. If you're a jogger, the neighborhood and park trails are the best.

Regarding using your cell phone: the guest space is a fully furnished basement/ lower level area. My Verizon LG 4G-LTE had poor reception in the guest rooms. I am told other cell phones have fared better.

This space, and Jean and her family, was an oasis for me. I highly recommend this guest home and living space located in a wonderful part of Seattle."
67270,33182710,2015-05-25,33584499,Bogdan,"We had a wonderful stay at Jean and Mike's house - the private lower living space was very comfortable and clean and Jean was very accommodating, waiting for our late arrival vary late in the night. 
Thank you Jean for your hospitality."
67270,33291675,2015-05-26,5992959,Xavier,The host canceled this reservation 45 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
67270,34545660,2015-06-09,32427239,Louis,We were pleased to find your home just as you destined it in the listing. The unit was clean and comfortable and your hospitality and helpfulness in making us comfortable was much appreciated. It was also conveniently located near restaurants and the lake.  I hope your home will be available the next time I visit Seattle! Thank you for a pleasant stay.
67270,34722220,2015-06-11,4618466,Pascal,"Thank you for hosting us during this 2 nights, the room is very clean and confortable. Jean was kind and helpful for our departure from the USA. Thanks a lot again !"
67270,34950472,2015-06-14,30741541,Celia,Jean was warm and welcoming when we arrived.  The basement apartment was comfortable and perfect for our needs.  There is a wonderful cafe just around the corner which we really enjoyed.  
67270,35841241,2015-06-22,15787108,Janette,I have no complaints and our stay was very comfortable. 
67270,36556875,2015-06-29,31560376,Negar,"My mom and I visited Seattle for the weekend and stayed with Jean and her family. The house was in such a great location, close to Lake Washington, and many of the main tourist attractions were easily accessible by car or public transportation. We really enjoyed our stay and the private downstairs unit was very charming and quite roomy! "
67270,38860161,2015-07-19,6531137,Sue,"Initially I was supposed to have been there around midnight, but there was a flight delay and also construction at the airport. When I phoned Jean she understood and was gracious about it even though it was 1 AM before I finally arrived.
The description was accurate and I enjoyed the neighborhood.
Jean might consider adding two notes to her description. There is no television, which suits me fine, but might be a drawback to some.  The other thing is I would mention the stairs. There is nothing wrong with them, but I could see that some of the older crowd might find that to be a challenge."
67270,39499803,2015-07-24,31310132,Valerie,Jean and her family were gracious host The home has functional beauty and privacy with a peaceful appeal. The nearby lake and warm friendly neighborhood community made our stay in Seattle  a 4 star stay. Delicious Breakfast at corner cafe and great Caribbean food at Island Soul across from the small local 250 seat theater added a special charm. We loved our 3 day stay
67270,39769728,2015-07-26,34694340,Bonnie,"My hostess Jean, met me when I arrived at her home.  She introduced me to her husband, Mike, gave me a tour of the basement rooms where I stayed.  Her home and yard are beautiful and restful.  I loved the quiet home because it's almost zen-like.  "
67270,41415493,2015-08-07,26438,Emily,"The house is lovely and well-appointed and Jean is a gracious host, and was happy to give us useful advice on making the most of our visit to Seattle. Neighborhood felt safe and everybody seemed to have lovely perrenial plant gardens, rather than grass, so it was pleasant to walk the neighborhood and look at the landscaping. As a few reviewers noted, walkability is relative. Walking a mile to light rail didn't appeal to my sister and I in the mornings, so we Lyft'd downtown (about $13, probably not too much more than 2 train tickets, especially when you factor in time saved). In the evening, when we weren't on a schedule, the mile walk to the heart of Columbia City was fine and made us feel like we ""earned"" our meal and drinks. A few spots for live music in Columbia, and a number of food options. There's also a cafe just two or so blocks away that we enjoyed. "
67270,41957501,2015-08-10,2095496,Janet,"Jean met us promptly when we said we would arrive.  She oriented us to the basement suite where we stayed and was quietly welcoming giving us suggestions for places to take our meals that were quite good.  This family was very quiet and allowed us our privacy.  The neighborhood is quite residential but with easy access to public transportation downtown and elsewhere in the city.  The bed was comfortable and the shower excellent the entire suite was immaculate.

67270,42301486,2015-08-12,38461935,Mingxuan,Jean is very kind and would provide suggestions for travel. The room is private and cozy. All things are pretty clean. 
67270,42569925,2015-08-14,38874770,Desiree,"Jean and her family made us feel very welcomed. When we arrived, Jean gave us a tour of where we would be staying. She was very helpful and gave us tips for our sight seeing. Her home was clean, beautiful, and in a great location. There is a really great breakfast cafe less than a five minute walk from her home. "
67270,45937794,2015-09-07,25170695,Jacqueline,"Great place to stay!! Jean was very accommodating and responsive to our needs. The location is nestled in a residential neighborhood right by a lake. Definitely felt safe walking around, even when we needed to walk to the Link station at 6 in the morning. The room was as shown in  the pictures. Very spacious and private. Bed was comfortable. "
67270,46606536,2015-09-12,32474008,Christoph,It was a wonderfull time in Seattle. I felt very welcome. The rooms were very comfortable und clean. It was a very good decision to stay in your home. Thank you Jane
67270,47705171,2015-09-21,40761708,Nan,Super lovely Cosy wee room. Beds very comfy. Would stay again
67270,48455564,2015-09-26,44339041,Claire,Jean and Mike are so welcome U.S. and care about our trip. We feel very pleased and warm.
67270,48809043,2015-09-28,44433642,Vicki,"The host & her entire family made us feel so very welcome.  Loved visiting with each & every one of them.  The family home was  beautiful, gorgeous yard, lovely decorating, very inviting.  Our rooms were in the basement which was light & extremely well done.  The bed was wonderful & we so appreciated NOT HAVING A TV THERE.  It was very quiet & we were able to relax, read, & rest up for the remainder of our trip. We also thought it was great that a washer & dryer were at our disposal. We absolutely loved the accommodations & would definitely stay there again. The neighborhood was excellent with gorgeous large trees & only 2 blocks from Lake Washington.  So close to everything downtown.  Couldn't have been a better location."
67270,49352432,2015-10-03,38223887,Wanyan,"It is a good experience to stay with Jean and Mike for two nights. The room is very clean and suitable, I do recommend this place for the trip in Seattle. "
67270,50070596,2015-10-09,223194,Susan  And Allan,"Jean's space was perfect for me.  I was visiting my son and family and it was in walking distance to their house.  I also enjoyed the walk to PCC and to the lite rail. 

The space was very comfortable. The accommodation was spacious. good bathroom, comfortable couch in the sitting room and the bed room was comfortable. And there was good light for reading. 

My only difficulty was there was no wifi.  Next time I will bring my laptop so I can connect to their internet. 

Thank you, 

Susan"

Getting downtown was very easy and only 15 mins by bus. Tyler was very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. The WiFi connection was great and with heated floors and a walk in shower, the suite was very cozy and welcoming. Thanks Tyler for making our trip so stress free!"
9506766,56157533,2015-12-09,7742581,Andrea,"Tyler, Lulu and Rebecca are amazing! Tyler was so accommodating and really wanted to make the experience unique for me. As a host, Tyler will always go above and beyond for his guest. Upon arrival, I was given a tour of his beautiful apartment and provided with beer, wine and some of Seattle's best coffee. If you want a warm, homey place to stay at in an incredible location near Capitol Hill book it now! Plus they are also dog friendly."
8016481,46070310,2015-09-07,6603227,Jonathan,"Stayed at Pablo's lovely place over Labor Day weekend.  Located in Belltown, it was very convenient to the areas we visited - Pike Place, Downtown, Lake Union, Queen Anne, Capital Hill.  Didn't get a change to meet him, but the person who gave us the keys was super nice and friendly. The pictures of the roof top sold me.  You have 360 views of Seattle of the water, hills, city, and the Space Needle.  Planned on visiting the Space Needle or Columbia Center but there was no need to.  The view is AMAZING!  Expect to spend 1-2 hours on the roof top daily. Other folks come out and you'll end up talking to them.  All friendly and locals which makes this house a way better option than a hotel.

8016481,46259282,2015-09-08,42921241,Breanna,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8016481,46791033,2015-09-13,42905185,Myke,"Great neighborhood, fantastic view from the rooftop patio. Right next to a major public transit line. Good coffee shops, bars and restaurants right down the hill. Apartment was comfortable and clean. Host communication was very prompt and professional. Highly recommended!"
8016481,47890470,2015-09-21,32131164,Nicole,"Great location for downtown seattle. Listing was exactly as described. Wishbinwouldbhave paid more attention to know there wasn't a coffee pot, just a heads up for future renters. The view from up top was amazing and worth every penny. "
8016481,48126353,2015-09-23,43953500,Kerstin,"The apartment is lovely- it's not large, but spacious and very clean. we had all the amenities we needed.
The best part of the place is the rooftop- it's great and the view is amazing! Good spot for hanging out during sunset!
We didn't actually meet Pablo, but he/his representatives have been very prompt with responses to any enquiries online. Process for getting the keys to this place was very simple! 
Would definitely stay here again :)"
8016481,48425396,2015-09-26,15308191,Alexa,Great location for walking around Seattle! Pablo was very easy to coordinate with.
785830,17705437,2014-08-16,7251575,Amy,"A great neighborhood home, especially if you have kids. We loved the access to the porch, yard and great family kitchen. The recently renovated bathrooms were beautiful as well. Location was close to some great Seattle parks and lake proximity and a bit of a drive to more well known Seattle attractions.
"
785830,42607486,2015-08-14,1406513,Elizabeth,"What a beautiful, inviting and unique home! Heath made us feel welcome with her responsive emails and her availability to answer our questions as they came up. She was generous with recommendations for restaurants and activities to do in the neighborhood, and information for getting downtown by bus. The house is in a lovely, walkable neighborhood with great local shops and restaurants, and easy  access to hikes and the nearby lake. "
6387576,32488197,2015-05-18,11718332,Nina,The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6387576,33183991,2015-05-25,5055726,Alyssa,"A lovely stay to be had at this location. The personal touches from Joe and Ronnimae made us feel especially welcome and cared for; something unique to airbnb travels. The space was secure and well stocked -- from house shoes to earplugs, Joe and Ronnimae make sure you've got what you need. We were looking for a private setting and found the space ideal. It would work well for traveling couples or solo travelers due to the 2BD layout. No need for a full kitchen in the heart of Capitol Hill -- and the hosts have an array of information about unique to-dos in the area. We'll be here again in a heartbeat!"
6387576,33488689,2015-05-28,10807537,Carrie,"Joe definitely made us feel welcome.  He was very accommodating even when we were making the reservations the evening we wanted to stay there.  The room is as described.  We rented just one bedroom and then you share a great common space/ living area and bathroom if there is someone in the other bedroom.  It worked great. Love the extra touches…water, chocolate and popcorn!!!  And the walking map was invaluable.  Would definitely recommend this great place, in a great neighborhood, for great value!!!  The only challenge is parking …since his spots were already taken we had to find neighborhood parking which did work out after driving around for a bit. Seattle parking is a challenge period.  "
6387576,33732691,2015-05-31,4805991,Caitlin,"What a great spot! Joe & Ronnimae have built the space to be like a two bedroom apartment with it's own separate entrance so I didn't feel like I was bothering them if we came in late. Each bedroom is locked and the spaces are shared. I think we even got pretty lucky with a nice ""flat mate."" They provided many necessities including tasty Tully's coffee for the morning, and a popcorn maker for late night snacking. The location was perfect for walking around to bars and restaurants in Capital Hill, Pike/Pine, Downtown, etc. Joe & Ronnimae had a parking spot available we were able to purchase at a very reasonable cost. Worth it. We recommend going to Tula's Jazz Lounge. Great fun!"
6387576,33974891,2015-06-02,25667803,Kirk,"After one night at Joe and Ronnimae's Oasis, I contemplated extending my time in Seattle.  All superlatives apply.  These simply wonderful people have made every effort to create a welcoming and comfortable experience, and they have succeeded.  Best night sleep I've had in a long time. 

They care, and it shows.  Plain and simple.  Perfect.  

"
6387576,34477772,2015-06-08,33457520,Deepa,"Joe and Ronnimae have an awesome private setup, with little touches that make your stay extra comfortable. Brownie points for:
- Clean linens + towels 
- Eye mask + ear plugs + water
- Keurig coffee maker in the shared living area
- Clean bathroom stocked with everything you might need

They've thought of every need that a traveller might have, including space heater in the bathroom, toiletries, a multi-point extension cable, and plastic slip-ons for wearing inside the house when it's raining.

They're also very amicable,  hospitable, and kind. They even got me a cupcake for the day of my birthday. I can't recommend them enough and will definitely try and stay with them the next time I visit Seattle. Plus, very convenient access to several awesome dining and drinking spots in the Pike/Pine corridor.  "
6387576,34575938,2015-06-09,16625236,Stephanie,We had a wonderful first airbnb experience. Cute place with everything you could need. Walking distance to great restaurants. Very accommodating people. Thank You. 
6387576,35278781,2015-06-16,35724391,Alyssa,"Awesome little apartment in Capitol Hill. Joe was super welcoming and helpful! We enjoyed meeting our neighbors as well - it's always fun to meet fellow travelers! The space was neat, well stocked with anything we may have forgotten or needed, and very cozy - as named. (:"

6387576,36318326,2015-06-27,27834021,Sara,"We were only in Seattle for the last night of our honeymoon, but Joe made us feel so at home in this beautiful oasis. We were greeted with a gift and giving great words of wisdom about where to go and what to see. Joe and Ronnimae have been in Seattle a long time and are able to offer great advice about their beautiful city. We would recommend staying here to anyone considering a trip to Seattle. We hope to be back one day!"
6387576,36645684,2015-06-29,5337549,Diana,Ronniemae & Joe were wonderful hosts & I appreciate their quick response & flexibility in hosting me last minute. The space is absolutely lovely & so close to everything! I only wish I could have stayed for more than one night! I'll definitely book with them again when I return to Seattle.
6387576,36734337,2015-06-30,30123970,Tori,This was our first airbnb and it was a great experience. Excellent location in Seattle. Clean place and great amenities. I would stay again! 
6387576,36900380,2015-07-02,35816841,Torrin,"We had a great first time airbnb experience staying here. Joe was a wonderful host, welcomed us when we arrived and made sure we got settled and had everything we needed. We unfortunately didn't get to meet Ronnimae, but I'm sure she's great too! The location was awesome, right by Capitol Hill with restaurants and coffee shops very close. Also, was a reasonable 30 minute walk or short uber ride to downtown. For the great location and amenities provided the cost to stay here was reasonable (much better than the hotel options). Would definitely stay here again, and highly recommend!"
6387576,36994183,2015-07-03,28029377,Trevor,"Joe was very friendly, made sure we had what we needed, and contacted us immediately after our departure about an item left in the room. The neighborhood is great, walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill."
6387576,37682824,2015-07-09,36132477,Chelsea,This was our first Airbnb experience and it was a wonderful one. The location was absolutely perfect. We could walk to all major sites. The hosts were beyond friendly and always willing to answer our questions! We even got the chance to meet their cats and their adorably large dog George! I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seattle to stay here! You won't be disappointed!
6387576,38148801,2015-07-13,3101766,Valeria,"If you are looking for a quiet little oasis in Seattle this is it! A great cozy home, clean, comfortable, with positive atmosphere. It is really near to downtown.
The pictures are extremely accurate. Anything you could need during your stay is provided. Thanks!"
6387576,42309182,2015-08-12,25279529,Janice,"Clean, comfortable accommodations with thoughtful  touches in the room, common area, and shared bathroom to enhance your stay. In a great location, on Capitol Hill with excellent  cafes and restaurants within easy walk. Fit my needs, and within reasonable budget compared to the crazy Seattle summer hotel prices!"
6387576,42899110,2015-08-16,38408346,E,"It was a cozy room in a quiet neighborhood. They were also very accommodating to my late check in and check out. Even though there was some shared space, I had total privacy. "

Check-in was easy and it was simple from there on out. We felt very secure. We did not get to meet the hosts, but you can tell they take pride in their home and put effort into making a comfortable stay for their guests.

6387576,43624878,2015-08-21,2461902,Danielle,"We didn't get a chance to meet Joe and Ronnimae as they were on vacation during our stay, but they were very responsive leading up to the trip and had someone meet us when we arrived and be available whenever we needed anything. The bedroom was cozy but the bed was extremely comfortable and the place is in a great neighborhood--full of restaurants and bars and an easy bus ride to downtown. It was a great place to stay and I would highly recommend!"
6387576,45076865,2015-08-31,6884941,Lisa,"A lovely little room in a perfect location -- close to Broadway, close to buses, close to everything!

6387576,45945046,2015-09-07,11603679,Nathan,"My girlfriend and I really couldn't have asked for a better place to stay in capital hill during bumbershoot! Walking distance to just about everything, including downtown. The common space is shared, but that's clear from the description. Joe was happy to give us recommendations and help in any way possible. I only wish we could have stayed for longer!"
6387576,46278218,2015-09-09,7197989,Kevin,This was a great place to stay. The listing completely captured the spirit of the accommodations. Joe & Ronnimae really evoke the spirit of Airbnb. They are interested and available and made everything easy. It was a cozy place in a great location. Easy to get to from downtown and TONS to do in the neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend this place!
6387576,46841190,2015-09-13,43828989,Cynthia,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the charming Oasis.  We got to meet Joe and he was a really helpful in providing us insight into the neighborhood and how to get around the city.  Next time we may not bother with a rental car.  We didn't realize how good public transportation was here!  Joe was very knowledgeable about music and we had a great time talking about our likes and sharing our observations about bands and cultures.  They were very hospitable and the room was very cosy / cute.  They provided us with bottles of water and Skittles, and having the little refrig,  Microwave, coffee maker,  and popcorn popper was a treat.  We would recommend them as host, and stay again if we need a place. "
6387576,47137542,2015-09-15,24717242,John,Joe and Ronnimae were fantastic hosts and we're super easy to reach for letting us into their place. Very welcoming and friendly. Their place is perfectly located in Capitol Hill just blocks away from some great bars and restaurants on Broadway and 12th St. The place is clean and quaint. I will definitely try to stay here again next time I'm up in Seattle.
6387576,47246367,2015-09-17,34777133,Bette,"The location was absolutely perfect for us, being it was just two blocks for our son and daughter in law's small apartment.  We were able to leave our rental car parked at the house when we were visiting and they could walk to us to travel on day trips in our car.  The room was nice and the common area was great to relax after a long day hiking.  I was glad we were the not ones using that space during our stay.  I was not too keen on sharing a bathroom if someone had been booked in the other room.  Joe made us feel welcome in his home and they provided many amenities, if we had needed anything.  I was not expecting wifi access so that was a bonus.  The chickens on the property were interesting as well and very well behaved.  We would stay here again on a return visit to see family."
6387576,48294075,2015-09-25,25658462,Chris & Megan,"We had a great stay, and the host was both welcoming and accommodating. He even sent us text updates about our room and other events going on in town during our stay. The property is secluded from the rest of the house, and on a very quiet street, but still a short walk form busy restaurants and night life. Couldn't have asked for a better location. It's a bit of a walk to the downtown/market area, but we walked it back and forth everyday with no issue. We would definitely recommend this property to others using Airbnb in Seattle."
6387576,48944794,2015-09-29,5370800,Natalie,"Wonderful experience! Spacious, beautiful room, centrally located. Joe was very welcoming and gave us a lot of great tips. It was a pleasure staying here."
6387576,49152653,2015-10-01,42307321,Catherine,"We stayed in Joe and Ronnimae,s place for a couple of days at the beginning of our trip. They were extremely nice and welcoming, even helping us to locate a bag lost by the airline.  They also had plenty of helpful tips and advise about the local neighbourhood, which is definitely the best location to stay in Seattle.  The flat itself is comfortable and private (we had the place to ourselves), and has all you need for a good stay. Thanks Cath and Rob"
6387576,49849116,2015-10-06,45328072,Eve,"Joe and Ronniemae's Oasis is a very charming spot! This was my first airbnb experience and it won't be my last! I loved all the small touches and consideration that Joe and Ronniemae put into their airbnb. Everything is labeled which makes it easy to remember where things go away, and there are plentiful seattle guides for every interest group available for reference. Joe stayed up late to show us in because we got in rather late, and he had lots of great suggestions on where to go and what to eat! All together a lovely stay! "
6387576,50032217,2015-10-08,9749840,Tamara,"Joe was extremely friendly and accommodating. He waited for me despite I was late to the check-in agreed time due to traffic and work commitments. Although I stayed for only one night, it was extremely comfortable. Joe was waiting for me, showed me around and had a great enjoyable conversation with him. The place was very spacious and comfortable, it had everything you could ever think of. He even very kindly blocked the other room for me so I could have the entire place. The location was great, close to many restaurants yet very quite in a leafy residential street. I really enjoyed my stay and I will certainly be back when im in town. "
6387576,50201866,2015-10-10,4049123,Zalina,"Joe was very welcoming, and gave us great recommendations for our short stay in Seattle! The room was comfortable, and we had everything we needed."
6387576,50755991,2015-10-14,30776869,Wendy,"Could not have asked for a better experience. Lovely room, great bathroom, and the added bonus of a small living room with kitchenette! Location is great for dining and shopping with downtown an easy walk or bus ride. Joe was a very sweet host and I look forward to returning. Oh....and the bed was wonderful! Slept like a rock."
6387576,51207983,2015-10-18,15357540,Paul,"Joe and Ronniemae have a very sweet setup in a great location.

The bed is comfortable and warm, there is lots of space and  everything that a traveler needs in the common space between the two guest rooms. 

Hens cooed softly in the morning.

We had an excellent game of Go! in the common room. 

Joe also was also quite generous in allowing us to arrive early and leave our bags until a few hours after a normal checkout time.

6387576,52742094,2015-11-01,46041703,Courtney,"Everything worked out great! The in law was nice and looked exactly like the photos! Joe was also very helpful in giving us tips on where to go and what to even. He even was super flexible with our check in and check out time. Overall, we had a great experience and would come back for sure "
6387576,54755190,2015-11-23,17385643,Andrew,"I loved staying at Joe's place. The room and shared space are very comfy, and the location is great: very central, walking distance to downtown, just around the corner from restaurants and bookshops. Joe was super helpful with directions and advice for having a good stay, and George the St Bernard is a total sweetheart. I'd happily stay there again."
6387576,55098459,2015-11-28,19893346,Christine,"What an amazingly, cozy place to stay while visiting Seattle!  Very charming, flexible, laid back host that was super personable and is very knowledgable about pretty much anything you need or want around the nighborhood.  Easy, short walk to amazing food and pubs.  Two thumbs up here and as my first Airbnb experience, I don't think I can ever stay at a hotel again! "
6387576,56439695,2015-12-13,47806941,Cayenne,"The location is perfect for exploring Capitol Hill and adjacent neighborhoods and it couldn't be more convenient for catching the bus (two stops with routes that took us everywhere we wanted to go literally within 2-3 blocks).  It is also within realistic walking distance to downtown, but honestly we never walked the trek because the bus is just so easy (and it was winter and slightly drizzly and cool).

The apartment is adorable and charming and Joe far exceeded my expectations for a host. He was easy to contact for any questions, gave us some great locals tips for the neighborhood, and offered ideas for what to do on off-weather days. The apartment had tons of great resources for what to do and how to get there in Seattle, everything is labelled and accessible (love that they posted the WiFi password on the wall), and we loved that they had the most up to date copy of the Stranger waiting for us! That's how we found out about an awesome bluegrass evening in Fremont. As always we just wish we had more time to spend there. It would have been the perfect place to curl up and read a bit, but we were always on the go.  I'm considering returning to the ""charming oasis"" for a February trip. Couldn't have asked for more."
2194715,10169615,2014-02-03,7253162,Birsen,My husband and I loved staying with Brooke. She is very easy going and very hospitable. We loved the bed and the place. Nice towels and a great shower as well. The place is full with Brooke's own paintings which we enjoyed very much. We wish we had asked her to sell one of them to us. Maybe the next time! The apartment is convenient and in walking distance to Capitol Hill. We would definitely stay with her again!
2194715,10240181,2014-02-08,11867968,Lucas,"Brooke is laid back and interesting. Having said that, her apartment is clean, tidy and for an art lover, an experience on it's own. From the moment i walked into her cosy apartment (with a great view) i felt at ease. Brooke's place is close to everything. I was walking to the needle, Downtown Seattle and great restaurants on a daily basis. The nightlife and culinary delights Brooke lead me to were unforgettable. I would have missed everything hip that Seattle has to offer were it not for Brooke's local knowledge and helpful hosting. Cheers Brooke. Keep in touch!"
2194715,10256536,2014-02-09,11867968,Lucas,"I went back, and had even more fun! Cheers cobber!"
2194715,10329357,2014-02-13,11867968,Lucas,I went back to stay with Brooke for my last day in Seattle. She was kind enough to drop me at the train station. What a host!
2194715,10540374,2014-02-24,9685672,Paris & Olivea,"Brooke's apartment is a true artist space. Filled with greats works of art, supplies and great views of the city. Her apartment is conveniently located in Capital Hill close to so many points of interest. We stayed with Brooke for a show at the Paramount theater; we were close to everything we intended to do, so we parked our car for the weekend and walked everywhere. Parking wasn't as easy to find as we had hoped, but after circling her hood for a bit we got lucky with a spot just 4 blocks away. 

She provided yummy smelling, plush towels for the shower, and her bed was ultra cozy. 

We would definitely recommend her place to friends, and plan on staying again in the spring to see another show at the Paramount."
2194715,10661738,2014-03-02,11714245,Igna,"Brooke was very nice with us, her place is beautiful, with nice views of the city and of her art. We enjoyed staying in her place."
2194715,11130422,2014-03-22,12302330,Chenli,"Brooke's house has the most convenience to get to eat or entertainment on capital hill. Also, the view from her living room is fantastic, which allows you to see the space needle and the Olympic mountain. Brooke is also a talented artist. She has many collections. Maybe you will witness how an artist makes her painting. Sleeping quality is also high with soft mattress and absolute silence. Choose to live here for its low price with all those great reasons!"
2194715,11307625,2014-03-29,10494221,Mike,Brooke is an excellent host! She was very flexible with my situation of needing a last minute place to stay. She took great care of me of providing me coffee and breakfast in the morning and great conversations before having a nice night of rest. The view was beautiful both at night and in the morning.
2194715,11691075,2014-04-12,2441929,Wendy,"Brooke's apartment is right in the heart of Capitol Hill and was very convenient for me.  It is quiet, the bed is super comfortable, and she was very friendly and helpful.  It works well for a short stay ( one or two nights) as she gives up her bed and sleeps on the sofa. One night was all I needed, and it worked out well. Perfect for a short stay in Capitol Hill!                                                         "
2194715,11773906,2014-04-14,2131860,Jason,"Brooke was a welcoming host with a lovely home and a very soft bed. The view is spectacular outside, at night time the EMP lights fade into many colors, like an ethereal purple haze. The view inside is covered with Brooke's beautiful paintings. Her home is right on a main bus line and convenient to walk to clubs and restaurants. We will definitely try go back to Brooke's home when we visit Seattle."
2194715,12275282,2014-04-28,7765258,Alejandro,"Brooke is one of the friendliest and quirkiest people you will ever meet. Her apartment is clean, her bed cozy, and her fantastic art everywhere! There's a bus stop literally right outside the building, and most major tourist attractions are nearby. Capitol Hill itself is a small, lovely neighborhood with plenty of options for dining, drinking, or dancing. The perfect combination of price, location, lovely art, and a wonderful host make it an ideal place to stay in Seattle."
2194715,13509653,2014-05-29,5073218,Peter,"The location by itself was phenomenal.  A short walk away from a bunch of restaurants, bars, and the like.  Then throw Brooke into the mix and you can rest assured your trip will be smooth.  On my arrival, I had some stomach aches, and in the blink of an eye she brought me Pepto Bismol! The apartment was very clean and beautifully decorated (Brooke is quite the artist!), the bed was comfortable, and the view of the needle was breathtaking.  Brooke was fun to talk to, and since I was new to the area, suggested places to go and eat, which ended up being great! "
2194715,13634888,2014-06-01,15909860,Myriam,"Hello, this was my first time using airbnb. I went to Seattle for a wedding and needed to a place to stay for one night. I liked Brooke's apt because of its location.  Brooke's place is not far from the train stop which was nice. It is near all the main attractions. I met up with Brooke Friday morning, she gave me the key and we got to talk a little. She is really nice. Her art is really interesting. I spent most of Friday out with my friends and I left first thing Saturday morning. The bed was comfy and sheets were clean. She provided clean towels. The bathroom was clean. Her apartment is nice and she is very nice."
2194715,13790705,2014-06-04,13969986,Ed And Karen,"Brooke was awesome. We were getting in very late and she stayed up to greet us. Place was clean and organized.

We were in town looking for an apartment and she was very helpful in telling us about the different neighborhoods.
"
2194715,14575501,2014-06-22,16346446,Christopher,"Brooke is an engaging and energetic personality. She worked with us to get into her apartment and get us set up. Brooke gave us plenty of ideas on local places to visit and events that were going on, heck even invited us out to a concert! Her place is in reasonable walking distance to all the fun Seattle has to offer. We couldn't have asked for a better experience."
2194715,14770314,2014-06-26,1265173,Jerry,Brooke was a delightful host.  The room met our expectations and was convenient to local mass transit.
2194715,15575555,2014-07-12,2163024,Jennifer,Brooke was extremely friendly and welcoming. We appreciate her staying up late to greet us upon our very late arrival. The location was great and within walking distance to lots of the fun stuff we wanted to do. Beautiful view of the needle from her balcony and around her neighborhood! 
2194715,17133466,2014-08-07,1007327,Bill,"We had Brooke's place all to ourselves, as she took off on a bike tour. But not before she made us quite welcome.
Thanks Brooke!"
2194715,17555097,2014-08-14,12660946,Anthony,"We stayed 3 days at Brooke's place, but only met her for a couple of hours since her mother was visiting her. But Brooke is a very nice and talkative person, she even brought some french pastries from work, which we appreciated a lot as we're french people. Her place is very tidy and the view over the needle is just beautiful, especially at sunset. We recommend her!"
2194715,17623058,2014-08-15,16928663,Ryan,"Brooke's was a great host. The apartment was perfect for my short stay in Seattle. The neighborhood is very walkable,  with lots of great restaurants and nightlife. Would stay here again for sure!"
2194715,18810649,2014-09-01,18672924,Evan,"Brooke was a great host. Her apartment was clean, conveniently located, and beautifully decorated with her own artwork. We had everything we needed, and Brooke was happy to make suggestions on what to see in Seattle. 

Her bed is a little small (lengthwise), so tall people might have a problem. Other than that, I would highly recommend! "
2194715,19423793,2014-09-12,20029807,Bethany,"Staying at Brooke's apartment was very lovely and easy.  It's located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and is within walking distance to almost anything you would need.  She was able to accommodate me arriving earlier than I was supposed to, and was very friendly and a great resource for questions I had about getting around, places to eat, etc. I had a great experience with Brooke and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle.     "
2194715,20378644,2014-09-28,17198463,Ana,"Great view from the balcony! Located on the 3rd floor, Brooke's apt was comfortable and artsy! She was friendly, accommodating and able to give us great advice on what to check out in Seattle. Thank you for hosting us!"
2194715,21646128,2014-10-20,1444614,Art,"Brooke is a very good host - accommodating, helpful, friendly, unobtrusive but available.  Lots of natural light in this flat.  There is street parking although it may be 10 minutes walk away.  A minor negative:  the bed, although comfortable and clean, will be short if you are around six feet tall.  But for one night this was no problem for us."
2194715,22623277,2014-11-10,1674450,Eric,"The apartment was easy to find and Brooke gave great directions to the unit. She was there on-time to hand over the keys and gave us a quick rundown of what to expect and general housekeeping before heading off for the day. The listing matched the unit perfectly- Brooke's paintings were delightful to look at :) The view of the city/Space Needle from the balcony was spectacular and it was at a location that was not too far removed from the city centre. Most tourist attractions were accessible by walking (> 30 mins). Brooke made us feel very welcome and even took the time to share a conversation with us later when she returned for a few minutes in the evening (which she explained to us in advance).

Overall, great experience and would definitely recommend to friends considering AirBnB in Seattle."
2194715,25830029,2015-01-26,19429729,Brian,"Brooke was super accommodating, and her place is in a perfect location. Great view; quick walk to anywhere in the city; and the area around her house has fantastic food! "
2194715,26145942,2015-02-04,26994096,E,This place is a gem! Perfect location to get around town. Brooke was very friendly and accommodating to my needs.
2194715,26539119,2015-02-15,20769763,Garry,"Just as advertised. Very cute artist studio with  a beautiful view of the space needle, especially at night. Close to Cap Hill watering holes and a easy walk , bus or uber to downtown. Brooke is great !! very helpful and friendly."
2194715,28084107,2015-03-17,27378762,Annette,"Brooke was very welcoming and friendly, and the location was PERFECT! Beautiful view of the Space Needle, steps from a delicious coffee shop around the corner, and all the fun things to do on Capital Hill. Brooke's art is beautiful and she had good ideas of things to do and see in Seattle. Overall a very pleasant stay."
2194715,28383272,2015-03-23,24373514,Wes,"Good central location in an older building. You get a clear view of the Space Needle, which is really cool. We didn’t spend too much time in the apartment since we were out and about all day exploring the city. The neighborhood is excellent and provides a good deal of entertainment and delicious food. It is also entirely within walking distance of the Space Needle or Downtown. We learned early on that Seattle transit is a mess, so we walked almost everywhere or took the Link."
2194715,28891898,2015-03-31,1603196,Luke,"Brooke's apartment was the perfect base for exploring Capitol Hill and Seattle more generally: it's super clean and livable, full of great art, and has the best view in the city. Brooke was an amazing host: fun to chat with, flexible, and thoughtful (as well as bailing me out when I almost forgot my glasses in the bathroom!) I was incredibly impressed by the whole experience. "
2194715,29982072,2015-04-15,9490406,Levi,So glad that the room was in a very quiet location so I could sleep soundly!
2194715,30332543,2015-04-20,19359643,Paul,"Brooke is wonderful person who transformed her apartment in a warm inviting place to stay. And we really appreciate that she has her own art on display all over the apartment. The view from living room is just WOW, the Space Needle and the incredible mountain range on the background. 
 
We used Public transportation from the airport and took us a little over an hour.  
The neighborhood is great, just a couple of blocks walking and you fine dining and bars. Going downtown takes only couple of minutes with public transportation, or if you like hiking on the steep hills is just 20 minutes.

We are sure to visit Seattle again and really plan to stay at Brooke’s place again.  
"
2194715,33272075,2015-05-26,6453060,Aaron,"Brooke greeted us right when we arrived in Seattle, and was very cordial in showing us around her apartment. The space is sizable, with her artwork all around. The location was great, close to both downtown and Capitol Hill, with many offerings just a few blocks away. It was also easy to get to on public transportation."
2194715,33857576,2015-06-01,9035404,Shirley,"Brooke and her home definitely made our Seattle experience so much more awesome. 

It was very affordable, she had a lovely home with a great location (right next to all the cool spots on Cap Hill) and last but not least, Brooke was an amazing host. She's an artist and so her home is very nicely decorated and I loved all of her artwork (hoping you get famous soon!). Her airbnb was actually set for two people, however we had a party of three gals and she made it work for us. We also had a weird check in and check out time (check in at 12 midnight and check out at 7 PM), but she accommodated for us as well. Other airbnbs completely denied us due to our weird flight times, but Brooke saved the day. She also gave us great suggestions during our stay, must-visit locations and feedback on what we had on our itinerary. 

In the rush of leaving to the airport, I forgot my charger and she offered to send it to me via snail mail. Brooke, you're the BEST airbnb host ever. Airbnbers, if you're debating your stay here, debate no further, stay here! "
2194715,34769343,2015-06-12,27193518,Erin,"Brooke's apartment is exactly as advertised. It's her studio during the day so we saw her every now and then but in the evening we had the place to ourselves. The location is extremely convenient and we loved the neighborhood. The place served as the perfect crash pad -- with Brooke's beautiful art to boot!
She was also very accommodating. We arrived at midnight on the first night yet she had no problem greeting us and getting us settled so late. I'd definitely recommend Brooke's place to any couples or singles staying in Seattle."
2194715,35203071,2015-06-16,27193518,Erin,"Please see my other review. We stayed at Brooke's place for two nights, then took a trip up to the mountains before returning for another few nights. Both stays were comfortable and easy. "
2194715,37329702,2015-07-06,33729830,Yifan,"Brooke was a fantastic host and was very flexible with our check-in and -out times. She made sure we were well taken care of, even when she was not available in person. The space was well maintained and fit the description perfectly."
2194715,38673602,2015-07-17,36910547,Nina,"Brooke was responsive to our last minute booking and helpful with tips and info. We only stayed 1 night but her apartment was as described, bright and cozy and location is great. "
2194715,39234007,2015-07-21,6263624,Abhishek,Brooke was a great host! The apartment was exactly as described and beautifully decorated with many of her paintings. She was very flexible on check in and check out time which greatly helped us.
2194715,40108563,2015-07-28,6665085,Chris,"Awesome location, cozy apartment, and inspiring art all around. Highly recommended."
2194715,41007489,2015-08-03,25668821,Kamal,"Brooke had a very cute apartment that my friend and I rented for a short vacation trip. Brooke was super polite, easygoing, provided tips on what to do and where to go. It was definitely warm during the day because of the heat wave but we were out most of the day seeing the city. "
2194715,42718781,2015-08-15,38409514,Qing,The host is very nice and flexible regarding the check-in and check out time. The apartment is artistically decorated. Nice and cozy place!
2194715,45744047,2015-09-05,627024,Corey,"Brooke and her apartment were fantastic.  She was very flexible with check-in, and had everything ready for us when we arrived.  The apartment itself is a working artist's loft - Brooke is a really talented painter, and her work is displayed throughout the apartment.  

The bedroom was comfortable, and she left us with clean towels and extra shampoo/soap in the bathroom.  She has a great view from her balcony of the Space Needle.    

We had a wonderful time staying with Brooke, and would absolutely stay with her again when we're in Seattle.  "
2194715,46683005,2015-09-12,10263327,Joel,Brooke's place was nice and centrally located in a cool neighborhood 
2194715,48778084,2015-09-28,5006920,Lauren,"We loved our weekend trip staying in Brooke's place! The apartment was large, beautiful, and had an amazing view from the balcony of the Space Needle and the Puget Sound. I got to meet Brooke and her mom when I arrived a little early and they were lovely. I really enjoyed talking to them! Brooke is a really talented artist as well. After that first few hours, we were left alone in the apartment. Brooke was really flexible about our arrival time and arranging her plans around our schedule, which we really appreciated. The location was perfect if you're interested in being in the Capitol Hill neighborhood- we took the light rail from the airport and it was an easy 20 minute walk to downtown and the Pike Place Market. The apartment was comfortable- best couch ever if you have an extra person sleeping on it! We were a little cold but Brooke had lots of blankets. And we ran out of hot water one day but were fine the other days. Overall, beautiful place and would definitely recommend! "
2194715,49672098,2015-10-05,5346562,Mini,"This was one of the cutest airbnb we stayed in. Brooke's house has the aroma of art all around. Right from entering the house to smell linseed/terpentinish oily smell to her great paintings scattered all around along with inspiring hand-written inspirational notes pasted on the nooks and corners . We were lucky to have the house to ourselves over the weekend and it almost felt like our own. The best part of the house is her little patio that overlooks the space needle. She was also really nice patiently wait for us to let us in the night we arrived, while we maneuvered our way from the airport at midnight.
Brooke's house is also conveniently located in the heart of Seattle in an eclectic neighborhood.  A visit to the Starbucks exclusive reserve and brunch at Glo's is a must while you are here. It walkable distance to Seattle downtown too. 
I highly recommend staying at Brooke's to add to your Seattle experience."
2194715,50701843,2015-10-13,4895573,Jeany,"Brooke was a great host! She was busy the day of our stay but was flexible coordinating exchanging keys. She was accommodating and really responsive when it came to communicating.

The place itself is really nice, centrally located in Capitol Hill. A few minutes walk to anything interesting. The apartment is filled with Brooke's beautiful artwork and had a stunning stunning view of the Space Needle. I would definitely recommend staying here."
2194715,51370710,2015-10-19,23533430,Janie,Brooke's Capitol Hill Artist Loft was the perfect place to stay for our first trip to Seattle. It's located within a short walk to the fun restaurants/bars in Capitol Hill as well as Pike Place Market and the LINK stop at Westlake Center. Her loft was clean and welcoming with a spectacular view of the Space Needle. I would highly recommend her loft for anyone looking for a comfortable place to stay while exploring the city. 
2194715,57275760,2015-12-23,10216940,Craig,"Brooke's apartment was great, and is the perfect location for anyone wanting to get a true experience of living in Capitol Hill. Also has an incredible view of downtown Seattle and the Olympic mountain range. She was super flexible in arranging a time to exchange keys, and the apartment had everything I could of needed. "
1594313,7085612,2013-09-05,8503241,Andy,"Trish was very kind to take us in last minute after an extremely bad experience with our original Air BnB host left our family in a tough situation.  She went out of her way to accommodate our needs and her place is very comfortable and well appointed (extremely clean, nice furnishings, comfy beds and linens).  We had a wonderful stay and recommend these accommodations without any hesitation.  "
1594313,12210672,2014-04-26,13229923,Seth,Really enjoyed our stay here. Bedroom and en suite were great and Trish was the perfect host. We had complete privacy on the top floor but there was no problem at all using her kitchen downstairs for breakfast and she was always on hand for advice and couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. Recommended.
1594313,18785305,2014-09-01,12538646,Matias,"We lived one of the best summers in Seattle, living in the Trishann's house for 3 months. The town-house has all the services and the location is great, with a bus stop right in the front of the place. Trishann help us and was pretty kind, specially with our baby. "
1594313,18908162,2014-09-02,20083950,Shane,"Trishann was very accommodating on our late evening arrival. She took the time to coordinate with us on our arrival and to provide us with arrival information for access and property location.  When we arrived to our destination we had questions about parking. We messaged Trishann and she responded immediately. Trishann provided us with fresh towels and linens.  We were able to utilize the washer machine the day before we left which was nice because we had a lot of smelly clothes from our workouts at the gym. Trishann provided us with lots of good food options and input on downtown Seattle. We felt like we had the perfect amount of personal space during our stay. The property worked perfect for us as we were out and about most of the time. 
 "
1594313,20195691,2014-09-25,20411163,Alena,"NIce explaining messages everywhere, although we met her only at the last day, she was always accessible over email. Room is a little smaller than it apears at the picture but very comfortable"
1594313,23431334,2014-12-01,5993317,Brianna,"Trishann is an amazing host and her home was extremely lovely! This was my first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been any better. I was new to Seattle and in transition to getting settled in the city and stayed here for two months. Trishann was nothing but accommodating, super helpful, and always offering so much valuable Seattle advice. 

The room was very comfortable, the bathroom was huge, and everything was always kept very clean! The kitchen was always available for cooking, and something I appreciated very much was the access to the amazing laundry machines upstairs, Trishann even supplied the detergent which was wonderful! I never took the bus which had a stop literally feet from her front door, but parking was never an issue and always easy to find a spot nearby.

Trishann is very warm, welcoming, and easy to talk to. We watched a couple of Seahawks games and she even showed me the Ballard market one Sunday afternoon! She's a super host for a reason and I couldn't have asked for a better airbnb experience!!"
1594313,24593291,2014-12-31,15606071,Harry,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our recent one week stay at Trishann's townhouse while visiting our son, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren during the Christmas holidays. Her townhouse was exactly as shown, immaculately clean, and she was a wonderful host. We will definitely try to stay at her place on future trips to Seattle and I would recommend her to anybody that wants a quiet enjoyable experience. Harry"
1594313,26416686,2015-02-12,24830828,Korin,"Trishann was a phenomenal host. My experience in her home was better than anything I could have hoped for. I am a new, young professional to Seattle and she helped me make myself at home here during the transition of finding my own place. She recommended places to live, contacts to help with my search, good restaurants, best ways to avoid traffic. She loves Seattle and it has made her an amazing resource for visitors and new residents. Her rooms are very comfortable and clean. She is welcome to you making her place home during your stay. If you're looking for an in depth introduction to Seattle, you cannot go wrong staying with Trishann. Happy travels!"

1594313,41948382,2015-08-10,8486946,Abdulaziz,The experience in total was good. The house is nice and the location is great and it was very convenient stay in total.
1594313,44178507,2015-08-24,39248436,Joshua,"We loved our stay with Trish in Seattle. Her house is lovely, spacious and welcoming. She didn't hesitate to give us tips for our stay and made us feel at home within minutes of arising. Her house has a great location, close to downtown and on the bus route. The room was large and comfortable with an amazing Bathroom next door. There is no better place you could stay in Seattle!! "

Thanks for helping us salvage our trip and making it an amazing experience."
1594313,46311215,2015-09-09,34827426,Lysa,Trishann was very welcoming. I booked a late flight and she left very clear instructions on how to find her place and get in. She was very responsive to all my questions before my arrival and during my stay. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. The room/house was as advertised. Very clean house and a lot of light enters the bedroom but the black out shade helped for the mornings we slept in. If I'm ever in Seattle again I would love to stay here.
1594313,47220839,2015-09-16,9868796,Sushrut,Trishann was very accommodating with our late evening arrival and early morning departure. The master bed was very comfortable and the fan helped keep the temperature down when it got warm (uncommon for Seattle)! Towels were laid out nicely and parking was easy to find. We liked the Greenwood Ave location and found it convenient to Seattle.
1594313,47570896,2015-09-20,42486666,Wences,"Trish was great with the three of us, she's such a nice person, and very helpful! The place is very clean and a very relax area! I will definitely choose this place on my next trip to Seattle! "

1219691,5358239,2013-06-25,6519545,Siobhan,"I had a great first Airbnb experience in April and Mike's lovely cottage. It is a beautiful blend of the old fashioned coupled with modern updates throughout. April left an abundance of food, more than I could eat in a week and then she left me to myself, which was great!

The house is bright, sunny, and quiet; great for a couple or a small family as the neighborhood is vibrant and friendly. Every room was very clean, well furnished, came with loving details in the decor/book choices that made me feel very much at home and very comfortable. Highly recommended!"
1219691,5424714,2013-06-29,6519545,Siobhan,"Lovely cottage feel, yet very clean and modern as it has been updated with a modern bathroom and many conveniences. April was lovely and provided everything you could need for a perfect visit to Seattle. I recommend it for anyone who's looking for a base to explore the city and its environs."
1219691,5499659,2013-07-02,6950280,Prafull,"April and Mike were extremely friendly and welcoming. Although we just stayed for just 2 nights , we would love to go back and stay at their place for a week sometime. The home was just perfect for us and our 2 kids , the hosts were very sensitive to ur needs as a family and had everything in the home we could have asked for. A true home away for home!"
1219691,5793932,2013-07-16,7157063,Jackson,"What a wonderful place to land after 2,000M road trip. We stayed for a week: tastefully furnished, modern bathroom, kitchen had everything, both bedrooms inviting and comfortable, and the hosts couldn't have been better. We had to go home, but we didn't want to leave this charming cottage. Ted Kagy"
1219691,5878674,2013-07-20,3620943,Steffen,We had a great time at the cottage. April is such a wonderful host and the cottage itself is a dream. Our daughter loved that she could watch Netflix. Would love to visit again!
1219691,6333239,2013-08-08,1343633,Sharon,Staying in April and Mike's cottage truly felt like home away from home.  Thoughtful touches (including a basket full of goodies!) made my work week in Seattle feel more like a vacation.  I highly recommend this cozy little cottage and these wonderful hosts!
1219691,7010034,2013-09-03,7054396,Max,"Had a great time at the cottage! Stayed four nights with four people and we all fit and slept wonderfully. Waking up to an overhead shower with heated floor and a cup of coffee in the backyard beats any motel downtown.

April and Mike were both kind and quick to respond to any request.

Would definitely stay here again."
1219691,7229171,2013-09-11,7612131,Patty,"April is a wonderful host! Warmly greeting us when we checked in and said goodbye to us upon check-out with her lovely doggie Emma!
It was obvious how much effort they all put into making this cottage so comfortable to live in. 
Equipped with kitchen tools that allow you to make anything possible, comfy beds, access to Netflix, well-stored fridge, bookshelf of various genres of books, fresh flowers from the garden on the kitchen table... the list goes on and on! 
We all had a wonderful time and was delighted to have April as our host! We hope to come back again!"
1219691,7368865,2013-09-17,4752358,Janet,"We loved staying in the restored cottage. Mike and April seem to have thought of everything to make staying there enjoyable. The beds were especially comfortable and the groceries were a very generous addition.
Janet and Keith W."
1219691,7528604,2013-09-23,8670990,Lorrin,The cottage was incredible and felt more like home than any other place we visited.  April was a great host and we told her that we were baking before the trip and she left baking items inside the house.  I highly recommend this place for anyone that wants to stay in Seattle.
1219691,7706983,2013-09-30,230563,Barbara,"We loved staying in the little cottage!  Charmingly decorated and thoughtfully appointed, it housed the 3 of us very comfortably, and made an excellent base for our Seattle adventures.  The beds were quite comfy, towels were thick and soft, and the cottage had everything we needed and more (April will stock most anything you ask for, and there are plenty of kitchen staples like flour, butter, oil, eggs, seasonings, even yeast, baking powder, etc...if you want to bake some cookies or such, everything is there for you, including a number of cook books).  We just had to buy some meat and a few veggies and we were set.  The living room is pleasant and comfortable; we had several nice little music jams there.  

There are lots of extras you don't usually see in an AirBnB rental (not only shampoo, conditioner and soap, for example, but also bandaids, toothpaste, nail polish remover, sunblock...).  There's even a heated floor in the bathroom, so your tootsies don't get cold when you step away from the shower (such luxury!  ;-).  Every room has a heater, so you won't be chilly.  We had a very pleasant stay, and can recommend the cottage for your personal Seattle sojourns.  

Bring your GPS if you have one, though: the street is so tiny it's a blink-and-you-missed-it.  Watch for the break in the double yellow line; you'll see that before you can see the street.  "
1219691,11659199,2014-04-11,12039772,Betsy,"This is a cute little house, perfect for a couple or two. Very handy to north Seattle and an easy run to downtown. It was stocked with basic foods like bread, cheese, milk, coffee and cereal when we arrived, enough to keep us going for the 5 days we were there. We really appreciated that! April is next door and very available when we needed anything. We enjoyed our stay! "
1219691,14936003,2014-06-29,9110967,Scott,"I concur with all of the previous reviews: The Cottage and host April were wonderful!  As both an Airbnb guest and a host (https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/2777663) it's interesting to compare how others handle their listings.  April and Mike did a wonderful job in every category; starting with communication and directions prior to arrival, check-in, pre-stocked food and snacks,  providing a clean and well appointed home, and projecting an overall sense that we were truly welcomed.  April replied to our last minute request to add an extra guest with warmth and grace.  Thanks you so much for making the cottage available to us!"
1219691,16286217,2014-07-25,9331082,Annette,"We had a very warm welcome. we arrived around 11 p.m. after a journey of 24 hours and we found food in the fridge and coffee, cookies and everything you need. it was a charming house, very clean, with a wonderful garden. we really enjoyed staying there and when we will be next time at Seattle we will definitely sta in this house again."
1219691,19413580,2014-09-12,5160352,Hope,"Staying in this cottage was delightful. There was plenty of tea & quite a few breakfast choices. The kitchen was well stocked & everything was easy to find. I immediately felt at home as the note April & Mike left encouraged me to look through drawers. The book selection was marvelous & I enjoyed the lavender & cherry tomatoes in the charming backyard. It was nice to sit in the backyard at a table with our old college friend & catch up & watch the stars. The washer & dryer were so convenient. Unfortunately when we put the detergent on the top we didn't secure it very well & it fell down spilling over a rug. April was very understanding about this mistake. You could tell how much we felt at home here, because after just two days we had our stuff unpacked & spread throughout the cottage. We were very sad to leave & hope to be back some day. It was an enchanting experience & it's hard to express how much we appreciated all the work & care it took to create this atmosphere."
1219691,22594171,2014-11-10,22210753,Deanna,This cottage was beautiful and perfect for our family. It came equipped with everything someone would need to cook a meal or fix a snack. One of the highlights were definitely the heated floors in the bathroom and all of the extra towels and quilts. We felt at home the entire time!
1219691,24666599,2015-01-01,12742119,Deepika,"This wonderful home was one of the best places my friends and I have stayed in. Everything about the house was inviting, from the heated bathroom floors, to the well-stocked kitchen, to the wonderful books available for our reading pleasure. We were able to meet our host only for a few minutes, but we felt very welcome in her place. Would love to stay here the next time we visit Seattle!"
1219691,27777011,2015-03-11,18997009,Rebecca,"What a lovely trip to Seattle.  We were able to get together with friends and family.  Staying at this cottage in Seattle is so much better than a hotel; it feels like you are staying at your aunt's house.  The hosts are available but not intrusive.  The house has a wonderfully appointed kitchen and next time we come, I might just bake some muffins, the kitchen has everything!  The cottage is very clean, the bathroom has a heated floor, and even though in the midst of a city, it is silent ( I treasure quiet since I work in an ICU).  Also another benefit of staying in a lovely home is that we got to sleep under flannel sheets and pretty quilts.  We will happily be coming back.
"
1219691,34332462,2015-06-07,33528638,Roni,It was a delightful stay at April and Mikes cottage.  They didnt leave any detail out in making our weekend stay feel at home. My husband and I enjoyed evenings in the cozy and peaceful backyard while our children played hide and seek in the pathways and shade of the trees and plants of the beautiful Puget Sound.
1219691,40395000,2015-07-30,1858380,Katharine,"This was perhaps our best Airbnb experience to date, and we've used Airbnb all over the world! April is an incredibly generous and thoughtful host. The cottage is not only impeccably clean, conveniently located, adorably decorated/furnished, it was also so well-stocked with groceries, toiletries, towels, books, etc. that we felt we were in our own home-away-from-home or staying with a family member! I wish I could buy this cottage as-is and live in it forever. :) The backyard is also lovely and we enjoyed having our breakfast outdoors. Truly cozy!

For those unfamiliar with the area, this cottage is very well-located if you are in Seattle with a car as it is smack-dab between the I-5 and Aurora/Hwy 99 which are your two main North-South routes around the area. There are normal and express bus lines along Aurora too, if you are here without a car, so you can fairly easily get downtown or to other neighborhoods (and of course there are lots of Uber drivers in Seattle and they could get to you easily here). This rental is a great value in my opinion bc you get so much more for your money than at a hotel. Highly, highly recommended! I hope we can stay here again when in town visiting relatives. "
1219691,42588935,2015-08-14,39771122,Qinyi,"It's a cute and tidy house. April and Mike are so kind that they have bought us many food to eat especially Chinese rice and snacks. It's really a delightful experience of Airbnb in Mike and April's cottage, both the cottage and host are sweet."
1219691,44901759,2015-08-30,15287678,Dan,"Our stay at ""the cottage"" was terrific. My brother, sister and I were visiting our other sister in Edmonds, so it was only about a 15 drive. (Only my brother and I stayed here.)

I contacted April after we had lunch on our arrival day and we agreed on when we would check in. The cottage was freshly cleaned, well equipped and well stocked. Washer and dryer, spacious full bathroom, a kitchen with abundantly more cooking and eating supplies that you would normally encounter. It was quaint, comfy and homey. Quite frankly I felt more like I was house sitting for a friend  as opposed to staying at temporary housing while away from home.

April was delightful and gracious as our host.  We are pretty low maintenance so we did not need anything from her while we were there, but if we did I would not have hesitated to contact April due to her generous nature. There was quite a bit of starter food already in stock in the cottage when we arrived (i.e., milk, an assortment of teas, milk, condiments and seasonings, etc.). However, April arrived with groceries providing us some breakfast foods (eggs, OJ, English muffins, bananas, a fresh bag of coffee, etc.). She also walked us through the cottage and pointed out certain need to knows.  She also had detailed instructions on the city mandated recycling/composting/garbage requirements so we could follow them as best as possible.  I did leave an item behind and April secured it for me until me sister was able to come by and pick it up.

The cottage was a great. homey place to stay.  I would definitely stay there again and would encourage any visitors to the Seattle area to consider staying here as well."
1219691,52309183,2015-10-28,32699646,Donna,"This 'Sweet 1920's cottage' is just as described.  We were very happy to drive up and see a well tended yard in a nice neighborhood.  The cottage was clean, well maintained and very well stocked with dishes, kitchen items, linens, bedding, etc.  My husband loved the music docking station (for his iphone).  April and Mike are easy owners and were helpful when needed.  The location of the cottage is also convenient...a short drive into Seattle or north to the Edmonds area.  The queen bed in the master bedroom was comfortable!  That's important.  "
4574700,36674239,2015-06-30,32358410,Robert,A great house in a great area of Seattle. The host is very friendly and thoughtful. Would definitely stay here again. 
4574700,45336041,2015-09-01,3413907,Joseph,"A week before nine of us were coming to Seattle for the Penny Arcade Expo I was informed that one of my two AirBnB rentals was being canceled due to unforeseen circumstances.  This led me scrambling to find alternate housing for me and three of my friends and I was incredibly fortunate to stumble across Tina.
 
It wasn’t remotely close to the other location my friends were staying downtown but it was in a lovely neighborhood we had stayed in before via AirBnB.  Fortunately, we had rented a car, but Tina’s house was a brief walk (~ 1 block) to a bus line that could have taken us to and from the Seattle convention center easily.  We also used Uber a couple of nights that some of us stayed out late and the fees weren’t unreasonable so that’s another option as well if you don’t have your own transportation.
 
There were issues with AirBnB’s website in trying to get the space booked, but Tina was very helpful and forthcoming with the process as she did her best to accommodate my request, which eventually went through.
 
As for the space itself, she has a lovely house that we all thoroughly enjoyed staying in.  My three friends (1 couple, 1 single) stayed upstairs and shared a bathroom while I stayed in the basement and got my own.  
 
I also agreed to let their cat, Lyric, stay in the house with us though boarding her was an option.  While we were happy to have her stay, it is important to note that if you choose to do so you need to feed her twice a day (8am and 6pm was suggested), though you don’t need to worry about the litterbox.  She is a VERY friendly cat and she’ll want spend lots of time with you including sleeping with you, so if you are staying in the basement expect to be visited by her during the night.  Also, she has a habit of sprinting around the house around 6-7am in the morning, so if you’re a light sleeper I recommend one of the bedrooms upstairs with a door. :D
 
All in all, it was a lovely trip and I would absolutely recommend Tina to anyone traveling to Seattle who was their own transportation or doesn’t mind riding the bus or using cabs.   "
5364119,27706485,2015-03-09,1562357,Stephanie,"I had the best experience in the Peaceful Basement Bungalow; these ladies are awesome! The house is beautiful, clean and really nicely decorated, and my little basement room was super cozy. I actually slept better in the little sleeping nook than I normally do at home.

I also found the hosts really helpful and attentive - I was a bit concerned about having to share the kitchen and bathroom, but they're both so relaxed and friendly that it was a non-issue.

The neighbourhood was also a pleasant surprise - I was super close to the light rail to get downtown, but also had access to cute restaurants, an awesome community coffee shop, and a great park with running trails.

All in all a great experience; I'd definitely go back!"
5364119,28739048,2015-03-29,25613038,Natalia,"Great place! The room is a comfortable den/basement in an adorable 1930s style bungalow house. Naomi and Jeannine were immensely helpful and did everything they could to make our stay comfortable, including allowing us full access to the kitchen. Conveniently located in a beautiful neighborhood, only a short train ride away from down town Seattle. Would definitely recommend! "
5364119,29805818,2015-04-12,30651021,Fabian,Hosting there was a gewat experience. The girls including Violet were always friendly and we enjiyed so much to talk with them. My Brother and I strongly recommend it.
5364119,30164588,2015-04-18,30854416,Meredith,"This space was very comfortable and clean.  It was set up exactly like the picture, even to the detail of fresh flowers on the coffee table.  We slept well and enjoyed meeting our hosts, Naomi, Jeannine and Violet.  They gave great recommendations for food and coffee, and the neighborhood overall felt very safe, comfortable, and accessible.  We hope to visit again when we come through Seattle again."
5364119,30272504,2015-04-19,24639511,Nyisha,"Moon was absolutely wonderful, welcoming and friendly! Although my stay was short I really felt right at home. 


"
5364119,30371807,2015-04-20,31149398,Taylor,"This was such a cute and cozy basement room! Perfect space for two people. My boyfriend and I loved the bedroom nook, the comfy environment, and the privacy. Wish we could have stayed more than a night. "
5364119,30902072,2015-04-28,30552214,Georgia,"My partner and I had a fantastic time in our little basement room. It was cosy, warm and spacious. The bed was by far the most comfortable bed we have stayed in on our travels. The house was also very beautiful, neat and clean and in a great location close to the light rail and to a supermarket as well. Although we did not get a chance to meet our gracious hosts as they were too travelling, they were kind enough to leave us a list of things to do in the neighbourhood and were very adamant in letting us know that they would be contactable if need be. The description is right though, I would not recommend staying here if you are much taller than 5ft6"" but I feel this was a great first time airbnb experience for us. Would definitely stay here again."
5364119,31258996,2015-05-03,13964538,Carly,"My fiance and I had a really wonderful time staying here.  We had a short visit, but were readily welcomed by Jeanine.  We slept so well on the comfortable bed, and loved the nearby latenight restaurant and early morning coffee shop.  I would recommend this place as a quiet and wonderful alternative to staying in downtown Seattle.  The park was beautiful, and the neighborhood itself was a treat to wander around in.  The lightlink is a short walk away, so access to the airport and other areas of Seattle is an ease to find.  We couldn't have asked for anything better."
5364119,32368448,2015-05-17,31477686,Elizabeth,"Moon and Jeannine were beyond awesome! They suggested some great places to eat in the neighborhood and provided us with many helpful tips for my friend and I's first time in Seattle. The dog, Violet, was definitely a plus and was very friendly and adorable!  We also loved the convenience of how close it was to both bus & a light rail stop.  Would definitely recommend staying here!"
5364119,32996713,2015-05-24,31242802,Hannah,"Jeannine (and Moon, who unfortunately was away when we stayed) made my boyfriend and I feel welcome from the moment we arrived. She invited us in and told us about Seattle and what it has to offer. She was also quick to suggest places to eat around town, and gave us options for a nice last day in town. We took a lot of her recommendations, and were so pleased with the places we visited! The basement bungalow is so cute and cozy, and the bed was insanely comfortable! The area was really nice, and we appreciated being in walking distance of so many things (light rail included). We would stay again the next time we're out West!"
5364119,33175728,2015-05-25,21572714,Kathryn,"Such a great stay! The space was cozy, adorable, and exactly what we needed. I would absolutely recommend staying here. "
5364119,33732390,2015-05-31,8264217,Aimee,"Had a very lovely stay in this room, very private and accurate to the description and pictures. The hosts were very accommodating and it was nice to have our own quiet space and keys to lock up. Great neighborhood, 10 minute drive from downtown and enjoyed a local Mexican bistro and coffee house. Violet was such an adorable dog!!! Thanks again!"
5364119,34474641,2015-06-08,17739919,Patty,"throughout our stay in this lovely home Moon was more than welcoming and helpful. that was our first time in the area and they provided us with a lot of local recommendations. the location is awesome, & close to downtown. I would definitely recommend Moons cozy basement. "
5364119,34977258,2015-06-14,33068143,Laura,"Naomi and Jannine were very welcoming. The room was perfect-a peaceful retreat.  Haille and I really enjoyed the visit from Violet in the morning!  The neighborhood was also great, with restaurants and light-rail to downtown within minutes.  For our inaugural AirBnB experience, we couldn't have asked for better."
5364119,37554530,2015-07-08,11336391,Jessica,"My favorite thing about this place? The bed. The bed here is surprisingly and amazingly comfortable. I didn't want to leave it. 

We felt really welcomed and got a lot of great tips from Jeanine about taking the light rail. Location is super convenient if you're going to either stadium (we were) and want to take public transit. 

It's also a really short walk to some good coffee shops, bars, and restaurants. We would definitely stay here again if we were in the area! "
5364119,41894897,2015-08-09,25090827,Akbar,I felt at home immediately after my arrival. Thank you very much Moon.
5364119,43956108,2015-08-23,38002719,Daryl,"Naomi and Jeannine have created a most amazing space for you to stay.  The bed is unbelievably comfortable, we were made to feel most welcome when we met them the first morning.  Instructions and communication were superb.  And don't even get me started on the decor/ambiance.. Very zen!

I will gladly visit this airbnb again if I have the chance!"
5364119,45820198,2015-09-06,40553449,Dwayne,If i could describe mother moons basement bungalow experience in one word it would be awesome. Very cozy and close to downtown. The host and her dog were very welcoming and made me and my friend feel right at home. 
5364119,46157095,2015-09-08,38583573,Lorenzo,"We stayed 2 nights at Naomi and Jeannine's and we were treated with such a great hospitality. I recommend this place to everyone who is seeking a comfortable place to stay, lots of privacy, and a friendly environment. Jeannine, Naomi, and Violet, interacted with us, making us feeling right at home.

Thank you for the wonderful experience!"
5364119,46934188,2015-09-14,41820170,Josephine,We really loved staying at this wonderful location. The room was cozy and the perfect thing to come home to after full day in Seattle. We appreciated the warm and welcoming atmosphere that our host created for us. The location was great and we felt right at home. 
5364119,48528780,2015-09-27,40321555,Mariko,Our stay was perfect. The room was cozy and quaint. It was a great neighborhood with easy access to public transportation. Our hosts and violet were extremely welcoming and friendly. We look forward to revisiting and recommending this bnb to friends. 
5364119,49681672,2015-10-05,44390943,Curtis,"The room is great, and in a great neighborhood. Naomi and Janine left out everything I needed, including info about transit, the neighborhood, et cetera. A very quick bus or light rail to most places in Seattle, or an even quicker Lyft. The ceiling is, as the listing states, 6 feet high (at the bottom of the rafters), so I had to crouch a bit when I walked around (I'm just over 6 ft), but it was still a fantastic room. Great room and bed. Also, their bulldog is super friendly, but I was out early and back late, so only got to pet her a couple times."
5364119,50246657,2015-10-10,3453392,Kari,"This cozy basement bedroom was private, quiet, clean, comfortable, and ridiculously cute.  Located in a great residential neighbourhood with our lovely, welcoming hosts Naomi and Jeannine and of course, the fabulous Violet.  The house is outside of downtown, but cab fare was cheaper than we expected to get around and see the attractions.  If we ever return to Seattle, we'd love to stay there again!"
5242148,28345937,2015-03-22,1228097,BeeBee,"Raijina's home was absolutely beautiful and just as described as pictured. Raijina was very easy to deal with, she was very quick at returning message, she went above and beyond to ensure that we had a pleasant time during our time in Seattle.  She was very thoughtful, she even baked a cake for the kids and they loved it!  The house was spotless and very specious - perfect home for entertaining. There were 8 adults and 3 kids staying at the house and we were very comfortable. The location was great too - only 15-20 minutes from downtown Seattle without using I5.
Our friends loved the house and we will definitely stay hear again when we come to Seattle next time. Thanks Raijina for everything. You exceeded my expectation!"
5242148,29120496,2015-04-04,6794636,Andie,"We rented Raijina's home to take photos for our upcoming book about craft and interior and we are SO glad that we did. The space was immaculately decorated and perfectly clean, and the host even left us baked treats to use in our photos and enjoy. I highly recommend this space. Thank you so much, Raijina! "
5242148,30234531,2015-04-19,30378114,David,"What a beautiful home! It is just as lovely as the pictures. So roomy, modern and meticulously decorated. Our family stayed for 9 days and had other friends and family come visit on several of those nights. It was a perfect home for entertaining. The neighborhood was lovely and it was only a short walk to the light rail station. There's a park nearby our kids enjoyed so much that we made a special stop there on our way to the airport. From the fancy coffee maker to the collection of movies and video games, there is definitely something for everybody. We will definitely try and stay here again on our next visit to Seattle."
5242148,31183001,2015-05-03,28813032,Bill,"Raijina, our host, was to say the least, most gracious and totally accommodating to all our needs.  Our time was nicely spent with the comforts of home and the invite of a wonderful stay.  Raijina met us shortly after our arrival to be sure all was good, which it totally was, and for us to understand the electronics operations.  Our entire experience is summed up with:  ""I would highly recommend!""  "
5242148,32979975,2015-05-24,30384692,Taryn,Beautiful home! Host's where awesome! Would definitely recommend.
5242148,33110314,2015-05-25,4641703,Michael,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5242148,35342165,2015-06-17,34662552,Charles,"Gorgeous home, very comfortable!  Easy Uber into the city.  Would love to stay again!"
5242148,36372758,2015-06-28,1965923,Tina,The listing description was very accurate - beautiful home and great decor. Loved staying at this Airbnb!
5242148,37183686,2015-07-05,16116008,Wei-Te,"Raijina was responsive and answered all of my questions in a timely manner. Her house exceeds my original expectation, everything was just perfect. "
5242148,38852787,2015-07-19,33445478,Ahou,This house definitely exceeded all of our expectations. The house was extremely comfortable and clean and we enjoyed the quite neighborhood. The host was extremely helpful and responded quickly to all of our questions. I can truly say I definitely enjoyed our short stay in Seattle and I would do this all over again. Beautiful home!
5242148,39324933,2015-07-22,353020,Ralph,"My family and I had a great tip to Seattle, in part due to Raijina's comfortable house. Her place was spacious and had a fantastic kitchen and living room in which to hang out. Parking was relatively easy, although I did have once to park on a different block.  Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to meet Raijina, but she was extremely responsive to email. Overall, I would highly recommend her place. "
5242148,39557006,2015-07-24,399857,Magali,"Great place, great tastes, spotless, easy communication, that was the perfect place for me and my teammates."
5242148,39731931,2015-07-26,23979519,Rob,"Wonderful house, the host was very accommodating. Would definitely return."
5242148,40353520,2015-07-30,31182524,Tammy,"The house has the rare quality of being designistic and practical.  It's very well equipped, clean, and comfortable. The neighbourhood is not the most happening but once we got into the house, we wish we could spend more time there!"
5242148,40718196,2015-08-02,2380117,Janet,"Raijina and her crew had the house in immaculate shape upon our arrival, and even offered to let us check in a few hours early!  Raijina also has a well-organized ""Visitors' Book"" that was very helpful, with info about the house, its amenities and the neighborhood.  The airbnb description of the house is essentially accurate --- the only slight deviation to note is that the house has beds to accommodate only 8, although the living room couch is large enough for a ninth adult OR two children.  We were nine adults in all, and slept quite comfortably (despite a Seattle heat wave!).   

In fact, the house is AMAZING!!!! Interesting decor, comfortable bedrooms, wonderfully equipped kitchen and spacious dining area.  Perfect for our reunion!  "
5242148,41330160,2015-08-07,31654229,Zishuai,great house
5242148,41740504,2015-08-09,4659693,Dan,"Smart and stylish, Raijina's house met all of our eight-person, three-generation needs with ease. Open, modern kitchen. Fantastic light. Room to roam/entertain/find a bit of privacy ('cause, yeah, three generations). On top of all that, Raijina is a generous and responsive host. FIVE STARS!"
5242148,42618141,2015-08-14,9153223,Jason,Raijina's place is amazing for work or pleasure.  Although we did not take advantage of the various entertainment systems she has it did provide an excellent venue for my colleagues and I to work - good wifi throughout and even a white board!  I highly recommend it and will definitely be returning if the need arises for such a large and comfortable home.
5242148,42883695,2015-08-16,7024688,Kendall,Absolutely stunning place! Great welcoming message within the home and easy to work with. Would love to stay again!
5242148,43238334,2015-08-18,35497962,Nathan,"Beautiful house, totally worth the stay, made every minute wonderful, and an excellent host. She went out of her way to return property that we had left at her house. Impressive place. Well-maintained, well-furnished, well-everything! Highly recommend!"
5242148,43969795,2015-08-23,1511385,Yunnie,"The house was very stylish and amazing, decor and comfort thought about very carefully.  Bedrooms were comfortable and quiet, bathrooms very clean and modern.  Our host even baked us a yummy plum tart to welcome us!!  Neighborhood not central or ideal, but only a short drive away from all the fun places to visit.

Only negative was that it requires going up one long staircase to get to the front door, and the house has two levels with a long indoor staircase connecting both.  So not ideal for the very elderly or those with very active toddlers."
5242148,45923560,2015-09-07,16258019,Jeddy,"Raijina had a baked treat for us when we arrived and responded promptly to questions that we had. The house is as described and was great for what our group needed. We had 4 couples staying at the house and it accommodated us all comfortably. The only thing I would note is that the 4th bedroom downstairs has an air mattress and not an actual bed. Other than being a little surprised by that upon arrival, we had a great experience in this house! "
5242148,46768381,2015-09-13,31888290,Anthony,"Amazing weekend with a great group! Perfect communication from home owner and they were very helpful. House is perfect, everyone kept telling what a great job I did finding such an awesome house. The house is so cool, all the little aspects of it are noticed, the couch is the best! Lots of room, bathrooms and beds. Coolest wallpaper I've ever seen in the master bedroom. HIGHLY suggest this place to anyone and you will see what I mean! Thank you!"
5242148,50049205,2015-10-08,7453592,Jessica,"OMG!!!! Raijina was outstanding! I booked last minute and accommodated, I needed to stay longer and she accommodated, she responded quickly and was extremely helpful. The neighborhood is quiet the ball down stairs is a bar. The design is stellar and the kitchen is great to cook in. Everything about the house and Raijina is great. I am so grateful to her hosting us and taking care of all our needs. Thank Raijina for being Awesome and a great eye for home decor =)"
5242148,50402905,2015-10-11,44941904,Yichen,Real house is better than picture！Bathroom is luxury！Everyone is comfortable stay here！Location is not far to downtown！It is a good choice for me to choose this house！
5242148,50971157,2015-10-16,11450381,Matthew,Great space...great communications with the host.  These are definitely the nicest digs on the block.  I would love to stay here again.  
5242148,51161577,2015-10-18,27595150,Lauren,I want to start off by saying I rent Air BNBs often and this has been my first somewhat negative experience. The house is beautifully furnished and decorated. They did a great job in this aspect. The house is modern but still cozy. It is however not in the best part of town so just beware. There is only street parking which was kind of a pain to find. I rented this house for a party of 10. I think this house would be great for a party of 6-8. 3 of the 6 beds are air beds which was not clear under the house description or after chatting with the host. There was also only 5 bath towels in the entire house...for a party of 10 this is not acceptable. We had to do wash so the second half of the group could take showers. Overall this house is awesome but needs some improvements to accommodate large parties. 
5242148,52130020,2015-10-26,27748573,Joseph,"The house was exactly as described.  It provided comfortable, spacious accommodation for seven people.  The kitchen, dinning and living rooms were all very comfortable and provided us lots of room to hang out and relax.  We were able to walk all the way to Seward Park through a pleasant neighborhood.  A Safeway grocery store was within a 2 minute drive, and the inviting restaurants, bakery and shops of Columbia City were just 5 minutes away."
5242148,53314113,2015-11-07,21616327,Trudy,I was beyond pleased. The home is impeccably decorated. I had so much fun taking in the decor that I had to spend 30 minutes just walking around and admiring the detail. The internet speed was flawless. I had no issues getting online and I didn't get kick off or have any slow intervals. I was able to park on the street literally in front of the steps to the home. Probably my best Airbnb experience thus far.
5242148,54025139,2015-11-15,47798071,Robert,"When we first arrived into the house, we were in awe of how modern this house looked. It was just as the images and description were provided on the post. The master bedroom shower is great. We never have experienced squared shower heads but they were great. The open spaced kitchen was perfect and with the ability to play music in the kitchen made it just better. "
5242148,54950682,2015-11-25,34492282,Zubeidah,"I cannot rave any more about this place!! It's amazing! Everything you need or want are there in the home and the home is BEAUTIFUL and IMMACULATE!!! I cannot wait to visit again and stay here soon!! Rajaina was a sweet and responsive host. Very easy to communicate with. 

Note: only downside is the main street can be overwhelming scary since it's not particularly the best part of town but once you go a bit further in twds Seward Park, it's a very nice area. Also, parking was quite a challenge every day. Be sure to get back early enough to park."
5242148,55111980,2015-11-28,44885787,Kathryn,The host was very honest and upfront with us and was always available to answer any questions for us. That was very much appreciated. The home was very clean and stocked with needed items. Kitchen was large  and spacious. The home was very pretty in all rooms and included extra details for children and babies. We were very comfortable in the entire home and would definately give it a thumbs up to family and friends. We had a wonderful time.
5242148,56948188,2015-12-20,49907061,Fonny,It was wonderful! The home is beautiful and very comfortable! 
5242148,57349080,2015-12-24,20242667,Rui,房子太棒了！我们住的非常舒服。屋子的装饰很特别我们很喜欢。新年快乐！
5242148,57507198,2015-12-27,6060389,Caprice,"Raijina was a lovely host.  The house is just as pictured and a great fit for larger groups.  The kitchen was stocked with all the tools necessary for my family to enjoy meals together around the large wooden table.  On top of it, Raijina was extremely communicative (even on Christmas Eve) when we had a couple questions. Highly recommended. "
5242148,58164429,2016-01-01,22387629,Smarak,This was a dream come true vacation for us. Raijina's house is no less than a dream. She was very helpful and accommodated all our requests. I would absolutely use this house when I visit this Seattle again and recommend the same to the community.  
6278181,44183234,2015-08-24,653250,Laura,"This is a beautiful house in a very nice walkable area of Seattle. Right next to a Thai restaurant, two cafes, a great brunch spot and an awesome pub. It is also 3 block from Greenlake Park which is surrounded by restaurants and cafes and it is a joy to walk around, our son loved the wading pool. 
Sierra was super accommodating when it came to sleeping arrangements, it is always hard to make a toddler sleep away from home but he slept like a log this time, Sierra even left a little teddy bear for him!
"
6278181,48607816,2015-09-27,990912,Greg,"This place is really nice and Sierra was excellent to work with.
Excellent neighborhood too, with some nice cafes and bars just a few doors down. Worked out perfectly!"
2686659,12929830,2014-05-14,12671468,Tracey,My host was friendly and knowledgeable about the area.  We spent an afternoon together having lunch and walking with her dog in the parks near her neighborhood and along Lake Washington.  She was always prompt in answering my questions by phone or e-mail.  The space is a cute basement apartment.  She put in a toaster oven as I was leaving but the double burner stove top and espresso maker  were definitely used.  The mini fridge worked great and the bed was extremely comfortable.  WiFi worked beautifully.  All in all a very positive stay.
2686659,13762133,2014-06-03,6603657,Lucia,"The apartment is in a great location for taking nice walks around South Seattle. Traci is very friendly and accommodating. Her dog is very sweet, too. We had a comfortable stay. Thanks, Traci!"
2686659,14701486,2014-06-24,5506702,Cydney,"This place is awesome. The location is beautiful, with an ample amount of street parking. The neighborhood felt totally safe walking my dog at all hours. Traci is so nice, she took me on a great afternoon walk with her dog around the lake, gave me some tea and a few bottles of cider, and was very gracious. She's very knowledgeable about the area. The bathroom has a totally rad claw-foot tub, perfect for soaking after a long day exploring the city. The bed is super comfy, and the living room was a great place to hang out and read a book. I would totally stay here again, and happily recommend it to anyone who's looking for a nice place in Seattle. "
2686659,16463240,2014-07-28,15429510,Stacey,"I cannot say enough about the wonderful experience I had in Seattle's Mt. Baker neighborhood! Traci is a terrific host, friendly, full of local knowledge and very accommodating. I spent 5 weeks in her comfortable basement bungalow and enjoyed every moment. From the comfy bed to the relaxing claw foot tub, it was an experience to remember. I'll definitely stay with Traci again and I recommend her property highly!"
2686659,16664269,2014-07-31,1776880,Emily,"My husband, dog, and I spent two nights at Traci's apartment and had a wonderful time. The pictures accurately represented the place. In fact, the space was larger than I expected. Traci was a great host, meeting us when we arrived and getting us settled. The space was clean, tidy, and well decorated. We loved the neighborhood and took Traci up on her suggestions for dining, dog walking, and swimming. We would definitely stay at Traci's place again."
2686659,16811756,2014-08-02,19074602,James,The place was nice and cozy! I liked the decorations in the place. The bed was very comfortable and it was a dark room which was nice for sleeping in the morning. The ceiling are not very high but at 6'2 only one section going into the bathroom required me to duck a bit. The location was pretty good we went downtown and to safeco field quite easily by transit. Our host Traci was really nice and generous. 
2686659,16930979,2014-08-04,2388258,Cheryl,"My husband and I were very comfortable in Traci's apartment. It is nicely decorated and equipped with a compact kitchen area. Traci took the time to orient us to the area, highlighting local restaurants and cycling route ideas. She has a friendly dog who greeted us upon our arrival. The apartment location worked great as it is close to the light rail station, with quick access to Seattle. "
2686659,17571954,2014-08-14,4048284,Ryan,"Traci was great to work with. All was smooth and her apartment is exactly what it describes. Private, organized, gardens, small kitchen, living space, etc. The Mt. Baker neighborhood is very quiet and cute, but within a 10 minute walk to the light rail. We would definitely recommend Traci's apartment to others. "
2686659,17719848,2014-08-16,19481833,Chase,"Traci was an amazing host! She made my first Airbnb experience so great, I can only hope to have more stays like this in the future! The place was very clean, cosy and welcoming. Great memories from my trip to Seattle!"
2686659,17900960,2014-08-18,19645824,Holly,"Traci's place was great. The pictures were very accurate.  The apartment was very clean, she had fresh towels, shampoo, and conditioner body wash. The bed was comfy and there were extra blankets as well. The antique touches were delightful and we enjoyed looking at all the pictures and knick knacks she had throughout the apartment. The neighborhood was quiet and we felt very safe.  Traci kept in touch with us and was there to open the apartment up, and give us the keys and a tour.  The kitchen was fully stocked and there was even coffee and a French press to be able to have my morning coffee. Everything was wonderful.  We would definitely stay at Traci's again.  "
2686659,18625875,2014-08-29,16957285,Ed,"Traci was very accommodating, welcoming, and hospitable. The apartment was perfect for a longer stay and we enjoyed the garden, walks around the neighborhood to the amazing lake front. (Bring your swim suit!). Traci, the neighbors, the street, and the neighborhood were all very quiet. Several great restaurants within a few minutes drive. "
2686659,18889090,2014-09-02,9105429,Lindsay,"This was a great space! The neighborhood was nice and quiet, and a short distance from the lake and public transportation. There was even a Little Library around the corner where I was able to trade out a fresh book for the flight home. Traci was a great host -- she checked in with us when we first arrived and made sure we were comfortable, and assured us she was just a text away for any questions we might have. The space works best with 2 people I think, since the bathroom door is a wooden shutter, which was perfect for (website hidden) Baker also seemed like a great home base for touring the rest of the city, so I'd highly recommend it if you like to come home after a long day and relax a bit. "
2686659,19041619,2014-09-05,3180285,Beth,"I was in Seattle for a conference downtown, and this apartment was perfect! It had all the conveniences I needed and, as always, it's nice to be able to do a little cooking on the road."
2686659,19227510,2014-09-08,12191263,Tony,"Staying at Traci's apartment was great! I was greeted (rather late) by Traci and her pooch, and both were as sweet as can be. Traci had a bottle of Prosecco ready, which we drank the next night in the comfortable living room (equipped with a chaise lounge and small TV alongside some quaint sport-themed antiques). Other niceties included the claw foot bathtub, the quiet neighborhood with ample parking, the standalone range, and bagels. 

Warning to the tall: I wouldn't have enjoyed this place as much if I weren't a couple (give or take a few) inches under 6 feet. If you're taller than that, you'll have a hard time standing up. "
2686659,19502969,2014-09-13,16386286,Danielle,"Traci was a very attentive host, and the apartment was adorably finished! You are slightly far from the main sights so maybe not ideal without a car (although I didn't check out public transport, so perhaps this isn't completely true), but it is in a quiet and charming neighbourhood with a lot to see on your doorstep as well :)"
2686659,19787186,2014-09-18,16149959,Dennis,"It was easy to communicate with Traci to arrange everything. I felt welcomed, and she explained everything I needed to know about the apartment, wifi connection, transportation to downtown, etc. The description of the apartment matched was she was offering. As someone already said: tall people, this isn't the place for you. 
The neighbourhood is nice and quiet. Again, someone said this in a previous comment: this place isn't as close to downtown as you would expect, but once you get use to the public transportation service, which is really good, you're set to go. 
Loved her dog too, and I couldn't avoid spending some time with her every time we met :)"
2686659,20321054,2014-09-27,6935675,Christine,We stayed for 2 days in Traci's apartment. It had al the ammenities we needed and the pictures gave an accurate impression of the interior. She had the apartment very nicely decorated. Our lack of height was in our favour because the ceilings were prettig low. It was located in a very nice neighbourhood and downtown was easily excessed using public transport. Traci had everything in order for our arrival and was a friendly host. 
2686659,20447046,2014-09-29,13061612,Maria,"This place was great to stay at for the day and a half I was in Seattle. Traci was super nice and helpful. The place is a short drive to downtown. The neighborhood is quiet and full of charm, and a short walk to Lake Washington which was beautiful. The ceilings are low so anyone over six feet may have a hard time standing up. "
2686659,20824640,2014-10-06,1880334,Anne,"Traci's apartment was a lovely oasis in a stunning Seattle neighborhood. One of my visiting yoga teachers stayed in her home to teach at the Mount Baker Community Clubhouse a few blocks away. It was easy for him to take Light Rail from the airport and into downtown for an evening out. He enjoyed walks in the nearby park, to the lake, and ventured out for Laotian food one night. Thanks Traci for a great homey place to stay. "
2686659,21268953,2014-10-13,22339602,Teresa,"Traci was very sweet. She called to make sure we arrived safely when we ended up getting there later than expected! The apartment was very clean and quaint. The ceiling was a little lower than average, as some other reviewers have written, but it wasn't a problem for us. We drove into town, but the light rail did look reasonably close. "
2686659,22570862,2014-11-09,876260,Dane,"I enjoyed my stay. It was clean, comfortable, and quiet. Traci was welcoming and helpful in pointing out the peculiarities of the basement apartment so I felt at home. "
2686659,23089074,2014-11-22,23919334,Justin,"What a perfect place for the 2 nights we stayed in Traci's suite! She is a great host and the suite is exactly as described by everyone so far. 
It is very comfortable overall, was delightfully more private and quiet than expected, and almost perfectly located for ease of travel to and from the city. She even set out a dog bed for our pooch, very cool. 
As for the height of those ceilings, we're taller folks and the only real issue is the hall space heading to the bathroom. Traci has that covered, literally, with padding and warning tape, just don't run through there too quickly and you'll be totally fine. 
One thing to keep in mind is the (fantastic) tub has only a hand - held shower, so don't get too crazy in there or you'll hose down your dry towels in a hurry. 
Honestly though, our intro to Airbnb couldn't have been any better."
2686659,25686694,2015-01-23,14081157,Jerry,I had the chance to stay at the apartment for 2 weeks while I was working in Seattle. It's in a nice quiet neighborhood next to Lake Washington. For me the location was perfect being close enough to Downtown without having to deal with staying in Downtown. Traci was not only hospitable to me but welcomed my dog with open arms. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
2686659,28758511,2015-03-29,18497243,Meg,"Traci was an excellent host! She was responsive and made every effort to make my trip easy and comfortable. 
I was in town for a sick friend so my hours of coming and going were erratic as I was at the hospital a lot. It was easy to come and go at all hours without causing a ruckus and parking was always available on the street out front. 
The apartment is a finished basement mother-in-law and as such does have low ceilings and little daylight. But I found it comfortable, quiet, and (above all) a safe and a welcome respite from a very stressful situation. The claw-footed bathtub was a perc! and the kitchen is very reasonably equipped for simple meals to avoid eating out all meals.  The bed was comfortable and the place was scrupulously clean. Traci has a lovely older dog, Ruby, who is curious about guests, well-behaved when out in the yard,  and very friendly. 
The Mt Baker neighborhood is a quiet, residential area and easily accessible to Downtown Seattle or Bellevue via car. Seattle's transportation system leaves a bit to be desired, so a car is recommended (unless you want to Uber a great deal).  
I would definitely come back and rent from Traci again should the circumstance (website hidden)- if you're a runner, Lake Washington Blvd is an awesome scenic run (within a mile or so of the house but hilly) and if you get down to Seward Park it's beautiful! "
2686659,29077163,2015-04-03,1021711,Erin,"We really liked the place, Traci and the neighborhood.  It was cozy, very quite, the kitchen was well equipped, the bed was comfortable and Traci was very very friendly and helpful...   "
2686659,29245617,2015-04-05,1839219,Derric,"The apartment is really cool, yes the ceilings are low but it really wasn't a big deal (and I'm 6'2). The neighborhood is quiet and there is plenty of parking, there's a great little pizza place just down the road. It's a quick access to anywhere in Seattle. We had a great stay, Traci is a fantastic host!"
2686659,32687405,2015-05-20,826256,Travis,"We had a lovely extended stay at Traci's house. Traci was very friendly and helpful and her dog Ruby was cute and gentle. The apartment was big enough to be comfortable for myself, my wife, my son and my dog. There is no shower, but there is a big (really big) bath tub, so you will have to take baths. We didn't mind this, but just something to note. The bed was comfortable and kitchen had enough pots and pans for cooking.

This apartment is in a beautiful neighborhood. Many parks near by, and close to the lake. A few stores and restaurants within walking distance. Downtown is quick drive away."
2686659,41738168,2015-08-09,31309109,Carlo,"The place is nice, traci's fast to accommodate are needs 5/5"
2686659,42168991,2015-08-11,30871153,Michelle,Great visit!  Traci was available for any questions we had and provided a lovely place for us to rest our heads for the two nights we were in town.
2686659,42537301,2015-08-14,3804329,Kirk,Great space to stay in with good transit links and interesting shops and eating not far away in Columbia City. Traci was polite and helpful and made the stay easy and stress free.
2686659,43375712,2015-08-19,22753208,Fern,"Lovely, quaint place, very cosy, with an extremely comfortable bed and fully equipped kitchen. Walking distance to transport into the city, local restaraunts and stores nearby, and the stunning lake Washington. Communication was a bit difficult prior to arrival, however this was resolved quickly. Highly recommend Traci's listing! "
2686659,44137939,2015-08-24,37513727,Tony,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment was great for the two of us during our short trip to Seattle. The neighborhood was nice for walking (the lake is a nice walk nearby as is the pizza place just around the corner), and plenty of street parking made having a car to get around the city easy. Columbia City is a short drive away for a neat neighborhood with lots of places to grab brunch or coffee. The place was just what we needed and Traci was a great host who was available to answer any questions."
2686659,44801462,2015-08-29,6313241,Ken,"Traci's communication was great, both before I arrived and after when she checked into make sure everything was going well. Street parking was easy, and the apartment was well-stocked with towels, dishes, and utensils. The creative decor made for a fun atmosphere. WiFi internet access was (website hidden) Baker is a great neighborhood and I enjoyed my stay at Traci's place. "
2686659,45384609,2015-09-02,38235393,Carolyn,"It was great coming to (email hidden) Baker (Traci's) apartment.  We immediately felt at home in the neighbourhood and the apartment itself.  After a long trip from Australia - it was perfect to get acclimatized, the bed was extremely comfortable.  Staying in Mt Baker was a good base with the convenience of the light rail and bus into town nearby - and a wander to local shops for coffee and dinner.  We really enjoyed our stay. Traci gave us some tips which helped us settle in and have a good stay.  Thank you Traci."
2686659,45701396,2015-09-05,20775502,Ericka,"We absolutely loved this place. It's such a thoughtful, charming little apartment, super cozy but without feeling confined. We brought our dog with us and she did great here - she's afraid of other dogs, but Traci was totally understanding and helped us keep Zoe comfortable. Our stay here couldn't have been better!"
2686659,46152915,2015-09-08,39337030,임주연,"It's a so nice (website hidden) takes 30 minutes to downtown by bus.Traci's apartment is so clean.We hadn't problem in Traci's house.If i will go to the Seattle again,i hope to stay this house."
2686659,48431242,2015-09-26,42494542,Jordan,Very nice location close to public transit and downtown. Had a great time using the apartment as a launching pad for exploring the city and its surroundings! Traci was a fabulous host.
2686659,48910063,2015-09-29,42642142,Mariann,"Traci's place was a comfy home-base for our Honeymoon Stay in Seattle. The neighborhood was charming and the restaurant she recommended was awesome, we ate there three times! The bed was very comfortable and it was great having cable too.  Yes, the ceilings are low in the hall, but my husband (who is 6'5) found it a reasonable trade off for a bath that he could actually fit in. Additionally, Traci was very accessible if we needed to get in touch with her, and she gave us a heads up when she would be working in the yard lest it disturb us. Bonus: Traci's dog, Ruby is adorable and very good natured! "
2686659,49376581,2015-10-03,2332446,Mikey,"Traci's home was everything we were looking for in Seattle. We were in a great neighborhood, close to public transit, which gave us a feel for living in Seattle. The place was as nice as described and we would definitely stay here again. The home was easy to find and Traci was helpful with suggestions upon our arrival. Thanks Traci!"
2686659,50196136,2015-10-10,40078648,Michael,"Traci was a great host! This was our first visit to Seattle and first experience with AIrBNB. She provided us with a lot of recs for local dining and entertainment. Her place is very eclectic, clean and the perfect size for two people sharing a space for a few days. We loved meeting her dog, Ruby, too! 

The space is just a hop from the light rail that runs the spine of the city. We were able to do most of our touring for the trip entirely via light rail and only had to rent a car to travel outside of Seattle. I'm a runner, so I really appreciated the nearby trails, parks and waterfront views. We'll definitely stay again!  "
2686659,50555422,2015-10-12,2823708,Chelsea,"We really enjoyed our stay at Traci's place. We received great instructions on how to get there from the highway, and a very warm welcome from Traci and of course, the very friendly Ruby. The apartment was in a fairly central location, close to some shops (though they close early), greenspace, and the Big City. The apartment was very clean, warm and cozy. Thank you Traci! "
2686659,50808983,2015-10-14,8559500,Joe,"Traci's place was fantastic, clean and comfortable. Also been able to bring my friends dog was brilliant. Great location hopefully we will stay with traci again next time we are in Seattle."

2686659,52882599,2015-11-02,1927452,Uli,We had a great time in Seattle and Traci is very a friendly person and nice  host. The apartment is exactly as shown on the pictures. Neighborhood is also very nice.
2686659,53360425,2015-11-08,20062786,Angela,"Although I didn't have the opportunity to interact with Traci very often, she was always quick to respond whenever I had a question, and her place was fantastic. Loved all the personal antique items, and the bathtub (and accompanying rubber duckie) was fantastic. Not to mention, parking was a breeze!"
6646894,36452489,2015-06-28,31991066,Meg,"We had a great time in Seattle for pride weekend! Her space was very artsy and modern! The rooftop patio was gorgeous and we took our breakfast up there one morning. The apartment was very nice, although I would say it was pretty cramped with 3 ppl and our luggage too...cooking with that many ppl and bags plus 3 cats was a bit tight. I'd suggest 2 in this space only. We were under the impression it had a bedroom but it's one open space. The patio off the unit was also asked not to be used and next time I'd prefer knowing that prior to purchase as the unit was a bit stuffy and hot and the side patio would have been nice.

There's a lounge area down the hall though and that had air conditioning too so was nice. And there's a gym so definitely a great space for the cost and location.

The location was amazing! Right in Capitol Hill and you could also walk to everything!

Taylor was very accomodating and a great host-showed us around the building and had little accessories in the home for us.

Her cats were very sweet. And her space was very clean! The building is also very safe!

Although the appt can sleep 4, it is cosy for 4 especially if all 4 persons have large luggage. Would definitely recommend for 2 visiting Seattle.

Thanks!"
6646894,39803162,2015-07-26,37000576,Michael,"Seattle is awesome! Taylor's apartment was perfect for our stay in Seattle. The view from the rooftop of the building is easy to access and has an awesome view of Seattle's skyline. The rooftop deck is nice even without the view. The apartment is walking distance to a bus stop which made is very easy to get around the city.  We enjoyed the cats. (I wouldn't stay here if you dislike cats but they do keep to themselves if you are not a cat person) The apartment was clean and nicely decorated. The bed is also extremely comfortable. Taylor was very easy to contact and responded timely to any of our questions. We would recommend staying here if you are passing through Seattle.

26116,101979,2010-09-21,201876,Justyna,"  Jamilah and her husband were excelent hosts, very hospitable, helpful and caring without any ounce of overzealousness. They made sure all little details were in place to make our stay comfortable.
  Their apartment is brand new, nicely decorated, very clean and homey. This flat is fully equiped (washing mashine, dishwasher, cooker, big fridge, TV, DVD and even board games) so you can not only relax but also prepare decent dinner or do the loundry. It is conveniently located in a quiet neighbourhood just a block away from Broadway full of shops and restaurants and within walking distance from downtown.
  We would happily stay in this apartment again and we would highly recommend it to anyone planing to stay in Seattle."
26116,165378,2011-01-04,21781,Carlos,Was an absolute joy to spend the holidays in Seattle...
26116,216531,2011-04-04,359079,Matt,"My overall experience with Jamiliah was fantastic. The apartment was great. It is very spacious dispite the lower ceiling that seperates the living room from the kitchen. I am 5'9"" and had no issues with it. Alot of thought seems to have been put into how the space was layed out and it is eveident when you move around and use the apartment. Appliances are newer and work great. I liked the washer/dryer combo unit. It has to do smaller loads at a time but again, it's just what the space needs. The location is truly perfect. 1 block from Broadway and several restaurants, coffee shops and a QFC grocery/home store. The 49 bus route picks up right on the corner and will get you to downtown or the market in just minutes.
All together, it was a wonderful experience and I have already suggested my other tour friends contact Jamilah."
26116,342936,2011-06-29,454487,Joe,"This was my favorite AirBnB experience yet. I booked this basement unit with a co-worker, and we both wanted our own private spaces. Jamilah's place is truly a 2-bedroom, with a comfortable bed in one room and a convertible bed in the second room (not as comfortable, I recommend the addition of an air mattress).  Jamilah has gone through great effort to make this space modernly hip, updated, and fully furnished with all of the necessities and more (utensils, extra bedding, extra towels, a washer).  The unit has it's own private entrance so it's truly an apartment on it's own.  The crowning gem of Jamilah's place is the location!  You'll fall in love with Capitol Hill if you haven't spent time there before, with other wonderful neighborhoods nearby.  Try ""Coastal Kitchen"", ""Glo's Coffee Shop"" (for breakfast),  ""The Broadway Grill"", and ""Julia's on Broadway"".  All of these places are less than 4 blocks away!  Or you can  conveniently walk 1 block to a wonderful QFC grocery which has everything you need and more to make your own food.  Enjoy running or  hiking?  Volunteer Park is about 4 blocks away and is wonderful to explore, enjoy the foliage, or visit the Asian Art Museum.  The neighborhood is very quiet and the neighbors are very friendly. I will dearly miss Seattle and staying at this location."
26116,402020,2011-07-28,582072,Sabine,"We enjoyed Jamilah's place very much. It couldn't have been better. It's very clean, neat and comfortable. Jamilah and her husband made us feel very welcome and they are very helpful and trustworthy.
If you are looking for a nice place centrally located and close to coffee shops and restaurants that's a good place. 
"
26116,445639,2011-08-15,652326,Angela,"We stayed here for a week and thoroughly enjoyed it! The space was very nice, clean, well put together and had all the amenities I could want in a home-away-from-home. I wasn't sure from the pictures if there were two bedrooms or one bedroom with a bed in a shared space, but there are indeed two separate bedrooms, a living room space, bathroom and kitchen. The ceiling is noticeably shorter than typical, however it did not detract from our experience at all. It is in an excellent location with a bus line only a block away. If you stay here you won't need a car - which is probably for the best as you will have a hard time finding parking anywhere in Seattle anyway! 

In summary: I highly recommend a stay here as you will enjoy the space, the location and the lovely owners!"
26116,478181,2011-08-27,699049,Dana,"We stayed at Jamilah's lovely apartment for 11 days following my hip resurfacing surgery at Swedish Orthopedic Institute. It was the perfect place for us....very quiet and restful, plenty of room to spread out, offered all the amenities one needs for an extended stay away from home, and close to shopping, cafes and restaurants. Jamilah and her husband are very gracious hosts. They even checked in to see if I needed anything following my surgery and sent a gorgeous flower arrangement.

The apartment is really very beautiful. It was like staying in the grand suite of a boutique hotel. Gorgeous design and thoughtful touches, including cozy throws to wrap around you in the cool evenings. plenty of condiments in the fridge, current magazines to read and nice big fluffy towels. We would definitely stay there again!

Our 3-year-old son loved playing in the fountain at nearby Cal Anderson park. My husband enjoyed being able to workout at the Gold's Gym a block away. And we all loved being able to grab an espresso or fresh smoothie just a half block away. And although I couldn't get out much, I could see all of the fun activities Seattle has to offer just an arm's length away. Maybe next time..."
26116,581398,2011-09-29,1158737,Jennifer,"The place was beautiful, clean and exceeded expectations. I would highly recommend the place. Situated in the heart of cap hill, the location was wonderful and extremely convenient to lots of points of interest and anything we needed. "
26116,622996,2011-10-12,19406,Jen,"My partner, baby, and I had a wonderful time staying in the vacation apartment of Jamilah and Muhammad's house.  The basement apartment is clean, well-designed, and well-equipped, with a very nice modern feel to it.  There are quirks, such as quite low ceilings, but none really detract from the experience. The apartment feels very private and is not noisy.
Jamilah is a perfect host, always accessible but never overbearing. We knew Seattle well and so did not require much guidance, but it was obvious she would be quite helpful if we did have questions. She was also there right away when something went wrong in the house and fixed it quickly. Since things do occasionally go wrong even in the most well-maintained of places, the best you can get is someone to fix it right away!
The neighborhood could not be better. Farmer's market, great restaurants, parks, bars, coffee shops, groceries, and shopping just blocks away, and we even walked to downtown in about 40 minutes without a problem. 
We hope to stay here again the next time we're in town!  "
26116,676184,2011-10-30,1285702,Erwin,"Für den Aufenthalt in einer fremdem Stadt hatte ich bis dato immer nur uniforme Hotels genutzt, die sich ja mehr oder weniger auf der ganzen Welt gleichen. 
Diesesmal wollte ich bewußt etwas anderes und etwas mehr Unabhängigkeit genießen und bin über airbnb auf das Appartement von Jamilah gestoßen. Ein gesamtes Stockwerk im Souterain eines liebevoll renovierten, für die Gegend typischen Holzhauses, vollständig neu und stilvoll eingerichtet mit allem, was man braucht, sauber, großzügig und angenehm. Ein separater Eingang, jede Menge Platz, mit Wohnzimmer, Küche mit Gasherd (an dem auch ein Profikoch seine Freude hätte), riesigen Kühlschrank, Waschmaschine (mit der auch ich zurechtgekommen bin;-) und Spülmaschine. Dazu noch eine kleines Badeszimmer mit einer praktischen Dusche, ein Schlafzimmer sowie ein weiterer Raum mit Schlafmöglichkeit. Wenn man will könnte man es auch als vierköpfige Familie aushalten. 
Für mich war wichtig, dass das Haus in einer ruhigen Gegend liegt, wo man über Nacht auch das Fester gekippt lassen kann. Dazu kommt das komfortable Bett mit einer festen Matratze und die ideale Einkaufsmöglichkeiten für die Selbstversorgung in unmittelbarer Umgebung (5 Minuten zu Fuß). An meinen freien Tagen (ich war anläßlich einer Geschäftsreise in Seattle) konnte ich morgens trotz der späten Zeit im Jahr (Ende Oktober) die Sonne im Wohnzimmer genießen. Der Standort Capitol Hill liegt erwas über der Downtown, die man mit dem Bus oder zu Fuß einfach erreichen kann. 
Äußerst sympatisch empfand ich während meines Aufenthalts die Gastgeber, die sich unkomplizierter Weise darum kümmerten, wenn es Fragen gab. Der freundlicherweise zur Verfügung gestellte WiFi Zugang hat mir dann ermöglicht, das eine oder andere Geschäftliche gleich vom Appartement aus zu erledigen und nach Hause zu skypen.
Alles in allem war ich sehr angetan und habe dadurch meine Zeit in Seattle genießen können.  "
26116,729958,2011-11-19,1368005,John,I had a very nice week's stay in Jamilah's apartment. It's a very comfy place that I found much preferable to a hotel. It's also just one street over from Broadway (good place to find dinner) and a pretty reasonable walk away from the convention center and other downtown locations.
26116,809438,2011-12-28,1012389,Kevin,"We stayed here for 7 days and had a great stay.  The location is excellent as you are less than 2 blocks from bus routes, restaurants, cafes and a major supermarket.

As we were visiting family that lived close by, we didn't use the kitchen but it would be great if you needed one.  The internet access worked well and was very convenient.  We didn't use the 2nd bedroom.

The apt was very clean, quiet  and comfortable.

A big thanks to Muhammad for getting up early in the am to allow us back into the apt after we left our passports in a drawer in the bedside table.

Overall a great apt in a great location where you can live and eat with the local people and get away from the touristy areas."
26116,932856,2012-02-20,1608733,Ken & Layna,"I stayed at this property with my wife for 7 days as an alternative to a hotel while on business. We were attracted to the vintage home as well as the location which is very central in Capitol Hill, a very eclectic and interesting old neighborhood with lots of restaurants and interesting stores within walking distance.

The place did not disappoint, everything in the home was exceptionally neat and clean, and we really appreciated some nice touches which gave us the feeling of being in a home away from home - there was coffee, tea, and other condiments ready in the pantry and Jamilah was kind enough on the first day even to provide me with a big bottle of sparkling water. Additionally the apartment looked great - it was tastefully appointed throughout (the pictures on the site are very accurate) - we found ourselves thinking it would be nice if our own home was setup so well. I was able to kick back and relax after a day at work... very much a home like experience.

The bed is very very comfortable - made of some sort of memory foam type material, I was able to fall asleep easily. Heating worked well - there is central heat and spot heaters you can use in the rooms once central heating goes off at night, so we were always warm. The second bedroom is very spacious, we enjoyed having the option of stretching out on the deep pile rug in that room. As the unit is the basement, the height of the ceiling is a little lower than normal, but we did not have any problems with it.

Jamilah and Mohammed were very friendly and had some nice suggestions about what to do in the neighborhood. They were also very kind to indulge my interest in vintage homes and gave a small tour which my wife and I appreciated very much.

"
26116,968511,2012-03-04,1665609,Abigail,"Our stay on 10th Ave. couldn't have been better for our family of four. The close proximity to Broadway's social scene, the thoughtful layout, appliances, and modern design made it a fun and convenient place to stay. Jamilah was attentive, yet unobtrusive. The parking pass was extremely helpful. We will recommend the flat to any folks who might visit the area. "
26116,1070908,2012-04-02,1564091,Belle,"Jamilahs place was a great place to stay - clean, comfy and perfectly located for our needs with easy access to buses. The two bedrooms were perfect for the 3 of us - one couple and a friend and having access to wifi,  electronic equipment comfy lounge and reasonably equipped kitchen made our stay easy. Jamilah and Mohammed were great, helpful and friendly hosts who immediately dealt with the slight leakage problem due to the inclement weather (very rainy and not under their control) and even recompensed us for the inconvenience with a bottle of wine (we were there at the end of March). We would stay there again!"
26116,1138179,2012-04-16,230816,Emilie,"The house and the place are just like in the pictures, very well kept, spotless, well equiped with all the kitchen accessories, linens and pillows you might need. Jamilah is friendly and accomodating, and will go out of her way to make sure that you stay is pleasant, and that the reputation of her vacation rental is untouched. "
26116,1240571,2012-05-07,2113854,Matt,"The apartment was ideal, clean, furnished with very comfortable beds, and all the essentials including a washing machine.

The location was perfect, less than a 30 second walk to 5-10 great restaurants, a 24 hour QVS supermarket, and 2 starbucks (although there is a great coffee machine in the apartment).

Jamilah was a great host, we hardly bumped in to each other but when we did she was extremely helpful and flexible with check out times as we had a red eye that night.

Loved it!"
26116,1273671,2012-05-13,373654,William,"The location of this place is amazing, right in the heart of Capitol Hill. It was a perfect base from which to explore town. Jamilah did a wonderful job making sure I got settled in and the place was clean, had plenty of amenities, and looked exactly as beautiful as the pictures showed. I was in town for a conference on the east side, and Jamilah offered me some extra bus tickets she had lying around, which was really sweet, even though I didn't end up using them (I just cabbed it). The were only a few minor issues, like the low ceilings (noted in the description, but I missed that). I really enjoyed my stay here and would definitely come back. Thanks Jamilah!"
26116,1539640,2012-06-23,1774340,Jean-Pierre,"Aménagement tout récent. Propre. Endroit vraiment tranquille. 
Cuisine bien équipée.
Transports publics et magasins à proximité immédiate.
Le seul inconvénient est constitué par la relative faible hauteur des chambres."
26116,1683325,2012-07-11,2439497,Susan,"Great location to hit all of Seattle's tourist spots.  Quiet, spacious two bedroom.  Our host stocked the kitchen well beyond our expectations!  Bed was very comfortable, shower was great.  Only drawback was the ceiling height, as my husband is six-three, but we adjusted in our ten day stay."
26116,1699555,2012-07-13,1279599,Jolene,Jamilah's lovely basement apartment is immaculate! It is as cozy and clean as the photos. Very conveniently located off Broadway and close to downtown areas. Great coffee shops just a few steps away. Peaceful and quiet at night. 
26116,1866587,2012-08-02,1770676,Amy,My family of four just had a magnificent 2 week stay in Jamilah's Captiol Hill apartment.  The location was perfect for walking around and seeing the sights.  Jamilah was a wonderful hostess who made sure that we had everything that we needed.  I would fully recommend this to anyone!
26116,1930546,2012-08-09,2321580,Deb,Jamilah's place was extremely clean and comfortable.  The location was perfect for our needs.
26116,2000763,2012-08-16,2661807,Jan,"      Jamilah's  apartment is lovely, bright, and spacious.  It was the perfect place for a reunion with two of my oldest and dearest friends.  It is  extremely comfortable  for early morning chats over coffee and convenient to all of Seattle's sights. The Broadway location provided for all needs and access to transportation if needed.  We (young seniors)  were able to walk everywhere.  "
26116,2558955,2012-10-09,241947,Ryan,"I got this place for my brother and good friend who were visiting for my wedding. The apt is brand new and stunning, it may be a basement but my friend who is 6'4"" loved it!

The location is amazing, just steps from everything on Cap Hill!"
26116,2925323,2012-11-20,1559016,Mikey,"We spent 6 weeks give or take in Capitol Hill and we were very happy with the accommodations.  The location was great for us, just a 25 minute walk to work.  Lots of restaurants and bars in the area as well as coffee shops (duh! check out roy street coffee just to the right on Broadway) and a grocery store within one block of the house.  The apartment is well lit and when the heat is on gets nice and toasty.  We also enjoyed having a mudroom since our shoes were wet from the rain a lot.  

There were a couple of things that we weren't ecstatic about but they were few and far between.  The walls are quite thin so you have to be careful about noise, and there is a leak issue, but we only had to deal with it once.  There is a lot of rain in seattle especially during the Oct. Nov. months when we were there so I don't blame Jamilah or her house.  

Note: This is a basement apartment - the ceilings are lower than we expected, but we're all short so it was fine.  

The space reminded us of an uber-shiek european hobbit hole! (in a good way)

We would definitely stay there again if we were working in the area.  Thanks Jamilah!"
26116,2980215,2012-11-27,1618109,Adam,"We spent four nights in Jamilah's place, and everything was great! It was very clean and bright. Also, within easy walking distance to lots of great restaurants/bars/etc, and all the touristy stuff downtown isn't far either. Yes, the ceilings are a bit low, but it didn't bother me (I'm 6'0""); however my brother (6'4"") had to duck a bit. All in all though we had a fantastic time, and would definitely stay again."
26116,3060596,2012-12-11,1112831,Marie-Hélène,"A colleague and I stayed for 5 nights at the apartment. It was wonderful to come back to a very comfortable and quiet place after long days of work and sightseeing. The place was exactly has described. It was nice to make coffee in the morning using the espresso machine, we didn't cook but there's certainly everything you need in the kitchen. The apartment is near transit and we've also walked a few times, to and from downtown Seattle (20 minute walk). Location is great, near some restaurants, pubs and shops. Jamilah was very flexible in accommodating our arrival and departure and she certainly made sure our stay was very pleasant. 
"
26116,3157041,2012-12-26,1272802,Mary,"Clean, comfortable, cozy - within walking distance of just about everything!"
26116,3220225,2013-01-02,4048149,Stephanie,"Jamilah could not have been a better host! And what you see in the pics ARE in fact what you get: beautifully appointed, cleaner than any hotel and all the amenities of home. The apartment is located in the best location: we walked everywhere! To the space needle, pike's place, all over cap hill and more! ATMs, grocery store are all within a block of the apartment: could not have been more convenient.

Jamilah is also incredibly available as a host, anything you need she's right there but also leaves you to your own devices. We had a slight hiccup with the water in the unit and she was there, on her knees making it right and making sure we were comfortable. Could not have asked for a better place to spend our holidays!

We'll be back Seattle!!"
26116,3795015,2013-03-16,4550317,Mohammed,"we spent two months at this beautiful 2 bedroom furnished apartment. let me start by talking about its location: the house is one block off Broadway (which is a major strip in the Seattle Capitol Hill neighborhood-near downtown). the location is superb because you are close to so many different restaurants (all cuisines, fancy to casual), one block away from QFC (big supermarket), there's a FedEX Kinkos nearby, the post office is a few blocks away, hospitals, pharmacies, etc... anything you can think of is within walking distance basically. that being said, taxis are easy to call, and plenty of bus routes on Broadway taking you whereevr you want to go. two parks nearby with kids playgrounds.
the only thing that beats the location were our amazing hosts! they were super accomodating, kept the place warm for us all the time during this cold winter. very generous and warm hosts, really clear and fair about everything.
the apartment is spacious enough for the long time we spent there. the rooms are big, the kitchen is completely stocked with everything. the washer/dryer is small but does the job. and there's a dishwasher.
nothing but good things to say about this place, it's a great place to stay in seattle for the greatest value you'll probably find in seattle!
thanks Jamilah for everything, my family and I loved it, thanks for making our experience a really pleasant one@"
26116,4450262,2013-05-06,5610448,Abby,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and I have a feeling it will be VERY hard to top! Jamilah started off our weekend vacation with a quick call and provided details for check-in. She was warm, inviting and oh-so-accommodating! Upon arrival, wow! The basement apartment is well-appointed, modern, and is SO clean! I was joined by a childhood friend and we found the 2 bedrooms perfect. But I can already imagine returning with my family of 4 and being just as comfortable! It really is a shame we didn't stay longer just to enjoy the apartment! Location wise is ideal! I grew up south of Seattle and didn't know much about Capital Hill, but it was fabulous! We had a car (and used Jamilah's street parking permit) but if you plan on staying in Seattle proper, it's really not necessary! We walked everywhere! I can't say enough wonderful things about this host and her space! It's perfect!"
26116,4936786,2013-06-03,703623,Chelsea,"Jamilah was such a great host. The check-in process couldn't get any easier and I was happy to find the most immaculate listing I had ever seen waiting for me. The location is great, with tons of shops and restaurants around the corner. She was incredibly responsive throughout my stay if I ever needed anything. I would love to come back and stay here if I find myself in Seattle again. Thanks for hosting us Jamilah! "
26116,5028821,2013-06-08,506673,Nathaniel,Jamilah's basement apt is very stylish and clean with all the amenities you need! The location is perfect right in hipsterish hip hip of the capitol hill area. I had the time of my life while staying there!! Will definitely stay there again next year!!!!
26116,5082909,2013-06-11,4635645,Bungane,"I was looking for a two bedroom unit close to downtown for a family trip to Seattle. Jamilah's unit is in a great location just off of Broadway with groceries and numerous restaurants within a short walking distance. Jamilah was responsive and great at accommodating our arrival needs. The unit is well equipped with all the necessarily appliances and housewares for comfortable stay. Definitely recommend the location for relaxing, quiet stays in downtown Seattle."
26116,5507097,2013-07-03,4998733,Alex,"This place was wonderful. A 2min walk away from convenience of broadway st in Capitol Hill where you can get everything, coffee, food, groceries, bus to downtown. Jamilah and Mohammed were great hosts and gave us great tips for exploring the area. It's also a 12 min walk to volunteer park and cal Anderson park if you have kids... We were here in the summer (88F or 30+C)  but the basement apt was still quite cool. 
Note: no off street parking but they provide a parking permit. I found street parking consistently 1 -2 streets away.
I highly recommend this place."
26116,5601970,2013-07-08,5168419,Preema,"Jamilah's place was perfect for our trip. While the apt has low ceilings, the furnishings and atmosphere more than made up for it. Jamilah was great and showed us around when we arrived. My only regret is that we didn't take advantage of the full kitchen.  In the heart of Capitol Hill, her house is just a 3 min walk to Broadway, where there are many great eating options. And the walk to downtown Seattle is not that bad either, especially because it's all downhill towards the water. I would definitely stay here again!"
26116,5712553,2013-07-13,3103641,Diana,"Jamilah's apartment was so perfect. It was well designed, spotless with EVERYTHING you needed. My family had a wonderful stay and the check-in and check-out couldn't have been easier! It's definitely worth asking Jamilah about the neighborhood parking pass - that made life simpler. And the location is walking distance to groceries, Starbucks, bars and restaurants. We're looking to relocation from New York to Seattle and very pleased to stay at Jamilah's lovely place. Thank you!!"
26116,6128725,2013-07-31,6639233,Sandra,"Cannot praise this place enough.  Warm welcome, excellent facilities, fantastic location, and everything you could ever need included in the cost.  We stayed for a week and would happily renew our acquaintance with this place on our next visit to Seattle.  Capitol Hill is a great location and the lodgings are so close to restaurants, shops, bars etc.  The hostess has really thought about the interiors with lots of excellent little touches to make your stay as comfortable as possible."
26116,6317856,2013-08-08,3643429,Linet,"We stayed at Jamilah's apartment for 7 nights and we felt sorry when we had to leave.  The apartment feels just like home, it is spotless and supplied with attention to details.  Morover, Jamilah is a wonderful host.  She was warm, welcoming, fun to talk to and prompt to accomodate any requests we had. We absolutely loved to stay at her place. I am definetly staying here again when back to Seattle. 
Thanks Jamilah!!!"
26116,6415553,2013-08-12,5553924,Elizabeth,"Jamilah's apartment was clean and extremely well located, and worked perfectly for our family of four.  She was so easy to work with, and offered to help us in any way possible.  We'd love to return!"
26116,6651980,2013-08-20,2795232,Brent,"Our stay in Seattle was great.  The apartment was wonderful.  The location was perfect being in the center of the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  It was one block off of the main commercial street yet on a quiet side street.  It was a pleasant walk to Volunteer Park, Seattle University, all the shops restaurants and coffee houses anyone could want.  If you don't mind the hill coming back up, its also a nice walk downtown to the Market, Space Needle, waterfront and other attractions.  

The Apartment itself was beautiful with modern European furnishings.   It had everything you could need for a comfortable stay.  

Jamilah was a terrific host and was easily accessible to answer questions if necessary.  

I hope to be back in Seattle again sometime soon and I would definitely stay at Jamilah's apartment again.  "
26116,6842550,2013-08-27,3484605,Bill,"What can I say.......everyone else has said it all!!.   Could not have been better.  Your reviews are fantastic Jamilah..  Thank you so much for letting us stay in one of the best accommodations that we have experienced.  Bill and James
"
26116,6911324,2013-08-30,785879,Theresa,"I would highly recommend Jamilha's beautiful apartment. It is decorated to a very high standard and she has thought of everything for the comfort of her guests. The location is very good with a 24 hour supermarket near by.
If I was asked to give this apartment a rating, I would give it a 10 out of 10."
26116,7224040,2013-09-11,5198741,Robert,"We had a great time exploring Seattle from Muhammed and Jamilah's pad in Capitol Hill. The location is fantastic and the apartment is as advertised.
I did not get to meet Jamilah but she introduced herself to other members of our party and made the effort to check that we had everything that we needed regularly. Also, she was very accommodating when we requested an early check-in.
Thanks very much Muhammed & Jamilah - I would wholeheartedly recommend your place to future visitors! "
26116,8825928,2013-11-19,644409,Josh,"Staying here was awesome.  Jamilah was wonderful and made the stay very comfortable. 

Great location and walking distance to a bunch of fun places.   

The washer was a nice to have, but the dryer takes a long time, so keep that in mind.  

If I'm up in Seattle again, I'll definitely consider staying here again."
26116,10221059,2014-02-07,2629380,Ted,"Very nice place in the best neighborhood in Seattle.  Everything was professional, clean and very well kept.  My only issue is that the ceilings are very low.  While this did not affect me, it affected my coworker who is over six feet tall.

Other than that, a great place at a great price."
26116,10665056,2014-03-02,11153990,Michelle,"I came to Seattle with two co-workers for a writing conference and stayed here. The apartment was clean, filled with simple and modern decor. Jamilah thought of everything! She provided clean fresh towels, coffee, an Ipod doc, and an expresso maker. We were close to downtown and within walking distance to a grocery store. It was a lovely quiet place to stay. It was our refuge from the bustle of the conference. We all agreed we would stay here again! "
26116,10755223,2014-03-05,572977,Annette,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
26116,12253759,2014-04-27,14101865,Benjamin,"We came to Seattle for a work trip; and found this amazing rental. Jamilah was very accommodating, and extremely easy to work with. I would request to stay here every time I am in the area. "
26116,13120659,2014-05-19,15241041,Tyler,Great place and even better location!  Jamilah was a very accommodating host. 
26116,13224392,2014-05-22,1405261,Beth,"Jamilah clearly understands travelers - everything we needed (and more) was there at the house. And you couldn't ask for a better location. We were there on business, but didn't want to stay in a hotel - we had SUPER FAST wi-fi at the house, and great coffee shops, bars and restaurants to break up the day. Thank you Jamilah and Mohammad for making Seattle feel like home."
26116,13419729,2014-05-27,11497781,Aaron,"Jamilah was a fantastic host being more than accommodating during our stay. The accommodation was very clean, had all the essentials, great location and was very comfortable. I would highly recommend staying here!"
26116,13767077,2014-06-03,293971,Allison,"Jamilah's place as great... amazing location, clean, modern, comfy... can't even sing high enough praises about it. And, Jamilah was an excellent host, very clear and prompt communication and so sweet (they even delivered a bottle of wine to the door because I was here over my birthday). Thank you, thank you, thank you!"
26116,13992856,2014-06-09,3693304,Amanda,"Jamilah's apartment is perfectly cozy, clean and comfortable. We loved our stay and she and her husband  were wonderfully accommodating hosts. We didn't need the kitchen much but it's perfectly outfitted for cooking if you so desire, and there are lots of thoughtful touches to make things comfortable in the flat. "
26116,14202339,2014-06-14,16046417,Marc,"Jamilah's apartment was lovely and very conveniently located!  It was clean, pre-loaded with everything we could have needed from soap to tea, and very very comfortable.  Jamilah was very nice throughout the entire process, even when there was a mix-up with a visiting guest, and helped to make our stay in Seattle extremely pleasant."
26116,14349019,2014-06-17,13095401,Katie,"Jamilah was a fantastic host. She is quick to respond and very helpful. The place was spotless, comfortable, quiet, and in the best location! We walked all around Capital Hill, and to Pikes Place Market and Volunteer Park. As a note, my dad happens to be 6'4"" and the ceilings were too low for him to stand up. This did not hinder our enjoyment but he did have to watch his head. "
26116,14537465,2014-06-21,16223129,Stacie,"This was my very 1st stay at an Airbnb property so I was a little hesitant at first. Would the place be clean? Would I have a sufficient level of privacy a hotel room offers? Well, Jamilah and Muhammed's cute 2BR apartment met all of my expectations. It was immaculate, spacious and cozy. It was even better than a hotel as I had a fully equipped kitchen including a fridge, microwave, dishwasher etc. Also if you plan on doing any touring, this place is a short, inexpensive cab ride to the Space Needle & several museums. It was nice to stay in the Capitol Hill area as it offers a different perspective of Seattle than a place downtown would. Jamilah is thorough and thinks of lots of details like providing soap, towels, and fresh fruit upon your arrival as well as a printed list of tips to get you acquainted with the place. She also checks-in with you and is accessible should you need anything during your stay. If other Airbnb places are like this one I would gladly use the service again."
26116,14607605,2014-06-23,372271,Barbara,We had a great time at Jamilah's apartment.  It was very well appointed and cozy!  We really enjoyed the neighborhood- Jamilah also helped up find a great brunch spot up on 15th.  I highly recommend this rental!
26116,14804134,2014-06-26,6438130,Taige,"Great space in a great area. Clean, comfortable and stylish. The owner is extremely responsive and accommodating; the perfect stay. "
26116,15396721,2014-07-08,14729350,Akiko,"The apartment was great for what we were looking for, which was a place for two couples to stay for a long weekend.  Jamilah was wonderful from the very first communication to the last moment where we checked out and she was very helpful with the rental as well as the neighborhood.  The apartment had all the amenities that we needed and then some and everything was in great condition.  I highly recommend the apartment and would come back the next time we are in the neighborhood."
26116,15555794,2014-07-11,6258852,Jennie,"We stayed at Jamilah's for a two-day business trip.  The apartment was spotless, and we were thrilled with the central location.  "
26116,15873993,2014-07-17,16352610,Jon,"Unbelievably gracious and thoughtful host. Great place. Great location. Clean and comfortable apartment.
I highly recommend. Quiet as well"
26116,16202826,2014-07-23,1626817,Maximiliano,"We had a great time at Jamilah's apartment. We visited Seattle exclusively for a 4-day all-day event at the KeyArena and we were completely exhausted every night, but it was really comforting to go back to the apartment and feel as it was home. It is a really cozy place, beautifully decorated and would certainly make any stay in Seattle better overall. With multiple shops and restaurants at a walking distance, you can't go wrong. Jamilah is really kind and was always at hand to make sure we had everything we needed. If we ever need to come back to Seattle, this would certainly be my first option."
26116,16399032,2014-07-27,6494085,Kanishka,"We just spent 3 nights at Jamilah & Muhammad’s beautifully designed, thoughtfully appointed, very comfortable apartment for 4 and had a lovely time. The house is on a quiet, lush, tree-lined street that’s also a block away from dozens of shops, restaurants and a very good grocery store (open 24 hours). Capitol Hill in general, was a great place to spend a few days in Seattle: very central location; abundant good food and excellent coffee (of course). We had a car and parking in the neighborhood was fairly easy: no more or less difficult than most cities. (a word of caution though, to those who even think about double parking or pulling up to the driveway to drop off your luggage, even if for a moment: you will be reprimanded! Immediately and severely).

Take that last comment with a grain of salt however, because the place truly is great and all the little touches in evidence throughout the house - beer in the fridge, a stocked kitchen, Q-tips in the medicine cabinet - made it that extra bit special. Jamilah & Muhammad are very thorough hosts (always available, always helpful) and it was a pleasure to be guests in their apartment."
26116,16612058,2014-07-30,16195719,Genevieve,"My husband and I loved staying in Jamilah's and Muhammad's lovely place in Capital Hill. Our airbnb was not only stylish and roomy but also comfortable and filled with great amenities (condiments and baindaids may not seem exciting until you find yourself traveling without them). To boot, it's within easy walking distance the cool shops and restaurants of Capitol Hill and only a few miles from downtown.

Parking is a bit of a pain, as it always is in cool neighborhoods in major cities. But Jamilah and Muhammad made it much easier. For an refundable $80 deposit, they will give you a pass that allows you to park in most spots in Capitol Hill. In the three days we were there, we found spots right in front of the house every day but one. 

We only had one small problem during our stay. The ceilings are 6'4"", a bit small for my 6'3"" husband. It states this in the ad very clearly, but it's something my 5'4"" self would miss. So, if you are tall, it might be a tough fit. But even my giant of a husband got used to it very quickly. 

If you're looking for a nice place to stay in Seattle with a great location and friendly, thoughtful hosts, and aren't in the NBA, you can't go wrong with this place. Highly recommended! "
26116,16719934,2014-08-01,16758816,Danielle & Glenn,"Jamilah’s apartment is well appointed and in a great location. The apartment was quiet, yet just a short walk to anything you could possibly want.  Jamilah was friendly and helpful throughout, her five star rating is well deserved."
26116,17268432,2014-08-10,624825,Susan,"Appreciate Jamilah, the place was immaculate, great beds and sheets.
Liked neighborhood, everyone friendly, close to great restraurants. "
26116,17837961,2014-08-18,17124745,Candace,"We really enjoyed our experience with this property.  Jamilah communicated so effectively and efficiently which was much appreciated.  The location was great, although next time if we can, we'll do without a car as finding a parking space was tough!  The property is so well done and in such a great location, I'm so glad we stayed here!"
26116,18058629,2014-08-21,13548510,Brian,"This place was fantastic, it is exactly what you see in the picture, modern and clean. The space was roomy and would be a perfect place to stay for a longer period of time. Jamilah (the host) was great, she obviously took great pride in this place and paid great attention to the details. The place was perfectly situated in the middle of the city, one block away from Broadway and a short $7 Uber ride to downtown. I really enjoyed staying here and will be back. "
26116,18267602,2014-08-24,9894055,Anna,"This is by far the BEST airbnb unit I have ever experienced. It has everything you need; prime secured location, extremely clean environment, fresh linens/towels, comfortable furniture and beds, awesome décor, great host....it just doesn't get better than this! Jamilah's attention to detail was evident in ever nook and cranny of this home. We immediately felt relaxed upon entering the door and actually looked forward to coming ""home"" from exploring the great city of Seattle. Will absolutely seek out this unit again when returning to the unique Capitol Hill area! Thank you Jamilah for creating such an awesome space for us! "
26116,18402478,2014-08-26,11369239,Jeff,"Jamilah is a kind, considerate, thoughtful host that went out of her way to ensure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable! The apartment was immaculate and fully furnished, beds were comfortable, and the location is as good as it gets. It's in the heart of Capitol Hill, what more could I ask for! I would love to stay here again during my next visit to Seattle. Thanks for everything!"
26116,18980997,2014-09-04,12693514,Emma,An amazing apartment in a fantastic location and a brilliant host! Jamilah and Mohammed were so helpful  but not intrusive.  We would definately recommend this apartment - absolutely brilliant!!
26116,19437676,2014-09-12,20859181,Mary Anne,"This is a lovely downstairs apt. in a great location - just a block's walk away from Broadway. I stayed here on a business trip, when all my usual hotel options were booked up. I took a chance on this apt. and I'm so glad I did. The location was perfect for my needs with everything is right there. The apartment was very comfortable and well stocked - and Jamilah was super friendly and stayed on top of everything. Do be aware that it's in the lower level, so the ceiling is a bit low in spots, but it wasn't an issue for me. I was very comfortable and really enjoyed my stay. If you're looking for a quiet spot in this part of town, this is a great option. "
26116,23845202,2014-12-12,739871,Wes,"I had a great time staying at Jamilah's. She was very helpful, attentive, and an all around wonderful host. The apartment was very well furnished with everything you would need for a longer stay. It's located on a quiet street just a block away from great coffee and restaurants. I wouldn't stay anywhere else in Seattle "
26116,24473501,2014-12-29,23396816,Lisa,"Jamilah is a fantastic host!  She is so warm and friendly, and we felt very welcome.  The apartment is very comfortable and immaculately kept.  It has excellent proximity to shops and restaurants in Seattle's popular Capitol Hill neighbourhood, and it is close to downtown.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.  Strongly recommended."
26116,25690867,2015-01-23,25754892,Natalie,Jamilah was an excellent host throughout the stay! 
26116,27006848,2015-02-23,1531079,Nancy,"Hosts were wonderful. They left messages with all information, stopped by to introduce themselves and say hello, responded immediately to any request (e.g. for a cutting board in the kitchen). They were present, but not intrusive in any way."
26116,27532727,2015-03-07,25857006,Sara,"Wonderful location, right in the heart of Capitol Hill. I pretty much walked everywhere my entire stay. The hosts were extremely welcoming and flexible. We really enjoyed the space, save for a few oddities like a fairly low ceiling. We would definitely stay here again if we return to Seattle! "
26116,28698041,2015-03-29,25101511,Lindsey,"My group came to Seattle for a short getaway, but we still wanted to be comfortable. This space felt like a hotel with it's great modern decor and styling, but was still cozy. It was very clean, the beds were comfortable. Jamilah responded quickly from the first contact, and checked in on us to see if we needed anything and to make sure our stay was going well. I really appreciated her care, and could definitely see it in her attention to detail, from her design touches, thorough how-to's and explanations of the quirks of the place, making sure there was more than enough bedding and towels to go around, and thoughtfulness in terms of the amenities that were provided.  The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood, but is in Capitol Hill with lots of great restaurants around, and is very conveniently located and walkable.  The only caveats I have are that being a basement apartment, the ceilings are a little lower so the very tall might have an issue. Also if you have a car I would definitely spring for the parking permit, as parking is very difficult in the area.  My friends and I were very impressed with the place and would definitely stay again."
26116,29167230,2015-04-05,1336377,Janet,"Jamilah was a great host! She's friendly, responsive and very accommodating. We had a late flight and Jamilah allowed us to stay until our flight left because there was no one scheduled to check in the next day. She gave us plenty of restaurant suggestions. The apartment is located in Capital Hill which is such a convenient and central place to stay when in Seattle! Highly recommend this apartment and this neighborhood. The apartment is extremely clean. There was tea which we enjoyed every morning. Towels, bedding, bed and living space was super cozy and comfortable. Overall, a fantastic experience! "
26116,29820166,2015-04-13,478427,Scott,"The hosts were very nice, the apartment was spotless, well-located and well-stocked.  My only complaint is that the floors were ice cold and the ceilings are very, very low.  No sun salutations this past week! "
26116,30400308,2015-04-21,6582377,Andrea,"We truly enjoyed our experience staying in this apartment.  Jamilah went above and beyond to make sure we have everything we needed, even though she was on vacation and not at home.  The apartment was exactly as pictured and described.  Although the ceilings were low, we didn't have any trouble (after one head bonk, my 6'3"" husband learned to watch the light!).  We didn't use the kitchen but the bed was super comfortable.  We would definitely stay there again -- thanks Jamilah!"
26116,33097448,2015-05-25,30227378,Gian Diego,"The place and the neighborhood are fantastic with everything one needs in a few minutes walk. The apartment is very nice, clean and exactly as described. Jamilah and her husband were very nice and made sure we had everything we need. She even spoke in German to us as soon as she realized we were coming from Germany."
26116,33905660,2015-06-02,753818,Wesley,"This is the most beautiful spot on an incredible street right in the heart of Capitol Hill! The apartment is kept immaculately clean, and looks exactly like the pictures. My parents and brother stayed here on their first visit to Seattle and absolutely loved it! Walking distance to everything in Cap Hill, with an amazing grocery store just one block away. Jamilah is so gracious, and made sure we had everything we needed. Highly recommend this spot, you won't regret it."
26116,34629609,2015-06-10,30379454,Peter,"Jamilah made us feel very welcome. The apartment was great, very well equipped and comfy beds. There was plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby and it was a quick and easy 20min walk into town. We would certainly recommend staying."
26116,34818815,2015-06-12,952212,Moriah,"I loved staying here! Jamiliah was a kind, wonderful, and very organized host. Their apartment is perfect for someone looking for a clean, extremely well located and serene home. I really loved it!"
26116,35082161,2015-06-15,4743392,Suzanne,Perfect location ! Very clean and organized . Comfy beds . Well equipped kitchen. The low ceilings were the only thing to get used to as mentioned in prior comments. Also. It's very difficult to find street parking and to navigate traffic. Next time we visit we will definitely NOT rent a car and will just rely on public transportation . 
26116,35365644,2015-06-18,27248409,Paula,"Jamilah was very welcoming. She gave excellent instructions on how to locate the residence. The apartment was lovely and clean. A parking permit had been arranged for us. There were lots of helpful leaflets including maps and tourist guides. The beds were very comfortable. The shower was wonderful, although not made for tall people! The kitchen was well stocked. It was great to have access to a clothes washing machine. "
26116,35659986,2015-06-21,31797385,Joseph,Highly recommend this rental and location.  It is right in the middle of the Capitol Hill neighborhood and is very walkable to everything you would need.  Jamilah was a fantastic host and the place was in great shape.  Perfect place to stay for a 1-3 nights if you plan on being out and about in Seattle.
26116,36527207,2015-06-29,31675529,Diane,"This was our first experience of Air BnB and it was fabulous
We were treated as friends visiting for a long weekend
The accommodation was spotless and had everything we needed.
Our hosts were very welcoming , we were also able to check out a little later
All in all a great experience
Thank you"
26116,37148652,2015-07-05,5046203,Matan,"Just like the pictures - the unit has a lot of style and taste! My wife and I were visiting with my parents, and the four of us just loved the place. The beds are so super-comfortable, the kitchen is very spacy and convinient, and the bathroom was very clean.
Jamilah and her husband were great hosts - very friendly and helpful; the location was simply amazing - steps away from the busy Broadway with lots of shops and restaurants, but in a very quiet and peaceful street.

We did have one incidient with trying to use the washing machine during out last night, but it got ""stuck"". I guess this things happen from time to time, we just had bad luck.

Anyways - if you're visiting Seattle, I wouldn't think twice before booking with Jamilah and her husband!"
26116,37735943,2015-07-10,22120573,Dawn,"Jamilah was a gracious host. So helpful. The apartment was impeccably decorated and furnished.  

The location was great. The Capitol Hill area is young and vibrant. I hadn't been to this area before. Plenty of restaurants/pubs within very short walking distance, as well as grocery and drugstore. 

We took short can rides to the market, EMP, and the ball park. Really convenient. 

We were here during a pretty warm summer. The apartment is not air conditioned (not much in Seattle is) but because it is a basement apartment, the temperature was comfortable.  There are plenty of windows in the apartment for lots of light and breeze. 

Definitely a great place to stay. "
26116,38390958,2015-07-15,26951677,Hiroki,"Jamilah was absolutely incredible.  She was very nice leading up to our stay as well as during and at check out.  Expectations were set very well for what to do with the space, and I would stay with one of her properties again in a heartbeat."
26116,38617156,2015-07-17,19121537,Katie,"The place is immaculate, pretty, comfortable and in a neat neighborhood. The host helped us by letting us drop off our bags before check-in. "
26116,39051665,2015-07-20,917100,Edwin,Location is great. Very close to a variety of good restaurants and bars. Happy with the opportunity to stay here 
26116,39372975,2015-07-23,30321788,Malcolm,The accommodation was not only exactly as described but even better. Our host made us feel most welcome and bent over backwards to assist us at every turn. The area was very central and we were able to walk downtown and back without any problem. Exceptionally clean and tidy. We felt very comfortable and secure.
26116,40080483,2015-07-28,7546907,Julie,"Jamilah was a perfect host. She was always quick to respond to questions. Most accommodating and helpful. The apartment is absolutely spotless and has everything we needed and more. I loved the comfy mattress! Excellent internet access. Parking on the street is available.  I found the neighborhood to be quiet during our time there, yet a minute's walk to all that Capitol Hill has to offer. I would not hesitate to stay again. Thank you for everything Jamilah!"
26116,40892496,2015-08-03,12882895,Stephanie,"We arrived to a beautiful clean apartment just as pictured. The rooms were spacious sheets could have been a little softer but the memory foam mattress was a plus. We used the kitchen for breakfast and one dinner and it was perfect. The market is only one block away. The washer and dryer didn't work which was unfortunate because I did plan on using it, Jamilah offered to do laundry for us but I just hand washed.We walked to pike place from the apartment it was almost a 25 min walk but not too bad. The first night we went for dinner and drinks to a place called witness it was delicious. We also went to a ginger beer place in Capitol Hill called RGB - fantastic! We didn't spend much time in the actual apartment. After a long day of hiking we came back pretty early around 8pm and Jamilah had friends over which she told me about but it was kind of loud you could hear the footsteps throughout the apartment. For the most part it was quiet but again we didn't stay at the apartment much. The only issue we had was getting our deposit back from the parking pass and Jamilah wasn't getting back to me the morning we were leaving. The moment we left the apartment she called me back and accused us of smoking in the apartment which never happened. I told her that we hadn't but she kept saying she would be charging a fine if she found out we had and keep my $80 parking deposit. She returned the money through the bank later that day. Unfortunately she probably didn't think we were great guests I left the place tidy and put all the dirty towels in the basket and even took out the trash (we left a carry-on inside because it didn't fit in the trash bin and she was extremely upset about it) Jamilah does have a lot of rules and we did follow them. Overall my group and I had a great time in Seattle but we won't be staying at Jamilah's apartment again. "
26116,42511989,2015-08-14,29382354,Nadine,"Djamila was a perfect host, 
she met all our needs. The apartment is quiet, clean, functional and also well located near downtown. We recommend this house."
26116,44110105,2015-08-24,893751,Taylor,Our stay at Jamilah's place was wonderful! Its in a great location and the house has everything you need. She communicated promptly and was so helpful. The place is so cute. You can tell she put a lot of thought into how it is decorated and set up. One of the people in our group is still talking about how comfy the beds are! He wants to know where the mattresses are from! We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend her place! Thank you Jamilah! 
26116,45060224,2015-08-31,28893726,Aren,Jimilah was a great host and made things very easy for us.  She was quick to respond when we had questions or concerns.  Her place is very nice and comfy.  She provided everything we needed and made our stay very pleasant.  Also her location has a lot of food restaurants near by so that made getting dinner or breakfast very easy and convenient. 
26116,45930734,2015-09-07,15404051,Prokopi,"The property was clean and bright and situated in a pleasant, diverse neighbourhood."
26116,46779238,2015-09-13,8915710,Neil,"Jamilah personally welcomed our group when we arrived.  The accommodations were perfect for our group of two couples: great location in Capitol Hill, walking access to bars, restaurants, and QFC (grocery store), and because it was one block off the beaten path, it made for quiet and peaceful nights that were perfect for recharging.  

Jamilah checked in several times via text to ensure the group had everything we needed.  She even delivered a fan when requested to help move some air around the unit and provide some white noise.  The unit was well appointed with nearly everything you'd need in your home away from home.  

*One detail to consider: since this is a lower unit, the ceilings are much lower than you'd expect.  I'm 5'10'' and my friend is 6'2'', and we had to be mindful of some areas so as not to hit my head.  Definitely not a deal breaker, just something to consider.*  

If you're looking for a place in Capitol Hill, don't hesitate to reach out to Jamilah for a great stay.  Her fantastic place will make you feel like you live in Seattle. "
26116,47076341,2015-09-15,27019201,Zach,Great neighborhood.  Place looked exactly like the pictures.  Very clean and comfortable.  Jamilah even went out of her way to provide a fan for one of the bedrooms.  Would definitely recommend.
26116,47446707,2015-09-18,2853207,Todd,"Great host, great location, and really nicely updated.

The main hiccup is that I'm 6'3'' and I found myself either nearly hitting my head (it is a refurbished basement) or ducking under the air vent.  

Great location if you're under 6'....however, it was a bummer to be slouching during my stay. "
26116,54035370,2015-11-15,11102310,Dawm Dee,"Jamilah's home was wonderful!  Perfect location for Seattle...Home is exactly like the pictures.... would definitely stay again... Highly recommend!!

Thanks Jamilah
Dawn Dee"
26116,54970996,2015-11-27,463922,Lisa,"We arrived in Seattle after a tiring trip from Australia to be welcomed by Jamilah into the apartment which had the central heating running so we felt snug straight away!  A delightful surprise.  Everything about the apartment was exactly as described, it even felt better once we had settled in. Jamilah has thought of every little detail right down to beautiful bathroom products, lovely bed linen etc. The kitchen was really well set up with more than you could possibly need.  Yes, the apartment does have low ceilings but I found that comforting in the cooler weather and it didn't bother my husband who is tall at all.  It kind of goes with the idea of being a basement style apartment. I would rate this apartment as one of the cleanest I have ever stayed in, it was spotless. The location was perfect with only a five minute drive downtown.  We didn't find parking a hassle.  Highly recommend Jamilah and her home.  Every time I needed to communicate with her the answers were prompt and informative, top marks for this.  Plus she is the nicest lady ever.  Hopefully we can return and stay again sometime, I would not bother looking anywhere else. Thanks Jamilah!"
26116,55195536,2015-11-29,11604768,Eric And Sarah,We enjoyed our stay!  Perfect location on Cap Hill.  The cleanest AirBnb we have ever stayed in. Caution to those over 6' tall: the ceilings are low.  Beds are comfortable and all around comfortable home. 
26116,57455629,2015-12-26,42030214,Katt,"Probably one of my best experiences with Airbnb to date! Jamilah was very gracious, considering that I am in San Francisco and my visitors were in Seattle, she took care of every last detail.  Excellent communication, cannot wait to work with her again soon!"
3403638,16863993,2014-08-03,18422097,Alexis,The Lake Union Mansion is located in a very charming neighborhood on walking distance from the University of Washington. The Hackers team is very nice and I had a pleasant stay there!
3403638,16942099,2014-08-04,12179590,Kita,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3403638,20142129,2014-09-24,2837854,Chris,"The Lake Union Hacker House Mansion Place Thing is a big dream that was not yet fully realized when I stayed there. I greatly enjoyed my time in Seattle, and I met some lovely people at the house, but it is not (yet) the hacker heaven advertised.

It's a great house with lots of space to work and hangout. The listing mostly does the basics justice, although the tiny kitchens and ancient washer/dryer were a let down.

Where the promise falls apart is in delivering a community. If you're a gregarious person, you'll have no issue making friends at the house, but the house itself puts very little effort into forging a community out of the individuals present. There is one event held every two weeks, and while a fun night, is not enough. I was only able to attend one event in my 24 day stay.

The house has only been open a few months. My hope is they crack the community building egg over time and deliver on their dream, but it was not there as of my stay."
3403638,21402005,2014-10-16,9909943,Ali,"Everything was very smooth especially checking in. Although there are other guests in the building, it was reasonably quit. The neighborhood in nice and quit as well and for my accommodation, I could find my bus to the downtown by about 10 min walk. "
3403638,43807215,2015-08-22,38570931,Jason,"I loved my stay at cor36! The house was exactly as advertised: dorm-style bunks, great people, and a scenic location right on Lake Union.

Lily and Paul were the two house staff while I was there. They were both around frequently and were always willing to answer questions or just chat.

Biking from the house was also really convenient. The Burke-Gilman trail is right across the street.

I would absolutely stay here again!"
3403638,49011874,2015-09-30,5898184,Melissa,"Between the house tour and the other guests at the house, I felt very welcome. The location of this place is pretty good. 15-20 min walk to three distinct neighborhoods and right on the bike trail as well.

I'd recommend asking about the renovation status and plans before booking. Most folks left for the day but I work from home. The noise and disruption from the renovation project made that impossible. Fortunately, the team was very accommodating and moved me to the Capitol Hill location with no problem.

I really enjoyed getting to know the other folks in the house. If you're trying to network and learn about interesting projects happening in Seattle, the people will make up for the minor inconveniences of the house."
7331079,42721472,2015-08-15,7648229,Vivien,"非常舒适的房子。社区安静安全，离绿湖很近。周边餐馆有不错的日餐和泰餐馆。距离大学城购物区很近。房子内部设施稍微有点老，但是足够使用。还有适合孩子玩的蹦床。
A wonderful house for family especially with kids. The district is quite and safe. Green lake is within walk distance. I will stay there again when I visit Seattle next time."
4678866,24440669,2014-12-28,9112383,Jessica,"This is a super cute home!  It's really tiny (I wouldn't stay there with more than 2 ppl) but very clean, cozy and sweetly decorated.  We appreciated the guest parking pass for street parking.   Our car was broken into but not damaged - just a good reminder that all neighborhoods have a level of risk.  I really appreciated the home security system and felt very safe in the apartment.  It's a super nice, quiet neighborhood with beautiful homes and a gorgeous lake view.  Sarah was very conscientious and communicative.  Would love to stay here again!"
4678866,37263409,2015-07-05,37047361,Courtney,"This place was awesome!!  It is quiet, cozy and perfectly close to all that you need.  Sarah and Luke were so sweet.   They house was very clean and Sarah and Luke even left a stuff in the fridge for us.   "
3543791,44974162,2015-08-30,1275305,Dave,"Clare's apartment was everything that I wanted during my trip - cozy, close to Downtown and the restaurants in Capitol Hill, and the view was fantastic!  I appreciated the clear instructions on how to make my way around the apartment and I would definitely suggest this place for anyone looking for a perfect place that is close to everything."
3543791,45829026,2015-09-06,41114380,Eric,My wife and I loved how cozy and peaceful the place was. The views was just perfect. Clare was really helpful with recommendations.
3543791,47068636,2015-09-15,40976902,Michael,"This is a nice studio apartment with a great location on Capital Hill in Seattle.  It was clean and decorated in good taste.  It is a short walk from the apartment to many restaurants and bars on the hill and a 15 or 20 minute walk to downtown. Clare was very welcoming with a detailed email of info about the condo.  It was very comfortable and I will stay there again. The view from the front windows is spectacular of Puget Sound, the Olympic mountains and the Olympic Peninsula."
3543791,48602035,2015-09-27,30926462,Rebecca,The apartment was everything Claire said it would be. There are great restaurants and bars near by and downtown is a 20 minute walk. Perfect for two people. We would certainly stay here again. 
3543791,57874993,2015-12-30,40976902,Michael,"This is a cute and simple studio apartment with a great view of downtown Seattle, the space needle and the Olympic mountains.  It is also in a great and quiet location in the exciting neighborhood of Capitol Hill."
3543791,58428984,2016-01-02,15761102,Karin,"Clare was a very accommodating host, even from the other side of the country! Her apartment is in a charming, vintage building in one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in Seattle. As a local, I can attest that Clare has a unique, fantastic view of the Space Needle backed by the Olympic Mountains. The view is even more amazing in person than in the photos! Her room is full of lovely plants and charming decor. Next time I need a local getaway in the city, I am definitely going to check here first!
A note for drivers: Capitol Hill can be a challenge to find parking, but this neighborhood has some stretches with free parking available. Just takes a keen eye and a little patience."
610989,7357652,2013-09-16,8777698,Marion,She came recommended and succeeded every expectation. Thank you
8473056,48829237,2015-09-28,42853411,Sally,"The house was exactly as described, small and charming and a perfect base for a weekend away.  Liza was helpful and quick to respond to queries, the neighbourhood is a quiet leafy suburb and a straightforward fifteen minute drive from downtown.  We were 3 adults and 3 children and we fit fine. Good value for a sweet house!"
8473056,57710454,2015-12-28,51423839,Patricia,"We enjoyed our stay from the moment we walked into Liza's charming 1930's home. It was just as advertised, in a lovely neighborhood close to downtown Seattle. Since there were seven of us, we used the basement bedroom also, which was private and comfortable. It was our Christmas trip to see family and we spent our time playing games we brought - only to see they had games available there, too. Great first bnb experience for us. "
5548982,28533544,2015-03-25,28834546,Xabier,I loved my stay at Genes apartment. It was my first airbnb experience and Gene was quick answering my questions. The apartment is in a great location to visit the City with plenty of bus connections nearby. I would stay here again.
5548982,29123569,2015-04-04,15680193,Victoria,While we never met Gene face to face we felt very prepared and welcomed for our stay. The directions for checking in and out were clear and accurate. Our location on Capital Hill was perfect and the apartment was very cute. The bed was dreamy and we enjoyed hanging out at Gene's place.
5548982,29423464,2015-04-07,29001551,Gina,This place was so cozy! A perfect place to chill after walking around in rainy Seattle. The location is very central with plenty of great restaurants and stores in walking distance. Totally recommend this spot!!
5548982,29631166,2015-04-10,15962183,Katie,Great location. Clean lodgings. Gene was very helpful and accommodating. Would rent again. 
5548982,29753869,2015-04-12,17980460,Brooke,"Gene was an amazing host and quick to confirm our reservation for a quick weekend trip to Seattle. She made the process simple and she is informative and really knows her stuff :) The space was warm and inviting with a great view of the sunset, with a four poster queen size bed to boot! The studio was a corner unit and so it was quiet and away from the busy front street. Capitol Hill has tons of nightlife and food to offer and we enjoyed walking everywhere over the weekend since once you find a prime parking spot you don't want to let it go! If it's raining she even supplies you with umbrellas and coffee to warm you right up. Downtown is just over the highway and there's so much to do in between. We will definitely return and rent from Gene again :)"
5548982,29900186,2015-04-13,16921306,Eric,"Overall really great! The apartment is within all the gay district hot spots we wanted to visit. The apartment is a small, but cozy space and the bed is awesome! I did feel a little weird with the self-checkout, but it was also really easy to figure out."
5548982,30044744,2015-04-16,17262728,Anna,"Capitol Hill is a great location for exploring Seattle. Gene's studio was exactly as described, spotless clean and well equipped. Check-in and check-out are efficient, Gene was very fast at replying and left the instructions needed, making everything clear and simple."
5548982,30455767,2015-04-22,3238963,David,"Gene confirmed my stay immediately and subsequent communication was always easy and clear. The Studio looks terrific, it is also super comfortable, clean, and modern. 
The location is great with lots of restaurants, bars, and transport options close by - it is an easy short walk into the city centre. I would stay here again for sure and highly recommend Gene's studio."
5548982,30698951,2015-04-26,3798510,Chelsea,"Gene, even though far away, made the experience very simple and easy. The apartment was clean & very cute. Great location in Seattle. "
5548982,30817847,2015-04-27,16441955,Blanche,"The studio was just as described and in a fantastic location. Walking distance to markets, bars, restaurants and some cute shops! Parking in the neighborhood wasn't too bad either. The self check in/check out was very simple. "
5548982,30950845,2015-04-29,6983246,Marc,We felt as welcome as possible for not having any contact with the host. The place was exactly what we expected in reference to the air bnb post. The neighbourhood was perfect.
5548982,31018071,2015-04-30,17383015,Kat,"The place was easy to find and close to lots of bars and a Starbucks that sells beer! Pretty cool if I wasn't pregnant but my husband enjoyed it. No parking at all around the place so be prepared to pay if you can find a lot. The room was bright and clean. Obviously very old but maintained well. Plenty of hot water for showers and the bed was super comfy. No TV but we didn't need one, we were out exploring Seattle most of the time. At night the place was quiet, not hard to fall asleep. If you like to sleep in and light bothers you bring a mask, the blinds don't keep the morning sun out too well. Overall we had a great experience and would stay there again!"
5548982,31088650,2015-05-01,31231599,Andrea,Awesome vintage place in a good location! 
5548982,31450175,2015-05-05,30076582,Erik,Great location and view. Very comfortable and relaxing. Really loved how clean and simple everything was. 
5548982,31622762,2015-05-07,725262,Thomas,Lovely space. Centrally located and easy to access. Would definitely go back!

5548982,31926168,2015-05-11,10349051,Andreina,I had a great time here! Great location. So clean and the bed was super comfy. Walking distance from so many places.
5548982,32255969,2015-05-16,18696057,Taylor,The listing's instructions explained the details about the apartment very well and Gene replied very quickly to any messages I sent her. 
5548982,32730184,2015-05-20,30549163,Kylie,"Beautiful home, lovely views and this bed is so comfortable I am pretty sure I'll be staying in it up until 10:59... "
5548982,32784342,2015-05-21,10042488,Wyatt,"I had a great one-night stay in the comfortable studio. As described, and would stay again and recommend."
5548982,32968256,2015-05-24,28903355,Samantha,"This is a wonderful apartment in a fantastic location. Two blocks uphill and you're on Broadway with its eclectic bars and restaurants (Julia's cocktail list is a wonder all by itself!), only 15 minutes downhill you are at the hub of Seattle with easy access everywhere.

Aside from location this apartment has pretty much everything you need for a stay of any duration. Great decor, beautiful finishing touches and fabulous original features. 

As a first time airbnb booking this has set my standards very high indeed!"
5548982,33501740,2015-05-29,16121877,Keith,"The studio appt is fantastic. Incredible light with large windows on two sides and beautifully decorated and furnished.  Everything worked well. It is very well located with a bus stop 1 minute away to downtown, to which one could walk in 20 mins anyway. 
There was some initial confusion regarding parking but, although scarce, it is possible to find unmetered parking nearby.
I thoroughly enjoyed my 3 nights stay and if I am ever inSeattle again would want to stay in the appt."
5548982,33803146,2015-06-01,31095447,Matthew,Nice apartment in a perfect location. Comfy bed and great views.

5548982,34416636,2015-06-08,20584385,Tim,"The place was great, and the location couldn't be better.  The communication with Gene and his representative was spot on.  We will definitely be willing to stay here again next time we come to town.  Thanks again!!! "
5548982,34730483,2015-06-11,13557625,Barbara,"We found the location to be excellent. On bus lines with access to restaurants (glos has a great breakfast), pastry shop, and coffee houses. The apartment was clean and small in an older apartment building with a slow elevator and dirty hall rugs. We never got to meet Gene but we did interact with Daniel who helps manage the apartment and lives dowstairs."
5548982,34774240,2015-06-12,1450031,Jeremy,"Our stay in this studio apartment was very pleasant. We only stayed one night because of our trip schedule, but we would have been happy staying there a full week! Everything that you might want is provided (including two sets of two umbrellas (one pair compact ones and one pair full-size Mary-Poppin-esq ones). The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked. The bed and linens were clean and luxurious. The view was pretty stellar too!

The neighborhood appears to be going through a transition as it slowly becomes more gentrified. There were several great bars/restaurants/bakeries/coffee shops within easy walking distance, but bring your walking shoes because there are some steep hills in this neighborhood!

No issues with check-in/check-out and building access either. For young 30-somethings pretending to be hip 20-somethings for a couple of days, this spot suited us perfectly. We'll certainly be back! "
5548982,35085912,2015-06-15,9554717,Andrey,Very clean apartment in a nice neighborhood. I'd recommend this place to anyone who is planning a trip to Seattle.
5548982,35234606,2015-06-16,9593382,Anne,"The apartment was clean, spacious for a studio and full of thoughtful conveniences, like umbrellas and shampoos. The check-in/check-out process was quick and efficient, which is perfect for a guest who wants an easy stay. "
5548982,35550723,2015-06-20,25440474,Perry,"The apartment was in a great location, and was tastefully decorated with lots of windows and natural light. The bed was comfortable and the apartment had amenities like umbrellas, extra towels, dishes, wifi, etc (laundry facilities were in the basement of the building). The check-in process was easy and well-explained.
One negative was that the apartment had a smoky smell -- we weren't sure if it was from the previous guests or somewhere in the building (listing states ""Smoke free""). We contacted Gene and were told that it might be from new neighbors. We were able to keep the windows open the entire stay which helped, but the smell persisted."
5548982,36380253,2015-06-28,31184894,Karla,Had a great time!  The neighborhood was wonderful and in a great location.  The studio was clean and the bed was super comfy!  Would definitely stay here again.  Would not recommend having to bring a car though - on street parking never seemed available and the pay lot across the street was expensive.  The bus to downtown (right outside the building) was super easy to use and the Starbucks next door was convenient for a morning coffee.   
5548982,36930630,2015-07-02,37056587,Daniel,Great place; clean; welcoming / nice neighborhood / 
5548982,38108829,2015-07-13,30921650,Kramer,"Gene's place was great! Looked just like the pictures. Location is ideal, we didn't even need a rental car! Everything is a short walk away (a mile to downtown which is mostly downhill). On the way back up the hill I would suggest using uber or lyft (around a $10 ride).  Plenty of towels, soaps, and anything else you would need plus a very comfortable bed. Would definitely stay here again. "
5548982,38356520,2015-07-14,725262,Thomas,Second time staying at this lovely studio. Perfect location for getting to everything in town. Great amenities and easy access. Will come back! 
5548982,38490931,2015-07-16,31483765,Crysta,"Gene's place was ideally located in a nice area that provided us access to all the local attractions. The view from the Apt was great, the place was clean and very comfortable."
5548982,38629734,2015-07-17,7803308,Miriam,"Gene made the check in & out process very easy. The bed was extremely comfortable & the place was very clean. 
This place is in a very excellent location. 15mins stroll to downtown & in the heart of Capitol Hill. 
I would recommend staying here. "
5548982,38716089,2015-07-18,33610256,Stephanie,"The studio was beautiful, clean, and had plenty of windows/natural light.  The neighborhood is great, with a lot of options for restaurants/bars nearby.  Check-in, check-out was easy and the bed was VERY comfortable for 2 tall people!  Would stay here again!"
5548982,39309476,2015-07-22,36826506,Kelli,"Gene's studio was such a great place to stay as we spent a few days sightseeing in Seattle. The location is perfect walking distance from many of the major sights near downtown and the city view was great to come back to at night. Also, the neighborhood was located in a great area for grabbing a meal or drink with many different options. We loved having a little market right across the street to stock up on breakfast and snacks as well as the Starbucks for a quick coffee. Great place to stay and highly recommended. Would definitely stay here again if ever back in town. "
5548982,39915587,2015-07-27,31238593,Briana,"AWESOME apartment! Entirely accurate of the description and accompanying photos. Corner apartment with lots of light, great views, and ceiling fan kept it nice and cool. 

Great neighborhood; Starbucks across the street, major grocery store QFC about 6-8 minute walk away along with a RiteAid, and endless places to grab a bite out at. Location was ideal for heading to CHBP for the 3 days but also easy to walk to and from downtown and South Lake Union. 

I would absolutely recommend this spot to others. "
5548982,40202695,2015-07-29,6004352,Debbie,"We sincerely enjoyed our stay in this charming, vintage apartment in the heart of Seattle's most popular neighborhood, Capital Hill. Many of the city's best restaurants are within walking distance of the apartment. The check-in instructions were very clear and the bed was extremely comfortable! Great view and plenty of windows to open. Parking can be difficult. Overall, we really loved our stay and will be back again next time we visit Seattle! Thank you, Gene!"
5548982,40490690,2015-07-31,26966014,Chris,Easy check in and out process.   Great location.   
5548982,41214152,2015-08-05,31726646,Kyla,"This was a great location and a nice space. Loved the decor, everything was functional and easy, and it was overall a great stay."
5548982,41596493,2015-08-08,32935578,Gary,The apartment and location were perfect!  We loved the neighborhood and restaurants nearby!  Transportation to the market was easy on the 43.  We would definitely stay here again!  
5548982,42637479,2015-08-14,41189460,Francisco,"This place is amazing. Highly recommended. Clean and fun while located near many options for food and entertainment. It shows how much pride the host has of this rental by the way it is clean,  furnished and well taken care of. The view of downtown and the Space Needle was probably my favorite. I would book this place for my work trips again. The check-in/ check-out process was flawless. A true Seattle experience. "
5548982,43174550,2015-08-17,31872532,Phil,"It was in a cool area. Nothing to complain about here, the place was very clean and spacious."
5548982,43390516,2015-08-19,11848899,Sebastian,"Wow. Absolutely flawless experience! Gene is truly an absolute pro. We loved the apartment, the building and the neighborhood. How can you beat a place on Capitol Hill with an amazing vintage store storefront downstairs? 
We walked everywhere and loved coming home to our comfy bed just up the hill.
Thanks for everything, Gene! We had a really great time."
5548982,43640714,2015-08-21,258226,Emily,"We loved our stay in Gene's beautiful vintage apartment! Check in & out was a breeze, the bathroom was fully stocked and the bed was not only gorgeous, but very comfortable. We really enjoyed the bars & restaurants in the neighborhood, as well as the proximity to popular tourist destinations. I would definitely recommend you stay at Gene's apartment!"
5548982,44175958,2015-08-24,33126327,Laura,"Although my stay was short, the experience was excellent. The home was beautiful, check in was simple and communication was solid!"
5548982,44543461,2015-08-27,3301381,Alexandra,Great location and apartment!  The checkin/checkout process was very easy.
5548982,45662040,2015-09-05,6350837,Lindsay,"The location was perfect (easy to Uber/walk everywhere we wanted to go) and both Jason and Gene were extremely helpful and responsive. Plus lots of travel-sized toiletries and a hair dryer - always a plus!

If you're a light sleeper, take note - we did wake up to loud music at 3am one night and what could only be described as a circular saw at 4am the other. It's an old building so sounds do travel very easily. There's not much that can be done about that, of course. I'd recommend ear plugs or headphones. Overall the stay was great. "
5548982,45967120,2015-09-07,39289850,Deborah,"Location could not have been better.  Great, centrally located neighborhood. "
5548982,46345726,2015-09-09,39039283,Matthew,Good neighborhood to stay in. Good proximity to downtown attractions. Easy check in and check out.
5548982,46808320,2015-09-13,6724198,Dylan,"Great location and the apartment is fantastic. The building had me worried at first, as it is not nearly as kept up as the apartment - but I was quite pleased. Wonderful views and a great experience. Try analog coffee down the road!"
5548982,47320142,2015-09-17,16258133,Hisham,Great little spot in the heart of Capitol Hill. I would recommend this place and would stay here again next time I visit. Gene and co made for a smooth check-in and check-out process. The studio looks just like the pictures and has a nice view of the neighboring buildings. 
5548982,47821100,2015-09-21,43388213,Lauren,"I loved my stay here! Gene was incredibly helpful, meeting me after I arrived because the checking process was being changed. The bed was so comfortable! The location is so close to Broadway where there are a ton of restaurants and shops. I met up with a friend and we walked down to Pikes Place market. 

The explanation of how the key to the door didn't really make sense until I had to leave the first night. Give yourself a couple minutes to lock the door when you leave. 

If I ever come back to Seattle, I will definitely want to stay here again. "
5548982,48340706,2015-09-25,15764189,Becca,"Lovely place, clean and comfortable. Incredibly attentive to guest needs."
5548982,48879166,2015-09-29,7559963,Mitch,"Nice apartment. Great location. Gene was always reachable by text. My only complaint is the bathroom could've been cleaner. Also, be prepared to hear neighbors' running water, closing doors, etc because walls tend to be thinner than normal in historic apartments. Last, I recommend that Gene push checkout time from 11:00 a.m. to noon. I would stay there again."
5548982,49482130,2015-10-04,17973824,Annemarie,"Beautiful little studio with a great view in a really nice neighborhood. 
The only issues we had were that we did not get the updated housemanual before arriving which cause a bit of confusion and stress at check in. After a couple of calls we were able to get into the apartment though. :)
Also the doors can be quite tricky, on the first evening it took us about 10min to lock the apartment door (scary bc we didnt want to break it). 
Gene was always communicative which was very helpful.
Would recommend others to stay here.  "
5548982,49689147,2015-10-05,250023,Justin,Host was fast and communicative.  Experience was great. 
5548982,49856064,2015-10-06,24626874,Rocio,"By far the worst experience I've had in air bnb. The apartment is in a good location in regards to getting around the city etc, but Gene the owner was awful to work with. I called the on location person because I was unclear as to what room number I was in. A women answered she was really friendly and helped me out but I could here gene screaming in the background ""did she not read the house manual."" Which I indeed did but when you've been traveling all day have your hands full all I wanted was a clear simple answer. I finally got in, the bed was unmade so it led me to believe they had not cleaned after the last guest. The towels in the restroom were mildewed. Do  not open the windows because the stench of urine from the homeless people living behind the building will come wafting in. Gene then proceeded to harass me via text as to why I had not read the house manual. I explained to him that I had but it was unclear. He was very derogatory and told me ""it is required that I read the dammed house manual"" he then threatened to leave me a bad review. ""He said not to test him, that I should google him so I could see he was serious"" I felt very unsafe staying there I immediately called Airbnb but I didn't have any other options since it was late at night and I was traveling with my 70 yr old father and I was flying out super early. This was overall an awful experience due to Gene's lack of professionalism. Air bnb should not allow people like him to host. "
5548982,50020642,2015-10-08,44880822,Matthew,"The apartment was clean and orderly.  The pictures accurately reflect the conditions of the place.  Check in was easy; Gene has a local manager that helped us out with everything.

The neighborhood is great.  The local bars are fun, including a ""pie"" bar with delicious cherry rubarb.  The local coffee is great, as long as you venture past starbucks.  There are plenty of food options in the area as well.  The location is a 20 minute walk to downtown, including Pike Place, the Library, the Art museum, and more.

We did have an issue with hot water, but the problem was resolved promptly with help from Gene's local manager.  Unfortunately, due to our plans, we had to take cold showers the morning of the first day.

Overall the stay was great.  We would definitely stay here again."
5548982,52675709,2015-11-01,1767766,Matt,"I had a great experience with Gene and his studio! The check-in experience was easy and I felt very welcomed by Gene's local rep Daniel. The building and studio are beautifully historic - which is a nice change from cookie-cutter hotel rooms. The studio itself is well-stocked and made my 5-day stay very comfortable. The neighborhood is awesome! I chose the studio based on its proximity to the convention center (where I was attending a work-related conference all week), but the neighborhood was a nice surprise - it's hip and vibrant with restaurants and bars everywhere. I can't recommend this studio highly enough!"
5548982,53098541,2015-11-04,47851258,Sofia,"This place is conveniently located. It's a few blocks off the freeway, a few blocks below Broadway, near many restaurants, public transportation, a little walk to cbd, cheap fare to pikes place market. As for the property itself, it's like staying at home. Very homey, nice view of the needle, great furniture, bedding, kitchen, etc. I loved staying here, and I would stay again. Parking can be challenging, but who needs a car when you are centrally located to EVERYTHING!!! Cabs, bike rentals, walking, buses, are all a few steps away! I had a great stay for my first time using this website. Thank you Gene!!! :)"
5548982,53314998,2015-11-07,7341683,Lisa,"What a great place to come back to and relax. Nice comfy bed. Enough floor space to lay my yoga mat down and stretch after being cramped in the car for hours. I never saw Gene, but we did message back and forth and she was very prompt and helpful. I loved the studio, I wish it was mine! "
5548982,53481305,2015-11-09,1753377,Bonnie,"Absolutely beautiful view from this cute little studio apartment. Close to all, Capital Hill, Cornish. Great neighborhood with lots of places to eat. Parking is a little tricky but hey, that's the city for you!
Never met the host but the instructions for entry into the building and apartment were clear."
5548982,54071856,2015-11-15,9340742,Rochelle,"We had an amazing experience, the location the room and everything was perfect. I love her amazing furniture and the view was spectacular."
5548982,54656482,2015-11-22,39269939,Jessica,"If you love vintage everything, as I do, this may just be the place for you. The furniture was truly amazing, and you can tell they've put some money into the place. They leave you everything you need for a comfortable stay, including lots of yummy smelling soaps and Amazon Prime for that late night movie you need to help you fall asleep. There's an awesome view of the mountains on clear days, and you're pretty close to just about everything anyone could ever need for an awesome stay in Seattle. However, I wish the place had been kept up a little better. It seems it hadn't been swept or mopped in a while, and I had a hard time getting comfortable. I also never met the host, but their onsite liaison was helpful in finding the place and getting in. Biggest Advantages: Great location, awesome vintage everything. Biggest Disadvantages: Neighbors who smoke constantly, and lacking in the cleanliness department."
5548982,54943925,2015-11-25,10375503,Elizabeth,The Vintage Studio was a beautiful place to stay and the caretaker Daniel was incredibly caring! I loved looking at the city lights while relaxing in bed and I loved being able to easily explore Capital Hill (I found a pie and cocktail bar right nearby!). I also appreciated the anytime self check-in. I would absolutely stay at The Vintage Studio again.
5548982,55060195,2015-11-27,7661102,Alex,"We only need a place for one night to escape from an overcrowded house on Thanksgiving and this apartment made out escape really pleasurable. Very nicely executed decor, very convenient location, clean, a fun, practically thrilling, way of acquiring the keys, very comfortable and beautiful bed. We almost slept through the strict check out time.  Thanks.  We are definitely bookmaking this one for future escapes."
5548982,55479729,2015-12-01,48633650,Marie,"The apartment was very clean and decorated really nicely. We had everything we could want in the way of coffee, shampoo etc. The view was an added bonus with the Space Needle and the Christmas decorations on the buildings downtown all lit up. Super convenient to shops, restaurants and entertainment.  It was easy to follow the directions to get in and out and Gene was very prompt in getting back to us when we needed it. We are thinking of renting another of his properties for Christmas/New Years Eve we liked it so much.
We would highly recommend his spaces and would stay here again.
Rob and Marie"
5548982,56930868,2015-12-20,13960822,Ken,Great location. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Good views and natural light from the many windows.
5548982,57909538,2015-12-30,14932366,Jessica,The studio was perfect for our needs while we were in Seattle. It was clean and enough space for two. We stayed out most of the day and it was a cozy place to return to in the evening. The restaurants and bars in the area were fantastic and none more than a 5-10min walk. 
5548982,58094124,2015-12-31,32321245,Ndungwa,"Very nice studio. Great location. Spectacular views all around. Beautiful cozy, warm bed. Just a note to add for other guests that the elevator is extremely slow; you might this for a second that you are stuck inside but not....it's just slow. Overall enjoyed staying here."
7921289,49535468,2015-10-04,22591792,Margaret,"Beautiful apartment in a great location.  Views were stellar, and so many delicious places were a short walk or a few minutes ride."
5852034,32588574,2015-05-19,31306487,Virginia,"Hannah's tiny house was immaculate, and well thought through.  At the end of a long day it was nice to be able to lay in bed and look out the skylight over the bed. On the day I arrived, I was starved but pleasantly surprised to find several bottles of spring water in the fridge. There was also some lemon/cucumber water and great tasting organic quinoa, organic oatmeal and even a couple of yogurts in the fridge. There was also custom made tiny house cookies in the freezer, they were delicious. Hannah was a great host, she answered all my questions. I would highly recommend her tiny house to anyone seeking a nice, clean, safe, cute, eccentric place to stay. "
5852034,33156661,2015-05-25,27544324,Beth,"We had such a great stay at Hannah's tiny house! It was exactly as described, and is remarkably well designed and built. Hannah's instructions and welcome letter were perfect. Highly recommend this for anyone looking for a unique stay!"
5852034,33623825,2015-05-30,9916614,Penny,"Hannah was amazing :) Her house was a charm and she provided us with everything we needed during our stay there. This was a really unique experience, and if we're ever back in Seattle, we'll definitely go back again! "
5852034,34216940,2015-06-06,32504392,Viktoriya,Staying at Hannah's lovely house was truly an incredible experience  - the house is adorable and made both my girlfriend and I feel like we were at home. My only feedback is about the shower - it's pretty dark in there even with the small light. Maybe changing the curtain will help? Rather than that everything was amazing. The sodas and the snacks were a nice touch as well. 
5852034,34446066,2015-06-08,4386475,Charneice,"I more than adored everything about this little house. I didn't want to leave. Or if I did, I just wanted to hitch it to a pick-up and take it with me. It has everything you need. Even a full sized washing machine! Seriously considering a mini mansion of my own. I liked that I had my own autonomy in my own place but Hannah was just a pathway away in the big house if I needed anything.

This was my first trip to Seattle and this will probably be my lodging of choice for the future."
5852034,34794705,2015-06-12,33401050,Dusty,"The house was very cute. My wife and I loved relaxing in here after a long day out exploring Seattle. Neighbourhood was alright- we felt quite safe walking to the grocery store in the late afternoons/ early evening. Bus to downtown was really close by too. I was surprised at the amount of headroom I still had in this place- I'm 6'2, but had plenty of clearance on the main floor walking around etc. A quick drive or bike ride took us to Lincoln Park, or the ferry terminal to Vashon Island. This house was a great place to have as a home base for exploring. "
5852034,34874020,2015-06-13,16003329,Kathleen,"What a special opportunity to dwell in a tiny mansion so close to Seattle's many charms. Unique and memorable addition to our vacation itinerary. 
Thank you, next time we will stay to enjoy Turkish coffee and wait for your selected breakfast place to open!"
5852034,35102664,2015-06-15,32684933,Jeremiah,"We LOVED our stay at the tiny house! The house is beautifully built, functional, charming and such a unique experience. We highly recommend staying here. Thanks so much Hannah! "
5852034,36108550,2015-06-25,33708845,Meaghan,We loved staying here and living tiny for a few days! It was nice being in a neighborhood close to stores and parks. It has so many quaint touches that make it feel cozy. Our family of 4 loved having a quiet space to relax after exploring the city. Would definitely recommend staying here and experiencing this calming space!
5852034,36195785,2015-06-26,1350639,Coleen,"What a great experience staying in Hannah's awesome Tiny House! Her house was very well designed. I arrived to a fridge with organic food in it! Hannah is very helpful and accommodating. She even contacted me when I left something there by mistake. Great place, Great host, what more could you ask for! "
5852034,36402706,2015-06-28,33496377,Maggy,hannah made us feel very welcome. we got to chat with her about tiny homes and how cool they are!
5852034,37158975,2015-07-05,22465887,Roxanne,"My best friend and I loved calling this tiny house our home during our stay in Seattle! It was a super cozy place to unwind after a long day of touring the city. We marveled at the designed of the house and enjoyed the cute decorations Hannah placed throughout it. The bed was comfortable—it was nice waking up under the skylight to the morning sun. We also appreciated the ability to cook in and help ourselves to food around the house. (The cucumber-lemon water was very refreshing, by the way!) The stairs were cool! There was enough space to store our shoes and small bags under each step. There were outlets all over the tiny house to keep our devices chargds (including USB ports!) Aside from the house, Hannah was very responsive and communicated well. My only complaint is that the water temperature for the shower was too hot for us. Other than that, we enjoyed every minute of our stay here!"
5852034,38124831,2015-07-13,33243711,Greg,"Lots of firsts for this trip.  First time to seattle,  first time in a tiny home and first time using airBnB.    Being newbies to the entire experience,  Hannah and the maiden mansion was a wonderful way to get started.  Hannah was prompt, engaging and courteous as a host.  The maiden mansion was adorned with instructions and we never felt stuck given the quirkiness of  tiny home.   The maiden mansion herself was exquisite.  Beautifully built and adorned,  much love and care was put into bringing her to life.   As a bonus,  Hannah had her stocked with coffee,  oatmeal, sodas and yogurts!  That saved us a few trips to the store.    I can't say enough good things about our experience.   We thought we would enjoy the tiny home,  but never thought we'd have our socks charmed off!   Thanks again Hannah! "
5852034,38391784,2015-07-15,3185355,Laurent,What a treat to experience living in a tiny house. Hannah did a superb job at making us comfortable and welcome. 
5852034,38707709,2015-07-18,32226495,Erik,"The Tiny House was everything we could have asked for and more! Very cozy, slept four people comfortably, the best place we stayed on our trip. The weird toilet was a surprise, but not a dealbreaker."
5852034,39001447,2015-07-20,7781010,Shannon,"We felt very welcome in Hannah's Tiny House.  It was the perfect size for myself and my daughters.  They had such a great time cooking breakfast and reading the many books available.  The beds were comfortable and the house had everything we needed.  
The location was perfect for our weekend swim meet at the Colman Pool in Lincoln Park.
Thank you for making it a fun adventure, Hannah. "
5852034,39222277,2015-07-21,2449254,Steve,"Hannah's Tiny house is just wonderful. It is cozy, and has everything you need.  This was my first time staying in a tiny house and Hannah was available to answer questions about building it and you could just tell how much she loved her little place. I would highly, highly recommend staying here and this will be my first choice the next time I am in Seattle, anytime of year."
5852034,39488786,2015-07-24,2056691,Angela,"Perfect little eco-friendly/organic oriented house.  Great bus connection to downtown.  There was everything, and I mean everything, you need for comfortable stay in that lovely Tiny House.  Different experience that we will always cherish. Thank you!"
5852034,40092636,2015-07-28,2813901,Melinda,A lovely experience in a very charming tiny home. Two couples were cozy but it totally worked.  Turkish coffee and breakfast supplies were a much appreciated surprise. Loved waking up and opening my eyes to look out the window in the roof into the trees. We took the bus in the mornings and took über to get back home ( about 25.00).  
5852034,40360452,2015-07-30,34938338,Theresa,I loved my time at the maiden mansion! The place was just as cute as the pictures! Hannah was super helpful and quick to respond to any questions I had. The neighborhood was quiet and I was able to easily catch the bus and ride all the way to pike place with no transfers. Super easy! Cooked dinner in the kitchen and it was fun! Bed was super comfortable and every thing was clean and tidy. All in all it was a great experience in a tiny house! Would stay there again in a heart beat.
5852034,40606505,2015-08-01,28823186,Grethe Kofoed,We have felt very welcome in tinyhouse. The small house has functioned perfectly and has a very fine location relative to downtown and the airport. Hanna is a nice host and thanks for the breakfast and other surprises in the refrigerator. It was clean and neat. We can hHighly recommended the place. Best regards Grethe  Denmark
5852034,41373908,2015-08-07,36010958,Nina,"We really loved staying in the tiny house, it was a great experience for the kids as well. We felt really welcome with all the little things which make it easy to feel at home, i.e. a bit of water and a couple of eggs for us in the fridge, everything very clean. "
5852034,41616841,2015-08-08,28823186,Grethe Kofoed,Thank you Hanna for a fantastic stay in your tinyhouse.
5852034,41938314,2015-08-10,12744219,Kayla,"Very neat place to stay! Hannah was excellent, the space functioned very well. The place was easy to find and close to downtown! I loved it!"
5852034,42259503,2015-08-12,30741137,Kyle,"Our family felt very welcome and cozy in this tiny house.  The house has a ton of quirks due to its tiny nature but our family had a blast exploring each one of them (many helpful instructions are also provided within the house).  Hannah, our host, was extremely welcoming and respectful of our privacy.  The house is situated in a very sweet neighborhood with many places nearby to eat and purchase supplies.  Living here for just 2 nights gave our family a new perspective on living with a small footprint and we hope to carry some of that perspective into our own home."
5852034,42671968,2015-08-15,33456064,Yomahra,"Hannas Tiny House was beautiful! A group of four of us stayed for three nights. Hanna was always quick to reply when we had questions or needed anything. Having a loft bed and a bed at the bottom level really makes it feel like you have your own space, there is also plenty of storage space in the loft area. Both beds were very comfortable and fit two people comfortably on each bed. We really enjoyed or stay in the house, however things to keep in mind before staying here with a group of four: there is no seating space because the table is made into the second bed, which wasn't really a problem for us because we were out most of the time. There is no AC, which wasn't too big of a problem, we stayed mid August and just left the windows open all day and the ceiling fan on. It was pretty cool once it got dark. Also we ended up using the kitchen sink to brush our teeth and wash up because the sink in the bathroom is very small. Despite these small things, we still enjoyed our stay. We also enjoyed the Turkish coffee and a few snacks that were in the fridge. Thank you!"
5852034,43529139,2015-08-20,39387018,Audrey,"We loved our stay at the Maiden Mansion, what a cute little house and so affordably priced! It was cozy and comfortable. Hannah was a great hostess, she made us feel welcome and at home.  We were celebrating my husband's 50th birthday, Hannah went out of her way to help me make this very special for him. We loved the surprise waiting in the fridge, it was so much more than I could have imagined or hoped for. Thank you, Hannah!  Her Mom was also very kind and thoughtful, we really appreciated her extra efforts to help us. The location was great, we used public transportation for part of our stay and it was very accessible, just a quick walk to the bus stop. We would highly recommend Hannah and her tiny house to anyone considering staying there.
"
5852034,44454892,2015-08-26,15200440,Christina,"The accommodations were fantastic, lots of great amenities, comfortable, clean beds, tons of character. Great to have a kitchen.

There was a little bit of unexpected noise from the surrounding houses, but not too bad. 

Also a great opportunity to experience a tiny house!

Definitely looking forward to staying again if we are in town. "
5852034,44768126,2015-08-29,33838023,Kelly,"Entering a home that is stocked full of all of the little things that you didn't even know you forgot for your trip is a true testament that she wants her guests to feel at home and enjoy themselves.
There was food in the fridge and cupboards which we were invited to help ourselves to.
Hannah has really taken the time to make you feel like you're staying at a dear friend's house. 
We will definitely book again if we find ourselves in Seattle again, and recommend it to others. "
5852034,45660223,2015-09-05,34956557,Duane,"What an amazing stay! I was aware of tiny houses long before they got their TV show, and was intrigued by the concept, however I didn't (and still don't) expect that my life direction would ever lend itself to living in a tiny house (although, my wife and I maintain a relatively small footprint with a ""small"", not ""tiny"" house that works quite well for us). But I was still always fascinated by the idea, and never thought I would have the opportunity to stay in one. So glad we did! Hannah has done an amazing job on the construction and design, and it was quite comfortable and mostly convenient for our 3 day stay in Seattle. Right downtown would have been even more convenient, but it was very easy to take 1 of 2 different bus routes to get to downtown, and it made us feel more like ""living with the locals"" by doing so. Wish we could have met Hannah while we were there! She thought of everything to make our stay well worth it. Just one word of warning: if you are what you might consider ""high maintenance"", you might want to think twice before considering the just the ""cuteness"" you see. I had very little issues with the ""small"" compromises, like a shower that is a bit difficult to maneuver in, the composting toilet, bed at the top of the stairs, etc., but those are a few things to think about before you just jump into it -- some people might be surprised by these things that aren't quite obvious from the photographs. I think they were well though out and made sense, but some people who are expecting all of the creature comforts of back home might have issues."
5852034,45965722,2015-09-07,10733861,Jamilah,"Hannah's tiny home was clean and cozy; the perfect recipe to change things up while on vacation. Everything you need and then some is packed into every little nook. The neighborhood is very safe, and Hannah was very responsive when called on. She even made sure there was fresh cucumber water in the fridge, which is way better than regular water. I recommend the house for someone who is looking for a change of pace when it comes to boarding. "
5852034,46313747,2015-09-09,41901347,Bonnie,My husband and I enjoyed are stay in Hannah's little house. It was very cozy had great snacks and lots of interesting books and knick knacks. Would highly recommend to travelers looking for a interesting adventure.  
5852034,46596777,2015-09-12,38943506,Philip,"The stay in the tiny house was great. Everything was immaculately clean, and the description was spot-on. Parking on the street was easy, and getting into downtown either by driving or by taking the bus didn't take too long."
5852034,47146926,2015-09-16,34687707,Tony,"This tiny home was the perfect place for us to rest during our trip. We managed to comfortably squeeze 4 people into this cozy little cottage. Hannah left us detailed instructions all over the house to ensure a pleasant stay, and the fridge was stocked with food upon arrival. The house was on a quiet street, close to local shops and cafes, and an easy drive to downtown! We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone!"
5852034,47664690,2015-09-21,32887492,Dawn,We had a wonderful experience staying at Hannah's little house. I wish we would have had more time because we would have loved to learn more about how she built it. It was VERY cute! 
5852034,48074250,2015-09-23,28529742,Krysta,"Hannah was an amazing host, and her tiny house was equally amazing. 

Would recommend this tiny house to anyone looking for a fun new experience. We are staying in a 4-star hotel in Tacoma now and missing the tiny house. "
5852034,48763526,2015-09-28,43388762,Christie,"Hannah was amazing and so was her tiny house!  The house was everything described in the listing (including the laundry chute!).  There were signs everywhere to help with things like the toilet and heater, so I didn't have to ask. :o) Hannah had contacted me prior to my arrival about what I would need as far as sleeping spaces and she made me feel so welcomed by writing me personal note to read when I got there! She even scheduled time out of her schedule to meet with me to talk about tiny houses! Hannah was so wonderful!  I highly recommend staying in the Maiden Mansion to anyone wanting to try tiny house living! (Thanx again, Hannah!)"
5852034,49015442,2015-09-30,39932197,Jessica,My boyfriend and I loved staying in the tiny house. Hannah sent us great suggestions for places to eat and had coffee available to us in the tiny house with almond milk ready in the fridge. I always wanted to stay in a tiny house and it was a great experience :)
5852034,49352473,2015-10-03,2887561,Kenneth,"We met Hannah upon arriving at Tiny House sooner than we expected and she was very welcoming. As she made last-minute touch ups to the house, Hannah invited us to leave our luggage inside so that we wouldn't be burdened with carrying them around while we explored the local vicinity (which was pleasant, quiet and very walkable). 

Her listing couldn't have been more accurate; we felt right at home when we returned to Tiny House to settle in. Easy to find and legible signs helped us figure out how the adorable cabin ticked and tocked, so nothing inside (or outside, for that matter) was confusing or difficult to operate. Even the nifty composting toilet was simple enough to figure out!

We were also quite surprised to find groceries at our disposal. There was a lightly stocked refrigerator, coffee, snacks and adventurous recipes waiting for us to try them out (and we did—the Turkish Coffee ended up tasting delicious). Perhaps the best part of Tiny House was the upstairs loft, which featured the most comfortable bed we've ever had the pleasure of sleeping on and a skylight which welcomed us with a gorgeous view of the overhead trees each morning. But back to the bed: we seriously did not want to get up every day due to how cozy we felt waking up!

Hannah built a brilliant little home for visitors looking to experience living in a minuscule abode. Every square inch of the house was built with efficiency and utility; no nook or cranny wasted. Everywhere we turned we'd discover a space that proved itself useful to our stay, whether it was extra storage or fold-out tables... 

Our host was also very helpful in acquainting us with the lay of the land, such as giving us directions to the nearest shopping center which was only a 15-minute walk from Tiny House. As if that wasn't convenient enough, there's a bus stop around the corner which leads to Downtown Seattle—a short trip that takes no more than twenty minutes in either direction. 

Hannah was always a text or phone call away if we needed her, but we never needed to contact her beyond letting her know that we were checking out on our last day. We loved our stay at Tiny House so much that we'll definitely be booking it again in the future and recommending it to all our friends looking for someplace to bunk when visiting Seattle. Our time there was short but sweet, making it an absolutely memorable vacation and one of our favorite Airbnb listings yet...

We can't recommend Tiny House enough!"
5852034,49610282,2015-10-05,40238936,Linda,Host friendly and welcoming! Extremely helpful
5852034,49985307,2015-10-08,16183649,Sandra,"This was our first stay in a tiny home.  Hannah was a fantastic host, we were able to check in and out at times that were convenient for us, any issue or question was quickly responded to via messenger, the maiden mansion was a dream (clean, comfortable and peaceful) to stay in and we got lots of ideas for our own build.  We love living tiny, it's one thing to see it on the web but now that we know what it is like (literally), we whole heartedly love it.  "
5852034,51278016,2015-10-19,40437464,Kathryn,Hannah build this tiny house and I think that is amazing. I came and went as I please without disturbing anyone.  There is also a motion sensor light on her garage that faces the tiny house. It made me feel and more comfortable knowing that it was there.  When I came back after dark I could see what I was doing and I felt safe.  I also felt safe and cozy in the tiny house.
5852034,51621260,2015-10-22,43452432,Sierra,"Hannah's Madien Mansion was everything I wanted and more. The bed was so cozy, the natural light was beautiful and everything had a space and a reason. Her helpful notes around the house made me feel comfortable and confident. It was so easy to leave and come back, just letting yourself through the gate. A nice shopping area nearby with a grocery store and some restaurants. Everything felt close. And can't beat a walk on Alki! Such a wonderful stay! Hope to do it again someday. "
5852034,52055710,2015-10-26,38577808,Sarah, The tiny house was a great first experience with a small home! Hannah was a wonderful host and made sure we had everything we needed!

Hannah was a great host with fast response times and a lot of patience. The notes around the house explaining everything were just what we needed to feel comfortable. Thank you for sharing your passion and kindness, Hannah! "
5852034,53125012,2015-11-05,22481579,Hannah,"The Maiden Mansion was perfectly cozy for my business trip! I REALLY enjoyed getting to try out tiny house living for a few days, and I even had a friend over for a chat! I didn't get a chance to cook, but the kitchen looked well equipped. I'll definitely be checking availability next time I'm up for a visit."
5852034,53611334,2015-11-10,44124851,Jennifer,"We had a wonderful time during our stay! The kids, in particular, we're sad to leave! Everything we needed was there and it was a quiet, cozy location to relax after touring around and visiting with friends. We are looking forward to staying again on a future trip to Seattle! "
5852034,54233860,2015-11-17,6547345,Yasmin,"Hannah was a wonderful hostess! She was always prompt in her replies to give us recommendations. She was also responsive to address the one small issue we had as soon as we arrived. We loved the experience of staying in a tiny home, and we are excited to one day build our own. She even took the time to chat about tiny homes over breakfast. She is doing so much to promote the tiny home experience. Her name will definitely be well-known one day! Thanks again for your time and giving us the opportunity to experience tiny home living for ourselves, Hannah!"
5852034,54433582,2015-11-20,43434406,Jennifer,Very cute tiny house. Clean and cozy. Really loved that I could cook simce we were on a budget. It was also in a great location. Only a bus ride to Pike Place Market and downtown.
5852034,54712045,2015-11-23,7690746,Jane,"This house is so cool! It felt so spacious inside, Hannah did a wonderful job designing it. Hannah was a super great host, and was happy to answer all of my questions about tiny houses. Would definitely stay here again! "

5852034,55998419,2015-12-07,19653216,Ben,"Hannah made us feel very welcome with the welcome note and instructions on Tiny House living! 
The description was very accurate and the house was exactly as it appears in the pictures. I'm a little bit taller so the bathroom was a bit tight but other than that everything was great! The beds were VERY comfortable!
The neighborhood was a little further away than we realized (we were visiting my brother who lives in Capitol Hill) however it was nice and quiet."
5852034,56475685,2015-12-14,43510910,Hannah,Loved staying at the maiden mansion! Pictures were 100% accurate. Would recommend to anyone. 
5852034,57244502,2015-12-23,28721144,Stephen,"We so enjoyed our pre-Christmas sojourn in Seattle. Hannah's tiny house was lovely! She was more than welcoming to us, providing the fixings for breakfast, and a warm house to welcome us in from the rain. Hannah was very responsive to our needs and was open to us arriving before check in time to drop off our luggage. The house was very clean. We were impressed with her commitment to the environment and green living though the compostable toilet was a bit of a challenge for me It is also very accessible to town though in a quiet neighborhood which was comforting after the rush of the city. We would recommend Maiden Mansion to other travelers."

I don't have much experiences with Airbnb, but this place is definitely must to go. Also Michelle and Gabby gave us very useful tips where we should go which was excellent. Simply, they are the best hosts and everybody should meet them :) Thx so much for help girls  "
9294832,55883549,2015-12-06,13361510,Hannah,Michelle and Gabby were fun and welcoming. Very accommodating. The house and room were clean and comfortable. It was perfect for my quick trip.

9294832,56822285,2015-12-18,51104659,Kris,"Michelle and Gabby were excellent hosts and friendly from the start. I had a bit of a weird situation with working night shifts and needing a place to sleep during the days while I was between apartments. They were very accommodating, the room was quiet, and the bed super comfortable. I'd highly recommend this to anyone loking for a place to stay. It's nothing special beyond a clean private room and access to the rest of the apartment. But you also don't need more then that and the price was very fair."
8392801,49570662,2015-10-04,1762497,Diana,"Great stay! Jackie was quick to respond and super sweet.  The place was very clean and we were provided with everything we needed.

They were prompt to get back to us and did a very nice job doing their best to accommodate our questions and requests. There are lots of close by food spots and the neighbors are nice. The finishes are pretty new and in excellent condition. The internet can be a little temperamental, but it’s nothing that a little power-cycling can’t fix. If we had to do it all over again, we’d stay here again in a heartbeat.   "

The location is prefect for me as I have the conference at the convention center. It takes only 5 mins to walk down to the convention center. I'd highly recommend anyone who is looking for the place that's close to that area. 

The place is clean and quiet. Aaron helped me check in and introduced everything I need. Aaron is a great host.

8065715,45872736,2015-09-06,7216720,Scott,"Aaron is my AirBnBFF. Simple as that. Dude has a killer set-up in the perfect location, took the time to show me around the nabe - HoneyHole Sandwiches! He also gives all his guests $1,000 cash upon arrival, says it's for ""walkin around money."" Doesn't get better than that! "
8065715,46651770,2015-09-12,20912520,Aaron,"The apartment was clean, well equipped, and close to the convention center. The complimentary local beer, coffee and tea upon my arrival was a nice welcome-to-seattle touch. Strong work, Aaron."

I highly recommend this host!

The house is wonderful and located in a great neighborhood: clean, safe and near the Washington State Convention Center. In five minutes you can also take the monorail to visit the main Seattle touristic attractions.
I strongly recommend this host!"

8065715,49731675,2015-10-05,2812223,Salil,"Aaron was a great host. My flight reached late, at 1 am, and he was there waiting for me. The place was cozy and had everything I needed for the stay - nice bed, blankets, pillows, toiletries.  Aaron has it down to a science. The outside patio was great. Kitchen had all amenities, coffee/tea options. The place is in the heat of downtown. Safe neighborhood to walk to places, coffee shops, bars, etc. "
8065715,51087185,2015-10-17,16351167,Amanda,"Great location and great host. Aaron met me and helped me find parking upon arrival. Condo felt safe, place was clean and bed was comfortable. I appreciated the French press. The only downside is parking. It's hard to find a place nearby to leave your car for an extended period, but there is a reasonably priced garage 2.5 blocks away. "
8065715,51219448,2015-10-18,24491005,Eric,Overall fantastic experience - I ended up staying at another property by the same host than the address originally provided. Still very pleased. Great location to Pike Place and restaurants/bars/clubs. I'd definitely stay here again. Aaron was gracious and welcoming and let me do my own thing. Fantastic!
8065715,51975085,2015-10-25,46190955,Jerry,"Aaron is the best. Basically expressing the same sentiments as most travels who have stayed at his place. The apartment was clean, modern, plenty of room, comfy bed. His location cannot be beat, it's the best, an easy $3.00 train ride from the airport, located in the heart of Seattle. Easy walking to everything, no need for a vehicle unless you leave the city. Aside from all these positives, Aaron is just a good guy, chill easy going and hospitable. I enjoyed meeting him & I will definitely hit him up on my next trip to Washington State."
8065715,53371236,2015-11-08,13337170,Salima,"Aaron was extremely welcoming and was willing to accommodate my schedule, which I really appreciated. The bedroom was comfortable, cozy, and clean. I really enjoyed my time in Seattle thanks to Aaron! The apartment is centrally located and a short distance from downtown Seattle and the multitude of bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. "
8065715,53896544,2015-11-14,23317744,Melanie,"Aaron let me know prior to my arriving he would be out of town and his friend would let me in.  The friend was very helpful and friendly.  The apartment is very clean and well-kept.  The room was also clean and the bed was very comfortable.  The location is very close to the convention center.  A very convenient location after a long day of walking.  There are several amenities I did not use but they were available (french press, ironing board).  "

8503720,48640363,2015-09-27,10315269,Nidhi,"Dan's place is strategically located. It's spacious and bright. 
We could walk to most destinations without trouble. 
There are many places to eat around her place. We found them on Yelp and they were all good. 
The pier is 10 min and pike place market 15 min by walk. 
You can see the space needle from her window! 
The building has a gym, terrace and parking spot . We had some trouble finding the parking spot and then the right elevator to the apt. 
The Internet is extremely slow, she has a tv, but no channels to watch..  
Dan is fun and open to suggestions Overall we had a wonderful experience in Seattle and this would not have been possible without her."
8503720,48960154,2015-09-29,25339145,Dylan,"Lovely apartment with a great view of the Space Needle, located near great diners, coffee shops, and Kerry Park. Dan provided detailed instructions for finding the parking garage and her apartment once I was parked, so I had no trouble finding anything. Slept peacefully in the quiet room and woke up fully recharged. Check out the nearby Mecca Cafe for anytime breakfast, coffee, or beer."
8503720,49293560,2015-10-02,24669681,Nadia,"The building was easy enough to find (using Dan's directions) and has parking included, which was nice. She was super accommodating for our check in time and getting us the key as we arrived later than expected. The room is spacious and clean, and the location is great. We stayed for a night and hit up a few local restaurants and bars all within walking distance. The rooftop view was incredible!  We went up at sundown and it was beautiful. All in all a very positive experience! 

The apartment is a little confusing to get to (there are multiple 507 units). The other thing to note is that Dan may be there during your stay, but we met her and she is super nice and when we returned to the room after everything  closed we tried to stay quiet and respectful.  There is no TV or bathroom access directly in the bedroom but we didn't need that for our trip as we just wanted the room. Overall it was a very pleasant experience!"
8503720,49831596,2015-10-06,37624948,Zac,"Can't ask for a better location for this price. Plenty of great restaurants minutes away. Walking downtown wasn't really too much of a chore either, if you want to save a few bucks on a cab. And the rooftop view of the skyline and space needle (which is about 3 short blocks away) is really incredible. Definitely worth it to check out a sunset or two from up there staring at the mountains across the water. The house itself was ok. Nothing extravagant but not a slum by any means. Dan was pretty nice the couple times we saw her, but we were out staying busy pretty much all day. Would definitely recommend."
8503720,49934503,2015-10-07,5425358,Travis,Great apt in Queen Anne. Dan was welcoming and very accommodating when I had to move dates and had late check in time. Dan was friendly and nice.

8503720,52416762,2015-10-29,44361158,Gabrielle,"We had a great time on our overnight trip to Seattle. Dan Li was very responsive and answered all my questions - so getting settled was easy and comfortable. We had private space in her condo and she was very respectful and thoughtful. We were going to a concert at the Key Arena, and the location could not have been better - she's a block and a half away. The building is safe and secure and the whole experience was great. This is a great home base for exploring the city or attending events. "
8503720,53479876,2015-11-09,18469660,Peter,"Dan was a superb host. We very much enjoyed our stay. Location is dead central, 5min walk from the Space needle and the not-to-be-missed music museum. Would definitely stay here again!"
8503720,56206091,2015-12-10,28567175,Ria,Dan was very lovely and flexible.  The condo is in the heart of Seattle and we had a great stay!
8503720,56414629,2015-12-13,49807669,Drake,Great place to stay. Close walk to most of Seattle's main attractions. No issues! I would recommend for anyone.
8503720,56610877,2015-12-15,48947542,Brittany,The location and view were incredible! Very comfy. Dan is very sweet and welcoming and willing to go out of her way for guests. Definitely a great stay!
492287,1407506,2012-06-03,2471697,Norma,"My husband and I were welcomed to the ""Birdhouse"" in May 2012 by Robert, who is a very gracious host and his friendly dog and cat. He makes a wonderful espresso which I enjoyed in the restful backyard.
The house is tastefully decorated and inviting. The private guest room and bath are clean and pleasant.  The bed and linens are super comfy.  I slept great.
Upon arrival, we sat down with Robert, shared a glass on wine and chatted about the house, our expected schedules, and the local area.
The neighborhood and nearby Discovery Park are beautiful.  Bring your walking shoes to enjoy the park.
The best references that can be given is to say that I would stay here again.  A very good first airbnb experience."
492287,1500015,2012-06-17,2458736,Michael,"My stay at Seattle's Discovery 'Birdhouse' was delightful.  I happened to hit the weather perfectly with sunshine and blue sky, which is a real treat for visiting Seattle.  So I took advantage of it by going for a fantasictic walk in Discovery Park (one block away) with views of the harbor and the beautiful Olympic Mountain Range beyond.

Rob was a wonderful host who's warmth and generosity made me feel right at home.  The accommodations  were quite suitable for my needs and I would be happy to stay there if I was ever visiting Seattle again, rain or shine."
492287,1513076,2012-06-18,181237,Daniela,"Robert was the perfect host -- welcoming but unobtrusive. His home is peaceful and quiet, tastefully decorated, and immaculate. We had just arrived in Seattle after a cross-country road trip starting in New York, and were so relieved to find this perfect, cozy place to stay. Unfortunately we did not get a chance to sample Robert's cooking, because we had to leave first thing in the morning. But we hope to do so next time we are in Seattle! I couldn't recommend the Birdhouse more enthusiastically. "
492287,1552182,2012-06-24,2205492,Diana,"Jason and I stayed at Seattle Discovery Birdhouse on 6/22/12 - our second experience in one week with an Airbnb host. We made our reservation 4 days in advance at the beginning of our vacation week, and truly appreciated Robert’s quick response, his detailed description of the place, and the fact that his availability calendar was current! That was especially helpful since we were enroute to Canada and needed to make arrangements for our trip home. Robert was responsive via email and text and flexible with our arrival schedule. 

Had the weather been a bit better that evening, we might have taken advantage of the truly lovely backyard patio and hot tub. Instead, we took Robert’s advice on places to eat, and visited 3 of them in the one night! No, we did not eat full meals at all of them, but instead shared an appetizer or small meal.  The house was very clean and tastefully decorated, the bed quite comfortable (and I do have trouble finding comfortable beds) and the bedroom quiet. We heard no road noise in the quiet neighborhood, so we slept well - far different than we would have slept at a Best Western, indeed! We appreciated the sense of privacy. Although our bathroom was not in our room, it was adjacent; and the host’s room was across the house. 
The next morning, we were treated to a fabulous paleo breakfast, at my request, which was such a treat after a week of traveling. Robert is an excellent chef, friendly and enjoyable to visit with. After breakfast we rode our bikes to Discovery Park, two blocks from the Birdhouse, for a long ride around the park to the beach and back - all before the rain started up again. In all we had a lovely stay with a gracious host. We will definitely put Seattle Discovery Birdhouse on our Airbnb favorites list! Thank you, Robert. - D&J"
492287,1564192,2012-06-25,1150674,David,"Robert was a great host, with a beautiful home and two lovely pets. We're dog and cat lovers so this was really the perfect place for us. We were also exhausted from a week of travel, work and play, and we spent the whole night there playing with the pets and chatting with Robert. He was also very gracious when we brought our parents over to relax and regroup after their cruise returned, before we all headed out to the city. Definitely a highlight of our Seattle experience!"
492287,1704848,2012-07-14,2600522,Édelis,"We had an amazing experience at the Birdhouse! The house itself is very pleasant, comfortable and inviting, and very beautiful as well. Robert has a very interesting collection of artistic and cultural samples of all around the world – music, architecture, art, books… Also, Cooper and Kowalski are the most lovely pets! We felt in love with them! Even the mattress, that we were concerned about due to health issues, are very, very comfortable, so we had wonderful nights and woke up ready to full-time tourism days! Robert and Hannah, his daughter, are amazing hosts, very kind, very polite, caring for providing us the feeling of being home. We went to Seattle for both tourism and a Conference, and several things happened that could have compromised some of our time for tourism, but we end up having no problem because Robert helped us to solve them in advance, for example receiving a battery pack for my notebook days before we arrive. Robert also helped us to improve our English language and expressions for our presentations. He and Hannah are very special persons. The only sad part of our travel was to say goodbye…"
492287,1713842,2012-07-15,2812784,Luke,"Robert was a great host to my dad, brother and I while we were passing through Seattle for a bike trip. He was extremely quick to respond to any questions I had, was very accommodating, and even woke up at 5:00 AM to make us a great breakfast before the ride.

You couldn't ask for a better host or a better place to stay."
492287,1773476,2012-07-22,1264546,Michael,"Robert was an excellent host. He was very accommodating with my last minute, hectic schedule and a really friendly guy. The house was beautiful, clean, and in a great location right next to the scenic Discovery  Park. I had a great time with Robert and his adorable pets. Wish I could have stayed longer!"
492287,1792578,2012-07-24,2494549,Judy,"We enjoyed our brief stay at the Seattle Discovery Birdhouse and appreciated so much Robert's hospitality and flexibility with an unforeseen complication in our arrival time. We were enroute to Whistler, BC and in our rush to get packed accidentally left our passports at home in Lake Oswego, OR. We only discovered this oversight after arriving by car in Seattle and we had to meet a flight at the Vancouver BC Airport the next day at 2 pm.
 We had reservations to see the King Tut show that afternoon at the Seattle Science Center. We called Robert and explained our predicament (after the King Tut show) at 6 pm that our only option was to drive back 180 miles to Lake Oswego, get the passports and get back to Seattle to check in at midnight at Robert's place. He kindly gave us instructions for letting ourselves into our accommodation at midnight -- after our 300+ round trip to retrieve passports at our house in Oregon.
We were so happy  with our stay at the Discovery Birdhouse with Robert (and his friendly cat, Kowalski, and his St. Charles Spaniel) that we immediately decided to make a reservation for another stay on our return trip from British Columbia. 
Thank you, Robert, for making a stressful event less so.
Judy and Jack"
492287,1804251,2012-07-26,2545690,Jacqueline,"After a 10 hour flight we arrived in Seattle, had to go through customs, pick up our rental car and then drove to the Birdhouse. This was our first airbnb experience and it was a good one. Robert is very welcoming and well-grounded. He is very informed about places to visit or see, so we got tips for our trip that were very valuable. Not only for Seattle but also for other places we wanted to visit on our trip from Seattle to San Francisco. We had a private bedroom and bathroom and our daughter slept on the sofa in the livingroom. She liked Cooper the dog and Kowalski and they kept her company at night. Robert prepared a wonderful breakfast, he even bought some Dutch cheese. The birdhouse is in a very nice area of Seattle with steep hills and terrific views. The area is very quiet and we felt very safe there. The garden is well-kept and great to sit and relax. You can reach downtown (Pike Place Market) in about 15 minutes and it's a very easy drive. We were so glad we choose airbnb instead of a impersonal hotel. "
492287,2041569,2012-08-20,969047,Michelle,"Robert made us feel very welcome in his home.  Although the Birdhouse is a shared place,  it still felt private.  I felt welcome and comfortable.  It was nice to share the space with his wonderful dog and cat."
492287,2105319,2012-08-26,3301286,Alexander,"Robert has a beautiful home in one of the nicest parts of Seattle. While we were staying with him, he graciously provided us with the best breakfasts that I've had in a very long time - this man knows where to get his fruit! His dog and cat were very affectionate, and a continuous source of entertainment for us. Rob's place is a great place to stay. We were very impressed."
492287,2120659,2012-08-27,881162,Randy,"Good clean room, private bath and warm hospitality."
492287,2155829,2012-08-31,1180953,Orlin,You can't beat the location: it has both of two worlds--the charming hiking area with beautiful vistas and a short drive to the city. The place was clean and comfortable. You have to meet those two pets that have pleasant personalities. Robert was a helpful host. We would highly recommend this place. Orlin&vasanta
492287,2193137,2012-09-04,2996255,Corey,"Robert was a great host! He made us feel welcome in his home and even had breakfast available for us both mornings. The location of his house was perfect for our trip. We really enjoyed our walk in discovery park, which was a block from his house. "
492287,2336834,2012-09-18,3290797,Jean Paul,We had a great experience at the birdhouse. Robert was a good host  and has a very comfortable house.  A nice neighborhood close to the city.  
492287,2393963,2012-09-24,3344115,Saul,"My wife and I had an enjoyable stay at the Birdhouse in September.  The home is lovely, and well kept.  Location is excellent, right near a large  park, and close to downtown (20 minutes by bus).  Robert is very cordial and was helpful with recommendations for restaurants, places of interest, and directions. "
492287,2625987,2012-10-15,3286820,Vic,"Oh, where to start... Robert, his dog Cooper and cat Kowalski are the most welcoming trio I've met so far via Airbnb!! From the first time we met to the very end of our stay Robert was helpful, suggestive, appropriately inquisitive (which made for great conversations), a GREAT cook, and vastly knowledgeable of jazz and other types of music. All those qualities plus his attention to detail came together so that we could have  a pleasant and relaxing stay in his home. The location of the Birdhouse is in a prime location minutes from the Discovery Park and other attractions in Seattle. The exterior of the house is breathtaking and the interior is equally taken care of and above all very clean. The private room and bathroom are conveniently right next to each other and the pull out bed has a comfortable easy to blow up air mattress. Breakfast cooked by Robert on our first morning was delicious and just when i thought it couldn't get better Robert filled the living room area with the most relaxing sounds of Jazz and other world music that he played at the most appropriate times and volume level. Hence, I, without reservation, recommend that you consider staying at Robert's Seattle Discovery Birdhouse.

Thank You Robert and hope to see you soon. "
492287,2896582,2012-11-16,2471697,Norma,"I said in my first review of the ""Birdhouse"" in May 2012 that I would stay again.  And I did!  Just left this morning (Nov 2012).  Again a very pleasant stay with a friendly welcome from Robert, Copper the dog and Kowalski the cat.  Our (husband and myself) schedule was demanding, as is the schedule of grandparents determined to bond with and begin the spoiling process of a new granddaughter, so we only slept and showered at the ""birdhouse"". And missed the shared glass of wine with Robert.  Next time.
The shared house is private and the bed is so comfortable. I slept so well after coming in from the 2am feeding.  He has provided some nice amenities in the room: chocolates, water glasses, (Seattle has great water), plenty of suitcase stands.
The birds visiting the front and back yard are fascinating and Robert is ready to identify them and provide info on plants that attract the birds.
The neighborhood is peaceful and relaxed.  I wonder if there is a house for sale down the street...?  No, I'll just stay with Robert again."
492287,2961993,2012-11-25,75605,Steve,"Robert has created an beautifully detailed home where Agnieszka and I felt very welcome.  He is an engaging, gracious and thoughtful host who is really at ease in caring for others.   

In the midst of a working on an intense art project in Seattle, our stay with Robert was a respite.  I look forward to keeping touch with him (and his entertaining pets...)"
492287,3070838,2012-12-11,13139,Mike,Rob is a great  host! His place has a great ambiance that is really pleasant and inviting. The room you rent is like a cabana and has a sense of being very relaxing. the house is very cozy and well decorated on the inside and landscaped on the outside. Great guides await you beside  your bed in your room. The bathroom is a step into the 40's w original tile from when the hosue was constructed. Magnolia is a pleasant village like neighborhood and it is safe and convenient. Rob is highly intelligent and very knowledgable. The  Birdhouse is a great choice for a stay in seattle.
492287,3167154,2012-12-27,191444,Tuan,"Robert was a truly thoughtful and caring host who made us feel like staying at home, especially when we visited during Christmas time. We were provided with all the necessary amenities in the birdhouse plus the serenity of a quiet, clean, and safe neighborhood. Since we went out all day almost every day, we did not get to enjoy Robert's highly praised cooking talent, but at least we got plenty of play time with Cooper the dog and Kowalski the kitty. They were the most social and fun-loving animals we've ever met, keeping us company 24/7. We miss them a lot after we left, so hopefully next time we're in Seattle we'll be able to reserve our stay again with Robert. On top of everything nice and cozy, he got us some adorable Christmas gifts as well. It's hard not to want to come back!"
492287,3312973,2013-01-08,4548514,Dustin,"Our stay at the Discovery Birdhouse was great. We loved the location because it was easy to get to neighborhoods like Fremont and Ballard and easy to get downtown as well. We spent our last day hiking around in Discovery Park, which is right next to the house. 

As for the house, it is very comfortable, especially the bed. The bedroom is a bit small, but the bed is very comfy. Robert was very welcoming and helpful. He recommended an excellent restaurant near Jazz Alley. We loved his sweet pets and we enjoyed the music he played. Overall, I heartily recommend it."
492287,3478068,2013-02-04,1292189,Marie,"Robert was an excellent host to my niece and I! Very kind and lovely attention to detail. The room was quaint, and the bed comfortable and the house quiet. We opted to have breakfast made by him, which was a perfect choice. Tasty and covered all the bases... and mind you I like breakfast! He also gave us some very helpful recommendations of other places to check out for food and shopping. The location is easy to get to, very near Magnolia park with some of the most beautiful views of the puget sound you can get in Seattle. The ""boys"" - Cooper and Kowalski were adorable, fun and very respectful. I will happily stay there again and recommend it highly!"
492287,3601792,2013-02-22,904715,Jennifer,"Robert is a fantastic host.  He is very thoughtful and gracious.  We were supplied with delicious fruit to go along with our breakfasts.  Our host searched his music library to find music to suit our wants which helped make the fruit all the more tantalizing to our taste buds.  The man was never in our way, but was always available to help us.  Kowalski and Cooper lent their own loving ways to our stay which helped us feel right at home. "
492287,3845882,2013-03-20,501945,Alvin,"The birdhouse looks exactly like in the picture! It is nice, clean, and homey. I personally love the backyard ( it is so gorgeous) The location is perfect, it's really close to Seattle Center.
Too bad I didn't spend much time at the house, I had to meet friends. However, Rob is a great host, very respectful and friendly.. If you're looking a place to stay that is close to downtown Seattle, I highly recommend to stay at the birdhouse!"
492287,4047754,2013-04-05,5591531,Marianne,"loved the Birdhouse! the view driving down Magnolia  to downtown Seattle was so pretty.
 Host was friendly but unobtrusive; kitchen very compact and well equipped. Pets were quiet and friendly.  I would definitely stay here again!"
492287,4621051,2013-05-16,481222,Sandy,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Robert 's beautiful 'birdhouse'. The bed was comfy & warm. Robert was the perfect host giving us many tips on how to fully enjoy our 4 days in Seattle. He even drove us to the beginning of a beautiful walking trail. The neighborhood is very safe & upscale. An easy, short distance from downtown on bus #24. We enjoyed relaxing in Robert's backyard - he even has an outdoor jacuzzi! Plus he has two charmingly adorable pets - Cooper & Kowalski - who welcome you as part of the family. We would definately stay here again."
492287,4848149,2013-05-28,1571995,Susie,"Robert was an enthusiastic host, who provided not only a very clean but comfortable place to rest.  He was quick to share what he loves about the area and easy going to let us take his maps with us on our outings.  We enjoyed that he had lovable pets and we would definitely recommend his place to stay!  We will probably return ourselves someday for another trip to Seattle and would love to stay with him again.  His home is very close to downtown Seattle and a block from Discovery Park which is amazing. We loved not being in hotel and feeling like tourists....we got to have that neighborhood feel and loved coming back to a home and not a busy hotel."
492287,4895386,2013-05-31,6549291,Mari,"Robert is a pretty gentle man, also his companies, Cooper(dog)&Kowalski(cat) are totally cute& friendly! I felt as if I was in my house. I slept next to Cooper&Kowalski, enjoyed drinking japanese beer with Robert , walk at Discovery park with Cooper, talked about japanese budo, aikido etc. I'd stayed there for just only 3 days , so I wanted to be with them more timeX) He advised me some places for sightseeing. It was very helpful, so I really enjoyed seattle. If you like animals & hope kind & friendly host, I recommend this""BIRDHOUSE""!"
492287,5152283,2013-06-15,600627,Petra,"It was a pleasure to stay at the 'birdhouse'. Robert is an excellent host who takes great care of his surroundings and gives you detailed descriptions of different neighborhoods when asked :) his animal 'companions' are entertaining and open minded as well. Beautiful, quiet surroundings come w easy access to other areas of Seattle. Thank You, Robert, Cooper and Kowalski.
A bientot!"
492287,5319457,2013-06-24,1335870,Nikos,"I stayed in the birdhouse in June 2013 with my 9, 14, and 17 year-old kids.  Two of us got the (comfy) bed in the private bedroom, two of us were on the pull-out couch in the living room.  Even though the two on the couch were really right in the middle of things, they were able to sleep in, and Robert gave us appropriate privacy during the stay.  

He was a friendly and engaging host, and had provided an assortment host of tourist brochures and details on the house.  The house itself is on a quiet residential street, a half a block from Discovery Park.  We went there twice, and walked the 2.8 mile loop trail and the shorter (but hilly) South Beach Trail.  

The house features a very friendly small dog and cat.  My kids enjoyed playing with them."
492287,5586458,2013-07-07,6946893,Ryan,"We had a great time in Seattle.
Rob is a great guy and gave us really good suggestions.  He was helpful and very accomodating.
If you like animals - he has 2 great pets.  Both very friendly and affectionate.
His house is right next to discovery park and we enjoyed runs in the morning with views of the Puget sounds.  
We had a car so did not have to worry about access and found getting around Seattle fairly easy.
We enjoyed our stay and will most probably visit again the next time we are in Seattle"
492287,5674575,2013-07-11,580204,Becky,"My mom & two boys stayed at the birdhouse with Robert & I can't say enough good things about the house & Robert as our host!! He was SO pleasant & Full of good info about Seattle & the nearby Discovery park. His house was comfortable & very clean & his dog & cat for us made it all the more comfortable. 
Magnolia is a beautiful neighborhood & easily accessible via bus, car, foot & bicycle. 
You would be lucky to get to stay at the Birdhouse!!"
492287,5972533,2013-07-24,4366942,Nan,"Clean house and room.  15 minutes from any cool neighborhood--so, be sure to have a car!  Good coffee in the morning.  Host works/lives at home.  Good if you're coming to crash and have a clean bedroom and  bathroom."
492287,6254741,2013-08-05,7588107,Beverly,Thanks Rob for the lovely and peaceful stay at the Birdhouse! Great location within walking distance of a most beautiful park and a very comfortable bed. Almost didn't want to go home. 
492287,6340133,2013-08-09,3394180,Michelle,"We enjoyed our stay in the Birdhouse, which was located in a quiet neighborhood, just near Discovery Park. Robert gave us a lot of privacy and we felt very comfortable in the house. Breakfast things were always ready on the table in the morning, which was very nice. The cat and the dog were very playful and kept us company when we were in the house. Overall it was a great experience and we would recommend staying there if you are looking for a safe and comfortable place to stay, well located to visit downtown and other neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont. "
492287,6673555,2013-08-20,8059413,Michael&Amy,"We stayed at The Birdhouse for three nights and were absolutely comfortable the whole time. The host is extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Offers breakfast, love from his two well behaved pets, a glorious and peaceful backyard, beautiful Discovery park right next door, and an AMAZING digital music collection + surround sound. Very inspiring stay for an artist but also cozy for couples :] Will return for sure! "
492287,7015371,2013-09-03,6978652,Rob,"We received a very warm welcome, from the host and his pets both. Robert is knowledgeable about the city and has one of the nicest, well behaved dogs I've ever met, excessive licking not withstanding. :)

The room is super-clean and in a very very quiet location, only the occasional airplane overhead and cat mewling at the door disturbed our sleep, there is no street noise at all. I highly recommend staying here if you want to enjoy Seattle while still being able to escape to a quiet sanctuary at the end of a hectic day running around town.

One thing to keep in mind is that this room is at the very north end of Magnolia, so it's good to memorize how to quickly get in and out of the area or else you'll get lost wandering steep hills and cobblestone alleys for hours, nothing a quick map search won't help. 

A great place to stay, hands down."
492287,7104453,2013-09-06,7309482,James,"We loved the Birdhouse. The room is very comfortable, the private bathroom is great, the hot tub is a big, big plus, and Robert is really friendly and helpful. Wonderful cold breakfasts included in the price. Robert clearly enjoys hosting guests and was great just to chat to. And his animals are about the cutest things imaginable! "
492287,7350374,2013-09-16,8659045,Michael,"This was the first time that I booked a room via airbnb and everything worked well. Because of the pictures of the birdhouse, the positive reviews and the location I wrote a request to Robert - who responded already after minutes.

Communication with Robert via email, text messages and phone was good and all necessary information were available. It didn't work out to meet each other but access to the house was organized at the time of arrival and everything looked like shown on the pictures. The cute cat gave me a warm welcome and it was a pleasure to give her a scoop of food in the morning and the evening :) 

The garden of the Birdhouse is wonderful, the house clean and the bed is very comfortable. Private bathroom is next to the bedroom and a hot tub in the back yard ... which was broken at the time of my stay - since a spare part for repair did not arrive on time - wasn't a problem for me.  

Parking on the road in front of the house is also not a problem - enough space available. The birdhouse is located next to Discovery Park (great hiking to light house) in a wonderful area north west of Seattle down town. Very quite at night - no street noise ... only the meowing cat in front of the door woke me up once. 

Drive to downtown took me approximately 10-15 minutes and the Magnolia Blvd offers nice views to the ocean and downtown.

Long story short - Robert is a great host and communication worked perfect. If you are looking for a quite room in reachable distance to Seattle downtown - this is the place to stay.

492287,8121812,2013-10-16,6416529,Larissa,"We really enjoyed our stay with Robert.  His place is in a lovely neighborhood, and is very nicely furnished.  It was a very relaxing setting, and yet a quick 10-15 min drive into downtown or other nearby shopping areas.  Robert was very pleasant to communicate with, and had a number of helpful Seattle area magazines, maps of walking tours, etc.  His cat and dog were very friendly, and we enjoyed listening to his extensive music collection. "
492287,8952130,2013-11-27,6628468,David,"I stayed at Rob's classy home for 2 nights and it was a very easy and fun experience.  Rob is a friendly host with a ton of info about the area.
The bed and pillow were much better than I have at home.
I would not hesitate to rent from him again.  Highly recommend."
492287,13461625,2014-05-27,1117548,Mike,Had a great stay with Robert in his beautiful house! Robert was kind enough to accept our request when we had a last minute change of plans with our trip. We enjoyed the breakfast he provided each morning as well as his two friendly pets. He was a great host who provided excellent advice on places to visit and places to get great seafood!
492287,14141537,2014-06-12,15915697,Candace,Rob was super friendly and accommodating when we booked last minute and it was extremely nice and comfortable to stay at his place for two nights. The breakfast is really good and his neighborhood is quiet but close to Discovery Park and isn't too far from downtown. This was my first experience at Airbnb and Rob made it a very good one! ️ 
492287,14215527,2014-06-14,10079944,Bob,Robert was a great host and his place was comfortable and immaculately cared for. The front and rear gardens are beautiful and I wish I could have taken advantage of the tub in warmer weather.  Robert provided a nice continental breakfast with yogurt and fruit. The neighborhood is great and close to Ballard Locks and the Botanical Gardens. Cooper the 'guard' dog was a sweet companion.  Thanks again Robert.  
492287,14583623,2014-06-22,1812747,Dana,"We had a fantastic stay at the Birdhouse! It is right next to gorgeous Discovery Park, where we took beautiful sunset walks. Both the pull-out couch and the bedroom were very comfy and Robert provided us with ample privacy. We spent sunny mornings on the back patio with the cutest pup in the world and at night soaked our bike-weary bones in the hot tub! Robert provided us with delicious coffee and breakfast in the morning and was an incredibly gracious host. "
492287,14800021,2014-06-26,14978729,Nancy,Bob was an excellent host.  His home is lovely.  The garden area is a wonderful space for outside dining. 
492287,14933325,2014-06-29,8731686,Ben,"Robert was a wonderful host. The moment my family and I stepped foot into his home, he welcomed us with unbelievable hospitality. Throughout our stay, he offered recommendations on parks, restaurants, and site seeing locations. As first time tourists in Seattle, he helped us navigate the city and explore some hidden gems. He even went out of his way to lead us to a charming a hiking trail close by the neighborhood. Every morning we woke up to the smell of toast and freshly brewed coffee. If you have any hesitations on where to stay, look no further than Robert's home. "
492287,15697255,2014-07-14,8963043,Salena,"I would highly recommend the Birdhouse to anyone looking for a welcoming and serene stay while in Seattle. Robert and his family of pets were warm and gracious hosts. The location is perfect; close to everything by car, great biking and walking right out the door, but quiet and peaceful at night. Really enjoyed our daily fresh fruit and coffee for breakfast, and evening jazz music. "
492287,15972691,2014-07-19,6122248,Meg,Thank you we felt very welcome in your home.
492287,16056451,2014-07-21,12653953,Alexander,"Robert's hospitality was outstanding, and we had a fantastic time during our 2 night stay. The room and house is very colorful and welcoming, the pets very friendly and charming.

The Birdhouse enjoys a wonderfully serene neighborhood, very quiet yet with some car2go rental availability. The hot tub feels great after a long day, and Robert pointed us towards great nearby restaurants. This proved an ideal getaway for me and the missus, and I highly recommend it!"
492287,16357300,2014-07-26,13382710,Lois,"Robert is a wonderful host.  Everything met our expectations - the home is charming, the garden is lovely.  Hannah, his daughter was helpful and friendly.  Even the sweet dog and kitty seemed clued in to making this Airbnb work well.  We also loved the Magnolia district and nearby park,
Thanks to everyone,  this was a great 5 day stay!
"
492287,16564908,2014-07-29,8006208,Laura,"Robert was a great host, taking the time to give us information about the city (we had never visited Seattle before) while also giving us our own space while we were there.  The description provided on Airbnb was accurate and his expectations and rules were clear, reasonable, and easy to follow.  His cat and dog, Cooper, were both welcoming and friendly – not a nuisance at all.  The two rooms were clean and comfortable and Robert even had a pullout couch in the living room for an additional guest who joined us on the last evening we stayed there.  His fantastic location near Discovery Park was a huge bonus as well.  Overall, we had a very pleasant stay in Robert’s beautiful home and wouldn’t hesitate to stay there again! "
492287,16991079,2014-08-05,14402145,Lawrence,"Rob and his menagerie were very welcoming hosts.  Our teenaged daughters loved playing with the very friendly cat and dogs (Rob was boarding a neighbor's dog during our stay, which was no trouble to us at all).  We especially appreciated the great breakfasts and the evening relaxation in the hot tub after a long day of visiting Seattle.  It's an easy bus ride into town and the location, on a quiet street in a subdued neighborhood, provided restful sleep.  Thanks so much!"
492287,17213840,2014-08-09,17178530,Claudine,"Upon arrival, we found we were staying in a charming house, in a great neighborhood.  The host family,  Rob, his dog Cooper and Kitty the cat, couldn't have been more welcoming.  Our rooms and bath were private and every morning we were treated to great coffee, fresh fruit and various breads, jams and other good things.  Being next to Discovery Park was an added bonus.  Wonderful walks, hikes just outside your doorstep.  We highly recommend staying here and hope to come back someday.  Many thanks."
492287,17455705,2014-08-12,17122819,Edward,"My stay at the Birdhouse was my first experience with airbnb and Robert has set my standards high. He made us feel very welcome.

The rooms, bathroom and kitchen were good. Robert was available when you needed him and gave some really good advice on moving around in Seattle (locks/one bus away), things to do, restaurants and pubs. The dog and cat were just as Robert, laid back and social. 

Location is good, well reachable by bus and a good quiet neighboorhood close to the wonderful Ballard and Freemont.

His communication by email was informative and on time. All in all we (my friend and I) were very happy with our stay and enjoyed the conversations with Robert on Seattle and lots of other things.

"
492287,17567869,2014-08-14,17271357,Diana,"We were excited to stay at Robert's house on the last couple days of a family vacation. The house was well cared for, Robert was very helpful and we enjoyed the neighborhood, taking advantage of nearby Discovery Park and the Ballard Locks. 

The one disappointment was that we were expecting two rooms, one for the grownups and one for our seven-year old but found out the day before our arrival that the second room was already occupied. Our choice was to squeeze all three people into a small bedroom or make use of a pullout sofa in the living room. We chose the sofa but it wasn’t the restful, private sleep we had hoped for.
"
492287,17686632,2014-08-16,3150071,Andreas,Robert was very helpful. Two of us had to sleep in the sitting-room. The couch was large and comfortable but the sitting-room is a walk-through room. So actually for four people it's not so good - for two it is great.
492287,18363058,2014-08-25,2407964,Marya,"Robert was charming and welcomed us to his pretty home in Magnolia. It's small but cute with a lovely backyard we had breakfast in. Low-key breakfasts of yogurt, fruit, and toast. Comfortable bed. We would go back! 

His pets are also very sweet especially the friendly, portly cat."
492287,18673741,2014-08-30,6126470,Nicolas,"What a nice stay in Seattle! Everything was great and perfectly conformed.
The house and location were very convenient. Quiet and well connected to go downtown.
Thanks Robert for your welcome. It was a pleasure meeting you. We appreciated your availability and advices.
What about the breakfast…eating outside everyday under the sun was just perfect.
"
492287,18825742,2014-09-01,4648588,Rachel,"This is a lovely spot in a quiet residential neighborhood, and is perfect for two people staying in the private room. Robert knows the area well and is full of great tips, and there's a fresh breakfast  of fruit (sliced papaya and local apples when we were there), coffee, tea, bread and spreads...all beautifully laid out on the best ceramic ware. The back garden is absolutely lovely, and I only wish it wasn't raining!

The neighborhood is about 15-20 minutes out of Seattle, but it's a ""real"" neighborhood, and right along the water and near a great park (we were in town for a wedding at said park). 

The private room is compact but well equipped, the bathroom is right next door to the private room, and Robert's room is on the other side of the house, through the living room. There was an exchange student staying there in the same ""wing"" in another private room when we were there, just to note that there is another guest in the house. He was super respectful and we barely noticed him, but just to note. 



"
492287,21627137,2014-10-20,20784404,Kadi,"Robert is a great easy going host.  The property is beautifully landscaped, private and well kept... hot tub, wonderful!  The printed out house rules are straightforward and clear.  Birdhouse is on a quiet residential street.  We would certainly stay again when we're in Seattle next."
492287,40008818,2015-07-27,32301291,Julia,"Robert was hospitable and wonderful with local recommendations and directions. His home is lovely and relaxing, with a great back patio."
492287,40985502,2015-08-03,12258268,John,"This was my first Airbnb.  Robert was a great host - quick to respond to all my inquiries, provided helpful suggestions for exploring the neighborhood, and was welcoming and friendly.  The accomodations were clean, private, comfortable and quiet.  The backyard is lovely - great place for breakfast (Robert provided coffee, toast, yogurt and fruit - it was very nice).  The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood and is one block from Discovery Park, which provides trails and beach walks.  It's also possible to walk to Ballard for excellent dining and shopping.   I was on foot and public transportation was easy to negotiate from the airport.  I only spent one night, so had limited opportunities to explore, but I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. "
492287,41452841,2015-08-07,2824978,Matthew,Robert's place was a great stopover. We ended up arriving later in the evening but everything was all set up for us. As we were heading out he greeted us and gave us some suggestions for the nearby park that were very helpful. I would recommend booking with him. 
492287,46712097,2015-09-13,34100372,Ron,"Among the plentiful birds we encountered at the huge & diverse park down the street from the Birdhouse lurked only one ""boo-bird"": the leaking air mattress that was our bed.  

The host (Robert) could not be more accommodating or considerate, going out of his way to ensure that everything was just right and that communication  was always available.  The home is stylish and inviting: we felt like we were at home.

If you are considering a visit to the Emerald City, I would absolutely recommend the Birdhouse as a ""home base"" for day trips ranging from Tacoma to Snoqualmie Pass to Bellingham!"
492287,47751825,2015-09-21,40324422,Keri,"We really enjoyed our stay.  Robert was very polite and incredibly respectful of our space, not only in the personal space provided but also in the common areas if we were using them.  He made us coffee every morning and put out fresh fruit (which in our case was pineapple that was amazing!), english muffins (or bread of some sort), peanut butter, butter and delicious raspberry preserves!  The bus stop was not too far, nor was the ride to downtown to Seattle.  The hot tub was a great bonus as well.   "
492287,50580428,2015-10-12,4811291,Peter,"The ""Birdhouse""....cozy and comfortable, nothing fancy.
Robert is a courteous, attentive and responsible host. He said he would be available at any time to acquaint us with the house, and he was. Accommodation is in the spare bedroom of a family house. It is a small room, and shares a bathroom with the daughter of the house, who still lives there. A double inflatable bed takes up 85% of the room; space would be too tight for a couple. As I was on my own, it worked out.
There is no TV in the room. The room and the house were very clean, clean towels in the bathroom. Robert hosts a continental breakfast every morning for the guest/s, usually accompanied by his charming red-haired tabby cat, and a sweet King Charles Spaniel who get on perfectly together."
492287,55200886,2015-11-29,44786542,Judith,"The Birdhouse is the most delightful retreat, and our host Robert is a very interesting man.  My husband enjoyed many conversations with him.  The location in Magnolia is perfect for accessing all the attractions around Magnolia, with easy access downtown.  Our room was very comfortable and all provisions for our stay were available.  Our little dog made a new friend in Cooper, Robert's King Charles spaniel, and a friendly darling dog.  "

6561379,36299274,2015-06-27,24716983,Bill,"Our stay at the Alamo house was exceptional! The house is in a cute neighborhood really close to downtown Seattle. I think our Uber ride was less than 10 dollars. There are restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a grocery store within walking distance. There is also a huge park right across the street that our dogs loved. The house itself is really nicely decorated with really eclectic and interesting art work on the walls. There is a nice computer available to use, a huge projector screen and a sound system that plays throughout the house. It truly exceeded all of my expectations. 

Colin the host was wonderful. We had a few questions during our week long stay and he was always quick to respond. We even had a little emergency, I locked the keys in the house and Colin responded right away even though he was traveling and it was 4 or 5 am where he was when I messaged him. It really kind of felt like I was staying at a friend's house who was out of town, that's how comfortable it was. Two thumbs up, 5 stars, it was fantastic!"
6561379,36701018,2015-06-30,88350,Jason,This location was terrific home base for my friends and I to explore seattle. Across the street is a huge park and its really close to the international district where we hung out the most.
6561379,37195629,2015-07-05,97274,Hester,The house is spacious. The location is great for us (between SEA airport and Seattle city). The neighborhood seems fine.   We have no difficult at all settled in for a few days. We specially love the projector. 
6561379,37864356,2015-07-11,25613490,Radika,"Colin's Beacon Hill house was a wonderful place and we really enjoyed our time there. It is so far the best AirBB that i have had in Seattle!!  We stayed for 6 nights at his very cozy 2 br house by the Jefferson Park. The house had a great outdoor patio and a very nice kitchen. we also really enjoyed the living room filled with lots of arts and plants- from the moment we stepped in the house had a very welcoming feeling to it and we felt like home for the rest of our stay. The house was just a bus ride from down town and was a really easy commute. 
             Colin was really easy to communicate with and he checked in with us regularly to see whether our stay is going smooth. During our stay Colin was out of the country but still he replied to our emails very fast.  I very highly recommend Colin's place for your stay in Seattle and i would certainly stay here again."
6561379,38399770,2015-07-15,31167243,Melanie,"Colin is an awesome host! Quick booking and appropriate amount of open communication before and during my stay even though he was out of town/just returning. My friends and I enjoyed the house - interesting ""Southwest traveler"" vibe from the decor and furnishings, there's a great projector screen setup, and it's very spacious. Just down the street there's the bus line that goes straight to Downtown as well as some cafes and restaurants. Felt like a home away from home! Hoping I can stay here again next time I'm in town. Definitely recommend."
6561379,38852097,2015-07-19,24767792,Shanina,"We spent three nights at Colin's beautiful home in Beacon Hill and the experience far exceeded our expectations. 

It's in a fantastic location across from Jefferson Park, with quick access to the interstate and downtown Seattle. We enjoyed the eclectic mix of artwork throughout the home, the beautiful patio and outdoor space, as well as the projector screen and sound system. 

Despite being out of town, Colin was very easy to communicate with and responded to all messages quickly, checking in with us frequently to make sure our stay was going well. 

Would absolutely love to stay at this place again and highly recommend it! Thanks for a wonderful stay and sharing your beautiful home, Colin. "
6561379,39294731,2015-07-22,7474105,Cathy,"The location of the Beacon Hill house was wonderful.  It was an easy walk to get to the metro and there is a wonderful park across the street.  The beds were comfortable and we loved the projector.  Colin was a great host 
"
6561379,39936950,2015-07-27,30230148,Chris,Colin was so hospitable and easy to work with. My family had a great stay during our wedding weekend and Colin's place was quaint oasis in the city. Thanks again! 
6561379,40335701,2015-07-30,12164582,Diana,"We loved this home! The house was very comfy, had everything we needed, and was well decorated. The house is across the street from Jefferson Park which is a great place for a picnic. Colin made everything easy for us and made sure we were taken care of. We definitely recommend his home."
6561379,44561088,2015-08-27,39737536,Lesly,"My family and I enjoyed our stay at Colin's Beacon Hill home! The house is beautifully decorated, super comfortable and located very close to Downtown Seattle. Colin was a wonderful host and checked in on us often to make sure we enjoying our stay. Definitely consider this place if you're in the city. Thank you Colin!"
6561379,45076370,2015-08-31,35247229,Vishal,"Colin has been an excellent host since before we even left for Seattle until we returned home! The Alamo on Beacon Hill was the perfect home base for our trip, and though the weather was anything but welcoming, we were always relieved to return to the comfort and calm of this lovely house. The giant projector screen was just the icing on top of it all! "
6561379,50176367,2015-10-10,284447,Todd,We stayed at Colin's place for a month when we moved to Seattle. Colin was an awesome host. The house is in a great location just a couple minutes from downtown located along a prominent bus route and across the street from a park. Highly recommend.
6561379,51571413,2015-10-21,1090184,Brice,Colin was great! The house was even better than expected. Very comfortable and cozy.
6561379,57562540,2015-12-27,24328294,Chanel,"We absolutely loved Colin's house. Not only was it comfortable and accessible, but the decor is so fun and unique. The numerous plants and artwork made the space cozy and stylin. We enjoyed the large fireplace and big kitchen for ease of entertaining. There was even a real Christmas tree for the occasion, making our holiday stay extra special. I would highly recommend this house for a Seattle visit, it is not far from the highway plus there is a park across the street if you bring your pooch with you. Great cozy spot!"
3889050,18845093,2014-09-01,19350872,Alexander,"I had a very pleasant stay at Andrew's place (c/o Aaron/Math&Co) ... The Hostel-like setting offers a very relaxed and creative atmosphere. One that you can only get from a slowly but constantly fluctuating flat-share allowing for short spikes of 4-night-visitors like me.
Fremont being a very nice neighborhood is situated in walking distance to UW which came in very handy for me as I had to visit a lab over there. That I happened to visit at the weekend of Bumbershoot was good luck with Bootsy Collins rocking the stage! Make sure to visit the Troll under Fremont Bridge and the Fremont Sunday Market is a good place to grab a little snack and take a stroll... What I appreciated a lot was the possibility to use a bike to get around - this came in really handy.
Somehow I really hope to see some of the people again - same place, other place - I would go for it again!"
3889050,45179652,2015-08-31,18852734,Mazdak,"This is a great house. The atmosphere is welcoming and fun, while also professional. The place is clean and amenities are accessible. Everyone is very friendly, and Paul was a great house captain. He really helped me out by letting me extend for a night when my other plans fell through. Connecting with the other housemates was also valuable."
3889050,46514608,2015-09-11,30982215,Ohad,"I'll start with the good: the atmosphere was really nice. People were friendly and welcoming, and there was a genuine feeling of community amongst the residents.

Now for the bad:

First of all I must state that it seems I stayed at the place when lots of renovation was happening. I'm hoping this is not the norm, so your mileage may vary...
I was in a 2 person room on the bottom floor. The shower was being renovated (thus non-existing), so the closest shower was one floor up, shared by the residents of both floors. The renovations were not stated in the listing.
My room was adjacent to the work, thus it was impossible to sleep in, since noisy construction started early in the morning. The construction noise also meant that most people preferred to leave the house in order to get some work done. In the room there was an exposed water pipe, and very loud dripping noise started every time that pipe was used. The room had no ""luxuries"" like a hook to hang my wet towel on.

During my stay the entire house lost water for two days. Walking 20 minutes in the morning (to my workplace) just to brush my teeth and take a shower was not a pleasant experience. I can see how this sort of thing can happen, and the host was very gracious about it, trying to find solutions for the residents. Normally I would not comment about such an unforeseen event, but along with the rest of the renovation, this was a bit too much. We were promised a refund for the 2 days, I'm still waiting for mine.

I can see how this place can be great if no renovation is taking place. I think the host should have either shut-down during the renovation, or at least make it explicit in the listing.

Giving it 3 starts, as an average between my 1 star experience and the 5 starts it could have been.

When I left, they just started tearing apart the upstairs kitchen..."
8002965,47299962,2015-09-17,43196225,Robert,"Orla was an excellent host. She is very friendly and easy to talk with. I felt very welcome in her home. Everything was very nice. The land scaping was cool and the back deck was a nice quiet place to hangout after walking around all day. I liked how quiet the neighborhood was and that it still had cool stuff and good food in walking distance. Being near several bus lines and biking trails made it easy to get down town and all the cool places I wanted to go. 
I would definitely recommend this place. "
8002965,48593933,2015-09-27,14790698,David,"Orla was an ideal host in every way. Her house is clean, quiet, and cozy in a quiet and safe part of town. I would recommend her place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle. "

Orla is a very very very... warm-hearted, easy-going and considerated girl, with her help, I spend a wonderful weekend in UW and University Village. Thank you, Orla!"
8002965,52273854,2015-10-27,4011006,Chris,AWESOME STAY! Great neighborhood in close proximity from downtown. The listing was as described.  Orla was very friendly and accommodating and her place was very clean and neat as can be seen from the pics.  I'd definitely be back again!

8002965,54396222,2015-11-19,45825522,Devery,"Orla welcomed me into her lovely home and she even made me coffee on the morning of my big interview (so sweet!). She was an absolute delight to meet and I enjoyed chatting with her in between my adventures out and about exploring Seattle. Her house is in a great location- so many great restaurants within walkable distance, and her neighborhood is quiet and lovely. I would return here again in a heartbeat if I found myself back in the PNW. Thanks Orla!"

There's a Whole Foods nearby, which is also good. The room is small but comfortable enough for a couple of nights and the place is quiet. "

6115807,38147137,2015-07-13,5540751,Chrissy,"Location, location, location!  Located just 3 blocks from Queen Anne Avenue, we were able to walk to Safeway and Trader Joe's and to many other shops and restaurants.  So wonderful.  The home was very comfortable and laid out great.  We loved hanging out in the open living/dining area and relaxing on the back patio.  The bedrooms are quite spacious and we were able to use the small office for our infant's pack n' play.  Also, there are two separate living areas with a couch and TV which would be great if adults want a separate place to hang from the kids.  I chose this house since it was minimally decorated so I wouldn't have to worry about tucking away lots of decorative items from our two young children, but at the same time it had all the essential kitchen/bathroom items we needed.  This was a perfect urban setting but also with a peaceful neighborhood setting.  Also a bonus, there is a local park just two blocks up the street.  The host was also extremely responsive, even during the weekend.  I would 100% stay here again."
6115807,39568856,2015-07-24,38801371,Rick,Awesome house! 8 people fit comfortably and the location is convenient. It's on a corner lot and parking was easy. Thanks for an amazing first experience with this service!
6115807,40544968,2015-07-31,823247,Yen,"It was absolutely a pleasant stay at Gene and Shannon's place. The house was modern, clean and professionally maintained. 

We are 3 colleagues and one of the 3 bedrooms has 2 small beds, so one of us had to take it. However, the house will be perfect for a family. I would definitely recommend this place. "
6115807,43550314,2015-08-20,40491484,Yuxin,It was a perfect house! Me and my family loved it! We enjoyed our trip living there!
6115807,43967245,2015-08-23,36017315,Bin,nice house，nice location。but not for 8persons。max is 6 persons。
6115807,46148407,2015-09-08,38800389,Christy,"This is in a great neighborhood, just a block from the main street with loads of great shops and restaurants. Although Queen Anne is a giant hill, the immediate neighborhood and shops are a relatively flat walk away. 

There's a bus stop about 50 feet from the front door that will take you Seattle Center, Belltown, and downtown. 

The house worked well for us - it was three couples and a baby. All bedrooms were upstairs with a small office to put the baby cot in next to one of the bedrooms. The bedroom with the twin beds isn't nearly as small as it looks in the pictures, but the twin beds are a bit short for tall adults. There was also an additional room on the main floor that had a pull-out couch that could be closed off from the other living area. "
6115807,47723858,2015-09-21,28278408,Julie,"Nice safe neighborhood! Good walking distance for shops, food and transit :) The house was tidy and each room had towels and toiletries for us! Very cute and inviting! We loved the large dining room table which was perfect for a big group! We went for a girls weekend and had a great time at the house and in Seattle!  "
6115807,48891350,2015-09-29,40996328,Liz,Had a great experience staying in this house.  The house itself is very spacious and in a nice neighborhood.  The house was nicely furnished and clean.  There is plenty of parking in the area and everything is a short drive away.  Perfect stay for a group trip.  The hosts are very nice as well.  Would definitely recommend to others.
6115807,55115779,2015-11-28,29626501,Greg,The host was fabulous and comminicated very well! They checked in with us during our stay to make sure everything was ok with the house. They also truned on the heat prior to us showing up and had some snacks and coffee for us! Great experience!
3931571,20250272,2014-09-26,20902039,Andrea,"This place was so lovely and clean!! I really felt at home and loved how every detail of the place had a designer's touch. Location was great, walked to meals almost every night, but there is also a beautiful kitchen if you decide to stay home and cook. Owner was super friendly and made me feel welcome and at home. No complaints here! "
3931571,20451775,2014-09-29,21195708,Amy,We enjoyed every moment of our stay here. The condo was impeccably clean and modern. We enjoyed the convenient location to everything that Fremont has to offer. The fireplace was a nice bonus! Can't wait to return again!

The space was perfect for our group of three who were visiting Seattle and also needed some space to get work done during the weekend. One of our best AirBnB stays. Very, very highly recommended!"
3931571,21620175,2014-10-20,2320821,Michael,"Terrific apartment in a terrific location. Would recommend this for anyone who a charming getaway in one of Seattle's coolest, funkiest neighborhoods"
3931571,22335856,2014-11-03,22932911,Cheik,We really enjoyed our stay at Josh's townhouse. Loved the layout and design of the place. Very slick and modern. The city of Fremont is beautiful and definitely a great place to stay when visiting (website hidden) was very comfortable and accommodated 3 adults very easily. Josh has all of the basic necessity well stocked in the unit and there is plenty of dinning options at walking distance. It also very close to downtown Seattle and the ability to park in the street was a huge plus. I would definitely stay here again if i visit Seattle.
3931571,22661373,2014-11-11,486337,Marley,"Great stay in Seattle in this very clean town home in Fremont. Close to coffee shops, restaurants, and shops. Host was quick to respond and easy to communicate with.  The flexible check in/out was great. "
3931571,27198819,2015-02-28,4099223,Jason,"I stayed at Josh's townhouse for an entire month (!). I had no problems whatsoever — the pictures and listing are accurate. The townhouse is beautiful beyond words (if you're into modern design) and it was spotless when I got there. All of the appliances and fixtures were in good working order. The kitchen certainly does not disappoint.

I never met Josh in person, but he was always responsive whenever I sent him messages (mostly to coordinate check-in and check-out).

I really don't have anything bad to say at all: everything about my stay went perfectly. I just wish I had this townhouse for myself! I would definitely stay here again."
3931571,27619739,2015-03-08,10387069,Becky,"The host was timely and very conscientious. The place was clean and super comfortable. We loved the convenient location and really enjoyed ourselves. Thanks, Josh!"

3931571,30480696,2015-04-22,10827446,Gabe,"I had an absolute 5-star experience staying at Josh's property in Fremont. The townhome was designed beautifully, with very stylish & comfortable furniture and great amenities. Super comfortable bed in the master suite as well. Location is wonderful, within walking distance to a ton of awesome coffee shops, restaurants, and bars in the heart of Fremont. And Josh was the best host anyone could ask for.. super helpful advising us re: parking, best places to eat nearby or grab coffee, etc., and very attentive overall to all of our questions. I would highly recommend staying at this property to all my family & friends visiting Seattle."

3931571,34650246,2015-06-10,28943051,Mark,"This was a well-appointed place with a very modern and tasteful touch inside. All the amenities are nice and comfortable, and the little things such as the keyless entry helped make it an excellent bnb experience. The kitchen is wonderful for those who appreciate serious cooking, even if there are a few missing tools that would limit a serious cook. I didn't find that a problem, however, given that the nicest aspect of this location in Fremont is that there are so many great restaurants within walking or short driving distance...you'd be well advised to get out more often than not. 

This is urban living, with all the benefits of a great (email hidden)d one drawback. It is a very loud place. Nobody in the Seattle area has air conditioning, as the climate generally doesn't require it. But if you happen to be there during a warm spell that demands open windows and the continuous use of fans, the noise level from the main thoroughfare on which the condo sits is significant from early morning through the wee hours of the night . If you're from Manhattan, you won't notice it. If you're used to a quieter setting, you'd be well advised to either stay out at the bars until closing (not a bad idea), or pack ear plugs. 

We didn't have much contact with our host Josh, but I found him to be quick to respond to texts and emails in the few instances we needed to communicate. 

This location doesn't have dedicated parking, but as Josh told us before we arrived, street parking was plentiful. Even with the busy street in front, we never failed to find a parking space directly in front of the Condo during the 10 nights we were there.

The neighborhood is pretty cool, walking distance to quite many pubs and restaurants.
On the down side, the internet was very erratic (we could barely use it) and the street in front of the house is quite noisy.
But overall we clearly appreciated our stay."
3931571,41583820,2015-08-08,30389063,Carmen,Excellent location - many restaurants in walking distance and grocery stores nearby.  This place is well equipped in the kitchen.  I love having in house laundry.   This is my first vacation booked with airbnb and and I had a great experience.   Will definitely book again.
3931571,44578684,2015-08-27,15704111,Debra,"Josh's condo was exactly as advertised.  For us, it was the perfect location, the perfect amount of space, an adequately equipped kitchen for our occasional meal in, perfectly walkable for our meals out and a perfectly comfy bed.  We had a great time in Fremont and a very pleasant stay in Josh's beautiful home with his colorful and interesting art collection.   The bonus for us was being 4 blocks from our kids/grandkids.  "

3931571,55855351,2015-12-06,50062883,Kerri,"This property is well appointed and accurately depicted in the photos.  It was a comfortable respite from the cold rainy days we experienced in Seattle.  Since this is our first airbnb experience, I was cautious in my expectations.  However, I really appreciated having the space of the apartment (compared to a hotel room).  The neighborhood was perfect for us - easy to walk, easy to park, and close to our daughter in Wallingford.  The only drawback for us was the street noise (just cars driving by) from the bedroom, but once we acclimated that was not a problem. Josh's place is a  lovely home away from home."
4077920,40085188,2015-07-28,19578591,Anthony,"Ken and Kim were amazing hosts.  Ken gave a very accurate description of their loft, and answered all of my questions plus made me aware of things to expect on the weekend of my stay.  Kim hand drew a map of places to check out in the neighborhood which helped make my stay in Seattle much more authentic.    They both generously opened their place up to my friends and I and made us feel like we were at home.  They also made themselves available to me if I needed anything, or had any questions.  If I could give them more than a 5 star rating I would, I couldn't recommend better hosts and a better space.  Thank you very much Ken and Kim :)"

The room was great (the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling were a nice surprise!), and its just a short walk from beautiful Thorton creek. The inspiring stuff quotes and whatnot all over the house really brighten the place up. Definately recommend staying here. :-)"
921571,7005305,2013-09-03,3368777,Barbara And Gordon,"We really enjoyed staying with Jim and Judy. Really bonded with Judy since we saw her the most. Often times we had the whole house to ourselves and were encouraged to use it like our own home. The dogs were no problem, one is very protective but she did warm up to us. We will be making that our home base in Seattle again next year. Thanks Judy and Jim!"
921571,18820027,2014-09-01,5802574,Samantha,"Jim & Judy's place was beyond perfect for our needs, and exactly as described. Their location is very central, with easy access to everything you would want to do in Seattle. The bed was one of the best AirBNB beds I've stayed in (so squishy!), and the room was quiet and comfy. Judy made us feel super welcome, and was helpful with giving us ideas for what to do & what was going on that weekend. We highly recommend staying with them given the chance!"
921571,19284125,2014-09-09,20180297,Sarah,Judy was kind and friendly. The room was sunny and very very comfortable; the neighborhood is beautiful and quiet --a calm sanctuary you can come back to after exploring the city (which is only a short bus trip away). 
921571,19680728,2014-09-16,15730356,Trisha,The house was clean and in a nice neighborhood. It was easy enough to get around by bus and was a 15 minutes walk to Northgate mall. Jim and Judy were both friendly but also respected your privacy.
921571,45050740,2015-08-31,3368777,Barbara And Gordon,Jim and Judy are the best. They always make us feel welcome. This is our third summer with them. they are so easy to share with. They tell us to make it our home. We will be staying there again next year.
921571,46169167,2015-09-08,40651241,Samantha,"Our experience staying here was great! Judy was so welcoming and very helpful. Although she wasn't around for a majority of our stay, she took the time to make us feel completely at home. The room was very nice, exactly how it looks on the posting. The bed was comfy and we had a private bathroom to ourselves down the hall. As an additional bonus, we were able to use the hot tub in the backyard, which was such a great way to end a busy day of travelling or sightseeing! Overall, we had a great stay in this guest room. Couldn't have asked for a better first AirBnB experience! "

We had a wonderful experience staying at Adin and Lynda's Studio Apartment which provided great accommodations. Adin, along with their dogs Chip and Salsa, greeted us upon check-in.  Their location was very convenient to downtown Seattle and room amenities were top notch.   A stocked fridge with yogurts, orange juices, and waters was well appreciated. During our stay, Seattle's weather was very warm and they went out of their way to provide us with an extra fan to stay cool. We enjoyed our stay at their studio apartment and will definitely come back when we stay in Seattle again!"

There's a common outdoor patio with a firepit, but the studio itself is  separated from the main house and feels like a private, cozy hotel. Our hosts were very responsive to questions, and provided a helpful binder with FAQs. We didn't have a chance to make use of the in-house massage service listed in the binder, but maybe next time we're back in Seattle :) Thanks again Adin & Lynda, your studio really made the trip!

Thanks from Guy and Mel"
3404700,17229929,2014-08-09,2845214,David,"The garage-top living unit was meticulously clean and had all the necessary components. I liked the fact that the hosts left a few items to eat and drink in the refrigerator, as it is often difficult to bring food with you on a long flight. I was also very pleasantly surprised by the ease of transit from the unit into downtown Seattle. The bus stop is a 1-minute walk from the unit and takes you into the downtown area of Seattle in about 25 minutes. The general neighborhood is completely residential and quiet. I knew the Seattle area well from previous trips and did not need to ask for assistance from my hosts. So I had very little face-to-face contact with Adin or Lynda. I did run into Adin several times during my stay and he was pleasant and encouraged me to use the shared patio area that separates the main house from the garage. The Google street photos of this location are seriously out of date, and the house and garage have been thoroughly renovated."

They were so generous in letting us take home a bag of freshly-caught and cooked crab! So delicious! The space is perfect for a romantic get-away! So cute and cozy! We will most definitely stay here again! Thank you guys so much for everything! :) Your dogs are also adorable! Loved having them greet us all the time!"

The apartment is very well appointed. It was extremely clean and extremely comfortable. The neighborhood is really convenient and quiet, and I'm now a big believer in West Seattle.

Their place is conveniently located for exploring in and around Seattle.  The unit was extremely cozy and private.  Everything was very comfortable and well kept.  In additional to having the convenience of the kitchenette, we were provided extras like bagels, chocolate, and fruit.  The place was presented as if Adin and Lynda were hosting friends or family.  We looked forward to returning after a long day of sightseeing.  If we get the chance to go back to Seattle, we hope to stay in Adin and Lynda's apartment again.  "

It was clean, nicely decorated and very tidy. Due to my height and the low ceilings over the bed and kitchenette sink - I'm 6 ft tall and it's a remodeled attic space - I found the space to be not very comfortable for me, but I knew that might be the case and I decided to take the chance as it met all of my other needs. The bed is a futon, and very firm. It wasn't comfortable for me, but many people would be fine with it. I would recommend this site if you are not tall and don't mind a firm futon bed."

3404700,33872667,2015-06-01,24269057,Meagan,Adin and Lynda were absolutely wonderful hosts. There home was very well organized and clean. The notebook of information detailing what we needed to know about the home as well as the city was informative as well as an awesome tool for the exploration of the trip. There home is lovely and welcoming. Great location for being out of the madness of traffic with lots of little shops close by. Close drive to the city. Would definitely stay there again.
3404700,34331264,2015-06-07,21613190,Jillian,"We loved this studio! When we walked in, the place looked and smelled clean and welcoming. It is cozy, private, well-stocked and so cute. The neighborhood is great - close to the city while still being in a quiet, residential area. We felt very safe. While I did not meet either host, they were both there for any questions and were quick to help us with an internet connection issue. They had snacks for us which was greatly appreciated. They even had a manual with tips about the place and location. You can tell they really put a lot of thought into the studio to make it comfortable for their guests. I would love to stay again. Thank you Lynda and Adin!"
3404700,34983838,2015-06-14,30005031,Cristina,"I got this place for my mom while I was graduating with my Master's from the UW, so needless to say, there was a lot going on at once. Adin and Lynda's place was just as the listing said it would be, very quiet and accommodating, centrally located and perfect for her needs. "
3404700,35803322,2015-06-22,26251290,Jules,"Linda and Adin met us, we had checked in a little earlier, all had proceeded well. Dogs were just great, we had no worries at all. We received lots of information as to bus routes and travel information. Goodies left for us for breakfast, fruit, a lovely touch. Appartment was clean and there were plenty of towels etc. this location is in West Seattle. However bus routes are very good and drivers always so helpful. "
3404700,36292112,2015-06-27,12486540,Monika,"Adin and Lynda were great hosts!! The place is very clean, nice bedroom, and kitchen has everything you need. It is very private with a separate entrance and designated parking spot. Adin and Lynda are both available by phone/text anytime as needed with great communication. The dogs are very friendly and the location is quiet. I loved the breakfast essentials that were provided (fruit, coffee, tea, bagels). I highly recommend and would definitely stay again!"
3404700,36775193,2015-07-01,1254768,Michael,Adin and Lynda was very welcoming and with good advices about visiting seattle. It was great place to stay in a nice neighborhood with good bus connections to seattle and the beautiful Alki beach. We enjoyed our stay in the comfortable accomendation. Thank you!
3404700,37317703,2015-07-06,315949,Nancy,"Adin and Lynda were very responsive, and made checking in and out so easy.  The bed was very comfortable, the linens luxurious, and the kitchen was well-supplied.  The neighborhood was nice, and Chip and Salsa (the dogs) were friendly and welcoming.  "
3404700,37699940,2015-07-09,36991372,Kendra,"I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay while in the area house hunting with my son. The studio is just as pictured--clean, bright, and stocked with everything needed. Adin and Lynda were wonderful hosts and although we didn't need anything additional while we were there, they made sure I knew they were only a phone call away. This was my first experience using AirBnB, and I certainly plan to use the service again. I will definitely let friends and family know about this little gem when they come to visit my family in the area now!"
3404700,38269322,2015-07-14,22963130,Patricia,"We had the best time staying at Adin and Lynda's studio apartment. It felt like a home away from home. The studio was clean and neat, and had everything we needed for our short stay. Adin and Lynda even had some fruit and cookies available for us to snack on. Such a nice touch! The neighborhood is very quiet, and it was a pleasure to return to the studio daily after sightseeing for hours. Adin and Lynda provided a list of local restaurants as well as all the schedules and info necessary to ride public transportation. The studio was centrally located and very close to Sea-Tac airport. We would definitely book the studio again if we ever return to Seattle. "
3404700,39021050,2015-07-20,8006933,Maria,"The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Of course, as a studio, it's a bit small, but Adin and Lynda have made good use of the space and thought of everything a guest might need. Thank you!"
3404700,39599820,2015-07-25,5037174,Lindsay,The neighborhood was very nice and quiet. The studio was very cute and super clean. Adin and Lynda were very thoughtful and even checked on us to make sure we were happy with everything.
3404700,40347587,2015-07-30,35726458,Helen,"We really enjoyed our stay at Adin & Lynda's. The suite was comfortable, clean and pretty. It had everything we needed. We really appreciated the snacks, city guides/maps and Lynda's food places suggestions. "
3404700,41432739,2015-08-07,2845214,David,"This was my second visit to this apartment because I really enjoyed my first visit. The apartment is very convenient for visits to Seattle because it's just approx. 300 feet away from a No. 125 bus line stop. Travel by bus into downtown Seattle takes only about 20 to 25 mins. The apartment is kept very clean and has all the necessary amenities. Bed is large and comfortable. On this second trip I just waved a greeting to Adin  and did not have any need to consult with either host. But on my first trip the hosts were very helpful in providing directions, etc. Probably the most attractive feature of this rental is its price -- a bargain by Seattle standards.    "
3404700,41766140,2015-08-09,35468409,Neal,"Adin and Lynda's place is a fantastic and well appointed bungalow. Private and relatively quiet, the skylight and homey touches like a bowl of fruit make it very liveable. We wanted to stay a week!"
3404700,42284840,2015-08-12,35902692,Trevor,"It was a very quaint and lovely studio. Although we didn't meet, all the amenities were awesome and the bus guide was a life saver....would stay again :)"
3404700,42701646,2015-08-15,37189254,Jade,The apartment matched the listing description exactly! The owners made us feel welcome by providing a welcome sign on their patio table and providing a detailed binder for our stay including suggestions for things to do in the area. The neighborhood was nice and quiet with easy access to the downtown area and airport. 
3404700,43786097,2015-08-22,37185412,Anabella,"This was a wonderful place to stay and the dogs, Chip and Salsa are very friendly"
3404700,44351037,2015-08-25,4956461,Phyllis,"Delightful little place - clean, quiet with snacks! When visiting grandkids I'll be sure to make this place my sanctuary."
3404700,44815160,2015-08-29,2511903,Cheryl,"Theirs is the most thoughtful and well designed space. While small, every inch was devoted to function. From the hooks to the breakfast nook to the bedside tables. We really admired how adin and Lynda thought of everything for a comfortable visit. The key exchange was also very convenient. We came in late at night and they left a light on for us. "
3404700,45372195,2015-09-02,33128871,Brittany,"The accommodations were exactly as we expected!  Clean, well stocked, and the perfect size for a couple visiting Seattle for the first time.  Adin and Lynda answered all my questions in a timely manner and gave great advice on things to do around the city and how to get there.  Definitely recommend for 1-2 people "
3404700,46759841,2015-09-13,4432977,Kazuma,"Quiet neighborhood, 15 minutes away from Downtown. Very cozy and perfect for just a few nights in Seattle."
3404700,48583283,2015-09-27,43380146,Grant,"Adin & Lynda were great!  I really liked having a separate space that I could have to myself.  The studio was located above the garage, which was separate from the house.  The location was fantastic, in that it was very quiet  and private.  The hosts were available for my questions and they made me feel very welcome.  The space was very clean, and it was perfect for my trip to the Seattle area.  I'm hoping to stay with them again in the near future.  "
3404700,49770225,2015-10-06,15726122,Kelvin,"Adin & Lynda made our stay very comfortable. They addressed our needs and questions in a timely manner. The studio was very clean, cozy, cute and everything described in the listing. The location of the studio was perfect for our visit. We were only 15 short minutes away from downtown Seattle. The highway was easily accessible which made our visit great! Seattle is a great place and when we visit again, we would stay try to stay at this studio again!"
3404700,52710345,2015-11-01,29680571,Li,"We stayed at Adin and Lynda'place for almost three weeks, and we had a wonderful time. The place is very new and clean. Well equipped. Adin and Lynda were always there when we need anything. We would definitely recommend this place! "
3404700,53440293,2015-11-08,23041416,Jasleen,It was my second time staying here and it's been by far my favourite experience. So cozy 
3404700,54292422,2015-11-17,16597919,Jamie,Very cute place in West Seattle! Would definitely stay here again. Adin and Lynda were great hosts! 
3404700,54936409,2015-11-25,49103276,Emily,My husband and I just moved to Seattle and needed time to find an apartment. This cozy above garage place was perfect for what we needed in our in between time. The owners were very friendly but not as friendly as their two dogs. To be greeted every morning by loving dogs was an added bonus for us. I would recommend his place to anyone wanting to stay in the West Seattle area. 
1781873,10831265,2014-03-09,8009607,T,"This spot is fantastic: well appointed, great location, private, quiet, spaceous, lovely view, and details like chocolate, toiletries, refreshing beverages.  The baby grand (!) is truly the icing on the cake for me, and hopefully I didn't wear out my welcome on it!  Mimi is a sweet, hospitable, and interesting lady, and a thorough and thoughtful hostess.   Will definitely keep this spot on my radar for future visits!"
1781873,13700225,2014-06-02,10210915,Sav,Mimi is a stellar hostess! She personally gave me the tour of her charming and romantic apartment. It is well appointed and even features a full sized piano. Mimi even gave me special accomodations to park my unusually large vehicle. I hope to rent from her again.
1781873,13766143,2014-06-03,387679,Tamara,"Very nice, classy apartment with all that I needed to make it a great stay.  Very lovely view from the patio and out the windows from the kitchen and main room.  I only stayed briefly (1 night), but would be happy to return for a longer stay.  "
1781873,13838175,2014-06-05,3515898,Nick,"I chose Mimi’s place because of the proximity to the Tractor Tavern for a surprise night out of music with my fiancé but the place was way more than I was expecting!  It’s spacious, has an amazing view, charming neighborhood and a huge thing for me – there was a Ballwin grand piano in the apt!  Gorgeous and sounded great.  This is definitely on my list of great place to stay when in the Freemont/Ballard neighborhood.  "
1781873,14071546,2014-06-10,9799210,Rachel,"Mimi was very accommodating and responded quickly to my inquiry, and even tried to offer a discount. The place was absolutely wonderful--very clean, in a lovely location with a good view, and had all the necessary amenities. The deck was great and there was no disturbance from the other tenants, besides some very brief AM construction (but of course there's nothing Mimi could do about that). The grand piano was also a lovely addition, and the apartment's library was full of great books on gardening that we very much enjoyed. 
Overall, it was a wonderful stay! Thanks Mimi!"
1781873,14458774,2014-06-19,5268747,Kristin,"The house was clean, well situated, exactly as expected and the host was very communicative. Can't ask for anything more, especially when just stopping through town for a short time."
1781873,14498338,2014-06-20,16882057,Todd,"Hi,
This was my 1st airbnb experience and it was great.
Mimi's place was fabulous and so is she.
She has made it very comfortable and easy.
There was even a baby grand piano...wow.
Thanks Mimi and thanks to airbnb"
1781873,14878190,2014-06-28,16444933,Brian,"Me and my wife loved our stay with Mimi in Seattle. The location was right between a ton of great neighborhoods like Fremont, Ballard, and Phinney Ridge!  We thought the house was perfectly cozy for us and had no issues getting in or out. Overall a fantastic trip and staying at the airbnb made it so easy and comfortable!"
1781873,15064815,2014-07-01,16059077,Hilary,Great location! Easy in and out with a door code instead of a key. Clean and well laid out. Lots of good light.
1781873,15190858,2014-07-04,2975981,Kyle,"This place was in a great location, just a short 10 minute drive into downtown. My wife and I stayed here 2 nights and found the place great.

The building seems old but the kitchen, bathroom and floors are modern. The view from the balcony is indeed awesome!

It's also walking distance to a Fred Meyers for any groceries you might want.

I highly recommend it as a weekend stay while exploring Seattle."
1781873,15321097,2014-07-07,15498153,Geri,"My Husband and I stayed in Mimis upstairs Apartment for three nights. 
Unit is upstairs and has two porches. One garden view , the other roof tops and peak a boo city view. 
This place has a relaxed energy about it that we appreciated.
Neighbors were Friendly and informative.  Bed was very comfortable !Shower was nice and hot!
Full kitchen with every thing you need cook and share a meal together.
Extras included Baby grand piano,comfy couch and library of good books and fine art on the walls. 
Mimi was very hospitable and we would recommend this  place to a friend!

"
1781873,15432017,2014-07-08,17433990,Kevin,"This place was great!  It is exactly as pictured: cute, clean, and well-decorated.  The couch is comfy and the whole place felt well taken care of.  The cupboards were stocked with everything you'd need to cook dinner, though we didn't get to make use of them on our short trip.  There is a piano, and the shelves are lined with interesting books, too!  The back porch was delightful -- we enjoyed a glass of wine there.  The bed was comfortable, there was a fan in the bedroom, and there were plenty of soft towels in the bathroom.

The location is perfect, and only a short walk from, say, the Theo Chocolate Factory.  It was easy to find, has off-street parking, and was a quick drive to downtown.  The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.

We didn't meet Mimi, though she was responsive to messages, and the place was ready and waiting for us ahead of the posted check-in time.  The pin-code door access and private side entrance meant it was easy to come and go as we pleased.

Heads up to anybody with light sensitivity while sleeping -- bring an eye mask if you have one, as there aren't any curtains in the bedroom, though the windows are frosted.  The only other complaint we had was that the drains in the bathroom sink and shower were pretty slow to drain, leaving you standing in a puddle.

Overall it was a great place to stay, quite affordable, and we'd definitely recommend it!"
1781873,15788574,2014-07-15,17427067,Conor,"My wife and I stayed here for a few days after our wedding, and it was amazing! The apartment is well furnished and clean. It is in a quiet neighborhood, and there is a nice kitchen and deck. We walked to get coffee in the morning and enjoyed it on the deck with a nice view of Ballard. Mimi and Lucas are incredibly friendly and accommodating. I strongly recommend this to anyone that wants to have a relaxed time in a nice non touristy part of Seattle. We had the BEST time!"
1781873,15882291,2014-07-17,1197462,Cotter & Josh,"This was a very clean, quiet, relaxing, and pleasant respite in Seattle. We loved the location near Ballard and Fremont. The flat was spacious - more so than we anticipated - and had a nice deck to enjoy the beautiful view. Mimi was a friendly host who warmly greeted us upon arrival and was very quick to respond. If our travels take us back to Seattle in the future, we will definitely consider staying here again. "
1781873,15934471,2014-07-18,16987003,Indigo,Mimi was a perfect host! No problems at all and the apartment is so cute and in an awesome location!
1781873,16208053,2014-07-23,16017156,Patrick,We enjoyed our stay. Everything was as promised and very comfortable. Mimi got back to us quickly on anything we needed. We think she had a good place going here.
1781873,16500403,2014-07-28,5772258,Jen,"The apartment was absolutely perfect.  Cute, quaint, great location and just enough space for us to be comfortable.  We'll most definitely be staying again!"
1781873,16729361,2014-08-01,2874195,Gowa,We had a great stay at Mimi's. Great location and the place has everything you need. Clean. Thoughtful. Good value 
1781873,17682070,2014-08-16,10419492,Eric,"Mimi was very flexible with our odd schedule and was very nice.  The apartment suited our needs and has a great view of the sunset!  Convenient to both Ballard and Fremont, an excellent location."
1781873,17804462,2014-08-17,19898592,Sam,Great stay great location. Thank you very much.
1781873,18308567,2014-08-25,6555225,Peter,"My wife and I loved our stay at this apartment. The space was just as described, and the patio had a great view of some other neighborhoods.

We also loved that the living room had a grand piano! We actually used it too, when practicing music for a wedding.

Mimi provided a fan and hair dryer upon request (surprisingly, other airbnb hosts have dodged/ignored such requests in the past, so we really appreciated that Mimi was on top of this). 

We will definitely look for this place for future stays in Seattle.
"
1781873,18603214,2014-08-28,5326017,Ellen,"We stayed at Mimi's appartment for three nights and loved everything about it.  It was quiet, comfortable, well-appointed and had everything we needed.  I would go so far as to say that it was better than described on the website.  Situated in a nice neighborhood and close to Fremont's shops and restaurants made if perfect for us--away from the urban hussle and bussle, yet close to quality restaurants and shops and a neighborhood with character.  It is also in close enough proximity to downtown and everything a tourist would want to visit, but far enough away to get some peace and quiet during the day or night. We have no complaints at all and only positive feedback.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
1781873,34232521,2015-06-06,4514240,Andrea,"My boyfriend and I stayed here because I had a fashion show in the Fremont area. It was the perfect location for everything we wanted to do while in Seattle. Everything about our stay was great. Lovely view, quiet, clean, and well thought out for guests comfort. "
1781873,34649677,2015-06-10,25499720,Diane,"I stayed at Mimi's house for four nights , everything was wonderful clean and kitchen was well stocked I loved sitting on the deck and Mimi's was very accommodating. Very peaceful relaxing place to stay I can not wait to go back to Seattle again . Thank you Mimi "
1781873,35089200,2015-06-15,31247653,Hongyu,Mimi is really a nice hostess. The apt is great. Glad I chose this one for my parents.
1781873,35792640,2015-06-22,13456928,Joan,"The Fremont View apartment view was bright, spacious and comfortable with wonderful views of Fremont and Ballard. It has a fully equipped kitchen and includes use of a Mac computer and a grand piano. We loved taking walks in the neighborhood and enjoyed its proximity to lots of interesting parts of Seattle. Mimi was a gracious hostess and gladly accommodated our needs. "
1781873,36209477,2015-06-26,8292255,Kate,"Mimi was a great host.  We didn't get a chance to meet her, but our arrival was seamless and the place had everything we needed.  The side porch with a view of Seattle was our favorite part, but the apartment itself was full of charm and character and lots of natural light.  We would definitely like to stay here again if we make it back to Seattle."
1781873,36530395,2015-06-29,17513042,Ken,"The apartment was wonderful! The space was easy to find, spotless, and an amazing price. Thank you so much  for renting us your space"

Mimi was a great host providing us with valuable information about Seattle."
1781873,37426733,2015-07-06,14020772,Alisa,"I loved staying here!  I slept SO WELL!!!  And what a nice, huge space with a great view.  Great value.  As it mentions in the posting, this apartment is owned by folks with dogs, so avoid if you have allergies.  "
1781873,37667878,2015-07-09,12272533,Lyndsey,"What a great spot to enjoy Seattle! The apartment had the perfect amount of space for two adults and a rambunctious toddler. The upstairs deck and circular layout also let us host two more for dinner and games in the sun. It's right on the Fremont/Ballard border - a nice walk from Bourbon and Bones, The Dish, and other great eats. Hope to visit again soon!"
1781873,37765640,2015-07-10,3804560,Colleen,"Mimi was a great host. She accommodated getting me into the house a few hours early. There is a MAC computer to use, a sweet smelling garden & a deck.  Fresh flowers & a guide of what to do in the area were waiting for me.  A spacious apt in a quiet, quaint neighborhood."
1781873,37979448,2015-07-12,22737498,Daniel,"I had a wonderful time staying at Mimi's Air b&b in Fremont. The place is very clean, had everything we needed, and it's in a great location! I would definitely stay here again next time I'm visiting Seattle."
1781873,38208374,2015-07-13,37500525,Beth,Mimi was great. Got in touch with us quickly and the house was in great condition. Also really great Seattle location. 
1781873,38548743,2015-07-16,647613,Brad,The apartment was very comfortable.    It was clean and quiet.  I had no problems at all and I will most likely stay there again.
1781873,38730002,2015-07-18,18773485,Karen,"Huge space, easy instructions for entering, all amenities listed were included "
1781873,39292705,2015-07-22,13751442,Paul,"Nice enough apartment, but the draw here is location and price. It's a great neighborhood and the view across the water makes for a really nice sunset. Communication and entry was no-nonsense and easy. Overall, a good, affordable place to stay. Not immaculate, but not unacceptable either."
1781873,39526086,2015-07-24,36903939,Kevin,"Mimi was a great host. It was very easy to check in. We loved the tea and coffee offered to us, and the house was very clean. We would definitely stay there again!"
1781873,39607525,2015-07-25,964265,Edward,"We recently enjoyed a 1-night stay at Mimi's apartment. The apartment itself has all the basics and is comfortable and we especially appreciated sitting on the cozy porch at night with a glass of wine. We also found it convenient to have a car space in front of the apartment. Although we did not meet Mimi in person, she was very responsive through emails and texts and she sent us the passcode for the front door prior to our arrival. "
1781873,40615594,2015-08-01,10564606,Sarah,We absolutely LOVED Mimi's place in Fremont. The view was just fantastic and the home is beautiful. We felt like we lived in Seattle for a few days. We will definitely be back!!! Thanks again for your hospitality. 
1781873,42279317,2015-08-12,3687151,Thomas,"Very nice place to stay. Apartment has a nice feel to it. Location is very central to great areas, but not walkable to very much. "
1781873,42556315,2015-08-14,37999374,Maureen," Mimi was very welcoming and took the time to help us make the best use of our limited time in the area; mapping out scenic walking routes, and suggesting activities and restaurants in the Fremont neighborhood. Her apartment is clean and charming; in a section of Seattle with interesting houses, lots of flowers, wild blackberries growing nearby; close to many fun areas such as Queen Anne.  My husband and I were very pleased. "
1781873,43040166,2015-08-17,8616166,Carolyn,Mimi was very welcoming and the apartment was lovely! it was even more spacious than we expected and we love like to go back!
1781873,43505073,2015-08-20,2879926,Marisa,"Mimi's house is adorable and exactly what we'd hoped to find for our stay in Seattle. It's close to Fremont, which is a hip yet low-key neighborhood with restaurants, bars, shops, etc. 

We enjoyed the deck and the view very much. 

Mimi was a great host. Communication with her was easy, as was check in and check out. For the most part, we didn't see her, so we had complete privacy and space. But we had the opportunity to meet her the night before we departed, and really enjoyed chatting with her. "
1781873,43826066,2015-08-22,2066147,Andrew,"If this system could rate a host with one to five stars, Mimi would get six. The apartment was terrific and very well stocked with everything you could need, including a computer and cell phone charger. But that is just background. Mimi herself is caring, interesting and the true definition of a terrific host. A couple of travel mishaps (my fault) occurred while we were there, and Mimi was incredibly fast in providing whatever help was needed. She went above and beyond. I would unhesitatingly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in a real cool area of Seattle. "
1781873,45134254,2015-08-31,18296688,Eric,Great host and very accommodating to our scheduling needs. Easy check in process. Liked the private entrance around the side of the house. Good location on a hill with a view of the water and bridge in the distance. 
1781873,45431999,2015-09-02,39186308,Daniel,"Her place was great! Sunny, private, and cute! Close walking proximity to Fremont. Would stay here again! =)"
1781873,47090542,2015-09-15,1256825,Brendan,"Great view, cute place, short drive to Fremont coolness. "
1781873,47777752,2015-09-21,8665643,James,"If you are a ""foodie"" and looking for a place to stay just outside of downtown Seattle - this is the place! Super quiet neighborhood, perfect for a couple's getaway. Less than two miles from a ton of great local restaurants, bars and breweries in multiple neighborhoods. Dedicated parking spot and plenty of room in the apartment. Didn't even miss not having a television for the week we stayed. Mimi was great getting us in with text and e-mail. Zero complaints, would gladly stay here again on our next visit to Seattle."
1781873,48550975,2015-09-27,42080761,Megan,"Cute, older home. Centrally located, but not as walkable as I had expected due to a very busy street/industrial district between the house and the Ballard neighborhood. 

Mimi did a great job of giving us clear instructions, leaving a clean and tidy place, and even left us chocolate as a welcome gift. The piano was a plus. Very much recommended if you are looking for a lowkey, quiet place to stay while in Seattle."
1781873,49515251,2015-10-04,4398697,Jillian,"The place was beautiful, clean, and spacious! The location is great and the view from the deck is lovely. Mimi was a fantastic host with quick responses and easy check-in. Such a pleasure to stay in your lovely space!"
1781873,50130962,2015-10-09,2734499,Jason,I would highly recommend this Airbnb. It was centrally located between Ballard and Fremont with easy access to downtown Seattle. Plenty of space. Clean! Love the balcony too. Oh and the WiFi was super fast which was important to my business. Great communication with the host. 
1781873,51993621,2015-10-25,44128581,Michael,"My overall experience at Mimi's apartment was excellent.

The place was exceptionally clean and organized. The layout was just as the pictures suggested. The location was perfect for what I needed. I would recommend this dwelling for anyone staying in the Seattle area."
1781873,52442795,2015-10-29,12938360,Kelley,"Mimi was a splendid, welcoming host.  She happily greeted us to ensure we had everything we needed in the apartment. The place itself is comfortable and the location is great-within walking distance to mostly anything you need but secluded enough to feel like you're not in the city. Thanks Mimi!"
1781873,54024948,2015-11-15,5628379,Nate,"Great location and perfect low key spot
For two people. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed. The piano was an added bonus!"
1781873,54735749,2015-11-23,5354876,Nadama,We really enjoyed staying here and felt right at home as we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. The view of the Cascades at sunset was striking and wonderful. The piano was a nice surprise as I am a pianist and enjoyed playing it while I was there. 
1781873,55368910,2015-12-01,44463640,Nancy,"It was a nice gesture to put a chocolate bar on the bed--but there was no breakfast AND no directions to use the coffee pod pot.  The house is on a very high hill, with no store in sight.  It was particularly a problem for us, having traveled by plane across country.  Fortunately I brought a couple granola bars for us to have until our adult children could come to get us.  It was rather precarious to climb up a some stone steps and over an old wooden deck to get to the second floor entrance.  It was really tricky for my husband, who was wearing a cast on his foot. There was not railing all of the way.
   As we were isolated, there was only a computer to use, which helped.
   (No TV!!!)  When seated on the couch in the living room, there was just a baby grand piano and an African drum to view.  Since there was a 9 month old baby downstairs, I wasn't inclined to play the piano.
  The entertainment center in the bedroom had a wooden bar and hangers!
    The sheets were leftover from a camp(old and worn) and the rugs in the bathroom needed to be washed. 
   Since there was only one washcloth provided, my husband got it as he washed up first.
   It was very isolating and we were very frustrated by the situation."
3144311,36610094,2015-06-29,35411047,Steven,"Condo was exactly as described pictures were accurate, what isn't pictured is the 2 person balcony off the living room.(great for just taking in the views at night) My wife and I arrived late around midnight and Aman was very accommodating in having his friend meet us to let us in. Aman was great in answering all of our questions quick responses as well as communicating everything we would need to know. This was a great first experience will stay here again if we are ever in the area. We also were  impressed when he would randomly send a text or phone call to ensure everything was going great."
3144311,37370133,2015-07-06,997246,Andrew,The location was fantastic and the view of the fireworks over Lake Union was amazing! Aman was incredibly accommodating and made us feel totally at home. I would definitely recommend staying at his place!
3144311,43129854,2015-08-17,26446450,Tan,"Aman's place is amazing! It is in great location and has beautiful views of Seattle. It should be especially mentioned it is only a five minutes walk from one of the best restaurants in Seattle, the Canlis. The room is large, clean, modern and has everything that we needed. Aman is also a great host. He had not only been very helpful, but even provided some wines for us. We really had two wonderful nights at his place. I would strongly recommended this place and certainly come back again.

3144311,46237004,2015-09-08,17175663,Mary,"Aman is an amazing host; he is friendly, enthusiastic and generous. He left us bottled water, chocolate, cookies and a bottle of wine, and invited us to help ourselves to anything we wanted from his fridge and cupboards! His place was just as described and has wonderful views over Lake Union. It is only a 5 minute drive to the Space Needle, Space Museum, Chihuly Gardens, and a host of other places in the central part of Seattle. He has a very spacious bedroom, nice living room with big TV, and a washer and dryer, which is always handy when you are travelling. My only reservation was that I found his kitchen and bathroom counters quite cluttered, because he left out all his small appliances and protein powders in the kitchen, and his own toiletries in the bathroom. Aside from that, I think this place would be perfect for any 30-something's who want a handy base from which to explore Seattle for a few days."
218741,1512376,2012-06-18,2504638,Matt,"Corinne and her husband were absolutely wonderful. From the immaculately made bed to the rolled towels, they made us feel completely at home.

They were also able to offer up some great information about their--and surrounding--neighborhood, with all the cool stuff to do. 

If ever in need, we will likely stay with them again!"
218741,1774144,2012-07-22,2994776,Trent,"My friend Allegra and I were on tour and had a couple days off so we decided to make a trip to Seattle.  We found Corinne on airbnb and she responded to our request very pomply.  She and her husband and three dogs were super friendly and welcoming.  The room was very private and comfortable and it was overall a very pleasent stay.  We were treated to coffee and tea in the morning, and they even gave us four cans of gingerale and a bouquet of daiseys from their front yard for the road!  I would definitely recommend their place to anybody looking for a place in the Seattle metro area!"
218741,1823805,2012-07-28,2939702,Dominik,I really enjoyed the time I've stayed at the house of Corinne and Tom. They are very friendly and warm-hearted. The neighborhood is quiet nice and there are plenty of good coffee bars und restaurants around. You have to be comfortable with dogs because there are three of them - but very cute. I can definitly recommend this location!
218741,1855353,2012-07-31,1423328,Rob,"My recent stay with Corinne and Tom made for an excellent second Airbnb experience!

Everything was exactly as described.  The large bedroom has a very comfortable bed, perfect for a good night's rest after a wedding reception that went late into the night.  Their three dogs are very friendly; and Corinne and Tom generously offered everything from local maps and neighborhood information to coffee and Canada Dry's Green Tea Ginger Ale (which coincidentally happens to be one of my favorite beverages.)

I would rate Corinne and Tom as nothing less than five-star hosts, and I wouldn't hesitate to see if they are available during my next trip to Seattle."
218741,1896860,2012-08-05,1132172,Zach,Corinne and Tom were great hosts and were able to accomodate me on short notice. They were super friendly and Corinne was super helpful sharing info on getting around the Seattle area. They even invited to join them and their friends for dinner. How cool is that? 
218741,1979079,2012-08-13,790625,Sydney,"Corinne and Tom (and the dogs) were such gracious hosts to my boyfriend and I. Their place was spotless, they were kind to make coffee, give us restaurant recs and help us with anything we needed.  They told us all about the Seattle culture and about life there. Really wonderful couple with a positive, open outlook. We hope to stay in touch with them when they are in the bay area!"
218741,2050266,2012-08-20,3240096,Whitney,"Corinne and her husband were so NICE! It was a first time experience to do Air B&B for us and they made it so easy and pleasant. The room is large and comfortable, their dogs are adorable, and the house itself is impeccably clean and very well decorated. Corinne was helpful in giving tips about exploring the area and was very easy to talk to. I thouroughly enjoyed my stay and would have liked to spend more time there if I could have! "
218741,2067523,2012-08-22,1324417,Alana,Wonderful place to stay with great hosts. Thank you so much!!
218741,2118107,2012-08-27,3307833,Eric,"We enjoyed a welcoming and comfortable weekend with Tom and Corrine. Our communication with Corrine prior to arrival was efficient and with easy. We appreciate the conversations, warm acceptance into their home, and overall hospitality. And, their dogs--Ninja, Butters, and Sky--are well-behaved and lots of fun!"
218741,2166902,2012-09-01,2885974,Alan,Corinne and Tom were very interesting people to talk to and gave us lot of information on traveling within the Seattle area.  Their place is conveniently located to the bus lines and other attractions are within walking distance.  The room was clean and quiet.  We would definitely stay again!
218741,2208809,2012-09-05,3264373,Peter,"Corinne and Tom are phenomenal hosts and made us feel right at home for our long weekend in Seattle. The room is exactly as advertised. They have a lovely home! Its super convenient to downtown, just a 15 minute bus ride away, and sits in the middle of a great neighborhood. I'd recommend Corrine and Tom's place to anyone who wants to spend  time in Seattle."
218741,2323269,2012-09-17,2994667,Elisabeth,"I absolutely loved my stay at Corinne and Tom's lovely, charming, beautiful home in Ballard. They are absolutely wonderful hosts - with an unlimited amount of knowledge about great bars and restaurants to check out in the neighborhood, and things to do around Seattle. The location is conveniently located to essential bus lines, and an easy walk to downtown Ballard. Their dogs are adorable and  I'd happily recommend their place to anyone looking to travel to Seattle. "
218741,2338589,2012-09-18,2630353,Eric,"Comfortable, well-maintained home in quiet area. The dogs were friendly and very well behaved. "
218741,2401585,2012-09-24,2089766,Kim,We absolutely loved our stay in Tom and Corrine's beautiful home with their lovely dogs. Tom and Corrine are both very friendly and helpful and made us feel right at home. Our room was large and spacious and very comfortable for our 5 days in Seattle. We also loved the location. Ballard is full of amazing eateries and cafes and bars that are just a walk away. A beighbourhood that we both felt would siit us perfectly if we lived in Seattle. Nice and easy to catch the bus into town when we did. We would love to stay with them again if in Seattle. 
218741,2551184,2012-10-08,3711361,Andrea,"Corinne and Tom (and the dogs) were excellent hosts! They let us use the kitchen and (awesome) barbecue whenever we wanted, the room was large and comfortable, and they gave us lots of great recommendations for things to do. We spent one evening in the neighborhood (Ballard) and two in other areas (downtown, Capitol Hill) and it was very easy to get around on the bus. If you don't mind dogs, this place is great! I'd be happy to come back again. "
218741,2626619,2012-10-15,2672975,Jessica,Corinne and Tom were super friendly and their home was beautiful and very clean. We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend them to friends who are looking for a place in Seattle. :) 
218741,2757592,2012-10-29,3307833,Eric,This was my second stay with Corinne and Tom. The arrangements were made with ease and I was met with homey hospitality. The room (as well as the rest of the house) was familiar and comfortable.
218741,3295252,2013-01-06,1806034,Michael And Elisa,"Corrine and Jim are very friendly, helpful and open.  The house is in a good, convenient neighborhood, and the room was big and the bed comfortable.  Bathroom upstairs was only issue,but they are putting a small one near room in near future.   At that point, for the price, I can give it easily 5 stars.  We would stay again next time in Seattle."
218741,3430214,2013-01-28,3307833,Eric,"This was my third stay with Corinne and Tom, and it was another pleasant experience!"

218741,4412353,2013-05-03,6105821,Kelly,"This was our first time staying with Corinne and Tom. We were staying for 2 nights during our apartment hunt in Seattle. The house is wonderful as are Corinne and Tom. The 3 dogs, Sky, Ninja, and Butters were very energetic and I miss them already. Thanks again for the stay and yes, we found a house to rent!"
218741,4720320,2013-05-21,4467262,Leone,"I had a great stay with Corinne and Tom! They were super helpful and if you like dogs, you'll love their three. Their space is warm and comfortable. I stayed with them for two nights while I explored different neighborhoods in Seattle to relocate to. They offered great advice on where to look, food to try, things to do, etc. They helped make my location scouting all the more easy. If I ever needed to, I would definitely stay with them again!"
218741,5001654,2013-06-06,6646965,Franziska,"Corinne&Tom are wonderful people, always trying to help and support their guests. They made my trip to Seattle a lot easier and more enjoyable. I loved staying with these lovely, friendly, warm, helpful and good-natured people, and their three amazing dogs, and I can highly recommend them! Thank you for your hospitality!"
218741,5100138,2013-06-12,6021218,Sooyeon,"Corinne and Tom were wonderful hosts! They respect mine and my mom's privacy and made us feel like it was our home away from home. The Ballard neighborhood was very quiet and charming as well. Although it took longer that we thought to get to downtown, the local rapid ride bus ran every 10 to 15 minutes, so we did not have much problems. Thank you again you guys!"
218741,5123807,2013-06-13,3763570,Dan,"Super nice hosts, great pooches and the house is located around a mile from the fun hang out area in Ballard. Bedroom is downstairs in the basement with plenty of privacy, bathroom is shared upstairs. Great hospitality!"
218741,5193217,2013-06-17,6705271,Ginny,Communication with Corinne was easy and her place was great--plus located just a quick walk from a really delicious bakery. I only wish we'd been in town long enough to spend some time lounging in the hammock in the backyard. I'd definitely stay with her again if I find myself in Seattle in the future.  
218741,5249654,2013-06-20,804040,Alia,"I had a great stay with Corinne and Tom.  The room was comfortable and they were flexible to my schedule and very gracious hosts (even left me homemade pie).  Only wish I had more time to enjoy their peaceful neighborhood and backyard.

"
218741,5329937,2013-06-24,132575,Charles,We had a pleasant experience staying in Corinne's bedroom.  We would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in Ballard.  
218741,5887935,2013-07-21,4005460,Niklas,We stayed for five nights and had a wonderful time in Seattle. Corinne and Tom are super friendly and helpful. They pointed us to some locations and activites that we would have missed without them. The place is conveniently located in beautiful Ballard and close enough to bars and restaurants to walk there. We also enjoyed sitting outside and relaxed in the beatiful garden. We'd definitly stay again with Tom and Corinne. 
218741,5926242,2013-07-22,1897975,Wade,Corinne and Tom are fantastic hosts (coffee in the morning! bar recommendations!) and the room is a very comfortable place to come back to after exploring Ballard. It's a lovely walk through a beautiful neighbourhood full of trees and interesting houses (and what's with all those vintage cars?) to the heart of Ballard where you'll find excellent food and drink and happy hours. We had a great great a weekend. Sweet pups are a bonus!
218741,6012643,2013-07-26,3605639,Jeff,Corinne and Tom were super accommodating hosts for my stay at their place.  The neighborhood is quiet and within a few minutes drive to many good restaurants and bars.  The living space is great as you have the entire lower level of their home for yourself.  
218741,6115145,2013-07-30,7341695,Kevin,"Corinne & Tom were wonderful hosts. (Skye, Butters, and Ninja the pups too!) The house was comfortable, clean, and the room was downstairs with lots of privacy. They had fresh coffee for us every morning and breakfast foods available if we had been around for it. Downtown Ballard was a 15 minute or so walk, so it was the perfect location for us. Thank you!"
218741,6175128,2013-08-02,6905969,Shaina,"Staying with Corinne and Tom was a WONDERFUL experience! Great host with great suggestion for things to do & eat around the city.  The room had tons of space, with a hanger rack, a lounging chair, a fan if it gets hot (though you dont need it), beautiful art work surrounding the walls and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on!  There was relaxing, subtle music playing the entire time we were there, which was a very nice touch that made us feel a little more at home.  If you plan on driving, not to worry because there's a tons of street parking.  I HIGHLY recommend staying with Corinne and Tom, they are one of the sweetest people we've met, and their wonderful, adorable dogs made us feel even more at home!  My only regret was we didn't stay there long enough!  "
218741,6278976,2013-08-06,5419633,Doug,"Enjoyed my extended weekend in Ballard and exploring various tree lined roads with older houses into downtown Ballard about a mile and a half away.  The D line bus is close by with easy access to downtown Seattle. Tom and Corinne were good, conversational hosts and helpful with directions to local restaurants.  Very friendly dogs after a few brief barks when they quickly quiet down.  The room in the basement is large with a comfy bed.  Bathroom is upstairs on the main floor."
218741,6314945,2013-08-07,4169225,Tien Rachel,Corinne is super Friendly and he place is well located. Her dogs are super cute and my partner and I enjoyed our stay. 
218741,6336283,2013-08-08,849592,Rie,"Corinne was a great host. She was very friendly and nice. I could easily find a parking spot around her place. Her dogs were well trained and didn't bother me at all. The room in the basement was large, private, and confortable. I enjoyed staying at her place. Thank you! "
218741,6359261,2013-08-09,7746589,Rosie,"Corinne and Tom were incredibly welcoming and accommodating  Corrine had great tips about where to eat and hang out in the area. I'll definitely try to stay with them the next time I'm in the area!

218741,6440169,2013-08-12,7827235,Angela,We had a great time staying with Corinne and Tom!  Delightful and very friendly hosts (+dogs!).  Would definitely stay again...thanks!
218741,6499667,2013-08-14,3763570,Dan,"Always a great stay with Corinne and Tom! Really nice neighborhood with great tacos down 15th at Camion, and a lot of night life down on Ballard"
218741,6527610,2013-08-15,6549724,Justin,"Very friendly and nice people.  Helpful and accommodating.

Room is very private and located in the basement.  Comfortable bed.  

Good location and good price..  "
218741,6881002,2013-08-28,106128,Peter,"I was in town just for 24 hours on my way to the mountains. I was visiting a friend who lives nearby in Ballard. Corinne's place was great: quiet, comfortable, and well-located for my activities."
218741,6908553,2013-08-29,2028486,Jim,"Corinne and her husband were very friendly and accommodating. The room was comfortable, well equipped for guests and quiet. The location was close to my business appointments. I appreciated their ability to take a guest with only a day's notice. Thanks! "
218741,6929442,2013-08-30,3628364,Kathy,"Corinne and Tom were very flexible in meeting our needs and that of our 22-year old daughter.  Thanks to them, we were able to experience the area in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.  "
218741,7015341,2013-09-03,7607968,Katie,Wonderful time in Ballard!  Corinne and Tom and their three dogs greeted us on the evening we arrived.  The room was very private with a comfortable bed and even had a fridge outside of our room for leftovers or beer!  I appreciated being able to use a dresser for my clothes and feel settled. The bathroom (shared) was very clean and had great water pressure for the shower. They also had helpful maps and books in the room.  Corinne and Tom made freshly brewed coffee for us each am- and they even got us some fresh flowers for our room!  Corinne was a great resource and showed us the lay of the land on our first night in town- we had similar tastes in bars/food etc. so I appreciated her suggestions.  We explored most of Ballard via foot- but could have chosen to take the bus if we wanted.  We also made daytrips downtown and to Freemont very easily via the bus.  If you explore by foot- be prepared to walk a bit.  If you want to go all around Seattle- you may want to rent a car.  Great place to stay with cool people at a great price.  We would go again for sure!  
218741,7039040,2013-09-04,2909220,Anne-Flore,"We only saw Corinne and she was very nice and helpful! The room is big and very nicely furnished with lots of guide books about Seattle that were very helpful to us. Plus very clean!

Beware there are 2 small dogs and 1 big one, but they keep them with them at night in their bedroom so you can go to the bathroom without worrying.

218741,7146755,2013-09-08,7596017,Melissa,"We enjoyed Corinne and Tom's hospitality very much. Their space is comfortable and the location is great, great bus access to Seattle"
218741,7312676,2013-09-15,8490209,James,Fantastic experience! Tom and Corrine were very warm and made us feel right at home. They were also very helpful in telling us about the city. We would highly recommend staying with them.
218741,7337188,2013-09-16,5149551,Janice,Nice room and great price.  Bed and linens were really comfy.  I so appreciate cotton sheets!  Good maps and Seattle tourist info including bus schedules which would be nice for those who need it. Everything was spotless and there was a large TV room with a comfy couch next to our room in the basement.  Nice hosts and we enjoyed the coffee made for us in the morning.  The evening that we were there the hosts were gone. The three dogs take there guard duty seriously. They bark at passerby's on the street and bark when you come in and when you come upstairs until they become accustomed to your presence. This was okay with us but might be a problem for some folks.  
218741,7378603,2013-09-17,8016293,Elliot,BIG basement bedroom! Plenty of privacy! Coffee in the morning! Pretty cool! Hosts were SOOOOOOOOOOOOO nice!!!!!!! P.S cute doggies!
218741,7450330,2013-09-20,8873037,John,"This was my first Airbnb experience so I don't have any comparisons, however it was very positive and the type of travel experience I envisioned. Corinne's house is located in a suburb, but well serviced by the local bus to the heart of Seattle {under 1/2 hour}. Its about a 20 minute walk to downtown Ballard which is very happening. I had a comfortable stay and Corinne was very personable and helpful.If you aren't at ease with dogs, three, try elsewhere, but I'll go back to Corinne's on my next visit to Seattle."
218741,7751914,2013-10-01,4265187,Emilie,"Corinne and Tom were incredible hosts! Staying with them while I got to know Seattle and searched for apartments was the best way to transition to a new city. They were so helpful with neighborhood  recommendations in addition to being super flexible with move in and move out dates. The room was tidy, quiet and felt very separate from the rest of house. In general, a great first experience in Seattle. "
218741,7844456,2013-10-05,8304659,Mary,"I stayed with Corinne and Tom after my other plans fell through, and I'm so glad I did!  My only regret was that it was such a quick trip.  Their house was lovely and the room itself was cozy and quiet.  I only got a chance to glance at the bookshelf in the room but I loved that they had all sorts of info on Seattle, as well as some books about Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana. Corinne and Tom were so gracious and welcoming even though they were getting ready for a night out when I arrived.  And the dogs were cute and hilarious... It was nice to get some puppy love. I would definitely stay here again on future trips to Seattle!"
218741,7866426,2013-10-06,9095159,Cathy,"Corinne and Tom were wonderful and the space was very private and quiet. They are very friendly and accommodating and although I was only there one night, I enjoyed my stay very much. The neighborhood is lovely and very walkable, and Corinne and Tom are knowledgable hosts, and the dogs are very cute! I recommend them without hesitation and would easily stay with them again."
218741,7934719,2013-10-08,1410008,Min-Young,"Great experience! Corinne and Tom were very warm and welcoming. The room was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Would definitely consider staying over again."
218741,8202886,2013-10-20,318952,Edwin,"Corinne and Tom were such great hosts. They are super helpful and friendly. One of the best AirBnB experiences in Seattle to-date!
The room was extra clean and comfy. The location was pretty close to Ballard. Would definitely stay again."
218741,8244923,2013-10-21,3711333,Geordie,"I'll echo everything else that has been said about this listing. It is a wonderfully quiet and private space. The room is in the basement separate from the main house and it is a great spot for a good night's sleep. The bed really is as comfortable as everyone touts it to be.

Corrine and Tom were very welcoming and I would recommend them as hosts for anyone looking to visit the area."
218741,8357518,2013-10-27,374347,Jessica,"We very much enjoyed our very brief stay at Corrine and Tom's! The space in their lovely house was private, clean, and comfy. We could walk to our cooking class at Delancey, it was even walkable to the other central part of Ballard, and parking was easy. We will definitely come again, hopefully for longer next time! Thanks greatly for your hospitality, Corrine and Tom!"
218741,8400952,2013-10-28,9515967,Lauren,"Corrine and Tom were incredibly warm and welcoming and went to so many lengths to ensure we felt at home. The room we stayed in was private, cozy and quiet and stocked full of helpful information about Ballard, Seattle and the surrounding areas--not to mention a great library of books that we took advantage of!

We really enjoyed chatting with them in the morning over the delicious coffee they offered us and loved petting their cute doggies. 

I really fell in love with Ballard while we stayed there. Corrine and Tom's home is just a short walk to all the great restaurants, bars, cafes and boutiques that Ballard is home to. I would definitely stay with them again if we go back!!"
218741,8594789,2013-11-06,9772242,Corinne,The room and host were delightful and exactly as the post described. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle for a few days!
218741,8649385,2013-11-10,9853250,Bev,"My one-night stay with Tom and Corinne was wonderful!  They have thought of everything a traveler could want - guide books, multiple mirrors, plenty of drawer space (if I was staying longer), rack for hanging clothes, fridge/microwave, coffee in the morning and much more.  Very kind and accommodating couple.  Very charming house, interesting books and fun art, great location, cute and well-behaved dogs - I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my first airbnb stay!"
218741,9279363,2013-12-17,10568046,Cary,"Corinne & Tom were wonderful hosts and made my first airbnb experience a pleasurable one.  Helpful and hospitable hosts, great location, friendly and fun group of pups, parking was easy, everything was positive."
218741,9373068,2013-12-24,2672975,Jessica,Loved staying with Corinne and Tom again! :)
218741,10014271,2014-01-25,2206841,Blake,It was great staying with Corinne and Tom.  They were very accommodating.  And also their dogs are all really sweet.
218741,10259883,2014-02-10,8352271,Les,"Corinne was so fabulous about communications, and working with my flight delays. Their home is beautiful and cheery. Highly recommended."
218741,10871559,2014-03-10,12513761,Casey,"My friend and I stayed at Corinne's home for one night and it was great! The room was very private and very cozy. The bed was super comfortable, and the bathroom was newly redone and beautiful! Corinne was super accommodating and gave us a lot of suggestions on places to check out in Ballard. We had a wonderful time! "
218741,11196478,2014-03-24,5196982,Lynette,"Staying with Corrine in Seattle was awesome! Corrine is very thoughtful, and even with my miscommunication about check in (totally my fault) she was very understanding. The private entrance to the room was easy to find and provided plenty of privacy. The location is wonderful, near all of the fabulous things in Ballard, including Honore Bakery (yummy!) We had the pleasure of meeting Corrine the next morning during our checkout, along with her adorable dogs. We would definitely stay here again the next time we are in Seattle. =)"
218741,11255895,2014-03-26,13353727,Corey,"Corinne and Tom are great hosts, and I really enjoyed their space. A very comfortable room, great location, a wonderful experience. They provided maps and tips for the city, which were a great help in finding my way around and places to eat/visit. Will definitely check them out again when I head back to Seattle. "
218741,11334166,2014-03-30,13243857,Natasha,Corrine and her husband were wonderful hosts. Very clean and cozy accommodations. Ballard is a neat neighborhood and close to downtown. 
218741,11418308,2014-04-01,3174747,Sal,"Corinne was a warm and inviting host and her personal touches to enliven the space were found everywhere.  And, wow, the new private bathroom is awesome.  We found getting around Seattle was easy from this Ballard site and it was nice coming back to a 'less traveled' area after a day in the city.  Looking forward to meeting Tom next visit.  Thanks Corinne.
Sal & Jim

218741,11572778,2014-04-07,4017036,Connie,"The space was fantastic!  Corinne has a great eye for decor and has created a space that is aesthetically pleasing and entertaining.  She has thought of every possible need for the traveler and provided appropriately.  Very hospitable and friendly as her four legged friends are great greeters. The room is very clean, inviting and private.  I would definitely contact Corinne to request another stay."
218741,11723170,2014-04-13,13649301,Selena,"This was my first booking through AirBnB, so I appreciated Corinne's timely and clear communication with me.  Corinne and Tom were friendly and welcoming hosts.  The house is located in a quiet neighbourhood and is close to a bus stop, which made travel to downtown Seattle very convenient.  The guest suite was clean and comfortable.  The bathroom was immaculate.  My friend and I definitely enjoyed our stay here.  "
218741,11780408,2014-04-14,9999226,Jess,"Corinne and Tom's basement guest space is just fabulous. So cozy and welcoming, with every thoughtful touch. Comfortable bed, well-stocked kitchenette, full bathroom with a great shower head and toiletries provided, etc. A livingroom space is also included, complete with board games, seattle guides, TV and a pretty fish tank! 

The neighborhood is quiet, clean, very walkable and close to several little cafés, pubs, etc. Corinne created a helpful list of places with descriptions that is available for reference in the bedroom. 

Our stay there was perfect and the care Corinne and Tom put into their guests' comfort and enjoyment is very evident! Thanks, guys!"
218741,11877550,2014-04-17,13576364,Aleksei,"This was our first Airbnb experience and it was great! Corinne was a perfect host and very helpful. Her binder of restaurants and nano-breweries was spot on. The bed was warm and cozy, especially the electric blanket, and the private shower was perfect. Ballard is a beautiful little neightbourhood, so close to Seattle to be convenient, yet filled with great little restaurants and coffee shops you'd never need to leave. My wife and I would definitely stay here again. "
218741,11909604,2014-04-18,5519734,Sharon,"Corrine and Tom were very friendly and welcoming. They were careful to give us great instructions on arriving at their home, and checking with us to see if we needed anything. Corinne definitely has a heart for hospitality.......every amenity we could think of (and more) were provided, including fresh fruit. The space was comfortable and private. We will happily stay there again!"
218741,11976445,2014-04-20,14205700,Brittany,"Corinne was our first Airbnb host and we couldn't be happier with our stay!  Our room was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean with the comfiest bed and heated blanket!  She was so kind to have some fruit in the kitchenette waiting for us as well as a beautifully clean private bathroom stocked with very nice toiletries! She was very accommodating to have our pup stay the night and was so kind to let him out and give him some snuggles and water while we were out! She was ready with wonderful recommendations for neighborhood eats, one place we could even bring our dog too! 
Now we feel like we have a home in Seattle to return to whenever we plan our next trip!"
218741,12213618,2014-04-26,11857004,Alice,"My mother, my son and I had a wonderful stay with Corinne. Her and her husband were so welcoming and were so sweet to us in our time of need when poor mother wasn't well. The basement is cosy and sweet and has everything you could need. There is lots of information in the room about Seattle and the bus into town is so close. We had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend it."
218741,12304390,2014-04-28,12749359,Jiayi,"This is a nice room in Seattle. We have enjoy the private space and cleaning room, and the washroom is so new. The host is so nice too and j love his two little dogs. Haha. "
218741,12447393,2014-05-02,332132,Lisa,"Wonderful stay with Corrine and Tom. I had the whole basement to myself, and the house and yard are lovely. "
218741,12664472,2014-05-07,5724404,Ruth,"Corinne and her husband were very pleasant and provided us with a pleasant place to stay. The neighborhood had some nice little eateries.  Ballard, which is a long walk or short drive had some very good places to eat.  The bed was very comfortable.  There was also a comfy couch to relax on.  There was a small heater which we used to take the chill out the Seattle air."
218741,13360941,2014-05-26,14562909,Allison,"We only spent one night, but the space was really great, well-decorated and comfortable and with TONS of local information.  Corinne was very welcoming.  Also, if you're planning on going car-free, it's a great location.  The bus line just a few blocks away (I think it's the 15?) will take you all the way downtown in less than half an hour.  You can also walk to some great spots in downtown Ballard, plus there are a few really fun local spots.  We hope to stay there again."
218741,13773466,2014-06-03,245394,Celeste,"Staying with Corinne was convenient and comfortable! She accommodated a very last minute request and although I only met her the morning I left, she was very responsive and answered any and all questions I had during my stay. The accommodations were very clean and comfortable, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
218741,13917374,2014-06-08,9230249,Kathleen," Two nights of comfort in an artfully decorated, and homey environment,  with plenty of privacy and any ammenity that I might have needed.  Corinne was the sweetest of hosts, very helpful, accommodating, and flexible.  I highly recommend this listing, and hope that I can stay here again."
218741,14098749,2014-06-11,10151276,Mathieu,"Corinne's room in Ballard is the perfect getaway from the city. It is a 20-minute walk from the main streets of Ballard, and the room is lovely. Corinne made sure I had everything I needed - and the room also comes with essential kitchen utensils (coffee-maker, fridge...) so that's a plus. I absolutely recommend this place !"
218741,14145859,2014-06-13,2621812,Karen,"Corrine was very warm and welcoming, made us feel quite at home. She was kind enough to let us leave our bags when our flight came in early. We weren't around much to visit with her, but the room was more than we expected. We loved the extra little amenities like the provided laptop, lavender bath products, little kitchenette, and entertainment area. Location was perfect and everything with spic and span. Will def recommend or stay here again!"
218741,14616418,2014-06-23,15152012,Priscilla,"Host made me feel at home for beginning until I left. Went over and above helping with tools to put furniture together with adult daughter who recently moved to Ballard, provided much needed ice and holistic healing after a minor accident right as I was leaving. Very quiet neighborhood with wonderful area to exercise. Beautiful Sunset Park on 75th street w/in a mile walk offered breathtaking view of Puget Sound & Olympus Mountain Range."
218741,15311058,2014-07-07,14250043,Rachel,"We had a wonderful time with this host.  The room was very nice, the neighborhood convenient to all we were doing and in general was a quiet neighborhood.   They did a very nice job at making us feel welcomed and they have developed a very nice space for people to stay in.  I highly recommend them as hosts."
218741,15557472,2014-07-11,17622601,Geoffrey,Corinne made my first airbnb experience a wonderful one. She was friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and spacious. My wife and I spent one night there and hopefully we can spend more nights there. 
218741,16549362,2014-07-29,15479002,Pier,"Aardige verhuurster en prima abonnement in Ballard. 
Het was soms iets gehorig, maar we hebben prima geslapen.
Het kunnen ontbijten in de tuin in de zon was heerlijk!!!!"
218741,16972286,2014-08-05,12467861,Marie,"Nice stay at Corinne's place : the room is well decorated and quiet big, and so is the bathroom. We could use the couch is the media room  so it was perfect. The garden is very nice too, we could enjoy a meal since Corinne let us use her kitchen, which was very kind of her. We didn't have much interaction with our hosts however but they provide written information in the room. The home is a bit far away from the center of Ballard or other places in Seattle, if you don't have a car and to take common transportation as we did (Seattle is built a several hills, so not that easy to walk from any places!). There was no fruits or cereals as mentionned in the description, but there was coffee and tea."
218741,18001781,2014-08-20,4500717,Holly,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in Ballard with Corrine and Tom.
They went out of their way to make sure every detail was perfect.  I was very comfortable, had plenty of privacy, lots of space and was very happy with the residence."
218741,18235604,2014-08-24,15811043,Mac,"Liked the space, great new bathroom. Good bed.
Enjoyed a sunny Seattle lounging in the back yard
reading and recouping from our travels.
""downtown"" Ballard is a fun and interesting place
to explore."
218741,19034544,2014-09-05,18248921,Jill,"Great place to rest our heads at night while we explored Ballard and Seattle during the day. It was an easy walk to downtown Ballard and public transportation was close by (though we didn't use it during our stay). The bed was extremely comfortable and we appreciated the oatmeal, mini-fridge, and microwave. There were also lots of nice little touches, e.g., eye mask/ear plugs, chocolates on the pillow, facial cleanser pads, etc. It definitely felt like a home away from home. All in all it was a great first experience with airbnb. "
218741,19503197,2014-09-13,20932479,Jen,"Cute and cozy!  There was a big spider on the wall when I was about to sleep but other than that this was a nice place. (spiders are part of nature and are bound to be in houses so this is not a negative comment!) Also the room has a low ceiling but luckily I'm vertically challenged (I'm 5ft) so this didn't bother me. For reference, I was able to touch the ceiling on my tip toes. Overall, I'd recommend this place."
218741,21116720,2014-10-11,2262527,Haeyoung,"Corinne and Tom were both so accommodating and Corinne especially was so delightful to talk to. I needed a place to stay with my puppy Sunny who is a 4 months old labradoodle and Corinne replied back in minutes and were so flexible with me. When I got to their place, I walked into a very cute backyard and I had a separate entry way into my room area. It felt very private and almost felt like I had a whole place, not a room. The place was extremely clean and the room was equipped with all kinds of helpful information around my way of town. I felt the hosts' efforts in little details of the house so that their guests felt comfortable. While my dog was not allowed in the actual room that I stayed in, it was no problem because I brought a crate and my puppy still stayed close to me outside the door. While I was out with friends for dinner, Corinne and her husband were nice enough to take care of Sunny. They took her out for potty breaks and played with her. I felt very comfortable the whole time and felt the location was also excellent. Ballard ave. was full of cute stores and restaurants. I really enjoyed my time there over the actual dt Seattle. I would recommend their place in Seattle. Thanks Corinne and Tom. "
218741,21729779,2014-10-22,63815,Ruth,Ballard is one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. Was great to find Corrine and Tom's place. Very comfortable and Corrine was great at showing me the features of her place. 
218741,22614128,2014-11-10,1649023,Lauren,"Corinne and Tom's place was lovely and they had a ton of books on Seattle as well as a binder full of restaurant recommendations that definitely came in handy.  I didn't have many interactions with them  (aside from one nice chat with Corinne) but they definitely seemed available if needed. The room is in the basement and the ceiling is a bit low down there, which wasn't a problem at all for me but if you're quite tall, you might have to duck."
218741,23188922,2014-11-24,23832081,Eva,"Corienne and Tom's beautiful furnished basement was so much lovelier than either my boyfriend or I expected. The living space was large, comfortable, and completely cozy. We slept so well in their large bedroom and enjoyed all of the little perks of the space (small kitchenette, beautiful bathroom, large living room) as well as the adorable personal touches that added to the laid-back character of the entire Ballard area of Seattle. It was charming and absolutely perfect; our hosts were kind, helpful, and extremely accommodating to our every need. We plan to be back again, and we are so thankful our first Air B&B experience was beyond our expectations. Thank you again, Corienne and Tom!"
218741,23231834,2014-11-25,3023721,Jan,Tom and Corinne were great hosts and I would love to be back! The room was immaculate and equipped with everything I needed for the short stay. 
218741,23439183,2014-12-01,22584008,Lani,"It was a lovely stay!  Even though we arrived very late, our hostess came to greet us and give us a quick tour when she heard us come in the door using our own security code. She even cleaned the breakfast area each day and left us fruit once!  When it snowed, she contacted us and let us know where salt for the driveway was - very thoughtful."
218741,23954814,2014-12-15,17020589,Jamie,"Quite possibly the best AirBnB experience you will ever get. The space that Tom & Corinne have created has more features than you could ask for, we could have happily stayed for weeks. Keep up the good work!"
218741,24412706,2014-12-28,14897503,Linda,The rooms were spotless and the hosts had a little Christmas tree in my room and home baked cookies one day. The location was perfect and the space was quiet and private.
218741,24515206,2014-12-29,7647211,Larry,"Perfect landing spot for me. Tom greeted me at my car, helped with my luggage and made sure I was fully familiar with the room. Actually the entire lower level. Wonderful location, very comfortable, spacious and great amenities. Would stay again without hesitation."
218741,27023107,2015-02-23,9021453,Kallie,"Corrine was extremely warm and welcoming towards us. The listing exceeded our expectations and I found the space to be eclectic, fun, clean, and warm. We would definitely recommend staying with Corrine and Tom. they were more than accommodating :)"
218741,27864817,2015-03-13,29125989,Christy,"Perfectly comfortable with every amenity we needed. The space was clean, and cozy and just what we had hoped for. Thank you!"
218741,29651785,2015-04-10,30820255,Jen,"Corinne and Tom have created a very comfortable place for any traveler.  The neighborhood is charming, the home is decorated with local class and we were overjoyed to get a good night sleep.  The heart of Ballard is very close by so we were able to have a fabulous dinner and catch a show at a local club.  This was our first time using Airbnb, so we were nervous, but when we entered the home we were immediately put at ease by how clean and thoughtful the space was for guests.  There were even chocolates on our pillow!  It was an all around delightful and memorable stay in Seattle.   "
218741,29802176,2015-04-12,7231149,Braxton,"Corinne's room/basement was a great escape. It's a great cozy escape in the middle of a quiet neighborhood that my wife and I really enjoyed staying in. I'd highly recommend this place to others. 

There was some noise from their dogs running around upstairs in the evening, but other than that it was perfect night away."
218741,29942684,2015-04-14,30293888,Connie,"Chocolates on the pillow. Spotlessly clean, clear instructions. Beautiful gardens!!1 Our privacy was totally respected. Look forward to staying again.

"
218741,30239905,2015-04-19,30293888,Connie,We returned to Corrine and Tom's house for one last night before our departure flight back to Madison...We were gone only 4 nights and I should have put a note on the bed not to change the sheets! Everything perfect once more. Tom caught us as we were leaving to make our acquaintance a really great guy! We will be back! My daughter and her boyfriend will be recommending Corinne and Tom's place to their other out of town visitors...Thanks again!
218741,32943023,2015-05-23,7465639,Al,"Our hosts, Corinne and Tom were very communicative before we arrived.  A very thorough information sheet was provided with directions and access to the room.   
Tom met us as we arrived and gave us a perfect tour of the space and the amenities.  ""Here's how to use the media center"" They even provided a tablet for internet had we not had one!
We were so impressed!  More than a room, it felt like a relaxing place to return to at the end of our busy days!  
They provide fixings for coffee, tea, instant oatmeal and you put the dishes in a tub and they washed them!
Very nice bath facility.
A pleasant surprise was a large basement room with a TV, wonderful decor and fascinating knick-knacks.
The bedroom was just as you see it, a nice rack to hang clothes on, the bed was comfortable and we awoke rested!
They checked in with us each morning to make sure all was well, which indeed it was.   We plan to return and will suggest the place to our family when they go visit our son in Ballard."
218741,33459024,2015-05-28,32630448,Lymarie,"Corinne+Tom are wonderful hosts and they made us feel at home since we got there and until we left. Corinne+Tom's place is a beautiful, cozy apartment in Ballard (which is an awesome neighborhood). The apartment is conveniently located close to Downtown Seattle and getting there in public transportation was very easy. Corinne+Tom also gave us tips and recommendations around Ballard and we were pleased to learn that Ballard is host to many excellent restaurants, bars and entertainment stores in walking distance. In all, it was a wonderful experience."
218741,33633487,2015-05-30,34274429,Sally,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.  The room is very private, clean and comfortable.  It had all the amenities I needed plus more.  My host was friendly and welcoming.  The neighborhood  is very nice and near restaurants and a great bakery.  I highly recommend this listing!"
