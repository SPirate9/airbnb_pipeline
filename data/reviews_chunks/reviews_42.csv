703058,21972034,2014-10-27,4754332,Adam,"My family and girlfriend stayed at Craig's craftsman home for a long weekend. We had a wonderful time, and I do believe this is one of the best finds in the neighborhood. Craig was extremely knowledgeable about his city, and recommended some amazing neighborhoods and restaurants. The home was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the house was stocked with tiny comforts that gave it lots of character. I'd recommend Craig's place to anyone wanting an authentic Seattle experience. "
703058,23357730,2014-11-30,7776938,Katherine,This neighborhood is quiet and close to Wallingford and Fremont.
703058,24539508,2014-12-30,2991479,Ruth,"Craig was very welcoming and showed us around the house when we arrived. The house is cute and cozy (and very well taken care of). Love the old-time kitchen! Very nice neighborhood, and coffee and muffins are a short walk away.

We would gladly come back.
"
703058,24740793,2015-01-02,1820523,Christopher,"Friendly, informative host gave the tour and left us happily at this nice Wallingford home. New Year's Eve fireworks visible from the front deck and nice furnishings made this a great place to stay."
703058,25289582,2015-01-11,10432911,Robert,"Craig was very accommodating and provided lots of info about Seattle.

Very comfortable house located optimally between the University district & downtown."
703058,25760931,2015-01-25,16749313,Annette,"This is a great place to base a stay in Seattle.  Craig greeted me personally and showed me around--he had even stocked a few supplies so that my husband and I could have coffee first thing in the morning.  Our entire stay continued to be wonderful--the house is in a great location just up from Gas Works Park and within walking distance to Fremont and much of Wallingford which we took advantage of during our stay.   And of course, there are countless great coffee shops to try around within walking distance as well."
703058,26532764,2015-02-15,5977784,Matthew,"Craig was a wonderful host.  He was flexible and kind.  We loved the property.  It was in a great neighborhood, only a short walk from great dining options (Whale Wins and Joule), a fun local brewery (Fremont Brewery), the Gasworks park, and the University of Washington campus.  I also really appreciated the use of his Netflix account to fill the wee morning hours when my 6-month old was adjusting to the 12-hour time difference.  I couldn't have picked a better place for me and my family to stay during our week in Seattle."
703058,26861554,2015-02-21,25007430,Linda,We loved the house. Craig is a very thoughtful host! Thank you for allowing us to stay in your house!
703058,31102650,2015-05-02,28504053,Susan & Paul,"Craig was timely, helpful, and provided lots of suggestions.  The home was as described, very quiet, and a perfect and accessible location.  The best part was ""living""in the Wallingford community, and the true Seattle experience the home provided us.  One of a kind vacation, and would highly recommend for anyone who wants to experience Seattle like a ""Local""."
703058,33071881,2015-05-25,1096268,John,"Craig met us at the door and kicked off a most pleasant stay in Seattle. His greeting matched the lodging; warm, comfortable, and without a hint of pretension. The house was conveniently located to a 24-hour supermarket and the Fremont neighbourhood. Craig was very helpful and provided a number of suggestions of places to visit. The backyard was a nice place to hang out after a long day (nicely gardened). "
703058,34693198,2015-06-11,554916,Diane,"I have stayed at many Airbnb's and Craig has been the best host I've had.  He makes us feel very much at home each time.  This was our third stay at True Wallingford Craftsman and we hope to come back.
He went out of his way to be helpful to us.  
The place itself is lovely, very homey and a wonderful place to be.
I always feel very much at home there.  The neighborhood is great, beautiful streets with yards full of flowers, as this place is as well.
There is shopping in walking distance and restaurants.  It's a great place, with a very nice host."
703058,35194838,2015-06-16,19582558,Rebecca,My family loved staying at Craig's house! He was very warm and shared numerous great suggestions in the area. The house was clean and very unique and in a perfect location! They'd stay again!
703058,35546382,2015-06-20,14994362,Rochelle,We had a wonderful experience. Craig met us at the house and made us feel welcome and gave a tour of the house and made recommendations for the city. Location was excellent and the house was comfortable and adorable! 
703058,36000524,2015-06-24,26739005,Diane,"Craig met us upon our arrival and made us feel at home. Beautiful house on a quiet street near downtown Seattle. Clean and comfortable with a lovely backyard garden. Located near restaurants, a bakery and stores. To top it off it has a perfect view of the Seattle skyline!  Craig is a wonderful host and always available for questions.  "
703058,36943975,2015-07-03,7985949,Amanda,"Lovely house, great neighborhood, and friendly, helpful host. My family couldn't have asked for a better place for our Seattle stay. The house is clean, comfortable, and well supplied. Craig was helpful and responsive throughout the entire process, from booking to greeting us there to answering questions during our stay."
703058,37135326,2015-07-05,5251712,Alex,"What an incredible place the True Wallingford was and what an incredible host Craig was. Upon arrival Craig spent almost 45 minutes with us, not only taking us through the home, but also providing such incredible information on the neighborhood, restaurants, sites etc... it truly made for a great stay.

The home itself was even better than we had expected. Immaculate, comfortable, great location and exactly what we were looking for. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone and everyone. The price you are paying for the accommodations was worth every cent!!

Thanks to Craig and Molly and we will be back!"
703058,38103128,2015-07-13,14976104,Valerie,"Craig was an excellent host for my family, who were visiting from New Jersey.  The house was exactly as advertised, clean, well-equipped, and centrally located.  The backyard porch was especially great for end of day card playing.  Thanks again Craig!"
703058,38586467,2015-07-17,30078098,Adrienne,"Craig was an absolute delight to deal with!  He was full of helpful suggestions and always available to help out.  I love antiques and all things vintage, and this house definitely did not disappoint.  It was charming and bright with lots of personality.  My mom and I enjoyed spending lots of time on the front porch.  Craig suggested a restaurant (that has a bar) less than a 2 minute walk away which was great when we wanted an adult beverage.  The view from Wallingford Avenue is absolutely spectacular - the Seattle skyline is what you'll see.  The location is perfect with a short ten minute ride to downtown Seattle for those interested in seeing all that it has to offer.  Overall, I enjoyed my stay - thanks for everything Craig!"
703058,43015196,2015-08-17,25102271,Martin,This is a  wonderful place in a nice Seattle neighborhood.  Greg is a great host. He is an experienced traveler himself and will make sure that your visit to Seattle is awesome. We had everything we needed and loved the house. Thank you. We will definitely be back.
703058,44103859,2015-08-24,21898757,Brad,"We were delighted with the experience of spending a week in this lovely house. The interior is charming and well suited for up to four travelers, even to the extent of having kitchen and dining facilities to allow you to fix a nice dinner if you wanted. But with the quality and variety of restaurants available within a ten block radius, who needs to? The neighborhood is quiet, parking not bad, and the view across Lake Union to downtown Seattle than you can have just a few feet from the front door is stunning. Having stayed in plenty of Seattle hotels, I can say that you won't find anything this nice in the North End for this price."
703058,45925008,2015-09-07,12317122,Eric,"Craig is an awesome and welcoming host; he provided a tour of the house, insights on the neighborhood and provided coffee and snacks -  all of which made me feel very comfortable in his home.  Wallingford is a very safe neighborhood within walking distance to some great restaurants and very convenient access to the rest of Seattle.  Craig's place is very clean and the house is adorable as portrayed in the photos.  I highly recommend staying here if you are traveling to Seattle."
703058,46467339,2015-09-11,31885062,Leanne,"The house was just as described - very cute and had everything we needed.  Craig was a great host that made us feel very welcome and it was nice to see how excited he was to share his city. Great location for parks, playgrounds, restaurants, etc.  I would stay here again!"
703058,46872893,2015-09-14,32082562,Amy,"An absolutely great house in a wonderful location!!!! How can you beat a short walk to a park with awesome views of Seattle including the Space Needle?! Craig really spent time and care in his suggestions,  all of which we loved. Close to cheap and high end eats as well as music & art.  We loved the backyard garden with seating as well. We would go back in a heart beat!"
703058,47618365,2015-09-21,3520508,Jim,"This was second time staying at Craig and Molly's lovely Wallingford house.  It's very well equipped--all you really need and then some-- and located in a terrific neighborhood, 10 minutes from Seattle's downtown.   Highly recommended!"
703058,48674684,2015-09-28,30990202,Calliope,"Thank you for a lovely Seattle experience, this was our first time to this part of the world and you made us feel very welcome.  Thanks for the local knowledge and taking the time to get us organised when we first arrived."
703058,50876271,2015-10-15,45478415,Adrienne,The house was comfortable and pleasant. Craig was very knowledgeable about the area and gave us information on places to visit. 
703058,51127927,2015-10-18,8538340,New,"We truly enjoyed staying at this charming house in Wallingford. We were able to walk to local restaurants, bars, cafes, and shopping and Craig was very helpful with his recommendations. The house was clean and organized with plenty of extra space to put away our things during our stay. We would love to stay here again and highly recommend it!"
703058,51908555,2015-10-25,6340539,Leila,"A wonderful stay! The house is so cozy, comfy, homey! My mom and I loved staying here. It was chilly outside, but nice and warm in the house! The home is located within walking distance from Fremont shops and Wallingford shops. Everything about the house is great, and I almost don't want to say that because I want it to be available next time I come to Seattle! There is a lot of character to the house and items inside, and many original Craftsman details. The floors are a little squeaky, but its kind of cute! The house was quiet despite construction going on across the street.  And Craig was fabulous when he let us in and showed us around the house. He even left bananas, yogurt and coffee for us! The bananas were perfect because I was starving and needed a snack. Craig was great, the house was great, and he neighborhood was great too. Excellent value for this place, and great communication from Craig. Probably my favorite airbnb stay so far! "
703058,57890343,2015-12-30,6083389,Marian,We had a wonderful time at Craig's craftsman.  The house was beautiful and exactly as pictured.  The locations was perfect for our trip.  Craig was very friendly; he gave us a helpful introduction and was quite knowledgeable about Seattle.  
7772661,56997184,2015-12-20,3636402,Bruce,"We rented this cool cozy cottage for one night on the way to explore Washington. Couldn’t have had a better, easier, more accommodating stay! A quiet and cozy two story cottage house, cleverly designed and thought out. There is a little kitchen, bath and sitting area with a deck on the lower level and upstairs is sleeping with a nice comfortable bed.  Manny and Michael are gracious hosts who couldn’t have been more helpful! Also, Michael is a certified massage therapist who has a studio in the main house. Just love it here, the neighborhood is beautiful, great bakery up the street. I look forward to my trip back to stay this summer, I didn't want to leave!  :)"
7772661,57102234,2015-12-21,4418610,Kevin,"Mike and Manny were outstanding hosts.  They have an awesome little house that's right on a bus line that's accessible to everything.  The bedroom also has a water view of the Puget Sound.  

The space is cool and comfortable and perfect for a few days in the city. 

Mike also offers massages in his home studio.  The massage was awesome and recommended if you have the time.

7518316,45154989,2015-08-31,1268306,Albert,"Very nice and clean apartment in a quiet neighborhood with easy walking access to more lively areas. Good bus access only a few blocks away too. The unit was very comfortable and well stocked with bathroom (website hidden) and fruit in the fridge was also a nice touch. Apple TV and wifi worked great.

Athena was a friendly host who was easy to reach over email or text. She was welcoming and very helpful with answering questions."
7518316,46811797,2015-09-13,38017590,Andrew,"Good location within walking distance to good restaurants and nightlife, yet on a very peaceful and quiet street. Apartment was extremely clean. Athena was very responsive despite being out of the country during our stay. Overall excellent deal."

2492143,14932868,2014-06-29,3818796,Dion,"I enjoyed my stay at Mari's. She was a great host, very friendly and helpful. I recommend this stop for anyone who wants to experience a real neighborhood in Seattle. "
2492143,15297211,2014-07-06,12325014,Itsik,"Mari is nice but not the accomodation
We were promised a private bath but we had to share it with another couple and the shower is tiny and the door lock was broken
Does bnb means bed and breakfast
There was not even a coffee 
"
2492143,15783895,2014-07-15,16679765,Rusten,"Mari was great!! Room was exactly as described! Mari is very helpful with passing on her knowledge about the area, and even effective transportation to get around (if you don't have a car). Great art pieces to go with it all! "
2492143,16578825,2014-07-29,10838114,Mark,Mari was amazing! Let's me and my wife come see the room before my aunt came to town and she was great!!! The room was immaculate and privacy was incredible highly recommend to stay here when in Seattle!
2492143,17902949,2014-08-18,19801958,Brandon,Mari was very welcoming and it was everything as advertised. I would definitely stay with Mari again. 
2492143,18205700,2014-08-23,5761115,Cory,"The place was great. It was pretty close to downtown, but quiet enough to be relaxing and high on a hill with nice views. Unfortunately, I wasn't around enough to meet Mari, though."
2492143,18861589,2014-09-01,20648463,Nicole,"We had a very good experience at Mari's (website hidden) is clean, in a great location and Mari herself was very helpful and friendly. Thank you!"
2492143,20550899,2014-10-01,13936109,Boyd,"The accommodations were essentially as described.  The hostess was friendly and gracious.  The neighborhood seemed very safe, and the location is convenient to bus stops with connections to anywhere in the Seattle area.  "
2492143,28770390,2015-03-29,30076155,Edward,Mari was a great host and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The location is very safe and has easy access to downtown via public transportation. The place itself was very private (including its own separate entrance) and had plenty of space.

2492143,33454004,2015-05-28,32296478,Carolyn,Mari was an exceptional hostess and very warm and friendly.  We enjoyed talking with her and staying at her home.

2492143,33877923,2015-06-01,34390067,Richard,"Mari was great, the room comfortable and clean with a private entrance through a wonderful little courtyard. Mari has a terrific setup, is welcoming and makes everything run smoothly. You can't ask for more."

If staying in Seattle, I definitely recommend staying here! "
2492143,41666418,2015-08-08,6547943,Sheila,"Mari was a great host. Friendly and accommodating. Also, couldn't recommend Mari's place enough. In addition to beautiful and private lodgings on a separate level of the house, her neighborhood looms above the city and offers an incredible view of Seattle. If we had more time, I would have taken advantage of her charming backyard patio, too."
2492143,43463977,2015-08-19,41649391,David,This was my first experience with airbnb. Mari has set the standard very high. The downstairs was very clean and tidy. The bedroom was perfect with a very comfortable bed. Mari was very friendly and helpful. I wanted to go for a run and she suggested to jog to discovery park. It was full of amazing views of the Puget Sound and you could follow the trails all the way to the beach and lighthouse. I hope to return soon again. 
2492143,50648364,2015-10-13,4811291,Peter,"We had a very enjoyable weekend at Mari's, the room was spacious, the bed very comfortable, and the kitchenette was very practical. The downstairs area is separate from the rest of the house, and consequently private. The weather didn't permit it, but the back yard has a cool deck and in sunny weather could be enjoyable.
The house is located on a hill, and you must park your car in either the upper road, or the lower, and walk half a block. This was not an issue for us."

Hood from his living room.  And, the views from the roof top are fabulous.  The bed was super comfy, decor is great and perfect for our trip.  

The neighborhood is delightful with plenty of coffee shops, cafes, restaurants, clubs and bars.  We also walked downtown and saw Pikes Place market and shopped.  

We truly had a great time at his places and James was a terrific host. "
7884782,44059064,2015-08-23,33938347,Valerie,"Simply put, Stay Here.  The place was fantastic - very neat and clean.  On the first day, we took a leisurely stroll down Pike to take in the sights and ended at Pike Place Market.  After the first day, we utilized Uber to get around the city which was very convenient.  James was a wonderful host and was very responsive both via text and through the Airbnb app.  James made us feel as if we were staying at an old friend's place and I would highly recommend this home."

His apartment is gorgeous and super clean. The location is great. There is a 24 hours supermarket near by and a lot of restaurants. The apartment is equipped with everything I needed. I would stay there again!
7884782,48781229,2015-09-28,43103288,Patricia," James is a wonderful host. He responds quickly to your request for a reservation and to any questions that come up along the way. For us, this included a great list of dining options, how to get around town and places to see that fit into our timeline. The first night, we were almost two hours late getting to the apartment while waiting for a ride from our friend, but James was quick to accommodate and patiently walked us through what to do to gain access. The apartment is in a vibrant and safe location, is very new and clean, and has everything you need for a stay in the city. Important to us, too,  is that the bed is very comfortable so no problems getting a great night's sleep. If you are energetic like we were, you can walk everywhere from here. We walked to Pike's market, Belltown, the Space Needle and Chihully, and the ferry to Bainbridge Island. We also took advantage of the excellent local eateries for our meals, which offer fresh and creative dishes. Overall, this was a great area to stage our first foray into Seattle. "
7884782,49177232,2015-10-01,44997159,Mark,"James was a great host. This was my first stay at AirBnB. Although I did not need to ask for much support, James offered to help in anyway. The times that I did have some questions, he was quick to respond. The place is great and very neat. The area is incredible with lots of great restaurants, cool bars and beautiful parks nearby. I recommend highly.

I was lucky enough to see the view of Mt Ranier from his porch, which made for a nice afternoon view. 

I did have some trouble accessing the apartment on arrival, which was somewhat exasperating after a long day of travel. However, I could tell James did everything he could to help out! ... And the remainder of my stay was certainly splendid. Highly recommend the apartment and the host!"

The location was perfect with walking distance to bars and first class restaurants. The apartment was brand new with modern decor, comfortable bed, huge bathtub, and balcony.

The location is convenient and walking distance to most things (we were there when it was cold so it's probably walking distance to everything in the summer!). James was extremely helpful with recommendations for things to do. 
7884782,53689140,2015-11-11,12507047,James,"James has a great looking apartment at the edge of Capitol Hill.  It has a large south facing window that gets awesome sunlight in the afternoon which is a plus in rainy seattle.  Lots of bars, restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  Nice downhill walk from the apartment to downtown. 

James was great with communication and making it easy to check in and out."
7884782,53973054,2015-11-15,25400850,Jennings,"We highly recommend James' place when visiting Seattle!! Not only was he a great, responsive host, but the place exceeded the expectations from the pictures. Check-in/check-out was also very easy, and James was flexible with our arrival.  It was such a great location with so many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops (highly recommend General Porpoise for coffee/doughnuts on Union), and downtown/Pike's place are a walkable distance away. We love to stay in a neighborhood area when visiting a new city but still be able to walk to the touristy attractions.... this place was perfect for that! When we come back to visit Seattle, we will definitely be staying here again! "
7884782,54411839,2015-11-19,7306521,Matthew,"Had a really lovely stay at James place, the location is better than I could have ever imagined! James was very accommodating, inviting me for drinks with friends and providing local recommendations."
7884782,54565515,2015-11-21,34278744,Brittany,Gorgeous place. 
7884782,55001816,2015-11-27,31182582,Jenny,Really nice place! Enjoyed the stay so much! Thanks so much for waiting till 3am for us. Great host and great place!
7884782,55242079,2015-11-29,48030073,Paul,"James was an excellent host...the place was clean and in a great spot for us to explore the neighborhood.  We liked the convenience of having laundry in the apartment, and used it to get wine out of a shirt that would have otherwise been ruined if we didn't wash it right away.  The neighborhood is fun and has a lot to offer for both food and kitchy shopping.  Also everything downtown is a walk down hill to get to and an easy and cheap Uber ride back.  We really enjoyed our stay!"
7884782,55568851,2015-12-02,9250946,Elizabeth,"Very nice place! And convenient. James provided great information about Seattle and getting around. 

"
7884782,55740648,2015-12-05,8097561,Adrian,"Perfect location in Seattle, smack in the heart of the bar/club/restaurant area of Pike & Pine ... yet an oasis of serenity away from the weekend street noise. Very nicely appointed, clean, well designed, extremely comfortable. 

James was super attentive and communicative via text, check-in and check-out couldn't be easier. 

Bonus points for in-unit washer and dryer, should you need it, and a nice little outdoor balcony, if it's not raining! Would totally stay there again!"
7884782,55886279,2015-12-06,50607502,Sophie,"Perfect neighborhood to go out and walk around if we had the time. It was a great space and very clean! James responded quickly and he had a bunch of great recommendations for nearby food and his profile had great tips for getting around.

The only bummer was some noisy neighbors across the hall that kept us up later than we would have liked. 

Overall a very private beautiful place for our small family and we would visit again! 
"
7884782,56131245,2015-12-09,10431213,David,"James's apartment exceeded our expectations both in terms of quality of stay and location. Because there was a washer/dryer we packed very light (backpacks) and getting there was simply a matter of taking the light rail from SeaTac and then a 25-30 minute walk down Pine to the apartment, which a highly suggest.

There's no shortage of interesting places to eat in this part of Capitol Hill, which I'd say is already well on its way to becoming the hip and trendy part of town. When we wanted to head downtown the bus station was literally at the end of the block and pretty easy to figure out.

The apartment had everything we needed - we were even able to enjoy a couple of Jean Claude Van Damme movies as a nightcap."
7884782,56466561,2015-12-13,32457671,Jennifer,"The apartment for rent is perfect. It's a great size, very clean and well decorated. Located in the heart of the Capitol Hill hot spots. James was quite accommodating for my short notice, gave through instructions and directions to the apartment. He also checked in during my stay to see if I needed anything, and if I was enjoying my stay."
7884782,56731919,2015-12-17,49124670,Xinyu,Jame's apartment is super nice and clean. The location is also very convenient. 
7884782,57557949,2015-12-27,19300023,Magdalena,James' apartment was perfect for my visit with my parents to Seattle for the Christmas holiday. He made it easy for us to check in (despite the late arrival of our flight) and messaged periodically during our stay to see if we needed anything. James is a very accommodating host! The apartment itself was great- perfectly located in the Capitol Hill neighborhood close to restaurants and shops. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in Seattle! 
7884782,57937631,2015-12-30,16933062,Nikita,"Fantastic apartment! Very pretty, comfortable, and in the BEST location if you want to be smack in the middle of Seattle's coolest neighborhood (Capitol Hill). James was great about coordinating and making sure we were taken care of. Thank you!"
7884782,58353282,2016-01-02,25619191,Doug,"James' place was fantastic, and easily one of the best we've stayed in. He was very communicative and worked with us when our train arrived late at night, and even extended an invite to his NYE plans. His apartment was spotless and near lots of great food, and we were able to have some great meals from his list of suggestions. The location is super convenient to downtown Seattle, and we were able to walk/Uber everywhere. Would definitely stay here again the next time we're in Seattle!"
8014547,45642137,2015-09-04,19405391,Lauren,"My friend and I had a fantastic time staying at William's studio. Everything was labeled with sticky notes, the space was clean, and it was a truly unique experience. We loved the bookcase door, the stereo system, and all the pictures on the walls. The location was perfect, and William was very responsive to any questions I had. Happy to have stayed here!"
8014547,45907288,2015-09-06,43261699,Carlos,William was an absolutely spectacular host. He recommended a few greats bars and restauants in the area and genuinely made me feel at home. I could not have had a better experience using AirBnb the first time around. 
8014547,48638511,2015-09-27,24703559,Andrew,"Staying at Will's place was a great experience. The apartment was clean, in a great location, and really cool!  Will was a superb host, and replied promptly to all communication. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Capitol Hill area."
8014547,50421785,2015-10-11,10201143,Stacie,William was very responsive. Neighborhood was lovely and the apartment was impecable. 
8014547,51087007,2015-10-17,4728955,Karen,"Super-easy to check in, William was in contact as I got close to Seattle. I was driving in to meet my friend who lived nearby in Cap Hill, and parking around the neighborhood was a little tight, but I found something just around the corner. William checked in by text after he remote-buzzed me into the building to make sure all was well. It was! 

My friend and I selected Ella Sings Cole Porter from William's record collection to play while we sat at his kitchen bar & toasted my arrival. 

Cute place and definitely in the heart of Capital Hill. Walking distance to everything cool. Thanks for the great experience. "
8014547,51228159,2015-10-18,12587566,Beth,"Great place, very peaceful and attractive with easy access to local attractions. Comfortable and clean. "
8240758,49042008,2015-09-30,43816705,Christine,"Emily was great to work with, very accommodating. The apartment was very clean and very comfortable bedding. Great experience!"
8240758,49560334,2015-10-04,9860322,Sunya,"Apartment was neat and clean and had all the essentials. Definitely not fancy, but great location. The neighborhood is really fun and very walkable. Good french pastry place just about a block away."

1525972,6650782,2013-08-19,7333330,Katie,"Yuriy is a wonderful host! Their place is adorable and very clean! You'll feel very comfortable and find yourself delighted by the charming decor - between cute coffee table books to the cozy bedroom, it's a great place for a weekend stay. The neighborhood is also very nice and Yuriy did a great job working out the details for check-in and check-out. I would highly recommend this mid-century home!"
1525972,6800586,2013-08-25,5954609,Emma,"Yuriy and his wife were great hosts! They accommodated us at very short notice. Yuriy was very easy to communicate with throughout. Their home was beautifully decorated, very comfortable and spotlessly clean with lots of interesting magazines/books and a very well-equipped kitchen. The location was great, we loved the neighborhood and found it easy to get downtown. We'd definitely stay again! "
1525972,7169616,2013-09-09,279790,Deborah,"Lovely apartment, very tasteful furnishings, pleasantly uncluttered and relaxing.  Jst a few things I would have liked to know beforehand: this is a basement/ground level apartment and thus can get a little stuffy. And while the furnishings were cool and overall this place is as advertised, the 2nd bedroom was really more of an office with an older/vintage pull-out sofa bed that was pretty uncomfortable and springy. Still this is a nice place with good light, great location, and it was easy to communicate with hosts."
1525972,7699790,2013-09-30,8183560,Celine,"Yuriy and Julia have a beautiful apartment in a great location in Capitol Hill. The area is quiet and residential but very close to the main hub of the area. They instantly made us feel welcome in their home and the whole process was very easy. We especially loved their attention to detail and awesome taste in mid-century modern furniture! We would love to come back some time, thanks guys!"
1525972,9031875,2013-12-02,5120637,Patrick,"Yuriy's place was perfect. Well appointed, clean and a perfect location! He was easy to coordinate with and very kind in person. Very highly recommended!"
1525972,11548618,2014-04-07,12933360,Lorna,Great experience! Definitely recommend the location and Yuriy and Julia were very accommodating and responsive. 
1525972,11994078,2014-04-21,872139,Stephanie,Yuriy's apartment was perfect! A charming and beautiful home close to Broadway and the cafés and bars of Capitol Hill. The place was spotless and Yuriy and his wife Julia responded promptly to any queries. I would highly recommend and didn't want to leave!
1525972,14599271,2014-06-23,11739599,Katie,"We had a lovely time staying at the Manchik's place! The apartment was beautifully furnished and very comfortable. It was in a quiet, quaint area yet it was really easy to walk to restaurants and shops. It was the perfect place to stay in Seattle! "
1525972,14797910,2014-06-26,10189233,Gloria,"This is my first booking via airbnb, Yuriy helps me a lot and very helpful, fast to answer my questions :) 

Yuriy & Julia's place is amazingly clean and tidy. You can found a clear introduction about the apartment and many useful leaflets, city map while you arrived. Location is prefect, two blocks to Broadway (going down) that you can found bars and restaurants; and two blocks to 15th ave (going up) which have Safeway and QFC that you can found whatever you need.
Bus stop right on E.John St, no. 43 or 8 can take you anywhere downtown. 

Very easy for check in/check out, just regret that cannot meet Yuriy & Julia in person. I will highly recommend their place and definitely come back to this apartment on my next trip to Seattle. "
1525972,15103245,2014-07-02,9040919,Rachel,"We enjoyed staying here!  Nicely decorated, comfortable bed, great view from the rooftop and great location (20 min walk into downtown, 10 min walk to Trader Joe's for groceries) - the neighbourhood and garden were really pretty.  Only negatives were lack of closet space (there was no room to hang our coats/clothes) and space in the washroom for toiletries, which made getting ready a bit difficult.  "
1525972,15692731,2014-07-14,1532667,Martin,"Our family of four (including two young children) had a wonderful time at Yuriy and Julia's place, which is both very stylish and very comfortable. The location is terrific; we particularly liked being within walking distance of two great parks (Volunteer & Cal Anderson) and all the great restaurant and shops of Capitol Hill. Yuriy and Julia made us feel right at home. Highly recommended!"
1525972,16057154,2014-07-21,1792219,Mary,"Yuriy was not in town when we were there, but he wrote me a nice detailed email (with photos) explaining where the key would be. He also provided his sister's number (she lives in Seattle) just in case we needed something. 

Everything in the house was exactly as it was described. The house was super cute as well. It looked like something from and ikea/etsy advertisement. They had fresh coffee beans available in the grinder, as well as guides to the city. He also provided a nice welcome note with all the details about his place, including how to work the shower and internet password.

The only downside to this place is that it is ground level. Since it was summer when we stayed, we needed to open to windows for some lovely Seattle airflow. The windows were in line with the street, and it was a bit noisy (people talking/throwing trash in the bin). Obviously that is no fault of Yuriy's. Luckily I fall back asleep easily, so it was not too much of a problem for me."
1525972,16547540,2014-07-29,12700915,Alex,"This apartment was very comfortable and exactly as described. It was in the perfect location for our Seattle vacation, a quiet street close to everything. The Manchik's were very welcoming and responded quickly to emails. We honestly couldn't have asked for a better place. "
1525972,16769190,2014-08-02,14611463,Daniella,Toda estadia foi maravilhosa. Excelente bairro
1525972,18008501,2014-08-20,4124491,Elizabeth,"Yuriy and Julia's home is in a great location for exploring Capitol Hill. It is a very comfortable space to accommodate 4 people, and wonderful for cooking your own breakfast! (Yuriy and Julia were kind enough to leave the coffee grinder full of coffee beans) There is a very nice garden outside, as well as rooftop with views of downtown Seattle. I definitely recommend it."
1525972,20064581,2014-09-22,149603,Matt,"The place was beautiful, and really well located close to 15th Ave and to Broadway, both with great cafes and restaurants.  The decor was nice and would make any pinterester drool.  Overall glad we chose this spot."
1525972,22378900,2014-11-04,16203296,Melissa,"Yuriy was a great communicator and gave me plenty of information on the area so that getting settled, parking, and finding restaurants was simple. Great place. Just as described and shown in photos. A comfortable, nicely decorated, and simple place to stay. Worked perfectly for us."
1525972,22618834,2014-11-10,21505907,Carrie,"Great place, definitely as advertised, was clean with everything we'd need.  Yuriy checked in with us and made himself available to answer any questions we had.  Cap Hill was the perfect location for us - parking is tough as usual, but that's to be expected if you're familiar with the area.  The area and apt felt really safe/secure with the primary entrance within a secured building entrance.  Would definitely recommend this place - comes with an old school record player and some great vinyls too!!"
1525972,24832327,2015-01-03,14861963,Henry,My friends and I stayed for 6 nights in the apartment over the New Year. The location and neighbourhood are fantastic and exactly where you want to be for a short stay. The apartment was very clean and comfortable! Highly recommend. 
1525972,28367447,2015-03-22,24550262,Chris,"Easy instructions, great place."
1525972,28628417,2015-03-27,5658617,Anna,"We had a wonderful 6-day stay at this airbnb! The apartment is beautiful, and has everything you could possibly need. It's well-situated near dining, bars, ice cream, parks, etc. Some of the best parts of our trip involved lounging around in the living room  listening to records. It did get chilly, but the heater kept us cozy. I'd highly recommend staying here! "
1525972,29943589,2015-04-14,5973956,Benjamin,"Great Host, very uncomplicated and courteous. 
Nice and quiet neighbourhood with coffee shops, bars restaurants and downtown only a short walk away. Alot of light for a ground floor apartment, just be prepaired to close the curtains and the windows in the sleepingrooms at night."
1525972,35690760,2015-06-21,7482928,David,"What a perfect location to stay in Seattle! Yuriy was very helpful getting us checked in and staying in touch during our stay. The Capitol Hill neighborhood is wonderful with many restaurants, bars and coffee shops. There were several good places to eat on 15th Ave, just a couple of short blocks from the apartment.

The apartment was quiet and comfortable and right next to a wonderful garden. It was the perfect home base four our trip. We would definitely go back!"
1525972,36091476,2015-06-25,9532292,Julie,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Yuriy's apartment. It was clean and comfortable and very well located. Communication was good prior to our visit and instructions for getting into the apartment were great. We had everything that we needed

We had a great visit and would definitely stay here again.
"
1525972,36696794,2015-06-30,15142116,Lukasz,Very charming apartment in a beautiful neighbourhood. We felt safe and comfortable and very welcome. We especially loved the record player and the rooftop patio overlooking all of Seattle! Would definitely recommend. 
1525972,37173492,2015-07-05,29113827,Barbara,"I've previously lived in Seattle and can attest to this being a great neighborhood. (Be sure to check out Ada's Technical Books and Cafe on 15th!) The apartment was clean, attractive, and fun. Communication with Yuriy, who was traveling abroad, was instant and much appreciated.  The only downside of this apartment that probably should be noted is that taking a shower in the small antique claw foot tub is risky, and would be especially so for visitors with balance issues. That said, we had a most enjoyable stay!    "
1525972,45304350,2015-09-01,33398568,Amy,"Yuriy was extremely accommodating and very quick to reply to any of my questions via email. Their place is lovely and roomy, and charming. Its also just a few blocks walk to Broadway, which is covered in restaurants and bars.
I would recommend it to a friend in heartbeat.
Also, they left us cookies, and the bed is one of the most comfy I've ever slept in."
1525972,46021116,2015-09-07,10411649,Rebecca,"Yuriy was amazing!  The place is great, very clean and comfortable with a great location.  Yuriy was super responsive and made our Seattle visit easy and memorable.  Coffee in the grinder was a wonderful way to start our day before we went adventuring.  I'd 100% recommend staying with Yuriy."
1525972,48095956,2015-09-23,20319719,Emily,"Yuriy was a great host! Very clear instructions upon arrival and super responsive across the course of our stay. The apt is in a great location- close to lots of bars, restaurants and coffee shops, and an easy bus ride to pike place market and tourist attractions downtown. The building also has a great rooftop with amazing views of the city.While you won't necessarily need a car, they provided a parking pass for the street.

I was surprised when we first arrived to feel how ""lived in"" the place was (not a lot of space for our groceries, clothes, toiletries, etc. amidst Yuriy and his wife's things) but that wouldn't keep me from coming back. Also, there is no TV in the unit but they offered access to their very nice, large Mac and had plenty of books to read and records to enjoy. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Yuriy!"
1525972,51383791,2015-10-19,46255197,Lisa,"The communications with the host were very friendly, prompt and helpful.  The location was great; we could easily walk to eat or shop and we enjoyed a nice run through the nearby park.  The descriptions of the house were accurate and it was a comfortable, pleasant stay."
1351716,5724414,2013-07-13,7379360,Elaine,"If you are planning a trip to Seattle I would highly recommend this private guest house. Communication, accommodation, hospitality, convenience and location were all top notch.  It made out first airbnb experience perfect.  Thank you Bill and Huong!"
1351716,5818289,2013-07-17,7390960,Alan,"A quaint backyard hidden treasure; minutes from the city by bus, or a little longer by foot for the adventurous.

Bill and Huong are a warm, gracious couple, whose cottage offers a quiet retreat for a couple or small family. Lots of on street parking in this residential neighborhood, and if you revel in the aroma of freshly baked bread, this is the place for you...a bakery just around the corner.

The cottage and landscaping were still being developed, but the basic accommodations provided enough comfort for a memorable stay (7/2013). "
1351716,5898956,2013-07-21,7503807,Barry,"Prompt response, very friendly, and accommodating. This is an amazing deal for what basically amounts to a one bedroom house in a quiet neighborhood. I had to do a double take the next morning, when I realized how close I was to downtown. Furniture is simple, but it had a nice firm mattress, and the place was very clean. I'd certainly stay there again. "
1351716,6113740,2013-07-30,3928353,Jana,"Came down to Seattle from Vancouver, Canada for the Capital Block Party which was 5 minute cab ride away.

Huong and Bill were very friendly and helpful during our stay.

The guest house was spacious for the amazing price. 
We were pleasantly surprised to find the fridge filled with bottle water, pop, and juices for our enjoyment. For the coffee lovers, there is a coffee maker and coffee is provided.

Just a note, the kitchen has a microwave but no stove but this didn't effect our stay as we planned to eat out. The living room is a great space to relax but there is no tv in the suite, but if you plan to stay in and watch tv while on vacation in beautiful Seattle, you are missing out on an amazing experience. 

Great bonus is there is wifi for those who need it.

Bathroom had shampoo, conditioner and body wash but no blow dryer.

Overall amazing stay. Great owners, great price and close to downtown. We do highly recommend booking here instead of at staying at an overpriced downtown hotel.

Look forward to booking the guest house again soon. "
1351716,6255831,2013-08-05,597834,Danette,Enjoyed staying at Huong and Bill's... a very sweet little place.  Loved that it was so convenient (only 2 blocks) from public transportation... so easy to get into downtown and elsewhere.
1351716,6326515,2013-08-08,2840811,Sarah,"The guest house was perfect for our 2 day stay in Seattle. We drove downtown mostly, but did find the transit was easy the one time we took it. The wifi had a poor connection but Huong and Bill tried to help fix it. They were great hosts and the little home was lovely and private."
1351716,6464377,2013-08-13,6950067,Jasper,"Arrived on a Wednesday night, left our luggage there. Came back and found the place stocked with a few bottles of water, towels, silverware. Very nice inside, clean and relaxing. Wifi was the most important for my group and their internet was superb. Hosts were friendly and I would gladly stay with them again!"
1351716,6536440,2013-08-16,2026333,Joerg,"We really loved this space! Getting there and in was super easy, and the place was nice and comfortable, a real joy to come back to in the evening! It was stocked with anything you need on a trip, and close enough to Downtown. We can really recommend this place a lot!"
1351716,6601556,2013-08-18,7670001,Michael,"Seattle is an eclectic city with a lot going on all hours of the day and night in some areas so the guest house is a great escape from the commotion. Huong and Bill have a lovely property and have made the guest space very warm and accommodating with cable, wifi, beverages and some toiletries. My girlfriend and I only stayed for about 36hours and only saw Huong and Bill upon arrival and Bill one additional time when he brought over an iron and ironing board, but they were incredibly nice and welcoming. This is a residential neighborhood but there is a bus that stops 2 blocks from the house that will take you right to all the action in less than 15 minutes. And there is a very cute cafe right in front of the bus stop. We had a very pleasant experience and appreciate the hospitality!"
1351716,6788433,2013-08-25,4589192,Nicole,"We really enjoyed our stay at the beautiful cottage and it instantly felt like home away from home.  
The location is just perfect, very central located, yet in a save and quiet neighborhood. 
Huong and Bill were also very nice and really made us feel welcome.
I highly recommend this place to anyone wanting to visit Seattle!"
1351716,7036863,2013-09-04,4062134,Miguel,"Fantastic little cottage behind Huong and Bill's house. Lots of space to relax compared to a hotel room and a quick taxi from this quiet residential neighbourhood to the downtown core. Only saw Huong and Bill briefly during our stay but both times they were very helpful and friendly. Will definitely try to stay here again next time I visit Seattle. 

One minor note if you *need* to access wi-fi on your phone: The internet signal in the cottage is a little weak, totally fine for laptops but not good if you're relying on a cellphone or other small device to get online. "
1351716,7139763,2013-09-08,5696060,Drew,Had a wonderful time staying at Huong and BIll's place in Seattle. Next time we visit Seattle we will definitely contact them for another stay. Highly recommended!
1351716,7209936,2013-09-10,1840819,Karen,"Our stay at the guest house was great. The house was nicely nestled in the back in a space that felt private and safe, and we were able to come and go without feeling at all intrusive. The little extras in the form of drinks/snacks were a pleasant surprise, and there was a good amount of space to spread out during downtime. The location is also great - things to do in Seattle are very spread out, so having a central location that's not far from anything was perfect. Huong and Bill were very responsive and lovely hosts!"
1351716,7257142,2013-09-13,8337031,Ruby,Bill and Huong were great hosts and the cottage was lovely.  It had everything we needed and was easily accessible from the freeway.  Would definitely stay here again!
1351716,7339318,2013-09-16,413597,Mike,The cottage was great! It was comfortable and clean and very convenient for us. Bill was super nice and made us feel most welcome. We'd definitely come back again. 
1351716,7481305,2013-09-22,737615,Beth,"Bill and Huong have a wonderful cottage to offer. Your own ""tiny house"" with plenty of living space nestled in their backyard. The new door lock was easy to use. Easy access from the highway and close to Downtown. There is plenty of street parking on a quiet residential street. A grocery store is about 5 blocks away. The kitchen does not have a stovetop or dishwasher, but that did not matter. We made use of the microwave and toaster. There were extras in the full size refrigerator (soda, bottled water, muffins, butter) and tableware for four. There is also a coffee maker/coffee. Personal extras in the bathroom too. The bed is comfortable and there are extra linens and towels. BIll upgraded the internet with a 2G and 5G booster for excellent quality WiFi and a TV is now available. We asked for a floor fan for the bedroom, in addition to the ceiling fan in the vaulted living room. The desk area is stocked with an array of travel magazines, Seattle maps/bus schedules and a tempting bowl of chocolate treats!  The nearest bus stop is only two blocks away. A local cafe menu on the desk was an great suggestion for take out (and it is near the bus stop). I spoke to Bill once, and he was very pleasant. This house is so close to our family in Seattle, we hope their cottage is available whenever we return. This is our fourth Airbnb rental in Seattle."
1351716,8094824,2013-10-15,9019967,Alyssa,"My boyfriend and I had the perfect stay at this cute little guest house. It was nice and private, warm, comfortable, and inviting. There were waters and pop in the fridge to help ourselves too as well as snack bars, and mini-chocolate bars (which my boyfriend may have eaten the whole bowl of). We did not get the chance to meet Bill and Huong but had a lovely welcome note waiting on our arrival. There were plenty of towels, and we had no trouble at all with the wi-fi connection (or anything for that matter). If you're up for a good walk you can make it to Pioneer Square/Downtown, but we opted for the bus which was nearby and came very frequently. Definitely suggest this as a place to stay in Seattle. We will stay again on a return visit!"
1351716,8280839,2013-10-23,9056830,Narumi,The cottage is great:))It was confortable and clean.Bill is very good:)) We would like to stay here again!!!
1351716,8446340,2013-10-31,3005701,Joan,"Bill and Huong’s guest cottage in the Central District was perfect for us.  Centrally located in a quiet, culturally diverse neighbourhood, the cottage behind their home had all the space and privacy that we like.   We could come and go as we pleased.  The courtyard between the cottage and their home is populated with Japanese maple trees, which were so colourful during our October visit.  

Their location is within easy access of the bus, which is a short ride to downtown, as well as the I5, and is an easy drive from the airport.  Their home is a short walk from a convenience store, supermarket, pharmacy, Starbucks, a great café (Cheeky Café),  a funky take-out pizzeria (Humble Pie), and numerous other eateries.

Our hosts left us some welcome treats in the kitchen to get us started, including bread and English muffins from their local bakery, which has a factory outlet just a block from them--all the comforts of home and more!  Bill and Huong responded quickly to any special requests we had.  They were gracious hosts, and we recommend them and their guest cottage.
"
1351716,8869516,2013-11-23,8309358,Doris,"The cottage provided by Huong and Bill was perfect for our three nights' stay in Seattle.  We had everything we needed to plan our days, figure out the transit system, have hot drinks and microwaved food.  They were the first hosts to work with my need for a fragrance free environment (after 12 tries.) I would highly recommend staying with Huong and Bill--I will certainly stay with them again for any future trips to Seattle.  "
1351716,10063984,2014-01-28,10808139,Kimmy,"This cottage is a great and comfortable place. The photos do not do justice to how warm and lovely the space is. It is bright and airy while being cozy and charming. The cottage had everything we needed and was particularly tidy and well-maintained. It was also nice to stay in a place where the furnishings (towels, linens, dishes) were very high quality. During our two week stay, Huong and Bill were friendly hosts who hit the right balance of being available and helpful but giving us privacy. We also found the location to be quite convenient and accessible."
1351716,10239438,2014-02-08,7074981,Danielle,"Huong and Bill are great, kind hosts and their place is conveniently located for downtown exploration.  I would definitely stay here again!"
1351716,10426743,2014-02-18,402143,Judy,"First and foremost, Houng & Bill were so great to deal with! They communicated with us several times before we arrived including the day before (welcoming us!!) and then dropped by soon after we arrived to introduce themselves in person.  They were so warm and friendly. Second, this rental is a great value!!!!  It was so reasonably priced, yet it was still a cozy place with all we needed.  While the kitchen does not have a stove (which we did not need since we ate out or at local relatives) it does have a frig, microwave &  coffee maker.  The only thing that we were a bit ""turned off"" by was the tub...it looked old and stained (which immediately conjures fears of mildew & mold), but it had clearly been cleaned and the rest of the apartment was spotless. We will be back each and every time we visit Seattle.  What a find!"
1351716,10485363,2014-02-21,2243194,Charlotte,"My friend and I traveled to Seattle for a quick visit, and could  not have been happier with our found accommodations.
The guest house was clean, warm and welcoming. Bill came to greet us shortly after our arrival. He was kind and offered his help, should we need it.
I highly recommend booking with these two! A lovely home away from home, and the perfect distance from the city center.
Thanks!
"
1351716,10685227,2014-03-03,1253331,Daron,"Huong and Bill's guest house is absolutely charming, convenient, and comfortable. I extended a business trip over a weekend to explore Seattle, and this location was centrally located and easily accessible via Uber or public transit. Huong and Bill thoughtfully outfitted the home with nice touches like city maps and granola bars. Most importantly, the Wifi was fast and the bed was heavenly. Can't wait to stay here the next time I'm in Seattle!"
1351716,13132618,2014-05-20,7252789,Kim,"Thanks go Huong and Bill for taking care of my mother as she visited Seattle!  Very sweet little house - we initially missed that there wasn't a stove though, would have been nice for the longer term stay."
1351716,13227109,2014-05-22,15450279,Callahan,"I greatly enjoyed staying at Huong and Bill's guesthouse! It was nice to have the added space and the use of a kitchen that I wouldn't get at a hotel. The guesthouse was clean and completely ready for me when I arrived. The location is close to public transportation access, which is needed to get to downtown Seattle and there are some fun coffee shops and restaurants walking distance from the guesthouse. It felt more like a home to return to after a fun day in Seattle rather than a stuffy hotel room. Thank you for helping make my visit so much more enjoyable :) "
1351716,13435872,2014-05-27,1216517,Ben,"We had a wonderful stay at Huong and Bill's place, and we highly recommend booking with them for your stay in Seattle. The guest house was quiet, immaculate, and perfectly located to all things Seattle. Huong and Bill were great communicators, and excellent hosts - they were available as we needed them, but also provided plenty of privacy during our trip. A+, 10/10, and would 100% rent from them again. Thanks, Huong and Bill!"
1351716,13565558,2014-05-31,6353301,Eiren,"We had a great stay at Huong and Bill's cottage, it was the perfect place to relax after days out in the city and visits with family. We would definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. "
1351716,13751585,2014-06-03,14904073,Scott,"The place was great!  Settled in behind the main house, this guest house was a nice place to stay.  It was in a nice and quiet neighborhood with friendly people.  Place was nice and had all that we needed.  The best part was the location.  The location was perfect.  Not too far from the tourist places where getting Lyft was easy as pie.  Highly, highly recommended. "
1351716,14155555,2014-06-13,1024060,Naomi,"My mum and I really enjoyed staying at Huong and Bill's guest house.  Everything was nicely set up for us when we arrived and the place was very welcoming.  There were pamphlets available about things to do around Seattle; advice on nearby amenities; and information on how to get around i.e. buses and taxis.  The location was convenient to everything we had planned to see and do.
I will definitely be back!!"
1351716,14233112,2014-06-15,15183196,Cindy,My husband and I had a wonderful stay in the guest cottage. It was very close to the train station where we came in from and close to the stadium. The cottage was equipped with all that we needed for our stay and very clean. We would definitely stay there again! 
1351716,14356058,2014-06-17,15369337,Nadia,Very cute little guest cottage in a very peaceful and pretty neighborhood thats near a lot of delicious asian restaurants. Very awesome and clear directions/communication from Huong and Bill and they really thought of everything when it came to the house - nice little touches make you feel at home! 
1351716,14736074,2014-06-25,737615,Beth,"WE CAME BACK! This was our second stay in this facility.  It is just perfect ... plenty of space and amenities.  The neighborhood is quiet and it Is an easy drive to just about anywhere (Downtown, Lake Washington Lake Union, Bellevue/Medina, numerous neighborhoods, parks and attractions or the Airport). The hosts are very easy to work with and they provide lots of local information for your stay. E-mail responses are quick before your stay and we have contacted Bill via text for small issues during our stay. The Guest House has always been clean and safe. Our grandson lives close and has nicknamed it ""the tiny house"".  And it is, just about like home.  We will be back, Bill and Huong. This is the third airbnb property in Seattle we have rented and the only one we have used twice. :))"
1351716,15265675,2014-07-06,15644151,Michael,"We loved staying in the guest house. Very spacious, private and clean. We were vacationing with 2 of our grown-up kids and there was plenty of room. 

Bill was very helpful. He quickly provided a tarp and blanket when we told him we planned to check out the 4th of July fireworks. It was just what we needed for the park where the lawn was a bit wet. 

It really is convenient to the major Seattle attractions and street parking in front of the house was easy to find. "
1351716,15421971,2014-07-08,10913519,Santi,"Great host and Airbnb stay! Bill and Huong gave really detailed a directions and arrival information which made getting there a breeze. Extremely flexible- Bill was able to meet us early to drop off our bags before check in so that we could start our exploration of the city. We were hoping this might be possible but we're not expecting, it was awesome it worked out. 
The space is beautiful, clean and comfortable. Nice touches like bottled water, snacks and maps made us feel looked after.
Bill was very kind and helpful in our brief interactions. Overall would recommend!"
1351716,15569560,2014-07-12,13180502,Susan,"Our experience was excellent.  The central location was a key factor in selecting this location.  We loved being part of an actual neighborhood. The neighbors were even saying hi to us by the end of our stay.  And, the fact that we had beautiful weather made our stay even more enjoyable.  The guest house was clean, comfortable and inviting.
"
1351716,15829536,2014-07-16,677727,Mjumbe,"Nice place. Its a charming little one bedroom guest house behind Bill and Huong's house. Surprisingly spacious for what it is. There were three of us staying and it was plenty of room.

There's a small step in the house that can come out of nowhere, but we learned after a few stubbed toes to pay attention. Heed the warning to watch your step!

The internet was a bit fickle for us, but we were on vacation and reliable high-speed wifi was not a high priority.

In getting to and from the house we most often either walked (watch out for the hills) to public transportation or took UberX. Never had any problems getting around.

Overall, we had a blast. Would stay again."
1351716,15956969,2014-07-19,12332658,Jake,Just what we were looking for.
1351716,16096769,2014-07-22,16065167,Admas,"What a great experience! Huong and Bill have really set the bar high as this was my family's first Airbnb experience. It was always easy to get a hold of them, either before we booked, before our stay, and even while we were there. We loved the Little Blue House (the kids still talk about), it was perfect for our weekend stay. The neighbourhood was perfect for us, we were close to shops, markets, and even a bread factory :) You will not be disappointed staying here, and we look forward to coming back again."
1351716,16683459,2014-07-31,14248699,Niamh,We had a great stay in this gorgeous little cottage. Everything that we needed was there and such an easy check in and check out process. Very easy to get downtown and there was lots of information left for us to help with our exploration of Seattle. Thanks again!
1351716,17279002,2014-08-10,16654205,Patricia,"This was our first experience using Airbnb.  We found Bill and Huong’s Sweet Central District Guest House to be a great alternative to spending a week in a hotel room.  It was very clean and neat and had everything we needed.  We used the guest house as a retreat to crash after our busy days touring the city and surrounding areas.  They setup a high quality air mattress in the living room for our younger son, which worked very well for us.  We felt safe and secure in the house.  Our older son lived in the city and helped us pick out a location that was close to him and still in a good neighborhood (something first time users of Airbnb should keep in mind).  Bill and Huong were very responsive to our questions and even brought us some delicious chocolate cake one night.  Thank you, Bill and Huong, for making our first visit to Seattle a very pleasant experience!"
1351716,17456504,2014-08-12,13641969,Jessica,"The Central District Guest House was a great space. It was keyless entry, and so we had no interaction with the hosts; however, the hosts lived in the main property in front of the guest house, and so if we had had an issue (we didn't), they were nearby. The place itself was clean and plenty of room for two.  It was a little warm with no A/C, but with the windows open for a breeze and with the fan it was fine. The guest house was near the chinatown/international district, which we both enjoyed, and it was also walking distance to the Centurylink Stadium and the Amtrak station. "
1351716,17564313,2014-08-14,7116993,Robert,"Bill and Huong's place was perfect for our trip.  The cottage was clean and comfortably slept our group of 4.  We got a chance to meet Bill and the neighbours and they were all extremely friendly.  We were even welcomed with a ""go Blue Jays"" post-it note when we arrived!  I highly recommend staying at Bill and Huong's place."
1351716,18022884,2014-08-20,2935690,Sarah,"Huong and Bill were communicative and helpful hosts.  The apartment was private, clean, with all the basic amenities. "
1351716,18245630,2014-08-24,16099331,Melissa,we had a great stay at Huong and Bill's cottage when we were in Seattle for a few days for a wedding. Everything was clean and bedroom had nice light and was comfortable. location was convenient for downtown Seattle.
1351716,18662470,2014-08-30,18218075,Stewart,Bill and Huong were very welcoming and made sure that we settled in OK. We had our 11 month old baby with us and the spacious apartments gave her plenty of room to crawl around. There was a microwave to sterilise bottles. There was plenty of free parking space on the street and the neighbourhood felt safe. Their place is conveniently located for us to take the bus to/from downtown Seattle. Bill also recommended a lovely Vietnamese restaurant which we went twice!  There were plenty of useful local travel and tourists information readily available in the apartment.
1351716,18874402,2014-09-02,15643051,Thomas,"This was a great place to stay.  Great location which was close to the stadiums.  The guest house was very clean and had all of the essentials, with snacks too!  Bill and Huong were very easy to get in contact with and quite accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again.  Thanks!"
1351716,19210010,2014-09-08,15787573,Ryan,Great experience with Bill and Huong. They left everything out we needed with a clear outline of the bnb and surrounding area. Would definitely recommend.
1351716,19675985,2014-09-16,14400600,Cynthia,"we loved the place, the neighborhood is great, AND 3 blocks from my daughter's place! we didn't see Huong and Bill, as i believe they were away. the ONLY slight problem was that there was no soap for the shower (bought a bar) and only a smidgen of coffee left- bought some too. other than that, we'd love to come back for our next visit!"
1351716,19881621,2014-09-20,19100912,Maung,accurate description
1351716,20376230,2014-09-28,2085628,Megan,"Although I didn't get a chance to meet Bill and Huong, they were excellent hosts and great communicators. The cottage was just as described--it was clean, had ample closet space, and was stocked with both snacks and maps of the area, which we very much appreciated. We had no problem finding a parking spot on the street in front of the house, and the keyless entry allowed for convenient check-in/check-out. 

We also enjoyed the Central District location. The cottage is located in a quiet, safe, residential neighborhood, but it only took us 10-15 min. by car to get to Pike's Place downtown and to the Capitol Hill neighborhood (we used Uber). There were also plenty of bus maps in the house if you prefer to take public transportation--Bill and Huong were nice enough to include precise directions regarding how to get downtown and back as well!

I would definitely stay here again if I had the chance. 

"
1351716,20747138,2014-10-05,3553259,Sarah,"My husband and I stayed an entire week and absolutely loved it! Perfectly described and in a great location. Access to everything is literally minutes away and it was the right amount of space for us during our stay. 

If ever back in Seattle (sooner than later), we will be staying here again."
1351716,20931103,2014-10-07,3707909,Laurie,"Gorgeous place, i wanted to move in!"
1351716,21291224,2014-10-14,20910476,Adam,"Very clean and comfortable accommodations, all the helpful information provided by Bill and Houng was appreciated. "
1351716,21715696,2014-10-22,21942725,Lynda,"Met Bill who was very nice and helpful; neighborhood very quiet, no traffic, homes nice.  Best thing for us was close to a bus stop as we had no car."
1351716,22075564,2014-10-29,2059054,Vena,"A very nice, private spot. Clean, nicely appointed and convenient location.
The internet was a bit spotty, but Bill was quick to help."
1351716,22293541,2014-11-03,1857805,Michael,"Bill and Huong's cottage was the perfect place to stay the weekend in Seattle. It was a cozy little place that slept my friends and I very comfortably. The location is amazing! Just a few minutes to downtown, free street parking and right off the freeway. Could not have asked for a more ideal place to stay. "
1351716,22671224,2014-11-11,3177834,Nadya,"A friend and I visited Seattle (my first time) for an extended weekend.  We chose Huong and Bill's guest house for its location.  It is located on a quiet street, but close to the action of downtown and quaintness of Capitol Hill.  The guest house was spacious and had all the essentials.  The kitchen is functional but not fully equipped, so keep that in mind if you have intentions of cooking at the house to save on costs.  There was plenty of parking on the street.  

My friend has the following to say about her experience:  ""The air mattress would have been much more comfortable with a mattress pad or cover under the sheet.  Overall the place was well located and functioned well.  It was spacious and even though it was worn looking, it seemed clean.""

Upon arrival, take a look around the cottage, especially in the kitchen.... Get the lay of the land sort of speak.  There are plenty of maps in the kitchen drawers.  This would have been helpful for us (had we checked) as we did not use our cell phones without Wi-Fi connection.  Overall, it was a cozy and private guest house.  It was conveniently located and a 10-15 minute drive to tourist attractions.  Thank you Huong and Bill!"
1351716,22783745,2014-11-14,11719033,Rebecca,"Met Bill briefly when he came to the door to make sure all was good.  Fabulous location, easy to access, user friendly host, all I needed, fabulous linens and towels, comfy couch, house more than expected/represented on site."
1351716,23204767,2014-11-25,21101915,Brian,"Visited Seattle for a Seahawks game and other tourist type things. Could not have been happier with our decision to stay with Bill and Huong.  They were extremely accommodating and flexible with check in and check out times.

The location is perfect, we were extremely surprised at how close to downtown and CenturyLink Field/Safeco Field we were, a very quick easy walk.

The cottage is much bigger and nicer than it looks on the site.  I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone they stay in this location. You cannot beat the price, location, and friendliness of Bill and Huong.

"
1351716,24016589,2014-12-16,22571002,Troy,By far the best AirBnB that I have stayed at thus far!  The Guest house was clean and up to date. Everything looked nice and new. The host was very responsive and extremely helpful and understanding. The area is good as well. A short 15 minute walk to downtown area/stadium or a $5 Uber ride. If you are debating between this location and another... pick this one! You will not be sorry.
1351716,24310256,2014-12-25,315668,Bonnie,I really love the small one bed room house. Neat clean and perfect for 2 people. The location is excellent as it's near pike's and chinatown. Will definitely return! 
1351716,24410796,2014-12-28,10895306,Tim,Everything about this property was as described. Very clean and comfortable. Highly recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in this part of the city.   
1351716,24565858,2014-12-30,17383015,Kat,"The cute little house was perfect for me and my husband! It looked exactly like the pictures and was easy to find. A $9 uber ride to just about anywhere you wanna go downtown. We were in town for the Seahawks game and it was so nice to stay close, not have to worry about how were getting home. 
Everything was clean and organized and we had everything we could have needed. I would definitely stay here again!"
1351716,24773387,2015-01-02,24943961,Will,Had a great time staying here.  It was easy to find and check in was very simple.  The place was spacious and comfortable.  Didn't get a chance to meet Huong but Bill was very friendly and made sure we were taken care of.  
1351716,25360201,2015-01-13,6050332,Erica,"the guest house was perfect! Bill and Huong are very kind.
thank you for a wonderful experience Bill and Huong!"
1351716,25427324,2015-01-15,15941911,Morgan,Thanks you Huong and Bill! The location was great. Close enough into downtown but still peaceful and very safe feeling. We had plenty of space. Huong and Bill were kind and easy to communicate with. There was everything we would ever need in their guesthouse. 
1351716,25606774,2015-01-20,25496015,Michel,"Great location close to downtown. Bill and Huong were very accommodating leaving the lights on for us and supplying refreshments in the fridge. The guest house was clean and had everything we needed for our 5 night stay. The neighborhood was safe, quiet and conveniently located to restaurants, freeway and downtown. The host was next door on the premises to make sure we had everything we needed. Reasonably priced."
1351716,25671075,2015-01-22,11824295,David,Fast communication from host.  Accommodations were exactly as described.  I thought this was a great value for one person and would be especially true for three or four.  I absolutely recommend this spot and will rebook on my next trip.
1351716,25974224,2015-01-31,397758,Patrick,"Huong And Bill were wonderful hosts and everything about our trip was as promised or better. Very friendly and always asking what they could do for us, but for the most part let us be to enjoy Seattle. The area is pretty and safe and although I was initially worried about parking on the street, it was never a problem for the 6 days we stayed! We walked to the park, bus, bakery, walgreens and supermarket. The house itself was great and more than enough space for a family of 4. We asked for a vacuum so we could keep up the cleaning as we stayed but otherwise everything was there."
1351716,26069617,2015-02-02,26215223,Christian,Bill and Houng were amazing hosts! Our stay was fantastic. The little house has everything you might need and was so clean and ready to go when we arrived. This spot is centrally located and close to everything in Seattle. The house is also equipped with wifi and cable. You could stay at a hotel but you'd be waisting your money if this spot is available. I really hope we get the chance to stay with them again. 
1351716,26710288,2015-02-17,3152135,Dalphy,"I spent a weekend in Seattle, exploring town with 3 of my friends. The location was fantastic, free street parking! and walkable distance to city, walk was bit over 35 minutes, if you are not into walking a short busride or taxi will get you there in no time. Huong and Bill are really lovely, fast responses to messages, flexible and super friendly hosts. They made us feel welcome and relaxed. The guesthouse is behind the main house and has it's own entry providing privacy, it's clean, has all the info right there, maps, magazines, and the beds were super comfi. Great little getaway almost in middle of town. "
1351716,27013574,2015-02-23,27389019,Jean,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at Huong and Bill's adorable little cottage! They were both so kind and hospitable, made the stay very comfortable. I definitely hope to stay there again for any future trips we take to Seattle! "
1351716,27351200,2015-03-02,10160214,Mario,Yes they were great.  The location was good and everything was to our liking.  They were able to accommodate our 3rd colleague.  The space was clean and the right size for us.  
1351716,28934419,2015-04-01,5491297,Margery,"I stayed in Huong & Bill's guest cottage for a month and loved it. So comfortable, exactly as pictured, and immaculate. It is in a diverse neighborhood within walking distance of downtown and also close to bus stops. I didn't meet Huong, but Bill was instantly responsive to texts, so pleasant and helpful. I would definitely return. "
1351716,30905823,2015-04-28,31552777,Ian,"Near the heart of Seattle! Plenty of parking on the street. Simple, but comfortable guest house. "
1351716,31989471,2015-05-12,3340691,Stasia,"I had an excellent stay at Huong and Bill's cottage. The location was perfect with quick access to downtown Seattle as well as the Capitol Hill Area. The place was spacious, well kept and I highly recommend it for a nice Seattle experience. "
1351716,32321723,2015-05-17,27895963,Peter,"Quiet friendly neighbourhood , clean comfortable accomodation , exactly as shown on listing. A little distant from Downtown Seattle for us , but a good service from no 14 bus which is 5  minutes walk away. Houng and Bill were lovely hosts. Peter and Eileen, from Ireland. May 2015."
1351716,32629287,2015-05-19,807001,Darian,Huong and Bill were excellent hosts. Everything was exactly as listed and the place was lovely. I would definitely lodge with them again. Thank you both so much!
1351716,32910079,2015-05-23,30160933,Brad,"Huong and Bill's guesthouse was a great place to stay in Seattle. A bit of a walk to downtown and Pike Place Market through the International District, but in a nice neighborhood and convenient enough. Plenty spacious and neat, the place was a good spot to explore the city. I only met Bill, but he was available and helpful during my stay."
1351716,33616690,2015-05-30,27773253,Sjoerd,"Bill is a very relaxed and committed host. The house was clean, the airmatrasse (second bed) was unexpected comfortable. Nearby there's a bus to the centre, that worked well for us. We had a great stay"
1351716,33927650,2015-06-02,32276406,Cindy,"We didn't get the chance to meet our hosts, but they were super helpful and responsive when we communicated. The guesthouse was clean and made up for the four of us and it was the perfect location for us. Thanks for hosting us, Huong and Bill! "
1351716,34465653,2015-06-08,16687032,Shannon,"My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway to Seattle. We loved how cozy and welcome the place was, it was a great place to crash in between adventures! Also very centrally located, downtown was easily accessible with our rental car."
1351716,34828473,2015-06-12,35202726,Mollie,"10/10 would visit again. Bill was extremely kind, the property was comfortable and well located, and coming and going was very smooth.  It made for a great trip, thank you!"

1351716,36000946,2015-06-24,6636922,Veronica,I had my family stay at Huong and Bill's guesthouse during their visit to Seattle. They were very accommodating and made the whole process very easy for my family and me. The guesthouse was incredibly cute and comfortable for my family's stay. 
1351716,36293616,2015-06-27,33857444,Georgina,Host was very accommodating and did everything to make us feel comfortable.
1351716,36533589,2015-06-29,30938399,Mark,"The listing is exactly as described. Quiet neighborhood withing walking distance to downtown and nearby shops.  The house was very clean and in great condition.  Bill introduced himself to us and was extremely friendly. They went above and beyond to make sure our stay was as perfect as possible.  Next time I travel to Seattle i will be staying there again. Great place, great area, and great hosts.  Thanks Bill and Huong!"
1351716,37015603,2015-07-03,36986411,Timothy,"The guest house is in a very quiet neighborhood.  Bus lines are a short walk, so it's quick trip to downtown.  Plenty of on-street parking if you are driving.  The owners are friendly, but not intrusive.  I will stay there again when I am in Seattle!"
1351716,37318639,2015-07-06,33237304,Helen,"This was my first Airbnb so understandably I didn't know what to expect. This was an excellent experience and my friends and I are so glad we stayed here for 2 nights! Huong and Bill answered all questions I had before via email and text. The house itself is cozy, clean, and just as described. Hosts even included some little snacks, food, and water in the fridge. My friends and I instantly felt comfortable. The neighborhood is a quiet residential street with ample streetside parking. Highly recommended."
1351716,37904364,2015-07-11,37092240,Alan,"Felt welcomed by Huong and Bill, we didn't really interact with them much because our schedule was filled. However they did welcome us and were quite hospitable. The place is great for the 2 nights that we stayed at in the Atlantic area. There is a bus stop in close proximity. "
1351716,38124183,2015-07-13,5399916,Becky And Justin,"Huong and Bill contacted us a week before our trip and gave us all the information we needed.  The neighborhood is quiet and sweet and we managed to walk to the Cheeky Cafe (0.2 miles) for Saturday breakfast (no wait at 9-10am and yummy fry bread).  It is also located walking distance to the Seattle Bouldering Project (Climbing Gym) and that was awesome too.  Perfect location for us.  Plenty of street parking.  We didn't interact with Bill or Huong in person because there just wasn't a need, everything was great.  "
1351716,38636981,2015-07-17,35777952,Mary,My daughter and I had a great time in Seattle and Huong and Bill's place met our needs perfectly. It was comfortable and they were very friendly.
1351716,39384520,2015-07-23,19110678,Luc,Very pleasant cottage located in nice residential area. Clean and functional. Just what we needed for the 4 of us
1351716,40121976,2015-07-28,2488774,Jason,It's good. It is quite neighborhood. 
1351716,41231509,2015-08-05,37061795,Frank,"We were in Seattle to locate an apartment from my daughter to pursue grad school.  The target area for our search was Capitol Hill and First Hill.  Huong and Bill's cottage was a great ""base camp"" for this search although the bus lines were a little bit of a walk to reach.  The on-street parking was very nice, particularly in this very difficult city for parking.  Bill greeted my daughter on her early arrival and made her feel at home.  The cottage was as represented and served our needs fine.  Our trip coincided with a record Seattle heat wave, but this is not the fault of our hosts.  The cottage had fans available which helped enormously. (Most of Seattle is w/o A/C)"
1351716,41635987,2015-08-08,18457080,Jia,We totally enjoyed our stay in Huong's place. It is located in a very convenient and quiet neighborhood. Would recommend to friends.
1351716,42853817,2015-08-16,15182651,Carlin,"My stay in Seattle was great.  The hosts made me feel very welcome with great communication, and holding my luggage for me while their previous guests checked out.  The neighborhood was charming, quiet, and safe.  I had everything I needed while staying at Huong and Bill's cottage. "
1351716,43392792,2015-08-19,38461968,Joeri,Perfect location to visit Seattle!
1351716,43829378,2015-08-22,6297371,Patrick,Very friendly and made it very simple to come and go. The home was very clean. I would recommend this place to anyone visiting the Seattle area. 
1351716,44190570,2015-08-24,3333596,Sandra,"Huong and Bill's guest house was a perfect place for us to stay on our visit to Seattle.  The place was clean, cute, accessible, and exactly as described.  Bill checked in with me over the weekend to make sure we had everything we needed and was lovely.  I definitely recommend staying here."
1351716,44494883,2015-08-26,12161849,Naveen,"Huong and Bill were great hosts! The cottage was very cozy and comfortable, and there was more than enough space for 3 people. I ran into Bill as we had got into town a bit early (1:30pm instead of 2pm, check-in was at 2pm), he was very accepting of us beginning our stay half hour early, which was very generous. We didn't see Huong or Bill for the rest of our time in Seattle (2 days, 1 night), the cottage felt like ours for the stay, the complete autonomy was pleasantly comforting. They also labeled all of the switches and left instructions for entering and leaving the cottage, both details were extremely helpful. I would highly recommend staying with Bill and Huong while visiting Seattle. I look forward to booking with them during my next Seattle visit!"
1351716,44847046,2015-08-29,42042354,Joshua,"Quiet neighborhood, lots of street parking available, very close to Bus Stops that take you downtown, and had comfortable beds. Host very friendly, provided us with any additional necessities when asked. Provide guests with many travel guides and suggestions for restaurants or attractions as well as public transportation routes."
1351716,45261508,2015-09-01,32858429,Steven,"Huong and Bill welcomed us to their cottage with clean towels, beverages in the fridge, and sheet with useful information about Seattle.

They responded quickly to all emails and texts  and made sure we had everything we needed. The cottage was clean and felt like a home.

The neighborhood felt safe. I looked up crime data in the area and there was little to no crime, which was reassuring.

I would recommend Huong and Bills cottage if you are traveling to Seattle."
1351716,45609766,2015-09-04,41449103,Gieyun,"The whole pace was very clean and neat. My family had a great time in Seattle, being able to rest whenever we came back to the cottage house."
1351716,46743659,2015-09-13,19348977,John,"This is the perfect place to stay if you have a car and are looking to put your bags down and go exploring in the city.  Bill and Huong provide everything you need to keep your focus on your vacation.  There was plenty of street parking right out front when we got back after 9pm and the neighborhood is quiet as can be.  Added bonus, there is a bread factory near by and the air smell amazing when you head out in the morning!  Bill and Huong were great at communicating.  Their instructions were crystal clear so we were able to pull up, get inside, get on wifi, and enjoy a few pieces of candy they put out for us without having to send them any questions.  This was the best AirBnB experience you can ask for."
1351716,47389525,2015-09-18,38402147,Carol,"The listing was accurate. We never saw our hosts as we were out most of the time. Therefore, didn't see much of the neighborhood."
1351716,47741056,2015-09-21,40078623,Lauren And Mike,"Huong and Bill were great hosts.  Everything was exactly as pictured on the website.  Our method of transportation to and from was using Amtrak. The house was very close to the train station as well as other activities to do in the city.  They were very responsive to all questions and they have an unending supply of magazines/travel guides to help you with your travels. We were not at the house very much, but it seemed to be a very safe and quite neighborhood.  "
1351716,48755885,2015-09-28,16202343,Jonathan,"Very nice cottage, close in to city sights and to freeway, yet quiet. Check-in easy. House was very tidy and well equipped. The cottage is truly adorable! Excellent guest information. Neighborhood diverse and changing with fair selection of eateries nearby. We requested a second bed, which our hosts set up for us and which was very comfortable. 

Despite never meeting our hosts face to face, we felt that they genuinely cared about us and wanted to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Met and exceeded our expectations!"
1351716,49641238,2015-10-05,34623316,Galen,Overall a great stay. The guesthouse was very clean and had all the amenities I needed for my stay in Seattle.  The place is close to the International District/ Chinatown Central Link light rail station which makes it easy to get to/from the airport.  Downtown is also a short bus ride away or a 30 minute walk.   I would highly recommend Huang and Bill's guesthouse if you need a place to stay close to downtown Seattle. 
1351716,49947737,2015-10-07,6012345,Debbie,We received a friendly greeting from Bill and were shown the cottage.  It was very roomy and comfortable.  Quality furnishings and linens are important to me and I was pleased with everything.  The cottage was very clean and well equipped.  The neighborhood seemed very safe and quiet.  The location was just great for getting into downtown and to Century Link Field for a SeaHawks game.  My husband and I work remote and the WiFi worked well for checking in at work.  I highly recommend it.
1351716,50695308,2015-10-13,6793920,Renee,"The listing description was super accurate. The place was tidy and fit our needs perfectly. The neighborhood was really nice and quiet. Our bed was pretty comfortable and we got to watch our favorite shows at night.The hosts were very responsive over text and answered our questions. Also gave us a heads up that Obama was in town, so we knew what areas in downtown to avoid. "
5680462,35080728,2015-06-15,28059511,Gay,"We loved the location and the spaciousness of the house.  We had an extended family of ten, including two children under age five.  With only two showers there were times we waited in line.  The nearby bus stop/line served us well for getting downtown.  A few in our group had bicycles and were able to ride all over Seattle - the best way to travel.  We enjoyed several of the nearby restaurants - easily within walking distance - and the nearby market was very convenient.  The playroom upstairs is a paradise for children of all ages.  The youngsters also enjoyed the backyard swingset.  Sarah and Daniel were very attentive and helpful."
5680462,35647662,2015-06-21,14841443,Jonathan,Beautiful newly constructed house in a great neighborhood.  Well maintained and clean.  Convenient to almost everything in Seattle.  Host was very responsive the entire time leading up to and during our stay. Parking was easy.
5680462,36145909,2015-06-25,13346664,Jose,"Awesome place, plenty of parking and the park in front of the house was definitely a plus to enjoy coming back from work."
5680462,36815601,2015-07-01,51949,Amy,"Sarah has extensive instructions that lay out what is expected of guests, which is always appreciated. Her house is lovely and is in a great neighborhood. The attic is a nice space for groups to hang out in. The finishings in the house are very nice, but delicate. "
5680462,37778096,2015-07-10,24877257,Amy,One of the cutest and nicest air bnbs I have rented! I loved the decor and the entire house ... Wonderful host and enormous 3rd floor to watch movies and play!!!!! Loved the yard and the location is superb!!!! Many thanks! 
5680462,38651808,2015-07-17,26182840,Hailey,"We rented the house for a film shoot and had an excellent experience! 

If you're looking for a large, wonderfully laid out, beautifully decorated home, this is it!

Sarah was wonderful to work with & made the whole process easy and enjoyable! "
5680462,39270997,2015-07-22,31171203,Laurence,The house is terrific and is in a great neighbor.  Sarah is just starting to rent it out and there were a few glitches.  When we arrived there was no guide to the house so we didn't have the Internet password.  That was important since one of us had important business to do.  Sarah didn't get the password and the guide to us until the next morning.  The shower in the master bathroom wasn't working.  Sarah said that with one guest after another there was no time to fix it.  But for the price we paid we should have had the shower.  But I'm sure she'll take care of these matters in the future. But I don't want to make too much of this.  I'd go back in a minute.
5680462,40448627,2015-07-31,602059,Marianne,Our stay at Sarah's house was great for our family of 7. The 3rd floor was an awesome play area that our toddler loved and my 11 year old niece was overjoyed by the swing in the backyard. Sarah was a gracious host and was always just a phone call away. Thank you Sarah for a lovely stay in Seattle. 
5680462,41480471,2015-08-07,17159547,David,"Great house in a great neighborhood in Seattle. Very kid friendly with play structure in back and third floor room with TV projector and big space. Everything was clean, well kept. Couldn't ask for anything more. "
5680462,42276982,2015-08-12,10328919,Sean,"Sarah was a great host,  the house  was exactly as described on the listing.  

The house was clean, extremely spacious and well equipped. We would definately recommend the house to any guests."
5680462,44568297,2015-08-27,20172279,Geoff,"The house is very spacious and comfortable. 
But the listing isn't entirely truthful: it is really 4 bedrooms and only 2 full baths (and a 1/2 bath), 1 of which is within the master bedroom. That leaves only one bath/shower for everyone other than the master bedroom occupants. You have to read down to ""guest access"" to see that some of the listed bathrooms, as well as bedrooms, are actually a separate rental.

We enjoyed the location in a convenient quiet neighborhood, with a schoolyard, playground and basketball courts right across the street that the kids loved. 

The host was helpful and responsive via email and text."
5680462,44894780,2015-08-30,28912846,Arielle,Sarah's home is as beautiful in person as it is in the pictures (if not more so).  We had a large group of 11 people and were able to accommodate everyone comfortably.  At night we gathered together on the third floor to enjoy the spacious living room area.  I would definitely recommend staying in this beautiful Queen Anne home again--it was a wonderful part of our Seattle experience!!!
5680462,45924551,2015-09-07,2664389,Davey,"This has been one of the best AirBnB experiences we have had!  Sarah has been great, and very helpful/responsive.  We were a large family group in town for a wedding, and the house VERY comfortably fit all 13 of us along with a toddler.  The space is very comfortable and well designed!  I highly recommend!!!"
5680462,46866372,2015-09-14,6789543,Holly,"We have just left Sarah's beautiful Seattle home, our home for the past several days.  It worked well for our extended family, especially the grandkids.  They loved playing on the swing set and in the playroom!  We never cooked there but the high end appliances were lovely.  We walked a block to a great bakery and well equipped market.  The extensive list of house rules were easy to follow! There are not a lot of bathrooms but they are large.  It's a great family house!"
5680462,47272794,2015-09-17,41303695,Jennifer,We had a wonderful time staying at Sarah's home. It is very comfortable and clean. The finishes in the kitchen and bathrooms were beautiful. Sarah was very welcoming when we checked in so we felt right at home. We frequently got coffee and breakfast at a nearby bakery. There were plenty of dining options within walking distance which was great! I would definitely stay in this home again or recommend it to friends.
5680462,53453305,2015-11-09,39069476,Ariana,"A group of my friends and I stayed here for three nights and were absolutely thrilled with the house! It fit all 12 of us comfortably without feeling like we were on top of each other. There were plenty of beds, towels, bathrooms, and ""chill"" space. We even chose to stay in and hang out one night instead of going to a bar. There was plenty of parking as well. I highly recommend this house, especially for groups. The owners were very informative and helpful, and quick to respond when corresponding. "
5680462,53819830,2015-11-13,27255051,Nicole,"Sarah's home is so cute and inviting. It was everything we needed and more! She was also super helpful and accommodating. The location was great, it was within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and shops. I would definitely recommend her home to anyone wanting a relaxing and accessible Seattle experience."
5680462,54083182,2015-11-15,40400459,Marty,"Great location.  Clean, gracious home. Accommodating host. Would be happy to return. Thanks,  Sarah!"
7350059,38800953,2015-07-18,33162977,David,"Tim and Ryan were extremely gracious hosts and took us out to several fun drinking spots around the neighborhood (which were all close as they are situated in the heart of the Capitol Hill action) . The room was brand new, we had access to our own bathroom, and they let us use the kitchen and family room space as if it was our own! Would highly recommend, Renae and I will be back!!"
7350059,39564863,2015-07-24,38350750,Kelly,"My friend and I were only able to stay two nights but I wish it could have been longer. Ryan is so amazingly nice and thoughtful! He genuinely wanted us to enjoy our trip and was incredibly helpful with ideas of what to do and how to get around. The room is just as pictured, very clean, stylish, and new. Their whole house is, actually. It is in a great location! It's a very friendly, cute, quiet neighborhood that is a block away from bus stops, shopping, and dining. What more could you ask for? Their dogs, Hugo and Gladys, are so sweet and well behaved, it made the stay even better. The dogs are a bit older so they do not have a ton of energy and they are very quiet if you wanted to avoid them completely you could, that is until you see how adorable they are."
7350059,39844432,2015-07-26,31174283,Kyle,Ryan and Tim were great! The room and house were very nice and comfortable and they had lots of information and suggestions about the area. We ended up coming back late one night and stayed up hanging out with Ryan until dawn. Very fun hosts!
7350059,40262568,2015-07-29,38424478,Jen,"Tim and Ryan made our stay incredibly comfortable and worry-free by offering great recommendations and tips to help us around the city. They assisted us in transportation, giving us tips on a handy bus app that helped incredibly, events around the city, delicious options for food, etc. They catered their recommendations around what we liked, which made it more personal. The location is incredible. Walking distance to popular bars, restaurants, shops, parks, and bus routes. We couldn't have imagined staying in another neighborhood of Seattle. We definitely recommend staying here!"
7350059,40540621,2015-07-31,2223731,Kent,"Tim and Ryan were good hosts and offered a comfortable room with private bath.  The pictures are accurate, the neighborhood quiet and I liked plenty of street parking.  With the visitor parking pass that they provided, I didn't have to worry about the 2 hour daytime limit.  I liked the central location and was happy they could accommodate me at somewhat last minute.  "
7350059,41654423,2015-08-08,38619417,Ben,"Tim and Ryan were awesome. This was our first experience with airbnb and it couldn't have been better. They were affable and welcoming. They even went out of their way to help us when we got lost downtown. Overall a fantastic time, and their place is in a great location. "
7350059,42003289,2015-08-10,38263384,William,"My Trip to Seattle was really great. Tim & Ryan is a great host. The house is very neat and tidy. I love their dogs, they are very friendly. The place is really perfect like a hotel. "
7350059,43100458,2015-08-17,38960273,Nicholas,"We had a wonderful experience for our first time using Airbnb.  Tim is a great host (Ryan was out of town for our whole trip).  He offers helpful suggestions when asked, but he is never intrusive or nosy about it.  The room isn't huge for two people, but it is clean and the bed is quite comfortable.  Dogs are well-behaved and do not shed much.  The neighborhood is pretty quiet and residential, and it's quite a hike walking back from downtown since it's almost entirely uphill from most downtown sights.  All in all, it was a fair price for a good ""home base"" for the week."
7350059,46916740,2015-09-14,6509742,Max,"This is a lovely space. Tim & Ryan were quite friendly, but were also happy to let me have my privacy. The house in general felt quiet and private, but conveniently located within a few minutes Uber ride to lots of what Seattle has to offer.

Their two dogs are sweet, and only occasionally made doggy sounds. I hardly even noticed them."
7350059,48396677,2015-09-26,40171219,Arisa,"I really enjoyed my stay at Tim and Ryan's house! They made me feel at home. The house is clean and nicely furnished and very tasteful! And their dogs are adorable! I was encouraged to use the common spaces. It was my first time to stay outside of a hotel in the US and I would definitely stay again. The location was very convenient to the university of WA, and downtown by bus. Thanks for a great time. "
7350059,48722762,2015-09-28,35084134,Allison,"Tim and Ryan were perfect hosts!  The room and bathroom were very clean and well-furnished, with plenty of clean towels.  I felt very welcome in the kitchen and living area, and came and went easily with my key. 

Tim and Ryan were very kind and helpful; before I arrived, they provided me with a detailed guide to their favorite spots in the city and transportation tips (I loved the Pronto Cycle Share system), and they were easily accessible via text for any further questions during my stay. They also let me leave my bag at the house after checkout, since my flight was later in the afternoon, which I appreciated, as I was able to soak up the city until the last minute without rolling my luggage around.

The location was great. I felt safe walking alone late at night or early in the morning, and there were always people out and about. Tons of food, drinks, coffee, and night life were within walking distance, and downtown/Pike Place Market was a quick bike ride away.

City, neighborhood, home, and hosts were beautiful and friendly.  I would stay here again for sure. Tim and Ryan were excellent communicators, gave me plenty of space, and accurately represented their listing."

7350059,49917958,2015-10-07,44124210,Jade,"Such a great experience! You guys gave us great recommendations on places to visit and see! You were both very welcoming and I know I felt right at home! I'm hopeful that in the future, other Airbnb experiences will be the same! Thanks for making our Seattle experience amazing!"
7350059,51483349,2015-10-20,4024304,Tina,"Great location, best hosts, space as pictured and enjoyed staying here. Would stay again. Tim and Ryan have a great sense of humour and are very charming (and handsome!) 
Provided with a comprehensive list of Seattle recommendations which was greatly appreciated. 
Would recommend!!"
7350059,53570277,2015-11-09,33948197,Quynh,"it was a great experience! Tim and Ryans place was super clean and nicely decorated! It was also located in a great location. Ryan was out of town when we were there so we primarily interacted with Tim. He was a great guy and really helpful. We had great directions and recommendations on where to go, which was awesome considering my friend and I have never been to Seattle. Had a great weekend and will def try to be back to visit seattle! "
7350059,54369357,2015-11-19,35219746,Marcelo,"What can we say about these guys? Really?!? We love them!
Tim was there for us all the time, since our arrival at the house (which was really confortable...oh what a good bed to sleep). We felt like home.
Ryan arrived after a travel and he's so funny and kind.
They were thoughtful and gave us a guide they made about good food, bars, transportation etc.
The dogs are really friendly and lazy and cute.
We'll miss them all :)

Ohh and Tim is really good at reporting the weather! Kind of a personal weather man! He gave us tips of what to do depending of the weather of the day.

We'll come back to Seattle and we'll stay there again."
7350059,54945886,2015-11-25,49279855,Peter,"Tim & Ryan were the perfect hosts for me embarking on my first Airbnb experience. Their home is warm and welcoming, as are Tim & Ryan as hosts. As I am someone unfamiliar with Seattle, they were wonderful resources who provided me with several recommendations during my stay. The bedroom/bathroom setup allowed me to have private space as well; and everything was very clean and tidy as shown in the pictures. The location of their home is ideal, as several neat shops/restaurants/bars are very walkable. Oh, and their two dogs are of course a plus -- very sweet and not loud at all. I would highly recommend Tim & Ryan's place to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in the Emerald City! "
7350059,58168283,2016-01-01,47644247,Amanda,"Tim and Ryan were excellent hosts, very helpful and accommodating. We were only there for a short stay but they gave helpful suggestions for where to go, what to do, and how to get there. The room and bathroom were neat and clean. Wonderful, well behaved dogs. "
945645,25763267,2015-01-25,25909517,Ann,"The location was great, the amenities were spot on, the instructions and location of keys/parking/ect were understandable and accurate.  Overall, a great experience. "
945645,36148801,2015-06-25,6246516,Ben,The neighborhood was wonderful and extremely close/convenient to Pike Place and many of Seattle's infamous attractions. The directions were clear and the apartment was well stocked and very accommodating. We loved it!
945645,38424853,2015-07-15,36666675,Ragan,Emma was great! She was quick to respond and made the booking and check-in process seamless. The location of the apartment was perfect! I would definitely consider booking again if I return to Seattle. 
945645,42609615,2015-08-14,22709751,Amy,The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
945645,49246063,2015-10-02,8675109,James,Great apartment in a superb location....Emma was a fabulous host!  Loved being in the middle of everything!  The upper roof-top terrace was amazing for watching the sunset with a glass of wine!

945645,52709865,2015-11-01,44771839,Kwan,"Unbeatable location, (2-minute walk to Pike Place Market). Apartment is cozy, comfortable and clean - Feels like home to me. This apartment comes with a roof-top terrace and free parking which makes things even better. Emma is a great host and provided clear instructions for our stay. Overall experience is great, and will definitely consider this apartment when I visit Seattle again!"
945645,53482798,2015-11-09,9288959,Abba Candice,"Awesome location to really get the Seattle experience!  Everything is at your ""backyard,"" literally! The place was ideal for a group of friends on a weekend getaway. Great view of the Seattle wheel, nearby neighbors like the  Four Seasons Hotel, Gum Wall, Pike Place Market. You simply just leave your bag at the condo, and discover Seattle with ease. Having an in unit washer and dryer was very helpful to refresh laundry, towels, etc. "
5397134,28429049,2015-03-23,29063953,Ming,"We stayed for 3 nights and felt right at home. The place was spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and bright for a basement apartment. The bed was super comfortable, wifi connection was excellent, and the kitchen had everything we needed to prepare a meal when eating out became expensive. The hosts live above so light footsteps can be heard, but it was minimal. We hardly noticed the traffic noise despite being next to the I-5 freeway. 

Proximity to popular Seattle attractions in Ballard, Fremont, and Downtown is 15 minutes or less by car. When we didn't want to drive, it was short walk from the apartment to local eateries, businesses, and Green Lake (great place to go for a run or stroll).

Scott was a great host and quick to respond to any questions we had prior to our arrival and during our stay. The jar of cookies was a welcome treat."
5397134,28911862,2015-03-31,521425,Andrew,"Great little apartment in a quiet residential neighborhood. The apartment was super-clean and everything worked. Check-in process was very smooth. Scott provided excellent instructions and neighborhood map. Should you have a car, there's ample street parking, but there are also supermarkets and restaurants within walking distance."
5397134,30256464,2015-04-19,6823870,Yena,"This flat was the perfect base camp for our weekend trip to Seattle. Scott was incredibly responsive from the start and he and his wife were great hosts. The space is surprisingly large, and if the spot wasn't as close as it is to some amazing neighborhoods, we would have taken advantage of the full sized kitchen.
The house is a stone's throw from Green Lake Village, and a short drive to Ballard, Fremont, and Downtown Seattle. Even better, though it's close to the freeway, the actual house is kind of tucked away and quiet.
If you couldn't tell, we had an amazing experience and would recommend this spot to anyone looking for a fun weekend in the city!"
5397134,32083933,2015-05-13,32455339,Hou,"The host is waiting for us in his house when we arrive the house. Actually the host is living above the room we rented, so it is very convenient to contact with him. After giving me the key, the host spend some time introducing the neighborhood and give good suggestions on some places to go and eat. Also they have maps and tour guides in the room so don't need to feel nervous if you have no plan. The house is built in a quite and convenient neighborhood very suitable for residential using. There is a supermarket called PCC very closed to the house. We went there every night during our four days trip. 
The house is decorated with a careful and beautiful heart. It can be a good place to live if you want to feel the happiness being a residence here. "
5397134,32575644,2015-05-19,16027278,Ron And Georgina,"We had a great stay. Place was nicely decorated, very clean and recently renovated. Double bed was very comfortable. The location was perfect for our 3 days of looking around Seattle, only about 10 minutes to downtown. Lots of good communication and we met Scott and his family when we arrived. They offered lots of help and they had lots of books, brochures etc in the flat. We would highly recommend making this your base for a trip to Seattle. Thanks Scott and family."
5397134,33123577,2015-05-25,1797940,Noman,"With us having a 1 yr old baby we were looking for a place that was comfortable, safe and convenient.   
Place was super comfortable and clean.  Scott was even kind enough and provided us a pack&play crib and toys for our baby. 
Which saved us a hassle of bringing those along. 
Location was perfect.  In one of the best neighborhoods in Seattle.  Very close to restaurant, shops, lake, playground and park. Short drive to Pike market and other attractions. Parking was super easy and right in front of the house.  

Scott and his wife were perfect host. He provided many recommendations for the weekend activities and for eating out, which were very helpful.
He provided excellent and detailed communication throughout our stay. We also enjoyed meeting their little girl.  
I highly recommend staying here when you are visiting Seattle.  "
5397134,33840230,2015-06-01,30303351,Megan,Everything about this stay was fabulous. Loved the space. Our host communicated clearly and promptly. We walked to Green Lake every morning. It was a great home base for our busy weekend of interviewing for a job.
5397134,37294025,2015-07-06,24408929,Ming,"I rented Scott's place for my aunt and uncle to stay for two months as his apartment is close to my house. Check-in was super easy and flexible. Scott was a great host...he even provided my aunt and uncle with fresh vegetables from their garden. The apartment is perfect for an extended stay. Everything you need is available. My aunt and uncle loved walking everywhere to three grocery stores and especially strolls around Green Lake. I highly recommend Scott's place if you need a place to stay. As I mentioned, I'm Scott's neighbor and IMHO it's a great central location to explore Seattle or stay like a local."
5397134,40716479,2015-08-02,24408929,Ming,"I booked Scott's place for two months for my aunt and uncle while they stayed here. The place was a wonderful place for a short-term or weekend stay. Scott made sure everything you need is available, even olive oil for cooking! I will definitely book Scott's place again for other family who come."
5397134,41584211,2015-08-08,329813,Joy,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at this apartment. It was beautifully decorated, clean, and well-appointed. The neighborhood had many places to shop, eat, and walk, and the bus to Seattle was in easy reach. Highly recommended!"
5397134,42661186,2015-08-15,14358537,Romy,"The space was fantastic and Greenlake is a beautiful location!  Close to great shops, restaurants and just minutes from the park.   Scott and his family were excellent hosts.  Now that we have family living in Seattle, we will definitely book again!"
5397134,43449925,2015-08-19,26446647,Sean,Wonderful Airbnb experience! Very nice host and great location.
5397134,43944587,2015-08-23,2934983,Sandra,"My partner and I stayed at the Green Lake Suite for three nights while we visited Seattle. It was wonderful! Scott's description of the place is very accurate and the pics show the place well, but it's even better in person. It's clean and cozy and has everything you need. The location is also incredibly convenient. Scott was very helpful and communicative from initial contact through checkout. And we were grateful for the bonus item: a bowl of tomatoes picked from from Scott's family's garden! I recommend this place highly. It will be my first choice for future visits to Seattle. "
5397134,45086280,2015-08-31,36665820,JaneAnn,"The space was exactly as described.  Very clean and accessible.   Contact with the host was super easy and he always replied in a timely manner.  The Green Lake area was nice and we felt very safe walking to a from places, esp in the evenings.  As well as, an easy commute to the downtown areas.  We would def look here first the next time we visit the Seattle area and would most def recommend this location to a friend.  "
5397134,46600142,2015-09-12,15953144,Julie,"My partner and I stayed here for 9 nights with our 6 month old, and it was absolutely perfect for our visit!  We used it as our home base for visiting family all over town and taking day trips to the mountains and islands.  The space is very comfortable and has a fully functional kitchen and nice spacious bathroom.  It is easy walking distance to Greenlake as well as grocery stores, coffee shops and restaurants.  The hosts provided us with extras for the baby like toys and a pack-and-play, which was especially appreciated.  I would highly recommend this place if you are looking for a home away from home in a great Seattle neighborhood!"
5397134,48284791,2015-09-25,23169019,Willow,"Our stay at Scott's spacious Green Lake Suite was wonderful. Scott's communication was consistently quick, and the entry was easy as there is a lock box with key inside. I loved the neighborhood...being so close to Green Lake, and two major health food stores just down the street. I know Seattle well, and many major main routes---bus lines included----can take you anywhere without having to be on I-5. Which is a big plus for me! And although the Suite is located close to I-5....it is amazingly quiet. We highly recommend Scott's place, and will stay there on future Seattle visits."
5397134,49037099,2015-09-30,41413929,Maurice,"We really enjoyed our stay at Scott's suite. It was extremely convenient and easy walking distance to both Green lake and Roosevelt neighborhoods. Although it was near the freeway, the noise was not noticeable. The hosts were gracious and responded to us immediately. We would definitely stay there again."
5397134,49835391,2015-10-06,17012930,Qian,"The location of the house is very nice, close to the UW and green lake, the room is very clean, the owner is very careful is also very friendly! Let me had a pleasant holiday！"
5397134,50518039,2015-10-12,31548221,David,No complaints really. The room was as expected. Had no interactions with the hosts.
5397134,51211922,2015-10-18,37937351,Patrick,"Scott was extremely accommodating and welcoming. While we didn't get a chance to meet, he made sure we had everything we needed and our stay went smoothly. The apartment was just as described and the easily walkable to Greenlake."
5397134,51965144,2015-10-25,12361907,Janae,"Wow, what an amazing experience! You can tell Scott and his wife put a lot of love into this space which made our stay extremely comfortable and worthwhile. Scott was excellent in terms of communication and even went out of his way to recommend his favorite spots. We arrived to Seattle very late on a weekday but Scott made key access very easy so we were able to settle in as soon as we arrived. The apartment was exactly what we were looking for in terms of location and space. Very clean and cozy, which made us feel right at home (not to mention the bed was SUPER comfortable!) 5 steps away from the freeway made commuting so easy! Awesome cafes, bars and restaurants in close proximity. Will definitely stay here again!"
5397134,55371872,2015-12-01,9195666,Ben,"Perfect spot for out needs. Clean, very clean, nicely laid out/ and decorated. Host was probably around less than usual based on previous reviews due to the holidays but was easily accessible at all times through the Air BnB app whenever we had questions. None of this came a huge surprise to us given the history of positive feedback, was just as good as advertised. The most unexpected thign about our stay was how much we liked the area. Stayed in the aprtment out first month in Seattle while looking for a permanent place. Didn't think we were going to live in the Green lake area long term but it grew on us quickly and we preferred it to the downtown area and others. everything was still easily accessed through public transportation and the lake and less congested feel of the area really appealed. Ended up getting  spot on the other side of the lake.

"
5397134,57810832,2015-12-29,40990755,Chris,"This was a really neat place to stay. Although we only used it to sleep, it had everything you'd want if you were spending more of the day there. There was a laundry area, closet space, as well as a private kitchen, and books about exploring Seattle. Loved the attention to detail and the little things just as much. The heater was on when we first got there and so were the lights. Definitely felt welcomed and the love they put into this place. Looked exactly like the pictures."
9512909,56531778,2015-12-14,26603967,Bruce,I had a great stay here. Paul & Izabela were very communicative and kind every step of the way. I would definitely recommend.
9512909,57145337,2015-12-22,49529890,Kun,"Paul and Izabela are soooo nice! They picked us up from the station, offered many useful advises for transportation and attractions. Such a warm welcome! The apartment is sweet and spacious, all kinds of utilities provided. Just one minutes walk we can overview the lake, scenery around is much beyond our expectation. Really wanna come back next time!"
948077,3954322,2013-03-30,3157082,Courtney,"This cottage is an absolute GEM! We had a fabulous time staying here. The space is cozy and every detail is attended to (menus to local restaurants, recommendations, etc.) We especially enjoyed the luxurious heated towel rack and heated mattress pad. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood to stay in, and this cottage is extremely well situated. It is close to many restaurants and sights, and has the added bonus of being in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
948077,4130972,2013-04-12,419500,Lily,"My husband and I enjoyed every minute of our cottage experience.  It is a perfect little crash pad for a solo traveler or a couple.  Erik and Pamela have an impeccable eye for detail with their decor and housekeeping, and are very warm and welcoming in their communication.  We didn't use many of the cottage amenities because we were only there for a night, but this place would be great for any length of stay, with its fully functional kitchen and laundry facilities.  I have already started recommending this place to friends and family!  Thanks, y'all!"
948077,4175285,2013-04-15,3324488,Nicole,"Absolutely lovely! Thank you both, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.

Great neighbourhood, everything you need is provided for, including nightgowns, umbrellas, sleeping masks, hair dryer, even perfume. So cute! 

Only downside was that the wifi connection was unreliable, especially on my iPhone. Oh and the noisy leaf blower at 9am.

Other than that it was a perfect choice and I would definitely recommend your cottage to others!

For persons choosing to stay here: I recommend trying TOP POT and Joe Bar which are both very close by!"
948077,4189014,2013-04-16,1126505,Chris,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely garden cottage. It's just the right mix of quirky and comfortable, and it's located near a great part of town for dining, shopping and walking. "
948077,4425452,2013-05-04,711259,Christine,"I absolutely loved this place and Erik (didn't get to meet the lovely Pamela) was very welcoming and helpful. The cottage is tidy, well-designed, and centrally-located for all my meetings. I very much hope to stay here again the next time I'm back in Seattle! "
948077,4617194,2013-05-15,3293677,Chris,"My Wife and I went to Seattle on kind of a spur of the moment trip. We where able to book Erik + Pamela's great cottage apartment. It was easy to find and very private. Within walking distance to most of Capital Hill, (go to the Cannon bar), and even into Down Town if you are up for a bit of a walk. 

Before we arrived they told us about the ""Car2Go"" program in Seattle. 500 Smart cars scattered throughout the city that you can just jump in and go and are only charged by the minute. Gas, Insurance and public parking are all included. You do need to sign up for a ""Car2Go"" card about a week before go so you can get your card in the mail before your trip. It made exploring all of Seattle very easy. We even went to pikes place and bought fresh seafood and drove back to the house to cook dinner in the well stocked kitchen.

If you are still reading this review and deciding where to stay..... Stop thinking about it, just book this place and you won't be sorry, Scouts Honor! "
948077,4671262,2013-05-19,1294219,Owen,A great place in a great neighbouhood.  Lots of local restaurants and closish to the I5 for getting around.  The place was clean and exactly as described.
948077,4787172,2013-05-26,1009275,Jess,"Beautiful little cottage located in the Northwest section of Capitol Hill. Our cab driver had a bit of trouble finding it, but we had an easy walk to / from town once we got there. Cozy spot, has everything you could possibly need. We walked to / from the place 5-6 times over the course of 2 days, and I also got a beautiful run in through Volunteer Park and down on the bridge. We only had the pleasure of meeting Sean, but he was a gracious host and made some great recommendations. Highly recommend...."
948077,4835235,2013-05-28,191626,Lily,"we LOVED this place!!  just beautiful, quaint, charming.  there is a beautiful garden in front of the cottage that is just splendid. the cottage is so cutely designed... we were taking notes on how to decorate a studio well this entire weekend. the host was super responsive and hospitable. their attention to cleanliness and how generously they furnished the apt made our stay one of our favorite airbnb stays so far. we also loved their book collection.  

"
948077,4913256,2013-06-01,6586313,Shawn,"Stayed at Erik + Pamela Johnson's cute little cottage on my most recent trip to Seattle, very comfy and in a great location.  We enjoyed exploring the area restaurants and the quite neighborhood.  This little cottage has it all, you can't go wrong with this choice!"
948077,4964278,2013-06-04,424661,Caroline Wadad,"Staying at Erik+Pamel's cottage was the highlight of a great trip. The place is located in a wonderful area, it's quiet and absolutely charming, and they supply everything you may need (tea, coffee, toiletries, towels, heated towel rack, DVDs, books, even nail polish remover!). They were also very accommodating when I asked for a place to store our luggage after check out. In short, this place is a gem!"
948077,4987508,2013-06-05,31118,Fiona,A beautifully decorated garden cottage in a peaceful neighbourhood. Will come again! 
948077,5210421,2013-06-18,6204185,Erik,"This place is tucked into a green oasis on a quiet street.  Its simple and comfy inside with everything you need and lots of nice touches.  Short walk to good shopping and restaurant, just one hill.  :-)   All in all it was just about ideal, and I'd definitely go back."
948077,5302831,2013-06-23,6904545,Sean,"What a great place at a great location! It's close to capitol hill, downtown, uptown, belltown... if you want serenity and privacy just the outskirts of downtown Seattle, this place is IT. If you really want great views at one of the tall hotel buildings, you can fork several hundred $$ per night but I would rather stay at Erik and Pam's cottage. It's interior is impeccable - maybe except the deer head - and everything from the decor, color scheme and kitchen countertop was sweet! Plus the cottage is separate from the main house and is located in the middle of their lush, green garden. It's a shame that we stayed there only for a night and we will be back.. hopefully soon.."
948077,5828883,2013-07-18,113208,Katrine,"Staying in Erik and Pamela's cottage was perfect! Relaxed and quiet location but close to restaurants etc and a very cosy, clean and  well decorated cottage with all amenities you could think of. Also great with free parking. Erik and Pamela were great hosts, very friendly, easygoing and super helpful."
948077,5967241,2013-07-24,645782,Maurits,"it was just awesome and even better then expected, we needed to do some laundry since we've been traveling for a week already and we had our own washing machine and dryer waiting for us. 

Erik and Pamela were great hosts had a lot of tips and we were always free to ask them whatever we wanted to know."
948077,6272312,2013-08-06,3784409,Lia,"Great experience - Erik was super nice and let us leave our stuff at his house for the day because we weren't leaving Seattle until the afternoon. He even let us use his bathroom, etc when we got back from a hot and sweaty day trekking around Seattle. Super awesome, and would definitely stay there again!

"
948077,6869416,2013-08-28,6414012,Neil,"The cottage was very comfortable and it's a charming neighborhood. Didn't meet Pamela, but Erik was very friendly and graves tips on where to eat.  Everything seemed to be in walking distance for dining.  The bed was very comfortable.  The bathroom and shower were great and equipped with all the amenities we needed.  The decor was really neat.  If we come back to Seattle we would gask to stay there again."
948077,7067781,2013-09-05,1751590,Lane,"great location, clean, quaint, and quiet - that about sums up this little cottage. we are especially glad we rented a car as public transit didn't quite meet our NYC expectations, and there is a parking space at the cottage. Ultimately, its a perfect home base for anyone who wants to explore Seattle and the surrounding area. Our hosts provided some excellent recommendations for food too! "
948077,7640638,2013-09-28,6959464,Igor,"This garden cottage is the best choice for an unforgettable Seattle visit!

948077,9089376,2013-12-06,9019196,Michael,"This is a lovely little cottage only a couple of blocks away from happening Broadway in Capitol Hill. The Cottage is very well stocked, having everything you would need and more. I loved the robes! Such a nice spot and you can even see the space needle if you walk to the end of the street. Erik was a great host, giving us a helpful rundown of the area and he has stocked the cottage with plenty of helpful Seattle literature. Can't wait to go back!"

It is absolutely stunning, and very cozy & peaceful. Yet, it's on the very lively capitol hill, with everything you could want or need is within walking distance, which includes a gorgeous lookout over the city only two blocks away. Erik and Pamela are incredibly sweet and very helpful. The cottage is the ideal place to be able to call home at the end of the day. I can guarantee with complete certainty that you'll be beyond happy here. I plan on staying here on my next trip to Seattle, and until then will encourage everyone else to do the same. I don't believe you'll find somewhere that tops it. "
948077,9874665,2014-01-16,8120934,Devan,"We had an amazing time at Erik and Pamela's place! It was beautiful in a great area, easy to get around, and very cozy for our wonderful stay in Seattle. Would definitely stay there again and recommend it for all!"
948077,10418926,2014-02-18,352296,Beth,"THIS IS THE CUTEST COTTAGE. EVER. We absolutely loved our stay at Erik and Pamela's adorable cottage. Every detail in the cottage was attended to: restaurant menus, a hairdryer, cleaning supplies, logs, iphone charging cords, etc. The fireplace was incredible - we happened to visit Seattle during a particularly rainy and cold weekend....the fireplace kept the cottage romantic and cozy. Their place was within a five-ten minute walk of the hippest places in Capital Hill. Should we get an opportunity to return to Seattle again, we will DEFINITELY stay here! I could not recommend this cottage more!"
948077,11129238,2014-03-22,11636112,Elise,"Our stay here was a great one! We were hugely impressed with the warm and cosy feel of this place, along with all the little touches including bathroom products, coffee and numerous other things that were provided. You can really tell how much effort Erik and Pamela have put into being the best possible hosts and judging by the guest book, it doesn't go unnoticed. I would recommend this cottage to anyone staying in Seattle. Thanks! Elise and Scott. "
948077,11459477,2014-04-03,2734505,Keith & Yeva,"Great little cottage space!  Lovely garden, great location, and had all the amenities you could need including a fantastic DVD collection.  Would love to stay at Erik and Pamela's on my next trip to Seattle!"
948077,11839697,2014-04-16,941189,Joyce,"My boyfriend and I absolutely adored Erik and Pamela's cottage!! It was cute and quaint and had everything we needed from towels, toiletries, to all the movies you would ever want to watch! It was in a great location close to lots of restaurants and shops (if you're a fan of tacos, check out Taco Chuki). I'd say the best part was also that there was a designated parking spot and it was free! Erik and Pamela were extremely responsive and communicative and while we didn't meet them, were very attentive to all my messages. I'd highly recommend their cottage and would love to stay there again when I'm back in Seattle!"
948077,11929975,2014-04-19,526849,Angie,"The cottage is very cozy and have everything we need. we can see that Erik and Pamela thought out throughly what a guest would need for a comfortable stay. Thanks again for hosting us, we had a wonderful time!"
948077,12044160,2014-04-22,4413235,Olivia,"Erik and Pamela are airbnb pros!! My friend and I were so happy and in love with the place. They had everything you could possibly need. We didn't arrive to the apt until 11pm, but it was very easy to access and find the place. They were very accommodating with both our check in and check out times even though we didn't actually meet in person, they were easy to get in touch with. The neighborhood was safe, charming, and beautiful! We were sad to leave our garden cottage, but we definitely plan to stay there again if we make our way back to Seattle. "
948077,12439715,2014-05-02,233953,Samantha,"Loved this apartment! I would definitely stay here again. Quiet, safe, beautiful."
948077,12526806,2014-05-05,11525151,David,"We had a great stay and absolutely couldn't have asked for anything more. Overall the feeling is like having a home away from home!
1.Convenient location – we’re talking walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops …
2.Quiet, comfortable, and good parking (not insignificant!)
3.And how nice was it, on a cool rainy night, to find a corkscrew in the fully equipped kitchen to enjoy a bottle of wine, while watching a movie from the DVD library, in front of a nice warm fire in the fireplace!!!
Any return trip to the area will include a return to the Eric & Pamela’s cottage – thanx!
"
948077,12685870,2014-05-08,12272491,Barry,"This place was great! Nice, quiet and unique neighborhood. We could walk to everything! Erik and Pam have everything you could need in the cottage. I highly recommend for those of you looking to experience Seattle like a local!"
948077,13403932,2014-05-27,8183854,Zachary,"Erik and Pamela's garden cottage is a prime example of what makes Airbnb so successful.  These guys are true professionals and nailed every detail you'd want/need for a perfect trip to Seattle.  It is conveniently located in a quiet, safe, and beautiful hilltop neighborhood with great restaurants and shops within walking distance.  The cottage itself is beautiful and had everything we could have ever needed, including all types of resources and recommendations for things to do/see/eat/shop in Seattle.  I received major props from my girlfriend for choosing this place.   

Erik and Pamela were traveling during our stay so we never got to meet them but checking in/out was a breeze and we were very comfortable throughout our stay.  My girlfriend and I would definitely plan on staying here again for our next visit!

Thanks!
-Zack"
948077,13563645,2014-05-31,9530698,Steffen,"What a great place - we so much loved to stay at Erik & Pamela's Garden Cottage. Cozy, stylish, great location & easy parking ... We did get to meet Erik when we checked in and he gave as excellent recommendations for restaurants  as well as things to do in/ around Seattle. If you go to Seattle this is definitely the place to stay ! ;-)"
948077,14012804,2014-06-10,2971222,Steven,"Perfectly appointed gem! 
From the lush little pergola for morning tea, to the toasty under-matress heater, to the everything-you-could-possiby-need-or-want on a cottage retreat in Seattle, oh and power points in all the right places. It felt like home."
948077,14996730,2014-06-30,16821799,Jennica,First time airbnb stay and this amazing cottage could not have been more perfect!  The decor was lovely. The feel was cozy. Felt like we had a pet with the deer peerng in.  The neighborhood was fun for exploring. We walked to and from our place and reached the city center easily although we could have taken busses. Thank you for setting us up with some good coffee and chocolates on our arrival.  We'd love to come back and stay even longer and use all the good kitchen stuff to make dinner next time.
948077,15393764,2014-07-08,13130351,Kelly,"Outstanding!  Stay here if you are coming to Seattle!  Erik and Pamela have thought of everything you may need and more to make your stay comfortable and relaxing!  The cottage is adorable and cozy!  The garden area right out the front door is enchanting and the perfect place for morning coffee or wine in the evening - bug free also!
The cottage is a half block from Lake Union and we caught the amazing fireworks display on the 4th without having to fight traffic.  Also, great views of the Space Needle here.
Walking distance to several excellent restaurants, coffee, wine bars.
We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle!"
948077,19366704,2014-09-11,4065861,Kim,LOVED the Capitol Hill Cottage. Pam and Erik are super chill. The apartment had everything and then some. We really enjoyed our stay!
948077,21208250,2014-10-13,1808666,Emma,This place is amazing! Beautiful use of space. Everything we needed and then some! I will definitely be staying here next time I visit Seattle.
948077,21372222,2014-10-15,3881279,Michael,The reservation was canceled 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
948077,21636368,2014-10-20,5690211,Stephen,So pleased to be able to visit this space...a great find.  Well appointed and the best neighbourhood.  Really cannot recommend this rental and these hosts.  We are  hoping to spend a lot of time in this charming cottage!
948077,22133838,2014-10-31,14902741,Rial,"My husband and I came to Seattle for our honeymoon and were really excited to find an airbnb spot that would feel like a true home base.  It was so nice to have the flexibility of a kitchen.  The cottage was so cozy especially with the fireplace going.  What a treat it was to be able to walk across the street to coffee shops/ restaurants, and also be able to easily drive into the downtown area.  All in all a great spot for Seattle first timers."
948077,22458508,2014-11-07,16550877,Albert,"We had an excellent stay. The space was so well appointed and well thought out. The layout and all the amenities were great. Erik and Pamela really thought the design and layout through, no skimping on quality anywhere. There's even a mattress warmer! The bathroom shower dispenser was also a nice convenient touch. Very close to everything, beautiful neighborhood and outdoor space. I would not hesitate to recommend this place. It is great!"
948077,24082376,2014-12-19,1257421,Maggie,"This cottage is everything you hope for when you arrive at your AirBnb! It is stylish, well located, clean and welcoming! Erik was on site when we arrived and we enjoyed chatting with him and getting food recommendations.  (If you stay here, be sure to stop in to Barjot Cafe for coffee and their baked eggs!) Off street parking is a bonus for a Seattle stay, and we left our car for three days and explored the city by foot.  We'll be back! Thanks Erik and Pamela! "
948077,24413419,2014-12-28,13866457,Alayn,"The cottage was just as charming as the photographs, and was so well stocked. We lacked for nothing.  We enjoyed all of the dinning recommendations. Loved having a little fire in the fireplace, very cozy.  We would highly recommend the cottage to anyone visiting Seattle. "
948077,25097624,2015-01-06,3074770,Monica,"Everything about the cottage was perfect! It was so cozy and charming. The location was great too. Close to restaurants and bars and a quick Uber ride to museums. If I return to Seattle, I hope to stay in this fantastic place again!"

948077,25748215,2015-01-25,8241537,Rachel And Drew,We have already spoken about staying here again shall we visit Seattle in the future. Great location to downtown capital hill area as well as walkable to downtown. Quiet neighborhood. Cottage is super well equipped with everything you need for a stay. Comfortable and clean. I would highly recommend it and would stay again. 
948077,26183624,2015-02-06,1175971,Ilya,"Erik and Pamela have a beautiful cottage. Everything was nice and neat when I arrived, and parking my car was super easy. "
948077,27052768,2015-02-24,19733481,Thea,"Erik and Pamela's cottage was perfect for my week long visit to Seattle. My boyfriend and I felt comfortable and at home. The location is fantastic - within a 5 minute walk to cafes, bars, and restaurants. The towel heater in the bathroom was a fun surprise!"
948077,27231784,2015-02-28,24683483,Karen,"Erik and Pamela's cottage is beautiful. FANTASTIC. AMAZING. SUPERB. The cottage has everything one could ask for: a fully equipped kitchen, washer and dryer, a bathroom with heating pad on the wall so you don't feel cold after a shower, wifi, a bed that heats up, and a comfortable couch, etc.

Great location - walking distance to Broadway and restaurants and cafes in Summit Ave E area. The cottage is located in a nice, quiet neighborhood near Volunteer Park where all the fancy mansions are.

I met Erik in person and he is very friendly and thoughtful. You can tell that he is genuinely nice. He was good at responding tons of messages from me. On the last day, I had many hours to kill until my flight at night and Erik let me stay in the cottage past the check out time and even kept my luggage for me! 

I highly recommend the cottage to everyone. You must try this place if you are planning to airbnb in Seattle."
948077,27384492,2015-03-03,9776047,Hillary,"The apartment was everything my friend and I could have hoped for and more! It had everything we needed, it's in a perfect location, and Erik (and the host puppy!) were friendly and welcoming. We would definitely like to visit again next time we're in Seattle. "
948077,27539106,2015-03-07,2646509,Cameron,"Erik & Pamela have created an exceptional urban oasis.  Their gorgeous home offers an elegant, comfortable, cozy environment with endless amenities.  Situated in a quiet area of Capitol Hill, you feel like you're away from it all, when in fact you're only steps away from amazing restaurants (we loved ALL of their recommendations), and a short hike into downtown.  My partner and I had the pleasure of staying here for four nights.  Without a doubt, we will return.  It's one of those rare experiences that you love so much, you wish you could keep it all to yourself, but it's far too great to not share. "
948077,28472179,2015-03-24,17959303,Wade,"This cottage is fantastic. Erik and Pamela certainly kept details in mind when designing this cozy bungalow. The cottage gets plenty of natural light, has a wonderful working fireplace, great bathroom / shower / kitchen. The keypad on the door is convenient too! No fumbling for keys. Courtyard is beautiful, and the parking spot is easy to get to. No complaints here. Would definitely love to stay again!"
948077,28591475,2015-03-26,12934633,Ryan,"Erik was nice enough to accommodate my two day stay on short notice.  The space is well appointed, clean and met all of my needs.
Parking in this part of Seattle is very difficult, so the dedicated space next to the gate is fantastic!  

The towel warmers are something I haven't had before--nice touch.
Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend Erik & Pamela's place if you are visiting Seattle or in town for work."
948077,29814428,2015-04-13,21014551,Brigitta,"Erik and Pamela's Capitol Hill Cottage was a utter delight to visit  and call home for three nights! Capitol Hill is a beautiful neighborhood. The location is easily accessible to downtown Seattle, museums and the Space Needle. The cottage is warm, homey and has so many extra features. I will definitely consider staying at this airbnb cottage again."
948077,32313780,2015-05-17,4357262,Kathleen,"Erik thoughtfully stopped by to see how things were going. All good. Lots of nice details in place, and the cottage is charmingly decorated. "
948077,34175456,2015-06-05,23150938,Katie,"I stayed in the cottage while on a business trip alone and had a great experience. The cottage is very well equipped - fully functional kitchen, toiletries, etc. - and is very comfortable. The garden patio outside of the cottage was adorable, and I felt like I had a lot of privacy. I also loved the cozy and fun decor! It was a great place to come home to after work. "
948077,36504242,2015-06-29,23199254,Jan,We had a fabulous stay at Erik and Pamela's stylish little garden apartment.  It was comfortable and beautifully equipped; everything as described and just the ideal location for exploring Seattle.   Set in a gorgeous quiet district with tree lined streets and beautiful gardens it was a perfect restful and relaxed location at the end of our mainland US holiday.  We were able to walk downtown in 30 minutes and experience the many attractions of Seattle.  Thank you. Jan. 
948077,36804541,2015-07-01,469789,Elijah,"The space was so clean and cute!  It was very comfortable, hip, and private.  The garden is beautiful. I'd definitely recommend staying here.  Erik & Pamela definitely put a lot of care into creating a comfortable and happy space for their guests."
948077,38510923,2015-07-16,10037665,Christine,"Erik and Pamela's Capital Hill Stylish Garden Cottage is an unbelievable find in a gorgeous residential neighborhood, just a few blocks from the excitement on Broadway. The studio is squeaky clean,  bright and airy. The approach to the studio is through a small gated garden that only adds to the cottage's interior charm. What I truly loved and noticed was how thoughtfully placed everything was in the cottage. One feels much consideration went into putting this space together and how to make it easily accessible by a total strangers. Thank You, Erik & Pamela."
948077,39730510,2015-07-26,11312824,Mari,What a great place to stay. It's a beautiful cottage in a great location. It's a really nice neighborhood. Fun area to walk around and close to Volunteer Park which is beautiful. 
948077,40922158,2015-08-03,13960822,Ken,A tidy and well decorated space in a great location.  Got a little hot during the day but the space cools off quickly in the evening due to the double doors that can be opened onto a fantastic courtyard.  Erik and Pamela were very responsive to our communications.  
948077,41323472,2015-08-07,30409463,Mary,"This was our first visit to Seattle and our first airbnb experience. We would definitely stay here again!  The cottage was easy to find, was in a great neighborhood and the dedicated parking space was appreciated as we had rented a car. 

The hosts definitely put a lot of thought into the decor and furnishings of the cottage!  It was very clean and well maintained. We enjoyed the coffee and hot chocolate that were provided.  We purchased breakfast items from a nearby Whole Foods and liked being able to eat leisurely at the cottage before heading out to tour Seattle. 

We also liked the privacy of the cottage. We never met the hosts, although I am sure they would have responded to any needs or concerns.  

The cottage is not air conditioned and I suspect this is not normally needed in Seattle. It was very warm when we arrived, but opening the windows and using the fans provided enabled us to get a good night's sleep.  The rest of our three night visit was cooler, but not cool enough to need the fireplace or heated towel rack!  This would be a great cozy place to stay when it is cold!

We are so glad we stayed here and would definitely visit again if in Seattle. "
948077,43215672,2015-08-18,22865822,Brett,"We had a wonderful 2 day stay in this lovely cottage which is beautifully decorated and well organised. The neighbourhood is great, quiet and central to everything. I particularly loved waking up to the bright green leaves outside the window."
948077,45459829,2015-09-03,8074133,Jed,We loved the location and atmosphere of Erik and Pamela's place. It had everything we needed and we highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing spot in Seattle. 
948077,47968920,2015-09-22,37837080,Chauncey,"The cottage was just as described - in a very nice neighborhood, well located, and a quiet restful place.  Everything was in order when I arrived.  They hosts provided all that I needed and more - from coffee to robes, as well as a selection of umbrellas.  I was very pleased in all respects.  "
948077,48684266,2015-09-28,8158013,Kendra,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Capitol Hill cottage very much. We immediately felt at home at the cottage. It was very clean with lots of personal touches. It was a great central location for all the sightseeing and exploring of Seattle. The bus stop was a short walking distance away to get to downtown and there were many great restaurants, bars, coffee shops and boutiques just a few blocks away. We rented a car and the cottage conveniently has an off street parking space. 

Pamela was very accommodating. The power went out due to a fallen tree and she brought over an armful of candles for us to use until it was restored. We also got some great food recommendations. We definitely suggest trying out Barjot and Poppy for dinner, Roy Street Coffee & Tea for an espresso and Baitshop or The Lookout for drinks (all walking distance away)!

If you are visiting Seattle and are looking to really experience the city, the Capitol Hill Cottage is the place for you!"
948077,49179134,2015-10-01,44129314,Kelly,"Our stay at Capitol Hill cottage was amazing! It's absolutely beautiful and is just as the description says. It's cozy and relaxing. Although we didn't meet Erik and Pamela, you could tell they put a lot of themselves into their home and made every effort to make our trip great! From the book of suggested restaurants to the heated towel racks, we fully enjoyed our stay and our first air bnb experience. We love Seattle and next time we are in town we will definitely be visitng the Capitol Hill cottage again!"
948077,50210685,2015-10-10,9492636,Marjorie,The cottage was even more charming in person than in the photos. We appreciated the quiet and quaint neighbourhood and were able to check in late with no problem. The cottage also had lots of nice touch amenities that made staying there feel more like a home than a hotel. 
948077,50611539,2015-10-13,7698169,Rachel,We had the best time staying at the cottage! It feels a little secluded (in a great way) while simultaneously very ideally located in Capitol Hill - walkable to many great restaurants and bars. Communication was great throughout and Erik was awesome to bring us extra towels when requested. Washer/dryer and the Bluetooth Bose speaker were huge perks as well. Thanks to Erik and Pamela for the perfect place to spend our wedding weekend! 
948077,51693015,2015-10-24,31759377,Casey,Extremely close to Pikes Market and downtown! Erik was really helpful and had quite a few books and brochures listing things to do it the area. The guest house had lots of character and was clean and tucked back into a nice residential area. 
948077,52338987,2015-10-28,28177680,Becky,"The cottage is perfect, great location, beautifully decorated, clean and comfortable.  We stayed two nights at the cottage and everything was as described, if not better. The attention to detail didn't go unnoticed, even down to providing umbrellas for the rainy Seattle weather we experienced during our stay. Wish we could have stayed longer! "
948077,52573389,2015-10-31,9097498,Nathan,"We had a great time at this apartment!  Our hosts had a bunch of DVDs for us to watch, and they also had an awesome book of local restaurants that were very tasty too.  The neighborhood was quiet and we loved the garden in which the cottage was situated."
948077,54512561,2015-11-21,46316424,Jocelyn,"The cottage is so cozy and as described. I felt right at home, bundling up in the bed in the nook with a movie from their nice DVD library when it was rainy outside. I will definitely try to stay here again in the future. It's super close the main street for restaurants and transportation to go to Downtown. "
948077,56777347,2015-12-18,1423796,Narin,Everything was excellent. Very convenient and well equipped. Loved our stay and would return if back in Seattle! Thanks again! 
8755479,50715990,2015-10-13,22506958,Robert,"Britain was immediately responsive and helpful from the get-go. Our arrival was late, but she made clear accommodations for us. This immaculate interiorly remodeled Craftsman home at the lower end of Queen Anne Hill had a full 2 BR with baths, a gorgeous kitchen, and a deck that will be quite a draw in nice weather. Wireless, appliances, etc. were flawless. She grew up in Seattle, knows it well, and made suggestions. Although just starting out with Airbnb, she came across as a seasoned pro. Would definitely stay here again."
8755479,55143772,2015-11-28,48793368,Danny,"Brittain was a wonderful host!  Her house felt warm and comforting and she made sure we enjoyed our stay.  I was already familiar with Seattle, so she left us to our own devices and was kind enough to include a bottle of wine for our evening at the house for what I would say was a very, very minor inconvenience.  She definitely wanted to make sure our stay was at good as it possible could be.  I would definitely recommend staying here!  "
7664565,41301088,2015-08-05,40411096,Andy,"Nice apartment in a quiet area of town about a 30 minute walk to downtown. Brand new mattress and private bathroom. Host was accommodating, friendly and kind. Offered me juice and coffee. Great experience."
7664565,41553401,2015-08-07,106346,Amanda,Kumail was a great host. He was very flexible with our arrival/departure time--even met with us at his work to get us keys to the apartment. The apartment is very nice; the room is as pictured. The bed was very comfortable with nice sheets and a nice attached bathroom. We slept like babies and were very grateful for such a convenient and affordable place to stay. Would definitely book again!
7664565,41558191,2015-08-07,13885879,Jonathan,"I traveled to Seattle for a job interview and stayed with Kumail for one night. This was one of the best places I have stayed at on AIRBNB. From the outset Kumail was very helpful, allowing me to check in early and also storing my luggage in his office.

His apartment is new and it is quiet as well as clean. You get a room with a comfortable mattress and bathroom to yourself. Though he is in the process of acquiring furniture, I liked the simplicity of the place, and I didn't feel like the place was lacking. 

The apartment is only a couple miles from downtown Seattle and therefore easily accessible.

Kumail was an excellent host, he provided everything I needed. He is also very easygoing and amiable. Being relatively new to Seattle, Kumail was open to exploring the city. We had many interesting conversations and we even went to eat. I will definitely stay here again when I go back to Seattle. I would recommend Kumail's place to anyone who is looking for a comfortable place to stay in the city. "
7664565,41884552,2015-08-09,8198130,Ben,"The host was very welcoming, and extremely accommodating despite us changing arrival times throughout the day. A pleasant, safe and modern neighbourhood, allowing easy access to downtown Seattle. 

The room was comfortable and Kumail was very friendly while allowing us any privacy we needed. 

Excellent choice, would stay again."
7664565,42102291,2015-08-10,38923553,Gal,Great place 15 minutes from downtown. Kumail is a perfect host fun to talk to and has a nice clean apartment 
7664565,42343672,2015-08-12,17849050,Kyla,"The listing was spot on, the location was great with easy navigation by bus to downtown. There was lots of street parking available and the area was quiet in the evening. The rooftop gave great views of the cityscape at night/sunset. Kumail was a great host! Very accommodating and easy to talk to. "
7664565,42502742,2015-08-13,20138130,Vicky,Kumail was kind enough to accommodate me last minute. He's a very welcoming host. The apartment is very clean and comfortable as described. You won't be disappointed!

7664565,42984973,2015-08-16,26136087,Salma,I had a really nice stay at Kumail's apartment. The place was very clean. Although Kumail could not be there he took care of all our arrangements before hand and provided very clear instructions on how to enter the building and where to find everything. 
7664565,43838574,2015-08-22,36052802,Michael,My stay with Kumail in a private room in his apartment was great. He was *very* communicative and also very flexible about making arrangements for my arrival. The room and bathroom were very clean. And Kumail is a really nice guy. Highly recommended!
7664565,48628174,2015-09-27,44608266,Priti,"I was in Seattle for a long weekend to join my partner on his business trip. We stayed at Kumail's apartment for a night and everything  could not have been more perfect and convenient. The location is a little more than a mile from downtown. You can easily walk if you want to get to know the international district and explore the city. We used the bus once to get there from the International District train, but used Uber and walked the rest of the time. 

Kumail was friendly and easy to work with from the second I submitted my interest in the apartment. He was communicative, sent a very thorough and helpful email the night before our stay, and was overall an incredibly warm and welcoming person. His place is immaculate, the bed is comfortable, and we were also allowed to use the kitchen as we needed. 

For the price and quality of our stay, I'd recommend this listing over and over again for anyone looking to enjoy Seattle. You're not in the middle of everything, but it's still really convenient and you don't have to spend an arm and a leg. 

Thank you so much for your hospitality and opening up your home to us. "
7664565,48962538,2015-09-29,1197057,Laura,"New apartment with comfortable bed and very nice private bath.  Kumail was extremely flexible and responsive. Easy street parking. On the edge of the international district so might feel sketchy if alone very late at night, but no complaints for normal activities."
7664565,49408694,2015-10-03,41636721,Lisa,"Kumail was at work when I arrived at his apartment, but I was given very detailed and helpful instructions on how to get in. The room itself is spacious, tidy and clean, as is the bathroom - when I first walked in I felt a little bit like I was in a hotel! The bed was really comfortable and extra blankets were provided. Kumail was extremely communicative throughout the day, and when we finally met, we had a lovely conversation about life and family. The neighbourhood is quiet (but not in a bad way), the bus stop to downtown Seattle is a short walk from the doorstep, and once you're on one, it only takes about 20-25 minutes to get to the major tourist attractions. For Kumail's friendliness, the price, the location and the comfort, I would definitely recommend staying here if you get the chance!"
7664565,49692626,2015-10-05,44706622,Hyejin,It was my first experience with BnB and was great thanks to the great host. He did his best to make us feel comfortable and safe. The apartment was exactly the same as he posted and accomodated with all necessary items needed. We had a great time staying in his apartment. 
7664565,49866973,2015-10-06,5815739,Ehjae,Kumail was very pleasant and accommodating. It was very easy for us to get in to drop off our stuff and explore Seattle even though he was at work.
7664565,50420966,2015-10-11,5469588,Claudia,Wonderful experience as a guest of Kumail's. The room and private bathroom is very spacious. Their apartment is a short drive or bus ride away from anywhere you'd want to go in the city. Kumail & his wife are very kind & easy to correspond with. I'll definitely look to see whether the apt is available when I return
7664565,51384006,2015-10-19,16705508,Phuong,Kumail and his family were amazing hosts. They are really friendly and super helpful. The room is much nicer than what's shown in the picture online. Also. The apartment is super clean and organized.  I highly suggest that you check this place out. 
7664565,51515994,2015-10-20,46639930,Claire,"Kumail and his wife are so friendly and nice  :)
Even before I came to his apartment ,he concerned about how could I go there!And give me a useful information :)
The room is amazing and much better  than I thought. Also. The apartment is super clean and warmth. It's let me feel like a really house not just a living! If u r looking for a living in Seattle , just come to Kumail's apartment !! It would not be disappointed with you !"
7664565,52773703,2015-11-01,35254298,Candy,"Our stay at Kumail's place is very pleasant.  He and his wife are very nice to chat with and made us feel welcome. The room with ensuite bath was great! We were warm and cozy even though outside was stormy and cold. 
The location was super convenient as we just have to walk a little bit to yummy and inexpensive places to eat.  Getting to downtown was also very easy with various options for bus routes. "
7664565,55704835,2015-12-04,33694901,Cameron,"We had a great stay! The room was very clean and comfortable. Also, the location is an easy bus ride and short walk from Chinatown and Japantown, where we had an awesome meal. The couple had a cute daughter, and she was very sweet and never made a noise. "

7664565,56101770,2015-12-08,45094952,Jackson,"Kumaiil was an inviting and respectful host. The room for rent was clean, simple, and quiet. Exactly what I needed. It's definitely a good place to stay!"
7664565,56419539,2015-12-13,17350508,Joan,"Kumail was the most wonderful host I can imagine. It was our first time using AirBnb and it was the best experience you could hope for. He was helpful and great to talk to (about sports, life, anything), and the room was large, clean, and beautiful. The private bathroom was great. His apartment was within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants (it's near the International District with lots of Asian food) and a quick bus ride to downtown. A million stars!"
7664565,56552398,2015-12-14,49294261,Jacob,"Kumail was an excellent host.  Everything was clean and organized, and his home was very comfortable.  He made feel at home and provides excellent ideas for exploring seattle.  Everything I needed to enjoy my stay was provided.  I highly recommend Kumail for anyone staying in Seattle."
7664565,56860295,2015-12-19,10900837,Jun Le,"I had an awesome time hanging out at Kumail's place. Kumail was responsive and friendly, and the apartment had everything we needed. The neighborhood was very safe and within walking distance to the International District. Strongly recommended!"
6759046,35863436,2015-06-22,13963061,Wendy,Neighborhood is safe and easy to find. 
6759046,41153922,2015-08-04,39552676,Jessica,Great neighborhood. Quick drive to downtown. West Seattle is super cute. Very pleasant stay. Stephanie is great and the space is nice. 
6759046,42963866,2015-08-16,1631745,Wallace,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay in this West Seattle basement apartment.  Very clean and well appointed, there was little to no neighborhood noise present.  The low ceilings might not work well for folks over 6 foot tall but presented no problem for us.  We would definitely stay again!"
2413338,11431387,2014-04-02,527224,Wally & Ela,Staying with Margaret was pure bliss. She has a lovely home on Portage Bay with a view of University Bridge and UW. The room has a separate entrance and is spacious and bright. The location is ideal with many bus lines within walking distance. We truly felt welcomed and would recommend Margaret's home to anyone looking for a peaceful oasis in the middle of Seattle.
2413338,13836297,2014-06-05,2412083,Emily,"HOUSE

The pictures are not nearly as beautiful as Maggie's home actually is.  My heart would stop every time we looked out of the kitchen at the wall of windows with  the lake/canal right there, kayakers and sailors soaring on by.  

Boathouses are anchored, just like a regular house, but instead of cement foundation, have a web of logs and docks as the base.  Moral of the story is the house does not move with the water (the water just passes through the wooden foundation) and there is full utilities and internet.

It was nice having a private entrance and beautiful private bathroom (love clawfoot tubs) but felt very welcome in the common space too.  

HOST

Maggie is the best host we have ever had with Airbnb!!!  Usually we never meet our hosts and instead find a key somewhere.  Maggie greeted us, give us two sets of keys (one with a floatation device just in case you dropped it in the water - lol), went through basic info (wifi password, where the different recycle containers are, and reminder that in an Asian house you take off your shoes at the door).  

I'm from Seattle and knew to there is compost container, paper recycle, plastic/aluminum recycle, glass recycle, and then regular garbage - but forwarning to those who are not.  Also in general, its common practice to take off your shoes at the door in Seattle homes, so best to just get in the habit.

Maggie is a kind and vibrant person, often off to yoga or a small film or checking out a new restaurant, so very interesting to talk with though also often not home which helped us, who tend to be shyer, make ourselves more at home.  For example our last night we cooked pasta and drank wine on the dock, watching the sunset and life on the canal sail by.  Maggie managed a wonderful balance as host.

NEIGHBORHOOD

We chose this house not only b/c I have wanted to stay in a floating home since Sleepless in Seattle + kayaking past them for years ( ITS SUPER RARE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAY IN ONE - I've been looking for YEARS! ), but also b/c it has numerous buses going from UDistrict (other side of the canal) and Downtown (where you can catch a bus anywhere).  There is even a direct bus to Capitol Hill (ex-hipster bar scene).

There is no parking on the street where the floating homes are (its basically the side of a cliff) but there was plenty of parking the next street over.  Being that you have to take stairs down a hill and onto docks, would not recommend for someone who has mobility issues.

This comment is rather longer, but does not measure to how much we enjoyed our stay there and look forward to a future opportunity.  THANKS MAGGIE!"
2413338,17005944,2014-08-05,3333722,Pandu,"It was a great experience to stay in a boathouse in Seattle and Maggie is very nice, welcoming, and very helpful with some tips about getting around and some of the best points of interests in Seattle that many people know. I took her advise to visit those places and I enjoyed them immensely. Maggie is easy to communicate with and she gives clear direction on how to get to the place and it helped a lot as the taxi driver was a bit confused. The place is as described and one important feature is that the front of the boathouse is facing the sunrise and I am an early riser so I enjoyed the sunrise view from her boathouse. Priceless. "
2413338,18540717,2014-08-28,5842233,Monica,"My host welcomed me warm and friendly by inviting me to a dinnerparty.
I had a wonderful quiet room with a bathroom and was allowed to use the groundfloor. So I sat every evening by myself or sometimes with Maggie on the deck of this beautiful house and watched the traffic going on on the Eastlake. Besides of the wonderful movement the house gives you it is very quiet so I could relax and had a good night sleep on the good mattress.
The neighborhood was interesting, especially because there are at least 4 buses going downtown and you can reach the city in about 10 to 15 minutes. Uptown was the interesting University District with a lot of shops, movie theatres, a farmer's market every saturday and all different kinds of places to eat.
I highly appreciated my vacation in Seattle in the floating home, Maggie and I had nice conversations and I recommend Maggies home from the bottom of my heart."
2413338,18879343,2014-09-02,13240658,Sandra,It is a very special and unique experience to stay in this floating home.  Maggie is a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome.  The location is great with lots of places to eat within walking distance.   We loved sitting on the deck watching the boats and kayakers go by.  It was very entertaining seeing the bridge nearby open to let the bigger yachts through.  We hired bicycles from just over that bridge as Seattle is a good city to ride around.  We also hired a kayak so we could see all the other floating homes from the water.  If you get the chance you really should make use of this opportunity to stay in one of Seattle's floating homes.
2413338,19024486,2014-09-05,16582844,L J,Very enjoyable experience. Nice being right on the water.  Maggie has a wonderful home and is very gracious in sharing the kitchen & living area.  She was friendly and helpful and makes you feel very comfortable. 
2413338,19271950,2014-09-09,2105390,Bruce,"We enjoyed four days ""sitting on the dock of the bay,"" especially in the ""morning sun"" and again ""when evening come""  - a world away from the hustle and bustle of life.

The floating home experience was so Seattle, and everything about our visit exceeded our expectations!"
2413338,19429033,2014-09-12,20107050,Jennifer,"Maggie made Seattle more than a trip, it was an experience.   I found her home warm and inviting and the fact that it is a floating home was truly unique.   It was very peaceful and relaxing, and the location is great.  The neighborhood has a very friendly feel, with cafes and bistros a short walk away, and public transportation or on-street parking in the neighborhood.  Maggie was very welcoming and made me feel right at home.  If you are looking for a stay that is uniquely Seattle, I would definitely   recommend staying here."
2413338,19566091,2014-09-14,13080888,Sara,Maggie's houseboat was a fantastic experience! The views were great and the place was well looked after. Thanks Maggie!
2413338,19777734,2014-09-18,19390411,Charley,"This is a great place to stay! The owner is really pleasant and the house is charming. The location is really great for being near the UW campus and Eastlake bus line downtown. The view from the dock is a lot of fun--toward campus and a lot of boat traffic, rowing, and the drawbridge. Really good French bakery nearby for breakfast. Hope I can stay here again.   "
2413338,21280379,2014-10-14,15883097,Johannes,"Maggie's house is a wonderful place. It's hard not to forget for a moment that the house is in the middle of Seattle if you're sitting in the living room, watching the rowers and birds on the water. Maggie is a wonderful host. I can only recommend Maggie's place to everyone."
2413338,22825532,2014-11-16,19835367,Helmut,"The title says it all. It is a great experience to live in Seattle on one of these floating houses. Margaret was a very nice and caring host. If I was short on anything, she was always glad to help me out."
2413338,24472132,2014-12-29,2553289,Rick,"Maggie is a great hostess who made us feel welcome in her home during the holidays.  Such a magnificent property, it was exactly the Seattle Houseboat Experience we were looking for!"
2413338,26176493,2015-02-06,13794017,Belinda,"Maggie's home was an absolute find for my stay in Seattle and I would love to return some day. My month on the water felt incredibly restorative, almost like a retreat, and Maggie is a gracious, thoughtful and welcoming host. 
The bedroom is comfortable and roomy and the bathroom  charming, as is the whole houseboat. There is nothing to match the views of the water at all hours of day and night, rain or shine, with its passing boats and waterfowl. 
I liked the fact that you can sometimes hear the hum of traffic from University Bridge, as this juxtaposition of tranquil water and busy urban highways is so typical of the city. It's only ten minutes' walk over the bridge into the University district from here, where you can find great museums and tap into a bus network  going all over Seattle; plus you can get a bus from right by Maggie's to Capitol Hill. 
There are some lovely cafes within walking distance and a nearby rowing club from which scullers take to the water at 6am. Meantime, the community of houseboats in Maggie's bay is a delight in itself - what a privilege to be able to experience being part of this. 

Thank you, Maggie, for an unforgettable time on your floating home! This time I really fell in love with Seattle.
"
2413338,29073913,2015-04-03,15942291,Meredee,"We were not actually looking for a floating home to stay in, but Maggie's place is very convenient (within walking distance) of some of U of W medical facilities so it came up as #1 in our search.  The idea of being closer to nature while in the big city was appealing.  The rowing teams glided by early each morning rain or mist or shine.   Maggie is a gracious host who shared her experiences on a floating home through the seasons and gave us tips for local eateries.  The neighborhood is quiet and respectful with a french bakery and other restaurants nearby.  Even though parking is a few blocks away, we had no trouble finding a spot and the neighborhood felt safe.  After living in the northwest 15 years, we finally felt like we truly got to experience a fine slice of Seattle."

2413338,31421689,2015-05-05,25305494,Annette,"Es war eine wunderbare Erfahrung in Maggies schickem und gemütlichen ""Floating Home"" zu wohnen. Das Haus schwimmt und schaukelt leicht auf den Wellen, wenn ein Boot vorüber fährt. Auf der Terasse am Wasser zu sitzen gibt einem das perfekte Urlaubsgefühl - mitten in der Stadt. Die Fotos werden von der Realität übertroffen und Maggie ist eine vollendete, immer freundliche  Gastgeberin."
2413338,46365425,2015-09-10,27536272,Holli,"I spent a week at this Airbnb this summer and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. There was such a sense of peace in this place, both in the home and the about the hostess. I have never stayed in a floating home before and I loved being right on the water. Literally. Watching the sunrise and sunset and the sailboats passing was beautiful. I slept so well with the peacefulness and gently movement from the water. It was truly the retreat of rest I was seeking. I went home completely refreshed. The home was very clean and just as described in the listing, I was very comfortable. I really enjoyed the neighborhoods and all they had to offer, so much was within walking distance or a quick Uberx ride. The hostess was delightful and respectful and I am so grateful for my time there. I am looking forward to visiting again!"
2471731,17803424,2014-08-17,19869194,Rick,"While on a biz trip to Seattle, I had the pleasure of staying with Amelia & Marisa. I didn't get to spend much time there, but that didn't stop Amelia & Marisa from going out of their way to accommodate me & make my stay comfortable. I really wish that I could have spent more time relaxing on their deck out back! "
2471731,18042028,2014-08-20,20086552,Brendan,"I had a very pleasant short stay with these folks.  The residents were friendly and social, but also gave me space to do work. "
2471731,18445095,2014-08-26,18732411,Oliver,"What shall I say, the girls are great. Amelia & marisa combined a professional claim with a very welcoming friendlyness. I also met jordan a very nice feller. To stay in the big house with 10 ohters - who you might rarely see but sometimes here - is a very special and interessting expierence.  You should meet the girls and the people in the house. Special hint: the also have a beautyful houseboot. :)"
2471731,19091686,2014-09-06,12431287,Mariah,"I had a great stay at Amelia's place in Ballard. I stayed there for a week and a half and it was perfect for that amount of time. The kitchen was huge and had everything I needed. The room itself and the shared bathroom were big and clean as well. For a house with that many people, it was surprisingly quiet. The location was very convenient, only a block and a half to the bus stop to go downtown where I was working. Central Ballard and Green Lake park were easily accessible too. The neighborhood was cute, with a pocket of a few restaurants only a block or so away. Overall I had a really good experience."
2471731,24825070,2015-01-03,20232999,Eric,"This is a wonderful home in a great area! My roommates were very friendly and I couldn't be happier with the whole experience. My room had a great TV with Netflix and Amazon built in, which was a huge plus!"
2471731,46526490,2015-09-11,28467421,Janet,"Amelia met me on the porch with her adorable little Pomeranian, Foxy. She had everything labeled and organized in her b n b, and shared lots of valuable information about the area.  I knew exactly where things belonged and the best most respectful way to cohabitate and respect other renters privacy and space. Very clean and very comfortable. Her bike borrowing system was invaluable for commuting to town for yoga, food and parks. Pikes place was just a 40 minute pleasant bike ride away. Ballard is a nice, safe neighborhood. Loved it!"
769213,8196519,2013-10-20,1343498,Logan,"This is a fantastic space! Easy walk to all the shopping, dining, arts, and nightlife of Capitol Hill. The space itself was well-appointed and clean. The pull out couch was comfy, there were fresh eggs from the backyard chickens in the fridge, and the soaking tub is AMAZING! I wish I had added a day to my trip just to spend more time in the soaking tub. KT and Kirby are easy to reach and helpful hosts. I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in Seattle. "
769213,8320772,2013-10-25,2927234,Jenn,"This place is a true gem.  It's beautiful (even more so than the photos - they don't do it justice), clean, quiet, in a fabulous location (a garden oasis in lovely neighborhood in a really hip part of the city), AND there's parking!.  

When I arrived, there were fresh eggs from the chickens in the fridge, along with fresh cream, coffee, bagels, and basic cooking supplies.  The apartment is small, but has all the essentials you need - full kitchen, very comfortable bed (the description did not lie!), and an amazing bathing room with soaking tub & full shower.  

KT was a perfect host.  I didn't have the chance to meet her face to face (there is plenty of privacy here), but everything was as she said it would be and she checked in to make sure everything was ok via phone.  She returned emails and texts right away.  I also appreciated that she uses all natural cleaning supplies, which is great if you have allergies/chemical sensitivities and share a love of the environment.  

My only reservation in recommending it so highly is that it may not be available whenever I want to stay there! "
769213,8475473,2013-11-01,9210888,Candice,Very private and cozy. Fresh eggs and bagels were a nice touch and the soaking tub was the perfect place to relax. 
769213,8533927,2013-11-04,6157173,Natalia,"This is a lovely little place, bursting with character and charm. I suppose the word ""rustic"" does apply - everything is small, and oldish but things are well kept up and/or nicely refurbished, and the place is thoughtfully arranged to make the best use of the space. The kitchen is little but stocked with all the basics & easy to find things in, the bathroom looks a little unusual but is great to use - great showerhead, & we were so sad we didn't have time to try the amazing-looking soaker tub. The bed is a fold-out, but one of the more comfortable fold-outs I've ever encountered. It's not super soft, but there are no uncomfortable bars or dips or anything. If you have back problems though, or can only sleep on very soft beds, then this may not be the place for you.

The hosts seemed lovely (didn't get to meet them in person but communicated with them a bunch), and left us fresh eggs and cream and bagels in the fridge, which was just what we needed when we had to rush off early the next morning to catch our ferry home. They were also very accommodating of our uncertainty about exactly when we'd be arriving.

We had no problems whatsoever with getting in, or with the wireless, or hot water, or any of those things, and I cannot say enough just how utterly charming everything was and how at home we felt. Maybe it's because our old apartment had a similar feel to it, but we just loved this place and hope we'll have a reason to come back sometime. The cost was also a very good deal - we felt the accommodation we got for the price was excellent. Much much cheaper than staying in a hotel, and we felt much more at home, plus had the amenities of a full kitchen.

And, of course, it's in a great area, right in Capitol Hill, so it's easy walking distance to lots of good pubs and bars and coffeeshops and restaurants and so on. Also only a $10ish cab ride to places like Pike Place Market, Seattle Center and the Clipper ferry terminal. Super convenient."
769213,8663441,2013-11-11,9431181,Joseph,Really nice apartment with everything we needed. Great communication and easy check in and check out. Would definitely stay there again. 
769213,8704497,2013-11-12,9248388,Gina,"This apartment was perfect for our short stay in Seattle! We really enjoyed this space. It was comfy, quiet, and well designed.  Lots of attention to detail with a thoughtful guide to the apartment printed and waiting for us, fresh eggs, and travel toiletries to use. KT was easy to reach and helpful with ideas of where to get breakfast close by!

We hope to visit again!"
769213,8732400,2013-11-14,6197624,Roudabeh,"Staying here was wonderful! Past reviews are correct in saying that the photos really don't do this place justice - the place was even better than we'd expected: clean and decorated impeccably!  The soaking tub was beyond awesome - all I want is one in my own house now!  And they were right: the pull out bed was surprisingly actually super comfortable (& this is coming from someone who hates sleeping on pull out couches where bars press against your back all night!).  The place is also very conveniently located - we were able to leave our car at the apt (free parking!) and walked down to the trendy Capitol Heights area for dinner & drinks. 

Kt was also immensely kind and accommodating.  She worked around our schedule for both check-in and check-out (extending our check-out time as we needed), and was very hospitable (a yummy chocolate bar left w our check-in note, farm-fresh eggs from the chickens outside left for us for breakfast along w bagels and coffee, etc.)  

I would definitely recommend this place to others, and hope to stay here myself again in the future!!"
769213,8846798,2013-11-21,3749100,Kelli,"KT and Kirby were stellar hosts! The tiny little apartment is cozy and everything has been nicely renovated with a mix of modern and antique finishes. We had fresh eggs from their chickens every morning, which was a lovely touch. The bathroom with the Japanese soaking tub is awesome and feels like a spa. Also, the place is ideally located near some great bars and restaurants--even in the cold November rain, we had no problem walking to everywhere we wanted to go. 

The only potential negative is also a positive because of how well they handled the situation. After the first night, my boyfriend and I decided that the pullout couch bed was just too hard to sleep on. After texting KT about it, she immediately apologized and offered to pick up a foam topper from Bed, Bath, and Beyond, and if that didn't work, she was going to help us find another place that better suited our needs. The foam topper ended up working great, but mostly I was so impressed and grateful by the way she handled the situation--she was incredibly concerned that we have a great stay in Seattle. 

If you're looking for an affordable way to stay in Capitol Hill, I would wholeheartedly recommend KT and Kirby's place!"
769213,8902096,2013-11-25,2034832,Lisa,"Kt's place is lovely!  Super cozy, clean, and comfortable.  The apartment was charming and thoughtfully put together, and the soaking tub is not to be missed.  The location was super convenient too.  Great value.. I would definitely recommend!"
769213,8959129,2013-11-28,2516168,Sara,"In the land of shock and awe there are corners of absolute charm, and you'll find one of these at KT & Kirby's.

The compact mini apartment in the basement of the early 1900s Seattle townhouse is decorated with great taste: a well laid out living area with very comfortable sofa bed; a kitchen containing all the essentials (and some luxuries, like eggs from the hens and home-made pumpkin jam); and best of all, a deliciously chunky soaking tub in the bathroom.

We slept brilliantly, ate a leisurely breakfast in the lovely back garden with its overtones of East Asian elegance and clucking chickens, and set off on foot to explore downtown Seattle which was a half hour walk away.

Thank you KT and Kirby (and chickens) for your hospitality and good taste."
769213,9032323,2013-12-02,7649821,Layne,"My stay was short but I wish it had been longer. The tub- amazing! The bed was pretty comfortable and very easy to set up. Every light has a dimmer on it so that you can have that nice low-key candlelit feel without the safety hazard. And I assure you there are enough outlets to recharge everything you brought with you, in fact I don't think you can stand anywhere in the place and not be within 3-4 feet of an outlet, with the exception of the tub. Our hosts were very hospitable and contact was easy. I definitely hope to stay here again. "
769213,9064071,2013-12-03,3958600,Jacquelyn,Loved our stay! Beautiful spot and location. Very much appreciated!
769213,9084655,2013-12-05,7444887,Kelliann,"We loved this little cozy nook! I wish we could have stayed longer! Kt's hospitality is genuine and sweet, this place was all about the details, from the fresh eggs laid by the ""Marks"" (pet chickens), to the unique japanese soak tub; there was truly perfect architectural economy for a little space mixed with some local Seattle hospitality. Do not be fooled by the pull out bed, it was amazingly comfortable. The location is also a plus, there were many restaurants in the neighborhood, and a local distillery owned by none other than are wonderful hosts. Who if I may say so create an amazing gin! This place is simply a gem and epitomizes an airbnb experience perfectly."
769213,9226792,2013-12-15,9042339,Jill,"We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. The space was spectacular, quaint and thoughtfully designed. The soaking tub was fantastic. The location is conveniently located in a great neighborhood and within walking distance of lots of the city's amenities. Kt was professional, friendly and accommodating. "
769213,9247909,2013-12-16,214189,Elisabeth,"My husband and I had a very comfortable one night stay at KT' s Garden Apartment.  It was well-located, easy to find, warm and cozy.  A short soak in the tub put us right in dreamland.  The fold out bed was comfortable and the bedding was wonderful. Nice breakfast with fruit, eggs, coffee, even 1/2 and 1/2!  This was a memorable, inexpensive way to have a city break."
769213,9296919,2013-12-19,3884987,Dan,"My husband and I live on one of Puget Sound's islands and needed a place to stay after an event in the city. Kt's place was a 5 star solution on all counts. She accommodated our late arrival and super early departure without issue. The apartment has been constructed with a beautiful combination new and old materials which complement the main house.  If you are skeptical about the sofa bed comfort you can put your mind at ease... we are both over 6 feet tall and we slept like babes. The soaking tub in the bathroom is gorgeous and a luxurious soak should not be missed. Nice touches like chocolate treats on arrival and morning bagels, eggs and coffee were much appreciated.  The neighborhood is one of the most happening in Seattle.  This was our hood about a decade ago and the development has been astounding, all for the better. The house is on a quiet, leafy street yet steps away from a trendy, urban scene with the best new pubs and restaurants in town. We will def keep this gem in mind for future adventures in the big city. Thanks so much Kt!!"
769213,9325627,2013-12-21,6303695,Jinae,Sweetest little nook with so many lovely little details. I had a cozy and wonderful stay at KT's garden apartment. KT was very helpful and kind! Thanks! 
769213,9347381,2013-12-23,9952009,Annie,"My boyfriend and I spent two nights here and couldn't have been happier with our very first airbnb rental.  We had previously stayed in a hotel in Belltown, and we preferred the location and atmosphere of this apartment.  The apartment was very cozy and had everything we needed. The pullout bed was very comfortable, and definitely more comfortable than the beds at the economy hotel we stayed at before.  The kitchen had everything we needed for a quick breakfast and the fresh chicken eggs were a special treat.  The soaking tub was divine.  But best of all was the location; there were tons of great bars, restaurants, and shops just a few short blocks away.  We also loved being able to walk everywhere and a pleasant walk to pike place market took about 20 minutes.  Kt made everything smooth and easy and I highly recommend this apartment. "
769213,9715419,2014-01-06,10325861,Kim,"We had a short but really nice stay. The apartment is very cozy and especially the kitchen and bathroom is made with a lot of love. The communication with KT went very well in advance and also during our stay. She gave really good recommendations for restaurants and bars nearby. The apartment is within walking distance to downtown and the area itself, next to the university campus, was very nice as well. We would definitely recommend a stay at KT.
"
769213,9801080,2014-01-11,1515376,Paul,"Kt's apartment gave us exactly the level of comfort and privacy we were looking for. While I didn't have a chance to meet Kt, she was very responsive by email/text, and everything was exactly as described.
Everything was very thoughtfully and elegantly laid out for an intimate stay. You are only blocks away from anything you could want. Top notch dining, dancing and shopping is all a short walk away. 
Don't be deterred by the fold-out bed. It was extremely solid and comfortable. 
The tub and shower arrangement are beautiful and made our stay extra luxurious and romantic. 
The kitchen was well appointed and the fresh eggs from the chickens was a special treat.
I would highly recommend staying at Kt's apartment!"
769213,9852006,2014-01-14,10477266,Brett,"An amazing little space in an amazing little neighbourhood. 
The soaking tub was not only a highlight of the space, but a highlight of our visit to Seattle.
The tastes and sounds of Capitol Hill are only a stones throw away from this garden paradise.
The detailed instructions given to us by Kt were great and helped us navigate our way to the apt.

Overall a great experience, and certainly intend on rebooking for our next Seattle trip."
769213,9881799,2014-01-16,454542,Ashley,"KT has a great setup. Putting the efficient in efficiency - this small but adorably quaint and swanky setup has it all. Equipped with simple breakfast options, coffee and a soaking tub- it's ideal all around. Many thanks and will be back!"
769213,9904666,2014-01-18,10911957,Ann,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay!  The place was SO cute and very well decorated.  Full of small touches like chocolate and bubble bath.  We loved having a fridge and parking space.  The bath, of course, was amazing!  I want one in my house now :) 

Unfortunately we didn't get to meet KT but we did get to meet her husband briefly.  He was very nice; wish we could have spent more time with them, but we were only there for a short time.  KT was great about letting us know how to get to the house and check in and responding to texts once we were there.  It was a very professional experience.

My only (small) complaint was that the bed was not as awesome as I was expecting.  It was, without a doubt, the most comfortable pull out I've ever slept on.  However, based on the other reviews I was expecting it to be like a really comfortable real bed and it wasn't quite that good.

Overall we had a wonderful stay!  We would definitely stay again, and would recommend other people stay as well."
769213,9930639,2014-01-20,381272,Dennise,"We spent a weekend at this cute garden apt and couldn't be happier. 

The place is centrally located, close to bars and restaurants in Capitol Hills and just a 2-3 mile ish walk to downtown. Inside the apt, it has a well-equipped kitchen for quick breakfast and coffee. KT was very helpful and courteous - we didnt get a chance to meet her but our experience was excellent."
769213,10062210,2014-01-28,10482313,Tina,"We really enjoyed our 4-night stay here. It was quiet, cozy, reasonably priced. Not a place for hanging out since it is small, but there is everything you need otherwise. The location is very good for places to eat, buy food, public trans, etc. We would definitely stay here again."
769213,10101483,2014-01-31,10593230,Alyssa,"My partner and I had a fantastic albeit short trip staying in Kt's suite! The home itself was quite easy to locate as was finding our parking spot. Kt also provided perfectly thorough directions, how-tos, and tips. The soaker tub was perfect, the bed was very comfortable, everything clean, and fresh eggs in the fridge lovingly provided by the Chickens-All-Named-Mark! You can tell a lot of care was/is put into the decor and maintenance of the apartment. Thanks Kt! We'd definitely stay here again, and hopefully get a chance to meet you (and your pup!)"
769213,10153197,2014-02-03,11072601,Ryan,"Perfect relaxing spot right near the heart of Capitol Hill.  The unit is finished to be trendy , and the soaker tub was amazing.  Kt was a great host, and gave us complete privacy.  The pull-out bed made us a little hesitant to choose this listing, but like all the other reviewers, I will say it shouldn't really worry you - it was comfortable and slept like a normal bed. "
769213,10308396,2014-02-12,10040272,Tara,Brilliant apartment and very well equipped. The soaking tub was incredible!
769213,10381402,2014-02-17,10781952,Lauren,"KT and Kirby were wonderful hosts--the apartment was clean, comfortable and full of personal touches. The soaking tub was fantastic, and the bed was just as comfortable as it would've been in a hotel. It was also conveniently located, we walked everywhere on our weekend here. A wonderful spot to stay! "
769213,10457347,2014-02-19,4277624,Mimi,"Great location in Capitol Hill- blocks from a juicing place if you like to start your day with fresh juice and a block from the bus station for easy transportation. The space was the coolest too. Kt even had some yummy breakfast essentials and the comfiest robes just like a hotel. Great cozy stay, we'd do it again!"
769213,10479663,2014-02-21,11127364,Jaclyn,"It was a short but sweet (1 night) stay at Kt's garden suite apt. Perfect location, a very private, beautifully designed apt. and so quiet!  

Check in and Check out was a breeze and even though we didn't actually meet our hosts, they were gracious enough to leave fresh eggs and cream for the morning. 

I will definitely book here again but next time for a few days!  "
769213,10509743,2014-02-23,10323478,Kerry,"Great little place, conveniently located near lots of great cocktail bars in Capitol Hill.  Check in was seamless.  Just wish we had time to enjoy the fresh eggs in the fridge, courtesy of the ladies in the henhouse.  Fruit in the bowl was a nice touch."
769213,10539030,2014-02-24,5051171,Jeff,"Two of us enjoyed a weekend in this sweet garden apartment. It is private, well designed, quiet and cozy. Kt's communication was excellent. Check-in and -out could not have been easier. 

It's great staying within easy walking distance of the cafes of Capitol Hill, and the kitchen is well-equipped if you prefer to make breakfast in. Eggs from the backyard chicken coop were a bonus!

The soaking tub is the highlight of the apartment -- very indulgent, and perfect after a long day and late night in the city. The sofa bed is surprisingly comfortable. I like a firm mattress and we both slept well. 

We didn't meet Kt or Kirby, although Kirby offered to show us Oola Distillery even though it was Sunday and closed. We didn't have time to take him up on the offer, so we will look forward to a repeat visit. "
769213,10674306,2014-03-03,3191827,Samantha,"KT & Kirby's place was basically heaven.

there are so many details about the place that made for a wonderful stay: the hardwood floors and the little green rug, the artwork, the windows, the lighting (that may sound trivial, but seriously, the lighting is awesome; everything on dimmer switches, and plenty of options), the kitchen, the bathroom (the soaking tub is as amazing as it looks in the photos). the sofa/bed was super comfortable for sleeping, and easy to move from bed to sofa. 

i also loved the chickens in the yard (and the fresh eggs that KT and Kirby left for us).

overall, the apartment is intimate and cozy, and still feels spacious because of the thoughtful design (and there were two of us). i didn't get to meet KT or Kirby in person, but KT was responsive and friendly over email and text, and left us everything we needed.

wifi worked perfectly. 

in terms of location, it was pretty ideal; Capitol Hill is a fantastic neighborhood."
769213,10825140,2014-03-09,12455523,Manda,"My stay was fantastic! This was my first airbnb booking and I was super impressed!

First, the location was prime, you can easily reach anywhere in town by connecting buses, the stop is pretty close. The neighborhood itself has a great day and night time activities. Furthermore, the apartment I stayed in was clean and everything was well thought out. The bed was comfy, there was plenty of fresh towels, and they even had eggs, coffee, and English muffins! Also, the tub. It was the perfect way to end long days out exploring the city,. The detailed house rules covered anything I had questions about.

Highly recommend KT as a host, I'd definitely choose her to book with again!"
769213,10858722,2014-03-10,1150800,Karoline,"Kt apartment was very clean and comfortable! We really enjoyed our stay...
The fact that it was a very rainy day made us enjoy the Spa/Bathroom even more :-)
This apartment has a lot of charm and is really well located!
I would come back for our next visit, in the Summer :P
"
769213,10936570,2014-03-14,8066523,Ben,"Our stay at KT's place was amazing! The apartment was cozy, but outfitted with everything we might need including fresh eggs from the chicken coop. We went to Oola's to try some of Kirby's liquor sand our only regret is that we didn't get a chance to try out the soaking tub! Thanks for
Everything! Also, Capitol Hill is an awesome neighborhood, and many things we're close."
769213,11107078,2014-03-21,11095395,Lindsay,Great stay! Such a cute and cozy place nestled in a wonderful Seattle neighborhood. This place felt like home away from home. 
769213,11212522,2014-03-25,1977326,Amy,Charming lower level unit with modern kitchen and amazing bath! Fresh eggs were a treat.
769213,11259908,2014-03-27,11349267,Benjamin,We stayed here for 2 nights and couldn't have been happier. It was a short 10 minute drive to the city center and the accommodations were great. The soaking tub was fantastic after a day out in the cold rain. If we are back in Seattle we will absolutely stay with KT again.
769213,11426524,2014-04-02,5976304,Kathleen,The location of this backyard cottage could not be better! This was a wonderful place to call home during my stay in Seattle.
769213,11658476,2014-04-11,11623891,Kris,"Kt's house is situated in a nice, quiet neighbourhood, with plenty of good restaurants,  bars and coffee shops literally just around the corner. And downtown Seattle is actually within walking distance (something that's said often, but is not always the case. This comes from 2 people who aren't big on hiking).

To top it all of, Kt and Kirby have been most excellent hosts.They really know their neighborhood and gave great advice on dining. They were easy to get in touch with, and gave you plenty of privacy. And they had Mark (their chickens) give us all the eggs we could eat.

Added bonus points for providing a map. Kt and Kirby seem to understand that a new city can overwhelming and getting around isn't always obvious.

There's just one thing my girlfriend and I didn't like: the bed. It was too hard for our taste (others seemed to like it), but that's it really. It's just a tiny remark for an otherwise excellent airbnb. It's small, but fully equiped. And yes, the soaking tub makes for an added bonus you'll hardly find anywhere else. "
769213,11707066,2014-04-13,10953652,Nicole,"This apartment is beautiful. We only stayed one night, but it was very comfortable. I'm glad we took the time to use the soaking tub! What a treat. We appreciated the fresh eggs, English muffins, and butter left for us. We didn't meet KT but we did briefly meet Kirby, who was very friendly. The neighborhood was safe, quiet, and the off-street parking was a great bonus. "
769213,11825537,2014-04-16,10951016,Indi,"KT and Kirby were fantastic hosts. I don't have much to add that is different than the other great reviews, but we absolutely loved the fresh eggs and local chocolate left for us, and the bed was very comfortable! We actually got engaged while we were in Seattle, so the city and this apartment will always be special to us. Thanks for the hospitality!"
769213,11947785,2014-04-20,4015887,Lucy,"Hy
We had a wonderful stay in the Airbnb from KT and would defenatly stay there again! It was clean, the bed was really comfertable and the bathtub is really cool! Kt was very helpfull and it was easy to check in and out!
The Busstop is really Close to the House and you can also walk into towntown, it takes aroung 25 minutes! 

Thank you Kt for having us!
All the best lucy

769213,12145110,2014-04-24,4468704,Nicole,"My boyfriend and I have never stayed in an Airbnb rental and didn't know what to expect in general with staying in a rental vs. hotel. After staying at KT's garden house we were sold, Airbnb all the way. Good bye, hotels! From the moment I contacted KT about renting out their garden house she had been really open with communication. As a renter it made the whole process more reassuring and easy. 

Once we got to KT's place my boyfriend and I were beyond pleased. The garden apartment is behind their house and located in a convenient area to walk to many different restaurants and bars. The place was very clean, well designed, and built. We loved it and would 100% recommend their place to any one of my friends, colleagues, and even strangers to rent their place if they are heading to Seattle! The price for one night is so reasonable for what they offer from the comfortable bed and amenities. If you see their post don't hesitate, email KT. :) "
769213,12363631,2014-04-30,4548612,Louise,"We couldn't have asked for more.  The apartment is lovely as is the garden in which it's situated.  The chickens lay yummy eggs and all the other amenities are great as well.  Kt has thought of everything.  We used the little kitchen and the soaking tub.  What fun!  As others have mentioned, this is the most comfy sofa bed you'll ever use.  All-in-all, the experience was wonderful as was Seattle and the wedding we attended there.  "
769213,12423498,2014-05-02,11606364,Ellen,"This is a lovely space in a great location - easy to walk to downtown Seattle, there's a great food co-op really nearby - quiet, pretty street. KT's help and guidance were clear, easy-to-follow. She is really gracious too. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Thank you KT, Kirby and very good wishes to the chickens and Oola."
769213,12610716,2014-05-06,6818339,Katy,"We had a great stay in this cute apartment. I would gladly stay here again when I am in the area.  Perfect location for everything, we didnt have a car and did not feel like we needed one at all.  No complaints!"
769213,12691620,2014-05-08,12614331,Miriam,"We had a nice time for our last days in Seattle. Great location and very clean, quiet but at the same time directly at Capitol Hill. Very recommendable!"
769213,12709605,2014-05-09,9281955,Nick & Jen,Loved the toiletries left out for us - especially the fab-smelling body lotion! It all just added to the hotel-style experience. Thanks again for hosting us!
769213,12809234,2014-05-12,9281955,Nick & Jen,"LOVED Seattle, and KT's garden apartment was the ideal base for our stay. The sofa bed was so comfy and the foodie treats, like eggs from the chickens and local chocolate, were a lovely surprise. The apartment is perfectly designed for a couple and the soaking tub in particular was fantastic. It was great to be able to walk to Downtown in 20mins or so but we were really seduced by the Capitol Hill district - there's an incredible amount of cool restaurants and bars just minutes away from the (website hidden) lovers should definitely check out Chuck's Hop Shop - it's a real hidden gem away from the main drag. If we return to Seattle, we wouldn't hesitate to stay at KT's place again. Thanks for your hospitality!"

769213,12969200,2014-05-16,11770966,Anthony,This is a quaint little basement apartment.  It is comfortable and perfect for a couple night stay in Seattle.  The location cant be beat as you not only have access to the Cap Hill area but also easy access to downtown.  The place is clean and private.  We really enjoyed the fresh eggs from KT's chickens in the backyard.  Overall a great host and responsive.  would recommend this apartment to anyone and would stay again in the future.
769213,13004076,2014-05-17,13644865,Louise,Great location and great accommodations.  The tub was cab.  Will stay again upon return to Seattle.
769213,13422764,2014-05-27,601135,Brit,Great place! Great location!
769213,13509823,2014-05-29,3530587,Bob,"It was a very enjoyable stay at Kt's home, out of the way and secluded. The hot tub was really nice after a day on the town.  Thanks you Kt."
769213,13534314,2014-05-30,13220961,Katie,"My husband and I greatly enjoyed our stay here. The bed was comfortable, and the location was fantastic. We especially loved the fresh eggs from the chickens! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks again, KT!"
769213,13645422,2014-06-02,10943610,Boaz,KT was very friendly; we met her on the first day and got good recommendations about the city and the neighborhood witch is close to the center (about 15 m walk) and just around the corner of the University. Don’t miss CANON a very popular place said to be on of Seattle's best bars and very very good food as well. Keep in mind that the place is sort of a basement (with windows) and you will sleep on a sofa bed. The bathroom is dark and there is no place to have breakfast except outside and if its cold or rainy…We had fresh eggs and basic breakfast products. 
769213,13809490,2014-06-05,9506540,Nadine,"We had a great time in KT's Appartement. The location was nice and cozy and the bathtub was awesome. Capitol Hill is really great and you can discover it all by foot. We enjoyed the personal parking slot, this is really rare in Seattle. 
Thank you for the fresh eggs, they were delicious. We loved Seattle so hopefully we will be back next time. "
769213,13905713,2014-06-08,10938834,Alex,Lovely separate apartment in a great location. Could not be faulted. 
769213,14262037,2014-06-16,5717405,Amy,"This place was so awesome and super cute! Very efficient use of space without compromising on comfort. The hosts even left us fresh eggs from the chicken they raise right outside the unit (don't worry, you don't hear them at all). Place was clean and in an EXCELLENT location. Everything in Capitol Hill was within walking distance - would have stayed longer if I could. Oh and there's nothing better than coming home and using that soaking tub after walking around all day. Highly recommend staying here!"
769213,14466256,2014-06-20,53575,De Lora,"The Private Garden Apt was adorable and convenient.  We were here to get married on a ferry in the San Juan Islands and we made this our first home base to pick up our marriage license and meet with our officiant before heading up into the islands.  

Of course, we also loved the soaking tub.  The craftsman style of the place gave it a special feel.  "
769213,14675894,2014-06-24,9728994,Bob,Fabulous area and delightful apt complete with gently murmuring chickens in garden. Easy to walk or catch local bus. Didn't meet Kt but Kirby helped care for our bags when we arrived too early to check in. Would stay again!
769213,14769452,2014-06-26,11414063,Ilse,"The place is very nice and cosy and has a wonderful garden. We loved to stay here. KT gave us fresh eggs from her chicken, what a surprise in this big city. Many thanks to her and her husband."
769213,14816208,2014-06-27,14012506,Nathalie,"Stayed only briefly in this little basement suite. Located in Capitol Hill, this small, quaint apartment has everything you need to be comfortable for a short stay. The soaking tub is an added plus. Unlike other reviewers, I found the bed uncomfortable. It should be noted that if you prefer a softer sleep, KT has a foam topper to improve the comfort, I wasn't aware of this until after the fact. We didn't cook there at all, but I did notice that the kitchen looked well equipped, however nowhere to sit and eat if that's what you are after. The parking was awesome. Nice to have a designated spot. Thanks KT!"
769213,15168423,2014-07-04,1100697,Oonagh,"My boyfriend and I visited Seattle in July and stayed at Kt's place for 2 nights and we absolutely loved it. The apartment was so comfortable, clean, quiet, and of course we loved the tub! We saw Kt and her husband briefly when we were checking in, and it was all a very smooth process! This was also the perfect location, we were so close to lots of amazing restaurants and places we wanted to go. It was also very easy to get downtown to the market and elsewhere. I highly recommend staying here!"
769213,15341939,2014-07-07,16550713,Papu,"This was our first AirBnB experience and it was fantastic. We were looking for a place to stay for a 4th of July softball tourney and Kt's was just the right place. She was an amazing host. 

From the start she was very open, inviting and clear on how everything works. The Private Garden Apt looks just like it does on the listing and there was more than we expected: fresh eggs from their chickens (these were delicious), a wonderful sleep kit was provided, and a soothing sound machine to dull the senses. The soaking tub was really nice to use after a long day of softball. 

It's close to Capital Hill so we were steps away from the lively Seattle night life in Capital Hill,walked to Pike's Market during the day and Lake Union Park to see the fireworks at night. We caught a cab from the market and it was less than $10 to get back.

This was an awesome place to stay!  "
769213,15482112,2014-07-10,9419830,Susannah,"This apartment is great for a stay in Seattle. We loved the comfy bed, complete kitchen and the AMAZING soaking hot tub. There is a great style to the whole place. The check in and check out was all amazingly easy and KT left us fresh eggs and muffins in the fridge too, although we did not actually meet her. We walked everywhere from here, there are nice restaurants and great coffee ion easy walking distance."
769213,15580882,2014-07-12,15601045,Erin,"Kt gets fantastic reviews... and for good reason! The place was everything we could have hoped for and more. It was comfortable, quiet and private. The location was fabulous and the eggs were almost as great at the ""Marks"" themselves, (inside joke, you'll get it when you stay there)! Would love to stay there again."
769213,15666591,2014-07-14,11870397,Béatrice,"After a long distance flight Kt's appartement was our first stop before going on a road trip through the West and Canada. The check-in was very easy. The appartement was located in a quiet neighborhood and perfect to recover after long walkings through the City. It was well equiped, i-phone charger, sleeping-kit, touristinformation and kitchen stuff, and the best: Kt filled up the fridge with some bread, butter, milk and eggs from Mark, Mark and finally Mark. That's they call their chicken. Perfect to start your first day! Thank you Kt. We enjoyed our stay and recommend staying here. "
769213,15860985,2014-07-17,10943861,Lauren,"My husband and I had our first AirBNB experience staying at Kt's for three nights this summer, and we couldn't have been happier with our time there. 

Kt and her husband provided the perfect balance of making themselves available should we have had questions and basically fading into the background and letting us do our own thing. We saw them in passing each day and they always said that if we needed anything we should just let them know.

One thing that struck me about the apartment was how very bright it seemed. They have windows facing into their backyard that let daylight in and almost all of the extensive lighting throughout the apartment was set with dimmer switches so at night I could crank them up if I needed to cook dinner and dim them when we wanted to watch a movie. 

Also, since we were up on Capitol Hill, we got to see more of the city than we usually do. We had never walked along Pike Street except down by the market, but there are tons of great shops, galleries and restaurants to see if you choose to walk downtown from the apartment. We had also never been to the arboretum or the Japanese Gardens in Seattle before, but were able to drive up on the day of our departure and check them out (about a 5-10 minute drive). 

For the price, you can't beat the amenities (the tub is amazing) or the location. We'd definitely recommend this place to our friends."
769213,15902645,2014-07-18,2309276,Kaitlyn,"Although we didn't get the chance to meet KT and her husband, any correspondence that I had with her was pleasant and we were very impressed with their place. The whole place was spotless, well equipped and exactly what we needed for our one night stay. The Capitol Hill area is absolutely fantastic...filled with so many good bars and restaurants and just a 15-20 minute walk to Downtown Seattle which was really handy! We would definitely stay here again!"
769213,16052590,2014-07-21,11483543,Brian,My partner and I had a perfect experience with our stay. This was a lovely spot in a great location—highly recommended!
769213,16334395,2014-07-26,10990474,Rico,"Everything was perfect. Clean, cosy and close to all what you need. It´s a lovely place and highly recommended.  .... and try the fantastic tub."
769213,16537860,2014-07-29,6410453,Pinchas,"My wife and I stayed at this wonderful private garden apartment  in the very heart of Capital Hill. The apartment is small and only relevant for a couple. The apartment was very clean and the fold-up couch bed  surprisingly comfortable. The garden and porch where a pleasure and I enjoyed reading in the lush quite garden. We appreciated the fresh eggs from their chickens and the cold water, muffins and butter waiting for us in the fridge. We did not use the soaking tub but it looks great and relaxing.
It was also a pleasure to meet KT and her husband Kirby. They were both very kind and wanted to make sure that we were settled and comfortable.
About the area: Capital Hill is the heart of funky Seattle. A very eclectic group of people live in the area adding a lot of color to the rolling hills  of the city. What we loved about the apartment is its close proximity to  this area and a mere 30 minute, down hill walk to Pike's Market Place (take the bus back and you can pay on the bus). Also, the apartment is only a 10 minute walk to a lovely park complete with a historic  water tower that you can climb for the view, a pond and a botanical garden ($4.00 per person fee). There are even some shady walking paths with splendid views of the city below.
Finally, Kirby is a proud owner-distiller of Oola distillery where he creates various prize winning vodkas and whiskeys. On Saturday a free tasting tour is offered and should not be missed(book before and it's only a one minute walk from the apartment). His products are top notch and made with such care and affinity for perfection.
We highly recommend this apartment and the surrounding area.  "
769213,16710059,2014-08-01,15266874,Arbbie,"This space was amazing - it had everything we needed and more; our hosts have a few chickens hanging around in the backyard and left us some of their eggs, plus english muffins, butter, and coffee for breakfast during our stay. The location is fantastic as well, just a short bus ride away (or walk, which we did most of the time) from downtown, tourist attractions, and the market. It's also very close the the Pike strip which has some awesome spots. We had breakfast at ""Skillet"" and dinner at ""Marjorie's"" which are both amazing and just around the corner from their space. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this space to our friends and family visiting Seattle."
769213,16761527,2014-08-02,2048635,McKenzie,Wonderful experience. KT was so attentive to detail and her place is beautiful and unique. All expectations exceeded! -Scott and Jill
769213,22652382,2014-11-11,3291419,Devin,"Kt and Scott were really great hosts that provided many things that helped my trip go as smoothly as possible. A clean space that lived up to my expectations gathered from the site, comfortable and clean bed,   restroom, and small kitchen that I was able to stash a bit a food for myself in. On cold nights, I found that the room was well heated and I didn't feel the need to turn on the small heater that was in the room. The space is on the smaller side so I definitely recommend it only for people travelling as a pair or on their own.
I think the biggest surprise for me is how fast it was for me to get to where I wanted to go. I really look forward to my future visits to Seattle and hopefully staying at this place again."
769213,22774519,2014-11-14,12725963,Sara,"This was a GREAT space. Warm, inviting, quiet. I lived in Seattle for six years and return often to visit, so being in the heart of Cap Hill was important. 

I met KT once in passing and once when she called to me from above and checked in. What a wonderful host, really. She was incredibly friendly. I really appreciated her ability to respond (I was confused about the parking) immediately but also to allow me the space and peace I so desperately needed. 

The apartment itself was dreamy, with tiqued wood and a spectacular bathroom anyone could get lost in. That Japanese soaking tub is indescribably fantastic. 

I will be returning to KT's place for every visit I can. The price is right, and the space is really ideal!

Ah, and don't miss out on The Eggs of Marks. "
769213,22890915,2014-11-17,13207091,Jin,"We had a wonderful time staying here. KT and her husband stocked the fridge with fresh eggs from their chickens and a few other items to create a delicious breakfast! The apartment was  clean, nice, and comfortable and the tub was awesome. We would definitely stay here next time we come to Seattle!"
769213,23156161,2014-11-24,2234059,Laureen,"The suite was perfect and the location was excellent. Walking distance to a ton of great restaurants, bars, shops. Very thoughtful layout of the space that makes the small space functional and smart looking. KT was attentive when we needed her but respectful of our privacy as well. 
We had an amazing time and felt lucky to have found such an excellent place to stay. "
769213,23428385,2014-12-01,14080451,Danielle,"My boyfriend and I made a trip up to Seattle to look at apartments for our move up there and go to a concert. We loved this little place. It was so nice having the fresh chicking eggs, and in the morning before leaving and coming back we greeted little Mark and Mark, the chickens. They were great hosts, we would love to come back!"
769213,23681018,2014-12-08,12306134,Kristin,"What a gem! The apartment is a lovely retreat in an amazing location. Was delightful to come ""home"" from exploring the city on foot and indulging in the soaking tub! And we so loved the shared eggs from ""mark and mark"" the hens:) We hope to stay again!"
769213,23813039,2014-12-11,22800896,Mackenzie,Beautiful place! Great easy walk downtown all around great experience! 
769213,23866344,2014-12-13,6779329,Jill,all was as it was depicted. It is a great location. Nice spot. Nice kitchen. Good bed. All in all we recommend highly. 
769213,23991869,2014-12-16,21914274,Mark,"This was a beautifully designed, cosy apartment which was situated in a quiet neighbourhood yet just minutes from the heart of Seattle. We were greeted with some thoughtful extras which made us feel very welcome and gave a touch of home. A big thank you must go to the chickens Mark and Mark for providing us with their eggs :) Overall this was a very enjoyable stay, thank you for being great hosts Kt and Kirby! "
769213,24102426,2014-12-20,21216394,Ben,"Our hosts KT Niehoff made us feel very welcome at their Private Garden Apartment.  The ambiance in the apartment was modern, clean, and very relaxing.  The Capitol Hill neighborhood was very walkable from this location with many options, which we will have to take advantage of on our next visit.  The fresh eggs from the resident chickens Mark & Mark were delicious!"
769213,25411432,2015-01-15,1795646,New,"Kt was very responsive and kind.
The description is very accurate, and in a great location. My husband and I especially enjoyed the soaking tub and the pristine cleanliness of the towels and linens.  Great design touches. 
Sadly we didn't try Mark&Mark's eggs. Perfect place to stay if you have a loved one in Swedish hospital. (Reason for our stay)
Wish we could have stayed longer!"
769213,25627978,2015-01-21,11844587,Jamie,"So glad I found this place! My boyfriend and I stayed for 6 nights and we both felt very comfortable and at home the entire time. Not only is the unit clean and well decorated but we were provided with biscuits, eggs, tea, fresh towels / linens, and toiletries in the shower. The thoughtful amenities were above and beyond what I was expecting, and KT & Kirby do a great job at making you feel welcome in their cozy unit. I'd absolutely recommend this place and will re-book it if I'm in the area again!"
769213,25789659,2015-01-26,8139506,Kellie,"Great hosts, excellent location and lovely space! KT left eggs from the chickens and chocolate on the table. What a great welcome! The Japanese soaking tub was exactly what I needed. Thank you! "
769213,26024705,2015-02-01,8939139,Leah,"we LOVED this spot! It was so darling. Very clean and simple and modern. The location was perfect for cruising around the city and the space was perfect for my boyfriend and I for a couple days. The bed was comfy and we loved the soaking tub. We will definitely be back! Thank you KT and Kirby!

"
769213,26293657,2015-02-09,2872711,Daniel,"Kt's place was great for us! Great location, walking distance to great capitol hill spots. The place is small, but with everything you need.

The soaking tub was wonderful, a really calming space. We also loved cooking up breakfast with the eggs, provided, from the chickens right outside!"
769213,26734192,2015-02-18,16790695,Nick,"This is my go-to spot in Seattle. The location is amazing, right in the heart of Capitol Hill, yet off the beaten path. A quiet suburban road right next to all the hustle and bustle of a wonderful neighborhood. The place is SO charming. Beautiful old windows, an amazing soaking tub and spa-like bathroom, recessed, dimmed lighting, a FULL kitchen, and a garden view complete with chickens and berries and flowers. The host took so much time to make the stay unique and special including gifts of food and suggestions for activities around Seattle. Thank you so much."
769213,26939358,2015-02-22,17525561,Alex,"Very welcoming and convenient location! Amazing fresh eggs provided for us in the morning, highly recommend, 5/5!"
769213,27126169,2015-02-26,975134,Samantha & Sophia,"We had a wonderful stay at KT and Kirby's guest home! We loved the Capitol Hill location, which was close to a number of bars and restaurants but quiet enough for a great night's sleep. We also enjoyed the fresh eggs from Mark and Mark, the cleanliness of the apartment, the soaking tub, and the comfortable bed. We would love to stay at KT and Kirby's during our next trip to Seattle! "
769213,27389899,2015-03-03,25688180,Rebeca,"This place is perfect for a weekend getaway! The hosts have thought of absolutely everything to make your stay easy and comfortable. We came for a two-night stay to see Seattle and their place was a highlight of an awesome visit. Here's why

The neighborhood: Capitol Hill is easy to get to and central to everything we wanted to do in the city. We walked from the airport shuttle up through the neighborhood. It has a chill, cool vibe with amazing bars and restaurants. It was easy to get cabs too! 

The house: truly exceeded my expectations in every way. The bed was super comfortable with hella plush bedding. The kitchen has everything we needed to eat in or cook. There was coffee, cream and fresh eggs from the chickens in the back. There was a noise machine and a sleeping kit which helped me a lot! And then there was the bathtub. That thing is my new definition of heaven on earth. A deep, dark Japanese soaking tub soothed my sore feet. The apartment is beautiful, clean, sleek and lovely. But the tub is why you should fight for this spot or change your plans so you can stay here. 

I cannot recommend this place more. The host, Kt, was super helpful and kind. You will be so happy you stayed here. "
769213,27650632,2015-03-09,20044699,Lexi,The apartment is really nice and clean. Perfect for a couple or one person. The backyard is beautiful and the chickens were cool. The place is walkable to the aquarium and the market. The bed was very comfortable
769213,27811882,2015-03-12,28090662,Ezra,It is a truly lovely apartment. We'd stay there again in a second if we find ourselves back in Seattle. 
769213,27898410,2015-03-14,26271138,Kele,"Loved the cozy room,  it was worth every penny! If we stay In Seattle I'd definitely try to get this place again!"
769213,28248971,2015-03-21,25647892,Trevor,"This was my first Airbnb and WOW. This stay was so incredibly awesome I could barely believe that I paid less than most hotels have cost me in the past.

First off, I would say that the best word to describe Kt's Airbnb is FUNCTIONALITY. Literally everything you could possibly need on your stay is here and placed so perfectly. I think I counted at least 30 outlets in the front room which was neat. There was a sleep kit, white noise machine (YES!), sugar for the coffee, free coffee. I took notice of how everything was situated in this unit to be exactly where it ought to be for easy use. It's a small space but designed so well that it doesn't feel crowded with plenty of room to put your things. The wall ledge that goes around the whole perimeter of the front room was just so great, literally gave the room so much more space to place our things without getting in the way.

The location was absolutely perfect. We loved how close we were to EVERYTHING. Buses were easy to use and walks to the bus stops were less than 5 minutes and the walk to pike place was maybe 20 minutes. It is quiet here too, peaceful sleep the whole night though. and the bed IS comfy. very comfy. And large enough I'm 6'2"" and was very comfortable.

Okay, the soaking tub? Forget about it, best thing about the unit by far. AMAZING. 

Also, I informed Kt of our dietary restrictions and was so happy to find vegan peanut butter cups left for us. YUM. 

We were blown away by this whole experience, we really didn't want to leave.

DO NOT pass up the opportunity to stay here, just book it, now. GO"
769213,28401962,2015-03-23,9042339,Jill,We really enjoyed our stay in this cozy space located in a really great neighborhood. 
769213,28515207,2015-03-25,26046351,Tim,"Although a medical emergency prevented my girlfriend and I from staying at Kt's Garden Apartment, I was pleased with the pre-stay experience she provided.

About a month before our scheduled stay, Kt sent a thoughtfully composed and impressively thorough message that provided all of the information concerning our visit that we would expect to need. She and her husband seem like notably gracious hosts.

We were disappointed that our change of plans prevented us from staying here. When we do visit Seattle, we would eagerly stay here. "
769213,28612850,2015-03-27,9124525,Claire,"Kt was a wonderful host. Everything was in order when we arrived, and there were even chocolates waiting for us! 
The soaking tub was amazing, especially after walking all over the city.  This airbnb gave us the luxury of a hotel coupled with the convince of home. 
The neighborhood was nice, and everything was in walking distance."
769213,29098074,2015-04-04,26228218,Stefani And Curtis,"This place is awesome!  My boyfriend and I stayed here for 3 days.  In that time, KT was a great host & provided all basic essentials.  She even checked in with me during the stay to see if we needed more towels, so that was nice.  The place was very clean and had a lovely smell resonating throughout the unit which made us feel right at home.  Unfortunately, the bed was a tad uncomfortable for my liking, but that wasn't a big deal.  Soaking tub and location were also a plus.  "
769213,29479023,2015-04-08,10828242,Laura,What a lovely place this is! A little haven in the city. We had a great time staying at the apartment. It was full of character and had excellent facilities (the soaking tub is fantastic! The bed is also very comfortable...). Kt was very helpful too. It's also in a great location for transport to Downtown or any other part of the city. We would recommend staying here to anyone heading on a trip to Seattle. 
769213,29659914,2015-04-11,358106,Paul & Jessica,"Excellent room for my wife and I to sleep, shower and prepare breakfast in. Speaking of breakfast, Marks' eggs were delicious!

Even though the apartment is attached to KT and Kirby's home, there is still plenty of privacy. 

Location was very central with great restaurants and shops nearby. It was also easy for us to park our rental car in the designated spot.

We were a bit nervous about sleeping on a sofa bed, but it was very comfortable as described. Would love to stay here again."
769213,30123126,2015-04-18,13609326,Benjamin,"My wife and I had a great time. The yard was beautiful, the robes and restaurant recommendations were great touch; as were the fresh eggs. The soaking tub was a bonus!"
769213,30294964,2015-04-20,2344230,Paul,Katie and her husband were wonderful. The space exceeded expectations and so did the hospitality. We had an excellent time and would happily return. 
769213,30473482,2015-04-22,8259668,Martin,"What a beautiful private oasis this was in the heart of Seattle! A wonderful well lit apartment backing onto exquisite gardens and not to mention the relaxing soaker tub. Kt provided great extra touches to our stay that made the experience above and beyond staying at a nice hotel. 

Thanks for everything! :)"
769213,30567913,2015-04-24,30077810,Manuel,"KT was very welcoming and more than helpful. The rental is awesome and the grounds are beautiful. Plenty of bars, eateries, and cool shops in walking distance. If you stay here spend a little time talking the chickens as you come and go. They're great!"
769213,30868449,2015-04-28,28599076,Travis,My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay at KT's apartment. The place is in a central location--close to Pike's place and many restaurants. The apartment was very clean and nicely decorated. We would definitely stay here again!
769213,31078058,2015-05-01,11175287,Trisha,"Kt gave us great directions to the home and the listing was exactly as described on the website. The apartment was clean and we opened the fridge to find fresh eggs (from the chickens in the coop outside), english muffins, and coffee. The apartment is so cute and is perfect for one or two people visiting Seattle. The soaking tub was definitely a bonus too!

Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood as well. We didn't check out any restaurants because we cooked at the apartment (the kitchen had everything we needed) but we found some really fun bars all within walking distance.

Overall, it was a wonderful stay and we would love to come back to stay at Kt's for our next trip to Seattle."
769213,31296742,2015-05-04,26019567,Kristin,Very charming apartment with the perfect location. Thanks!
769213,31933029,2015-05-12,22614610,Courtney,"Our stay with Kt was great! She was very responsive and helpful. All of the little touches were awesome, loved the chickens and fresh eggs. She even gave us sugar when we realized that we needed some for our coffee. Coffee she provided by the way!! The location is perfect, within walking distance to lots of great restaurants and shops. The soaking tub was a special touch and was really nice after a long day of walking around the city. "
769213,32316153,2015-05-17,26924266,Mia,"Host left breakfast items in the fridge for us, which we enjoyed.  The place was better than we expected and the neighborhood was convenient to several places to eat drink and be merry."
769213,33300708,2015-05-26,30447123,Susan,"Highly recommend!  Beautiful little garden unit with everything a couple could need and more.  Loved the chicken coop in the backyard as well as the fresh eggs, muffins, and coffee from KT.  Walkable to all the best restaurants, bars, etc. in Capitol Hill.  We will definitely stay here on our next trip to Seattle."
769213,33446020,2015-05-28,13666557,Amber,"KT provided such a lovely place for my husband and I to stay on our getaway to Seattle for a few days. The apartment was cozy and comfortable, and we loooooved the Japanese soaking tub. Especially being almost 8 months pregnant and walking all over the city all day! The location is perfect. Everything we wanted to do we were within walking distance from. Lots of delicious restaurants, beautiful Volunteer Park, we even had no problem walking downtown to Pike's Place market, etc. KT also left very thorough, helpful instructions for everything we needed to know and made sure we could reach her if we had any questions. We would definitely come back and stay here! "
769213,33983416,2015-06-03,6868073,Esther,"Awesome! We loved staying in this little spot tucked away in Kt's backyard surrounded by trees and (pretty quiet!) chickens. Their home is beautiful and you can tell they have taken great care with the studio. The soaking tub/shower are only one of the nice design elements, the windows and all the appointments are lovely. 

Best, you are right in the heart of everything. We stayed also in Ballard while there and we loved Capital Hill the most. I was able to walk downtown to the conference I was attending and we walked to tons eateries and bars that have received national press. 

Kt left all the essential sundries for us in the fridge, very kind. 

We would stay in a heartbeat if we return. "
769213,34152231,2015-06-05,424755,Linda,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Kt's charming and unique garden apartment! We found the bed comfortable and the space well-planned. The extra amenities such as the fresh eggs from her very quiet chickens, the organic coffee and press, and the deep soaking tub spacious enough for two were very pleasant additions to our celebratory trip to Seattle for our 49th wedding anniverary. 

Kt gave us very good instructions on finding the apartment, and the neighborhood was pleasantly interesting with lots of restaurants nearby. We especially enjoyed eating at Marjorie's within a five minute walk. For those arriving by train or plane public transportation options were readily available nearby. We will be going back..."
769213,34279226,2015-06-07,20127962,Tessa,"This was a perfect way to end a two week cross country train journey. My own little suite! And I loved it. The instructions were very clear and helpful and the soaking tub was great! The area is full of things to do and within walking distance from downtown, about a mile and a half. I walked everywhere. It is all uphill to get back but that is okay it was better than taking the city buses which seemed overcrowded and overpriced. This is a really relaxing and quiet atmosphere!"
769213,34626624,2015-06-10,29480586,James,"My wife and I arrived to find the place clean, bright, and inviting. Our host had a nice run down of further info about the place as well as some fresh eggs from their chickens. The place was wonderful and just what we needed as a base to explore the city. Our host answered questions quickly the only time one came up and if I ever make it back to the area, I would stay here again."
769213,34847641,2015-06-13,28177324,Patricia,"This was a great spot for a stay in Seattle! The space was clean, quiet, and felt like home. It was nice having a kitchen space to be able to cook meals the host even provides all the utensils you need. Fresh chicken eggs were waiting in the fridge and they were delicious! The backyard space is like a little oasis in the city. The space is convenient for anything you need to get to in the city. We walked to the Pikes Place market easily. We parked our car in the off street spot provided and didn't get in it again until we left.  We would definitely stay here again! "
769213,35067830,2015-06-15,27926385,Damian,"Our stay was very comfortable.   Checkin was very easy and as described in the house manual. We never met KT in person during checkin but she did provide a guide that gave us some recommendations of nearby places to eat and shop.  She did assure us she would be available if we did need anything and would check in periodically.  The unit had everything that we needed, including all the hotel basics such as fresh towels, soap/shampoo, and coffee maker.  The fresh eggs provided from the chickens raised in the backyard was a nice touch.  The unit did not have a television but the fast wifi made up for this and we did not spend much time in the unit anyway.  We were able to easily get downtown using the bus which runs every 10 minutes or so.  I would recommend staying here if you want to avoid paying the higher cost of staying downtown at a hotel."
769213,35292788,2015-06-17,15695517,Travis,"Our stay in the garden apartment was such a great experience. The soaker tub was super duper relaxing and we enjoyed sitting on the deck above the garage and reading. The location is perfect and even though the apartment is in the middle of the city, it was still very quiet. The chickens are cool too. "
769213,35540868,2015-06-20,4226057,Johanna,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The apt was clean and very nice.
We loved the fresh eggs from Mark, the chicken.
The apt is close to Capitol Hill and there is a bus station to downtown just around the corner.
Thanks for everything!"
769213,36009955,2015-06-24,14313941,Jill,"We really enjoyed our stay here. It was very cozy and comfortable garden apartment, you cannot beat the location either, we were able to walk everywhere. We went  to many of the recommended places from KT's guidebook and had an amazing time! "
769213,36168609,2015-06-26,4066133,Rene,"Apartment is as described. Perfect location and super comfortable. Everything is right at your door step and you pretty much can walk everywhere and there is a good connection to DT Seattle using the No 2 bus. You get fresh eggs from KT's chickens, all called Mark and everything to make coffee. All in all I had a quiet two days in the heart of Seattle without feeling far away from the happenings whilst having the quietness of a suburb. Loved the garden and the possibility to enter leave from street or back alleyway. Thanks KT "
769213,36364936,2015-06-28,7954799,Katherine,"This place is in a wonderful location and is close to cool restaurants and other attractions.  KT adds a lot of personal touches to the apartment, including fresh breakfast and a night kit. I would definitely watch here again."
769213,36854095,2015-07-02,28154524,Melissa,Great stay at this little Oasis in Capital hill. Kt gave us some awesome suggestions in the area and we really felt at home here. Thanks again!!
769213,37563618,2015-07-08,32718377,Karen,"I highly recommend Kt's garden apartment!  It was very clean, bright, and although small, had plenty of comfortable space for two.  She had several special touches, including providing us with breakfast, which was much appreciated.  It is in a perfect location for walking anywhere and was very relaxing and peaceful.  Thanks for everything and I am looking forward to returning!"
769213,37953826,2015-07-12,30122075,Aliscia,My husband and I stayed in the apartment for four days while we visited Seattle. It was very private and quiet. The location was perfect and we walked/bused almost everywhere. Love the kitchen and soaker tub!
769213,38378434,2015-07-15,31099640,Wendy,"KT and Kirby were very nice hosts. KT was always quick to get back to us when we had questions either about the place or suggestions of places to go in the area. Capitol Hill has many great restaurants and is about a 25 minute walk to Pike's Place Market. The bed was extremely comfortable, it was quiet and the fresh eggs were a nice bonus. We would definitely recommend this place!"
769213,38823441,2015-07-19,1720795,Tracy,"We couldn't have asked for a better place to spend three days and nights in Seattle. The location of this home is unbelievable. Most of the places we wanted to eat at were within a few minutes of walking. We really felt the vibe of Capitol Hill and LOVED it! The garden apt. was absolutely adorable and immaculate. We are minimalists and appreciate the style and spacing of this spot. The soaking tub is awesome as is the shower. Having a fridge and stove top are key for us. Of course the eggs from the Marks were delicious! Kt really impressed us with her warm welcome and little details making us feel like were were truly on a vacation... breakfast items ready for us, chocolates, toiletries, tea, earplugs (didn't use them but cool they were there!) and the list goes on. We hope to come back and stay here another time!"
769213,39628768,2015-07-25,29334546,Connie,"We loved staying here - easy access to downtown and all the tourist places we wanted to go to.  And I appreciate Kt making it all easy.  And we loved having fresh eggs in the refrigerator from ""Mark' the chicken!"
769213,40325235,2015-07-30,4622454,Bryan,Nice space in great neighborhood. True to listing. Excellent amenities and touches. 
769213,43024261,2015-08-17,30007304,Matthew,"The apartment was clean, cozy, and centrally located in the fun and vibrant neighborhood of Capitol Hill. We (wife and I) had a wonderful time!"
769213,43606276,2015-08-21,29897868,Yolanda Fay,"The listing was exactly as shown--adorable little apartment with lots of privacy. The soaking tub was fantastic, and the pull-out bed was more comfortable than many other beds I've slept in. We had a great stay! KT was very accommodating and friendly and promptly responded to all messages. She also left fresh eggs, cream, butter, coffee, and English muffins for breakfast. It was very thoughtful! The neighborhood is a perfect one for exploring Seattle, and we had no trouble getting around on foot/public transportation. I would stay here again on my next visit!"
769213,44405822,2015-08-26,30246070,Anita,"The apartment was clean, quaint, and very cute! Great for two people - I stayed for four nights with my boyfriend. Loved the fresh eggs and breakfast items. There was a full kitchen, which was really useful since we wanted to save money cooking food instead of going out for every meal. Great location - everything was under our feet! Very clear directions on how to arrive safely at the location. Bus stop was very close by. We felt safe and comfortable. My boyfriend kept thanking me for choosing such a great airbnb spot! Our stay was lovely. "
769213,44752701,2015-08-29,20126367,Marina,"I'd definitely recommend staying here if you want to walk everywhere in the city, live in a great neighbourhood with a lot of restaurants and live in a nice little apartment! "
769213,45239581,2015-09-01,20437295,Lisa,A great and private space perfectly described by host. Quiet at night. Terrific location with good restaurants and transportation nearby. Thoughtful touches such as eggs from owners' chickens and coffee available for guests. Good communication. Wonderful to have a parking spot. Would stay there again. 
769213,45849173,2015-09-06,1486355,Jonathan,Awesome place! Fun location with great food and bars.
769213,46276200,2015-09-09,34234040,Megan,"We were pleasantly happy with this private apartment! The accommodations Kt made were so thoughtful and the simple decor had just the right touches. She answered our questions and made great recommendations for restaurants and other activities. The neighborhood felt safe and had some of the most delicious and eclectic restaurants within a five minute walk! I would recommend taking an Uber if you don't want to walk for more than 10 minutes but that's what Seattle is all about - walking around and checking things out! The Japanese soaking tub was very cool and relaxing and the galley kitchen is very cute with just the right necessities. If we had to mention just one negative, it would be that most of the reviews said the mattress of the pullout couch was extremely comfy but we would say the opposite...my husband and I woke up each morning with achy necks and shoulders but we are also used to a very soft bed. If you're used to a firm mattress then this is the perfect place to stay and feel immersed in a great Seattle visit!"
769213,46878811,2015-09-14,37173276,Ricardo,"Lovely and cozy stay here in the private garden. Location is awesome, a very short walk to dining and cocktails. Home and property  are beautiful allowing for a very relaxed Seattle stay. We would definitely come back again. "
769213,47280909,2015-09-17,40405659,Charity,"Awesome trip! And the host made our first morning very easy. She supplied fresh eggs (from her chickens), English muffins, and organic roasted French press coffee. The bathtub was a treat! "
769213,47604832,2015-09-20,24386029,Valarie,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
769213,47719328,2015-09-21,41328857,Tamara, The apartment was very clean and well set up!  The pictures don't reflect it but there is now a small table and chairs which was helpful for working and eating.  It's very comfortable and private and the back yard and chickens are awesome!  The parking space was so helpful and the location was really amazing.  Everything was ready to go on my arrival. 
769213,48491139,2015-09-27,22981827,Lizzie,"Kt's place was fabulous! Very quiet yet so close to everything, I walked to downtown Seattle with ease. Kt provided milk, coffee, eggs and muffins for breakfast which was so thoughtful. The soaker tub was amazing. I definitely recommend staying here!"
769213,49215989,2015-10-02,424311,David,A fantastic place in a really cool part of Seattle. Only 10-15 minutes to downtown but so peaceful inside the apartment. KT was the perfect host and I will be back one day! 
769213,49677959,2015-10-05,44295553,Amy,"This is a lovely place, as described, and Kt and her husband could not be more accommodating. Highly recommend!"
769213,53486523,2015-11-09,21480019,Yura,"Great apartment to stay in Seattle. Right in the middle of the Capitol hill and within the walking distance to many things the city has to offer. Apartment was cozy with a comfortable bed, a nice kitchen and a bath."
769213,54113497,2015-11-16,18825261,Michael,"The space was amazing. I cannot emphasize more on that point. Everything was very clean. The location was so close to downtown and local Hotspot that anyone not staying here would be insane. The eggs were amazing, Mark and Mark (the chickens) didn't make any noise nor did Oola (their dog). The Japanese bath tub was amazing after a long day of walking and sight seeing. We will definitely be coming back on our next visit to Seattle."
769213,54477075,2015-11-20,1472293,Cathy,"I had a very good experience @ KT's home. The basement space was perfect for me. I think it would work very well for 2 people as well. It was comfortable, clean, well decorated. 
I had a car and it really was nice to have a place to park off the street.
A great neighborhood for restaurants.( Wish I had time for more sampling !)
The soaking tub was a really nice bonus!
I would definitely stay there again!
"
769213,54878048,2015-11-25,46884278,Trevor,Our stay was very nice at Kt's place. The place is as described. The bed is fairly comfortable. The bathroom with the soaker tub is a really nice touch. The place was easy to find with Kt's detailed instructions.

"
769213,55845143,2015-12-06,24228859,Sergio,"So where do I start? :)
The room was amazing, clean, very up to date amenities, so well insulated I didn't need the heater! Kt and Kirby made sure to take care of even the smallest detail, ear plugs for sleep, peanut butter & chocolate bites check!Haha 
The zen garden with the chickens was so very peaceful and nice to come.. Well ""home"" to, after 10 hours of exploring!
Kt and Kirby are very nice and respond so quickly to any and all problems I came across.
The location is perfect so many places to visit nearby!
I definitely recommend this room too anyone! :) 
Thank you again Kt and Kirby it was a lovely stay."
769213,56114651,2015-12-09,38985285,Devin,Great spot! Loved the tub! Wish the bed was more comfortable other then that it was perfect !
769213,56351466,2015-12-12,10506927,Eleanor,"The room is awesome, and the location is perfect for doing Seattle up the right way.  Lucky to have booked here."
769213,56662144,2015-12-16,42333495,Megan,"This place was wonderful! Clean, well-kept and KT even made sure I had eggs from her chickens for breakfast! I would recommend this place to anyone. "
769213,57295446,2015-12-24,31181888,Yeab,"Perfectly located apartment in Capitol Hill. It felt like everywhere we wanted to go was within walking distance. 

The apartment itself lacks for nothing. It seems that KT thought of everything we needed before we realized we even needed it. Parking is easy (which is definitely a plus and usually overlooked in this area). The space was small but definitely felt very luxurious and comfortable. Would definitely stay again!"
769213,57639414,2015-12-28,14645388,Hope Wesley,"Kt's garden apartment fairly glows with warmth and welcome. The layout makes clever use of a small footprint, with a long sideboard for storage and ledges along each wall providing places to put without interfering with floor space. There's a water closet separate from sink and shower (and glorious soaking tub!), while a door turns the kitchen into a spacious dressing room. The linens, comforter, and pillows have quality heft, and once folded away, the flip couch allows for a relaxing read in the light from many windows. All this plus parking make Kt's space a real find!"
769213,57873157,2015-12-30,3400214,Franziska,"Beautiful apartment! We had the most wonderful stay at KT's space, including fresh eggs and English muffin for breakfast, and a soaking tub that was oh so welcome after a cold day in Seattle. We hope to be back! "
769213,58268062,2016-01-02,13970857,Peter,"The place was great!  Clean and quiet, though literally 2 mins from all that Capitol Hill has to offer.  Soaking tub is incredible and luxurious way to end the day.  Was concerned that earplugs and other sleep kit items were provided due to noise.  Definitely not!  Place is very quiet and chill.  Sleep kit just another of the many amenities KT provides in the place.  Back yard is a little funky, but all part of the charm.  Stay here if you are artsy and want a small, clean place in a great location."
5932882,34507444,2015-06-08,34747744,Jarron,"Joanna was fantastic!  She was very responsive in the days prior to our trip, addressing every question in a prompt and thorough manner.  She arranged to meet us at the train station from the airport and generously gave a tour of the surrounding area so we might familiarize ourselves.  The house itself was spotless, with every amenity available at our disposal.  We were given our own space, while simultaneously having Joanna available for any need.  I can't recommend her enough!"
5932882,35142376,2015-06-15,34605412,William,"The stay with Joanna was really a great experience! She was super kind and helpful, even picking me up from the rail station and taking me on a driving tour of downtown Seattle to help get me oriented. The place was very comfortable and located in a nice, quiet neighborhood. It's about a $8 Uber or Lyft ride to the heart of downtown, so Joanna's place is a really great home base for your explorations. Super super friendly, nice place, good experience, would definitely stay again in the future. Thanks Joanna!"
5932882,39983825,2015-07-27,37444213,Leah,"We didn't see Joanna during our stay, as all of us were busy. The house is super cute, and she provided a computer for use, which we didn't. Overall, it was pretty much good. I would stay here again, and suggest other people stay here as well."
5932882,42154380,2015-08-11,37183380,Cj,"Omg! This is the best host ever! She gives you your space, Joanna was the host I've ever had and this is the only time I've used this site! She provided us with eggs, washing detergent, washer and dryer, wine (a plus), tour around the city, the area was quiet, she was always available, everything you needed she had it! Would definitely recommend her to anyone. I miss Joanna actually haha "
4616695,24431307,2014-12-28,2961423,Becca,"This was one of the best Air BNB experiences I've had, from start to finish. Raven is very good about being in communication and she is very clear with her information. And she will give you A TON of info on how everything will work, where to eat, what to do, etc. She was incredibly helpful in that way. In addition, her condo is fabulous. It's small, but well appointed and very clean. The artwork adds a lovely touch, as well. Getting into the apartment was easy and the building feels very safe and secure. Between walking, Uber, and taxis, you can get anywhere you could want as a tourist in Seattle. AND when we arrived at the condo, Raven had even set out a bottle of wine for us and left us chocolates on our towels. There was nothing I would change or wish to be different. Raven is a very thorough, very friendly, and excellent host."
4616695,25506748,2015-01-18,25138325,Libby,"Ravens home was super nice, even better than I had expected. It was spotlessly clean, very classy and comfortable. She provided excellent information and was super responsive any time I had a question. She did some special touches that really made it an extra nice experience. I would highly recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle. The location was fantastic, I found it easy to walk everywhere, from pikes place market to tourist sites like  Bruce Lee's grave, everything was very accessible. "
4616695,25722046,2015-01-24,23959075,Oscar,We had a really good time in Seattle and thanks to Raven's extensive list of places to go it was so much easier deciding on what to try while we were there. The apartment was clean and cozy perfect for us 2. Raven is in a great location with 15 min walk down to Pikes Market or 5 min Lyft ride and Capitol Hill with plenty to do and see at only a 10 min walk. Overall had a great first AirBnb & Seattle experience! Highly recommend anyone staying here. Raven was super friendly and detailed all which had us sold! 
4616695,26265192,2015-02-08,16999591,Ariana,"Raven's condo was perfect and she was a fabulous host. The condo is not only spotless but  it is perfectly appointed with everything you could possibly need. Beautifully decorated, antique chic condo in a great building.

4616695,27944920,2015-03-15,9125713,Katie,"Listing is accurate, just a beautiful as pictured. Very clean and welcoming --- towels and toiletries (and snacks!) all laid out for us. Super easy to access the building and leave when done with the stay. Great location too!"
4616695,28312792,2015-03-22,27189813,Cheryl,Definitely a great location and within reasonable walking distance to many must-see Seattle destinations. The home was very clean and just as described in the listing. Raven's itinerary was very detailed and instructions were easy to follow. This was a great first experience with Airbnb and I would highly recommend staying at this location. 
4616695,30194223,2015-04-19,16793795,Ryan,"Could not have been a smoother process! Raven sent us clear and precise instructions for our arrival and responded immediately to the only question that we had for the weekend.  She provided a ton of useful information about the area and even had a bottle of wine waiting for us upon arrival.  Raven's condo is in the perfect location and we walked to many of our destinations.  The building is secure and the neighborhood is safe and clean.  If we come back to Seattle, we will stay here again!  "
4616695,33067994,2015-05-25,5641340,Amee,This location was perfect. The check I was easy and Raven was a great hostess. We enjoyed the clean space and could easily walk anywhere we wanted to go. We would definitely stay again! 
4616695,36036298,2015-06-24,34597835,Matt,Lovely one bedroom place that was tidy and a perfect home base for my time in Seattle.

4616695,36186032,2015-06-26,19873355,Susanne,"Check in was simple and her place is charming and spotless. Appreciated the fresh coffee beans and milk.  The condo is nicely located, convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill neighborhoods. Walked to the new Starbucks roasters and Serious Pie on Pike.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat.  Thanks Raven!"
4616695,36380990,2015-06-28,22505384,Tiffany,Absolutely loved Raven's condo. Everything was exactly as described and tips were extremely helpful. We loved her taste in decor and the condo was spotless. The location was great as you can walk most places. We parked the car for the weekend and used Uber for longer distances. We would definitely stay here again! Thanks for sharing your home with us 
4616695,37183297,2015-07-05,5744407,Rachel,"Raven's apartment was lovely and exactly as described. 

Location: 
The apartment is in a great location within walking distance to restaurants and shops in Capitol Hill. It's also about a $9 Lyft ride from the tourist sites downtown. 

Raven: 
Raven was super easy going and communicated very well. She also made a list of tips for restaurants, places to visit, etc. which was greatly appreciated : ) 

Apartment: 
The apartment itself was exactly as advertised. Clean and well designed, stocked with bathroom and kitchen amenities. The place doesn't have AC. It was unseasonably hot when we were there (90+) but Raven left fans and the place cooled off pretty quickly. 

All in all, I'd totally stay here again!    "
4616695,38872794,2015-07-19,34957151,Luc,Raven's place was very comfortable and in a great neighborhood. She had awesome suggestions for places to eat and things to do. It was a convenient and cozy base camp for exploring the city. 
4616695,40798015,2015-08-02,500272,Christian,"I am so glad to choose this property, the access and process to get into the apartment was great, all shown in the website is what it is available, great location."
4616695,41751304,2015-08-09,31549355,Ruth,"Raven was so helpful, thorough in her information and friendly. Great at communicating and making me feel welcome! The photos don't do the place justice--it is gorgeous and kept meticulously clean and tidy! The art in the apartment is beautiful and the location is great (easy walk to Pike's Place + fun neighborhood shops). I especially loved all her recommendations for area businesses--it was great having the inside scoop. Thank you for the hassle-free, comfortable stay!"
4616695,42814463,2015-08-16,16289413,Markus,"Despite we never met Raven in person, we have to say she was a perfect host. 
The condo was very clean and comfortable. 
The location is very good and Raven gave us great tipps to explore the City. 
We had bad luck with our luggage and raven helped us to call the Airline and to contact the delivery service. We were very thankful for the ""first aid kit"" with hygiene products like Shampoo and for ms wife a comb. 
If you are in seattle, stay at Ravens condo. "
4616695,48535727,2015-09-27,40975083,Vera,Raven's place is great and just what my husband and I needed for our short trip to Seattle.  The rooms were clean and cozy.  The chocolates on the bed (which was very comfortable) and basket of toiletries we might have forgotten were a nice touch.  We slept great and appreciated the quietness in the building and neighborhood.  We took Raven's city recommendations and all were spot on.  This was our first trip without a rental car because we didn't need one and walked everywhere.  It felt great to be a pedestrian and I'm glad she gave us the nudge to ditch the car for the weekend.  We've already recommended her place to a family member and look forward to being welcomed back to her place again.
4616695,53365692,2015-11-08,15609493,Cathy Jo,"Raven was a wonderful host. The apartment was clean, comfortable and she made sure there were plenty of amenities. It was also very easy to check in and out, plus the location cannot be beat. Plus Raven provided many nearby recommendations on places to eat and drink, all of which were fantastic. I would stay here again, and recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the Capitol Hill/Downtown Seattle area. "
4718921,26194595,2015-02-06,25730847,Guillaume,"Appartement conforme aux photos. Bien desservi par les bus de Seattle. Attention, décoration très originale ;)"
4718921,31938917,2015-05-12,9809628,Abigail,I had a great stay at Tanya's place. The neighborhood is awesome. She was communicative and helpful. The super sweet kitty was an added bonus. It was nice to have a buddy to come home to. I would definitely stay here again. 
4718921,34432043,2015-06-08,28587882,Alexa,"The studio matched perfectly the offer and it was clean. It is located in a very convenient area (restaurants and bars very close, buses stops and around 20 minutes of walk from Downtown and the waterfront).
Even if we did not meet Tanya, she was very welcoming and helpful!
The only small inconvenience of our stay was the noise during the night: the walls are pretty thin, so we had to buy ear plugs to sleep better. 
I would recommend it anyway if you are in Seattle to visit!
"
4718921,35937864,2015-06-23,1007766,David,"We had a great time at Tanya's. Check in and check out was easy, Tanya's home was clean, the bed was comfy, and PJ, her cat, was super affectionate once he warmed up to us.

The location is perfect. It's a block or so from the main action, but her street is nice and quiet. 

If you're new to the neighborhood, check out Oddfellows, great brunch spot. "
4718921,36720941,2015-06-30,35972537,Ted,"The apartment was as-advertised - a cute and cozy studio in Capitol Hill.  The neighborhood was great with plenty of nearby amenities.  It's within walking distance of many bars/restaurants/shops, and even walkable to downtown at just-over-a-mile away.  Great place to stay for a few days."
4718921,38620062,2015-07-17,19718813,Hm,"Tanyas place was a great starting point to explore Seattle as everything was in walking distance for us. As a little extra we made friends with KP. Thanks again, Henning"
4718921,39603416,2015-07-25,4847703,Vlad,"Tanya's place was absolutely perfect in every single way for our five nights in Seattle.  The eclectic apartment was fully furnished and had everything we needed to make our stay pleasant.  The private entrance and patio was our favorite part (besides KP who was extremely friendly and loving).   The apartment was located in Capitol Hill, a lively area, and was walking distance to almost everywhere we planned to go.  Tanya also went out of her way to check in with us to make sure our stay was spectacular.  Her apartment was by far, the best airbnb my wife and I have stayed at.  "
4718921,39929147,2015-07-27,31691361,Kate,"Tanya was a delightful host! She was always available if we had any questions. Everything was very easy. The location was perfect and the studio was so cute and clean! Her cat is a little gem as well, very friendly and sweet. "
4718921,40350310,2015-07-30,36752213,Rebecca,"Tanya's quaint little apartment was the perfect place for us to stay while visiting Seattle.  It is located in the perfect neighborhood; it is within walking distance from literally everything!  It has a cute exterior space, it is neat and clean, and most importantly, it is home to a very friendly and talkative kitty, KP.  We enjoyed the privacy of the space, although we didn't spend much time there as we were out exploring the city!  KP sang to us at night, and it was very easy for us to access the keys.  Tanya was very communicative, and she even offered us suggestions on where to visit."
4718921,41192352,2015-08-05,28330926,Brett,"We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle at Tanya's place. Everything was walkable and the apartment is in a very cool part of town. Tanya's apartment is unique; quirky, comfortable and home to lovable cat, KP! Thanks for hosting, we had a great time! "
4718921,41734221,2015-08-09,13282182,Angela,"This was a great pick for our stay in Seattle. Price was fair, especially when you compare it to hotels and the perfect location. 

Apartment was clean and bed was comfortable. 

Tanya was very flexible and accommodating with our arrival and departures, I could not ask for more! Her friend DJ let us in and was also available if we had any questions. "
4718921,42507004,2015-08-14,1721845,Kylie,"Tanya's place is super cute & her cat KP makes a great roommate! The location was perfect for me. A lot of great places around like Elliot Bay Book Company, Poquitos, Odd Fellows & if you like a more rock dive bar type place (which I do) The Comet Tavern. All these places I found just walking around the neighborhood. 
The apartment itself was clean & fabulously decorated. Highly recommended this place & I miss KP already!"
4718921,43042696,2015-08-17,30150406,Serena,"The flat is cosy, a bit old but that's part of the charme. Not too central but at a walkable distance from the main attractions downtown and in a safe, quiet area.
The big plus is the lovely KP, a cuddly and smart sweetheart which was making my coming back a joy!"
4718921,45299252,2015-09-01,15537800,Lara,"Tanya's place was comfortable, clean and cute. The location can not be beat! Capital Hill has plenty to offer including bars, restaurants and a Farmers Market on Sunday. It's walking distance to downtown and Pike's Place Market too! I'd highly recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle. "
4718921,47720979,2015-09-21,26001695,Nathaniel,"Tanya was a great host. Very responsive and available w/out being at all intrusive. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and inviting. Towels were soft and the hot water was plentiful. We didn't get a chance to use the kitchen but it appeared well appointed Of course, best of all, the location is fantastic: super close to all the fun delights of Capitol Hill, etc but just enough off the beaten path that it isn't too rowdy at night (just a teensy bit rowdy, but that's the neighborhood!). All in all, a lovely stay and we'd be happy to return."
63733,236619,2011-04-23,500456,Kate,We had a wonderful stay with Irmgard and recommend her guest suite.
63733,383207,2011-07-19,201630,Kathryn,"Irmgard's Guestsuite was the perfect place to stay in Ballard, and my boyfriend and I highly recommend it.  The home was spotless and extremely well-appointed..  Irmgard really thought of everything down to freshly-picked local strawberries and chocolates by the bedside.  Additionally, the location is a fantastic jumping-off point for all of (email hidden)ose to Gasworks Park, Green Lake, downtown Ballard, buses into Downtown.  Can't wait to return, and I definitely hope to stay here again!  Thanks again!"
63733,415210,2011-08-02,806097,Ryan,"The B&B turned out to be nicely located in a beautiful Seattle neighborhood, which was convenient for our weekend stay in Ballard. Unfortunately, in the end, the experience fell short of what a comparatively priced hotel could offer. In fairness, Irmgard was quite friendly and was quick to respond to our emails and promised for future guests that she would address some of the negative experiences we had during our stay. If these changes were made, I could perhaps see the quality of stay reflect the price.   

Issues we had included: 1.  A distinct mold/musky smell throughout the basement living area. 2. Bathroom mold smell with cramped, dirty shower. 3. Bed linens that appeared to be 10-15 years old. 4. Food items in fridge had expired.  5. Personal items like toothbrushes were handled and repositioned out of zip locks into a cup holder while we were away.    

After our stay, Imgard was kind enough to mail a belt that was left behind. She offered to solve these issues that I posted here.  If so, this B&B might be a good choice for you Ballard stay.  "
63733,429695,2011-08-08,787564,Lonnie,"We had a great stay at the Best Value Ballard Guestsuite. You can tell that Irmgard really enjoys hosting travelers from around the world, and she has high standards for the guestsuite, which is very professionally maintained (including chocolates by the pillow and a posted business license!). "
63733,436758,2011-08-11,819609,Gabriele,Irmgard war eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Sie hatte sogar den Kuehlschrank fuer das erste Fruehstueck gefuellt! Es lagen viele Buecher und Karten bereit. Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und grosszuegig. Alles bestens!
63733,461946,2011-08-21,535271,Jack,"Irmgard proved to be a gracious host. Provided much appreciated extras including delicious chocolate candies, delightful home made slices of cake,and some everyday refrigerated items.

The apartment or flat provided every convenience. Complete kitchen, spaciousl living room with an all channel TV,  immaculate bathroom and a large bed room with more then adequate clothes closet and drawer space.

The location of the apartment makes all Seattle destinations and beyond readily accecsible. "
63733,641725,2011-10-18,154204,Debbie,"We enjoyed our stay at the Ballard Guestsuite.  The location was perfect for us, and the apartment was clean and cozy.   Mrs. Castleberry is a thoughtful and attentive hostess.  Will definitely stay here again when we visit Ballard."
63733,663532,2011-10-25,1236565,Sheri,"Fantastic hostess, with all the amenities anyone could ask for!  The private entrance was a plus!!  Will definitely return!"
63733,703775,2011-11-08,1335848,Deborah,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. We were approx. 3 blocks from our kids place where we celebrated our granddaughter's 1st birthday.  The suite is very homey and comfortable AND we slept better than we have in a very long time on the posturepedic bed! We cooked our own breakfast on Sat. and Irmgard had the dishes put away before we got back from the birthday party. The fresh flowers were such a nice touch. We are looking forward to our next stay during the Ballard Seafood Fest.
Vic & Deb Miller"
63733,808376,2011-12-27,1472204,Dave,This was a delightful place to stay.  We spent two weeks here while we visited our new grandson and his parents.  We could not have asked for a better place to stay.  Many extras were provided for us.  We will return many times.
63733,865698,2012-01-16,1546905,Roman,Amazing experience. Very welcome and friendly environment with just the right mix of privacy and local assistance. Will not even consider any other hotel or B&B when visiting Seattle again. 
63733,1064841,2012-03-31,35189,Sherry,"This is a comfortable, peaceful place with luxury towels and linens, a comfy mattress, well-stocked kitchen, and an excellent location in the Ballard neighborhood. The hostess is welcoming and friendly and available to help or advise if desired. She does housekeeping in the unit daily, providing fresh towels, etc. and also provided fresh flowers during my stay. What a lovely touch! I had everything I needed and more. I definitely recommend Irmgard and her guestsuite, and I will stay here again. Many thanks!!"
63733,1160207,2012-04-21,1850535,Meredith,"I can't say enough good things about my stay at the Ballard Guestsuite.  This is my first time visiting Seattle, and Irmgard made me feel welcome and supported.  She provided a map with directions to the local grocery store and helpful hints about parking in town.  I strongly recommend this place for solo travelers and those who appreciate privacy.  It was great to come ""home,"" relax, and be totally self-sufficient.  Thank you for everything, Irmgard and Ben!!    "
63733,1174848,2012-04-24,1335848,Deborah,We felt right at home again. This was our 2nd time staying at Ballard Guestsuite. We would recommend anyone to stay there!
63733,1227044,2012-05-04,1329978,Bill,"A very comfortable, extremely well-appointed suite in a quiet residential neighborhood. Attention to detail in attending to guests' needs, including quality body care products, daily European chocolates, umbrellas for the not infrequent inclement Seattle weather, even a sewing kit (which we used) in a basket of things you never thought to bring on a trip, but just might need in a pinch. And Irmgard is the ultimate gracious hostess. A gem of a find and an excellent value."
63733,1359169,2012-05-27,572826,James,A beautiful and private offering by a most gracious host.  Look no further because the Ballard Guestsuite cannot be beat.
63733,1422297,2012-06-05,2400978,Kathy,"- Lots of space and parking.
- Nice kitchen, living room, bedroom and private bath.
- Strict Hostess, always home, with lots of rules, felt like 
  we were walking on egg shells.
- The space is private, but not sound proof. You have to be very quiet.
- Came in to room every time we left to run errands to unplug     
  kitchen appliances.
- It was nice to get fresh towels.
- Spotty wifi
- It was fine, but next time I will book a hotel for $40 more. 
"
63733,1548403,2012-06-24,2326611,H.,My parents had a wonderful peaceful stay. They loved the flowers. Irmgard is a wonderful host. I would and will recommend this site and Irmgards place to others. thank you!
63733,1569790,2012-06-26,2588772,Loralee,"A lovely spot - quiet and peaceful. Irmgard was a thoughtful hostess - unobtrusive, but every need anticipated. I highly recommend this spacious, clean, charming apartment!"
63733,1896692,2012-08-05,3096973,Bryan,What a great place in a great location! Irmgard was a very welcoming hostess with a lot of helpful suggestions for our move to Seattle. The place itself was clean and safe with all the amenities you could need. Thanks for the great stay!
63733,1983283,2012-08-14,2432638,Carla,"Very cute, cozy place to stay!  It reminded me of a well-furnished cabin because it was so cozy and made you feel at home - except this cabin is just minutes from downtown areas and has every amenity you would get in a hotel (coffee, cereal, soaps and shampoos - even chocolates by the bed!).  Irmgard was extremely thoughtful in every detail, and very helpful with explaining local buses and where to walk and providing maps, etc.  The bed is VERY VERY comfortable and there are lots of windows for fresh Seattle air.  You aren't right in the hustle-bustle of things, but its not hard to get there when you want that.  Old Ballard was a walkable distance and everyone in Seattle suggested this as THE place to be. The Ballard guest suite and Irmgard's warm hospitality were an important part of our wonderful Seattle vacation! "
63733,2124336,2012-08-28,1236565,Sheri,"Just completed our second visit to Irmgard's guestsuite.  Everything was perfect, including the most comfortable bed, along with night-time chocolates!  Convenient location, whether walking, driving, or riding the bus!  Thanks, again, Irmagrd!"
63733,2179035,2012-09-03,2994693,Kay,"What a wonderful get away. The apt is so cozy and quiet. We had a chance  to go out and paint the town red, but opted to stay in and enjoy the cozyness of the apt ater a long. day. We highly recomend Imgards lovely apt. We will be back. Thanks agair Kay and Dan Loibl"
63733,2274825,2012-09-14,2773858,Mark & Heidi,"Fun stay. Irmgard goes out of her way to make it so. Quaint setting, clean, comfortable; good stock for breakfast in the fridge with some nice extras. Full kitchen, comfortable bedroom and mattress. North of Seattle, so a bit of a journey from the airport. If going downtown -DRIVE- you can park on the near north side in the city center parking center --- ten bucks for ten hours. It's right at the space needle and the ducks (recommended). Skip the music museum; unless you're Hendrix or Grunge fan, it has little to offer -- expensive too.  Also, from the center area you can take the monoraill downtown. Anyway, the B&B is a great value. Would stay there again!"
63733,2626611,2012-10-15,1017390,Morgan,"Irmgard's Ballard Guestsuite is a cozy little home away from home and a great value.  The host's description of the place is spot on, right down to the fresh flowers and chocolates.  The place has been well loved, but is very clean, full of character and the bed is super comfortable.

Irmgard was a gracious and accommodating host, especially considering our visit was very last minute.  She was quick to respond to our inquiries and made us feel quite welcome in addition to being a helpful source of information on the neighborhood and city.

We would certainly be happy to stay at the Ballard Guestsuite again!"
63733,3163552,2012-12-27,4117842,Karla,"We had a lovely stay at Irmgard's and Ben's Ballard Guestsuite.  The location was perfect for us and convenient to shopping, markets and sites.  The accommodations are a great value and were spotless, and the kitchen was fully equipped; I was even able to do some Xmas baking. Our hosts were gracious and accommodating.  We had everything we needed for a very pleasant stay.  We will definitely come back our next visit! 

Happy New Year to the Castleberrys,

We will stay here again if available."
63733,3527570,2013-02-12,196816,Caroline,"We had a comfortable and great stay at the Ballard Guesthouse. Irmgard is an excellent host - we had a late flight out and she was able to let us check out later. The space is super clean and quiet and is spacious. Our towels were changed daily, the bed was made daily and we even got chocolate by the bed every night. They have lots of Seattle travel guides available and I highly recommend the restaurant, Blue Glass, just a few blocks from the house. "
63733,3740573,2013-03-10,3702188,Alessandra,"Irmgard's gues tsuite was wonderful! She paid much attention to detail. Everything was as expected plus a few pleasant surprises (flowers, chocolates..). It was a great AirBnB experience. I would definitely stay with her the next time I am in Seattle."
63733,4102138,2013-04-09,3558099,Lamont,"Irmgard is a fantastic host. Her guest suite was very clean, cozy, and comfortable. There were clean towels provided every day and breakfast food and drink in the kitchen that you could help yourself to as well which was much appreciated on my part. Also, Irmgard herself is very nice and considerate - when she noticed I left something important after my stay she sent me an email telling me so and offered to mail it to me even though I had left. Overall I would definitely recommend staying at her guest suite and will do so myself when the need arises again."
63733,4138779,2013-04-13,5586300,Daniel,"This was our first use of airbnb and we are sold! What a great way to travel. We were met at the car when we arrived, and it was late nearly midnight. There were a few goodies in the refrigerator to use for breakfast, coffee, tea even juice. Maps of the area brochures of things to see places to eat. The rooms were very clean nice comfortable bed  and a sweet each night on the pillow. Full kitchen a setting room with a nice flat screen TV.There was even a list of all of the channels  Next trip to Seattle this is where we will stay."
63733,4476403,2013-05-07,5724404,Ruth,We had a very pleasant stay at the Ballard Guest House.  It was like having our own apartment while we were there.  The accommodations were quite nice - very clean and well kept. Irmgard had a well stocked refrigerator so we did not have to go out for breakfast.  The fresh flowers and chocolates each night were a nice touch.  We will return.
63733,4511197,2013-05-09,6121861,Benjamin,"Irmgard's place is very comfortable, clean, and has everything you need. She is very sweet and professional. The Ballard Market is also very good and very close."

63733,4838889,2013-05-28,5492424,Lina,"Irmgard's guest suite is the perfect blend of cozy and spacious. The location was perfect for exploring Ballard, the University District, Lower Queen Anne, and Capitol Hill. Irmgard's hospitality was truly splendid - fresh flowers, chocolates on the bedside table, a hand annotated map, and a schedule for the Folklife music festival. A wonderful place and an even more wonderful hostess!"
63733,5111362,2013-06-13,851906,Jim,"We had a great time in Seattle, and this is a great place to stay!  It's so nice having your own home to come to home to at the end of the day which is exactly how you feel.  We lived in Seattle for a number of years, but Irmgard provides an almost encyclopedic knowledge of the area is is quite gracious.  We will stay here again."
63733,5257550,2013-06-21,652306,Evan,"Irmgard is an amazing host.  She provides an incredible level of service (she provided clean linens and made the bed everyday) while respecting your privacy.  She is also very nice and was flexible about our check in time when we asked to drop off our bags on the first day of our stay.  Irmgard's apartment is also very convenient to several bus stops.  Overall, we enjoyed our stay here a lot and I would stay here again.  I will also recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle."
63733,5364179,2013-06-26,6298781,Jeff Or Ann,"What a great experience! Irmgard is a wonderful hostess. Fresh flowers and berries from her garden were just a few of her personal touches.Great location, quiet neighborhood. I would love to stay here again."

We appreciated the level of attention and detail that she provided from our initial email communication to our warm welcome in person. Irmgard is a most gracious hostess who made sure that our stay with her was very enjoyable. It's no surprise that she has many repeat visitors!

Tha Ballard Guestsuite is in a very convenient location in an historic neighborhood and made an excellent home base for our time visiting with friends. This is a cozy and comfortable apartment that we are hoping to return to next time for a much longer stay!"

Irmgard's place was close to them and the main shopping area in Ballard.  The place was great.  She made sure my parents were comfortable and had everything they needed. The suite was warm, had a stocked kitchen and spacious living room. My parents enjoyed their stay"
63733,10689589,2014-03-03,11983889,Shan,Our stay with Irmgard Castleberry was excellent and she is a very gracious host. The little extra things that she does really makes you feel welcome in her home. The house is very clean and private. Just want to say Thank You Irmgard and we will stay again.

63733,12288423,2014-04-28,13383325,Bill,"This was our first airbnb rental.  Nice location, quiet, clean, and comfortable.  It is a basement unit with lower ceilings, but everything was very nice.  The bed was comfortable and we slept well.  Great neighborhood, Irmgard met us when we arrived and showed us the unit, and was available during our stay.  Overall a great experience."
63733,12636089,2014-05-06,14156533,Mary Beth,"This was our first visit to Seattle and our first Airbnb experience. We were not disappointed! Irmgard is warm and accommodating, a wonderful host. The guest suite suited our needs perfectly, personal touches were noticed and appreciated and off street parking is a plus. We will definitely stay here when we return to Seattle.  "
63733,12834631,2014-05-12,2880861,Desiree,"This was our first Airbnb stay. Irmgard was a wonderful hostess. The basement apartment was very clean, with a new mattress in the bedroom, and nice fluffy towels in the bathroom. Irmgard left a map highlighting grocery stores and local places of interest within walking distance. 

We loved the fresh flowers! The tasty local coffee in the cupboard was a nice touch! They did an excellent job paying attention to the little things, like leaving the light on and turning on the heat when we came in late one evening.

The neighbors across the street tend to park directly across from the driveway. We found it easiest to back in the driveway so we didn't have to worry about accidentally hitting cars parked on the street."
63733,16077127,2014-07-22,2853544,Edmund,"The location and neighborhood were fine.  We only stayed 2 evenings so we did not walk the area although we noticed many previous visitors had and found it charming.
The guest suite was in excellent condition.  It was extremely clean and had all the amenities you would need to be at home.  Irmgard even left a basket of toothpaste, toothbrushes, bandaids, sewing kit, etc for your convenience if you forgot something.
She had milk cream, yogurt, English Muffins, etc in the refrig. for our breakfast.  
My only concern was when she came to our suite in the evening to tell us to turn off the fan in the bathroom because she could hear it.  She was stern and interrupted our otherwise pleasant evening.  We then felt like she was listening to us.  She also comes in to clean everyday.  
We still would recommend her place."
63733,16682122,2014-07-31,18209201,Jamie,"Irmgard was a wonderful host and very accommodating overall.  The Guest Suite was exactly what we expected - cute, clean, comfortable and spacious.  There were fresh flowers, some items in the pantry for us, and nice notes and information about the area. The location was excellent - close to many activities, restaurants, and bars. "
63733,18191811,2014-08-23,19170347,Mary,"I enjoyed my visit at Seattle-Ballard Guestsuite.  The basement apartment was very cozy.  Irmgard was very friendly and helpful--she was available to give directions and answer questions.  The neighborhood was nice and seemed family oriented.

I was by myself, so I do not think my host knew when I was in their basement apartment, which has access to their living spaces without  going outside. I was studying during the day and out at night visiting with my son. The first night I was out with my son and missed the friendly 'turn-down' of the bed!

I did not have Verizon cell phone service while there.  The wifi service worked fine as did the cable service.
Thanks Mary

Thanks for a "
63733,18633865,2014-08-29,1295300,Monica,"Host is a very lovely lady. Her hospitality is visible from the moment you step in the guest unit. Fresh flowers, nicely stocked pantry, tourist information- everything you need to make your stay really special.
The neighborhood is very nice. Public transportation to downtown is within a few easy to walk blocks. A few more walking blocks and you have some of the best restaurants in the city.
Will be back!"
63733,19060016,2014-09-05,1995022,Stephen,"Wonderful place, like your favorite perfectly prepared with everything you'd need grandmothers basement. Irmgard is warm and and I was perfectly comfortable and made to feel welcome....would stay again in a heartbeat!!!!"

63733,20285383,2014-09-27,19074080,Christel,"Staying here was the first time in decades of travel that I truly felt I had my own home away from home. The suite was very well appointed so that we had all the little things missing from other places: lots of hangers and closet space, toiletries, full-size kitchen full of kitchen stuff, blankets, plentiful lighting, private parking, private entrance, great bed, etc. We used the bus stop across the street to easily go downtown, yet at the same time the nights were quiet for sleeping.

The only negatives were no big deal for us: low ceilings and a weak wireless signal. We didn't even notice the ceilings till my partner tried doing a reach-for-the-sky stretch, but someone over 6' would have to do some ducking between rooms. We just used 4G for internet, which worked great with both AT&T and Verizon. 

We didn't see too much of our hostess as we had a very active stay, but when we did she was very nice and helpful. Every day while we were out she came in to clean up, making the bed, and leaving fresh towels and chocolates. She accommodated my allergies very well, even washing our sheets in a special unscented, organic laundry detergent. We felt very well taken care of.

I can whole-heartedly recommend Irmgard's Ballard Guestsuite. We hope to return again someday."
63733,20478288,2014-09-29,16978225,Zannah,"Irmgard was the best host we have ever had, and such a lovely woman. She was so helpful, right from the moment we knocked on the door to when we checked out. The guest suite is perfect, it has anything you will need whilst being on holidays. The extra little touches are so sweet, the chocolates by the bed, the vases of flowers on the tables, fresh towels daily. She was so helpful. The apartment is very comfortable, nice sheets on the bed and very comfy mattress. She helped us with which bus to catch and what time we needed in order to get to our train on time. She had a great knowledge of how to get around the area and nice places to visit. She is very hospitable and made us feel at home.
Ballard is a lovely area, the streets are beautiful to walk around, there are sweet shops to look in and a lovely farmers market on Sundays. 
This is the most well set up airbnb place we have stayed at. She has literally thought of everything to make your stay as comfortable as possible. 
If we ever return to Seattle we will definitely stay at Irmgard's, and I highly recommend staying there to anyone else visiting the area. 
Thank you Irmgard!! "
63733,20622673,2014-10-02,14895533,Anita,Irmgard is a wonderful hostess.  Very warm and inviting.  The apartment is in the basement and looks just like the pictures--very cozy; you don't feel like you're in a basement.  Irmgard left the day's newspaper and chocolates by the bed everyday besides making the bed and refreshing the towels.  Lots of great little touches (flowers) that makes it feel more like a home.
63733,21035250,2014-10-10,10033000,Bruce,Irmgard's guestsuite is spacious and very well appointed.  Even the little things like paper towels and toilet paper are of the highest quality.  There is off-street parking.  I would stay there again and I highly recommend it to all travelers.
63733,21147789,2014-10-12,12220150,Nancy,Irmgard's was a cozy basement unit. I appreciated the breakfast items stocked in the kitchen and small touches throughout the place. She was even nice enough to lend us an iron.
63733,21358441,2014-10-15,14895533,Anita,"As always, staying at Irmgard's was the best.  Always very comfortable and roomy.  And Irmgard is a wonderful hostess."

The apartment is sweet, clean, quiet, and perfectly suited to our needs. We were warmly greeted even though traffic left us arriving late (10p). Fresh flowers, chocolate by the bedside, and ""emergency"" food in the cupboards and fridge--including gourmet coffee--made us feel both pampered and at home. The towels are plush and the bed is incredibly comfortable. This was our second visit to the guesthouse and we will be back. Thank you Irmgard!"
63733,21889950,2014-10-26,21616382,Holly,Irmgard was the perfect host! She was very accommodating and attentive. She left chocolates and pastries and great coffee. The guest suite was exactly as described and was perfect for my visit. It was in a perfect location too!

The neighborhood is so quiet and lovely....no noise at night....amazing for (email hidden)is was a great deal."
63733,23213811,2014-11-25,5462960,Alan,"Our stay with Irmgard and her husband in the lower floor (basement) of their Ballard house couldn’t have been more comfortable. Irmgard was certainly proactive in contacting me via email and we arranged a suitable check-in time with her. When we did finally get to their home (easy to find) I was happy to find that they had off-street parking at the house. Irmgard showed us our accomodation and described everything we might need to know for our short layover. I don’t think she left any questions unanswered on our arrival.

We were impressed with the sheer attention to detail that was evident in this AirBnB, right down to providing fresh and sealed travelers toothbushes for those of us who might have arrived unprepared. The kitchen was also fully stocked and we availed ourselves of English muffins generously included by our host. The AirBnB itself is spacious and exactly as described (living room, bedroom and kitchen, all with very acceptable dimensions), although calling it a basement unit unfairly conjures up for me at least a typical underground living space. Evidently people in Seattle use this term a little differently and the area is airy and light (with only a short step down from the side door into a small foyer. My wife had been slightly worried about potential for mold in the bathroom, but the room was spotlessly clean and we had no concerns at all with the envionment.

The AirBnB is conveniently situated a block from a main bus line, and certainly within easy walking distance from some major Ballard grocery stores, etc. Highly recommended for any length of stay."
63733,23299829,2014-11-28,6808127,Jeanine,"Irma was a gracious hostess. She made us feel so welcome. There was  much attention to detail to make our stay extra enjoyable. Really a nice place with lots of amenities. A comfy bed and a designated place to park were great, too. My favorite feature was the touch to go on lamps!"
63733,23504526,2014-12-02,5029500,Simon,Great little hideaway
63733,24690342,2015-01-01,9462621,Alexander,Irmgard is a wonderful host. She gave us a very welcome stay and clear instructions as to where everything was in our place of stay.  She was also not intrusive at all during our stay. 
63733,26023426,2015-02-01,1275166,Wendy,My parents stayed for a week. All the comforts of home. Fresh towels daily and well maintained kitchen. Very comfortable bed. New flat screen TvV (not shown in pics). Located on a quiet street with off street parking and convenient to supermarkets and city attractions. Daily maid service was a nice touch. Owner was so nice and helpful. She even stocked the pantry with some breakfast item. They plan on staying again.

The place itself is great as well. Lots of space for the two of us, and also included a parking space for our car rental. It's in a great location, providing easy access to Ballard and adjacent neighborhoods. It's also just a short drive into downtown.

We would definitely stay here again. Great place for a great value!"

63733,30318948,2015-04-20,8576371,Jean,Irmgard's guest house was comfortable and the kitchen had several food items available to use. She had wonderful information detailing what to see and how to get around the Ballard area. She was helpful and friendly. 
63733,30516707,2015-04-23,9810769,Anoop,My fiancée had a very comfortable stay. The breakfast foods were her favorite!
63733,30863777,2015-04-28,4712840,Michael,"Irmgard was the best host one can ask for. Beautiful home in beautiful Ballard. She hosted my mother on her visit to Seattle and gave her all the comforts of home - thick towels, fresh flowers, clean house. 

The unit has an ample kitchen, stocked with all cooking and dining needs. You can't beat the location. Walking distance to downtown Ballard - farmers market, local restaurants, bus lines, you name it. 

We will most definitely stay here in the future!"

63733,31178954,2015-05-03,20915769,Lynn,"Irmgard was very accommodating in letting us pick up our key a little early. The Guestsuite is in a handy, centralized area of Ballard-easy walking to the downtown area. The neighborhood is quiet and the off street parking is very convenient. Several unexpected touches- staples in the fridge and most important - good coffee with a coffee maker. Overall thumbs up!"
63733,31585965,2015-05-07,24694722,John,"Irmgard was a lovely hostess.  She clearly takes a lot of pride in providing a cozy and welcoming environment.  The location in Ballard was a great little headquarters for us to explore Seattle, which we were able to do through public transportation alone.  Plus, Ballard was an awesome neighborhood to stay in, tons of great food!  Check out The Fat Hen for an amazing breakfast just a walk away."
63733,33528315,2015-05-29,29590276,Gerd,Thank you Irmgard for sharing your beautiful rose garden.  We enjoyed our stay again.  It was peaceful place to be after our busy days in the city.
63733,33802031,2015-06-01,6949029,Judith,"Irmgard was a very welcoming and thoughtful host.  She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the apartment.  The apartment was very roomy, very clean and quiet.  The off street parking is a big plus, especially in Ballard where parking spaces are at a premium.  Irmgard has a lot of useful information in the apartment to assist in sightseeing.  Lots of good books to read, too.

I highly recommend Irmgard's apartment and plan to stay there again."
63733,34076922,2015-06-04,29590276,Gerd,Irmgard is a great host. Thank you so much
63733,34434077,2015-06-08,1236565,Sheri,"Irmgard's hospitality is superb!  Her Ballard guestsuite has everything a person needs, is extremely cozy, and convenient to Ballard shopping and restaurants."
63733,34634977,2015-06-10,31376357,Catherine,Irmgard is delightfully sweet and welcoming. She made me feel very much at home in her spacious apartment. The kitchen was well equipped. The bed was very comfortable. Especially comfortable was the retro Lazy-Boy-type recliner in front of the TV! It is located in a quiet residential neighborhood within easy walking distance of restaurants and grocery stores. I took long walks in the morning and this would also be a good place for runners to stay. 
63733,34947204,2015-06-14,30283429,Breanne,"The guest suite was great. This was our first AirBnb experience and Irmgard set the bar high. We enjoyed the fresh daily towels and chocolates. 

The location was great. There was a bus to the Space Needle across the street and it was just a short drive if we wanted to take the car to downtown. "
63733,35479600,2015-06-19,33647267,Johnny,"Irmgard was welcoming and thoughtful. She greeted us upon arrival and showed us around the place. The Guest suite was roomy and quiet.  Being able to park in her drive-way was a big plus as parking is tough to come by in Seattle.  Irmgard provided useful information about sightseeing and how to get around, also nice candies to eat every day.  The location was ideal as it’s in a quiet neighborhood but only a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle.  Many highly rated restaurants were also with-in 10 minute drive from her place.  My wife & I enjoyed our stay and appreciate the hospitality & value Irmgard’s place offers."
63733,35645444,2015-06-21,20208555,Julie,This place was I'm a great location. Irmgard was very welcoming and ensured we had everything we needed. The bed was comfortable and the additional breakfast food was great.  Thank you for allowing us to stay here.
63733,36040638,2015-06-24,3141403,Sharon,"A great experience! Irmgard was so warm and attentive. The home was lovely, almost spotless. The neighborhood is terrific, pretty quiet and well-kept. Plenty of parking. I love Ballard! The Internet access was a little weak. But otherwise, I could not have been happier."
63733,37159650,2015-07-05,22932154,Rich,We had a wonderful stay in Seattle thanks to our lovely guest suite.  Our host Irmgard was very flexible as to our check-in time gave us a great overview.  We also had many breakfast options to fill up on before our sightseeing.  Very close to public transportation that arrived frequently.  We highly recommend staying here for any trip to Seattle!
63733,37465633,2015-07-07,1343404,Brandon,"Irmgard is an attentive hostess, and does her best to make sure you're comfortable. As others have mentioned, chocolates await you in the evening, we had fresh flowers in and around our place, and a bit of food stocked in the fridge. Irmgard can help you get around with bus advice, and information about the sights.

The guestsuite is walking distance from the zoo, and from a retro game shop, as well as a few nice bars, such as the tin hat. In all, we had a nice brief stay - I particularly liked the assortment of weird mugs (including one with a viking ship that said ""Grandpa"" that I wanted to take home with me (I didn't of course)), curious knit throws, and watercolor paintings. It was like being at grandma's house, but you were left to your own devices. Recommended!"
63733,37653979,2015-07-09,29590276,Gerd,"Irmgard is a great host.  Clean towels, great bed and quiet. She welcomed us with a smile.
"
63733,38092561,2015-07-13,12130060,Alexander,The apartment is fantastic: large and fully equipped with lots of details which made us feel like home. We also liked the quiet neighbourhood and found it easy to get into the city centre by bus. Irmgard was a wonderful host and took great care of us.
63733,38418918,2015-07-15,36185510,Ketti,"We arrived a tad earlier than expected and Irmgard was happy to welcome us into the suite before lunch. The apartment is a perfect 'piece of home,' much needed after a few weeks of road tripping, and the neighborhood is excellent for it's proximity to downtown and Fremont. However, driving to areas such as Kirkland or Bellevue was (unsurprisingly) a ways off, so be aware that you may have a fair trek to those areas unless you take toll bridges more directly! 

The house was incredibly welcome, and the small touches of hominess like chocolate each night and fresh flowers made it feel as if we were staying with family. Irmgard and Ben were also super quiet upstairs, and we tried our best to return the favor! My boyfriend is 6'5"" and Irmgard mentioned this as a good thing to note for future guests - he hit his head on a doorway once as they are a bit low but if you're his height you're likely used to such troubles ;) He had no problems with it, but some folks may want to take that into account.

The complimentary Seattle coffee in the cabinet was also delicious in the mornings and much appreciated, but be aware that the hosts do come in for 'maid service' to straighten up the towels and such - we felt bad for leaving a dirty coffee pot and cups in the sink as someone washed it for us while we were out! Thank you for that. Hopefully our second morning made up for the first!

Overall, thank you so much for hosting us in Seattle! We hope to recommend this place to friends and return ourselves eventually."
63733,40063262,2015-07-27,39463938,Yvee,"Irmgard was a lovely host. I loved her European style of B&B. She made us feel very comfortable and at home. The basement suite was very clean, comfortable and well organized. She waits up for all her guests to arrive (we arrived at 11pm) and gives everyone a tour of her place. She even showed us how to operate the lamps/TV. How many times have you visited a hotel and spent 15 minutes trying to turn on a lamp? Irmgard made sure all our bases were covered; an excellent hostess. Chocolates in the bedroom and fresh flowers from her garden were a great touch. I also loved the teddy bear collection that greeted us at the front door. 

Even though it says that breakfast is not included, Irmgard had a variety of cereals, jams and frozen waffles for us to eat. She even provided coffee, tea, and milk as well. There was even real maple syrup for the waffles (a delicious treat).

The neighbourhood is very lovely and the #28 bus takes you directly downtown. Ballard is a great place to stay: lots of lovely shops, breweries, cafes and restaurants. I would argue that we had a better experience touring Ballard than downtown Seattle. Further, Irmgard's neighbourhood is quiet, with no loud noises at 2am that you often get when staying downtown. Definitely a great place to visit for a relaxing weekend.

We wish we could have stayed longer and had more time to chat with Irmgard, so we hope to return in the near future. I would say that this is a gem of a B&B, for an extremely great value!

63733,46488039,2015-09-11,39346232,Maximilian,"Staying here was a great experience!  Irmgard is such a warm and friendly host.  She really cares, and it shows from the moment you arrive. There was homemade cake and plums picked from her garden waiting for us. The house is in one of the best parts of Seattle in terms of things to do (nearby shops, bars, scenery) and proximity to essentials (groceries, gas, etc.).  It's also located right off a major road that has easy access into downtown Seattle.  Very convenient. The room is spacious and has a real nostalgic feel to it.  My wife and I felt like we were at home.  The fact that Irmgard has off-street parking available was fantastic, too.  Overall, a great place to stay, and Irmgard is one of those sweet souls that you don't meet very often and never forget. I highly recommend this location. "

The place is huge and we wish we had more time to spend in this nicely home but we left in the morning and came back around 10 at night everyday. Every night we came back, the suite, the towels, the bed sheets are all clean. Very comfortable bed, pillows and comforter. Very warm place. No need to worry about getting a cold. Lastly, we will definitely come back and stay here at Irmgard's guestsuite again. ~Joanna"

This is the second time that we stayed with Irmgard.  Her place is very comfortable.  It is quite spacious.  The bed also is quite comfortable.  Another nice touch that my husband liked was the nightly chocolates by the bed.
If we can get in, we will be back the next time we come to Seattle."

It is also exceedingly well equipped with any reasonable staple one could want and some of Seattle's best coffee. Downtown is no more than a 15 minute drive and the University district even less. We couldn't ask for more."

443736,1249569,2012-05-08,2216740,Whitney,"This is a great little space in a wonderful part of Seattle.  I can't say enough good things about it.  There's a lot going on in a little space, but the bed's so comfortable, the kitchen's great, wireless internet is convenient, laundry's right downstairs, and the porch is awesome for those sunny days.  The apartment is in a quiet and nice neighborhood--look for the parking that isn't limited to two hours--there's a street nearby!  There's a bus stop less than a block away that takes you to all the great spots downtown--so easy!  And Capitol Hill is right out your doorstep. 

Monika is just as great as the apartment.  Despite the fact that we were unable to meet before I ""moved in,"" we communicated well.  She's very on top of things and so friendly and helpful.

Definitely consider a stay at this apartment--Monika offers it at a great price, too!"
443736,1459274,2012-06-11,2441499,Marah,"Monika was very prompt in her responses to all inquiries we made. We decided to change our plans a day before we were to stay in her place, and she was very accommodating to those changes. The apartment was in a convenient location to downtown and the bed was comfortable… exactly what we were looking for. We did not use the kitchen but appreciated that it was clean and ready for use if we needed it. "
443736,1507185,2012-06-18,1783955,Andrea,Monika's place was great for what we needed. It was very clean and Monika was very accommodating to our needs and easy to communicate with. I'd recommend her place if you want to be near Capitol Hill but not right in the action- it's a quiet neighborhood.
443736,1575136,2012-06-27,1190852,Ellie,"Monika's place is great. It's just spacious enough for one person, with a large bathroom and fully-functional kitchen. It's conveniently located on two major bus routes into downtown Seattle. Monika made it really easy to arrive and leave. Thanks for making my stay enjoyable!"
443736,1756088,2012-07-20,1593262,Joshua,"Great experience! Monika was awesome to communicate with and always responded to any questions right away.

The space itself is great. Great bed, awesome bathroom and kitchen and the back deck is wonderful. Very private. The neighborhood is a short and enjoyable walk to the heart of Capitol Hill and close to Ezell's Famous Chicken!!!!

I gave it 4 stars due to a lack of any closet space but not a big deal. There is plenty of room and surfaces to put clothes etc."
443736,1787682,2012-07-24,2401459,Tiffany,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Monika's while attending the Capitol Hill Block Party. We never met Monika, but she and her house mate Kayla provided us with everything we needed! It was a great space and I can't express how cozy. Although we didn't spend too much time there, we loved coming back to it every night. It felt like coming home! If you ever stay, make use of the lovely patio and kitchen. The location was perfect to for us. We were able to walk to the event every day and pass several amazing restaurants and coffee shops. We went to Presse twice! If you are in a pinch and need something, there is a small convenient store down the street that has limited items. 

I have to say that I did love the eclectic artwork sprinkled around the studio. It was fun getting a sense of her artistic style. It also seems that her yard is in a ""transition"" face, but that didn't bother use too much. It was far better than staying at a crap hotel 15 miles south of the city. This was my first time using airbnb and it lived up to it's expectations. I will be using again when staying in NOLA this fall. It has now become my go to place when searching for places to stay in a city. 

Thanks again to Monika for being a great host and having the cutest place in a great hood!!"
443736,1849110,2012-07-31,2512988,Nathan,"This is a cute space in a convenient location in Seattle. The area is very quiet even though public transportation and a number of good bars and restaurants are nearby. The back deck of this apartment is a particularly enjoyable feature and is very relaxing and surrounded by greenery. My only complaints have to do with the state of the apartment upon my arrival. The floors, toilet, and shower were not sufficiently clean for a guest having never been there. Additionally, and curiously, there was nowhere to put my clothes. I essentially had to live out of my suitcase for the duration (6 days) of my stay as there was no drawer or closet space provided. Overall, I would recommend this space so long as the host takes these comments into consideration for the next guest."
443736,1901986,2012-08-06,1309848,Melissa,"The place was great! Simple, clean with a great deck and yard. It was a great location - walking distance to all the great restaurants and bars of Capitol Hill. We would stay again."
443736,1956407,2012-08-12,1652755,Brittani,"Monika's studio is great. The incredibly soft yet immensly supportive bed is worth checking out the place alone.  Everything that we needed was available for us and we loved the location. We had no issues until the day that we were set to leave, I forgot about check-out times (my fault! luckily we completed everything on the check-out list) but Monika flexible with us (we appreciate it!).  "
443736,2304159,2012-09-17,2911129,Celeste,"Monika was an excellent host. Everything was clean and organized, and she was very helpful and communicative. The Cherry St. House was charming and quiet, and close to the best stuff on Capitol Hill. I will definitely be staying here again."
443736,2344159,2012-09-19,247753,Long,Great location! Stayed here for two nights and i really enjoyed the cozy apartment. A lot of points of interests are with in walking distance. 
443736,2362627,2012-09-21,206203,Amanda,Monika's private studio is a great value in a centrally located part of Seattle. The back deck is one of the nicest features. Monika was a clear communicator and check in and out was easy. It is orders of magnitude nicer than any equivalent priced hotel.
443736,2808717,2012-11-05,1009258,Sandra,"Monika's place was lovely, had everything you could need and in a great location! Couldn't ask for better!!"
443736,4541596,2013-05-11,2599478,Cory,"5 weeks of grad school left for this wife + Mama of 2 teens. I needed a beautiful, quiet, safe Room of My Own to reflect, sleep + keep up on my beginning trumpet practice while writing two final papers. I  put off finding a place until the day before I needed it. When I saw Monika's studio apt it looked ideal. She got in touch w/me right away and all the arrangements ahead of time were super easy. The place was immaculate + set up well for my needs. Bedding was comfortable, even luxurious. I made many of my meals there. Great to have different areas in such a small space. Monika has a way with color and feathering a nest; I felt physically held in beauty. There was a deck at tree level w/a great table + chairs so I could write among the birds. I took a bath twice in the incredibly spacious bathroom (especially for a studio apt). Great place, great location, great deal. I hope to be back."
443736,5127272,2013-06-14,5570996,Eliezer,"What an amazing spot - cozy, funky, perched high among the trees (flickers and starlings and squirrels and jays nesting all around), light pouring in from all sides, a luxurious deck, a fully equipped kitchenette, boldest house color in the neighborhood, Monika - and the manager Erin -  helpful, responsive, easy-going. 

Great, diverse, central location too - walkable to Capitol Hill, to the International District, to Downtown, to the Central District ... a small stretch to Lake Washington, the Arboretum, Interlaken Park. 

Really, I stayed for a month and can't even come up with a quibble. 

I hesitate to recommend it only because I may want to stay there again - and would be sad if it were already taken!"
443736,6533552,2013-08-16,6949593,Anne-Lauren,Cute and cozy!
443736,7043442,2013-09-04,8035203,Bridget,"Monika's apartment was clean, cozy and a wonderful place to crash. It was easy to locate, had everything we needed and Monika was readily available to answer any questions we had. Our stay was thoroughly enjoyable - would recommend this place to anyone! "
443736,7172743,2013-09-09,7275560,Natalie,Thanks for a great stay in a very convenient area. Internet works well and the apartment was really comfortable. Will stay again when I'm in Seattle.
443736,7308607,2013-09-15,8169089,Luke,"This is a great spot to use as a home base while spending some time in Seattle.......  Right on bus lines that run in to the heart of downtown.........    As for the unit itself,   it was clean and comfortable........   Very private with  a great deck for relaxing on in the evenings,   after spending the day pounding the city streets.......   I would definitely stay here again..........    "
443736,7663004,2013-09-28,6114537,Fany,The reservation was canceled 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
443736,9074281,2013-12-04,1479830,Ben,"I didn't get to meet Monika, but everything was exactly as she said it would be! This was a great location for me to get around town and to get to the hospitals that I needed to visit, and I'd definitely stay there again. I didn't make use of any of the kitchen stuff, but it looked like everything was in order. Thanks!"
443736,9122344,2013-12-08,9600303,Tom,"I did not get to meet Monika in person, but she is still my hero.  I locked myself out in sub-freezing temperatures, and she responded to my panicked text within two minutes, so I did not have to stand there freezing.  Thank you Monika!

The apartment was just as advertised - a small studio with a lived-in feel, within in walking distance of several good restaurants (it is worth going a bit further for the ribs and sweet potato pie at the Barbeque Pit), and right on major bus lines.  It was too cold for me to check out the deck.  The neighborhood was very quiet.

Monika seems to have addressed the issues raised by earlier reviews - there is a bureau with plenty of drawer space, and a rack for hanging clothes. I did not try the queen bed with the foam rubber pad, but the single bed had a real mattress that was plenty firm.
 "
443736,9387566,2013-12-25,5919992,Helena,"This was my first visit to Seattle, and now I know where to stay when I come back! :) House is very clean and cozy, no surprises. Everything detail is provided in the house manual, and I had no problem getting around the city, since bus stop is literally right in front of the house. Thanks Monika!"
443736,9417638,2013-12-27,10786902,Derek,"The place was a perfect crash pad for me as a single person who likes to adventure in the city lights but come home to peace and quiet as it's technically in the city, but out of the hustle and bustle and noise of the commercial areas. Everything was clean and Monika and Erin were more than accommodating with me booking at the last minute before Christmas Eve, and even responded to issues I had that night with the internet. I would definitely stay there again."
443736,9484805,2013-12-30,10759354,Annah,"Monika's apartment was pleasant, cozy, and excellently located. Though I didn't get a chance to meet Monika, she was very responsive and answered all my questions. I recommend her as a host."
443736,9626564,2014-01-03,3531035,Coston,"Great place with room for 4, although it was only me. Small kitchen, but more than enough to sustain yourself for a weekend. Good location to the Needle, Marketplace and nightlife. 

Thanks for a great stay!"
443736,9836030,2014-01-13,2621461,Bryn,"This is such a nice space, very comfortable and welcoming.  The host is an artist, and has some really great pieces displayed.  I really enjoyed my stay."
443736,10073636,2014-01-28,10307819,Jordan,"Had a brilliant stay in Seattle at Monika's place. Nice a cosy and well located, it really accommodated my needs perfectly. It is very much self-serviced and I was able to cook breakfast each morning and get out to everywhere I was hoping to see in Seattle. A great host!"
443736,10676342,2014-03-03,3781795,Lisa,Very charming studio. I would definitely stay there again on a future visit to Seattle.
443736,10761223,2014-03-06,9981887,Cate,"Monika's place is lovely, secure and easily accessible, and provided a cosy nook to crawl back to out of the Seattle rain. it's got everything you need, was clean and quiet and a very comfortable bed! Thank you!"
443736,11024678,2014-03-17,11111794,Sophia And Tom,"We had a lovely experience in Monika's studio apartment. We enjoyed the artwork and brightness of the studio. The place is small, but nicely laid out. The kitchen was well-stocked with cooking utensils and the bathroom was very roomy. Perfect for a mini getaway vacation for two! The bed was also extremely comfortable. The apartment is in a quiet location, with a short walk to the local food co-op and neighborhood coffee shop. We didn't get a chance to meet Monika, but we had no problems with check-in and any questions that we might have had were answered in the House Manual. "
443736,11554666,2014-04-07,9385689,Stuart,Nice and quiet place to relax and explore the city!

443736,12152303,2014-04-24,12737229,Kale,"I will say that this place was so-so.  Showed up at 3 pm and there were dirty sheets on the bed and wet towels in the bathroom.  Called Monika and she was a bit rude exclaiming, ""check in is at 5 pm.""  Checked my email confirmation and check in was actually 2 pm.  Regardless, we left so that the place could be cleaned. Monika wasn't apologetic.  Emailed her our confirmation email that afternoon just so she knew that her supposed check in wasn't what it said in our email and never heard back. 

In terms of the place, it was fine but nothing extraordinary. If you're in a pinch stay here.  Otherwise, look for something else.  "
443736,12328329,2014-04-29,59728,Allison,"Great little budget place that is located in a central neighborhood. Very quiet and safe neighborhood. Lots of bars/restaurants/shops close by in Capitol Hill. We actually walked nearly everywhere we wanted to go, but transit access was easy. Kitchen has all you need to make a meal in the house. Wifi worked well. We needed a few more towels and Erinn, the property manager, promptly delivered. We had a great time during our first Seattle stay."
443736,13561541,2014-05-31,9971915,Jenee,"Monika, I love how you put your creativity into every aspect of your home.  It was a pleasure staying at your apartment and very convenient for my internship.  Thanks again so much!"

443736,50947568,2015-10-16,44457936,James,The listing was very accurate and helpful. The neighborhood seemed pretty nice. The house is about a block away from a hospital. 
443736,51918388,2015-10-25,33400373,Samantha,I enjoyed staying here. Monika and Ryan both are helpful. I appreciated Ryan's quick response when I had questions while I was there. Lots of great little restaurants up 12th St. I found the apartment to be cozy. The bed was very comfortable!
443736,52294625,2015-10-27,30712936,Matt,Quiet and convenient accommodations.  Never heard or anyone.  Great communication.
443736,52442533,2015-10-29,6893173,Ian,Monika's upstairs studio is a great home base for visiting Seattle. It's centrally located and within waking/uber distance from lots of great spots. They've done a great job with the space and it's extremely cozy. Would love to go back next time!

443736,52856186,2015-11-02,37732389,James,"I enjoyed the large studio apartment.  It was comfortable and functional.  I particularly appreciated the full kitchen and privacy of the unit.  I personally would have liked a comfortable reading chair, but was able to adjust pillows and read on the bed.  A very nice unit that is a great value."
443736,53691371,2015-11-11,11937279,Angela,"We loved this house, it was so cozy and beautiful! The self check in and out was easy and it was a really nice place to stay!"
443736,53866119,2015-11-13,48358593,Curtis,Cute studio in a ceteral location that allowed us to access everything we needed. Clean with comfortable bed. Easy and convenient check in and check out process. 
443736,55609535,2015-12-03,5906994,Izabela,"I stayed at Monika's place for 2 weeks. The place is really comfortable and private. You have the private entrance, small kitchen and your own bathroom which makes you feel like at your own place. The location is really good, approx 20 min to downtown by bus. The bus stop is just 1 min walking from the house. 
I didn't have a chance to meet Monika but I met Ryan, the house manager. He seems to be a really cool person...
To sum up, my overall impression was good. I would recommend this place both for long and short stays.

Thank you Monika and Ryan!

It was a good stay at her place."

443736,56400626,2015-12-13,24457317,Eira,"Monika's private studio apartment was amazing! She had everything set up, because we arrived pretty late at night and we didn't have to disturb anyone to let ourselves in. The bed was very comfortable! I would definitely sleep in that bed my whole life if I could! It is very clean and close to the bus that takes you to downtown pretty quickly. The neighborhood is calm, we slept without outside noises, eveything was amazing, it made our stay enjoyable, even though we didn't get to meet her, I love that she had everything organize and set up to fend for ourselves, and made easier the process to check in and check out."
7619727,47498330,2015-09-19,4938692,Martin,"This is a great place to stay in the Seattle area. Sara's home has a wonderful feel to it. It was as if we were visiting a long-time friend's home. It was welcoming, very comfortable, in a charming neighborhood, and offered easy access to public transportation. 
Sara made everything easy for us. 
We will look for this place next time we visit Seattle."

4608208,30265318,2015-04-19,6671256,Sam,"Sallie was a fantastic host, and her place was absolutely ideal!  Located right next to Discovery Park and the Ballard Locks (Hiram M. Chittenden Locks), it has an advantageous placement for bucolic beauty and urban entertainment.  Sallie was communicative, kind and very generous with her time when my transportation was delayed and was unable to show up until a bit after my original check in time.  The place is cozy, eclectic and the bed was incredibly comfortable :-)  I encourage anyone looking for either quiet relaxation or easy access to nightlife (restaurants, bars, breweries, etc.), this has both!  I was easily stay here again"
4608208,33247048,2015-05-26,29871901,Katharina,"Sallies Home is a great place to stay. Both rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. The House is near to Discovery Park and the metro station which goes directly to Downtown Seattle.
Sallie was a great host. She's kind and likes to chat and her cats are so lovely. I enjoyed my stay very much! "
4608208,33634059,2015-05-30,30283498,Melli,Sallie has been a great host to my boyfriend and me. We stayed at her nice room for two nights and the bed could not have been more comfortable. Sallie was very kind and helped us where she could. We would definetly stay there again.

The room is cute, clean and we appreciated the homemade cookies left for us at check in. The two cats are very friendly and the coffee in the morning delicious. We loved the location, really not that far from downtown Seattle and also very close to Ballard and a lovely park. I would recommend going to this location if you want to use airbnb around Seattle much more than south of the city and around the airport!"
4608208,34885520,2015-06-13,25718640,Jacqueline,"Sallie is a very nice host. Her house is very pretty, tidy and clean. The bedroom is beautyfull with a great bed and 2 steps away from our private bathroom. 
We got to have breakfast everyday at her beautiful garden. We used her kitchen every day. She gave us this wonderful coffee blend that was perfect to start the mornings.
We went for beautiful walks through the park and to Ballard.
The bus to downtown is a 10 min pleasant walk from her house."
4608208,34977200,2015-06-14,31692156,Maureen (Mo),Sallie was a lovely hostess and her home was very welcoming.  Her side yard is a little garden oasis and the house is situated on a quiet street near Discovery Park.

Our room was a perfect size, with double-chocolate cookies and an info sheet on the dresser. The location is good, centrally located in the Seattle area for anyone wanting a quiet place to stay away from the downtown area. "
4608208,35433266,2015-06-18,33069108,Namgyu,"Sallie was kind and has warm-heart. She has two cats, however, the cats are very quite and didn't bother me at all. Sallie provided muffins for breakfast. Moreover, there is a private guest restroom and beautiful garden. It was so comfortable that I don't want to leave her house. It takes about 30 minutes from downtown by a bus."
4608208,35693692,2015-06-21,7548613,Martha,"Sallie greeted us at the door, very nice lady and accommodations.  The room was nice and perfect for our needs.  The house is nicely decorated and enjoyed spending time having conversations with Sallie.
She was very helpful in suggesting areas to visit and places to eat.  We really enjoyed staying here.  We would definitely stay again the next time!"
4608208,36809115,2015-07-01,35483586,Thomas,"This was my very first Airbnb stay and my very first stay in USA and it was great: Sallie told me a lot about the nearby Discovery park, about Seattle and the whole country. She helped me improving my English. The rooms were clean and pleasant."
4608208,37209062,2015-07-05,5283976,Bruce,"Nice quiet neighborhood.   Sallie was a good host, left us cookies and water when we arrived.  The place had everything we needed, very clean and tidy.  Loved the cats.
Thanks Sallie for the stay.
 "
4608208,38894143,2015-07-19,7749552,Grace,"My husband and I had such a wonderful time in Seattle and it wouldn't have been possible without our comfortable stay in Sallie's home. We were so impressed that on a whim we decided to stay an extra night to make use of the surroundings. So grateful to have gotten one more day here. 

From the get go Sallie was very welcoming and warm. She has a beautiful garden oasis and added a cute touch of fresh flowers and lavender stems in the guest room and bathroom. It was sweet to see the detail she puts into making your stay enjoyable. Not to mention the delicious double dark chocolate french cookies that awaited us. 

Her cats were a delight and for your allergic ones out there they are not allowed in the guest room or bathroom so no need to be worried. Her home is very clean. 

Though I've never heard of the location we stayed at until we found her listing I was pleasantly surprised how convenient and local it was to everywhere we went. Most that we did was not more than 15 min away, even downtown to Pike's place, the Westlake shopping center, and the various parks and eateries around. Discovery Park which is a stone throws away provided a great walk/hike to the coast with a view of the sound. 

Thanks Sallie for your kindness and hospitality. It was a true blessing! Hope to use your place every time we visit Seattle! 
"
4608208,39795420,2015-07-26,36569742,Ginny,"I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Sallie's place near Discovery Park. She was full of suggestions about things to see & do. The location was convenient to major sites, as well as the local area of Magnolia, which was charming.  Sallie made her home welcoming and it was easy for me to come & go as I pleased.  Everything was as promised and more!"
4608208,40123995,2015-07-28,36813512,Jeri,"This was our first time using Airbnb. Sallie made our stay enjoyable because she is very nice, respectful and helpful. We only used her place to sleep and shower. But thought it was very kind that she offered muffins, coffee and cereal for breakfast. We also appreciated her expertise on the surrounding area like the lighthouse.
The shower was great and having free parking and wifi was important. 
Thank you Sallie!"
4608208,40393779,2015-07-30,39312402,Astrid,"Genom Sallies små handskrivna lappar och nyintagna blommor kände vi oss riktigt välkomna!  Rummet var litet men mycket fräscht och nystädat. Jag och min dotter delade på sängen och det gick fint. Jag har stora behov av sova på en bra säng och den fick helt ok. Vi fick ta del av Sallies kök och fick eget badrum. Vi hade även tillgång till Sallies trädgård och där passade vi på att äta frukost -  härligt! Det tar 30 min med buss till centrala Seattle (området Space needle). 
Vi promenerade till slussen för att se slussning av båtar; endast 5 minuters promenad. Rekommenderas att även promenera ut till fyren - det gjorde inte vi men är säkerligen värt en promenad. Vi kände oss oerhört välkomna - denna plats rekommenderas verkligen! Det är enkelt att vara gäst hos Sallie - hon är en hyresvärd väl värd sitt uppdrag!

4608208,40794591,2015-08-02,1829443,Anne,"It was absolutely lovely to stay with Sallie. She is a very welcoming,  friendly and helpful host and everything was very clean and pleasant. The neighborhood was simply great. This is the perfect place to be, if you like to discover Seattle and fancy a nice and quiet surrounding afterwards. Thank you Sallie!"
4608208,41043534,2015-08-03,28234306,Ayesha,"Sallie was a lovely host! Her home is beautiful, warm and welcoming! We stayed one short night with her, as it was a last minute trip, but she was prompt to reply to my messages which was appreciated. 
The room and bathroom were equally welcoming and very clean. She was friendly and gave us enough privacy to make ourselves at home. Thanks again Sallie, hope to stay with you again soon! "
4608208,41622836,2015-08-08,36058243,Mingmin,"Very accurate as described--clean house, quiet neighbours and beautiful views. Sallie was very sweet, she prepared us some muffins, bananas and teas. I love the decoration in the house, it reminds me of home. The cats (Gustav + Flexi)  are super adorable and friendly, sometimes they will escort us out and welcome us back~ highly recommended!!"
4608208,41793180,2015-08-09,37187767,Beth,"Sallie was friendly and welcoming. We only stayed one night but enjoyed the comfortable bed and we're happy to have a clean private bathroom. A kitchen cabinet, space in the fridge, and dishes are available to guests. Sallie also offered fruit, muffins, yogurt, coffee, etc for breakfast. Street parking was available and easy."
4608208,42004635,2015-08-10,38573173,Jess,"It was my first experience using Airbnb, and I am happy with the way it turned out! My partner and I found Sallie and her home to be very welcoming, comfortable, and clean.  She has a lot of experience with hosting guests, and it is felt. Magnolia is a quiet neighborhood by a few parks. Really lovely."
4608208,42303118,2015-08-12,4000182,Julie Ann,"Sallie is such a lovely, friendly woman! Her house is very clean and cozy! Really comfy bed! The neighbourhood is quiet and peaceful! Perfect location for a trip to Seattle! 15 minutes to downtown and 10 minutes to restaurants and shops in Ballard and Fremont! Plus Magnolia's cute town centre is walking distance! Discovery Park next to her house is wonderful - right in nature within a huge city!!  I will definitely stay again next time I am in Seattle! Thanks, Sallie!!"
4608208,42897165,2015-08-16,30121784,Vic,This incredibly charming home is nestled in a quaint neighborhood.  The hostess greeted us like she had known us her whole life engaging in delightful conversation and allowed us to explore the enchantment of her gardens.  We were there for an intense class in Seattle and it was a perfect space to melt away the day only minutes away.   
4608208,45453528,2015-09-02,3418582,Angie,"Sallie is a most gracious host. She stayed up late to welcome me and her home is just as it's described, ""A quiet oasis in Seattle"". 
She explained everything very clearly and was very helpful. 
Her sweet kitties are a delight and a lovely addition to my stay.
Breakfast items & tea/coffee were yummy.
Beautiful neighborhood... one of my favorite parks, Discovery Park is just mins away.
Stepping outside into the garden was so lovely to drink my tea and eat breakfast muffin.
I will definitely recommend her lovely space to stay in Seattle.

Sincere Gratitude,
Angie"
4608208,46144538,2015-09-08,12680138,Aaron,"My wife and I only stayed a few days, and we wished we could have stayed longer! Sallie's home is in a wonderful neighborhood nestled up against a park, but only a few minutes away from downtown. The mornings were peaceful, and the cats (Gustav especially) were always more than happy to provide company.  We hope to visit Seattle again, and Sallie's listing will be the first we check!"
4608208,47209744,2015-09-16,20230438,Spencer,"What a great place! The room is a little small, at least if you're staying with two people, but the bed and pillows are quite comfortable. My wife and I stayed for a week so we had a bit of luggage, but there is plenty of drawer and closet space that once we unpacked and loaded the available space the place opened up more. Gustav and Felix (the two cats) are sweethearts as well. They enjoy belly rubs and are always lounging about. Sallie made us feel very welcomed. There was tea, coffee, and assorted breakfast stuffs for the morning that we didn't have every morning, but were great when we had no plans. She also knows a lot about the area and gave recommendations for food and destinations to visit. My wife and I told her we toured Theo chocolate and as a parting gift she bought us a bar of chocolate. It was a sweet gesture that she was not obligated to do, but was friendly and appreciated. She also told us where the sale was so we could buy more! Great room. Great cats. Great host!"
4608208,47451420,2015-09-18,43630881,Tammy,"Listing was even nicer than expected! Quiet, safe, lovely neighborhood.  Sallie was very welcoming & friendly.  She has a key ready for guest use & has friendly notes in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, etc to answer any questions you may have.  Would say here again if visiting Seattle.  "
4608208,48259435,2015-09-24,44130387,Gisele,"Sallie contacted us to make sure she could accommodate our arrival time and was very flexible when we let her know that we would be getting into town a bit late.  She was a gracious host and helped point us in the direction of a late night snack.  The house was warm, clean, and inviting.  The neighborhood was in a nice, safe residential area, easily accessible to the downtown area by car.  Plenty of parking available."
4608208,48474932,2015-09-26,44108530,Wayta,"Our accommodations were indeed a quiet oasis. Sallie was helpful, clear, and the home, very clean. The nearby village was sweet."
4608208,48812773,2015-09-28,2896338,Amy,"Sallie was very welcoming, and her house is located in a very nice area of Seattle! I had a great experience, and I felt very comfortable during my stay. I will definitely come back the next time I'm in the Seattle area! "
4608208,49054892,2015-09-30,4000182,Julie Ann,This is the 2nd time I have stayed with Sallie! She is a super friendly host who goes out of her way to make her guests feel comfortable in her home. Home is immaculately clean and quiet! Very comfortable bed! Quiet neighborhood in the forest next to Discovery Park! And so close to downtown! Will definitely stay again and again!!!
4608208,49922944,2015-10-07,4000182,Julie Ann,"Another fabulous stay at Sallie's quiet, immaculately clean, comfortable, and centrally-located home! A 5-star experience all around!!"
4608208,52015003,2015-10-25,47054813,David,"Sallie is a wonderful, lovely host, helping to make my wife and I feel very welcome and comfortable.  As many prior quests have commented upstream, house cats Felix and Gustav deserve equal credit and praise!  Furthermore, Sallie provides great coffee and terrific herbal mint shampoo.  All this, a very clean, charming house, and close proximity to Discovery Park, downtown and northern Seattle -- you can't go wrong!"
4608208,54533132,2015-11-21,5252016,Alan,"Lovely eclectic home, clean and comfortable. Our host was gracious as were her two cats. Very quiet neighborhood off the beaten track."
4608208,57754105,2015-12-29,29898056,Heather,"This was a GREAT place to stay!  Sallie welcomed us so graciously from the very beginning, her home is beautiful and the room and bath were very lovely and comfortable!  She had tasty snacks for us and was great to talk with when we crossed paths. Her home is in a beautiful and safe and quiet part of Seattle.  The whole stay was simply the best!! Her home is very peaceful, and it was perfect for us to visit relatives and also have some restful quiet!  We're spoiled now!"
4608208,58484435,2016-01-02,9072709,My,Sallie was very welcoming. My girlfriend and I had a very lovely stay with Sallie. The room was very clean and comfortable. Would definitely consider staying there again! 
458189,3637008,2013-02-26,5081305,Eric,"This was our first experience with Airbnb.  I suggested the option to my girlfriend after hearing about the site though my cousin.  I am glad we went this route.  Chris hosted our stay in Capital Hill and his house was well kept after.  We rented the modern room in the Pure Space and it is completely catered to travelers.  Tons of creature comforts, kitchen ware, Roku, WiFi, kickass celebrity style vanity room,  2 comfy lounge areas, community style kitchen area, the whole nine yards.  Near the end of our stay we had a chance to meet with Chris and he was very accommodating.  Pretty laid back, with a sense of good will toward his fellow man.  If we find ourselves in Seattle again we will definitely look to stay in either the same house or another one of his properties. "
458189,3723637,2013-03-08,5135882,Diego,Everything was perfect. You have bars and restaurants really close to the place! You are a block away from route 49 which takes you right into downtown and Chris is a great host! Thanks Chris I really enjoyed my stay!
458189,6183687,2013-08-02,7637726,Alex,"I had a great time at Pure Space.  The room, bathroom, and common space were all clean and well maintained, and Chris made every effort to make me feel at home.  Also, the location was very convenient, close to tons of restaurants and bus stops.  I would recommend this place to others."
458189,6311068,2013-08-07,7532228,Karim,"Chris was super helpful, friendly, and the place was great and in a fantastic location."
458189,6908354,2013-08-29,6448635,Brian,"Chris was the consummate host, the house/room were in pristine shape and well-stocked, and the house is in the perfect Capitol Hill location.  Despite a SNAFU with the mobile app that auto-booked me during a family weekend at his place, he still made us feel right at home, and even introduced us to the rest of the fam.  I enjoyed the place so much I recommended it to my ex-wife and her new boyfriend.  That sounds like a slam, but it's not - we get along great.  I said ""You gotta go here!"", and according to her, she will be very soon.  :-)"
458189,7293497,2013-09-14,2364807,Chris,"Room was very clean and the rest of the house (kitchen, bathrooms) was great too. Chris was very responsive to any questions I had. Thanks!"
458189,7572048,2013-09-24,7748689,Tom,I wish I had found this place sooner. Incredible space with everything you could need and more. It's location is fantastic if your after a cool vibe and great places to eat. Highly recommend.
458189,7994041,2013-10-11,8759331,Lukas,Chris Home is awesome its one street behind the Brodway where all the Bars are located. But it's still very quiet! You can easily walk downtown or just take the bus. The room is nice and there is a big kitchen with everything you need!
458189,10305689,2014-02-11,2134070,Kimberley,"Cozy and eclectic house in a nice quiet neighbourhod. Loved our stay here and the entire reservation / check-in process was very easy. Could not have asked for a better weekend stay. 

Outdoor hot tub was amazing!!! Would definitely recommend booking Chris' house for a big group."
458189,19110279,2014-09-06,2253532,Jeff,"Chris was a great host. The house is beautiful, and the location would be hard to beat, a block off Broadway but the street is so quiet you wouldn't even know. Also, great kitchen facilities and a nice patio in back."
458189,19236568,2014-09-08,2595068,Alina,We had a great stay. Chris is very helpful and welcoming. The location is perfect. I don`t think I could have found a better place to stay for the weekend.
458189,19798765,2014-09-18,20946375,Veronica,"My friend and I booked 2 nights in Chris' Modern Room.  Chris was very welcoming and offered suggestions as to where to have some good drinks!  We met a few more people who were either staying for the night or visiting for a game of poker, and they were all friendly as well!  Good people!  We actually only needed 1 night in the Seattle area and had to leave quite early the next day... Which was a drag because the bed was soooo comfy!  We were reimbursed for the night we didn't stay which was great too :) We would definitely stay here again if either one of us were travelling through!"
458189,25616128,2015-01-20,25536180,Thomas,Listing was accurate. Place was beautiful and clean. Would definitely recommend to people visiting Seattle. 
458189,27611705,2015-03-08,28225894,Abhinav,He was very welcoming and answered all the calls and messages prompty. Also  gave me the option of choosing my room which was really great.  Room was well maintained with TV and lamp shade. I would really come back and stay again.
3657819,16443092,2014-07-27,18688556,Jochen,Maria and her husband were very friendly and welcoming. I especially liked the welcome beer they placed in the fridge for me. The rooms are newly renovated and very cosy. The neighbourhood is very quite and seems safe. There was even a shakespear performance in the park across the street.
3657819,16525225,2014-07-28,18662301,New,"Maria and Paul's place was a great stay and just what my friend and I needed for our trip to Seattle for CHBP. Everything was super clean and comfortable. Maria and Paul greeted us when we arrived, provided us with everything we needed and then some - snacks, coffee and breakfast for the morning, cold waters and even a few beers in the fridge. Overall a really pleasant experience. "
3657819,16867890,2014-08-03,16720467,Neph,"This was a great space, quite, cool and clean. 

When we first arrived we we’re not sure what door to knock on, so we went towards the back as we had mentioned checking in at 3. Maria was a feeling a bit under the weather, but was super nice and helpful, gave us a quick tour, showed us where the cold beers and snacks were and that was the end of our interaction while there (which was totally cool with us).

The place is very nice and clean. The entry way has a nice table to sit and drink a cup of coffee. But I think the upstairs is the gem of this place. Very well lit, and it has a nice closet and plenty of space. There is no AC and we were there in probably the hottest day in Seattle, but just the windows open, really air the room and keep it really cool. There is a park pretty much across the street some on a weekend you hear some people/kids playing, and there was a concert at the park or something one of the nights but it wasn’t bad. Whlist the bedrooms and the entry are great, the bathroom and sitting/dresing room are really shallow, the ceilings are really low. I am 6’2” and I think the highest point of these might be 6’3”… the bathroom is small but very functional, if you are below 5’9” you might not feel at cramped. 

Over all the place is nice, and Maria was great. "
3657819,17014903,2014-08-05,10547933,Erin,My stay with Maria was great! So hospitable and the place was clean and very comfortable. Maria was so sweet and accommodating!
3657819,17125894,2014-08-07,10814684,Tomas,We had a great stay at Marias house. The place is clean and very cozy. Bed is super comfy. The Ballard area offers a lot of great restaurants and bars. Would definitely return!
3657819,17596515,2014-08-14,3774092,Paul,"Delightful space. It was clean and tastefully decorated. The space offered more room that I originally thought, not cramped at all. The location was central to all the things we wanted to visit while in Seattle. The location was in a very quiet neighborhood. Maria was very helpful and was a great host. Nice touches like wine and snack items in the fridge were great after hours on the road but not quite dinner time. I look forward to staying with Maria when I return to Seattle next. "
3657819,17666643,2014-08-15,3774092,Paul,Great place. So nice in fact we extended our stay a second day.
3657819,17725624,2014-08-16,5579292,Kathy,"Maria left us wine, beer, and water in the fridge and greeted us on the steps with a loaner umbrella as we rushed into the city for various activities. "
3657819,17863895,2014-08-18,3180670,Catherine,"We loved our stay in Ballard!  The adorable suite was well-stocked with beverages and snacks which we so enjoyed.  And since I had mentioned liking live folk music venues, Maria left us a suggestion for a show in the neighbourhood which we ended up checking out.  So great being within walking distance to the entertainment district of Ballard! Checking in and out was seamless and easy even though we did not meet our hosts face-to-face.  And the place was immaculate and comfortable.  This will definitely be a go-to place in Seattle from now on...  "
3657819,18137425,2014-08-22,19413299,Hannah,"We traveled to Seattle for a week and stayed in 3 different areas with different Airbnb hosts throughout our journey.  Maria's little apartment was our favorite by far! She was a great host leaving us a kind note upon our arrival with everything we needed to know as well as some eggs, granola bars, apples, yogurt, a bottle of wine and plenty of bottled water in the fridge.  And that bed - super comfy! Although we never ran into her throughout our stay, she was great about staying in touch via email and they're location is pretty convenient to everything.  We will definitely be recommending her space to others who travel to Seattle.  

Just an FYI, the ceilings are very low as this is an extended apartment to a house if you are a tall person (Not low enough to have to duck anywhere except maybe door frames)!  Luckily I'm only 5'1''! "
3657819,18200691,2014-08-23,13168493,Monica,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I swear this is the only way I will travel from now on. While I didn't get a chance to meet Maria, she was very warm and welcoming in the way she set up her adorable home for us. I especially appreciated the delicious homemade muffins and yogurt that we got to enjoy before rushing off to explore in the morning. It is a sweet home in a charming neighborhood perfect for experiencing the lovely town of Ballard. Overall, it was exactly what we were looking for and I would recommend it to anyone!"
3657819,18283584,2014-08-24,2348245,Darcy,"Great spot, Maria was very helpful and communicative. The place is well stocked, sunny and in a good part of town."
3657819,18672165,2014-08-30,4905967,Geena,"We were expecting a standalone house, but this was more of a half-house, or duplex, where the other half is being remodeled.  The space was nice and mostly new, but the only thing separating the private space was a door leaning up against a doorway so sounds could easily travel through.  At night (9p) while in bed we heard what sounded like someone coming into our space through the main door twice, but I believe that they were actually going into the part under remodel.  It did scare us at first, then we heard someone letting a dog out and moving furniture in the other space.  I'm sure that since the remodel is ongoing that this situation will be remedied quickly and it might have been a one-time experience, but you might want to ask the host to make sure.  Maria was really nice.  When we visited, the kitchen was just a fridge and microwave too, but sink/water is coming as well.  The area is close to Market St for eating/shopping and you can rent bikes at Dutch Bikes down there too.  The park across the street is really nice and you can easily take the 18 or 40 bus to downtown for a few bucks."
3657819,19034867,2014-09-05,4896531,Karen,"Maria was great and the most welcoming host I've had so far on Airbnb. She left muffins, yogurt, bottled water, wine, juice boxes, candy, popcorn, - the whole gamut - for us and restocked it each day so we never ran low. She also loaned her bikes to us (although we never got a chance to ride it around, a pity!) as well as her umbrella. I was so impressed by her (website hidden), the only ""downsides"" are the quirks to the house which did not affect the quality of our stay at all: low ceilings, bathroom can be a tight squeeze, and they're still renovating the other side of the house (they never worked on it while we were staying there). As I said, this did not affect our stay because we were mostly only back there to sleep. As for the neighborhood, it was really safe and only a block away from a park which was a treat. Thanks Maria!  "
3657819,19633385,2014-09-15,20742080,Angie,We really enjoyed staying at Maria's home. It was a nice getaway for my sister's bachelorette party. We had fun going to the restaurants and bars in downtown Ballard which was only a 10 or so blocks away from the house. Maria left us lots of snacks and made our visit very comfortable. 
3657819,19757683,2014-09-17,8217115,Mike,"Maria greeted us as if we were family coming for a visit.  She had added extras to the suite for us such as some breakfast items and a bottle of wine.  When Maria heard that we were ""foodies"" she placed some interesting cookbooks for us to peruse.  We were very comfortable."
3657819,20101233,2014-09-23,20423077,Darcy,"Maria and Paul's flat is very clean and the bed is extremely comfortable! There were lovely muffins and yoghurt in the fridge and an excellent coffee maker that I took full advantage of. The neighborhood is residential and as per Maria's suggestion, I rented a car to get myself around, including going into the high street of Ballard, a very charming area with a lot of restaurants and shops.  Driving into downtown Seattle only took about 15 min during the weekend which was faster than I expected. Thanks to Maria for providing a detailed map and other information that was very helpful. I didn't get a chance to ride a bike, but I did see a bike helmet which is good to have. 

A wonderful stay- I would stay there again (but hopefully won't have to leave at 6am to catch a flight!). Thanks! "
3657819,20397727,2014-09-28,21722511,Donald,"Maria was welcoming and enthusiastic about our visit.  We never met but she made sure my daughter and I found our way and had everything we needed.  The house is in a quiet, charming Ballard neighborhood, good for a restful sleep.  A separate entrance and kitchenette make it perfect for visitors looking for something homey but private.  "
3657819,20424809,2014-09-29,19682623,Erica,"Maria was a wonderful host! She provided wonderful touches such as a bottle of wine and homemade bread that made our stay even more memorable. She had amazing communication, which made settling in very easy and stress free. The neighborhood was very quiet and absolutely charming. The rental itself was clean, cute, incredibly comfortable and exactly what I envisioned. I would not hesitate to recommend this rental, and if I am ever in need of a place to stay in Ballard, I would rent from Maria again.  "
3657819,20591635,2014-10-01,7147644,David,"Staying with Maria has been the ultimately positive AirBNB experience: Easy communication, extremely cozy and perfectly clean rooms and Maria has been more than the perfect host. Before we arrived she let us know that she had baked and had left some for us in the fridge. Special requests from our side were no problem at all and throughout the whole experience we just felt ... happy! Would stay with Maria again in a heartbeat!"
3657819,20968160,2014-10-08,12425907,Jaclynn,"I had a wonderful experience w/ Maria. She was extremely welcoming and really went above and beyond. She left snacks and wine, water bottles, and even fresh cut flowers. 

The apartment was very charming and in a lovely neighborhood. It was very clean and roomy. I will absolutely stay w/ Maria the next time I'm in Seattle. She was wonderful and the accomodations were great. "
3657819,21606152,2014-10-20,21709504,Sun-Li,"I stayed here for one night and what a wonderful night it was. Maria left me clear instructions on how to get in and out of the apartment which were very easy to follow.

Upon arrival into the apartment, my girlfriend and I were greeted with a plethora of goodies from a jar of M&Ms, a bottle of wine, yogurt, oatmeal, water, and a Keurig for coffee. In addition was a list of all the local restaurants in downtown. We ended up going to the Bastille, which was delicious.

The apartment was spacious enough with 1 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 meditation room and the half-kitchen downstairs. The only con I would say is that the ceilings are rather low, so anyone 6 foot or over might have to hunch down going through doorways, but that didn't affect me too much.

Also, the area is very safe and welcoming. My girlfriend and I went for an enjoyable night run to Golden Gardens Park.

Maria and her husband even left us a couple bikes to use upon request. We didn't end up using them, but it was very thoughtful nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend it to anyone else wanting to stay in the Ballard area."
3657819,22184313,2014-11-01,7536662,Sue,Maria made us feel welcome with informative preliminary emails with directions and a personal note and convenient snacks upon arrival.
3657819,22348836,2014-11-03,23163395,Yianna,"My husband and I had a great stay in Ballard.   Maria was wonderful, she even left a bottle of wine :)   I would definitely stay again! "
3657819,22595927,2014-11-10,861495,Shannon,Maria was great!  We had snacks and wine waiting upon arrival and the apartment was very clean.  She was very sweet and accommodating - very easy to work with!  Great location for those looking for a getaway in Ballard!  Beautiful views from the dressing room! 
3657819,24016599,2014-12-16,22533350,Wendell,"Maria was wonderful. We needed a place at the last minute and she communicated with us immediately and consistently. The place was very neat and tidy and the blueberry bread, well what we didn't finish I took home. The main bedroom is upstairs and very conducive to just staying in bed and chatting with the sun streaming in. Thanks for a fine time."
3657819,24791547,2015-01-02,204972,Patricia,Maria was a thoughtful and caring host. She went above and beyond in making sure we got in safely and even baked us a delicious homemade cranberry loaf. Her place was a welcoming and warm haven. 
3657819,25569596,2015-01-19,4624527,Todd,Maria was an incredibly generous host. She was very quick to respond and personalized our experience for us. Her home is beautiful and is very cozy. I would highly recommend anyone stay here!
3657819,26399460,2015-02-11,10909068,Rita,"Maria is a welcoming and responsive host.  Breakfasts, fruit, snacks and drinks (coffee, tea, water and wine!) were provided.  The apartment was as described on the Airbnb site.  Maria is a very warm and helpful host.  I would definitely consider a return visit!"
3657819,27678803,2015-03-09,28122125,Joanne,"Maria was an incredibly welcoming host!  Her place was extremely clean & comfortable and more space than I needed for my several night stay.  There were fresh flowers, fresh fruit, a bottle of wine, a Keurig with coffee and tea, fresh blueberry bread plus yogurt & juice in the fridge.  Everything I needed to get going in the morning!  
Maria was also helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions to where I needed to go.
This was my first experience with Air BnB and it definitely exceeded my expectations."
3657819,28046442,2015-03-16,22351502,Kristin,"We had a fantastic time at Maria's place in Seattle.  Maria is lovely, welcoming, and helpful.  The space is warm and cozy, and the bed is very comfortable.  The location is great - 15 minute walk to Ballard downtown and close to buses. Would definitely stay there again! "
3657819,28960481,2015-04-01,15777468,John,the Host was very nice. Welcomed us with a bottle of wine and some fruit. It is an up stairs property enter from the side of the house. All new inside with nice charm. 
3657819,31353599,2015-05-04,13583966,Kathryn,"Fantastic location, gracious host, plenty of amenities and special greeting gifts. We'll definitely stay here again and highly recommend."
3657819,32026837,2015-05-12,713756,Nicole & Damen,"The space was cozy and well appointed, they even left treats for us! We had a great stay, and would recommend the space, but i should point out that the ceiling in the bathroom was a bit low for a man over 6 feet tall... "
3657819,32591809,2015-05-19,2252332,Sue,"Maria made us feel so welcome, with communication and pics beforehand about getting in, presents like chocolate and wine and coffee (totally awesome and unexpected!), a handwritten note with the wifi info, and checking in on us to make sure we had everything we needed. The listing was exactly as posted, we were very comfy in the place, the garden was adorable, the neighborhood is cozy and convenient to Ballard... everything was perfect! Can't say enough good things about staying here!"
3657819,33363517,2015-05-27,29581451,Joanne,"Very enjoyable. water, fruits and coffee was available."
3657819,34448555,2015-06-08,3630755,Bethany,"Maria was a wonderful host.  Her accommodations were clean and cozy, inside and out.  It had an old cottage feel and was quite peaceful.  The neighborhood was quiet and located across from a park with a walking path.   My partner was reluctant to try Air BNB and he was quite impressed.   He said that he felt that Maria's place was warm and comfortable, and he stated that he would definitely like to return when we are next in Seattle.  
Maria checked in by text while we were there to make sure that the accommodations were suitable and that we had everything we needed.  Her instructions related to directions and accommodations were specific and accurate, which I appreciated.  She left a binder with maps and area activities/restaurants which we found helpful. I was quite impressed and pleased and I look forward to returning.    "
3657819,35087361,2015-06-15,79605,Rachel And Graig,"What can I say....Maria is a super host.  As an Airbnb hostess myself, she is what I strive to be! 

Maria is incredibly welcoming and optimized every aspect of our stay.   The house was beautiful and cosy with comfortable beds.  We were greeted with a bottle of wine and chocolates.  And she made up an extra bed for my sister when she needed a last minute place to stay.   The fridge was stocked with fresh fruit plus yogurt & juice.  We never went out for breakfast! And you have your own private garden to enjoy your breakfast.  Maria texted us halfway through our stay to let us know that she had made us a delicious loaf of pumpkin and cranberry bread.  
The house is about a 10 min walk or quick drive to Ballard which is a really fun neighborhood - bars, thrift stores, and more. Check out Porkchop and Co.  Delicious! 
This was my best experience with Airbnb thanks to Maria's hostessing skills."
3657819,35565174,2015-06-20,29754321,Allison,"Maria was very helpful during my stay.  Provided some breakfast items and bottled water.  Microwave and mini fridge available for use.  There are two rooms upstairs to use, so plenty of space; but fully private.  Maria leaves plenty of guidebooks and has plenty of suggestions for things to do in the city and around ballard.  Just about a mile walk to the main streets in ballard.  Would recommend to anyone, and would recommend to rent a car while in Seattle.  "
3657819,39747801,2015-07-26,31484828,Jodi,"As everyone seems to agree Maria is an excellent host!  She made up an extra bed for me and my husband when we came to drop off our 20 year old daughter for her summer internship in Seattle.  She had the fridge stocked with all her favorite things including diet coke.  She made sure that we understood how to get into town ( a lovely 10 min. walk from her house) , how to get to her internship, the best restaurants, and explained bus routes.  

She went above and beyond what a host is supposed to do and if I lived in Seattle I know we would be friends.  She made my daughter feel safe and looked after her for five weeks including taking her grocery shopping and making sure she was ok when she didn’t feel well.  On a particularly hot night- Maria put an air conditioning unit in my daughters room.  She is an excellent communicator and we texted throughout my daughters stay.  

Her home is in a very safe neighborhood and Ballard is a great town with a movie theater, many restaurants and shops, a few gyms , coffee shops and plenty of charm. 

The space is clean , private,  and it actually nicer in person than in the pictures.  

What a great experience! 
"
3657819,40906693,2015-08-03,20093373,Jane,"Maria was an amazing host. Everything was set up so nicely at her house, and she left us a wonderful spread of yogurts, juice, water, coffee and much more. She made us feel so welcome there, and  even though we were technically in her house, the whole experience was very private with a separate entrance and living quarters. The place was clean, spacious and decorated beautifully. Our best Airbnb experience yet!"
3657819,41597000,2015-08-08,31828253,Liz,"My husband and I stayed at this beautiful, quaint residence for 3 nights and had a wonderful experience. This was our first Air BNB experience and without doubt,  we were impressed. Maria and her husband were great hosts, providing us with a high level of comfort before arriving. The house was cosy, fresh, and provided the right amount of space for the two of us. The best part of this summer visit was the bit of outdoor space to enjoy our morning coffee and cocktail hour in the afternoon. I would absolutely stay here again. "
3657819,41817084,2015-08-09,11005411,Tara,"Maria was beyond considerate. She was accommodating and quick to offer recommendations. I enjoyed feeling at home because she had a variety of goodies stocked for us and checked in with us, in the sweetest way. 

The place was clean and cozy! I love staying at a place that I can tell is cared for. "
3657819,42275032,2015-08-12,4920683,Franciska,"we had such a great time at marias place. it is really beautiful, supercomfy, spotlessly clean, green and yet only a 10 minutes drive from downtown. ballard has its own nice and special atmosphere and even a small beach nearby.
maria was so sweet and helped me so much when my baggage went missing on the flight to seattle. moreover she stocked the fridge with tasty joghurt, juice and water and treated us with a bottle of wine which we enjoyed very much sitting out in the small garden.
i can only recommend marias home to everybody.
maria, thank you again for everything! franciska and lukas"
3657819,43764360,2015-08-22,34587974,Lacy,We had such a lovely stay in Ballard.  This was our first Airbnb experience and it was just perfect!  Maria was a wonderful host and left lots of treats for us to snack on and even a fancy beer in the fridge for my husbands birthday.  The accommodations were perfect and even better than we expected.  Super comfy bed and great location close to everything.  Maria  even left us bikes to ride which was great because we didn't rent a car and got around just fine on bikes and bus.    I would highly recommend staying here and really enjoyed my time.  Maria is just lovely and very thoughtful and I'm sure we would be friends if I lived in Seattle.
3657819,45371730,2015-09-02,4133925,Dawne,This is the perfect place to stay for exploring Ballard and the rest of Seattle. Cute and comfy. Maria makes you feel right at home.
3657819,45942585,2015-09-07,1905087,Constanza,María is a wonderful host and I would gladly stay at her place  if I come back to Seattle. 
3657819,46627755,2015-09-12,41588963,David,"This was my first AirBNB experience and Maria made it absolutely wonderful.  Her home was exactly as described and in the pictures...very clean and comfortable.  It is also in a very safe area with plenty of street parking.  She had water, juice, yogurt, coffee, and other treats available to us upon arriving.  She recommended and even provided books/magazines for places to see and check out in Ballard/Bellevue/Seattle.  She is just an amazing host!  I would definitely recommend her and I would definitely book my next stay with her in Seattle.  Thank you again Maria!  "
3657819,47718169,2015-09-21,39070543,Jennifer,"Maria was a wonderful host! The space was exactly as described, with lots of light available in the front reading room and bedroom.  Its in a quiet residential neighborhood with a great park across the street, walking distance to Old Ballard, and within an easy drive to key Seattle sites.   We did not have much time for sightseeing during our visit, but Maria provides a lot of great material for anyone who wanted to know what to do in the city and lots of special treats for her guests - we were even greeted with chocolates, nuts, wine, and other goodies! Another key feature of our stay was the fact that Maria was very accommodating and helpful; she was in contact with us the day we arrived, responded quickly to our text messages, and she even offered her iron and ironing board without us asking (as we were attending a wedding that first night).  One warning, though, is that the bathroom has a low ceiling - which was not a problem for me - but may be a bit close for anyone 6' plus."
3657819,49440902,2015-10-04,28739028,Katharine,"Wonderful stay in Ballard! We never got the chance to meet Maria as we were on the go, but she was absolutely lovely to communicate with and the space was perfect for us (plus she had stocked the fridge!)!! Would highly recommend!"
3657819,50545969,2015-10-12,9690288,Roxanne,"Maria was incredibly accommodating and thoughtful. She was also very detailed, which I appreciate! The space was clean, cozy, and as expected. I would absolutely recommend Maria's place to anyone who's looking for a place to stay in Ballard!"
3657819,51443004,2015-10-20,3619452,Myrna,Maria was kind and thoughtful. She baked us some pumpkin bread and left us snacks and beverages. Her place is clean and located in a great neighborhood.
3657819,53630785,2015-11-10,47133770,Corey,"Maria was a fantastic host. She made us feel welcome in a new city and even left us snacks, water and home made pumpkin bread. Her home was cozy and exactly as described. It was in a nice, safe neighborhood with easy parking and I felt very much at home. My wife and I were so busy we ended up not actually meeting Maria in person, unfortunately, but my interactions with her over the phone were extremely pleasant. She was helpful and proactive about making sure we were having a great time. Her home is in the perfect part of Seattle and it took only a few minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go. If you are looking for a place to stay in Seattle, Maria has it! "
3657819,54055393,2015-11-15,28194509,Kristin,"Maria was an incredible host. She was very available for all our needs and, as others have mentioned, baked delicious pumpkin bread as well as stocking drinks and a few snacks, including some delicious local chocolate. Such a sweet surprise. 

The place was as described! It's very charming and perfectly located to get anywhere in Ballard in a few minutes. The kitchenette is downstairs where you enter, and then indoor stairs lead up to a hallway with two bedrooms and a bathroom, with one of these bedrooms set up as a cozy sitting room with beautiful windows and neighborhood views. The ceilings and doorframes are quite low upstairs, just be aware that if you're six feet like my husband you'll duck a bit through the doorways!

The bed and couch were super comfy and Maria provided a few lovely toiletries as well. The park across the street is absolutely gorgeous. We hope to stay here again!"
3657819,54714401,2015-11-23,18706199,Nina,"Fantastic experience staying at maria's, very well looked after and had everything I needed. Would recommend! "
8653722,50241616,2015-10-10,33521580,Destiny Ashley,This was a pleasant and cozy experience. I really enjoyed my stay. I couldnt imagine a better place.
8653722,51208043,2015-10-18,1653276,Josh,"This was the perfect little studio to stay at while our house was under renovation.  It has a nicely appointed kitchen with everything you would need to make a home-cooked meal.  The bathroom was spacious and the entire place was quite clean.  It is in a nice neighborhood in North Seattle, and if you don't need to be right near downtown it is a perfect alternative to a hotel room.  An added bonus is that it is pet friendly (and there are even chickens in the backyard!). Leif was a great communicator and was flexible with checkin/checkout times.  I ride a motorcycle and he offered to let me park it in his private driveway next to his bike and provided a block to put the kickstand on.  Overall, great experience."
8653722,51582903,2015-10-21,46418890,Pam,"Leif & Dani were great hosts.  They provided towels for our dog's paws. The studio is well appointed with a comfy bed and clean bathroom. The backyard is great and the deck  was nice to sit on and enjoy the evening.
The neighbor is laid back with a park close by, grocery just down the road and lots of places to eat and drink within 5 minute drive.
Great little jewel just outside the city!"
8653722,55659018,2015-12-04,31936248,Nancy,"Leif is a fantastic host, attends to any needs, questions or issues very quickly, really goes out of his way. This unit is so homey and comfortable and especially great if you like to cook. Pretty view into backyard, quiet peaceful neighborhood with walkable access to transit and stores. Thank you for making my introduction to Seattle so wonderful!"
8653722,56187166,2015-12-10,46732652,Kathleen,"Greenwood Garden Studio was very comfortable and exactly as represented in the listing.  While, unfortunately, we did not meet our hosts in person, they were available via text/phone and responded very quickly. Location is quiet and in a great Greenwood neighborhood."
7050204,39974864,2015-07-27,27190754,Robin,"Before we even arrived at our apt, Andy sent us a comprehensive visitors'  guide that he and his wife had put together.  It was full of helpful information, both about the apt and how to enjoy Seattle.  The first thing we saw upon our arrival was a welcoming bottle of wine.  The apt was perfect for our needs.  Very comfortable and clean.  The neighborhood was quiet and residential, but just a couple of blocks from a commercial district with several excellent restaurants.  Although we had our car, I noticed public transportation very close by."
7050204,41015713,2015-08-03,37025202,Celia,"Andy welcomed us to the flat with a lovely bottle of wine and popped by a little later to check everything was ok. Really helpful and always on the end of the phone if we needed anything. 
Quiet neighbourhood and nice location. Just round the corner from a few shops, cafes, bakery and restaurants. The flat is a decent size with a very comfy bed and nice living space. Andy mentioned he's about to do up the building so kitchen was a bit out of date but perfectly functional. Would recommend!
"
7050204,42557071,2015-08-14,37096272,Matthew,"We enjoyed our stay here. Andy was a wonderful host who made us feel very welcome and provided great information for our stay. The place itself was located in a wonderful part of town, close to buses, grocery stores and a few coffee shops. Location was important to us as we were traveling without a car and with a toddler!  It was also very quiet and family friendly. The apartment was nicely accommodated and we made quite a few meals at home. Being on the top floor the apartment can get very warm, thankfully Andy has provided an air conditioner to keep the living space cool. "
7050204,43168267,2015-08-17,23914859,Zach,Andy was a great host and the apartment was in wonderful condition. Andy communicated quickly and was very helpful throughout the stay. I would definitely stay at this location or another one of his locations next time I am in Seattle.
7050204,45414857,2015-09-02,41372544,Jessica,"My friend and I had a great stay at this location! Andy and his wife were very thorough and detailed with the pre-stay information. The house was very clean, spacious, and equipped with every thing we needed for a three day stay. They hosts were very gracious. They checked in on us a couple of times to make sure everything was going well with our stay and to make sure we didn't need anything. Although we didn't get to meet them in person, they were extremely thoughtful and wonderful hosts. They even left us a bottle of WA wine to welcome us to Seattle, which was a really nice touch. We could not have asked for a better stay and definitely recommend Andy and his wife as hosts! "
7050204,48142301,2015-09-23,540695,Talor,"we came for the rate, but we stayed for the hospitality and comfort. it is clear andy is out to be seattle's host of the year. he is friendly, accommodating and really knows his city. he has put together a manual that explains everything so you know how everything works before arrival and gives great recommendations for the best of seattle.

the apt was clean, spacious and comfortable. it is very well equipped and even came with a few treats. the location is fantastic. it's on a quiet street, but close to everything... bars, restaurants, shops, etc.

we had a lovely stay and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting seattle!"
7050204,49249588,2015-10-02,43436495,Brendan,"Andy made us feel very welcome. The accommodation was as described, comfortable, clean and very centrally located in a residential area but close enough to be able to walk to local restaurants and stores."
7050204,50584567,2015-10-12,33613212,Kd,"By far, this was the best AirBnb experience I've had! Andy replied to my messages within five minutes and was extremely helpful. The guidebook they provide is extremely convenient for knowing what to explore. I would stay with Andy and Lynne again in a heartbeat! He even upgraded my group to a larger apartment! The location is not far from downtown, about a 20-30 minute walk or a cheap Uber ride. The entire experience was amazing! Thank you very much for a wonderful weekend in the city! "
7050204,52117997,2015-10-26,18883151,Will,Andy was a great host!  Very accommodating from the day we made the reservation all the way through checking out.  A better unit was available the day we checked it and he offered to upgrade us which was very appreciated!  We even were welcomed with a bottle of wine and a bag of snacks.  I would stay in one of Andy's units again in a heartbeat. 
3757858,19784850,2014-09-18,20299346,Anniese,My stay at Andy's place was fantastic. He was incredibly knowledgeable and friendly and showed me around Seattle. I got to see a a side of the city that I wouldn't have seen ordinarily. His place was very clean and comfortable with all the facilities that you could need. My stay here made my trip to Seattle very memorable.
3757858,21648022,2014-10-20,16721146,Raquel,Andy is awesome! My sister and I stayed 2 nights and we all had so much fun. Andy was our tour guide and took us to some pretty cool places. His place is located in a popular and vibrant area with lots to see and do. His place is unique and comfortable with everything we needed. Thank you again Andy!
3757858,21695679,2014-10-21,16721146,Raquel,Decided to stay an extra night and had a blast! Andy has a cool place and is a great tour guide. 
3757858,28691801,2015-03-28,6387496,John,"Andy was super flexible at the last minute and very interesting. We had a great evening chatting about interesting stuff, but he would as well left me alone had I asked him too. Super comfy bed and an inviting and funky atmosphere!"
3757858,28713570,2015-03-29,14988886,Amy,"I stayed here with my boyfriend for comic-con weekend and we had an awesome experience. It's one of the best Airbnb places in Seattle. Andy went over the top in welcoming us to his creative and welcoming home. He was very communicative and responded quickly. We arrived a bit early and he was very accommodating in meeting us a different time to check in. 

Seeing his place was more awesome in real life than the photos. Every piece on the wall had an interesting story from his photography to the circuit boards. It is truly a geeks paradise! He offered many suggestions to places to go within walking distance in town for food and activities. He even offered to show us around town, such a generous guy!

What I love about his place is that it's within walk distance to downtown shops. No more circling for parking and paying high rates for parking garages around downtown. Area is perfectly located less than a mile from the convention center and on the way there it's surrounded by popular places for many dining options. Really it's the perfect place to stay while exploring Seattle. "
3757858,29704195,2015-04-11,23523327,Sum Fung,"This guy is insane! Andy is one of the coolest guy I've met!
It's so much fun to live in his place. Geeks paradise!!
Andy has brought so many cool places in Seattle. Had so many good meals. Most importantly, the Olympic National Park! What a wonderful wildlife experience!"
3757858,32103838,2015-05-14,25290919,Charlene And Antony,"My husband and I stayed with Andy for 3 nights during a trip from Canada through to California. Andy's home is as described and very cool. His bed is very comfy, I'm not sure how he gave it up for us to sleep in. Andy made us feel welcome from the start and went beyond what was expected by taking us out for a quick drink the first night and then for an evening out to bar the next night, followed by a drive around tour of some of Seattle's hotspots at night, which we really appreciated. We also got to meet his lovely girlfriend who was great too. Andy is located in a great location with great bars and restaurants nearby. Downtown Seattle is a short bus ride. We would definitely recommend Andy's place for other AirBnBers!! Thanks Andy."
3757858,33488843,2015-05-28,27580993,Richard,The host canceled this reservation 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3757858,34886192,2015-06-13,33994698,Cory,Andy's a very nice fellow and added a great local experience to my trip!
3757858,41999537,2015-08-10,7358818,Siobhán,Andy and his apartment are both amazing! We were so lucky to find this crazy gem in the middle of Seattle. My friend and I are both big geeks and were in awe of his place. The bed is also really comfortable!! Andy was so accommodating and met us really early for an unexpected early check in! I would love to come back to Seattle and spend more time with Andy :) Highly recommend this listing!
3757858,42995574,2015-08-16,41099446,Guy,"Andy was my first Airbnb host and he treated me like a friend of a trusted friend who would know what to expect, and he made sure I didn't have to ask for practically anything during my stay!  When I asked him shopping directions to buy a coat for the rain he loaned me one of his own instead.  (People in Seattle seem to have raincoats for any occasion - I was headed to a wedding!)  His place was spotless and exactly as I expected from the description and pictures - and full of character.  And his mattress - the thickest most comfortable memory foam mattress i think I've ever slept on ;)  He was even kind and flexible enough to let me store my luggage with him, and trusted me to return for it when he wasn't even home.  This was the easiest and most care-free lodging arrangement I have ever had.  Way to go Airbnb and Thank You Andy for a great first experience!"
3757858,45321953,2015-09-01,33821656,Frank,"Geeks Paradise was an amazing experience! Both the apartment and the location were exactly what I was looking for during my trip to Seattle. It had a great location from which I was able to explore a city I had zero knowledge or experience with upon arrival. Every morning I would walk out into the trendiest neighborhood in the town and onto whatever my destination of the day was by foot. The first day I did not even have to go far because the local area is easily recognizable as an upcoming place filled with great bars or restaurants to your hearts content. I spent most of my time wandering, but while at Andy's I was very comfortable. It's an unspeakably fun experience to realize the recognizably geeky and nerdy decor surrounding you which includes countless bits of literature and items I love to rant about; video games, monsters, etc. It was just awesome! Also, the bed is made of an unknown element called Comfortium. It's like sleeping on pure bliss. The only regret I have is that I did not meet Andy sooner than the planned last day I was there. He is a great guy! He is nice to the point that proceeding my travels it raised brows from a pessimistic New Yorker like myself. However, the second I met him, his friendly character was clearly genuine. Despite knowing he had to know me only for hours, Andy and his friend treated me to a last night out at a local and enjoyable place. He spotted me to a drink and a half over fantastic conversation. By the time the night was over I had forgotten I was dealing an individual I did business with and felt like I was truly among friends. "
3757858,48813585,2015-09-28,8760273,Manuel,"Andy's place is a dream for anybody visiting Seattle! Conveniently located, very clean and really cool! Andy is a great host and made our stay that  much better. He knows a lot about the city and surrounding areas and is always willing to answer any questions you might have."
3757858,50721421,2015-10-13,37503638,Louis,"Fun hosts, geeky apartment and a cool neighborhood close to Downtown Seattle. I had a great time."

Andy is awesome! Really friendly cool guy that is super chill. Loved his place, one of the most unique places you can stay. If you like the outdoors or geek stuff, this is a must stay."
8339580,50408994,2015-10-11,2674908,Ramona,This place was even nicer and more spacious than the photos implied. Brett was a wonderful host and responded quickly to a few questions we had in the evening. The whole experience was lovely. Great neighborhood! 
8339580,54249123,2015-11-17,46089648,Eric,"Perfect location, great price, and Brett was awesome to work with. "
8339580,55399165,2015-12-01,4438809,Mark,"great location with analog coffee a couple blocks away. also within walking distance from the main streets. brett, was accommodating, courteous and helpful in every way. i would definitely recommend staying at this property. we rented a car during our stay and didn't have trouble finding parking either- although, this may have been due to the fact that it was thanksgiving weekend and people were out of town. nevertheless, this property was perfect for the four of us. thanks again, brett!"
7826447,43590736,2015-08-20,9018211,Kyle,Nicely put together airbnb rental. Easy parking and good neighborhood. Responsive host with easy check in/out. Would definitely visit again!
7826447,45168596,2015-08-31,28005592,Allen,"The location is well placed near major freeways and place is well maintained by the owner, Brad.

Brad was quick to respond to any inquiries before, during, and after our trip. 

Just a note: the complex is a single home divided between three separate housing units. The doors connection the units are locked to prevent others from entering your unit."
7826447,55457498,2015-12-01,23301474,Jodi,We appreciated our stay here.
6516775,35948763,2015-06-23,34382772,Kristen,Charlie and Sarah were very welcoming and great hosts.  We loved their place in Fremont and enjoyed getting to be close to the action on Fremont Fair weekend! 
6516775,36297923,2015-06-27,34281570,Nicole,"We were greeted and welcomed to a beautiful garden level apartment. The owners were extremely kind and helpful with answering questions to us first time Seattle visitors! They immediately made us feel comfortable and excited. They encouraged us to reach out with questions and contact them if anything went wrong or we needed anything! 
The apt was close to many great coffee shops and right by many bus lines. Safe and beautiful neighborhood. Lots to do right in Fremont!
Upon departure they checked in to make sure we had a good stay and also contacted me that I had left my car keys at the place and made immediate arrangement to get them back to me! "
6516775,36805381,2015-07-01,11276271,Hilary,"I rented the garden apartment for my future in-laws so that they could have a comfortable place to stay in our neighborhood (we live in fremont) while they came to visit. The apartment is in an excellent location -- my fiance's parents didn't want to have to drive in the city and they absolutely didn't need to. It is walking distance to a ton of our favorite restaurants, bars and parks, as well as PCC (grocery store) where we met for breakfast a couple times (they've got a great hot bar!). 

Charlie called me two days in advance to make sure we knew how to get in to the apartment and to tell me when it would be cleaned and ready and answer any questions. Sarah also got on the phone to tell me where all the extra things like towels and soaps were and to see if we needed any tips for the neighborhood. They were very easy to get a hold of and communicate with and insisted we call if we needed anything (which we didn't!) My future in-laws said the home was ""well-stocked"" and especially nice for the hot days that they were here because it was nice and cool. "
6516775,49423621,2015-10-04,9730550,Rachael,Great location. Food and public transit within 2 blocks. Thank you Charlie and Sarah !  You're great people. 
6516775,50755135,2015-10-14,6661033,Hannah,"Apartment was as described. Not sure if this is important to those looking to stay here, but there is no TV, so I hope you spend most of your time exploring Seattle (like we did) or really enjoy the company of your travel partner (also true)!  The neighborhood is great! It was quiet and was a short walk away from everything: food at all times of day (Ha! was our favorite place to eat breakfast), a coffee shop, a small grocery store, bars, and the aspects and attractions that make Fremont unique! All in all, we enjoyed our stay and hope to return to Seattle some day! "
6516775,52842858,2015-11-02,7728802,Coby,"We had a lovely stay at Charlie and Sarah's- great location in upper Fremont, short walk to lower Fremont and the bar district, and nice modern furnishings and art on the walls. They were very easy to reach on text with any questions and we would definitely recommend staying there."
6516775,53595542,2015-11-10,8013942,Amy,"My husband and I visited Seattle to spend time with our son, and the apt. was within walking distance of his place,  as well as many great cafes, markets, the zoo, bus lines, etc.  The neighborhood is fantastic.  Because the apt. is on the ground floor, it's a bit dark, but with so much to do, we were out and about most of the time.  Comfortable bed, great shower and most of the basics you'd need for breakfast, etc. in a fairly well stocked kitchen. Thanks, Charlie and Sarah."
6516775,54330288,2015-11-18,26370933,Lee,Charlie and Sarah's Apartment is well located and fully meets description provided. Charlie was very prompt in responding to all questions.
6516775,55371102,2015-12-01,19124154,Brian,"I rented Charlie & Sarah's place for my parents who were coming to Seattle from Ireland to visit our new daughter (and their 12th grandchild). The spot was great! My parents loved the feel of the place and it was easy walking distance to thing s to do in upper Fremont and close enough to Fremont ""proper"" that they walked down multiple times. 

They weren't interested in exploring Seattle much as they were here to play with their new grand daughter but living in the neighborhood I know it's a 1 block walk to the no. 5 bus which heads right downtown. "
6516775,57652121,2015-12-28,38552868,Michele,"Charlie and I were in touch by e-mail - he was very welcoming and helpful. The apartment is very nice and clean - I felt very comfortable and safe. Since my daughter lives nearby, I didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment and I only used the coffee maker - did not cook, but the kitchen had everything one would require. Very comfortable bed, nice bedding, plenty of towels. The neighborhood is very quiet and very nice - always felt safe. Coffee shops, grocery stores and other shops very close by. Used public transportation - very easy and convenient!
I would definitely recommend Charlie and Sarah's garden apartment to anyone traveling to Seattle.

2481869,12400117,2014-05-01,12988822,Norah,Nicely furnished and in a great location.
2481869,12854334,2014-05-12,3666930,Alexa,"Andrea was more than helpful and gracious! The cottage is beautiful and in the best location of Queen Anne. I would live here if I could! Extremely quiet, safe, and close to everything including a bus stop 1/2 block away that takes your right downtown. I can not say enough nice things about Andrea, Greg, and the cottage! I recommend it to all! You will want to stay longer! I booked a week and ended up stay for two!"
2481869,13053553,2014-05-18,3666930,Alexa,Perfect apt in Queen Anne! Location is A+ and in a very quiet area! Very bright and airy like the description! I recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing place to stay after a busy day!
2481869,13272379,2014-05-24,7881424,Felice,"Lovely bright apartment! Very responsive hosts. Great area, blocks to great restaurants. Would definitely recommend this apt. "
2481869,13856608,2014-06-06,15648636,Jenny,"A lovely space to stay in!  Clean, comfortable, and in a great neighborhood.  Andrea was most helpful and responsive.  We will definitely return."
2481869,14209304,2014-06-14,2458698,Rachel,"Andrea was super responsive and easy going.  I would stay at her place again in a heartbeat.  

The apartment was pristine, in a really lovely, quiet Seattle neighborhood.  I had business downtown but was traveling with my almost four year old and my mother. I was able to get to work easily using public transit.  They took great advantage of the two playgrounds and also used public transit to reach the Seattle children's museum.    There's a grocery store and a really nice bakery half a block away.  More stores, restaurants, etc. on Queen Ann Street an easy walk away.
"
2481869,14560027,2014-06-22,14739022,Jiin,"I have not got to personally meet Andrea but she was really nice and willing to help if I needed anything. 
Everything was set clearly so there was no need to ask for anything extra as well.
The place itself was quiet, clean, got everything we needed and had very easy access to everywhere also.
My family loved staying at the cottage!"
2481869,16704466,2014-08-01,13702662,Cindy,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay in your lovely carriage house. The cottage was very clean, easy to keep that way, quiet and the location unbeatable! We stayed there for a month and it worked out great! I would recommend it to anyone! Queen Anne is very charming and easy to get around. Walking is perfect. "
2481869,17044479,2014-08-06,15895015,Sarah,"Great location, great open space for two to four people. Host was attentive and prompt with responses and very flexible with our flight schedule. Loved the neighborhood as well. Will be back to Queen Anne as soon as possible."
2481869,17502523,2014-08-13,2189188,Heath,"Andrea was helpful and totally attentive, and her caretaker Greg was equally helpful.  While I never spent much time in Seattle when I lived there 2 years ago, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed the neighborhood.   Located close to Queen Anne Avenue's northern retail corridor, the restaurant, coffee shop, and other amenity selection was wonderful, even if you only wish to grab a quick coffee or a muffin from the local Macrina Bakery chain."
2481869,19403385,2014-09-12,13343874,Roseann,"We loved this delightful apartment! Bright, airy (as described) and just the perfect space for a couple and maybe a guest or two for a few nights.

Andrea and Greg made sure our month-long stay was pleasant and comfortable. Plenty of linens and kitchen necessities were provided to make our time there easy and really carefree.  And the parking ... wow, guaranteed free parking in Seattle?  A HUGE plus. :)

We would definitely book here again for an extended stay.  Thanks, Andrea and Greg, for a delightful place to stay."
2481869,20145814,2014-09-24,1426300,Kasey,"My husband and I had an incredible time at Andrea's lovely carriage house! The space was lovely, clean, very open, and well appointed with modern furniture. The location is FANTASTIC! It is incredibly close to Macrina Bakery as well as a myriad of other coffeeshops, restaurants, and even a Trader Joes. We can't recommend this sweet carriage house enough! As if all of that wasn't enough, Andrea was a dream to coordinate with - very prompt, kind, and informative. We hope we have the chance to stay here again!"
2481869,20448115,2014-09-29,17126844,Karen,"We had a wonderful stay at Andreas place. It was very cute and clean. We had everything we needed. We absolutely loved Macrina bakery which is right down the street and was a recommendation from Andrea! Although we didn't get to meet her, the property manager, Greg, was available for any of our questions, or needs. I would definitely stay here again!

Karen Hobbs"
2481869,21954613,2014-10-27,1584534,Erin,I had a great experience staying at Andrea's. Everything was very clean and super-comfortable. Andrea was very responsive to any questions I had and always accommodating. The location was quiet and in a lovely part of Seattle. Highly recommend!!
2481869,23389012,2014-11-30,9236155,Robert,"Andrea is very prompt when making the arrangements and also helpful.  The place is immaculate, equipped with everything we needed.  Receiving new pillows and taking home the ones you use is an attractive incitement we think.  Thanks for the lovely stay.  We'd Bob and Olivia"
2481869,23794945,2014-12-10,9660891,Jenelle,"What a beautiful cottage!! It was very cute, clean, and in a great location... Queen Anne. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, cafes, and bakeries. Almost all the convenience of home was there. The only small issues we had were that there was no way to control the temp (heat) in the bedroom. But Greg was nice enough to bring over a small heater. Also, having a few kitchen items like sugar or creamer for coffee in the morning would be a nice touch. Lastly, there's a television but only Netflix/Amazon prime, no basic cable or satellite. I felt a little out of touch without regular TV. Other than that the place is amazing! I would stay again!"
2481869,24486009,2014-12-29,21146419,Sandy,"Our stay was great!  Greg was prompt and helpful when we called. The cottage was clean, well maintained and appeared as the photos showed.  The Queen Anne area was great with near by cafes and shops to browse. We were happy with our experience."
2481869,34154009,2015-06-05,994595,James,"I love this space! Bright, airy with good ventilation and beautifully furnished. And the neighborhood is fantastic with big leafy trees, great homes and easy walking distance to lots of nice stuff. Andrea was very welcoming and provided all the information needed for me to have a comfortable, hassle-free stay. I would happily stay there again."
2481869,34353180,2015-06-07,34291431,Matthew,"Below are three reasons I recommend you stay at Andrea's lovely cottage:

1. Location. It's located in the beautiful Queen Anne neighborhood among nicely kept homes and friendly people. It's close to several cafes and restaurants and has plenty of street parking. It's also only a ~$12 Uber ride to downtown Seattle.

2. Cottage. It's brand new inside, tastefully decorated with new furnishings, I found the bed to be quite comfortable, the kitchen had everything we needed and it has a washer and dryer. The price we paid was less than the per night rate of most hotels that weekend, so the fact that it felt like home was relaxing and relieving.

3. Host. Andrea made me feel welcome and assured that I would have a good experience. 

I did have a good experience here. Skip the hotels because this is better!
"
2481869,35538611,2015-06-20,27291998,Ted,"My family and I really enjoyed the visit to this cottage. Everything was there as described, and Andrea has been extremely helpful before/during the visit. It is located in very nice neighborhood, and parks that have amazing views are within 10 minute drive. I would suggest this place to anyone who would like to explore Seattle!"
2481869,35909846,2015-06-23,28899983,Bethan,"The cottage provided everything we needed for our stay. The neighbourhood was very nice, with all the essentials. It was about a half hour walk into town, or there are plenty of buses - we tended to walk into town, and then catch the bus up the hill. We definitely enjoyed the netflix! We used the sofabed to sleep on, and it was comfortable enough."
2481869,36652241,2015-06-30,9918937,Michael,"We stayed at Andrea's smartly renovated and appointed flat for three days and had a very enjoyable experience all around. You will not find a more accommodating host. Hilton should communicate with her to better understand how to make people feel welcome. We arrived and were greeted with her personal insights on how to fully enjoy the apartment and not miss the sweet spots dotted throughout the neighborhood. We were able to acclimate very quickly to things and get right into Seattle exploration which was everything we anticipated and more. The apartment is very nice, spacious, clean, light and airy, and strategic to everything we wished to see. Frankly, this is what airbnb is all about and Andrea gets it and that makes travel like this fun. The apartment is 30 steps from a very cool market and an exceptional bakery/cafe. We walked everywhere from this central Queen Ann location and explored more in three days than we thought possible. If you want to see Seattle, try to get time with Andrea - but don't leave the schedule open for us - we plan to be returning. BTW, the people we met in Seattle were great too. A memorable trip to be sure..."
2481869,37489029,2015-07-07,9893343,Travis,"The Cottage is exactly as pictured! Bright, comfortable, and extremely clean.  Andrea went above and beyond to ensure we felt comfortable and could focus on enjoying Seattle. Queen Anne offers great views of the skyline. We felt right at home and would highly recommend Andrea and her superb airbnb. "
2481869,38309968,2015-07-14,35791873,Wouter,The house was very clean and well located in a quiet neighbourhoud. The distance to the city center is easily bridged by Seattle's impecable transportation system. Excellent address that I warmly recommend.
2481869,39594790,2015-07-25,11867829,Noah & Katherine,"Andrea is a wonderful host. We stayed with her in Queen Anne for the full summer in 2014 and loved both the neighborhood and the accommodations so much that we chose to return for transitional housing during our permanent move to the area this year. Greg and Andrea responded quickly to our every need, and Andrea feels almost like a friend! We would absolutely recommend this listing -- clean, safe, and a fantastic location on a tree lined street within easy walking distance of mountain and Puget Sound views -- plus the proximity to beloved Macrina bakery doesn't hurt!"
2481869,40106386,2015-07-28,23188416,Gail,"This was the first time for my family in Seattle. We enjoyed the city enormously.  We are also quite lucky with amazing weather.  Andrea's place is fabulous. It is comfortable, clean, and amazingly convenient from a location perspective. If you plan a trip to Seattle, particularly if it is for tourism, you cannot go wrong staying at Andrea's place in Queen Anne. "
