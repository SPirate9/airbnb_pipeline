3345341,20792848,2014-10-05,7433923,Baranna,"Nice apartment in a great neighborhood for getting around anywhere downtown A short walk to the Link rail for easy access to and from the airport and to Pioneer Square and Chinatown. Walking distance to Pike Place Market, great restaurants and excellent shopping. I even walked up to Capital Hill. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a comfortable, affordable place to stay downtown."
3345341,21308401,2014-10-14,6758495,Christoph,"Amy's apartment is awesome.10 min walk to pike place market.
The bed is super-comfortable. Would definitely go book her place again."
3345341,21537257,2014-10-19,21859257,Peter,"Great place.  It was an easy walk to downtown.  Pike's Place Market was a quick walk away.  We took the Link train from the airport and the location was conveniently located by the train station. 

If you want to save money by cooking on your own, Amy's place is an awesome stay.  She even had some basic food available for us. 

The place was clean.

One note:  Her description about getting around indicated that there was an UNLIMITED transit card.  I saw that in the description and contacted her housekeeper.  Unfortunately there wasn't one.  I will advise her to update her description.  We didn't even need the transit card as we walked around everywhere.

Overall awesome experience. "
3345341,21962572,2014-10-27,13676458,Lalita,"The apartment is beautiful and clean! Key pick up and drop off was super convenient. Most places are walking distance, which is very convenient as well. Thanks Amy! :) "
3345341,22310611,2014-11-03,5881559,Gabe,"I absolutely loved this place! The condo is exactly what you see in the photo: clean, neat and very modern. The condo is conveniently located at the center of pretty much everything. You can walk to the waterfront within 10 minutes, and the Space Needle was very close too. I did not meet Amy; however, I did meet the individual that assisted Amy with the condo and picked up the keys from her. They were very easy to get a hold of, hassle free and nice. I would highly recommend Amy’s place if you are visiting Seattle. "
3345341,22535799,2014-11-09,20076735,Jennifer,"Amy and her assistant Michelle were EXTREMELY responsive and helpful before and during our trip! The location of the apartment is excellent - close to the light rail if you are coming from the airport. It's an easy walk everywhere else - Seattle Center, Capitol Hill and the Pike Place Market. Returning to the apartment after dark isn't a problem - the neighborhood is safe and quiet. It's mostly offices and hotels in the immediate area. 

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos. It was just two of us staying this trip, but the living room is generously sized and would easily accommodate the inflatable bed without feeling cramped. The bedroom is fine for two people.  "
3345341,22764582,2014-11-14,6945118,Lynn,"Amy's place was great!couldn't really get more central, the flat was clean with all amenities that you could need!check-in and check-out worked flawlessly (even accommodating my very late arrival around midnight).amy was very responsive.if i had to raise one negative point, it would be the internet connection that was a little flaky at times (i only mention this in case you need to rely on a high speed connection for work,for anything else it was perfectly fine). Definitely recommend!"
3345341,23125420,2014-11-23,23616360,Ramin,"Everything from prospecting to booking to checkout was a seamless and wonderful experience. Amy's assistant Michelle was in constant contact and made sure to check in with me throughout our stay to ensure our needs were met. 

The apartment itself was in a great location and easy access to many Seattle attractions. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others! 

The only minor issue is that the apartment shares its wifi with a market next door and the connection was spotty at times. Otherwise, highly enjoyable experience. Thank you Michelle and Amy!!!"
3345341,23327294,2014-11-29,22588434,Jocie,"Very great location. I could walk to most of the attractions within 15 minutes. It's also near many bus stations and light rail. The studio was cute and clean.The house keeper, Michelle, was very welcome and helpful. She gave me lots of suggestions before the visit. I forgot to take the keys and Michelle was so kind to drove to the studio at night. Sorry about that! Very great experience in Seattle!"
3345341,23630305,2014-12-07,7453832,Marissa,"Amy's apartment was fantastic.  The location is perfect - right in the middle of great shopping and restaurants, and a short walk from Pike Place and the waterfront.  The apartment is clean, spacious, and cozy, and the amenities were great.  Michelle was a great host, and check in was super easy. Thank you!"
3345341,23848881,2014-12-12,1499027,James,Had a wonderful stay @ Amy's. Likely one of the most comfortable beds I've slept on in a long time. Amy was super responsive the entire week. The apartment is as advertised and the location is ideal. Being able to walk to multiple bars and Tom Douglas restaurants is never a bad thing. I would definitely stay here again...
3345341,23935268,2014-12-14,2630230,Kim,We had an awesome stay here! Amy was able to accommodate our last minute request and the check-in went flawlessly. The space is as advertised and super cozy. Would highly recommend this spot and its vicinity to the sites. Thanks!
3345341,24114672,2014-12-20,21241684,Libin,The location is perfect! The apartment is clean and quite.
3345341,24487730,2014-12-29,2138346,Frances,"The location was great; walking distance to shops and restaurants and Pike Place Market. The place itself was clean and comfortable, albeit sparsely furnished - in particular it was missing a dining table which made eating there tricky. Also, being downtown there was some noise from outside but that was to be expected and nothing too loud. 

Overall we were happy with our stay in this apartment for our first visit to Seattle. "
3345341,24858734,2015-01-03,19840363,Gaby,The apartment was in a great location. We walked pretty much everywhere. The key exchange was easy and Michelle was very helpful. There were four of us staying here and although it was a little tight it was nothing that should be a deal breaker. The apartment was clean and there were clean towels and even basic toiletries available for use. The quiet hours didn't seem to apply to the whole building because there was a unit that literally had music going the entire 4 days and nights we were there. It didn't bother us much but if you are a extremely light sleeper this might be a problem. 
3345341,25915811,2015-01-29,26556507,Marie,"What we truly love about this appartment was the location. We could basically walk to anywhere in the city which was very practical for this first time in Seattle. Amy, our host was very amicable and getting access to the keys was very easy and fuss free. Ideal if you want to discover the city, get some groceries at the famous public market. No potato couch here (no tv) ! A very memorable stay in Seattle! "
3345341,26141936,2015-02-04,26513924,Shene,This place was great! Close to everything in seattle. Exploring was easy to do and it's walking distance from anything you want to do downtown. The light rail is easy to access and there are a lot of restaurants/shops to explore. I was intrigued by the different world maps and globes in the place. Plus no tv = more incentive to explore seattle.
3345341,26325960,2015-02-09,13229430,Patrick,We had a great time at Amy's place. Appreciate the great location and convenient set up. 
3345341,26534563,2015-02-15,15199522,Simon,"This place is great! The greatest thing about this apartment is the location. Walking distance to Pike Place and some bars in capitol hill (especially those on pine and pike street). My friends and I (4 of us total) stayed at Amy's place for a weekend. Everything is as advertised: One bed, one air mattress, and a sofa. Basic toiletries included. Check in and check out was really simple / hassle-free. There is no microwave in this apartment, which may be inconvenient for some travelers, but obviously not a deal breaker. Would highly recommend this place!"
3345341,28070972,2015-03-17,14909428,Mariana,"Pasamos unos días hermosos en el apto de Amy. Su asistente Michelle es muy amable y simpática. Gracias a su buena voluntad pudimos hacer el check in varias horas antes. La llave la dejaron en el market que está al lado. Y nos las entregaron muy amablemente. La ubicación del departamento es excelente. Es exactamente igual a la publicación, muy cómodo, limpio, todo funcionaba perfectamente; solo tuvimos problemas con el wifi. Totalmente recomendable. "
3345341,28253074,2015-03-21,26275351,June," I had a great time staying at Amy's. Her assistant Michelle was very welcoming and ready to help out if there was any concerns. The place was clean, cozy and had a hair dryer as well. Great location, too. I would stay at her place again if I go to Seattle."
3345341,28362735,2015-03-22,7813753,B,Amy's apartment was spotless and welcoming. Pike Place Market and downtown are so close! We walked from the apartment to Tula's Jazz Club in the evening for dinner and their show. The bed and queen air mattress were both comfortable and the standing fan provided the perfect amount of white noise for the inevitable nighttime sounds of the city. We had a great stay!
3345341,28513897,2015-03-25,25568475,Waylan,"Michelle (Amy's assistant) made us feel right at home the instant we got to the apartment. Although check-in time was at 6PM, she let us drop off our things early before heading out to explore the city. The apartment was quite nice and matched the description. It perfectly accommodated me and friends. The neighbor hood is within walking distance of Pikes Place Market & many other attractions in downtown Seattle. There's a convenience store right under the room just in case you need water or some snacks. The neighbors are also quite nice. Overall, very satisfied with our stay at the apartment! "
3345341,28698380,2015-03-29,9785400,Bobbie,"The apartment was OK but a little shabbier than I expected. I saw a sign that the building will be taken down so that a new building will be built, which may explain why. The housekeeper was helpful by phone when our flight was delayed. I had no problem getting the key even though we were late.  "
3345341,29475161,2015-04-07,12531810,Richard,"Amy's property was a lovely place to stay whilst we were in Seattle. She has provided all the necessary amenities within the apartment, the place was clean and spacious. 
Please be aware that if you are driving in to Seattle that there is no parking provided by the property so you'll have to find your own place to park. We were unfortunate and had our car broken in to whilst we were there so I can thoroughly recommend finding an internal car park rather than one of the exposed ones. 
Other than our bad luck with Seattle's crime we had a great time and Amy's place is perfectly situated for access to downtown. 
Thankyou Amy!!

3345341,29874011,2015-04-13,19416207,Alejandro,"Amy (Michelle) was always available, though nothing was ever asked. The place is really functional and pretty. If you are going to the Washington Convention Center, it doesn't get any better! The area is calm and quiet in the night and it's in the middle of three very different neighborhoods, so you have great options to choose.
"
3345341,30741492,2015-04-26,21767572,Michelle,"Great location! It was an easy walk to Pike Place Market, restaurants and shopping. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable. We enjoyed our stay! "
3345341,32089067,2015-05-13,9389159,Rob,"This is one of the best airbnb places I've ever stayed.  It was spotless and the location was excellent.  The apartment is exactly as pictured.  It's really comfortable!

Key pickup was easy, as was parking."
3345341,32610724,2015-05-19,32805536,John,"Amy's place is a great place to stay. We loved the bedroom and the overall decor. For parking, I didn't realize the place that I initially looked up (the one by the Olive) is closed during the weekends. We ended up parking by 5th and Virginia which was only $30 for 24 hours.

My only slight issue was that you do hear a lot of noise from the unit above. We couldn't sleep too much on the first night because of all the noise from the people walking back and forth."
3345341,32921567,2015-05-23,32801313,Nicole,"The apartment was exactly the way it was described - great location, easy to pick up the keys, and thoughtful touches throughout. Wonderful spot if you are looking to sight-see in Seattle!"
3345341,33169925,2015-05-25,33300443,Nikki,We really enjoyed our stay at Amy's place. Her house keeper was available and easy to coordinate with. We enjoyed the centralized location of the apartment. One thing I would add is that we had some trouble with the wifi connection throughout our stay. Other than that I thought it was a lovely place and a great location. 
3345341,33464613,2015-05-28,23273687,Eric,It was really wonderful! Everything was streamlined. Apartment was clean and nice. I would definitely stay here again. 
3345341,33703909,2015-05-31,29690306,Adriana,The place was very clean and everything was walking distance I love it !!
3345341,33946160,2015-06-02,1001726,Debra,"(Review by Malcolm) 

The apartment was a fine place to rest after a busy day at work. It's close to almost everything downtown and you can quickly get anywhere else you need to go on the bus or light rail. Didn't get a chance to use the kitchen as my stay was so short but it's definitely functional. The internet was OK but I had trouble reaching it from the bedroom in the back of the house."
3345341,34223707,2015-06-06,2834580,Kate,Amy's place is in an awesome location. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go and public transit was easily accessible. Key pickup was straightforward and Amy was a very accommodating host.
3345341,34648506,2015-06-10,15699374,Iulia,"Amy and her assistant Michelle were awesome!  Very helpful before and during our trip. The location of the apartment is excellent. It is close to the light rail if you are coming from the airport and close to the convention center. It's an easy walk everywhere else - Seattle Center, Capitol Hill and the Pike Place Market. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, and there are plenty of restaurants and markets to chose from if you want to grab something to eat. 

The apartment is just as it appears in the photos. It was just two of us staying so plenty of room. The shampoo, conditoner, body wash and blow dryer were awesome amenities! There are also lots of spices to use if you want to stay in and cook! "
3345341,35391264,2015-06-18,23080830,Guo,"It's such a nice place to stay!! It only takes about ten minutes for us to get to the Pike Place. Everything is around. It's not noisy at night, even its right by the street, which is better than we expected. It provides everything we need!! And Michelle is so nice!! We love you!"
3345341,35670894,2015-06-21,29544404,Ralph,"It was very pleasant experience. Her housekeeper, who managed logistics for Amy, was really friendly, flexible, and hospitable. "
3345341,36398410,2015-06-28,19697114,Danielle,Great location. Good host. Amy was very responsive to all questions. Walking distance to all the best of Seattle and public transit. 
7857241,47811310,2015-09-21,43465037,Alexandria,"This was my first experience with airbnb, and it was spectacular. I was slightly nervous, but as soon as I walked up to the house I felt at ease. Tommy & Elise's home is beautiful! Everything about it was perfect. They even left a cute note for us on their chalkboard, and wine among other goodies. They went above and beyond making our stay a great one. Plus, parking was super easy, which is not generally true in Seattle. Staying here made me want to become Tommy & Elise's friend and visit their brewery. What a great experience."
7857241,48743240,2015-09-28,27859738,Tom,"Tommy and Elise's home was absolutely beautiful. Within walking distance to several breweries, restaurants, and other attractions, we felt at home as soon as we arrived. I will definitely stay again the next time I'm in Seattle and am already excited for another visit! "
7857241,50564022,2015-10-12,45695832,Andres,"When the six of us step into the house, we were welcome to a beautiful chalk board message welcoming us with goodies to treat ourselves with. Tommy and Elise are a friendly bunch. Although we hardly saw them during our time in Seattle, they were extremely helpful and informative. 

The house is lovely to stay in and true to the pictures. The view from the balconies is nice with the added hot tub working as the icing on the cake. WiFi works great and the Roku TV is a nice way to relax from a long day of exploring.

Fremont is a super cool, safe neighborhood that this house is located at. The fact that I stop bothering to lock the door when we were out on our urban adventures and during the night just screams safe. This was to hard to believe at first since we always locked our doors in my hometown Houston. The neighborhood itself has fun little things to do and see that add to the whole Seattle experience.

The city is a short walk to the nearest bus stop to head into downtown, but be warned, the far is quite expensive for the convenience.

All in all, this is the place to stay if you want to be in Seattle without staying in Downtown.

Thank you Tommy and Elise for allowing us to stay in your home (:

7857241,55297375,2015-11-29,49660937,Pet,"Really cool house, great location and very welcoming hosts! Pictures don't do the views from the house justice, especially sun rise/sets over mountains. Nice neighborhood and an easy walk to central Fremont and lots of other cool places. House was both hip and fun for our 20 something guests and extremely baby friendly for us. Really was the best of everything. "
8870139,56889068,2015-12-19,20242776,Steph,LOVE The Carriage House!!! I can't wait to return to Seattle and stay here again. The place has so much character and charm. We were warm and cozy with the fireplace and had yummy French Press in the morning. It was nice to have a place to park our car. The shower was amazing. The list can go on and on. I recommend The Carriage house for sure!    
2935486,13297253,2014-05-24,975910,Joseph L,The condo was perfectly clean and accommodated. Perfect location.
2935486,13438741,2014-05-27,4283696,Brian,"Had a great time staying at Lc's apartment over Memorial Day weekend. It had great views and was right on the water. Walking distance to many restaurants and Pike Place Market, and very convenient to explore downtown Seattle.

The apartment is well-maintained and clean, and has all the amenities we were looking for.

Lastly, Lc was a great host. She responded timely to our questions, and was very accommodating."
2935486,13515384,2014-05-29,15152647,Hanna,"Lc was a great host, have us great advice on nearby restaurants. Her place is beautiful and very conveniently located right up the street from the market."
2935486,13830696,2014-06-05,1613229,Daniel,Great space and host.  Will definitely return when I'm in SEA.  Thanks!
2935486,14127263,2014-06-12,10055912,Derek,"Wonderful place, LC was fantastic! Location is stellar, right on the water by the Pike Place Market"
2935486,14283194,2014-06-16,14839888,Maryann,"We had an incredible time staying at Lc's beautiful condo. It was clean, wonderfully decorated, comfortable, and inviting. The waterfront view is breathtaking both day and & night. The location couldn't be better as it is a short walk to Pike's Market, restaurants, shopping, bars, and tourist attractions. We didn't move our car from the building's parking lot until we left... and having secure (and free!) parking was yet another added (website hidden) was incredibly accommodating and helpful. I wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Seattle, and look forward to several more visits to both Seattle & Lc's condo."
2935486,14519924,2014-06-21,15786363,Michael,"Lc had excellent instructions on finding and gaining access to her apartment She was also very responsive with any questions via text messaging. Her apartment is in a very nice location on the waterfront, near Pikes market and nice views of the harbor. The apartment was clean and very comfortable."
2935486,14614972,2014-06-23,240444,Tom,"We'd like to thank Lc for hosting our stay in Seattle. Her condo was perfect and exactly in the part of town we wanted to (website hidden) was very detailed on the check in procedures which made it easy and she even went out of her way to suggest places to eat. But above all, Lc was extremely accommodating and worked with us to make our weekend in Seattle (website hidden) is both professional and personable and has a lovely home. We would definitely contact Lc on our next Seattle visit. Mahalo Lc!"
2935486,14743589,2014-06-25,15692265,Joy,"Exactly as advertised. Beautifully equipped and clean. Location is perfect. Communication with LC was prompt and complete including all the instructions on how to access secure building and condo. Even though the condo is in the heart of the waterfront action, it was very quiet. It was a great visit and we would definitely stay with LC again. Highly recommend!"
2935486,14830218,2014-06-27,16330337,Eric,"Wow.  This was my first time trying airbnb and I could not have been happier with this (website hidden)'s accommodations are top-notch.  The apartment was spacious, clean, and had an excellent view of the water. The instructions given were clear and concise. 

Next time I'm in Seattle, I will hopefully be staying here."
2935486,14969857,2014-06-30,247914,Sarah,"LC's apartment was an amazing place to stay in Seattle. Super great location, within walking distance of so many great restaurants and bars in Belltown, Pike Place Market and downtown attractions. The apartment itself was nice and clean, very big and comfortable. It slept two couples very comfortably. The massage chair in the living room was an extra bonus. Checking in and out was super easy. The two included parking spaces were fantastic and saved us a lot of money on parking. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this place for a nice stay in Seattle."
2935486,15261515,2014-07-06,6965545,Vicky,Excellent location - very easy for getting around.  Spacious and clean apartment.

2935486,15818041,2014-07-16,6846224,Cindin,"Lc made us feel welcome from the very first contact through the entirety of our visit to Seattle.  Her condo is clean, quiet, and comfortable with all amenities (full kitchen, washer and dryer, etc.)  Lc was quick to respond to any and all requests for information and/or supplies, and even brought over a coffee maker when we asked for one.  The location of her condo is perfect!  Right on the waterfront with easy walking to ferries to Bremerton and Bainbridge Island, Victoria Clipper ferry to Victoria and other Alaskan cruises, Pike Street Market, Seattle Space Needle, Art Museums, and fabulous restaurants nearby.  The younger generation enjoyed working out in the gym, and we enjoyed roasting oysters on the grill on the outside patio. Great place!   Thanks for making us feel so very welcome Lc.   Cindin, Rob, Connor, and Sam.

2935486,15915853,2014-07-18,6096067,Lynda,"Very nice apartment that feels welcoming and (website hidden) has impeccable instructions to everything, including navigating the parking garage and access to apartment. 
Located with walking distance to Pike Market and right across street from the water. Also walking distance to waterfront restaurants and other downtown areas with shops/cafés/etc. Very clean upon arrival and Lc is great at quick communication and does not meet you upon arrival but checks in with you once settled, which I am sure some people would prefer. "
2935486,16065927,2014-07-21,4610050,Aaron,"LC's condo is perfectly situated right on the water. Great location for walking along the waterfront and also a very short walk to Pike Place market. The condo was clean, modern, and spacious. I would definitely recommend!"
2935486,16101836,2014-07-22,16006394,Michelle,Host was very accommodating. Thanks LC! I appreciated being able to store our bags after we checked out since our flight was later. Perfect location and beautiful apartment. We enjoyed cooking food from Pikes market (5 min walk). I especially liked the massage chair and being able to do a load of laundry. Can't wait to return and will definitely recommend to family and friends.
2935486,16208923,2014-07-23,16307600,Saagar,Amazing location and apartment. Would highly recommend!
2935486,16608044,2014-07-30,15286832,Barbara,"The condo was absolutely TOP DRAWER......location was super,within easy walking distance to lots of points of interest.  Very clean, well maintained, (website hidden) was a great host.   She even called me to advise about Seattle Torchlight Parade to caution us about traffic snarls, huge crowds, and fun.  I'd heartily recommend this listing to others.  There were 4 of us which worked perfectly with the 2 bedrooms/2 baths.  It was great to have a kitchen and lots of space to relax in.....loved the massage chair after hours of sightseeing......."
2935486,16675800,2014-07-31,17792666,Gavin,LC was a fantastic host. Her communication was prompt and detailed. Her place was in a perfect location for our family. Her place was very clean and well equipped. LOVED IT!
2935486,17146860,2014-08-08,6722932,April,"Wow! What can I say about Lc and her flat! It is located centrally downtown next to Pikes Place Market, and easily accessible! Lc is lovely and very prompt in returning texts with any questions that we had. Her flat is warm and inviting, beautifully decorated and had a lovely view of the bay.  My family had a great time here and I will DEFINITELY be staying here on future trips to Seattle. Thank you Lc! You are the perfect hostess!! "
2935486,17434691,2014-08-12,1298267,Allison,"Everything was just right! The view was great, the unit was perfect for 2 couples. It was close to everything first-timers to Seattle would want to do. 
Instructions were very detailed and easy to follow , even included photos where necessary--excellent idea!
Also, Lc is readily available and answers questions quickly. 
We would go back there again if we're ever in Seattle again! Thanks, Lc!"

2935486,17929913,2014-08-19,14167188,Jerry,"Our little group of 5 loved Lc’s flat- right on the waterfront, close walking to Pike Place Market + downtown; in a quiet, secure, luxurious building; clean, happy, upbeat furnishings; very affordable, given its Seattle location.  This is a nice place! We want to stay again in the future. Two (queen) bedrooms, a sofa convertible to a twin in living room; 2 full bathrooms; a nicely equipped kitchen. Didn't use the queen air-bed. Free secure parking for 2 cars, a massage chair (got plenty of use), free good quick WiFi, and the washer & dryer sealed the deal. Being a Nonsmoking flat was a definite plus. Is the whole building nonsmoking? Appreciated quick responses to my texts. Thanks for your hospitality,  Lc, we’d like to come back! Oh, this was our first airbnb experience, and it was a good one. "
2935486,18015591,2014-08-20,3610343,Tyson,"Lc was an excellent host and was consistently available to answer questions and help with the check in/out process.  Completely seamless.  I would definitely recommend the condo, both for the accomodations themselves and the experience we had with Lc.  "
2935486,18469031,2014-08-27,15294825,Miriam,Our stay couldn't have been better - the apartment was just as described and LC went out of her way to make sure that we felt welcome and understood the check-in process etc.  The location couldn't have been better - just a few minutes walk up the hill to Pike's Place Market and right on the water (perfect for morning runs!).  The apartment itself was spacious and clean and felt very safe.  We were attending a conference in Seattle and this was the perfect place to stay - only a 20 minute walk from the conference center and much nicer than a hotel.  This was our best experience with Airbnb so far - excellent host and beautiful apartment. 
2935486,18657472,2014-08-30,17576076,Ryan,Lc was an incredible host and was always available to answer questions and help with the check in/out process. Completely seamless. I would definitely recommend staying here because of the flawless condo and Lc's helpful responses and suggestions.  Thanks for everything Lc!

2935486,19031364,2014-09-05,5759741,Will,"This is a spectacular property.  Well appointed, thoughtful, comfortable and fresh.  The location is prime for easy pedestrian exploration of the city or for heading out by car.  Our hostess has clearly spent a good deal of thought and effort in providing an easy welcoming experience.  "
2935486,19209559,2014-09-08,19398784,Anastasia,"L.C's apartment is in a great location, right on the waterfront and just a short walk across the overpass to Pike Place Market. The apartment was clean, her check in directions clear (you could get lost without them) and the downtown Seattle carpark was an added bonus. Thanks for the stay L.C.!"
2935486,19373983,2014-09-11,19928579,Bente,"LC's condo is perfectly situated right on the water. Great location for walking along the waterfront and also a very short walk to Pike Place market. The condo was clean, modern, and spacious. I would definitely recommend and come again."
2935486,19669053,2014-09-16,15938170,Martin,The apt was in perfect location with balcony overlooking elliot bay; LC was exceptional host- responsive and very helpful.   will definitely come back to this apt.  Marty
2935486,19942306,2014-09-21,19866635,Bron,"LC is a great host with a a beautiful home, right in the heart of Seattle's downtown. We really enjoyed how close it was to Pike Place, the modern and classy decor, the information LC provided both before and during the stay and how easy it was to check in and out."
2935486,20081265,2014-09-23,15340084,Aleem,LC has a fantastic place in a fantastic location. From the moment we first spoke about the booking until I checked out she was nothing but friendly and helpful. The apartment was exactly as described and I would recommend this place to anyone travlelling to Seattle. Thanks again for everything and I will definitely be seeing you again.
2935486,20408616,2014-09-29,15876582,Marcia,LC made us feel very welcome.  Her condo is lovely & it's location is perfect.  It was our first time using Airbnb & was a very positive experience.  Thanks LC!
2935486,20562285,2014-10-01,1803042,Diane,"Excellent location. Great directions on how to get in, etc. Well equipped and very comfortable. We were there less than 24 hours but host was very accommodating and readily available by text during that time!"
2935486,20815400,2014-10-06,2529102,Daniel,LC's 2-Bedroom Downtown Seattle listing was everything and then some! The place was immaculately clean and provided everything one would need for a weekend in Seattle. Plus there is more than enough room to stretch out and relax. The location is ideal no matter if it's your first time in the city or visit often. It's literally across the street from the piers and two blocks away from Pike's (website hidden) was super communicative and responded quickly to the few questions that we (website hidden)'s listing is at the top of our list for our next visit to The Town. 
2935486,21281259,2014-10-14,19139972,Spencer,"The apartment was great!  In the most perfect location to explore Seattle, we won't hesitate to book this apartment again, the next time we are in Seattle "
2935486,22292574,2014-11-03,10856887,Nick,Lc was a very good host.  She was accommodating to our staggered check-in and even responded to late night questions about the city.  The apartment looks even better in person than the pictures show as  it's very open and spacious.  Would definitely stay here again! 
2935486,24294152,2014-12-25,20660470,Colleen,"LC was extremely good at staying in touch with us before we arrived as well as after. This was such a pleasure! Any questions or concerns of ours were welcome and encouraged. She went above and beyond to help make us feel at home.
The home was perfect. Comfortable beds, all ameneties, laundry facilities and fantastic view!   We try to go to Seattle each Christmas and this year was particularly satisfying, mostly because of enjoyable and relaxed environment that LC provides."
2935486,27380303,2015-03-02,28324516,Kat,"Beautiful place in a perfect location. The condo was elegantly decorated and had a gorgeous waterfront (website hidden) was a great host; very flexible, and provided timely responses and excellent suggestions on restaurants and attractions."
2935486,39142428,2015-07-21,2233379,Mary,"This condo was a very convenient location to all of Seattle's main attractions.  We never needed to use public transportation, but did make use of the nearby elevator to an upper street.  

The host was easy to communicate with and was able to remedy a minor problem we had with the unit.  There is a LOT of walking involved to reach the elevator and then the unit, so it would not be convenient for anyone who is not mobile.

The actual unit was very cluttered, with a lot of superfluous items around.  And, amazingly, there was no silverware!  And only a couple of glasses.  We did have plastic silverware, but for a place that advertises a full kitchen, some rudimentary silverware is a must.  Furthermore, the closet in one of the 2 bedrooms had no pole on which to hang clothes.  Well, there was actually a pole, but it was broken and could not be repaired w/o other parts.  These may be minor things, but when they start to add up, it's annoying.  I would not return.

"
2935486,43214054,2015-08-18,29274970,Vicki,This unit is in a great location on the waterfront.  There is a lot of trafffic noise though from the Alaskan Hwy. The owner lives in the unit and there is no storage area for clothes as all closets and cabinets are packed with stuff.  The carpets are dirty and there is an extreme dog odor when you unplug the air fresheners. The shower pan was dirty and we had to scrub it when we arrived.  The sheets had stains on them and we had to wash before sleeping.
2935486,44275463,2015-08-25,4527036,Kathryn,"We really enjoyed staying at Lc's place. It was a lovely apartment in a great location so close to Pike Place Market and central downtown Seattle and we also had a view of the bay from the balcony. The apartment is very clean , comfortable and has everything you need for a great stay. Definitely would highly recommend to other independent travellers. Thanks so much for a lovely stay."
2935486,44755013,2015-08-29,30662151,Angela,LC was very nice and helpful.

2935486,45554254,2015-09-04,5387566,Steve,This is a lovely well appointed well located quiet place. It was clean and well stocked and the host gave detailed precise instructions
2935486,45764977,2015-09-06,25164395,Jan,"We had the most wonderful experience staying at LC's. She was flexible with our needs and very responsive. The condo was beautiful, in a perfect location, and had everything we needed and more! Do yourself a favor and stay here if you get the chance!"
2935486,46363711,2015-09-10,27264554,Kristina,"LC was very accommodating. Her apartment is beautiful and has everything we needed. I loved the location and the garaged help. We noticed the bar on the next door apartment. I believe that is why they want you to wait til the garage closes. It's walking distance to the Seattle Great Wheel and even Pike Place Market. Thank you so much for letting us stay in your apartment! We'll definitely stay here again.
"
2935486,46690629,2015-09-13,27976134,Maribeth,"Lc's apartment is just like it looks - very nice, very clean!  The location is perfect for seeing Seattle.  Easy access to the Pike Market and to plenty of places to eat.  There is also a balcony to enjoy where you can see the water.  We felt very welcome (Lc leaves clear information about where to find the hairdryer, which closet space is free, etc.).  Initial access was easy by buzzing Lc.  After the initial access, we had key fobs to get us into the secure building.  We did not have a car, so we did not see the garage.  But, if we had been traveling with a car - the parking would have been a great plus!  I hightly recommend Lc's place!"
2935486,47427583,2015-09-18,43900421,Clayton,Excellent place in a wonderful location and a very cordial and helpful hostess!

Plenty of space for two couples. Had a very short stay but wish we could have stayed longer. We would definitely recommend this place to friends and family. "
2935486,47965336,2015-09-22,36909083,Grace,"This condo is in a great location right across from the waterfront as well as 2 short blocks to Pike's Market and a five minute walk to the ferris wheel and pier.  The inside is clean, beautiful and (website hidden) was very responsive, accommodating and left great instructions.  What a wonderful vacation - thank you!"
2935486,48255176,2015-09-24,6485344,Jp,Wonderful host and incredible place located in a perfect location close to everything. Couldn't have been better. Highly recommended.
2935486,48948367,2015-09-29,4060095,Alison,"This apartment is beautiful, spacious, clean, and in a perfect location on the waterfront. You can watch ferries coming and going from the balcony, hop on the running path that is directly in front of the building, or walk 20 feet (!) to take an elevator up to Pike Place (website hidden) is an excellent host. She replied to all of my inquiries within the hour, and the information she provides guests is clear and incredibly thorough. I'd absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend it for anyone visiting Seattle!"
2935486,49093156,2015-10-01,4782999,Farzina,"My in-laws and aunt/uncle spent 2 nights at Lc's condo. They expressed their satisfaction with how helpful she was with everything. Her place was clean, welcoming and had a million dollar view! The condo was close to all the hot spots of Seattle including Pike Place. I can also say that Lc was very easy going and patient with the booking process ie. I was booking on behalf of my family and had a lot of questions to messenger back/forth. We would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle and looking for an alternative to a hotel - you'll feel just at home."
2935486,49208057,2015-10-02,31030518,John P,good communication.  clean and neat residence.
2935486,49886080,2015-10-07,9006561,Melanie,We felt so at home staying here - the apartment was fantastic.  It had a great amount of space and separation for the 4 of us.  We especially liked the massage chair after a long day of site seeing.  All of the instructions getting to the place were accurate and the level of detail was incredibly (website hidden) even sent us some restaurant recommendations.  We really appreciated it!  We'd stay here again any day.  Thank you so much for hosting us LC!
2935486,50273361,2015-10-11,2514123,Danielle,LC was amazingly accommodating and made all of the directions very clear for the stay (the building itself is very confusing and she helped a TON with her provided info) . The home is beautiful and a perfect location if you want to stay downtown Seattle. Thanks so much! 
2935486,50846232,2015-10-15,16479985,Tim,"Great place, enjoyed our stay. Fantastic location with water views and steps to the Market. Would stay again in future and recommend to others."
2935486,51644539,2015-10-22,45746143,Lucy,"Our stay in Seattle was great. The place was nice and spacious and clean. It gave us a real home like feeling away from home where we can go grocery shopping and cook food at home while gathered around for a few drinks. We were in walking distance to a few tourist locations which was nice since the weather wasn't too bad during our stay we enjoyed walking in it. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants to visit Seattle because our host was real friendly, didn't bother us at all during our stay but instead and is willing to help with any questions you have, for instance, where is good to eat or go for the night, etc. "
2935486,51816048,2015-10-24,46491344,Sabrina,"Place was clean and welcoming with a great location. Getting into the building and accessing the place was easy and straight forward. The only complaint I have is that we were charged a cleaning fee and we were required to strip the beds and start a load of wash which is excessive given we only stayed there for one night. For a higher-end listing like this, I didn't expect to have to be my own maid. Other than that, it was good experience overall. "
2935486,52053850,2015-10-26,22604433,Lucy,"We had a wonderful time staying in LC's apartment!  The apartment was clean and spacious for two couples, and it was in a great location, with views of the water and then an easy walk to Pike Place Market and other downtown activities.  Would highly recommend it!"
2935486,53842455,2015-11-13,47954604,Russell,"What a beautiful apartment on the Seattle waterfront. Very close to Pikes Place and the general downtown. Host made very clear instructions on how to access the unit. Architectural design of building can feel like a long maze but is made up with how beautiful the interior design of the apartment is. The only thing I didn't like is the $35 dollar cleaning fee that I am charged. I was required to clean dishes and sheets before check out. A very easy chore to do since I was only there for 1 night, but isn't that what I'm being charged $35 dollars for anyways? Overall I had a great experience and would definitely return."
2935486,54819604,2015-11-23,4887579,Yiying,The host canceled this reservation 87 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

2935486,56588377,2015-12-15,36380615,Donald,"Our host was extremely helpful with instructions, directions, and advice for our stay. The location of the unit is absolutely ideal, as it is practically on the waterfront of Puget Sound, and within easy walking distance of the Pike Street Market and many other downtown sites. Catching an Uber ride to and from this location is also very easy and convenient. Access to covered parking in the garage is a big plus for anyone who may be driving, or who has guests that need to park. The condo building itself is well equipped with ramps and an elevator for those who cannot handle stairs (since the unit is located on the fourth floor). "
7931111,49295098,2015-10-02,2579691,Mariana,Thank you so much for such a comfortable and welcoming stay at your sunny and bright apartment!  I loved the privacy and proximity to the trail and the lake. I felt right at home and had a hard time packing up to leave. I know right where I will land next time I am in Seattle! 
7931111,50775343,2015-10-14,44310825,Yolanda,Nikki's welcomed us with sincerity and kindness. The listing was accurate and space was great. The location was beautiful.

7931111,53820266,2015-11-13,44429194,Michael,"First off, Nikki was a wonderful host. Kind, friendly and very respectful. Nikki's place is on a quiet street just a short walk from Matthews beach. The unit was very clean and was stocked with everything I needed for my stay. Overall, it was a fantastic trip and a great value. Thanks Nikki!"
7931111,55133513,2015-11-28,1204221,Antonella,"My husband and I had a great time at Nikki's place. The apartment is quiet and homey, the bed was comfortable, and the Wifi very fast. The apartment has a full kitchen that we used several times, and the entire place was very comfortable. I enjoyed running on the Burke-Gilman trail, which is just a block for Nikki's place.
Nikki is a fantastic host: she was helpful and welcoming, and she is an interesting and adventurous person.
I definitely recommend Nikki's place and I would  stay there again."
3254956,15274767,2014-07-06,3549187,Charlotte,"Great place to stay in Seattle. Wallingford is very charming and the apartment/house is right by Lake Union and the Burke-Gilman trail. Close to shops, cafes etc on 45th street and less than 2 blocks from a bus stop. The apartment is spacious, clean and has a private entrance. Dimple is a great host. She made me feel very welcome and was super accommodating and made sure I had everything I needed for my stay. I highly recommend staying at Dimple's place!"
3254956,15836957,2014-07-16,7042915,Kaitlyn,"Dimple is a great host with a lovely space. This MIL basement apartment has everything you need when traveling from a full kitchen, to a cozy living room, bedroom and bathroom. The bed was very comfortable, and its size didn't make the room feel small. There is also a washer and dryer, which is convenient if you are traveling for an extended period of time, and ample storage (closets, dressers, etc.) so you don't feel that you're living out of a suitcase for the duration of your stay. 

In addition, this apartment is close to public transit and is only 10 minutes way from the University of Washington, and 30 minutes way from downtown Seattle. It's two blocks away from the water and Burke-Gilman trail, as well as Gas Works Park, which was a neat find! 

Overall, I highly recommend and would gladly stay here again. "
3254956,15984933,2014-07-19,13316614,Dana,"Fabulous host and wonderful place to stay! Super clean, all the basic necessities provided, exactly how it is described. There was even detergent for the clothes washing machine. The wifi is not super strong if you're looking for business speed. Great location, convenient free parking. Would definitely recommend and stay again."
3254956,16119262,2014-07-22,17132889,Kathleen,"Dimple was very responsive to all my inquiries. She always got back to me in a very timely manner.  During our stay, we didn't see her a lot , but she was very friendly and helpful when we did interact. The studio apt. was clean, private and larger than I expected. It was kind of dark, since it was a basement apt.  Also, the double bed was small for 2 large adults. However, both of these points were made in the listing, so it was not a surprise.  The location was great for us.  It was in a beautiful neighborhood, with a terrific view.  It was close to buses, which was important to us.  Eating establishments and nightlife were not right next door, but were within walking distance.  Overall, it was a very good experience."
3254956,16561303,2014-07-29,14294217,Tina,"The listing for the apartment was very accurate. Very clean and neat, and quiet. Anything we ask for was quickly responded to.  The only thing that would have made my husbands stay better was to have a coffee pot in the apartment.  The location was easy and convenient to everything.  We will definitely recommend this apartment to anyone staying near Seattle.  We will stay there again when we visit.  Thanks Dimples"
3254956,16749406,2014-08-01,18840535,Jacquelyn,"Great Location! Great space! The listing description for this space is very accurate, perfect, no surprises! The neighborhood is amazing! This particular house is newer and very well done. The walkway to the back is so charming. There is a palm tree tucked in there! The space was clean and well appointed. Security of the apartment seemed adequate but really the neighborhood as a whole seemed very safe. I was never concerned.  Communication with Dimple was easy and casual - just emailed back and forth for simple things. She always responded very quickly. She inquired if I had everything I needed which was thoughtful. Having WiFi was a really important ammenity! The apartment is about 1.5 blocks from the BEAUTIFUL views of Lake Union. The easy access to the Burke-Gilman trail should not be underestimated. I walked to explore Gas Works Park and found coffee, breakfast, bike shop, drinks and dinner - all within walking distance. I had a car and (free, street) parking was super-easy. Always a spot or two right out in front. If I ever find myself in need of a place to stay in Seattle, this is the first place I will look. Just a flawless airbnb experience. "
3254956,16914364,2014-08-04,2897522,Jessica,"The good: the location is great. I walked to an amazing dinner, felt really safe, and was central to everything. Dimple left me the key under the mat, so it was easy for me to get in as my schedule was wonky. 

The bad: the apartment smells of mildew, there aren't any pots or pans to cook with, no coffee pot (I often stay at Airbnb's so that I can cook and cut down the costs of eating out every meal), and the Thursday night I stayed there Dimple was in the kitchen above the bedroom until 1am and it was very loud. 

The ugly: Due to ""the bad"" I asked Dimple to refund me for the last two nights--I needed to sleep and felt uncomfortable with the mildew. She agreed. And then didn't (after the fact)--or did, but if I paid the cancelation fees (not what we agreed on at first). It was a long and complicated process, at the end of which Airbnb paid me back. Overall, it was a really unpleasant experience and by far my worst Airbnb ever. "
3254956,17384286,2014-08-11,2693887,Sean,"Dimple's rental apartment is great! It's really spacious, clean, and has everything you'd want-including a washer and dryer, which is very helpful for longer stays.

It's also perfect location-wise. I was able to walk to Gas Works Park and the main drags of Wallingford and Fremont, which are full of shops and restaurants. 

It's an easy drive or bus to downtown,  too. "
3254956,17700797,2014-08-16,2535837,Jamie,"I had a wonderful time staying here, It's a very roomy and private unit in a beautiful area. I enjoyed walking to work in Fremont along the water every morning, and it was easy to get anywhere in the city quickly by Uber. The place is just as described and the host is responsive and helpful."
3254956,18451678,2014-08-26,20262272,Joshua,First experience in Seattle went out for a wedding. Host was very accommodating this was a last minute booking and my first time on airbnb overall great experience. Place was exactly as it was described and perfect for my trip.  Host was extremely helpful with all my questions! 
3254956,19155522,2014-09-07,601220,Enia,"Lovely basement flat in a charming neighborhood. Easy walk to Wallingford's main drag, 45th. Fantastic washer and dryer! "
3254956,19394114,2014-09-11,1153823,Ryan,"Dimple was a great host. She was super easy to communicate with. Price was right for this location and place. 

Only real complaints is that the place was a bit hot for a basement apartment. This would be only a rare summer issue though. Also the ceiling is not soundproof so around 11pm we could hear footsteps. Not a very big issue either.

We would definitely rent again from Dimple. Thanks!"
3254956,19861109,2014-09-19,2522209,Phillip,House is on quiet street. Down the street you can see Downtown Seattle. Apartment is great. Nice and cozy. Clean and spacious.

3254956,23759122,2014-12-09,22021525,Debra, Dimple changed the rent drastically for my 2nd month.I had to go out of town  and contacted her 4 days before leaving to pay the (website hidden) response.While  I was gone she sent me an email saying the rent was going up drastically and I also need to leave early.If she  had let  me know I could have found another (website hidden) experience ended badly.This place had few amenities and is not worth the price.
3254956,26220339,2015-02-07,24135527,Patrick,"I stayed at Dimple's apartment for 2 weeks, and the process was easy and seamless. The apartment is in a very nice/safe area. It's only a few minutes walking to a great neighborhood coffee spot, otherwise a longer walk to downtown Wallingford, but I had a car with me which made things easier. In unit washer/dryer was great. There aren't a lot of kitchen supplies, but they are enough if you are by yourself. Nice large TV and comfortable sofa. It's a basement unit so if you need to make a phone call you may need to step outside."
3254956,27010847,2015-02-23,2866841,Dan,"Great location for a quiet neighborhood and quick, walkable access to Wallingford, Fremont, and the U District. The apartment was clean and tidy and had all the necessities. The washer and dryer is a big plus if you're staying for more than a week (I stayed for two weeks). You can occasionally hear people walking upstairs but it didn't cause any problems for me. It is in a basement so there isn't a ton of natural light.  I did not have any interaction with the hosts beyond email. Overall a good value, particularly considering the location, and I would definitely stay here again."
3254956,28966933,2015-04-01,20402024,Nick,"Great place, clean and easily accessible.  Only lacking some minor kitchen implements but added washer/dryer was great..."
3254956,33160331,2015-05-25,4090548,Frederic,"Exactly what I look for in a Airbnb accommodations:  clean, convenient, nice kitchen, and safe.  Communication with Dimple was great - she would respond promptly to my various questions.  Additionally, she provided me a couple of kitchen supplies (e.g. baking pan, frying pan) after I asked her.  Checking in and out was a breeze.  The pictures are an accurate representation of the apartment.  "
3254956,35935416,2015-06-23,32664089,Christopher,This was a very nice location.  The host was very flexible and accommodating to our requests.
3254956,36819631,2015-07-01,12452611,Miranda,"This is a great basic crash pad if you are visiting Seattle.  It's comfortable and clean.  If you plan to do much cooking, it might be a challenge, as the kitchen is stocked with just the basics.  Also, be aware that it is difficult to bring in your luggage, as there are many flights of stairs to contend with.  You must go up a steep flight from the street, through a paver path in the landscape to the back gate and down another narrow and steep set of steps to the unit itself.  Overall, a great stay!"
3254956,37269512,2015-07-05,37332308,Jonathan,"Staying here was easy and had fantastic access to I-5, neighborhood grocery and city park at Gasworks. Dimple was easy to communicate with and checked in periodically to ensure our stay was up to par. The basement apartment was in great condition and we experienced a quiet stay with all the amenities needed to feel at home on the road!"
3254956,39497620,2015-07-24,33727606,Robin,"Dimple's apartment was ideal for my three week stay in Seattle. The location was great, and the apartment had everything I needed. Dimple was very helpful with all questions I had and quick to respond. Thanks!"
3254956,39684502,2015-07-25,38462571,Maggie,Easy access to the key and unit. Clean and spacious. The whole thing was very low stress 
3254956,42689038,2015-08-15,5267540,Leif,This is a pretty self-serve place. It worked great for me. Big comfy living room. 
3254956,43451073,2015-08-19,41197241,Kurtis,Great experience! Enjoyed the apartment and all the amenities. Wifi and cable on a big screen TV. 
3254956,45001887,2015-08-30,41958935,Alicia,My husband and I spent 3 days at Dimple's Apartment. It was in a great location had many restaurants that were walking distance the bus stop was very close. Which was our transportation to down town Seattle. Apartment was a lot bigger than what we thought very clean and spacious had everything we needed. Would defiantly be staying here again if we decide to visit Seattle again. 
3254956,51806322,2015-10-24,6800511,Eric,"This is an immaculate, seemingly brand new 1-bdrm in a pleasant, very accessible neighborhood. Its a few blocks from loads of shops on 45th st, and a block from a fairly stunning view of Seattle and Lake union. Description is accurate, host was welcoming, everything was seamless."
4608592,24853297,2015-01-03,4232907,Paulina,"Alexandra was a lovely & communicative host. Her place in Wallingford was very clean and centrally located to bars, restaurants and more. Would definitely stay here again!"
4608592,25518188,2015-01-18,24904648,Victoria,Everything was awesome with the place!
4608592,27628118,2015-03-08,9456579,Steve,"Alex is gracious, discretely available and flexible.

She helped us last minute with an extra bed for one of the kids.

Terrific neighborhood for proximity to University, Lake Union, I-5.

Excellent value - new feel to unit - clean, efficient.  Great front porch for the sunny days we were lucky to have."
4608592,28448599,2015-03-23,22534821,Stephen,"This is an attractively furnished and very well equipped house in an average neighbourhood. It is right next to the I-5, but thankfully we didn't hear any noise from the back bedrooms. Everything was extremely clean - indeed the oven was spotless, possibly the cleanest Airbnb I have stayed at.
We were made to feel very welcome by Alexandra and her lovely family. We enjoyed our stay!"
4608592,29814840,2015-04-13,2957991,Sandhya,"We had a great stay at Alex's place.  The location was within walking distance to some great restaurants and bars.  The house itself was very clean, and had all the amenities needed to make our stay comfortable.  It was very easy to communicate with Alex for check in & check out.  Would definitely recommend this place!"
4608592,30432789,2015-04-21,31432458,Samuel,"Everything was just like in the pictures host is awesome everything was great , thanks for having us."
4608592,31966930,2015-05-12,786886,Julia,"We had a great stay at Alex's place. We traveled with our 1 year old and it was great for kids. Alex even supplied a crib, high chair, and cute toys. It was definitely one of the better stays we have had through airbnb."
4608592,34707337,2015-06-11,27180950,Sebastian,"Alex was a phenomenal host, everything was very clean and in place when we arrived, and she did an awesome job of making sure that we had a fantastic stay.  The duplex was in a delightful part of town, in the city but still in a very nice residential area which was very close to any part of Seattle.  My roommates and I loved our time there."
4608592,35196053,2015-06-16,26491673,Maria,"Alex is a wonderful host.  She was very friendly and accommodating. If there was anything we needed she made herself available to help us out.  We felt like welcome guests in her home.
The neighborhood is one of the nicest in Seattle with easy access to the highways, stores and cafés.
Strongly recommend this home to anyone staying in Seattle.
Everything was new, clean and modern.  Very comfortable home."
4608592,35902552,2015-06-23,19477457,Chris,"Awesome stay. Highly recommend. Alex is also very easy to communicate with and very accommodating. House is so close to the I-5 that it makes getting anywhere quick and easy, but also lots of food, drink, gas etc very close by just up the street. Great walk score. "
4608592,36768350,2015-07-01,29816978,Janet,The duplex was everything Alexa had described.  There were 4 adults and two kids so we used the couch also which was comfortable.  The backyard table was used in the morning which helped us get through Seattle's one week of the year where it was hot.  We enjoyed the garden which wasn't mentioned in the ad.  With the great location we would return here.
4608592,38483326,2015-07-16,14985104,Yang,"The Okubos' home is extremely clean and modern. Everything the host left there make me felt warm!

I brought my family to enjoy a 8 days trip in summer Seattle. We have a toddler, and Alex left toys, crib, and highchair specially for us. We already felt very comfortable, and these things make us even more happy because they saved us a lot of effort with a toddler at home.

The location is very good to a person who need to commute to UW area. I took a workshop at UW during that time, and walk to the fisher science building only took me 16 minutes. It's also close to gas work park and green lake area, where you can enjoy a leisure. For grocery, we visited trader Joe and QFC. Both are within  20 minutes walk. Funny it is, we just found QFC is kroger in Washington state.

In general, it's will be your ideal home for your stay, short or long!"
4608592,38998286,2015-07-20,7595141,Rosanne,"Our family enjoyed staying at your house! It was clean and had the basic things we needed. Since the wedding we were attending was at the university district, the house was conveniently located.  We would definitely stay in this house again.

Since the owner was out of the country, she had a friend come over to see if we needed anything.  Wish we could have met you, Alexandra. Maybe next time!!"
4608592,39384880,2015-07-23,14677919,Stephen,"Alexandra's place was modern and squeaky clean, yet it still maintained a cozy warmth that made us feel right at home. It was about a 15 minute walk to our classes at University of Washington. It was everything that we wanted in an apartment."
4608592,39937388,2015-07-27,5167871,Kelsey,"What a great duplex and location! The home was clean and had everything you would need. The location can't be beat - close to grocery, coffee shops, restaurants and a quick drive downtown. Alex was a lovely host and provided great info. One the easiest check in/out experiences with all the info you would need. Highly recommend."
4608592,40710342,2015-08-02,12052738,Nikole,Alex wasn't in town while we stayed at the duplex but was very communicative and helpful ahead of our stay. The place was just as described; the beds were very comfortable and there was plenty of space for 2 teens and 2 adults. It is really nice to have a dining table for sharing meals although the place is near neighborhood restaurants and close enough to tourist attractions that many will enjoy when visiting Seattle.
4608592,41205522,2015-08-05,33400954,Carolyn,Alexandra was out of town when we arrived but she had a notebook with very detailed instructions.  The house was exactly as the pictured.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet.  Parking was not a huge issue for us but I can see how it could be.  We enjoyed the fact that we were close to the city but not too close! 
4608592,41354168,2015-08-07,32284763,Michelle,"Alex was great. She made us feel right at home. Property was in a great location and close to Seattle. Minutes to I-5, very easy to find and near everything. House was very nice and clean. Roomy too. The only thing I can think it needed was was another small love seat or couch in living room. For 5 people there wasn't enough ""comfy"" seats at night when we wanted to relax and talk. I would stay here again, and you will be pleased too. Thanks Alex! "
4608592,42282792,2015-08-12,36925627,Adela,"The Duplex is in a great location, mins from University village and University of Washington.  The place was very comfortable even for 4 adults.  Alex provided enough fans throughout all the rooms and with windows open at night, the entire space was very cool even for a hot summer night.  "
4608592,43363732,2015-08-19,34250143,Thilo,"We had six amazing days in Seattle and decided to stay with Alexandra. The appartement is in walking distance of many shops, was clean and quiet. Alex was a wonderful host! We totally enjoyed our stay & can totally recommend it!"
4608592,43944565,2015-08-23,37084561,Melissa,Great place for our family of four. Well equipped and very clean. Wallingford is a great neighborhood.
4608592,44440900,2015-08-26,13732216,Sam,"We had a great stay at Alex's place. The house was very clean, and we were very comfortable. It is a great location close to I-5, UW, and some great restaurants nearby. We went to QFC down the street. It was very easy to communicate with Alex and she was even willing to accomodate us with a pack in play and high chair which came in real handy with our son. I Would definitely recommend this place and we plan on staying here again the next time we are in Seattle! Thanks Alex. "
4608592,45076935,2015-08-31,34369734,Rachel,We really enjoyed staying at the duplex in Wallingford. It's a great location! Very easy to get around the city given the proximity to multiple bus lines. The neighborhood is great and has a lot of good restaurant options within walking distance. Alexandra was an amazing host!  She was responsive to our questions and was very accommodating when we requested an early check in. I would recommend staying at the duplex!
4608592,45945853,2015-09-07,26979439,Cunzhi,"Very great experience. Descriptions are quite accurate. This location is very easy to travel to by both bus and car.

Check-in and check-out was flawless and simple. Great instructions about the living space. Despite this being a duplex, we did not hear any sound/noise coming from the other half at all. My parents-in-law commented that the bed was great to sleep in.

Thanks!"
4608592,46896337,2015-09-14,39614866,Roger,"Everything was ready and in top condition.  The unit is in beautiful condition,  nicely furnished and in a quiet neighborhood, easy to get to everything we needed."
4608592,47666644,2015-09-21,5437822,Kyle,"My wife, two young children and I had a great stay at Alex's duplex...it's very well represented in the photos and descriptions, and the location is incredibly convenient.  Wallingford is a really great neighborhood, we enjoyed walking up to 45th St and down to the waterfront.  We definitely plan to stay here again when visiting friends in Seattle!  "
4608592,48706874,2015-09-28,29541002,Lauren,"This apartment was perfect for our stay while we moved our daughter into Univ. of Wash.  It is conveniently located close to campus and the 2 bedroom apartment was perfect for our needs.  The house is located on a quiet street, so it was peaceful in the evenings."
4608592,50458246,2015-10-12,11738003,Tyler,Great place to relax! Alex's house is comfortable and very clean! It is extremely close to the freeway and makes getting to downtown a breeze. Beds are comfortable and kitchen was fully stocked with everything you need to prepare a meal.
4608592,52065425,2015-10-26,42958523,Nanette,"Everything was great.  Convenient and right off the freeway but no freeway noise.  Nice, safe neighborhood with easy street parking.  Alex was very accommodating and adjusted check in and check out times for us.  Place was clean, and large enough for 5 of us to sleep without being in each other's way.  Would stay there again.
"
4608592,53533611,2015-11-09,876058,Don,"Easy to find, quick 'hello' from our host. Parking was not a problem, location good, duplex-apartment clean and comfortable, all modern conveniences, comfy beds, nicely fitted kitchen. Pay attention to the steps to the front deck, and mind the nice floor and rugs inside (shoes off please). In spite of freeway proximity, we hardly noticed it at all. Location was quite convenient for just about everywhere we wanted to go. We'd stay here again."
7803176,43445675,2015-08-19,41215757,Spencer,"Comfy bed, quiet neighborhood, cheerful friendly hostess, and a chocolate bar on the pillow in case I was hungry arriving from the airport. Everything one could hope for!"
7803176,44217745,2015-08-24,41271067,John,"I had a very nice four night stay at Angie's.  She made me feel very welcome as a guest in her home.   The room is a very comfortable size, with a big window for sunshine and fresh air.   Her place is in a nice neighborhood, with a couple of restaurants within just a one minute walk.  I had to visit Seattle for a family health issue, and while there I was able to relax in the evening and keep up on work items, as Angie's home was very quiet."
7803176,45324456,2015-09-01,1477869,Daniel,"Angie's apartment was a nice option for our visit to Seattle during the Pax convention.  We didn't see her much, but felt at home with her cat, who never wanted to leave the right side arm of the sofa.  Spartan room but comfy bed.  Bus 28 (less than a block away) can get you downtown in 35-45 minutes for $2.50, and get you back in 20.  There's a nice food market on the corner for coffee and quick meals and more options a 5 minute walk away.  Overall, a good place to crash if you don't mind a little journey into town, or staying in a very quiet, residential area. Angie is very accommodating."
7803176,51065906,2015-10-17,20331575,Maggie,Angie was a great host. She went out of her way to accommodate and welcome me. Her home was very clean and comfortable. The location was perfect for my needs. I really enjoyed my stay!
7803176,51452186,2015-10-20,39258604,Eric,"Great experience! All I ever need when I travel is a comfortable, private room to sleep and Angie's place did just that and more. There's a small TV on a dresser with Chromecast (if you want to watch something), a comfortable bed and a window. You're in a great neighborhood with really cool restaurants. Old-hen, ridgeback both had great breakfast, the market on the corner has great espresso and the Barking Dog has a good beer for you. Downtown is only a bus ride away and Uber and Lyft are always easy options. Angie and I only saw each other for about 2 mins during my entire stay but was a great host. I'd stay again if I was welcome. "
7803176,54924509,2015-11-25,41158892,Paige,"I had an awesome time here. Angie was a fantastic, friendly host who made me feel welcome instantly. Gold star!"
6637899,34375972,2015-06-07,26707035,Allison,"Eileen was a wonderful host, incredibly nice and very welcoming!! Her home was really neat (perfect for nature lovers), great location, easy parking, gorgeous backyard, and the sweetest dog. I would definitely recommend and plan on staying there again during future visits! Thank you Eileen!"
6637899,37508599,2015-07-07,34531435,Sylvia,"Eileen is a very nice lady, and kindly welcomed us into her home. If you're a reader this house is heaven on earth. Very quiet home and neighborhood with a park conveniently located at the end of the block. Had a great experience staying here, she even served us some crackers and wine over great conversation our last night! There was no cable but with great internet access who really needs cable these days anyway? I would recommend it if you need a room and are in the area. I cant end this review without mentioning how awesome her dog is. He is extremely obedient, and although he is large he's really just big sweet heart! "
6637899,38616742,2015-07-17,17246383,Leslie,"Very clean.  Nice large room.  Neighborhood was close to everything, but still quiet.  The host was very welcoming and easy to be around.   Perfect for me.  "
6637899,39199583,2015-07-21,22620969,Stephanie,This was my first time using airbnb and Eileen was amazing. She had great reccomendations on things to do for me and my friend since we aren't big planners and arrived in Seattle with very few plans. Room and neighborhood were great. We walked to multiple resturants and bakeries daily and reasoned the hills made up for all the delicious food. Eileen and her adorable pup made us feel right at home and we had an great trip!
6637899,40503760,2015-07-31,12712,Matthew,"This is an *awesome* spot. Super cozy room with a very comfortable bed, beautiful, peaceful views, great light and an amazing bathroom (that is off the hallway outside the room but still felt private enough). The massive skylight in the shower was especially spectacular at night. Eileen was extremely sweet and welcoming. And the location is excellent - convenient enough to walk most places and close enough to the center that taxis home at night were never more than $10. Really couldn't have asked for a better AirBnB experience in Seattle."
6637899,40956769,2015-08-03,5529156,Maggie,"Eileen was totally welcoming, a lovely host, offered lots of great suggestions for places to eat and sites to check out. 
The house was convenient to downtown and public transportation, the room very comfortable. The stay felt similar to visiting a friend. "
6637899,41971813,2015-08-10,3271702,James,"Eileen is delightful and the room and the house are wonderful! From the moment she quickly accepted our reservation request, things could not have gone more smoothly. The house is clean and charming, and the location is perfect and close to everything. Eileen and Higgs (her short-haired retriever) are thoughtful and helpful, while offering and respecting privacy. There will be return visits, as we now count Eileen among those we call friends. :-)"
6637899,42481554,2015-08-13,1667392,Alice,"I had an absolutely wonderful stay with Eileen and her beautiful dog, Higgsie. Eileen was the perfect host - very easy to communicate with pre-arrival and brimming with suggestions of where to eat and where to go around Seattle.

The property itself is gorgeous with beautiful gardens and Eileen's lovely interior decorating. The room was very spacious and comfortable and I haven't slept as fitfully as I did at Eileen's in a very long time. 

There were amazing cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance and several bus lines as well. The walk to lower Capitol Hill and the retail around Pike/Pine was very easy.

Eileen went above and beyond to help me feel settled, including dropping me off at my next destination after I checked out.

This is truly one of the best places I have stayed at on AirBnB. Thank you Eileen and Higgsie for being amazing hosts!"
6637899,43080464,2015-08-17,2007207,Karen,"I couldn't have been happier with this experience. Elaine was the most helpful of hosts and made me feel very welcome in her beautiful home.  If you like being surrounded with beauty (and function), this is the home. Gorgeous craftsman style with so many design details, art, books. Loved it. Very clean. Bedroom was large, bed comfy (loved the pillows) and loved taking a shower with a glass ceiling looking out to the sky and tall trees. Quiet, also.  "
6637899,44342184,2015-08-25,21398603,Jean,"All was perfection--a charming abode in a lovely, quiet neighborhood. We thought we rented the entire house (my oversight), but were happy as clams there anyway. Eileen was so easygoing and helpful. We  were grateful to return to it's peace and quiet after exhausting days. Higgs the Dog was adorable. "
6637899,44858265,2015-08-29,39169709,Jim,We really enjoyed our stay at Eileen's place.  She was very welcoming and certainly made us feel at home.  We woke up to french press coffee and were encouraged to enjoy vegetables from her garden.  Eileen provided great suggestions on things to do while in town.  The location is close to downtown and many parks.  The bed was extremely comfortable and we even enjoyed wine and cheese on the porch overlooking the lake.  We would certainly stay here again when visiting Seattle.  
6637899,45301471,2015-09-01,9309918,Julien,"A peaceful place and a really nice and helpful host, and the bus for downtown is really close. 

Eileen also had lots of suggestions to explore national parks, and was generally very helpful. 

Would definitely come back!"
6637899,46030655,2015-09-07,34260901,Eleanor,"I had a really lovely stay at Eileen's home I. Seattle. Eileen and Higgs (her dog) were excellent hosts and I felt very much at home. Eileen was really helpful in suggesting things to do in the city. Eileen was great at responding quickly to any queries I had - which was really appreciated, particularly in an unfamiliar city. The house is lovely and accommodation exactly as described. I would definitely stay again next time I'm in Seattle!"
6637899,46625549,2015-09-12,311971,Margit,"We loved our time at Eileens beautiful place. She and Higgs (her dog) have been very warm and friendly hosts and Eileen had the best recommendations for the neighbourhood! We only wish we could have stayed longer :) thank you and all the best, Margit, Lars and Baby Lucy"
6637899,47121983,2015-09-15,9486505,Claire,"My friend and I stayed im Seattle for three nights. Eileen was a great host, very welcoming and really made us comfortable! She gave us a lot of advice and brochures to visit the city, and her dog is adorable.
The room was very bright and clean. The place is surrounded by plants and trees which we liked, and it is only a block away from 2 bus that goes to downtown in 20 minutes which is convenient.
I would definitely recommend it! "
6637899,47885373,2015-09-21,13100873,Margot,"Eileen is perfect, her house is perfect, her design sense is perfect, and everything was extremely clean and extremely  comfortable. The way I want to one day keep a home! In my dreams! Higgs is lovely too. FYI: Eileen stays in the house with you but you get your own bathroom with blue bathtub and a fabulous skylight over the tub and shower, very cool on rainy days. It all feels very Seattle in the perfect way. Thank you Eileen! "
6637899,48465662,2015-09-26,14108920,Ian,"We had a great time staying at Eileen's. The house is beautiful, full of wonderful books. Eileen was very welcoming and helpful. Higgs is a lovely, friendly, obedient dog. We would really like to stay with Eileen again when our travels take us to Seattle. Thank you Eileen for hosting us."
6637899,49948213,2015-10-07,45492599,Bj,A great warm place in a great quiet location. Nice view and garden!
6637899,50211591,2015-10-10,3271702,James,"Eileen is a most gracious and fascinating host and person. She is kind, caring, and takes every effort to make us feel welcome and at home. This is a repeat visit, and there will be many more. Much more than a host(ess)...Eileen has become a friend. Higgs is pretty amazing, too. :-) We are grateful for this, our Seattle home, and for our newfound friend. The house is great, too! Location is second to none. And accommodations are comfortable and clean. We love that it is a ""no shoes in the house"" house. You can't go wrong with this as your home base when visiting Seattle. Cheers and happy travels!"
6637899,54159148,2015-11-16,29413419,Elizabeth,Our stay at Eileen's was wonderful! She is a very hospitable host and was very welcoming. She was exceptionally helpful in navigating local transportation and recommended many yummy restaurants! The neighborhood she lives in is very conveniently located in the city and there are many great restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. We would definitely recommend Eileen's to anyone visiting  Seattle. 
6637899,55237690,2015-11-29,47843196,Shari,Eileen was very welcoming. She welcomed us with wine and cheese and gave great ideas about local attractions. Her home is comfortable and quiet. Very quiet neighborhood. comfy bed.
6637899,58617999,2016-01-03,1970742,Kristina,"I stayed with Eileen for one month during my relocation to Seattle from the Bay Area. Moves are stressful in the best of circumstances, but during the winter holiday season it's particularly hard not to be in the cozy familiarity of your own home. 

The hospitality and generosity Eileen showed me during my stay remind me of the reason Airbnb exists: to make you feel at home, anywhere. 

During my time with Eileen (and Higgs, easily the coolest, sweetest dog I've ever met), she made me feel completely at home in her beautiful, spacious, overflowing with charm Craftsman. She really loves Seattle and all of her recommendations (where to eat, shop, find the best coffee, pastries, etc.) were spot on—and I'm pretty selective. 

Also, it can be tough to share a space with another human—even if it's temporary (I usually rent entire apartments or homes). Eileen is both accessible and very respectful of privacy. I enjoyed many lovely conversations with her but also enjoyed having my own space. 

All in all, Eileen made a stressful transition month so much easier and more enjoyable. If you want a beautiful, cozy home away from home, unbeatable city location, and sage local recommendations, you should definitely book a stay here. "

If you want to see where the native people of Seattle eat, drink and shop there is hundred places within a short walking distance. If you want to go see all the tourist attractions there only a few miles away. Serena was very hospitable. "

7073650,38906063,2015-07-19,37261634,Rachel,Sarena is a warm and wonderful Airbnb host. As the title says her place is absolutely charming. A tidy little gem in a great neighborhood. I would have been happy to stay there for weeks. 
7073650,39995073,2015-07-27,37361864,Tejas,It was a cute and cozy house and Sarena was an amazing host.
7073650,43102923,2015-08-17,27915798,Jay,"This apartment is perfectly located on Capitol Hill. It's right between Broadway and 15th Ave each with wonderful restaurants, bars and all the amenities one could want. The kitchen is well supplied and there are stores nearby if one wants to cook at home. 

Sarena is communicates thoroughly and makes the process very easy to get into the unit. The bed is comfortable and the apartment is really spacious.

I miss Seattle already."
7073650,45275909,2015-09-01,6353069,Sea,"The neighborhood was the perfect location for visiting Seattle. Our host made us feel incredibly welcome with a nice note and a bottle of wine. The apartment was as described, very clean, safe and comfortable, and our host was very accommodating to our check in and out times. We felt right at home. "
7073650,46798096,2015-09-13,33535022,Iris,"Sarena's place is great - it was cosy, clean, close to transport, some great restaurants, an awesome coffee shop (which she personally recommended), and yet it's quiet. The listing is accurate.

Sarena herself went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and responded to any questions we had very quickly. We would definitely stay here again!"
7073650,48429649,2015-09-26,1249272,Natassia,"Sarena's home is a charming urban sanctuary; it really felt like a sacred space that has clearly been lovingly prepared to receive travelers.  Sarena's gracious hospitality, meticulous attention to detail, and responsiveness were exceptional. We were welcomed with thoughtful gestures such as soothing music, candles, soft lights and even a bottle of chilled wine! The apartment is also in a fabulous location - far enough from the hustle and bustle so that it really feels safe and quiet, but just a few minutes away from fun restaurants and bars with amazing food and atmosphere.

7975026,44084791,2015-08-23,28910417,Melanie,"We had a last minute booking. Henry was very kind, accommodating, and communicated quickly. He even left us beer in the frig. The apartment was as described. The door lock was a little tough but doable.  The bed was comfortable, TV worked good with Netflix. We did not prepare food there so can't speak to those ammenities. The location was great as we were able to walk most everywhere (the walk to Pike Place was long but still better than driving). Even though there was some street noise, it was remarkably quiet for its location and settled down around 9:30 pm. We slept great!"
5956968,34753973,2015-06-11,13583697,Dave,"A very nice 1 bedroom located above a garage in a very nice house. There is a bedroom and a bath. 

The space is just for the bedroom and bath. There is no access to other spaces such as a kitchen or living room. 

Lots of free parking on the street.

Andrew was very nice and responsive to emails."
5956968,36137428,2015-06-25,14514343,Sara,The room was lovely and clean and appeared just as advertised.  I had a very peaceful and relaxing stay. Wonderful view from the window with the sound of the fountain below.  This is a very nice area with parks and restaurants within walking distance. 
5956968,36612947,2015-06-29,15835299,Grace,"My parents had a wonderful stay in this room! It's a private unit with it's own entrance through the garage - the unit consisted of a bed, table, and bathroom. It was clean and had beautiful views from the windows. Andrew was also very responsive both before and during their entire stay. This unit is perfect if you're looking for a nice place to sleep in a great neighborhood and planning on spending most of your time exploring Seattle!"
5956968,36707190,2015-06-30,15467486,Mike,Andrew was very welcoming and a great host. His home is immaculate and has beautiful views. The room was a perfect size for 1-2 people but can get warm during the summer on hot days. 
5956968,37362432,2015-07-06,13377376,Josh,"The space is the valet's quarters above the garage, and it's wonderfully cozy room in a lovely part of town with private access. Andrew is a courteous and friendly host."
5956968,38526117,2015-07-16,10393894,Lisa,"As a former Seattlite, the location and room was perfect. Lots of parking, quiet street - yet close to all of the things that I love about Seattle. Andrew was a gracious host and made sure that I felt welcome. "
5956968,40674768,2015-08-01,27864448,Tracy,Andrew is a great host and we had a lovely experience.  The room is over the garage with a private access door inside the garage.  We found the listing was accurate and enjoyed the antiques and period feel of the room.  The view is outstanding and every part of the process went smoothly.  Andrew communicated well and we would be happy stay at his home again.
5956968,41405091,2015-08-07,34212973,Cheryl,"We really enjoyed staying in this charming room for four nights. Great neighborhood, very close to the areas we wanted to be, and very quiet. There were several nice coffee shops that we enjoyed walking to in the morning and then there is bus line that goes by just a few blocks away from the house. There is no air conditioning so we were a little worried about that but after the windows were opened there was a great breeze blowing through the room and it was perfect sleeping temperature. We would definitely stay there again."
5956968,41770266,2015-08-09,35811396,Eric,"Staying here was nothing short of excellent--the location, room, set up, and host were all top notch. 

The location is in one of the most coveted parts of Seattle--just a few minutes walk from Kerry Park and the main part of (upper) Queen Anne Ave. It's close to bus lines and a short walk to the bars in Lower Queen Anne as well.

The room was very comfortable. It had enough space for two people with some luggage and an awesome view.

The setup was also really well thought out. The room has a private entrance so you don't have to worry about bothering anyone else in the rest of the residence and you can come and go as you please.

Lastly, Andrew was an amazing host. He thinks through small details to make sure your time here is enjoyable. He also responds promptly to messages which is always a breath of fresh air."
5956968,42439254,2015-08-13,38861848,Lowell,"This is a nice, cozy, clean room above the house's garage. The host was very hands off, I actually never saw him during our stay, but is quick to respond if you bounce him a message. It's in a fantastic location high up on a hill, just a few minutes' walk from one of the best views of downtown Seattle. If you plan on doing a lot of walking, the hill will give you a good workout on your way back to the residence.

The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, and if for some reason you are unable to park in the driveway, there is ample, available, and free street parking in the area. It's just a ten minute walk to Lower Queen Anne, a trendy area with a whole host of great dining and drinking options.

My only gripe is that the wireless internet was quite spotty. I didn't spend much time in the unit (I was on vacation, out on the town and such) but for the little bit that I wanted to use the internet it wasn't very reliable. I never contacted the host about it, though, it might be something that he could've easily fixed if I had.

Overall, I had a very pleasant stay here, and would do so again the next time I'm in Seattle."
5956968,43255239,2015-08-18,37730740,Andy,Amazing house in an amazing neighborhood.   Short walk to parks with sweeping views of the city.  Cheap uber ride to downtown.  Fun place to stay incredible property. 
5956968,44305112,2015-08-25,4954654,Robert,"From the room, we witnessed a hummingbird’s repetitive 30 foot dive-bombs near the Koi pond (a mating ritual), as well as Seattle Mariner post-game fireworks.  Short walk to Kerry Park (popular city overlook) and Marshall Park (nice place to watch the sun set).  Lovely, quiet neighborhood with on-street parking readily available 24/7.  Numerous food options within walking distance.

Small water heater in room accompanies an assortment of teas and S-bux Via coffees. 
 
Owner is receptive to feedback.  Previous reviewer commented on heat.  Retractable window shade was installed in bathroom skylight day we arrived.  During our four sunny day stay, the shade eliminated any issue with summer heat.  Had spotty wifi reception, did some testing, found only consistently usable wifi speed was at top of the stairs.  Owner said he would add a wifi repeater.

Would stay here again with joy.

5956968,45112830,2015-08-31,659967,Mary,"What a wonderful spot!  Andrew was a kind and thoughtful host. We loved the neighborhood and its breathtaking views of Seattle.  The bedroom
was well appointed and so
nice. "
5956968,46060295,2015-09-07,27408260,Sanjay,"The space was just right for me, I only really needed a place to sleep during my visit to Seattle, and this spot fit the bill perfectly. The room was accessible through the garage and the private bathroom was useful. The house is in a really nice neighborhood and it's close to Kerry Park with great views of downtown Seattle from the top of the hill."
5956968,46583604,2015-09-12,31358718,Philippa And Mark,An accommodating host who makes it really easy for guests to come and go with their own access to a nicely set out heritage space. Great location in a beautiful neighbourhood with a great view over the city from nearby at Kerry Park. Not far from town and we found it really convenient for making our cruise ship connection.
5956968,47714930,2015-09-21,41094443,Nancy,"Our host was very welcoming and, though he was not there when we arrived, precise about the arrival instructions. Everything was clean and in good order, and he thoughtfully left us a day's supply of coffee and tea, and a pot for boiling water. We appreciated having a private entrance and nice bathroom; the bed was comfortable; the space was adequate, though a little cramped for two people. "
5956968,48845056,2015-09-28,5075831,Ciaran,"Andrew was great, and his house is beautiful. I'd recommend anyone to check out this part of town. There are great restaurants and coffee shops near by. Very quiet."

7714294,45504870,2015-09-03,37042912,Emily,"Elise was a wonderful host! The apartment was just as described, and we found it very beautiful, homey, clean, and convenient, and the photos don't even do justice to the gorgeous view! The neighborhood was wonderful, too--quiet and pretty, and with a great little coffee shop a very short walk away. Elise left a detailed note with information about the apartment, and we found everything we needed. The cat was an added bonus! I would absolutely recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
1495271,6827525,2013-08-26,8056911,Annie,My family and I truly enjoyed staying at Tatyana's home. It really made our trip to Seattle a success. She was very responsive and helpful both before and during our stay. We will definitely contact her again for our next trip to Seattle.
1495271,7045086,2013-09-04,8108931,Sharan,"Firstly the host Tatyana is quick and responsive. We didn't have a chance to meet her but she was very communicative. Thanks Tatyana.

We stayed there for 3 days and the place was great. The locality was nice, calm and pretty close to downtown. Parking is not at all a  problem

The house is well-furnished and fantastic. Its a 3 bedroom with large beds, cushions  and TV sets. A huge dinning place with equipped kitchen is a bonus if you ask. The two bathrooms are clean n comfy. 

Came across some good collection of books in the bedrooms. Pleasant atmosphere and cool surroundings.  Highly recommended and my first pick in Seattle."
1495271,19143044,2014-09-07,16928991,Ramona,Overall our experience was great. The house was large and comfortable for my big family of 7. The house is very close and convenient to shops and transportation.
1495271,41707531,2015-08-08,5298491,Ute,"Good choice. Tatyana was very helpful and we felt welcome at once. The house was nice, calm and pretty close to downtown, so it was no problem to use the bus. The neighbourhood was friendly with many shops and restaurants not far away. Tatyana´s house will be our choice for the next trip to Seattle. Thank you, Tatyana."
774659,3130683,2012-12-21,206203,Amanda,"I was privileged to be the first guest at Jake’s Modern Guest House and I highly recommend it. It is very unique, in a great neighborhood near Lake Washington and Columbia City, comfortable, wonderful bed, clean, a kitchen you can cook in, and high on the privacy scale. Jake and Laura were very nice, arrangements were easy, and I will definitely stay there again. Check it out for a great hotel alternative at a reasonable price."
774659,3366970,2013-01-18,206203,Amanda,"I travel to Seattle regularly and mostly use AirBNB for great places to stay. Jake's Place is definitely one of my favorites right now. Private, comfortable, and in an eclectic Seattle neighborhood within walking distance of Lake Washington and Columbia City. "
774659,3460776,2013-02-02,206203,Amanda,Wonderfully comfortable and private. My daughter joined me this trip and she loved it too.
774659,3494328,2013-02-07,2049764,Heather,"I had a brief stay at Jake's place but the space was wonderful.  It was very clean, quiet, and relaxing.  I loved style and furnishings of the unit and it is evident that Jake has put a lot of love into this place. The location was within an easy drive to downtown and the guesthouse is located on a cute and quiet street.  I can't wait to stay in the guesthouse again and maybe for a little longer timeframe. "
774659,3516330,2013-02-11,2176204,Michael,"This has been the most impressive designed/built airbnb house I've stayed at. Jake is a craftsman with amazing attention to detail. His approach is simple and clean. Every corner is well executed and tasteful. I spent all weekend appreciating how he: stained and finished the woods; exposed the framing; used contemporary robust materials (frameless glass, obscured acrylic, glass tiles, concrete); provided ample light and views; and created a voluminous loft-like feeling in a relatively compact structure. I especially liked the intimate dining banquet ""cube"" within the space which doubled as a sofa backrest/canopy and also served to shield the kitchen. Even my kids could appreciate the architecture-and they are airbnb veterans. I was also pleasantly surprised in discovering Mt Baker/Columbia City. The kids and I loved the lake Washington Bike Trail, starting from Genesse Park, as well as the loop trail at Seward park. It also looks like there is beach swimming in the warm summer months at Seward. What views, and no crowds like other parks/trails closer to town. The locale is just a 15 drive to the city center but we decided to soak in  the eclectic, historic, and multi-ethnic, neighborhood instead. Great baked goods at the Columbia City bakery (thanks Laura), tasty dim sum at Joy Palace, and historic buildings.  We'll have to return for breakfast at Geraldine's or dinner at one of the many Ethiopian restaurants. Laura was helpful with questions and the whole experience was easy. We'll be back."
774659,3545081,2013-02-15,206203,Amanda,"This is a great choice for a hotel alternative. I have stayed at Jake's Place a few times now and it is my top choice for Seattle stays. It is unique, clean, comfortable, and situated in an interesting, eclectic Seattle neighborhood. "
774659,3658550,2013-03-01,206203,Amanda,Very nice place and Jake and Laura are friendly pleasant hosts. Everything is very clean and comfortable. I am always pleased when I find Jake's place available.
774659,3776628,2013-03-13,3077109,Rhiannon,Jake was a fantastic host. He went out of his way to be accommodating and even picked us up at the light rail station when we arrived. The guest house was clean and beautifully made with lots of interesting and charming little details. I highly recommend Jake's Guesthouse! 
774659,4808072,2013-05-27,4742780,Doug,"Jake's place is very nice. It is in an interesting residential part of town and nice and quiet, and the house compliments this by being a nice place to relax. It is best suited for 1 or 2 people. Any more and it might be a little noisy, as sounds tend amplify since everything is made of wood without insulation. The wood and antique gas stove provide a very cool ""cabin"" feel. Jake and Laura live next door and were very good about asking us if we needing anything whenever they saw us. Overall, I'm really glad that we stayed here instead of a hotel."
774659,5086894,2013-06-11,4007151,Annie,"Jake and Laura's guest house was lovely.  It was clean and spacious and great for 2 people.  Located a little ways away from the city, but with easy access to I-5.  Very safe and quiet neighbourhood, close to groceries, a plethora of Pho restaurants.  We loved it!  Thank you, Jake and Laura for your hospitality!  "
774659,5155384,2013-06-15,238142,Rose,"Jake has a beautiful rental he built where his garage used to stand. He did an amazing job finishing all the woodwork, even building the furniture. He is also a very pleasant person who wishes to do what he can to make guests feel at home. It is a ""one of a kind"" property. "
774659,5596559,2013-07-08,3939856,Andrea,"Jake's Place was quiet and clean. We appreciated having our own home to spread out in. Jake was laid back and helpful. Convenient, short drive to downtown Seattle. We'd stay again!"

We brought our two kids and Jake and Laura were thoughtful enough to set up an air mattress for the kids. The place was very close to the train station and we parked and got downtown very easy. when we come to Seattle again, I hope that Jake's place is available!"
774659,14756099,2014-06-25,13583697,Dave,Very nice loft apartment. Quiet neighborhood. Will stay again.
774659,15339446,2014-07-07,5178705,Tana,"Not only did we fall in love with this place based on the pictures, this truly is a guesthouse to visit and see in person! We couldn't be more happier with our stay here and can't recommend it enough. The modern and minimalist interior design and concrete floors were very appreciated and we were very impressed to learn that Jake had designed and built this place himself! 

We enjoyed walking in downtown Columbia City (very charming!) and lake, making dinners in the kitchen, and relaxing in the lounge area. Truly a retreat with just a short drive into the city centre."
774659,15590264,2014-07-12,15693109,David,"Jake and Laura were both quite accommodating. Their responses were quick and friendly. The listing was fantastic! It was as-described and as-shown, but that doesn't really do it justice. The overall design of the upper loft area made for a very enjoyable visit. Nothing felt cramped or out-of-place, and the custom design made it memorable. Compelled to say that the BED was AMAZING. My wife passed out on it as soon as we got in, didn't move for several hours, and hinted that I might have to crash upstairs so that she could monopolize it. She wasn't kidding.. most comfortable bed I've ever stayed at away from home and I'm picky about my sleeping gear. The kitchen was great and had everything we needed. "
774659,17157185,2014-08-08,17296176,Sonja,"Beautiful guesthouse - really unique and tasteful woodwork and design.  The place was clean & in a nice neighborhood location, walkable to Columbia City.  Host was polite and easy to communicate with."
774659,17583099,2014-08-14,817509,Kas,Very quiet and clean place. Just far enough from downtown Seattle for us. Great attention to detail in this guesthouse. We'll be back. 
774659,18405256,2014-08-26,4671086,Richard,"I can't speak highly enough of our stay at Jake's Place. The space was more than enough for 2 people. Big open lofted ceilings, lots of windows and natural light. I loved sitting on the balcony sipping coffee in the morning. We were a few blocks away from a beautiful park and lake where we went on morning runs. The street parking was easy. Only a 15 minute drive into the city. We would definitely come back."
774659,18944819,2014-09-03,17945339,Lewis,The cabin is really well built!  Very sweet place to stay. There has been no issue at all. Thank you!
774659,19146161,2014-09-07,19907212,Kian,"The house is spacious and looks nice on the inside. On the first floor, you'll find a bed, the bathroom, and a closet. On the second floor are the balcony, a couch, a TV, kitchen and dining area, and BOOKS! Nice addition to this lovely house.
I was able to speak to Jake on our second day stay, and had fun petting his cat and his dog, Posey (I don't know if I spelled that right). This really is a great place to stay. More bang for your buck! This is my first ever reservation on Airbnb, and was delighted by the value and space I got, compared to renting a hotel room. You get a HOUSE. What more could I say? Would definitely consider staying here again in my future trips to Seattle!"
774659,19377816,2014-09-11,20079513,Stephen,"We felt very welcome and appreciated.  The cozy cabin like feel that the guest house had was awesome. The bed was comfortable, everything was clean and the pets were nice! Thank you Jake"
774659,19679963,2014-09-16,16590547,Lauren,"This was a great place to stay! We were greeted by Laura when we first arrived, and she was very welcoming (as was Jake when we met him later)! The neighborhood was very quaint, and close to most everything we did. I'd definitely recommend this to people wanting a private spot while visiting Seattle."
774659,19916034,2014-09-20,12089270,Thomas,Jake and his wife were very pleasant and offered a good recommendation for sushi. The place itself is quite nice and is priced very well relative to everything else I saw in the area. The antique oven is awesome and the guesthouse as a whole has a nice vibe to it. I would definitely stay again if I was passing through Seattle. 
774659,21267254,2014-10-13,22316759,Rolando,This place is amazing I love the feel. Jake was great and easy going host. The neighborhood was nice and quiet. I would totally stay here again. 
774659,21351284,2014-10-15,16757829,David,"The location and neighborhood were great and so was the space and we loved sitting on the balcony in the evenings.  It was easy to access all the areas we were wanting to visit without a lot of traffic to and from the house, even during rush hour times.  A large Safeway and Starbucks are a short walk away.  "
774659,21605851,2014-10-20,6031151,Lindsay,"This casita is nestled in the Columbia City neighborhood.  About a 15-20 minute walk from the light rail, and 10 - 15 minute walk to Lake Washington for swims in the summer and glorious walks or runs all year.  It is charmingly appointed, warm, and easy to access.  I enjoyed meeting Jake and little Posey, and he generously allowed me to check in a little early."
774659,21804411,2014-10-24,2373094,Ernest,"Jake's Guesthouse was a perfect little oasis for our family. It's super comfortable, and nicely appointed. He provided a baby gate for us, and recommended a couple great neighbourhood secrets."
774659,22035738,2014-10-28,22211291,Michelle,"The guesthouse was immaculate and we were quite comfortable.
Very charming neighborhood and convenient for our needs.
Thanks, Jake."
774659,24549162,2014-12-30,899251,Paula,"Jake's Place is amazing: comfortable, quiet, well equipped, thoughtfully designed. The bed is fabulous, and there is light everywhere, from carefully placed windows and skylights, on both cloudy and sunny days. We enjoyed walking around the neighborhood to a nearby grocery and to see houses and gardens in the area. Jake was very welcoming and helpful. We highly recommend this guest house and would gladly stay here again."
774659,26032055,2015-02-01,2772785,New,"The two story cottage is  South of Seattle just south of Beacon Hill area. In Mt. Baker. The cottage is set on a lot next to the main house in the back of the property. There is plenty of street parking, the cottage is fenced in and is hand built by the owner with many custom features. If your interested in staying in a ""Green Built"" space this is the one! As you walk in, the bottom floor is polished concrete with radiant heat floors in the bedroom and bathroom. It stays at a perfect temperature. The bed is so comfortable with fluffy down feathers and white soft combed cotton sheets. There is plenty of closet space for even longer stays. The upstairs is white washed pine floors with a fully equipped kitchen, built in breakfast nook and living space with a balcony off the front with clear views on sunny days. I know you will enjoy this cozy NW cottage. Jake was very nice and helpful when requests were made."
774659,41928878,2015-08-10,4107683,Alex,Jake's Place was amazing! The house is walking distance from a grocery store and has a full kitchen which was great. Interaction with Jake and Laura was accessible but not intrusive. The place was clean and well furnished and just a short walk to public transit. I'll definitely be staying here for all my future visits to Seattle. Thanks Jake!
774659,47621516,2015-09-21,5186120,Karen,"Jake was responsive and quick to answer questions from the moment I worked on making the reservation. The day of our arrival Jake let me know that everything was ready and that we could go ahead and let ourselves in whenever we needed to. 

The apartment is spotless, modern yet cozy, well equipped and in a very quiet and calm neighborhood. Rainier Ave is just a few blocks away and has lots of restaurants, bakeries etc. There are also a couple of good grocery stores walking distance away. 

Whenever I had any questions, Jake was available for calls/a knock on his door and helped us out. 

I highly recommend Jake's place and hope to be back sometime!"
774659,48749117,2015-09-28,42271782,Shai,"My husband and I really enjoyed  the guesthouse. The location was great, and as some of the others reviews mention, it was really nice to get out of the city after spending the day being a tourist. I also really appreciate the flexible check in and check out process and being able to communicate easily with the owners. I would certainly recommend staying in their rental to anyone visiting the area."
774659,50470581,2015-10-12,41953061,Anna,"This was an exceptional place to stay while visiting Seattle. It was a short drive (or walk, if you're ambitious) from the downtown area. Everything we needed was included... hairdryer, extra towels/bedding, all kitchen amenities. Cable was a nice extra, but we didn't even use the TV--too much to do! :) The place was very neat, immaculate bedding and flooring, and cozy. Please do note that there is one large (queen or king sized) bed, but the upstairs bed is a twin space and it isn't a regular mattress. The upstairs twin space was very comfortable, but keep this in mind if traveling with more people. Overall, this was a great stay, and I look forward to staying there again in the future!"
774659,53367543,2015-11-08,34482053,Del,Jake made our stay very welcomed. He showed us around his detached apartment and was available at any time.  The apartment was just as he described and the neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance to a park and Washington Lake. There was always plenty of street parking.
774659,54664854,2015-11-22,22652252,Alexander,"Beautiful property, very neat and clean. Jake accommodated a late check-in for me with no problem. 

Absolutely no complaints at all. "
774659,58369317,2016-01-02,15706273,Chee Heng,"The house is simple and minimalist design but fully equipped with everything that we need. The kitchen is the highlight, plenty of pots and pans are provided, more than enough to prepare a simple dinner. The location is good, close to supermarket and restaurants."
7871885,44383007,2015-08-25,36306062,Georgia,Super cute studio in a beautiful neighborhood in Capitol Hill.  I requested a very last minute reservation and Eric was very quick with his response to me.  The studio was very clean and exactly as the photos showed it.  My daughter and I really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend it to others.
7871885,44601529,2015-08-27,20757958,Samuel,"Eric is an absolutely wonderful host and the carriage house is downright delightful. Just all around sweet, comfortable and welcoming! From the easy access late night arrival, to the totally private and serene space, to the super comfortable bed, to the lovely bathroom and kitchenette...what else can i say? homemade cookies (oops, I said it!) awaiting our arrival! This is definitely the best spot on Capitol Hill and Eric and Amy are definitely the best hosts - without a doubt - highly recommended!"
7871885,45616080,2015-09-04,8609337,Everard & Carol,"Eric is a gracious, flexible, congenial and accommodating host, providing directions and the niceties that make one feel welcomed in his Carriage House.  The listing was as advertised, well apportioned, clean, comfortable well decorated and certainly met our needs.  The location is great, since we were able to easily navigate to some of the major Seattle’s areas points of interest (downtown, Space Needle, etc.) and the quiet neighborhood is easily accessible.  Perhaps our litmus test is if would we stay there again, to which we will definitely say yes!"
7871885,45858423,2015-09-06,8637688,Sarah,"Such a great spot! Surrounded by so much green, and completely private from the home, this is a great cozy space. This Carriage House is set far back from a beautiful residential and quiet street. Pictures don't even do it justice! Very clean, private, and secure. It's also in a great central location. If visiting Seattle, I highly recommend this spot in Capitol Hill. 

Eric is fantastic, and a very welcoming host. Turns out... he's also an incredible chef! If you're lucky (I was!), maybe you'll get to try some of his homemade pizza from the brick oven he built in his backyard. "
7871885,47080331,2015-09-15,18195970,Pam,"Hi fellow travelers, whether you're traveling as a single or couple,  I strongly recommend Eric's Carriage House!  The house itself is adorable, very clean, bright and airy.  It's located in a quite neighborhood with lots of street parking.  I noticed a bus line 2 blocks away.  Eric is a perfect host, quick to respond to emails, texts, and phone calls.   Hopefully the Carriage House will be available, the next time I visit Seattle.  Thank you Eric & Amy!"
7871885,48115254,2015-09-23,12120656,Magnus,"We give Eric our highest recommendations, everything was as he had described it and then some!

Before we arrived Eric mentioned that he had learned hon to make swedish bread when he was in Sweden.  I joked about it and said that I looked forward to tasting it when we arrived.  To our surprise he did have some home made knäckebröd (hard bread from Sweden).  It was fantastic just like the carriage house as well.  We really enjoyed our stay at Eric's and felt right at home.  Friendly and professional and with a great location just outside of the central Seattle. "
7871885,51317473,2015-10-19,44275131,Carl,"Eric's carriage house was the perfect place for our stay in Seattle.  My wife and I spent 2 days there, and we couldn't have been more pleased. Eric's property is located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood of Capitol Hill. The carriage house is totally private, and you will feel at home from the moment you arrive.

 It was also extremely easy to navigate to downtown attractions. The bus line is close by, and nothing is more than a $10 uber fare. Also, Eric provided us wonderful recommendations to nearby restaurants (The Wandering Goose is a must for amazing breakfast). Eric was a very flexible and attentive host. I doubt this will be our last visit to the carriage house!"
7871885,51643445,2015-10-22,45675760,Maureen,This was our first Airbnb experience. Eric was very helpful in walking us through the process and making for a smooth reservation. His Carriage House is delightful. It is light and sunny and very quiet. It is in an established Capital Hill neighborhood and proved to be very convenient for our stay in Seattle. We did not meet Eric until we left but he was available by text and phone and ready to be of service as we needed. We would definitely recommend his charming place to friends!
7871885,51802245,2015-10-24,3536281,Doreen,The carriage house was perfect for our stay in Seattle. Eric made it super easy to check in (just need to enter a code to unlock the door). The neighborhood is absolutely gorgeous. The bed was really comfy. 
7871885,52238058,2015-10-27,2685740,Danielle,"The Carriage House was perfect for our weekend trip to Seattle and Eric was a great host! He was helpful ahead of time in the planning, had a list of recommended places in the area and left us a Seattle food guide – not to mention a plate of cookies, too! 

The Carriage House was actually quite spacious (even for two girls with lots of luggage!). There was a bed (queen or full?), a small table and chairs, large bathroom with stand-up shower and kitchenette with plates, cups, coffee maker, etc. Would be the perfect spot for a couple or two friends. 

The neighborhood was GORGEOUS and felt totally safe parking and walking around, even at night. We did occasionally walk to and from restaurants / shopping, but eventually found it easier to drive or call an Uber. 

Would definitely stay at the Carriage House again, and would recommend it to others!"
7871885,52999780,2015-11-03,46580921,Mike,Our stay was very nice. The house was as described.  It was a very pretty place in a beautiful neighborhood.  Eric came out to greet us when we arrived and let us know he was available to answer any questions and ensure we had a nice visit. 
7871885,53657607,2015-11-10,932687,Susan,The carriage house was completely lovely and comfortable to stay in. The perfect location from which to explore Seattle. Eric and his wife were very responsive and helpful! 
7871885,54198531,2015-11-16,5421780,Elisa,The carriage house is so cute and cozy. It is very private and really feels like home. The house is super clean and everything you need is there. Buses are easy to catch to go to other parts of the town. Great experience!
2614387,11384284,2014-03-31,3543211,Ian,Sandy was a fantastic host! She gave us great advice on restaurants and activities in the Fremont/Ballard areas which are both great neighborhoods which we had never previously explored. Sandy is very warm and personable and we felt very comfortable staying in her home. Our private room and bathroom were very clean and comfortable. We will definitely stay with her again on future trips to Seattle.
2614387,12320502,2014-04-28,11216884,Dana,"Sandy made us feel so welcomed and comfortable. The room is beautiful with one of the most comfortable beds I've slept in and a lovely full bath within the privacy of the room. Not only is Sandy's location perfect (right by Fremont restaurants and shops and a few minutes from Greenlake!), but she is a wonderful person who, I can tell, appreciates guests and finds joy in sharing her space. Thanks!!"
2614387,12676161,2014-05-07,8354912,Serena,"We have been travelling for almost 3 solid months, and have used airbnb the entire trip. We have met some amazing people, and stayed in some beautiful homes. However, our experience at Sandy's went above and beyond anything we have seen so far, and was one of the most memorable parts of our trip. Sandy is such a wonderful, kind, interesting and welcoming person - we were looking for a room, but she really made Seattle home for us. She made us a beautiful dinner, took us out to see a great movie at a really hip little cinema, gave us hot tips on local food and attractions, took us for a lovely walk along the water with 2 of the greatest dogs in the world - Jax and Roux. In addition, Fremont itself is a spectacular neighbourhood. We had been to seattle before, and stayed in Downtown and loved it. However, Fremont has got to be one of the greatest things about Seattle - so much food, history, culture, creativity, music and vibrancy - we couldn't get enough. Finally, the house itself is delightful - super comfy bed, great wifi, great location, great bathroom (ensuite!). Thanks Sandy! We miss you already!"
2614387,12961234,2014-05-15,14100034,Bryan,"I had an excellent stay at Sandy's place! Everything was clean, and the location is great for traveling to other parts of Seattle by bus!

Sandy had lots of great tourism material around for those not from the area.
She was also a great conversationalist.

I would definitely recommend staying at Sandy's house!"
2614387,14189822,2014-06-14,854120,Emily,"We very much enjoyed our stay with Sandy. Her home is in a lovely location, within walking distance of many fun things as well as near bus lines that will take you all over the city. Sandy was very friendly and went out of her way to make my husband and I feel welcome in the Seattle area.  "
2614387,14785104,2014-06-26,15613715,Eva,"It was my first time in Airbnb and I had a great experience thanks to Sandy that is an excellent host, very friendly and always having an interesting conversation and good suggestions for going around Seattle. Her cute house is clean and neat and the bedroom with private bath is VERY comfortable. The location is very good too, in a pretty neighborhood and shops, restaurants and bus-stops are at walking distance."
2614387,15398443,2014-07-08,15064141,John.,"My  stay with Sandy was exactly what I hoped for.  The private room and bath were very clean, airy and comfortable (especially the bed). Once in my room, I heard virtually no noise whatsoever.  The location was perfect for me.  I felt completely safe in this upscale neighborhood. There are plenty of places to eat, including good coffee shops, all within walking distance.  Sandy was very cordial and helpful.  She is a neat lady, educated and interesting.  Without question I would stay here again.  It made my stay in Seattle quite enjoyable. 
John"
2614387,15911719,2014-07-18,1110976,Roseanne,"Sandy was very welcoming and gracious and allowed us to leave our massive luggage at her place while sightseeing for the day as we had just got off a cruise ship and didn't know what to do with it.  It was prior to our check-in time.  We enjoyed our time with the dogs ""Jax"" and ""Roux"" (missed our dogs) and riding city transit and walking all around the neighborhood and the town of Seattle.  The room was very private with its own bathroom and closet, no television and upstairs.  It would be best suited for the lighter packed traveler(s). "
2614387,16832182,2014-08-03,15690939,Thiago,"I and my girlfriend spent excellent times at Sandy’s house. It was a pleasure to meet Sandy, who is friendly, helpful, and easy-going. Everything in the house is very clean and matches exactly with the announcement. The bedroom is excellent and we had plenty of privacy. Additionally, the neighborhood is amazing, with many bars, cafes, and restaurants. The house is pretty close to the university (15 minutes by foot or 5 minutes by bus) and it is very easy to catch buses from home to downtown.  In summary, I recommend the place!"
2614387,17045970,2014-08-06,2515458,Josephine,Sandy was a wonderful host with great information about the area. The room was comfortable and the location was perfect for getting around to many sights.
2614387,17166477,2014-08-08,17958240,Ben,"Staying at Sandy's was great, couldn't have asked for a better experience. Sandy was awesome and went above and beyond to help us out when we had a traveling schedule mixup as well. She was incredibly understanding and we couldn't be more grateful. It really made all the difference. She was also incredibly helpful when it came to navigating around the neighborhood and other local parts of Seattle.

We couldn't have asked for anything better in terms of location, cleanliness, and hospitality.

Thanks again, Sandy!"
2614387,17347541,2014-08-11,16388806,Sarah,"Staying at Sandy's was wonderful. She was so thoughtful, and was so fun to be around. We loved chatting with her about Seattle. She has great suggestions about sight-seeing places as well as local neighborhood joints. The room was comfortable and relaxing, the perfect place to come back to after a long day of sight seeing and exploring. Thanks Sandy! "
2614387,17510423,2014-08-13,5423866,Gina,"Sandy was a lovely host. She was warm and welcoming, and generous with her time and knowledge of the city. The location is very good - walkable to great food and shops in the heart of Fremont and central to many other neighborhoods. The room is spacious and clean, and the bed comfortable. Sandy made a generous amount of space in the refrigerator and the cupboard, and gave us access to her washer/dryer which was very helpful. There is a walk-in closet that was large enough for our travel crib. A couple small details made it feel less polished than some other airbnb's we've stayed in - there was old soap in the shower, a lamp shaded with computer paper and wrapped with tin foil, and curtain rods that weren't secured to the wall. Our second night it was unseasonably warm in Seattle (high of 93) and it was very hot in the room. The fan in the window didn't do enough to lower the temp and our baby would not sleep for hours and woke up sweating in the middle of the night. If you plan to come in August, be aware this may be an issue as there is no a/c and it's on the second floor. We were very uncomfortable and up half the night - I think the lack of a/c could have been mentioned in the listing, but I understand it's uncommon in Seattle. If it hadn't been so hot I think we would have had a much better experience."
2614387,17628383,2014-08-15,17596604,Emily,"Sandy was wonderful and so hospitable! She welcomed us and shared lots of ideas with us of what to do in the area and in Seattle. She even had typed up restaurants and fun things to do and left it in our room! It was very helpful! Fremont was such a cool city to check out that we could walk to from her house! The room was wonderful too! So clean, spacious, and cool! So nice to have a bathroom in the room as well! Her dog was super sweet too! We enjoyed getting to know her while we were there and felt very comfortable in her home! It was a wonderful experience!! "
2614387,17916226,2014-08-18,19866506,Atara,"We had an amazing time staying with Sandy. Her home is in a great location and she is knowledgable about the neighborhood and city. She is super friendly and full of helpful answers and suggestions. If we were back in Seattle, we would definitely stay here again. "
2614387,18070543,2014-08-21,18423055,Marci,We had a great time staying at Sandy's. She was super helpful with where to go and what to see. Her room was clean and comfy and the bathroom was perfect. The location could not have been any better. Sandy was friendly and helpful and a great host. We had great ventilation And were not hot or cold. It was perfect for us! Thank you so much Sandy!
2614387,18207133,2014-08-23,2619048,Kelly,"Friendly host, Great Location, Would recommend and hope to stay again before too long.

Very knowlegable about local attractions, restaurants, etc.

Comfortable Bed ;)

A gracious host and a comfortable room in a great spot.  Highly recommended."
2614387,18484475,2014-08-27,12696698,Raphaela,Sandy is a lovely person and she was a great host. We only stayed two nights in Sandy's gorgeous house but we really enjoyed it.  The Fermont neighborhood is really nice and Sandy had great recommendations what to do and where to eat. Would love to stay there again! 
2614387,18549885,2014-08-28,18486558,Saurabh,We had a great time at Sandy's house. She is a great host and always welcomes you with a big smile. The room itself was very good and had everything one would need. The location of the house was great and parking on the street easy to find. Thank you Sandy for making our first airbnb experience worthwhile.
2614387,18716862,2014-08-31,906683,Memo,"Sandy's house is lovely and the room & private bath offered in this listing is absolutely wonderful. Felt more like a Bed & Breakfast (minus the breakfast) in its luxury and amenities. We had a wonderful stay at Sandy's house, it was within walking distance to Fremont, Gas Works Park, Fremont Brewery, and the Wallingford neighborhood. We highly recommend this gem of a room, and Sandy was a gracious & accommodating host."
2614387,18882932,2014-09-02,17701495,Heiko,We had such a wonderful time staying with Sandy. She was very welcoming and made huge effort to make our short stay in Seattle very worthwhile.

I will stay with her again when I am in town."
2614387,19269125,2014-09-09,17941771,Joan,Sandy was very gracious.  The room and facility were as described.  I loved the location.  It was very convenient.  Close to the bus line.  Close to Fremont district.
2614387,19471450,2014-09-13,19265578,Jodie,"Great home base for our Seattle visit!
Sandy made things easy by staying in contact before we arrived and she was able to accommodate our needs. Sandy's  recommendations for Fremont neighbourhood and Seattle were great, especially pagliacci pizza, the view from  gasworks park and the Chihuly Glass museum. It was great to feel at home in the neighborhood. We felt like we had insider knowledge to explore the area.
The room was adequate and clean. We enjoyed the large ensuite bathroom and the walk in closet space.
The two friendly dogs were a great addition to our stay once they quickly got used to us.  "
2614387,19594189,2014-09-15,4963551,Amanda,"Sandy made us feel very welcome in her home. Her home was modern, clean, and comfortable. Check-in was very easy. The location is on a quiet street with easy to find parking in the evening, and not far from downtown with a car. The en-suite bathroom was a plus, as was the walk-in closet. Her dog Jax is very friendly and well-mannered. We would highly recommend Sandy's place.  She's a great host!"

I was welcomed in and felt entirely comfortable from the beginning of my stay until the end. I wish I could have stayed longer! I'll definitely be back should I be in town again."
2614387,19902435,2014-09-20,16825801,Caitlin,"Both Sandy and her place were great! The room was as very clean and cute. Excellent location in the Fremont area. We were able to walk to everything we wanted to see and it was super easy to catch a bus into other neighborhoods as well. Sandy was an excellent host. She was gracious, friendly and helpful. We had a good time chatting with her and she had lots of suggestions for nearby places to eat. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others."
2614387,20415224,2014-09-29,17876487,Sue,Had a great stay at Sandy's Airbnb! We were dropping off our son for college and the location was great! Close to SPU. Bonus was so many restaurants and shopping within walking distance and the bus stop was down the street. Sandy is a wonderful host and made us feel welcome the minute we walked in. Jax(her dog) is the sweetest thing ever!!  The place was spotless! Will stay here when we come back to visit!! Thanks Sandy

Everything was very modern, clean and comfortable and the room was very nice.  It was great to have a private bathroom.  Each room also had its own heater so that you could control the temperature according to your personal liking.  There was a nice walk-in closet that I could throw my suitcase in and still keep the room nice looking.  The home is located in a vibrant part of town, very close to Fremont, DT Seattle, the Space Needle, etc.  There are lots of restaurants, bars, coffee shops within walking distance.

Sandy took a time to chat with me and I really enjoyed that.  We had a lot to talk about and I'm sure I'll try to stay at her place again if available.  Thank you Sandy!"
2614387,23055882,2014-11-21,19301223,Florian,"I had an amazing time staying with Sandy! The accommodation is probably one of the best i have ever had! The bed (with tons of pillows) is super cosy and the enclosed bathroom simply perfect! The whole place gives you a very warm and welcoming feeling. It only takes 10mins to get to downtown by bus and the station is just 1min walk from the house. Whenever you stay there, make sure you ask Sandy about some ideas for sightseeing or dining - she knows so much about the city and what it has to offer that it is just great listening to her. I wish my schedule would have allowed me to stay longer but i will definitely come back to stay again. I can highly recommend this place!!"
2614387,23820576,2014-12-11,13356443,Jim,We had a wonderful experience.  Sandy met us and walked us through the amenities describing anything we needed to know about the facility.  She was very personable making us feel perfectly welcome all the time.  We hope to return in the near future.
2614387,24161625,2014-12-21,16089455,Peter,Sandy was very welcoming and a pleasure to talk to. I'd be happy to stay there again.
2614387,24584794,2014-12-31,2215746,Kin And Avena,"Sandy is an amazing host. We are already missing her and want to be back! The neighborhood was so adorable, it has a huge range of restaurants and bakeries within walking distance and also well connected by public transport. Downtown is just a short 3 miles away. 

The room is very warm and cozy and everyday we looked forward to coming back for a good nights rest. The in-suite bathroom makes it even more convenient. Sandy greeted us with open arms and made us feel so at home. She gave us all the info of the nearby areas and the city and gave us some nice tips for our own travel around the city.  Highly recommended to all! A+++"
2614387,24954014,2015-01-04,10968528,Abby,We had a great time at Sandy's home.  She made us feel very welcome.  The room was very comfortable with a private bath.  Sandy made a real effort to help her guests know the area and find interesting places to visit.  The Fremont area felt safe and there was a lot to do in the neighborhood.   We would definitely stay with Sandy again.
2614387,25309198,2015-01-12,23011848,Ye,sandy是超级超级nice的妈咪哈哈 社区安静，安全，交通方便，附近有超市。最重要的是小房间很温馨！！！！每个细节都给我留下深刻印象哈！
2614387,25647778,2015-01-21,23959024,Ernest,"My first experience with AirBnB and it was a great one!  Sandy was very welcoming and we would chat before and after each day of travel in Seattle.  

Sandy is extremely knowledgeable about the area and easily made my idea of planning (Day 1 - Pike Place Market) into (Day 1 - Pike Place Market, Rachael the Pig, Fish Toss, Under the Market shops, Storyville, Farmer's Market, Fran Chocolatier, Bubble Gum Wall, Pike Place Brewery, Seattle Art Museum, Post Alley, Original Starbucks, Piroshki, Bleecher's Cheese).

Would recommend!  Thanks Sandy!"
2614387,25808925,2015-01-26,25792422,Sara,"Sandy was such a kind and gracious host. She (and her adorable dogs) made us feel comfortable and welcome in her home right from the get go. The room was spacious with tons of storage (bureau + walk-in closest), lovely bathroom, and large window with lots of light (yes, it was sunny during out stay- in January!). She had a whole bunch of great recommendations for things to do and places to eat all over town. She also provides a list of hand picked, highly recommended restaurants and attractions right there in the neighborhood. And what a cool neighborhood it is. She's right around the corner from tons of fun shops, markets, coffee shops, restaurants, and last but certainly not least the Theo chocolate factory! We had an amazing time and can't wait to come back. I'd recommend this place to anyone thinking about visiting Seattle. Cool neighborhood, fun and easy going host, and lots to do in the area! Thanks for everything, Sandy!"
2614387,26165878,2015-02-05,4453967,Marc,"We truly enjoyed our week-long stay at Sandy’s home. The room is quiet and very comfortable, with a great bed and a nice, private bathroom, and we appreciated access to the kitchen to prepare light meals and tea. We found the location ideal - the home is located within walking distance to plenty of restaurants, a nice grocery store, and a cool brewery, and also near public transportation. Sandy is a great host - she was always ready to provide sightseeing suggestions or restaurant recommendations (and she even found a nearby yoga studio for my girlfriend), and we really enjoyed chatting with her."
2614387,26345630,2015-02-09,26821966,Richard,"This is a wonderful place to stay. The name says it all,  things are really, really close!  We have been driving all day long the day before so the idea of leaving the car behind and walking to the nearby Fremont District and Gas Works Park was appealing.  Sandy was very kind and very generous with her time. The room itself was very comfortable and it had its own little bathroom.  "
2614387,26629107,2015-02-16,12621338,Andrew,"Sandy was an amazing host.  The place is exactly like the pictures and her attentiveness to everything was perfect.  The room was clean and the chocolates placed on the pillow when we arrived was sweet.  Furthermore, the area was quiet, easy to find and had a lovely view and it was around 15 minutes drive from downtown Seattle. She provided many suggestions to delicious restaurants, lounges and tourist spots for us to consider which was helpful.  I will definitely recommend her to my friends if they stay in Seattle."
2614387,26767597,2015-02-18,21655594,Raul,"I had a great stay with Sandy and Jax.  Sandy is so warm and welcoming and Jax is a sweetie.  Sandy was super helpful with recommendations for places in her neighborhood. There is so much within short walking distance that having help navigating is helpful.  The home is on a quite street with easy parking.  The bed in my room was beyond comfortable. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle. 
"
2614387,26880143,2015-02-21,27114386,Robin (Glenna),"Sally made me feel very welcome, right away. I enjoyed her sweet and friendly personality, her pleasure in showing me and telling me about her beloved Fremont neighborhood, and how lovely and comforting my room was. It was really *easy* to stay there. A particularly helpful feature was that I didn't have to keep track of any keys; the front door access works with a numeric code. 
Next time I need a room in Seattle, I'll be sure to stay with Sally if I can!
"
2614387,27031038,2015-02-23,602283,Megan,"I live in an apartment in the neighborhood and booked with Sandy when my grandparents visited recently. She was a very accommodating, friendly, and helpful host. The house/room were clean, organized, and welcoming. My in-laws have stayed with her previously and have only positive things to say about the experience. I now recommend all of my visiting friends/families to book with her. "
2614387,27214286,2015-02-28,24323936,Keith,"The room was neat, well-equipped, and lovely. Very comfortable bed and beautiful bathroom. This is an especially convenient location, within walking distance of several excellent restaurants, and right around the corner from the facility I was visiting for a business training. The property was quiet and clean. Sandy was delightful-- available for a morning chat over tea when that was right for me, and perfectly supportive of my need for space when that's what mattered. Highly recommended! I would definitely book another stay next time I visit the Fremont area of Seattle."
2614387,27367233,2015-03-02,1822776,Brooke,Sandy was extremely kind and accommodating.  Adorable house in fabulous location.  Thanks so much!  
2614387,27733208,2015-03-10,25716688,Sandra,"Sandy was a great host!  She met us on time and was very welcoming.  She shared local information about restaurants, public transportation, attractions, etc.  The accommodations were awesome....clean and well appointed room, very quiet, easy to get to and free parking abound.  Her place is very convenient for any events in downtown Seattle, Fremont, Wallingford, Ballard and even the University of WA.  We were in town for the PAC 12 Womens Tournament and were able to easily get to Key Arena daily for the games.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay with her again."
2614387,27835908,2015-03-13,26070096,Ruthie,"My friend and I had a very pleasant stay at Sandy's house during our spring break. The actual room is exactly like the pictures. The room is very cozy and clean and it has a lot of storage space if you plan to stay for longer period. Sandy is a very nice lady and her dogs are well disciplined and friendly. The location is quiet, walkable distance to the bus stops (buses to downtown Seattle only takes 20 mins, less than 10 mins to the closest grocery store, and 30 mins walk to the UW campus) , and very pretty in Spring. Overall we highly recommend to stay at Sandy's place if you plan to visit Seattle. "

2614387,28225161,2015-03-20,28525147,Priscil,Sandy is a very pleasant lady. I had problems with my arrival time and changed it for a couple times. She tried her best to cater to my needs. The neighbourhood is very safe and fun! There is a bus stop just a couple minutes away from the location. Awesome experience! Would definitely stay with Sandy again if I happen to visit Seattle in the future.
2614387,28608322,2015-03-27,27978516,Maggie,"Thank you, Sandy, for a wonderful stay in Seattle! We were more than comfortable in your home, and loved the location most of all. Easy access to both Fremont and Wallingford was quite the perk. Thanks again! "

2614387,30046394,2015-04-16,24727285,Nick,"I've stayed with Sandy a number of times now, however, this was my first stay in this particular room.  The only real difference between the rooms, is this room has a bigger bed. The bed is comfortable and Sandy was great as always.  This is my favorite place to stay in Seattle."
2614387,30391179,2015-04-21,11004793,Wendie,Sandy was great. Beautiful room and bathroom in the best neighborhood ever. Walking to breakfast and dinners was great. 
2614387,30696841,2015-04-26,21879118,Leila,"The room was clean and quiet, as described, in a safe and upscale neighborhood. Sandy is kind, intellectual and helpful. I loved her friendly dog! Fremont is an interesting and liberal neighborhood with lots of public arts and trendy restaurants. I liked the view to Lake Union from Fremont Neighborhood. Sandy gave me lots of advice for what to do in Seattle. Thank you Sandy!"

2614387,32051462,2015-05-13,21791408,Christine,"I really enjoy staying with Sandy! This has been my second time and both occasions were great experiences. Sandy's really easy going and open minded. Very helpful in every regard. Both her available rooms are clean and comfortable, with ample closet space to boot! The location is perfect for what I need to do in North Seattle. Her house is close to public transit and easy walking/driving distance to amenities. I look forward to staying with Sandy many more times in the future! "
2614387,32530549,2015-05-19,30878500,David,"Sandy met us at the door when we arrived and made us feel right at home. She succinctly provided us with all the information we need and showed us to our room. The queen bed was very comfortable. The room had its own temperature control, which is a nice feature. Nice bathroom with an excellent shower and a big walk-in closet. Very quiet at night. We enjoyed our stay very much."

2614387,32988360,2015-05-24,25561095,Kara,"When first arriving, I was met at the door by Sandy herself ! She was very welcoming and kind. She gave me a tour of her home and plenty of suggestions for adventures around Fremont . Her home is blocks away from the Fremont troll and bus stop 16 which will take you to downtown Seattle . I enjoyed my stay very much and was very pleased with Sandy as my host . Would recommend this home to anyone and would love to come back for a visit ^.^"

Her doggie, Jax is so sweet!

2614387,34268518,2015-06-07,23781923,Carol,"We really enjoyed our stay with Sandy. The room was lovely and perfect. The dogs we're fine and sweet. She was helpful but not at all intrusive. The neighborhood is outside of Seattle but very close and an interesting one. The room is on the second floor, a slight drawback for some. Sandy was accommodating. Her check in time was early and she let us leave thins there when we left for a few days."
2614387,34640260,2015-06-10,32178206,Norah,"Sandy is really nice, friendly and helpful. I love her, and her dog Jax. She response quickly whenever I have questions. I feel welcomed at her house. The location is perfect for me to drive around Seattle. Places I visited like Pike market, UW, etc. are all very close (usually it just takes me 5 mins to drive there, sometimes 10 mins).The room is quite, and clean. I'll definitely go back if I visit Seattle again."
2614387,34689926,2015-06-11,23781923,Carol,"Sandy was very welcoming. She was interested in what we were doing and helpful with suggestions, but also left us alone mostly to do what we wanted. Her house was available to us in many ways, the kitchen and living room. The room had its own bath so we did not need to encounter anyone else if we did not wish to. She allowed us to leave things when we left for a few days and came back. We had a lovely time in Seattle."

Routinierte Gastgeberin. Eine sehr gute Alternative zu einer Unterkunft downtown Seattle, das man in 15 Busminuten (Gehweg 4 Min. zur Bushalte) perfekt erreicht."
2614387,35910608,2015-06-23,1971733,Caroline,"Sandy is a very fine host.  We are hosts ourselves and it turned out Sandy and I have a lot in common!  She was there at her home to welcome us the days we arrived and departed.  She was also great to talk to during our stay, especially over coffee and tea in the morning! Our room was clean, airy, nicely furnished, quiet, with a nice private shower, and with a partial view of a slice of Fremont.  Her location is really ideal: almost equidistant between Fremont and Wallingford with lots within walking distance, no parking issues, and bus lines close by. We cooked at the house one night and ate out another.  Sandy knows the area well and could answer any question we had.  :)  Thanks Sandy!  "

2614387,36327463,2015-06-27,35475161,Sawita,"This is the first time I book a place via airbnb and I really love it. I found the place in only a week before my travel. Sandy helps a lot in many things rather than her comfy and very clean room.  Her promptly reply and suggestions via message box made my early days in Seattle not so difficult as I was afraid. I arrived at her home later than I told her but I met her with a warmly greetings and small talk.. This was impressive after the long difficult day finding an apartments. I already told my cousin to stay with Sandy when she comes to visit :) 
ps1 it's very easy to get to the house from (website hidden)2 Jax is a super cute friendly dog. But I don't know the name of the other smaller one ^^ "
2614387,36510905,2015-06-29,29063822,Jared,"Great property.  Hostess was very informed on the local area, plus downtown Seattle.  Detailed list of ""to do"" sites was provided, which we found beneficial!  Would stay again."
2614387,36708488,2015-06-30,36671907,Jervis,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2614387,36811216,2015-07-01,15505676,Nigel,Great location near Fremont and loads of luscious eateries. The description didn't do the area justice. It's a really special leafy part of Seattle with beautiful architecture. Our welcome was great thanks.

We love the Fremont neighborhood in Seattle and had lots of fun walking to and from her home to different places to eat. There are so many places to eat less than a mile from her home. My boyfriend and I had a great stay with Sandy and she was very accommodating since it took us longer than we expected to drive to Seattle from Portland due to traffic on the I-5. She also has two cute dogs that we really enjoyed.

Sandy is also very knowledgable about the surrounding areas and had many great suggestions. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!"

The room and house are very tidy and clean and the dogs are educated very well. The room is as described. Furthermore sands gave us written instructions and tips where to go and what to see. We really appreciated this. When we had questions before she answered them quite fast. It was a lovely time and we would love to come back. "

When we met trouble with a big nail in my tyre, Sandy spent much more time communicating with rental car Corp, help us solving the problem with the fast speed and lowest cost. Really thank you sandy for great assistant , but it will be pity that we could not re check in your house Oct 3-6 after we back from LAX, it seems be someone reserved room already, we still set your house be 1st choice when we back Seattle again, hope see you soon.

2614387,48408088,2015-09-26,41625008,Wenyi,She is very kindly and helped us to find my car which towed. The room is very comfortable. I like it. And it is very good that there is hot water.
2614387,48979996,2015-09-30,19444087,Donna,"Sandy's place is close to everything! We love the area, the room is clean and we love that it has its own washroom and shower. Sandy is a very warm host, we enjoyed our conversations with her along with the great restaurant suggestions!:-) Will definitely stay here again the next time we go back!:-) "

Sandy was a great host and told us about many places we ended up visiting during our stay. Taking the bus to downtown is easy - the bus station is only 2 minutes from the apartment and the bus takes less than 20 minutes to downtown.. We can recommend this room to everyone who wants to visit Seattle and we would definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle..
2614387,49634624,2015-10-05,5315280,Liz Buffy,My interactions with Sandy were brief but delightful. The room was perfect and the bed was super comfy ! Would definitely stay again if I return to Seattle!

The maple trees on the avenue are very beautiful which we have never seen. Thanks Sandy!"
2614387,50898843,2015-10-15,13157365,Gabriel,"We spent a great stay in Seattle, through the great location of Sandy's house. Ten minutes to downtown with a car.

2614387,51331103,2015-10-19,23158191,Caitlin,"Sandy was very welcoming and super sweet. We arrived right at check-in time and she showed us right up to our room so we could get situated. Room was very clean, comfortable and spacious. We only crossed paths when we checked-in and as we were leaving the next morning, but conversation was pleasant. I recommend Sandy's place to anyone looking for a comfortable, clean place near many great places in Seattle. "

2614387,52607962,2015-10-31,2900379,Nick,"Sandy was very accommodating and I was able to check in late, around 9pm. Convenient coded lock to the house so no keys required. 

Great neighborhood, very close to the Fremont Troll/Bridge. Room as described. Bonus, separate temperature control for the room and bathroom which was really nice.

Two cute, very friendly dogs so be aware if you have allergies, though they weren't allowed in the rental room so maybe a non-issue. 

Would highly recommend."
2614387,53062646,2015-11-04,13870288,Andy,"Sandy's location in Fremont was ideal for our stay in Seattle. The bus, only a block away from the house, to downtown was only several minutes away. Everything was just as described! Sandy and Jax, the austrailian shepherd, gave us such a warm welcome and made us feel right at home. Sandy never hesitated to provide us helpful information of everything I asked. We really enjoyed Fremont and Seattle thanks to Sandy! "
2614387,53334137,2015-11-08,18849897,Lisa,"I couldn't have asked for a better host and place to stay in Seattle! Seattle was very welcoming and friendly, and offered many fantastic recommendations for food and things to do. Her home is located in an attractive neighborhood with a short 20-minute bus ride to downtown. I stayed in a private room + bath that were cozy and comfortable, and just as described in the listing. Thank you, Sandy, for such a pleasant visit! "
2614387,53865751,2015-11-13,6159697,Amy,"Sandy (and her two pups) was so kind and welcoming!

The room was 5 star. Bed was a very nice mattress that we slept comfortably on. Down pillows. Down comforter. Personal bathroom was very clean and nice. 

10/10, would definitely stay again. "
2614387,55372566,2015-12-01,27223557,Ziqing,"Very nice experience in Sandy's house! I like everything in her house, especially her lovely dog Jax! He is really quite and gentle, and he loves people! I also had a very great time with Sandy to decorate her house for Christmas together, it was my first time to enjoy it. The house locates in the north part in Seattle, but it is quite near Downtown area, just 15min with bus. The green lake and zoo and university are just in walk distance. And the room is on the second floor with your private bathroom and cloakroom. The bed is very comfortable and the heating system also works very well. Thank you Sandy, I really get a perfect time!"
2614387,55533683,2015-12-01,42600517,Tyler,"Sandy was by far one of the most welcoming and wonderful hosts I've stayed with since I started using Airbnb. Her place is as advertised - it's a great room in a fantastic location. The apartment was clean, neat, and comfortable. I stayed there the night before an interview, and she was very accommodating and helpful. I will definitely stay there again when back in Seattle. Thank you so much, Sandy! "

Sandy has curated a guide to Fremont with good eat and drink places, and all were hits!  Definitely recommend."
2614387,57068896,2015-12-21,44540585,Rob,"Great host. Nice, clean place!"
2614387,57439676,2015-12-26,47860740,Bing,"Sandy's place is tidy, clean, warm house and beautifully decorated. Location wise, it is a few minutes drive from Pike Place Market and China town. Roadside parking is also available. 
Sandy also made a handy list about all the shopping and dinning places and bars in the neighborhood. 
Jax, the shepherd is a lovely dog, who is mostly quite and laying near the fireplace. However, be prepared during diner time, he will come to you and beg for food with his innocent eyes.  "
2614387,57823596,2015-12-29,31083307,Brian,Sandy's place was great. She was a great host and was very helpful. My flight delayed and I didn't get in until nearly midnight but she still greeted me when I got in. The room was clean and very comfortable. I would absolutely stay at here again.

8105221,46103927,2015-09-07,2330949,Carolina,"We were SO happy to have stayed at this place! 
The apartment is situated in a very nice, lively and safe area in Seattle. Public transport to downtown and other nice neighbourhoods, nice coffee bars and restaurants, good supermarkets and parks are all within a short distance. 
Most of all, the place is modern, light and clean, but has a warm and cosy feel. Shiri and her boyfriend made us feel very welcome and gave us super useful information to let us explore the city ourselves. We felt really sorry to leave and will undoubtedly book again. 
Plus: the views from the living room and bathroom are great! "
8105221,46819622,2015-09-13,7264490,Thomas And Anna,"Don't let the lack of reviews fool you, Shiri is a new host but still handled everything like a pro! The place itself is sublime. Great space, great view, great bedroom and bathroom. Shiri and Jules are relaxed and very warm and welcoming hosts. As we arrived the kitchen smelled like Shiri's freshly baked breakfast granola, delicious! She also gave us a lot of good tips for eateries. We'd love to come back anytime!"
8105221,48343879,2015-09-25,43866999,Dominik,"Shiri and Jules are really great guys and wonderful hosts.

8105221,49144664,2015-10-01,27240603,Mary,"Shiri and Jules were very welcoming.  We really enjoyed our stay in their home. Queen Anne was a perfect location for us: it was close to Seattle Center where we had theater tickets, and it was a great starting point for our bike rides downtown, to Bainbridge island, and north to Discovery Park and the ship canal trail, etc. Parking on the street behind their house was always readily available, and, as an added bonus, our car was visible from the house. Being able to do a load of laundry was also a nice bene."
8105221,50518745,2015-10-12,8039642,Zoe,"Such a nice house in a great location! Public transportation was easily accessible. They had notes about Seattle and food recommendations written before we even arrived. This was our first air bnb experience and it was better then staying in a hotel. Had an awesome time, thanks guys! "
8105221,51466209,2015-10-20,669979,Stormie,"Shiri made us feel welcome by accommodating our schedule change, and by having breakfast for us every morning - so appreciated! The neighborhood is great, central, and not far from downtown. We split most of our time between downtown and Queen Anne and had no trouble at all. Shiri also had good recommendations for where we should go when we told her what our goals were in terms of sight seeing / exploring. We would definitely stay there again! Haivng your own bathroom is a huge plus as well."
8105221,52338871,2015-10-28,18824773,Pamela,"Shiri and Jules were VERY welcoming, accommodating, helpful and kind during my stay.  The condo was as pictured and described.  The location was good for visiting my daughter at SPU.  The view of Puget Sound was awesome!  So grateful for parking close by."
8105221,53183019,2015-11-06,21770766,Nikolaj,"Shiri is an outstanding host. We felt like at home during our 3-night stay. 
Location is perfect, easy to find, close to public transportation and fast to get to downtown Seattle/Airport.
We found that flat was very clean, room was comfortable and great view was there too! It was very quiet in the room and around the house. It felt very private and secure.
Shiri and Jules are welcoming hosts, it was very interesting to talk to them and they were willing to help with any questions.
There is really nothing bad to say about Shiri and place - highly recommended!


"
8105221,54639602,2015-11-22,16325453,Andrea,"Shiri and Jules were great hosts, very helpful. They gave us information about places to go and tips to get around the city, including transportation tips. Their place was clean and in a very nice neighborhood with a beautiful view. It was easy to get to downtown from there by bus and uber was also cheap (8-10$). Shiri was always available by text or phone and replying fast to our questions. If we go back to Seattle we'll definitely stay with them again!"
8105221,55319404,2015-11-29,49882681,Dan,Awesome hosts in an awesome place! Exceeded expectations and would recommend to a friend.

1806899,12264255,2014-04-27,1746717,Gregory,"Bri has a great place and is a very accommodating host. She lives in a newer home on Beacon Hill, one of Seattle's nicest historic neighborhoods. It is very clean, comfortable and quiet. I slept great. Her place is about two blocks from the train, which is a huge convenience. I was in town to see a Mariners game, and getting to Safeco Field and back was fast, easy and cheap. She is absolutely right when she says you don't need a car if you stay there. The neighborhood itself is very walkable, which is something I really like when I travel. A grocery store, coffee shops, and a few restaurants are nearby. She is near the top of the hill, so the views from everywhere are fantastic. Given our schedules and my brief stay I did not get to see Bri much, but she is very nice and made me feel right at home. She responded quickly to my request to stay and kept if close touch. The dog is great - very well-behaved. I will definitely try to stay with Bri again when I'm in Seattle. I highly recommend her and her home."
1806899,12909766,2014-05-13,15174961,Yuan,"Bri is a wonderful host. I have been greatly enjoying staying in her place. It's quiet and cozy and the bed is super comfortable. The location is very convenient too, just a few minutes drive to downtown and not far from the airport. I totally recommend her place! At last I would like to personally thank Bri for helping out park my car. I literally can't do parallel parking and I hit the car on the wood fans one night. Bri was such a life saver by helping me pull the car out. I might have called 911 if she was not there. Thanks! ;)"
1806899,13164493,2014-05-20,1094688,SheAh Prince,"I enjoyed  my stay at  the ""the adorable convenient room.The host  ""Bri""  was very accommodating.  She has a friendly personality and helpful suggestions.  Her place is clean, cute, and comfortable. I slept very well. Her dog, Jax, is very friendly,polite,and adorable.  The neighborhood is quiet. The market is right up the street.  I give a total thumbs up and highly recommend staying at this wonderful place."
1806899,13256666,2014-05-23,15449983,Leigh,"Bri was a very generous and friendly host. I wasn't really sure what to expect, but what I enjoyed the most was how clean her place. It was very tidy, and she had notes in the bedroom and in the kitchen explaining how to get downtown, where the local stores are, how to contact her, and more. I would highly recommend staying with her. Also, her house is located just a few miles from downtown which is convenient. "
1806899,13446028,2014-05-27,9909408,Mark,"Wonderful stay! We stayed three nights with Bri and although she had to leave for the weekend, everything was well organized and prepared. Her house is very warm and welcoming and the room was perfect for us. Location is very nice and quiet although you sometimes here planes flying in. Public transport is three minutes by foot, perfect to go downtown or to the airport. We would recommend to stay woth Bri."
1806899,13581583,2014-05-31,15444973,Beth,"Bri was a fantastic hostess and Jax was a very sweet, quiet dog.  Bri is welcoming and quiet.  Her home is comfortable and it's nice to have a closet to use in your bedroom.  It's also very convenient to take the light rail to both downtown and to the airport.  I would stay there again!    "
1806899,13799481,2014-06-04,5944078,Jaysie,"Bri is a great host! The location is very nice, you can walk to restaurants and bars, and you still have free street parking! Her dog is absolute adorable! I had a great stay here! I would definitely recommend others to stay here when they visit Seattle!"
1806899,13837012,2014-06-05,16157269,Liz,"Bri was a great host! Her apartment was very cute, close to public transportation, and in a nice area. I only stayed for a night, but felt very welcome in Bri's apartment. "

1806899,14200834,2014-06-14,15783220,Simon,"I had a really great stay with Bri, her place is clean, quiet with a very well trained 4 legged buddy. For those with a non-Starbucks coffee addiction, there is two great coffee shops within a short walk. Check in was a breeze and Bri answered any questions I had almost immediately.

Bri's place is very close to Safeco so its perfect for baseball/football. It's also really easy to get around Seattle as the light rail is so close to her house and runs frequently, so arriving at the airport is a breeze.

With the seemingly high cost of hotel's in Seattle, Bri's place is a really great alternative. I highly recommend Bri's airbnb hospitality and was made to feel very welcome, it didn't feel like I rented a room, more just stayed with a friend.

"
1806899,16063249,2014-07-21,14290901,Näomi,"I loved Bri! She was just the perfect amount of everything for my stay. She didn't overcrowd me but I did feel looked after and she even introduced me to some real mint Seattle people! The house and everything was exactly how it was listed in the ad and the neighborhood was quiet enough but close to the train and downtown, with a mint view hidden down the end of her street. All in all it was a 10/10 x"
1806899,16115644,2014-07-22,17047552,Regy,"Everything worked wonderfully! Upon my arrival Bri was not at home, but thanks to the great communication I felt very comfortable when getting there. Her home is very nice and located in a pleasant area. Important to me was the very comfy bed! We met the next morning for a short chat, before I left Seattle."
1806899,16474688,2014-07-28,16720835,Andee & Chris,"My husband and I stayed with Bri for 3 nights. Her communication was top notch. We felt very welcomed and free to move about as if we were staying with an old friend.
The neighborhood was safe, with ample street parking. A little grocery store, buses and the light rail are just 2 blocks away. Easy vehicle access to the interstate, West Seattle and Downtown too. 
The room was good size, the bed had a feather down mattress pad (bonus!!!) with a large window that looked out to a nice view of the neighborhood. 
Staying at Bri's beats staying in a hotel anyday. We'll make sure to try and stay with her again on our next trip.

Although I have not seen her in person frequently but she makes me feel being close while I stay. And the neighbor is quiet and safe, the location is good. It's convenient to move by public transition, furthermore the transition card(named ocar) is prepaired in the room! I hilghly recommend to stay at Bri's house."

1806899,17163531,2014-08-08,17788620,Sandra,"This was our first experience with Airbnb, and we will definitely do it again. Bri was a great hostess, and her house is lovely. She is laid back and fun to talk to. Her house is very close to public transportation, so we could park our rental car for free on her street, and travel stress-free in Seattle. The room has a comfortable queen bed and private bathroom. Very nice accommodations."
1806899,17360322,2014-08-11,13701597,Caroline,"We were 3 nights at Bri’s home, we are very happy for our stay. Bri is a great host, she is polite, quiet, helpful and very nice. We liked talking with her during the last evening ! The house is big, clean (it’s very important for us) and we appreciated our bedroom and our private bathroom. And we loved her lovely dog Jacks !

So we recommend Bri and her house for a stay in the beautiful city of Seattle !

1806899,17589510,2014-08-14,19241388,Tonya,Everything is as listed and quite convenient to get around. The home is warm and welcoming as was Bri and her doggie - I only met her for a brief chat. This is a great booking for single travellers on a budget who don't want to do the hostels. 
1806899,17752446,2014-08-17,4864549,Jaki And Rob,"It was such fun staying at Bri's home.  It is clean, neat and well stocked with everything a person would need.  She's an artist and her home is decorated with her happy, colorful, creative work.  Bri is down-to-earth, flexible, kind and extremely considerate.  Location is perfect - just a couple of short blocks to Link light rail which connects to the airport and downtown.  Great place to stay and her cute dog Jax is an added bonus!  Would stay here again and recommend it to others."
1806899,17976387,2014-08-19,12588691,Niya,"Bri was a wonderful host! Everything was so easy: quick walk to the train station into downtown or airport, great comfy bed, very nice and clean sunny room and bathroom, all one could have asked for. We would love to stay back on return trips to Seattle!"
1806899,18564617,2014-08-28,910617,Alexsandra,Our stay at Bri's place was perfect for our short trip to Seattle. It was a clean room with a comfy bed and super close to transit to get us to and from downtown everyday! While we never actually met Bri she was a great host and gave us great directions in getting to and from her place. She was also quick to respond to any questions we had throughout our trip and we loved being welcomed by her puppy Jax when we arrived. We would definitely stay at Bri's place again! 
1806899,18878517,2014-09-02,16707544,Alex,Staying here was wonderful. Extremely clean and just all around nice. Would definitely stay there again. 
1806899,18946177,2014-09-03,5612706,Mark,"Bri and I had great, if not ecstatic communication, prior to the trip. Her place reflects her style and is indeed full of life and happiness. There is much artwork everywhere - it almost feels like you're in a gallery or studio. Comfortable bed and adjacent bathroom. Very clean, convenient location near the light rail, quiet (except for occasional train honks and planes), high hill-top location."
1806899,19203975,2014-09-08,18769021,Jill,"Nice neighborhood, located next to market and light rail. "
1806899,19343520,2014-09-10,19650916,Juliane,"Bri is a friendly host; we were lucky to visit with her one evening and enjoyed hearing some parts of her life. She openly shares her home and is eager to help you to enjoy your stay. As others mention the house is close to the light rail and busses so getting around is easy.
The room is on the smaller side for 2 people and you may want to bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper; Amtrak trains honk quite frequently throughout the night and planes are flying over.
Overall a good place to stay."

1806899,21010650,2014-10-09,13156717,Roman,"Everything about this listing is spot on! It is an adorable convenient room! The neighborhood is very quiet, not too much hustle and bustle. I rented a car, but the public transportation is only a hop and a skip away. I did have the pleasure of meeting both Bri and her puppy Jax! Bri is an outgoing, confident, go-getter with plenty of insight regarding the city and the surrounding areas. This was my first airbnb experience and I couldn't of asked for anything better!! When I find myself back in Seattle, I would love the opportunity to stay here again!!"
1806899,21308725,2014-10-14,21253246,Anthony,"Bri was very accommodating and flexible with dropping my bags off prior to check in.  The directions she gave were spot on and made it very easy to find.  The room was great and the bed was very comfortable.  The private bathroom was great and it had any extra necessities in case you forgot anything. Bri was really helpful with all the great places we should try or what to see.  I would definitely stay again she was an amazing host!  Her home was two blocks from food, drinks a late night grocery store and a quick walk to the link light rail.  The view is amazing from the room just be aware if you are a light sleeper the train horns start very early in the morning."
1806899,21525241,2014-10-19,13682822,Kate,"Had a great stay at Bri's place. Loved the quiet neighborhood and easy access to the light rail
The room was very welcoming, clean and organized so that everything was easy to find.  Great midway location between SEA-TAC and downtown for folks wanting a quiet place to hang their hats after enjoying the bustle of downtown."
1806899,22001736,2014-10-27,6484454,Nelia,"Everything about this place was perfect. Bri's location is between the airport and downtown so it worked out perfectly for my bf and I as we did not get a car rental. I think I may have suprised her when I arrived a bit earlier than check in but she was nice about it. Jax, her puppy was a great host-he welcomed me and showed me where our room was-what service! You get your own bathroom equipped with clean towels and soap (if you forgot yours). I appreciate the set up with getting the keys. Clean, friendly, great location-would go with her again. Thanks Bri!"
1806899,22093677,2014-10-29,23028274,Christopher,"Neighborhood was great! Close to downtown (especially with a car). The house itself was very nice and clean, my wife and I were happy to stay there! We would definitely consider staying here again during our next visit to Seattle!!"
1806899,22625501,2014-11-10,953768,Edward,"A total pro. Bri is super friendly, helpful, and just great. We were flying cross country, landing late. Bri ensured a smooth check in. Her place is comfortable and perfectly located for airport travelers and city explorers. Bri provided some excellent suggestions. Her dog is the best, mellow and friendly. We had an awesome trip. Thank you Bri!"
1806899,23193614,2014-11-24,9301844,Dan & Beth,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle and at Bris place. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet her because she was away with work, but that did mean we had the entire place to ourselves, which was amazing! The house itself is lovely, very clean and comfortable. We had some great nights in making the most of her kitchen and netflix account, plus some great nights out in the city. The location is great, a few blocks to the train, which will get you downtown in only about 15 minutes. Supermarket by the station and parking outside. Would highly recommend!"
1806899,23414625,2014-11-30,2413477,Amanda,"A lovely home with a sweet furry friend to keep you company! Bri was very friendly, gave us some advice on getting around (it was Black Friday and snowing!) and made us feel very welcome in her home. Jax, the cutest pup on Beacon Hill, was a doll and we loved spending time with him. Lots of parking, the bed was a dream, and the private bathroom beautiful! "
1806899,23851230,2014-12-12,23471596,Paul,The place was ideal for what we need. Perfectly located just outside of the city but a short and cheap train ride to the city or equally to Seatac airport from the station only a couple of streets away. Bri was cool and made us feel totally welcome and was nice to get to know her and Jax who is so cute and placid and clearly loves the attention from new guests :) Would recommend it to anyone in Seattle for a short space of time looking for a bed in a friendly home.
1806899,25480308,2015-01-17,11726815,Molly,I loved everything about this place. In a very quiet neighborhood with easy free parking. Great bed. I loved how clean everything was. I plan on coming back!
1806899,25528136,2015-01-18,11726815,Molly,Very easy process all together. Very clean and bright. Good Bed. Good amenities. Easy location to get around. I enjoyed having my own thermostat for my room. 
1806899,26440516,2015-02-12,23126306,Marko,"Everything was perfect. I was on right place, really good neighborhood, nice host and her little fellow Jax :)
Thank you!"
1806899,26637974,2015-02-16,27172599,Joshua,"Bri's home was in a convenient location. It had easy free parking one street over and was steps away from transit that goes straight downtown. The bedroom and bathroom were both clean and comfortable. However, Bri charges more on weekends and during our stay on a Saturday night she brought a male friend home and they woke us up with their talking at midnight and kept us up for an hour. They then proceeded to wake us up at 7 in the morning with more loud talking and laughing. As a hostess she seemed very nice but I'm not sure she knows how thin her walls are. "
1806899,27654927,2015-03-09,7678532,Jim,"Another excellent airbnb experience.  The rooms was as advertised and commented on by others.  The neighborhood was great with coffee, groceries, and public transport all extremely close.  The home was extremely comfortable, clean, and the bed gave us a great sleep.  The bathroom across the hall was for our exclusive use and an initial problem with the drain was fixed the first day before we returned to go to sleep at night.  So Bri is most responsive to any problems/requests you have.  The trains are close by so if you are a light sleeper you may want earplugs although my wife and I both slept great every night and we were there for ten nights.

We were in Seattle to take care of our son after surgery so it was a bit of a difficult time for us and Bri was gracious in every way.  She is a very nice person and was friendly and an excellent host.  She also was very respectful of our situation.  We came and went as we pleased and were always comfortable in her house.  Last, but not least, her dog is one of the sweetest dogs we've ever met.  I'm not sure if he's more friendly than Bri but he is at least as friendly.

All in all a great place to stay.  Thanks, Bri."
1806899,27927570,2015-03-15,26688780,Sohee,"The house was awesome! Great interior and posters. Everything what we needed was all set. Nice neighborhood, easy access to downtown and airport. We could enjoy our travel more! Thanks! :) "
1806899,29330591,2015-04-06,29073438,Sarah,"Bri's place was a great spot to stay in Seattle! The room was small, but clean and inviting. We had a private bathroom that was stocked with the basics in case you forget some toiletries. Bri was a very friendly hostess and checked in with us multiple times to ensure that we had everything that we needed. At one point I realized I forgot my hairdryer and Bri let me borrow hers. We had a great experience, the room is only two blocks away from the Link to downtown Seattle. Super convenient and easy to ride. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks for a great stay Bri!"
1806899,29646194,2015-04-10,1433563,Jamie,"Bri's place is a really great value. She doesn't even mention how great of a view the room has in the morning! There's also a park down the street that has one of the best views of the Seattle skyline to be had in the city. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom is stocked, it's everything you could need. 

Most importantly Bri herself is extremely friendly and accommodating and we had some great conversations. You can tell she genuinely cares about what she's doing. Throw the ball once for Jax and you have a friend for life.

As others have said, the convenience of being so close to the light rail does come with horns in the morning- if you're a light sleeper. And if I were to be nitpicky the internet here was almost dial-up levels of slow. But from what I've read it's common for the neighborhood. So if you're staying here to see the city (As you should!) it works out perfectly. But if you need to get some work done or unwind with Netflix, be prepared to buffer a bit.

I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again."
1806899,29854396,2015-04-13,20710356,Kitty,"We didn't get to chat with Bri too much since she was away for the most part(and we had the place to ourselves!), but she was super responsive for all the questions we had! And her puppy is so sweet and friendly!

The location is super convenient because we mainly went to downtown. The room is small but adequate, and we had the whole place to ourselves! The view from the room is so nice! We heard trains but that didn't bother our sleep at all. The bathroom was spotless and was private for our use.

The value is awesome! Very affordable for a surprisingly pleasant airbnb experience!"
1806899,30176294,2015-04-18,28366776,Lewis,"Bri was a great host she is very friendly and gave us some great ideas for things to do. The house is in a great location 2 minute walk to the station and 15 mins to downtown Seattle.

The room was spotless and a really good size. 

When we come back to Seattle we will defiantly stay with Bri again!"
1806899,30334026,2015-04-20,29172071,Lisa,"We had a brilliant stay with Bri and Jax, she was there to greet us when we arrived (but had things in place in case she couldn't be there). The room and bathroom were just as described. The place is very close to a grocery store and a light rail station in what felt like a really safe neighbourhood! We would definitely stay here again:)"
1806899,30569925,2015-04-24,25442644,Nancy,"Bri's place was our first experience with airbnb and it was great.  The location was in a beautiful area, close to downtown and there was ample parking nearby as well.  The place was very cute and comfortable and we had a really good sleep during our stay.  I found Bri helpful and friendly and I fell in love with her little dog Jax too.  I wouldn't hesitate giving a recommendation!"
1806899,30948291,2015-04-29,29542030,Alex,"Bri was extremely fast at responding to my e-mails. Her place is very cool, tidy, and clean. Extremely close to the LINK light rail which makes it SUPER convenient to go downtown. Grocery store also super close and good for buying late night/early morning snacks. Bed is very comfortable.

Excellent place to stay! I was worried it would be too far away from DT but the light rail was an excellent and fast way to get there."
1806899,31595536,2015-05-07,31244485,Yi,Bri was a very nice and helpful girl. we love her!
1806899,31722428,2015-05-09,31181143,Marc,Being new to airbnb I wasn't sure what to expect but knew much depended on the host. The room was as described and Bri was most welcoming. We would recommend this location to anyone. We had a great time in Seattle and both Bri and Jax had a lot to do with it. Thank you for welcoming us into you very nice home.
1806899,31998426,2015-05-12,10608177,Anthony,Bri is a warm welcoming host and went out of her way to let my stay be relaxed and enjoyable.
1806899,32211285,2015-05-15,32184295,Sam,"Bri was very welcoming and even gave us some suggestions for what we could do during our stay in Seattle, and the apartment was comfortable, clean, and very convenient to the light rail. Unfortunately we couldn't stay very long, but we would have loved to. Also, Jax is the sweetest dog on the planet. "
1806899,32559484,2015-05-19,28995272,Lo Yi,"Thanks Bri for providing such a nice place for us! The room and bathroom is clean. The dog is really lovely and cute :) The 3 nights I stay here are really enjoyable :) thanks, Bri! "
1806899,46134675,2015-09-08,34276951,Rob,Bri's house is beautiful and the guest room is very comfortable. Very easy to get to the city centre and airport either by car or public transport. We were made to feel very welcome. Highly recommended. 
1806899,46701238,2015-09-13,10848747,Jordan,Bri's place was a welcome sight after we finally arrived. Flight trouble made us miss our first night but the nicely decorated room put us into a better mood.  The room is small but just the right size. The large window in the room allows for seeing a beautiful sunrise in the morning.  I didn't get to chance to meet Bri during the stay but had a fantastic stay.  It is close to the light rail which takes you into the city.
1806899,47246598,2015-09-17,33144040,Mads,"My son and I had 2 wonderful days in Bri's place.

No problems getting in via a key in a safebox.

It's easy to go to and from Downtown and airport via the rail and the station is just 5 min. walk from Bri's place.

We met Bri on the last day and she was very nice.

Thanks Bri"
1806899,54848700,2015-11-25,29707153,Lisa,"Our room was perfectly cozy and a great location to hop around Seattle and to/from the airport. Loved how close it was to the light rail station. Excellent location- convenient and middle ground for most places you'd like to travel to in the city. The town home was very easy to find from the directions Bri provided. 

The space was very clean. Bri's directions and info of the area was spot on and very helpful. She's friendly and very easy to talk to. I was feeling a bit ill during part of our trip so sweet Bri prepared a cup of tea for me and shared a chocolate truffle with me. Bri was also flexible with our stay, working to accommodate us as we traveled in between Seattle and Vancouver BC over a couple of nights. 

Jax the dog is adorable, calm, and friendly.  We played fetch with him and pet him when he came to say 'hi' to us now and again. "
1806899,55565334,2015-12-02,39557339,Camille,"This was a great place to  stay in Seattle . Very comfortable  and clean room , and private bath right across the hall .  When I was there is got pretty cold at night ( 30's) and it was so nice to be able to control the heat in my room . Great neighborhood , restricted parking but free parking in the next block .  Every else I've stayed in Seattle , parking was a problem . Not here !    I  Wasn't there a lot but saw Bri  a few times and she was very nice and friendly . And her little  dog Jax was so adorable !! He would come visit me in my room every now and then .   I would highly recommend staying here if you are going to Seattle . ( and a nice residential neighborhood with a nice grocery just a couple of blocks away. ). Thanks Bri. !!"
1806899,55653359,2015-12-04,27177218,Aly,"Bri was a wonderful host, very welcoming and friendly. The room was comfortable and offered a wonderful view. Everything was very clean in her home and the bed was comfortable. And Jax was a sweetheart - just be prepared to throw the ball a few hundred times!"
1806899,56634772,2015-12-15,41760959,Harry,It was very comfortable staying in Bri's apartment. The house was cozy and made we felt like staying at home.
1806899,56762762,2015-12-17,38569625,Stevie,"This has been by far my best AirBnB experience! I have spent the last 3 months travelling around the US and staying at Bri and Wim's was a great way to finish of my trip. Everything was perfect. I booked at short notice and Bri was very accommodating with check in times and gave clear instruction how to gain access to the property. The room is fantastic. Very clean and with everything that I needed. As it was very cold outside having my own thermostat in the room made my stay very comfortable. Having my own private bathroom was also amazing. It was mega clean and had shower gel, shampoo and conditioner for me to use. It was a bonus not having to share with anyone as I didn't like this very much at previous homes. The property is 2 minutes walk to Beacon Hill train station which gives easy access to everything. It was so easy to get around and I managed to fit in loads of sightseeing in a short time period. I can't recommend staying here highly enough. Perfect!"
1806899,57186614,2015-12-22,48895136,Heather,Bri was great and a very accommodating host!

Easy street parking! "
7771531,47117679,2015-09-15,2117910,Andrea,"When we arrived at Theresa's and CB's house, we met Theresa in the frontyard and she showed us the entrance to our appartement. She took good care of us and made sure we have everything. The appartement was comfy and clean and the bus information on the fridge have been very helpful for the first day. "
7771531,47549688,2015-09-20,29298264,Michael,"Theresa & CB were terrific hosts!
•And I came in and found a red velvet cupcake waiting for me.
•As a  basement apartment, it's basically the same footprint of the house, so pretty spacious.
•There was a little bump, which I reported.  They came down IN MINUTES and quickly remedied.
•Private enclosed backyard -- with grill – great place to sit & read.
•Clear house information was ready & waiting, including for bus --schedules also provided.

Highly recommended.
"
7771531,49404245,2015-10-03,11344605,Nefer,"CB and Theresa made us feel welcome and were terrific hosts during our stay. The basement unit had everything we needed to enjoy ourselves. Lots of bars, restaurants, and coffee shops nearby and also just far enough to enjoy some peace and quite. "
7771531,49810948,2015-10-06,6574620,Rusty,"We enjoyed our stay here.  The place was clean, comfortable, and located in an awesome neighborhood.  The location is great - right in the heart of Ballard with plenty to see and do and all within walking distance.  Theresa and CB were great hosts - attentive and responsive throughout our stay.  I would definitely stay again."
7771531,50327225,2015-10-11,26086034,Ephraim,"Theresa and CB did everything to make our stay stress free and comfortable.  The space was clean and welcoming.  Wish we could have stayed more than one night.  The only hiccup was having to duck under an unavoidable air duct (I'm 6'), which became second nature after doing it a few times.  All in all we had a very nice stay and would totally return."
7771531,50785168,2015-10-14,14863979,Georgia,"This was a very roomy clean 1 BR apartment. Previous comments with the shallow ceiling  pass through between LR and bed bathroom areas have been addressed.  The apartment was basement but on grade  level.  Very clean. And great 
convenience of laundry facilities  and a cute little private yard.      Although we did not get to enjoy it  . Bathroom nice size although a smaller stand up shower then we have had before. We didn't get to meet the owners. But they responded right away via text or phone.   Very recommended for an extended stay in  Ballard . "
7771531,51554196,2015-10-21,44888424,Cara,Cute little house! I loved the advise for local restaurants and coffee shops. We would definitely stay here again. 
7771531,52360193,2015-10-28,46628214,Barbara,"This was my first experience using AirB&B but it was an easy and pleasant experience, both online and in person.  Everything went
perfectly, the key was easy to access, and the apartment was large
and perfect for my stay.   It was warm and clean and quiet and they
even provided coffee and tea and everything I needed to have
a wonderful stay.   
Thank you Theresa and CB, I would certainly stay again."
7771531,53650916,2015-11-10,21732634,John,"I loved my stay here! Cold and rainy day, nice warm little spot to call home for the weekend. The place has a 1970s, grandma's basement kinda feel, in terms of the basic structure and age of the kitchen, but perfectly maintained, clean, with some modern updates to the furniture, flat screen and internet, of course. I walked in and a carrot muffin greeted me on the counter, welcoming me to the space. There was also coffee and a coffee maker, so I was set for breakfast the next day. "
7771531,53859519,2015-11-13,31666141,Karen,Spacious apartment. Hosts are attentive and provided coffee and cream. Could use some cosmetic work on the interior but it is neat and clean. 
7771531,54061068,2015-11-15,33076759,Vanessa,"Great spacious space! Way bigger than photos show & a full kitchen. It was warm for a basement unit, didn't even use the space heater although it was provided. The bed was crazy comfortable. Walking distance to grocery stores, bars, restaurants, and bus lines. Check in/out was simple. Would definitely stay again!"
7771531,57778408,2015-12-29,47937823,Pamela,We were very pleased with the apartment.  My daughter flew in from Raleigh to visit us and she said the bed was very comfortable and bragged to her brother that she had the better deal than he had when he visited here. It was rainy during her visit and she mentioned how thoughtful her hosts were to have left her a full size umbrella by the front door for her to use.  An excellent location and hosts who were easy to contact and respond to our questions. Thanks Theresa and CB.  You helped make our holiday visit with our family stress free!! 
8939433,52167833,2015-10-26,46901018,Josh,"Room was comfy and private, and a welcome sight for tired eyes after long days in the city. Wi-fi and breakfast (with variety) included. It's on campus, so you'll take the good with the bad. Would highly recommend!"
8939433,52556843,2015-10-30,47131991,Linying,This is an awesome place to stay. The room is super nice. Very convenient commute to UW and downtown. Lots of bath towels available and a lot of food in the fridge for breakfast! Very good deal!
8939433,53292033,2015-11-07,47707363,Paola,"Dario and Ethan were very available through text with anything I needed. The house is spacious and clean. The Southwestern room is as pictured. You have all the basic things, spacious closet and plenty of shelf space. The only thing I would change is if there is a lock to the room. The kitchen has a good variety of breakfast items, from cereal/milk to muffins, eggs and apples. The bathroom had clean towels as well. Good location, very close to the University and near shopping area. Down the road are sorority/fraternity housing which can get a bit loud for a bit. Overall, if the room had a key, it would have been great!"
8939433,53570409,2015-11-09,11870828,Cody,"Host provided all details to house and access. Room was as pictured. Food in the fridge was a nice touch. Pretty neighborhood, frats one block over might be loud. "
8939433,53633654,2015-11-10,47272486,Jessica,"I'm easy to satisfy,  access to a fully stocked breakfast menu makes for a happy Jess. 

The room was as described, although I know the actual name has been changed a few times depending on the decor. Just something to note if your reservation says something different. 

Make note that this is the U-District and the campus is a stone's throw away. There are frat houses nearby and can be rowdy, but the house is set back from the street so noise is minimal."
8939433,54824662,2015-11-23,24955569,Meg,"Great communication, responsive, place is exactly as described, no complaints. I would stay again! My trip was quick so I wasn't able to enjoy all the amenities, but it was great to have the option. I also appreciated the off-street parking!"
8939433,54901483,2015-11-25,7896719,Miriam,"Ethan, the host, was very easy to communicate with via text/email. He was very responsive when a different guest had taken my room before I arrived. The bed was not the best, and the house was fairly cold, but there was a space heater available in my room. The bathroom was clean and linens easily available. 
The kitchen was well-stocked with cooking supplies as well as a wide variety of self-serve breakfast food!
The neighborhood is a little loud but very convenient for the UW. "

3732949,18426041,2014-08-26,19069617,Siddharth,"I was visiting Seattle in August to attend a conference. As I had never been to Seattle, I knew nothing about the city. Vanessa was a great host in that she took the time to answer all my questions about the accommodation and also about the city. She told me about how to commute in the city, places to see, places to eat etc. Her inputs were invaluable for my overall experience. 
The apartment was just 3 blocks away from the convention center, where my conference was. Also, the apartment was within 15 minute walking distance from Pike place market and the harbor. There were plenty of good restaurants close to the apartment. The apartment was also close to the Westlake train station. Hence it was convenient to take the train from the airport to this place. 
"
3732949,19631035,2014-09-15,16304021,Oksana,"Vanessa was very responsive and helpful. Her place was at a great location, walking distance to Pike market and across a great coffee shop. She was kind enough to leave us a bottle of wine and other goodies. Highly recommend :)"

Vanessa was great and flexible with our arrival schedules and once we arrived there wasn't much else that we needed to figure out with the helpful guides that she was kind enough to leave us. Perfect walking distance to all the bars and everything Capitol Hill has to offer but far enough away to not have to deal with the noise. Would definitely stay again.
3732949,26661072,2015-02-16,17297444,Guillaume,"A gorgeous apartment at the center of everything . The place was decorated with a lot of taste, a lot of art. Big windows, high ceilings, lots of light, a well equipped kitchen, beautiful fireplace, beautiful furniture and a very well designed space . 
I spent Valentine's Day weekend with my 6 year old son and we had a wonderful time , we walked down to Pike Place market , bought all kind of veggies and cooked them in the cocotte, went to play soccer at Cal Anderson park, had some ice cream at Molly Moo, went to the kids movie theater on 12th, went dancing at the Century ballroom, I think we could have spent a week there!

Vanessa really knows how to make her guests feel welcome. Extra points for the super packed toiletry basket !"
3732949,29506739,2015-04-08,19351135,Coleman,The condo was the perfect location for a first time Seattle visit.  Capital Hill is a happening place and Vanessa's condo is a beautiful space to pass some time in the area.  Definitely worth a visit or two!
3732949,29623537,2015-04-10,3572517,Christine,"We had a nice stay at Vanessa's place. It is in a great location in Seattle. It was a little noisy at night since it's on a busy street, but overall great place, very clean. Just make sure if there are 4 of you, there are enough towels as we were short 2 towels for our stay. "
8633733,52473066,2015-10-29,1819863,Brian,Mike was a great host! He was super responsive and accommodating. My wife and I stayed at Mike’s place while I was in town for a job interview. We had a great night sleep. Both the apartment and rooftop had an amazing view of the city. The neighborhood (Fremont) was really fun to explore. We would definitely stay here again.
8633733,53670353,2015-11-10,48453373,Tauseef,"Apartment was great and comfortable. I did not get the chance to meet Mike but he made sure someone was available to guide me through the check-in process. Getting access to the key was a bit confusing but after talking to the contact person over the phone, I was able to get in."
8633733,56864650,2015-12-19,49748266,Michael,"Great host! The apartment was as-advertised, clean, comfortable, and in great condition. Great lighting for those dismal Seattle winters and a beautiful view of the city over Lake Union. Mike was easy to reach with the few questions I had after checking in. I would definitely stay here again."
8633733,57981254,2015-12-30,13703286,Chase,"My girlfriend's and I experience was elevated by the gorgeous view south looking towards Downtown Seattle, the cool posters all over the apartment, and the ease of access working with Pillow Team.

I'd stay here again and again especially because of the Fremont neighborhood.

Highly recommended!"
9318440,54159356,2015-11-16,25777163,Lincy,Jocelyn and Michael are super responsive and were very welcoming.  They offered restaurant and tourist recommendations and we felt they were with us every step of the way!  We really felt they wanted us to be comfortable for our girls trip and we truly were.  The apartment is new and modern with a very nice layout.  We felt very safe especially because there's a lobby with an attendant.  The location is great too!  We could walk to almost anything and their description of the apartment and surrounding area is accurate.  We would definitely stay with Micheal and Jocelyn again and understand why they're super hosts! 
9318440,55156813,2015-11-28,36891082,Marshall,The apartment is in a great location and is very comfortable.  Jocelyn and Michael were very responsive to emails.  Would stay again.
2197168,10045530,2014-01-27,593308,Dana,"This was indeed a delightful cottage near the light rail. We really enjoyed staying there, it was comfy, accessible, and a pleasant stay. We highly recommend it. "
2197168,10168739,2014-02-03,3034453,Tanya,"Loved my stay in Seattle/Beacon Hill - Tammi has created a sweet and comfortable space that really felt like my home away from home.  Great decor, bedding, kitchen, cleanliness and communication. Highly recommend.  Easily accessible to Downtown and Capitol Hill. "
2197168,10327737,2014-02-13,2608359,Surya,"Tammi was a fabulous host! She was very attentive to our little family's needs - securing her cupboards with zip ties so our little one would be extra safe, and providing some tasty breakfast items - above and beyond our expectations for sure! 

The house was beautiful and cosy, which was particularly welcoming on a rainy evening with sleepy kids. This place is filled with natural light, warm wood and interesting art. Oh, and the beds were quite comfortable too. The front sitting room has a door so we used it as a third bedroom for our toddler's portable crib - very handy! We would definitely stay here again."
2197168,10437344,2014-02-18,8925916,Suzy,"Tammi's cottage was everthing we were hoping for and more. The location is very central for those needing to transit and has parking for those with a car (we required both). The cottage was exceptionally clean and we enjoyed the layout. We very much appreciated Tammi's attention to detail. Coffee, tea, milk and egg selections were not only locally sourced but organic and wholesome. We felt as though Tammi not only loved sharing her adorable space, but that she was good at it. We cannot wait to return. 

Many thanks, 
Suzy"
2197168,10535100,2014-02-24,11329672,Golnaz,"Tammi's home is the perfect place to stay in Seattle!! We had such a wonderful time because of not only how comfortable and beautiful Tammi's home is, but also because of what an amazing host she is! She was always available if we had questions or concerns (which we had none of because she was so thorough in preparing for our stay). She even left us coffee/tea and snacks for our morning breakfasts! 
I couldn't have asked for more! Thank you so much Tammi and I hope we can come back and stay some time soon! "
2197168,10691748,2014-03-03,666801,Melanie,"My stay with Tammi was awesome!  Her cottage was comfortable, adorable (I'm jealous, I want one just like it!) and she had everything we needed to feel at home (snacks, coffee/tea, and toiletries).  She made a weekend work trip feel like a mini vacation.  I would highly recommend staying here.  I would not have thought to pick this area for a Seattle stay, but it's actually really close to the city and easy to get there without getting on the freeway.  "
2197168,11018172,2014-03-17,9442875,Kate,"We had a lovely stay at the cottage! It's in a beautiful, safe area with friendly neighbours. Everything was extremely clean and comfortable. Tammi is so helpful and gave us a list of things to see in Seattle! My 3 y/o had a great time and asks when we're going back to our red Seattle house. Thanks for hosting us, Tammi, and hopefully we'll be back again!!"
2197168,11219903,2014-03-25,7320478,Anne,"We had a great stay here! The house is actually better, even, than the pictures, and  Tammi went above and beyond in every way to make our stay comfortable.  I was totally impressed on both accounts. We could definitely hear the downstairs tenant, which didn't bother us, but you should know. The house is very close to the light rail..maybe 7 min walk, tops.  The neighborhood is nice, not too much of a destination,  but there were some good coffee shops, and great street tacos. Thanks, Tammi for your hospitality! "
2197168,11273287,2014-03-27,12519661,Lisa,"Thanks Tammi, for a fantastic get-away home for me, my best friend, and her daughter!  Your place was a perfect size, and the kitchen/and how well it was stocked made our family meals great.
We all appreciated your comfy beds, how quiet your place was, and how at home we were in and amongst all of your books, warm furnishings and spacious kitchen."
2197168,11322412,2014-03-30,6967761,Matthew,"Beautiful place, super comfortable, great kitchen and Tammi was super helpful with telling us about cool places to go.  Would stay here again in half a heartbeat! "
2197168,11435393,2014-04-02,1985173,Melia,"We had such an amazing time in Seattle and staying at Tammi's cottage definitely shaped our travels for the better. Not only did she make us feel welcome and cared for but she was also extremely helpful with ideas of what to see and how to get there. I highly recommend staying at her cottage-it is a short walk (three blocks) and a train ride to downtown. So easy to hop on and check out the museum, Pike Place, the International District, etc. Thanks, Tammi!"
2197168,11478500,2014-04-04,9233915,Ted,"Tammi is an extremely gracious host, and she responded immediately to my request. Her place is well-appointed and cozy.  I love her stye and the house, and I felt very much at home.  This was the best airbnb bed I have ever slept in!  Organic french press coffee, fresh fruit, and cut flowers were a lovely touch.  The neighborhood has some great food and bars.  Tammi really went the extra mile when I left my iPad,  I'll be back.
Thank you again!"
2197168,11566233,2014-04-07,13669696,Mary,"Had a great stay at Tammi's. Lovely place, comfortable, very easy access to light rail. My daughter lives in the neighborhood so it was convenient to be close to her. Would use it again! "
2197168,11700588,2014-04-12,5960009,Olga,"I would highly recommend Tammi's rental, it was well appointed, clean and reflected the thought that went into putting this space together. Tammi also picked us up at the light rail stop at nearly 11 pm, dropped off our luggage and the brought us to the pub for a very late meal. 

A great stay!"
2197168,11796231,2014-04-15,6584510,Bridget,"Tammi was an amazing hostess. Before we had even arrived, she had sent us festival and restaurant suggestions and she remained this helpful and friendly throughout our visit. The house was great as well! Bright, clean, cozy, comfortable and in a great location near the light rail. My friends and I all look forward to coming back!"
2197168,11987631,2014-04-21,11346481,Danielle,"Staying at Tammy's was super comfy cozy and convenient for my friends and I to hop in the link light rail into Seattle for the Sakura con (Japanese anime convention). Tammy was super sweet to leave us awesome snacks,delicious coffee and tea. We would like to stay here again for next years Sakura con :)"
2197168,12164846,2014-04-24,5832273,Kari Margrethe,"I would recommend Tammi's place to anyone visiting Seattle! Our little family enjoyed three peaceful days in her beautiful house, with comfortable beds, a spacious and clean kitchen and an amazing little front garden, which my six-year old especially loved. It was all we could have wished for, and a little more. I only wished we could have stayed longer! 
"
2197168,12336566,2014-04-29,12302426,Zhengtao,"This is a great host. Tammi has a very nice house, she herself is also a very friendly landlord. She got everything ready for us. The house is only 10 minutes from downtown. I will stay in her house again."
2197168,12509416,2014-05-04,1828163,Sarah,"Tammi's place was utterly charming and very convenient!  The garden was delightful to sit in, the snacks were delicious and Tammi was so great to pick us up and drop us off at the train station even after the 2 of us ended up arriving separately.  I would definitely come here again!"
2197168,12782625,2014-05-11,13462117,Lauren,"When searching for a place to stay during our week-long trip to Seattle, Tammi's cottage stood out from the crowd for its convenience (literally two blocks from the light rail and a grocery store), beauty and charm.  Within the first hour of arriving, it felt like home.  The graceful decorations and thoughtful accents added to the feel of dropping in on a friend rather than a rental.  

As a host, Tammi was incredibly responsive and wonderful to work with on coordinate our visit.  She also thoughtfully stocked her cozy kitchen with a variety of snacks and light breakfast foods, of which we took full advantage during our stay!  We will definitely be in touch with Tammi the next time our travels take us to Seattle."
2197168,13066962,2014-05-19,2472006,Joan,"The experience was great, would stay again and have already recommended it to others.  The neighborhood was fine.  Tammi was a great host, very accommodating.  She had the house well stocked and even left us special treats.  The house was charming, we especially loved the front gate and the kitchen.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom was nice and large."
2197168,13358559,2014-05-26,1120962,Laura,"Tammi was easily the best airbnb host I've ever had.  She leaves her place packed with individually-picked snacks for you and little notes everywhere saying ""help yourself!""  She makes you feel abundantly taken care of and her place is so beautiful and charming. You can tell that she's given her decoration, furniture and artwork a lot of thought, which makes the cottage a joy to stay in."
2197168,13539967,2014-05-30,14059806,Peter,"It was a delight to meet Tammi and a pleasure to stay at her place.  The gift baskets upon arrival were an unexpected bonus and wish we had taken up her kind offer to collect us from the ferry terminal. Tammi picked us up from the rail station and showed us the features of the house and was available thoughout the length of our stay. Easy access to the light rail station for travel into the city though there is a bit of a climb to reach it.
The kitchen and fridge were well stocked for our cooking requirements.
Overall highly recommend staying here
"
2197168,13748569,2014-06-03,14708227,Carol,"TThis is the first time I have used AIR BNB and the whole process was great.  We loved staying with Tammi she was so helpful, with vegetarian restaraunt 
suggestions, and hikes. You enter the property through the gate ""door"" into an enchanted garden, the roses were wonderful. The house was comfy with every thing we needed.  We will definately return."
2197168,13883376,2014-06-07,2316057,Jen,Tammi was an extraordinary host who went above and beyond in making our stay special and inviting. Communication was easy and her place is cozy and homey. The kitchen was lovely and provided a fantastic meeting/work space for my colleagues and I.
2197168,14000485,2014-06-09,16370428,Jane,"This lovely cottage was like coming home.  Spotless and inviting every step of the way.  Great kitchen, thoughtfully planned. We stayed nearby for a training and it was wonderful to feel the comforts and delicious treats that were thoughtfully provided by Tammi.  
At the end of our stay we kept saying we wished we could stay longer!  Even though Tammi was out of town the communication and coordination was timely and responsive. 
 Fabulous!"
2197168,14166944,2014-06-13,13583697,Dave,"Very nice house and well furnished. Will rent again in the future. 

Close walk to the light rail making going/coming from Seattle very convenient. "
2197168,14358771,2014-06-17,10398923,Samuel,"Tammi's place is really nice and comfortable and neighborhood is quiet and clean. My friend and I felt totally at home. We cooked ourselves breakfast and made ourselves tea and coffee. She prepared snacks, food, and drinks in the fridge for us to use. Totally love the place!"
2197168,14864572,2014-06-28,986456,Samantha,"Our time at Tammi's cottage was so lovely! The rooms sing with personality and attention to detail. The cottage is located in a safe and quiet neighborhood that we felt was very walkable. The kitchen was so inviting that we spent every morning making breakfast rather than leaving for food. My boyfriend and I felt right at home during our stay; I even picked a book from Tammi's library to read through the duration of my visit (She's Come Undone by Wally Lamb). I chose this place specifically for its proximity to the LightRail, and with it being my first experience with AirBnB, the cottage exceeded all my expectations by being so conveniently close to everything. Be sure to check out The Station coffee shop on your visit. I hope to book here again in the future."
2197168,15341863,2014-07-07,16676052,Lawrence,"My daughter an I had a very pleasant stay at the little house owned by Tammi, who was a most helpful host.  We especially enjoyed the kitchen facilities and the various provisions Tammi obtained for us in advance of our visit.  We also enjoyed picking raspberries from the garden in the back.  The neighborhood was quiet and a good launching point for our various excursions."
2197168,15696078,2014-07-14,7160173,Mikel,"woww, Tammy is so kind and helpful in every way! the cottage is really well located near downtown and there is no problem for parking th car. the cotage is clean and cozy, and Tammy preparef the fridge with tea, milk, yoghourts and (website hidden) has been such a great experience! we will go back for sure! Thank you Tammy so much for your kindness!!!! great host!!! :-)"
2197168,16736719,2014-08-01,18041536,Michael,"My girlfriend Lauren and I visited Seattle for a concert her first time in the city, my second).  This was our very first time using airbnb, and all I have to say is that Tammi has made us believers of this site.  She was amazing!

From the very beginning (a few weeks before we flew in to Seattle) Tammi did more than what I hoped for in making sure our visit went well.  She shared with us lots of great stuff concerning the city/neighborhood/cottage.

The house and neighborhood were both amazing!  I am a fan of public transportation, so it was great that the cottage was SO close (about 3 blocks).  Once we arrived to Seattle, Tammi made sure we had more than we needed to have a great stay (light breakfast, snacks, fresh tea, and even a free Uber ride!).

We only stayed for 2 nights because we had plans to visit Portland the day after our concert, but we left wishing we had stayed in Seattle - and at Tammi's -  our entire vacation.  It was that great.

Thanks Tammi!"
2197168,17002126,2014-08-05,184251,Kristin,"Our stay was perfect! The cottage was exactly as posted. Though quaint (smaller rooms), we had plenty of space for 2 couples with kids. The cottage was well-appointed and the hostess had thought through every detail. So many small, great details and every accommodation provided for (throw blankets for lounging in the chilly evening, snacks for the mornings, robes and slippers, extra toiletries and bath bubbles, games and amazing selection of books, fascinating pictures and art, shopping bags since Seattle charges, little yard space, laundry detergent, and on and on). The hostess was friendly, generous and delightful! She specifically provided kid-centric information, but also answered our every question (coffee? Wine store? Running routes?). Additionally the neighborhood was perfect. Amazing views and every convenience...if you're worried about not being directly downtown, this location was uber convenient to the light rail which ran often, was easy to use and CHEAP. And only 15 minutes to downtown. we were worried, but totally worth it to stay just out of downtown. Oh, and we happened to stay SeaFair weekend and had a great view of the Blue Angels air show and fireworks from the front yard. Just amazing! Absolutely perfect vacation!!"
2197168,17166817,2014-08-08,4356141,John,"We had a great time! The house is beautiful, a classic, a mix of vintage and modern in the right places. After busy days traveling and in Seattle quiet evenings on the front porch were a treat. Being close to the light rail was a big bonus for us, made access into the heart of downtown super easy. Getting a parking spot on the street out front was no problem. If you are a fan of early 19th century houses, this neighborhood is a treat. Highly recommended. "
2197168,17517512,2014-08-13,6977942,Michelle,"Tammi's house was amazing! I don't know if she moonlights as an interior designer, or maybe she just has awesome style. The house is decorated in gorgeous colors with natural woods and unique items throughout. All of the amenities are there; dishware, laundry, street parking, lovely yard, front porch, comfy beds, living room plus a separate TV room, cable, wifi, and plenty of extra personal items to borrow if you happened to forget something.

Tammi was great with communication. She contacted with information about the home about a week ahead of time and she also inquired aobut our food preferences, allergies, etc... She provided fresh fruit and snacks, plus small breakfast items as well. It was lovely. 

The neighborhood is extremely quiet but also close to markets, restaurants and transportation. It was easy to get to downtown and the international district. Overall, it was a lovely stay!"
2197168,17641985,2014-08-15,18777309,James,"My friend and I stayed at Tammi's cottage for 2 nights when we travelled to Seattle. This was one of my first airbnb experience so I was a little nervous about the whole check in process and how everything would go. First of all, Tammi is an AMAZING host. We never got to meet her as she was out of town, but communication with her was very easy and everything couldn't have gone better. The cottage is very cozy and really makes you feel like your at home while on vacation. The snacks she provided for us made it feel even more like we were at home. As it was our first time visiting Seattle, we weren't too sure about where to visit and what to do, that was not a problem as Tammi provided us with maps and magazines of all the stuff we could do in Seattle! The cottage is in a very nice neighbourhood with many restaurants nearby and only a 5 minute drive into downtown Seattle! This was an amazing experience and I definitely recommend to book with Tammi! I really hope to be back and book again with Tammi when I visit Seattle again in the future! "
2197168,18091162,2014-08-21,52822,Rica,"The cottage itself is spacious, modern, bright, and very comfortable. Tammi thought of everything to help make our stay comfortable: healthy snacks, information about tourist sites/restaurants/transportation routes, even half and half for the coffee!  She was available to help us during our stay, including recommending an excellent shoe store.  We only regret not staying longer."
2197168,18351839,2014-08-25,19164646,Andreas,"I felt at home the very moment I entered this cottage. The wooden floor and the kitchen were the parts I loved most about this place, but everything else in Tammi's apartment is great. Be warned that you might miss some of Seattle, at least for me I found it hard to step outside this lovely place ;)
The neighborhood is very quiet and friendly. I got great coffee in the nearby coffeeshop ""The Station"" that is list in Tammi's guest recommendation brochure (another highlight of this place). Checkin and checkout was very uncomplicated, and Tammi was very responsive over Airbnb chat for all my questions. I had a quick chat with Tammi on checkout, and I was very happy to learn who is behind this beautiful place. Will definitely come back the next time I visit Seattle."
2197168,18495169,2014-08-27,6050490,Jason,"My family enjoyed our stay at Tammi's cottage!  The cottage is very comfortable, decorated well, and the kitchen is great!  The location is also nice, being very close to public transportation and a quick drive to downtown as well. Free street parking is also immediately outside the door and there was never a problem finding a spot right in front of the house. We would definitely stay at Tammi's cottage if we return to Seattle!"
2197168,18632269,2014-08-29,20072527,Julie,The cottage was absolutely beautiful! Tammi was an amazing host! I cannot express in words how fantastic out stay was! Great location!! Highly recommended!!
2197168,18901076,2014-09-02,14518993,Heather,"Fantastic place and Tammi let's no detail go unnoticed, including healthy snack foods, great coffee, wonderful books and poetry, and a variety of other items that make you feel comfortable and settled. We would certainly stay here again!

"
2197168,19291415,2014-09-09,2845214,David,"Tammi's house is beautiful and very comfortable -- just like walking into your own home. The house is only 3 blocks from the Beacon Hill light rail station but the neighborhood is quiet and seemed safe to me. The amenities of the house are first class and the bed and furniture are comfortable. Tammi sent me a long list of local restaurants, grocery stores, etc., before my arrival, so it was easy to find what I needed in the neighborhood. The close proximity of the house to the light rail station was a very valuable feature of this house."
2197168,19546386,2014-09-14,5111021,Sara,We had a wonderful stay at Tammi's sweet little home! We arrived and immediately felt welcome. She had bought us treats for breakfast and snacks which was totally above and beyond. The place was very cute and comfortable and an easy 10-15 min trip into the city by light tail or car. We felt very much at home and it greatly enhanced our trip to Seattle. Thanks Tammi! 
2197168,19692746,2014-09-16,3281293,Leslie,"We really felt at home right away in Tammi's sweet little cottage in Beacon Hill.  Tammi welcomed us by having snacks, breakfast treats and fresh flowers ready for us.  She responded quickly to our texted questions. The cottage was lovely -- well-equipped and comfortable and full of creative surprises.  The neighborhood is interesting and looks like it's up and coming with lots of renovations of older houses going on.  The cottage is close to the light rail and downtown.  We'll certainly come back here when we are in Seattle!"
2197168,19951276,2014-09-21,20446212,Jill,"Tammi was the most gracious host!   The emails and the preparations at the home made us feel welcome not only in the house but in the city.  The light rail is so convenient - we used it every day.  The cottage is ADORABLE!  Neat, comfortable, and well-stocked, we felt completely at home.  The neighborhood is very quiet and interesting.  I would highly recommend staying here while in Seattle!  "
2197168,20203122,2014-09-25,19045634,Stephen,"Tammi was an absolutely wonderful host. She picked us up from the light rail station to make sure we got to the house okay, and then gave us a personal tour. She was also very thoughtful in stocking the fridge with some essentials for my wife and I. From our conversations before we arrived and her direct attentiveness upon arrival, you could tell that she is a host who greatly enjoys making her guests feel welcome. 

As to the house itself, it is a beautiful and peaceful space. The kitchen is magnificent and is stocked with any cookery you could need. The house is on a quiet street and only a few blocks from the light rail. 

We will definitely be staying here again on future visits to Seattle."
2197168,20353159,2014-09-28,144780,Leticia,"Tammi welcomed us before we even arrived to Seattle with amazing suggestions of how to spend our family time in the city. There were thoughtful snacks and a clean, well-decorated house waiting on arrival. The house was exactly as described. The neighborhood is awesome - although we spent most of our time in the downtown area, which was very accessible by light rail. Without going into details, we had a small snafoo on Saturday that Tammi went above and beyond to handle so that we could enjoy our vacation. Tammi and her wonderful home are fabulous!"
2197168,20757576,2014-10-05,20735926,Ellis,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I can't imagine how it could have been any better!  We felt utterly spoiled-- from the snacks that Tammi provided on the counter and in the fridge especially for us (milk, cheese, yogurt, orange juice and more!), the insider tips for having a ball around her hip and fun neighborhood, restaurant recommendations and Seattle travel magazines and books.  Her house is in the best location: only three short blocks from the fast light rail that costs a mere 4 dollars round trip and drops you directly into the heart of the city.   We found it's a wonderfully diverse neighborhood surrounded by great restaurants that are all within walking distance (a few highly recommended by Tammi and tried and tested by us!), a large grocery store right near Tammi's home, and a generally very pleasant and safe vibe.  Her home was stylish, cozy and comfortable and with her warm personality we felt far more like we were staying over at a friend's house than anything else.  I cannot rate Tammi's cottage highly enough! She was charming, helpful, easy to communicate with and enthusiastic to answer any of our questions regarding the city, neighborhood or Seattle.  It would be impossible not to fall in love with her cottage.  You truly have to force yourself out of the house to go see Seattle as you'd be quite happy just reading a book from her bookshelf, making a cup of tea  and settling down on the couch to relax. We definitely plan on staying in Tammi's aptly named 'delightful cottage' next time we're in Seattle! Thanks so much, Tammi!  "
2197168,20968339,2014-10-08,9233915,Ted,"My second stay at Tammi's place was every bit as lovely as the first.
Thanks Tammi!"
2197168,21668293,2014-10-21,21512660,Pauline,"

Tammi is an excellent host.  Communication prior to visit excellent with detailed information. The cottage is well equiped and a comfortable homely atmosphere.  Position is great - a short walk from Beacon Hill light rail station and only 4 $ for an all day hop on off ticket.

2197168,22251507,2014-11-02,22251382,Maxine,"Amazing!! The house is adorable as well as easily accessible from the light rail, making trips downtown a breeze! Tammi is a perfect host -- she is so sweet and was always quick to make sure we had everything we needed and more! Thank you so much for the stay!! "
2197168,39945770,2015-07-27,28272649,Helen,We had a great time at Tammi's house. The place is beautiful and in a  really quiet neighbourhood. Being so close to the light rail was fantastic. She met us and was really helpful about recommending things.  I would definitely go back. 
2197168,40923442,2015-08-03,19070192,Camille,We loved staying at the cottage! It was a quick walk to the LINK light rail which took us pretty much everywhere we wanted to go and there was a grocery store nearby too (with Zipcars! So helpful for getting to hard-to-get-to places!). The cottage is cute and comfortable and had everything we could have possibly needed. Tammi was so helpful and even told me where to find some wrapping paper for the wedding we were going to! Thanks so much Tammi! 
2197168,41363305,2015-08-07,3642977,Rachel,"Tammi's cottage was wonderful! It was exactly as advertised. The cottage is super-cute, clean, quiet and tastefully decorated. My husband and I loved staying there. Tammi was a great host! Whenever we had a question she answered us promptly. She gave us a parking pass so we could park our rental car on the street, she also left us some goodies from Trader Joe's in the kitchen.
I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle."
2197168,42185284,2015-08-11,39306819,Wei,"All rooms were neat and clean when we came in. There were juice, milk, yogurt provided in the fridge, and snack on the table. Bathroom was very clean, also the kitchen. There were all kinds of cooking supplies. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly. Very cute cottage and we were surprised!"
2197168,42539597,2015-08-14,36293991,Nancy,"Tammi made us feel very welcome. She provided us with food, and her recommendations for coffee and dinner spots were excellent. She has a beautiful, spacious cottage in a lovely neighborhood, very close to public transit. The location is equidistant between the airport and downtown, which was especially convenient for us. We highly recommend her cottage!"
2197168,43495643,2015-08-20,31897356,Garrell,"I highly recommend Tammi's place. Everything about the cottage was as she described. Two nice rooms, a great kitchen and all the amenities that you will ever need. Parking is not a problem for those who are coming by car. There are food on the ref and the nearest grocery is a few minutes walk. The neighborhood is great, quiet enough to have a good night rest and also knowing that neighbors are there. 
The best part we enjoyed was cooking dinner and enjoying a family meal. Something we were really looking forward to as it was like a family reunion. Thank you Tammi! I hope we can come back again (really!)."
2197168,43935057,2015-08-23,28426940,Charlette,We had a wonderful stay at this delightful cottage.  Location was perfect for all the activities we had planned.  Our next visit to Seattle we are hopeful that it will be available again.  
2197168,44538751,2015-08-27,3967998,Virginia,"Tammi's cottage is so lovely -- the photos really don't do it justice. It was immaculately clean, and it contains so many charming details. Tammi has a great design sense and really put a lot of thought into creating a top-notch guest experience. She was a gracious host, with excellent communication, who provided dozens of little extra amenities, from snacks (including fresh plums from a tree in the backyard) to beauty products in the bathroom. I highly recommend staying in this beautiful, comfortable cottage!"
2197168,45259829,2015-09-01,36662961,Sharon,"My niece and I loved the cottage.  It was exactly how Tammi described it, and it had everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.  We especially loved the kitchen!  It really was like a home away from home - so much better than staying in a hotel.

The neighborhood was lovely also.  Just like Tammi described, there was so much within walking distance to the cottage.  Even though we rented a car in order to go out of Seattle, the closeness of the train station gave us flexibility to hop onto the train into downtown and not worry about driving/parking there.  Tammi provided books and maps that were also very helpful during our visit.

During our preparation for the trip to Seattle Tammi was very helpful.  She gave us wonderful advice and ideas for places to go (restaurants, sightseeing, etc.) and answered all of our questions.  It helped to make our visit even more enjoyable. "
2197168,45568032,2015-09-04,27360153,Karen,Tammi welcomed us with some great snacks and relevant travel information for the area.  
2197168,45952553,2015-09-07,36821821,Kelly,"Tammi was welcoming from the very first second that I booked the cottage.  She's an absolutely amazing and gracious host.  In addition to a top notch host, I absolutely loved the house.  If you plan on cooking your own meals, this is the place for you.  The kitchen is really well stocked and adorable to cook in.  I highly recommend booking with Tammi!"
2197168,46713930,2015-09-13,21980492,Anastasia,"Tammi's cottage is truly delightful.  It is located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood just a couple of blocks from a light rail station and walking distance from several coffee shops and a number of good restaurants.  It was quiet, comfortable, and full of interesting objects.  Tammi even provided us with plums from the tree in the backyard as well as other breakfast foods.  It was a pleasure to stay here."
2197168,47393382,2015-09-18,6583016,Jeff,Everything was perfect. Tammi made us feel welcome and the house was great.
2197168,48258001,2015-09-24,44492514,Danielle,"We loved our two night stay at Tammi's place. Tammi was a lovely host and has a beautiful home with great light. The light rail was a quick walk away, and very convenient for going downtown. We loved having our morning coffee on the porch and coming back to the house after a great day of exploring in the city. Tammi had even left some snacks for us. We would definitely stay here again! "
2197168,48898397,2015-09-29,41837991,Jennifer,"Tammi was a great host and did an amazing job of helping us feel welcome and at home.  I was travelling with my mother on her first trip to Seattle and felt that staying in an Airbnb would be a better option than a hotel.  And it was!  

Tammi provided snacks (I ate a whole bag of Carolina BBQ chips because they were just so good), information on the neighborhood (maps/directions/best of) and offered her own personal items if needed (I borrowed a tote bag to gather pine cones.)  The house is cozy and in a quiet neighborhood - which is great because I am a light/grumpy sleeper.  And the location was perfect - easy to get onto the highways and super easy to get into downtown Seattle.  Tammi was very responsive and helpful before, during and after the stay. 

I highly recommend this cottage for your stay in Seattle.   "
2197168,49496679,2015-10-04,37176678,Tanya,Everything was great. The house is perfect for a weekend getaway in Seattle.  Clean and comfy and easy. I would stay here again for sure. 
2197168,50500302,2015-10-12,44097594,Danelle,"This was my first Airbnb experience. Tammi's home is very cozy and perfect for a single guest or multiple guests. Lots of light and space. As an architectural designer, it was one of the loveliest homes I've been in. I felt very much at home while staying there. She had a print out of recommendations for places to eat and places to go that are near the house, which I referenced multiple times. She had snacks, coffee and tea for me. The bathroom had all products, clean towels, and amenities one would need. She even asked if there was anything in particular that I would like in the house for my stay. I asked for some organic milk and sugar and she made sure there was plenty for my stay. She had plenty of magazines to read and a small tv in the study. Neighbors are friendly. I would highly recommend it to anyone. And if I ever had to stay in another Airbnb in Seattle, Tammi's is where I would stay."
2197168,51089319,2015-10-17,38128061,Jennifer,"This place is amazing and Tammi is utterly wonderful! When she found out we were in town due to a family emergency, she did everything she could to make it easy for us to check in. And she even offered to bring snacks to the hospital for us! The cottage was a great place to unwind after long days at the ICU. It will definitely be my first choice when I'm looking for lodging in the future. "
2197168,51624847,2015-10-22,43968138,Jody (And Randy),"Our stay truly was delightful. We've only used Airbnb four times, but this was far and away the best experience. It's the first for which the host actually provided the second ""b"" (breakfast) part of it. We almost felt guilty about it! The place is super cozy, super clean, and conveniently located. And Tammi (and her helper, Jennifer)? Amazing! Communicative and sweet. We hope to visit Seattle again soon to take in more of the city and the delightful cottage!"
2197168,51937244,2015-10-25,44942708,Philip,"The place had excellent reviews and lived up to all of them. Tammi met us at the gate and was very warm and welcoming. The place was spotless, pretty and well-equipped. I stayed with my parents and son. All were pleased. Lots of nice snacks to eat upon arrival and eggs, milk, etc. to make a nice breakfast. There was even a wide selection of terrific shampoos and soap in the bathroom. The neighborhood is nice enough. Typical of Seattle and right on the light rail line. Overall, we were all pleased."
2197168,53523180,2015-11-09,41390639,Melody,"I stayed here for two weeks and I truly enjoyed it. The house is charming, and I felt right at home. The kitchen is very well equipped and even has a dishwasher and gas stove. The WiFi, cable TV, heat, and plumbing all worked well. There are lots of little unexpected touches in the house that made it so comfortable--black-out blinds, pillowtop mattress, dimmer switches, makeup mirror--I could go on and on. The neighborhood is convenient, friendly, and quiet. Tammi was very responsive to any questions I had. She even dropped off a huge bag of Halloween candy for me after I asked if I should get some to hand out! All the trick or treaters who came by were great fun."
2197168,54137915,2015-11-16,636100,Thomas,This place is perfect for the tourist who wants to live like a local. Transportation options are close by. Parking also is easy if you choose to have a car. Very walkable neighborhood. The kitchen makes the place special!
2197168,54687130,2015-11-22,7244456,Kevin,Fantastic place and great location! Exceeded expectations!
2197168,55198994,2015-11-29,16201887,John,"We greatly enjoyed staying in Tammi's house over Thanksgiving. The house is very well equipped with all the comforts of home. I was especially pleased with how quiet and peaceful the neighborhood is. An additional bonus is how convenient it is to coffee shops, transportation and a grocery store located right up the street. Tammi kindly provided us with a list of good restaurants in the neighborhood and we managed to visit all of them. Parking is easy and always available. We hope to stay here again the next time we visit Seattle."
2197168,56451218,2015-12-13,3078132,Heather,"Super sweet home - clean, cozy, and comfortable. Tammi was an excellent communicator, flexible with times, and created a wonderful place to stay. The home is well laid-out, with extra touches, like snacks and some bath products, that made it really easy to just show up and settle in. Close to light rail and lots of other amenities."
2197168,56816940,2015-12-18,2971596,Brittany,"Tammi's place is my favorite Airbnb so far. Upon arrival she had prepared some gluten-free breakfast items for me and the heat was on. The home was well-stocked with kitchen implements and all the linens I needed. Beautiful design, comfy beds, stylish decorations. I secretly hope no one else stays here so I can keep booking it over and over on my business trips to the city :)"
2197168,57264619,2015-12-23,51500178,Jing,"We had great time at this lovely cottage. It is five minutes walk from the light rail and a super market just opposite the station. The cottage had everything we need to feel like home. It is very clean. We even enjoyed cooking while we are far away from home. Tammi is also very helpful for giving us advise and recommendations. Thank you, Tammi."
2197168,58199040,2016-01-01,40730787,Damien,That was one of our best stays through AirBnB. The house is small but cozy. The kitchen is very well appointed so if you like to cook this is a great choice. The location close to the rail station is also especially convenient. Will definitely rent again.
5705161,28509300,2015-03-24,23761975,Kimberly,Chris and his home were both great. I needed a room quickly and he was able to accommodate all of my needs. He responded very quick to all questions and was very helpful. Loved the bed and view! 
5705161,28638968,2015-03-27,29964501,Lake," Once arriving at the apartment, Chris was quick to let us in. The room was clean and very well put together, and even had its own thermostat, a welcome edition to our stay. The view was nice, although you have to go out on the balcony to see it well, and a few times throughout the night planes flew over, although they weren't so loud we found it a problem, though I know of people that would. Overall Chris was a very gracious and hospitable host, and if you're looking for a nice place to stay, you could do a lot worse than Chris' home. "
5705161,28690573,2015-03-28,3152135,Dalphy,"I'm so glad I found this excellent place. I needed a place last minute to stay for an evening of exploring Seattle with my friend. Chris gave a real fast response and his airbnb is very well organized and prepared to fit with your needs and/or schedule. My friend had to come from SeaTac Airport around rush hour and could simply take a 25 min light rail ride to Beacon Hill Station, a few blocks away. Time to downtown was maybe 5-10 min drive, very close. I had the pleasure of meeting Chris himself and his lady, they were super friendly and really helpful. They made sure we had everything we needed and gave us plenty of options for food and bars to try out. Annie, the dog, is the most relaxed, friendly dog ever, doesnt bark or jump on you, she is very peaceful. The room and bathroom were really clean and cute and on top of it all, they have a superb view from the balcony, could see downtown, the mountains at Olympic Peninsula and Mt Rainier! I'll come stay there again next visit to Seattle.  "
5705161,28975276,2015-04-01,29895536,Biao,"It was great to live in Chris's condo which was clean and cozy! I can get a very good view in their balcony either in the day or at night. They are very friendly people although I didn't have many chances to talk with them because I went home late. Their dog, Annie, is very friendly as well. I do like Annie keeping me company! "
5705161,29028582,2015-04-02,21383881,Philipp,"Nice hosts and a very nice apartment with a great view over Seattle.
thanks"
5705161,29148834,2015-04-04,30370811,Kaela,"Our host Chris was a wonderful understanding person for opening up his home to us midweek. The accommodations were clean and comfortable and nothing beats that view! I spent more time on that balcony than I did in the condo! I can't forget to mention his wonderful sweet golden retriever Annie who will follow you everywhere for ear scratches and belly rubs if you let her.
Also, this place is a quick drive away from the heart of Seattle and we have no complaints about being able to find our way around.
Thank you again for everything Chris! If I'm ever in the area again you can bet that I'll be checking to see if your place us available!
~Kaela and Kyle"
5705161,29232035,2015-04-05,30236664,Sabrina,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a more inexpensive way to stay near Seattle so when we found Chris's place, we were excited to try out the airbnb. When we arrived at Chris's pace he provided very detailed instructions on how to get there and get inside. He was there when we arrived and took off shortly after, the view was intoxicating and the bedroom and bathroom were private and very clean. We were in the city the majority of the time but over all very satisfied. And Annie was the most precious dog I have ever met and I'm going to miss her:). Thank you Chris!! We will be back! "
5705161,29444024,2015-04-07,14425057,Jeremy,The perfect stay with an amazing view! Chris was very welcoming and accomodating to any requests or questions we had. I'll definitely be checking out his spot any time I'm in Seattle.
5705161,29537779,2015-04-08,5422446,David,Great communication and easy check-in. Cozy room in a cool spot too. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again. 
5705161,29872692,2015-04-13,30284035,Jon,"Delightful place in a neighborhood with easy access to everything from Seattle's Central Park to the airport. Clean and well kept -- and the view is exactly as described.  Don't miss brunch at the Volunteer Park Cafe if you have time. 
"
5705161,29992273,2015-04-15,16170537,Joy,"Chris was a great host - his place is amazing! The view of Seattle city skyline was incredible. He was very welcoming and contacted us prior to our stay there which was great. The room and apartment is warm, lovely and clean. We only stayed for a couple of days but wished we could have stayed for longer! 

Parking is also relatively convenient on the street since we had a car. And Chris's apartment is very close to places downtown. "
5705161,30112120,2015-04-17,26386980,Victor,"Staying in Chris' place was WONDERFUL!!!  HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend it!  Place is spaceous, CLEAN, and delightful.  Annie, aka ""Goofy"", the dog is friendly and so mellow.  WE LOVED IT!  Chris and Holly were extremely accommodating and friendly.  Their view is spectacular.  Parking is safe and easy.  Everything is pretty easy to get to from one point to another.  

There were two of us.  Chris was kind enough to set up a second bed.  If I can recall correctly, at first, I think Chris said the second bed might make the space tight.  But even with the second bed, the room was still very nice.  

In addition, we arrived quite late to Chris' place.  Chris made it so easy for us to get in without any problem at all.  Chris also maintained communication throughout and made it so easy!!

Highly recommend it and would LOVE to stay here again!!!

THANK YOU, Chris and Holly!!!!"
5705161,30331715,2015-04-20,26126764,Stefanie,"The place is as described, it's clean and really nice. The view is amazing. I would definitely go there again, not only because of the place but also because of the dog Annie! :) 
"
5705161,30407066,2015-04-21,30102255,Carolina,Chris's place is a cosy gem close to downtown.  The bed was comfortable with ample pillows and blankets. The bathroom was excellent with a high pressure shower and was very clean. My friend and I were reliant on public transport and found it very easy to navigate our way around. It is a quick 5 min walk to the bus stop that takes you directly downtown. I really enjoyed staying out of the city and enjoying the skyline from far away. The view is priceless from the balcony at night. Annie is such a wonderful dog and I wish I could've brought her home with me. This was a wonderful first experience of AirBnb.
5705161,30486332,2015-04-22,1019985,Nicolo,"Great stay, absolutely the best view in town, very smooth arrival. Both Chris and his wife were extremely nice and friendly: highly recommend!"
5705161,30733375,2015-04-26,25798082,Jennifer,Chris' place was just like the pictures! Beautiful view of Seattle skyline. We were only there for a brief stay but the room was perfect. It's right when you come in the door with a separate bathroom. We ran into Chris once in the morning but otherwise we were out exploring the city and must have kept missing each other at the condo. The place was very clean and organized. It was vey ideal since our arrival and departure times were not standard. Chris was very accommodating to out varied schedule. I would most certainly stay there again if I visit Seattle again 
5705161,30886438,2015-04-28,26769498,Jonathan,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle! Its conveniently located to the bus lines so its easy to get into town. The condo is on the top floor so its quiet and insulated with an incredible view. Chris and Holly were very nice and welcoming towards me, and Annie was so fun to play with! I had an audition for the Seattle Symphony and Chris helped reserve the pool house out front for me to practice in so I wouldn't disturb the other tenants. He was also very accommodating for my late check out so that I could pick up my luggage in the afternoon. If I come back to Seattle, I would definitely like to stay here again. "
5705161,30953990,2015-04-29,14865306,Motiejus,Chris was an awesome host and his place was great. The space was comfortable and clean. Chris' dog Annie was really chill and happy to see us.
5705161,31020038,2015-04-30,11590459,Troy,This was a great place. Very peaceful quiet and chris was always responsive. Annie the dog was just the friendliest and the view of seattle was amazing! Thanks for everything :)
5705161,31453064,2015-05-05,30283749,Tiffany,"First time I've used this service.. it was good. Chris was very friendly and informative. He wasn't there the weekend I stayed, but made sure I was set. Also, his dog... was my greeter and she is just simply adorable :)"
5705161,31658672,2015-05-08,25017107,Yang,"Very clean and lovely experience, strongly recommend."
5705161,32117560,2015-05-14,4532982,Karen,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  The description and photos are very accurate.  We felt at home and relaxed. The view is truly spectacular.   It is very easy to access the various Seattle destinations, either by car or public transport.  The neighborhood felt quite safe and we enjoyed several of the restaurants in the nearby International district.
I appreciated how responsive and helpful the hosts were for us.  Highly recommended!"
5705161,32215515,2015-05-15,19208878,Marie,"Chris' apartment was very nice. It was very clean, and parking didn't seem to be an issue (and I got there quite late at night). It was also quiet, and the room felt very private. The location was also great: very close to downtown, and the view was beautiful.

I only met Chris for a minute, but he seemed like a nice guy.

The only thing I didn't really care for was the bed; it was pretty uncomfortable.

Overall, I would definitely recommend."
5705161,32527006,2015-05-19,10227726,Jessica,"Chris' home was very nice and welcoming. We were instantly greeted by the sweetest golden retriever named Annie. His apartment has a nice layout with a balcony that has a great view of the downtown area from the south and the sports stadiums which were within walking distance. Parking outside of the condo complex was easy found a spot each night we were there just outside the gate. The surrounding neighborhood is very nice and quiet day or night. There is a nice little park nearby that offers an excellent view point of the city. We didn't get to meet Chris but everything was as he said it would be, we couldn't have been more pleased. It was an overall positive experience and we would recommend Chris' place to travelers wanting to visit Seattle."
5705161,32559636,2015-05-19,14453686,Kevin,"My wife and I had a great stay at Chris's apartment. It was clean and comfortable and Chris was friendly and helpful. Annie the dog is also pretty awesome; her goal in life is to collapse on the floor at the end of your bed. 

Chris is also some sort of towel-folding ninja."
5705161,32758481,2015-05-21,17228957,Yi Lin,"Matt and I stayed at Chris' place for two nights during our travels through Seattle, and were well taken care of during that time. Chris and his dog (Annie) were  very welcoming and the condo was homely and had everything that we needed, and on the bus lines that will take you downtown.  The condo was close to the Amtrak train station which we arrived from and departed from, and the apartment was clean and located close to the International District.

Thanks for the hospitality, Chris!"
5705161,33246958,2015-05-26,25106442,Tom,"What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! It was everything advertised. A warm welcome, spectacular view, and easy access via public transit to anywhere in the city. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. The family dog was super friendly and chill; she liked to rest nearby when no one else was home. The stay was perfect for what I needed for a long weekend!"
5705161,33472732,2015-05-28,27276696,Ami,"Chris was an excellent host and the accommodations were spot on. He provided entry and location details prior to arrival and his accommodation page on airbnb is welcoming and thoughtful. The suite was exactly what I needed for the overnight trip and I appreciated the thought that went into preparing the space. Plenty of outlets, fresh towels, basic toiletries and good lighting. The view from the patio is unbeatable. Best I've seen in Seattle by far. I would definitely stay here agin and recommend to someone looking for a place to stay. "
5705161,33579248,2015-05-30,19459534,Sarah,Great location. Space as described. Very comfortable. Great communication. Would stay here again. 
5705161,33666149,2015-05-31,30006342,Andy,"The listing was exactly as it was described. My girlfriend and I stayed only one night and weren't at the apartment very much, but when we were we were very comfortable and felt welcomed. The view is amazing and it was a pretty easy walk to get to the Mariners game."
5705161,34198300,2015-06-06,6632066,Ralf,"We stayed at Chris' place for 5 days.

Chris' room is as he described on the airbnb website. I wish that on arrival Chris would have given us a brief intro for using the kitchen, washing machine, where to find what etc. - we respect the owner's privacy and just do not want to open all drawers in a room in order to find what we are after. 
In the end we helped ourselves to make some space in the fridge (pretty full, ""ok"" clean), we haven't been sure if it is ok to use the lounge or balcony (later the week we just did).
So it was an ok stay for us - the bus 36 is certainly very convenient.
Please be aware that you hear planes during the day and the train throughout the night.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
The location is very convenient if you wish to take public transport to downtown (bus 36) - keep in mind, in the morning (around 8 am) the bus could be very crowded and the driver won;t let your hop onto the bus!)"
5705161,34297655,2015-06-07,30289169,Chelsea,The apartment was great with a beautiful view of Seattle! Had no trouble finding parking and Chris was very welcoming.
5705161,34699769,2015-06-11,63164,Salim,"I had a great time at Chris' place in North Beacon Hill. His apartment was clean and had everything you would need for a comfortable stay. The view from the balcony is amazing! There are two bus options right from the front door... quick access to Downtown and Capitol Hill. There is also a pool in the apartment complex. Even though there are many units in each apartment building in the complex, I heard absolutely no noise from neighbours at any time of day, so keep your ear plugs at home!

Thanks Chris and all the best!"
5705161,34793396,2015-06-12,5379193,Betty,A very convenient location and comfortable suite. Thanks!
5705161,35294594,2015-06-17,591542,Jessica,Our stay here was amazing! The #36 bus was perfect and only took a few short minutes to get downtown. It is a very secure complex and felt very safe. I would definitely recommend staying here! 
5705161,35393672,2015-06-18,33462952,Jessica,"Needed a place to stay for one night and this place was conveniently located close to Downtown Seattle. A very nice and comfortable room. Chris allowed us to drop our bags off before official check in time---it was a nice accommodation. He wasn't home at the time of our stay but he had a friend Hayley at home to make sure all was running smoothly. She was extremely friendly and helpful in answering our questions. Overall, an excellent experience."
5705161,35547205,2015-06-20,30231043,Scott,This is a great place with a awesome view of the city.  I am a huge sports fan this place is close and overlooks both Mariners and Seahawks Stadium. If you are planning to see a game or just want a great location in Seattle you should stay with Chris. The room was nice and it was less than a mile walk to the international district where there is a large variety of Asian restaurants and markets.  I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle for a long or short stay.
5705161,35688131,2015-06-21,22958735,Yao,The host is very nice and responsive. We really liked the apt. It is even better than in photos. It has a great ocean view and also downtown Seattle. The neighborhood is quite and safe. You can find lots of restaurants within 5mins drive.
5705161,36093277,2015-06-25,15765709,Steve,Neighborhood was pretty much nothing and residential. Not exactly convenient but a good view 
5705161,36522014,2015-06-29,25325017,Timm,"Had a great time at Chris' place.
He wasn't there during our stay but left easy to understand instructions and a bit of a guide to the city. 
The location is prime and the view is amazing!
Would stay again!"
5705161,36671124,2015-06-30,23831532,Donna,"Place is really good, good view, nice living room and great balcony place. We stay there for a night, it was wonderful!! Thank you so much."
5705161,36962193,2015-07-03,16836336,Li,"Chris (actually, it was Hailey, who host us) gave me instructions on how to get into the room beforehand. It was clear and can be followed easily. She was very nice and responsive to messages.  "
5705161,37096465,2015-07-04,30123970,Tori,"Great place to stay. A little far to walk from the downtown Seattle, but you can bus it or uber it. Comfortable and clean. "
5705161,37455552,2015-07-07,10155921,Stefan,"The biggest advantage of this place is the great view with everything from Mt. Rainier via Downtown and the Space Needle to the Olympic Mountains range and the waters in between. Apart from this, the place is nice, the room is cosy, the private bath works, the neighborhood is nothing special, but it's close to the noodle soup hotspots in Little Saigon and the bus takes you directly to downtown within a short time. I would recommend it."
5705161,37595082,2015-07-08,36166552,Tory,"The condo was in a beautiful location overlooking Seattle. Our host made everything super easy for our stay and we were in walking distance of everything. We were only there for the night to see a baseball game, but we had a great time!"
5705161,38428495,2015-07-15,36877323,Todd,"A wonderful experience. Check-in was a breeze, the accommodations were excellent. It was incredibly close to just about everything you normally want to do in Seattle, within walking distance really. it was easy to get to public transportation nearby and the freeway was a quick drive as well. 

Everything felt very relaxed. Our late-night arrival was no issue at all, and we did not feel like we were being rushed to leave on our check-out date. We had privacy and everything we needed, the caretaker of the place responded to our needs and concerns quickly. 

Only potential issues to note:
Parking is plentiful, but it is all street parking, and can be a little tricky to get at times
It is a bit of a walk to get to the unit from the street, and it is on an upper floor, which could be a potential issue for some guests. There is an elevator, however, and wheelchair access the whole way, so this shouldn't be seen as a big issue.

Neither of these things are the host's fault, obviously, and they weren't an issue for us, but I think them worth knowing in advance.

I actually feel we didn't take full advantage of the hospitality the host was willing to supply us with. The price was more than reasonable for what we got! 

A+ experience, would gladly stay again, and recommend to others."
5705161,38839512,2015-07-19,32690287,Sara,"What an amazing place to stay.      Across the street from a bus stop to take you anywhere.   Safe feeling area with lots of parking.    The actual home is welcoming, homey and comfortable.   Incredible view, comfortable bed,  accommodating bathroom.  Plenty of room and kitchen tools to make whatever you want and feel at home.    Hailey was there to host for Chris and she could not have been more welcoming.   My son turned 4 while we were there and she was so lovely with him, made him feel so special.   He was sad to leave her.      I can't think of a place in Seattle I would rather stay.  "
5705161,39378175,2015-07-23,23359052,Margaret,"We let ourselves in with the key with instructions from Hailey who returned soon after and she was very helpful with directions to get to and  from downtown.Met Chris later who was a really quiet person.
Hailey also gave us a lift to the station on our last day.
Thank you Hailey."
5705161,39619334,2015-07-25,33471320,Hong,"It was really a great experience. Everything is perfect. Chris was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean, cozy and quiet. The view from the balcony was fabulous!"
5705161,39920433,2015-07-27,16647138,Katrina,"A great spot!  We didn't get to meet Chris as he was out of town,  but he made check in very easy and straight forward.  The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable and the view was amazing! We found parking easily and getting to and from the highway was easy.  We were in town for a baseball game and it was within walking distance but otherwise there wasn't much in the immediate neighborhood that we found in terms of restaurants or bars. Still a great spot though!"
5705161,40209742,2015-07-29,32799549,Brian,"Host and house sitter were quick to respond to questions or concerns over text, house sitter and her boyfriend were very friendly in person and went to to bed early. Bathroom is accessible from within the common area, I had believed the bathroom was within the room before arriving but not too big of a deal. Location, within Seattle was the best without a question during our stay in Washington. Condo was clean, price was great, public parking is plentiful but can be confusing. Overall great experience, would stay again and recommend to others."
5705161,40440508,2015-07-31,2138586,Bethann,"I did not see the hosts the 2 days I was in Seattle, but they provided me with more than enough directions and information that I found their condo easily. The view is accurate as shown in the pictures; the room was clean and comfortable. There's not a ton going on in the neighborhood but it's a quick bus ride away from downtown and other areas of Seattle. "
5705161,40917591,2015-08-03,17418436,Michael,"A wonderful place to stay in Seattle. We got a warm welcome! Before we arrived we received information on how to get to the place, it was easy to find. 
The flat has the best view of Seattle, it is easy to get to the center either by bus or walking. There was bus timetables, maps of Seattle and recommendations on where to go in the room when we arrived.
The flat was clean. The room we stayed in was quiet."
5705161,41202170,2015-08-05,32364271,William,"Very nice and inviting. The view was excellent, as shown. Would highly recommend. "
5705161,42122247,2015-08-11,33229591,Tracey,"Me and my sister Jesse stayed at Chris's apartment for four days. Chris was out of town so we dealt with his friend Hailey. She was very responsive and friendly. Although we didn't get to meet hailey in person, me and my sister felt very welcome and at home. Our room was clean and nice as well. We throughly enjoyed our stay and if we ever make it back to Seattle we will definitely stay again. "
5705161,42393573,2015-08-13,14824146,Samuel,All very nice and we had a great stay. Very efficiently organised and we'd be very happy to stay again.
5705161,42681044,2015-08-15,34471444,Rhonda,"We were a little hesitant about  your location as some surrounding neighborhoods were a little shady.  However once we found your gated complex we were fine.  It was a very quiet complex.  There was no problem parking on the street in front of the Harwood.  Our hostess Hailey was friendly, and helpful.  Our accomodations were fine, and our room clean.  She recommended the pizzeria Humble Pie, and we loved it.  The view from the deck was postcard perfect.  Thanks for a reasonably priced place to stay in Seattle."
5705161,43362910,2015-08-19,33701824,Gary,"In Chris's absence Hailey made us welcome and comfortable. The apartment was spacious and in a good location, and the instructions on how to get there were easy to use. Our room and facities were clean and comfortable. We were pleased with the restaurant recommendations  and enjoyed our stay."
5705161,43627876,2015-08-21,36168514,Eric,"My friend and I stayed here for two nights, and it was a great experience. Chris wasn't there, but Hailey and Derek made us feel right at home. We were provided with detailed arrival instructions to get from the airport to their condo, and it went very smoothly. The room (as well as the entire condo) is very nice and clean, the bed is extremely comfortable and the second bed was prepared for us. We were provided with towels, along with beach towels in case we wanted to use the pool (which we did - it was very nice!) The view is amazing, and the #36 and #60 busses (which stop just outside the condo complex) are very convenient to get to everywhere that we wanted to go in the city. 
Hailey and Derek also gave us great suggestions for places to go in the area and other places in Seattle, in addition to those listed on this page, including restaurants, bars, and the observatory at the Columbia Center building downtown (highly recommended!) Overall this was a great experience, and I would stay there again in a heartbeat if I go back to Seattle. "
5705161,44415120,2015-08-26,31666131,Mary,"I was so pleased with my stay. The condo was great, and I felt right at home. It truly made my Seattle experience that much better."
5705161,44860851,2015-08-29,39558641,Jennifer,"A great place to stay if you're in Seattle. Beautiful views! The photos are accurate. Cute place, we felt very relaxed. It was nice to have access to the kitchen and patio. Parking available on the street, which is awesome! Hailey left us a list of cool places to go, which was very helpful. It was easy to find and in a good location. If you're thinking of renting a car and staying here- there's no real need, as you can walk to many places downtown and it's super hard to find parking downtown. I would for sure recommend this place. Easy access to get in and out, too, which was great."
5705161,45009531,2015-08-30,17921889,Joel,Chris and Hailey made it a really great stay.  The check-in process was easy and very accommodating to our schedule.  The room was clean and had everything we needed.  Close by street parking on a Friday evening was plentiful.  I would definitely consider staying here again when I visit Seattle.
5705161,45372805,2015-09-02,5462370,Coen,Het appartement is met de bus goed bereikbaar en het uitzicht is geweldig. Prima kamer. Wel even wennen omdat het een kamer is bij iemand anders in huis. Verder alles prima!
5705161,45579744,2015-09-04,39971622,Bryan,"A lovely room with views to die for, our hosts were accommodating and friendly. A must for the first timers to seattle. Public transit is half a block away and parking is easy to navigate."
5705161,45660360,2015-09-05,28372801,Melanie,My stay at Chris' was awesome! I was very tired when I arrived as I had travelled quite a bit by this stage. Chris was not there but Hayley and Derek were and hey we're both very welcoming and friendly. I was only there for one night but the experience was great and the room and bathroom were exactly as the picture stated and very clean. The bed was super comfy and I had the best nights sleep. If I was to go to Seattle again I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! 
5705161,45946283,2015-09-07,18353628,Taylor,It was awesome time staying here. Great location and a very comfortable place to stay. The view is incredible at night. 
5705161,46306358,2015-09-09,21263131,Jess,"Although we were only at Chris's place for 12 hours (or less!) it was a treat. Comfortable bed, great shower, clean and tidy. Hailey and Derek were very welcoming but also gave us our space. And the views lived up to the billing! "
5705161,46592501,2015-09-12,28488077,Geoffrey,房源描述准确，交通位置超级便利，一出门口就有公车站。
5705161,46886870,2015-09-14,35665135,Trang,"The stay at Hailey's was very comfortable. Even though our paths never crossed, she was very prompt on responding when I had any questions or needed help. Hailey made checking in and out simple and easy. Derek helped me figure out a bus route and was very kind. Overall a great stay! Thanks again!"
5705161,47151676,2015-09-16,16177142,Alice,"Our stay here was exactly what we needed. Good location, nice views and close to downtown. Hailey was a great host, she was quick to respond and was very accommodating. "
5705161,47474673,2015-09-19,37780097,Michiko,"３時ごろ到着しお留守でしたが、それまでのメールのやりとりでスムーズに入室することができました。滞在させていただいた部屋の居心地がよく、キッチンもとても使いやすくて快適でした。
すぐ目の前にバス停があって、ダウンタウンへの移動もとても便利で部屋から見える景色がとても素晴らしかったです。
滞在中もメールでこまめにやりとりができたので、急な変更にも対応していただきました。
シアトルは交通網がとても整っているので、パスカードを購入して活用するのがおすすめです。スマートフォンとグーグルマップがあれば、どこでも行けます！！"
5705161,48253607,2015-09-24,44759326,Mary,"We could not have gotten luckier with this find! It totally exceeded our expectations and the view was absolutely incredible. Instructions for access and directions were given and we had no problems finding the location or entering the premises. It was very clean and was exactly like the description and pictures. We met Derek who lives in the place, and he was very friendly and outgoing and made sure we felt at home. This place is a total steal and if you are able to book it, DO IT. "
5705161,49226691,2015-10-02,27529443,Saskia,"We had a great time in Haileys flat. It was absolutely clean, the bed was really comfortable and Hailey friendly and welcoming. The communication was easy. She replied all of my questions in a few minutes. The way to the city centre by bus is easy and the view from the balcony amazing. 
Our stay there was short but perfect! Thank you Hailey for being such a great host, the nice chat with you and your boyfriend and for the apple pie!
Saskia and Constantin "
5705161,49884565,2015-10-07,39255437,Michael,"Perfect experience.  Came in for the Seattle Seahawks game, Derek and Hailey had everything set up for us.  Great e-mail details about local bars, restaurants, and also details about access to getting to and from places and how to get settled into the place.  Hosts were extremely accommodating and would recommend their place to anyone.  Also the view was astounding to sports fans overlooking the stadiums and the downtown area.  Easy 10-15 minute walk from the place."
5705161,50070348,2015-10-09,31768301,Ines,It's a nice house with beautiful view. Live in the room  with the happy couple is such a nice experience. U can have all the cooking tools with you. And the bus stop is just cross the street.Highly recommended. 
5705161,50204627,2015-10-10,23352555,Glenn,This has been a fabulous host experience. Hailey and her Derek joined us at her apartment later on and it was great chatting it up like friends. The views are spectacular! I would love to visit again. 
5705161,50623164,2015-10-13,38960019,Gloria,"""We enjoyed our stay in your lovely home....thank you so much for sharing!  Home has a beautiful view....bed very comfortable....for me only thing missing....Kleenex!""  "

5705161,51119525,2015-10-18,35628203,Dustin,The pictures do not do the view justice. We were stunned by the view from Chris's place. Chris was quick to communicate and everything was set up to make checking in a breeze. The location was great to easily get around the city. We were able to park our car and not use it while we stayed there. Would happily stay here again.
5705161,51438822,2015-10-20,27899532,Sheryl,"My Husband and I can't say enough. We had a fabulous stay and our room was just like they described. Also very helpful with directions to get to Centrylink stadium which was only a hop away. The city view at night was breath taking.  I just sat on the couch and looked out the window.  The apt complex well cared for and we felt very safe even walking down to the game. 
Thanks you both so very much oh and Isabelle is a sweetheart"
5705161,52064504,2015-10-26,7553648,Ross,"Although we never met Hailey or Chris, contact with them was easy and all information necessary for us to find the place, and navigate around town was provided in a timely manner.  The Condo itself was well positioned in terms of bus links to downtown, and the views really were exceptional.  Happy to recommend."
5705161,52297545,2015-10-27,6737959,Linde,Chris and Hailey were very hospitable and flexible. We could drop off our luggage earlier and leave it there later. They were very easy to communicate with and answered all our questions quickly. 
5705161,52540625,2015-10-30,47142709,Mark,"Our stay at Derek and Hailey's was wonderful. The pictures do not do their view justice. Their condo was cute, tidy and put together and the bed in their guestroom was super comfortable. The guest bathroom was private, spacious, and the shower head in the bath was a nice touch. Bonus points for their awesome trader joes toiletries. We didnt have a chance to meet Hailey but Derek was really friendly and pleasant and he had a lot of knowledge of the area."
5705161,52701543,2015-11-01,13836892,Brian,"The nicely made bed was very welcoming. The professionally cleaned room was appreciated. We also liked the fact that we were staying in a gated community--it felt very safe. The view from the deck was excellent.

The location was very convenient--it was easy to get to everything, and the easy and free street parking was a real plus. As a place to crash after a day on foot exploring the city, it worked great, and the room itself was very clean. Our only real wish was that there was more closet/drawer space in the room set aside for our clothing/luggage/etc. But as a whole it was a great value for the price.

Chris and Natalie were not home but were very quick to respond to messages and help with anything we needed."
5705161,52987700,2015-11-03,42650958,Li,"I like the apartment a lot, the fittings in the house is delicate, we have a good time there, also the house-owner is very kind and help us a lot."
5705161,53232188,2015-11-06,41481959,Simon,"A really nice quiet, clean room. Lovely apartment with great views over the harbour and city. Only 30 Min walk to the centre of Seattle."
5705161,53507708,2015-11-09,2364910,Amber & Zack,"Chris' condo was perfect for our weekend trip to Seattle! The location in Beacon Hill was very convenient - we rode the bus into the heart of the city and explored Pike Place Market, Belltown, the Space Needle and Pioneer Square. The room and bathroom were spotless, the view was awesome and the bed was super comfortable. Their recommendations were also spot-on! Chris and Hailey were great hosts. "
5705161,53979973,2015-11-15,32421416,Kyung Bae,"The location of Chris' house was really nice. Although the weather of Seattle was not good than I expected, staying at here was great experience. Very clean room and bath condition made me comfortable and happy. The night view was fantastic. I'll never forget the Seattle. "
5705161,54316547,2015-11-18,22131936,Joel,Great location for a stay in Seattle! Communication from Hailey was perfect and easy to follow! Definitely recommend staying with these guys! The apartments views are amazing and the facilities provided were great also!
5705161,54891819,2015-11-25,47631023,Adam,This was a clean and convenient place to stay. The hosts were welcoming and helpful. This was our first time with Air B and B and this experience was a good one. I would recommend this place to others who want a place near downtown Seattle.
5705161,55625037,2015-12-03,8166909,Greg,"Chris and Hailey were wonderful hosts! The place was very clean, quiet and perfect for my needs! And the headline is very true, ""best Seattle views""!! The view was amazing! I would definitely stay here again and recommend them to friends visiting Seattle!"
5705161,56123325,2015-12-09,42083351,Sharon,"Great experience. Hailay is nice, very informative. Her place is close to GT, very quiet. "
5705161,56580927,2015-12-14,125678,Niki,"I needed a very last minute place to stay, and Chris was very communicative and accommodating. So much so in fact, it could go on record as the Fastest Airbnb check-in ever; from booking to entry into the condo in 20 minutes total!

I had the place all to myself, and the view made it feel like my city. Really, there was a sort of magic about looking upon the cityscape like I was a queen in a modern day castle. The hot tub wasn't available - but the lightning fast replies and kindness from Chris and Hailey more than made up for it. Thanks guys!"
3882930,19401439,2014-09-11,21190567,Benjamin,"Morgan's home is beautifully furnished, and one step inside has you feeling as comfortable as if you'd been living there for years. You'll be staying in a very nice room complete with a cozy loveseat and enormous television (with clear instructions on how to use it), in addition to the twin sized bed. Morgan's attention to detail is what made my stay a pleasant one. Anything I could've asked for was already taken care of and waiting. Your time at Morgan's home will be enjoyable."
3882930,19572848,2014-09-14,21112677,Anne,"Morgan met me at the door and introduced herself and her super sweet dog, Maisy. They were both very kind. Morgan was very pleasant and  I felt I had a lot of privacy in the house. 
The room is super cute decorated with such curious flare. Colour and patterns that I would never dream of putting together just  look awesome and it makes the room very special. 
The lighting in the room is soft and dramatic. An amazing wood carved screen is placed tastefully in front of a lamp and it casts such a warm subtle light in the room.
The room also had some neat looking antique trinkets which add a lot of charm. It's not a huge room but it does have a big comfy chair to sit in and is way more cosy than a hotel room. 
The bed was very comfortable and the fact that the room had two windows (a first for me for a bedroom) made it very refreshing with the cool summer air whispering in. 
I would love to stay there again if I travel again to Seattle. "
3882930,19987685,2014-09-21,18136096,Pauline,"I really enjoyed staying in Morgan's house. It's beautiful, I would have appreciated to have more time to enjoy the garden. The room is perfect, with everything you need. 
The neighborhood is quiet, but you're not so far from Ballard so you can go out not so far from the room. 
And above all, Maisie is great to feel comfortable with! "
3882930,20729113,2014-10-04,21986647,Deborah,"Morgan was quick to respond and easy to reach. Her space was as she represented it to be. It was easy to stay and to come bs go. It was a great neighborhood to be in, as well."
3882930,22161918,2014-10-31,13008308,Travis,The Heart Home! Morgan and Mazie Dogg are very warm and welcoming hosts in a warm and welcoming home. The house is a quiet neighborhood and an easy walk to parks and a longer walk to Golden Gardens park. I would stay here again in the beat of a heart. 
3882930,25952226,2015-01-31,21699745,Sarah,"What a great airbnb experience! Morgan was very helpful in regards to recommending cute shops/places to eat in and around Ballard and her and her adorable dog Maisie were very welcoming. The house and room itself has a very warm, homey vibe and Morgan even has coffee/tea available for guests in the morning. As a travelling nurse, I had a more extended stay and Morgan was extremely accommodating. When I come back to Seattle, I would love to stay with her again! Glad to say I not only had a nice place to stay but also gained a new friend :) "
3882930,27785851,2015-03-11,20376807,Nikki,"Staying at Morgan's house was so comfortable that I booked with her a second time. Morgan is such a warm and helpful person. I felt at home in her house right away. Not to mention the bed is super comfy!! I slept great there. Also, her house is in a great location, I walked pretty easily into Ballard most nights to grab a bite to eat at the fun restaurants there. I definitely recommend staying at Morgan's place, especially if you're traveling alone and want a comfortable retreat to come back to!"
3882930,27973560,2015-03-15,8366700,Greg,Morgan and the pup were amazing hosts. Falling asleep in that cozy bedroom with the sound of rain out the open window lead to one of the bests night's sleep in a while. Highly recommend!
3882930,46047391,2015-09-07,6105823,Hector,"Staying with Morgan was the highlight of my trip to Seattle. It actually felt more like what I expect to experience at a regular bed and breakfast, namely having wonderful conversations with the hosts. Morgan was a totally engaged hostess and wonderful person. The accommodations were better than advertised, and I felt totally at home during my stay. "
3882930,46671659,2015-09-12,32988653,Karen,"Morgan's place felt very cozy. She was very nice as well as her little dog. I rented a car and was able to park it on the street with no problem. Bed was very comfortable and the area was fairly quiet. Overall, it was a very nice experience. "
3882930,46788708,2015-09-13,42803850,Jeffrey,"Very gracious hostess.  Welcomed me after a long day in class.  Gave me the bare necessities and left me on my own.  Just exactly what I needed.  Well appointed room.  Very nice house.  Bed was a little short for me, but I'm 6'4"" and short beds are nothing new.  Would stay there again."
3882930,46942125,2015-09-14,40909335,Shai,"My dog Jack and I had a wonderful stay with Morgan and Maisey. I felt right at home, as if staying with an old friend. The room is clean, comfortable and very well thought out. Morgan is thoughtful, considerate and very friendly. You will have everything you need and more. I highly recommend Morgan's place and would absolutely stay again. Thank you Morgan and Maisey!"
3882930,47055220,2015-09-15,31553365,Linda,"Morgan was a wonderful host, ready with suggestions, a little reference book in the room for local eateries, bus schedules around town, etc.  The room was cozy and welcoming, with a snack basket available, toiletries and coffee and tea in the kitchen.  The bed was so comfortable I would have taken it home with me!  I highly recommend this location for your next stay in Seattle and it certainly felt like home to me!"
3882930,48523536,2015-09-27,31142140,Jack,"Great location with an easy walk to downtown Ballard. Room was right next to bathroom and provided plenty of space to spread out. Morgan got a new bed while I was there and upgraded the room for free while I was out one night, coming home to a comfy new bed. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to enjoy the Ballard community."
3882930,49228258,2015-10-02,3119506,Tom,Perfect. Would stay every time I'm in Seattle
3882930,49701101,2015-10-05,29304092,Han,nice place
3882930,52227695,2015-10-27,43617038,Anthony,"From the first steps into the house, this was a most wonderful experience. The room is an oasis, the bed...well I wish the one at my home was as comfortable! The Heart House certainly lives up to the name. Located in a quiet area yet within easy access to shops and restaurants. Morgan and sweet Maisy make you feel so welcome. So nice to open the door and be greeted by them both! My first time with airbnb and I really hope I have an opportunity to stay with Morgan and Maisy again. "
3676779,16591031,2014-07-29,18295911,Melissa,"As this was our first AirBnb experience I had very little expectations, just a warm bed to sleep in that was relatively affordable.  All four of us were so pleasantly surprised at the quality of the accommodations as well as the hospitality of our host.  The host e-mailed me in advance and asked me if I needed anything.  I mentioned a coffee maker and said we would bring our own coffee.  She laid out clear instructions for us on getting there as well as getting the key conveniently if we arrived late.  

When we arrived the place was so warm and welcoming.  She gave us a bottle of wine and when we opened the fridge there was a bottle of water for each of us as well as cherries which was so generous and thoughtful.  We also noticed that she had coffee for us in the freezer but we had brought our own.  The stove was nice and they had furnished everything with quality items from the cookware to the eco-friendly dish washing soap and detergent.  We were so pleased with the care and consideration they took to make the place comfortable for us.  I also asked our host to make the bed in the living room to accommodate our friends who was travelling with us and they were so comfortable on the pull out bed.  It looked even bigger than the queen sized bed in the bedroom!  Our host contacted us that night asked us if we needed anything.  They were so thoughtful and nice.  They sent us a message regarding a fair going on at Downtown Seattle as well as a nearby Farmer's Market as well as restaurant recommendations.

The Farmer's Market was absolutely amazing with so many fresh food and flowers we were so grateful for the recommendation.  

On the last day we came home early and I had time to do laundry which was so easy with their HE appliances.

Overall I cannot say enough good things about our experience.  They were such amazing hosts and they were there if we needed anything but always respected our privacy.  The location was very convenient.  Quiet and away from the city yet only a 15 minute drive away.  It was such a beautiful and well maintained home you can really tell a lot of love went into the furnishings and everything was so tastefully decorated and comfortable.  We unpacked our things and used the dresser we felt that at home.  I would definitely stay in their accommodations again if in the area.  "
3676779,16803631,2014-08-02,2696510,Damian,"On the long and weary road of travel the best one can hope for is an easy landing in a safe and comfortable location: this private basement apartment is the perfect sanctuary to settle in for a few days. Easily commutable to downtown Seattle, coupled with pleasant walks through the gorgeous green-space of Ravenna park, this home-away-from-home is situated in a beautiful neighborhood. Great amenities, charming touches, and a minimalist design aesthetic combine to make this a great place to hang your hat for awhile. "
3676779,17016878,2014-08-05,18514672,Hastee,"This place is the greatest decision I ever made. The space was very comfortable. Mardi was super accommodating to all our needs and requests. I will definitely contact her again the next time I'm in Seattle. Rather than renting a car, we used Lyft and it was about $15 to get to all the tourist attractions in the area. Alternatively, bus stops are really close by and accessible. We enjoyed the board games and xbox. I would highly recommend her place. It felt like I had my own apartment in Seattle. Thanks, Mardi! We really appreciated everything you did for us!"
3676779,17303637,2014-08-10,11588321,John,"My husband, seventeen year old son and I found this lovely downstairs unit to be perfect for our four-night stay.  We thoroughly appreciated the location, as it took no more than twenty minutes to drive downtown and the University District itself is fun to wander through (we actually came to explore colleges in the area.)  We also enjoyed our proximity to such points of interest as Ballard, Fremont and Green Lake.  The home is situated on a quiet, residential street, full of other charming houses.  We slept soundly as both beds were extremely comfortable.  Although there was no oven, the kitchen had every other amenity, including a stove, microwave, toaster oven and a great coffee maker.  We found coffee in the freezer, along with a great supply of juice popsicles which hit the spot during the warm weather.  The fridge was stocked with orange juice, bottled waters and half and half.  The home was extremely clean and comfortable.  Mardi provided us with a fan which she had set up and turned on ahead of time, so the rooms were pleasantly cool upon arrival.  Our communications with our host were very smooth; Mardi responded to our requests for information promptly and we appreciated her availability (she contacted us ahead of time, asking if there was anything she could pick up for us at the grocery store.)  That said, she absolutely respected our privacy.  Mardi also had very good restaurant recommendations.  The price was great - a very good value.  We recommend it highly and would happily return."
3676779,17526262,2014-08-13,17639888,Krista,We had a great experience staying with Mardi! It was exactly what we needed and was exactly how it was described on the website.  We felt very comfortable in the suite and both beds were amazing! It was clean upon our arrival and Mardi picked up some fresh fruit and other groceries for us  to have when we arrived also. Mardi is very friendly and approachable and went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcome and had everything we needed. The neighbourhood was also great! There is an awesome little coffee shop/store right around the corner that we went to almost every morning.  We were in town for some baseball games and it only took us about 10 minutes to get right downtown. There are also several other neat neighborhoods and swimming spots that are all within 10 minutes of the house.  All in all it was our first time using air bnb and was a great experience. We will definitely stay with Mardi again if we are in Seattle and it is available! 
3676779,17717899,2014-08-16,438773,Ori,"Mardi was a fantastic host. She gave us great recommendations for the area and for our personal tastes. The accommodation was lovely - clean, comfortable and spacious. We (30's couple) felt very much at home. The neighborhood is nice - lots of university students nearby. Good restaurants within a short drive. I would certainly recommend to anyone - whether solo, couple or small family. I should add that Mardi was very responsive to all of our questions."
3676779,17957036,2014-08-19,3218632,Shelly,"Comfortable apartment in eclectic neighborhood!  Easy walking distance to  UW, restaurants, shops etc.  Host provided everything we needed as well as appreciated extras like bottled water in frig and fresh tomatoes.  Great stay."
3676779,18202078,2014-08-23,12427158,Dennis,"One word could describe our stay at Mardi and Dion - extraordinary!

The cellar apartment really have everything a small family traveling needs. Nice comfortable beds, a fully equipped kitchen (no full oven though, as they say in the description), plenty of space, and washer/dryer. 

Being near the University district there is plenty of nice eateries nearby. (Try the excellent indian food at Chili's). 
Transportationwise, the location is perfect as well. 10 minute walk to a busstop with several express lines to downtown Seattle, but still in a cozy and nice neighborhood.

But what really made the stay excellent, was Madri and Dion. They really went out of their way to make os feel at home, and our 7-year old daughter loved both the garden (and the chickens) and playing with their kids. We really really enjoyed staying there, and we hope we get the possibility to go back to Seattle at some point, and visit Mardi and Dion again at some point! 

Totally worth it!
 "
3676779,18558809,2014-08-28,19027593,John,"This property is in a fantastic location (within walking distance of UW, the University Villages shopping center, beautiful Ravenna park, and the Burke-Gilman trail).  There is a general store and café right around the corner.  Mardi was a very gracious hostess and was very attentive to our needs.  She even invited us to a neighborhood get together and used her social contacts to help us to find information we needed.  We are a family of four with pets and it was a tight squeeze, but very comfortable.  The bathroom is spacious and includes a washer and dryer.  The kids enjoyed the Xbox 360 and the WiFi was fast and dependable.  There is big fenced in back yard and very nice front porch.  Mardi also gave us two parking permits for our cars.  The description and photos on Airbnb are accurate and the neighborhood is safe and family friendly.  We will certainly stay here again."
3676779,18812510,2014-09-01,18927361,Aamir,"Mardi was an amazing host! As soon as we got there she gave us a full walkthrough of the place and gave great recommendations on fun things to do in the city. Even though she was away during our stay, she made herself extremely available to us -- and even offered us tomatoes from her garden! We truly had an amazing time here and would recommend Mardi to anyone. Thanks again Mardi!"
3676779,21003495,2014-10-09,21428512,Yi,Mardi made me feel welcome even before I left for Seattle. She asked what would we like her to store in the fridge and if we have any questions about Seattle. She nicely put orange juice and water and some fruits in the fridge for us before we arrived. She has made everything very easy for us. And when my car got towed away Mardi offered to take me to get the car back. It was really nice of her to do that.
3676779,21713273,2014-10-22,21736698,Jessica,"Mardi was an amazing host! This was my first Airbnb experience, and she has set the bar very high! She responded to all our messages very quickly, and even gave us directions on how to get to the apartment using the local transit system. The location is amazing - in a quiet neighborhood that is an easy distance from the University District. My friend and I had no trouble navigating the bus system. Definitely use an Orca pass! There is a bus route that goes express to the downtown area, and the stop is a few blocks away. The apartment had everything we would need, including a great kitchen and a washer and dryer in the bathroom. The bedroom and bunk beds were very comfortable. There was even an Xbox with games! All in all, an amazing choice. I highly recommend it for anyone who is looking for a quiet base camp while exploring Seattle. "
3676779,21856879,2014-10-25,675239,Heather,"Mardi's basement apartment was great! It was incredibly family friendly,very clean and had everything we needed and more for a comfortable stay. Communication was quick and helpful. There were even umbrellas for us to use by the door! I would definitely recommend and stay there again."
3676779,22092746,2014-10-29,1777273,Quinn,I had a wonderful stay at Mardi's! Very easy to check in and out. Clean space and a very comfortable bed.  The location was central and good for walking and close to the highway. Thanks!
3676779,22309021,2014-11-03,2515067,Juliet,"Mardi made us feel very welcome and was very quick to respond to questions over email.  She was flexible about arrival time and allowed us to bring our puppy, who we fenced off into the kitchen.  The space was perfect for me, my husband and my teenage son and would have been fine for one more person as well as there is a bunkbed in the main room.  Mardi thought of everything from a welcome bottle of wine and halloween candy to soap, shampoo, and a well-stocked kitchen with coffee and snacks.  The location was perfect for us, situated between Green Lake and the Montlake Cut where we were watching rowing races but would also be incredibly convenient to anything at the university.  We went for a run down Ravenna and around Green Lake and took the dog for a walk along Ravenna. Really great experience and we would definitely stay there again."
3676779,22893704,2014-11-17,9839453,Jacqueline,"Mardi's place is very cute and my friend and I were pleasantly surprised at how nice everything was arranged. We really felt comfortable and the place had all the amenities a traveler needs. Mardi left some snacks, teas and coffee and she even had a blender for us to use to make healthy smoothies. The neighborhood is one of my favorites in Seattle, there is a cute coffee shop around the corner, a Whole Food about a 15 min walk away, and a 5-10 min walk from the University Village Mall. Very convenient for us. We walked everywhere. The only thing I didn't really like was the noise from the heater. We came at a time when they had a cold snap so it was understandably on a lot. I would definitely stay here again. "
3676779,23011645,2014-11-20,22464979,David,Excellent. Everything was clean and Mardi was a great host. 
3676779,23195982,2014-11-24,20381188,Jon,Highly recommend this place. Mardi made sure we were very comfortable and it was the perfect place to stay for a weekend in Seattle.
3676779,23997508,2014-12-16,9766129,Jennifer,"Wow, what a perfect spot! We traveled to Seattle so my son could compete in the NFL's Punt, Pass, Kick competition.  The house was  wonderful for two teenage boys and two adults.  It had everything we needed and more.  Mardi was great in helping us navigate the public transportation system.  However, we decided to drive, because the location was easily accessible to and from 
I-5.  Mardi responded quickly to all our needs and even got back to us immediately when we needed something during her son's birthday party.  She kindly inquired how my son did in his competition and extended an invite to the party:) There is a complimentary parking permit and we always found a space right in front of the house.  In addition, there is a great coffee shop around the corner with a nice assortment of breakfast foods, coffee and tea.  Overall, it is a perfect family neighborhood and located only few blocks from the University.  I would highly recommend a stay with Mardi!"
3676779,25612148,2015-01-20,21181956,Maggie,Very nice and comfortable place to stay at. We took a 2 mile walk around the neighborhood love that it was close to everything. Mardi allows us to bring our German Shepard mix which made it a great experience exploring around Seattle. I love that the location is in the middle of everything. There was a little miscommunication upon arrival but the quality of her place made up for it.  
3676779,25763233,2015-01-25,2258169,Christian,"this space is as convenient as it gets for access to campus and the u district. the space is efficient, and slept 5 of us one night, creating a strong sense of 'team', as we were in town for work. while we didn't do much more than toast bagels, the kitchen is ready to stir up a feast! only downside was a rather loud and dry furnace. "
3676779,26350614,2015-02-10,22773839,Kara,Loved staying here and will definitely look this place up again next time we visit!  Visited family in Seattle with my 2 small children.  It was great to have access to a kitchen and washer/dryer.  Mardi stocked the kitchen with a few essentials to get us started.  It was so nice to be staying in a place where we could put the kids to bed and still have enough room to stay up and chat until a grown-up bedtime.  
3676779,26644422,2015-02-16,27315878,Christian,"Very nice apartment in a townhouse's basement near the University. The apartment had everything you'd need, even for a longer stay. We were even provided towels. The kitchen has everything you need to cook yourself. Mardi and her family are nice people. "
3676779,27624347,2015-03-08,791477,Jason,"I recently stayed at Mardi's place after having to make a last-minute change to my lodging plans. She was very quick to respond to my initial inquiry and reservation request. Communication throughout my stay was very seamless.

Finding the place was simple. The location is fantastic and central to most everything you could possibly want to do in Seattle and the surrounding areas. Many things are within walking distance, but be aware that getting to the University Village area requires walking down (and then back up on your return) some hillier spots. The place itself is very clean and well-kept, with all of the fundamental amenities one would need. The bed is comfortable and has what appears to be a memory foam mattress or topper.

Mardi quickly responded to my requests during my stay and was very kind to warn me about a day where the noise from the main floor above might be particularly excessive. I had plans to be away that day/evening, so it wasn’t an issue. But she offered to have her plans elsewhere in the event I was going to be in the room that day. I really appreciated her thoughtfulness and consideration in doing this.

Overall, I enjoyed my stay at Mardi's place and would recommend it to anyone wanting to be in a clean place in a central location."
3676779,28426490,2015-03-23,20675180,Andrea,"We enjoyed staying at Mardi's apartment - a lot of features in a compact space: nice kitchen, dining, lounge, and sleeping quarters.  It is in a great location - just blocks from a great park, and walking distance from shops and a Saturday market.  Interesting neighborhood too, with some very gracious houses. We loved having space to play board games.  Mardi was a very helpful host: she emailed me in advance with useful information regarding finding the place, parking, etc.; during our stay she suggested local activities; and she lent us extra chairs and adjusted the main house thermostat.  Our daughter enjoyed sleeping in a bunk, and meeting the chickens!"
3676779,28574220,2015-03-26,28925193,Constance,Nice place with everything we needed for a pleasant stay. My teenaged son was particularly happy about the xbox. I was thrilled with the parking pass.  Would stay here again
3676779,28926814,2015-04-01,16758906,Britt,"Such a cute place! Perfect location for our needs, and Mardi was so gracious. She was right on top of things when we had questions but also gave us all the space we wanted as well. Would definitely recommend!"
3676779,29358657,2015-04-06,10661803,Zoe,"We enjoyed staying at Mardi's place. The accommodation was very clean and comfortable for the two of us and our baby. The kitchen had everything we needed to cook meals including coffee, tea and the basics like salt, pepper and olive oil for cooking which we appreciated. It's a basement suite in a home in a lovely leafy residential area. Close to parks with a great café around the corner and walking distance to grocery/shops/restaurants. Mardi supplied a parking pass and street parking was not a problem. It's close to highways and about 10-15 minutes drive from downtown/tourist attractions. Thanks also for supplying a travel cot and high chair for our baby. "
3676779,29979465,2015-04-15,6639171,Elizabeth,"Overall our stay was great, exactly as advertised. Mardi was flexible with check-in times, and showed us around when we arrived. The place was easy to get to from the I-5, and a pretty short drive from the airport. We walked to Ravenna Park nearby and it was a lovely walk. The chickens were a big hit with my daughter. It is a great set-up for a family. Mardi even gave us some extra books and toys. I wouldn't recommend it for someone with mobility issues, as there are stairs, but the stairs were fine for us. "
3676779,30427044,2015-04-21,8613831,Mary Galvin,"We stayed here while our house nearby had an open house weekend, so it was extremely convenient. The apartment is roomy, tidy and very private. We could hear people moving about upstairs but never met the owners. Coffee and milk and oranges and a few other foodstuffs thoughtfully left for us. This neighborhood is great for walking buses are nearby so it's a great location."
3676779,32411349,2015-05-17,6405279,Ryan,This place was wonderful! We were relocating to Seattle and found Mardi's apartment. The place was immaculately clean with plenty of space for 2 adults and our small dog. The location is close to everything we needed. There is a great coffee shop and market just around the corner. The neighborhood is beautiful and very walkable. If you're coming to Seattle this is a gret place to stay! 
3676779,33244765,2015-05-26,29760140,Heather,"Great location that is close to the main attractions. The place was clean and Mardi provided shampoo, conditioner & body wash. The kitchen was stocked as well, with dishes and cups. She also had granola bars & tea bags. She has an Xbox with games as well. Also umbrellas & shopping totes. Wouldnt mind staying here again!"
3676779,34690739,2015-06-11,25506859,Emmanuel,"My family and I were very pleased with our two-night stay here. I think a highlight of our whole trip for our boys was petting and feeding Mardi’s three chickens, which also laid eggs for us! The residence had everything we needed, including snacks, coffee, laundry detergent, shampoo, and city maps and guides. There’s a small but nice coffee shop/grocery store around the corner with lots of organic and gluten-free products. Mardi met us when we arrived and was available throughout our stay if we had any questions or needed anything. We can highly recommend this place for a good combination of downtown and suburban living."
3676779,35061283,2015-06-15,26606761,Gretchen,This place certainly met our needs--nice place and great location for UW visits. Parking was a challenge the first night but we found good street parking close by after that. 
3676779,35551781,2015-06-20,2280277,Patricia,"We had a great stay! Mardi was extremely helpful beforehand and during our stay. Our fridge even had some food and she was very welcoming. The place is nice and cool in the summer. It's also excellent with a toddler, all essentials are there and the place is safe for curious little ones. Definitely recommend this place!!"
3676779,37642689,2015-07-09,29882112,Maria Pia,Our stay was great. The home was clean and comfortable for a family of 7. The host was easy to work with and very thoughtful. We appreciated the extra amenities and snacks that provided during our stay. I would definitely recommend others to stay there. 
3676779,38828511,2015-07-19,20736187,Stephanie (Siyi),It's the best AIRBNB experience I have ever had!!!! Love Mardi! She is the best. 
3676779,40219810,2015-07-29,18901458,Robin,"Had a real nice stay at Mardi's!  We had our own transportation and really only slept here, but everything was accurately described and it felt very convenient to all the places we visited.  The place was clean and roomy, and had everything you would need for a very nice, comfortable stay (mattresses were great too!).  Would stay again next time!  Thank you!"
3676779,41603956,2015-08-08,21300481,Deborah,Thanks for making my first Airbnb experience a great one. Unit was exactly as described and the instructions were very clear. It was comfy and clean and would love to stay there again.
3676779,42112812,2015-08-11,20486308,Holly,We had a great time in Seattle and really enjoyed ourselves staying at this fantastic apartment. It was well-situated for downtown but also for the bustling university district which gave us a real sense of life for Seattle residents. We would not hesitate to recommend this place for families. 
3676779,42829073,2015-08-16,1792150,Christopher,Great location and comfortable  Mardi very welcoming. Great restaurants close by (Liams)
3676779,43377918,2015-08-19,36753231,Simeon,"Mardi was very accommodating and she made us feel at home.
We got in very early and the place was clean and ready.

The house was walking distance from UW; bus stops were abundant.

I definitely recommend this place to anyone who has travel plans in Seattle and/or UW "
3676779,44821520,2015-08-29,33261894,Rabee,"The place is anything anyone could ask for; the pictures don't do it justice! It was spectacular to stay in. The neighbourhood is very quiet, it's less than a 15-minute drive to anywhere, including the airport. The rooms are very spacious and the kitchen had a bunch of snacks that Mardi set for us. She was always available for any questions or concerns, and provided us with two keys and a parking permit. The place was a $10 Uber ride from tourist attractions like Beacon Hill, Capitol Hill, Space Needle & the Seattle Great Wheel, as well as Pike Place & the Waterfront. I recommend this place to anyone wanting a calm, enjoyable, accessible stay in Seattle. It's perfect for couples & very family-friendly as well. Definitely staying here next time I'm in town!"
3676779,45775958,2015-09-06,34554419,Leila,Spent a comfortable week in this spacious private apartment within easy walking distance of Univ of Washington and public transport. Space was clean and well equipped. As this is a basement unit can be a little noisy from movement above. Hosts were communicative via text messages. Would stay again.
3676779,46928139,2015-09-14,40637538,Sarah,"The overall experience was great. The suite was easy to find, clean and comfortable, and close to public transportation. We arrived to town before the suite was ready, but Mardi allowed us to store our bags, which was great. She provided us with a few breakfast items which we enjoyed. The neighborhood itself was nice and quiet, however quite a bit of noise can be heard from upstairs, which was mentioned in the post. The noise was not horrible, but if you plan to sleep in, it may wake you. The suite is not within walking distance of downtown, and popular attrations, but it was very easy to access via public trasportation. The best part of our stay was when Mardi invited over for a dinner of fresh caught salmon! The meal was awesome and the crowd was inviting. "
3676779,47866747,2015-09-21,40034253,Ana Carolina,It is a great neighborhood near UW. The apartment is private and big. It is really convenient to have a laundry. I do recommend. 
3676779,48719619,2015-09-28,14123847,Katie,"Mardi's home was easy to find and in the perfect location for our stay in Seattle. The apartment was generously outfitted for everything that we might need, and there were even books and puzzles for our toddler! My only real complaint is that I did not find the home to be quite as clean as I would have liked. Mardi was very attentive and helpful via email. Good place to stay in the area."
3676779,49639337,2015-10-05,31034636,Ryan,"This is the second time someone from my family has stayed here and both times have been good experiences. Good location, nice space, clean place, and responsive host."
3676779,50438137,2015-10-12,4135052,Jess,"Mardi's airbnb was the perfect accommodation for our recent trip to Seattle.  The lodging was roomy, well-kept and comfortable.  It was great to have a kitchen and laundry facilities, if needed.  We enjoyed seeing the chickens in the backyard! The neighborhood was charming. I would definitely stay here again!"
3676779,57155456,2015-12-22,39960467,Maria,"This place was great for anyone wanting to stay in the u-dist, we traveled as a married couple visiting our son living in Seattle in the u dist, his place was approx 5 very walkable blocks away.we had 2 adult daughters arriving later in the week and left the option open for them to stay with us if they decided not to stay with their brother. Our airbnb place wound up being the gathering place for us all. We walked easily to coffee,  market, shopping center, and restaurants. Bonus was we opted not to rent a car, but our location was easy for uber and lyft drivers. Our host left some great basic food items, if needed (thank goodness) for the coffee left.I love to cook and hoped that I would've pulled off some great family meals here, but for us CA folk, not used to not being comfortable grilling (too wet). The only downside we could say is if noise (furnace) bothers you,  you either need to wear ear plugs or stay at your son/daughters place. My husband was annoyed with the furnace noise! Since the furnace was for the whole house and took up one of the walls in our place. I would not hesitate to rent this placed again, but with my husband would only rent during a no furnace season."
3382533,16361001,2014-07-26,6524006,David,"andrea was very responsive and made it super easy to book the reservation and get all of the info I needed. Very clean, comfortable  and modern space.   Bus stop was super convenient but do wish I had a car during my stay.  Explored magnolia a bit and it is beautiful.  Loved the access to the Olympic sculpture park through trail along train tracks for jogging."
3382533,17285133,2014-08-10,16919488,Michael,"Andrea was amazing! She really went the extra yard to make us feel comfortable in the apartment. We had a little hiccup with bathroom door, but she made it right with out taking time away from our trip. She truly cares about her renters experience in the apartment, and in Seattle. She was quick to give suggestions on where to visit during the process and shared about herself and family. She really made us feel welcomed and made the whole process about creating memories for my family. The location was outstanding. We didn't have the views of the city like the other apartments, but all we had to do was walk out our door and up the hill a little bit and we were able to take in the city. The bus stop was no more than 50 yards down the hill from the apartment and we were able to get to Downtown Magnolia or anywhere in Seattle with in 10-15 minutes. It was a nice change of pace to not have to drive a car and be in traffic. Being able to take the city in through public transit added to the experience. We would definitely stay again!"
3382533,17694993,2014-08-16,18051323,Michael,"This was an awesome place and location for our vacation to Seattle. My family of four was very happy with this choice. The space was bright, well appointed, clean and comfortable.  The sleeper couch in the living room was surprisingly comfortable. 

Only 10 minutes from the Space Needle and Pike Place Market in an easy drive. Very quiet neighborhood.  Andrea has stocked the place with all the necessities such as pots, plates, silver wear, laundry detergent, paper towels, so there was little besides food that we needed to buy. She was quick to respond to questions and very helpful. 

Great location for photographers wanting to catch one of the iconic postcard views of Seattle as it is close to the Ursula Judkins viewpoint and Magnolia Bridge. Magnolia Village has several nice spots to eat with grocery and drug stores, all close by. 

We'd definitely stay here again. "
3382533,17913979,2014-08-18,19965989,Ives,"Andrea was a great host. Everything went perfectly!

The home was also really nice and clean. It was quiet and in a lovely neighborhood, but close to good restaurants and coffee shops. I highly recommend it!"
3382533,18253886,2014-08-24,16809386,Anne,"Andrea gets it. She knows how to take care of her guests, she knows what a modern traveler is looking for, or at least what I was looking for--sleek modern design, home care products that are sensitive to the environment, a sparkling, spotless place in a great location. We were really happy with the location--Magnolia is quiet, clean, close to Ballard and Fremont (great restaurants). Andrea was super responsive when we had a minor issue with the laundry door, and was very welcoming without being intrusive. All in all, a great stay.  "
3382533,18507832,2014-08-27,18419501,Kyle,"This was an amazing place for our mini Seattle vacation! The location was perfect, a short drive to down town but in a quiet neighborhood. The apartment was stylish, very clean, well organized and came with all the necessities (pots, plates, silver wear, laundry detergent, paper towels, etc).
Andrea had great communication and took time to make sure if we had any needs or questions she was available. 
We couldn't be happier with our first Airbnb experience! "
3382533,18886076,2014-09-02,18124053,Simon,"Andrea was a great host, answered quickly and helped with everything we asked for. The place was very nice, clean and in a lovely neighborhood and the place had everything we needed and more. Highly recommendable!"
3382533,19246776,2014-09-08,20829467,Stephan,"We stayed at Andreas apartment for 3 nights.  The apartment is clean, bright and modern.  The layout is functional and uncluttered, with an open kitchen / living room / dining area.  There is also a stackable washer / dryer that was great for washing up our stinky clothes before departing on the rest of our journey!  The apartment does not have a balcony or views like some of the other units in the building  (there is a fire escape platform that can be accessed through the kitchen) but we did not feel this was a negative.  If you want to take in the nice Seattle views all you have to do is step out for a short walk in the neighborhood.  There are about a dozen units in the building, but the apartment felt very private.  It was always nice and bright during the day, especially in the morning as the big windows in the living space face east.  We really enjoyed taking our time making breakfast and sitting around the table planning our activities in the morning.  

We did not get a chance to meet our host Andrea as she was out of town but she responded quickly after we booked our stay with detailed instructions, and put us in touch with Greg who helps manage the property.  We did not get a chance to meet Greg either, simply because we had no issues while we were there! 

If you are looking for a party atmosphere right outside your door, you might be better off staying in a different part of town, like Capitol Hill, where the party never stops.  But if you are looking for a quiet retreat after a long day, Magnolia is a great location - close enough to the main attractions and goings-on (only about a 5-10min drive from centre of Seattle) yet far enough to rest and relax after a day or night out.  

I would recommend Andrea's apartment to Seattle visitors who are looking for a central, yet quiet location from which to explore the city and its surroundings and to those travellers who enjoy their accommodations minimalist and uncluttered.  We will certainly consider staying at Andrea's place again next time we come to Seattle. "
3382533,19400787,2014-09-11,17130619,Darlene,"Andrea was an amazing host. She responded to my urgent request very quickly and had guests coming the same day i was leaving and went out of her way to make sure she accommodated me. The place itself was spotless, HAS CABLE (awesome) and easy to get to from the main road. Both Andrea and her property manager, Greg were available any time. I would highly recommend this place. "
3382533,20046879,2014-09-22,5804411,Noel,"Andrea's apartment was a perfect home away from home in Seattle. It's in a great location, easy driving distance to our destinations. The best part of all was how clean and well taken care of it is. We didn't get to meet Andrea but she stayed in communication with us. Thanks again! "
3382533,20474245,2014-09-29,21662410,Brent,This place was great. Exactly as described and shown in the pictures. Very clean and updated. Neighborhood is great and relatively close to downtown Seattle. There was a great park just up the street from the place with amazing views. Andrea was great also. She was very responsive and even checked in with us to make sure everything was okay during our stay. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice place to stay near Seattle. 
3382533,20886907,2014-10-06,2504420,Deborah,"I had family visiting from out of town so I chose this place because it's so close to my home in Queen Anne. It was perfect! Clean, simple, modern, & convenient location. The check in & out was very easy with a key box on site. Andrea responded very quickly & was accommodating. I will be sure to use this place again when I have out of town visitors. Thank you!"
3382533,21252074,2014-10-13,22094449,Myron,"We stayed here on the long Canadian thanksgiving weekend of the 11th to the 13th in October (2 nights).

Even before we arrived, Andrea was easy to talk to and to coordinate with regarding our stay. Andrea wasn't on site for the weekend, but gave us the contact details of someone we could reach out to during our stay. On the day of our arrival, we found ourselves severely delayed, and actually got to the property well past midnight instead of our intended arrival of around 6pm. Andrea and the on-site contact she connected us with made the arrival process easy and pain-free, so we could get to sleep as soon as we arrived (boy were we tired!)

The apartment is around 10 minutes from downtown Seattle, and around 5 minutes in the opposite direction toward essential services like a Safeway, etc. A trip down the block leads to a small viewpoint with a great view of downtown and the needle!

The unit has amenities and supplies to make for an easy stay -- linens, towels and pillows were provided as well as ample thickness comforters for the Seattle nights. Access to the unit was easy; we parked on the street right on the curb and didn't have a problem with that. There were some cars throughout the night that woke up one of us, who was a light sleeper, but it wasn't nearly bad enough to detract from a good stay.

Would consider for a return visit :)"
3382533,24073345,2014-12-19,2234340,Mark,"Skip the hotel and stay here!  My wife and I rented this condo for 2 months and we could not have left happier.  The condo is fully equipped with everything you could ever possibly need, it's spotlessly clean, and in the most amazing location.  5 minutes to downtown, grocery store & coffee within walking distance.  There is a cute park right up the hill that my wife took my Son to often, he loved it!  Andrea & Greg were easily available to answer questions and/or help if we needed it, amazing hosts. One of the nights Seattle had a big wind storm and the whole block lost power and Greg even offered to bring us candles or a flash light which was so very kind.  Highly recommend this home!"
3382533,25489093,2015-01-17,1660319,Gustavo,"Excellent experience! Andrea was an amazing host and was very attentive and checked in to see if everything we needed was there. The apartment is very nicely appointed with all the comforts and amenities needed, and then some! Super comfy bed & fresh pillows, comfy sofa & chair... quiet & safe neighborhood... Just like in photos yet CLEANER and NICER! Amazing restaurants and bars close by (walking distance in the summer.. we caught a Lyft). Highly recommend a stay if you're going to be in the Seattle area!"
3382533,25828450,2015-01-26,22593445,Christina,"The listing was accurate - the place is an adorably furnished modern one-bedroom apartment an easy walking distance from Magnolia's town center and only a half block from a bus that runs straight to downtown. The place came equipped with a full set of stainless steel cookware, making it an easy place to enjoy an extended stay. Communication with Andrea was easy and quick. I would definitely recommend the place and thought it was a good deal for what you got."
3382533,26278306,2015-02-08,27049324,Greg,"Perfect is an understatement when describing this property. Amazingly quiet, very modern, and only a 15 minute bus ride into the heart of Seattle.  Andrea is a perfect host and I'll be making this my top Airbnb everytime I visit Seattle. What an amazing experience! "
3382533,26544509,2015-02-15,17760729,Alice,"This place was wonderful - clean, attractive, and the perfect location. Andrea and the gentleman who helped her were both responsive and attentive. Would definitely return there!"
3382533,30215908,2015-04-19,23547425,Gordon,"My friend and I had a wonderful stay at Andrea's place. The apartment was spacious, organized, and clean. I would definitely rebook with her again. "
3382533,30760311,2015-04-27,26710781,Deb,This apartment was great!  Very clean and in a pleasant neighborhood.
3382533,31946377,2015-05-12,4027962,Colleen,"The apartment is great.  Very clean, great location.  We booked because my family lives in Magnolia and we were able to stay very close to them, but it's a great location for exploring Seattle, with ample parking and easy access to a bus that takes 15-20 mins to get downtown.  Andrea's communication was fast, clear and all of our questions were answered promptly.  We will definitely try to book again, next time we visit family!"
3382533,32180068,2015-05-15,31094791,Kyungun,Andrea's place was wonderful. The place was spacious and the location was perfect to get to Downtown Seattle and Queen Anne areas. Recommend for anyone who plans to visit there! 
3382533,32382258,2015-05-17,27374622,Mariangela,"Andrea is a very responsive host. She replied to my questions before, during and after the trip within an hour. She also gave us recommendations on where to go during our trip. There is a very nice apartment manager on site which made us feel good in case we needed anything (which we didn't, but it was nice to know he was there). The condo is modern, nice, clean, free of clutter, and in a very nice neighborhood. The kitchen is complete with utensils, pots/pans, french press, dishwasher, full size fridge - all the basics. Parking is free and easy (we parked right in front of the condo); and the tourist attractions were just about a 15 minutes drive, so we were far enough from all the downtown noise but close enough to drive or uber. Another nice thing is that there was organic/planet friendly detergents and soap. One last plus is the fact that there is a washer and dryer in the unit! Me and my other 2 friends highly recommend Andrea's place - I will definitely stay here whenever I make my way back to Seattle."
3382533,32761500,2015-05-21,14065010,Debi,"Our host did a fantastic job of communicating with us, regarding check in and our accomodations.  The apartment was absolutely fantastic, super clean, well stocked, and in a nice location, safe, with lots of off street parking.  

Lots of fluffy towels, the bed was comfy, and all of the kitchen tools one could possibly want to make a nice meal.  And, the host provided coffee for our stay, a nice touch.  Fast internet.  The entire apartment was very comfortable, felt like home.

I really enjoyed my stay, and plan to stay again on my next trip to Seattle."
3382533,33108294,2015-05-25,30600798,Sarah,The place is absolutely wonderful! A fantastic location and beautiful apartment. Very modern and clean. Andrea was extremely helpful with her recommendations and property information. I highly recommend staying here! 
3382533,33484449,2015-05-28,33314766,Joshua,"This was a wonderful experience for us.  The unit was very attractive and having an onsite manager meant that someone was available if we had questions or needed anything.  Andrea was very prompt in getting back with us and provided us with a great deal of information to make check in and check out very easy.  She is very professional and it was clear that everything about the process was well thought out.  Also it was very, very clean unit.

The unit was well furnished.  We had all the necessary items to prepare meals and do laundry while we were there.   In addition to pots and pans, there was dishwashing detergent and a cleaning sponge under the sink.  I would expect that it would be these little things that would be hard to remember but all of that was available for us.  A french press was provided which was new to us but a quick Youtube video later and we had excellent Seattle's Best coffee.  The couch converted to a bed so there was plenty of room for a family of 4 to stay there. Lastly, the internet was very fast (50 mbps) which was helpful for us as we streamed videos, etc.

The location was very close to a bus stop.  On google maps it is a 6 minute walk but it is really 1-2 minutes away.  The bus takes about 10-15 minutes to get to downtown (Seattle aquarium, pike place) Parking was very easy and it was a short distance from the curb to the front door of the unit.  Whole foods is nice and relatively close.  There is also an Albertson's really close for those who are trying to save some money.
"
3382533,33828101,2015-06-01,4757025,Kelli,"We loved this apartment, looked like it was out of an ikea catalogue. Lots of great light, full kitchen amenities, and super clean. We loved the neighborhood as well, wish we had more time to explore, but there was easy access to shops, great parks and a spectacular city view. Also very convenient to walk from apartment and take the bus into the city, which was a must for us. Overall, excellent experience."
3382533,34013199,2015-06-03,18245597,Christian,"Our stay was great! Although we did not get to meet Andrea in person, she was very friendly and did a great job of reaching out to make sure my family and I were fully accommodated. The unit was clean and comfy - exactly like the images from the listing and situated in a cute and quiet neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again!"
3382533,34337167,2015-06-07,18426653,Rick,"The place was nice, clean and conveniently located. The host was very attentive and helpful. Thanks I really enjoyed my stay and will be back again!"
3382533,35289074,2015-06-17,27128753,Amy,"Andrea and Greg were awesome! They checked in on us from time to time to make sure we were okay, but stayed ""invisible"" during our vacation unless we needed them"
3382533,35494912,2015-06-19,31735516,Jayna,"We received thorough instructions and great neighborhood and city information from Andrea. It was easy to find and access the apartment. Andrea set the home up like a hotel and everything we needed was there. It was clean and comfortable and we felt right at home. When we accidentally locked the key inside, the property manager helped us out quickly. We would definitely stay here again. "
3382533,35826678,2015-06-22,34199307,Cynthia,"The owner, Andrea Ravenet, was exceptional in providing all of the details of the property and the surrounding area in Seattle.   She also provided information relevant to shopping, activities, etc.  Beyond first class service in making one feel comfortable and at home!   "
3382533,36146369,2015-06-25,424944,Alice,Andreas place is lovely. Very clean and comfortable and just what you need for a stay in Seattle. With a car should be no problem getting around. Check out discovery bay nearby for a hike or stroll.
3382533,36431277,2015-06-28,287095,Mike,"Andrea was the perfect host and Modern Drama was exactly as advertised. Conveniently located and tastefully furnished, it was the perfect location for our trip to Seattle!"

3382533,37035913,2015-07-04,24695096,Regina,"Andrea's place in Magnolia was just perfect, and she was a very accommodating and considerate host. The apartment was spacious enough for our family of four. It was very clean, and furnishings were simple and tasteful. Kitchen was stocked w Seattle's Best coffee, French press,  water filter pitcher, mugs, wine glasses, plates, salad bowls and basic cookware and tools. Body soap, detergent, dish soap, and cleaning products were available and all Eco-friendly products. Street parking was easy, and the location was so convenient for getting around everywhere. Andrea checked in couple of times via email to make sure we were finding everything we needed. Greg the manager was very nice and was available if needed. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends and family. "
3382533,40564704,2015-08-01,5775988,Gunther,"We booked apartment for a whole month for a family of four. Everything was arranged and worked perfectly, and all questions we had got an answer right away. The apartment had all the space, appliances etc we needed. Magnolia is a fairly residential area, but with buses to downtown and the university district right in front of the door, and a playground and public pool nearby, the location turned out to be perfect. The kids loved it, and I hope we can come back again."
3382533,41731375,2015-08-09,30269884,Eric,"We had a great time at the airbnb. Check-in was convenient and the room was clean and organized. Andrea and Greg allowed us to leave our luggage past check out due to a late flight, which was very cool of them! "
3382533,42884649,2015-08-16,4115028,Maxim,Apartment was nice and clean. Plenty of parking in front of the building. Great neighborhood. Helpful and quick responding host. Thank you very much!
3382533,43567417,2015-08-20,18294662,Theresa,"Andrea is first class.  She completely took care of everything so our stay was easy and accommodating.  Would definitely stay here again.  The apt is beautiful, clean, comfortable and well designed.  It's close to everything.  "
3382533,44781832,2015-08-29,4706359,Johnnie,"My brother, his wife and I stayed at Andrea's place in beautiful Magnolia for 3 nights in August 2015. We had the best time, it was the perfect location for exploring Seattle. Magnolia is a beautiful and quiet neighbourhood very close to DT Seattle and everything it has to offer. We had our car, there was lots of safe street parking and you can drive to DT Seattle within 10-15 minutes. Beautiful views of Seattle's skyline from several vantage points. There is a Whole Foods 5 minutes drive away! We tried one of Andrea's restaurant recommendations one evening - Pallisade at Elliott Bay Marina, it was the best sushi I had in a long time. The apartment itself was exactly as described on airbnb - new, clean, very nice towels, linens (we took the pillows) and a well equipped kitchen. And the most comfortable sofa bed I ever slept on. Thank you, Andrea, we had a great time and will definitely be staying here again the next time we are in Seattle. "
3382533,45406052,2015-09-02,950875,Darren,"Wonderful unit, wonderful host. The unit was more spacious than it initially seemed though pictures. The modern amenities and clean layout made for a comfortable stay. Andrea was extremely accommodating during the reservation process and very easy to talk to."
3382533,47756090,2015-09-21,38465577,Kristoper,"Andrea says that she rolls out the red carpet for you and she is 100% correct. Everything was perfect, clean beautiful condo in a beautiful quiet neighborhood close to everything. Andrea and Greg were available for any needs while also being very unobtrusive. I would stay at her wonderful place again should I find myself back in Seattle. "
3382533,49810701,2015-10-06,7335552,Mary,"This was my first experience with AirBnB, and I was thoroughly impressed with the apartment as well as our thoughtful hostess, Andrea. The apartment is exactly as it appears in pictures and we'll-appointed with everything you will need for a comfortable stay. Magnolia is a beautiful neighborhood with the best views of the city and Puget sound. It's very close to downtown and all the attractions. Plenty of street parking right in front of the building -so not paying for parking was nice, as it can run an additional $15-25 per night in some local hotels. I've stayed in several places in Seattle and this is by far, the nicest as well as the best value. The apartment was clean and quiet, and the new pillows were a nice touch. Andrea was a very professional, attentive host and check-in/check-out was simple. I hope it's available the next time I'm in town. Thanks again for everything Andrea!"
3382533,50032006,2015-10-08,393326,Fordon,Super great little place. Simple but spotless and incredible location. 
3382533,50223487,2015-10-10,41865456,Andre,"Great place. Clean and cozy. 
Enjoyed the location and parking on site. "
3382533,50584066,2015-10-12,14377620,Zillah,Great experience. Would recommend for anyone who is looking for a place to stay in seattle.
3382533,55298919,2015-11-29,2035860,Richard,"This Magnolia apartment is exactly as described, well appointed, well located and extremely clean and tidy. Andrea was in regular contact and a pleasure to 'deal' with - always helpful and interested. We stayed with our 2 young girls (aged 7 and 9) and there was plenty of room and no complaints. We are likely to use this again when we return with our girls."
3382533,57543311,2015-12-27,48846960,Diane,This was a good location for us and the apartment was clean and very streamlined.  It was quiet and the view of the skyline at night was lovely.  Unfortunately a medical emergency made it necessary that we leave early so we couldn't take full advantage of our stay.  We didn't get a chance to meet Andrea but she was in contact with us and was attentive.  We'd go back!
3382533,58378561,2016-01-02,16381279,Laura,My husband and I had a very nice time. We were very comfortable and had everything we needed. Andrea communicated with us throughout the trip to ensure it was a smooth stay. 
6389657,39314524,2015-07-22,1852794,Anna,"I had a long layover in Seattle and needed something that was convenient and let me walk around a little after a long flight. This cute and cozy place is five min taxi ride to downtown and nestled in a lovely neighborhood, surrounded by cafes and restaurants. Ruth also warmly welcomed me and gave me a quick overview of the apartment and area. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend to anyone who needs a convenient and stylish nest in Seattle!"
6389657,39537182,2015-07-24,37621783,Nick,"Ruth was a great host. Before we arrived she had set up a key drop off, explained some of the things around her studio and even left us a map for Seattle since it was my first time. She gave a few reccomondations for local business that were spot on. Just downstairs of her studio the Queen Anne olive oil company infuses flavors into olive oil and is amazing , I might stay here again just to go to that store since they don't ship online :(. Down the steel about 1 block is Le Reve a delicious bakery that is def a must. Ruths studio provided us with everything we needed. A fridge, comfy bed, nice patio, clean home, tv, WiFi and it was all great. THANKS RUTH!!!"
6389657,39704337,2015-07-25,452564,Molly,"Even though we never met her in person, Ruth was a great hostess. Our flight into Seattle was delayed and we had some last minute schedule changes but she was super accommodating and quick to respond to any questions I had via email. Her space is small but SO CUTE. And I could've browsed her bookshelves for hours :) Very close to everything on Queen Anne - we just walked a few minutes out the door for some great breakfast and coffee. All in all, a lovely  experience. I highly recommend staying at Ruth's!"
6389657,39861603,2015-07-26,38927493,Staci,"We loved spending time at this cute studio, with a fantastic location!  We enjoyed the balcony, expresso maker, the local shops and restaurants.  A great value for the price!"
6389657,40044585,2015-07-27,39131440,Kelsey,"Ruth was very friendly and her place was great ! Very clean, has everything you need , and it was in a great location!"
6389657,40129721,2015-07-28,7750591,Heather,"Ruth was really easy to get a hold of, gave great directions and was very flexible with me. The place was very clean and comfortable and the bed was shockingly comfy! Great little place, I definitely recommend staying here."
6389657,40633216,2015-08-01,13032636,Ian,This was a perfect location to stay. Great area and beautiful studio apartment. Had everything we needed. Made our stay so much fun and comfortable. Ruth is a really great host. The place is very clean. I would love to stay here again when I come back to seattle.
6389657,40786592,2015-08-02,35804373,Alexander,Great place to stay if you are in Seattle! So close to downtown and the market!
6389657,40959330,2015-08-03,37742578,Sandy,"My daughter and I were in town for the weekend to find her a place to live ... Ruth was SUPER helpful with info about Seattle.  The location was PERFECT for our searching too.

I admit to being picky and critical - especially about lodging.  The bed was amazingly comfortable (and short of the Four Seasons I don't say that often).  All the amenities were there and worked - from an expresso machine to chilled  filtered water in the fridge.  

Everything was clean, Ruth worked with us on check-in and checkout time; wifi and cable was all there and working ... and the kitchen had everything we needed.

Comfortable, great host and good location:  I would definitely recommend!"
6389657,42469989,2015-08-13,28012948,Lucien,"This is a very pleasant, comfortable studio apartment in a charming neighborhood of Seattle. Well equipped, but with plenty of space for my stuff. Very accessible to everything via bus and Uber. There wasn't much night noise during the days I was there. The host was very responsive, loaned me an iron when I needed one, and never intrusive."
6389657,43424059,2015-08-19,20282161,Jennifer,"Ruth's studio was great.  We enjoyed staying in Queen Anne, the studio was located in a central area and access to downtown is about a twenty minute bus ride.  Communication with Ruth and her Aunt Cat was immediate and responsive and very pleasant to deal with.  There was a minor incident with not being able to receive WiFi but we were compensated for it.

Thank you for allowing us to stay in your home.  Everything was great.  "
7492877,40048773,2015-07-27,36819781,Tom,"Awesome location! Peaceful, close to restaurants and pubs!!"
7492877,41040606,2015-08-03,12245262,Jordan,"Great place. Felt bigger than it is, easy to get to and close to everything. Meg was easy to get a hold of if I had questions."
7492877,42022533,2015-08-10,6031509,Alex,"Meg was the best.  Super kind and very accommodating.  Even after we had checked out, she let us come back in and shower and change for a wedding we had to go to.  House is very cute and warm.  Cute residential neighborhood with good street parking."
7492877,43129733,2015-08-17,13959789,Allison,"Meg was very communicative prior to the stay, which is always appreciated.
The location was great. Easy parking, easy walking, and close to public transit.
We had 4 adults & it was still very comfortable.
Loved sitting in the backyard at the table for dinner!
I would definitely recommend staying at this AirBNB."
7492877,44209557,2015-08-24,20727245,Cheryl,"Meg's house was exactly as described. It was perfect for our family of toddler and infant to be staying at. Our daughter had plenty of toys and books to play with. The house was very kid friendly. The chickens were very quiet, we forget that they're there!"
7492877,46910417,2015-09-14,36242320,Erica,The house was perfect. Our family of four had a great time there. The kids enjoyed the toys and books. The chickens were so cute we were all completely enamored. Everything was exactly as described. 
7492877,50338113,2015-10-11,2989304,Jeff,"We didn't get to meet Meg in person, but the house is very welcoming – especially for a young family like us. Getting in the house and getting set up was easy enough. Our daughter enjoyed the toys, the chickens, and the room to run around in the backyard! It's in a great location, just across the bridge from tons of places in Fremont, and not far from everything in Queen Anne or downtown, just as mentioned. The place is a great cozy retreat in a pretty busy city."
2800448,38552759,2015-07-16,30238655,Michael,Yana was awesome! The room and neighborhood were great as well! It's a short commute into town. Will be back again!
2800448,38657923,2015-07-17,2449254,Steve,"Yana was super friendly and made it very easy to rent her room. The room was perfect, clean, and easy to get to from the airport (about 15 minutes). Yana thought of everything from a little fridge stocked with water to plenty of clean towels and a comfy bed. I would defintely stay again."
2800448,38775680,2015-07-18,36959530,Bobbi,"This was my first time using airbnb and I could not be happier! It was such a great experience overall and we had such lovely hosts. Yana and her husband both made us feel very welcome. We were able to chat to them both a little and they are extremely friendly, making it easier for us to feel comfortable. The space provided was exactly what my boyfriend and I wanted while in Seattle, and the location was a dream. We are walkers, so we enjoyed the 20-25 min walk to pike place market, however you are able to catch the bus just as easily close to the home. 
Our room/bathroom were super clean and they had even laid out information and maps of Seattle, along with a couple snacks and bottles of water in the fridge.  We were out exploring the city for the most part, but while in the room out privacy was respected. "
2800448,39102787,2015-07-20,26825608,Kasey,"Our stay at Yana's was great! My fiance and I wanted a place centrally located so we were close to everything. She was very helpful throughout our trip and before. We were adequately informed where to park and she let us know about some construction being done, so we wouldn't be surprised by anything. The room was comfortable, clean, and had everything we needed. "
2800448,39823777,2015-07-26,37863560,Kim,Yana is very friendly and service minded. The Place is in very good condition and clean. Location is good With several Public transportations available. Uber taxis are always nearby. Would most def. come back.
2800448,40543987,2015-07-31,39841348,Simon,"The room was perfect. Exactly what we wanted. Private, clean and close to downtown. Yana was very nice and accommodating and after we decided we'd like to stay in town for an extra night we contacted her to see if there was any chance we could stay. She mentioned her previous reservations fell through and was happy to put us up for another night. Communication was awesome too. She'd respond to any questions within half an hour at the most. Would love to stay again and would recommend this room to all my family and friends when visiting beautiful Seattle."
2800448,41051501,2015-08-03,38283376,Nuoya,The place is as awesome as shown in the pictures. Very quite neighborhood with convenient public transportation to downtown(line 4&3 in the north and line 14 in the south that you to major tour spots in Seattle).  Would be great if travel with car. The place is well furnished and Yana kindly provided snacks and drinks for guest. And the bed is very comfortable.
2800448,41898607,2015-08-09,20259122,Viktor,"Yana's room was exactly as described. It's an ideal place for a night in Seattle. With its own entrance and ensuite bathroom, it's very private. In fact, we didn't get to meet Yana at all during our stay. She provided us with an access code and very clear instructions. This worked fine for us. The place was small but very clean and there were even some snacks and drinks stocked upon our arrival. The apartment is located in an area close to downtown which has a mixed feel to it (some nice but also some more sketchy looking buildings in the surrounding blocks). There is no immediate parking on the property itself so we had to park in another street. Overall we liked our stay and it was well organized by Yana."
2800448,42089675,2015-08-10,25012862,Manumalo,"Great customer service! Yana responded to my inquiries quite timely. Very accommodating with my check-in time and happened to meet her on her way out of her drive way ready to go to the beach with friends, she happened to recognize me and right away had the car stopped, got out and proceeded to guide me to their home and room and gave me pertinent information about the room. The room itself and private bathroom was just as advertised and perfect for my short trip to Seattle. It was clean and conveniently located at the bottom of the townhome but not a basement room so not dark or has a low ceiling so no hassle or worry about disturbing anyone or bumping your head getting around and is perfect for privacy. There was a couple of granola bars offered, a nice convenient small refrigerator that had some cans of soda,  a microwave and a folder containing information about parking in the area and transportation services. The location was perfect and close to everything."
2800448,42227164,2015-08-11,5235166,Michelle,The room was exactly what one needed for a comfortable and clean stay.  I enjoyed having our own access to the place to avoid disrupting anyone. A great location to access the city-centre easily on transit.
2800448,42347389,2015-08-12,21796707,Lars,"Yana's place is just perfect. It has a private entrance with own bathroom, which give you a lot of privacy. The room was clean and quit. The location was also perfect. Yana was a really nice and carrying person. She gave us tips about the neighborhood and downtown. The room is Very close to downtown. I really recommend this place and Yana as host. "
2800448,42501242,2015-08-13,21796707,Lars,"The place was so perfect, that we booked another night! "
2800448,43513199,2015-08-20,37998452,Fred,"I saw the host for 3 minutes on arrival and never again.  I had to use the same hand towel and bath towel the entire 7 nights of my stay.  There were no drinking cups.  Bed linens never changed.  My drinking cup for taking medications was an empty plastic 14 oz. milk bottle I used the entire week.  I received a text my 4th day, where I asked for drinking cups.  Never happened.
Room was nice and clean.  Service was absent."
2800448,44312505,2015-08-25,17202328,Kk,"My stay w Yana was great! The room was just as described. The pamphlets she left and the bus app she suggested were both very helpful. She responds in a timely manner. There was construction on the road in front of the home. It's no big deal if you're catching a bus, but something to note if you may be coming from the airport in an uber. You can walk a few blocks in either direction from the home to catch a bus - that's very convenient. It can be a little noisy when the family are all gathered in the kitchen/living area having breakfast. Otherwise, no complaints. Would definitely plan to stay here if I was ever in the Seattle area again!"
2800448,44548977,2015-08-27,23618532,Sunshine,My Mother was very hesitant try out AIRB&B on our trip. But she changed her mind after our stay at Yana's place. It was very clean and sweet. Very easy to get to.
2800448,44923799,2015-08-30,3344475,Annelies,"We really liked our stay at Yana's. The room is very nice, clean, private and has a comfortable bed. Private bathroom was really nice. Easy access to downtown Seattle by bus. We didn't meet Yana but her husband gave us all the info we needed and some great local tips."
4737727,41698797,2015-08-08,40156108,Ahyoung,"Jessica and her housemates were really favorable and friendly. I was a little worried because the location of her house looked somehow far from downtown when I checked google map. But it wasn't difficult to find the location, and I was able to take buses nearby home which was convenient. Also, the room I stayed was exactly same to this picture. Everything I needed as a tourist was furnished, and they were clean and neat.  I really liked it. "
4737727,42070092,2015-08-10,40242164,Wan-Yi,"We had a great time staying at Jessica's place. Although we didn't get to meet her in person, we were able to reach her when we needed anything. She was very nice and accommodating, so were her housemates. It was a pleasant stay."
4737727,43554330,2015-08-20,27626058,Chris,"Jessica was very accommodating in check in and check out times. She was extremely friendly for the duration of my stay. Her room was well maintained, clean, and inviting. Her roommate were as friendly and understanding as well. The pistachio colored walls were soothing and overall her room is cute! I would not hesitate to stay at this place again!"
4085439,19981017,2014-09-21,17042904,Carmaleta,"Our hosts Debra and Jordan made us feel very welcome.  We had a late arrival.  The lights were on and a note was left with contact information in case we had any trouble with the lock to enter.  The room was charming with loads of history attached.  The room preserved the feeling of history fused with modern comfort and convenience.  There is a separate entrance and the room has a private bath.  The hosts left no stone unturned.  There were mints on the nightstand upon arrival and the room had a television, coffee maker, snacks and all the touches of home with a restaurant guide.  The wifi included was easy to log into with no glitches.  Thank you to the hosts for such a wonderful stay in a beautiful neighborhood with great coffee and world class pastries just down the street.  I would highly recommend staying here!  The hosts are gracious and the room is beyond charming.  "
4085439,20391605,2014-09-28,21656125,Vinay,"Staying at this Historic Ballard House was my first Airbnb experience, and it surpassed even my highest expectations.  Debra was so kind and such a wonderful host, and it made my trip even better.  She was so accommodating and helpful, taking the time to explain to me how Airbnb works, as well as giving me tips on where to venture in the neighborhood.  The private room is everything you need for a stay in Ballard.  It is clean, comfortable and charming, and it is in a great location to explore Ballard, which is a beautiful neighborhood with lots to offer.  Both the home and location are as wonderful as the host, and I would recommend staying here to anyone!"
4085439,21189896,2014-10-12,9913630,Kosta,"Debra's place is great! It's a fantastic private room with a huge private bathroom in a beautiful old home within walking distance of tons of shops, excellent restaurants AND one of the best record stores in the country (Bop Street Records.) I had a wonderful stay here. The in-room coffee, wi-fi and cable TV were delicious icing on an already tasty cake.

4085439,33499902,2015-05-29,29094578,James,The host met us at the door. He was quite friendly
4464542,47949879,2015-09-21,9739944,Anil,Quaint apartment with a great view. A few house keeping issues... But overall a good alternative for the value. Marion was very hospitable and accommodating. Thanks Marion! 
4464542,48144565,2015-09-23,44506566,Alexey,The experience was exactly as described. It was nice having an apartment to ourselves and look at the beautiful view of lake Washington. 
4464542,48255504,2015-09-24,3096608,Ashley,"The apartment was great - the view was just as described, and the neighborhood was fantastic! Just the right amount of peaceful, tree-lined streets and busy cafes and shops. I had a great time! "
5019444,26083199,2015-02-02,19192965,Brent,"Great place to stay! Within walking distance to lots of great attractions, restaurants, and bars. Easy to find and plenty of parking around the apartment.  Communication with the host was excellent. "
5019444,26271501,2015-02-08,22764167,Colleen,Sam was easy going and accommodating. His comfy little apartment was so close to all the fun of Seattle. I'd rent from him again in a heartbeat.
5019444,26610900,2015-02-16,26223893,Melissa,"Sam was a very reliable host. We did not get to meet him but everything was as he described :) He also left us a little handout with things to do. I'd recommend based on location as well. His place is walking distance to everything tourist. The building was a little noisy, but we are pretty sensitive to noise. Overall I would recommend for someone looking for a decent place to sleep :) "
5019444,27013420,2015-02-23,5497302,Katherine,"Sam's studio was perfect for our recent trip to Seattle. It was clean, cozy, and he'd left a wonderful guide to the neighborhood for us. We loved the central location and great neighborhood. Check-in was easy, and Sam was very helpful! All in all, we would highly recommend Sam's Belltown studio for a Seattle trip!"
5019444,27658569,2015-03-09,20698790,Adriana,"Our stay was very comfortable. We never got to meet Sam but he left very clear instructions for us and was nice enough to leave a 2 page printout of suggestions of everything we could do in town and where to eat/drink, etc. The studio is centrally located. We had no need to rent a car, we were able to walk everywhere. "
5019444,28313856,2015-03-22,24760878,Debbie,Sam's place was perfect in every aspect. The location was fabulous! He was excellent in communicating and very helpful. We would certainly stay again. 
5019444,28801382,2015-03-30,28135881,Patricia,The host provided great recommendations for restaurants and bars.  Would stay at this place again next time I'm in Seattle!
5019444,29339484,2015-04-06,20983924,David,"Very close to everything and very comfortable. We had a time here. Sam is very nice and easy to communicate with. The apartment is well represented by the pictures, and we would recommend this listing highly! "
5019444,29821852,2015-04-13,2309881,Alannah And John,"Sam was an excellent communicator, and his instructions were easy to follow. His written information about the apartment, the area, and places to eat and drink were really entertaining, helpful and informative. The apartment was as described and the building was very quiet. The bed was very comfortable which was a relief after a long day of walking up and down the streets of Seattle. Location was excellent, lots of restaurants and bars close by, and a pleasant walk to downtown."
5019444,30306192,2015-04-20,29107262,Allie,"My fiancé and I had a wonderful time. The amenities were great, we loved the neighborhood, and we appreciated the list set out for us of helpful hints and tips. The room was warm but with plenty of windows so we could manage temperature easily. The bed was so comfortable! In a perfect walking distance location to everything. We really enjoyed having a tv with Netflix and blue ray too, made the place cozy. Other than cozy, the design and decor was awesome, we were fascinated and intrigued by the posters and wall hangings. Overall, I am so thankful I chose this over a hotel. I felt I really received the Seattle experience I was looking for. I would highly recommend this studio! "
5019444,32467113,2015-05-18,1757757,Sandra,"Overall was very nice and good.
The studio is very convenient, just in the middle of everything.
Sam was very attentive and left us some very good tips of the city, such restaurants and places to see in."
5019444,33080551,2015-05-25,28650149,Jeremy,"This was my first Airbnb stay. Sam was a great host. Though we never met, he had great communication via messaging. He left a sheet of instructions as well as some ideas of things to do in the room. The bed was comfortable as well I usually wake with a sore back sleeping in a strange bed, but didn't have that problem here. This area was pretty close to all the touristy Seattle things like Pike Place and the Space Needle. Parking is street only and at a cost, I wouldn't recommend a car unless you absolutely needed it."
5019444,34404613,2015-06-08,19292504,Cris,"Very nice place, near of everything, clean, and the comunication with Sam was excelent!! "

5019444,35822736,2015-06-22,15316420,Logan,"Sam's communication and instructions were fantastic and timely. The apartment was nice and clean, with an awesome location in Belltown. Sam also provided us with a list of local restaurants and bars to visit which worked out great. It should be noted that if you pack light enough, it's really easy to get to this apartment from SeaTac by taking the light rail to Westlake station, then walking about ~10 minutes to the apartment -- super convenient and cheap!"
5019444,37131293,2015-07-05,26359670,Theresa,"Sam is very responsive to questions. Cute studio in great location with surprisingly easy parking in neighborhood. We were surprised that the ""bed"" was a mattress and boxspring on the floor, but it was actually quite comfortable. Though we didn't use them, he provided many entertainment options (wi-fi, tv, movies). I would stay here again."
5019444,38103190,2015-07-13,29592653,Rachelle,"Such a wonderful place to call our home base for our trip to Seattle.  For first time visitors to Seattle, we found the Belltown location a perfect jumping off points to all the local attractions. Walking distance to Pike Place Market, a longer, but doable, walk to the Space Needle/EMP museum/Glass Sculpture gardens & monorail. There are tons of great restaurants and watering holes all within walking distance as well. Sam was nothing but welcoming and communicative for the entire process. Getting in was a breeze and he left an incredibly thorough list of info for the area that we made our official guide to the city. 

The Westlake Link (light rail) station is also within a 10 minute walk from the place as well.  Easy trip to/from the airport and only $3! Use public transportation whenever possible, we found it incredibly affordable, easy to use and got everywhere on either Link or the bus. 

So glad we chose Sam's studio and we would love to stay again when we come on a return trip to Seatlle.  "

The apartment was centrally located and within walking distance of almost everywhere we went. I would not hesitate to stay here again."
5019444,42120093,2015-08-11,26395897,Jessica,Sam's place is really nice and near to everything in downtown. My brother and I had a blast in Seattle. Thanks so much Sam!
5019444,45936288,2015-09-07,29765520,Yuen,Sam was great and communicating with us from the beginning to the end. We never got to meet in person but the instructions was very clear and easy to follow. The location was convenient and parking was always available in front of the building. The apartment was clean. We would stay here again. 
5019444,46864318,2015-09-14,31806489,Katie,"easy to communicate with, great location. would stay there again! left an air mattress out for us too. "
5019444,47771570,2015-09-21,22903483,A.J.,"My girlfriend and I were looking for a place to stay for our anniversary weekend. Didn't need much space; just a place to be able to unwind after a night out. We didn't want to spend too much and we were hoping to find a place in the middle of everything. 

Sam's studio was all that and more! I seriously cannot recommend this place enough. It is clean and the location is wonderful. You can walk to Pike Place in less than ten minutes. It's just a few minute drive from the studio to either Capitol Hill or Queen Anne. So much to do and it's all super close.

Sam was also extremely accommodating and communicative. I didn't have any issues but I'm sure that he would have been able to help quickly if I did. 

If you're looking for a place for two to stay in Seattle and Sam's place is available then you need to book it. You will not be disappointed!"
5019444,48695832,2015-09-28,32020055,Tori,"Sam was a great host, and left easy to follow instructions! The location was perfect for getting around the city by Uber or walking. Was such a smooth easy process! Thanks for a great place to stay Sam! "
5019444,49631768,2015-10-05,28122146,Barend,"We had a fantastic stay in Sam's apartment. The apartment is clean and very homey. The apartment is located in Belltown, within walking distance of many of the attractions and bars/restaurants. Check-in/check-out was seamless. He left a thorough list of places to visit in the area which was helpful and could be used as a guide. Communication was easy and he was very accommodating. Thanks for a great stay. "
5019444,50446757,2015-10-12,21803246,Alaina,Great location and Sam was very helpful with suggestions for interesting things to do and useful information about Seattle.
5019444,52042873,2015-10-26,35044084,EmilySue,"Sam made it very convenient for us to check in and out since he wasn't strict on time. So we didn't feel rushed to leave. He provided us with helpful info for the apartment and about the city. The place was quiet and accessible to the city...minutes from the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. 

2 things that may improve if possible: 1) the heater didn't seem to work. 2) the place had a distinct smell. Lol. "
5019444,52910939,2015-11-02,21270598,Lydia,"Great location, good communication, easy to access"
5019444,54088608,2015-11-16,5245420,Jessica,"This was a great apartment, we really enjoyed our stay. The location was ideal and Sam left some helpful info on local eateries and bars. I would stay here again!"
5019444,55404562,2015-12-01,11209192,Laura,Sam got in touch before we were suppose to arrive and explained the process and location if his apartment. He made us feel very welcomed. 
5019444,55969281,2015-12-07,19318980,Joanie,"Sam's location was very convenient and just a short 10-15 min walk away from Pike's Market place. The listing was as described and he even left some recommendations about where to eat and what to do around Seattle. While we never saw Sam while we were here, he left very detailed instructions on where to get to his location. He was also very considerate in messaging through email when his phone had no reception to make sure we got in okay. 

The only downside I would say about the stay was that this building is a bit older compared to those on the block. The heater would be making clanging sounds throughout the night and I would imagine it would disrupt sleep for light-sleepers. Thankfully we were both heavy sleepers and it was not a problem for us!"
5019444,57864716,2015-12-30,6046226,Irene,"Sam's apartment is perfectly located for access to everything in Seattle. We really enjoyed being able to walk to the Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and downtown. As other reviewers (and Sam) have mentioned, the heat is a bit of an issue, both for comfort and for sleep. Aside from that, though, our trip was great. Thank you, Sam!"

She was incredibly welcoming and accommodating and full of good advice for activities and places to explore. I highly recommend staying with Wendy. She truly did everything possible to help make my trip easy, convenient and fun. "
3052151,14991818,2014-06-30,9122703,Caroline,"Staying with Wendy Morrison was a very pleasant experience. She was very accommodating and went out of her way to give us advice for our stay in Seattle. The room was on the small side but more than enough. Cute kitchen, even though we didn't have time to use it. The apartment was under renovation but Wendy was kind enough to subsidize our bill in compensation. Great location and great stay!"
3052151,16120504,2014-07-22,7243323,Leonie,Everything was as expected. The location of the house is very good to get fast to the city centre.

3052151,16921006,2014-08-04,3731243,Michelle,Place was very nice & cute and in an amazing location. Slate coffee a real bonus! Wendy was pleasant and communicative although we only saw her briefly a few times.

3052151,17709434,2014-08-16,17529451,Hannah,"Cute neighborhood. Accurate photos and description of the apartment. Wendy was welcoming and friendly, but did her own thing which was exactly what I was looking for."
3052151,26319151,2015-02-09,17249627,Jared,"We never met Wendy, as she was out of town for our stay. The neighborhood was nice and within walking distance of Ballard. The only downside was that we were asked to bring our own towels which was fairly inconvenient. "
3052151,32031461,2015-05-12,28139274,Kristina,Great location and walking distance to many local bars and good food! 
3052151,32643155,2015-05-19,33247177,Kathryn,Great host! Wendy was super sweet and not imposing whatsoever.  Neighborhood was super central and the deck was so great!  My bf and I were very comfortable.  Thanks Wendy!

8976178,54275702,2015-11-17,5687031,Maricel,"Kalani was helpful and responsive when booking and checking in/out.  I personally loved the minimalism and simplistic lifestyle of the tiny house. The experience of staying at a tiny house will be positive if guests know how to live simply! 

The space was detailed in industrial/rustic/chic decor. We had eggs and basic ingredients to make breakfast! I love how the tiny house was set up, very green, compact, and had basically all the essentials. 

Things to note: 
-be mindful of how much or how large your baggage(s) may be. We forgot how big my suitcase was-_-
-I would not recommend someone to stay if they have difficulty using a ladder to go up to and down from the bedroom

Overall, we are thankful that Kalani provided a house manual via electronic and also the house manual/guestbook with ha drawn photos and instructions, super helpful. We loved the TV set up, since we live Netflix-ing it was perfect! 

Location: 
We drove so we were only 10-20 minutes away from all the attractions we wanted to go to, stores were close by if you need anything as well

Would stay here again."
8976178,54469482,2015-11-20,48686163,Sam,Great experience. Just went as a landing spot for the evening. Relaxing and fun in a great locations just out of the city. Can't wait to go back for a full night stay. 
8976178,54541785,2015-11-21,30939839,Kerstin,"What a nice tiny house on wheels☺ that was a really comfy stay, easy to find and felt like home right away.  Good to see a working compost toilette, very good house layout and a awesome skylight. The sheets were awesome, like home. I didn't try the TV though..and the fridge! That's some breakfast"
8976178,54890782,2015-11-25,46067616,Samantha,The tiny house was cozy and adorable! It was beautifully decorated and furnished. We loved how spacious the loft bed was! The compost toilet was not scary at all and very easy to use. We loved staying here and experiencing tiny house living! We hope to come again very soon :)
8976178,55253991,2015-11-29,48407930,Bri,"This tiny home experience was so fun! The house is so well crafted and decorated. Everything you need and such cute instructions for the things you may need help doing in a tiny home. For future visitors I would advise that the shower time in a tiny home is VERY short so if your in town for an event and there are 2 of you, plan accordingly. Thank you for letting us use your cute space!"

3946631,19097443,2014-09-06,20490533,Carl,Lovely vintage building which sits amongst a beautiful floral entry courtyard!  The location is one block from the main shopping/dining area of Capitol Hill. 
3946631,23493947,2014-12-02,22197585,Cathryn,"This apartment was indeed charming! Clean, spacious and lovely. 
The host's welcoming note greeted us on the dining table. We were surprised to find this home larger than we expected.  The location is perfect, and in a great neighborhood. 
  I texted a few questions during our stay, and received prompt answers. Would definitely recommend, and we'd love to stay again."
3946631,27335931,2015-03-02,15105076,Deb,Sydney's place was lovely and the location great!
3946631,32015825,2015-05-12,366544,Suchit,"Sydney's home was beautiful and perfectly situated in Capitol Hill, a great neighborhood in Seattle. The house was set up nicely for us and we were very comfortable. The only hiccup in the whole experience was parking, which was very hard in the neighborhood, so if you're bringing a car, please keep that in mind."
3946631,39065763,2015-07-20,36488924,Steven,"Sydney's apartment was great! It's spacious, comfortable, and clean. It's really well-located on a quiet residential side street just a block away from a busy, interesting section of Capitol Hill and not far from other parts of the Hill, as well as other sections of Seattle. Once we figured out where we were, it was very easy to get around from there. Sydney was not around, but she was a great long-distance host, very accessible and responsive by e-mail and text. She was extremely accommodating, even allowing us to stay past the regular check-out time on our last day there since we had a late-night redeye flight back to the east coast. The apartment definitely has a comfortable ""lived-in"" feeling and plenty of space. We stayed for five nights, and started to feel like we lived there. We would definitely like to stay there again if and when we return to Seattle, and we highly recommend Sydney's apartment to others!"
3946631,43130026,2015-08-17,39730783,Amit,Sydney was a great host and her place was perfect for our stay.  The location was fantastic; her place is literally a block away from Broadway in Capitol Hill.  The apt was immaculately clean and we were very pleased with how spacious the apt was.  Sydney was accommodating with our schedule and had left a bottle of wine welcoming us for our stay.  I'd highly recommend her place and we'll definitely try to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle!
3946631,46971699,2015-09-14,43201869,Alex,"Great apartment just off the popular Broadway district of Capitol Hill. Spacious and well appointed. 
Bottle of wine on arrival was appreciated!
If visiting Seattle again, will be sure to book here. "
7699356,42953236,2015-08-16,23834043,William,The apartment was great and Alexandra was always nice and responsive! I don’t think I ever waited more than two minutes for a response to any question! She even drove into the city when I’d accidentally misplaced the keys to the apartment. The apartment itself is in great shape and the location is right near the water and several great bars. I’d definitely stay there again if I was in Seattle!
7699356,43846973,2015-08-22,36175464,Guadalupe,"Alexandra was a very responsible host.  She responded to several of our emails in a prompt manner.  Met us at the condo and gave us quick tour of the condo, parking, etc.  She checked in with us during our stay to see how things were going.    
The condo is in a prime location.  Near the Key Arena and Space Needle, monorail to downtown and walking distance to Pike's Market. The condo has a its own parking space if you have a car.  If you are sensitive to traffic noise this may not be the location for you.  Beautiful view of Puget Sound and the ferries crossing the bay. "
8594059,55410419,2015-12-01,43608646,Roger,"Everything was neat and tidy.

It was a very nice and comfortable stay.

The heating worked just great and the beds were very comfortable.

We really enjoyed the hosts recommended café.

We would stay again.
"
8594059,58245369,2016-01-01,34222916,Ramon,Great place if you want to be close to the U district. The place had everything we needed for our short stay. Owner was quick to respond to any questions. The house was exactly as the pictures. There were 5 of us and it was comfortable.
7496485,44799516,2015-08-29,39559723,Chris,"Checkin was easy.  We were greeted at the apartment to go over where things were, how they could be reached, and to exchange the keys.  The apartment was just as described, and the photos are accurate.  Within 15 minutes we had the place to ourselves.  The hosts graciously provided amenities such as coffee, bottled water, and even a bottle of bubbly.  Walking to the main drag in Capitol Hill took about 5 minutes, and there were plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars there.  We stayed here for 8 days, and never needed to contact the host for anything.  When we checked out, we just had to lock the handle of the door and leave the key on the table.  It was super easy.  There is cable for watching, and wifi for browsing.  I would stay here again if I'm back in the Seattle area."
703058,2415727,2012-09-25,3618396,Shelby,"great house, very quiet neighborhood, but easy walk to restaurants,shops and killer ice cream.  Craig made us feel very welcomed.  Will definitely stay again.  I couldn't get stars to work but all 5 stars."
703058,2460502,2012-09-30,3620763,Cassie,"Really enjoyed my stay.  The house and neighborhood were perfect.  Convenient to restaurants and grocery.  It was very nice to meet Craig.  He was a great host, friendly and helpful.  I will stay again if I have the opportunity."
703058,2582331,2012-10-11,3634772,Andrea,"A Seattle family of four - we just stayed for 10 days in this wonderful house. Furnished comfortably and with a lot attention to detail it offered all conveniences we needed to feel at home. Wallingford is a great neighborhood with shops and restaurants in walking distance. Craig is a terrific host, we would definitely stay here again."
703058,2642970,2012-10-17,778456,Bob,"What a lovely place to stay! We were here over a long weekend to attend an event at the University of Washington and had a wonderful time. Craig is a fantastic host. He was quite flexible in terms of check in/check out and even left some goodies in the fridge and a welcoming bottle of wine. The neighborhood is in a great location, half-way between the university and Fremont districts and a short walk from Gaslight Park. Beds were comfortable and the shower hot. What more could one ask? "
703058,2703910,2012-10-24,3726023,Jennifer,"Our family of four had a lovely stay in this well-appointed, comfortable home in a great, quiet neighborhood. The kitchen had everything and we enjoyed eating in the dining room. The house is near several parks which were walkable and a fantastic bakery. Running path was also several blocks away and shopping on Wallingford Avenue was close by. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to anyone visiting Seattle with or without small children. 

"
703058,2748773,2012-10-29,325470,Teague,"
I would stay here again without question.

A fabulous home!

This house is just as pictured, large and airy and very clean; approx. 5 min walk to gasworks park. We found it to be a very convenient location with nice food nearby....specifically the reccomended bakery down the block makes great Coffee and Gulten free bread.
Craig was incredibly accommodating and very helpful. 
The house is an excellent deal and a well loved space."
703058,2949965,2012-11-24,3414118,Wendy,"The bungalow was everything we had hoped, authentic, charming and extremely comfortable.  From the 15 year old rosemary ""tree"" growing in the front yard to the breathtaking view down the hill  to the city - it was exactly what we were looking for.  The beds, alone, would be worth the price - firm mattresses and vintage linen sheets made for the best night's sleep we ever had on the road.  The rooms were right out of Bungalow Living and I'll let others guess what the vintage switches represented on the kitchen blackboard. Great shower and whimsical decorations throughout.  Molly and Craig were the best hosts imaginable.  We'll be back - if we can ever find a free night!  "
703058,3225089,2013-01-02,2830278,Diane,"Craig is the perfect host: friendly, engaging, informative, and generous. The home is in the perfect location to enjoy Seattle and the University of Washington. All the conveniences of home living are provided. The home is very clean, cozy and super comfortable.

703058,3339852,2013-01-13,4558539,Ariana,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Craig's. Craig and Molly's home is bright, charming, and conveniently located. We loved the Wallingford Neighborhood. Craig was helpful and gave us some tips on fun places to visit nearby the house. Love the neighborhood! We took a walk every single morning. The place was clean and decorated very nicely."
703058,3439453,2013-01-29,3001431,Megan,"The location of this charming bungalow can't be beat, walking distance to everything in Wallingford and a short and easy hop on the bus to downtown. The house is spotlessly clean and the beds are brand new and super firm. A world traveler himself, Craig is a knowledgeable concierge for his neighborhood. He was flexible with our schedule and left many nice surprises to make our stay extra comfortable. "
703058,3471813,2013-02-04,4594682,Stacy,"Craig was a wonderful host and communication from begining to end was great!  The home was exactly as described and a delight to stay in.

703058,4181900,2013-04-16,3543257,Sarah,What a fantastic house!  My mother and aunt came in to Seattle to visit me and I rented it for them because it was so near to my home. They just loved it.  The house is great and so is the location.  And Craig and Molly are both incredibly fantastic hosts. I highly recommend this as a rental.
703058,4283931,2013-04-24,5670621,Martha,Craig is incredibly friendly and accommodating. The house is charming and oh so comfortable with a gorgeous garden and front porch made for reading. It is walking distance to great restaurants and parks. When we return to Seattle you can bet that we will be staying here! A truly wonderful Air BnB experience. 
703058,4348980,2013-04-29,875517,Kabril,"We had an enjoyable stay in Wallingford at Craig's Home. He was very friendly and helpful. Craig has definitely done his research regarding his neighborhod and you can find notes and maps of many restaurants,cafes, and what not in his house. I found this to be very helpful. The neighborhood is very beautiful and many of the streets were lined with lush green gardens. Wallingford is a great community to walk through and explore. The house was very cozy and suited everybody's needs quite well. I would most definitely rent Craig's place again. "
703058,4508173,2013-05-09,1312593,Michael,"Craig was an awesome host and we love this house, and the location.  It's a classic old Seattle craftsman, and very close to great restaurants, parks (e.g. Gasworks) and both central Fremont and Wallingford. The house also has all the features you'd want and more: beautiful patio/yard/garden, reliable internet and Apple TV, cleanliness and comfortable beds, and a great kitchen stocked with the essentials for cooking (e.g. oil, spices, french press coffee maker, toaster, etc).  Craig was very organized, welcoming, warm, and responsive to some of our special needs as a family with a toddler.  I highly recommend a stay here."
703058,4680013,2013-05-20,2832397,Mary,"Craig is a great host. He's relaxed, easy to communicate with and  flexible and made us feel right at home. The house is adorable, comfortable and clean, and thoughtfully organized and supplied with amenities to make a traveler feel at home; fresh flowers, nice linens, soaps, coffee, yogurt,  information about neighborhood restaurants & amenities, reading material, etc. It's located in a fun walking neighborhood, close to great restaurants, shops and Gas Works Park on Lake Union (the place to be for sunrise or sunset). It's also an easy drive to downtown Seattle and other neighborhoods. It was perfect for our family's visit to Seattle.

703058,4744110,2013-05-23,5570405,Josh,"I highly recommend staying at this excellent little craftsman bungalow in the wonderful neighborhood of Wallingford. The home is very close to countless eateries and shopping, and a magnificent park overlooking the Seattle skyline, mere blocks away. Craig was very accommodating as well, providing information on local hot spots and a stocked fridge. Thanks Craig! "
703058,4793694,2013-05-26,607356,Jason,"Hosts like Craig are the reason that AirBnB is so great. His house was great—very comfortable for four people and in a convenient location for everything we wanted to do in Seattle. But what really made this experience stand out was how kind of a host Craig was. When our flight was delayed a few hours, he was still happy to meet us at the house at midnight. He even left us snacks in the refrigerator. When we left, my girlfriend forgot her phone case and Craig texted about it and arranged for us to pick it up. He put lots of care into making us feel welcome for our stay. I would love to stay here again on a future visit."
703058,4837006,2013-05-28,189618,Angela,"Really cute, homey place, plenty of space. Our family of 4 spent a weekend here. Great location, it's only 10-15 minute drive from Pike Place Market / Seattle Center, and is in a peaceful older neighborhood with lots of cute bungalows. You can take the bus but I think having a car is much more convenient. Craig was super friendly, left yogurt and banana in the fridge, and gave us a tour of the house and plenty of info on the area. "
703058,4982823,2013-06-05,3520508,Jim,Craig and Molly were terrific hosts.  The house is well-located and well-supplied for all one's Seattle needs (and wants).  Ample parking's available and there's nearby shopping and public transportation.  I only wish there was an option for 6 stars instead of the meagre 5 supplied for a review!  Highly recommended and we'll of course look forward to staying there again during our next visit.
703058,5028038,2013-06-08,2258169,Christian,"Craig's house is a fairytale of a place.  It's got all the amenities, is very clean, and is decorated they way my dreams would want.  He helped move us in, told us all the good spots to hit nearby, and made us feel very welcome.  10/10, would stay again."
703058,5175021,2013-06-17,554916,Diane,"We absolutely loved staying at Craig's home.  It is a charming home, and Craig was the perfect host.  He did all he could to make sure that we were comfortable and happy there.  This is the sort of place that makes you feel that you are at home in the best possible way.  We would highly recommend this home, and Craig as a host."

703058,5631709,2013-07-09,4643863,Virginia,What a great experience! Will remember Airbnb next time we travel.
703058,5779460,2013-07-16,2909747,Lois,"This house and host get a six start rating from us. The house was everything the posting says it is, except more beautiful in real life. Craig was very accommodating and responsive to the few questions I had ( i.e. how does the remote work?). The neighborhood was beautiful. We were there for my sons' wedding and could not have had a more stress free visit. 
"
703058,5998828,2013-07-26,4709527,Arlette,"We just returned from a fantastic stay at Craig and Molly's home. Situated in the quaint but accessible neighborhood of Wallingford, it was the perfect place for our family of 4 to spend our vacation in Seattle. Not only is it a short walking distance from yummy restaurants, Gasworks park, and a great park for the kids to play, it has a fabulous view from the city. Craig and Molly were kind and gracious, welcoming us with yogurt and milk in the fridge, but with coffee, bananas, and lots of feedback on what to do and where to go in Seattle. The house was charming and has a lovely garden in the back to enjoy as well. Our stay here was great and we'd do it again in a heartbeat!!!"
703058,6419691,2013-08-12,6608359,Carson,"Craig and Molly provided a perfect house for our weeklong stay. Close to everything we wanted, the house had everything that we needed. Craig was always by his phone or computer to answer questions and Molly left us some homegrown veggies from the yard and invited us to take more if we wanted them. Thanks for the great first time Airbnb experience! Would stay again in a heartbeat!"
703058,6552756,2013-08-17,5295120,Kieran,"Craig was an excellent host and went out of his way to make us feel welcome in his home, his neighborhood and Seattle at large.  We were very pleased with our choice to stay at this house; it was perfect for our family of four. The house has vintage character & warmth, and is kept very clean and appointed nicely. Everything we needed for kitchen, bath, linens was waiting for us and intuitive to find. The rear patio and front porch both offer nice retreats after busy days of sightseeing.  We would certainly recommend this house to anyone staying in Seattle!"
703058,6888543,2013-08-29,4963154,Rita,"We had a wunderful time in Wallingfort. The house and garden are  magic, We slept great and the kitchen is awesome too. Craig is a nice guy. We are happy that we met Craig and could stay for 12 days at this great place in Seattle/Wallingfort.
Best greetings from Germany.
"
703058,7190975,2013-09-10,1890035,Sarah,"We loved this home, and Craig and Molly were wonderful!  We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay...such a cute house, close to great parks and restaurants.  I only wish we could have stayed longer. 
"
703058,7479852,2013-09-22,6791970,Jan,"When we arrived in Seattle Craig was ready and waiting for us at the house.  The house was absolutely wonderful.  Location was close to shopping, dining, and parks.  Craig was full of a wealth of information as far as things to do and see.  Would highly recommend this house to anyone visiting Seattle."
703058,7796632,2013-10-03,7776938,Katherine,"Perfect home getaway. Affordable and very, very, comfortable. Hosts made sure we had every thing we needed. On street parking. Free wi-fi. Craftsman home in quiet neighborhood. Lovely back yard garden. We would stay here again. Large kitchen and dining room. Suitable for big family dinner. Lots of Tv, Netflix, DVD, options too. Classic and fun."
703058,7899093,2013-10-07,865792,Ashley,"Staying at Craig's place was great. He greeted us upon arrival and gave us a tour of the house and plenty of advice about places to go in Seattle. The house itself is perfect. Quaint yet spacious, quiet, comfortable bed, big kitchen -- exactly what we were looking for. "
703058,8016342,2013-10-13,1699035,Richard,"We found Craig to be very accommodating and friendly.  He met us at the house at the agreed time to give us the keys and show us around.  It is a very nice Craftsman that has mostly original interior which we really enjoy. He supplied us with some breakfast items and showed us what we needed to know about the operation of lights, furnace, keys, etc. as well as a number of points of interest in the area.  He had recommendations on several restaurant and found it to be accurate.
We were impressed enough with everything that we had some fiends who live in the area to come by and see as they might be interested in using it when they have a number of friends and family visit.  We would recommend this as a great place to stay for anyone wanting easy access to downtown Seattle but out of the crowds and noise of the central city."
703058,8148198,2013-10-18,175897,Anna,"Craig and Molly's lovely Wallingford home was comfortable, convenient and perfectly suited for our family of four. They owners had everything nicely prepared for us after our long trip and even provided breakfast foods for our first morning. Craig is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the area (especially dining options), easy to reach and friendly. A lot of love has clearly been put into the house and its contents. We'd love to stay there again someday. "
703058,10272173,2014-02-10,264315,Toby,This is a lovely space and Craig is very accommodating. Great Seattle location and a fully equipped house with everything that we needed. Highly recommended - looking forward to the next visit!
703058,10435739,2014-02-18,2835213,Jan,"The house is precisely as the site described: a comfortable and lovely craftsman home. A very functional dining room and kitchen, and super beds. Good restaurants, grocery store, clothes, and great coffee. A visit to Essential Bakery is a must and within walking distance. The Gas Works park just down the hill from the house borders the lake and is a ""gas"" to walk or run around with the old industrial works still standing. Craig is a great host, offering plenty of suggestions for places to visit. The Univ. of Washington very close by as is downtown Space Needle, Pikes Place and all the amenities of the city. "
703058,12366016,2014-04-30,6590079,Linda,"Craig's place was great! We arrived late evening and he met us at the house. Beautiful neighborhood, view of the Space Needle from the hill. Quiet, convenient, clean. We had no issues with street parking. The backyard was gorgeous, too, tulips and greenery, hanging blossoms. Beds were comfortable and central heat worked great. The master bed also has an electric blanket :) Overall a wonderful, stress-free stay. Would stay here again. Thanks so much for hosting our family, Craig :)"
703058,12710380,2014-05-09,11278642,Joseph,"When we arrived in Seattle, Craig meet me at the house to give me a short tour.  Craig had a few snacks and a gallon of milk for the kids, which was unexpected and amazing since the last thing I wanted to do after flying across the country was run to the store.  The house was very comfortable and the whole family felt relaxed when we got back to the house.  My wife and kids loved the deep bathtub.  There is a bus stop just down the street which makes getting downtown quick and easy.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe.  From the front porch I was able to look west and see the mountains, I was just able to make out the tops of the buildings downtown.  Walking two houses east you get a great view of the city which changes with the different weather conditions, I made sure to check it out twice a day.  Walking two houses to the west you can see the Space Needle.  I walked home from a friends house at 1:30 one morning and felt safe.  As long as this house has availability, we will stay here when we return to Seattle."
703058,13404290,2014-05-27,12335652,Jodie,Craig was a great host.  He made it clear that he could be contacted at any time with any issues that arose during our stay.  He met us at the house when we arrived and provided us with tips for the city and the area.  The house was in a great location and was well suited for a family.
703058,15304674,2014-07-07,11741448,Michael,We had an excellent experience at Craig's house.  The house is very charming and clean.  It's in a great neighborhood near great restaurants and shops.  It was perfect for watching fireworks on the 4th!!    Craig was very friendly and informative.  My family didn't want to leave.  I will stay here again when I make it back to Seattle.
703058,15744517,2014-07-15,11434186,Emma,"My husband, 4 year old and I recently stayed in Craig's home for a week whilst in Seattle for a wedding. We couldn't have been happier with this choice which was so much better than the hotels we looked into.
Craig was there for our immediate arrival (even stocking the fridge with supplies!) showing us all we needed to know about his home, along with plenty of helpful information about what to do in the area. Craig's home is perfectly situated within close walking distance of parks, restaurants, cafés and shops to grab supplies. It's also a short drive to some great tourist attractions including downtown, woodland park zoo, Fremont and Ballard. Anything you could possibly want to know or do, Craig is host with the most!
The home itself was beautiful, also very clean and comfortable. It was an added bonus to have a fully equipped kitchen which was highly functional, washing machine & dryer, as well as a cute backyard that our 4 yo had so much fun exploring. You could not ask for more to make the holiday more comfortable!
We loved Seattle and hope to visit again as there is so much to do. We would definitely recommend this property and hope we can book it again in the future.
Thanks Craig and Molly!"
703058,16336781,2014-07-26,12723439,Irina,Very charming clean house located in a great neighborhood within walking distance from shopping and restaurants. The host Craig Cochran is very friendly and helpful.
703058,17550400,2014-08-14,11368080,Peter,"We had a wonderful time in this house. The house and the backyard are even more beautiful and larger than they appear on the images. The house is in a very good condition and very clean. The neighborhood is great, close to great restaurants and well connected to downtown Seattle. The hosts were amazing and did what they could to make us feel at home in their house. It was a great experience from check-in to check-out. There is no doubt we would pick this house again for our next trip to Seattle."
703058,18411382,2014-08-26,4803165,Graham,"Great host, beautifully appointed home, premiere location! I'll definitely stay here in the future!"
703058,18934796,2014-09-03,2648320,Crys,"Charming home. close to Fremont, the troll, gas works park (awesome skyline) and Wallingford. steps from bus stop to downtown. lovely home away from home. "
703058,19070740,2014-09-06,15232379,Fiona,"This house was a dream. Craig was a gentleman to deal with. The location is perfect for exploring seattle and very safe neighbourhood. I cannot recommend this home highly enough, it exceeded all our expectations. Anyone would be lucky to stay here."
703058,19326217,2014-09-10,15977043,Rob,"Craig and Molly were great hosts! We had a wonderful time and so peaceful.  It was a great location, located near some great restaurants. Lots of good recommendations. Easy access to downtown Seattle. Definitely, a great way to go."
703058,19465848,2014-09-13,18686819,Kristin,"We really enjoyed our experience in the Wallingford home.  The vibrant Wallingford neighborhood is close to parks and many great restaurants. The house was comfortable, cute, and welcoming.  It was perfectly suited for two families with babies.  Craig was a great host with excellent tips on what to do in Seattle and where to eat.  I highly recommend the Wallingford Craftsman.  "
703058,19607501,2014-09-15,18874365,Corey,Craig was so welcoming when we got into town. He took the extra time to show us around the house and have us a ton of tips about Seattle. His food recommendations were delicious! We loved staying in this beautiful home and hope to return again soon! Thanks so much.
703058,19931591,2014-09-21,13340014,Lori,"What a wonderful house in a wonderful location.  Craig was extremely helpful and engaging, responded quickly to questions, and welcomed us when we arrived.  The house was well-kept and comfortable and a welcome retreat.  Because it is half a block from the bus, access to downtown was smooth and easy.  On top of that, it is close to neighborhood restaurants, bars, and. A grocery store.  I think we will stay here every time we come to Seattle."
703058,20197764,2014-09-25,3599590,Lindsey,"The home and neighborhood were exactly as described and pictured on the site.  It was a comfortable, clean, open and inviting home with lots of comfortable communal space.  It was perfect for my parents' and in-laws' stay during our wedding...everyone was perfectly happy just lounging and chatting in the house!  The backyard, when the weather was nice, was also a beautiful, peaceful and private green spot to spend time in.  With that said, the Wallingford neighborhood is definitely one of the most centrally located places in Seattle.  Whatever your transportation method, it is easy to get anywhere in the city from the house.  And finally, Craig was extremely helpful and friendly, while staying completely out of our hair.  You won't find a more professionally run, yet personal,  airbnb rental.  "
703058,21141514,2014-10-12,13580456,Shan,"All those other 5-star reviews are right on! This house is outstanding in every way. It is exactly as great as it looks in the pictures. It worked perfectly for our family of two adults and two teenaged girls. The central location is unbeatable, especially if you like to walk. Safe at night, near just about every kind of restaurant, and only a few blocks from the lake and Gasworks Park. And, as our very helpful host told me, there is a bike/pedestrian path that goes to the UW. We had an amazing weekend, and staying here played a large part in that. We hope to be back again soon!"
703058,21833777,2014-10-25,21502814,Connie,"This home is truly amazing! We just returned from a one week stay and miss it terribly. Craig and Molly have created a very warm and charming environment. The location is spot on, extremely walkable as well as convenient to getting around Seattle by car. There is even a lovely little spot for delicious pasta and wine right on the corner. Would not hesitate to recommend this adorable home and would definitely return!"
