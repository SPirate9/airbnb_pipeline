741699,9959057,2014-01-21,4051881,Colleen,"Matt's Zen Retreat was everything we hoped it to be but better. We spent a fabulous relaxing weekend in his home for three nights. The attention to details, the overall feeling and ease of booking was dynamite. We are house envy. The floor plan layout and the wonderful king bed and the steam shower were such a treat. We didn't want to leave. The linens, kitchen utensils, furniture, beds; everything was perfect. It is extra special we can bring our two dogs along and appreciate that tremendously. The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet and such a fantastic walk to Rainer Avenue for all you need: cafes, juice bar, restaurants, butcher, yoga, it's all there. Plus a great grocery store a few blocks away too. Being so close to Seward Park is also a perk. We spent the sunny Saturday on the rocky beach enjoying the weather. Thank you Matt - this truly was one of the best weekends we have had in a while. We came back home truly relaxed and recharged. We will be back! Your home is beautiful.
"
741699,10049772,2014-01-27,1134795,Paul,"First off I must start with saying that Matt was a prompt, attentive, and gracious host. He is an excellent communicator and is focused on providing a great experience.

As excellent as Matt was as the host, the house lived up to all expectations. The house is beautifully decorated with many tasteful touches. It feels really warm and provided a much needed retreat for me. 

If you are in need of being in the middle of things, I may recommend staying somewhere else. However, I was able to get to/from the Zen Retreat from many different parts of town really easily. It was also incredibly handy that there is a PCC just down the street. In summer, being that close to Seward Park would be great also.

Overall, if you are looking for a quiet warm and engaging weekend with a loved one, a couple of friends, or even just for yourself you will be hard pressed to find a better experience."
741699,10560969,2014-02-24,5657524,Shannon And Jeff,Matt's Place was perfect!  I had a friend in town visiting for the weekend and it was a wonderful place to just chill and catch up.  Everything was very clean and instructions were very easily accessible and well defined.  I will definitely be checking out this location again when I am back in the area.
741699,10569728,2014-02-25,11462384,Natasha,"Matt was kind enough to let me do a photo shoot at this wonderful. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and more! Nice quiet neighborhood and the house is just gorgeous! The beds were sooo comfortable and the steam shower was amazing. I will definitely book again if I need a nice weekend getaway! Matt was a wonderful host, making sure I had everything I needed. He was really easy to communicate with as well. I could tell he cared about me having a pleasant stay at his beautiful home. "
741699,10692033,2014-03-03,4808666,Aricka,"Matt was a peach to work with!  Super flexible with the check-in and check-out times, while coordinating more than one guest, each of us arriving from different cities.  He was easy to get in touch with, and made sure we had everything we needed.

The house is fantastic.  Lots of light, very tasteful and peaceful decor.  Plenty of room, cozy.  The porch/deck was a lovely space for morning coffee, writing, and taking a breather.  We were in town for a writer's conference, and it was great to ""come home"" to a chill space to recoup.

THE SAUNA IS FANTASTIC.  Definitely our favorite part of the experience.  The beds were comfy, and there's plenty of storage space for personal items in the chest(s) and closets.  We had plenty of extra blankets and towels, and if you've forgotten any toiletries, there's plenty of great little samples in the bathroom pantry.

The walk from the light rail with baggage can be a little bit of a hike so be prepared if you are not a light packer!  We typically
split a cab between the three of us when we were in a hurry to make it the conference, and it wasn't expensive.

I'd definitely book this space again!!

741699,10735734,2014-03-04,4385483,Heather,"I stayed at the Zen Retreat with my mom and 4-year-old daughter. The place was perfect for all generations! I enjoyed the steam shower; my daughter loved being able to watch PBS Kids in bed on a large screen; my mother appreciated the elegant decor; and we all loved the comfortable beds. It was great to be able to walk to the PCC (food co-op) in the morning. We hope to return on future visits! Thank you, Matt!"
741699,10781810,2014-03-07,206203,Amanda,Matt's place is a wonderful retreat in an eclectic neighborhood. I even got to join a neighborhood Mardi Gras parade! There is great shopping and restaurants close by and the Zen Retreat is a comfortable nicely decorated home away from home. Treat yourself to the Zen Retreat.
741699,10916383,2014-03-12,2089034,Maureen,"The house was exactly what we expected.  It was beautifully decorated, clean and welcoming.  It is a great space for just adults or families.  Great yard for the dog and close to coffee, groceries.  It was great being so close to Seward Park and the lake.   We would stay here again in a heartbeat.   Thanks Matt for your hospitality.   "
741699,10975937,2014-03-16,10851825,Alexander,"Great first AirBnB experience.  Booking and checking in with Matt was seamless.  Gorgeous house in a nice quiet area.  We stayed with our 2 boys (ages 3 and 1.5).  While the house has not been child-proofed, we did not have any issues.  We did have to move some of his nicer things out of reach ... just in case!

We went to child-friendly Geraldine's down the street, as well as the bakery and the local Starbucks.  All low key and kid-friendly.  "
741699,11072606,2014-03-19,2703888,Karen,"My family and I had a wonderful time at the Zen retreat.  Quiet and peaceful location but accessible to restaurants, shops, light rail and parks for the kids.  We all loved the shower and the kitchen was nicely stocked.  Matt was very responsive and easy to deal with.  Would recommend."
741699,11104389,2014-03-20,12131973,Chassea,"Only stayed one night as we were heading to the airport in the morning. Host was very flexible. Accommodation was wonderful. Beautiful and relaxing space, very clean, and easy to find. Would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
741699,11319101,2014-03-30,9419872,Fanfan,"Matt's house is booked from my friend Yiyu,the following is her review: Matt is a artist,all the details in the house are amazing and relax, I like the photography in the table.I was astonished the Washington Lake is near Columbia city when I stayed here in the fourth (website hidden) whole family  enjoy a wonderful spring vacation here!"
741699,11570352,2014-04-07,13773650,Marcus,"Great location, great space, great host. Matt made things very easy for us and was a call away if we needed anything. His home is clean and sharp, in a very nice neighborhood, and surprisingly close to the airport. Would stay here again for sure. "
741699,11604968,2014-04-08,9565739,Elizabeth,"We absolutely loved the Zen Retreat! It was perfect for two couples to stay, close to everything we needed, there was street parking, it was comfortable and peaceful and fully stocked with everything we could need. We will hopefully be coming back to this place soon! "
741699,11827517,2014-04-16,11650833,Bruce,"We enjoyed staying at Matt's place. Lots of room, a nice deck and yard and good location. Very dog friendly if you have one. We could walk to the Columbia City downtown (about 3 blocks long) and could also walk to the Light Rail and take it into downtown. It was nice to be out of the city of Seattle and explore a new neighborhood. 

Matt was  responsive to whatever emails we sent to him. "
741699,11925465,2014-04-19,206203,Amanda,Matt is a friendly host and the Seward Park Zen Retreat is a pleasure to stay in. I am a frequent visitor and always enjoy my stay.
741699,12015544,2014-04-21,7099422,Thaddeus,"Great place and great host.  I just wish we could have stayed longer.  

Thanks Matt!"
741699,12301321,2014-04-28,14083449,Michael,"Matt was highly communicative and every easy to work with on any issues. There was only one extremely small issue that was resolved super fast. 

The property is really lovely. Zen retreat is an excellent way to describe the property. While I was on a business trip that had its own stresses, it was wonderful to come home at the end of the day. It truly was like coming home.  The properly is so calm , quiet and truly relaxing.  The neighborhood is a quiet and I don't think I even heard another neighbor. "
741699,12408205,2014-05-01,206203,Amanda,"The Zen Retreat is quiet, in a great neighborhood and Matt is a fantastic host. I stay there often and highly recommend it!"
741699,12818785,2014-05-12,6059091,Irene,"The Seward Park Zen Retreat was perfect for our stay in Seattle! I was traveling with a friend/ collaborator and we both found our beds and bedrooms to be perfectly spacious and comfortable. Matt was very easy to communicate with. The home is clean, pretty, spacious and cozy. Thanks Matt. "
741699,13097368,2014-05-19,7764095,Tess,"The decor and ambiance of this house is just beautiful! Everything was really lovely, clean, comfortable, fantastic artwork to peruse. We had a quiet and relaxing overnight and really appreciated the wonderful vibe.

One of the best bathroom remodels I've seen also, just gorgeous. Don't miss the steam shower! "
741699,13184834,2014-05-21,13838155,Eric,"Matt's place was great - very nicely decorated, comfortable, clean and inviting. The sauna was a real treat, and certainly a must if you're visiting in the winter. The neighbourhood is quiet and well treed, with a couple good restaurants within walking distance. All-in-all an excellent first time airbnb experience, so ""thank you for that Matt"". We'll certainly recommend the Seward park Zen Retreat to friends."
741699,13309632,2014-05-25,13648977,Shaun,This Place was great.  Relaxing and calm.  Outside of the downtown area but still accessible.  Thanks Matt!
741699,13409865,2014-05-27,12913518,Yun,"We really enjoyed our stay here; a short drive to downtown and ample street parking. Also loved that there were restaurants within walking distance. The house was clean, spacious and beautifully decorated. The bathroom was as luxurious as described, a real treat after a long day of walking! Matt responded quickly to our questions, all in all, would definitely stay again!"
741699,13556800,2014-05-30,5041357,Nancy,"I stayed one night in the Seward Park Zen retreat. The house was immaculate and tastefully decorated and spacious. The steam shower was divine! We each had our own cozy bedroom, with comfortable mattresses and bedding. The neighborhood is quiet with tree-lined streets and well-tended homes. I felt very safe there. The highlight was walking around Seward Park and Lake Washington. If I would have stayed in a hotel, I would have been in the hustle and bustle and never would have experienced a beautiful part of Seattle . Coordinating our stay with Matt was easy - he is very friendly and prompt, with well organized instructions for entry into the home and suggestions for what to do nearby.
We had a wonderful time and would return again!
Thank you Matt!

"
741699,14008332,2014-06-10,10488369,Marjo,"We had a great week at Matts Seward Park Sen Retreat. House is perfect to stay. You can go from here to all sides of Seattle, wich we did. Most of the times by bus. With the warm and sunny weather we had, a taxi home is very pleasant. Quiet neighbourhood. And people are very friendly.
Thanks Matt for having this place in the rental.
"
741699,14153767,2014-06-13,11338584,Elena,"This is a very sweet little house in a quiet neighborhood not too far from the light rail.  If you take the light rail from the airport, keep in mind, there is NO cab stand and it is a LONG walk to the house.  You may want to keep a cab company phone number at hand.  It cost us $10.  The cabby said it would cost about $30 to the airport from the house. The house itself has absolutely gorgeous landscaping but the building is slightly shabby (mostly the deck and the very old torn up linoleum in the kitchen).  The inside is small, but well appointed with everything you'd need.  Nice bathroom with great shower (we didn't try the steam).  There is only one bath for the two bedrooms.  Beds are comfortable - low to the ground platforms.  The artwork is a little edgy and some is R rated. Nice living room and dining room. Matt was very available and accommodating. We stayed one night on our way to the San Juan Islands with another couple and it was perfect for us."
741699,14218353,2014-06-15,9911998,Linda & Kevin McClintock,"Matt's house is very attractive and well equipped and in a lovely quiet neighbourhood not far from the centre of town. There was plenty of room for two couples to relax in a comfortable, calm setting. We appreciated the comprehensive info package and enjoyed our stay."
741699,14390073,2014-06-18,13614898,(email hidden),We had an excellent stay.  Home was everything as listed.  Very private-- nice neighborhood.  Everybody seems to walk in Seattle & evrything you need is walking distance ( 1 mile or less).. Thanks Matt for sharing the house.
741699,14515057,2014-06-21,15236292,Yibo,"Our group of 4 stayed at the Seward Park Zen Retreat during our visit to Seattle. The place was amazing! Matt was an amazing host, he provided us new towels and even sparkling water drinks. Thanks Matt! :) We loved everything about the house (both inside and outside)! The house provided an extremely cozy feeling: the decors, the trees, as well as the features it provided and the furnitures. The beds were comfortable, the sofas in the living rooms were great, and both the kitchen and the dinning room were really nice. The bathroom, though a little bit small, was so amazing and comfortable to just staying in there. We truly felt like we were at home! The house was located in a very quiet neighborhood and we were able to park our car right in front of the house. There was even a friendly and playful cat that came by the house every night during our stay. Overall, we all loved the place very much and we would highly recommend this place to whoever looking for a cozy place to stay during the visit to the Seattle area."
741699,14677950,2014-06-24,10889787,Tony,"Matt was great to work with and the Zen Retreat is a fantastic place. Will definitely want to stay there again when I am back in Seattle. 

"
741699,14777408,2014-06-26,1886897,Toni & Natalie,"Matt had a great place to stay while visiting Seattle! He was easy to coordinate and communicate with throughout our entire stay. The home is clean, location is great, and had many amenities. He even provided treats, toys and bowls for our dog. Thanks for a great stay Matt, we'll definitely be back for future visits. "
741699,14872065,2014-06-28,16150788,Mike,"Matt has provided a beautiful, well maintained property.
Nice neighborhood. All amenities were provided.
Would definitely recommend this host and property to others.

741699,15566497,2014-07-12,11203508,Alexandra/Philippe,"Notre séjour a été très agréable. L'appartement est spacieux, joliment aménagé et confortable."
741699,15676796,2014-07-14,12095659,Danielle,Overall experience was wonderful! Matt was very thorough with keeping in touch and keeping us up to date on the stay. The house was beautiful and accomodating for us. Absolutely loved the shower!!!! This was our first experience with something like this and we will absolutely be doing it again. I would recomment this place to anyone.
741699,15824555,2014-07-16,16143588,Candace,"The Seward Park Zen retreat was exactly what we expected. Located in a beautiful and quiet neighborhood, it was serene, spacious and comfortable. Matt was helpful and responsive from beginning to end. Since this was my first airbnb experience, I'm sure I had more than the usual number of questions, and Matt was patient, friendly and clear on all points. In fact, my husband left a camera behind and Matt called us in enough time to allow us turn around and retrieve it! Lifesaver!! I have to add that the steam shower was a HUGE plus. I would recommend this welcoming dwelling to anyone and everyone, and hope to return again."
741699,16031420,2014-07-20,17568697,Ted,"Matt was wonderful to deal with.  He was very responsive and thorough, and he sent all the information I needed up front, so that I never needed to ask him for anything.  The house was beautifully decorated and the pictures were accurate.  It really is a gorgeous house.  I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to others.  Both the host and the property were top notch.

This was my first Airbnb experience and Matt made it a breeze.  It was only later I read about all the potential issues a guest might encounter, and indeed I found other hosts to be unresponsive.

Although no reflection on Matt or the property, you probably want to have a car if you stay here and expect to go out, since the restaurants/stores within walking distance are limited.  After all, this is a residential neighborhood and not downtown.  There is a casual burger joint, an Italian restaurant, and a health food store just a couple blocks away."
741699,16409375,2014-07-27,16543087,Cece,Matt's house is amazing! Felt like home from the minute we walked in the door!! My husband and I took a two week road trip up the coast and made Matt's house our stop in Seattle. It was a short 10 minute drive from downtown and major public transportation. The steam shower was perfect after a day of sightseeing. We would did definitely return again!! The laundry room wall paper was my favorite part! ;)
741699,17140998,2014-08-08,6990507,John,"Lovely apartment just outside of the city. Convenient location to drive downtown or escape to the great parks in the region. Nice kitchen, porch and an unbeatable steam shower in the bathroom. We had a warm week since the air conditioner was broken, but otherwise enjoyed our stay."
741699,17637992,2014-08-15,3299766,Kacie & Damien,"Matt graciously let me utilize his gorgeous home for 2 hours on a Wednesday afternoon for a photo shoot.  The place is absolutely stunning.  The photographer was extremely impressed with the lighting and different areas of the house that we were able to use for pictures.  The only thing that I would have changed would be to have rented the house for a whole day so I could have enjoyed it more :) 
It was so easy to get in and out of the house as well.  Easy, no hassle.  Would definitely recommend to family and friends.   "
741699,17815151,2014-08-18,12561247,Debbie,"Our first experience with airbnb staying at the Seward Park Zen Retreat Seattle exceeded our expectations in so many ways.  First, Matt was super at replying quickly to my questions about the stay.  Second, the house and accommodations were perfect for our stay.  The kitchen contained everything we needed to prepare and share a meal with our family.  The location was perfect for our travel plans.  We hope to stay at Seward Park Zen next year when visiting family again.  Thank you Matt for sharing your house!"
741699,18161622,2014-08-23,1638551,Nancy,"Our recent visit to Seward Park Zen Retreat was most pleasant!  The neighborhood was very quiet and lovely to walk about.  The house is very nicely appointed and the convenience of having a washer and dryer was great.  The location absolutely requires one to have a car.  We had no difficult getting from place to place from that location.  Matt was attentive to all our requests and has easy to understand tips and instructions in several different areas of the house!  I would comment that if you are 2 couples, there is only one bath and it is small.  Also, if you are TV fanatic, there is a fabulous Sony but it is in one of the bedrooms!  Would we go back?  Yes!"
741699,18476859,2014-08-27,10842827,Steffi,"Ein tolles Haus in einer tollen ruhigen Lage. Leider waren wir nur für eine Nacht dort, wären gerne länger geblieben, weil wir uns gleich wohlgefühlt haben. Es war alles vorhanden was wir brauchten. Gerne wieder!"
741699,18571786,2014-08-28,19640558,Brandi,"Matt was very responsive and his house is beautiful. The only thing that bummed us out is that the ac didnt work, and for some reason we could not get on Netflix or hulus. "
741699,18576730,2014-08-28,1618279,Alex,"The Zen Retreat was a really beautiful space and a great place for us to make a base camp in Seattle. We had just come back from a backpacking trip on the Olympic Peninsula, and Matt's place was a really comfortable one for us to clean up and get cozy. Comfortable beds, a nice shower, easy parking, a great porch, and a quiet neighborhood on a hill were all highlights. It was a little bit of a ways outside of downtown, but we knew that going in and it fit our needs just fine. We were only there for one night, but all three of us were very enthusiastic about the house."
741699,18780655,2014-09-01,6036290,Anne,"We had a fabulous time at Seward Park Zen Retreat and were sad we didn't have a longer stay.  The house was filled with all the comforts of home.  Loved the garden!  Although we didn't meet Matt he was so helpful with advice, instructions and made our stay very easy.  His neighbours were great as well, they gave us a lift down to the light rail.  All in all a great time.  Anne and John"
741699,18901004,2014-09-02,997246,Andrew,"The house is very nice and well appointed. Matt was extremely helpful and very communicative. My only complaint is that the door to the downstairs apartment was not secured when we arrived. The downstairs apartment is accessible down a flight of stairs from the main level. When we arrived the door to these stairs was not locked. Nothing happened, and I am sure the downstairs tenant is a good person, but it was unnerving that someone could have had access to our area of the house during our stay if we had not noticed the unlocked door on arrival. The issue was made worse because there is no sign on the door explaining where the door leads. We only caught it because we were exploring the house. Recommend installing a more substantial lock and ensuring it is secured prior to tenant arrival. A sign on the door would also be good so people know to not go downstairs unless necessary to do laundry so as not to disturb the other tenant."
741699,18948163,2014-09-03,18572463,Jerry,We had a great stay at the Zen Retreat. Matt was very help full and quick to respond to all my requests. The apartment was very clean and welcoming. It was the type of place that you would feel great inviting someone over to visit. We will definitely stay here again when we are visiting Seattle. 
741699,19081925,2014-09-06,17244000,Pennell,"Zen retreat was absolutely great.  We hesitated booking because it was a little pricey for our budget, but are so glad we booked!  Worth every penny.  Just walking into Matt's place provided instant relaxation.  Totally welcoming environment, comfortable living/dining, kitchen had everything we needed and more.  We slept well and LOVED the shower.  Also, the yard is a sweet treat in itself.  Definitely recommend."
741699,19133278,2014-09-07,3333715,Matthew,The house was great. Only stayed here for one night bet felt at home. I really like the Seward park/columbia city area. Hadn't really hung out there before but really enjoyed it. It's also easily accessible.
741699,19314672,2014-09-10,1706206,Lina,"Matt's apartament is a true retreat away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Wonderful decor and furnishings, fully equipped.
Communication with Matt has been very easy and fast."
741699,19383793,2014-09-11,76883,Licia,"We were just there for one night, but it was a very sweet stay. The zen retreat was a lovely space. Peaceful, quiet, simple, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was easy to get around, walked to the local natural food store and got nice organic veggies, fish and coffee. 

Matt's directions were clear and easy to follow. We would happily visit again."
741699,19512850,2014-09-14,15087075,Anke,Matt has a nice house with very nice steam shower. It's a quiet neighbourhood. For us it was a bit to far from downtown and Seattle centre. Matt was willing to answer all our questions.
741699,19638190,2014-09-15,13840799,Maverick,"The Seward Park Zen Retreat was so beautiful and serene.  The apartment was very clean and well decorated, and the location was just what we were looking for.  I felt very calm and centered during my time in the home.  The sauna was great, and I loved checking out the coffee table books in the living room.  Matt provided a ton of relevant information to me a couple weeks before my stay.  He was a great, informative host who genuinely wants his guests to have a great experience.  I would highly recommend this listing. "
741699,19734536,2014-09-17,2741058,Jordan,"Really great place. Clean, classy and very unique. I would stay here again any time I'm in the area. Nice neighbor hood and super shot drive to get to downtown."
741699,19856453,2014-09-19,19732337,Evan,"The house is perfect, and Matt is a good host. He told me everything and details about the house. I like its decoration so muh"
741699,20083687,2014-09-23,16833974,Michael,"Matt's place was awesome.  Quiet neighborhood and very close to the water. Artwork was added benefit. The house was very close to downtown, Freemont, Belmont, Capital Hill. I can't wait to stay there again."
741699,20341654,2014-09-28,18636606,Lindsay,We had a great stay at Matt's. Very peaceful!  Loved the decor and the music.  Comfy beds and a great shower. Located close to everything. Would definitely stay again!
741699,20899018,2014-10-07,19285593,Jolene,Matt's Zen Retreat was very welcoming when you come to the front door where you hear water trickling in a fountain.  The artwork and amenities were much better than a hotel room. We weren't used to not having a TV in the living room but to be honest we didn't miss it. It was nice just having soft music playing and spending time with the family.  Thank you Matt for providing a place we would stay again should we ever be in the Seattle area.
741699,21128680,2014-10-12,19735293,Ke (Tony),"Great experience staying at Matt's place. Perfect location, close to dining and lake. Fully equipped house, beautiful decor, comfy beds. Matt is friendly and helpful, very easy to communicate with. Will definitely stay again when we come back in seattle."
741699,21296248,2014-10-14,19236873,Sara,Everything in this home was as it said it was.. We had our children with us and they really enjoyed the space as well! It was super cozy and comfortable and had everything we needed :) 
741699,21445444,2014-10-17,329164,Jill,"Matt's place was great.  Very minimalistic (in a good way) & very clean.  The sheets and beds were very comfortable.  I was sick so the steam shower helped a lot.  Only stayed for about 18 hours, but we will be back!  Thanks Matt!"
741699,22356979,2014-11-04,7465933,Ray & Tina,"The place was an accommodation. Locations was okay neighborhood quite. House a little to eclectic for us and could use a lot more attention to detail. like cleanliness , real towels and maybe a clean BBQ. Matt was good at communication and if this rental was brought up to standard I would stay again.  "
741699,22453515,2014-11-07,206203,Amanda,The Zen Retreat is a great place to relax and enjoy the wonderful Columbia City and Seward Park neighborhoods. The steam shower is a lovely amenity and the place is tastefully designed.  I like to stay here when its available in my many trips to Seattle. Matt is a very responsive host.
741699,22731179,2014-11-13,2066555,Tom,"We loved staying at Matt's place. The description was indeed accurate. The apartment--it's actually the whole first floor of the house--is very quiet and peaceful, beautifully decorated, and very comfortable. The front yard has been made into a lovely wooded garden with flowers shrubs and birches. It's always a joy to have a full kitchen--and a gas stove!--because we both love cooking and it saves a lot on meals when traveling. Washer and dryer available and included.

Matt stayed right in touch with us by email before we arrived, and when we had a couple of questions during our 6-ight stay. He also checked in half-way through the week to make sure all was well.

The neighborhood is residential and a very nice place to be. Easy parking on the street in front of the house. It's worth mentioning that it's VERY hilly, and walking the mile or so to the light rail and back was a good workout.

We highly recommend."
741699,22775225,2014-11-14,9177696,Michael,The house was beautiful and exactly as described.  Matt left detailed directions which made it easy to find and access all of the amenities that we needed during our stay.  There was adequate parking.  This was a fantastic experience.  We did not interact with Matt during our stay.  There were only two of us who stayed however there could easily been more accommodated in the space available.  We rented a car and there was plenty of parking available both during the day and at night.  The steam shower was heavenly.  I would strongly recommend the Seward Park Zen Retreat.  
741699,22870461,2014-11-16,23589140,Rebeca,Great place to stay. The location was really good and a fast drive to downtown Seattle. The house was very cozy and provided everything we needed. The steam shower was super nice! Matt was also very helpful and explained everything to us once we booked the place. 
741699,22899639,2014-11-17,22415738,Chantelle,The house wad amazing and exactly like the pictures. Matt as a host was very kind and accommodating. The atmosphere of the house was very zen and the art was a big highlight of conversation for my dinner party. I would love to come back any time.
741699,23035204,2014-11-21,206203,Amanda,"The Zen Retreat is one of my favorites and I stay in Seattle often. The steam shower is a joy and the place so comfortable. Matt is a great host also, very responsive and makes arrangements easy. Treat yourself and stay here."
741699,23662696,2014-12-07,6911867,Ashish,Really good and comfy place. Loved it
741699,24632866,2015-01-01,15231130,Margaret,"We were lucky enough to spend two weeks over Christmas in the Zen Retreat. Matt was extremely easy to communicate with. His home is warm, well decorated and clean. Since we were there for the holidays, I did a lot of cooking and found the kitchen to be well equipped. I am a gardener and was charmed by the lovely landscaping. We picked the house based on the location. It was close to our son and daughter in laws home as well as close to our favorite park, Seward Park and all that The Columbia City neighborhood has to offer in the way of cute shops and great restaurants and bakeries.  We had a ball and hope to stay there the next time we are in Seattle."
741699,25019389,2015-01-05,23265031,Erika,"Our experience at the Seward Park Zen was very relaxing and inviting. 

Our host was very helpful and welcoming. He was also very informative as to where everything was located which made it very easy and smooth for our trip.  We were all very pleased with our stay at the Seward Park Zen Retreat as it is nestled in a quiet, yet quaint neighborhood of Columbia City, WA (just 20 mins. from Seattle).  It was very inviting and all of the amenities in the house were all functioning and well taken care of. 

The neighborhood had a cute downtown area with lots of really good places to eat and drink and cute little boutiques to shop at.

Another great thing about this place was that it was close to Seward Park, which had a bike path and trails for hiking which we enjoyed doing very much.
 
We hope to be back soon to the Seward Park Zen for another relaxing vacation.

Thanks again."
741699,25558935,2015-01-19,6592485,Celina,"Such a beautiful home. Comfortable, clean, and cozy.  The host Matt was very helpful and quick to respond.  The shower is amazing and slept like a baby every night. Zen retreat is a perfect description for the house. Quick can ride to downtown and great restaurants nearby.  Excellent experience. "
741699,25913926,2015-01-29,5928492,Adrienne,"We were so fortunate to find Matt and the Seward Park Zen Retreat on the afternoon my daughter and son-in-law were arriving in Seattle for a visit and our other plans had unexpectedly fallen through. Matt immediately replied to my query and was wonderful in helping us make the arrangements. The house is beautiful and truly has a calm, ""zen"" ambiance, and at the same time it is comfortable and functional with everything you need supplied.  I know that the steam shower was much appreciated.  The location for us was perfect as it's a few blocks from my other daughter's home, and was a wonderful gathering place for our family.  Plus it's proximity to PCC and Seward Park is a plus!

I want to add that Matt was very helpful when I asked him about the cleaning products that are used at the house as we have chemical allergies/sensitivities, and my daughter has had breast cancer. This makes traveling a challenge. He checked with his house cleaners and found out that they use safe cleaning products.  For this I am so very grateful! 

I will definitely recommend Matt and the Seward Park Zen Retreat to any of our friends and family!"
741699,26106587,2015-02-03,25907299,Beverly,"Matt provided excellent communication and it was a breeze to get in. My friend and I opted to walk the 1 mile from the Columbia City Transit to the home since it was not raining. We took short cab rides to and from the Transit to go into the city and tried the bus one morning as well.

Great nearby store but we ate out a lot. Microwave was a bit confusing to use but we only needed it once. Beds were VERY comfortable. Neighborhood is quiet.

"
741699,26334144,2015-02-09,6802556,Ethan,"The zen retreat is an amazing, perfect getaway. It's clean and has everything you need. There are lots of extra touches which will make your stay great. Matt is friendly and really easy to deal with. A definite awesome find."
741699,26423132,2015-02-12,20532848,Susan,"Lovely home!! Well appointed, photos are accurate, good communication, would stay here again for sure!!!"
741699,27192351,2015-02-27,4487798,Alex,Place was really private and convenient to Seward park for a run and close the city. 
741699,27458364,2015-03-05,20145745,(email hidden),"The home is in a quiet neighborhood and beautifully appointed. Everything was as listed, with many special surprises throughout. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will return again."
741699,27632639,2015-03-08,8058724,Melissa,We really enjoyed staying at Matt's home. Matt was really responsive and approved us to stay last minute. The home is just like in the pictures only more beautiful and most importantly it's really clean. The yard is gorgeous. Wonderful neighborhood and walkable to some really nice businesses. Would definitely stay here again!
741699,27930763,2015-03-15,12038375,Deb,"My hubby, and sons are in agreement with me that the Zen Retreat was the perfect place to relax and unwind while enjoying the sights of Seattle. Its location up the hill from Columbia City shopping and restaurants was ideal. The house was comfy, beautiful, and equipped with lots of amenities. I would definitely stay there again, if we return. Thanks, Matt!"
741699,28061287,2015-03-16,3218117,Brooke & Benny,"Stay here.  You will not regret it.
Matt's home is gorgeous.  Tastefully and creatively decorated, extremely clean, and well-appointed. We stayed with another couple and found we had plenty of room for the four of us.  We enjoyed the space so much that after some exploring downtown we opted to return home to make our own dinner and relax in the house.  The steam shower is an oasis.  You will not want to get out.  The neighborhood is clean, friendly, and close to the water. Excellent for strolling. PCC Natural Market is 2 blocks away and a conveniently placed stairway, at the end of the block, makes it a very quick walk.  Though we didn't meet Matt, he was responsive and communicative.  His messages were thoughtful and anticipated every question we may have so, by the time we arrived, we had all the information we needed.  We're grateful for the time we had in his beautiful home and are hoping to return in the summer to take advantage of the fantastic deck.  Thanks, Matt!"
741699,28089224,2015-03-17,4171087,Jacqueline,"Beautiful home! Had everything we needed for our very short stay. Shower was a bonus. Would stay here again, Matt made everything easy and comfortable for our stay. Thank you so much. "
741699,28162475,2015-03-19,5113751,Sarah,"We had a wonderful stay at the zen retreat! Everything was clean and as described, in a great location near Seward Park. The kitchen was stocked with everything we needed for cooking our own meals. "
741699,28559622,2015-03-26,12655166,Marlene,"From the minute we knew were staying at the Zen Retreat, Matt made it seem like our well being was his first concern.  The house was exactly as he described....maybe better.  We were so comfortable and felt so much at home.  A sweet retreat!  Hope we can return!!!"
741699,28789521,2015-03-30,27120397,Jeanne,"We traveled to Seattle on girl's weekend to attend a concert and though not as close to the venue as hoped, this was a great place to stay....very ""zen.""  The furnishings and decor were nice and the overall feel very peaceful. We did not hear the downstairs tenant at all. The steam shower was a nice addition and so relaxing. It was a short walk to the Columbia City restaurants. We are very happy to have found this place and would definitely stay again if traveling to the area. Thank you Matt for everything!"
741699,29012598,2015-04-02,22738878,Christa,Matt gave us all the information we needed to feel right at home.  The neighbourhood was lovely and the home itself was exactly as pictured.  It was especially helpful to get a list of good restaurants nearby.  We enjoyed our trip to Seattle immensely and found that this was within a decent driving distance from downtown.  
741699,29605112,2015-04-10,26060689,Erin,"The Zen Retreat was a wonderful place to stay while in Seattle. The location was great for commuting to the city.  The beds were very comfortable, and the steam shower is so relaxing.  Everything was ready for us upon arrival and Matt checked in with us several times during the stay to ensure all was going well.  We especially appreciated being able to bring our dog - and the dog bed and food bowls provided were such a nice touch.  We would stay there again!"
741699,29839738,2015-04-13,22852941,Alan,Everything you would want. We were driving up from SF to Whistler and stayed overnight. A very tranquil and clean lodging. Matt was very informative with details of house rules which made staying less stressful.  Would highly recommend staying here.The local Italian restaurant was ok but had a very limited menu.
741699,30447919,2015-04-22,28066877,Corey,"The Zen Retreat is nothing short of amazing. We took full use of the well-equipped kitchen, steam shower, luxurious dining room, and spacious living area. The house was spotless and easy to keep clean. 
The quiet, tree-lined neighborhood is charming and close enough to downtown to accommodate us. 
Matt was quick to answer all our questions and put us in touch with a great resource for local music. "
741699,31162320,2015-05-03,25639249,Luc,"We had a wonderful time in Zen Retreat. Matt's home is just great, beautifully decorated, comfortable and really peaceful. The shower is really a plus. You have everything you need nearby from the PPC market to the lovely Seward Park which is worth a walk. Seattle downtown is easy to reach thru Rainier Ave in 15/20min. We would come here again anytime."
741699,31580236,2015-05-07,10022710,Jan,"Beautiful property in a great neighborhood.   Clean, light, airy, spacious.  Matt made it easy for us to rent the place and enjoy it."
741699,33069494,2015-05-25,15579463,Tina,We had a wonderful time. Nice clean house. Had everything we needed.
741699,33781123,2015-06-01,29202446,Stefan,"We stayed at Matt's apartment with 4 persons (30y, 40y, 64y, 70y) for 2 nights. We instantly felt home and would have stayed longer, but we planned otherwise. The area around the apartment is very nice and quiet, since it's on top of a hill with views to the water, where you can have a walk, go swimming or just hang out. The Seward Park is not far and it's great to spend time there for walking, sitting at the water while viewing at the Mount Rainier. Going downton is easy, the station is in walkable distance (we drove by car to the station and left the car there). Back to the home, there's a great shower, a very huge veranda, which seems perfect for hot and sunny days, since the trees block the sun from burning too hot. The rooms are like on the photos, clean and lovely if you like the style (we did). Everything was very uncomplicated. We can totally recommend it! If we come back to seattle one day, we would like to stay there again!"
741699,34309178,2015-06-07,12063686,Helen,Great place. Clean. Outdoor seating was perfect for dinner or glass of wine. Good location. Thanks for sharing your home. Would recommend it to anyone. 
741699,34618755,2015-06-10,84726,Lynn,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visit to the Zen Retreat.  It was so nice to come ""home"" after a busy day in Seattle to the comfort of a quiet neighborhood.  The home was very comfortable and had everything we needed for our stay.  Matt was a great communicator, especially when our trip got closer.  I would highly recommend staying in the Zen Retreat when staying in Seattle."
741699,34869340,2015-06-13,32232181,Kris,"Zen Retreat was a perfect home base for our first trip to Seattle. Matt's home is exactly as described and is even more beautiful in person. The neighborhood is very peaceful and is within a short drive/walk to coffee shops and restaurants. The location was convenient to everything we wanted to do and getting around was very easy.  Matt was available if we needed him and checked in via text. We would definitely stay at Zen Retreat again, especially to take advantage of that steam shower!"
741699,34939798,2015-06-14,602696,Emilie,Superbe maison au calme très design et très confortable pour un séjour à Seattle. A environ 30 minutes du centre ville très bien desservi. Matt s est rendu très disponible.  Nous y reviendrons avec plaisir.  Merci Matt
741699,35195509,2015-06-16,3380724,Inger,Matt's Zen Retreat is even lovelier than you see in the pictures. It was so comfortable and had every amenity. His instructions were clearly laid out for everything from wifi and the steam shower to neighborhood attractions. His decor is tasteful and the beds are super comfy. Even the landscaping is a dream. We'll definitely be back!
741699,35482173,2015-06-19,15788835,Janet,"Matt was very thorough and accommodating, providing all the info/help one could want. The house is sensational, with very appealing Japanese influence in furnishings and spatial arrangements, a wonderful array of light-filled rooms and outdoor deck, and a knock-out skylight in the bathroom. All the necessary kitchen equipment and tools are provided for an easy, fuss-free visit. I'm sorry we couldn't stay longer."
741699,35632094,2015-06-21,26484421,Scott,"A great Seattle home in an excellent location. Matt made everything really easy, from booking to arrival to checkout. His house is very nice, in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to everything you need. Hope to return!"
741699,35800621,2015-06-22,929429,Nick,"This place is a treasure. Beautiful house in a pleasant location. Far enough away from the hustle and bustle, but close in to Columbia City and Seattle. I whole heartedly recommend this spot. "
741699,35903594,2015-06-23,3380724,Inger,My second stay was just as lovely as the first! Love this place and always sleep so well there! Thanks Matt!
741699,36179425,2015-06-26,31433502,Tsung Ping,"We enjoyed a great few days staying in Matt's house, the shower is Amazing ! love it!"
741699,36867127,2015-07-02,32015288,Deborah,Thank you Matt! Our family had a wonderful time and felt so welcome in your beautiful home. Check in was easy and any questions were answered promptly. Your home had everything we needed and we felt relaxed and at home staying there. We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in Seattle.
741699,45762352,2015-09-06,6459001,Rebecca,"We had a fabulous stay at this lovely home.  The house was wonderful in many ways: extremely comfortable, fully equipped, pleasantly decorated, upkeep inside and out was spotless, and situated with a great location.  We stayed for over 2 months so this was important for us.  There is a private back upper patio surrounded by trees. The large beautful windows all over the house look out at beautiful trees.  We felt like we were in a tree house.  Very peaceful.  The landlord Matt was very accessible if we ever needed anything, extremely helpful, professional, and likable.  This stay exceeded our expectations.  We like walking, so being able to walk to charming Columbia City was great. We also walked around Seward Park, and along Lake Washington from the house.    To sum it up, we had a wonderful stay.  "
741699,47450308,2015-09-18,8979527,Vince,"Great experience all around with Matt's place. We were stuck late in the day with hotels full in and around the city. He responded quickly to our request with detailed instructions. The property was clean, welcoming, and just as described, with additional instructions placed prominently. We were able to jog through a nearby park in the morning. Highly recommended!"
741699,48087283,2015-09-23,10785336,Jeffrey,"Seward park zen retreat is awesome, my family had a great time during three-day staying at there, which is 15 mins driving to downtown, and 5 mins walk to the lake. I would definitely recommend thos place. "
741699,48711188,2015-09-28,39565316,Peter,"This is my first airbnb experience and my first stay in this country. Very fortunately, I found Matt and had a wonderful stay in this retreat. 
    The house is in a quiet environment and barely no vhiecles pass by and therefore no city noise. I really appriciate the tranquility the house brings to me at night. The house is also well decorated with a lot of artistic elements. Spacious rooms and living room. Great bed especially a king bed provided. Shopping and dinning is convenient with a few minutes drive.Squirrels are frequnt guests around. Everything is pefect.
    One thing that might be a small problem is that planes fly over Columbia city after take off from Tacoma and give out some noise.Situations are much better at nights and you will not be disturbed by the noise when you shut the windows of the bedroom.
    Highly recommended."
741699,49230319,2015-10-02,206203,Amanda,"I love the Zen Retreat and retreat there whenever it is available on my frequent trips to Seattle. It is comfortable, quiet, relaxing and in a great eclectic neighborhood.  I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb homes in Seattle and this is one of my favorites."
741699,49575199,2015-10-04,39306977,Mike,"The Zen House is wonderful.  Great location, super comfortable beds, clean, and peaceful.  Matt makes it easy to stay there and his home makes it hard to leave."
741699,50067254,2015-10-09,188316,Christine,"Towels were out and fresh, there was a nice bottle of perrier on beds, he was so quick on replies and he just had a real casual feel considering his place is in Seattle. We had our concert that night and the location was super close to all amenities, he listed easy access places."
741699,50994934,2015-10-16,18121805,Sara,"Matt's place was a complete dream. The house is even more comfortable and peaceful than the pictures - it's like your friend's house that you wish you lived in yourself. The back porch makes it feel like a treehouse; the neighborhood is so cool and just a short walk down to the lake. Matt was really informative and in touch, though I didn't need a thing. He's thought of everything and I can easily say this is my favorite Airbnb listing I've stayed in thus far. Thank you so much Matt!"
741699,51410095,2015-10-19,46639265,Marc,"Everything was great! Matt was punctual regarding communication, and we found the keyless entry to be very convenient. The home was as described, and while we didn't have a chance to spend a ton of time there, it was a great value when compared to other traditional lodging. The home was clean and nicely decorated, with a clutterless feel to it. 

For travel, current Uber pricing for 4 adults was roughly $15 each way, to and from Downtown, on a Saturday with a premium rate @ 1.4x

Thanks Matt!"
741699,51658049,2015-10-22,16017049,Kathy,Amazing and I will be back!!  Thank you soooo much!
741699,51827440,2015-10-24,41581945,Kirsten,Matt was a great host! The entry process was very convenient and my guests really enjoyed their stay. 
741699,52103382,2015-10-26,9730719,Jessica,"I can't say enough good things about the Steward Park Zen Retreat, I would stay there again in a heartbeat.  Matt was a very gracious and responsive host.
Matt's home was incredibly aesthetically pleasing and architecturally beautiful. It was clean and welcoming.  I felt pampered and luxurious staying there.
The neighborhood is quiet and residential, close to public transportation and commercial areas."
9386179,55074939,2015-11-27,9878707,Emma,"Short, but great stay in this studio apartment. We really enjoyed the space and the privacy and found it was an excellent location with great proximity to lots of cool areas! Definitely would stay here again!"
9386179,56135456,2015-12-09,9232003,Danielle,Eric was very responsive and accommodating. The room was decorated well and had all of the necessities for a comfortable short stay. Be aware that this is a micro-unit best used for sleeping and readying for activities in the city.
9386179,56626087,2015-12-15,17005690,Kim,"Eric makes Airbnb incredibly easy.
From having my room ready for an early arrival, providing snacks, to the ease of access of getting into the buildin;. I couldn't ask for more.
"
9386179,56828470,2015-12-18,48001546,Gianna,"Gorgeous microstudio with easy access, we felt very welcome!"
9386179,57068762,2015-12-21,13506352,Connie,"The unit is in a very good location, very convenient on Capitol Hill. It is  small, being a micro studio, but we knew this from the description. The unit is comfortable as a place to sleep, and there is easy access to the 'communal' spaces in the building (kitchen, lounge-type area). Although the weather wasn't conducive during our stay, the view from the roof area is fantastic and would be a great place to spend time on a nice day. Parking is a little challenging, most areas require permits, with non permits allowed for 2 hours only. However, we were able to find parking a few blocks away. It was pretty quite, this unit faces away from the street so there wasn't noticeable street noise. We did not meet Eric, he was responsive to our questions in a timely fashion."
9386179,57329234,2015-12-24,50847868,Tim,"We have family in the neighborhood so the location was perfect for us.
Clean and quiet.
Easy entry via excellent communication from owner.
No elevator in building so travel light."
757840,2860596,2012-11-11,1461818,Jeff,Becky's house was really beautiful in a great neighborhood! We really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Becky.
757840,2880977,2012-11-13,719741,Kyle & Dot,Great place! Awesome location. 15 minute bus ride to Pike Place Market and downtown Seattle. Had a blast! Only wished we could've stayed longer. Nothing like having a getaway with lots of room to relax and have all the comforts of home. 
757840,2952715,2012-11-24,2713757,Pam,Loved staying at Becky's Bungalow. Beautiful home in a great walkable location. Loved the kitchen and dining room. The dining room table was big enough for boardgames and dinner setting. We highly recommend a stay. 
757840,2960989,2012-11-25,4160587,Kelly,Becky's house is absolutely beautiful. Clean and warm and very comfortable. I basically wanted to move in.
757840,3208689,2013-01-01,4196464,Phoebe,"This house has it all.  The photos tell the story of a charming, warm and spacious house, but what you don’t see is what really makes this an amazing spot.  To start, the location is phenomenal.  It is one block from the main street of a neighborhood stocked to the gills with great restaurants, both food and retail shopping, and coffee houses.  It’s also one block from a bus stop, which is handy if your party wants to go in separate directions and only has one car to share.  Even though the house is centrally located, it is peaceful and quiet.  The house itself has been completely updated - heated bathroom floor and professional grade range for example, while retaining all the charm and detail of an older home.  The owner is meticulous and thoughtful, which translates to a very clean and well-stocked home, but not one that is cluttered with the remains previous guests or overly personalized with the owners’ belongings.  I loved the artwork and furnishings, and everything was well-placed and comfortable.  In the bedrooms the mattresses and sheets were wonderful, and the closets were gargantuan.  Little touches like luggage racks were thoughtful additions.  The owner was immediately helpful with anything from a sticky lock (she was over in five minutes) to restaurant recommendations.  She clearly has house pride, but doesn’t impose the care of her house on her guests, only asks that they are respectful.  

Our family ended up spending more time at “home” than we did sightseeing because the house was such a pleasant respite.   Thank you Becky, we’ll see you again!
"
757840,3343733,2013-01-14,3984305,Cynthia,"Becky's home is lovely and we enjoyed our stay there very much.  Becky baked muffins for us and provided lots of coffee, tea, cream and fruit.  And the heated bathroom upstairs was fabulous as it was cold outside!  The neighborhood is filled with beautiful older homes and is close to restaurants and shops, including a TJ's."
757840,3727202,2013-03-09,4453872,Sascha,"The home is very nice indeed at first sight.
The owner however, is the most anal person we have ever encountered.
There are signs all over the place telling you what you may do but mostly what you may not do. There are fuzzy carpets and rugs all over the place which results in fuzz being blown around the whole place throught the gas-forced air heating systems. We were constantly sneezing and had watery eyes from it. Overall it felt very uncomfortable. The owner showed up to get ""stuff"" here and there which is totally not cool at all. We felt watched and scrutinized.
For the price we paid we should have better stayed in an upscale hotel.
Not recommended at all !"
757840,3860669,2013-03-22,3932705,Lee,My girlfriends and I just loved Becky's home! It was comfortable and spacious and in a very convenient and lovely neighborhood! We would definitely recommend renting from Becky. 
757840,3889798,2013-03-25,1610262,Betsy,"This placed has completely set a new bar for my family travel. I fear nothing can compete with the perfection of this home. My 16 year old, who lives on the HGTV literally started crying in joy after we arrived. It was her dream home; beautifully decorated throughout the entire home in a simplistic manor that was both functional and elegant. I cannot say enough about the comfortable beds, but my kids woke up and literally just stayed in bed for about 1 hour in the comfort. The kitchen was my haven. We saved hundreds by cooking and enjoying the beautiful dining room. Becky was very thoughtful in making recommendations of places to eat and shop and things to do. She is possibly the most organized person I have ever met with a system in the home that makes it easy to move into. Fun neighborhood to take walks in and close to everything. Extremely expressive and I can't wait to return!"
757840,3947187,2013-03-30,1230805,Susan,"I will cut to chase...so you do not have to read my whole review... this place was perfect!  Who: Family with two teenage boys.(We are a frequent apartment/home renters when we travel both here in the states and abroad and have plenty of places to compare this one to.) Where: Lovingly, exceptionally well -maintained, clean, tastefully decorated Queen Anne home in Seattle. This home  is well-supplied and spacious. The neighborhood is a hipster's/yuppies' delight full of trendy shops, grocery stores, Le Reve patisserie, etc. all with in easy walking distance. We left the  car in the driveway and took the bus to Pike's Place and beyond each day, no parking hassles. When: Stayed 5 days at the end of March. How: The home owner's manual was short, sweet and helpful. It told us how things worked, what the few rules were and gave a brief run down of the neighborhood.
I almost hate to post about this place-I want to keep it for myself.
Besides being very clean, having plenty of nice towels and hot water, it was not cluttered with personal effects. We had lots of room to spread out. We will be back! The host is great!"
757840,4513866,2013-05-10,4510738,Catherine,"This home was perfect for my colleagues and I to stay in while attending a conference at the Washington State Convention Center. The location was excellent. The neighborhood is gorgeous. The house is on a peaceful street from which you can catch stunning views of the mountains on the Olympic Peninsula, yet only a block away from  restaurants and shops. It was a quick and straightforward drive from the house to the convention center (located at Pike and 7th). The weather was good, so a few of us occasionally walked the 2.2 miles. It's a pleasant walk. 
The house was delightful! It was spotlessly clean, well kept, and attractively decorated. The kitchen was very well equipped, and It was great to find things like coffee, tea, sugar, and various spices and condiments in the kitchen.
It was fantastic value compared with all of us staying separately in hotels, and far more comfortable.

757840,4646508,2013-05-18,5345267,Susanne,"Wir haben zu fünft das komfortable Haus mitten im schönen Queen Anne-Bezirk gemietet und waren begeistert. Es ist mit allem ausgestattet, vom Nützlichen  wie alle Küchengeräte oder Waschmaschine bishin zu Extras wie Kamin, zwei Bäder plus Gästetoilette oder einem superschönen grossen Holzesstisch, es hat uns an nichts gemangelt, was wir vermisst hätten. Es war sauber, modern eingerichtet und für unsere Ausflüge ideal gelegen. Becky hat zusätzlich eine Hausmappe mit allerlei nützlichen Informationen zu Autostrecken, Aussichtspunkten, Restaurants, Cafés etc. zusammengestellt, wir haben uns sofort gut aufgehoben gefühlt und empfehlen sehr gern jedem dieses wunderschöne Haus weiter. Denn auch bei nicht so unüblichen Regentagen in Seattle bietet das Haus genügend Freiraum zum Relaxen und "" Wohnen""."
757840,4910263,2013-06-01,85631,Omair,"Great house, great location, proximity to a lively strip of restaurants and cafés. A brisk walk places you in one of a few parks that boast sweeping views of downtown Seattle and the Puget Sound, with several groceries within several blocks of the house as well.  Queen Anne is a very cozy neighborhood, and centrally located, with easy access to neighboring parts of the city via SR99 and I-5. Becky's house was very neat and clean. It was fully stocked with all the amenities from home. Comfortable for my family of four, though the house can very comfortably accommodate up to six.  She is very thoughtful in her provisions, offering a selection of coffee and teas in addition to a self edited program guide of noteworthy eats and sights around Queen Anne.  If returning to Seattle with family or friends I will definitely consider this house again before seeking alternative accommodations.

757840,5032878,2013-06-09,5176506,George,"Becky's home was just a delightful place to stay at. My mother-in-law and wife just loved the older style home.  The Queen Anne location was beautiful and very safe. We were able to walk to the market, restaurants and parks,even after dark. The public transportation was just a block away to get to downtown. Becky's guide and suggestions to the city was just perfect. We also had some help from our nephew, who has lived in Seattle for about 10 years, on where to go and see. We were spoiled with the ""GREAT WEATHER"" the week we visited and this made the trip more memorable. But our stay at the Queen Anne House will always be  mention in our stories about the Seattle trip.  Hope to come back again to see more and stay at Becky's Home.  June 2013

757840,5143620,2013-06-15,1885354,Bill,"Beautiful place.  Great kitchen.  Very comfortable.  Incredible location.  Becky is great, to boot!  Can't go wrong."
757840,5204417,2013-06-18,3720647,Deborah,"The house is perfect... pottery barn meets crate and barrel in it's aesthetic , but then personalized with wonderful unique photographs, by the talented owner who created this warm, welcoming space. We loved it!"
757840,5244453,2013-06-20,6248460,Biel,"Casa: perfecta en todos sus detalles. Limpia y ordenada. Con todas las comodidades desde lo básico (2 baños, 3 dormitorios, armarios y cajoneras abundantes, cocina con todos los utensilios, lavadora, secadora, lavavajillas...) hasta detalles de calidad como tv con home-cinema, dvd, equipo de música, etc. El jardín delantero cuidadísimo, y un pequeño jardín interior con barbacoa. Sitio para aparcar al lado de la casa. (La casa esta dedicada al alquiler, no parece que vivan en ella pues todos los armarios están a disposición del huésped. Solo en el subterráneo, donde están la lavadora y secadora, la dueña tiene almacenados sus enseres)

Vecindario: muy tranquilo y agradable. Casas unifamiliares con jardín. Muy cerca de una calle con restaurantes y tiendas de comestibles. Esta a un paseo del Space Needle, solo que, al estar en una colina, el regreso a casa es bastante empinado.

Información: la información proporcionada en el 'manual' de la casa es muy detallada y precisa, tanto en referencia a la propia casa (funcionamiento de los electrodomésticos, normas, etc) como al vecindario y a los restaurantes o tiendas cercanas.

Una autentica delicia."
757840,5306338,2013-06-24,261133,Lawrence,"Becky Robert's home in the Queen Anne area  was absolutely lovely, very spacious and beautiful, and extremely comfortable.  We thoroughly enjoyed every minute there and loved its charm blending old and new architecture and interior design and quaintness.  All amenities in the bathrooms including shampoo, conditioner and body wash and soap were provided.  Coffee and tea too!  Our delegation stayed 5 days and 4 nights from June (phone number hidden) as we were getting on a cruise to Alaska.  If there is one thing I can say about her home, you'll also enjoy every part of her home and all its beauty.  An unforgettable experience!"
757840,5447600,2013-07-01,5068015,John,We enjoyed this home very much!  Becky was prompt with all responses and has done a great job with making this a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay.  Great location!
757840,5506171,2013-07-03,1773159,Robert,"This place is absolutely fabulous and Becky is a perfect host
The location is amazing...so close and accessible to everything.
There were 5 of us staying for a couple of days and the beds were beautiful and the house spotlessly clean
Becky's little tips for places to eat we're very helpful and the little Queen Anne village very quaint
I would totally recommend this place...you can't go wrong !!!!!"
757840,5597341,2013-07-08,4308924,Miko,"Wonderful house, great host, good location - we loved it !!!"
757840,5902201,2013-07-22,129828,Leonor,"We rented Becky's lovely house as a place for us and a few others to stay during our wedding, and to use as a central gathering place for family and friends. We couldn't be happier. The home is beautiful and very well cared for, not to mention well appointed. The soothing colors and airy spaces provided a beautiful backdrop for many photos, and the large open spaces were perfect for socializing. Becky was also a wonderful host - very laid back and easy going, but also responsive when necessary. I would highly recommend this listing!"
757840,6145337,2013-08-01,4792175,Randy,We have rented lots of places in the US.  Becky's home was one of the cleanest and most beautifully decorated that we have chosen.  Spacious and comfortable and with little touches that really made our stay fabulous.  Highly recommend.   
757840,6414310,2013-08-12,4633306,C,"This Queen Anne hilltop home was wonderful!  The rooms were spacious, color scheme elegant and furnishings comfortable.  Its location was perfect so that we could get into the city without delays.  and coffee shops and restaurants were just a flight of stairs away.  Our group was large but we never tripped over ourselves as we all settled in.  This home was perfect for our vacation!  Thank you, Becky!"
757840,7004348,2013-09-03,4808492,Cindy,"Becky's house was absolutely perfect! Becky is responsive and met us upon our arrival to go over any questions we had. We were a group of 5 and there was plenty of room for us to sleep, eat, watch tv, and be together. The location is convenient to shopping and restaurants with easy access to the highways for traveling to other parts of the city. We really enjoyed our stay in Queen Anne and in this beautiful, immaculate home. You won't be disappointed!!"
757840,7651487,2013-09-28,1255936,James David,"We were in Seattle for a business conference and Becky's gorgeous house was a fantastic alternative to a sterile hotel. The house was spotless, beautiful, well-stocked, and comfortable. The check-in was easy--Becky met us at the house and gave us all the necessary information quickly. The neighborhood is great--has a very peaceful and residential feel, but a quick walk down the steps at the end of the street and we were surrounded by restaurants, shops, and a grocery store. 5 Spot was a great place for dinner, and public transportation was easy and efficient. Could not recommend this place enough!"
757840,7741112,2013-10-01,7915123,Eileen,"Becky's house was just perfect for our mini womens' reunion.  It's roomy, comfortable, nicely updated, and well supplied.  The house is in a great neighborhood for walking, close to local shops and restaurants and to downtown.  The driveway that fits 2 cars was convenient, as parking close by was hit or miss.  We spent a lot of time at the large dining room table or lounging on the sofas while the weekend storm raged.  "
757840,8152490,2013-10-18,948757,Linda,This house was truly a gem!   Everything was neat and clean and ready for our arrival. The house rules and directions were easy to understand. The upstairs bedrooms and bathrooms were very convenient for a house-share.  And the price was unbeatable!    Becky's house is HIGHLY recommended. 
757840,8255403,2013-10-22,8740252,Cynthia,"The house is lovely--very clean, beautifully maintained, and with a fireplace. Becky is a great host; she was at the house when we arrived a bit early, told me where things could be found, and that she was only minutes away if we had other needs or questions. (We didn't until I arrived back home and realized that I had lost one of my earrings, which Becky found and returned by mail.:-)) The home is in a very nice neighborhood--residential, but close to shops and restaurants. Six of us stayed at the Galer St. house for a 4-day family visit, and all of us found it perfect for our needs. We will definitely try to stay there again when we return to Seattle!"
757840,13464552,2014-05-28,10612969,David,"Becky's house is fantastic.  Four of us stayed there and we all loved the house which is full of style and character. We found the house to have plenty of room as well as an abundance of amenities.

The location worked very well for us. It is up a steep hill (so you have to be prepared to walk or get a bus to the city) and is a pretty, wealthy, inner city suburb. Great views of Seattle!

Becky was very easy to deal with. Responsive, considerate and flexible."
757840,13844252,2014-06-06,13196952,Heather,"This house was amazing. Perfect fit for our group of six adults! Becky left great information about the area and honestly I am not sure you could find a better location! We loved the neighborhood and hiked down the hill to the needle. The way back up was a bit of a trip....it's a serious hill.
Only downside was lack of laundry in house. I would stay here every time I come back to Seattle!"
757840,14014712,2014-06-10,4914063,Theresa,"Beautiful house, gracious host and a great location!  Highly recommended."
757840,14547790,2014-06-22,6354465,Jennifer,"This Queen Anne home is very lovely, clean and comfortable.  The kitchen and bathrooms are updated and modern. We enjoyed the neighborhood with a school/playground just a block away, and many shops and restaurants a few minutes drive away. Guests should know there is a washer and dryer in the basement but we were told we were not allowed to use it.  The owner made an unannounced appearance to harvest fruit trees, which happened to be ill-timed on our end. Overall, I would recommend this home to others."
757840,14744891,2014-06-25,10554335,Denis,Becky's house at the top of Queen Anne hill is just fantastic! We just wanted to move in. There is a ton of space and the decor is very nice. Our bed was extremely comfortable. Queen Anne is wonderful neighborhood to walk around in and it is a short (and steep) walk down the hill to Seattle Center and downtown points beyond. We would definitely stay here again!
757840,15300785,2014-07-07,9816962,Jennifer,"This is an excellent place to stay in Seattle! The home is as pictured, with a beautiful view. Becky is a great host as well. My only recommendation if staying here would be to consider getting a rental car, unless you do not mind walking several steep hills. Great stay! "
757840,16291355,2014-07-25,14247734,Richard,Becky was an exceptional host.  She kept us informed through each step and was there to greet us when we arrived.  The house was exactly what we had hoped for.  It was very clean and we had everything we needed.  The neighborhood was perfect.  We were only 2 blocks away from restaurants in a very nice area.  All attractions in town were only minutes away.  We highly recommend both this listing and our host.
757840,16538118,2014-07-29,4233841,Nancy,"Corresponding with Becky was very easy, as she was prompt with responses.  The house was exactly what we were anticipating, thanks to Becky's descriptions and past reviewers.  It was clean, well-furnished, and located in a fantastic location.  We really appreciated the parking spot too having a car.  Becky met us at the house and gave us a tour, but the binder at the house had all the pertinent info.  The house had ample space for 4 adults.  We had a terrific stay!"
757840,17261356,2014-08-10,12650590,Teresa,"The location of this beautiful house is perfect.  You are steps away from strolling the quaint street of Queen Anne Ave.  On Thursday the whole family walked down to the Farmer's Market and enjoyed shopping and dining from the fabulous food trucks.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  Becky is so welcoming and friendly, and answered my texts/calls very promptly.  The house is well appointed, clean, and in a fantastic neighborhood.  If you walk down the street to the right a little, your surprise is an incredible unobstructed view of the Needle, Downtown, and the Sound beyond...it is quite a sight at night."
757840,17812942,2014-08-18,5326222,Joy,"This beautiful home was just as described - very clean, nicely furnished and in a great neighborhood.  Cleanliness in a rental house is very important to me and this did not disappoint. Walking distance to Safeway and Trader Joe's as well as drug store,  shops and restaurants. Central location yet a quiet street.

Five of us stayed here for our son's Seattle wedding. It was such a comfortable place to come home to after all of the events of the week. I really wasn't ready to leave. Would have liked to stay here another day after the wedding festivities were over just to relax. "
757840,18108836,2014-08-22,11225819,Holly,"The host provided a helpful overview packet about the neighborhood, local transit options, etc. The house was very true to the posting. The neighborhood was even better than expected! A short walk to great restaurants, coffee shops and city views, and an easy drive to all the neighborhoods we wanted to visit, including downtown. Can't imagine a better location. "
757840,18393162,2014-08-26,1597666,Cheryl,Hilltop house was perfect for our party of 6. Plenty of room and the kitchen was very well equipped.  Our last night at the house was spent creating a dinner that was out of this world with all ingredients coming from local sources.  The neighborhood is wonderful and it is convenient if you have your own car or must use public transportation. 
757840,18550384,2014-08-28,18610520,Kate,Beautiful home in a fantastic area of Seattle. The location was just off the main 'neighborhood street' for Queen Anne making it just a few minutes walk to just great shops and restaurants. 
757840,18938990,2014-09-03,16175914,Lisa,"Becky is a perfect host.  I texted with her as we were leaving the airport for Seattle, and she was waiting when we arrived with kind words and a genuine interest in seeing that we would enjoy the house and the city.  She was very laid back.  The house is immaculately clean and very updated and  CHARMING.  Her house manual is very helpful with tips on the city and nearby restaurants as well as household info.  The house is walking distance from lots of charming bars, restaurants and shops on Queen Anne Drive."
757840,19190894,2014-09-08,16259441,Rebecca,We LOVED this house. I rented two houses in Queen Anne for my family to stay in for my youngest sister's wedding. This house was large enough that my family members staying in the other house were able to come over and we could all comfortably hang out. The house is close to all the fun things you want to do in Queen Anne. We were also easily able to get to the rehearsal dinner on a Lake Washington dinner cruise and the wedding on Mercer Island. Great location and great house!
757840,19880515,2014-09-20,19739448,Elizabeth,"We had an amazing time in the Hilltop House. The home was spacious and beautifully furnished. We loved the front porch. The neighborhood was fantastic. We did lots of walking around. It was nice to have a driveway to park our car in. It was a great landing point for many Seattle adventures. I would highly recommend the place and, personally, I hope it goes up for sale because we would buy it in an instant! The only thing that could make this home more perfect was a backyard, but it did have a small side yard with a grill."
757840,20079580,2014-09-23,1657702,Stephanie,"Hilltop House was a great space for our group of four. We enjoyed lounging in the family room area in the evenings, a bonus over the usual segregation of separate hotel rooms. The neighborhood is adorable, and there are lots of dining options within a short walk down along Queen Anne. Top Pot doughnuts was a favorite for breakfast. The house was well stocked with amenities four our stay. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends."
757840,20892964,2014-10-07,2161389,Erica,"I booked the Hilltop House for family visiting Seattle for my wedding in October. The house was perfect and exactly as shown in photos (not always the case on Airbnb!) We had a few family dinners while everyone was in town and the large dining room table fit all of us with room to spare. 

The location of the house is also great. It is on the top of Queen Anne so I wouldn't plan on walking to and from downtown, but there is a bus right around the corner and it's never an issue to get a cab or Uber. The neighborhood is lovely - lots of great food, coffee and cute shops. 

Becky is also a very nice and accommodating host. She met us on the day we checked in, showed us around the house and left us with a big book of Seattle information (how to get downtown, good places to eat nearby, etc) which was super helpful. 

Highly recommend this property! "
757840,21278623,2014-10-14,10967168,Cynthia,"We had an amazing stay.  Becky was fast at responding to any questions leading up to our stay, and made it very easy to check-in, considering we were all arriving at different times and we couldn't confirm our check-in time until closer to the date.
The house itself was very cosy, and had more amenities than we expected in terms of things provided such as coffee, shampoo, laundry supplies, etc - it was wanting for nothing and was perfect for our family (3 couples - all coming from different places) to meet up and relax.
It was also in an amazing location - so close to shops and restaurants in the Queen Anne neighbourhood - and we definitely took note of some of the places Becky suggested in the house manual.  Also very close to public transport to get into the downtown area with ease.
I would definitely recommend staying here and would most certainly stay here again the next time I am in Seattle."
757840,21579354,2014-10-20,18891448,Caroline,"This was our first Airbnb experience and I have to admit I was a little hesitant.  Becky's friendly greeting  relieved any fears I may have had.  She suggested places to eat and made sure I knew she was available should we have any questions.  The house was better than we anticipated: clean, wonderfully furnished, comfortable, inviting and in a fantastic location.  It was the perfect place to relax and re-group after a long day.  The only way our vacation could have been any better would be if we had more time in Seattle!"
757840,22369671,2014-11-04,22169683,Lalanya,We loved this house! Somehow it was even better than the beautiful photos and description. An incredible home in an amazing neighborhood. Everything was spotless and inviting. Becky was so sweet. She has thought of everything! From the extra throws in the front closet to the incredibly stocked kitchen. We loved cooking and eating here more than going out. The wood burning fire place was so so wonderful. A short walk to all the upper Queen Anne businesses and so many lovely neighborhood blocks to stroll on. 
757840,25966010,2015-01-31,25693927,Chris,A great first Airbnb experience. Great communication from Becky and a friendly welcome. The house was larger than expected and spotlessly clean. Excellent location with great spots for breakfast on Queen Anne Avenue within 2 mins walk and Trader Joe's and Safeway just a little further. Highly recommended.
757840,26097762,2015-02-03,20810435,Emily,"Becky was a wonderful host and the house was absolutely lovely. The location was perfect -- queen anne is beautiful and super convenient. I didn't get a chance to try the public transportation (bus option for a quick trip downtown) but the drive to downtown attractions was super quick. Kerry park (one of the main lookout/photo spots in Seattle) is a 5 minute walk from the house.

The house was spotless yet welcoming -- my group had 5 adults and we had plenty of space (could have easily had another person at least). We were out and about in Seattle during the daytime and then came back to the house to cook 'family style' dinners. There is a safeway and trader joes just down the street and the house has a spacious kitchen and dining area. There are plenty of cafes nearby if you're not looking to cook.

We got the chance to meet Becky and she was very friendly and gave a lot of helpful tips about the area. 

In general we had an entirely positive stay at Hilltop House and I would absolutely stay again if I am back in Seattle in the future."
757840,26737239,2015-02-18,5387309,Ellen & Bob,"The Hilltop House exceeded our expectations. Becky greeted us when we arrived - late due to a flight delay - and gave us a quick intro to the house. Anything else we needed to know, including local restaurant reviews by Becky with maps to each spot, was in the very specific home binder. The house was immaculate. The furnishing, bedding, towels, etc. were all high quality and very comfortable. And the location was fabulous - just a short walk to restaurants (the 5-Spot for breakfast was fabulous), coffee shops, and Trader Joes. We highly recommend the Hilltop House."
757840,27195667,2015-02-28,7108007,Rosemary,"The Hilltop House was an amazing find!! Great location in the Queen Anne neighborhood. We traveled to Seattle for a week with our two young children, and we were easily able to child-proof the house. The house is well-appointed with recently updated appliances. Becky was incredibly accommodating and helpful. There were several little things we appreciated like having the kitchen stocked with coffee and some basics for cooking. Parking in the driveway was a breeze. I think for the price it was exceptional. "
757840,27369853,2015-03-02,1190698,Christy,"Can we move in?!? The house is absolutely beautiful, with thoughtful updating and modern amenities. Our family couldn't have been more comfortable, and the location is truly world class - central enough to enjoy easy access to outlying neighborhoods and within walking distance to all the restaurant gems, groceries, and boutique shopping on Queen Ann Hill. We look forward to our next trip and hope we have more time to stay in you Hilltop House then, Becky! Thanks for being a great host and accommodating our last minute request for a booking. Your Airbnb made our trip!!"
757840,27723227,2015-03-10,14903340,Jack,"Host was super responsive and easy going. The neighborhood was quiet and walkable with about a 10 minute drive to everything we needed. There was a fabulous book of tips with some amazing coffee shops and neighborhood highlights. There's a wonderful little staircase that leads to Queen Ann's bounty of restaurants, boutiques and coffee houses. 

The house was super well appointed. The kitchen had everything we needed including some of the little things like salt, pepper, sugar and a starter coffee pack. Loved that the towels, bath mats and shower all matched. Beds all amazing and in good condition. Highly recommend Hilltop House."
757840,27965888,2015-03-15,9219090,Tian,the house was so nice that u can get the whole view of the city and Becky was such nice host that provide with everything we needed.
757840,28462682,2015-03-24,25101522,Jennifer,"The listing was very accurate. The home was immaculate and spacious for our group of 5 people. The neighborhood was great, it felt comfortable to come back to each evening during our stay in Seattle. I couldn't get over how lovely the flowers in the neighborhood were. Walks around the block were very fun. We have two small children, so I especially appreciated having a washer and dryer in the basement! My only negative comment is that the home is older and so the walls are paper thin, which we just weren't used to. One peep out of one of my kids at night and the whole household was woken up. "
757840,28776839,2015-03-30,674915,Lauren,The house was beautiful and perfect for our needs. Becky was there when we arrived and was readily available to answer any questions we had during our stay. We had 6 team members in town for a professional conference and we all fit comfortably. Amenities both in the house and the area we beyond our expectations. Stay at the Hilltop House! You won't regret it!
757840,29719771,2015-04-12,3363520,Kristi,"Our family had the perfect stay at Hilltop House and Becky was a great Host. We love Queen Anne and this location was the best. Took walks to Kerry Park and to the restaurants on Queen Anne. Beautiful neighborhood and super location to get anywhere in the City. We took UBER to and from Safeco Field. I wish I knew about this place when our son was attending Seattle Pacific University. Thank you Becky for thinking of everything and providing us with a such a lovely beautiful home for our family.

 Becky was so encouraging to me in my adventure into being an Airbnb Host. Now I can say I have been a Guest and a Host."
757840,29966495,2015-04-15,6687021,Kara,We had a terrific stay! The house was perfect for our group of 5. Becky was great with communication and checking in was extremely easy. The house was better than the pictures and the neighborhood was to die for. Walking distance from the main strip in Queen Anne and great views.  The street was beautiful and quiet. Each bedroom was a good size with plenty of storage. The house was extremely clean and very comfortable. I would recommend the Hilltop house to anyone and I would stay here again in a second. 
757840,30381181,2015-04-21,27058114,Richard,We had a great stay and enjoyed the house very much.  Our host had everything prepared for us and plenty of great ideas and suggestions for us to use on our trip!  I would highly recommend this house to others!  it was beautifully decorated and had all the amenities we needed.  The welcome book provided had EVERYTHING anyone would need to make the best of their stay.
757840,32115235,2015-05-14,30078047,Melinda,"We had a great stay in Becky's house.   It was clean, in a great location and true to the photographs.   We would stay there again in a heartbeat. "
757840,32494649,2015-05-19,20625714,Sophie,"We had a great time at Becky's magnificent house! It's very roomy, well equiped and perfectly located. We had a good time walking along Queen Anne St. and loved the neighbourhood. Becky has excellent recommendations in her home guide and overall we had a perfect first Airbnb experience :) We'd gladly recommend the Hilltop House to anyone visiting Seattle."
757840,32828433,2015-05-22,744603,Mengci,"Great location, beautiful house, and nice host!  We didn't rent a car during our stay, Uber is enough.  The house is conveniently located and we can get a Uber in less than 10 minutes.  The house is clean and beautifully decorated.  We found everything we needed.  Host is nice although we did not get to meet in person. Communication was super easy and effective.  Highly recommend!  "
757840,33072826,2015-05-25,19965071,Helen,"Fantastic clean, stylish home in an amazing neighborhood. Walking distance from my favorite French bakery, La Reve, and other awesome eateries. Highly recommend. "
757840,33372512,2015-05-27,10992761,Farideh,"What a wonderful location, house and experience. We were pleasantly surprised with a gorgeous garden in addition to the lovely home. We had a short stay of 2 nights but could not have been more pleased with the house and our host. Would definitely stay again!"
757840,33907266,2015-06-02,28062669,Geoffrey,"The house was perfect.  It's well situated in one Seattle's best neighborhoods and incredible care has been taken to make the house welcoming, comfortable and relaxing.  You can't ask for a better airbnb experience; can't offer a stronger recommendation. "
757840,34117737,2015-06-05,2859275,Ellie,My coworkers and I loved staying un this house!  So close to a great little neighborhood and downtown all at once!  Everything was as described and very clean.  I'll stay here again!
757840,34851179,2015-06-13,29455803,Cheri,"This was our first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better. Hilltop House, high atop Queen Anne in Seattle, is an incredibly comfortable, clean, and handsome home. It's spacious yet intimate, simple yet elegant, private yet in close proximity to Queen Anne's retail and shopping amenities. Ample room for up to six guests, an outdoor patio with romantic lights, and laundry services in the basement. It's very apparent why our host, Becky, is so highly rated on the airbnb application. Decorations were minimal but tasteful, the garden was loved and well-kept (two petit cherry trees brimming with ripening fruit!), the house was spotless and there were very clear instructions about everything from garbage sorting to how to request the addition of special Roku channels via text message. The available off-street parking is worth gold! Becky was very responsive, courteous and quite professional. I might add, the restaurant and shopping recommendations in the instruction notebook  are well worth checking out. We loved everything about our stay in Hilltop House and will definitely check availability for our next trip to Seattle."
757840,35454745,2015-06-19,14379350,Delilah,"Becky's house is beautiful, clean, and in a great central location. I hope to stay here again when I visit Seattle. It was hard to leave such a beautiful house at the end of our stay. "

We recently had the pleasure of renting Becky’s delightful 1914 Craftsman atop Queen Anne and could not have been more pleased. Located nearly as high in the sky as one can get on the hill this house made a fantastic weekend home for our family and friends.

Location, location, location! From Queen Anne, Seattle spreads down and around in all directions. Getting into and away from the house is a breeze and even if your goal is to go as short a distance from the house as possible, shopping on Queen Anne Avenue North allows you to do just that.

The home seems larger than it is. With an efficient, well-equipped kitchen and a dining room fortified with a large country table, dinner for 8 is a snap! An intimate patio with grill supports 4 with ease. We made use of the basement laundry, which is such a great amenity to have in a rental home. An excellent entertainment system and WiFi from the bright, cheery living room and adjacent powder room round out the lower level.

Upstairs, the pretty master and it adjoining bath overlooks the neighbor’s small flock of clucking hens which is fun to hear in the morning. A next door neighbor is a bee-keeper. Between hens and hive one might think you were in the country!

Separated by a center bedroom with twin beds and a spacious bath with 2-person shower, the front bedroom doubles the ample closet space found in the other 2 bedrooms and is a great place to relax during the evening.

Becky’s place is a gem. Well kept, clean and beautifully decorated, you will, as we did, fall in love with it."
757840,37829719,2015-07-11,21287727,Kathy,"Becky was very welcoming and helpful. The house was beautiful and actually described! And the neighborhood was perfect for us. Thank you, Becky, for sharing your home with us!"
757840,39475687,2015-07-24,27182918,David,"We were made to feel welcome right from the beginning. The house was very spacious and felt homey. The neighborhood was great. Very convenient to shops, restaurants and cafes. We had a fabulous time there."
757840,40195393,2015-07-29,26055014,Randy,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and was definitely a wonderful one! Becky made us feel welcome and her home was beautiful, immaculate, and provided every amenity possible. The location was perfect for us and all of Becky's information on local restaurants, attractions, and shopping were spot on. We highly recommend this Hilltop House to all!

757840,42107948,2015-08-11,586880,Raji,"The house is beautiful and is well located in Queen Anne. There are lot of nice cafés and restaurants in the area and it is very close to downtown. We really appreciated the well equiped kitchen and Becky's instructions which were perfect. 

So far our best ""Airbnb"" stay !"
757840,42323250,2015-08-12,39461168,Susan,This house was more than perfect for our girlfriend get together. We wished we had booked 2 nights!!  It was beautifully decorated and spotless. Great location to activities in downtown Seattle.  A big extra is the off the street parking.  
757840,43022954,2015-08-17,29821092,Joan,"Our experience exceeded our expectations!  The home is lovely and has absolutely everything you need.  We were 5 adults and never felt like we were bumping into each other.  The sleeping arrangements were perfect for all of us and having 2.5 bathrooms helped tremendously.  We were very surprised to find an incredibly modern kitchen with high-end appliances.  The kitchen, bathrooms and laundry room were well stocked with paper products, cleaning products and all basic necessities.  The location is perfect, walking distance to 2 grocery stores and plenty of restaurants.  The neighborhood was very safe and we always felt comfortable walking.  Kerry Park was a very short walk with amazing views.  I would definitely recommend the Hilltop House to all Seattle travelers.  You will not be disappointed."
757840,43421393,2015-08-19,30815876,Noel,"This is one of the best house I have ever stayed, it is very tidy and neat.  It is perfect for our family of 5.  Location is perfect for our activities.  Highly recommend.  "
757840,44670160,2015-08-28,39268817,Christina,"Our stay at Hilltop House was terrific!  The home was located in a beautiful spot, within easy walking and driving distance to downtown Seattle, as well as, local restaurants and coffee shops on Queen Anne Avenue.  It was the perfect launching spot for our other excursions to Olympic National Park and Mt. Ranier.  The house was spotless, with a well outfitted kitchen to cook any meal.  Would highly recommend this home for your next visit to Seattle."
757840,45248524,2015-09-01,21883628,Ajit,"Beautiful neighborhood, truly on the hilltop. The walk from the Space Needle to the house is a bit tough, but certainly not terrible. The home itself is gorgeous and well kept. There is adequate space for 6. Uber takes on average 10 mins to arrive at the location and takes you most anywhere in town for less than $20. Overall, we certainly enjoyed our time in Seattle at the Hilltop House."
757840,46260058,2015-09-09,2105014,Bev,"Becky’s place was lovely – clean, light, spacious and outfitted with everything we needed. We were a group of six adults and had more than enough room to relax. Loved the refrigerator and enjoyed using the BBQ and the living room fireplace. The dining room has a large, beautiful wood table and was perfect for eating and game playing. If you enjoy puzzles, check out the coat closet – we were there long enough to almost finish one. And, don’t forget to enjoy the front porch chairs while sipping your morning coffee or tea. We loved the location – a short block away from steps down to Queen Anne and a favorite, casual place to eat – The 5 Spot."
757840,47144198,2015-09-16,32847794,Jeff,"We had a great stay at Hilltop House. The home was in excellent condition and had everything we needed. The pictures were very accurate, as was the description. We enjoyed the location and being able to walk down to Queen Anne for food. Would definitely stay in this house again."
757840,47357462,2015-09-18,16144973,Mark,"From beginning to end, the Hilltop House was a great experience for my work colleagues and me. In town for meetings, we took an extra day to see a bit of Seattle and this place made it special. Spacious, clean, stylish but a much better way to do this trip than one more downtown hotel. We were easily able to get where we needed to be from this wonderful neighborhood using Uber. Business meetings and evenings out with a homey place to recharge -- highly recommended!"
757840,47638020,2015-09-21,12011679,Emily,"The house was great - very charming and right in the heart of Queen Anne. However, we were surprised to find a long laundry list of to-dos before check out that included striping the beds, taking out the trash and washing all the dishes with a list incremental charges to the $100 cleaning fee we had already paid if not completed. I've used Air BNB a few times and this was the first time I've encountered a to-do list for check out. We completed all the tasks as asked in our rush to get to the airport but may opt for a hotel next time. "
757840,48299931,2015-09-25,5430489,Stuart,The house was perfect and spotlessly clean and tidy. Great location with just a short wall to uber cool Queen Anne and all its bars and restaurants. I couldn't recommend a stay here highly enough! Thanks Becky
757840,49758619,2015-10-06,29521991,Mary,"Our stay in the Hilltop House was perfect for six adults.  The rooms were all bright, spacious and comfortable. We enjoyed cooking in the kitchen, using the small outdoor space to barbecue, and sharing meals at the beautiful long dining room table. The two front porch chairs were great for coffee.  The location was great for walking to the Queen Anne neighborhood restaurants and Trader Joes.  Also, the off street parking is a big plus.  Becky also has a notebook in the house with helpful information on restaurants, etc. We hope this lovely home is available the next time we visit Seattle.  We would love to stay here again."
757840,50433913,2015-10-12,20038336,David,"My family (six of us) stayed at this house while visiting Seattle early Fall of 2015 and we had a great time. The house is perfect for those looking for a cozy place to stay while visiting with everything you could need, including laundry machine and dryer.

There is a nice big refrigerator for those who do not want to eat out every meal, along with a nice range and a big dining table with seating for 8. 

The house was clean when we arrived and had clear instructions on how the house 'worked' and what is expected upon leaving. 

We would stay here again in the future!"
757840,50868437,2015-10-15,6042388,Stacey,"Becky is spectacular...and her home reflects it. Everything is immaculate, well-designed, tastefully decorated. Stay here. You won't regret it!"
757840,51426162,2015-10-20,34761334,Rose,"This is my first airbnb experience and I loved it. Becky provided thorough instructions around the house (and great email communication), and everything was as described. The house is charming, and had so much space for my whole family (of 6 adults). There's never a time we felt crowded. We cooked a couple family meals (she had all the tools!) and enjoyed it in the spacious dining room with the beautiful table! Neighborhood is very quiet and residential, but is a nice 5-8 min stroll from the main strip with grocery stores, cafes & bakeries, ice cream store, and some cute book/stationery stores. Becky had a binder with some recommendations and we used them! Very close and convenient to downtown and Seattle Center, though I wouldn't recommend walking (you can, in like 15-20mins) because this house is truly on a hilltop! Lovely 5 day/4night visit for my family vacation, and we all truly felt like we were home."
757840,52257533,2015-10-27,45931027,Jarvis,"Becky's Hilltop House is the ideal spot for those who are looking to experience the comforts of a beautiful home, while also being close to Seattle's main attractions. 

The home is equipped with almost everything you could ask for, and more (e.g. fireplace, bbq, outdoor seating, front porch). If you needed something such as an iron or even a hammer, Becky was sure to include it in somewhere in the house. You just have to look for it and it is there in the most sensible place.

Becky also includes a binder not of instructions per se, but a guide on how to fully take advantage of everything the home and the city of Seattle has to offer.

I highly recommend anyone to stay at this property when visiting Seattle.

757840,54404396,2015-11-19,10919198,Jerry,"Do yourself a favor and book this home for your time in Seattle. As an avid airbnb guest and super host for more than 2 years, this home is amongst my very favorite bookings! The organization, amenities, furnishings, towels, linens.....everything is 5-star. And Becky was a dream to deal with as a host, and we absolutely loved Angela and her son who attend to the property. The photos on this one, as beautiful as they are, don't do the actual space and stylish decor justice. The Queen Anne neighborhood is one of the finest in all of Seattle and this place is worth every dime and more! We can't wait to return and make this our home away from home in Seattle! "
757840,54461889,2015-11-20,3752707,Michael,Awesome house...great experience and matched very well what we expected

757840,55715366,2015-12-05,4645532,Kaitlyn,"Becky's house was ideally located and adorable! Modern sleek gourmet kitchen layered in to a redone house that kept all it's charming elements like original wood floors and light switches. The bedding was very comfortable as well (I'd love to know what kind of pillows and mattresses she has because I forgot to check before leaving). 

The wifi and cell service were both great at the house (this was important as I was visiting on a work trip). Becky also put together a great book of local recommendations for restaurants etc. "
7616008,44334990,2015-08-25,25312816,Hazel,"What a fabulous location! The apartment is right in the heart of downtown Seattle and just a fifteen minute walk from the Space needle and a stones throw from bustling Pike Place market. The building itself is full of character and the apartment spacious, light and fully equipped. Our hosts could not have made us feel more welcoming or have done anymore to make our stay enjoyable and ensure we had everything we needed. A real gem of a find. "
7616008,44490939,2015-08-26,29662456,Melanie,This place is AWESOME!! If you love old charm in the perfect location then stay here! The hosts were incredibly accommodating to our travel needs and were quick and easy to reply to communication. We'll definitely stay here again!

7616008,44683793,2015-08-28,8013961,Chris,"Michael was very accommodating and went the extra mile by buying an iron and ironing board and dropping it off within an hour of my asking if he had one!  The apartment was comfortable, clean, spacious, quiet and is located right in Belltown.  An easy recommendation to make."
7616008,45287104,2015-09-01,23958764,Alex,Host was able to accommodate my last checkin time. Place was as described and in a great location. Would recommend.

Michael was also really helpful with restaurant and sightseeing recommendations which was great for me as I had never been to Seattle before. "
7616008,45685415,2015-09-05,39843470,Connor,"The apartment that we stayed in was incredible. So close to everything in downtown Seattle, easy to get to, far enough away where parking wasn't absolutely crazy and plenty comfortable. Great place that I would absolutely consider on my next trip to Seattle. "
7616008,46157039,2015-09-08,19134826,Morgan,"The apartment was exactly as described and very spacious. It has all the basics you need.

I would recommend staying here!"
7616008,46495493,2015-09-11,30551479,Lauren,"The hosts were extremely detailed with arrival and let us store our luggage for an extra hour past check out! Can't beat the location either. It was pretty warm out so we had all the windows open to let in a breeze but there were no window screens which led to a few tiny bugs. 

Overall a great stay with very accommodating hosts!"
7616008,46619755,2015-09-12,9536392,Lauren,"Great location, perfect for touring the city! Michael (and Kevin) gave great directions. The place was perfectly clean and super cute! Thanks again!"

Because the location was so good we barely spent anytime indoors but instead spent our time exploring the city and all that it has to offer!  "
7616008,48084202,2015-09-23,40627650,Sherri,"This spot was perfect for what we were looking for! It was within walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Seattle. The host and his brother were very friendly and happy to help however they could. 

It's in an old building which was super cool. There were a few things that were quirky because it was such an old building. The floor was very creaky, no outlets in the bathroom, not much counter space for toiletries, etc. Overall, we loved the spot and it worked perfect for a few nights!"
7616008,48711797,2015-09-28,40434027,Chelsea,"This was perfect! We loved staying in Belltown and it was walking distance to everything we wanted to see in Seattle.

I would definitely stay here again."

The only thing that could be improved was there wasn't enough utensils and cups. Coffee cups to be exact. The was a brand new coffee maker but not one coffee cup. Other than that kitchen was clean and functional."

656909,2695744,2012-10-23,2701270,Nancy,"I enjoyed our stay at Lisa & Michael's.  I felt like part of the family by the time I left Seattle.  I felt very much at home.  My nephew just started college at UW and the close distance to UW was a huge plus for me.  Lots of parking on the street.  QFC, Safeway, Metropolitan Market and U Village are all close.  We had full use of the kitchen.  Although I really don't cook, did whip up a few delicious dishes.   Loved the 3 little doggies (Jessie, Ginger & Tinker Bell) and kitty (Jacques).  Even took the doggies for a walk.  

Michael and his daughter Rebecca (who was visiting from NY) introduced my nephew & I to frozen custard...which we don't have in Hawaii and it was delicious!  

Will be visiting Seattle often and will definitely be back at Lisa & Michael's.  Thank you for a great stay!"

Since it was our first time in Seattle, she would give us some directions around her place. Her pets are very cute and mostly well-behaved. She is very kind and helpful, there is never once that she is too busy to help us whenever we needed it. Thanks Lisa! :)"

We enjoyed the comfort of sharing most of the house, including the kitchen.   My husband plans to stay at Lisa's house again when he returns  to  Seattle later this summer."
656909,6057721,2013-07-28,548679,Lee,"Lisa was very flexible and accommodating during our overnight stay there, adjusting with grace and good humor to our later-than-expected arrival (how do people drive between olympia and seattle daily? it's a terrible experience) and our dog's need for housing during the daytime hours. Her place is highly recommended, and a great option for those traveling with canine companions. Thanks, Lisa."
656909,6117785,2013-07-30,1652755,Brittani,"Our experience at Lisa's home has been wonderful. The Olympia Room is large with lots of natural light and a great bed. Lisa is very sweet and made us feel right at home. She provided a lot of space for us to make ourselves comfortable and is incredibly accessible to answer our questions whenever we needed. We are very pleased with our experience and would certainly recommend Lisa's home as a place to stay for anyone. She is very flexible, laid-back and easy-going. "
656909,9409778,2013-12-27,4741212,Frances,"Classy-cute, cozy, and comfortable room! My boyfriend Joseph and I stayed at here for a week during this past Christmas. Lisa was super helpful: allowing us to arrive early, driving us to her place despite having other plans when we got lost getting there, and showing us how to get her tv (with a Roku player to stream Netflix) to work! We enjoyed the space and all the snacks and amenities. I gladly recommend you stay in Lisa's home :)"
656909,9792448,2014-01-10,5344415,Jess,"We loved our stay at Lisa's! The bed was super comfy, loved the electric fireplace and the intimate, cozy feel of the room. After some long days of travel and sight-seeing, we looked forward to going back to the room!"
656909,12655111,2014-05-07,12319791,Clara,"I had a fantastic stay in the Olympia room - the room was big, and the house had everything I needed for a very comfortable stay. Lisa was a great host, making me feel very welcome in her home and offering lots of advice on things to do around Seattle. The location was ideal for commuting in to the University of Washington. I would certainly jump at the chance to stay here again when I come back to Seattle!  "
656909,12842215,2014-05-12,14339724,Julie,My whole trip was changed because of a premature baby being born to two weeks before my reservation and Lisa and airbnb were very accomodating to get me a room to stay in!  It was just as advertised and perfect for this trip.  I will definitely book here again!
656909,14199616,2014-06-14,2393584,Alyssa,"Lisa was a great host! We stayed at her house because it was close to the UW campus where my friend was attending interviews at the medical center. Lisa's house is in a residential neighborhood but not far from major streets with great restaurants and cafes around the university district, and parking is easy. Lisa was home when I arrived and she was very sweet and helpful, she found a magazine for me with a writeup on food trucks, shared her wifi password, and gave great suggestions for parks where I could watch the sunset. The room was clean and comfortable! Our stay was very short so we were not able to use any of the common facilities (she offered up her kitchen and coffee), but I'm sure they would have been wonderful as well. There were really thoughtful touches, like earplugs on the night stand and a mini fridge and coffee maker in the room. Bathroom was also spotless. She even has this cool remote control lock for her front door that works like your car key fob, and you don't have to worry that keys are lost or getting copied by past guests. Thanks Lisa!"
656909,14433328,2014-06-19,14266741,Paulina,"Lisa was a wonderful host and made me feel very welcome.  She made it very easy for me to check in and get around, and provided great communication. The room was cozy and the home charming.   I felt very comfortable there."
656909,14802977,2014-06-26,16899157,Kate,"I really enjoyed staying with Lisa, she was very welcoming and warm. The room was fantastic, like a real hotel, with a fridge and a microwave and a very comfortable bed. The house was close to public transport, although it took a fair while to get in to town, usually with a bus change. I would definitely stay here again."
656909,15039955,2014-07-01,9519261,Marianne,Lisa was an excellent host. She was attentive to my needs and gave me space to come and go freely.Her house is in a great neighborhood and 3 minutes away from where I needed to be every day.  Lisa's room was comfortable and cozy. 
656909,16830407,2014-08-03,14599572,Mehran,"Lisa is an excellent host, very friendly, helpful and caring. I stayed at her place for three weeks and it indeed felt that I was at home. The room and house were clean; the house itself is in a great location next to a big shopping centre with lots of restaurants etc. as well as UW and Children hospital. I would be more than happy to stay at her place again."
656909,16934065,2014-08-04,18422076,Alina,Lisa was very friendly. The room was clean and fairly close to the university campus.
656909,17078251,2014-08-06,7870515,Raul,Lovely and very convenient location. Very clean and comfortable. Lisa very friendly and welcoming. We'll be back!!
656909,18008010,2014-08-20,17479994,Ben,"Lisa was an excellent host! The room was big, clean and well equipped.  She sent a really thorough email to me before I arrived, and it really helped out with getting there.  I had a great experience."
656909,18488345,2014-08-27,6671977,Robin,"Staying with Lisa was an incredible experience. She was warm and friendly, and really did her best to make us feel comfortable. Lisa was accommodating, and very easy to talk to. The whole house felt very homey and safe. The room we stayed in was clean, spacious and comfortable for two people, with an included fridge, microwave, and a selection of teas and coffee. We were able to use the kitchen whenever we wanted, which was such a bonus! The location was exactly where we wanted to be — we were within walking distance of some great restaurants and a big shopping  centre. It did take about an hour to get into town, usually with a bus transfer, but that's not unreasonable. There were many bus stops very close to the house. I would absolutely stay here again, it was an incredible experience."
656909,18740008,2014-08-31,17747784,Gustavo,What a phenomenal first Airbnb experience. Lisa has been a gracious host from the beginning and has answered all of my questions throughout my stay. Her two chihuahuas were adorable and cracked me up. Her place is walking distance to good food and the Burke-Gilman trail is a few feet away from her home. The room was super clean and as pictured. I am definitely staying here again and recommend to everyone you do the same. Thanks again Lisa.
656909,20998653,2014-10-09,21003620,Anastassia,"Very nice BnB! The room is cozy and comfortable, with a large bed full of pillows. Everything is well organised in the house, and there are maps and lists of shopping places and activities in Seattle and the neighbourhood. Lisa has been a wonderful and helpful host. She helped us with the paper work we had to do upon arrival in the US, and to move to our rental apartment. We thank her a lot for that. We definitely recommend this place. "
656909,22332767,2014-11-03,22859548,David,I love this place! Lisa Forbes is a phenomenal host.    The house is homey and well maintained.    The dogs are cute and the neighborhood is full of pleasant shops and tree lines streets.  Me and my wife have thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
7775167,41912814,2015-08-09,10595119,Arabia,Kelly was amazing!!!!! The space was exactly what I expected! Nice hot shower and beautiful room with a great view of Lake Washington! Kelly's home is very warm and inviting. Her property is in a very safe neighborhood and everyone I encountered in the area was very nice to me. If you're an organic foodie and enjoy new age ideas you and Kelly will click instantly. 7mins from the lively Capitol Hill area or a 5 min walk to the nearby beaches! Will definitely stay again!
7775167,42639408,2015-08-14,2804374,Sam,"Before I go into how much of an amazing host and all round wonderful human being Kelly is, I will give her apartment some props. It's a beautiful spacious timber house a 2 minute walk from the lake, overlooking a bald eagles nest (I was out a lot so didn't see him/her) and the water - it's tempting to stay in. The room was really comfortable and super quiet so easy to get a good night's sleep. Kelly was extremely welcoming from the moment I walked in,  it was like going home after being away for so long.  She told me some great places to go whilst making some homemade goats cheese and giving me a locally foraged plum to try. I was also given an awesome breakfast of oatmeal super fresh peach and blackberries with fresh goats milk -  every breakfast since has suffered. But the cherry on top of the already huge cake was when she jumped in the car and drove me to my greyhound bus after I had a massive freak out because I'd missed the bus and was really late . Above and beyond, Kelly personifies the true spirit of house sharing,  her apartment is the only place I'd stay in Seattle,  I hope she'll have me back!"
7775167,42973265,2015-08-16,12990742,Chiao-Yin,"I highly recommend to Kelly any other hosts! Kelly is really nice and replied the message very fast. She gave me many advice about the good music performance place. It was so good. Also, I really like the breakfast. The goat milk is so good and natural!!! The house and environment is amazing and safe. The bed is so comfortable. The beach near the house is the best. You can swim and the view is fantastic!!! Moreover, the bus number 2 is convenient to access every famous places. "
7775167,44377511,2015-08-25,25799348,Stephannie,"My stay at the Lake Views in Madrona Park was fantastic. Kelly made me feel so welcomed, it felt like visiting an old friend. My accommodations were above satisfactory for instance there is a real bed not an air bed or futon. I had access to Kelly's kitchen to make a quick breakfast and store items in the fridge. The listing is uber/public transport friendly which is so budget-friendly. Wifi access worked. I had spotty reception on my phone [tmobile :(] but switched over to Wifi calling. Mostly area quiet and peaceful, an urban retreat.Finally, I didn't walk to the lake; however, it was easily viewed from the sun room. "
7775167,44871664,2015-08-29,4765149,Yannick,"Staying at Kelly’s place was amazing. The room in the Madrona neighborhood was the ideal base to explore Seattle. Kelly’s house is beautifully located at Lake Washington in a calm and residential, but very charming area. Capitol Hill and downtown are still reasonably close and easily accessible with Bus No. 2 or by walking. Other busses and/or Uber will conveniently take you to all other parts of the city. The room is exactly as described and I found the bed to be very comfortable. The bathroom was nice and very clean. I used Kelly’s beautiful sitting room and sunroom to finally finish the conference paper I was working on over the past weeks and enjoyed the views on Lake Washington. 
Kelly did a great job as a host. She hosted me on very short notice, was always cordial and attentive, and provided me with a great breakfast at the day of my departure. Thanks again, Kelly! I hope to be back at some point. 
"
7775167,45421162,2015-09-02,14168045,Sarah,"Cozy room, kind and thoughtful host, quiet neighborhood with a lovely view of the lake. Really enjoyed staying here - thank you!!"
7775167,45744210,2015-09-05,9106037,Ashok Kumar,"A lot of places you find at Airbnb will appeal to you and a lot of hosts will amaze you with their effort and heart to ensure you the best of travel experiences, but you can expect Kelly's place and her own hospitality to be a few notches higher. The place itself in Seattle with its spectacular morning sunrise views across Lake Washington and view of the Bellevue Downtown Skyline cannot be at a better location. You can simply spend an entire day with a book in hand (Kelly has the most amazing book collection) and coffee to sip (the best of Seattle coffee made by the host herself) just in the superbly sunlit breakfast room. From here you can spot ball eagles and rowers practicing on the lake for a one of a kind morning inspiration. One of the most well travelled hosts I have met, Kelly can tell stories from Nicaragua in Central America to Guinea in West Africa while making the healthiest and tastiest of breakfasts on the planet for her guests. If you have a taste for ethnic/international food, Kelly will help you find the best of those in the neighborhood and in my case I had a wonderful Ethiopian dinner near her place. I will definitely visit again and also recommend the place to all my friends traveling to Seattle!   "
7775167,46239466,2015-09-08,19035812,Cindy,"Kelly is an amazing person！She is energetic, thoughtful, and healthy-living.  I stayed with her and her lovely kids for 4 nights. She showed me Seattle downtown, pike market，the library, pioneer square, and other nice places. And she is so good at telling stories and history! The other day we went hiking together, such a lot of fun. Honestly, i dont want to leave this lovely and tidy house."
7775167,46557991,2015-09-11,43557248,Jiakun Jack,"I had a wonderful stay at this location. Kelly was very nice and accommodating. The bed was comfortable, the house was clean, and the views are spectacular. The dining room overlooks the lake and has clear views of Bellevue and Mt.Rainier. Did not spot bald eagles though, but maybe you'll have better luck. "
7775167,46803277,2015-09-13,22261890,Bill,"Kelly welcomed me into her home and gave me a tour. The house is in a very quiet and beautiful part of Seattle with an amazing view of Lake Washington. The room is small but comfortable and the house is spacious and Kelly encouraged me to make myself at home.

Kelly and her sons were gracious and interesting people. I enjoyed talking and spending some time with them."
7775167,47795836,2015-09-21,874728,Peter,"You have to enjoy a meal or coffee in the dining room which has startlingly beautiful views of Lake Washington and a Bald Eagle nest! Kelly's home is warm and inviting with ample nooks for reading, a fully-stocked kitchen and a feel and smell that I'm convinced only exists in the Madrona neighborhood. The selling point is surely Kelly, who is an amazing host with a superb knowledge of the City of Seattle. "
4614955,24001535,2014-12-16,23358832,Shane,"Our hosts Joel and Andre were amazing. They pushed the deadline of their remodel to accommodate our travel dates and were incredibly informative and responsive. They even let us store our luggage after we checked out since we had a late flight! The apartment is beautifully decorated and had everything we needed for our 8 day stay. It was our home away from home located right in the center of where we wanted to be in Seattle. Easy walks to Pike Place Market, Capital Hill, etc. The friendly residents, location, and gracious hosts make this our official Seattle Airbnb spot! "
4614955,24625852,2014-12-31,12334210,Ben,"The listing and the pictures were indicative of the apartment with the exception of a few pieces of art in the bedroom which were inconsequential.  Overall, the place was stylish and comfortable, and quite clean.  I have stayed in other units in this building, and apt was by far the nicest.

The neighborhood is also safe and within walking distance to downtown and the convention center.  "
4614955,24897673,2015-01-03,24662219,Mike,"Andre and Joel have a fantastic place and were extremely professional, helpful and attentive. Could not recommend them more highly!"
4614955,25357046,2015-01-13,5563844,Amanda,"By far the best airbnb I've stayed at to date! The apt was clean, well furnished with everything I needed, great location near downtown/capital hill. Andre & Joel were very accommodating and even arranged to let me check in a couple hours earlier than in the listing. "
4614955,26211493,2015-02-07,17488958,Ants,Great location for visiting Seattle. Nothing to complain about and everything one would expect was there.
4614955,26995847,2015-02-23,25303435,Crystal,A very beautiful unit. The place was clean and had all the amenities needed on vacation. The location is great - you're within walking distance of some great cafes and restaurants and can easily access downtown. Andre & Joel were always responsive and made the unattended check-in a smooth process. 
4614955,27213672,2015-02-28,26914207,Amy,"Great location and a very cute apartment!  The unit is a little on the smaller side, but it was perfect for my needs."
4614955,27782348,2015-03-11,5407656,Kara-Leigh,"What a great stay we had at P4!


Overall pleasant stay! Place was very clean and comfortable with all we needed, location was perfect. I loved all the closet space for all our stuff and didn't feel like we had to live out of suitcases. Having ceiling fans and a Bluetooth music system were nice bonuses! Super smooth check in and out process.

Only feedback is water pressure in shower was weak, and bed was too soft in middle.

All in all a good find and would stay there again :)


"
4614955,28036482,2015-03-16,8035876,Stephanie,"Great location. Great apartment. Great Design. The key not working was a bit annoying but the miscommunication was fixed within 20 minutes. Great customer service through hotline. This location will hold your luggage at a $10 fee and then you have to store it yourself in a laundry room. I think a fee like that is just nickel and diming your patrons. Hotels do it for free. Overall, clean & comfortable."
4614955,28305222,2015-03-22,17149902,Heather,"Joel was a great communicator and was very accommodating.  During out trip planning, questions were answered very quick and thoroughly with great suggestions.  They allowed us to check in early to accommodate our early flight arrival and provided storage for our bags with our late departure.  We were in town for a conference and the location couldn't be better- basically right next to the convention center.  The unit is very convenient to markets, grocery store, great restaurants, coffee shops and a short walk to Pike's Market and several other Seattle ""hot spots"""
4614955,28928096,2015-04-01,423857,Jessica,"This is a lovely apartment which looks just like the pictures. We were staying for a conference at the Seattle Sheraton and it was a perfect location, very close to the convention centre. Andre and Joel had put lots of ice in the freezer which was really welcome when we arrived! Everything was spotlessly clean and the bedding was really comfortable. Lots of fluffy clean towels, very well-equipped kitchen, and altogether a very pleasant apartment. "
4614955,29615074,2015-04-10,27042259,Joey,"Good hospitality & Very Helpful . 
House is very clean"
4614955,31290599,2015-05-04,26083736,Jorj,"Beautiful apartment, spotless, and well-appointed! Very comfortable. Host was easy to work with. Convenient location for Pike Place Market and much more! "
4614955,31763349,2015-05-10,15619480,Jason,Hosts were great!  Location was excellent and near the convention center.  Would stay here again.
4614955,32081157,2015-05-13,8614022,Jamie,"This was my boyfriend's and I first time using airbnb (along with our small dog), Joel and Andre made it such a wonderful experience. The unit was fully equipped. We bought some fish from Pike's market, which was a pleasant  short walk away, and cooked it right at ""home."" The unit is exactly as pictured. They also have a real cute rooftop patio with awesome views (which I miss already.) Everything is pretty much easily walkable to. Hosts were extremely thorough as far as communication. No unpleasant surprises, all in all a very clean & pleasant stay. I would recommend, and book again.   "
4614955,32315832,2015-05-17,16136263,Holly,"This was my first airbnb booking and I couldn't be more satisfied. Check-in was painless, with a keypad entry to the bulding and unit. Located a few blocks from the lightrail station (connecting to the airport), and midway between Capitol Hill and the Downtown area meant we could walk to all points of interest. 
The apartment itself was spotless and well stocked, including cooking implements. And this being Seattle, not only was coffee provided, but we had our choice of french press, drip machine, and stovetop cafetera to prepare it!
Our hosts even provided us with a late checkout, so we didn't need to worry about storing our luggage for later flights.
Highly recommended."
4614955,33096078,2015-05-25,3013065,Peter,We enjoyed the close location to the Convention Center and the comfort of the condo. We were able to walk to downtown Seattle and Pikes Place Market and enjoyed the facilities during our stay in Seattle
4614955,33778075,2015-06-01,19862668,Kyujin,"I loved the apartment, since it was very close to the convention center that I was here for. The apartment is great. Exactly same as the pictures. "
4614955,34140779,2015-06-05,24908855,Lauren,"Really lovely apartment with everything I needed for my stay - very modern and new. The location is fantastic, very easy to walk to most of the major sites in Seattle. 
Andre and Joel were very helpful in providing all the info I needed before travelling to Seattle. 
I would definitely recommend this apartment to friends/family for its convenient location and the fact it is much nicer than most hotels!"
4614955,35062749,2015-06-15,3390034,Doug,"The apartment is true to the photos presented. Andre was able to meet me to deliver the keys. He was quite responsive to all questions I had during my week long stay. The apartment is very conveniently located next to the convention center but is also close to many local attractions ( pike place, pacific center etc.)  there is also a 24 hour fitness center about 6 blocks away for those wanting to stay active during their trip. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely stay here again!"
4614955,35773444,2015-06-22,27808737,Garrett,"I cannot emphasize enough how happy I am that I chose to stay at this location for my first trip to Seattle. The apartment is beautifully decorated and furnished, and it is walking distance from everything that one could possibly want to do or see. Check in was easy and effortless. The surrounding area feels safe as well as the building itself. Everything in the apartment functions as it should, and the place comes with a manual that explains everything clearly from the internet to the facilities dumpster locations.

As for the hosts, they are fantastic people on a personal and professional level. The few times that I contacted them via email throughout the booking/checking out process they answered me almost immediately with a prompt and courteous response. The also have everything set up to make things easy on the guests. Great people, great apartment, and great town!"

This unit is really close to everything that they say in the description, and the pictures are very accurate of the living quarters.

4614955,37136857,2015-07-05,21887384,Paula,"Yes. Great hosts. However, check I was quite a fiasco. After a long trip with two kids, the last thing you want to do is climb up to a dark alleyway to a lock box and not find a key. Once that mess was over, things were great. "
4614955,37485749,2015-07-07,9973426,Ming,Andre and Joel's apartment is in a great location and easy to walk to downtown market and waterfront. It has lots of restaurant choices near by as well. Check-in and out procedures were smoothly. Thanks Andre and Joel for hosting us!

4614955,43047787,2015-08-17,2584142,Minerva,"Instructions were clear and Andre made sure everything was in placed. There was a mix up with the cleaning lady, and Andre fixed things up right away. The place is nice and had everything needed. No real noise issues, wifi was super fast, the location was walkable to Pike Market. Everything was great."
4614955,44419177,2015-08-26,34957726,Naomi,"We really loved the location as we walked everywhere on our trip! There is amazing food, and coffee shops right in the neighborhood.

The apartment looks just like the photos. Andre and Joel were very responsive and easy to reaching needed. The apartment was nicely equipped with air conditioning as it was quite warm during our stay. It was quiet and restful-just as we needed."

4614955,47052937,2015-09-15,39432445,Brian,"The hosts were extremely professional and helpful throughout the process, from booking to checking in/out. The apartment was in a great location and very nice, and a much nicer and more personal option than any hotel in the area. Made for a great place to crash after 2 very long days of house hunting. Would stay there again, but we're finally moving to Seattle ourselves"
4614955,47348644,2015-09-18,34663480,William,"It was easy to communicate with Sandy and she was happy to accommodate our requests.
The condo is excellent, fairly spacious and has every appliance available for use.
The location is almost perfect being just around the corner from Robson and is ideally placed for sightseeing most of Vancouver. Yaletown, Gastown, the riverfront and even Stanley Park were all within comfortable easy walking distance."
4614955,47978860,2015-09-22,39862139,David,"Listing was exactly as shown in the picture.  Nice modern place, centrally located.  Pikes market was walkable or a very cheap uber ride (4$).  Easy to get ahold of if needed, keys were simple, couldn't have asked for a smoother process really.  "

4614955,49096950,2015-10-01,34818958,Brent,"The apartment was a great place to stay for my conference at the convention center.  It was well kept, quiet with an excellent bed.  My wife I enjoyed the home like feeling the apartment presented when we came back from a day out on the town.

The proximity to the convention center and many restaurants in the area was a big bonus to this location.  Thanks for sharing your place with us.

Brent and Kelly"
4614955,49637576,2015-10-05,41372271,Ginny,Great place to stay in Seattle. Check-in instructions were sent to me the week prior and everything was a breeze getting settled in. The condo was extremely clean and exactly how it is portrayed in the pictures. It's  also in a great location within easy walking distance to most anything you want to see in the city. Much better than staying at a hotel. I did run into an issue turning my key in that morning as the business where I was supposed to drop it off wasn't open right at 8 a.m. If you have a morning flight and need to turn your keys in right when they open I would suggest doing an early checkout the night before to save you any potential issues. 
4614955,49919067,2015-10-07,43833727,Valerie,"Andre and Joel made us feel very welcome! Instructions were very clear and although we had difficulty figuring out parking, they were quick to answer our phone call. We had 4 adults stay and we fit nicely, although the sofa bed is extremely uncomfortable and you can feel the metal coils. The remodel is cute but needs some detailed fixes. The location is extremely convenient and we walked everywhere! Even walked to Century Link Stadium for a Seahawks game. "
4614955,53956077,2015-11-15,36994739,Joan,"We just returned home after spending nearly 6 weeks at P4 while we received medical treatment at a nearby medical facility.  The accommodations were fantastic - not home, but a darn good substitute!  The condo was spotlessly clean, amazingly well stocked, bright, cheerful,  and completely comfortable.  The location could not have been more perfect for our needs: within easy walking distance to Pike's Market, downtown shopping and a QFC grocery store, right around the corner from some of the best restaurants in Seattle, and (important to us) just a short distance from Swedish Hospital.  The hosts were wonderfully accommodating to our every request from booking such a long stay to supplying additional linens during our stay, and everything in between.  We could not be more pleased with our decision to stay at P4, and we plan to return in the future, next time for fun, not medical treatment!  Thanks, Andre and Joel, for making this very important part of our stay such a positive experience!"
4614955,55204701,2015-11-29,44382681,Shannon,Very accommodating!!!  Great location as well.  Would book again. 
3971934,18771457,2014-08-31,17300900,Sean,"What an amazing place - Not only is it in an ideal location downtown, but the view overlooking the water couldn't be more divine. It's located a few blocks Northeast of Pike Place so you know there is plenty to eat, and a short walk from the Space Needle (throwing distance from the bedroom window...) and Pioneer Square.
This was my first time staying in Seattle, and I found it after the place I was going to stay had to cancel on me a few hours before my check-in. At the time, I was pulling out my hair, but in the end, I see everything worked out for the best.
I was alone in my stay, but this place could easily house a small family on vacation. The kitchen has everything you need if you're looking to cook as opposed to dining out, and there's plenty of place to eat, along with a desk by the balcony if you need to get work done.
Also Miranda and Mike are really pleasant to deal with, amazing hospitality and are there if anything is needed, not that you should expect to have any problems at all.
If I lived in Seattle, I'd want to live here. I hope next time I'm in town the unit isn't booked up as it's definitely now my go-to place should I find myself in the area."
3971934,19056087,2014-09-05,6991385,Marcin,"Amazing host in an absolutely awesome place. The condo was well appointed, clean, and very comfortable. Miranda also was very responsive to all communications. Easily the best experience I've had using Airbnb, and I wouldn't hesitate one second to stay here again."
3971934,19430955,2014-09-12,3976635,Lavone,"This was a third-party booking as I am a travel manager for a computer security company. Many hosts did not want to book through a third-party, which is understandable. With the situation explained, Miranda and Mike graciously accepted the reservation for my colleague. As for the apartment, I have heard nothing but great things about it from my colleague. He was extremely pleased with the apartment (furnishings, light, etc.) and the location. He commented that it was much nicer than staying at the downtown hotels. During the stay, Miranda contacted me to make sure that everything was going well - it was so nice to have the host reach out to make sure the guest was happy with the apartment! I will not hesitate to book this property again for my colleagues (and my own family) in the future. Thank you Miranda!"
3971934,19709903,2014-09-16,21139436,Oliver,"Overall enjoyable stay in Seattle. The apartment is situated in a great central location and was clean and tidy and catered for all needs.  Miranda was proactive and accommodating with regards to the flexible check in/out times. 
Highly recommended!"
3971934,20108712,2014-09-23,20876017,Melissa,The place was gorgeous and in the perfect location! We needed a few extra amenities and Miranda brought them right over to us. We were able to do so much because we were in walking destination of so many things including  the market. I was a little nervous every time we saw neighbors though because we are not residents of the building like everyone else but had to pretend to be visiting friends ins reading of renters. Other than that it was absolutely perfect! Would love to stay again someday.
3971934,21325501,2014-10-14,22336854,Emilio,"Miranda was a fantastic host very easy to work with! The property is unbelievably convenient, walking distance to anything you need, walking was easy but this location made it that much easier! The condo is well furnished with a comfortable and open feeling. The views are breathtaking, from the bay and skyscrapers in the day to the city lights and the space needle at night! Had an amazing trip and it all starts with a great place to lay your head down at night and Miranda provided the best place for me to do so. I will definitely be inquiring Miranda in my future visits to Seattle. "
3971934,21534485,2014-10-19,21783088,Steven,This apartment was great. You could see the space needle and the water from the windows and it had a nice balcony. We love to walk everywhere when exploring new cities and this was located right in the middle of everything.
3971934,22405869,2014-11-05,5367775,John,"Miranda was an incredible host. She was friendly, professional and extremely accommodating. She really went out of her way to make us feel at home. The apartment was great and in a perfect location. I really couldn't recommend her more highly."
3971934,22807098,2014-11-15,23177776,Joshua,"I was a bit apprehensive about my first airbnb stay, but it really turned out perfect;  Miranda was incredibly considerate (met me outside the apartment in spite of my 2 am arrival time, created a list of suggested Seattle sites, was always available by phone for any questions).   The apartment was clean, and the view was fantastic.  If anyone is staying in seattle for a few days, I'd highly recommend this over any hotel"
3971934,23667554,2014-12-07,126968,Rory,"Great place, perfect neighborhood. Miranda's a thoughtful and considerate host."
3971934,23837164,2014-12-12,642510,Rachel,"Wow - what a great host! Communication was the best I've ever known via airbnb - very responsive and helpful, and a lovely lady in person too. The apartment was exactly as described - clean, warm, comfortable, secure, great views. We also had a bottle of champagne and chocolates left for us which was a really lovely touch that we greatly appreciated. Wifi was super fast, and check in and out were a breeze! There's a great deli just around the corner on 4th and Lenora that came in very handy and the space needle, shopping mall, and Pike Market were all less than a slow 15 minute walk away. I would recommend this host and this apartment 100% if you are planning a trip to Seattle. Thank you Miranda. "
3971934,23958117,2014-12-15,15733889,Rudi,"Miranda was an amazing host. We got greeted by her with a bottle of champagne and a box of chocolate. We were able to reach her whenever needed. The apartment had an amazing view and was located in walking distance to the downtown area with plenty of restaurants, cafes and shops. Loved the experience."
3971934,24517018,2014-12-29,6430679,Donna,Had a great time staying at this apartment. Has an amazing view of Seattle.
3971934,24632085,2014-12-31,2403288,Alok,Had a great time. The apartment was perfect. I will book here next time I visit
3971934,24899291,2015-01-03,21662192,X,丢了个东西在房子里。房东迅速地帮忙寄回来了。房子跟图片完全符合。地理位置也很好。就是没有洗衣机和烘干机。
3971934,26610500,2015-02-16,12402598,Jennifer Jordan,"I loved my stay! The unit is bright, spacious, secure and has STUNNING views of the city and waterfront. While you're smack in the middle of Seattle, being on the 22nd floor helps drown out the noise on the streets below. I had really early work commitments while staying and never had an issue drifting off to sleep. The condo was furnished nicely, it was spotless upon arrival + Michael made the move-in process a breeze. One major perk of the location: I didn't use metro or Uber at all! It is within walking distance of everything you need, including major tourist attractions, the waterfront, grocery stores (Whole Foods is a five minute walk) and great restaurants. I would definitely recommend this for your next Seattle visit! "
3971934,27466516,2015-03-05,25483886,Maxime,"Great location, great view, great space.
The apartment itself isn't top notch. A lot of little things are missing (like a curtain for the closet in the bedroom), or just not properly finished (half screwed).
Decent but not as good as expected.
"
3971934,28334594,2015-03-22,5982347,Shay,"The location and the apartment itself were amazing, also Eve was a great host, waited for me and was available for every query I had.
Located 4 minute walking distance from the waterfront, literally 10 meters from a convenience store, with view to the water on one side, and to the city centre on the other side, it is a perfect location.
The building had a nice Gym opened 24*7 for the tenants.
Also swimming pool - but and outside one so only available on Summer time.
Huge screen TV, cable, heating, stove, oven, fridge, and everything needed for a great stay.
Highly recommended!"
3971934,28714882,2015-03-29,27246666,Greg,We had a great weekend stay.  The unit is close to pike place and the waterfront. We actually walked everywhere while we stayed in the unit. Great view.
3971934,29503806,2015-04-08,12969889,David,A great experience all around. The location really makes this place as you can walk to or take a very short Uber to so many great places places in the city. The views were spectacular and let lots of natural light into the space as shown in the photos. Eve was a wonderful host as well with prompt communication and a special gift upon arrival that made the place feel like home. I'd love to stay here again on my next trip to Seattle.
3971934,29741170,2015-04-12,27407453,Maud,"Eve was a fantastic host. Friendly and very accommodating. We arrived early and were able to check in prior to the advertised check in time. She made us feel at home, was helpful and even checked during our stay that we had everything we needed in the apartment. The place was lovely and clean, and we would be happy to stay at her propery if visiting Seattle again! "
3971934,29959508,2015-04-14,434732,Angelo,amazing apartment. Clean and great views
3971934,30174524,2015-04-18,2089400,Annette,We had great days at the Sky High Apartment of Eve. The apartment was clean and very good equipped. We had everything around the corner. We were able to get in the apartment earlier. Thank you Eve! Great view !
3971934,30400039,2015-04-21,29578088,Rebecca,"Eve was very accommodating and allowed me to drop off my bags before check in time so that I did not have to lug them around the conference with me.  Most importantly, she was a clear and prompt communicator.  The place was clean, had a lovely view, and was in a great location.  I could walk to everything I needed!"
3971934,30838856,2015-04-27,31548176,Cy,"We had a great experience.  Eve really is very responsive.  She always provides precise and helpful response.  Our flight was delayed, and she made sacrifice to meet us late at night for check-in.  We needed one extra fitted sheet, and Eve delivered it the next day."
3971934,31539765,2015-05-06,8556503,SeoYun,"This is great location- walking distance to everything! Great place - comfy bed and balcony with good view. Just perfect.
Yes i will stay when coming back to seattle!
Eve was so accommodating, too! It made for a prefect and relaxing trip. Thank you, Eve.  "
3971934,31623939,2015-05-07,434732,Angelo,Eve is always there when you need her. She accommodates all reasonable requests and even helped me get my charger back when I left it behind. The property itself is breathtaking. Highly recommended
3971934,32471565,2015-05-18,28780376,Delwyn,"This apartment couldn't be better located in central Seattle - it is close to major tourist spots as well as eateries, bars and the coastline - and the view can't be beaten. Our stay here is a big part of why our visit to Seattle was such a positive experience.
The apartment is easy to find and is in a secure apartment building, so safety in a big city is top-notch. Also, Eve is an accommodating and welcoming host. I'd recommend this listing to anyone who is travelling to Seattle and I'd happily stay here again."
3971934,32756711,2015-05-21,7858978,Linda,"Eve contacted me that day and asked if I would mind upgrading to another location.  I had a view of the Seattle waterfront and the Ferris wheel!  Great location!  Since I am an early riser, the noise level was minimal at night when I was home, but quite noisy with the construction under the bridge during the day.    I would definitely stay here again!
Eve also had a bottle of wine and snacks on the table for me.  Nice touch for my arrival."
3971934,33103370,2015-05-25,30445930,Ivan,"We initially booked a place on a Capitol Hill, but Eve offered an upgrade to this unit which is within walking distance to the the Pike Place and downtown. We arrived relatively late (after 9:30 PM) but Eve was there to welcome us  and provided essential info about the apartment and the city.
If you are in the city for seeing main Pike Place/Downtown tourist attractions, restaurants and bars, then this is a very good location in a nice and safe neighborhood. We were lucky to visit during the Northwest Folklife festival at the Seattle Center (next to the Space Needle) which turned out to be also a walking distance away. 
The unit itself is in a bit older but well maintained building. The apartment was very clean. Furniture is a bit sparse but you have all the basics covered.  Kitchen and bathroom are a bit outdated, but were clean and functional. 
Overall, we had a great time and would recommend to others visiting Seattle and looking for a way to see the city without a car."
3971934,34281968,2015-06-07,3006432,Andrea,"Eve welcomed me with a big smile, which is good, but actually spent just a few minutes with me explaining me what to do and basically told me nothing about the neighborhood. I felt the pressure of closing the conversation quickly, which I didn't like.
Anyway, it true that she constantly was in contact with me and was actually so kind to suggest me a reimbursement for an issue i had with the shower (still have to receive though).
The neighborhood is okay, close to the center, but actually the exact spot of the building is where lots of homeless people gather and spend time. Not particularly safe, especially for women at night.
Finally,about the apartment, it looks fine but actually some of the furnitures should be changed, updated, as they look pretty old. Rates are pretty high for a non luxury apt."
3971934,34748530,2015-06-11,7900395,Louie,Eve met me at the apartment to give me the keys and was happy to show me the amenities in the apartment.  She made me feel very welcome and I would not hesitate to stay at one of her places again.  Highly recommended!
3971934,34955501,2015-06-14,5366969,Floyd And Marianne,Eve was waiting for us when we arrived. She had fans available in her car that we requested as the weather was pretty warm. The apartment is exceptionally clean and is exactly as it looks in the photos. Eve was always responsive and available to us if we needed her via cell phone or texting. The neighborhood is downtown Seattle and an easy walk to the Pike Place Market and the Seattle Center. Our only issue is the challenge with parking. This really needs to be clarified ahead of time as it does take some planning effort and coordination to make sure you are parked in an authorized spot and for the time needed. One night we had to move our car three times. It is a given that if you park on the street you will have to move your car in the morning. Other than this challenge we enjoyed our stay. The swimming pool and the gym were a plus of the property. A bit noisy on the street for our taste yet this is downtown Seattle. 
3971934,35344825,2015-06-17,3160559,Kincy,"I thorough enjoyed my stay at Eve and Mike's apartment. They were flexible with my arrival, very friendly and helpful in person and checked in on my via email. 

The apartment is excellent, and has a great view of part of Seattle's downtown, half of the space needle and the bay. 

The location is fantastic. Close to everything, all sorts of great restaurants and places to check out within a 1-5 minute walk. 

Internet was fast and reliable. My only bummer is that I didn't have time to check the pool :)"
3971934,35457124,2015-06-19,17572730,Ethan,"We had a great stay at Eve's place! Eve met us and gave us a quick tour of the building and unit. The location is within walking distance of  Pike Market, Belltown and the Seattle Center. Parking in the area can be a slight nuisance, but Eve was able to give us tips on that.  Thanks Eve!"
3971934,36796404,2015-07-01,34540643,Brandy,Eve was fantastic and easy to work with.  Even with our needs overlapping a time she would be out of town she was able to make arrangements that made the process seamless.
3971934,38039108,2015-07-12,6648611,Yukiko,The place we stayed was completely different from the photos found on Airbnb site when I booked. It is regrettable that the host is using another different photos even after my notification on this discrepancy. The host said she is managing 29 accommodations. Then there may be some others which do not correspond to the real ones.
3971934,38833658,2015-07-19,16173511,David,"Eve was an absolute pleasure to work with! She was very accessible at all times to answer any questions, accommodated our schedule for an early check in and ensured throughout our entire stay that we were enjoying our experience. 

The apartment was exactly as advertised, clean, with beautiful views. I recommend anyone needing a place in Seattle to make sure to work with Eve. "
3971934,39430576,2015-07-23,26107693,Eric,Great place in a great location.  Easy check-in process and great communication from Eve.  Will definitely stay here again on a return trip.
3971934,39924864,2015-07-27,7938227,Dan,This apartment was clean and so perfect as a jumping off point for a long weekend in Seattle. Eve was very well organized and made it very easy for us upon our arrival and departure.
3971934,40370929,2015-07-30,36485423,Sarah,"Eve was great about letting us check in early (luggage) while we went and saw the city as we had an early flight in. The location was close to everything in downtown Seattle. 
Although the place was comparable to the photos listed for the location, it was not the same place as shown in the pictures on the website.  "
3971934,41444264,2015-08-07,38499186,Brad,"We loved Seattle and this location was great. Unit was as described. The kitchen was a little bare on some items (no cookie sheet), but we weren't cooking much anyway. "
3971934,41741470,2015-08-09,30093867,Tryn,"Our stay in Seattle was fantastic and at its foundation was our AirBNB stay.  This was our first AirBNB experience and it was thoroughly satisfactory.  The location was fantastic; within walking distance of almost everything we wanted to do/see.  Our great experience started with being accommodated with an early check-in, ended with an easy, stress-free check-out, and supported throughout with our hosts being available via text if needed for anything. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Would definitely stay here again."
3971934,42416820,2015-08-13,37400524,Lisa,Morgan did a great job keeping in touch and the apartment was as pictured. GREAT view and convenient to everything downtown.  
3971934,43549317,2015-08-20,40520984,Theo,"The place was not exacly as seen in the photo, but Morgans customer service goes above and beyond."
3971934,44193493,2015-08-24,3984308,Scott,"Morgan was a wonderful host.  The location is perfect and we were able to walk just about everywhere.  The apartment itself was great; clean, comfortable, modern, and great views.  Whenever I'm back in Seattle I will be sure to stay here.  Highly recommend it."
3971934,48138225,2015-09-23,14192575,Geoff,"Smooth visit, apartment is great, gorgeous view and perfect location. Daniela was very helpful. Only glitch is the page listing a weekly rate but getting charged for 7x daily rate."
3971934,52549229,2015-10-30,41580341,Angel,"Excellent property, very well located and with terrific views. I love the hardwood floors :) and great fridge / TV. I will be back "
755613,3075680,2012-12-11,4356770,Jane,"I spent a wonderfully relaxing Saturday night in the Mount Baker Neighborhood of Seattle recently. The house was warm and cozy with a fire in the fireplace when I arrived. The art and interesting architectural details of the house added to the interest and color of the space. The host gave me lots of good information about how and where to see the best local sites.

After a deep night's sleep, I enjoyed a delicious and healthy organic breakfast prepared by the host. Since it wasn't raining (yes!) I walked through the neighborhood, admired the gardens, stopped in at a few small shops, and then made my way through Mount Baker Park and along the shore of Lake Washington. What a view! In the other direction was the city bus to take me directly to the International District, Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square and more. I can't wait to go again and explore the area. Give Barb a call- she is super friendly and helpful!"
755613,3159721,2012-12-26,4385085,Nicole,"I stayed here over the Christmas holiday, and it was lovely.  Barbara is a gracious host, she puts you at ease and makes you feel welcome.  The room was very comfortable, and she even had an air filter going in the room when I arrived, as she was aware I had allergies!  The first morning, Barbara made a delicious breakfast which included french toast, an amazing quiche, and a fruit smoothie.  I was disappointed to have breakfast plans the following morning, so I missed having another  ""Barbara breakfast..."""
755613,5593289,2013-07-07,870430,Dmitriy,"Barbara was out of town during our stay, Greg helped us. Cozy and clear home, quiet neighborhood, 5 min to LINK. Greg was very helpful, we appreciated his advices. "
755613,5705911,2013-07-12,729212,Stephen,"We needed a last minute place to stay for a business trip up to Seattle, and Barbara was quick to accomodate.  Everything was very smooth, even with our late arrival.  The rooms are great, and the house makes for a fabulous place to stay.  The set up is perfect for airbnb!  In the morning, we had a very good, healthy breakfast ready for us so we could be on our way.  I was so taken, I purchased some of her home made jam.  The location is great, too, being a short drive to downtown so we made the conference in plenty of time. "
755613,6360547,2013-08-09,7981211,Celeste,"I really enjoyed staying at Barbara's. She was a great host with healthy yummy breakfast. The privacy her room has to offer suited me. Her place is extremely convenient; it's a short walk to the train stop that starts from the airport to downtown.
I highly recommend Gem in Mount Baker!"
755613,6673367,2013-08-20,720785,Lindsay,Barbara's master suite is a gem alright.  I enjoyed the old worldliness of her decor and design throughout her home.  She takes good care of her guests and was kind enough to invite me to meet her daughter and son-in-law for ice cream on the last evening I was staying over.  I appreciated Barbara's warmth and care taking and enthusiastically recommend her casa to anyone.  The accessibility to public transit is a nice plus and street parking is always available if you bring a car along.
755613,7036672,2013-09-04,6744617,Rosemary,"My stay at Barbara's made my vacation! The  house is  a wonderful Art Deco with lovely (website hidden) guest room was very pretty and comfortable, the bed is great and breakfast was excellent every day. Barb is friendly ,fascinating and very helpful She actually walked me to my event in the neighborhood. I was so comfortable in her home I spent one whole peaceful day in the sooo comfortable chair in my room reading. Walking distance to light rail ,very nice safe neighborhood. If I'm in Seattle again I'll definitely stay here.!"
755613,10664539,2014-03-02,4532037,Eagle,Lovely home and Barbara is a fantastic and friendly host. She helped us with all of our questions of how to get around and find things and actually accompanied us to Pike's Place Market. The room was great with plenty of room in the private area and in the common area.  Our first experience with Airbnb and it was a completely enjoyable.  Would reserve again 
755613,12323539,2014-04-28,14040840,Susan,"My first experience with airbnb and it was wonderful.  I rented the Gem in Mt. Baker Neighborhood from Barbara for two nights.  The room was fabulous, with a private bath that included a jacuzzi tub!  The room was well worth the additional cost to have a private bathroom.  Barbara is a pleasant host and shares her home and shares ideas for visiting the best places in Seattle.  It's location was accessible to many areas in the Seattle area."
755613,14206591,2014-06-14,13855917,Marsha,"Barbara is a gracious, witty and accommodating host.  The home was eclectic, sweet and welcoming, and reminded me of staying at my grandmas.  The art adorning the walls are from local, sight-impaired artists, and Barbara can share stories about each of them.

This BnB has three chickens, Click, Clack and Cluck, whose eggs I had each morning.  No, the birds are not noisy :)  Barbara picked fresh raspberries from her backyard to go with my breakfast.  The walk to the Light Rail was a slight downhill, and took about 5-7 minutes.  Via rail you are about 25 minutes from airport, and about 20 from downtown.  Parking is easy and free, if you are using a rental car.  Uber had no issue getting to me quickly as well.  

Bed was very comfortable, sheets deliciously crisp.  My room had a handicap accessible sit-style jetted tub/shower combo that a person of any ability would love.  Nice water pressure too, which I appreciated!

A welcome, calm atmosphere for the exploring traveler or wise business person."
755613,14577416,2014-06-22,16496925,Joan,"My husband and I stayed with Barbara for one night while visiting with friends. The stay had everything I expected from a B&B: welcoming host and awesome breakfast. Our breakfast consisted of some homemade baked goods, scrambled eggs (thanks to Barbara's chickens) with some veggies from her garden, and fresh french pressed coffee. I even got to try some mulberries that Barbara picked herself! Will definitely stay with her again. "
755613,14713333,2014-06-24,712707,Chelsea,"Barbara is a very kind and gracious host we enjoyed her company as much as we enjoyed her home! She really went all out with breakfast, we had a Chinese broccoli, carmelized onion and orange pepper omelet that was amazing.  She was so thoughtful and helped us plan our hiking itinerary. She really saved us a lot of time and energy, as several roads were closed and she was aware of this. I hope she runs this BnB  for many years, Seattle will be richer for it.
Thank you from Chelsea and Jason"
755613,14921491,2014-06-29,16092785,James,Barbara was a gracious and engaging host.  The included breakfasts were a real plus.  Room was comfortable with charming ambiance.  Convenience to public transport (and Link) is good.  On-street parking readily available directly in front.  We'd love to visit Barbara again.
755613,15117591,2014-07-02,17037648,Michael,"We had a wonderful time staying with Barbara. Her hospitality was second to none and the room was very comfortable. Breakfast was great and she was very accomodating  The access to the Link Light Rail system made it very easy to get to Downtown Seattle and also Sea-Tac Airport. For future travels to the Seattle area, we will definitely be looking to stay with Barbara. "
755613,15339020,2014-07-07,6918757,Dean,"When my mother and I visited Seattle over a busy 4th of July weekend, I was concerned that I would not find affordable lodging.   Barbara was prompt in her reply and was attentive to all our needs during our stay.  She accommodated my request for a gluten free breakfast- fresh eggs from the chickens out back!- and had tea and fruit available throughout the day.  She took special effort to have breakfast available for us when we had to leave for the airport in the early morning hours, even packing some trail mix and cookies!   Throughout our stay she was readily available in person or by phone or text.  As soon as we met her, we knew we were in good hands."
755613,15601830,2014-07-12,17521634,Elizabeth,We had a great stay at Barbaras! She was very hospitable and made a delicious quiche!
755613,15983235,2014-07-19,17885846,Martin,"A lovely and cozy B&B in a nice quiet neighborhood. Barbara is a kind and gracious host, who made us feel right at home, cooked us delicious breakfast, and gave us tips on places to go and how to make the most of our stay. Even though we were only there a few days, it felt almost like visiting family :)"
755613,16268598,2014-07-24,6601576,David,"Barbara is a great host, very accommodating. The house is unique - the kind of place you'd wonder what it would be like to spend time in. Very interesting artwork on her walls. Barbara provides a good breakfast and great guidance for what to check out in Seattle. The arrangement there is very much like a traditional small bread and breakfast. It is also walking distance to the light rail station. There's a great park nearby and it's a lovely walk to the water. "
755613,16528441,2014-07-28,12437814,Katie,"Barbara was a wonderful host for our weekend in Seattle. Her home is about a ten minute walk from the Light Rail and there was parking available on the street. We met Barbara at the house on Friday evening to pick up the keys. She showed us our room and explained how to turn on the shower, the lights, and checked in with us about what time we'd like to wake up for breakfast. We got back late that night and put a note on our door that we probably would be up later than we planned and to not worry about breakfast. What a kind and generous host we learned Barbara was when we woke up to homemade mulberry muffins, smoothies, and fresh coffee in the dining room. Barbara also left us brochures for sightseeing, coupons for the zoo, and a city map. That night we got back even later but forgot to leave a note that we'd probably sleep in. We also had made plans with a friend to get breakfast and felt so terrible when we woke up and Barbara had made quiche and pancakes that we had to miss. Barbara's home is very cozy and we slept great. Thanks again, Barbara!"
755613,17065767,2014-08-06,16015988,Mary,"Barbara was a wonderful host for our wedding night, and worked with us in good spirits to organize around our busy wedding schedule. Her comfortable bed, cool bathroom, and tasty breakfasts were just perfect for our needs. The location is quite convenient to public transit and the neighborhood is quiet and pleasant."
755613,17854174,2014-08-18,18196373,Andrew,"My wife and I had a great stay at Barbara's place.  We were there for five nights and had five amazing breakfasts.  We particularly loved the fresh eggs from the chickens she keeps in her yard and the fresh picked blackberries.  The room is quite large, with plenty of room to hang clothing if necessary.  Barbara was flexible with times and was able to accomodate us when we requested to drop off our luggage earlier in the day before our check-in time.  We didn't have a car in Seattle, and found that we were able to get around pretty well.  The light rail and buses were a short walk from Barbara's.  We would recommend Barbara to anyone travelling to Seattle."
755613,18038726,2014-08-20,12225087,Veronica,"Barbara was an excellent host! The breakfast was delicious especially the french toast and she was was really attentive to our needs. Barbara even put a fresh flower bouquet in the room. If I ever come back to the Seattle area i will definitely be staying at her home ""Casa de esperanza""."
755613,19099324,2014-09-06,19054673,Anne,"We were quite pleased with the stay we had in Seattle at Barbara's home.  We stayed in the private room pictured in the listing and it was both roomy and comfortable.  The home is conveniently located a 10 minute walk from several modes of transportation, including the light rail and bus system.  Another advantage was the ample parking available at the home, as we did rent a car for a day trip or two we had planned.  Barbara was a gracious host who offered several great suggestions for things to do and see in the area, based on our conversations with her regarding our interests.  The breakfasts were a real bonus as well, and included French Toast, omelets, fruit, toast with a delicious homemade avocado spread and even fresh picked blackberries.  I would typically tend to look for an entire place to rent, and not rent a room within a home, but this experience has broadened my perspective on the subject.  Barbara is a lovely and interesting woman and I enjoyed getting to know her a bit.  I would not hesitate to stay there again if i was to be in the area again."
755613,19385763,2014-09-11,20630932,Frank,"Barbara is delightful. She is sight impaired, and through it she is inspired to help others with visual difficulties. One way she is doing that is by opening an art gallery a few blocks away right next to the Baker Street Light Rail Station. I looks like an uphill task to me, but she happily showed me the artists' works when I visited. Barbara was flexible in getting me into the space later than her stated time. I arrived by car the first night, and as other's have noted the space wasn't particularly clean, though the linens were. I explained what I saw and she had a cleaning person out quickly. 

That said, the house architecture is charming period 1930's, but in need of updates. The wooden floor needs to be refinished and squeaks when walked on. The neighborhood is transitioning from rough to a better level due to the opening of the rail station about 4 blocks away, but still has a ways to go. Away from the rail station and just North the homes are much nicer. 

I would be concerned about walking from the station later in the evening, but I only returned walking once early evening and it was fine.

The picture of the room is accurate, but the lighting does enhance what was there. 

Would I return? Maybe. Barbara is really nice, and she was more than willing to act on my suggestions.  The price was certainly a big plus, and her breakfasts are tasty. I would use Uber or Lyft to get to the rail station after dark. With a little work upgrading, my maybe would change to yes. "
755613,19599879,2014-09-15,18257592,Elsie,The neighbor hood was okay and it surprised us that there were chickens in the yard.
755613,20559286,2014-10-01,11327456,Mary,"Barbara's best traits became immediately apparent upon my meeting her:  a warm personality and an eagerness to make my stay comfortable and worryfree.  She not only had answers to all my questions, but served up some delicious gourmet breakfasts. Her home is beautiful and appealing to guests.   I especially enjoyed discussing art with her and listening to  life experiences that have influenced her passion as an activist for the disabled,  and her new art gallery highlighting the works of visually impaired artists.  Barbara's home is the perfect setting for a B&B,  providing solitude and quiet when I needed it,  or lively conversations with the host when she could afford the time.  I hope to return as soon as my schedule allows it. Thank you, Barb. "
755613,20718000,2014-10-04,21725062,Julie,"The space was quiet and relaxing.  Barbara was a wonderful host and incredibly accommodating.  Terrific neighborhood with easy access to public transportation, walking distance to coffee shops and a great restaurant.  Highly recommend.  "
755613,25722891,2015-01-24,1574818,Don,"Kismet and serendipity all in one.  What a wonderful stay.  Barbara is a  great hostess.  Our room was bright and furnished with pieces period to the house.  Barbara's breakfasts were more than one can ask for.  Loved our stay and if Seattle ever beckons us again, we know where we're staying."
755613,32717396,2015-05-20,1548162,Neil,Barb is great host and goes out of her way to make guest feel at home. Would recommend if visiting Seattle.
755613,33302952,2015-05-26,1548162,Neil,Fantastic - she treats you like it is home.
755613,34288703,2015-06-07,30169781,Lori,"Mike and I had a wonderful experience. Our host made the most delicious breakfasts and helped us make our way around the neighborhood. On the day we left the host provided us with a space to hold our luggage until we left. We appreciated the hospitality and would recommend them to anyone coming to Seattle. It is a nice neighborhood, central to everything. Thank you for a wonderful stay!!"
755613,35002113,2015-06-14,15335126,Mark,"My girlfriend and I stayed here three nights, while in town for a family reunion.  We enjoyed our stay here. The principal owner was out of town mostly, but the co-owner, Rod, was very pleasant, helpful, decent breakfast cook, and a good resource for information/local history.  The house has a lot of old school charm, antique-y character, and the master bedroom is very comfortable.  The bathroom has a luxurious powerful whirlpool too, which was very relaxing.  Location is fairly convenient to downtown Seattle and to the South Seattle area for sure.  We had the place to ourselves, so it was quiet; though with other guests in upstairs rooms, it may not be as private."
755613,35512974,2015-06-19,35579463,Phil,"Barbara welcomed us with a bowl of fresh cherries and lots of interesting conversation. The neighbourhood is very good and safe and 5 minutes walk to the light rail system to downtown Seattle.
The listing is entirely accurate. The house is a gem in Mount Baker."
755613,35676996,2015-06-21,33353700,Sarah,"Barbara was most congenial, in spite of the fact that she had just caught a cold and was not feeling up to par. She made a nice breakfast and gave good advice for visiting the area. If you like to stay in a place that has a vintage, authentic house, this is it...including a walk in handicapped shower/tub for those who need it. 
The Mount Baker area is diverse with many nearby restaurants reflecting the diversity. The house is located within easy access to the light rail."
755613,36320727,2015-06-27,27164503,Anne,"Barbara was a lovely host and made our stay in Seattle all the more special.  Upon greeting us on arrival she gave us a tour of the neighborhood and offered suggestions for dinner venues. The following day she escorted us to the light rail and showed us her art gallery which was most impressive.
Breakfast both mornings was wonderful, healthy and plentiful.  
We were inspired by her cooking skills, green thumb and outlook on art, politics, life, etc.  Her neighborhood is quiet, perfect for getting into Seattle on light rail and walking to a swimmable beach on Lake Washington.  We hope to return on our next venture north."
755613,37110300,2015-07-04,34399537,Jen,Barbara's place was awesome.  A nice quiet neighborhood and a short walk to the light rail and beautiful lake.  Barbara was very accommodating and gave us tourists wonderful recommendations.  Even before our stay she was very helping in helping me figure out transportation.  I would definitely stay again!
755613,37682193,2015-07-09,30966969,Rick,"Barbara was there to greet my wife and I upon arrival. Our rapport was instantaneous. Staying with her is completely unlike grabbing a  hotel room - we were made to feel at home throughout our stay. She's local, she's engaging and breakfast was served with great tasting organic ingredients. This lady has had a wide variety of life experiences both in her Seattle neighborhood and beyond.  We were in Seattle for medical reasons and the location of the home made it easy to drive to the various hospitals. We found that we could enjoy conversation or privacy, which ever suited us at the time. A walk to Lake Washington was a great antidote to a day in the city. I guess the bottom line is that when we return to Seattle, we hope to stay with Barbara again."
755613,38622566,2015-07-17,22405395,Mary,Barbara was a delightful and knowledgeable host. She knows the history of Seattle and is full of recommendations if you need ideas of what to do and where to go. Her home is safe and quiet and conveniently located to light rail and bus lines. Lake Washington and an excellent Italian restaurant are within walking distance. Barbara's passion for cooking is evident in such homemade goodies as mulberry muffins. Her home is filled with art (mostly hers) and lots of 1930's character. A television is available as we wanted to follow the recent All Star Baseball game. All of our needs and wants were met!
755613,39235060,2015-07-21,37112212,Ziqing,"This is my first experience with airbnb and I feel very lucky to have spent four nights in Barbara's ""House of Hope"".  It is clean, cozy, full of styles and spirits, with a great location to downtown and highways, and Barbara is an excellent host.  She was organizing an art event in her gallery the evening we arrived, so we actually met her at her gallery in order to get the key.  Although she was very busy we can still feel her hospitallity, and it was our first experience of running into a small-scale private exhibition and it provided an excellent chance to know more about Barbara's work and her passions.  We were busy visiting Seattle in the following days, returning to her house and chatting with her made our visit more enjoyable and meaningful.  I'll definitely choose to go back to the ""House of Hope"" when I visit Seattle in the future."
755613,40956621,2015-08-03,13922649,David,"We had a wonderful stay at Barbara Oswald's home in the Mount Baker neighborhood in Seattle. The location was very convenient to every place we wanted to visit. (The light-rail line to both the airport and downtown Seattle is only a few blocks away.) Barbara's home was charming--more than charming, beautiful. Despite the heat during the week we visited, my wife and I were quite comfortable. Our room was spacious, with elegant older furniture and fixtures. Both bedroom and bathroom were just fine.  

What made our visit so special, however, was Barbara. She greeted us warmly. She helped us (despite the late hour of our arrival) find a good, nearby, place for dinner. What was particularly enjoyable were the conversations we had with Barbara about her career and ongoing work as an organizer, artist, gallery owner, and promoter of the art of other artists. To top this off, Barbara provided fresh coffee every morning, made us two wonderful breakfasts, and gave us a tour of the artwork--much of it, her own--in her living room.
"
755613,41578814,2015-08-08,29367481,Joan,"Beautifully decorated room in a well cared for 1930's art deco home in a charismatic neighborhood, with all amenities true to description. Breakfast was delicious, with fresh blackberries from the garden (what a treat!).  Barbara was kind and a great conversationalist, and made us feel right at home. "
755613,42735204,2015-08-15,29900923,Fran,"Our host was amazing. We felt so welcomed and it was way above our expectation. She was so generous and took pride in everything she did. We had the best breakfasts ever! Every morning it was something different and exciting, with top quality material and homemade products. The place was immaculate and comfortable. The bath tab and shower was really clean and comfortable. It was better than home! Every corner of this house had something enlightening with paintings, books, stories,..... The location was great - close to downtown and walking distance to Lake Washington. We went for walk around the lake and watched sunset. It was beautiful. This is a real Gem. The host, the house, the yard with fruit trees and great conversations with the host. We gained so much knowledge and really learned how to be generous and take pride in what we do. We recommend this house to anyone who wants to go to an exceptional human experience beyond just staying somewhere."
755613,45092427,2015-08-31,37429005,John,"Barbara's house is a cool but quirky Art Deco with interesting art and furnishings. She accommodated us warmly, the neighborhood is an interesting part of Seattle with tons of new-ethnic restaurants(e.g. Vietnamese and Ethiopian). The yard and storage buildings could use tidying up a bit, but overall a good place to stay."
755613,46024463,2015-09-07,30450291,Qiaochu,The room is beautiful and comfortable. Barbara is very kind and her breakfast was so delicious! A good memory in Seattle!
755613,46778340,2015-09-13,42142961,Sarah,"Barbara creates a comfortable, warm, and welcoming space for travelers. My two year old kept asking when we'd be going back to Ms. Barbara's house. A perfect stay. "
755613,48687955,2015-09-28,36381655,Trish,Barbara is amazing!  We had a very nice stay in her B&B.  The accommodations we very comfortable and the location convenient to the light rail or walking the path @ Lake Washington.  She even lent me a shirt she tie-dyed in Seahawks colors for the game! 
6727846,35852414,2015-06-22,35240145,Coco,"Margarita was a great host, even as she was not in town at the time I occupied her place. She was available for any query I had throughout the whole stay. 

The apartment is clean, cosy and quiet. There a handful of restaurants and groceries within walking distance. 

I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a cosy spot, close to Downtown and fairly priced. "
6727846,36221289,2015-06-26,34063047,Seb,Great place. Well organized and clean. Good location.
6727846,36433712,2015-06-28,35245814,Elizabeth,Host was friendly and very good about communicating instructions and answering any questions prior to visit. You could tell the home had been freshly cleaned upon entry. Best part was the location - easy walking to Seattle Center and Space Needle. This made it easy to get downtown as well. Lots of entertainment and eating options within walking distance. Home had a locked entry and area felt very safe. Would highly recommend!
6727846,39422818,2015-07-23,17319035,Yun,"The apartment is good and cozy, the condition is very good, easy to shop and tour to space needle, just a little hard to transport. We  family like it! And keep it clean as we can. The owner is nice, sadly we haven't time to meet .Thanks a lot!
"
6727846,40481599,2015-07-31,37437909,Rachel,"Staying at Margarita's apartment was my first airbnb experience and she made everything so easy. I didn't actually meet Margarita in person, but she was very responsive to all of my questions leading up to my trip. I picked up and dropped off the key very close to her place, which made things very simple. The location was super convenient for going downtown and it was easy to hop on a bus to other parts of the city. The apartment itself was perfect for myself and my friend and had a bug outdoor patio. Overall I had a really great experience."
6727846,44770697,2015-08-29,35916168,Robert,"Lower Queen Anne is a safe and quiet part of Seattle centrally located to Gas Works Park, Capitol Hill, University of Washington, Fremont, Green Lake, Pike Place Market, South Lake Union, International District, and Space Needle.  Restaurants and grocery store were just blocks away. There is a gate and metal door opened via key fob and a separate key for the apartment for safety. The carpet had just been steam cleaned which I appreciated. Everything was sparkling clean and organized. Margarita's apartment also had a washer and dryer which was a pleasant surprise. I would recommend this listing for anyone visiting Seattle for the first time and wanting to visit the popular attractions. "
6727846,51654667,2015-10-22,46266791,Kurtis,Great location within a short walk to many of Seattle's iconic landmarks. Key pick up was easy and Margarita answered the couple of questions I had promptly. Apt. was clean and comfortable.

8811781,56952297,2015-12-20,48708734,Hannah,This is our first time using Airbnb and we had an amazing experience with Jordan's 3 bed 2 bath apartment. The apartment is clean and just right to accommodate 5 people. We have the privacy we wanted. The main thing about this apartment is the location (Belltown) as we can walk to all the famous attractions in downtown Seattle. We really love the view from the apartment as our building is one of the tallest in Belltown. I will definitely use Jordan's apartment again if I come back to visit Seattle in the future! :)
8053128,48417976,2015-09-26,42532702,Sarah,Alan has a beautiful house with a well-equipped kitchen. Alan was very accommodating when he found out that I had another guest staying in the room with me. He made sure were both very comfortable in the room. The location was great for my bike ride to Harborview Medical Center as well as the University of Washington. I loved my stay in Seattle and can't wait to return!
8053128,51714795,2015-10-24,7163834,Melissa,Great place!  Very clean and has everything you need.  Right by a beautiful park and close to Lake Washington.  Short cab ride to Capitol Hill area makes it easy to get out in the city.  Alan was a great host! Thanks!!

5126446,27263702,2015-03-01,26229853,Indra,"Amy was a terrific host.  She met me at check-in and personally showed me the ins and outs of the well-appointed and clean property.  Everything was prepared for my stay--including maps and tour books-- in this new building which is conveniently located  in a great neighborhood in Seattle.  Even though the rental offered great privacy, Amy was always available and responded promptly and thoroughly when I had a question or concern."
797358,21721966,2014-10-22,1299612,Garren & Deirdre,"This was our second stay at Liam's home.  That fact speaks to how much we enjoyed it.  

Relaxing energy in the home, nice location in the southern side of Seattle which offered plenty of exploring.  Relatively close to the light rail as well, which can take you quickly and easily to the heart of the city.  

The home was very clean and well appointed as well.  

A great area we discovered was Seward park.  Very near to Liam's home.  

Liam was also a great host to work with.  

I would recommend this location to any airBnB travelers.  "
797358,22347955,2014-11-03,21728802,Sebastian,"The post was beyond accurate. Liam was a wonderful host, who was very friendly. I came into Seattle for a music festival ~4pm, and after the festival got cancelled. I txted Liam and told him what was going on, and I was going to leave and stay at a friends place overnight. Liam was even nice enough to refund my stay's cost.

People like this are hard to come by, and I'm glad that I had the opportunity to meet him. The room and the accommodation was actually very private, and it was very cozy. Everything i needed was provided and Liam was even kind enough to let us cook/eat anything that was sitting around in the kitchen. 

5/5 and If i was ever in Seattle, I'd totally come back with 0 hesitation."
797358,22939925,2014-11-17,18420379,Rowan,"Cozy and comfortable, as described. Liam is a friendly, helpful host and I would gladly stay here again on my next visit to Seattle.

"
797358,24091211,2014-12-19,1231520,Pete,"Liam was a terrific host – very friendly, and made sure that our stay was comfortable. The post accurately portrays the house and room. It is a cool older house with lots of character. The bed and the room were comfortable, and the newly renovated private bathroom just outside the bedroom was very convenient. It was nice to have access to the kitchen for a quick breakfast and to keep drinks in the fridge.

Although we have been to Seattle many times, Liam gave us suggestions of some new places to explore and great places to eat, which made this visit special. The house is a ten minute walk to light rail, and bus lines are even closer. I stayed 6 days and was able to get everywhere I wanted to go by transit and walking. I would definitely stay here again and recommend Liam’s place to others.
"
797358,24629742,2014-12-31,647850,Kerri And Jeff,"Liam is really great! And his space is perfect. Liam greeted us warmly, made us feel at home right away and made his kitchen available. The bed is super comfy and the bathroom has everything we needed. We enjoyed chatting with Liam, laid back, chill, and we just did our thing but he made sure to help us out finding our way around and made himself available if we needed. We'd totally come back and recommend in all ways."

797358,27630384,2015-03-08,1442665,Yash,"Wow! Easiest way to describe how awesome Liam's place was.
First and foremost communication with Liam was extraordinary. His place is just as described. Conveniently located, extremely clean and absolutely beautiful. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle. Liam is also a pretty cool dude, I had the chance to grab beers with him and get to hear a local's perspective on Seattle."

The bed was very comfortable, the bathroom convenient and updated, and it was super quiet at night ~ great for sleeping! We would definitely stay there again!"
797358,27907784,2015-03-14,7102816,Marta,"Liam est l'hôte idéal! Générosité, amabilité, flexibilité, disponibilité et très respectueux sont les adjectifs que j'utiliserais pour le définir. La communication avec lui est très fluide et il procurera toujours vous faire sentir comme chez-vous.
La maison est plus que parfaite et vous pourriez profiter d'un grand espace pendant votre séjour. Le lit est extrêmement confortable, en plus, les nuits sont calmes et idéales pour avoir une longue nuit de sommeil réparateur.
La maison est juste à 20 minutes du centre, dans un cartier très vert et parsemé de petites maisons en bois avec des jolis couleurs. Le cartier est très calme et un endroit ou on s'y sent vraiment en sécurité. 
Sans aucune doute, dans mon prochain séjour à Seattle, j'adorerais séjourner à nouveau chez Liam! "
797358,28051785,2015-03-16,5652489,Kenneth,"Liam's place was awesome-an extremely comfortable bed,  with a whole section of the house to myself. Easy to get into the areas of Seattle I wanted to visit, too! Would definitely stay here again! "
797358,28575068,2015-03-26,28498827,Demmy,"Liam was just as described in his reviews. The place was very cozy and quiet. The house was well kept and home like. Loved that I had a keyboard setup as I am a musician. It was very close to the light rail and all forms of transportation.  It's location was perfect! Centrally located, it gave me close access to the city shopping and some beautiful scenic locations. Liam was very helpful in assisting me and making me knowledgeable to the Seattle area! Great host! Great place! I will return next time I am in the area. Made a new friend too.  Thx Liam!"
797358,28671642,2015-03-28,29239914,Amy,"Liam was a great host. He was very welcoming and understanding, since we only spent one night and were there less than 12 hours. The house was just like what was pictured. The area is nice, and is a straight shot into down town. I felt comfortable there and slept great! Having room, outlets, internet, a stocked clean bathroom, and freedom to use the entire down stairs, is what sets this situation far apart from a hotel room. We drove all day, an 8 hour drive turned into a 12 hour drive, and Liam was very flexible with us.
This was my first experience using Airbnb, and thanks to Liam, this is what we will be using from now on. My only disappointment was that we did not get to stay and chat with our host."
797358,28823350,2015-03-30,471660,Scott,Had a great stay with Liam in Seattle. His place was very welcoming and convenient to transportation. The porch was a great place for morning coffee too. Liam was a a super host and very knowledgeable about all things Seattle. Highly recommended!
797358,29649841,2015-04-10,29280102,Amit,Liam is such a wonderful person and is a perfect host. He cares truly about the guests and does everything that’s required for the comfort of their stay. It’s easy to realize how much thoughts he has given while arranging his lovely home for guests. He is very welcoming and very accommodating. And above all he is an absolutely wonderful and awesome person to talk to. Thanks Liam..
797358,29804207,2015-04-12,5370936,Christopher,"Had a great stay here! Bed was so comfortable that I slipped into a mini coma and missed both of my alarms. GEE, THANKS FOR MAKING ME LATE TO MY APPOINTMENT, LIAM! 

Joking aside, I would absolutely stay here again. "
797358,30594422,2015-04-24,359680,Danny,We enjoyed meeting Liam and staying at his place. The room was clean and comfortable as well as the private bathroom. Thanks!
797358,30656418,2015-04-25,31764569,Mareva,"Where to begin.. Well this was a wonderful mid point before actually heading all the way into downtown Seattle after a long day traveling. I loved the easy access from a nearby light rail stop (less than 15 min walk away), next the accommodations that Liam had provided and the hospitality were amazing and unforgettable.  Can't thank him enough for making a first time air bnb'er feel right at home. Will definitely contact again if ever in the area."
797358,30719029,2015-04-26,12115388,Christine,I enjoyed my stay Liam was very accommodating 
797358,30904803,2015-04-28,31552598,Julia,"Liam a été un hôte parfait, très flexible sur la venue et le départ, et surtout très sympathique! Il nous a indiqué les principaux intérêts de la ville et nous a même prêté une carte. La chambre était extrêmement confortable, avec salle de bain privée et accès à la cuisine et au salon. Le quartier était très calme, à 5 minutes du Light Rail à pied et d'un supermarché, rien ne nous a manqué! Nous sommes restées seulement deux jours, mais je recommande pour n'importe quelle durée."
797358,31070046,2015-05-01,31435635,Melody,"This was a great place to stay during our trip to Seattle--Liam was very helpful and very nice and showed us a bunch of things that we could do around the area. The place was not too far from Seattle, which was great as well, since we were mostly doing the touristy stuff near the Space Needle and the Pier and whatnot. Although we rarely saw him, he was great in accommodating our needs and made sure that he was readily available if we needed anything from him. The place was very clean, very nice, and having the whole first floor to yourself is pretty sweet :) I would definitely recommend staying here if you're ever in the area! "
797358,31383579,2015-05-04,3829352,Julia,From the beginning we were treated like long lost friends and felt right at home. Liam's house is the perfect jumping off point for exploring the Mt Baker/ columbia city and Beacon Hill neighborhoods and is a quiet retreat after a busy day in the city. We had no problem using the light rail to get into town. Liam gave us a ton of helpful tips for our visit and we were also given plenty of privacy. 
797358,31500559,2015-05-05,229056,Dee,Awesome house! Great location! Wonderful host:-) highly recommend! 
797358,32390487,2015-05-17,32291332,Kyle,"Liam was great. He was very welcoming, made it very clear that the whole area was always available to you. He even provided many extras that were unexpected. It's really a great home, great location, plenty of parking, quiet... just all around pleasant! Would definitely (and have) suggested him to friends. "
797358,32770996,2015-05-21,5394044,Sahtiya,"We stayed four nights in Liam's room in Mt Baker, near Columbia City. Both neighborhoods are great parts of Seattle to bump around in, lots of great food, bars and an arcade/ice cream parlour (yes it is as good as it sounds). It was the most comfortable experience of our three-week trip staying with AirBnB hosts most of the way. The room itself was clean and private, with plenty of natural light. 

He really makes you feel welcome to share his home, and gave great recommendations about things to do in the city.We had food poisoning for two of the days we stayed (not from any of Liam's recommendations) and we still loved Seattle due in large part to the comfort of staying at Liam's place.  He also made several maps available for us to navigate the city. Staying with Liam puts you in close proximity to several bus lines and the light rail, so it is easy to go downtown to do all the ""Seattle things"" like Pike's Place Fish Market. "
797358,32858985,2015-05-22,9331652,Katie,"Liam was an absolutely wonderful host! His house was a lovely, clean, and he made us feel right at home. Liam also provided us with great information and recommendations for getting around Seattle. We can't wait for our return visit! "
797358,33019450,2015-05-24,20450450,William,everything was great and he even picked me up for free from the lightrail
797358,33273620,2015-05-26,8041963,Julia,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Liam's place in Seattle. The house is beautiful and very big. Since we arrived very late at the Light Rail station he offered to pick us up and was very welcoming right from the beginning. You are free to use everything in the kitchen and living room. It is all very spacious and clean! The room itself is quite cozy, the bed is really comfortable and the bathroom is super clean and modern. The public transport to the city is very close. You can either go by bus or take the Light Train. This was very comfortable for us! We can definitely recommend to stay at his place and should we ever come back to Seattle, we will definitely stay again! "
797358,33520896,2015-05-29,32233968,Jon,Liam was an excellent host. He was very knowledgeable about fun things to do in Seattle and was very helpful with finding my way around the city. I would stay with him again in a heartbeat.
797358,33921454,2015-06-02,30807930,Marina,"My friend and I enjoyed our stay at Liam`s place.  It`s a great location: close to the lightrail station, very clean and comfy. Liam was very nice,welcoming and helpful with any problems. He even picked us up after we figured out that our luggage is too heavy. We loved his cat: he was very funny and talkative! Highly recommended place to stay!
"
797358,34140454,2015-06-05,32294902,Donna,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I couldn't have asked for better! Liam was an exceptional host, welcoming, engaging, generous and very helpful with information as to the surroundings and directions. All pictures were exact, the house was very clean, loved the shower and I think the bed was a close second to the comfort of mine! The neighborhood is very diverse and felt very safe, and was beautiful- I certainly didn't feel as though I was in a city. When I return, Liam's place will be the first I check for availability! Thank you for a lovely first experience, Liam!"
797358,34444659,2015-06-08,30315591,Angela,"Liam was great,  welcomed us as roommates and it was a great fit.   He was really laid back and that made us feel very comfortable.   The accommodations were exactly as described."
797358,34662218,2015-06-10,29808522,Paige,Liam was very helpful and kind. The house had a really cool garden which Liam showed us around and the room was just want we needed.   Great first airbnb experience! 
797358,35656258,2015-06-21,22218117,Christopher,"Excellent time here. Liam is a very knowledgeable, freindly, and gracious host. The home was very comfy. Great location."
797358,35813189,2015-06-22,30235939,Cayleigh,Great place!! Liam was a great host and gave us tips on where to go for our 1 night in Seattle. Everything was very clean and the house is in a great location
797358,36201708,2015-06-26,34383432,Leyna,"He is very ready for guests, with many brochures and a map of the city for guests to use. This is great for people like me, as I have a tendency to get lost! He is very approachable and easy to talk to. Excellent place to stay, very comfortable, and in a very pretty neighbourhood. "
797358,36535458,2015-06-29,32639710,Marcia,"The stay with Liam was great. It was everything as described - excellent transport connections, nice room and private bathroom. He gave us loads of privacy too

Would definitely recommend. A great first time B&B experience! "
797358,37484530,2015-07-07,27993857,Pearce,Liam was an excellent host and he has a beautiful home. It's very handy to public transport and us a short distance to some great restaurants and other convenience. He was very helpful and provided maps and other information.
797358,37873862,2015-07-11,32916214,Michelle,"Staying at Liam's place was fantastic! It was my husband and I's first AirbNb experience and it went great. Liam was kind and laid back and answered any questions we had promptly. The house was clean, and we had a private bathroom. Comfy bed too! His place was also very close to the Light Rail station in which we used every day to get downtown. Parking was also not an issue. I would recommend his place to anyone wanting a peaceful stay in Seattle. "
797358,40390374,2015-07-30,31045164,Lisa,"It was a really nice stay ! Liam was very friendly and gave us some great tips for our stay in Seattle!
The room and bathroom we're extremely neat and comfortable!
All in all a very great Airbnb !"
797358,40455886,2015-07-31,35334517,Alexis,"Liam was a wonderful host! Very friendly and prepared, even had maps printed out for us. His house was homey and clean. Def would stay here again! "
797358,40673205,2015-08-01,39443359,Apollo,This was my first time using AirBnB and I'm glad it was with Liam. He was a great host! He was super friendly and welcoming and made us feel at home. He was well prepared and even had instructions on how to get around using public transportation. The private bathroom was super cute and newly renovated! The room and space were comfortable. I would use Liam again if I ever travel to Seattle in the future! 
797358,40987091,2015-08-03,1637767,Alison,"I had a fantastic stay at Liam's. He is an outstanding host, very communicative and welcoming. 

His place is in a great location in between the airport and downtown which worked out great for me personally as I was arriving late from the airport. The bed is great, the room quiet and he has everything one might need accessible to his visitors. 

Short but comfortable stay. Thanks!"
797358,41962030,2015-08-10,35980805,Mark,"Liam couldn't have been nicer to us.  Really helpful and friendly. Full of useful tips about the area, would definitely recommend him and his house as a place to stay in Seattle."
797358,42846568,2015-08-16,34550225,Lindsey,"This house was the perfect choice for our trip.  Just a short walk to the light rail; we chose to use cars2go to get out of the city and there was usually one in the neighborhood.  The house is exactly as pictured--plenty of space with lots of extras. We were able to cook breakfast most morning and dinners when we were back early (also just a short walk to the store!) Liam told us to use the house as if it was our own and it really made us feel as if we were home.  He is also full of great tips and tricks and places to go around the city.  I couldn't have asked for a better host!  I highly recommend staying here if you are in Seattle. Next time we are in town, I will be sure to stay here again. 
"
797358,43626165,2015-08-21,35900976,Erica,"Liam was a great host! We got to the house from the airport in the morning and he was more than happy to greet and provide us with maps to the lightrail station (walking distance) and places to check out while in Seattle. The pictures on the listing are accurate-- I particularly loved the bathroom! He also has a cute and friendly cat~

Overall just a really great laidback place to crash at after each long day of exploring the city. :) Thanks, Liam!"
797358,44415837,2015-08-26,33578373,Melissa,Felt like a second home. He wanted us to be more like roommates than guests and that was nice. Let let us have access to the kitchen and some household items which was great. 
797358,44532541,2015-08-27,15238064,Anjuli,"My friend and I had an awesome experience at Liam's house in Seattle. It was clean, quiet and well decorated. Everything was ready for our arrival and Liam was extremely helpful in providing instructions and recommendations for runs. The location was great as well - would definitely stay here again on my next Seattle feedback! "
797358,44651334,2015-08-28,791723,Barbara,"Although I left very early to beat Seattle rush hour and Liam was out in the evening,he certainly provided for me well.  It is very evident that he is an experienced and considerate Airbnb host because the bathroom was well supplied, he was ready with maps and information .  His location was great with access to both a great part of town and nature"
797358,44891727,2015-08-30,13033700,Maja,"Perfect, just perfect! Liam is really a ""superhost"", we loved this house, its  style, the sleeping room, the new bath, the pattern of the bed linen, the silence of the veranda, the cat, the sofa, ...the intelligent conversation with this extraordinary nice and easy host. Would love to come back one day! Again: Clean, big rooms, nice neighbourhood, just Perfect!"
797358,45466391,2015-09-03,34919852,Michele,"Liam was very accommodating with regard to our arrival time (we had to change a few times) which made our trip a lot less stressful!
The house is in a reasonable eclectic neighborhood with very easy access to public transportation!  A real bonus considering the parking 
downtown etc!  It is also a quiet, eclectic neighborhood...
We had the run of downstairs, the bed was comfortable and the shower in our bathroom was excellent !
Liam was adamant we help ourselves to anything in the 
kitchen and so, we did... mostly the delicious coffee to get the day off to a good start!
We would definitely stay there again if in the area!"
797358,46413507,2015-09-10,2102383,Raymond,"Liam was a great host for my bf and myself. He kept us informed of where he is at all times and how to get the key/drop it while he was out.  We only met him once during our arrival but he provided us with everything we needed for our stay. 

We really enjoyed his bathroom shower.   It was so powerful and provides a great water massage to relax the muscles.  Do watch out to turn off the water during your soap up or the hot water will run out (due to how much water comes out of the showerhead).   Liam also provides some of the best bathroom amenities I've seen on airbnb (Avalon shampoo/conditioner, disposable racers, soft quality toilet papers).   We truly enjoyed our stay with Liam and highly recommend him to other Airbnb users. 

One last note is to be careful at night because Liam's cat likes to sleep on the bath tub floor mat to not step on him.  He's very passive and friendly and normally I'm somewhat allergic to cats (very minor) but didn't have any issues during my stay."
797358,46904563,2015-09-14,7009858,Barb,"We enjoyed our stay with Liam. The home was a wonderfully simple, open and inviting. We liked the high ceilings, soft light and, for an urban setting, relative quiet. We had full use of the kitchen and slept very comfortably. The little touches in the bathroom were welcome surprises. We almost hoped for rain for one day so we could stay in and curl up with coffee and a few of the books we found on the shelves. Access to light rail and downtown Seattle was an easy 15 minute walk. And, Liam was very accommodating and easy to contact. It was a very nice stay in a very nice space in culturally diverse Mount Baker."
797358,47181803,2015-09-16,41783129,Janice,"Liam communicated well by text. I was concerned about the neighbourhood when we arrived by car as we had a vehicle full of camping gear. However our car was not disturbed and we felt comfortable walking around at night. Lovely bedroom with very comfy bed, attractive bathroom with  quality toiletaries and good towels. Easy walk to light rail and bus to the city. Loved his cat!
Generous about sharing his space. Enjoyed a good meal at a Vietnamese restaurant Liam recommended."
797358,47696879,2015-09-21,39754181,Christine,"We had a great time at Liam's house.  Kitchen, laundry, hot shower, comfy bed and free parking: what's not to love?   I appreciated the ground floor accessibility since I was in an orthopedic boot.  In addition, there are many other amenities such as toiletries and some foodstuffs left by other guests.  For visitors more mobile than I,  public transportation is close and the stay was very quiet.  "
797358,48178646,2015-09-24,14794878,Maureen,"My husband and I were perfectly comfortable staying in Liam's Craftsmen-style home, it reminded us of our own home.  Very quiet, nice neighborhood to walk to grocery store, nearby restaurants or to the bus or Link light rail.  Bed was comfortable and adjacent to spacious bathroom.  Lots of windows to enjoy the sunny Seattle weather we were blessed to enjoy!  We had the use of the kitchen with a delightful assortment of teas, snacks, condiments, etc.  Liam was generous with his time in answering questions about public tranportation, the trees & vegetation in the area and restaurant options.  We made friends with his ancient cat, who took to us too!   If you are looking for a laid-back place to relax after a day of sight-seeing in Seattle, Liam's home is perfect."
797358,49695618,2015-10-05,26425558,Jill,"My partner and I had a great experience at Liam's house. We loved the place itself and the many thoughtful touches, including the ridiculously nice sheets and organic shampoo and conditioner. Liam has clearly thought through every aspect of a guest's experience at his home and provides accordingly.  While we drove (and were easily able to park on the street right in front of the house), we took LINK into the city - the station is just over a 10-minute walk from the house and then about a 10 minute train ride into the centre.  There's a Safeway near the house as well - we cooked dinners and breakfasts in the house's well-equipped kitchen. Lastly, Liam's elderly cat Batty is very, very sweet. Highly recommended. "
797358,49959295,2015-10-07,45294114,Jamie,"Liam was an awesome host. He was very communicative from the start, accommodating on our check in time and even helped us out with our check out time. He was knowledgeable and had good information on where to go and what to see. He even had a multitude of actual pamphlets and maps that we could take with us. It was as if I had checked in at the information desk of Seattle's visitor's center. The house is in a quiet neighborhood outside of the city center, but close enough that commuting into the city is efficient and easy. The bedroom and bathroom are spacious, clean, and have more than enough space. He has towels, shampoo, soap and numerous other necessities either from himself or previous guests. You also have access to the living room if you want to connect your ipod/phone to the speakers and listen tom music. You also have access to the kitchen, coffee, tea and whatever has been left in the cupboards. It had a backpacker feel with the security and private quarters of a hotel. A great place to stay."
797358,50960422,2015-10-16,23383237,Amy,"Liam's home is lovely. Friend and I had the house to ourselves. Liam was easy-to-reach and very helpful. Home is clean, comfy, well stocked kitchen. Lovely organic (and other) toiletries available. Bed is comfy, shower is fabulous.  Home is in a quiet and safe very multicultural area. About a 15 minute walk from Mt. Baker Light Rail. Also about a 25 minute ride directly downtown on the #7 bus along Rainier Avenue via International district that connects to buses going all over the rest of Seattle. Groceries (Safeway) is 2 blocks away (Safeway closes at 11pm).  We got lost at walking at night but it was safe/quiet, just be aware. My phone GPS was NOT aware that some streets behind Safeway don't ""go all the way through"" due to open land  (dead ends) without roads so if you're walking (esp. at night to Safeway because it's dim on some streets if your GPS doesn't provide correct info) just use the 34th and Charleston intersection directly without taking side-streets.  PRINT a detailed local map before you go to show where the roads do and don't go through.   Thanks, Liam. All was great and hope to stay with you again! "
797358,52549756,2015-10-30,20215827,Silvia,"Liam was a very nice host. Communication and also our 'very late' check in was no problem. Our room and own bath was nice and clean. Liam share a lot of tools from his household. So life is a little bit easier.

U can reach Seattle downtown by link (train) in 25 Minutes (10 min walk, 15 ride) Parking is no problem at the area. One less problem in a big city.

If I'm coming ever back at Seattle, I would choose Liam again. I can highly recommend Liam. "
797358,52756073,2015-11-01,46783108,Ben,"Liam and his home were really awesome. My wife loved all of the instruments there to play and really enjoyed that there is not a TV in the living room. There was a bin in the living room with a lot of public transit info and the link and the 7 got us in to town no problem.
The room was very nice and comfortable. The shower was very nice with great pressure. 
Our interactions with Liam were great as well. He responded to questions quickly and when he was at the house it was always a nice chat."
797358,52995556,2015-11-03,17051527,Zarah,"Liam did a great job to make us feel comfortable and warm! It was a little chilly outside but was toasty warm inside. The bed was very comfortable loved the soft sheets!  Every thing was very clean and we were only about a 10 min drive from down town.  The design the house was elegant yet cozy. I would highly recommend his house and the vegetarian restaurant up the way called ""Plum Bistro""  "
797358,53699674,2015-11-11,17969301,Ashley,"My stay at Liam's house was great. Liam is a phenomenal and accommodating host. Communication was prompt and he was able to meet my changing travel schedule. He is very knowledge about the city and willing to help where ever he could. 

What you read in the listing is exactly what you get in reality. The bedroom and bathroom are clean, well-appointed and yours for the duration of your stay. The house is about 10- 15 mins from downtown, in a nice neighborhood with easy parking. 

I was in town to take an exam and the next time I'm in Seattle, I will definitely attempt to stay at Liam's house again. "
797358,54283034,2015-11-17,47072699,Benjamin Randeris,"We had a relaxing and comfortable time at Liam's house. It contains about everything you need and makes a nice base for exploring the city. The description of the place is very accurate. We had (the main floor of) the house to ourselves most of the time, when we were there. Liam was always very kind and helpful."
797358,54881553,2015-11-25,9068749,Jane,"Liam's house is in a lovely quiet neighbourhood, just a short walk from a big supermarket and not far from Mount Baker light rail which has connections to the airport and city centre. Liam was very easy to communicate with before our arrival and during our stay. The room was very clean and tidy with plenty of wardrobe space. The bed was extremely comfortable with a great, warm duvet. The bathroom had plenty of necessities and fresh towels. The hot shower had fantastic pressure. Batty the cat was very soft, gentle and mild mannered. We really appreciate the time Liam spent explaining lots of interesting things about Seattle on the night we arrived. "
797358,55298728,2015-11-29,28711160,Chiraag,"Liam was very accommodating. I had changed my plan and arrival times several times, and throughout the process Liam was flexible and was willing to accommodate all changes. His house was very comfortable and I particularity enjoyed having breakfast by the large window in the living room. I highly recommend this place to any travelers and hope to come back soon!"
797358,56094993,2015-12-08,50314620,Eileen,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Paypal as a payment option.  I read some of Liam’s reviews before I booked with him and was impressed.  From the start he was very helpful and understanding.  I was worried that my money was not showing up in Paypal and he eased my concerns. I agreed to meet him on a Saturday morning at 10:00 AM and was about a half an hour late and he was very patient.  He met me at the house and showed me where everything was. The house looked exactly like the pictures he had posted. The room and bath were exactly what I was looking for! I stayed for 2 nights and both nights Liam texted me to say he would not be home but was nearby and I could just text him if I needed anything.  I could not have asked for a better host for my first Airbnb experience!
A plus to the booking was that Liam has a cat and I love animals.  The best part of staying at the house was having the cat sit on my lap. I highly recommend Liam’s place if you need a place to stay.

797358,56612546,2015-12-15,2311646,Logan,"Liam was such a great host. I felt so comfortable in his home. He left us tea, coffee and small breakfast things along with towels me shampoo things for our bathroom! Recommend anyone to stay here in Seattle. Very close to the city center in a relaxed area. :) I would definitely come back and stay at his spot. "
4916433,24793775,2015-01-02,25268218,Sara,Emily was a great hostess! She promptly replied to all of my mails and the apartment was perfect for our needs! It was a lovely first airbnb experience and I would definitely recommend her place to a friend! 
4916433,25620248,2015-01-20,12131852,Morgan,Emily has created a very welcoming and comfortable home for guests. She was very prompt in her communication and checked in via text to be sure we were settled. I would definitely recommend her house to friends and family staying in Seattle. 
4916433,26547078,2015-02-15,24049879,Yuan-Chih,It was a great experience. Everything we needed was there.  Would definitely recommend to a friend that needs a place to stay in the future.
4916433,26666003,2015-02-16,11997873,Yun Xu An,交通方便，120巴士直接到house对面下达。恰逢情人节入住，amily很贴心的准备了红酒和鲜花，推荐下次入住体验：）
4916433,27076179,2015-02-24,25816882,Jeffrie,"Emily met me at her front door and gave me a tour of the apartment. Everything was as advertised and I had a very comfortable stay. The bedroom where I stayed was small but adequate, I had requested the bed be configured as a King instead of a Single, but if I stayed again I would have selected single as the room is consumed y the King size configuration. Once in bed I was comfortable and slept well."
4916433,29713315,2015-04-11,29598876,Ruthie,"Emily's place was great and she was wonderful as well! Easy to communicate with, accommodating, and overall a great first experience with Airbnb :)"
4916433,29856518,2015-04-13,26174257,Jessica,"This was such a nice place to stay on our trip in the PNW. This house is exactly as described and very comfortable. Emily was so kind as to let us drop off our bags a few hours before check in and to let us leave them there while we waiting 3 hours for our flight after check out. She even sent us off with a nice treat for the trip! The bed was surprisingly comfortable which made up for the amount of space it took up in the room and the house is clean and pretty close to the city by car. In conclusion, Emily has created a living space that truly feels like a home away from home. Thanks Em!"
4916433,40140535,2015-07-28,30539059,Alex,Emily was a very kind and personable host. Everything was exactly as listed it was spacious clean and a great location. Emily was very easy to get in touch with and she was even kind enough to leave out a bottle of wine for us. 
4916433,43163294,2015-08-17,20916465,Ron,"Hostess was out of town, but made sure to text us to insure we had no problems getting in.  Neighborhood is nice, a block or so from a large park and a coffee shop (we didn't try it, but it is a neighborhood type, not the evil empire).  House is on a major arterial, but in a residential area.  It is a very nice place; the bedroom is on the small side for two, but since you have the whole house you can leave your suitcases elsewhere to give you more room."
7809718,44048267,2015-08-23,10516101,Amanda,"Meg's home was comfy and kid friendly. You could tell it was under remodeling and a there were a few parts that weren't quite finished, but the important stuff was done. The parking is on a one-way street with a permit provided by Meg. I had no issues finding parking, but the home was on a one-way street so if you overshoot the home you might have a little walk or need to make a loop.  There was a sweet welcome basket and a guidebook waiting for us when we arrived. Plenty of towels to go around and space in the fridge for a few snacks or a beverage. The garden was flourishing with goodies, but I didn't get a chance to go out in the inviting backyard this time. Maybe next time!

Close to the highway and a short drive from the heart of Seattle. Meg was a delight to work with and very responsive making our trip to Seattle a delight."
7809718,45211896,2015-08-31,35740299,Kyle,"Both Meg and Max were excellent hosts. Our stay here was very comfortable and convenient. They had an accurate description of their home and its features. The location was very walkable to several attractions. It was especially nice that our 1 year old son had a room/crib all to himself. Furthermore, they were extremely flexible regarding our check out. I had an interview that ended up lasting much longer than anticipated, and Meg and Max were very accommodating. Overall, I am very happy with my experience. Thank you Meg and Max!"
7809718,49069710,2015-09-30,44952211,Allen,"Meg was a wonderful host. I just finished the bottle of wine she had waiting there for us. 

Great location and great experience. 

Yaaaaaassss!"
7809718,51967360,2015-10-25,29126475,Zoe,"This was a wonderful home to stay in, especially great for our toddler.  We love the little nook under the TV with all of the toys to play with.  Even though they are living in the house, they did a great job of putting away/hiding their personal belongings.  It didn't feel cluttered, but still had all of the necessities we needed.  We enjoyed hanging out in the back yard, the spacious living room, and walking to Amazing Thai for dinner.  Thank you!"
7809718,53254128,2015-11-07,24379410,Mary Ellen,"Awesome location, love the neighborhood, very kid friendly! 

Thank you for making our week in Seattle wonderful! I was in town for work and brought my 2 kids and my mom so that they could hang out with my sister and her 2 kids who live a few blocks away. The house was very comfortable, clean and PERFECT for the little ones. The toys and crib and kid friendly kitchen supplies were really helpful. The location was perfect and we walked to the University District Safeway to stock up on some food for the week and I loved being in a neighborhood. Meg met us at check in and was professional and kind. She left a great guidebook with some maps and clear instructions. We would love to stay here again!"
3312406,15360742,2014-07-07,13246596,Lisa,"Tory was very responsive to emails, etc, even though he was on vacation. The studio is really beautiful and private. Very new and clean, and well equipped for cooking, etc. Especially perfect for folks who are particularly going to be spending time in Fremont, Ballard, University District, etc. "
3312406,17703738,2014-08-16,2354063,Marit,We LOVED our stay. It was a very quick overnight and the process was seamless. Tory was a great communicator and I would stay there again in a heartbeat. We came with our two young daughters who slept on the pull out and it accommodated all four of us perfectly. The design is beautiful and efficient and had many little touches that made everything very comfortable. And you can't beat the location. One hundred times better than staying in a hotel!
3312406,18120831,2014-08-22,2527354,Anncoury,Tori and Adam were welcoming and very nice. They provided everything we needed on our trip. The bottle of wine and coffee were delightful surprises!
3312406,19286723,2014-09-09,2771221,Jessica,I really enjoyed my stay at Tory's place. The studio was exactly as described; it was more than enough room for one person and would have been perfect for two. The furnishings were cozy and there were even nice details like a bottle of wine left out! The neighborhood was quiet but walking distance from great shopping and food. I'd definitely stay here again. Thanks!
3312406,19421463,2014-09-12,19852606,Emily,The hosts were so accommodating with a bottle of wine waiting for us and fresh coffee to wake us up in the morning. The cottage was immaculate and the perfect size. We slept great in the loft thanks to the comfy pillows. The Fremont area has many walkable restaurants but the peak of our stay was having a homemade dinner with salmon and oysters from the market. 
3312406,20039883,2014-09-22,20693233,Francisco,"We had a great stay at Baker Cottage. The advanced information gave us everything we needed. The cottage was clean, well-designed, and efficient with more than enough space for two. The loft bed was comfortable and the loft was even more spacious than it looks in the photos. The wine, coffee and fresh tomatoes from the garden were an added bonus! "
3312406,20265798,2014-09-26,17691416,Sarah,"I've stayed in a lot of rentals and this is the best, by far. Tory has set the bar so incredibly high, I won't be content anywhere else! The rental was spotless, new, quiet and safe. It was built exactly how I would build somewhere I wanted to live. 

The bed was comfortable, the shower was clean and hot. The washer/drier were pristine. The heat and the A/C both worked well. The latter has a remote control that you can bring into the loft so you can turn it off from bed.

The TV is full cable, HBO with a DVR that you can record shows on. Unheard of! 

The kitchen was the best part -- a huge selection of pots, pans, ceramic baking dishes, stainless steel cook wear, wonderful stove and hood, new fridge/freezer and dishwasher. I love to cook, so it was much appreciated.

Tory was busy, but a great communicator and helped with malfunctioning WiFi. She gave us total privacy, which was appreciated, also.

Literally the only thing I could find wrong was no can opener and I suggested a lamp beside the bed. Hope I get a chance to stay here again!"
3312406,20569147,2014-10-01,20914578,Terry,"Good stay, great facilities. Description of cottage very accurate and neighborhood very friendly and close to all of our needs. Guests will be thrilled with their visit."
3312406,20962999,2014-10-08,1695528,Shirley,Host was fantastic and quick to respond.
3312406,21156914,2014-10-12,15198471,Johnny,"We loved our stay at the Baker Cottage! It had all of the comforts of home in a quiet yet cool neighborhood.
We chose the Baker cottage because although we love dining out, we prefer to cook some of our meals while away from home. The kitchen was beautiful and fully stocked with everything you need to cook almost any meal. There is a fairly good size fridge and a small dishwashing machine and plenty of counter space. The gas stove was a joy to cook on! Tory provided a bag of local coffee as well as a bottle of Washington Syrah. 
The living area was spacious and comfortable and there is plenty of storage so you can really unpack and feel at home. 
The bed is in a loft above the bathroom that looks out on the living room. The ladder leading to the loft is steep and the ceiling is low but the bed was comfortable and it was quiet cozy up there.  
My girlfriend was on a conference call, and I was away when Tory came to the door to drop off the coffee so we didn't meet him. We didn't really need to talk to him though because we had everything we needed and check in and check out was a breeze. Booking was also easy and the instructions for out stay were clear and thorough. 
Overall I would highly recommend the cottage and Tory as a host, especially if you want to cook your meals and like privacy.  
I would say that the loft bedroom might not be the best for really large or tall people or those that might have difficulty climbing the steep ladder. "
3312406,22465415,2014-11-07,36132,Porter,"Gorgeous place, and very well-located.  Tory was very easy to work with, and responsive when we had a minor wifi blip (despite her traveling overseas!).

Hard to say what we liked better -- the excellent kitchen fixtures, the high-pressure rain can shower head, the warming floor tiles in the bathroom... this place is why Airbnb is better than hotels -- prettier, more comfy, better located, better value.

We slept great, no neighborhood noise.  Climate control worked great.  Great linens provided.  Wish we could just move in.  :)"
3312406,22698552,2014-11-12,15401931,Chloe,"We had the best time at the Baker Cottage! It was located in the perfect spot, close to nearly everything. Thanks to some great recommendations given by our host, we were able to experience some great Seattle tastes. The cottage was so cozy and provided everything we could've needed. It was so stylish and modern.  The hosts were available if needed but gave us privacy to enjoy our own vacation. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a convenient and spectacular place!"
3312406,22812330,2014-11-15,414366,Kelly,This house is the perfect spot for a weary traveler. It is both cozy and modern with all the comforts of home. I hope to stay here again soon!
3312406,22924825,2014-11-17,11099020,Joseph,"The place is exactly how it looks in the pictures. Clean, cozy, and very well designed. Perfect for a quick get away and has everything you need. "
3312406,23037398,2014-11-21,15794602,Melissa,"Cozy studio in the perfect location made our stay in Seattle just right. Tory was such a thorough host, offering tons of recommendations for places to eat, drink & shop for groceries, I didn't even have to spend a lot of time researching on Yelp, like I always do! The bottle of wine and coffee were very nice touches. The shower was awesome and so comforting after a long day of walking. We were there during a cold snap, and the little silent heater surprisingly kept the place plenty toasty. Wish the weather would have permitted us to spend more time on the balcony. I love Seattle, hope to return soon, and would definitely stay here again."
3312406,23439909,2014-12-01,81566,Michael,"This was our home, for the Thanksgiving Holiday....and it was so spot on!!!

IT is fantastically designed, well laid/thought out space that is ideally located for so many aspects of a visit to Seattle. I used Lyft to get about when distances were greater than 20 Blocks/40 roundtrip, especially when temperatures were cold.

Tory was kind and warm during our brief meeting, she even went so extra lengths to arrange extra seating/table for possible larger gathering.

Bottom line is I would tell friends about this place, return again, and rave about the wonderful aspects of both the host and facility. 

Ideal place to host an intimate reception/small group as the kitchen is so perfect!! (TRICK- use the PCC Market nearby to get so many great things to share with your family)"
3312406,23765550,2014-12-09,13978288,Jokubas,"The listing description is totally accurate. The loft is super clean and modern. The neighborhood is very safe and quiet, relaxing, and very local. Great way to experience Seattle."
3312406,24226544,2014-12-23,1097652,Joerdis,"We truly enjoyed our week at bright and peaceful Baker Cottage. Our host Tory was very professional in handling all matters related to our stay. The place is more than inviting, it is also well-equipped and very conveniently located. I recommend everyone to stay in ""the centre of the universe"", as the neighbourhood of Fremont is also known, when you are in Seattle."
3312406,24529953,2014-12-30,9316179,Anne,"My daughter stayed there for a week with her daughter.   They loved it.  They want to stay there next year.

I took a walk-through when I delivered them and offered them my house so I could stay there.  They declined.   I can't offer much description beyond this, except to say it's a real charmer and looked very comfortable--especially the loft!"
3312406,25026505,2015-01-05,23828310,Shanna,"Tory has created a perfect nest from which to explore Seattle. It is comfortable, modern, clean and welcoming. We loved the ease with which we could get downtown, the quiet safe neighborhood, and the view from the tiny balcony where we had our delicious coffee each morning. Tory gave us great recommendations about local neighborhood coffee shops, grocery stores and restaurants. Our kids and they loved it as well. I absolutely loved it! "
3312406,25591979,2015-01-20,11637194,Matt,"Amazing studio in the heart of Fremont. The location is close to multiple coffee shops and restaurants which is a plus for New Yorkers who just prefer to walk around as opposed to drive everywhere. Clean, cozy, perfect. The heater wasn't working properly the first night so we gave Tory a buzz. They brought over a space heater and had the contractor stop by to reset the wall unit within 10 minutes. Very pleasant stay in Seattle and would definitely stay here again!"
3312406,25882431,2015-01-28,2859275,Ellie,What a wonderful place to stay in the Seattle area!  The apartment was incredibly clean and comfortable.  The central location made it easy to get to all areas in and around both north and south Seattle.  The hosts were around if we needed anything and were quite responsive if questions were asked.  We appreciated that the kitchen was fully stocked with equipment which made it easy to make dinner in after exploring the city during the daytime.  Tory left a bottle of wine and a few snacks as a welcome.  We'll definitely be staying here again on our next trip to Seattle!
3312406,26220299,2015-02-07,15737413,Chris,"Tory was an amazing host, she was super present and responded to all messages right off the bat.  The cottage was perfect and exactly what we were looking for.  Location was great and overall we had an amazing trip-I highly recommend staying here if your looking to be central Seattle and like the charm of a cute neighborhood."
3312406,26731278,2015-02-18,3023653,Jackie,"Baker Cottage is amazing, just like the photos! Great design and impeccable workmanship. Tory and Adam were very responsive AND very generous with wine and coffee. You will love being up the hill from Fremont and Ballard and down the the hill from Lighthouse Roasters. Such a convenient location."
3312406,26908058,2015-02-22,7322436,Kevin,"Great location for exploring Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods.  If you need to head downtown, there a several bus line options that get you there in short order.  Kitchen is great and allows you to cook real meals if you decide to save some money and eat in.  The cottage is in a quiet and safe neighborhood making for good walking adventures should you choose to travel by foot.  Nice little balcony with partial views to Ballard and the water."
3312406,27222110,2015-02-28,2697757,John,"Tory and her fiance were amazing hosts. They were incredibly helpful and provided some great suggestions for the area. The place itself feels clean, new and thoughtfully put together. I wish I could have stayed longer but the real world beckons. Highly recommend staying at their ""urban chic"" cottage haha."
3312406,27664021,2015-03-09,4724752,Kimberly,"Our host Tory was great! She provided super helpful information prior to our arrival and even left us with some local Northwest treats, which was so nice!

The space was clean, very cute, and exactly as described. Could not have asked for a better experience!"
3312406,29092875,2015-04-04,9759845,Saadia,"Tory's cottage offered us an amazing stay from beginning to end!  We stayed for 1 week and were very sad when it came time to leave.  Her cottage is very clean, extremely organized, and offered everything we would need from kitchen supplies to extra blankets and candles.  We really appreciate her attention to detail when creating such a warm and cozy home away from home.  The bed in the loft upstairs was very comfortable.  The pullout couch in the living room was also surprisingly very comfortable!  Also, the bathroom was very modern and clean and offered a tub/shower with plenty of hot water and a great showerhead!  We were basically out and about all day every day and looked forward to unwinding and relaxing on the cozy pullout couch and watching tv at night once we arrived home.  The balcony was super cute and had a nice view - enjoyed sitting out and relaxing here early in the morning or late at night.  Her cottage offered brochures, manuals, and books about Seattle (sites, information, events, etc) that we found very useful.  The location was perfect for us!  It was just blocks from the central Fremont location and we were able to access parts all around Seattle without any issues.  We don't have children, but for anyone who does, there is a great park and playground down the street.  This was a great pick and we really couldn't have been any happier staying at Tory's beautiful and inviting cottage!  Would definitely recommend for anyone staying for a brief or long stay in Seattle! :)"
3312406,29607606,2015-04-10,27712222,Laurie,"Had a great time in at the Baker cottage, very clean and welcoming, all the comforts of home you could ask for, would recommend highly."
3312406,30135897,2015-04-18,28476400,Natalie,"My boyfriend and I recently spent a week in Seattle for vaction and stayed at Tory's cottage. We absolutely loved it. The neighborhood is very quiet and lovely. We had been to Seattle before , so knew that we wanted to stay somewhere close to Ballard and Fremont. That's one of the reasons we chose this cottage and you can get to either of those neighborhoods in a couple of minutes. The cottage was very clean and had everything we needed. Tory gave us all the information we needed up front to make our stay comfortable. At one point, we couldn't figure out how to turn on the tv. She was very responsive and stopped by as soon as she got our message. I highly recommend staying at her studio of you are coming to the Seattle area."
3312406,30767000,2015-04-27,27807583,Jonathan,"Once again, I had a wonderful time in Seattle. Staying at the Baker Cottage was definitely a treat. The place is well appointed and conveniently located. The hosts definitely thought about every detail to create a space that is comfortable and well equipped. The bathroom was fully stocked and the kitchen had everything you could possibly need to prepare a meal- just bring the ingredients. "
3312406,31176637,2015-05-03,10634164,Danielle.(email hidden),We had a great week at the Fremont studio. It was an excellent location to explore the city and was the perfect size for my husband and me. Tory was great and very responsive to our questions.  
3312406,32370388,2015-05-17,31557553,Ellen,"The studio cottage was exactly as described. Very homey, comfortable, and convenient. Tory welcomed us with a bottle of wine and later some coffee; two wonderful touches. I really appreciated how they were consistently available when I asked any questions, yet we had our separate spaces. A wonderful experience all around."
3312406,32704385,2015-05-20,23430727,Kevin,"We had a wonderful and relaxing stay at Tory's apartment. Everything was exactly as advertised and Tory went the extra mile to make sure we had a relaxing but private experience. The apartment was clean, well appointed and had everything we needed and I absolutely loved the neighborhood, we biked or walked most places in the Fremont area. "
3312406,32937996,2015-05-23,27961531,Karen,"Tory was very responsive to all our texts and phone calls.  The place was beautiful and exactly as pictured.  The welcoming gift of wine was appreciated.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and actually wanted to extend our stay that weekend but sadly the place was booked.  Thanks for use of the bikes.  My son and niece enjoyed a nice, long bike ride.  This is a great neighborhood."
3312406,33268444,2015-05-26,6807475,Corey,"We loved Tory's place and it met all of our expectations.  Great kitcken, and super close to everything.  Would definitely stay again."
3312406,34051623,2015-06-04,5770055,Aaron,"The cottage was PERFECT. There is a reason is has a perfect 5 star rating. The  location is excellent whether or not you have a car as the Seattle public transportation system is amazing. Tory was a great host and gives you very detailed information for your trip and is also available should you need any additional help. The cottage itself is cozy yet very spacious, we had 4 people on our trip and it never felt cramped. The kitchen area is definitely something you should take advantage of as everything you need (minus groceries) is there for your cooking needs. The pull out couch was comfy as all get out and the loft was as well. I will be back next week when I bring my wife and child and am looking forward to it! I'm not sure what else I can say besides stop reading this and start booking."
3312406,34337650,2015-06-07,31944901,Stephanie,"The cottage was just as described in Tory's ad. It was clean, fresh, modern and extremely comfortable.  There was wine and coffee waiting for us on arrival and the location was great.  Parking on the street was very convenient and the Fred Meyer was just down the street for groceries.  Having a washer and dryer there was also a bonus.  I would definitely recommend this cottage to a friend.  "
3312406,34624847,2015-06-10,1624604,Jenna,Tory was a fantastic host. She provided a lot of detail in order to feel right at home in the space. She also offered dinner recommendations in the area for my husband's birthday. The kitchen was well equipped for making breakfast every morning. The location is perfect - we walked to the Fremont market on Sunday and had easy access to Ballard. Ample street parking. We would definitely stay again!
3312406,35068117,2015-06-15,5879795,Sheeva,We enjoyed our stay at this location. It was in a great neighborhood and the style of the studio made it very comfortable. There were four of us staying here however I feel this may be more suitable for just two. The sofa bed was convex and extremely uncomfortable. We had some issues with the drains in the bathroom but they were very attentive when we contacted them about the problem.
3312406,35503338,2015-06-19,11948939,Krys,"We had a wonderful stay at Tory's cottage!  Everything was perfect.  It is private, so comfortable, in pristine condition, and well stocked with everything we needed.  The location was perfect for us and the neighborhood is so nice.  Thank you!!!"
3312406,35787020,2015-06-22,10778396,Ann,"This Urban-Chic studio was exactly as described and pictured.  What we loved was the privacy.  The cottage is completely separate from the main house, you many never run into the hosts, but they quickly respond to a text if you need information.  I thought the keypad entry was very clever and the location is perfect.  It is within walking distance of both Fremont and Ballard.  The cottage is very comfortable and with the bed in the loft, you can't tell if you made the bed or not.  There is a bit of European flair, very clean and contemporary.  It is our new ""go to"" place in Seattle. "
3312406,36558823,2015-06-29,34347634,Patricia,"Great place, met all our needs. Tory was very easy to work with.  Would definitely stay here again."
3312406,37448694,2015-07-07,926299,Martha,"Tory's Seattle Urban-Chic Studio was exactly what my boyfriend and I were looking for. A very clean, stylish retreat with excellent access to Fremont and Ballard. We stayed there over July 4th, so we had walking access to Lake Union to see Seattle's fireworks. 

We wanted to bike around the city and Tory was very helpful making her bikes available to us. On that note, if you stay here definitely take advantage of the bikes and check out the Burke-Gilman trail. It is close-by and a great way to see that side of Seattle. 

As others have mentioned, we had coffee and a bottle of wine waiting for us, which was a welcoming touch. We were there during a heat wave and although many places in Seattle don't have AC — we were VERY happy that the Urban-Chic Studio is equipped with one. Big bonus! We had so much fun, we decided to stay an extra night and Tory was quick in replying to all my texts and helping me facilitate an extended stay. 

I definitely recommend this spot to experience the neighborhoods of Seattle — and feel like a local. "
3312406,37836877,2015-07-11,27360258,Nicole,"So disappointed not to have met Tory, but she did everything in her power from far away to make our stay just perfect! So I really could just say ""ditto"" to all the good reviews that people have left, but I will add a few more. The cottage was exactly as pictured and the space was restful and clean. We were thrilled to have a washer and dryer as we had already been traveling for over a week and catching up on laundry was a treat.  Having wine and coffee already there, was just wonderful!  We had one small issue with a sink drain and Tory, hundreds of miles away, had her handyman there in 20 minutes fixing the drain for us.  So wonderful, thanks Tim!  Thanks Tory, you made our stay lovely! Also, all your food and driving recommendations were perfect. We enjoyed both Fremont and Ballard! Cheers!!!"
3312406,38814721,2015-07-19,19982331,Jess,"Tory's Cottage was gorgeous, just as pictured.  There were two adults and two kids, 12 and 14.  Everyone had plenty of room, and we were all comfortable.  The neighborhood was great.  Nice houses, parks, etc.  Parking on street was not an inconvenience, rather it gave us a chance to pick some wild berries!

Tory had coffee and wine waiting for us, which was great.  Also, we unexpectedly had flight trouble, and had to stay another day.  This took quite a bit of work on Tory's end, which she accommodated gracefully.  "
3312406,39901974,2015-07-27,5649049,Michael,"Tory made us feel very welcome and we felt right at home once we arrived. It was our ""baby""moon so we could not take advantage of the wonderful wine that was waiting for us when we arrived, but the thoughtfulness was really appreciated. 
The studio layout was well thought out, modern, and very comfortable. It was conveniently located to everything. Unfortunately, we didn't have enough time to explore as much as we wanted!"
3312406,40610481,2015-08-01,35670989,Jody,"Cant say enough positive things about  Tory's place!  We absolutely loved our stay.  The space is darling, just like the pictures. The kitchen was fabulous. Every  thought was put into the space.   Even down to the cozy towels in the bathroom.   The weather was hot  for Seattle's standards during our week there, so having air conditioning was a nice option in the warm afternoon hours.   Thank you so much Tory! "
3312406,41723732,2015-08-09,22919035,Leah,"We stayed a week at Tory's place and had a great time. The cottage was charming and in a lovely neighborhood. We walked to downtown Seattle one day, which was a good walk. We used uber the remainder of the time to get downtown.  The average ride was $14.  We also enjoyed the Fremont area and some of the  nearby restaurants. 

The cottage had everything we needed to include a washer and dryer and dishwasher, which was very nice to have. We also enjoyed the coffee Tory left for us.

My husband and I slept in the loft bed which was unique and nice. My daughter slept on the pull out couch.  The only negative thing I could possibly say about this place was the couch and pull out bed were extremely uncomfortable. 

Overall we had a wonderful time and enjoyed the neighborhood as we were able to see Seattle from a perspective that wasn't completely touristy.

Would definitely recommend her place for others staying in the Seattle area. "
3312406,42553396,2015-08-14,6377200,J Christopher,Wonderful digs in a great part of town. Very cozy and private. And the wine was delicious.
3312406,43057170,2015-08-17,2750556,Lee,"Tory was awesome! She was so prompt about getting back in touch with me about any questions I had regarding the AirBnB and Seattle in general. The AirBnB was beautiful! It was literally perfect. Such a fun location, clean, we felt safe and it was a brief 10 min walk to Freemont which we really enjoyed! They really haven't forgotten any details, there were lost of clean towels, laundry, dishes, fun balcony. It is a great spot and we would definitely stay there again."
3312406,44422035,2015-08-26,35594060,Jean-Nicholas,"The loft is really nice and located in a peaceful neighborhood. There is a playground one block down the hill which is very nice for young kids. The Woodland park zoo is also very close. Even though the terrace is small, it was really nice to have and my 3 year old daughter wanted to eat there all the time. There is everything you need in the kitchen so we were able to cook our own food during most of our stay. Although I did not have the chance to talk with Tory very much, she seemed a very nice person and was responsive to my e-mails and text messages before our arrival. There is always parking in the street nearby and it is easy to get downtown Seattle without too much traffic even during rush hour. The place is ideal for people who like to cycle or run in the city…especially if you like short steep climbs! Overall, we were happy with the place but I don't recommend the sofa bed for adults."
3312406,44789199,2015-08-29,18390535,Melissa,"Had a really great stay at the Baker cottage. The cottage is clean and very adorable. Centrally located in a nice neighbourhood. Tory texted all the necessary details to us before we arrived, and even left us a bottle of wine. Thanks for having us, we enjoyed our stay. "
3312406,45104729,2015-08-31,236678,Dolly,Was attentive and answered my requests thoroughly and timely.
3312406,45535729,2015-09-03,565682,Ben,This place is in a great location in a super cute neighborhood. The neighbor across the alley gave my nephews a big basket of delicious plums from his garden and my sister and I got to sip a lively bottle of wine on the balcony while we looked out over the city from the balcony. I'm a professional cook so the kitchen was a special treat for me. Good crocery stores close by to get supplies from. Tory was very prompt and helpful with requests/questions. Overall a great experience. 
3312406,45799623,2015-09-06,4817773,Amanda,"Tori's cottage was wonderfully laid out and in close walking distance of the Fremont neighborhood. Tori was super helpful/responsive to our inquiries. She left a bottle of wine from the area to enjoy, which was a nice touch. The only negative to the place was the hot water ran out pretty quickly. Other than that, perfect experience. "
3312406,46144362,2015-09-08,22123742,Katie,"The studio cottage was perfect in every way I can think of! Being a Seattle native, I knew the location would be prime.  But the space itself is gorgeous, spacious, well outfitted, and immaculate. The photos honestly don't do it justice.  Check in with keyless entry was a breeze, and the bottle of wine to welcome us was a lovely touch.  The loft sleeping space was comfortable, and the ladder steps and railings made it easy to get up and down (even after a night out on the town).  The bathroom was plenty large enough for two people to share while getting ready in the morning, and the kitchen had every amenity we could have needed.  Would definitely book again for my next trip back to Seattle!"
3312406,46494652,2015-09-11,3225935,Klaus,"Baker cottage is an awesome apartment, very quiet neighborhood and a perfect place to relax after a day exploring Seattle. Nevertheless, Fremont is a vibrant surrounding with lots of Restaurants and coffee shops in walking distance. Seattle center is a 20min busride away, you have easy access to public transport from Baker cottage. Tory is a fantastic and very helpful host. We can highly recommend Baker cottage."
3312406,47409622,2015-09-18,21284121,Gabriella,"Tory was an amazing host! As soon as we walked in it was clean, cozy, and looked exactly as it was pictured. The living space was beautiful and modern, it had a loft feel with the bed upstairs. The location of the Baker Cottage was perfect. It's blocks away from little boutique's, restaurants, coffee shops,  and a 15 minute drive into downtown. I definitely recommend the Baker Cottage! "
3312406,47801906,2015-09-21,43294350,Bryce,"Baker Cottage was fantastic. It is well maintained and has a very welcoming feel from the moment you walk in the door. The bed is in the loft, is only accessible by the staircase leading to the loft, and that's awesome. While we decided to explore Ballard and Fremont for our meals, both of which are a short walk/drive/Uber away, I did appreciate that the kitchen was equipped with all of the pots, pans, and cooking tools that one would need to prepare a meal if the choice was made to dine in. The bottle of wine available upon arrival was a nice touch, as was the local coffee provided. If our travels take us back to Seattle, then we will be sure to stay here again. Oh, the heated floors in the bathroom are a great addition! "
3312406,49336283,2015-10-03,23082574,Matt,Great place to stay. Would definitely stay there again.
3312406,49638222,2015-10-05,811624,Ruth,"Wonderful Stay!!!!!  Tory and Adam were absolutely amazing with their communication. Even though they were on their honeymoon they couldn't have been nicer, more communicative or more quick in their responses. Wonderful hosts.  As for the Studio, it was perfect. Great location, great feeling and vibe. I had everything I needed.  So, nice to come home to after a long day at the Northwest Chocolate Festival. I can't wait to come back next year. "
3312406,50031161,2015-10-08,439501,Cal,"Wonderful place. Absolutely immaculate, new construction, very private and everything you need - washer dryer, iron, full kitchen, stocked coffee and even some wine. So nice! Great local neighborhood to stay in and explore. And the bike path is right down the street. Will definitely stay there again!"
3312406,50454406,2015-10-12,41088098,Alison,"Bake Cottage looked EXACTLY like the photographs, no tricky camera work here. It was very private, adorable and cozy. Really appreciated how easy check-in was, no waiting or coordinating issues to worry about. It also had everything we could need for a few nights stay in Seattle. The neighborhood was very cute and quiet, but minutes away from the best brunch spots in Seattle."
3312406,50957608,2015-10-16,71412,Nicolas,"Great place to stay for a couple of days.
Neighborhood is residential, quiet and green."
3312406,51430672,2015-10-20,38650423,Anne,This place was absolutely perfect for my husband and I.  The neighborhood was great and we loved exploring.  The location was close enough to Seattle to see all the sites downtown as well.  Tory was wonderful about providing recommendations on restaurants and things to do.  Hopefully we will get to visit again soon!
3312406,52233994,2015-10-27,42850291,Janice,This cozy cottage was amazing! Not a single complaint. The host was very kind and helpful and the location gave us great accessibility to downtown and other hotspots. 
3312406,52548825,2015-10-30,16011114,Reggie,"The cottage is very nice and comfortable, and the design is very modern and well executed. Our only complaint is that after the first night we did not find the bed to be as comfortable as most hotel beds; however, it was acceptable. The kitchen is equipped with everything that you could possibly need, with great use of the space! The host was helpful and friendly. The location is great, plenty of options within walking distance for food and entertainment, and public transit is nearby for longer excursions. We had a very good time on our trip and enjoyed the convenience and comfort of the cottage! "
3312406,52677903,2015-11-01,18069609,Treasure,"We LOVED the Baker Cottage! Incredible location, beautiful place with all he accomodations we could ever want (fridge, dishwasher, cooking appliances, oven, plenty of blankets, washer and dryer, etc...), the access code also made it so easy and convenient to come and go.

And they made our stay even more lovely with champagne (for our wedding, we wed around the corner of the location), wine and coffee. 

And to top it off they were so sweet! 

We're native to the area but we plan on coming back to more get aways. "
3312406,53599832,2015-11-10,14486018,Emily,The Baker Cottage was a wonderful home base in Seattle. It was stylish and cozy and had all the comforts of home. Neighbourhood is quiet with great views of the city but so close to everything. We would definitely stay again!
3312406,54238497,2015-11-17,43903754,Oscar,This cottage was amazing. This was my first time using Airbnb and this cottage set a pretty high standard. It was exactly as described and more. My wife and I loved the kitchen and appreciated not having to eat out for every meal. The fact that the restroom floor was heated was also super clutch. The bed was comfortable and the decor was inviting. The location was prefect and was not far from the major tourists attractions. There was also plenty to do within walking distance. We enjoyed walking around Fremont and visited the Sunday Farmer's Market. Tory was extremely helpful and answered any questions I had. We would definitely recommend this cottage if you are looking to get away and relax. My wife and I needed a break from work and this cottage provided a great place to unwind. 
3312406,54585189,2015-11-22,3341073,Kristin,"We had a lovely stay at Tory's studio. Fremont is an ideal base for exploring Seattle, and the studio was quiet and light-filled, beautifully modern and clean. We had everything we needed. Tory also was totally responsive and helped us with some dining recommendations as well. 

I would give this stay a 5 stars except for one tiny detail, which was the bed itself. This is a personal thing, and may not be relevant to other guests ( especially solid sleepers), but if one needs a firm mattress for body alignment or a mattress that does not register a second sleeper's movements, then this will be a difficult sleep. If the somewhat lumpy bed is replaced with a firm queen futon or other foam mattress (tuft and needle?) that both offers more spine support and also doesn't register every movement or turn or shake of my partner...then I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. It would be my pick every time I come to Seattle."
3312406,54812892,2015-11-23,3880226,Lev,We had a great stay at Tory's! Seattle is an amazing city and Fremont was a peaceful area to get some rest and relaxation. The apt was wonderful and had everything we needed. Thanks again!
3312406,55388873,2015-12-01,3262713,Elizeu,Tory was a great host: flexible and easy to communicate. I was well received with several tips about the neighborhood. The cottage is comfortable and everything seems new. The location is good as is at walking distance to several cool places in the Freemont area.
3312406,56208072,2015-12-10,39284882,Lauren,"Tori was a great host and her place was the perfect location for my week in Seattle.  The apartment was clean, bright and quiet.  I love the Fremont neighborhood and was happy to be able to walk to many wonderful coffee shops and restaurants.  "
3312406,56595714,2015-12-15,81566,Michael,"Another visit ""Home"", this wonderful place, Seattle, the neighborhood and this warm place to hold my family. We all felt a fit into this well made/equipped abode. Really love coming to this place."
3312406,56866424,2015-12-19,11469301,Maj Christin,"We had such a great time at the baker cottage! No complaints at all. 
Super clean, comfortable and nice. The neighborhood was cosy and felt very safe! Close walk to nice restaurants and cool streets. 
We would come back any time! 

"
3312406,57905452,2015-12-30,12273147,Lindsey,"Wonderful, modern, clean fantastic place! Happy we got to call this place home for a week while visiting family for the holidays. Wonderful neighborhood with excellent coffee/restaurants. Thank you so much! "
7680289,44595429,2015-08-27,33461080,Ryan,"Kevin showed us what a true five-star experience should be on AirBnB!  He greeted us at ""Queen Anne View One"" with an immaculate and well-appointed apartment; where the view really is stunning, everything works, and the bed is super-comfortable.  He was around to lend us a speaker on short notice, and is generally very pleasant to deal with.  This is a top-quality place to stay.  I suppose it didn't hurt that Seattle's summer weather was astoundingly beautiful, too!"
7680289,45000822,2015-08-30,356468,Gal,Cozy apartment. Great view and easily accessible to various parts of town. Kevin was really responsive at all times. The bathroom is clean and you will find everything you need around the apartment.
7680289,45609655,2015-09-04,39191033,Kevin,This is a charming little bungalow that overlooks magnolia to the west and the bay to the south. Kevin was very easy to deal with. I thoroughly enjoyed my time.
7680289,45855361,2015-09-06,40545358,C.J.,"Kevin was a great host, always available and answered my texts and messages very quickly! The apartment was very clean and just felt like the real Seattle experience. Would definitely stay again!!"
7680289,46520254,2015-09-11,39161860,Barry,Kevin was always available to address any needs. He was flexible to my check in and check out deadlines. Unit was great and convenient. I would certainly stay here again.
7680289,46936452,2015-09-14,5076525,Miki,"The apartment was perfect for us! It was super clean, comfortable, and well stocked with all the essentials. We had such a fantastic experience with Kevin and the apartment. We'd definitely stay again and would recommend to a friend. "
7680289,47845158,2015-09-21,9582704,David,Sweet and cozy Queen Anne getaway was everything as described! Kevin is easy to get a hold of and very responsive to questions about transportation and Seattle things to do and see. 
7680289,48013098,2015-09-22,9690724,Kelli,Kevin was great! He let me rent his place for my dads visit. My dad loved the apartment. It was perfect for his first visit to Seattle and the views were awesome. Will recommend this place !
7680289,49058273,2015-09-30,12285075,Ronnie,"Kevin is great to work with. Nice place, great view. Highly recommend."
7680289,49302599,2015-10-02,10370201,Martyna,We had a great stay at Kevin's place. There's a great view of the city from the living space. The bed was comfortable. Kevin was super easy to communicate with. And parking was a huge plus. Highly recommend.
7680289,49539901,2015-10-04,25075520,Jean,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Kevin's Queen Anne View 1. The apartment was as listed and was clean and charming and had a nice view. An added bonus was the private parking area. The neighborhood is great and is centrally located within a short drive to downtown, Fremont, Ballard, etc. We arrived early and Kevin was there to meet us.  The new Keurig coffee maker, coffee pods, creamer, and basket of snacks were a very nice touch. We will definitely stay here again when we come back to Seattle."
7680289,49863767,2015-10-06,2270493,Jan,"Kevin's place is newly remodeled, clean, has parking, a nice view and great price. He was beyond helpful and quick in responding. We made a last minute reservation and were able to stay due to his fast response. We will return when we visit our daughter in college. If you don't know Seattle, this location is safe, quiet and easy to get to downtown quickly. Good public transportation. There is even a small yard behind the house. There are stairs, not too many but if you need an accessible place this isn't for you. I highly recommend this apartment. Great for a home base for work or sightseeing, or a relaxing place to just hang out and watch boats and trains. Pretty sunset view. "
7680289,51356462,2015-10-19,8270014,Thomas Xavier,"I stayed at Kevin's place for two weeks while on an extended business trip to Seattle.  The other times I was here I stayed in a hotel, but since this was a long stay I wanted something that I could call home for a while.  
Kevin's place was perfect.  Just right for me with a well-stocked kitchen (I prefer to cook my own food rather than eat out all the time), washer and dryer (so I didn't need to bring too many clothes with me), great wifi (so I could work from the apartment if I wanted to), clean and quiet to help me get over my jet lag (I came in from France).  This was not an issue for me, but as someone else mentioned, there are a lot of rather steep stairs, so if you are uncomfortable with steep stairs, it might be difficult for you.
Kevin answered all my questions very quickly - but I did not have many since everything was very well organized.  There is a nice view from the apartment and you can walk to a bakery and small supermarket nearby.  There is also a bus stop up the street ($2.50 or $2.75 depending on time of day - make sure you have change) with a bus that goes directly downtown.  I had a rental car (easy to park out front or in the back), but I was able to walk a lot, take the bus (easy) and Uber a few times.  I also found a great fish restaurant that I would recommend (a bit of a walk from the apartment but I did it) called Five Hooks on Queen Anne Avenue North - a kind of casual, friendly seafood restaurant (moderately priced) with wonderful fresh oysters and fish.  There are a lot of other restaurants nearby on that same street.  I felt very much at home and will certainly return if I have another extended stay in Seattle.  Thank you Kevin!"
7680289,51663268,2015-10-22,46547477,Kathy,"Kevin was very welcoming -- with an basket of water and goodies upon arrival.  The apartment (1 of 4 in this building) is located in a hilly area overlooking Elliot Bay with spectacular sunsets.  Everything is clean and tastefully decorated.  And the few extras are appreciated, especially the hair dryer.  I had forgotten to bring mine.  I had elected to not rent a car so I relied upon public transportation, which becomes very easy, once the system is learned.
Kevin was easily available to answer any question I had, either by phone, text or in person.  I care for everyone's comfort is remarkable."
7680289,52135370,2015-10-26,46178766,Ed,"We just spent the weekend at the Queen Anne apartment and we were very pleased with our accommodations. Kevin was very responsive and checked with us before arrival to make sure all was going well. The apartment had everything we needed; a comfortable queen bed, washing & dryer, nice kitchen, private parking, nice views, and great location. We enjoyed walking around the Queen Anne area and would highly recommend the Macrina bakery a few short blocks away. You do have some fairly steep stairs getting into the apartment, but that was not an issue for us, for some it might be. Occasionally we would hear the tenants above us walking around. We will certainly put this place on our short list for future visits to the Seattle area. "
7680289,52561223,2015-10-30,2080415,Megan,"Nice little apartment with great (industrial) view. Access easy. Nice touches such as bottled water, snacks and notes (local knowledge) when we arrived. A bit further out of town than we imagined so not too much in easy walking distance, but Uber solved that issue. $10 ride into downtown. "
7680289,53264040,2015-11-07,4103593,Ben,My wife and I had a great experience with Kevin's place in Queen Anne. The location was very central and easy to access both downtown and the Seattle suburbs. Parking was a breeze. And the views were fantastic. The home has a lot of charm and felt cozy. We'd definitely stay here again.
7680289,54378312,2015-11-19,25064344,Shirin,"Yes, it was a very nice neighborhood and we enjoyed our stay at Kevin's place."
7680289,55317315,2015-11-29,49718766,David,Staying at Kevin's house was an awesome experience for our first Airbnb.  There was coffee and water laid out for us as well as a nice book with nearby places to visit within walking distance.  Directions were clear and the code program to unlock the door was a very nice way to access the house without having to coordinate schedules to meet each other. The house was very clean and had everything a person needs to live as if they were at home.  We would definitely stay here again.   Thanks Kevin!!
7603135,43130999,2015-08-17,5961727,Daniel,"Cool little house, great location near Ballard restaurants/bars/brewpubs. Alex was very responsive. I'd rent it again next time in Seattle."
7603135,43326374,2015-08-18,6917221,Stephen,Nice spacious house in a peaceful neighborhood of Seattle that is also walkable to interesting things to see and do (including very close to the zoo).  Host was communicative and we had a great stay!
7603135,44019280,2015-08-23,18997009,Rebecca,"Easily found.  Corner of a somewhat busy street, the evenings were quiet.  Nice little home away from home."
7603135,47911663,2015-09-21,43732238,Joy,"Very nice home.  Good view.  it's on a quiet street, but not too far from all of the bars and restaurants in Ballard/Fremont."
7182584,49812929,2015-10-06,43535988,Nathan,Great to have a place to ourselves that was still close to the activities we came to enjoy. 
7182584,51312563,2015-10-19,9930480,Trace,"This was a super-cozy, quiet oasis for our weekend in Seattle. This was our first airbnb experience that was truly kid-friendly for our 21 mo old with the low beds and toys and relative lack of potential breakables. The neighborhood was green, quiet, and very walkable with a grocery just a few blocks away. Parking was easy but we walked to breakfast, green lake, awesome playgrounds and quirky shops like Sock Monster and Archie McPhee's.  Not in the middle of the action but a short drive away from the Seattle sights (although we never left the neighborhood). "
7182584,51630087,2015-10-22,1415192,Ryan,"
Pamela did an excellent job of making us feel welcome and at home, and made sure the house was stocked with essentials like fresh coffee and bread. 

The house is really beautiful, the location is great, and there's a lot of stuff for kids in the house (books, toys, bath stuff, etc).

Also, the house itself was set up well for people with young children, since there's a lot of open space both inside and out, and the master bedroom's bed was so low to the ground. (It was also a really comfortable bed!) 

Highly recommended! "
7746170,41904146,2015-08-09,40727354,Carolyn,"Nice room in a cute home at a great price. Brittany was a very accessible and welcoming host - she responded really promptly and got me all the info I needed for the weekend. The room was well maintained, bathroom was good, and all the amenities (towels, etc.) were taken care of.

The setup was really convenient for my stay. I was able to drive into downtown really easily, and there was never much traffic getting into West Seattle. The residential neighborhood is cute and quiet - saw some neighbors out walking during the day. I felt perfectly safe getting back late Saturday night."
7746170,42228569,2015-08-11,7141609,Francesca,"When I arrived at Brittany's home she didn't be at home. There was a lock box.
The area Is dark, deserted And I felt no safe."
7746170,42480204,2015-08-13,15098443,Lauren,"Brittany's home was easy to find, included free parking and easy access to transit (and a quick trip to the action downtown). The room was clean, welcoming and easily accommodated two people. This was a great place to stay for those who want a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city."
7746170,42967267,2015-08-16,14001666,Kev,"House was lovely and quiet and easy to find. 20 mins for downtown Seattle on bus 21. 3 ways to get into town so couldn't be easier! Great bars and shops 5 mins from the house, check out the Beer Junction! Brittany and Dan couldn't be anymore helpful with local knowledge etc! Would defiantly recommend staying there. "
7746170,43690937,2015-08-21,16802701,Katja,"Brittany war eine sehr freundliche, herzliche und offene Gastgeberin. Gleich nachdem wir ankamen, lud sie uns zu Salat und Getränken ein. Außerdem gab sie uns Tipps und Empfehlungen für Restaurants, Bars und Einkaufsmöglichkeiten in der Nachbarschaft. Das Haus liegt im Übrigen in einer sehr hübschen, jungen, sauberen und sicheren Nachbarschaft. Wir hatten keinerlei Bedenken, uns auch abends dort zu bewegen. Das Zimmer war für zwei Personen und lediglich zur Übernachtung vollkommen ausreichend. Außerdem hatten wir unser eigenes Badezimmer und einen separaten verschließbaren Eingang über die Terrasse, die wir auch außerdem nutzen konnten. Insgesamt kann ich den Aufenthalt bei Brittany nur empfehlen."
7746170,44971756,2015-08-30,4979582,Earl,"Brittany was nice and so was the room. The place is located in a nice part of town near a nice little main drag that has shops and restaurants. It was convenient to get around town on the bus from her place (but did involve a fair amount of walking up and down some rather steep hills). The bathroom is not en suite but that did not end up being a problem as the house had multiple bathrooms so there was never a backlog to use the bathroom. Brittany also is an artist and showed us some paintings she had done for an upcoming exhibition, which is pretty cool."
7746170,45621880,2015-09-04,5680614,Alia,Brittany is a wonderful host who responds questions and requests in a minute.  She tries her best to arrange a comfortable stay for guests.
7746170,46348073,2015-09-09,41002943,Edward,She invited me to have pizza and beer with them.  We had a great conversation.  I felt very welcome.  The neighborhood is safe and has easy access to lots of restaurants (though a car is definitely helpful as the neighborhood is quite residential).    
7746170,46851993,2015-09-13,9580648,Anna,"Brittany was able to accommodate us at the last minute when another airbnb reservation fell through!  She also upgraded the bed when we got there plus offered us a beer :)
Her house has a lot of character with two decks in the back with a nice view.  The basement is also very cool with a bar and great place to hang out.  I would definitely consider staying here again next time I'm in Seattle."
7746170,48655186,2015-09-27,24949832,Claire,It was a very nice stay at Brittany&Daniel's. The room is on the second floor and has a private access. The couple also invited us to breakfast.. It was yummy. Thanks! Just one thing to note..we had a hard time finding the lockbox but once we found it it was pretty straight forward.
7746170,51212368,2015-10-18,45936755,Brad,Brittany and Daniel were both incredibly accommodating and hospitable. The house was extremely nice and had a great location. I would highly recommend this location!
7746170,52029924,2015-10-25,2303703,Shona,My boyfriend and I spent one lovely night in this cozy bedroom. We arrived late and left early but our time here was very comfortable. We had everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and the shard areas were clean. We loved the Halloween decorations!!
7714585,45144269,2015-08-31,2910992,Melody,"It was the best airbnb experience I've ever had! Sabrina was a such a wonderful host. The place matches the pictures (looks even better in person). The neighborhood was quiet and easy to find parking just outside the house. There are restaurants and cafes nearby as well.  

The home decor is artistic and absolutely beautiful. Sabrina was very thoughtful that she put notes everywhere in the house to give us kind reminders. (e.g where to find a working outlet, where is coffee, wifi code...etc) All the shower essentials are provided including a makeup remover! She even gave us postcards WITH STAMPS to send home. 

Say no more! I HIGHLY recommended to stay at Sabrina's! Feels just home :)"
7714585,46005787,2015-09-07,19843642,Kayla,"Sabrina's house was great for our long weekend in Seattle. Very accurate listing and cute neighborhood. We found it easy to get around without any trouble due to being close to public transit and using ubers. Very cute home and has all the essentials and more (loved the stamped postcards and treats!). Sabrina was out most of the weekend, but we still felt welcome and at home! Thanks Sabrina!"
7714585,47290268,2015-09-17,39530004,要飞去的远方,"Sabrina's house is the most nice house I have been.The house is very beautiful and cute.Sabrina writes some notes make me warm.If I will come back Seattle,I will come back here."
7714585,47794363,2015-09-21,10201541,Kyle,Great place with many unique touches that made us feel welcome. It's also within walking distance to cafes and the Ballard street market. Sabrina was a great host.
7714585,48536395,2015-09-27,41065150,Kelli,"Sabrina was a gracious host. Her house was clean, warm, inviting and beautifully decorated. Sabrina let us check in early and responded to all our questions quickly. We had a great visit thanks to Sabrina. "
7714585,50784195,2015-10-14,5508463,Stefanie & Jules,What a wonderful experience. Sabrina is a terrific host. She made us feel extremely welcome. The room was exactly what we needed. The postcards and breakfast pizza were added bonuses and very much appreciated. 
7714585,51191459,2015-10-18,27293079,Hannah,"Sabrina welcomed us with a cute note on the front door when we arrived. The room was decorated nicely and the whole house has an amazing, decorative and fun feel to it. I enjoyed the coffee in the morning! Good location close to Ballard area, which we were interested in checking out. Overall a nice stay."
7714585,51921307,2015-10-25,43712153,Rachel,"The description of the house is very accurate. Sabrina was very quick with her communication, and arriving at her house and getting settled was a cinch! She has cute labels throughout the house to help guide guests. The room is in the basement (along with a sitting area and TV for relaxation), and she provides extra blankets but we were warm and cozy. I'm grateful for such a positive first Airbnb experience! "
7714585,53219833,2015-11-06,16469231,Lanette,"Sabrina is an excellent and exceptionally friendly host and I felt warmly welcomed in her home during my stay in Seattle for work. Her home is a uniquely and pleasantly designed interior space, showcasing her creative talents and attention to detail. Not only are the accommodations comfortable, the living space downstairs creates a nice place to relax after a long day in town. Her place is  easily accessible to downtown Seattle via the bus line a half block away that runs every 15 minutes. I look forward to staying at Sabrina's place again!"
7714585,55215793,2015-11-29,15243796,Grant,"Well located a short bus ride to downtown,  and near all sorts of interesting places to explore. Eclectic and interesting decor inside, with a ton of personal touches. The helpful notes throughout the house along with the welcome message on the front door make it friendly and comfortable. The bed suffers from roll together if there are two of you."
6020744,30815810,2015-04-27,31183275,Kevin,The reservation was canceled 51 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6020744,33302410,2015-05-26,19446099,Brian,"The apartment was just as in the pictures. It was clean, comfortable, and at a great (email hidden)e location was perfect. It is walking distance from pretty much everything worth seeing and doing & if not just a $5 dollar uber ride away. I would definitely recommend staying here."
6020744,33846022,2015-06-01,12964922,Katherine,"Great vacation spot! The studio is clean, comfortable, and located in a nice neighborhood. Walking distance to lots of restaurants and downtown. Would definitely recommend it."
6020744,34430587,2015-06-08,5690230,Paul,"I had an amazing time in Seattle. There for a conference at the Washington State Conference Center. Could not have been a more perfect place to walk to everything. A short 3 block walk to the back door, upper levels of the conf center. The apt was new and clean and nicely furnished. The mattress is so comfortable. Just like mine at home. Austin has the best restaurant recommendations for the area and most within walking distance. Super cool neighborhood. "
6020744,34817863,2015-06-12,22883855,Lindsey,"Austin's place was perfect! Perfect location. Perfect welcome (Game of Thrones across the street, pizza to go for a late dinner, pie at a local favorite for dessert, genuinely nice people with great conversation!). This bnb will definitely be in my regular rotation. "
6020744,35086283,2015-06-15,31294208,Katie,Austin's place was great! Nice little studio with great amenities in a nice location. The super insulated windows blocked out 99% of the city/traffic noise. You're staying in a bustling part of the city though so noise is to be expected. Capitol Hill has excellent bars and restaurants and so much is in walking distance. 
6020744,36029211,2015-06-24,18977236,Jose,"Austin's place is awesome. It's a brand new studio, super clean and functional. Location couldn't be better, one can easily walk from Westlake center station with luggage and walking from his place to downtown and to other touristic attractions takes 20 minutes maximum. Going east, there's capitol hill, with its lively bars and restaurants, packed with people even on a monday. WiFi signal was strong and stable. Sheets and towels seemed new and were spotlessly clean and perfumed. The bed is comfortable and the shower has a great flow of water. Austin has apple TV and also a Bluetooth speaker. His furniture was one with very good taste. His mother checked me in and was very kind, providing me with helpful restaurants tips. They also left me a bottle of wine and two beers, great hosts! The only things missing are a table or counter for having meals, blackout curtains and air conditioning, it can get a little too warm (it was the beginning of summer). These are the only cons I could list. Overall, it's a great place and I would stay there again"
6020744,36323939,2015-06-27,5245185,Chris,"Austin responded very fast, was terrifically communicative, and helped get me on my way during booking ahead of my trip. On the day of my trip he put me in touch with his mother, Pamela, who could not have possibly been a nicer host while Austin was out of town on business. She helped guide me to the right location, made me feel welcome right away, and pointed me towards the best food and drink that Capitol Hill had to offer. 

The room is every bit as beautifully decorated as it looks - and it really feels like a home away from home while you're staying here. I worked downtown every day of my stay and there was a bikeshare stop just a couple blocks away I would use to coast my way downhill in the cool mornings, and then I would take the light rail back in the evenings.

Couldn't have been happier all the way around (great home, great neighborhood, great people!)"
6020744,36879997,2015-07-02,33568683,Francois,"Austin was quick to respond each time we communicated with him.  He had arrange for his mother, Pam, to greet us. She was very welcoming and gave us great tips about Seattle. The appartment was perfect for us as it was centraly located."
6020744,37868836,2015-07-11,27986888,David,Great host and Apartment as listed. Good internet /TV and all the Amenities you need. Great location on the doorstep of Capital Hill with great restaurants and bars. Easy 15 mins stroll down to Pike Place and the waterfront.
6020744,38174302,2015-07-13,3738174,Ravi,"Pam and Austin were very gracious hosts...chockfull of helpful information about Seattle's hot spots.  

The condo was very nice and close to a lot of fun bars and restaurants...and a few blocks walk to downtown...

If I'm back in Seattle...I'll definitely look this place up again.."
6020744,39172733,2015-07-21,29134050,Sabina,"The unit was exactly as pictured. Pamela met us and gave us lots of great recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. The building was conveniently located and we surely enjoyed our evenings in some of the local establishments. As for the unit itself, we happened to be there during an EXTREMELY hot weekend so we had to keep the windows open almost the whole time. As a result, it was very loud with all the traffic and street noise and the dogs at the dog park below. I would guess that this is not always the case though as normally the windows wouldn't need to remain open day and night.  

 I do wish we would have done our homework on the neighborhood. It is definitely an area in transition and there were surely some characters hanging out at night that gave us pause. It is a city of course, and maybe it is to be expected, but we were taken aback by the casual conversations undertaken by the fully nude dudes at 1am and the offers and request for rock on the corner. While I can't say we felt unsafe, the area felt gritty, particularly at night. 

Overall, our hosts were wonderful and we had no problems. With a warning about the neighborhood, we would recommend this place. "
6020744,39427298,2015-07-23,37721764,Deanna,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at Wade's studio. After a long trek in the Rockies we were glad we didn't have to walk far to get to everything.  Turn left to see the tourist destinations ending in Pikes Place Market with a short light rail ride to the EMP museum and space needle. Turn right to see the bars/restaurants/coffee shops that are more ""local"", cheaper, and genuine. 

Wade was very communicative and allowed us to check in around 11pm due to traveling. He met us and gave us the run down in 5 minutes and gave us some croissants. "
6020744,39654941,2015-07-25,17895044,Eric,"Our experience was very positive. Wade was a great host and easy to coordinate with on the key pick-up time. The apartment was exactly as pictured - it felt new, CLEAN and comfortable. The location was convenient, as there were a bunch of great restaurants, bars and cafés below. The walk to Capitol Hill was very short, and Uber pick-up times from here were always very short.

Wade was extremely inviting, and gave us some great advice on local spots to check out. We felt very comfortable and secure staying in his apartment.

My only comment we had was that the apartment is located just above I-5, and so there’s constant highway noise. This isn’t much of a problem in the cooler months, but with the windows open earplugs were required.
 
Overall, we would highly recommend this unit when visiting Seattle!
"
6020744,40737920,2015-08-02,19012639,Saben,"My family had a great experience at the apartment. The Apartment is as described and the roof deck was the highlight of the stay. They were great hosts and provided everything needed. When I have people visiting in the future, this will be the first place I look for availability. "
6020744,41158963,2015-08-04,39765154,Dave,"Neighborhood was great. Building was very nice with the roof view. Host provided a great list of restaurants and areas to see. It just needs air conditioning! The 2 fans were not enough! Other then that, it was a nice stay!"
6020744,42323352,2015-08-12,39752098,Joe,"Wades place in Seattle was very nice. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay in his studio apartment. It was very convenient and close to everything. We utilized uber to get around, and that made everything easy. Wades mother made check in very easy. I would definitely stay here again "
6020744,42699519,2015-08-15,36998866,Carrie,"Loved this awesome location with numerous coffee houses, bars and restaurants right outside the building.  The Starbucks Reserve roastery is like Disneyland for coffee lovers and that is right next door.  I was worried the freeway noise would be an issue but the fans and freeway create this perfect white noise so didn't notice it at all.  Jojo was very helpful throughout our stay.  Ideally DO NOT have a car staying here as parking is tight.  So much easier to take Uber anywhere we needed to go. "
6020744,43245007,2015-08-18,36142995,Janice,"The experience overall was fine. We were greeted by Wade's mother and she made sure we were settled into the unit nicely and offered recommendations on local activities and restaurants. The highlight of the unit was the rooftop deck, which has a fire pit and great nighttime views of the city.

We were a bit taken aback by the surroundings of the building. While it is conveniently close to Capitol Hill with great bars and restaurants, at night we saw people shooting up heroin near the building. Needless to say it was not an ideal environment to be in.

The apartment itself was good and nicely decorated, though it could use air conditioning. There are fans available but they are not enough to keep the space comfortably cool. Keeping the windows open helps but with the freeway right there, it can get awfully loud.

Also, there are no toiletries provided, so make sure to pack your own."
6020744,44110504,2015-08-24,12340621,Jordan,"Yes, I worked with Wade and his mom, JoJo. They were very responsive and the stay was fantastic. Highly recommend! "
6020744,44689186,2015-08-28,22591985,Ajit,"JoJo was so helpful with our stay in Seattle, offering us a meticulously curated list of sites to visit, all of which were spot on. She helped us get situated in the apartment and was very kind. I would stay there again! "
6020744,45243469,2015-09-01,4060362,Kate,"Wade was a fantastic host. His lovely apartment is perfectly situated near downtown, and was clean and easy to access. Would absolutely stay here again! Thanks for a great weekend, Wade."
6020744,45723643,2015-09-05,13197568,Dave & Cristina,"We had a fantastic stay here in Seattle!  Jojo and Wade went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. The day we arrived we found that the internet was out. They immediately bought a new router and set it up that same day!  Jojo even bought us some goodies from Starbucks because she felt bad : )

About the apartment: impeccably clean and cozy with a great view. It's in a great location  - close to lots of great restaurants, bars, and cool little coffee shops. Would definitely stay here again!!"
6020744,47247801,2015-09-17,5555483,David,"Initially we were concerend that we were getting only minimal information from our host.  However, on our arrival as wwe stepped out of teh cab we were given very helpful giudance: where to go, where not to go, which were best coffee shops, restaurants, bookshop.  IT turns out that wiht in 100 metres of the site are at least 6 great place to eat including an extraordinary StarBucks - a tourist attraction inits own right The apartment was small and wwe could not operate teh Apple TV ho host offered to come and coach us. Some more saucepans would have been good too.  A serious concern however was the noise level night and day from the expressway - so much so we contemplated moving out.
"
6020744,48009530,2015-09-22,42086263,Anthony,"This unit was exactly as it looks in the pictures, nicely furnished & decorated. The location and view are fantastic as far as getting around Capital Hill & DT. Jojo & Wade are excellant hosts, even providing us Seattle newbies with great recommendations for the local eats & drinks. That being said, it is a little too close to the freeway for my taste, like right above it, Forget about opening up a window to unwind & enjoy some fresh air. Also, the full bed is a bit small for two average sized adults. My bf's legs hung off the bed and he's 5'10"". All in all, we had a great stay, and would definitely recommend this space to anyone, with these two caveats. The in-unit washer & dryer are also a great plus. We washed prior to packing & arrived home with no dirty clothes. "
6020744,49014947,2015-09-30,41753556,Lindsey,"We had such a great time staying at Wade's place. The apartment and the neighborhood are lovely. Meeting with Wade to get the keys he sat down with us and gave us a giant list of places to eat, get coffee, things to do around town. I really felt like he genuinely cared about us having a great time in Seattle. I'm going to miss waking up to that view and the white noise of the city lulling me to sleep. Thanks again Wade!"
6020744,49919351,2015-10-07,44215768,Joseph,The place was great! Clean and good location to walk around the city. Apartment was perfect.
6020744,50292971,2015-10-11,40618088,Nick,"Nice modern space with plenty of room. Great view of downtown. Location was perfect. Plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. Walkable to a lot of the tourist areas. Building was very safe too. Only gripe would be if you're a taller couple like my girlfriend and I, the bed was a pretty tight fit. "
6020744,50797487,2015-10-14,1792470,Joshua,"Wade's studio was great and perfectly located for exploring the city. 
It was very clean and comfortable as well with fantastic views of the Seattle skyline. 
I highly recommend this listing!"
6020744,51625328,2015-10-22,44031874,Julie,"We were pleasantly surprised when our host greeted us personally and went over all of the details of our accommodations. Besides that, she provided us with lists of the best places to visit, fantastic coffee houses, and great restaurants. She also had transportation tips. Everything we did off of the lists was perfect, and the lists also saved us time figuring things out. It was nice having a refrigerator, large screen tv, and a terrific view (floor to ceiling glass) of Seattle. This is as good as it gets!"
6020744,52963871,2015-11-03,1390383,Cj,"What a fantastic place to stay! Excellent location, clean and modern with comfy bed, awesome view, and awesome host who will give you all of the best recommendations in town. Noise is not really an issue if you are a city person. Highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle. Less than 10 min walk to tram to airport (for only $3)! "
6020744,58725117,2016-01-03,7454403,Finley,"Wade and his mom, JoJo, were fantastic hosts, giving me everything I needed for the perfect stay!  The apartment is easy to access (right in the middle of Capitol Hill, which is fantastic, but also walking distance to downtown-- the location is literally perfect) and the view is incredible.  It's modernly furnished and I loved it."
4236723,21188096,2014-10-12,646435,Christopher,We were the first people to visit this very centrally located space near Ballard. They did all they could to get it ready in time for our arrival.
4236723,21254969,2014-10-13,20546221,Brian,"Upon our arrival, we intended to simply drop off our bags and head out again. We were greeted pleasantly, and showed around the home. Chris gave us a brief history of the home, and recommended a few places to visit. When we returned from our gallivanting, we found a plate of freshly baked cookies waiting for us on the kitchen counter.  "
4236723,21313275,2014-10-14,21841412,Stacy,Chris was an excellent host. The house was just as described and with nice touches to make us feel at home. The neighborhood is excellent and a perfect place to stay if you want to relax or sight see in Seattle. Chris was communicative and very pleasant to work with. We're already trying to plan when we can stay there again! 
4236723,21543221,2014-10-19,1507267,Lee,"A charming home away from home! My husband and I stayed there for two nights with our 4-month-old baby and my parents. We didn't get to spend much time at the house, but it was nice to relax there in the evenings. The house is in a great location in an interesting neighborhood, and Chris was a very responsive and accommodating host. There were cookies waiting for us when we arrived, as well as snacks, drinks and condiments in the kitchen, and a co-sleeper for the baby. The beds were comfortable and the linens nice and soft. We all slept well both nights -- even the baby! "
4236723,21844457,2014-10-25,1281851,Emily,"Chris was a wonderful host! Right from the moment we landed in Seattle we had great communication with him. The house is a perfect blend of old, weathered historic building, chic and bohemian décor (great art!), and comfort. We didn't get a chance to use the kitchen, but it was lovely.
The neighborhood is also pretty special. Highly recommend walking to cafe Besalu for pastries in the morning.
Thanks for a great first visit to Seattle!
"
4236723,21990900,2014-10-27,22405100,Candice,We stayed one night at the Ballard Bunkhouse and it was a wonderful experience. The house was clean and a perfect location. We walked to the Ballard area bars and had an amazing time. Chris was very attentive and helpful. He made our stay pleasant. We will definitely be staying there again on out next trip to Seattle. 
4236723,22202361,2014-11-01,8321370,Kara,"This wonderful, quaint, little historic home was the perfect base for exploring Seattle! The location was close to the city with easy access via car or public transit, and within walking distance to cute shops and restaurants in Ballard. Chris was an excellent host, providing for all our requests while respecting our privacy. We arrived later than planned to the heat on and a cute bed for our pup. We would definitely stay again when we next visit Seattle!"
4236723,22572354,2014-11-09,23043940,Laura,We arrived late into seattle as we travelled in from kelowna after work.  Chris was very considerate and set up the hideabed and a crib for my nephew for us.  There were cookies and snacks nicely laid out to welcome us as well.   The apartment was clean and comfortable.  I found it to be a little cold at this time of year so I might suggest to bring Jammie's but overall we had a very good stay.  There is street parking but the street is very narrow and crowded... Perhaps ask about alternative parking in advance. :)
4236723,22636559,2014-11-10,23418137,Brittney,"Chris was so accommodating! He was very prompt with returning my messages, was flexible and understanding about check out time, and made us feel very comfortable. There were cookies waiting for us when we arrived and we loved the space! The beds were very comfortable, the house was well appointed, and we essentially just wanted to stay in the giant jacuzzi bathtub. Our stay was short but lovely and we would highly recommend this location to others!"
4236723,23159503,2014-11-24,13426094,Austin,"Chris was an amazing host - always making sure that all of the little things were taken care of - bottles of water, thermostat temps, snacks, clean linens ... A wonderful home in a great neighborhood! You can't go wrong with this place. Thanks so much, Chris!"
4236723,23286820,2014-11-27,5364158,Nikki,Chris was a perfect host we hope to stay here again next time we are in Ballard. 
4236723,23524768,2014-12-03,10434012,Elizabeth,"We had a great stay here in Ballard! The location is excellent and the house is comfortable and historically cool. The tub is sweet. We stayed four nights, a group meeting up from Alaska and North Carolina for a family get together in Seattle. Nice location to stay because you can walk down to the restaurants/businesses/grocery stores in Ballard. Chris was a great host and came over late one night due to a plumbing issue and dealt with it quickly and kindly. Everything you need is at the house and your host will help you find anything you need or want to know about the area/city. "
4236723,23774669,2014-12-09,7678499,Kimberly,"We had an incredible time staying at Chris' place.  The apartment has so much character which we loved.  Some previous guests had mentioned  in reviews that they were cold but we were very comfortable (I guess Chris has added another heater and it really works!).  The location is great, Ballard is a wonderful neighborhood.  We lived that there was parking in the alley and we also had very little trouble finding street parking during our stay.  Chris left snacks and pantry items for our arrival which was helpful and the kitchen is fully stocked if you like to cook (like me).  We enjoyed spending time with him and his son :)  Thanks for everything, we highly recommend this place!! "
4236723,24013506,2014-12-16,884641,Lindsay,"My friends and I had a wonderful stay at the Bunkhouse! It was charming, clean, and exactly as described. Ballard is a great neighborhood with plenty of bars, restaurants, and a supermarket within walking distance of the apartment. Although we did not get a chance to meet Chris, he was a consumate host. We greatly appreciated his willingness to accommodate our changing check-in and check-out times, and he thoughtfully set out a dog bed for our pooch. Very good communicator with a quick response time as well. We would definitely book again!"
4236723,24256996,2014-12-23,24390731,Yangyang,it is good
4236723,24428501,2014-12-28,212841,Linda,"Chris, Thank you for a wonderful respite for my folks and I. The bunkhouse was just as advertised, and very warm and comfortable. The location was perfect for exploring Ballard, and it was easy to get into downtown Seattle from there. Most of all, I really appreciate how available you were to answer my questions and solve any issues that arose. Have a great New Year!
"
4236723,24641088,2015-01-01,22131451,Angela,"Chris was very communicative and was very easy to reach. He made sure the house was warmed for us and that we had everything we needed. It was a nice plus to have a stocked pantry and extra toiletries available. The place heats up nicely and parking is also a nice plus. The house is a bit creeky (built in 1901) and is definitely one that has been extensively renovated. Expect a mish-mash of old and new furniture, but overall, a cozy place to stay. One thing to note: the indoor jet tub is very large (80 gallons) and the hot water tank is smaller than that. So, if you are looking to fill up the tank in one go, expect a warm experience. It takes about 25 minutes for the hot water to ""recharge."""
4236723,24781148,2015-01-02,19789930,David,I booked a stay at Chris's Ballard bunk house but was unable to make it for the trip. Chris was really understanding and helpful and made it so my friends were still able to stay there. They said that they really enjoyed their stay. I will definitely book with Chris again 
4236723,25583795,2015-01-19,5391274,Sylvia,"The host was very responsive to all our communications. He offered early check in since no one had stayed the night before, and again offered late check out. On our arrival we found a large box of chocolates welcomed us. Parking was very limited on the street in front, but there was private parking in back that accommodated our two vehicles, a small SUV and large crew cab truck. Linens were clean and fresh and our stay was pleasant. All in all a very good value."
4236723,25717590,2015-01-24,16625345,Alex,"My group had a pleasant stay in Chris' Ballard Bunkhouse. The location is excellent - a quick walk to the heart of Ballard - and the house was well-equipped. Although the house could use some updating, we had a very comfortable stay. "
4236723,25893984,2015-01-28,16671078,Ariane,The bunkhouse is warm and inviting with charm and history. I love the showerhead(s) and the tall high ceilings with sky lights. 
4236723,26304541,2015-02-09,22331623,Claudia,"This space was perfect for our group of five: it is just as advertised, no surprises. We’re getting to be more seasoned airbnb users and here’s what matters: location (and parking), a warm and clean space with good beds, good linen (including enough towels and good pillows), more than one bathroom, and of  course, hot water (in a warm bathroom). And, it turns out, a well-equipped kitchen matters when we’re travelling as a group. 

This place has all of the above, along with an accessible and responsive host who managed our expectations well. We were happy here, and we’ll be back."
4236723,26678576,2015-02-17,7094883,Andrea,"The home was in a great location but we were a little disappointed in the house itself.  While we understand that the house is old and that is part of it's charm, we were not prepared for peeling and mismatched paint in the bathroom, door trim that fell off every time you walked by and really, really squeaky beds.  The sound of people upstairs coming in at midnight was incredibly loud and none of us slept too well the first night.  Chris was very sweet to leave a history of the house, chocolates and coffee but I would not stay here again."
4236723,26897400,2015-02-21,2380343,Katie,Great location in Ballard neighborhood. Walkable to bars and restaurants but the house is quiet at night. I was able to speak to Chris upon my arrival and he was very helpful giving me suggestions for food in the neighborhood. Very kind host! 
4236723,27458042,2015-03-05,13426094,Austin,"This was my second stay at the Ballard Bunkhouse, and it was great. Chris added a heater in the breakfast nook area, and it helped keep the whole unit nice and toasty. The pantry and fridge were stocked with some goodies and food, and plenty of fresh towels and linens. Great location, walkable to a number of great places in downtown Ballard."
4236723,28064653,2015-03-16,9815401,Shannon,I loved Staying at the Bunkhouse it had everything you could need and more. And Chris was great and accommodating with our last minute planning. Thank you so much Chris! We will be back soon! 
4236723,28153320,2015-03-18,29352212,Oscar,"We arrived a bit early and we had the pleasure to meet Chris, he made us feel welcomed and answer all of our questions about the house. The house has a lot of historical value and much of its deco and feel is being preserved by Chris. Be prepared for sliding wood doors, a grandma rocker chair, and a tile curtainless tub.  The location was great within 10 minutes of downtown, parking was good with 1 dedicated parking spot and plenty street parking. There was a little of noise transfer from upstairs but nothing too loud. There was enough kitchenware for everyone plus a K brewing machine. The washer and dryer was useful to us. "
4236723,28365763,2015-03-22,29542188,Murray," It was comfortable and fairly quiet, in an old house sort of way. (It doesn't have the muffled quiet of a big motel.) it would be an especially nice place to stay if you wanted to be there for several days, able to relax and prepare as many of your own meals as you (website hidden) in every room, making it easy to share space with others. 
Be sure to pay attention to the detail that you can park behind the house. Otherwise, parking is scarce. "
4236723,28386243,2015-03-23,21897527,Rhonda,Chris was there when we arrived and went over everything we needed to know about the house. It was absolutely perfect other than the fact that we were so busy with our event that we weren't able to spend more time there. This property is one that I highly recommend!!
4236723,29256211,2015-04-06,623093,Mike,"Ballard Bunkhouse was a nice place to stay for our group of 6.

We appreciated Chris's thoughtful and well placed notes and instructions; and his timely and welcoming e-mails.

The unit makes maximum use of its modest size with comfortable queen beds, luxury bedding, a beautiful leather sectional and comfortable pull-out sleeper in the living room.  The kitchen was well equipped with snacks, breakfast foods, cold drinks, gourmet coffee and condiments.

2 off street parking spots in back were nice in this parked-up neighborhood.

There was not really enough room for a comfortable sit down meal.

Overall, a nice mix of comfortable and funky.  We would stay there again, especially since our friends live only a few blocks away."
4236723,29591459,2015-04-09,524198,Dan,Loved staying here!
4236723,29682199,2015-04-11,26484375,Andrew,"Great location and convenient off street parking. Lots of space and easy walk to coffee shops and nightlife, would certainly stay here again.   "
4236723,29807499,2015-04-12,6816390,Jules,Fantastic stay. Really communicative. Highly recommended
4236723,29958880,2015-04-14,30975544,Scott,"Chris made us feel very welcome in this great heritage home. He set up it just to suit our needs and the place worked out perfectly.
Highly recommend."
4236723,30058996,2015-04-16,9075714,Ben,"Chris's place was perfect for our trip. Walk to Ballard, close to downtown...it was great!"
4236723,30314117,2015-04-20,27056739,Eric,"Felt instantly welcomed with little snacks on the counter, and a comfy house. Way to go Chris. Appreciate the hospitality. "
4236723,30537286,2015-04-23,17556378,Christin,"We had a great time at the bunkhouse - everything was perfect & comfortable! We especially loved the neighborhood, the stocked cabinets (for a late night snack) & the amazing linens. Thanks Chris for accommodating us last minute! "
4236723,30749050,2015-04-26,17676243,Stephen,"We booked at the last minute (day of!), and the house was ready for us on short notice with a stocked pantry, cold beverages, and a welcome note! Very clean, nice kitchen, appreciated the wifi and multiple televisions. Nice quiet neighborhood near the heart of Ballard. We were glad for the alley parking as street parking was hard to come by."
4236723,30840065,2015-04-27,3811127,Amy,Everything as described.   Chris was greatt
4236723,31314152,2015-05-04,29128350,Jacob,"We felt very welcome at the house. Chris was there when we arrived and gave us a brief overview of the house. The neighborhood was a perfect home base for our Seattle weekend. The house is located very close to the Ballard area bars, restaurants and breweries. The kitchen is pretty well equipped and stocked with some snacks and quick meal supplies. A great place to stay if you are looking to see Seattle."
4236723,31980827,2015-05-12,26372409,Michele,"Chris made all of us feel so welcome.   The neighborhood was perfectly quiet, charming, and yet still so close to all the downtown Ballard energy at the same time.  With two bedrooms, a perfectly ample kitchen, and a comfortable seating area, it was so well suited to our needs.  Lots of personal touches... a return visit is definitely in order!     "
4236723,32216044,2015-05-15,17777621,Joseph,"Chris was a stellar host, very helpful with my questions, and extremely responsive with communication. Thank you!"
4236723,32335690,2015-05-17,29471239,Cindy,"Chris is a wonderful host - very engaged and responsive.  We were ""greeted"" with chocolate, flowers and a welcome note.  And were encouraged to reach out to him at any time with questions and/or concerns.  The home is in a nice and quiet neighborhood, walking distance to restaurants and shops in Ballard. The home is older but  charming with some nice upgrades. It was clean and welcoming. We appreciated the off street parking spot in the back.  "
4236723,32556561,2015-05-19,31531724,Cody,"The house was excellent!  Chris left some chocolate and a card on the counter, which was a nice touch, and plenty of water and soda in the fridge.  The instant booking was great, he responded right after booking and everything went as smooth as possible.  A word about the parking in the back, I was driving a full size suv, and the spot didn't look big enough to accommodate it without blocking the alley.  Luckily I found street parking right next to the house.  All in all a great experience!"
4236723,32859009,2015-05-22,4273729,Alice,"We had such a great time at the Ballard Bunkhouse! Chris left us snacks and drinks on check-in and made everything really easy. 

The location is great - we were able to walk to food and parks with our two-year-old in tow and really enjoyed wandering around the neighborhood. "
4236723,33258893,2015-05-26,22844941,Madison,"We had a great experience at this unit! Everything was easy in terms of accessing the house, all necessary toiletries were available too. House was well kept and clean! Very much appreciated for a great stay!"
4236723,34314152,2015-06-07,1287114,Mia,"Thank you Chris!! Chris was an amazing host. He went well above and beyond to make us comfortable - he extended his deck, installed a tiny ramp, and took the doors off the bathroom to accommodate my husband who uses a wheelchair. And, he did so voluntarily and with grace. We're truly thankful and impressed. We had a great time at the bunkhouse for a week with our 3 year old son. It's wonderfully located in Ballard. 
The house and furnishings are historic and vintage-y. Chris has done a great job of preserving the historic character of the place while still having nice amenities (new fridge, range/oven, TVs, wifi, leather pull-out couch, Keurig) along with the older wooden furniture. We were even able to host some friends for dinner. The kitchen is not a chef's kitchen (BYO olive oil, spices, sharp knives etc.) but he stocked the pantry for us with other goodies (mac n'cheese and snacky stuff) and we took full advantage. We had a wonderful time and can't say enough good things about Chris and his cool historic bunkhouse. "
4236723,34874302,2015-06-13,25960267,Malvin,The place had a perfect location in Ballard. We particularly enjoyed our easy morning walks to old Ballard for some of the best coffee in Seattle. We did not have a chance to meet Chris (he stopped by but we were not there) but he went above and beyond to make us feel welcomed. The house was very clean and stocked with everything we needed and more.  
4236723,35062249,2015-06-15,22244315,Patti,"We had a great weekend in the Ballard Bunkhouse. The home was clean, furnished with unique period pieces, yet had all the amenities we needed (the coffee drinkers esp liked the Keurig). The beds were Very comfortable. The bunkhouse is so convenient to Ballard-we walked to the locks, had a drink and dinner in a cool Thai place on the way back and to the grocery store the next day. I wish we had more time to explore but had a graduation to attend. Chris was very responsive when we thought we had an issue (I was wrong). We would definitely consider the bunkhouse next time we are in Seattle. "
4236723,35305696,2015-06-17,29300121,Sabrena,"This was my first time using Airbnb - Thank you to Chris for allowing us to add to 2 extra people to our original plan of 5 for a total of 7.  The house is good for 4 or 6.  If you have that many it can get tight with all the suitcases.  We took the long side table under the TV and set it up on the back porch for dinner. This gave us the time to just enjoy each others company, have dessert and talk late into the evening.   The neighborhood is quiet but the streets are narrow with people parking on both sides.  Only one car at a time traveling between.  No air conditioning but the fans kept it cool and Chris is putting in AC soon.  There is parking in the back to avoid the stairs in the front, this was good for us because 1 person in our party couldn't climb stairs.  The house built in 1901 is a work in progress.  I would like to see it when everything is finished."
4236723,35570023,2015-06-20,7862198,Kera,"Chris was an awesome host! Very friendly, helpful and humorous.  There were snacks and beverages in the kitchen. All beds had freshly washed linens and were very comfy. The place easily accommodated our group of 5 and was a quick 10 minute drive to downtown. The Ballard neighbourhood was also a fun place to hangout!  It was a very comfortable and homey place to stay with all the amenities you could possibly need. Thanks for the wonderful visit!"
4236723,35905619,2015-06-23,12236839,Djorf,The Ballard bunkhouse is in a wonderful part of Seattle. So many options in the neighborhood. Chris is extremely accommodating and hospitable!  The pantry and fridge were stocked and he left a very nice welcome letter! The place itself is very comfortable. Well done Chris!
4236723,36205799,2015-06-26,20675180,Andrea,"We enjoyed our stay at the Ballard Bunkhouse.  Chris has furnished the interior with a mix of period and modern items to achieve a balance between the building's historical character and comfort.  He went to great lengths make us feel welcome.  We arrived early and he showed us around before the official check-in (we then went to Golden Shores park until the house was ready for us).  He left a range of drinks and snacks (including chocolate!) and other packaged food items in case the need arose.  We made good use of the outdoor seating area and new deck, which will be even better when fully finished.  There is some sound transference from the upper level guest accommodations, which usually wasn't much of an issue.  The house is conveniently located a short walk from the Ballard restaurant district, and we enjoyed trying some of them and checking out the nearby botanical garden, locks, and fish ladder.  Great location for exploring a new area of Seattle we hadn't seen before.  The allocated parking is very helpful."
4236723,36366886,2015-06-28,92542,Jaime,Chris took very good care of us. His home is in a beautiful neighborhood. 
4236723,36530450,2015-06-29,30856713,Karen,"It started out great, but I would never stay here again. Cute and in a great location. Good communication leading up to reservation and Chris even has snacks out for guests. He also allowed us to check out at noon instead of 10am, which was nice. The space accommodated two couples perfectly. I had friends in from out of town to celebrate in the city for my 40th birthday. We hung out on the porch for about a half hour before leaving for the night. Chris stopped by and chatted with us, mentioning that he had been working on the shower and the bathroom had flooded earlier in the day (we didn't think anything of that at the time). We returned at around 1am, and my husband and I fell asleep right away in the larger bedroom. My friends, however, had an awful experience. When they went to go to bed, there was a very strong odor and they finally figured out that it was coming from the rug under the bed and dresser. Part of it was soaking wet, and had a very strong smell of dog urine. They had to lift the bed and dresser to get the rug out, and they said it was really gross. It had soaked through to the hardwood floor, so the room still smelled really bad even after they put the rug outside. My friends did not sleep well at all. Even with the window and door open, they had to sleep with the covers over their face. Chris definitely said to contact him day or night with any concerns. Unfortunately, I was the one who had his contact info since I handled the rental, and this birthday girl was already out for the night. I felt terribly when I woke up the next morning and heard what had happened, especially since this was our first airbnb experience, and it was my idea. I could definitely still smell the odor, and it was bad. Things happen though, and none of us were upset with Chris at that point. It seemed pretty obvious that the bathroom flood had leaked into the bedroom (attached to the bathroom) and released previous dog urine stains from prior renters. I'm sure the hot weather didn't help. What was really disappointing was Chris's response. We asked for a credit and Chris declined. He felt that we were in the wrong for not contacting him in the middle of the night, and noted that there was a couch that could have been used. He also suggested that maybe we had actually stepped in dog poop and that was the issue. That was pretty shocking after what we had described to him, and was honestly offensive. His parting words to me were, ""At the end of the stay when you've already asked for a late checkout to ask for a credit after you've eaten the steak is the wrong time to send it back."" "
4236723,37354752,2015-07-06,609499,Eric,"Our stay in Ballard was exactly what we were looking for. The location was perfect - quiet and safe but easy walk to the action. Chris was a communicative and welcoming host. We had space to entertain for a few friends and had restful sleep. We'd definitely stay here again when in the NW!
"
4236723,37564989,2015-07-08,7285375,Peter,"Easily the most welcome we have ever felt while traveling. Chris makes you feel at home and provides plenty of amenities which are great for making the transition smooth.

Wonderful space and would definitely book again!"
4236723,37660965,2015-07-09,34068382,Evgeny,"A fun place with a mix of modern updates and old character. Our group of 6 was quite comfortable throughout. The 1.5 bathrooms were great for larger groups. The fridge was stocked with beverages, and there is a crackers/granola plate as well that was very handy for our groups early morning travel plans. The parking spot in the back made me feel at ease with my rental car. The place was very clean when we arrived and Chris left some very useful information near the kitchen. If you want to explore the neighborhood of Ballard with your friends this is a fantastic accommodation to do just that. Highly recommended."
4236723,37974384,2015-07-12,33231365,Mike,"Staying at Chris's home in Ballard was a wonderful first introduction to Airbnb. Chris and his partner were thoughtful and gracious hosts. We came with two small children and they worked hard to accommodate our needs. We had a great time! The home is older but in a great neighborhood within comfortable walking distance of lots of shopping and eating. 15 minutes from downtowns Seattle as well. If we come back, we are staying here again!"
4236723,38157222,2015-07-13,35713982,Sean,"We had an amazing time at the Ballard Bunkhouse.  We traveled with our two kids and my mother for the weekend in Ballard.  Chris was there to greet us and made extra space for us to park our two cars.  The condo was very clean, had all the extras you could want with comfortable beds.  Loved how close it was to all the fun stuff in Ballard.  Once we parked the car we walked everywhere we wanted to go for the weekend.   We will be back!"
4236723,38259080,2015-07-14,11396501,Danell,"Chris was easy to communicate with and made us feel welcome.  He left snacks and goodies to eat in the kitchen, which was well stocked.  The house worked out perfect for our family.  We loved the location because you could walk in to town. "
4236723,38469897,2015-07-15,1523596,Alex,"Chris is amazing! My husband and I were on a last minute road trip to Vancouver and didn't know when we would be staying in Seattle. It was not till the day of that my husband started looking. Within minutes Chris responded to our booking letting us know how excited he was for our visit. We met with him briefly when we arrived and it was immediately apparent Chris is just one of those people with an warm personality and big heart. The place was exactly as shown. What really set this place apart from other stays were all the little touches around the home that make you feel welcome. There were plenty of linens to use for that HUGE tub! And he left a bowl of snacks and candies that made us feel special, and cold bottled water in the fridge. After nearly 1,000 miles of driving, arriving at Ballard Bunkhouse was the first time we felt at ease and ready to relax.  "
4236723,38562043,2015-07-16,22241535,Taylor,"Really laid back and easy. A bit noisy with the upstairs neighbors but otherwise super wonderful experience. We were welcome by a charming note and chocolates - great touch! Also, plenty of snacks and a yard for our pups. "
4236723,38725197,2015-07-18,23491464,Kyle,"No complaints here. Chris was a great host! I needed a place for family and friends to stay for my brother's wedding, so we rented the whole house. Chris was flexible on the checkout time since no one had booked the previous night, which helped out. When we arrived, the house was clean and he had laid out some packs of cookies and peppermint patties, which were all eaten promptly.

Chris even helped with a mid-trip request that he clean our sheets and towels because some of the guests were leaving after the first night and being replaced by a new group, and I wasn't going to be around to do it myself. He took care of it for us, which really makes a difference on a short trip when you're trying to maximize your time with friends and family.

Overall great experience. I'd definitely stay here again!"
4236723,39560346,2015-07-24,24749646,华,虽然这次入住没有见到Chris，但他准备了亲手撰写的欢迎卡片，并热心答复我相关咨询。房屋是始建于20世纪初的独栋建筑，并准备了丰富的饮料、调味品和厨房用品。我们在此享用了一顿丰盛的早餐。非常难忘的一次入住体验！
4236723,40193013,2015-07-29,23543583,Brian,Charming place in a great neighborhood. Lives up to the description. 
4236723,40411196,2015-07-30,6774421,Nicole,"The location was fantastic. Convenient, and a great neighborhood. Bunkhouse was clean, comfortable, and really lovely. The host was quick to get back to us when we had questions. It was a quick trip, but everything was really great. "
4236723,40545727,2015-07-31,20042361,Refoel,"Even better than the pictures, if you could imagine that! Large, lit home that maintains a warmth and coziness while still giving a luxurious better-than-5-star experience. We felt very comfortable and welcome during our stay. The Bunkhouse is in a fantastic neighborhood, only a couple blocks from great restaurants, cafes and sunset views. My only regret is that we didn't stay here during the whole trip to Seattle! Highly recommend. "
4236723,40901129,2015-08-03,12880292,Helen,"This is a great place to stay - very accommodating host, the apartment is exactly as it appears in pictures, and a great price.  Chris also goes out of his way to provide snacks, drinks, and recommendations for places to visit in the neighborhood."
4236723,41931575,2015-08-10,31114683,Justin,The house was very nice and filled with goodies and snacks. The only downside n my opinion was the fact the knives were not very sharp so it made cooking kinda difficult.
4236723,42304313,2015-08-12,29468683,Paige,"Chris was an amazing host from the moment we booked our stay through to our departure! His replies were impressively fast, he went above and beyond to accommodate us 6 girls and our requests, had a greeting card and some chocolate waiting for our arrival and even though he was sick, he still kept in touch with us and was accessible day and night for any concerns we may have had. We were all VERY impressed! All of us would highly recommend this cute bunkhouse as it has a little bit of everything for everyone. It's close to down town Seattle, yet it's located on a nice quiet street. There are two bathrooms, the kitchen is spacious, there are lots of ways to adjust the temperature and customize the surroundings to your liking, the desk is a nice place to sit and relax and there was parking available and the check-in/check-put process was smooth and easy!"
4236723,43235986,2015-08-18,7659283,Ryan,"Chris was very kind and had a great sense of humour. We arrived a little early and he was doing a little maintenance work, but still welcomed us in the house giving us a chance to ask questions about the area. And what a great location for a house, a short and lovely walk to the best shops, restaurants, and pubs on Market and Ballard. The bunkhouse has plenty of space, lots of seating, a great kitchen, and good parking for my full size truck in the back. The house was clean and comfortable, and since it over a 100 years old, there is the odd spot that has a rattle or loose floorboard, but that is more charming than anything! Thanks for the great stay Chris!"
4236723,43577123,2015-08-20,11059526,Michael,"Only a one night stay as we were transiting home from a college tour but comfortable sleep after 2week road trip.
Thanks for the easy stay."
4236723,44412513,2015-08-26,33603226,Deanna,"Chris was a great host. The house is super cute and we had everything we needed.

It was nice to have 2 toilets, a full kitchen and outdoor patio. We will definitely stay here again next time we are in town!"

I had no trouble finding the location and the free parking in the back was awesome. The fridge had drinks and the coffee was fully stocked. what more could you need? the beds were super comfortable and soft. the best part about this listing is the bath tub. jacuzzi jets and big enough for two; the best way to end a night out exploring Ballard! I highly recommend this listing to everyone and anyone. I'll be using this home to house my family in the future for sure! "
4236723,45762777,2015-09-06,25644835,Julie,Great location. Chris was very kind and was very communicative before and during our stay. We enjoyed our time at the bunkhouse.

4236723,46941877,2015-09-14,20917336,Geraldine,"Chris did a wonderful job of making us feel welcome. He made sure we were very informed on arrangements before arrival, making everything very simple and seamless. Upon arrival the bunkhouse was clean, well-appointed and welcoming. It had everything we could have needed. We were greeted with a note of welcome and some chocolate--which made our arrival all that much sweeter. We loved the bath in particular!  When we left, Chris found something we had left behind and has been kind enough to arrange its return--going well above and beyond the call of duty!"
4236723,47211735,2015-09-16,19656902,Josef,"The Ballard Bunkhouse is an awesome spot. The host, Chris, is incredible and with unparalleled hospitality. We asked for some suggestions upon arrival, things to do and places to eat, and Chris delivered. The suggestions, albeit strange, were perfect and we had a blast.

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and extend many thanks to Chris. I highly recommend the Ballard Bunkhouse. "

4236723,47702241,2015-09-21,29380005,Deirdre,"The house was perfect for 5 people. The place itself has lots of charm and a nice area to sit out back. All the extras we needed during our stay (towels, pillows, hair dryer, etc) were easily accessible. We were also able to push the checkout time back a hour or so which was much needed! "
4236723,48639048,2015-09-27,38854868,Carla,"Chris was wonderful via message prior to arrival, accommodating and gracious. The space itself was clean, inviting and comfortable. My friends and I loved staying here. The snacks, drinks and thoughtful touches made us feel at home and welcomed. :)"

Chris was great to work with and gladly accommodated our request for a later check out. The personalized note and snacks were a nice touch. Chris goes out of his way to make sure that all who stay enjoy themselves and want to come back."
4236723,49068776,2015-09-30,36643351,Martine,Logement bien placé dans un quartier agréable.
4236723,49353545,2015-10-03,28525733,Rachel,Love this place! It was easy and perfect. And it's has some history to it that is really cool. 
4236723,49610256,2015-10-05,11374473,Juliana,"Chris was a great host! Prompt at responding and very thoughtful (he remembered I was bringing my newborn and left a crib for her).  He provided great coffee, snacks and drinks which were refilled each day.  The place was clean, had comfortable beds and best of all in a charming, walkable location in Ballard.  "
4236723,49963740,2015-10-07,45467829,Edward,Great Place and he even had a Toblerone! My favorite chocolate. Keep it up Chris.
4236723,50629384,2015-10-13,7580088,Penni,Great getaway and close to historic Ballard.
4236723,51256682,2015-10-18,6331724,Laurel,"Our stay at the Bunkhouse was perfect. The house is beautiful and has been lovingly restored. We felt extremely welcome and the house is well stocked with supplies and local information. The location is excellent, you can walk around Ballard and there are great local cafes and breweries. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom is fantastic, plan some time for a bath!  "
4236723,51351242,2015-10-19,2609077,Lila,"Cute little place.  We had a wonderful time.  Kitchen, bathroom, bedrooms are all fully stocked.  Great find."
4236723,51515836,2015-10-20,6226355,Kimberly,"Great location, close to Capitol Hill, and great restaurants. House was very upscale but with lots of unique charm. I loved the bathroom (the jetted tub and massaging shower head) and the deck were especially nice. The house was roomy and perfect for our group. Chris left us coffee and chocolate which was really thoughtful. Construction next door woke us up early but that will probably be finished soon."
4236723,52063767,2015-10-26,22331623,Claudia,"This is our second visit—a group of friends in Seattle for an event. We chose to go back here because: the space and location are perfect for us, the host is accommodating and responsive, there’s easy parking and ground-level entry, it’s warm and comfortable, there’s a full kitchen (a must), the 1.5 bathrooms make it possible to function as a group, and overall, our collective experience was great the first time, and great the second time. Thanks Chris! "
4236723,52663288,2015-10-31,26312861,Scott,Chris house was a beautiful quiet place exactly what we needed after a gig. Had condiments and a great note to go along with it welcoming us. 5 out of 5!
4236723,52905733,2015-11-02,47069152,Benjamin,"This place was as advertised and even more! This lovely home had every amenity we needed with plenty of space for our family of four. It felt luxurious to have this whole home to go to in the wonderful and historic neighborhood of Ballard in Seattle. The Toblerone and hand written card were an amazing touch! Our favorite part was the extremely well written booklet with the history of the home and the Ballard neighborhood. It's a short walk from tons of fun restaurants, bars, and (my personal favorite) Sonic Boom Records in Ballard. It's also an easy drive into the city to see all of the classic Seattle tourist spots. No hotel could match the coziness, comfort, and convenience of this wonderful home. "
4236723,53065666,2015-11-04,46153300,Richard,The host made me feel very welcome. There were notes explaining everything and snacks. Very comfortable and very friendly. Would highly recommend!
4236723,53418821,2015-11-08,47971372,Melanie,Ballard Bunkhouse suited our group great! Great location for what we had planned! Absolutely clean and cozy. Such a great warm place. Thank you for the great manual and labels on things. First experience with Airbnb and will try it again! The note flowers and chocolate was enjoyed by all!
4236723,53552852,2015-11-09,16300355,Tara,"The house was in a perfect location and had that old house charm, giving it the perfect home away from home feel. The side yard was perfect for our lil' pup Peanut Butter to make quick trips out. We had a great stay in Ballard and enjoyed exploring such a fun neighborhood. Chris was an excellent host and provided very prompt communication for all of our needs. "
4236723,53883124,2015-11-14,31666141,Karen,"Chris was very attentive. The house was warm, clean and comfortable. I would stay there again. "
4236723,54456544,2015-11-20,13426094,Austin,"This was my third time staying at the Bunkhouse - again, it was excellent! The house is very comfortable, well decorated, and conveniently located. The new heaters kept the house nice and cozy, and as usual, I loved the comfortable beds, huge bathtub, and fluffy linens. The nice huge couch in the living room is a great addition, as is the deck in the back patio. Chris had the place stocked with snacks, cereal, bottled water, and coffee. This place is also very conveniently located - 5 minute walk to downtown Ballard for restaurants and nightlife, and about a 20 minute drive to where I work downtown. I will be back for a fourth stay!"
4236723,55334419,2015-11-29,50027270,Antara,Great host and very accommodating! The place is very nice and in great location if you want to be in Ballard. 
4236723,55979906,2015-12-07,28003521,Ryan,The house has a very warm and laid back feeling.  The half bath made it extra accommodating for (2) adults and (2) teenagers.  Off-street parking was a bonus.  Chris made it very easy to stay.  The security code grants entry without a complicated system.  There were helpful notes left where function was not intuitive.
4236723,56450477,2015-12-13,50648443,Colin,"Chris was an awesome host, more then helpful! Place was great amazing 1901 house with modern amenities! Would stay again"
4236723,56961673,2015-12-20,5266187,Carlos,"Chris was a great host! He always responded quickly and allowed us to check in early since we caught an early flight and needed a place to drop off our bags. The house was very clean and had all the amenities that we needed. 

Thanks Chris!"
4236723,57061435,2015-12-21,4992830,Justin,"Chris is a wonderful host!  The lower bunk was so clean, warm, and inviting!  The extra touches of fully stocked snacks and refreshments truly made me feel welcome and at home.  The linens were fresh and clean and the pillows were my favorite: memory foam!  The extra large tub was a real treat, too!  Super close to my family and Ballard.  Can't wait to stay again!"
4236723,57227965,2015-12-23,1523507,Caroline,Chris stopped by at our arrival and answered some questions we had about the property. He also left a basket full of snacks for us which we thought was really nice. 
4236723,57634701,2015-12-28,3559589,Erin,Chris's Bunkhouse was adorable. It was exactly as described! My family particularly liked that the house was decorated tastefully for the holidays and that there were coffee and snacks provided :) Thanks for helping to make my family's trip to Seattle a success!!
4236723,57815666,2015-12-29,2128024,Billie-Ann,"We had a lovely stay at the Bunkhouse - it was easy to find and access. We appreciated the snacks after a long day! The beds were super comfy, the place was really clean and cozy. We loved the blend of modern facilities in a heritage house, a great unique stay. I would definitely stay here again! Thanks Chris!"
4236723,58074278,2015-12-31,40379545,Christine,We had a great stay at the Ballard Bunkhouse. A great location near downtown with parks and other amenities within walking distance. The house had everything we needed and more! The bunkhouse made our Seattle experience unforgettable.
4236723,58253443,2016-01-01,52790726,Paul,"This place is great. Chris has been doing this for a while and it shows. Last-minute reservation to check in in no time, everything was clean, the place was nice and warm, and it was all very luxurious. Highly recommended!"
4236723,58359760,2016-01-02,33781615,Kelly,"What a perfect place to stay the night! This charming, historic house is exactly as it's pictured. We stayed in Seattle for New Years Eve and all of the beds were comfy with lots of extra blankets, and Chris encourages you to ""crank the heat"" since the house is 115 years old!

Such lovely welcoming touches like a handwritten card, snacks on the counter and water and soda in the fridge. My hungover friends savored that Sprite the next morning, let me tell you.

Chris was very easy to communicate with, and the house is only blocks from the D-line bus that is a straight shot into downtown. Short walk to all of the great food and coffee Ballard has to offer--this place is a perfect location to be steeped in Ballard awesomeness while having easy access to other parts of the city."
3294804,14380319,2014-06-17,12196008,Cindy,"Easy to find, great location, security light on the side was very helpful. Nice and quiet, use of the jacuzzi a real plus!
I travel to Seattle several times a year, I'll definitely stay here again!"
3294804,19798227,2014-09-18,21089392,Alexander,"If you are looking for a quiet picturesque neighborhood close to urban amenities, then this is the place for you. My wife, our baby and I stayed at this property for three nights. The place was comfortable enough to become our home away from home. Rebecca's local dining and cafe recommendations were spot on. One of the best restaurants we have ever ate at was within walking distance, which is saying something because we could be considered San Francisco food snobs.  We fell in love with Seattle and would consider staying here again if we came back for another visit."
3294804,21365237,2014-10-15,10911601,Amanda,"Although we never met Rebecca, no problem! She sent us all the information we needed in advance to get into the apartment which is really what we needed. After several days with friends and family, my friend, my 7 year old daughter and I got some much needed sleep at this quiet, bright and very comfortable urban retreat. During the day, we hit Wallingford on foot going to Irwin's, a great coffee shop/bakery right up the street. We easily walked to Fremont and through Wallingford to explore. After cooking dinner in the well-equipped kitchen, a soak in the hot tub was a fabulous way to end our day. I highly recommend this listing to others looking for solace in the city with urban delights available just around the corner. Perfect!"
3294804,22848937,2014-11-16,15445151,Mary,"This was a comfortable, accessible place to stay while exploring the city. It's about a 5-10 minute walk from a bus stop, depending on where you want to go to. It's a nice walk over to Fremont or to Wallingford, where there are great shops, restaurants, and sites. Thanks to Rebecca and Rodrigo for getting us good information in advance and making it a pleasant stay!"
3294804,22910519,2014-11-17,1738014,Jonathan,easy in and easy out. great location to get to Fremont and Wallingford locations. nice and quiet too!
3294804,23182130,2014-11-24,16549989,Mitch,Everything was clean and great. Rebecca let us do our thing but was also available to us if we needed. Thank you Rebecca!
3294804,25147320,2015-01-07,12461604,Doree,"We had such a lovely time at the ""Hot Tub House."" It was so relaxing and quiet. The location of the house was perfect. About 10 minutes to downtown Seattle and easy access to  the freeway. Gas Works Park was a short walk away as well as Ivar's Salmon House (fantastic chowder and friendly people). Over all Rebecca very responsive and pleasant. I would highly recommend her accommodations and look forward to staying again."
3294804,28091679,2015-03-17,14486018,Emily,Such a lovely space in a great neighborhood. Plenty of great restaurants and views of the city within walking distance. We wouldn't hesitate to stay at Rebecca's place again!
3294804,28496814,2015-03-24,14951036,Gabby,"Rebecca's space was exactly what we needed for our weekend retreat to Seattle, and even nicer than the photos on the page. Great location within walking distance of the Gas Works Park and a few cute restaurants and bars. Trendy areas like Fremont are only about a 5 minute drive. The listing was clean and warm, and when we asked for more linens and towels Rebecca responded immediately. Very friendly and hospitable. In the listing itself there are lots of of great guide books and local information. The hot tub was fantastic, and the pull out sofa bed was surprisingly comfy! Overall great stay. One tip to offer to travelers - be advised that parts of the ceiling in this listing are quite low, so if you are 6'+, remember to watch your head. Great stay!"
3294804,28730406,2015-03-29,19359944,Emma,"Our stay here was just the best!! Rebecca was a wonderful host, and I'm so disappointed in myself that I didn't get to meet up with her - I was constantly on the go while I stayed here! To the point where I didn't even get to take advantage of the backyard and hot tub (I hope to stay again soon and fix that!) The place itself was just perfect: cute, well maintained, homey (that couch was incredible) and the location couldn't be beat, I fell in love with Wallingford even more. "
3294804,29289107,2015-04-06,28376840,Scott,"Host was helpful, space was clean and location was convenient. Didn't get a chance to use the hot tub but the backyard was nice. I should probably have read the description more carefully though—I thought this was going to be the whole house but it is actually a basement apt with the host living above. Not a problem for me but worth noting if this isn't what you are looking for."
3294804,31356007,2015-05-04,20267524,Caitlin,"Rebecca's place was a great little getaway! My boyfriend and I were in town for the weekend for a wedding and wanted something cozy where we could hang out. Her apartment was perfect! It was a great spring weekend--hot tub in the evening and a nice morning walk to Gas Works.
"
3294804,31975119,2015-05-12,31754840,Theresa,"My parents stayed at Rebecca's apartment while they were here on a visit, and they loved it. The apartment was great and the backyard and grill were amazing for a family get-together. Rebecca made everything about staying there enjoyable and easy. "
3294804,32380939,2015-05-17,13930534,Neil,The location was great for us as our son lives nearby.  We really enjoyed walking around the lovely neighborhood.  We borrowed his car a few times and street parking was always available.  We also used the grill one evening and really enjoyed the outside space.  Thank you for everything.
3294804,52145997,2015-10-26,13229313,Aimee,"Rebecca's in-law apartment was great!

Communication: We had a few hiccups setting up my reservation, but Rebecca was very patient with me!   She was very quick to respond to my questions and very friendly.

Check-in: Super easy, she just has a keypad on the entrance and gave me the code.  This is much nicer than having a key.

The apartment: Very private basement unit.  It has low ceilings so be aware if you are over 6 feet tall.  The apartment was very clean and the bed was comfortable.  It had everything we needed (towels, shampoo, dishes).  The apartment was quiet and in a very safe neighborhood.  There is a pull-out couch as well.

We used the hot-tub twice and the backyard was super pleasant.  The hot tub was always hot and was very clean.

Rebecca left some beers in the fridge for us, which was really great!

I would definitely recommend this airbnb!  Thanks Rebecca!"
3294804,53768307,2015-11-12,46185612,Christina,"This is a great neighborhood setting. The room was prepared and ready for our arrival. I agree with the concept; all we expected was air, a bed and a bath, but this was a nice private apartment and very functional. We didn't have the opportunity to use the hottub, but that is also a nice touch.

Scott and Christina Daly"
3294804,54194076,2015-11-16,24071783,Katherine,"My parents visited Seattle over a long weekend and stayed at Rebecca's Mother-in-Law. This home was the perfect size with the perfect amenities. And you can't beat this neighborhood. Rebecca was very attentive and kind - we loved the binder of info you put together. 
Thank you for making my parents feel welcome.

3139972,15965364,2014-07-19,1767940,Anna,"Mia had an absolutely lovely home with a very open, familial vibe.  I stayed in the little green room which is part of a ""walkway"" into the back area of the house, but the privacy curtain made the room very cozy and private.  Her house was very convenient by vehicle to both the airport and to downtown, which worked out nicely for me.  I was able to come and go and explore the area as I wished and met some very nice fellow travelers (and cuddly cats!) during my stay.  I would absolutely stay with Mia again in the future and recommend her to anyone looking for a convenient, lovely stay in a great neighborhood."
3139972,16022599,2014-07-20,1514119,Tyler,Mia was very welcoming. Her home is very casual and I appreciated staying with her. Her dog and cat are both calm creatures. I felt right at home.

3139972,17126654,2014-08-07,18831488,Yuya,"Mia welcome me with great hospitality. She not only accepted my uneasy request but also treated me very nicely.
The house is very tidy and cozy in a quiet area, which is 15mins from downtown Seattle.
I was lucky to et accommodation at this great house!

3139972,19543694,2014-09-14,20334853,Kevin,"Mia is a very sweet lady. She has a fantastic spot for living/visiting Seattle. Stones throw away from the downtown area.

I was very happy that I chose her home. Also, has great cats. "

3139972,19831418,2014-09-19,14131476,Zane,"Mia is a very nice woman and is super welcoming and kind. I was traveling alone and she pointed me in the right directions and gave me advice on places to see and things to do. If you are traveling alone and just need a place to stay and shower, this is perfect!! The description of the room is on point and 100% accurate. There is a bus right around the corner to take you up to the light rail station five blocks away if you do not like walking. The light rail is fast and convenient to get to downtown or the airport. It was maybe a 20 minute ride from SEA. and about 15 minutes to Westlake station(furthest downtown you can get via lightrail). "
3139972,20100171,2014-09-23,20327304,Pernilla,"Mia is a very nice, interesting and fun person. You will feel very welcomed in her house! I really recommend to stay at Mia's ""Cathouse"" :)"
3139972,20192547,2014-09-25,2587687,Giorgio,"Mia was a great host. The neighborhood is very peaceful (nice view of sunrise on the sound from the back patio) and the house she lives is cozy and has a lot of personal touch (you gotta like cats, though). She was also very helpful with maps and information, and interesting for talking with over the morning coffee!

3139972,24182452,2014-12-22,23218707,Daisy,"It is a good beginning for me to travel with airbnb. Arriving at Seattle with rain, the host helped my friends call yellow cab.The house and the room are sweet and comfortable with artist style. Mia is a very nice person, very helpful about routes. She is outgoing and easy to communicate. Anyway, it is a very good try for me."

3139972,25528086,2015-01-18,18001612,Cassie,"I had such a great stay at Mia's. I found the red bed in the green room to be great, just what I needed, and was still private enough for me with the curtin provided. Mia's house is artsy and fun, and had a lot of great people coming through there! Either living there or just coming over. The price is affordable and made my trip possible, while still providing me with a perfectly good bed and room/house to stay in. Also, it is SO perfect and key that Mia's place is located just blocks from the light rail train and public buses. I really like Mia, her friends, family, and even her cats! The cats are very loving and easy going. I hope to stay again some day! Thank you Mia!"
3139972,27204332,2015-02-28,24612642,Eileen,"If you're looking for a quiet and cozy place, then Mia must be your first choice. Also you can find here is very convenient to downtown Seattle or Sea-tac, which you can take route 36 for 30mins to downtown, and walk 10 mins to light rail.
Mia has four cats and they're all friendly, especially the white one.
Finding a place to stay on Airbnb is all about mutual respect and communication, Im really grateful for Mia's generosity and flexibility. She gave me many personal space and useful information. Come to Seattle and find Mia ;)"

Mia is like an aunt I'd never met! She was more than helpful and provided much direction. Here home is in a great location and neighborhood. The space was cozy and made me feel like I was a family member who dropped by and needed a place to crash. I didn't have much interaction with her or the other members of the house do to our schedules clashing. The cats, the bunnies out front of the house and the housemates gave the feel of a real home. Get to the house, grab the key, pull your curtain for privacy and experience Seattle at its finest! Thank you Mia for sharing your home and the experience! "

The room was perfect for me being by myself and I felt like I had my privacy even though there were other people home. It's just so cozy and convenient. It's very easy to get to places from Mia's.

She goes out the extra mile to make sure you're comfortable and I truly appreciated that. Her house is also located very conveniently from downtown and there is a grocery store near it, which is definitely a bonus. Couldn't have asked for a better host; thank you Mia! "

3139972,33636671,2015-05-30,30333408,Vanessa,"This experience was exactly what I expected. Mia was very accommodating to my schedule. I wanted to experience as much of Seattle while I was there, so I was looking for a place to basically only sleep at. The house is a few blocks away from Beacon Station which was very convenient. The view from outside is amazing. She lives on a small hill so you can see the city from there. Mia's pets are adorable. "
3139972,33790601,2015-06-01,13856227,Tina,"Mia hosted me even though it was during a busy period for her but when I arrived she tried to get me situated as quick as possible and offered me all the things we had for her guests. I had a car but I still took a bus on some days. The bus stop to downtown, international district was only a few blocks away. "
3139972,34083191,2015-06-04,33515588,Jenae,"I was really amazed, on my way over, how beautiful the neighborhood is. My room was everything I expected and more. Mia was very welcoming and accommodating. She gave me solid advice about getting around and where to eat in the neighborhood. I especially loved being in a house with animals in it, since my apt does not permit them. All of them were lovely and well behaved. My only regret about my stay is that I didn't stay long enough. I will definitely stay with Mia again if I am back in Seattle.    "
3139972,34346073,2015-06-07,32838353,Ryan,Mia's room was excellent. Cosy and clean as I expected. Many thanks.

Her cats and dog are super friendly also. One of her cats came to sleep next me to a couples times.
The room was just as seen in pictures. Quiet and comfortable."

3139972,36799552,2015-07-01,9919523,Oriana,"A very cozy room to rest each night after a long day of exploring Seattle. There is a great coffee shop nearby, as well as parks, a grocery store, bus stops, and the little train station. I enjoyed having dinner on Mia's gorgeous deck overlooking the bay. The sunsets were pink and warm and I wouldn't have been able to have such a nice experience in a hotel, that's for sure! Mia was very kind and so were her daughters, kitties, and puppy. Thank you for hosting me :)"
3139972,37117006,2015-07-04,37044907,Fannie,Great and warm experience! Love the puppy and cats. Mia was very caring and nice. Definitely will choose the red bed agin 
3139972,37644840,2015-07-09,27715858,Takuya,Thank you Mia so much. I enjoyed staying in your house and Seattle. The place is easy to access to Downtown by bus. And there is a park near there so I went for a walk before I leave.
3139972,37923127,2015-07-11,33336464,Zhang,It's a lovely place! Totally loved it!

3139972,38634632,2015-07-17,31828032,JungMin,Mia was very nice and friendly! The room and the bed was nice and cozy for me (can be a little too small for bigger folks tho). The neighborhood looked really pretty too. Unfortunately I only spent a night but she tried to help me with her best. Thanks Mia!
3139972,40588996,2015-08-01,34230635,Courtney,"Mia and her daughters are very nice people. But, Please make sure you read her description carefully!!  Although she mentions the curtain and creaky floors, she does not say how loud it actually is. The other house guests were often up late and even though I was gone for 12 hours a day, I was still kept awake at night. Yes, she mentions the shared wall, but she didn't mention the window in the wall. It has a curtain but if the light in the other room is on, then the space if fully illuminated. I am just trying to be honest because I was a little shocked when I got there. "
3139972,41020652,2015-08-03,2313552,Ciara,"Mia's Red Bed in a Green Room is so lovely! Super comfy bed in a lovely home, and Mia is a very welcoming and kind host. I wish I had more time to relax there. "

3139972,41319240,2015-08-07,24843324,Haifeng,"Mia is very helpful and hospitable. i rented a house in LA, but the experience in Seattle is better. Mia's room is clean and the bed is super comfortable. i still enjoy the days with her animals, Dogs and cats and rabbits."
3139972,41771517,2015-08-09,32163355,Torrance,Mia is incredibly sweet and accommodating.  I had to get in later than expected but it wasn't an issue.  Her home is wonderful and the view from her porch is perfect.  The space is sweet and kept clean . It is very loud so be prepared for waking up whenever anyone else in the house is getting up.
3139972,42570857,2015-08-14,38958680,Corinne,Mia was really delightful. Her house was very comfortable and I easily walked downtown then came back using public transpo. She was great to speak with and it was easy to make arrival arrangements. Her animals are also adorable and where not bothersome in the least.
3139972,42781559,2015-08-15,8707415,Adrian,Mia was a great host! we had nice chats and her home is very comfortable. Everything perfect!
3139972,43749574,2015-08-22,13482521,Carolina,"I was very very fortunate by choosing Mia's (website hidden) stay during my time in Seattle.  My room was indeed cozy and had all that I needed. Bathroom impeccable and I am very very appreciative of the fact that I was allowed in the kitchen and welcome to use the stove and the fridge and also take tea from her cupboard.  In truth it felt so much like family,  like dear friends. 
I love her dog Bodhi and her gardens and the view from thw deck.  Pretty convenient distance from train station. Nice quiet neighborhood. 
Best of all, she is wonder-full and I am planning to stay there every single time that I go to Seattle,  definitely!  I am crazy about her and her personality.  Loved my time there.
I give her Ten stars!"
3139972,43934010,2015-08-23,35980030,Nicole,Mia was the perfect host - so friendly and welcoming. I only stayed for one night but felt completely safe walking through the neighborhood and comfortable in her lovely house. Thanks Mia!
3139972,44314006,2015-08-25,5612706,Mark,"Mia is a rare warm-hearted person whom I could really connects with. I hope you do too and enjoy your stay in her artistic and low-footprint place, shared with three cats and one dog, rabbits, plus much greenery.  Note, if you need one, there isn't a desk/chair in the room. But the living room outside will put you in another era with it's design aesthetic. Come and be calm."
3139972,44704161,2015-08-28,41417659,Andrew,The neighborhood was very safe and nice. It is just a short walk from the light rail. The accommodations were awesome and the host had no problems with my weird schedule.
3139972,45035551,2015-08-30,5563355,Mike,"Mia's ""Green Room"" is exactly as she describes it. If you're a very modest person, you won't like it due to the lack of privacy -- one ""wall"" is a curtain. The house is probably in a state of continuous improvement (as old house often are), and if you need an immactulate room, this is not for you. There are also several friendly cats & a dog who may want to share the space with you... but none of this bothered me. Mia is a gracious, helpful, honest & interesting woman who made me feel perfectly welcome & comfortable for the night I spent. I enjoyed my too-short stay. :)"
3139972,45390048,2015-09-02,38689221,Shane,"The room was exactly as described.  It is very simple but clean and comfortable.  I was a little concerned about the size of the bed due to other reviews but I am 6'1"" and had no issue (the reviewers who did have a problem were taller).  The real gem of the room was the host Mia.  The door was open, letting a fresh breeze in, when I arrived and Mia was inside sweeping.  From the moment she welcomed me until the time I had to leave she made me feel like a part of the household.  She is one of the wonderful memories I am taking with me from my trip to this beautiful city.  If you are just looking for a warm bed and a kind host, then this room is perfect for you."
3139972,45815729,2015-09-06,34704780,Cheng-An,"The house is on the street and it's easy to find. If you drive car there, you would be able to park your car on the street. This is a convenient spot close to downtown and airport(by driving). "
3139972,47639495,2015-09-21,11906344,Ben,"Mia's home was a pleasure to stay at. Everything was exactly as it was described, the curtain separated my room from the hallway, but everyone was very respectful of my privacy so it was not a problem at all. Her home was located close enough to downtown that I did not have any issues getting around to where I wanted to go. Would gladly stay here again."
3139972,48544925,2015-09-27,37524818,Yan,"This was my first time using an Airbnb, Mia and her daughter and her cats and dog gave me an amazing experience! Mia was a super friendly host. The room is clean and comfortable. Thanks Mia!"
3139972,49894246,2015-10-07,38364489,Maximilian,"From the first time Mia opened the door to her house i felt immediately welcomed, i really appreciated that she waited for me till like 1am cause my flight was cancelled. we had nice and long conversations about everything. shes a great person and there should be more open minded people like her on this planet. in total a great first experience on airbnb!

 its a very nice neighbourhood, very quiet and only a 22m ride by bus to downtown"
3139972,50394180,2015-10-11,10546341,Joshua,"Mia is great.  I needed to get there around 9 AM to drop my stuff off and no problem and her hospitality is awesome.

The house is about a 12 minute walk from the Beacon Hill Link station, a car is not really necessary here.  Lots of good bus routes are nearby (36, 7, 60 among others) and bus tickets pid for with Orca are good for 2 hours.

The bed and room were quite comfortable, the house is welcoming, nice ambience and very nice pets (3 cats and Bodie, the dog).

After exploring Seattle area (nearby are Jefferson Park, a nice walk to Columbia City (or by link), Georgetown and other slightly off the beaten pathy areas are nearby.  And the Link is convenient to downtown (and transit tunnel destinations) and Seatac.

I would be happy to stay here again, this is a comfortable, if a bit Bohemian experience and a great deal for the price.  As Mia says, read the description carefully prior to booking."
3139972,50744447,2015-10-14,37097731,Cindy,"I wanna to say, there is no other place I've been to and enjoy like Green House. Mia is fantastic, the room is fantastic!!! This is not a temporary place to stay, but like a home in another country. Cats and dog are good boy and girls, they behave politely and gently. I feel so lucky to meet Mia and her families, they are considerate and easy going, they made my trip in Seattle more easy than imagination. "
3139972,51467304,2015-10-20,128360,Daniel,"Overall great experience with Mia's room.  The host Mia along with all the other roommates were very friendly and accommodating.  They helped provide information on all the good local food/coffee shops all withing walking distance to the house. As expected, there are a lot of animal friends around the house.  If you don't mind this (I actually looked forward to it) then it's another good reason to stay here.

The room itself is as advertised.  I went in expecting it to be a small single room with a shared bathroom.  Keep in mind that there is a curtain divider separating the room to a hallway.  However, this was perfectly fine with me.  Also note that the bed is one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in!

Highly recommend and would do again!"
3139972,52984330,2015-11-03,2995234,Constance,"Mia and her housemates (including a few of the four-legged variety!) greeted me warmly and settled me into a room which was a cozy space with a breathtaking view. It was delightful to wake up to the sun dawning over a pine-tree skyline. The area had several wonderful restaurants and bakeries within a few miles, including Columbia City Bakery where I enjoyed an excellent almond croissant with my coffee. I appreciated the artistic and whimsical details of the house, the beckoning comfort of the bedstead, and most of all, Mia's good cheer and easy-going accommodation. "
3139972,53175982,2015-11-06,34702582,Yi,Mia's place is very good .She was so kind and  nice view from the window. Highly recommend !
3139972,54862844,2015-11-25,23165897,James,房東人非常好，也樂於提供各種協助。房間就像描述所說的，家裡有很多貓狗，每隻都非常可愛。距離downtown要坐公車，但公車站就在旁邊，滿方便的。
3139972,55542737,2015-12-01,16373213,Matteo,Mia is a great host! I didn't spent a lot of time in the house. The room was clean and welcoming! The cats and the dog are really cute and joyful. It was definitely a pleasure to stay there!
3139972,57127908,2015-12-22,46336807,Brittany,"Mia's place was absolutely amazing! I was immediately welcomed and offered advice on places to visit. Mia was always available if I had questions, and she was prompt and happy to answer them. Mia's is a great place to stay of you're low maintenance and looking to be out around town most of the time. Her neighborhood is quaint and just a bus ride away from downtown. I loved staying at Mia's and I hope to stay there again next time in town."
8848403,56499240,2015-12-14,14149421,Stephanie,"Taher was an amazing host who replied promptly to any questions I had. His place is in a prime location if you are staying in Seattle for a few days touring the city. My friend and I had no trouble getting around the city, whether it was by foot or bus. In addition, his place is very clean, and he makes you comfortable staying in his place. His place also offers an incredible view of Lake Union. I would definitely stay here again! "
8848403,57391506,2015-12-25,33052674,Case,Taher was a great host. Our flight got in a little late and he still stayed up and let us in. Great location with easy access to the bus to downtown. Would definitely stay here again next time in Seattle!
6245498,32614676,2015-05-19,21532853,Binh,"Kevin and Pepe were great hosts. They were very communicative and open to when we had an extra unexpected person. The house is really cute, my mom even wanted to steal the design of the desk in the spare bedroom. It's really close to everything and it was very easy to find parking. Would definitely book this again when I go back up to Seattle. "
6245498,33315712,2015-05-26,33469308,Martha,"Adorable home with a beautiful usable patio and garden! We did not meet our host, Kevin, but the check in was easy (instructions were given via text message) and enough instructions were left in the house for easy check out as well. 

The home was exactly what was advertised. One master bedroom with a full/queen size bed and a smaller room with a twin, perfect for our situation (a couple and a single dude). The master bedroom has access to the backyard patio area, which looked very well taken care of with lots of flowers and plants. There was a nice grill outside that we didn't take advantage of, but can definitely see ourselves using if we had stayed longer.  

The home is walking distance (10-20 mins in a nice neighborhood) from the Ballard Locks and Old Ballard, which has lots of restaurants and shops. I recommend Blue Bird Creamery, which is about a 10-15 min walk to the East, and any of its ice cream in a waffle cone. 

We had a great time, thank you!"
6245498,34363734,2015-06-07,32781238,Carolyn,"I was warmly and prompted greeted by the host's friend and given a tour of the house. The picture does not do justice to how beautiful the flowers are. The backyard has a great sitting area with table and chairs to enjoy the fresh air. The kitchen is stocked with everything you could possibly need and then some. I enjoyed the comfortable master bed. The house has another bedroom, too. There is a full washer and dryer if needed. The shower has great water pressure. The house is in Ballard convenient to multiple sight seeings attractions and has off the road parking, a perk in Seattle. I even walked to Trader Joe's while here. I would gladly stay here again. Thanks for a great experience. "
6245498,34647251,2015-06-10,8522203,Carole,"We had a lovely time at Kevin's house. It was exactly as presented on the Airbnb photo's. We especially enjoyed the backyard as the weather was so beatiful at the time of our stay and we were able to use Kevin's barbecue. 
The rest of the house is well furnished (especially the kitchen) and was even decorated with fresh flowers. 
The neighbourhood was quiet and nice. We won't hesitate to come back to Kevin's place if we come back to Seattle."
6245498,35313965,2015-06-17,2083284,Rain,"The place was quaint and beautiful. Kevin was very helpful and accommodating to our needs in terms of schedule and allowed us to check in earlier than said time. His partner Pepe was very sweet and had an amazing deck and garden. The place was perfect for what we needed. Also, the ""fat hen"" is an amazing brunch spot within walking distance from the place. All in all, the experience from the booking to the end was stellar. Kevin communicated well and attended to all our needs and questions. Thank you Kevin and Pepe for lending us your space. We all had a blast in Ballard. "
6245498,36103604,2015-06-25,33125467,James,"Our family came to Seattle to go to our daughter's wedding.  This house was comfortable and very nice to stay in.  The garden is beautiful in the back yard.  The bus stop to downtown and a few restuarants and  a convience mart are all within walking distance.  It was a pleasure to stay here and the host was very nice.  The house was spotlessly clean and the neighborhood was quiet and nice. Thank you.
      "
6245498,37571557,2015-07-08,1353129,Peggy,"The cottate was very comfortable, and much larger than it appears from the picture.  There are two separate bedrooms, and a nice kitchen and living room.  the flower gardens were lovely and peaceful for relaxing in the early mnorning pr evening.  There were lots of unexpected extras in the refrigerator and cupboard that made our stay even better."
6245498,39160977,2015-07-21,16729698,Amanda,"We had the most wonderful stay! The garden was more beautiful than we could ever have imagined, my children had room to run and we had a lovely place to sit and enjoy the weather. The house reminded me of my grandparents house, in the best way. Worn-in, comfortable, unpretentious and exactly what we needed. Location was excellent, walkable to Ballard and supermarkets and playgrounds and the public pool. Quiet neighborhood and friendly neighbors. Would stay here again in a heartbeat. "
6245498,41205044,2015-08-05,14824208,Gerhard,"Wir sind dankbar, dass wir eine wunderschöne Ferienwoche in Kevins schönem, gepflegtem und vollständig ausgestatteten Haus in sehr ruhiger und sicherer Umgebung verbringen durften. Bei dem für Seattle ungewöhnlich heißem Wetter haben wir besonders den Aufenthalt  in dem gepflegten Garten inmitten der vielen wunderschön blühenden Blumen genossen. Für Besichtigungen ist die Innenstadt gut und schnell mit dem Schnellbus zu erreichen. Wir haben eine rundum schöne Woche in sehr angenehmer Umgebung verbracht. Danke Kevin, jederzeit wieder."
6245498,41942621,2015-08-10,31746000,Norma,"We could not have asked for a better location to meet our needs.  It was perfect for us.  Pepe greeted us and did the walk through.   The house is well stocked with everything one could need.  The best part was the deck with grill and beautiful flowers.  We spent a considerable amount of time on the deck, visiting with friends.  I just wish we could have stayed longer.  Thank you for everything.  "
6245498,42304819,2015-08-12,38608879,Nicole,"We really enjoyed staying at Kevin and Pepe's lovely home! The check-in process was smooth and the info Kevin provided before arrival and Pepe provided after arrival was very helpful. The home was absolutely spotless and very comfortable with everything we needed. The gardens are incredible and a very relaxing place to sit and enjoy. The location was perfect, as well. Thanks for being excellent hosts! We look forward to staying again next time we're in Seattle. "
6245498,43490427,2015-08-20,34732056,Connie,"plenty of positives with this listing. great, friendly hosts, so nice to deal with and very accommodating. nice private location, quiet, even at night. easy walking distance to ballard market grocery store, honore (for some fantastic authentic croissants, just around the corner), the fat hen for a yummy breakfast (get there early). even walking down to the ballard farmers market on Sunday was an easy walk.  house is very clean, spacious for 2 or more. all kitchen and cleaning supplies available. no need to bring laundry or dish detergent, or toilet tissue. plenty of kitchen and bedroom linens, and great working washing machine and dryer. plenty of kitchen dishes, pots and pans.  food in frig, leftover from previous guests can be handy, especially if they leave icrecream and butter !  back deck extremely enjoyable with lovely potted flowers and flower garden and bird feeder (we enjoyed seeing and hearing the birds every morning).  we had family visiting us, and we (there were 9 of us) all sat  comfortably on the deck. the kitchen had paper plates and napkins, which was so handy because we had pizza.  this is a very bright lovely sunny home, nice living room with sofa and armchairs and tv.  eat in kitchen for 3, toaster, microwave and coffee maker all within easy reach. next time I'm in Seattle I know where i'm staying!  thanks, Kevin and Pepe we had a great time !"
6245498,45084687,2015-08-31,36456574,Carola,All contacts with Kevin were great. He was responsive and very helpful. The listing was very much as described with a beautiful garden. My parents loved staying there and enjoyed the neighborhood with the small shops & restaurants nearly. 
6245498,45882950,2015-09-06,8224812,Mark,"Kevin & Pepe were very pleasant & easy to work with.  They responded quickly to our questions.  While not fancy, the bungalow was clean & comfortable with all the essentials.  We would stay there again."
6245498,46268173,2015-09-09,34194410,Sandy,"House was pretty much as described. Lovely little neighborhood with cafes close by. Was there for a wedding so really didn't spend much time at the house. Clean, well supplied and easy access to everything we needed. "
6245498,47987633,2015-09-22,37813877,Thomas,"Der Bungalow von Kevin bietet alle Annehmlichkeiten die man benötigt und entsprach genau der Beschreibung. Wir haben zu Dritt darin vier Nächte darin verbracht und uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Die Unterkunft verfügt neben 2 Schlafzimmern, Bad und Wohnzimmer über eine voll ausgestattete Küche die benutzt werden kann - das ist sehr praktisch! Der Garten ist sehr hübsch und gepflegt und die Nachbarschaft sehr ruhig. Es gibt mehrere Bäckereien und (Frühstücks-)Restaurants die man unbedingt besuchen sollte. Für manche mag die Entfernung zum Stadtzentrum von Seattle etwas  zu sein (etwa 20 min Fahrtzeit bis zum Seattle Center). Dies stellte für uns aber kein Problem da. Von der Haupstrasse aus fahren regelmässig Busse in das Zentrum und andere Stadteile. Unser Gesamterlebnis war grossartig."
6245498,49011971,2015-09-30,41338906,Mary Lou,"Kevin is a very responsive host.  Every time we emailed a question, he responded quickly, and he was gracious in removing the down bedding ahead of time that would not work with our allergies.  He met us when we checked in and went through the house with us which we appreciated.  All of the essential amenities were there waiting for us. The garden off of the master bedroom is beautiful and peaceful.  The location is great as advertised, and the price is reasonable. The house is older, and we found that the bathroom isn't as well suited for tall people (we are 6'5"" and 5'9"") as it would be for shorter people. Also the wifi is very slow and didn't allow us to stream information and movies on our iPads; it would work well for about a minute and then the spinning wheel would appear for about 1 -2 minutes and then the whole process would repeat. If you need to do work during your stay, we'd recommend finding a nearby cafe with dependable wifi.  "
6245498,49496419,2015-10-04,13016784,Gail,The bungalow was perfect for our needs. We walked to the zoo and restaurants.  Very comfortable and backyard flowers/deck a bonus.
6245498,50283857,2015-10-11,15546189,Jim,"This property was a perfect stay. Great location, well equipped, great safe  neighborhood with off street parking, and plenty of space to relax and spend time with family. The hosts were available but never needed as everything was so organized. It was very clean and seamless to use. A great property, in a great location."
6245498,51295692,2015-10-19,35279639,Addy,Kevin and Pepe arrived just as we pulled up in a taxi.  They were very welcoming.  The place was exactly as I expected and was very comfortable.   I'm hoping to visit again and stay at the bungalow.  The neighborhood is lovely.
6245498,52177115,2015-10-26,9339285,Annie,"Kevin responded to my request immediately and was very accommodating. Everything went smoothly, so there was no need to contact him but I felt confident that he would be right there as needed. The bungalow is a sweet little grandma cottage - simple yet comfortable, with everything that we needed (bed linens, pillows, blankets, towels, kitchen tools, etc). If you go during a Seattle fall or winter, be sure to bring slippers or cozy socks! The floors can be cold."
6245498,52846481,2015-11-02,44424899,Morgan,This is a nice little house in a great neighborhood.  All communications with the owners were clear and great.  We felt welcomed and very happy to be there.  The beds were comfortable and the garden was really nice.
6245498,53266543,2015-11-07,46160439,Jacqueline,"Kevin and Pepe were very easy to communicate and plan with for exchanging keys and the set-up beforehand. The house was very cute and cozy, and very easy from a guest stand point (what to do with sheets, recycling, leaving the keys, etc.). "
6245498,54620886,2015-11-22,34515820,Shawn,"Kevin is a fantastic host. I would highly recommend this listing. The location is in the most convenient place, everything was as described. High praise to Kevin! "
456040,1295941,2012-05-17,215121,John,"Chantal and Zack are great people - warm, friendly and accessible.  They live in an attractive  neighborhood not far from Greenlake and close to a good brew pub and some fantastic donuts (Mighty Os). The room set up is spacious, clean and comfortable. And while it is in the lower level of the house, there is a lot of light. It is a great place to stay. "
456040,1306660,2012-05-19,2383181,Charla,"Chantel was an amazing hostess.  While we didn't spend much time interacting (as my son and I were very busy), the times she and I did chat were very pleasent.  She's an extremely interesting person, with many talents.  The location is superb.  The accomodationgs were excellent - comfortable, cozy, spacious, and very welcoming.  There were all the ameneties of home in her apartment."
456040,1331542,2012-05-22,2355342,Alissa,"This Greenlake/Tangletown suite is super cozy and clean, on a quaint friendly street walkable to many of Seattle's gems. Chantel is a lovely host and I would stay here again and highly recommend to others."
456040,1353190,2012-05-26,1893136,Naz,Chantel was very welcoming. The place was clean and cosy. Very beautiful neighbourhood.  I will definitely stay there if I visit again!  
456040,1366789,2012-05-28,130500,Marna,"We loved the location of the suite so close to Tangletown, Green Lake, and other great neighborhoods all within walking distance to fun eateries, services, and areas to explore.  The suite has everything needed for a comfortable stay and all arrangements are well thought out for an independent stay if you wish.  Both Chantal and Zak are amiable hosts and it was fun connecting with them and sharing travel/living notes."
456040,1384703,2012-05-30,1743791,Nicholle,"Our welcome into Chantelle and Zac's home was fantastic. They are both extremely down to earth, very accommodating and absolutely lovely. The neigbourhood was fantastic with Green Lake and the local eateries. The basement set up has lovely personal touches that make you feel at home and is ideally set up to prepare your own meals and relax reading the array of books on offer. With your own separate entrance, it is very private and relaxing. We highly recommend this space."
456040,1397821,2012-06-01,159821,Mike,Chantel was very accommodating to our last minute request!  The mother-in-law apartment was super-cute and perfect for our short stay.  It's in a great location and not too far of a walk from Green Lake.  One of the best values we've found on airbnb in Seattle!
456040,1403146,2012-06-02,159821,Mike,Chantel was very accommodating when we unexpectedly needed to stay an extra night!
456040,1428102,2012-06-06,2384834,Diane,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The suite was clean and spacious, and in a great location. Chantel and her husband were very nice and welcoming. "
456040,1443868,2012-06-09,11037,Jessica,Great place!  True to the description/photos.
456040,1452331,2012-06-10,634031,Jayde,"Chantels suite was very comfortable and welcoming. I would suggest that anyone would enjoy staying here and find it to be not only a great home, but a perfect location :)"
456040,1483069,2012-06-14,684374,Kimberly,The house was clean and quiet and had all of the necessary elements to make it comfortable and private. Thank you!
456040,1549483,2012-06-24,2239243,Chao,"Very nice house and the basement suite is huge and clean. Own kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedroom, even comes with a small bar, what else do you need? It is close to bus stop, easy to commute to downtown. "
456040,1684284,2012-07-11,2109735,Ezra,"Chantel's home had a great deal of space (living room, full kitchen, plus bedroom and bath).  Was also located in a very pretty neighborhood and only a five minute walk from Green Lake.  We recommend going to the Burgundian a few blocks away for a wonderful breakfast.  Not the best area for getting around the city by bus, so we recommend getting a rental car.  All the same, it is not a long walk to the top of the University area and it's a very pleasant walk around the neighborhood."
456040,1693633,2012-07-12,2600143,Martin And Diane,Chantel's place in Seattle was in a beautiful neighborhood. Everything was clean and perfect. We had a wonderful time and would highly recommend. 
456040,1706119,2012-07-14,2788687,Jessica,Our stay here was lovely! Very comfortable accommodations and a great location. We were just there for a short stay but it was the perfect place to spend our nights after long days of exploring Seattle. 
456040,1709826,2012-07-15,103198,Diane,"Spent a short one night at the Suite before the Seattle to Portland bike ride. Having the kitchen, a private bath and cozy bed were great and the kitchen was stocked enough to provide for making meals, with the healthy touch of teas and spices.  We really loved the privacy the space provided. Chantel was very pleasant and friendly and I would recommend staying here for a short or longer stay.  Great location too."
456040,1751196,2012-07-19,2664580,Jamie,"Chantel and her husband were super hospitable; suite was very inviting, private and spacious (oh and bed was comfy!) - located in great charming Wallingford neighborhood of Seattle close to lake and food, shopping etc!"
456040,1754287,2012-07-20,2667795,Elissa,Chantel was very understanding when we showed up late. It is not easy to find if you rely on your memory of seattle's streets so get directions ready. Everything was great. Perfectly close to uvillage for our liking and great landing pad for a weekend of shopping.
456040,1769398,2012-07-22,2058010,Steve,"I enjoyed staying in Chantel's basement suite.  It was very spacious, clean, quiet, and in a great neighborhood.  Chantel was very accommodating, pleasant, and easy to work with in renting her suite.  I would recommend staying here if you are visiting Seattle. "
456040,1782092,2012-07-23,2886661,Christine,"This place was beautiful, spacious, private and quiet. It was easy to find, and convenient to come and go. If you don't need or want to be downtown, we would highly recommend staying with Chantel and her family. "
456040,1803879,2012-07-26,2472883,Dana,"Chantel is a gracious host.  She is warm, helpful and super personable.   It is obvious she has thought about her guests needs and has made the effort to supply details that make staying with her comfortable, memorable and easy.  "
456040,1815614,2012-07-27,2861645,Danielle,"Lovely space, very clean, easy access, great walking distance to Green Lake and coffee shops, and restaurants.
"
456040,1827131,2012-07-29,1639347,Amy,"Suite walking distance to Greenlake is a wonderful place to stay. We particularly enjoyed walking to restaurants and the beauty and spirit of the lively neighborhood! Chantel was able to accomodate our earlier arrival and that made our experience even better. She provided local information and recommendations. All the normal sounds of an older home were familiar,  adding to the charm. We look forward to booking again!  For us this is all about time away and location, location, location!"
456040,1848987,2012-07-31,1722839,John,"Awesome place to stay. Like others have said, its all about the location. Thanks again. Hope to see you in the future. "
456040,1911938,2012-08-07,2378784,Stephen,"Wow, what a Great Experience!  The apartment was all that was listed and more with personal touches.  Chantel and Zach are very personable, patient, and helpful.  This was our first experience with AirBnB… I fear all others will pale in comparison to the Awesome ""Suite walking distance to Greenlake"".  The Bed is comfortable, the Kitchen is well equipped, and the space is private and cozy.  Chantel suggested some local eateries (that were awesome), and local attractions.  I would highly suggest booking this suite, you will not be disappointed!"
456040,1940226,2012-08-10,1868267,Diane,"I enjoyed my pint of pumpkin ale at the Elysian-Tangletown two blocks away, at Chantel's recommendation. The basement suite gives you a nice amount of space to crash. There are about 5 steps down and the house is on a flat street (not down the big hill nearby - whew!) The bathtub is quite low-sided and easy to get into - and it's a quiet neighbourhood - a good place for older parents! There's a heater in the bedroom and lots of places to put things and an interesting library if you have time. The gas stove is fun to use if you bought something to cook at the downtown markets, and there's a full-size fridge to store things, but I didn't see a microwave, so prepare to go gourmet. Or just go down the street to eat - the food's fine and you can walk back so no one has to be the designated driver :)"
456040,1994487,2012-08-15,1618274,Isaias,Chantel and her family were great hosts and the suite is exactly what is described and more.  I was in Seattle to find an apartment and you cannot beat the location of this suite.  It is very central to the city of Seattle and there is easy access to public transportation and the freeways if you have your own car.  I would definitely stay at this location again and would highly recommend it.
456040,2038053,2012-08-20,101445,Sharon/Richard,"Very comfortable, clean, well appointed and private. Quiet neighborhood, nice walks, easy to Green Lake, easy drive to downtown & Seattle Center. We were very happy here. "
456040,2058276,2012-08-21,3079625,Kristyn,This place was bigger and better than I expected! It was very comfortable in every way. I'd definitely stay there again. Awesome space and location.
456040,2069798,2012-08-22,1439193,Saskia,"Beautiful suite, we really appreciated being able to stay here for 1 night, thank you very much!"
456040,2084529,2012-08-24,3218183,Oscar,"My wife and I stayed for only one night and we wish it could've been longer. Chantel is a warm and welcoming host and the accomodation was just as presented and very comfortable and spotlessly clean. Nice neighborhood and everything felt very safe.
The bed is especially comfortable and we slept really well.
This was our first expereince using airbnb and we are excited to travel more and stay in more places.
Thank you Chantel and thank you airbnb. "
456040,2092786,2012-08-25,3178661,Wendy,"Fabulous hosts, basement suite was perfect for our one night stay in Seattle. Everything we needed was there. Excellent pub within walking distance. Will definately stay again if we are in the area. Thanks Chantel. Regards, Wendy and Graham."
456040,2169858,2012-09-02,2860429,Nina,Clean and neat home. Convenient location. Chantel is a warm-hearted and nice hostess.
456040,2194689,2012-09-04,2096292,Paula,"Chantel's location is perfect: a 10-15' drive downtown, three minutes from historic Ballard, Fremont, and the university district, and just a few blocks away from I-S. We loved the convenience of staying in a northern neighborhood. The suite is equipped with private bathroom and a full kitchen--also very convenient for long stays. And last but not least, Chantel is an absolutely charming host. I totally recommend this option if you're looking for privacy."
456040,2219654,2012-09-06,3442450,Sahila,"The suite was exactly as described... very clean and comfortable and very close to just about everything we needed to get to...

Chantel was kind enough to message us that the rooms were available earlier than expected, which was a comforting thing to know as our schedule was unpredictable and it would have been hard having to kill time to move in...

Sadly, we didnt get to meet Chantel in person until we were leaving.... she is warm and caring and very approachable....

"
456040,2249883,2012-09-10,3194636,Janet,So convenient! I enjoyed the keyless separate entry with freedom to come and go as I pleased without disturbing my hosts. The location is ideal with convenient access to I-5. The highlight for me was the ease of walking to shops and cafes and to the lovely Green Lake with a 3 mile walking loop circling the lake. I had a wonderful time in Seattle and was very comfortable in this accomodation.
456040,2462243,2012-10-01,2647146,Maureen,Had a wonderful time during my extended stay with Chantel and Zak.  The space was perfect for me and the location near Green Lake just as great.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone wishing to be in a perfect part of town for exploring the outskirts and quick commute to downtown.
456040,2495958,2012-10-03,3394627,Joshua,"great space set a few miles outside of downtown seattle. easy bus route to the city...although make sure you find an express bus!

beautiful home with friendly people. private entrance as well as kitchen and bathroom. check in/out was simple as could be. would stay here again anytime"
456040,2524347,2012-10-06,2062865,Brian,"My trip was brief (1 night) but Chantel and her family made it very easy for me to stay in their ground-floor apartment unit.  The listing here is for a non-entire apartment/house, but really you have entirely your own space and separate entrance when you stay at their place.  It was incredibly convenient, clean, comfortable and roomy.  I highly recommend staying with them if you need to find an inexpensive option near the University District."
456040,2539950,2012-10-08,2147241,Kevin,Really great room and fantastic hosts!  Would definitely stay again!
456040,2590740,2012-10-12,1193262,David,Very nice and large suite.  A lot of privacy.     
456040,2663395,2012-10-20,3539716,Dan,"Chantel's place was above and beyond what I would expect from any situation.  The neighborhood is very peaceful, walking distance to Green Lake (it's a nice 3 mile run around the perimeter), but also walking distance to some bars/coffee shops.  And you're not too far from downtown.  Chantel and her husband Zach were incredibly warm and helpful, and were willing to give some recommendations for things to check out.  That being said, this place is basically it's own suite, so you can keep to yourself if you want.   I can only hope that their place is available on my next visit to Seattle!"
456040,2735326,2012-10-28,924476,Kate,"Chantel's suite was private and in an excellent location. We could hear footsteps upstairs in the mornings but it wasn't too disturbing. The suite was warm and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. We would certainly stay here again if we visit Seattle in the future."
456040,2783152,2012-11-01,2986363,Sulema,"Chantel was a lovely host! I only needed a place to stay for one night as I was catching an early flight back home the next day.  The room, bathroom, and living area were extremely clean.  The room was cozy and relaxing.  I would love to stay there again whenever I return to Seattle.  "
456040,2796333,2012-11-03,4000860,Rita,Chantel and Zach's place is great! They were very easy to contact. Clean and quiet in a nice neighborhood. 
456040,2861224,2012-11-12,3210722,Shika,"I spent 3 nights at Chantel's place & I loved it. Being a fellow artist I truly appreciated the books & decor. I really liked the fact that there was a private entrance along with a bathroom & kitchen so I never had to disturb the family. I was in town for a conference & had never been to Seattle before. I got around via public transportation, there are two bus stops within short walking distance. It is a very nice residential area & I would definitely stay here again if I ever come back."
456040,2905650,2012-11-18,3591066,Amy,"Chantal was lovely and accommodating from the start. I arrived into Seattle after a long cross country flight not feeling 100% and she immediately assisted me getting settled and from that day on I was fine and had a wonderful stay .
The living arrangements were perfect for me. I could come and go as I pleased, thanks to the private entrance. "
456040,2939394,2012-11-21,3840347,Amber,"Nice, private space in a great location of north Seattle.  Definitely a nice walk to Greenlake, passing by coffee shops, restuarants, brew pubs on the way.  Convenient to bus lines, all around great experience."
456040,2953520,2012-11-24,4153562,Michael,"Clean, comfortable, and charming, basement accommodations. Chantel took the time to make sure that I got in alright, and to insure all was okay. Great location near Green lake."
456040,3012201,2012-12-03,2374937,Lesley,Wonderful place to stay in Seattle. Everything you need is there and more.  It was lovely and comfortable.  I liked the hosts who I met.  I will try to stay here again when I travel to Seattle.   .  
456040,3082477,2012-12-13,3377742,Doug,"Great location within one two blocks of a neighborhood commercial area with a coffee shop, market, and a couple of restaurants.  Walkable to Greenlake.  Quiet with easy access through a code lock into your basement stay.  It was roomy and the bed was comfortable.  There are beams that have a six foot limit.  If you are over 6 feet, uless you are prepared to be careful, you might not want to consider this.  I am 6'2"" and it was workable, but I had to remember to duck.  Finally, this stay is centrally located for Ballard, Wallingford, And the U District.  15 minutes from anything."
456040,3114509,2012-12-18,4262788,Yannick,"I spent 5 nights at Chantel's place.  It was a wonderful stay. Chantel and Zach are very welcoming and helpful. The place is private, clean and relaxing. Greenlake and Wallingford are fantastic neighborhoods to spend time in. I recommend it very much."
456040,3184099,2012-12-30,2733413,Peter,"It was really great of Chantel to have us there literally underfoot in the basement during their holiday time.  We loved having kitchen space and a frig to organize our eating on the run between larger meals out. Our daily walks down to and around Green Lake helped keep the pounds off during holiday eating binges. We also slept really well on the very comfortable mattress. Though it is not a totally private space, the basement was very cozy and we were mostly left to ourselves. It was a good stay."
456040,3340294,2013-01-13,4607986,Ariel,"I was here part on business and part for personal reasons.  When I arrived, Chantel was very warm and welcoming and after a quick tour, departed to let me get settled.  The place was a fantastic atmosphere, with an independent bathroom, sitting area, barstools, kitchen and fridge.  With the private entrance, I was able to come and go when needed and hopefully not disturb anyone.  

The neighborhood was great as well.  Within walking distances was a fantastic restaraunt called Burgundian right off of Kirkwood.  Artisan made everything and small/medium/large style portions.  Amazing food and a great atmosphere.  

As far as future stays with Chantel: I will likely be making a reservation in the future when organizing meetup UX groups."
456040,3375803,2013-01-20,3929312,Jim,"Very comfortable, convenient, and clean, a great stay"
456040,3413810,2013-01-25,751130,Meg,"What a fantastic, convenient find for a PDX-Seattle commuter. I so appreciated the cozy, space and warm welcome by Chantel! "
456040,3432012,2013-01-28,3349581,Patty,"Stayed here for two nights while visiting friends in the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods in Seattle on a weekend away from Portland. It was a completely charming place to stay with all the comforts of home and very nice hosts. Having a private entrance was great. The bed was super comfy! Another reviewer mentioned the low head room--it would be an issue if you were much over 6 feet. I am 5'10"" and the duct work was a few inches above my head (this is an issue in my own basement though, so I am used to it). Thank you Chantel for the charming space!"
456040,3455013,2013-02-01,4766628,John,"I arrived in Seattle a couple of days before a weekend event and stayed two nights at Chantel's place.  Chantel and her husband Zak are warm, likable,  charming people.  They went out of their way to help me construct a mental map of the Wallingford area (the streets surround a lake and thus are not laid in a simple grid).  They also helped me in other ways that went well beyond the call of duty. .  Even though airline delays forced me to arrive rather late, Chantel was very welcoming when I arrived; after providing a  tour of the essentials she left me to unpack and settle in at my own pace.  Chantel’s place is spacious, well-laid out and clean with a very comfortable bed,plenty of drawer space, private bathroom with a good shower, and a private kitchen/sitting area.      I was provided a key code for a side entrance that let me come and go as I pleased  without  disturbing Chantel's family  upstairs.  The  atmosphere of the household was pleasant and good-humored.  Staying there gave me the opportunity to walk around Green  Lake and to explore explore Wallingford, which likewise is a comfortable place for walking and is full of interesting houses with  unique and artistic landscaping.   All in all, a very pleasant part of Seattle to stay if you like to walk; the last day of my visit, even though I was staying by then in Chinatown, I returned to Wallingford to walk it streets some more and to visit Woodland Park and the zoo (which are within reasonable walking distance from Chantel's place.)  I’ll add that the Burgundian restaurant, which another reviewer praised, has a very good breakfast menu with lots of choices that they serve all day and I ate “breakfast” there several times.  If I return to \Seattle, Chantel’s place will be my first choice for another stay."
456040,3493607,2013-02-07,4730711,Creg,"Comfy, cozy one-bedroom in great North Seatttle neigbhorhood.  It's a subbasement but doesn't feel like it. Nice armchair and couch in sitting room. Separate entry on side of house. Hosts live upstairs, are delightful and helpful."
456040,3515721,2013-02-11,3778731,Trevor,"This was a lovely experience. The suite is spacious and comfortable  and lovely and warm. (I sometimes worry about basement suites) it was a wonderful location, the kitchen is a bonus and the quality of teas provided were excellent. Plus it has its own private entrance so you don't disturb your hosts. I highly recommend this experience."
456040,3559157,2013-02-17,4435299,Omar,Chantel was kind enough to let me check in a couple of hours early. I place was clean and tidy.
456040,3828067,2013-03-18,4386940,Christian,Nice little place to stay at while in Seattle. The basement is pretty private with it's own entrance and the location is very convenient to all sorts of locations within the city. The internet was also very strong which was perfect for Netflix. If you are looking for an inexpensive room that's also quite nice I'd recommend staying here! 
456040,3850145,2013-03-20,296600,Laura,"Chantel's suite was the perfect spot for our Seattle getaway in a quaint neighborhood close to Greenlake (wonderful for walking/jogging around, even on bad weather days!) and UW. We appreciated the lovely design and decor which made it feel very homey, and the full kitchen was a huge plus. It was easy to find street parking in front of the house and we even discovered the nearby 55th St. Deli where a fine selection of microbrews was available. Chantel was warm and friendly and great about communication. Will stay here again when we have the chance!"
456040,3926670,2013-03-28,3695756,Lisa,"This is a GREAT little basement apartment. It's incredibly spacious, with a separate bedroom, sitting area and kitchen (these are ostensibly ""shared""- but still feel very private) and a full bathroom. The separate side entrance makes it feel as if you have your own little apartment in the the wonderful Greenlake neighborhood. "
456040,4002947,2013-04-02,2549430,Melanie,"Beautiful neighborhood. Convenient location, easy parking to leave the car and catch the bus to downtown. A comfortable place to stay, quite spacious for 2 persons. Separate entrance is great. I love airbnb. A great way to find great places to stay. Thank you Chantel. "
456040,4077530,2013-04-08,5258154,Diana,"It was a nice set up with a separate entrance, very comfortable accommodations overall. Kitchen well-equipped. The hosts were very pleasant. Within walking distance to some nice restaurants and the lake. Warn tall people (over 6') about low ceilings. Kinda noisy. You could hear everything going on upstairs. Would stay there again if in the area--a great location about 5 miles north of downtown Seattle in a charming neighborhood. Suggest you get details from the hosts on how to recycle. Very impressed with Seattle's recycling program."
456040,4150107,2013-04-14,3001052,Becky,"While we only stayed a few days, I can imagine being comfortable at Chantel and Zach's for a more extended stay. This basement apartment with a separate entrance, full kitchen and private bath felt very homey. The bed was comfortable and the windows big enough that you could forget you were in a ""garden unit"". They live in a lovely neighborhood with easy parking. Their place made for a very private and relaxed home base while visiting Seattle."
456040,4343526,2013-04-29,5276995,Harold,Great place to stay. Really low key and private for a good price. I would definitely stay there again.
456040,4587260,2013-05-13,1489535,Joan,This is a great place to stay and Chantel is a great host! The location is very central and street parking is not difficult. The suite was well equipped and the bed was really comfortable.

456040,4664325,2013-05-19,5977993,Janet,"A fabulous, straightforward space and overall experience. Chantel was timely and friendly in her correspondence, and we loved the location. Definitely recommend this listing if you're looking in the area!
"
456040,4675516,2013-05-20,2084798,Theresa,  We enjoyed our stay!    It was easy to find and very close to everything.  The apartment was roomy and comfortable.   We hope to be back soon :) 
456040,5219908,2013-06-18,6576285,Autumn,We really enjoyed our stay. The suite is really a full basement apartment and you couldn't ask for better hosts. Don't bother bringing a book because they have tons of interesting things to read!
456040,5295195,2013-06-23,6376116,Kate & Hillary,"Great location, cute suite.  Chantel was helpful and there when we needed her, but mostly left us alone (which is what we wanted).  She earned extra points by offering to let us use the dryer for our wet camping clothes.  Definitely recommended, a great place to stay."
456040,5346166,2013-06-25,6463870,Alain,"Nous sommes extrèmement satisfaits de notre séjour, d'abord parce que ce qui était prévu a été respecté. Une entrée indépendante, une belle chambre avec un lit trés confortable, salle de bains, cuisine avec grand frigo, buanderie disponible et le parking facile devant la maison. A 2 minutes à pied, restaurants, bars , commerces, facilités pour le bus vers le downtown; un quartier vert, calme et tout près du lac ; un regal et l'accueil de Chantel sympatique et souriant, enfin à conseiller absolument.
De plus toute la documentation nécessaire pour notre séjour donc si on doit revenir, ce sera chez Chantel."
456040,5389717,2013-06-27,5235108,Simon,"This private basement was absolutely perfect for us, with its own entrance it has the exact level of privacy we wanted. Chantel, a wonderful and very helpful host, was always on hand if we needed her. The basement flat was very well furnished and having our own kitchen to use was perfect for us foodies who love to cook. The only downside is that we couldn't stay longer! 

Links to downtown was just round the corner (number 16 bus for future reference). We had a little trouble finding the place to start with as N 55th street splits in two but just walk down to the right number on N 56th street and drop down a street. It's a beautiful area with cafes and restaurants just round the corner. We would not hesitate to stay again! "
456040,5427372,2013-06-30,4842124,David,We were visiting Seattle for our daughter's graduation.  We enjoyed our stay in this basement suite.  The owners were friendly and helpful.  The room was perfect for us and the bed was incredibly comfortable. We would stay here again. 
456040,6207357,2013-08-03,3262808,Leah,"Chantel was incredibly flexible and accommodating - so nice having a private entrance so you don't have to worry about disturbing anyone.

The house is a wonderful location and has a great, private basement suite for guests with a bathroom, bedroom, living room and kitchen. 

Highly recommend! "

456040,6402902,2013-08-11,1228038,Dana,Lovely neighborhood - peaceful and quiet for a summer weekend.   The suite was very well appointed and Chantel was prompt in communication and accommodating to our needs.  
456040,6459520,2013-08-13,3011659,Alex,"We had a wonderful stay at Chantel's home. The basement unit was perfect for our needs. It was clean, quiet and well maintained. 
It is 10 minutes drive from the Seattle Center which we found to be the place we spent most our time in and the proximity to green lake is a great plus to people who love to start their day with a jog or watch the sunset in a quiet and romantic place. 
"
456040,6499111,2013-08-14,2357643,Nanine,This was my second visit to Chantel's and it was again a perfect spot and fully equipped. The bed is comfortable and the convenience of a full kitchen can't be overstated. It's also a tremendous bargain. Chantel is a charming host and willing to help with advice for getting around. 
456040,6684104,2013-08-21,6764017,Joanne,Very spacious and well appointed. Super convenient for our needs. We loved the private entrance and ease of access. The sitting area and kitchen are a nice perk! 
456040,6964105,2013-09-01,5117353,Bob & Evelyn,The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
456040,7007321,2013-09-03,6646584,Tammy,"Nice suite, especially appreciated the kitchen and the private entrance.  Could hear some noises from upstairs, but mostly it was not an issue.  It was a great deal for the price.  Chantel was also very accommodating to a last minute change in plans :)"
456040,7102033,2013-09-06,8009607,T,"Chantel & Zack were very friendly and accommodating hosts, and their suite was clean, spacious, private, and well appointed.  Skip the other spots and stay at Chantel's!"

Within walking distance you have an amazing sushi place as well as other restaurants. Also close is Green Lake. I definitely recommend this apartment. "
456040,7395685,2013-09-18,7417753,Kate,"I stayed at Chantel's basement suite for nine nights, my husband joining me for the last four (website hidden) was perfect for us.  More spacious than I expected with a sitting room, small kitchen bath and bedroom.  Beautiful neighborhood with great walking/running path around Green Lake.  Easy street parking. 
Chantel made everything easy for me.  This was my first airb&b experience.  
The small coffee maker was a real blessing, as I was in town helping out with the birth of my first grandchild.
Highly recommend."
456040,7944023,2013-10-09,244900,Katerina,"Highly recommended! 
We had a restful night. Chantel and Zach made us feel welcome. The place had everything we needed, it was private, comfortable and clean.
Location is super convenient to everywhere, quiet neighborhood with lovely cafes and restaurants. We'll definitely come back again."
456040,8110683,2013-10-16,332541,SuePy,"Very close to bus #16 line and the 16 took me to downtown where I can hop on monorail to see space needle and other interesting places. I found my hostess very helpful and polite. Welcomed me to my apt with good lighting on the outside( many evenings I came home late and the driveway way motion activated) . Combination lock to open door. ( no key to lose or forget) . A neighbor down the street evening had a white VW Volkswagen and it was decked out to look like ""Herbie the LoveBug"" so that gave me quite a smile. 
They had a very  cosy apt with a perfect kitchen for me to make meals when I decided to stay in full size fridge and stove were a blessing.  I had a lovely stay  in Seattle and staying here was wonderful. Close to diggity dog hot dog place and a great coffee shop called Zoka.  Very move place.... Great  hostess! I give them 5 stars"
456040,8259102,2013-10-22,2824099,Jessika,"The house was in a beautiful neighborhood and the fall foliage was amazing. The furnished basement had a nice size living room, full kitchen, separate bedroom and full bathroom. It was more than I was expecting :) Chantel was very nice. You can hear normal house noises from upstairs, but I didn't mind at all. (There was a great punk-ish/hipster-ish bar near by, The Burgundian. They serve breakfast all day and they have the best bacon I've ever tasted! There were a good mix of regular folks there too.) The house is in a great central location for all of the places I traveled to on my visit. I would definitely stay there again. Thanks!"
456040,8377846,2013-10-28,9092900,Laura,"It is not in my best interest to give this space a good review as that will only increase the competition for  bookings!  That said, my only disappointment related to my stay is that this spot is already booked for my next trip!  
I would recommend Chantel's place to anyone.
This is a well-kept, cozy yet spacious, private basement studio with a very comfortable bed, well-appointed private bathroom, and separate entry. The neighborhood is lovely with restaurants, bars and coffee shops within walking distance. It was perfect for my stay and I will be (trying) to book again for future visits.

456040,8995400,2013-12-01,3915977,MaryLou,This private guest suite was a perfect quiet get-away from lively grand children. Bed was very comfortable. Spotlessly clean. Enough equipment in the kitchen to cook a simple meal. Parking easy. Overall experience - wonderful. Hope it's available the next time we're in Seattle. 
456040,9064053,2013-12-03,244900,Katerina,"Staying at Chantel's was great. Wonderful, welcoming hosts, convienent location, walking distant to green lake. The unit is comfortable, clean, private, and has everything you need! Highly recommended!!  "

456040,9159959,2013-12-10,55195,Colleen,Chantel's rental is great and even nicer than described on Airbnb. I have stayed at a few different places is the NE Seattle area as I visit every year and this is by far my favorite and the best value. I only wish I had more time to relax there but I was on the go most of my trip. Thanks to Chantel and Zach. Great place. Great hosts!!
456040,9286250,2013-12-18,9827604,Casey,"Chantel's big basement was nice and cozy. My girlfriend and I really enjoyed the location as well. We were not too far from many places to make the stay even more accommodating. The hard part was getting used to the figure out what was trash and recycling, but after a few days, we got it down thanks to the helpful guide given to us. I really enjoyed my time visiting Seattle and her home away from home basement was great!"
