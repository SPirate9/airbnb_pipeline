3673759,20426944,2014-09-29,20035734,Cain,Very cozy and clean apartment in a perfect location!  Host was very easy to reach and provided tons of useful information about the apartment and things to do nearby.
3673759,21224668,2014-10-13,12841416,Michael,"We felt very welcome. Access was easy from the highway or about 8 blocks from the airport Link. The apartment was clean and comfy. We slept very well. The location was great. We walked everywhere throughout Belltown to the market, to South Lake Union, to Capital Hill. Amy was very accommodating and helpful."
3673759,21874764,2014-10-26,20129893,John,Amy was a great host and made sure our trip would be awesome by leaving information out about the surrounding neighborhood. The location of the apartment is ideal since there are a lot of bars and restaurants within walking distance. I would recommend this place if you want to  have a good home base to walk Seattle.
3673759,22293855,2014-11-03,2232215,Orla,Amy's apartment was great and exactly as pictured. It was ideally located to walk to everything in the downtown area. She was communicative and provided lots of information.
3673759,22663569,2014-11-11,22697945,Charles,"I don't think we could have asked for a better host for our first time using Air BnB. She left great instructions on how to get into the unit, provided a binder full of information such as places to eat, play, and shop, there were snacks, television, and the place was clean and tidy! The listing was definitely accurate. The surrounding neighborhood was exactly what we were looking for. We were walking distance to the Space Needle (which you can see if you step outside onto the sidewalk of the apartment building), there were plenty of restaurants and bars to eat and drink at within walking distance, and Pike's Place Market was a pleasant walk as well!

My girlfriend and I were very happy with the well-equipped, well-kept, and comfortable accommodations. We would definitely stay here again."
3673759,22801996,2014-11-15,5821649,Jamie,"Very cozy, just enough room for 1-2 people maximum.  The bed is a double/full size so not huge but comfortable.  Location is great!  Walking distance to the space needle, downtown, the ferry or a short bus ride away.  There is a nice little seating area on the rooftop with views of the space needle.  

Amy's directions to getting into the place was easy and she had a guide that was useful.  The place was very clean, with all the kitchen tools/utensils you will need.  Host was very responsive throughout the stay and overall we had a great time."
3673759,24053257,2014-12-18,16300355,Tara,It was a piece of cake getting into the apartment. The neighborhood is highly accessible from the monorail (once you know what you're doing). The apartment itself was clean and comfortable. The roof was amazing. I would stay here in a heart beat. 
3673759,25250174,2015-01-10,7056878,Howard,"Amy was great. Emailed back with answers to my questions promptly and made the process smooth and easy. Met my daughter, who was on her first trip alone, and explained the ins and outs of Seattle. Everything was perfect and as explained."
3673759,25363645,2015-01-13,25194652,Martine,"L'appartement d'Amy est parfait, très calme, très bien situé. On s'y sent immédiatement bien chez soi. Les trois jours passés chez Amy ont été trois jours de vacances, de repos et de découvertes. On peut tout faire à pied à partir de ce joli pied-à-terre. Si je reviend à Seattle, c'est là que je résiderai et je recommanderai ce lieu.
Merci Amy

Martine"
3673759,25517123,2015-01-18,8868610,Fareen,"I highly recommend this place! It was wonderful, great part of town, and Amy was very accessible, friendly and open.  Great price and really accurate listing!"
3673759,25701221,2015-01-23,189030,Adron,"Excellent place, easy to get to, easy setup that Amy has for entry and egress. I enjoyed my stay very much."
3673759,25780613,2015-01-25,24428170,Cole,"The place was great, even more comfortable than the pictures look. Amy is a great host and I would absolutely stay here again. "
3673759,26007977,2015-02-01,18272567,Eric,"My girlfriend and I had an amazing time in Seattle thanks to Amy's studio located right in the heart of Belltown.  The area was super spacious, clean, and even had a bunch of goodies for us to enjoy!  Amy also provided us with a binder that contained multiple brochures for different places to eat and visit in Seattle.  I loved that it was the entire place to ourselves and how everything was at most a 7 minutes walk away.  We really enjoyed our stay with Amy and would definitely stay here again. "
3673759,26660608,2015-02-16,20739478,Vanessa,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Amy's cozy home for three days, two nights and absolutely loved our entire experience. We never met Amy, but she was readily available if we needed to contact her with any questions. Her apartment is simple, yet so adorable, and was the perfect size for us. If you want to experience the city life, but not be in a super congested area, it is in a great location. It took us probably about 15 mins to walk (very casually) to Pike Place and shops downtown Seattle. It is near grocery stores and many restaurants/cafés-all walkable. The best perk of staying at her apartment, hands down, would have to be the rooftop deck that we were able to access at the very top of the apartment building. It has such an incredible view of the Space Needle and Seattle at literally any time of the day (seriously it's beyond breathtaking). Everything about Amy's apartment was perfection and we will absolutely be staying there when we come back. "
3673759,27267265,2015-03-01,20086543,Dolly,"Amy was great. From being able to provide additional amenities for my boyfriend's surprise birthday in to the apartment, to always being really attentive and caring of how our stay was- she was a really helpful and welcoming host!

The apartment was really cute and comfortable for 2 people. It provided everything we possibly needed and even had 2 umbrellas if necessary! The location of the place was great because it was walking distance to Pike Place, the Space Needle and in a really safe, quiet neighborhood."
3673759,28178993,2015-03-19,15746442,Nancy,"Amy was very responsive and detailed in her instructions for a comfortable and easy stay.  She was incredibly accommodating to my early morning arrival, and even greeted me upon arrival.  The place was cozy, clean, and centrally located.  Thanks so much Amy!"
3673759,28313976,2015-03-22,9144441,Joanna,"Amy was an amazing host! The apartment was perfect for my friend and I. The place was clean with fresh sheets and towels. Perfectly located in downtown Seattle, with just a 5 minute walk to the Space Needle and a 10 minute walk to Pike Place Market. 

Will definitely come back to Seattle and definitely stay at this apartment again! Thanks for everything, Amy! "
3673759,28569230,2015-03-26,16451209,Ryan,"Amy is amazing! Her cozy place was perfect for my best friend and I. Amy was very responsive and quick to answer any text messages or phone calls. Her apartment has everything in it, even though we brought mostly everything we needed (thanks for having a beer opener). Amenities from wifi, washer and dryers, to wine bottle opener to towels! Amy did a great job at providing all the necessities just in case you forgot them! She also took the time to provide a binder filled with Seattle's best places & nearby restaurants. 

The apartment is also only key accessed from the outside, so it is very safe. The neighborhood was also very peaceful and great! 

The apartment was clean and well stocked. The apartment is also conveniently located above a cafe (yummy sandwiches), beer shop (the manager is an amazing lady that knows her beers and is passionate about working there, a few blocks away from the space needle, pikes market, and the downtown scene. We walked everywhere except to the airport! 

Amy also shared that her apartment complex has access to a rooftop which provides an amazing view of the city and space needle. It is a great place to sit down, relax and just enjoy. 

Thanks for the amazing stay Amy! 
"
3673759,28707667,2015-03-29,20468886,Eileen,"Amy's place was perfect for my 3-night stay.  It was surprisingly well stocked and organized, very clean, comfortable, and quiet.  The neighborhood is very safe and an easy walk to everything, including a grocery store around the corner.  I loved having the washing machine in the apartment and access to Netflix/Roku, digital TV, and wireless.  Amy was very responsive before and during my stay and is an amazing host.  Thanks Amy!"
3673759,29059375,2015-04-03,28809072,Marco,"My girlfriend and I loved Amy's Cozy 1 BD in Belltown!   

Amy was extremely helpful and hospitable.  She made sure we checked-in okay and had everything we needed.  Thank you Amy!

The space was very clean and came as advertised!  It was everything we needed for our stay in Seattle.   The place is relaxing and filled with enough amenities to stay in on a rainy day, but with so much cool stuff around you'll want to grab that rain jacket (or umbrella if you don't want to blend in) and stroll down to the plethora of amazing bars, gastropubs, fine dining, and tourist sights.  

What's not to love when you are a stone's throw from the Seattle Center, around the corner from the famous 5 Point Cafe, an easy 15-30 minute walk from Downtown, Pike's Market, or the Waterfront.  

The high walk score is no lie.  We especially loved the area on 1st and 2nd Ave between Blanchard and Bell.  My walkable neighborhood suggestions:   If you like dive bars with arcade games, pinball machines, skeeball, and shuffle boarding go to Shorty's, Lava Lounge, and the Rabbit Hole (they are all right next to each other).   If you like great pizza by the slice with a cocktail at midnight, go to Rocco's.   For fancy cocktails in Belltown, see Bathtub & Gin Speakeasy, the Upstairs, the Lost Pelican, or Some Random Bar.   All great places!"
3673759,30613496,2015-04-25,7253294,Eva,"This cozy little apartment was the perfect space for my boyfriend and I. It was walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do. We were very comfortable there and it felt clean. Amy and her boyfriend Ben were also VERY accommodating and allowed us to check in early and check out late, which helped us out so much.  "
3673759,30832982,2015-04-27,31425656,Timothy,"Amy couldn't have been more accommodating. The apartment was in the perfect place! Do yourself a favor and take Amy's advice: visit the rooftop terrace. It offers an amazing view. This may sound silly, but we really felt that the location of the apartment (and ease of access to everything)  really ""made"" our trip. "
3673759,32470123,2015-05-18,20664024,Gwendolyn,"Amy's place was great: clean, comfortable, plenty of space to hang up clothes, great kitchen etc.. The building and neighborhood are awesome, quick walk to pretty much everything. Amy was very accommodating on check-in time. The rooftop terrace is lovely- comfy chairs, views of the space needle and sound. "
3673759,33437436,2015-05-28,6214627,Jennifer,"The location is incredible! Only a couple minutes from the Space Needle and surrounding attractions and it's in a relatively quiet residential area. At about a 15 minute walk from Pike's Place Market, we felt like we got the best of both connectivity and solitude. Amy was very communicative and very flexible in working with our travel schedule. Also, the apartment isn't posh or super fancy but it felt like home.  It had many amenities and items that made the stay convenient and comfortable. I would definitely recommend staying here."
3673759,33592656,2015-05-30,14561133,Whitney,Amy and Ben were great hosts. The apartment was exactly as the listing described. We loved the rooftop terrace! I definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to visit Seattle.
3673759,34133024,2015-06-05,31400831,Karen,"We had a great time at Amy's . It is exactly like the ad states. The location is excellent. Would recommend it to anyone. Karen
"
3673759,34415874,2015-06-08,13231199,Mandy,"We arrived late with the train in Seattle and Amy could unfortunately not be there in person. Nevertheless she had arranged a perfect way to make sure we could get into the apartment. Because I didn't have a US mobile number, she even installed an app on her phone so we could communicate through wifi.
The apartment was spotless and perfect for our stay in Seattle. The rooftop of the building has an amazing view over the city and shops/restaurants and sightseeing are all in walking distance. The area had a safe feel to it, which was nice. All in all we were very happy with everything!"
3673759,34720773,2015-06-11,31360696,Justin,Our visit was a great success. Amy's apartment is very convenient to downtown seattle. She had great recommendations and was extremely well organized.
3673759,34948676,2015-06-14,27610820,Jo,"Communication with the owner was easy and access was simple.,Great location and worked for us for a short stay. The apt is very small. Only one window, so a bit dark , but comfy bed and well equipped kitchen. Free wifi was a bonus and the rooftop area has great views over the city. "
3673759,35236893,2015-06-16,33686201,Sarah,"Amy was a wonderful host! She has an adorable (and truly cozy) little apartment in Belltown, within walking distance of all the places we wanted to visit in Seattle. Her apartment was clean, neat, tidy, and easy to access-- it felt right like home. Amy was gracious and available for questions and help if needed."
3673759,35541807,2015-06-20,25726973,Rose,"This was my first experience with airbnb and it was awesome! Amy's apartment was just as desribed. It was more like you were staying at a friends place instead of an impersonal hotel. The kitchen had every utensil and dish you could need and all of the other rooms were equally stocked. The neighborhood is safe and the building very clean. Amy always responded promptly and was readily available. 

Lastly, please checkout the rooftop deck. The view is amazing!!"
3673759,36523424,2015-06-29,31159747,Ninja,"So cute, cozy, and perfect!!! Amy's place is exactly as described and more.  It was clean, there was A/C (Seattle is having or was having a heat wave!), and getting around to everything was within walking distance.  The buiding's rooftop deck was amazing!  Great views of the city and of the Space Needle.  Communication and entering and leaving the key was seamless.  Definitely would recommend Amy's place!"
3673759,37664366,2015-07-09,34500259,Miki,"Amy's place is very clean, cozy, quiet, and comfortable! It has everything you need, and its location is convenient. Amy was a wonderful host and gave me responses to any questions I had promptly. I am truly appreciate her flexibility with check-in/out time!  I am so glad we stayed at her place instead of staying at an expensive hotel. The view from the rooftop was awesome just as she described! Thank you, Amy! 

 "
3673759,38011269,2015-07-12,35965343,Erin,"We loved it! Comfortable and cozy, and the location is a dream--less than $10 cab ride from the train station and the easiest walk to Seattle Center. We'd love to stay here every time we're in Seattle."
3673759,39297067,2015-07-22,35711385,Andrew,"Great experience. Amy was easy to work with and very flexible with check in / checkout times. The place was quite nice, very clean. Great location, just a 1/4 mile from the Space Needle. And the rooftop deck was great!"
3673759,39778072,2015-07-26,35340007,Emily,"Couldn't ask for a better first experience with Airbnb. We usually stay in a hotel when we go to Seattle, but this Airbnb experience has changed our minds about that. Amy was great! Very flexible with our check in and check out times. The apartment was more then enough space for 2 people, and was provided with everything we needed. You can walk to anywhere from here and transportation was easy to find if needed. The roof was amazing, can truly see how close you were to everything! Next time were in Seattle, I will def stay at Amy's apartment again! "
3673759,40600968,2015-08-01,30735996,Adam,"Amy did a great job hosting for us. She made sure that we had all the info that we needed prior to arrival and then checked in to make sure we had everything that we needed upon arrival.
The apartment was close to everything that we wanted to do, only took one uber ride in three days and simply walked to everything else."
3673759,42409657,2015-08-13,9638294,Lucia,My stay at Amy's apartment was great. The apartment was clean and comfortable and in a great location! Communication with Amy was easy and I had everything I needed. Thanks Amy!

3673759,43502240,2015-08-20,36244303,Carol,Very easy to check-in/out and it was the perfect location for us (close to Pike Place and a great rooftop view of the Space Needle). Amy was super helpful and her place was very clean. Definitely would stay there again!

Highly recommended!"
3673759,45623042,2015-09-04,42691383,Joseph,"Amy messaged me immediately after she accepted our reservation, communication was great!  Amy as a host and the listing was exactly as described.  This was a great first time AirBnB experience for the both of us, and has set our expectations very high for future use of this wonderful service!  The roof deck is definitely a place to spend some time :D"
3673759,46493170,2015-09-11,871506,Stephen,She had everything we needed in apt. And she was easy to reach if we had questions.
3673759,46743691,2015-09-13,40747373,Alan,"This was a great experience. The location is amazing as its between Pike's Place and the Space Needle. It was a very reasonable walk to both. 

The experience with check-in was seamless, and I will definitely try to book with Amy again when i return."
3673759,47677474,2015-09-21,12126844,Ashley,"We really enjoyed our stay at Amy's place. Clean, affordable, great location, easy check-in and communication with Amy. The rooftop is great as well. Would recommend for one person or couples for their next visit to Seattle! "
3673759,48708488,2015-09-28,33127982,Brittney,"Incredibly easy check in, very cute building, and great location. Pictures don't do the space justice."
3673759,49543309,2015-10-04,17788898,Chris,Great place in a very convenient location and a great rooftop deck looking right at the Space Needle. Amy was also very easy to work with. Would definitely recommend staying here!
3673759,50697719,2015-10-13,45519531,Joseph,Amy's apartment is a perfect one for groups of 2 or solo travelers. It is a nice/clean apartment in a great building. Amy was very helpful in providing all of the necessary check-in/check-out information and was readily available for any questions I had during my stay
5479566,54657715,2015-11-22,40555087,Jared,"Checking in and out was super easy, Chris' friend met us at the door to give us keys and made sure to warn us about not leaving the keys inside as the door locks automatically. The place was nice, small but offered exactly what we needed for the short stay. The place is an older apartment but we had no problems. "
6087451,31154433,2015-05-02,22593549,Clayton,"Reid and Aaleen were great hosts! Upon arrival, they took the time to show me around the studio, answered any of my questions and made me feel welcome. The instructions on how to operate the TV were nice to have. I had arrived pretty late on my check-in day and so I really appreciated that they had some snacks waiting for me in the kitchen. There is a great selection of restaurants down the street, well within walking distance. The studio is located in the perfect area. If you find yourself wanting to explore beyond the Fremont area, downtown is a quick 10min Uber ride away. There is is a bus stop about 200 yards from the property as well if you prefer public trans. Could't have been happier with my stay and look forward to the next time I visit Reid and Aaleen. "
6087451,31492596,2015-05-05,12026658,BrittaLisa,This studio was the perfect size and in a great location. There is ample street parking (no small feat for a unit as centrally located as this one in Seattle) and the private entrance is ideal. Everything in the studio was clean and the appliances seemed new and well maintained. Aaleen was professional and courteous from the start and made the booking process quick and easy; she made sure we had her contact information and was available to us throughout the weekend. I would most definitely recommend this studio and look forward to booking with Aaleen and Reid again!
6087451,32023485,2015-05-12,25500615,Jack,"Reid and Aalen's place was awesome. The house itself has a very comfy bed and beautiful bathroom. It is walking distance to multiple neighborhoods with more bars, restaurants, and coffee houses than you could possible explore. Easy to check in and deal with. Overall a very positive experience. We would definitely stay with them again."
6087451,32583496,2015-05-19,1356331,Samantha,"Aaleen and Reid made me feel super welcome right away. They were there to help you with anything you needed and the pictures don't do this place justice with their place just being newly renovated everything felt really new and it was very clean. It's also a super quick and convenient uber to most areas. For example, from their place to Pike's Place Market, it was only a $12 uber fare. I 100% recommend staying here, you won't be disappointed!"
6087451,33386610,2015-05-27,27972277,Paul,"This place is so great! It was super homey, comfortable, clean, and a perfect location.  Our hosts maintain a beautiful space that we loved coming back to after a full day of touring, we felt so comfortable coming back ""home"" and relaxing."
6087451,33837831,2015-06-01,29594047,Eric & Sarah,This was a great little apartment.  It was very clean and the design was beautiful.  We felt well taken care of with snacks and toiletries. It was quiet and we both slept quite well.  The location was within walking distance to lots of shops and restaurants. perfect for a weekend getaway!
6087451,34027108,2015-06-03,3547794,Elizabeth,Place was very easy to find and conveniently located. Communication with Aaleen was great.
6087451,34483870,2015-06-08,20629485,Gisselle,"Great location to stay at in Seattle. What you see is what you get in the pictures. If anything they don't do the space justice, you'll be pleasantly surprised with the space. Also, Aaleen was easy to get in contact with and always kept me in loop. Thanks Aaleen! "
6087451,35433776,2015-06-18,20487758,Liem,Reid and Aaleen were very cooperative. The apartment was very modernly furnished and equipped with everything you needed. Nice neighborhood as well!
6087451,35565530,2015-06-20,32999643,Margo,"What a great place! It large, well furnished, clean, and very comfortable. They provide everything you could need or might have forgotten to pack.There are great places within walking distance and plenty of parking. Aaleen and Reid were very responsive and they have a clipboard with listing of places to eat and check out. I would definitely stay here again! Highly recommended."
6087451,35935756,2015-06-23,33249353,Dominica,"Reid and Aaleen were warm, welcoming and quick to respond to my questions.  Space is recently renovated and super clean.  I love this neighborhood!  Stay here and you will be close to public transportation and lots of great restaurants.  I had a wonderful stay.  Highly recommended."
6087451,36557451,2015-06-29,34077619,Lance,"Perfect location- close to everything. Clean, renovated, private entry, easy. Both Reid and Aaleen were super responsive. 

Can't comment on the public transportation as I rented a car but their restaurant recommendations were GREAT! : ) "
6087451,36902298,2015-07-02,31612806,Teresa,"Lovely large modern basement apartment. Very, very comfortable. Good location for Fremont, 10 minutes walk to several bars and restaurants. Downtown is only 15 mins bus ride and you can catch it almost on your doorstop.
Reid and Allen are a nice, helpful couple but we didn't see all that much of them as we only stayed 2 nights.
Highly recommended."
6087451,37666993,2015-07-09,34694169,Michael,"The notes of welcome were much appreciated, as was the WiFi connection and the well stocked bathroom, the comfy pillows and bed, and the surprising bonus of a washer and dryer!  We didn't use the laundry facilities, but how great to have them in case we needed them.  Even in the unseasonably warm weather, the apartment was quite comfortable in the evenings, when opening the windows offered a lovely cross-breeze.  The remodeling is beautiful, and we were happy to note how our hosts are keeping as green as possible, down to the lovely raised bed garden.  We highly recommend this spot, as well as our hosts, who are as caring and considerate as one could ask."
6087451,38503299,2015-07-16,2274803,Aditya,"Really nice apartment with new fittings, close to restaurants and bars. Car parking is not an issue."
6087451,39759933,2015-07-26,18938102,Jacob,"Reid and Aaleen were terrific hosts. The location of their home is ideal for visiting Seattle and surrounding areas. The ground floor rental unit is super clean, upscale, and very comfortable for a stay. We briefly met Aaleen and she was very kind to have as a host. Street parking is easy (albeit on a typical Seattle-style hill).  The bathroom was very nice and clean as was the kitchen. We loved our stay and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this property or host to others!  Thanks again."
6087451,40124186,2015-07-28,36842903,Warren,"Reid & Aaleen's apartment was a great find. The accommodation is modern, comfortable and clean. The apartment has a well appointed kitchen and bathroom, with high quality towels and toiletries. They provide useful information and are very helpful and happy to provide any further assistance. The area is quiet, close to a really good restaurant and public transport.
Reed and Aaleen were really helpful and very charming, it was a pleasure to meet them and stay there. Thanks.

It's a great place to stay -- I could live in the space. The basement is pretty quiet and the separate entrance is nice. Everything I needed during my trip was taken care of. Would highly recommend and I'll likely stay here again."
6087451,41372131,2015-08-07,1513055,Amanda,"I can't say enough good things about Reid and Aaleen's Fremont studio. The apartment itself was clean, quiet and comfortable. A lot of thought was put into this apartment and it shows - It felt like home. The Fremont neighborhood is great, too. The apartment is close to the border of Fremont and Ballard, but Fremont coffee shops and restaurants are just a quick walk away, and it's a great way to experience a neighborhood first hand.  Ballard is a little bit of a hike if you're hoofing it, but busses, uber or rental cars are all easy options to reach other Seattle neighborhoods (we utilized all 3).

The attention to detail, great design and thoughtfulness that has gone into Reid and Aaleen's apartment is obvious. It raises the bar and we can't way to come back to Seattle soon and stay again. Thanks for the hospitality! "
6087451,41760949,2015-08-09,1994172,Betsy,"Everything about Fremont House Studio Apartment and our hosts was perfect!  Reid & Aaleen communicated quickly and effectively and told us everything we needed to know before we arrived.  Instructions in the apartment were clear and helpful.  There was even beer in the fridge when we got there....perfect!  The space was lovely -- sleek and sophisticated, beautiful and clean.  The location is awesome.  We had a fantastic time in Seattle and highly recommend this terrific apartment!!"
6087451,42411615,2015-08-13,1696059,Elizabeth,"This is my first time using Airbnb and because of the wonderful experience staying here I will definitely be using the service again! What I loved most about the unit was the private entrance and the very clean and modern feel to everything. We really enjoyed having a full kitchen which made it easy to take home and enjoy food bought at Pike Place Farmers Market, we even made a fruit smoothie during our stay. Another plus was having the Xbox with a good selection of games (my boyfriend definitely loved playing FIFA after a long day.) Another plus was having the option of doing laundry during our stay which we definitely took advantage of and came home from our trip with all clean clothes. The bathroom honestly felt like a spa in the way that it was decorated and has optional heater if you happen to be visiting during colder months (we didn't really use this as we stayed in August but tested it and it got the bathroom pretty warm!) In terms of size it was more than enough room for the 3 of us staying as their couch can double as a comfortable bed and the room was equipped with extra blankets however in case you made the same silly assumption I did, the bed pictures in the photos is not in a separate room in the unit behind a door- it's more of an open-concept in that sense and will be to your immediate right when you walk in (once again most of you may have realized that, but I didn't.) The privacy was amazing and we almost forgot we were staying in a home and not a hotel. The Fremont neighborhood was also very nice, walking around enjoying the Seattle air felt very safe and was beautiful. We used ""Uber"" throughout our trip rather than taxis and this place was always fairly close to everywhere we needed to go which was a plus! Last thing I'd like to mention is the amazing price, when looking up other hotels in the area for the month of August most we were over $300+ a night, some for only 2-star places. This unit was half the price and twice the stars so definitely worth the stay!"
6087451,44331669,2015-08-25,12166167,Madison,"Everything was great. The place was super stylish and cute. Just what we needed for our short vacation. In a great neighborhood. Very close to shops, restaurants and bars. I will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle! "
6087451,44553623,2015-08-27,30414052,Heather Brook,Loved the area! Aaleen & Reid answered all of our questions and the downstairs apartment was like having our own home and quiet space. Beautifully decorated and comfortable. Thanks again!!
6087451,45274938,2015-09-01,19933920,Jon,"Had an amazing stay at this gorgeous apartment ! The full kitchen, large TV, and remodeled bathrooms were huge bonuses that you could not get at your typical hotel or even other Airbnb location. It was in a great location, close to great restaurants and shops and the host provided local spots to check out. They included local transit maps and loads of materials to check out all of Seattle. Place was well kept and looked brand new as we walked in. 

The most impressive part was that there was a power outage due to crazy wind. Not only did the hosts have a generator and provided an extension cord to make sure that we had light and a place to charge our phones, but they also gave us a heads up when the power was back on and offered to have us hang out with them in their apartment until it was fixed. 

Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay and I would suggest everyone check it out!"
6087451,45514204,2015-09-03,32635136,Aunna,Thanks for Netflix! Clean & stylish! Private & well equipped kitchen & prefect location for exploring neighborhoods & car parking was easy. Definitely recommend for comfortable stay. Quick reply by host!
6087451,45959441,2015-09-07,746557,David,"Great place in a great location. Perfect for our needs. 

Communication was excellent.  We were given very clear instructions before our arrival, and all our messages were replied to promptly.

Highly recommended."
6087451,46356170,2015-09-09,14023983,Kate,"I had such a great experience staying here! Reid and Aaleen were welcoming and accommodating, despite my last-minute request. The space is  comfortable and clean, with every amenity you could dream of! I appreciated being able to do laundry during my stay, the French Press and coffee, and the Netflix on the TV! Thanks for making my days in-between apartments less like a hassle, and more like a vacation."
6087451,47047111,2015-09-15,38405295,Mikiah,"This was our first airbnb experience. So, one half of the couple was a little hesitant going into it. I'm happy to report he has been converted. Great place, great hosts. We got in late and left early. Enjoyed the stay! Will do it again next summer when we are in town again."
6087451,47333730,2015-09-17,494287,Lindsey,The place was great. Great neighborhood. Great value. The host were great to accept me on such short notice.
6087451,47507566,2015-09-19,35085811,Anthony,"It's my first time using AirBnb and the experience was great! Reid and Aaleen were very prompt in answering any questions that I had.  Their place was as described in the description.  As host, they were very welcoming."
6087451,47895603,2015-09-21,19603704,Wendy,The downstairs apt was just as described. It was very nice and new and we loved staying there. It was a quick walk to Freemont and walking across the bridge at night was awesome. Our hosts were great and we would recommend this place to anyone. 
6087451,48692904,2015-09-28,14101395,Ana,"Reid and Aaleen were such amazing hosts. They are very knowledgeable about what's around them and great at giving recommendations on where to go and what to see. Their basement apartment is in a great location. We used uber most of the time we were there and they cost no more than $15 at a time. The apartment is stocked with maps, magazines, and menus, so getting an idea of where you wanted to go was super easy. There is a bus stop super close by that will take you straight to pike place market, or around the area where all the tourist-y attractions are. Overall great experience.  Perfect description of what you are getting when you get stay with them. Definitely a place where you can't wait to stay again!"
6087451,49021435,2015-09-30,18323036,Cody,"The Fremont Studio was a perfect place to stay for the day and a half we were there. Fremont is a nice neighborhood with food and drinks within walking distance. It was a quick Uber ride away from Ballard which is also a nice area for food and about 10 min from downtown to all the tourist stuff.

We would definitely stay here again.

"
6087451,49797497,2015-10-06,3063753,Ying,"Reid & Aaleen’s place was super clean & comfortable — and conveniently located too, walkable to fun places like Frelard Pizza and Fremont Sunday Market. Would definitely book again. Thanks!"
6087451,50555326,2015-10-12,30511694,Heather,"The home was absolutely lovely, definitely looks like the pictures.  I didn't get a chance to really explore the neighborhood but driving through it, it looked so cute and somewhere where I could spend a lot of time.  

My one disappointment was that the hosts were apparently out of town the whole time and didn't tell me.  I texted them when I was on my way to the apartment and when I got there, but I didn't hear from them until the day I left that they were out of town and didn't have reception.  What if something had gone wrong?  I would have appreciated a heads up and maybe an alternate person to contact if I had needed something.  "
6087451,50897708,2015-10-15,28967423,Sarah Beth,Reid and Aaleen were wonderful hosts. They were very organized and responsive with instructions and details to help make our stay seamless and easy. The apartment was perfect. Clean and spacious with every amenity you could need or want. Location is very convenient and street parking is ample. I would highly recommend this studio apartment to anyone looking for a simply wonderful place to stay in Seattle.
6087451,51790492,2015-10-24,2086288,Matt,Reid and Aaleen's apartment was perfect for me. Brilliant location and neighborhood. Everything was made convenient and smooth by them.
6087451,52334233,2015-10-28,29849704,Mitchell,"Very nice and clean listing in a quite neighborhood.  Every room, including the bathroom and kitchen, were very clean and inviting.  No problem finding parking outside.  Appreciated the magazines and streaming tv that made downtime seem short.  Would not hesitate to stay again when in town.  "
6087451,52737055,2015-11-01,11878167,Candice,The place was clean and accurately described. We did not use it but the kitchen was well stocked. It was very spacious for a studio apartment.  We were aware of pets on the property but surprisingly only heard the dog bark once. I recommend this property.
6087451,53088410,2015-11-04,14329049,Cat,"Our stay at the Fremont House was fantastic! The location was perfect and we enjoyed the easy access to Fremont and Ballard. Tons of restaurants, coffee shops, and breweries in waking distance. The apartment was very clean and cozy, plus there were tons of amenities. The kitchen is super gorgeous and includes a dishwasher (which is often hard to come by in Seattle!) and there was a nice selection of coffee, apple cider, and hot chocolate available. The entertainment set up was awesome and included Netflix, games, and built in speakers that really set the mood and made watching a movie or listening to music even better. We could tell that Reid and Aaleen put a lot of thought into making this apartment as comfortable as possible. The best home away from home! Reid and Aaleen are fantastic hosts and made us feel very welcome! Hands down the best Airbnb experience that we have had. Thank you!"
6087451,54447217,2015-11-20,4004459,Katherine,"Convenient location, lovely apartment.  Great place to hunker down during a cold, rainy week in Seattle. "
6087451,54787875,2015-11-23,2397934,Sam,"The apartment was very modern and well appointed. The Xbox and Netflix (including surround sound!) were all very nice touches, and were well utilized. 

The only issue we ran into was that there seemed to be some pet dander from (I assume?) their dog that lived upstairs, which caused me to have an allergic reaction and one of my eyes to almost swell shut. Thankfully there is a Shell gas station across the street, so I was able to buy some eyedrops and allergy meds and get back to relaxing. 

Apart from this, we had a great weekend. The hosts were even so kind as to point out an item we threw out (intentionally), in case we unintentionally threw it out. "
6087451,55388642,2015-12-01,46076744,Ruth,"Though we have stayed at B & Bs domestically and internationally, this was our first airbnb experience.   This is a very lovely apartment in the lower level of their home.  Private key pad entry and street parking make it very accessible.   Fremont is also a great location to explore Seattle.  We plan to stay here again when we return to Seattle."
6087451,56320594,2015-12-12,2086288,Matt,Another great stay in Reid & Aaleen's terrific apartment. December in Seattle was getting a little windy and wet but it was cosy and incredibly convenient for Fremont & Ballard – my favourite bits of Seattle
6087451,56580595,2015-12-14,12459010,Anne,Beautiful place. Thanks for putting us up at  such short notice.
1048798,4298006,2013-04-25,5880131,Craig,"You must stay at this property!!! The home and the view are even more gorgeous than the pictures show. Sitting at the kitchen table or in the living room gave me a 180 degree view of the islands and the ferries crossing the sound. The house is incredibly well stocked and organized, and the owners are so nice and friendly. The neighborhood is very quite; the house sits on a small dead end road. However, in spite of the privacy and the view, this home is so close to Seattle and business. I am staying here every time I can. The best property I have found in the US yet!

"
1048798,4349212,2013-04-29,5960861,Joseph,"Amazing! The views are spectacular and the house is so nice! We particularly enjoyed the fireplace and jet tub overlooking the bay. Everything was spotless and well stocked (the plush bathrobes and towels felt luxurious). For two people the house was spacious and could easily fit a couple more on the murphy bed. Carter was wonderful, highly conscientious and made sure we were well taken care of. We will definitely make staying here a Seattle tradition!"
1048798,4457577,2013-05-06,5957585,Katrina,"Carter's home was phenomenal! 

The view, surprisingly private accommodations, and area are superb!  His hospitality and keen attention to detail surpassed our expectations and took our stay over the top. One can take a lovely (short, but challenging) walk to a serene beach and absorb the most spectacular performance of nature with a talented cast of wildlife, water, snow capped peaks, and glistening coastlines.  The spacious patio is balcony seating for the show, and would tempt a visit even in the dead of winter.  It had us fixated during our four 70 plus degree sunny days and three starry nights.  Even though there were two awesome flat screen televisions, neither ever saw the 'on' button as the view was all the entertainment we needed.  The kitchen is fit for a multiple course gourmet experience if it is desired.  Carter left nothing without his detailed personal touch right down to making certain there was distilled water for the iron.  Each bed had high thread count and high quality linens with plenty of extras if needed.  The decor was worthy of an interior design periodical photo shoot while still cradling us with every comfort.  Our stay here made a harrowed wedding weekend a vacation experience instead of a family obligation!  Thank you Carter--we cannot wait to visit again!"
1048798,4637489,2013-05-17,2523621,Brian,"I cannot find fault with Carter or his simply magnificent house in any way. Carter was a wonderful host who was very easy to communicate with and goes the extra mile to make sure his guests are made welcome.
The house is beautiful and the view is simply breathtaking. Sitting on the deck watching the ferries arrive and depart with the mountains in the background whilst eating breakfast is the best way I have ever started a day.
The kitchen was well stocked with every utensil you could need and everything was of a high quality.
Very easy to get to from the airport and only a 10 minute drive from downtown Seattle I will definitely be returning to this home away from home in the near future."
1048798,4682368,2013-05-20,2176204,Michael,"My boys and I had a relaxing weekend at Carter's house. The first thing you notice is the layered view of Puget Sound, Vashon Island, and the mountains beyond. There is a definite ""wow"" factor upon entry (for all of us). Throughout  the weekend I kept saying, ""What a view!"" Hands down this is the most amazing  view I have experienced in over 15 airbnb Seattle houses. The next thing you notice is how spacious and well appointed the interiors are. The ""U"" shaped floor plan maximizes view/light, while creating a protected court/deck, which we enjoyed two fine sunset (facing West) dinners on.  This does not look like a rental or 2nd home, but a residence of someone who cares about one's quality of life. This is evident with the many amenities: comfortable furniture; a multitude of spices to use; high end cookware; dimmers everywhere; plush towels; a harem of pillows; lots of reading material ( I love Wallpaper design mag); aromatherapy; etc. I also have to mention the huge jaccuzzi with a view. I am not a tub/bath guy, but my kids were enjoying it so much that I had to try it (with grass sea salts!). I also appreciated the garage parking which made loading/unloading a breeze. The proximity is perfect for discovering West Seattle. We enjoyed the Seattle take on Hawaiian food at Spring Hill's new Ma'Ono, but we will have to be back for the pork belly sandwich at the Swinery. The kids played in the sand while I sunbathed at Lincoln Park. We played with crabs at Alki Beach, and rolled down the hill and took in a city view at Duwamish Head an Seacrest Marina Parks. I tend to explore the local neighborhood of the airbnb house I stay in, but this is also a quick ride to downtown Seattle. I would be happy not leaving this house and just reading, sipping coffee(am)/wine(pm), listening to the birds, sunbathing, and watching the Vashon/Fauntleroy ferry circle back and forth like a clock in the water. Carter was helpful and flexible to meet our needs. By demand of my kids, and for my own well being, we will return for another peaceful weekend.
 "
1048798,4792950,2013-05-26,6314634,Diana,"This was our first AirBnb experience and the only reason I would hesitate in leaving a most amazing review is the concern that this house might not be available the next time I want it!  I am delighted about an opportunity for people to make places like this available - it's was awesome for me and my husband and hopefully as beneficial for Carter.  We took advantage of his guidebook and totally enjoyed his suggestions, particularly Local Barley & Vine.  As for the house, I wondered if Carter would entertain an offer that I could afford - what a house and what a location.  On top of that, the ameneties were a surprise - This is a home that Carter is allowing us to stay in - his home.  I was in awe that someone would be so brave as to share this beautiful home that is so beautifully furnished, and so grateful.

Two notes - one is that the bed is definately firm.  Although not normally my favorite, I slept great!!!  Second, this is the second time I've been bitten by the scheduling difference in personal rental sites compared to hotel bookings.  When booking in a hotel through a particular date, say booking through the 25th, hotels will consider the check-out date the following morning, on the 26th.  This is not necessarily the case for this type of site.  So be sure that when you look at your confirmation email (which, by the way,  the communication via AirBnb is excellent) to ensure that you are clear about the check out date.

Overall, I can't say enough about how delighted we were to stay in Carter's house and to interact with him.  He is dedicated to making this a wonderful experience for all his guests and he certainly suceeded with us.  Again, I just wish I had just had more time to enjoy this home.  Thanks Carter!!!"
1048798,4906373,2013-06-01,6182524,Justin,"There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said in previous reviews. The house is fantastic, with an absolutely magnificent view (especially when the clouds break and you get to see the Olympic mountain range). The home is tastefully decorated, well equipped and very comfortable! Carter has literally everything you can think of available in the kitchen, and quality utensils/appliances. The wood stove and fire place are quite nice on those colder Seattle mornings. There is a massive deck, which you could probably enjoy a little more July, August, September months. The ensuite bathroom is a haven of itself! Jacuzzi tub and view was probably the highlight of our stay! And of course the Coffee! We hopped on the ferry to Vashon Island the last morning of our, it was fun to see where the ferry headed every 20 mins across Puget Sound. Seattle is a wonderful city, with a ton of things to do and this cozy hideaway was practically 15 mins drive from everywhere. The only downfall of Seattle is the cost of parking! Parking in a day was more expensive than the rental car. But it was more than worth it. We thoroughly loved Seattle, and especially Carter's rental home. We will definitely book here again our next trip to Seattle. Thanks  for everything Carter! Ps. The three Regions was great coffee. Ladros was our favorite coffee spot! "
1048798,4973432,2013-06-04,1829112,Elizabeth,"Carter's house is absolutely gorgeous. The view from the deck/Jacuzzi/living room is jaw dropping and the whole home is comfortable and inviting. It's a great place for a quiet, romantic weekend but it also has plenty of room for a family. Setting up the visit with him was a breeze. This is going to be our go-to place to stay in Seattle!"
1048798,5016581,2013-06-07,6736617,Dhebi,"Omg!  I don't want people to know about Carter's place! I want it to be MY secret- because everyone will want to go there!!
     This trip was literally last minute- I didn't contact Carter until a couple of hours before I needed to check in, and honestly, I didn't think it could be done on such short notice.  To my delight, Carter responded very promptly and in a flash- it was a done deal!  My first Airbnb experience!
     Carter's place is specTACular!!  The minute you walk in, you consider yourself one of the luckiest people in the world to have stumbled upon this magnificent place!  The VIEW is absolutely breathtaking, and you can see it from almost every single room!
     We were blessed with stupendously amazing sunny days, so we spent a lot of time out on the large deck where we lazily watched the ferries come and go, enjoyed our meals, played some board games, and later enjoyed magnificent sunsets. 
     The four of us were very comfortable- and Carter has anticipated every need- I really cannot think of a thing that he did not have available. 
     As a host, Carter was very thorough with directions and information, and the whole process could not have gone more smoothly!!   Carter kept in touch every step of the way to make sure we got checked in ok, and that we had everything we needed. I didn't meet Carter in person,  but, through his messages, he seemed to be a very personable guy, very friendly- and if his book collection says anything, he is very interesting and fun!   I hope to meet him in person next time- I will definitely be going back to Carter's house!

1048798,5177778,2013-06-17,5803754,Gaston,"We are still OVERWHELMED! 
I don´t think that words can correctly describe what we felt and lived at Carter`s place. From the descriptions,the reviews and pictures  we read and saw we already thought that it would be a nice place to stay. But when we eventually were there, we immediately felt at home. This house is awesome! We loved it so much that we did not want to go out in the evening (except for dinner). We loved to sit on the deck or in the livingroom with a nice glass of wine, watching the sunset over Puget Sound and the ships crossing the bay. We rented vacation houses before in various places, but we never experienced such a cosy and great place like this! In a way it is a Zen experience, sit back and live the moment, enjoy.... 
And all (and even more) you need is there, the house has been furnitured with love. As a music freak I enjoyed the sound system a lot. Sam, my wife who paints, was so impressed by the view that she had to paint it...
Our hosts, Carter and Dan, are wonderful and exceptional people: always caring, giving us great ideas about what to see in Seattle and surroundings, providing us an extensive list of shops and restaurants that would suit us and surprising us with their gentleness, friendliness, genuinety and originality.
And we are very grateful we had the chance to get to know them and become friends.
We will be back there, for sure.

This house will be a big success story here at airbnb and everyone who is considerating to rent it should book early in  advance....
We are already missing this place and hope that we can stay there again in future times (although it will be in great demand)."
1048798,5277934,2013-06-22,1794666,Wilda,"I'm sorry it took so long for my review! We were away from the internet until now! But what I planned on being just a short precursor to a once-in-a-lifetime cruise, Carter and his home turned out to be one of the highlights of our entire trip! My children and I can't stop talking about the great home we stayed at, and the wonderful time we had in Seattle--all because of our host, Carter Pecce! We are still newbies to Airbnb so if there are any others out there trying to decide about renting here, let me assure you that you need not have any hesitation with Carter and his listing!  It was my first visit to Seattle and I took my 3 children so I was anxious about all the details of a trip like this. But from the very start, Carter was quick to respond to my many questions, and replied in such a comprehensive way, telling me so much about himself, his place, and the area, that I felt very comfortable in my plans with him. He also was very professional for the actual transaction, and I was both fortunate and grateful to have an offer from him that was more than fair! 
When we arrived (he had arranged transportation for us late in the evening from the airport!) we found that he had thought of so much more than we did-leaving notes on how to work the sound system, the air conditioner, more blankets, how to use the shower, etc, etc.  The shower you say?  Yes. Let me just tell you that my children were fighting over who was next in line for this wonderful time where you feel like you are in a rainforest!  And the tiles in his bathroom are heated, which was great after a relaxing hot tub bath! The kitchen has everything you could ever need, too!
He was attentive to helping us make the most of our visit (but definitely not over involved for those of you who don't need input like we did), telling us the best places to go, and not to go (we were doing the Seattle-in-3-days-kind-of-thing). His recommendations and  inside info of Seattle (and everything for that matter!) kept my teenage boys interested the whole time-they thought he was great! And after he helped us out and drove us downtown when we made the wrong decision not to keep our rental car longer, my kids asked me if he and I knew each other from before because he has such an engaging personality and a real solid character!
I would be proud to call Carter my friend and look forward to returning to (email hidden)d his place. So don't rent it when I do go back there-that will be the only place I will stay!"
1048798,5639687,2013-07-09,1747414,Juan,Amazing and clean home. Carter was awesome and showed us how to use all the great features of the house and made us feel welcome. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to feel like home away from home. Thanks again Carter!
1048798,5757294,2013-07-15,2020206,Carol,"Dazzling is pretty darn accurate!  Great location and plenty of good energy with light filled spaces, a large deck that works anytime of day but beware it will be tough to pull yourself away.  Especially terrific LR & DR for entertaining with outstanding views of Vashon Island and ferries cruising back & forth....truly mesmerizing and everything the picture shows.  Best of all is your host Carter whom I found extremely thorough and attentive and a great resource for whatever we needed.  Thank you for sharing Carter!   "
1048798,5843074,2013-07-19,6269803,Dave,"What an experience.  I still fondly recall sitting on the deck in the morning with my coffee watching the ferries in the Puget Sound and the hummingbirds jetting about.  And enjoying a glass of red wine in the evenings watching the sunset.  The two bathrooms were a godsend for a family with a teenage daughter and made for easy morning time before heading out for the day.  The kitchen was very well stocked and we cooked up our great finds from the Pike Place Market.  The expansive supply of herbs and spices was a very nice touch.  
We considered staying close to downtown Seattle, but the fact that most of those rentals did not have AC meant we would have the windows open for a July stay.  And I thought it would be too noisy.  Carter's house has AC and the evenings were so quiet that I thought there must be an ordinance prohibiting dogs from being outside after dark!  I really enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with a view of Puget Sound and the rainfall showerhead.  It really made it hard to leave the house and get about our tourist activities.  The bed in the master bedroom was great.  Although it did not rain during our visit, we enjoyed the use of the private garage.  And the washer and dryer was a definite plus.
There's so much to do in West Seattle that we were able to avoid the Seattle traffic for much of the time.  Kayaking, biking, and great walking along the Alki beaches was so close.  And we found our favorite restaurant, La Rustica, the last night we were there.  Many cool coffee houses in the area to enjoy as well.  The only downside to the trip was that it wasn't longer."
1048798,5964996,2013-07-24,6555389,Janet,Our stay at Carters house was incredible! The house was clean and very well kept. The house had everything you could want and even more. The jacuzzi tub was fantastic and the rain head shower made you feel like you were standing in a waterfall. My husband and I and father and daughter stayed at the house for a wedding. The 2 bathrooms made it easy for the 4 of us to get ready every day. The beds were comfortable and the views are indescribable. Sitting on  the deck in the evening watching the ferries go by and the sunset was the perfect ending to the day. Its a very nice quiet neighborhood and easy to get to a bus stop to go downtown. Carter answered all our questions promptly and gave many suggestions for places to eat and a website for easy downtown parking. I would stay here again in a heartbeat! 
1048798,6025097,2013-07-27,918377,Ari,"Carter's house is amazing! The view from the back deck, even more amazing!

Only a few minutes from all of the main tourist locations we planned to visit, yet the view off the back deck left us feeling like we'd rented a house on one of Seattle's tiny private islands. 

Giant windows provide a constant view of the ferries down below coming and going, and the deck is perfect for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Everything worked perfectly, and the murphy bed was reported to be the softest bed of the entire stay by my brother and sister in-law who had come up to Seattle earlier in the week. 

We would definitely stay at Carter's again. Perfect for a family, a romantic get away or just a night in Seattle. 

Highly recommend. Thanks Carter!"
1048798,6236170,2013-08-05,5803257,Elizabeth,"The views at this West Seattle home are indeed Dazzling!  Carter is an exceptional host, with lots of contact and help. 

The accommodations are clean, well appointed, and comfortable.  The kitchen is well stocked, and supplies are plentiful.  Nice open floor plan. There is plenty of room for visitors' luggage and 'stuff'.  

This is a good house for a visit to Seattle with its many gray days.  However, after a full week of bright sun, we wished for some shade on the patio especially (an umbrella would be great).   

Nonetheless we did enjoy watching ship traffic, changing light, and  the beauty of the Salish Sea.  Thanks to Carter and Dan for sharing a beautiful home.    "
1048798,6488125,2013-08-14,6988786,Pat,"The view from this home is phenomenal!  Sitting on the deck overlooking Puget Sound and Vashon Island with the Olympic Mountains as a backdrop is an amazing experience.  We enjoyed the quiet of the West Seattle neighborhood yet found the home to be very convenient to visiting the sights both in and around the city with our rental car.  The owner was a wonderful communicator and did his utmost to answer all our questions about the house as well as provide suggestions of things to do and places to eat in the area.  Our only regret was that we didn't have more time to spend sitting out on the deck reading, relaxing and enjoying the panoramic view."
1048798,6586771,2013-08-18,6681012,Yingying,"great view!! stunning! what else i should say:) and also boys had a lot of fun after walking down to the beach area
thank you 谢谢"
1048798,6777678,2013-08-25,5487377,Carla,"The house, view, and host Carter are all gems. I almost hesitate to review this place because I'd hate for the news to get out how fabulous it is and then it will be perpetually booked and we'll never be able to stay there again! The test of good vacation is how well you can relax, and this house seemed like a home away from home, and was very romantic for a couple to share. It was in such a unique location and in close proximity to transportation, beaches, and ferries and in a quiet neighborhood, and yet feeling so homey it still gave us the adventurous ease to go out and venture to parts unknown. Carter is also a wonderful host and was very accommodating to some special personal requests we had which made our stay even that much better."
1048798,7010837,2013-09-03,3141118,Chianne,"Carter's place is incredibly peaceful and cozy. The view is indeed amazing, and so relaxing.  I loved watching the ferries go back and fourth and the sunsets on the large patio were just perfect. My week long stay was very comfortable. The house has everything you need, and more. I especially appreciated all the amenities, coffee maker, toaster, washer/dryer, music selection with surround sound, the list goes on and on. Communication with Carter was seamless. Check in and out could not have been any easier. He was a very helpful and gracious host. Thanks again for making my trip to Seattle one to remember forever! "
1048798,7116883,2013-09-07,7728833,JoAnn,"This comfortable home is located in a charming neighborhood, near restaurants, shopping, and a beautiful park. Not too far from Alki Beach, it is a great area to begin a trip in Seattle. The home is wonderful with the most spectacular view of Puget Sound. The views of the Sound change daily with the weather. Every convenience is provided for the guests. I cannot imagine staying anyplace else. "
1048798,7302984,2013-09-15,7423994,Joanne,"Thank you Carter for sharing your home! I stayed here last month while in town for my son""s wedding. After a hectic day I was able to entertain family members then relax in the jacuzzi tub or the rainforest shower. Even at night the sound was a lovely view and I enjoyed watching the ferrys. I opted for the murphy bed instead of the bedroom because the view was so fabulous! The area was alot of fun. I found some great places to eat within 5 minutes drive. California Ave was a fun area to walk around. The area is ripe with little treats and adventures!
I will definetly stay here again. It was a wonderful experience! "
1048798,7577389,2013-09-25,5268851,Shalia,"We stayed for a couple of nights after our wedding.  The view is astonishing - you can see both ferries right outside the window!  The decor is very cute and the place is clean and organized.  

The bed was extremely comfortable and we even had robes, just like a hotel room.  We especially liked the master bathroom with jacuzzi tub, rain shower and heated tile floors.  

Carter was out of town, so he hired a property manager for the duration of our stay.  We didn't need the manager, but it was nice to know someone was nearby should the need arise.  

We absolutely loved staying here!  I can't really think of any negatives.  The only thing might be that there was no house manual and it took us a minute to figure out the heating system, but everything else was pretty self-explanatory (there was a sheet with directions for the TV/Wi-Fi)."
1048798,7996953,2013-10-12,4114489,Carol,"This rental home is simply beyond wonderful!  All the pictures that were uploaded by the landlord are a true depiction of the home.  Quite lovely, comfortable, and very well appointed.  The beds were amazingly comfortable and I couldn't have asked for more in terms of furnishings, kitchen, bath, amenities, etc.  The views were spectacular and the neighborhood quiet, lovely, and very private.  Carter was a wonderful host and stopped by for a visit we had planned; surprising me with the most wonderful dessert and coffee I have ever had.  What hospitality and what a wonderful person!  Kind, considerate, and helpful doesn't even begin to describe this gentleman!  This home rental is everything you could possibly want or need and so affordable.  This is a West Seattle treasure that is also a stone's throw from downtown Seattle by car or the very convenient public transportation that abounds throughout Seattle.  Look no further you have found your vacation dream home and a warm and wonderful friend in this host.   "
1048798,8065119,2013-10-14,9218804,Anora,The view was so beautiful it relaxed me right away!  The house was clean and well tended.  Carter was a pleasure to communicate with.          We would highly recommend this house to any of our friends! 
1048798,8400860,2013-10-28,1309644,Katie,"It was a quick trip & the home was absolutely AMAZING! I will absolutely plan on staying there again in the future when I have more time. What a beautiful escape from the craziness of the world and yet SO CLOSE to downtown if you choose to experience it. 
CLEAN & easy to rent. THANK YOU CARTER! "
1048798,8496689,2013-11-03,4172370,Kim,"Warning! You will not want to leave this primo property after arriving. The premises are immaculate, well cared for, beautifully decorated, located in a quiet neighborhood and a view to be appreciated. We were lucky enough to spend 3 days in October with weather made to order. 
Location is easily accessible to bus routes to downtown, and water taxis to Vashon.

Carter was so helpful in providing information prior to our stay, and welcomed us when we arrived, truly exceptional hospitality.

The only hesitation I have in writing this outstanding review, is that the property will become so popular that it will be booked up when I'm ready to re-visit Seattle.

Thank you Carter SO MUCH for sharing your slice of paradise. Hope to see you next year!
Kim and Pete"
1048798,9050653,2013-12-03,3966827,Nick,"Gorgeous place! Comfortable, well-appointed, and what a view! My family really enjoyed staying here over our Thanksgiving holiday. Carter was a consummate host, making sure we had everything we needed and checking in occasionally. Highly recommended!"
1048798,9355490,2013-12-23,10567742,Bryan,"Wonderful place!  Couldn't recommend any higher.  Host is helpful, the place is clean, and the view fantastic.  I will definitely be going back. "
1048798,9580869,2014-01-03,5935330,Peggy,"Our host Carter could not have been more attentive and prepared for our visit. This was a 10 day family vacation during the Christmas Holidays. I really wanted to be able to host Christmas for our family members who live in Seattle and Carter went the extra mile in decorating the house. Words can not explain the view, not only from the deck but from other vantage points including the sunken tub. We did a lot of cooking and there was everything we needed in a fully stocked kitchen. the sound and lighting system was divine. It all felt like home and we can not wait to return. It was centrally located, the neighborhood was lovely, we took long walks and the surrounding area of Lincoln Park is beautiful. We saw so many beautiful birds (hawks and even an Owl!) and the cargo ships and ferries are delightful to keep track of. Thank you Carter for such a beautiful trip to your beautiful city!"
1048798,9782511,2014-01-09,7988787,Anne,"We had SUCH a lovely stay at Carter's wonderful house!  The taste level and wonderful feeling you get when staying here, says a LOT about the love put into this house and the owners!  the location is the best in Seattle, since you can get anywhere very easily.  The garden is so lovely, the colors, decor, and comfort level at the house is absolutely perfect.  The views are gorgeous!!  Last, but certainly not least, was the fantastic communication by Carter!!  He truly exceeded our expectations and went above and beyond making this AirBNB process seamless!!  Highly recommended!"
1048798,10126866,2014-02-01,6940727,Jonathan,"Carter's house is such a relaxing place to slow down and let mother natures incredible view takeover. You will have access to a fully functioning kitchen, a living room and dining room with breathtaking views of the Pugent Sound and the master bedroom with one of the nicest bathrooms I have seen in a long time. You can take a relaxing bath and still watch the ferries come in. If you like peace and quiet you are going to love this place! 
Carter was very responsive and upfront with any information I needed. 
"
1048798,10543858,2014-02-24,9359570,Tiffany,"Yet again AirBNB has given me the ability to stay at a breathtaking home. Carter's place is cozy and has the best view of the bay ever. His house is an artist's dream. It's cozy, inspirational, and welcoming. I will be back with my husband for a romantic trip next. 
"
1048798,10627875,2014-02-28,12338340,Luc,"What an excellent place. I was looking for a cozy home with a good view where I could take a personal writing retreat, and this place exceeded my already high expectations (based on other reviews). I was able to work in comfort and without distraction. I lucked out and got wonderfully clear weather. The views from the living room and tub are to die for, and the outside space is large and private. The whole property is decorated with a keen eye for detail and an elegant hand. All seating and beds are extremely comfortable. The kitchen, living rooms, and bathrooms are well appointed. And I really enjoyed the different lighting options, the fireplace, and convenience of a washer/ dryer. 

For folks looking to get out and about, a car would be helpful. (And the property has a garage.) I didn't have one and made out perfectly fine, since I wasn't looking to leave often. The coffee shop, public library, and park within a couple miles' walk were a treat.

Carter was exceptionally responsive and reliable -- both quick to reply and informative -- from booking, to arranging a hired driver from the airport, to checkout. I couldn't have asked for more. A lovely and successful writing retreat. Thanks, Carter!  "
1048798,10868268,2014-03-10,4860757,Wanwei,"Carter' home is a fantastic place due to it can make you want to stay there forever. First day, we had some trouble to get there and night wind was so cold. Therefore, when I entered the house, I was touched! Warm air was full of everywhere and floor heating brought my body and heart totally into the house. Moreover, the view was incredible opening and beautiful, I could see entire lake and ""dome"" sky that decorated a lot of stars. I recommend that huddle up in sofa and drink a tea/coffee; take a bubble bath which is in master bedroom during a raining day of Seattle. Furthermore, the house has a bit of far away downtown, renting a car is probably better choice. "
1048798,11291961,2014-03-28,13397363,Christine,"This was our first experience with Airbnb.   We were happy that we started with Carter's house.  It was absolutely impressive - from home deco, facilities, cleanliness, sea view from the house, to Carter's clear direction and hospitality. 

Carter's house was so cozy that we ended up spending almost 2 of the 3 days' of stay in the house.  No point going anywhere with the spectacular sea view from the house.  

If i come back one day to Seattle for a visit, I would definitely book Carter's house again.

My trip to Seattle was fantastic and I couldn't have asked for a better vantage point from which to enjoy my spring break. Thanks to Carter for being so hospitable both in my preparations to arrive and also throughout my stay. I have already recommended this place to others and I intend to come back!"
1048798,13031562,2014-05-18,11973786,Tricia,"Carter's house is beautiful. During our stay we felt very relaxed. It's situated in a peaceful location yet convenient to get around the city. Staying here you are spoilt with the most amazing views - believe  me you won't want to leave.  The house is very clean and tidy and is fully equipped with everything you need, lovely fluffy white bath towels too. My husband told me Cater's home has the best shower ever, it's like standing under a waterfall.

Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Carter but he was extremely prompt in replying to my messages, very helpful and friendly. 

The photos of Carter's home are accurate and I would not hesitate in recommending a stay here. "
1048798,13778547,2014-06-04,11493303,Donna,"The host was very accommodating and communication was terrific.
We enjoyed the house and our time in Seattle. We had dinner out on the back deck overlooking the water and sunset which was beautiful."
1048798,14948038,2014-06-30,5715010,Mark,"The title for this home certainly does not over sell itself. The view is dazzling. As soon as you walk in through the front door you can start to see it. And from the deck and lounge it is just great. We loved it.

The house is very well equipped - particularly the kitchen. We cooked a lot and although small had everything we needed. All the herbs and spices were a great addition!

The house layout would ideally suit a couple. We were four adults and as long as one couple is happy to use a Murphy bed in the lounge (we were) then it works too. The downside is that only one couple gets the amazing bathroom connected to the main bedroom - views from the bath!

Although we never met Carter he was a great host. He was extremely responsive and gave us a ton of information about the house so we knew exactly what to expect. There is a lot of information about the house and about the local area in the house as well.

The house is situated in a quiet residential area above Lincoln Park and the ferry terminal. It is perfect if you are exploring Seattle as we were. We even left Seattle on the ferry we'd been watching cross Pujet Sound for three days :)

There is nothing to add other than to say this was exactly what I wanted from this first part of a North West road trip.


"
1048798,15269042,2014-07-06,4148808,R,"Carter's house was fantastic.  The location was wonderful...a quiet street but accessible to everything.  It was a great launching-off point for our Seattle vacation.  We could watch the ferries come and go all day and enjoy a nearly direct walk to Lincoln Park.  The house itself was exactly as described: clean, comfortable, and with everything one could want.  A lovely home away from home."
1048798,15496038,2014-07-10,12789398,Tim,"This was my family's first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better.  Booking was a breeze thanks to Carter's quick, friendly responses.  The house was clean, comfortable and private.  We loved having a nice kitchen to cook in and we all enjoyed the large jacuzzi tub and rainfall shower.  Carter was super accommodating, offering to set up an extra bed so my sons didn't have to share the murphy bed and even rearranging his schedule to allow us a few extra hours on our last day!  If you're looking for a place to rent in Seattle, look no further.  My only regret is that we didn't get to meet Carter, he seems like he'd be a great, fun tour guide."
1048798,15833443,2014-07-16,17048608,Tari,"This was our first experience using AirBnB and it could not have been better. Carter is a tremendous host with a beautiful, well cared for home. Careful thought has been put into every detail to make this a fabulous experience, down to the teddy bear and chocolates on the pillow! Everything either met or exceeded our expectations across the board. We will definitely be back!"
1048798,16196185,2014-07-23,12256852,Christopher,"There's not much that I can add that hasn't already been said by others.  Great host, excellent communication and a wonderful home.  The view from this home is stunning, it's also well appointed and has everything we needed to create a wonderful vacation.  One note that I haven't seen much from others is that I recommend using Carter's guidebook.  We ate at both Cactus and the Eliott Bay Brewery and were very happy with our experiences.  Carter also recommended Lincoln Park for my boys, they found a zip line there which was the highlight of the trip for them -- right, even Space Needle and Mount Rainier placed below the zip line!  Overall, excellent experience.  Thanks."

So appreciated the cleanliness and the details that made our stay enjoyable and comfortable.  Our daughter's loved waking up to the beautiful views.  I especially  enjoyed morning coffee and reading on the deck with the spectacular view.  Will absolutely stay again.  "
1048798,16964870,2014-08-04,5190581,Melissa,"Carter was so gracious in opening up his beautiful home to me and family. Everything was amazing, from the views of the Sound, to the layout of the home and quiet neighborhood. It was the perfect retreat. He made everything so easy and let us know if we needed anything don't hesitate to ask. I would definitely stay here again and recommend to all!"

Whether you are a couple looking for romance, a family looking for a great place to stay while visiting all the wonders this area has to offer, seniors looking for a home base while visiting Seattle and its environs or ANY combination of the above!   Stay here!

We traveled with my Mom, an 86-year old with mobility problems, our  1-year old son, my 12-year old daughter and my husband and I.  Talk about challenging needs for a home and host to meet, but the house exceeded our expectations and Carter, as you will read from numerous other reviews, is FANTASTIC.   He went 1,000% above and beyond for us.   He secured a pack-n-play from a friend so we wouldn't have to schlep ours; he put out an extra bed for us, gave us great recommendations on things to do in the area and even helped point us in the direction of a great rental car.  And, that's not all:  we arrived to a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers, a teddy bear for the baby and rubber duckies in the tub.

Let me describe the house and amenities:  fabulous.   You wake to glorious views and, in the evenings, Mother Nature didn't disappoint.  Picturesque sunsets behind the Olympic mountains.  The patio which has reclining chairs plus 2 tables is perfect for relaxing or entertaining, & has an unobstructed view of Elliot bay/Puget sound.    

The master bath is a hedonist's dream.   The waterfall shower was a delight, but selfishly I enjoyed the Jacuzzi tub almost daily.    R & R for the traveler or anyone in need of some relaxation.  The view of the sound from the tub is perfect.

The big screen TV in the living room is wonderful for movie watching which my daughter was thrilled about.   There's Xfinity On Demand so movie options are very good.

The kitchen is well-stocked with dishes, supplies, cookware.  We cooked almost daily.

The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful with EASY access to everywhere.   25 - 30 min from the airport.   15 - 20 min from Seattle.   We had family in West Seattle, so that's why we stayed there.  Having stayed 10 days, I wouldn't change a thing.   I am glad we chose this location, as opposed to the city proper.

We drove to Snoqualmie Falls which was a great and easy drive.  We trekked a bit up Mt. Ranier which was breathtakingly beautiful.   Visited all the touristy places also:  Pike Place Market, The Chihuly Glass museum { LOVED IT.  Worth a visit whether you know his work or not.  If you don't you SHOULD.  :-) }, Experience Music Project, the Needle, etc.  Took an Argosy cruise.   

The best part about this trip, besides the house and Carter, was being surrounded by so many lovely vistas and so much nature !

If you can stay here, you won't be disappointed !

The house was immaculate, with breathtaking views of the Puget Sound.  It included all the amenities you could think of, as well as directions to use anything within the house.  We very much enjoyed this house and would most definitely stay here again if ever back in the Seattle area in the future.  Carter was beyond a gracious host, providing information on how to contact him in case we ever needed anything.  Thank you very much for your hospitality.  "

Everything is set up so that you can easily find things. We felt right at home almost immediately. The area is quiet and also close enough to anything you may need. Our only regret is that we could not stay longer, but we hope to return someday and Carter's home will always be our top choice. "
1048798,18738926,2014-08-31,1740282,Dawn,"Carter made our last few days vacation in Seattle a piece of cake! Even though we didn't get the chance to meet face to face, he was super friendly and extremely timely with his responses to any questions we had. His place was clean, inviting and very comfortable. What a fantastic deck overlooking the Sound! I was a little leery about sleeping on a Murphy Bed, since I had never done so previously, but it is REALLY comfortable AND the waking up to that view….SPECTACULAR!!! We also enjoyed watching the ferries come and go. The neighborhood is quiet and we felt very safe staying there. It was also nice to be able to park in his garage…especially on a rainy day. We didn't utilize the kitchen for mealtime, but we did find 2 new places for dinner. If you are looking for a burger, check out Zippy's. They have a rockin' black bean burger for vegetarians. If Mexican is what you crave, check out Cactus up on Alki. WOW! Great stuff!!
 We enjoyed every minute of our stay at Carter's and would absolutely stay at his place again!

"
1048798,19132956,2014-09-07,18688927,Kelly,The house is as beautiful in person as it was in the pictures!!  Carter followed up with us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed - which of course we did.  Carter's house was well stocked with the essentials.  It was a great location to walk to two different bus stops.  We would definitely stay here when we return to Seattle!!
1048798,19590348,2014-09-15,5877471,Julie,"Carter is an exceptionally attentive host. His home exceeded our expectations. It was a truly wonderful experience that I won't soon forget, Highly recommend this rental, it is by far my all-time favorite airbnb rental :-)"
1048798,19780307,2014-09-18,1203930,Anastasia,"My boyfriend, my two daughters and myself were lucky to score such a great spot! First of all, Carter kept in close contact until we arrived; making sure there was nothing more he could do to make our stay more enjoyable. I couldn't think of much besides a night light for my kids since it was a new environment which Carter happened to already have. Nevertheless, we had been up since 4 in the morning to catch our flight and get to Seattle which landed at 9am. After getting our rental car and heading downtown for a great breakfast and walking around Pike Place Market we texted Carter to see if he could accommodate an early check-in. Unfortunately, that didn't work out to our advantage because there were guests that checked out that morning and the cleaning lady needed every minute to get the place prepped for us. So, foolishly I had gone to the grocery store prematurely and ended up taking the fan to Lincoln Park which I have to say might be one of my favorite parks--EVER! It's just a 5 minute drive from Carter's place and it's a must do. Go get lost in one of the many trails of red wood trees and stroll down to the beach (no sand, all stones--yet, GORGEOUS). So, although we were unable to check-in early it ended up being a good thing else we most likely hadn't have stumbled onto Lincoln Park. When 3 o'clock rolled around we were exhausted and honestly, a tad on the edge but as soon as we walked in the door we were immediately at peace! It was so much bigger and nicer than I had anticipated. It was IMMACULATE and the views were just absolutely breath taking. I'm from California and I am spoiled rotten with views and sunsets but this place still made my jaw drop and my family was super stoked too! I have no complaints whatsoever, it had everything you could possibly need including very nice kitchen ware (I love to cook). It was also nice that there were spices, in addition to other unexpired items left behind in the fridge from prior guests. We ended up leaving quite a few things behind too--so enjoy! Oh! And the shower in the master bedroom was incredible, as was the jacuzzi tub which we were all able to enjoy, especially the girls. Carter definitely set the bar high for other Airbnb hosts--he's definitely got it all figured out and doesn't take short cuts as far as quality goes. I could go on but I'm reaching my limit--so, in summation, if you're willing to commute to the city (10 min max) this place is a gem and you should look no further. But do be aware that there is a cleaning fee of $100 PLUS state tax which I did not see until after I booked--probably my fault for being too excited to read the fine print. Still all very worth it."
1048798,19932419,2014-09-21,16262213,Maggie,"Ahhh... where do I begin :)
Myself and three other girls stayed in Carter's home over the weekend - and it was absolutely perfect. When we walked in, we all freaked out at the view, it was breathtaking. Even better than the pictures. The house looked amazing, very clean and presentable, clear directions on where everything was located - wifi password, pots & pans, etc. The best part, the deck! Full of seating/tables, privacy and space. The neighborhood was quiet and adorable. We were basically obsessed. My only complaint is I wish we could have stayed longer. The beds/pillows were comfortable, all the amenities you could need (we didn't even need to turn on the massive TV), THAT SHOWER THOUGH! We all loved it. We even fought over the murphy bed in the living room because waking up to that view is the best part. 

And Carter, what a host! We were all bummed we couldn't meet him, but he was more than accommodating. Checked in with us several days before our trip to confirm details and made sure we were aware of the cleaning & tax fee so there weren't any surprises. He even dropped off extra super soft bathrobes over the weekend so we could all have one! He had some great suggestions for us of places to eat and sites to see. Very enjoyable to interact with. We all hope to come back soon and this house is at the top of the list. Highly suggest staying here! Thank you, Carter, for the wonderful experience! "
1048798,20151078,2014-09-24,20490832,Dino,"The pictures don't do the house justice. The view was so wonderful! We loved the fresh flowers and everything in the house. Carter was also great! He was quick to reply, make suggestions, and made himself available for questions. He truly made the experience better. We wish we had more time during our trip to enjoy the house. We hope to come back on our next trip to Seattle! "
1048798,20250130,2014-09-26,21088158,Jayme,This was my first Air bnb experience. I could not have picked a better hist. Carter put me at ease from the beginning. Very friendly and personable. He never made me feel like I was bothering him and was always willing to to help and answer questions in a very timely manner.
1048798,20494266,2014-09-30,17922739,Julie,"This was a fantastic stay!  As some of the other users have pointed out, the pictures do not convey the beauty of the view.  Carter seemed to care about our entire experience from the moment we committed to our final day.  He was very professional in communicating the house rules (all standard, nothing out of the ordinary), making sure we knew where everything was, and touching base just before the end of our stay.  The house was very clean and had ample towels, soap, blankets, utensils, and any/all amenities I would want.  The master bath was very luxurious.  My husband was *very* impressed with the television and stereo set-up as well -- thank you for providing WiFi and a nice cable line-up.  The neighborhood where the house is located was quiet and upscale.  Truly, this house was one of the most memorable aspects of our stay in Seattle!  We would gladly come back or recommend to a friend."
1048798,20947135,2014-10-08,2859770,Michael,"This is the second time we've stayed in this home and it still delights!  The view is fabulous, the house enchanting, the neighborhood quiet and minutes/easy drives from things to do.  We were visiting family and the Murphy bed made it easy for them to stay over during part of our stay; enhancing the vacation feel.  Carter was very responsive and helpful to deal with.  This home will be our top choice for future visits."
1048798,21522705,2014-10-19,16524541,Leah,"Carter did a wonderful job making me feel special on my birthday vacation at his West Seattle home.  Flowers, sparking wine and cookies!  The neighborhood is quiet and the view looks exactly like the photos only better!  Everything is at hand and available at the house.  Carter is very responsive and a gracious host.  We were very pleased. "
1048798,21798908,2014-10-24,851427,Walter,"Wow! This home was perfect for our family of 4. This home has such great energy, and has been very well kept. 
From the wood floors to the magnificent Puget Sound views this home is a must stay if you are visiting Seattle. 

Very nice neighborhood and lots of great local shops, restaurants,  and coffee stops :-)

The home was very well equipped with everything you would need in a home to make it comfortable. There are also little laminated notes throughout the home to help navigate through until you are familiar with everything. 

We will stay again. Only longer next time. 

The Cornelius Family"
1048798,22405601,2014-11-05,409964,Maja,"This house was the best choice we could have made, no more staying at expensive hotels all crammed in one room- this is the perfect choice if you're traveling with kids. Our daughter loved the space, the colorful bathroom, the fireplace and we enjoyed the views, well equipped kitchen and all the amenities. The house was spotless. 
Great touch were fresh flowers waiting on the table, bathrobes and yummy cookies on our pillow. 

The neighborhood is very quiet and the view is just spectacular!
The house is only 15-20 minute drive from downtown so we easily went back to the house to put the little one down for a nap, then back to the city for some more exploring in the afternoons. 

Carter is a great host, he made sure we were well taken care of and responded promptly to any of our enquiries.

We will definitely stay here again.

1048798,22530018,2014-11-09,773287,Chelsea,"Carter's West Seattle home is more than perfect. It has every possible amenity and then some, including a giant jacuzzi tube & a beautiful deck overlooking Puget Sound. The view is amazing! It is also relatively central, especially if you have a vehicle. Carter was an amazing host and checked in a few times to make sure everything was set. I highly recommend staying here and going for a run in Lincoln Park!"
1048798,25149203,2015-01-07,13795254,Betsy,"We unfortunately didn't get to meet Carter in person, but he was still a very gracious host.  He kept in great touch through the message thread and via text and was always available if we had questions or concerns.  His home is absolutely lovely, was spotlessly clean and perfect for our needs.  A great jumping off point to explore the area.  We really enjoyed sitting in the living room and watching the ferries come and go across the sound.  My personal favorite touches were the amazing shower head (feels like you're in a tropical rainstorm!) and the heated floor in the bathroom.  We'd love to stay again sometime."
1048798,26014874,2015-02-01,26106176,Heather,Working with Carter was a pleasure!  He was timely in his responses even when on his own European vacation.  He made us feel welcome and we had no worries about being let in or any of the accomodations 
1048798,26734328,2015-02-18,6227262,Heike,"We had a wonderful stay in Carter's beautiful home. Even though we unfortunately didn't meet him in person, Carter was a very attentive and thoughtful host. The house had everything we could ask for and we were conveniently located to visit the family. Thanks for a wonderful vacation experience. We even had a week of sunshine in February in Seattle! There's nothing else to ask for!"
1048798,26806899,2015-02-19,6227262,Heike,We booked an additional night as our travel plans changed and Carter was really flexible and helpful. Great place!
1048798,27844341,2015-03-13,22266556,Justin,It was a very nice experience.  Photos of the house were accurate and the view was incredible.  Carter was very accommodating and provided me with a lengthy list of restaurants.
1048798,28173477,2015-03-19,23435199,Shanshan,"the house is beautiful and you can see the sea and breath the fresh air. The transportation is convenient to downtown.
Overall, the house is a good choice."
1048798,28441776,2015-03-23,12934633,Ryan,Carter's place was fantastic.  We were in town working over the weekend and it was nice to settle in at night and enjoy the view.  The view is simply amazing! Carter was in communication and made sure all our needs were met.  Everything you need for a comfortable stay is provided. I highly recommend staying in West Seattle at Carter's home.
1048798,28610168,2015-03-27,28233633,Sara,"WE FOUND A JEWELL!
My first experience with Airbnb was a huge success.  The host was amazing and gave us all the information and luxury we could have ever imagined.  
The house was private with the most breathing views and picture windows in every room.  
The master bedroom and bath was equal to a five star hotel, complete with robes and candles.
There was enough room for us and my two children to have space and relax and we cooked several meals and ate dinner at the table together. 
This rental was truly a blessing and allowed our spring break to be just that,  a break!
We got the Seattle City Pass and every day we spent here we did amazing new things. 
This place was worth every penny and more. It is a great savings as apposed to a hotel and I will tell all my friends about it. I hope to return and enjoy it again soon. 
THANK YOU CARTER! 
Sara"
1048798,28956611,2015-04-01,28919813,Lisahseattle,Carter was so welcoming and communicated frequently. He was up front with the expectations and provided information around the home to make the stay that much more pleasant. I like that he checked in the first and second day to see how everything was going and if I needed anything. I would see myself coming back here again and recommending his place to friends. The views were spectacular and the neighborhood quiet. Thanks so much Carter.
1048798,31276067,2015-05-03,968827,Maureen,"This is the best weekend getaway house EVER ! I live in Seattle but I wanted to take a relaxing ""vacation"" -- without the time and stress of travel - and I found it! Carter's home is utterly charming - it is on a tiny quiet dead-end lane with an amazing view. I would buy this home in a minute - it is truly a little gem - I haven't seen anything else like it in Seattle. The immediate neighborhood is quiet and because the house is nestled above an expanse of greenbelt it feels like it is out in the countryside. A few miles away are the shops and restaurants of West Seattle - a charming ""small town"" within a big city. Our host Carter was a sweetheart - he also lives in Seattle and he was quick to reach out to check in on us and answer any questions by text and email right away. He also considerately placed directions around the house to guide us. The next time I have guests I am going to rent Carter's house and have my guests stay at my place while I relive my ""weekend at Cinque Terre"" - it was just that special.
"
1048798,31442558,2015-05-05,3726348,Maria,"Unfortunately we could not go to Carter's house because we had a family urgency and had to fly back to Argentina before checking in.

Carter was very kind, efficient  and responsive during the whole booking process. Thank you Carter!"
1048798,31841128,2015-05-10,731776,Erika,"This place is why airbnb exists. Carter is a considerate, thoughtful and professional host who is an absolute pleasure to work with. He was communicative when we needed him and had anticipated everything we'd want during our stay. And this place, what a view! Let alone all the ways there are to enjoy them... The sprawling patio, the garden tub, the sitting room that was practically one big window to the sound. The pictures are lovely enough, but in person it's even better. We were very comfortable and quite simply there's no better way to enjoy what west Seattle has to offer. Thanks Carter, we will be back!"
1048798,32611976,2015-05-19,30128808,Tianyi,"What a wonderful house! The view from the house is actually better than it looks in the photos; the shower washes your tiredness away like a waterfall; the place was clean, spacious, and quite. You really couldn't ask for more. We didn't meet Carter in person since he was traveling, but he was very responsive to our texts and requests. This might be my best place on Airbnb so far and it definitely worthy the price. "
1048798,32850822,2015-05-22,10955111,Tony,"This place is truly why Airbnb is Airbnb. I traveled with two friends and stayed at Carter's place for 3 nights. The experience was way beyond my expectation. 

Firstly, the house is clean, modern-decorated, spacious, and bright. There is a book shelf with a full collection of The Wallpaper magazine. The shower head in the master bedroom provides cheerful shower experience because of the huge volume of water from the ceiling sprinkle and the high water pressure. The kitchen is fully equipped with everything we needed.

Secondly, the sea view is stunning! My friends and me prepared a candle-light-dinner in the spacious balcony and watched the whole process of sun-set. It was a breathing-taking view! That was one of the best moments in my entire 3-day trip in Seattle.  

Thirdly, the location is great and it's convenient to get around to Seattle downtown. I only drove around 20min to get to the Pike Market. There is a garage that I can park my rental car, but I just parked it outside the house and it was very safe during night. The neighbours are also very quite. I can barely hear any noise days and nights. 

Last but not least, Carter is an amazing host. He made us feel very welcomed and also gave us plenty time of privacy. I would love to stay in this place again when I travel with friends and I would recommend it to anyone with a leisure travel to Seattle.

这是我住过最好的Airbnb。房主Carter把这个屋子收拾得非常干净，屋子的装饰也很现代，采光特别好，床很舒服。主人房洗手间很大，大浴缸直接透过玻璃看得到海。洗手间的花洒有直接接着天花板的花洒头，而且从头顶直冲下来的水量超大，冲起来特别舒服，直接冲走一身疲惫。最重要的是，这个屋子有个超级大的阳台，可以看到整个日落海景。住在这里几天，每天景象真的就像是面朝大海，春暖花开。

厨房里的器具应有尽有，基本去一趟附近的Safeway买点食材就可以做一顿自己想吃的海景烛光晚餐，感觉超赞。停车可以直接停在屋子外面，或是车库里。邻居们都很安静，小区很安全。这真的是一个适合安安静静度假的屋子。在阳台泡上一壶茶坐一个下午，读一本书，和朋友们聊上个天南海北。房东完全不住在这，能保证百分百的个人空间。开车大概20分钟就能到市区，很方便。强力推荐！"
1048798,33660759,2015-05-31,29406461,Galina,"I stayed in Carter's house with my family for 10 days, and enjoyed every minute I spent in this wonderful place! 
The view is breathtaking, the house has everything you can and cannot think of to make your stay as pleasant as it can possibly be. I will never forget dinners on the deck with a glass of wine, soft music, and gorgeous sunsets over Puget sound.
Carter has done absolutely fantastic job as a host - very welcoming and thoughtful. We are very grateful to Carter for all his care and help. 
The house is located in a lovely and quiet neighborhood, and at the same time it is only 20 min drive away from the heart of Seattle. 
In my book - it is a perfect place for a family vacation. 
We hope  we can come here again.
Thank you Carter!"
1048798,34031326,2015-06-03,12499722,Kevin,"A great place to stay in a great neighborhood. The house had all the accommodations that we could ask for. And the host sent us Messages frequently to make sure we had everything we needed. And I highly recommend staying at this place if you want great views, A comfortable clean space, and a marvelous outdoor deck to enjoy the weather while sipping a glass of wine."
1048798,34487325,2015-06-08,212157,Ruben,Had a great time at Carter's place. He was very thoughtful and even worked to accommodate an earlier check-in time (though we eventually changed our plans). The location was exactly what we were looking for and the house had everything we needed.
1048798,34795283,2015-06-12,33452050,Carol,"This was truly an amazing place. No words to describe the house and the host, Carter. I've never experienced such prompt response and great communication from an owner/host. The pictures of the house are so accurate and all the furnishings and decor were awesome. Very comfy bed also! The views from the house are so totally amazin and breath taking. We enjoyed everything about the visit. Can't wait to come back. We have family in West Seattle and they were also impressed with everything about the home. Thanks again Carter. 
"
1048798,35287591,2015-06-17,27670504,Kathy,We had a wonderful stay in Carter's beautiful West Seattle home.  Carter was very helpful with all of his communications with us prior to and throughout our stay.  We only wish we could've stayed a little longer.  I would recommend his home to anyone wishing for a peaceful stay in a great neighborhood with an awesome view of the Puget Sound.   
1048798,35918397,2015-06-23,1249002,Susan,Carter was an incredible host!  The house was PERFECT!  My daughters and I have a glorious visit and would return again.  Great accommodations  and lovely view :). 
1048798,36155996,2015-06-25,851427,Walter,"This was our second stay at Caters home in West Seattle. His communication is top notch as is the home. Amazing views and close to so many great shops and restaurants,  and only a short drive into the city of Seattle. 

We'll be back again this fall!

Thanks Carter

The Cornelius Family"
1048798,38369053,2015-07-15,27602056,Carrie,We had a wonderful stay at Carter's house. He was very helpful leading up to and during our stay. The house has an incredible view. We all enjoyed ourselves very much.
1048798,39762153,2015-07-26,34073717,Corie,"Carter's home is wonderful! Everything was exactly described and the pictures fall short of capturing the charm of the house and the grandeur of the view. The immediate neighborhood was safe and welcoming, and the surrounding area was filled with shops, great restaurants, and an amazing park.

This was the perfect place for us to return to after our exploits in the city. The drive in to town is short-- even in rush hour traffic. And though it is close to downtown, when we came back to the house our kids felt like we were in the country and could relax and unwind.

We especially enjoyed having a well-appointed kitchen at our disposal. Traveling with children with dietary issues is challenging, but we had everything we needed to prepare meals. Better still, Seattle is very accommodating to restricted diets and Carter was excellent about providing information on local markets and restaurants that would meet our needs.

Carter's communication is awe inspiring. He thinks of, and plans for, everything you will need to make the stay enjoyable. We'll be back on our next trip to Seattle!
"
1048798,41201991,2015-08-05,31934586,Sandy,"This was our third trip to Seattle to visit our son and our first experience with Airbnb. We definitely hit the jackpot with finding Carter’s house. It is beautiful, comfortable, wonderfully decorated, private, and has a “million dollar view.” The view looks like a painting from every angle. The ferry moving silently in and out of the dock confirms that it’s not a painting but real…even well into the night when you watch the lights of the ferries criss-cross across the Sound in silence. We were lucky to have nice weather for our six days and enjoyed seeing the sunset every evening. It was uncharacteristically warm for Seattle and Carter’s house is one of the few that has air-conditioning. The house has everything you could want or need. The well-equipped kitchen is a delight to prepare meals in. The master bedroom and bathroom are exquisite. The rain shower is every bit as wonderful as is described. The two sitting rooms are gorgeous and a pleasure to relax in. My teen son enjoyed the view he had from the Murphy bed that was his for the trip. There is a great sound system and tons of CDs to choose from. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and the location was perfect for everything we did. My Seattle-based son enjoyed coming over with his girlfriend after work. We got to enjoy wonderful quality time preparing meals together and dining and laughing on the wonderful deck. Carter was a great host. He made sure we had everything we needed to enjoy the house. He was great to communicate with and always a quick text away. He even made sure to let us know that we could harvest figs from the tree in his backyard. That was a delicious treat and we were there right at the perfect time! This was definitely the best visit we had with our son and so much more enjoyable than staying in a hotel. Thank you, Carter, for hosting us in your beautiful home. And thank you, Airbnb, for letting us find Carter! We will be back!"
1048798,41367434,2015-08-07,11999257,Tom,Stayed at Carter's house for two nights.  Very nice place with great views of the Sound both inside and out on the large deck.  He provides all necessary items in kitchen and bath.  Lots of space for our family of four.  Even provided a twin bed for our daughter so she didn't have to share the Murphy bed with her brother.  Very convenient to Sea-Tac and downtown Seattle.  Love the master bath.  Thanks Carter.
1048798,42137021,2015-08-11,35673547,Jenny  (Qing),Carter is a great host.  Our family of four stayed here for four nights and Carter provided an extra single bed for our teenager son.  The place is great as shown in the pictures.  West Seattle is a lovely neighbourhood.  Going in and out of downtown Seattle is a breeze on weekends and during weekdays.  
1048798,43138463,2015-08-17,28969898,Ase,"Carter’s house is much larger than we had anticipated.  The beds are comfortable and the kitchen well equipped.  The house is nicely decorated and view is awesome.   Carter is very attentive host, responding to questions immediately.  We very much enjoyed our brief stay there."

1048798,44913469,2015-08-30,19396142,Jennifer,"This was the second time that I stayed in Carter's place and again, everything was excellent!  Views of the Puget Sound were breathtaking.  Watched the beautiful sunsets from back porch each night and it was absolutely stunning!  House is very cute and well kept.  Carter is a great host, giving clear instructions on how to work everything inside the home, and checks in regularly to ensure everything is running smoothly.  I love, love, love this place and look forward to staying here again in future visits!  Very close to the city and THE place to stay when you're visiting Seattle!  Thank you so much again, Carter for your hospitality!!"
1048798,45692640,2015-09-05,8533865,Jim,Dazzling view is right! The house was very comfortable and well furnished. It's on a dead end street in a very quiet neighborhood. It was quite convenient to groceries and restaurants. 
1048798,45927021,2015-09-07,1507209,Penelope,The house has an outstanding view and is in a secluded quiet neighborhood. It fit our family of three well. The house was clean when we got there and Carter was excellent at communicating. 
1048798,48979853,2015-09-30,23824011,Cameryn,"We spent 3 nights of our PCH Honeymoon Roadtrip at Carter's. You NEED to book his home for your next Seattle stay. Since the drive to downtown is quick (without traffic) and there are a few busses that run that way, the fact it's not downtown isn't a downfall, it's a major plus! Being on a quiet residential street was so peaceful and really set the tone for a wonderful, relaxing, yet fun filled trip! We took a ferry to Vashon and ate at the Hardware Store (a must!) and walked up and down Alki Beach and had the most romantic time! The view and the rain shower head alone are worth the stay at Carter's. The price is reasonable and a steal for the incredible privacy and view you're treated with! Carter is a great host, he checked in to make sure we were taken care of and has a well equipped kitchen which I loved. Definitely coming back."
1048798,49489926,2015-10-04,13350229,Kristen,We loved staying at Carter's place. Everything was as described. The view was worth the trip! Thanks so much for the great time!

It was the most peaceful , tucked away oasis with amazing views, beautiful homey decor and a breathtaking shower. Carter went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and went above and beyond to accommodate our travel needs and offer us great dining recommendations. We have already recommended this home to many of our friends and family. Thanks so much again Carter for such a wonderful stay. "
1048798,51186610,2015-10-18,45274715,Angela,Carter sent an email upon arrival welcoming us to Seattle. He even arranged for us to check in early that day since our flight came in at 9:25 a.m.  Carter checked with us during our stay to make sure things were going ok and if there was anything we needed.
1048798,52322570,2015-10-28,43300641,Leslie,"We loved our stay at Carter's home.  It is beautiful and comfortable, and has an amazing view.  It's in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, and close to some nice restaurants and the Vashon Island ferry.

Located on a quiet No Outlet street, the home blends the charm only older homes can have, with perfect updating of critical portions that results in the perfect Meritage of homes.
Carter, while not on site, is an attentive host, but never intruding on your privacy.  A strong plus:  The property was as described.
Top all the amenities, such as a well equipped kitchen, great master bath, views of the Sound that include watching the ferries come and go, skies changing moods as the day progresses, and the result is a comfortable retreat for romantics of all ages.  
Do not hesitate to book this gem.

We didn't meet the host but communication was permanent, with quick responses.

Besides being an urban, modern showpiece, the home was clean, comfortable and spacious. It was everything that was promised. The bed was superb, the shower was hot. We slept soundly in this quiet neighborhood. 
The location was within easy walking distance to good food and coffee. There is great fun to be had in Ballard.
Parking was always easy."

The rooms, kitchen, and bathroom are exactly look like the pictures listed.  Xiu is very hospitable and helpful.  She also made an extra mile to ensure my stay is good.  I definitely would recommend this place for one person room or for a family stay."
7853358,47313661,2015-09-17,17669556,Janelle,"The house was easy to find and the off street parking was an added bonus.  The house was clean, we'll-equipped, and our stay was quite comfortable. My family and I were really pleased with everything!"

I would definitely stay there again on business while in Seattle.  Good location with off street (and street) parking made it easy to get around."
7853358,49805490,2015-10-06,2845597,Eric,Xiu's house was very cozy and located at a great and safe location. Driving to downtown Seattle took about 15 mins. The outside of the house looks older but the interior had some remodeling and is very clean. The pictures of the interior are just as described. It was great to have street parking and driveway parking. Checkin and checkout was simple. The house was supplied with essential amenities. I would stay here again and would recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to a hotel. 
7853358,52644137,2015-10-31,9922461,Erin,"Very clean,super comfy (website hidden) looks exactly like the pictures Xiu provide.QFC is nearby.There is also a parking space.WiFi is fast and stable.

Great public transport and grocery store nearby, but also a nice neighborhood feel. Xiu was in touch and available in case we needed anything. "
7853358,56068257,2015-12-08,33577416,Jenna,"My brother and 3 companions were visiting from California so we decided to book them a house nearby to our neighborhood. They commented that the house was comfy (especially the beds) and clean. The access to the light rail and Beacon Hill restaurants was also a big plus. 

Xiu was helpful and communicative during their stay and we appreciated being able to have family stay so close. "

1920477,13327246,2014-05-25,14591407,Yang,"Arch is such a nice host! She always keeps an open attitude towards 
different culture and people, and is super friendly. Her place is clean, 
comfortable and very homey. She usually takes adventure in new cookings on 
Friday nights, and we are glad to be her Guinea Pig. We enjoyed her 
company in our stay and we hope she does too ;) Our stay at Arch's place 
has become one of our best memories in Seattle. I highly recommended you to 
take a try at Arch's place!"
1920477,15284597,2014-07-06,1646320,Tim,"Arch was a wonderful host. Her condo is located near several bus lines which made travel in Seattle, without a car, easy. The room and private bath were very clean and comfortable. Arch went out of her way to make the stay a pleasant experience. Good coffee was available for us to make for ourselves anytime we wanted (good for an early riser like me!). I will stay there again the next time I visit (email hidden)anks Arch! "
1920477,16212585,2014-07-23,16788193,Hildie & Hector,"Comfy and cozy sums it up... Archie's place is perfect in every way, very clean and well appointed. Whether the temperature was 90 or 50 degrees outside (we experienced both, plus everything in between),  it was very comfortable inside.  It's right next to a major artery but nice and quiet since it's set back from the street. We enjoyed using the pretty kitchen and the convenient washer/dryer.  Archie had thought of everything and made us feel very welcome.  Archie was very helpful when we needed it. Her exotic cooking is out of this world! We'll certainly be staying here again next time we are in Seattle."
1920477,16518942,2014-07-28,18519306,Lisa,"This was my first experience with AirBnB and it could not have been better. Everything was absolutely clean and well prepared. The bathroom was well equipped and the bed very comfortable. I spend 2 nights there with my friend and we never felled annoyed by any sounds overnight. The host is such a courteous, helpful and nice person, what made the whole atmosphere very enjoyable. The location is a good compromise between quite neighborhood and fast connection to downtown. You can make it with bus in 40min to Seattle downtown without transfers."
1920477,16859838,2014-08-03,14323697,Marcus,Awsome stay. Archana is a great host and had some good talks. A little far outside city center but bus connection is good.
1920477,17582835,2014-08-14,18517174,Mint,"I got a warmly welcome when I came there. She's so nice and friendly. About the place, it's good as described, make me feel comfortable as home. I strongly recommend this for everybody who need a nice place with a nice host in Seattle."
1920477,17876730,2014-08-18,11767669,Calum,"Arch was an amazing host! So kind and friendly and good to talk to, she went out of her way to make us feel at home. Her place was very clean and tidy, the room was comfortable and quiet... would stay here again for sure."
1920477,20583542,2014-10-01,11297971,Marnie,"My stay with Archana felt more like staying with family than with a stranger I had never met!  I had arrived in Seattle for work, only to find that my plans to stay temporarily at an extended stay were not going to work.  I immediately got on Airbnb and heard back from Archana right away that, yes, her cozy townhome was available.  I found the place to be just perfect for my needs, and Archana was a most charming host.  Having a mutual love of travel, we immediately connected and enjoyed many long chats about our various adventures.  She provided me with LOTS of advice on things to do and see,  as well as where were the best places to eat and grocery shop.  I had my own car, but the public transportation from her location is very easily accessible.  You walk one building over and the bus stop is right there to catch the bus into downtown (email hidden) couldn't be easier.  The bedroom and private bath were in immaculate shape and very clean and cozy.  She is a very generous, fun-loving and outgoing person.  I would not hesitate to recommend her place to stay to anyone coming to the Seattle area!"
1920477,21800105,2014-10-24,12623713,Simeon,"Archana was an awesome host with a conveniently located and cozy home in northern Seattle. The space is a private room, and Archana has made a lot of amenities available upon request, such as a laundry and kitchen. 

Plus, she's super fun to talk to!"
1920477,32719519,2015-05-20,33054585,Dustin,"It was a pleasure staying in Archana's home! She was very informative about where to find things in Seattle, even gave me a ride to the grocery store (super helpful)! We chatted a bunch the first night almost like old friends, and mostly left me alone the rest of the time. Anytime I needed something I was able to ask her directly, or text (if she was away), and I immediately received responses.

The room was clean, everything was as advertised, and I will definitely be returning again."
1920477,34092223,2015-06-04,34142608,Jigmet,"It was our first experience with Airbnb and it has won us over. The place is nice but the host Arch was even nicer! In fact we felt at home and became friends with the host. Not only did the place meet our expectations but it clearly exceeded it. Very clean comfortable bed, bathroom and rest of the house. Arch was very quick and responsive with emails and questions we had while booking and made the whole process very smooth. She warmly greeted us and showed the lovely room which overlooks a garden with privacy and quietness.  We had an excellent stay here for a week. Very easy access to public transportation and good location. It is definitely our place to stay whenever we visit Seattle. The experience has left us with a positive feeling that one can find another home away from home and make friends along the way. 

Thanks Arch!
Kunzang & Jigmet"
1920477,34372157,2015-06-07,15411768,Gavin,Was made welcome and given peace and quiet.  Home was set off the main road but right next to fast bus to central Seattle despite being out of town. Not many attractions nearby however 
1920477,35104337,2015-06-15,31279065,Connie,We had a great stay with Archana.  She was so helpful about our reservations and seeing that all was taken care of.  She saw that all of our needs were met and that we were happy with our room.
1920477,35225896,2015-06-16,31279065,Connie,Archana was a great host.  She met us at the door on our arrival and saw that we had everything we needed.  The home was truly comfy and cozy and very quiet.  It was located very centrally to what our needs were for the weekend.  Just wish we had more time to get to know our host better.  Maybe next time!  :)
1920477,35980170,2015-06-23,10489153,Jinzhu,"Arch gave us a warm welcome and she was really informative and helpful(she always replied my text messages within 15 min). We were so relaxed staying with Arch. The townhouse is neat and cozy, we could find everything that we need. Another amazing Airbnb experience!"
1920477,37522546,2015-07-07,36965960,Danielle,"Arch was a wonderful hostess. She was a gem to talk to, her house is quaint and clean (the private bathroom was nice, as well) and friendly and helpful. Though a little bit of a distance from downtown, I was able to navigate to downtown with ease because the bus stop is almost right outside her door. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend her home to anyone looking to visit Seattle and she certainly enhanced my visit."
1920477,38193350,2015-07-13,36986159,Camille,"Although only a 4 day stay, Arch made our first experience with Air BnB a delight. Her home is beyond clean and holds all types of useful amenities. The environment is very welcoming and comfortable. We used the kitchen, living room, and Arch was very accommodating. She even shared with us some of her delicious cooking on the last night. Additionally, Arch is a wonderful person who loves to share her experiences and get to know her guests. The accessibility to the bus system from her house is literally right in front of her house and will take you all the way to downtown. Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better stay. Definitely staying with her when I'm back in Seattle. "
1920477,38574135,2015-07-16,38481542,Kate,"This was my first experience with AirBNB and I couldn't be happier.  The room was so clean and comfortable, I would recommend to my closest friend!"
1920477,38753265,2015-07-18,36877323,Todd,"This was a fantastic stay, albeit brief. Parking was a little tricky, the road is busier than you would expect, but the accommodations themselves were superb. Archana was helpful and responsive, and made sure we were well taken care of. 

Checkin and checkout were as easy as it gets. Also, after we wandered town a while and returned, Archana invited us down for a glass of wine and we all talked late into the night. A wonderful hostess and lovely person all around. 

The room was comfortable, private, quiet, and clean. I highly recommend this place."
1920477,39346749,2015-07-22,28079966,Sophie,It was amazing house! We felt comfortable. She is best. Thank you so much❤️
1920477,39813255,2015-07-26,37257572,Janet,"This was a lovely home and we were welcomed warmly by Archana who was the best host!  She helped us find our way around and told us about the best breakfast restaurant, The Fat Hen, and several close parks to walk to.  Easy coming and going, comfortable room and private bath.  Our first experience with airbnb and we would do it again...and would definitely go back to Comfy and Cozy!"
1920477,40405900,2015-07-30,4484003,Andersen,Archana was a delightful host! 
1920477,41114082,2015-08-04,931718,Robert,Archaea was a perfect host although our time together was short as we spent most of the time out biking and touring.  The location was excellent for us with good access to parks and roads.  That being said the house is located on a busy 4 lane road although is surprisingly quiet being a back unit.  The only parking and access to unload luggage is from the road or side streets.  It was very hot and so we purchased a fan for our room and we also brought our own pillows to allow us to get a better sleep.  The bed and on suite were good and everything else worked out well.
1920477,43638827,2015-08-21,36999891,Gessica,"Arch make my parents feel super confortable and welcome. She is super polite and kind, her house is super clean and organized."
3732094,17653993,2014-08-15,15734667,Soochang,"It was very inspiring and creative atmosphere. All the guests are briliant innovators and very friendly. It also has beautiful view toward union lake, so very relaxing. I had really great time."
3732094,18144100,2014-08-22,2753965,Emily,"Had a fantastic time at this house, people were super friendly, and social, very clean, and lots of space. Beautiful view of Lake Union, and within easy walking distance to buses to get anywhere. Aaron was a great host! Would definitely recommend for anyone needing temp accommodation :) "
3732094,20990764,2014-10-09,594820,Brett,"It's a beautiful home, with beautiful people, in a beautiful location. 

Plus, Aaron, the house captain, was really great."
3732094,42659229,2015-08-15,30217728,Henry,"Pros: location, people, collaborative environment

Cons (Note: all of these things were in line to be fixed but I didn't see them fixed before I left so I felt it deceitful to leave them out of a review) : laundry machine is semi-functional, stoves have some broken burners. Kitchens are missing decent knives and some cookware.

Considerations: this is a collaborative space so do not expect quiet. If you cannot sleep with some noise this is not the place for you."
3732094,48885466,2015-09-29,35887329,Harrison,"Loved the residents, house captain, as well as the proprietor. Great environment of mutual respect and friendship. "
7802149,51377903,2015-10-19,17616725,Lauren,"Just as advertised.  Great neighborhood, safe and quiet street.  Incredibly clean, new studio with an equipped kitchen.  Thanks!"
178844,55056375,2015-11-27,23219915,Allan,"Lisa was a fantastic host and made every effort to make sure I got to the place safely. Her bubbly personality shows through her texting and she has great response time. A+ service 

The home was a downstairs mother in law like advertised and the photos do a great job of showing the place off. It had a very cabin in the city feel with lots of Christmas lights to add to the charm. "
178844,56133143,2015-12-09,1684119,Emily,Very cozy and comfortable. Lisa is very sweet and accommodating. 
4069543,19353648,2014-09-10,3954802,Omar,Karla and Sean were able to set this room last minute and it was perfect! We had a bit more privacy on this room which was good. Great experience staying at their house.
4069543,19506332,2014-09-13,3263848,Rufus,"Sean and Karla create a great experience. Great people , great place"
4069543,20576348,2014-10-01,20915134,Daila,"Sean, thank you for being accommodating and responsive with our out-of town guest needs. He really enjoyed staying with you guys:)  "
4069543,20672904,2014-10-03,20915134,Daila,"Once again, Sean - thank you for being accommodating and responsive with our out-of town guest needs. Really enjoyed staying with you guys:)  "
4069543,28344124,2015-03-22,12582599,John,"We have had very pleasant stays with Sean and Carla and is the reason we returned again, this time to their newly remodeled basement apartment. It is very spacious and ideal for a family with children. There is a new, very comfortable queen bed for the parents and trundle beds for kids (which we didn't use since we're grand parents visiting our kids and grand kids in West Seattle). There is a full private bathroom with shower. A private entrance makes it very easy to come and go and not disturb anyone. Their home is conveniently located across from Lincoln Park and is just minutes away by car from commercial services and about 15-20 minutes to downtown Seattle. A very satisfying experience."
4069543,28911636,2015-03-31,29888258,Abdul,"The Lawson Family greeted my son and myself with great warmth and welcome.  The room was amazing, it included private bath with shower, private entrance, fridge, and TV.  It felt like a hotel, minus the $20 snicker bar.  The home is literally across the street from Lincoln Park and down the street from some amazing food.  Sean and Karla were gracious enough to let me use their fridge space and kind enough to let me utilize the stove to cook for my son.  It truly felt like a home away from home.  These are the kindest people in Seattle.  Cannot wait to come back.  Thank you again. "
4069543,29326857,2015-04-06,29645966,Lisa,"This was our first stay with Sean and Karla and our first airbnb experience.  Karla greeted us when we arrived she gave us a quick tour and made of feel every welcome. We stayed in the basement room with our own entrance and bathroom, they provided all the amenities of a hotel. The bed although only a double was so comfortable, we can not wait for our next stay!"
4069543,29863790,2015-04-13,533970,Judy,"Sean and Karla were gracious and accommodating; we enjoyed coffee and conversation with them in the morning. We felt right at home. The neighborhood was pretty, right across from Lincoln Park. We will want to stay here again. And the beds were so comfy. Thanks!"
4069543,30651168,2015-04-25,16160568,Christoph,Thank you for having us! everything concerning our stay was easy and well prepared. it was a pleasure to be your guests! 
4069543,30741364,2015-04-26,3511573,Alissa,"Our family (myself, husband, infant daughter, and dog) were in town briefly visiting family, and very much enjoyed our stay.  We didn't have a chance to meet Sean in person, but he was very responsive, helpful, and inviting.  The accommodations were quiet, spotless, modern, and comfortable.  It's a great neighborhood and location.  We very much enjoyed our stay, would highly recommend staying here!  "
4069543,31088582,2015-05-01,32224753,Ling,Sean was very accommodating and a wonderful host especially since we booked the night before arriving.  It was great having the separate entrance and our own bathroom for privacy.  Lincoln Park was a lovely walk; make sure to visit the two resident geese which everyone feeds daily.  We were in and out and enjoyed the morning chat and fresh coffee with Sean and his family.  We ended up having breakfast at Endolyne Joe's 5 minutes  away like Sean suggested.  It was a great deal with the $6.50 menu selection and great food.  Wished we had room for the maple and bourbon milkshake.  We would stay again especially with our son next time since the room has a day bed.
4069543,31644466,2015-05-08,30057922,Katie,"Great Airbnb experience! First time my family has used and would highly recommend this location. Space and amenities exactly as presented. We used mainly just for sleeping at night and was a great space for a family. Had a small little corner behind private bathroom that was prerfect for our daughter's pack-in-play for sleeping while allowing us to still utilize the main space without disturbing her. Day bed available for older children as well. Private entrance to come and go. Very welcoming with use of upstairs available as needed. Great neighborhood - right across from Lincoln Park, water access, bus and ferry access."
4069543,31998869,2015-05-12,10753221,Jeff,"Everything went exactly as planned!  Sean met me at the home, showed me around and we chatted for a few minutes.  The listing is exactly as shown and the location is amazing!  West Seattle is a great spot and the home/suite is in a great spot, within walking distance of several restaurants and - most importantly - Lincoln Park & easy access to transit (great for getting downtown) and all major routes.

The bed is super comfortable and, although basic, the suite was exactly what I was looking for: a home base while touring around Seattle!

I will keep Sean's place in mind for my next trip back to Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay again!"
4069543,32305248,2015-05-16,32793606,Matthew,Sean was incredibly welcoming and helpful. His home is beautiful and comfortable. We could not have asked for more in our short stay in Seattle. 
4069543,32370489,2015-05-17,30026417,Denton,"Fantastic, accommodating host, and a fantastic room. Immaculately clean, comfortable and quiet. It was all we could ask for!"
4069543,33675435,2015-05-31,30878286,Chelle,We are a family with two young kids and this was a great place to stay for a week. Sean and family were great hosts and our son enjoyed playing with theirs. Immaculately clean and comfortable. West Seattle and the location directly across from Lincoln park is great! We'd definitely stay again!
4069543,34549164,2015-06-09,7154873,Jennifer,All though we arrived later then planned which we felt bad for we absolutely LOVED Sean's place. Sean greeted me when i arrived and had everything set up and let me know where everything was. Bed's were very comfortable and the bathroom was beautiful. We had a baby with us and the pack and play was just perfect. Very kid friendly place. We also loved the park near by and that this was close to the ferry dock so we could head over to Vashon island. We would definitely stay again and loved everything about this place. Thank you! 
4069543,34705522,2015-06-11,14476839,Guy,"Sean and his wife were awesome hosts.  We really enjoyed our stay.  The room was spotless, very very clean.  We spent two nights with our kids and the location was perfect.  Beautiful Lincoln Park is literally across the street.  There is a great playground, trails and a path along the water. We definitely enjoyed the park.  Our kids played with theirs and they had a blast.  If we find ourselves in Seattle again, we would definitely stay with the Lawson family again.  They made us feel at home and very comfortable for our entire stay.  They have a beautiful home and we appreciate their willingness to allow us in.   5+ STARS!  Terrific hosts!"
4069543,34947310,2015-06-14,29972521,Jean Paul,"Très bon accueil. Nos hôtes nous ont laissé libres de faire ce que nous voulions, tenant à notre indépendance pour que nous nous sentions à l'aise. Nous nous sentions comme chez nous.
Excellente loterie, chambre très propre. Tout était très bien.
En outre, le quartier de Fauntleroy est très beau.
Adresse à recommander sans réserve à Seattle."
4069543,35397883,2015-06-18,33855497,Elizabeth,"My husband, son and myself loved our stay. Karla was really nice. We loved having our privacy. "
4069543,35496681,2015-06-19,34790740,Brian,"We had an amazing experience staying with Sean and Karla. They gave us a lot of space, which we very much valued, but also made themselves available if we needed them. The room was very spacious and comfortably accommodated our party of four. It also has its own door/entryway, which adds to the privacy.

Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle, especially since their home is close enough to easily get to downtown but far enough to find some peace and quiet after a long day of activities. "
4069543,35562420,2015-06-20,5283053,Chris,"Had a great stay here, and would highly recommend it. Was just in town for the night with my dad and brother and we all were very comfortable staying in the suite. Karla and Sean were great with communication and very helpful when we had a change to our original arrival time. 

The location is also excellent as it's easy to get to and from downtown or the highway, yet is also in a very quiet spot on a cul-de-sac near the park, which made a for a peaceful night's sleep. We enjoyed exploring the nearby dining and shops on California Ave.

All in all, a wonderful place to stay."
4069543,35641446,2015-06-21,29352914,Kaneeks,"Sean and his family were very warm and welcoming and great hosts. We stayed one day at their place and felt right at home. His wife showed us around, told us about the neighborhood and provided some extra things for my toddler. 
Overall great experience and if I go to Seattle again I will definitely keep them in mind."
4069543,35783493,2015-06-22,2915659,Jennifer,"We will definitely stay here again:) Sean has thought of everything, right down to a box fan in the room. He was very kind and let us modify the reservation from 2 nights to 1 when plans changed. We didn't get to meet his wife but we much enjoyed a coffee and a chat with him before leaving for Whidbey Island. We highly recommend staying here. Everything about the space was comfortable, clean and convenient. Thank you again, Sean!"
4069543,35977606,2015-06-23,6986930,Sally,"Sean and Karla were lovely, very warm and accomodating. Although we had such a brief stay, we felt very much at home. The space is large, very comfortable and clean and across from a beautiful park. Highly recommended!!"
4069543,36209704,2015-06-26,34872708,Jinwoo,"The house was really nice, clean, and spacious than I expected. I have been impressed by the host's warm welcoming and kind explanation about what I asked.I strongly recommend this place where you can enjoy everything at a reasonable cost. Sean!!! If I come to Seattle later, let me stay your house again. Thank you very much."
4069543,36275062,2015-06-27,30604129,Patrick,Clean and comfortable.  We had a nice walk in the park directly across the street before settling in to a restful bed.  
4069543,36469999,2015-06-28,30814185,Lisa,"Very comfortable, clean, spacious living quarters with ample space and nicely decorated. Also an extremely comfortable bed!  Sean and his wife were easy to deal with and very helpful with directions, etc. "
4069543,36864094,2015-07-02,26677225,Carsten,"Sean and his family were wonderful hosts! So friendly and helpful! They offered a breakfast with milk and yoghurt and we could use their full kitchen as well as fridge space. A little fridge is in the spacious guestroom. Their house is located in a quiet, private neighborhood with close access to public transportation and across the street from Lincoln Park. A lot of restaurants and supermarkets are nearby (with a car). Driving into downtown during the day costs you about 20 minutes, in the evening without traffic only 10. We loved Seattle and like to come back and stay again with Sean! "
4069543,37063005,2015-07-04,10870069,Andy,"Awesome, spacious room in a great location. We had a great time in Seattle and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. "
4069543,37963039,2015-07-12,30439131,Jennifer,Our stay was lovely!  We enjoyed the very comfortable accommodations as well as the location. This is a perfect family suite--it was very ideal for our visit!
4069543,38301166,2015-07-14,2724818,Olivier,"Sean's place is absolutely fantastic, and makes for a perfect AirBnB experience. The space is well arranged and decorate with a lot of taste, everything about it feels comfortable and welcoming. Communication is very easy and efficient. Our son was thrilled to be able to play with Sean's, and in general we were touched by the generosity extended to us by Sean and his family. The location is superb, very convenient to get to downtown Seattle either on the bus (direct line) or by car, and the neighborhood itself is well worth exploring. "
4069543,38504641,2015-07-16,34557142,Liu,"It was such a pleasure stay at Sean's home. It was nice clean neat and spacious. My parents and kids had a nice sleep. They pay lots of attention to details such as good quality of shampoo shower gel etc. They even had some toys for the kids!
Nice family and highly recommend!
Tks a lot!

Location vraiment conforme aux descriptions.
Sean et sa femme étaient très accueillants et nous ont bien conseillés et aidés pour nos visites."
4069543,40224701,2015-07-29,35461449,Eileen,This was our first time staying at an Airbnb and we couldn't have been more pleased.  Our hosts made us feel very welcomed.  The accommodations were lovely and also within walking distance to a great park.  Will definitely return if ever in the area again.  Thanks!    
4069543,41074319,2015-08-04,33056906,Rachel,"Sran and his family provided a great first airbnb experience in their lovely home. The space was perfect for our needs, with incredibly comfy beds in a quiet neighborhood, right by the ferry to Vashon Island. "
4069543,41233709,2015-08-05,20736200,Jose,"I arrived to Sean's place an hour early, Sean and Karla welcomed us without any hesitation. The place was cleaned and immaculate like the pictures. We had great stay even though it was a short stay. The place is quite, aafe and close to just every thing with a nice park close by."
4069543,41333083,2015-08-07,14022404,Alison,"We had a great stay at Sean's in West Seattle. This listing is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood; but close to Sea-Tac, Fauntleroy Ferry and fun West Seattle restaurants, etc. The room was great; the posted pics are very accurate.  It is spacious, clean with a separate entrance. The room has a separate bathroom, small fridge, sofa and TV. The family's beautiful kitchen and living room is also available for guest use. Sean is a very welcoming and gracious host. I recommend this listing without reservation."
4069543,41582404,2015-08-08,677297,Alexander,Great place to stay. Sean and his family were very nice and welcoming. The place was clean and tidy with all the creature comforts that you would expect at your own home. It definitely felt like I was at home. Would definitely stay here again. Who would want to stay in a hotel when you have a place like this to go to? 
4069543,41932112,2015-08-10,31867433,Julie Kaye,The neighborhood is amazing.  It is just across from Lincoln Park and we enjoyed the park so much we went there twice.  It's not far from a bus stop called the C line which takes you all the way to down town Seattle if needed. The host was very welcoming.  
4069543,42256848,2015-08-12,14022404,Alison," This was my second time at Sean's. It was another great visit. Sean is a very  gracious host; helpful when needed but giving  guess adequate privacy, as well. I highly recommend this listing ."

4069543,42552599,2015-08-14,37678477,Jing,"Our family and I had a wonderful stay in West Seattle thanks to Sean's hospitality. The room was in pristine condition upon our arrival, and we had our own private entrance to eliminate disturbances. Sean kindly provided milk, cereal, and yogurt for breakfast which was very convenient in the morning before heading out on the town. Furthermore, he went above and beyond in accommodating our family by allowing us to leave a couple of pieces of luggage in his home while we took a 5 day trip to Vancouver. We highly recommend Sean's West Seattle airbnb to others!"
4069543,42850200,2015-08-16,34660787,Angela,"Sean and his family were amazing hosts! We loved our stay in Seattle. The room was clean, large, and convenient to downtown Seattle. We would definitely stay with Sean again! Thank you!"
4069543,43273765,2015-08-18,39065059,Anissa,"Upon arrival at Sean's place, he gave us a very detailed tour of spaces that we had access to (of which there were many!). He made sure to show us where the coffee and breakfast was, and he was polite and friendly. The room was spacious and very clean, as was the washroom. We had a private entrance, which was fantastic, and we were given a lot of privacy. The location of Sean's place is right by a beautiful park that has trails down to the water - amazing walking area! Fantastic stay."
4069543,43399137,2015-08-19,29896623,Xindong,they are alway kind and welcome.  Beautiful Garden and delicious breakfast! Best location of you want to be close to the airport.  
4069543,43498602,2015-08-20,2261395,Melissa,"Beautiful, lovely and safe home! We were only here a few hours due to flight delays and next day plans but overall, the house and host bring a warm welcome! "
4069543,43790097,2015-08-22,37678477,Jing,Sean is a gracious host. He explained things in much clarity and my family enjoyed our stay at his clean and comfortable two listings for several nights.  We appreciated his efforts and accommodations to our unusual request and his recommendations on West Seattle. Highly recommend Sean and his listings!
4069543,44152394,2015-08-24,2028335,Lauren,Sean's place was great. They have a beautiful house. Looks even nicer in person. It's clean and comfortable and was perfect for our short stay. There were 3 of us. We met both Sean and his wife as well as a couple of the other airbnb guests who were staying upstairs. It's really nice that Sean and his family welcome guests to their living room and kitchen areas makes you feel really at home. I would definitely recommend their place. 
4069543,44544855,2015-08-27,1870803,Jill And Mark,"Loved our stay here! Beautiful home, lovely and comfortable room, super friendly and hospitable hosts, great West Seattle area! Would definitely stay here again! :)"
4069543,44676496,2015-08-28,36286488,Josh,"This was exactly what we were looking for in Seattle:  a great bed in a quiet community near the water.  The accommodations were spotless, comfortable, and near a spectacular waterfront park.  Our host made us feel right at home, allowing the use of his kitchen."
4069543,45252533,2015-09-01,31729927,Richard,"My wife, granddaughter and I had a wonderful experience with Sean as our host. His beautiful home was like staying at a really nice hotel. The location was perfect for connecting to the local transit. We were able to get to all of Seattle best sites.

Thanks,

4069543,45625870,2015-09-04,77991,Jeremy,"I had made a sort of unconventional booking. I made the booking for my wife and our young kids. They needed a place to stay in Seattle on their way up the coast from Oregon where they had been camping. I had to head home early and had taken a train back home to Vancouver.
So Sean had three people showing up who he had never met and who he had not had any direct contact with.  
My wife had the address and check in info, but didn't have a reliable cell phone (due to the lousy US roaming plan on her Canadian cell phone and due to her having been without power for a few days, so the cell had minimal charge).  
Despite these limitations, everything worked great!
Sean had provided all the info needed for my wife to find the place and get checked in easily.
The room was perfect for their needs.
Sean and family were very welcoming, even though they had guests visiting.  
My wife and kids had a great time in Seattle and appreciated Sean's hospitality."
4069543,46934111,2015-09-14,41782771,Julie,"Perfect landing spot for my Father-in-law, and Sean was quite hospitable! I admit that I live in West Seattle - so I might be a tad biased. Our neighborhood is pretty awesome - but TRUST ME future guests, this location is primo. Gorgeous house, in view of Lincoln Park... Next time, our family will stay at our house, and hubby and I will go stay here.  Seriously. "
4069543,47160907,2015-09-16,26163625,Becky,Karla greeted my friends and I at the door and quickly gave us a tour of the place. We didnt use the upstairs part of the house. Our basement apartment was fit to description with 3 very comfortable beds and clean bathroom. Easy access to the highway and city centre. Will definitely be back when in Seattle. 
4069543,47338932,2015-09-17,35516315,Scot,Very good at communicating. Clean and well maintained room. Appreciated the fast response.
4069543,47687715,2015-09-21,40075463,Shea,"This was a fantastic place for us to stay when we were recently in town for a wedding in West Seattle! Lots of space, separate entrance so we didn't to bother anyone when we went in and out, and perfect if you have kids. Sean and Karla had a pack and play with a very comfy mattress set up for our 7 month old, and it seemed to be well insulated enough from the rest of the house that they couldn't hear her when she was fussy overnight (or they were just very nice about it :) ) Our favorite part was the proximity to Lincoln Park- beautiful spot, went on a walk there every day and absolutely loved it. Thanks Sean and Karla for a very comfortable stay and we would definitely recommend their place to anyone."
4069543,47759761,2015-09-21,19457,Ron,"Sean lives in a great neighborhood with a park half a block away. We walked in the park and in a few minutes were watching the Vashon ferry cross Puget sound. Sean was there to great us when we arrived. We had more correspondence that usual because of needing to get in early to dress for a wedding. Sean made it all happen. The room is great, better and bigger than described."
4069543,48139243,2015-09-23,44294038,Marc-André,"Sean et sa famille ont été des hôtes exceptionnels. Sean a répondu à toutes nos questions et il a pris le temps de nous accueillir à notre arrivée. Nous étions deux collègues pour un voyage d'affaires, mais cet endroit est aussi parfait pour un séjour en famille. Les lits sont très confortables et l'espace est suffisant. J'ajouterais que le logement est très propre. Le matin, nous montions à la cuisine pour le petit déjeuner et chaque fois nous étions bien accueillis. Le quartier est agréable et sécuritaire. Le parc tout près est magnifique. L'accès au bus est à quelques pas de la maison et permet de se rendre au centre-ville directement. Je recommande fortement ce logement."
4069543,48185864,2015-09-24,40654229,Tina,Easy access. Clean room and bathroom. Was as described. Thank you! 
4069543,49824702,2015-10-06,44440793,Lewis,"A great stay. Sean and his family made us feel right at home. 1st timers and they  got us off to a great start.  Gotta try Endolyne Joe's just down the road from the ferry!
Comfy bed and great privacy.  Easy access to downtown with the C Line bus."
4069543,50451506,2015-10-12,21777066,Yunhao,Karla made us feel welcoming the second she met us in the house. Sean was also an amazing host. I couldn't ask for anything more for the place. Everything you need and everything i expect is there. I would definitely recommend this to anyone traveling to Seattle.
4069543,51303836,2015-10-19,35643869,Cathy,Really enjoyed staying at Sean and Karla's home. The room was private and had a separate entrance so we could come and go without disturbing their family.  They made us feel very welcome and supplied a basic breakfast which we did not expect. The queen bed was VERY comfortable and the neighborhood was a short block to Lincoln Park where we enjoyed a walk on the beach. The bus stop is right around the corner to zip into downtown Seattle.
4069543,53965456,2015-11-15,43831384,Kelly,"Lovely home and neighborhood for our last day in Seattle! The room was very comfy and spacious; plenty of space for my boyfriend and I. Just as described, the room was clean, private and had a separate entrance. We would definitely stay here again and recommend this to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
4069543,54361118,2015-11-18,24975618,Tariq,Very Comfy 
8423118,49739985,2015-10-05,10167964,Adrienne,"Great location, easy to walk to Pikes Market and the Space Needle. Great apartment. Bed was amazing! TV was huge! Very prompt in answering questions. She kept in touch and assured we got into apt ok. Keycafe was actually very easy to use for pick up and drop off. Would stay here again!"
8423118,49756711,2015-10-06,22460289,Teresa,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8423118,54272821,2015-11-17,43694525,Ina,"Keelan & Jessica were amazing hosts! Keelan (my POC) was very friendly and quick at answering all of my questions from the beginning of my booking inquiry to the end of my visit. He checked in with me the day before as well as the day of to make sure everything was all set for our trip. KeyCafe was super easy to use!

The apartment was perfect! It was very clean, quiet, safe, well maintained, and had everything we needed for our stay. The location was prime, an easy walk to the Space Needle/Chihuly Garden & Glass, very close to amazing restaurants, cafes, bars, & convenient stores, and a nice 20 min. walk to Pike Place Market & downtown (or a $7 Uber ride). My mom & I felt very safe to walk around the neighborhood at night.

We really enjoyed Keelan & Jessica's home and wouldn't think twice to book the place again.

Thank you!! :)"
8423118,55443907,2015-12-01,15490780,Rachel,"Our stay at KJ's place was absolutely wonderful! Great apartment in an awesome neighborhood. We walked pretty much everywhere (beautiful walk around the water down to Pike Market). The location couldn't be more ideal and the apartment was lovely! Very clean and felt homey. Thanks for a great stay!! 

PS - I had never used KeyCafe before but it was very easy to pick-up and drop-off the keys. Would recommend it! "
4210585,31602495,2015-05-07,19235033,Billy,"The condo was very easy to access and get in and out of. The condo itself was very nice and spacious and well-equipped with kitchen utensils. Great outdoor balconies, as well as a communal terrace that is shared with the rest of the building. I would definitely visit again. Thanks for a great stay!"
4210585,33841990,2015-06-01,32388817,Tim,Was visiting Seattle for the first time with a group of friends. The whole check-in process was straightforward and simple and the unit was great. Jordan was very responsive and suggested this unit when our original booking fell through. Highly recommend.
4210585,35291253,2015-06-17,12652126,Paul,My host did a great job. He presented his rental accurately and was very helpful .  I would recommend this listing.  It is located downtown Seattle blocks away from Pike's Market and the Harbor District.
4210585,37502187,2015-07-07,35432122,Jean,The Stay Alfred team was very helpful and communicative. The condo was exactly as advertised and a comfortable hub for our stay in Seattle.
4210585,43362560,2015-08-19,11079874,Nancy,"Jordan was completely responsive and the clear communication made dealing with the complexity of accessing a high rise apartment building with secure parking a breeze.  And getting free parking in downtown Seattle is a great perk!  The location was ideal for walking to almost everywhere we wanted to go.  An extra delight was Le Caviste, a French wine tasting room and shop right next door.  I have one caveat about staying here, but it will only apply to small number of people.  We are that rare breed that likes to shop for and cook local food.  That's why we wanted to be close to Pike's Place.  Given the very limited amount of cooking equipment we needed to curtail some of our plans, though if you can't be flexible, you can't really cook!  I would add that the supplies are more than adequate for 99% of travelers, and that the StayAllfred staff was as responsive as they could be for our request for extra stuff. Theoretically we loved the idea of having a gym and pool on site but must admit we were having too much fun to ever get there.  Another great advantage to this apartment is that the weather really is changing in the Northwest and most homes in Seattle don't have air conditioning.  While I love the uniqueness of airbnb private homes it was a relief to be in an air conditioned unit in 90+ weather."
4210585,51162590,2015-10-18,6741772,Michele,"The condo was perfect.  We walked to the market easily, found places to eat near by, Starbucks was around the corner for morning coffee --  and found the location to be ideal.  The staff and residents at the building were helpful and kind.  Was a great experience. Would definitely rent here again!!  "
277416,781425,2011-12-12,410749,Jon,"This was a fantastic, professionally managed condo in an ideal location in Seattle, between the Space Needle (check out the EMP) and the downtown area.  There is a good selection of restaurants nearby.

The condo itself is lovely, really well-appointed and clean.  We picked it because it had wifi, cable TV and a washing machine.

I think Lori manages a few condos in the same building, so just check which one you are getting.  I'm sure they are all just as nice.

Highly recommended.  Thanks Lori!"
277416,1232893,2012-05-06,1615461,Shawn,"We had such a great experience. The unit was beautiful, tastefully decorated, clean, and the perfect size. It was located in a wonderful location, just a few blocks from Pike Place Market and close to many great shops, restaurants, bars, and public transportation. We could not be happier with our stay, and highly recommend this unit. Thanks Lori! "
277416,2042379,2012-08-20,3021863,Ron,"Great experience. We came in late and we were met by Autumn who directed us to the parking showed us the apartment. The apartment is clean, nice towels and bed and the kitchen has the essential tools for coffee and snacks. We didn't cook . Coffee for one day and a bag of cookies was provided which was a nice touch. The location is great with Pikes Pl and everything around it walkable. Starbucks and a great bakery are less than a 1/2 block away."
277416,2119165,2012-08-27,3335800,Justin,Great location and fantastic apartment. Very friendly service was a pleasure to stay.

277416,3480758,2013-02-05,4105879,Steve,"My wife and I stayed here while house hunting in downtown Seattle.  Excellent location and close to all the Belltown and Downtown amenities. Nice furnishings.  The parking space for this unit has a high clearance, so we were able to park our Volkswagen van inside without problems.  Good communication with Nick and his team. We would definitely stay here again."
277416,4111706,2013-04-10,5673040,James,"Great condo!  Excellent location. Clean, well equipped, quiet,really nice. We'll definitely plan to stay here next time we're in Seattle. Check in and out was a breeze!  Thank you!"
277416,4250737,2013-04-22,5555737,Felix,"Very professional and clean. Easy to meet and setup. They had to do some maintenance work one morning during our stay but it was really no hassle since we were on our way out the door and gave us plenty of prior notice. 

Way better than staying in a nice hotel, especially with parking included. Would definitely stay here again! "
277416,5084610,2013-06-11,1720155,John,"Check in went smoothly and quickly.  The manager was very prompt.  The parking space is incredibly convenient for the space and is close to the elevator.  

The room itself was small but had everything necessary.  The location of the apartment is nicely located and a 10 minute walk to both the Space Needle and the Market, with plenty of Cabs handy for further jaunts.  "
277416,9405062,2013-12-27,83598,Kim,"Our stay was great and we were very happy with the condo.  We walked everywhere and enjoyed the proximity to great restaurants, the waterfront, Seattle center, Pike's Market, etc.
Autumn was great and super quick with communication.  The building was secure and we felt safe.
The king bed was incredibly comfortable and that is saying a lot for us! 
We were a little disappointed that the pool was closed for renovations since that was one of the main reasons we chose to stay here, our 7 yr. old daughter loves to swim! :(
Overall it was a great stay and we will definitely be back!
Thank you Autumn! :)
"
277416,9747959,2014-01-07,5708612,Peter,"Dealing with Autumn was very easy. She was helpful, on time and very nice.
The place itself was very well kept and as advertised. Would recommend this location or stay at again myself."
277416,10026149,2014-01-26,10675687,Garrett,"The Property Located in Belltown couldn't be more conveniently located to everything in the city at a walk-able distance. Autumn was able to address any questions and concerns we had and even offered up some awesome ideas for restaurants and things to see in the area.

If you're looking for an ideal location to have fun and see it all. This is it. Thanks Autumn!"
277416,11581704,2014-04-08,9653082,Leroy,"I loved living in this space! It was a very comfortable and enjoyable experience, "
277416,12635412,2014-05-06,14006827,Amber,"A friend and I chose the awesome condo in Belltown that Autumn manages and we had an amazing time. From the location to how easy it was to communicate with Autumn, we had a blast. Autumn is unbelievably accommodating and we will definitely be back to see her again soon!!! "
277416,12748315,2014-05-10,7637339,J.J.,"This was a great unit that was exactly as described in the listing. Very nice place to spend the week while I was in Seattle.

Autumn was a great host and made checking-in at the beginning of the stay convenient and easy."
277416,13342157,2014-05-26,11463730,Katie,The place was perfect! Everything we needed. Beautiful decorations. The bed was amazing to sleep in - super comfortable! Autumn was flexible on meeting time and was really helpful. I would definitely stay here again! 
277416,16525233,2014-07-28,942075,Robbie,"This was the perfect place for us for a tourist weekend in Seattle! It's downtown but not right in the middle of everything, which was nice because Seafair is going on, and the Torchlight parade happened when we were there, which caused a lot of traffic. There's a great Italian restaurant right outside the front door which we enjoyed. We took a lot of Uber rides but also did walk around quite a bit.

As to the unit itself, it was pretty much perfect! Just enough room for two. We only had three minor issues, but nothing to really take a star off for: 

* The pump for the air mattress pull out was missing, however sleeping on the deflated mattress with just a box spring under it was still pretty comfortable. 
* It got quite hot because there was no AC in unit (but plenty of fans and a large standalone AC unit in the bedroom). However, Lori had told us to close the curtains in the morning before leaving which we forgot to do.
* The pictures here on Airbnb are not the actual unit, but it didn't affect us that much, however it is smaller than what is pictured. 

As to the hosts, we dealt with Autumn's friend Lori, who was super accommodating to my arrival time (I got in earlier than planned and she was there to meet me still!) and that I forgot my Chromecast in the unit. 

Overall, a great, professional experience. I would highly recommend renting from Autumn and her team anytime, but as of right now the calendars are all booked solid for months, so book while you can! (We only got in because someone canceled at the last second for the weekend)"
277416,17139806,2014-08-08,4819753,Myriam,"Such a nice apartment. Very clean, super comfortable bed, close to everything, etc. We had a very nice time in Seattle and a wonderful time at the apartment. We had coffee every morning at Macrina Bakery *yummy*.  Very recommended!"
277416,18306639,2014-08-25,16128135,Ann,"Autumn was a fabulous host. She was extremely attentive and helpful with neighborhood suggestions. 
The location was great. We would stay again without a doubt. "
277416,19129955,2014-09-07,18101749,Brandon,Great place to stay in a nice location. 
277416,19939936,2014-09-21,19538101,Kevin,"Host met me and showed me where to park and was very friendly.  The place was perfect, clean and exactly as expected and in a great location.  Bed was very comfortable too."
277416,20328218,2014-09-28,14203505,Jenifer,Wonderful experience and host.  Perfect location!  Thank you Autumn for everything
277416,20714506,2014-10-04,9390634,Ted,"First time in Seattle and had no idea where to stay in the city.  Came across this listing and seemed close to most of the ""spots"" people told me about so put in a request.  Autumn immediately got back to me and was amazing to deal with through the entire trip.  

We met at the condo and Autumn was super personal and informative.  Condo was perfect for my girlfriend and I and is walking distance to everything! It was very clean and comfortable.  

Feel confident in your stay here...will definitely be back when in Seattle again "
277416,22505018,2014-11-08,21689920,Mary,"We had a wonderful stay at Autumn's apartment. It looked just like the photos. The building was easy to find, clean and secure. Autumn greated us on time and was available for questions through out our stay. The apartment was well equiped including a coffee maker, washer and dryer, blow dryer, cable, and everything we needed to cook and eat a meal. It's within walking distance to shopping, the Space Needle, Pikes Place Market and great restaurants. There's a convenience store on the first floor of the building. The free parking was a big plus.  We will definitely stay here again."
277416,23508555,2014-12-02,15358894,Barbara,"Autumn was the perfect host.  We arrived to  a chilled bottle of wine and a gorgeous condo.  The location was  excellent.  Next to  downtown Seattle in a great neighborhood with many coffee shops, good restaurants,  bakery, drugstore and market all within a few blocks.  Lovely view of enclosed gardens.  Sitting in the indoor  spa watching the snow falling was such a treat for us Southern California  folks.  Making  Thanksgiving dinner was easy having all the cooking equipment etc. needed  in the fully stocked kitchen.  We had a great week with family and will definitely be renting this condo when we return.   "
277416,24034028,2014-12-17,24352161,Fraser,"Very comfortable apartment, central location, secure building. Autumn was an excellent host who responded quickly and made our stay easy."
277416,27161959,2015-02-27,16430655,Meredith,"Autumn's condo was in the best location. So easily accessible to everything by foot or short cab ride. The building was clean and safe and the unit itself was gorgeous, just as the pictures showed! We would definitely stay here again. Autumn also met us pretty late in the evening and was still cheerful and willing to offer many suggestions. She's a great hostess! "
277416,27769721,2015-03-11,27843503,Cindy,The place was exactly as pictured. Very nice and welcoming. Perfect location. Lots of restaurants and shopping within walking distance. Only complaint is that they have a very strict cancellation policy. Our flight was cancelled because of bad weather and we missed two days due to this. We were not given any refund and actually had to pay full price for an additional day that we added. 
277416,28336632,2015-03-22,9173134,Michelle,"Autumn was so helpful and sweet upon arrival!  She was punctual and made us feel welcomed right away.  She went above and beyond by giving us suggestions of places to go and eat/drink.  There was a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived, which was an added bonus!  The accomodations were perfect.  There were 4 of us, so two in the master bedroom and 2 on the couch.  Both beds were comfortable.  The place was very clean and had everything you needed (extra towels, shampoo/conditioner, hair dryer, dishes, wifi, cable, ironing board, etc).  The location was great! So close to Pikes Market, restaurants and bars in Belltown, and a short Uber ride to surrounding areas (Capitol Hill, Fremont, etc.).  Overall, a great experience- thanks Autumn!"
277416,29782220,2015-04-12,7227372,Jeri,"Autumn did a wonderful job communicating about our upcoming reservation and handled the check-in process with ease. The condo was very clean and well-stocked, especially for longer stays. We had the added surprise of welcome gifts in the kitchen when we arrived! The location is superb, the bed is comfortable, and the experience was five stars!"
277416,30260211,2015-04-19,18696371,Mary Beth,"We had such a great trip! Autumn was very helpful and accomodating, great at communicating. The apartment was charming, and the building is great- beautiful courtyard and pool, STUNNING views of the sound from the outside patio. The king bed in the master bedroom was amazing, and the sofa bed easily and comfortably slept 2 adults. Great location, access to great bars and restaurants, walkable to downtown as well. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."
277416,32527234,2015-05-19,4294006,Stephanie,"The apartment was lovely and comfortable. There were four of us staying (2 couples), and there was plenty of space for us all. It was very well equipped and there was even a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived.
The location is great, walking distance from all the main points of Seattle. Autumn was very nice, she met us outside the building to show us to the apartment and the parking space and offered lots of useful information. She was very welcoming! Would recommend everyone to stay here :-)"
277416,41406550,2015-08-07,30370861,Leslie,"Super clean place. Walking distance to most places and with the lack of parking around pike's place, the parking space here was a blessing. We would definitely stay here again!"
277416,44686269,2015-08-28,34506674,Elizabeth,"Great Location! Clean, nicely decorated, everything you need, comfortable for up to 4 people. Autumn was great and easy to work with. Only negative was the cooling unit didn't quite do the job, it was a bit warm and stuffy. "
277416,45976664,2015-09-07,4223004,Lisa,"Autumn was amazing!!  She met us in the alley,  showed us parking and escorted us to our room.  Easy check in and out.  Location so convenient to everything we wanted to do.  Never had to move the car.  Parking space really a plus!  Washer/dryer on room also a plus.  Will use Autumn for any future Seattle travel."
277416,56837538,2015-12-19,3276596,Ivana,"Autumn is such a wonderful host - she is communicative, responsive and friendly. She gave us a thorough walk through of the apartment when we checked in and welcomed us with a bottle of wine; which was a really lovely gesture. 

Autumn's apartment is exactly as depicted in the photos, clean, warm and inviting. The location of the apartment is excellent, we could walk to all the major sites (Space Needle, Pike's Place, Pioneer Square), and we are surrounded by so many great restaurants and bars. 

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for our Seattle trip! "
277416,57760682,2015-12-29,35443621,Christy,"Everything was just perfect. Great location, walking distance to lots of great restaurants and attractions. The apartment is very clean and tidy. There are many lovely little touch that make us feel extra welcome. Great communication before arriving  and during  our stay. We definitely recommend this place for anyone who wishes to visit Seattle. "
4318031,21635461,2014-10-20,21767013,Brandon,"Jeffery was a very gracious host, so nice & with a lot of experience (3 different airBNB's). The apartment was located VERY close, walking distance, to the park with the space needle, Olympic Sculpture Garden Park & Pike's Market. One of the best aspects, the bed!! It was so comfortable. I would stay there again, without a doubt! "
4318031,21850306,2014-10-25,10417270,Jessica & Joe,"Jeffery's place is comfortable, clean, and centrally located. It was perfect for our needs. Jeffery went out of his way to accommodate us; when I inquired about a hairdryer, he went and purchased one prior to our arrival! The place is a great value as well and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone."
4318031,22267842,2014-11-02,12922874,Emily,"Jeffrey was an excellent host! He was very accommodating and took the time to provide customized breakfast options during our stay. He made sure that we arrived okay and that the place was up to par with our expectations. The apartment was clean and well stocked with anything we might've needed, including a plethora of travel guides and maps. If you're ever in the Seattle area and need a quaint place to stay I'd definitely recommend Aunt Sally's! Thank you Jeffery!"
4318031,22546959,2014-11-09,11242806,Britney,"My stay at Aunt Sally's was great. All the communication I had with Jeffery was wonderful, and very timely. Everything worked out just as expected. The apartment it super cute and it's in a great location. Go to the tiki bar near the apartment for some awesome karaoke. I would definitely stay again."
4318031,23121456,2014-11-23,23507203,Eboni,"My girlfriend and I really enjoyed our stay at Aunt Sally's Studio and Breakfast in Seattle. Jeffery was very accommodating regarding check-in and check-out times. The studio was exactly as was described-cute, clean, quiet and in a great neighborhood. Jeffery went above and beyond by stocking the refrigerator with all the breakfast items we could want and even left us some chocolate! He also left a basket of toiletries in the bathroom, which was very convenient. He even provided a travel first aide kit. The cutest part was the array or maps and brochures that was laid out for us on a shelf in the kitchen. A very nice touch!

The only thing I would mention is the the apartment is a 4th floor walk-up. It was fine for us (though not ideal) but I think it should be advertised just in case anyone has any mobility issues.

We would love to stay at the studio in the future. We will definitely try to book it again when we visit Seattle in the spring/summer.

"
4318031,23634737,2014-12-07,13607811,Susan,"Though we did not meet Jeffery, he was very accessible by phone and text and made us feel welcome.  He gave us excellent directions for getting to his flat, and made our initial entry easy.  His description is quite accurate of the flat itself, but he might want to mention the feeling of safety of the building and the stairs required to access his flat (4 flights.)  The streets nearby are very busy, so we could hear traffic all night, including frequent sirens.  The location is perfect for those visiting the Seattle Center (we were), which is an easy walk, or the waterfront.  Great public transportation nearby."
4318031,23952289,2014-12-15,260214,Christalyn,"Jeffery went out of his way to leave breakfast items and snacks. He also left tons of bathroom products for us! 

Location is perfect! And the photos don't show how cute the place is!"
4318031,24533078,2014-12-30,23334827,Kyle,"Great little apartment!  Location was amazing, apartment had everything we needed, Jeffery did an unbelievable job of stocking it with everything we ask for for breakfast and much more.  Clean space, comfortable and large bed, lots of towels and extra toiletries for anything we forgot.  Jefferey was also very helpful with the neighbourhood and its attractions and was never hard to reach, always responded within minutes.  Would definitely stay there again!"
4318031,24666667,2015-01-01,8222843,Jenna,"Aunt Sally's Studio & Breakfast provided a wonderful Seattle experience! It is perfectly located near Seattle Center, and the monorail makes it simple to get downtown. New Years at the Space Needle was fantastic! Jeffery was a very communicative and hospitable host. I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle.  "
4318031,25764828,2015-01-25,11404386,Manchi,"Jeffery was completely accommodating to our schedule. I wanted to arrive late and leave late, and since his schedule allowed him to do so, I could stay an extra few hours which helped a lot that I didn't have to wake up early and pack.

Breakfast was the BEST part. Nothing like being able to skip the breakfast budget and just cook eggs and pancakes in the morning. Bed and breakfast? Take it literally with a cherry on top - the fridge was stocked with more than what we asked for.

Beware: this is a 4 story climb. It wasn't bad for us since Jeffery told us to pack light. But it was a downside to the unit.

The bed was super comfortable. No complaints from the boyfriend with a sensitive back either. Shoutout to Jeffery for also stocking the bathroom with essentials. Maybe I should thank Aunt Sally :-)

Btw, this location is prime. PRIME. Everything we wanted to do pretty much revolved around this place, and there is a bunch of restaurants and bars easily accessible by foot.

If you're visiting for a weekend I suggest not driving because it costs money to park everywhere on Saturday, albeit it is free parking on Sundays. "
4318031,26917989,2015-02-22,15188241,Kristin,"We got to meet Jeffery on our way in. All communication was super quick and he checked in mid-stay to make sure everything was going well. The listing is very accurate to the photos. Everything was super clean which is the most important thing for me! Kitchen was, as everybody raved, above and beyond, well-stocked. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again or recommend to others. We didn't explore the area much as we were there for a special event, but it seems quite central.

Tip: For those who are driving in on the weekends, there's a really small $5 lot right around the corner on 1st ave. Otherwise, parking nearby on a Saturday will cost you."
4318031,27926004,2015-03-15,2596179,Muriel,"From the moment I booked this airbnb, Jeffery was an amazing host. He e-mailed me about my choices for breakfast items (including brands!) so he could have them ready for me at arrival. The fridge was fully stocked with those items and more when I arrived plus all kinds of extras like hot chocolate and chips in the fully stocked pantry. The bathroom was fully stocked as well with plenty of towels and toiletries. I never met him in person, but checking in and out was painless. I traveled with a friend, but the space is great for a couple too. The bed is mega comfy! The place was clean and in the perfect location. The area is close to all the buses and it's only a 15 min walk to Pike Place Market and other attractions. You can see the Space Needle from outside the bldg! The neighbors are quiet too. Just remember to pack light as it is a 4-story walk up. I didn't mind, but it might not be for everyone. Will definitely come back here. I loved the B&B atmosphere. "
4318031,28136457,2015-03-18,6226788,David,"After an initial difficulty getting inside the lobby door, things were great.  (From what I understood from someone else in the lobby is that others had had some difficulty themselves).  Upon arriving in the room, I could see I would be happy and comfortable.
The items Jeffery left for breakfast was so much more than I had even ventured to request.  You will NOT go hungry at this B&B.

The location was great coming from the Victoria Clipper and in the shadow of the Seattle Needle.  Directly on a bus line also.

If you happen to forget something, Jeffery has you covered.  I accidently slit my thumb (those knives are good and sharp) and found a small first aid kit in the bathroom.  This meant I didn't have to go down 3 flights of stairs and look for an open store late at night.  Jeffery does mention those stairs upfront in his description.  I had a large piece of luggage due to the length of stay in Canada.  Once I got it up to the apartment, no problem.

Jeffery is a great host, checked in with me to assure all was well and always available with a quick call or text."
4318031,28752555,2015-03-29,29696446,Joe,"Jeffery is awesome!  He has the place set up and ready to go for you, and  its super clean.  He even gets things for you to make for breakfast which is awesome, he just asks you what you like, then its there upon check-in.
Apartment is small and cozy, and the building is super quiet.  Bathroom has a super deep tub for a nice long soak, and the whole place gets a lot of sunlight from all the windows.  
The location couldn't really get much better.  First off, it's a 5min walk to the Space Needle, and about 10-15min walk to Pike Place, with Pioneer Square being accessible by foot as well, with all the awesome things to do in between(Jimi Hendrix Museum, Underground Tours, etc.).  Secondly, the neighborhood of Belltown is awesome.  A ton of awesome little places to eat amazing food at with killer cocktails, and it's super quiet and safe, i.e. no creeps wandering around.
All in all, I definitely recommend this spot, and recommend Aunt Sally's.  I'll stay here again next time I come to Seattle.  "
4318031,29300127,2015-04-06,27550744,Anne,Jeffrey was an attentive host and made sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was in a great neighborhood and the location was perfect for a weekend trip to Seattle!
4318031,30209910,2015-04-19,6188356,Brittany,"Jeff went above and beyond! The place was spotless and it was a huge time and $ saver to have the kitchen well stocked :) there was a blow dryer, iron, extra toiletries, tons of clean towels, and the location was perfect! We were so pleased and I would recommend Aunt Sally's to anyone! "
4318031,30428290,2015-04-21,31289326,Christina,"Jeffery was very prompt to respond to our booking request, and was friendly and professional.  The price is reasonable, the breakfast groceries were great and exactly what we requested.  The housekeeper forgot a couple little items (toilet paper), but Jeffery was quick to respond when we let him know.  Our only complaint is that his listing says that there is free parking on premise, but the unit actually has no parking at all and street parking is only short term.  This was one of the reason we booked this place.  We found an overnight parkade close by, but it would have been nice to know in advance.  There is no elevator so not an ideal place if you have any mobility issues.  The location is super convenient and very walkable.  Overall, everything was great.  "
4318031,30671877,2015-04-26,14614370,Emily,Jeffery was a wonderful host. He went out of his way to make us feel welcome by purchasing our favorite breakfast items and making sure we arrived okay. The room was clean and in a great location! We would definitely stay here again. Thanks Jeffery!
4318031,31315576,2015-05-04,19512685,Amber,"This was my first time using airbnb and I hope all my future stays can be just as good as this one!  Jeffery was a great host, answering questions about the area and its surrounding attractions and making sure that everything was taken care of in regards to the apt.  The location is great if you're ok walking, as it's just a few blocks from the Space Needle, the Pacific Science Center, and the Chihuly Glass Museum.  It's also just under a mile to Pike Place Market and the Argosy Tours, which is great if you're looking to get in a bit of exercise during your visit (you can also call a cab or take the bus easily!).  I was also really appreciative that my breakfast was included in my stay.  I was surprised that most airbnb locations in Seattle don't include this.  This is definitely a plus to staying here!

This was a great place to stay during my first visit to Seattle and I would gladly stay here again and recommend it to others.

One thing to note: you're definitely in downtown Seattle which means in the evening you can hear the buzz of cars and people talking outside, even though you're on the 4th floor.  At first it took some getting use to the noise so if you're sensitive to noise when you sleep, make sure to plan accordingly!     "
4318031,31756169,2015-05-09,32804657,Brandon,"Fantastic host, and a really great location. Walking distance to Seattle Center and close to downtown.

Would definitely stay again."
4318031,32876841,2015-05-23,17878064,Sara,My husband and I found the studio apartment to be perfect. It was a great base camp and was within walking distance to all the places included on the Seattle city pass. Jeffery did a great job providing the breakfast items we asked for. We definitely recommend this apartment for your next stay in Seattle!
4318031,33752749,2015-05-31,9499798,Mehgie,"This was by far the best airbnb experience I have ever had. Jeffery is accommodating, incredibly responsive, and thorough! The studio is a great little unit that was clean and comfortable...everything you could possibly need while traveling. Jeffery not only provides breakfast but goes the extra mile and gets exactly what you request! This cut down on travel costs and makes you feel like you're at home. Location was perfect...in walking distance of all the Seattle attractions and it provided a nice base camp when I needed a break from sightseeing. I would recommend this airbnb to everyone and anyone, you won't regret staying here! "
4318031,34338187,2015-06-07,31681920,Sherri,"My daughter and I were pleasantly surprised at how wonderful this place was and easy access to so many things, especially if you don't mind walking.  

Jeffery had everything available that we could have asked for and was very communicative prior and during our trip to Seattle.  MOST definitely a place to visit again in the future.  Thank you so much for the accommodations!  A very adorable place to stay indeed!"
4318031,34934947,2015-06-14,27751278,Travis,"This was my girlfriend and I's first experience with airbnb and thanks to Jeffery we will definitely use this site again in the future and his studio whenever we return to Seattle! Jeffery was extremely accommodating, he ensured we had all the breakfast items we specifically wanted including calling Dempsters to try see if he could purchase our bread somewhere in the US, as we are from Canada. Everything that you need in downtown Seattle was within walking distance and there were plenty of places to eat very close by. The apartment felt like home, was very cute and cozy with everything we needed and more. Jeffery also kept in contact with us to ensure everything was going smoothly and as planned. Very pleased with our visit, Jeffery's accommodations and hospitality really made our stay in Seattle special, we would recommend this studio to anyone!"
4318031,35641698,2015-06-21,18064507,Fran & Bud,Jeffery was incredibly accommodating and very responsive to any questions I had before our stay.  When we arrived the refrigerator was stocked with breakfast items based on our requests.  This turned out to be a huge benefit since we were able to save money on breakfasts.  The bed was extremely comfortable and the location was within walking distance from many attractions.  It is a walk up to the 4th floor but we knew what we were getting into when we booked this so dealt with that easily.   I would highly recommend Aunt Sally's.  
4318031,36265239,2015-06-27,12212778,Donald,"My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Aunt Sally's Studio.  The location was ideal for exploring the city; very close and walkable to restaurants, shops, Seattle Center, downtown, Pike Place Market, etc.   You can easily do without a car with the studio as home base.  As for the studio itself, it was just what we needed.  The building and unit were both clean and safe.  The fridge was stocked with breakfast items for our visit.  Other necessities were available, as well (toiletries, towels, etc.).  Thank you, Jeffery for being readily available and such a great host!"
4318031,36859604,2015-07-02,11804292,Kim And Tim,"The location of Jeffrey's studio is exceptional.  We walked everywhere.   The studio is a mile from pike place market and there are lots of great restaurants in the area.  It's a 4th floor walk up in the center of the city.  If you're a light sleeper, bring ear plugs. The kitchen was stocked with great breakfast foods.  Wireless internet, TV with Netflix etc., comfortable bed.  Jeffery called when we arrived to make sure we had everything we needed. We would definitely stay here again.  "
4318031,38050621,2015-07-12,2502435,Sarah,Great stay. Attention to cleanliness and hospitality was great. No complaints at all. Thanks!
4318031,38812514,2015-07-19,3115680,Matthew,Jeffery was an incredible host. He was very informative and promptly answered all of my questions. His place was nice and in a great location. The only con was no AC. I think we were there on abnormally hot days (around 90 degrees both days) so the apt was pretty warm but he did leave us 2 large oscillating fans.  Other than that it was a great stay and I would return!
4318031,39265292,2015-07-22,29054905,Clara,"Jeffery's studio is great. The location is steps from Seattle Center yet quiet.  Everything was spotless and well appointed. The breakfast items plus additional snacks were plentiful and appreciated. The bed and bath linens are plush. Jeffery's attention to detail is apparent throughout the apartment.

Jeffery is a fabulous host. Excellent communication before, during and after our stay. He has the perfect balance of professional and friendly. 

I would definitely recommend to a friend and hope to return soon."
4318031,39737985,2015-07-26,30237040,Meghan,"Wow, what an amazing first experience with Air B&B! Jeffery was so attentive and helpful. He could be reached in a moments notice if necessary. He created a worry free experience in a great neighbourhood of Seattle. A delicious breakfast, all the tour information needed or a great vacation, and comfortable bed/living space were provided. Jeffery is definitely a man about details, and we really appreciated that. I will be back very soon! Thank you Jeffery!"
4318031,40544300,2015-07-31,39849181,Christopher,"This was our first time using Airbnb and Jeffery has set the bar quite high.  On the day we booked with him, he placed a courtesy call to us and it made us feel very welcomed and comfortable before we ever stepped foot in the Seattle studio.  You can tell he really enjoys providing this service.  The place was clean,  easily accessible, and is right in the heart of town.  To top it off, Jeffery asked what we wanted for breakfast and made a shopping trip before we arrived to ensure the place had our favorite breakfast foods.  5 stars easy.  Thanks, Jeffery for making our trip to Seattle so great."
4318031,40888911,2015-08-03,27846890,Dave,"Jeffery was an attentive and accommodating host. From the moment of booking to the moment of our check out, Jeffery went out of his way to make sure we felt welcome during our four day stay. The breakfast provisions were a very personal touch and were most appreciated. 
The apartment is in a great location and Is well equipped with everything you might need on a short vacation. 
I fell in love with Seattle and that was certainly helped by Jeffery's hospitality and personalised hosting."
4318031,41565924,2015-08-07,3788233,Theresa,"Jeffrey was a great host -- we was very prompt and communicative and made sure that we had everything we needed. We only stayed in the studio for one night, but it was perfect for what we needed. The bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was very well-stocked (Jeffrey had made sure to ask us what we like for breakfast!), and it felt like a great getaway in a great location. Much better than a hotel!"
4318031,42346762,2015-08-12,36739563,Patrick,"Jeffery is a great and very communicative host.  Through email , text, and phone calls, he asked us about breakfast preferences (which became quite meticulous down to bagel type and cream cheese flavors!), gave us a detailed explanation of what to expect since there was some construction going on next to/inside the building (which was not a problem at all!), and checked up on us in general.  All for a one-night stay!

The studio was exactly as he describes in the listing, very cozy and inviting.  The kitchen was very well-equipped and stocked to the brim!  A variety of granola/protein bars, coffee, french press, pots/pans, eggs, OJ, and enough water bottles to fill a kid-size pool!

My cousin and I were only in Seattle for less than a day and a half; not nearly enough time to cover even 1/4 of what Seattle has to offer.  Will definitely be back and Aunt Sally's studio will be the first I'll be looking up."
4318031,42976799,2015-08-16,16099935,Raymond,"This was my first experience with Air B&B.  Jeffery's attention to detail, outstanding customer service, and prompt effective communications made  my first impression of Air B&B a memorable positive experience that I look forward to repeating.  The provisions Jeffery stocked for my stay far exceeded my expectations."
4318031,43397244,2015-08-19,13130922,Brian,"Jeffrey's place was great! Located close to the action, but not in too busy of an area, many attractions were within walking distance and street parking was never an issue. The Pike Place Market is only a 20 minute walk and there is a good place for running down by the bay near the sculpture park. Jeffery was extremely hospitable and made contact numerous times to make sure everything was squared away with our trip. I would definitely stay here again. "
4318031,46034556,2015-09-07,42297052,Troy,"My girlfriend and I could not have had a better experience with our first AirBnB! Jeffery was incredibly welcoming and made sure we felt right at home. So much, that this experience may ruin future ones for us because of the amazing hospitality, and of course, stocking the fridge with breakfast goodies that kept us well fed and energized throughout the day! :)

As for location, I'm not sure it could have been much better. We grabbed a City Pass for the weekend and everything we did was within a few blocks of the apartment. The location was PERFECT for exploring Seattle's top tourism spots, as well as, experience the Belltown Neighborhood which had some AMAZING restaurants and bars. I would 110% recommend Aunt Sally's and I know we will be back again!"
4318031,46749473,2015-09-13,21753740,Shirley,"We had a wonderful time at aunt Sally's studio! It was perfect for the two of us. Sweet area, nice views, clean, comfortable and had a lot of nice amenities, including customized breakfast items, snacks, coffee, teas and helpful maps and information about Washington! Jeffery sent helpful information to settle in and enjoy our trip. He checked in with us throughout our trip and made sure we got into the place! We love it and highly recommend this place. It's in a great location too! What a great first AirBnb experience for us - thank you!!!"
4318031,47129890,2015-09-15,40016407,Paul,"We had a great stay at Aunt Sally's. Tidy place and great location!! To top it off, the complimentary breakfast is a nice touch and welcome relief for a traveller. Jeffrey was a friendly host, who made sure everything was ok. 

I would recommend this place to anyone."
4318031,47737857,2015-09-21,14912758,Shelong,"Jeffery was very detailed and thorough with his instructions for how to get there, what to expect, and how to gain access into the building and room. Everything was laid out and he was very accommodating. He let us check in early and check out later than his usual time. He continuously checked in with us to make sure there was nothing awry, which was great! Aside from a few things that let us know he lives there (duh!), the room was clean and very welcoming. He had water and snacks stocked, which was a welcome sight at the end of a long day of exploring Seattle. I would definitely reserve his place again in the future."
4318031,48590135,2015-09-27,24901898,Elaine,Aunt Sally's studio was perfect for my trip to Seattle. It is close to the major tourist attractions as well as the Seattle nightlife. All the amenities listed were provided as well as breakfast! It was nice to start the day off with a quick bite to eat before heading out. It was a great price and perfect location for everything I wanted to do. Would definitely stay here again.
4318031,49483396,2015-10-04,28413014,Erin,"Great location close to the Space Needle and lots of good dining and bars. Jeffery was a friendly, thorough host who even has a box of travel-sized toiletries in case you forget something. He also asks what you want for breakfast and will provide the ingredients ahead of time! The California King size bed was suuuuper comfortable. We would definitely stay here again."
4318031,50406576,2015-10-11,45937042,Jason,"Jeffery was very attentive and did everything he could to make sure we had a pleasant stay at his place. The kitchen was stocked very well and Jeffery made good on his word to pick up personal breakfast items beforehand. Very nicely done! The apt is small and spartan, but we didn't spend much time there so that wasn't a big deal to us. The location is close to downtown, Capital Hill, and Pikes Place Market. 10 min walk or 5 min bike ride to most any of those places. The building was quaint. There is no elevator in the building so you will have to walk up 4 flights of stairs. Also, the building itself was quiet, but not the cleanest. It looked as though some renovations were taking place while we were there, as some walls had holes in them and there were construction supplies around. All-in-all, we had a great time in Seattle and while the room itself is average, Jeffery makes it feel more like 5 stars with his personal touches. Very much recommend."
4318031,51455327,2015-10-20,1732013,Jennifer,"Our experience with Jeffery and Aunt Sally's studio couldn't have been better. Jeffery was communicative, attentive to details, and even checked in with us to make sure we were comfortable and able to get in and out. His fine touches of breakfast, toiletries, and maps of Seattle couldn't have been better. Aunt Sally's was close to it all.... The Space Needle, Pikes Market, fabulous eateries, and much more. We would definitely come back. Thanks Jeffery! "
4318031,53336219,2015-11-08,44107527,Allie,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic. My boyfriend and I chose Aunt Sally's Studio in Seattle since it was close to the Seattle Center (10 minute walk to Space Needle/Chihuly/EMP Museum)! Once booked, we had zero issues. Jeffery was a wonderful, thoughtful host from start to end. He promptly emailed us information about our stay and asked for our breakfast orders which were waiting for us in the fridge/freezer/pantry. They can be very specific, down to the actual brand! He gave us great advice on getting to the apartment from the airport. He called and texted us to make sure we were able to get into the apartment the first night. No issues with keys at all. The apartment is on the 4th floor (top floor) in a walk up building. No elevator. There was construction around the building, but nothing too loud. The building is fairly old. The apartment itself looks refurbished. Saw a few other tenants; overall a nice, quiet building. The bed was comfortable and everything was clean. In the photos, there's a TV on the little dining table in the bedroom, but it's now a larger TV and moved to a table against the wall across from the foot of the bed, so it was easy to watch Netflix in bed (no cable). Jeffery also had an Amazon Echo, which was fun to play around with. The kitchen pantry had tons of pamphlets with places to go, coffee maker, granola bars, hot chocolate, etc. Everything you'd need! The bathroom was also stocked with travel sized toiletries. The apple juice we had requested was not there for our first night (the only thing missing), but Jeffery knew and had it sent to us via Amazon Prime Fresh and he let us know when it was delivered outside. He was awesome! :) Thank you so much, Jeffery! Aunt Sally's Studio was perfect for our weekend stay in Seattle."
4318031,54247416,2015-11-17,45754998,Annette,"Our stay at Aunt Sally’s Studio was our 1st Airbnb experience and I am not sure any future experiences can top this one! Jeffrey was wonderful from the moment we booked our trip. Weeks prior to the trip he asked for our general itinerary so he could share any suggestions and tips with us. He also asked for our breakfast/snack preferences. I was shocked when we arrived to see the fridge stocked from top to bottom with breakfast items, coffee, water, etc. The studio’s cleanliness was impeccable.  Jeffrey checked on us throughout the trip to make sure we were having a good time and to see if there was anything else he could do for us. What incredible service. 

Jeffrey’s studio was only a 5 min walk from the Space Needle and main museums in Seattle and about a 15 minute walk from the main downtown/pikes peak area. The listing for this Airbnb was spot on and the ratings were 100% accurate. I highly recommend Aunt Sally’s Studio for their stay in Seattle. Thanks again Jeffrey! 
"
4318031,55104297,2015-11-28,3076881,Dorothy,"Our stay at Jeffery's was perfect!  His place is a very nice apartment in downtown within walking distance to a lot of places.  We used the Monorail several times to get to downtown Seattle.  The bed was so comfy and he provided wonderful fluffy towels.  He had our favorite breakfast foods for us and was so accommodating.
Jeffery is a fabulous host, an excellent and detailed communicator.  He was always very helpful. 
My daughter and I would definitely stay at Jefferey's again and would recommend his place to others."
4318031,55850797,2015-12-06,25070657,Kendra,"Great location and very attentive host! Jeffery contacted me very soon after booking the studio apartment, requesting breakfast items for our stay. My husband and I found the apartment to be comfortable, and located in an accessible part of downtown Seattle. The area felt safe and near plenty of restaurants and downtown attractions. The listing is very similar to the experience, however there is a bit more on the shelves/walls than in the pictures. "
3959460,18776071,2014-08-31,1994407,Zachary,"From the moment we arrived to the time we had to leave Beth and her home were a fantastic feature of our trip. She lives in a quiet, clean and unique neighborhood, and was a bright and pleasant host.

Beth went out of her way to be accommodating, providing us with eggs fresh from her chickens, and a welcoming letter with some fantastic suggestions for local events and features. She was sure to let us know that if there was anything we needed for our stay to ask if she had it. 

The apartment was the upstairs portion of the house, affording views of the neighborhood and surrounding area. The upper porch was safe and comfortable, I spent the morning of our second day reading in the dawn light. The apartment itself was gorgeous and open, with many skylights allowing ample sunlight during the day and views of the stars at night. Not pictured is a wonderful nook setup for children to sleep and gaze out at the sky. I attempted to do so myself - but am simply too tall. :-D

The bedroom space houses a rather large comfortable bed. The pillows were featherdown, and of a quality that made me reconsider how I've spent my life sleeping with an inferior substitute. The comforter also appeared to be featherdown, and the sheets were fantastic. All of the bedding smelled freshly washed and felt wonderful.

Within walking distance of her home are many attractive locations for a variety of activities. Easy access to food ranging from 24/7 American Diner (best corned beef ever!), to Thai, Mexican, Greek, and many others.

One of our goals during the trip was to try some local coffee, and we found many small coffee shops in the surrounding area. Our favorite was Cafe Vita - offering what we felt was the best french pressed coffee around.

If Beth will have us back - we'd love to stay with her again on any future trips. Her home was simply the best we could have hoped for, with none of the distractions of a regular hotel, and provided us with the privacy and quiet we desired for our short vacation."
3959460,19104966,2014-09-06,20373511,Kelley,"Beth's place was as pictured. It's really charming with hard wood floors and high ceilings. There is even a little hidden nook in the bedroom which is adorable. The grounds are great too, there is a deck off the apartment and a chicken coop in the yard. We were treated to fresh eggs from the chickens every day. This was a nice little bonus. The place was stocked with any necessity that we needed and Beth and her family were very accommodating. They even offered to give us pancake mix if we needed it on our last day. The neighborhood is really walkable. A couple of blocks up the hill is a nice little district with shops and restaurants. We were also able to get to the downtown area pretty easily from Beth's, it was about a 10 minute drive. All in all i would recommend Beth's place for your visit to Seattle. "
3959460,19442122,2014-09-12,6804418,Jack And Mikinzie,Beth was warm and easygoing. The house is very nicely put together and the bed was comfortable. To the west the neighborhood of Phinney Ridge is extremely close and has everything one needs. To the east strap on some running or walking shoes and enjoy Greenlakes 2.8 mile water park loop. 
3959460,19636491,2014-09-15,12743983,Danielle,"What a great place!  The views are phenomenal, the space is bright and inviting, and the hosts were great.  I would highly recommend this place for kids - there's a great little cubby that our 2 kids spent the whole time in (even to sleep!) except when they were checking on the chickens and playing on the swing set fort.  Just 3 blocks from the great restaurants and shops of Phinney Ridge and just a hop skip and jump to downtown.  The bed is so comfortable and there's a fully stocked kitchen - even with essentials like cooking oil, butter, eggs (fresh!), etc.  The cereal bars and ideas of things to do that weekend were a great addition.  Communication with Beth was super fast.  Thanks for sharing the space with us!"
3959460,19718066,2014-09-16,2575421,Rachel,"Beth's space was wonderful for our needs--spacious, clean, great area.  Only a short drive from downtown Seattle and a block or two away from great restaurants.  We only stayed one night, but it was a great one!  Beth was kind and generous.  She let us keep to ourselves while still making known that she was just downstairs if we needed anything.  I'd definitely stay here again!"
3959460,20037641,2014-09-22,3915771,Megan,"We loved our time at Beth's place in Phinney Ridge. The apartment is bright and sunny with a balcony and beautiful view. Beth and her partner were very friendly and accommodating but also gave us as much privacy as we wanted. In other words, the perfect hosts! We will definitely be back!"
3959460,20269934,2014-09-26,6195254,Rosamma,"
We really enjoyed our stay. Loved the location and views. Beth took care of all our needs including giving us a jump when my daughter's car wouldn't start. She had plenty of extra goodies for us to enjoy. The farm fresh eggs were yummy. Will definitely  stay here again.  Thanks Beth!"
3959460,20371992,2014-09-28,21154086,Cam,"The description of this property fit perfectly.  It was easy to find and get to from downtown.  It is within walking distance to Greenwood Ave and Greenlake.  The top balcony where the unit is located has a view of Greenlake.  We were never challenged with parking in the neighborhood and Beth and her family made us feel welcome - even O'Malley their beautiful dog.  Beth left yogurt, muffins and fresh eggs for breakfast. (Fresh from the chickens that live in a coop in her yard).  I will definitely recommend this place to my friends.  Thanks Beth!"
3959460,20618515,2014-10-02,18742635,Viva,"Beth's place was lovely.  It was our first day in town, and she was very flexible with our timing.  We arrived at night, and they left the stair lights on that led up to their sweet upstairs with an awesome view.  Coffee and yogurt in the fridge and the sunset from the deck completed the warmth of our visit.  We'd definitely stay again."
3959460,20720648,2014-10-04,1497697,Mitch,"We had a wonderful time during our stay at Beth's place. It was absolutely perfect for our family and especially for our 2-year old son. It was nice having a separate bedroom and living area so we could put him down and still hang out. The play equipment in the backyard was great and the best part (from our son's perspective) was the chicken coop with real chickens! Beth and her family were very welcoming, but not intrusive. They even provided some nice granola bars, yogurts, and coffee for us along with guidebooks and advice on what to do in Seattle. I'd highly recommend their place for any family looking for a comfortable and inviting place in the Seattle area. One note, it is definitely helpful to have a car. "
3959460,21001398,2014-10-09,12513132,Abby,"Great experience. The apartment was just perfect for our needs, hosts were very responsive, left out little touches like snacks and maps that were very welcoming. Definitely recommended!"
3959460,21669443,2014-10-21,21644281,Rachel,"We were made welcome when we arrived to this lovely apartment in the very nice Green wood area. The apartment was light and airy and welcoming. It was clean and in good condition. We were travelling from UK so requested a hair dryer, this was waiting for us - thank you! I am sure our hosts would happily have helped us with anything we needed whilst there too.  We have had a lovely stay and I would stay there again."
3959460,21846671,2014-10-25,22309980,Jenny,The house is so good. It nears the lake and have a good view. It's warm and clean with complete facilities. We had a really nice time there.
3959460,21979178,2014-10-27,9810231,Ruth,"Hey there, wasnt sure if you got my text message last night, but I think I left my spatula at your place. It was a gift and I would like to get it back someway. I can pay for shipping or ask  a friend to pick it up. Let me know if it is there, I am not 100% sure it that it is. But its my best bet. (phone number hidden)"
3959460,22242044,2014-11-02,4007212,Heather & Garric,"We stayed 3 nights in Beth's upper level apartment and it couldn't have been a better home base for our family to return to after long days exploring the city and nearby zoo. The neighborhood is a sweet residential neighborhood tucked away from the busy hum of the city yet minutes away from city activity, it's quiet which I loved and feels incredibly safe. We appreciated all the sky lights, the high ceilings and being able to do some light cooking. Beth was an ideal host (very responsive and attentive yet appreciative of our need for privacy) and the place felt very family friendly and accepting of our toddler. A great place for those that like quiet but also want to be near it all!"
3959460,22537247,2014-11-09,5173769,Tara,"This space was absolutely wonderful! Highly recommended! Beautiful views and outdoor hangout spots. The inside was clean and lovely, bright and open layout. Nice neighborhood in central location. Our hosts were available but gave us privacy. I would definitely visit again! "
3959460,23183145,2014-11-24,23451356,Sonia,"This was a wonderful place for our stay in Seattle! Everything was convenient and comfortable, with no problems checking in or out. We had the place to ourselves, but the hosts were welcoming and responsive to all our questions. They left us everything we needed and more, including fresh eggs from the chickens out back (which we cooked for breakfast one morning - yum!).

Both beds were comfortable, and there's a very cool extra sleeping place in an alcove off the bedroom. When we unexpectedly had an extra guest join us for one night (he got the cool alcove!), the hosts were happy to let him stay.

The neighborhood is quiet but not far from some nice coffee shops and eateries. A bus runs fairly nearby if you want to get downtown. (Or if you have a car, on-street parking seems to be no problem.) Also, the view is great! We highly recommend this place and would happily stay again."
3959460,23328656,2014-11-29,4812238,Andy,"Beth and her family were very welcoming and helpful. Their house is in a great location. We walked to coffee at Herkimer Coffee, there are many restaurants and a nice market all very close and walkable. The neighborhood is amazing, lots of really charming houses including Beth's. The upper level is clean, and open with lots of light and comfortable sleeping arrangements. Awesome views and we walked down and around Green Lake from the house. The eggs from their chickens are very delicious. This is a really great place in an excellent location with awesome hosts. We will definitely stay here again."
3959460,24527828,2014-12-30,19789776,Yosuke,"It was very comfortable stay for us.
Good restaurant,cafe and market were close.
And it was so silent that be good to sleep at night.
There was no troubles though our English was poor.
Ms.Beth kept our privacy and her guidebook was very helpful!
"
3959460,24667963,2015-01-01,24559545,Annemarie,"The neighborhood was very pleasant, quiet, and pretty.  Our hostess extended the courtesy of offering some cooking items we were in need of.  She was very hospitable.  The unit was very comfortable, the beds were lovely.  The unit was clean."
3959460,25180980,2015-01-08,25197507,Greg,"It was really easy coordinating with Beth, and things were very much as expected. It was a great location, as well. Parking can be a bit tight, but totally doable."
3959460,25459378,2015-01-16,15121499,Kathryn,Beth is a great host! Super communicative and accommodating. The home is fantastic; spacious and in a great location. I'd recommend for sure!
3959460,25587180,2015-01-19,11803109,Patrick,Great spot and very nice host!  We'll definitely keep this place in our short list!  It's pet-friendly and clean. 
3959460,25882621,2015-01-28,1007282,Hallie,"We stayed in Beth's upper level duplex for our last 4 days after selling our home and living in Seattle for just over 7 years before relocating to Europe.  We were given a warm welcome and invited to ask for anything we needed and even visit with them in their home.  Because we were busy wrapping up our move with Vet appointments and work to finish, we weren't able to spend much time visiting, but when we did run into each other, Beth and her family were very friendly and we felt extremely comfortable the whole time.  We were also given all the privacy we wanted and were not bothered by any noise.  The apartment is well furnished and quite convenient, both in terms of proximity to many great neighborhoods and downtown Seattle, as well as being equipped with a washer/dryer, dishwasher, and the layout is very nice too.  We had beautiful weather and spent one afternoon with  the french doors open to the gorgeous views of Green Lake and the Cascades, with birds chirping, while we worked in the dining and den areas, and our black lab enjoyed sunning on the upper deck and occasionally greeted by Beth's friendly lab.  We were also treated with amazing sunrises and sunsets, easy parking, and fresh eggs from their chickens.  

Definitely recommend and zero complaints!

When we move back to Seattle in a few years and need a temporary place to stay, and for any friends/family who may visit us, I hope Beth's place will still be there, because I would love to stay there again, and think any visitor would be lucky to stay here for a true Seattle experience."
3959460,29609037,2015-04-10,4076408,Eidan,"What a great apartment!  My wife and I needed to stay in Seattle for an extended period of time for medical treatment (6 weeks).  We chose this place for its proximity to the treatment center, and couldn't have been happier with the apartment.  There is so much light with skylights, and there is a beautiful deck with views of Greenlake and surrounding mountains.  Beth and Rebecca were so welcoming and made us feel right at home.  I would definitely recommend staying here!"
3959460,30743072,2015-04-26,13934391,Ryan,"Our hosts were incredibly accommodating and polite, and it's a fantastic neighborhood to walk around in, with multiple bars, a brewery, breakfast spots, pizza, etc. The unit is completely separate from the owner's living area and very spacious and nice. We'll definitely consider staying here again next time we're in Seattle."
3959460,32829175,2015-05-22,31296193,Emily,"The space was perfect for our needs--2 adults and 2 kids.  Appreciated the bright space, the  fruit and eggs, and Beth's friendly laid-back attitude.  Kids loved the little skylight nook.  Thanks!"
3959460,33287968,2015-05-26,18524382,Justin,"Beth and her family were friendly hosts that gave us space while also remaining available.  The place is located in a very good neighborhood and is a short walk downhill from a lot of restaurants and coffee shops.  The unit itself is just like in the pictures and is very well maintained by Beth.  For a family of three (me, my wife, and toddler), this was the perfect location for visiting Seattle.

Also, prior to arriving, Beth and I exchanged several messages, which is very reassuring when visiting a city for the first time.  She was always quick to respond which made communicating with her an ease.  On the last day, she even gave us some of the eggs from her pet chicken!"
3959460,33817859,2015-06-01,32200562,Ali,"Great spot in a wonderful neighborhood in Seattle! Our hosts were very nice and welcoming, but gave us our space. Neighborhood is wonderful to walk around in and has easy access to the bus system which you can take right to downtown Seattle for all the fun tourist spots. Great first AirBNB stay."
3959460,34091992,2015-06-04,34134113,John,Beth's place is an adorable cottage top floor in a quiet residential neighborhood that was an easy drive to downtown.  The flat was very clean and well stocked.  I would definitely recommend this place!
3959460,34331286,2015-06-07,33246998,Kathryn,My children and I really liked the feel of Beth's place.  We loved the sunny space and the neighborhood.  It was as-advertised and we would stay here again in a heartbeat.  Beth was helpful & friendly!
3959460,34626016,2015-06-10,29414521,Heidi,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Beth and Rebecca! The apartment was perfect for us and our toddler. They were also very welcoming of our dog. They were available for tips and info, provided great dining recommendations, and were just kind people! We loved Seattle and will visit again - we'd definitely like to do a repeat stay. Thanks!"
3959460,34792032,2015-06-12,16577639,Tami,"I really enjoyed my stay.    It was comfortable and had everything I needed.   The space was large, and comfortable and yet it still felt cozy.    It had several sky lights and windows which let the natural light flow in.  The view and deck was an added bonus.    Beth was a fantastic hostess. 

I would love to stay here again and again when I visit Seattle.    "
3959460,35776417,2015-06-22,29410594,Noreen,"Beth was a welcoming and helpful host, and we enjoyed our stay.  The apartment is bright, comfortable and homelike.  The location is very convenient for the downtown bus, and is is near good restaurants.  The neighborhood is quiet.  And for the weary traveler...the bed is the most comfortable one I have ever had away from home!"
3959460,36691389,2015-06-30,493625,Bretta,"What a wonderful place to be! We arrived late at night Beth made it easy for us. We arrived to find coffee, fresh eggs and breakfast bars. Not to mention a fabulous apt in the tree tops. We saw Mt Rainer everyday and had relaxing evenings on the patio. Our hosts were gracious and accomidating. We will be booking this apt. Agian next summer when we return to Seattle! "
3959460,37446455,2015-07-07,13603985,Carol,"The apartment was terrific and plenty big enough for 3. The location was convenient for getting around town, with a great deck for viewing the city. Beth was friendly and helpful in all areas."
3959460,39724019,2015-07-26,9948973,Roger And Carmen,"The listing description is accurate and the apartment is quite comfortable -- it is easy to feel at home in this environment.  The property is child- and pet-friendly.  The host's policy that dogs are not to be left unattended for more than one hour is strict.  As a result, dining out may pose some difficulty if one has a dog with him/her.  This was not a problem for us nor did it impact our stay since we never left our pooch unattended.  Guests who bring dogs should also be aware that a neighbor is hypersensitve to dog barking so even minimal barking causes the host concern.  The community is wonderful with many great restaurants, pubs, etc. within walking distance of the apartment.  The zoo is very close as well which is an additional draw for adults and children alike."
3959460,40247154,2015-07-29,18161825,Kapil,We loved Beth's duplex. A unique and nice place to stay. The view from balcony was excellent and everything in house was perfect. My daughter loved playing in the small den attached to the bedroom. Beth is a very generous host who truly takes care of her guests.
3959460,43230616,2015-08-18,34488392,Rachel,"This was the perfect place our 6 day vacation in Seattle! Beth and family were perfect hosts and made us feel welcome. Our two young children loved playing in the little nook and it was very convenient to be able to use the kitchen to make some of our meals, as well as to use the small washer/dryer. It was unusually hot a couple of the days, but the fans provided helped. The location was great and we walked several times to eat on Greenwood. We definitely would stay here again. "
3959460,44931451,2015-08-30,17687357,Erin,"Beth's place is great!  It is nice and bright with lots of windows. We enjoyed the upper deck. It is in walking distance to a few restaurants and a grocery store. Fremont, Ballard, Capitol Hill and Downtown Seattle are just a quick uber or bus ride away. We will definitely stay here again!"
3959460,45443308,2015-09-02,9966218,Livia,"Just a really stellar experience. So cozy, so homey, so comfortable and convenient. Bed was awesome! Kitchen is great. Amazing and very enjoyable view. Lots of light and windows and nooks and crannies (my favorite.) Beth and Rebecca are both very considerate and accommodating. We loved our stay; I unequivocally recommend it. Thank you so much for everything! Too many details and extras to name."
3959460,45985679,2015-09-07,3300968,Evelyn,"Loved the apartment - it looked even better in person. Beautifully decorated and well kept. Gorgeous view. Also within walking distance of some good restaurants and a quick drive away from downtown Seattle, the Fremont area, etc.

The kitchen was well stocked with amenities as were the bathroom and bedrooms. The beds were comfortable. 

Beth and Rebecca were also wonderful hosts. Really helpful with recommendations and so welcoming when we first arrived. They gave some good tips as to where to travel and what the goings on were that weekend. Also, they let us a borrow an umbrella as we were ill prepared for the Seattle weather.

Overall, it was a lovely experience and our only negative is we couldn't stay longer. Highly recommend."
3959460,49886791,2015-10-07,37422111,John,"Beth had the apartment open and ready for our arrival, we hand no hassle with our check.   All details had been covered over the inter-net prior to our arrival.   Positive experience compered with the normal hotel check in.  

The apartment is light, bright clean and aerie and not a basement dungeon.   This requires a brief clime up a well lit staircase.  The space is reasonably spacious and attractively decorated.   The best feature is the neighborhood lots of interesting resterrents, sports  bars and coffee shops with in walking distance.  Street parking no problem.

The furnishings are adequate but would not meet RCI Gold Standards.

3959460,51169815,2015-10-18,10334671,Lisa,"My younger daughter and I spent 9 nights here and had a fabulous time.  Communication with the host was easy.  The apartment was divine and its location was perfect for using public transportation, biking, and car.  Easy walking distance to loads of places to eat and coffee shops.  The layout of the apartment was perfect for us--I could work at the dining room table, my younger daughter could do her homework next to me"
3959460,57644576,2015-12-28,46937932,Shannon,"Beth checked in with us before we arrived to let us know how to find the apartment and where to park.  The apartment is EXACTLY as pictured and described in the profile ... and the view of Green Lake is AWESOME!  It had everything we needed, particularly great heating and hot water supply in the shower, which we appreciated since we were there during a cold Christmas week.  We also liked having a washer and dryer since we were there for a while.  Beth was also responsive to my engineer husband's suggestions about the fan function on the NEST.  Great place!"
1027860,6911981,2013-08-30,4965849,Jeannette,"We stayed here for 10 nights last August and had a wonderful time. The house is located in a great location that's convenient to stores, restaurants and shopping yet set away from the hustle and bustle. We loved the floor plan and the functionality of the house. The views from the main living area are beautiful! This house is set up perfectly for children, especially small children. The Apple TV was a little challenging to get used to since we are not experienced users. Kim was a pleasure to communicate with and was very accommodating. We do hope to return back to Seattle one day and most definitely would stay here again. "
1027860,15535578,2014-07-11,15912586,Amy,"My husband and I (with our two young children) stayed at Kim's home for a week in July 2014.  It was a great fit for our needs.  We would definitely stay there again if the opportunity arises.  Kim and her husband put a lot of intention behind the design of their beautiful home, making it a welcoming and serene environment.  While it's not a large home, it feels spacious and the view is expansive. We had plenty of space for our family of four. The house is uncluttered, very clean, and well organized.  Everything is thoughtfully placed.  We had plenty of drawer and closet space which helped make us feel right at home.  When we arrived we were greeted by a kind note, cookies, a list of child friendly attractions in the area, directions for how to work all the gadgets in the house, and toys set aside for our children.  It was easy to be there, especially with children.  When not out and about in Seattle, we spent time relaxing and enjoying the incredible view while our children played with toys inside and outside (in the very private back yard).  The house is well child proofed so we felt we really could relax.  The kitchen was well equipped and easy to navigate.  We were able to cook many of our meal’s at home. Kim's home is VERY conveniently located, so we also enjoyed many family restaurants, mostly in Ballard and Queen Anne.  Overall, it's a really special place.  We highly recommend this spot whether you have children or not.  "
7603457,42937445,2015-08-16,39268011,Wenqi,Khadija is a very nice host. She showed us the direction to her apartment before we departed and we felt really welcomed upon arrival. The place was clean and it had everything we needed. Just felt like we were back home. It's pretty close to Kerry Park where you can see the whole Seattle downtown from there and 5 mins away from downtown Seattle by taxi. Overall this is an awesome place for us and we really enjoyed our stay here. Definitely will choose this place again if there is a chance to visit Seattle later.
7603457,44966756,2015-08-30,38981714,Stephen,Khadija is an awesome host!  She made my girlfriend and I feel very welcome to Seattle.  Her place is well-kept and is in walking distance to the Space Needle and Kerry Park.  The best part was that she allowed us to stay as long as we needed to on the departure day.  That was great because our flight wasn't until late in the evening.  We couldn't have done that at a hotel!  We highly commend Khadija and her home.
7603457,46791467,2015-09-13,34047152,Andy,"Khadija was a great host! She left clear instructions on how to get in, and gave us some info on the area and what there was for entertainment near by. The apartment was nice, quiet, cozy, and very clean. The neighborhood was great also. Had a lot of choices for nightlife and just a short walk or drive down to the Market. Would definitely recommend to anyone! "
7603457,48753282,2015-09-28,20187594,Sachi,"The apartment was located in the convenient place–just 3-4 blocks from Safeway and walking distance to Space Needle. We spent relaxing time in the large living room. Everything we needed was in the room. We felt like living in our own apartment.  
Although we didn’t have a chance to see Khadija, she was responsive and gave us clear instructions so everything was very easy and smooth. It was a pleasant stay. Thank you very much! 
"
7603457,49553567,2015-10-04,18599859,Andrew,"Khadija's place was very comfortable, and she made it extremely easy for us to get set up. I'd definitely recommend this place! Rooftop had a great view of the city, and it's close enough to downtown to walk. "

7603457,51064171,2015-10-17,5802830,David,"Khadija was a great host! The apartment was nice and clean and in a great location. She was also particularly accommodating in that she allowed us to leave our luggage in the apartment all day on the day of check out, which allowed us extra time to explore the city. Highly recommended!"
7603457,51796170,2015-10-24,25201270,Shakeeb,"This was my first time in Seattle and I'm so glad I chose to stay here. It is centrally located to both downtown and the Space Needle and the apartment itself is clean and comfortable. Khadijah was extremely flexible with the check in and checkout times and that was a major plus for us. The view from the apartment rooftop deck is incredible and is a great photo-op. And the price was definitely on point. 

I'd definitely try to book this apartment the next time I swing by Seattle. "
7603457,54047040,2015-11-15,48204672,Krishnendu,"This was our first trip to Seattle and first Airbnb experience. We are really glad that we chose Khadija's place as this was truly a nice experience for us. Khadija was very helpful answering all of our questions promptly and making the apartment ready before our arrival. In addition to 1 bed that mentioned in the listing, she provided a comfortable air mattress and plenty of blankets for all three of us. The apartment is in great location; space needle few blocks away and pike market is 10 min by bus. The apartment is clean, impeccably organized just to make you feel like home. Khadija was also flexible about arrival/departure time and that helped us to drop our luggage at the apartment then to go out exploring the city. Overall, very nice experience as a first Airbnb guest and thanks to Khadija to make it possible. "
7127036,41404290,2015-08-07,4810009,Alvaro,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7127036,41980411,2015-08-10,32516158,Yan,Caroline has a really cozy place. We enjoyed every minute of staying! The neighborhood is really beautiful. We had a great time!
6091789,40085632,2015-07-28,5362609,Jenny And Cody,"This place was great!  Very comfortable home with many wonderful shops and restaurants within walking distance, and only a short taxi or bus ride to downtown. We did not get to meet the host Dan but he was very commutative and helpful. He really went out of his way to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Overall a great place in a great Seattle neighbourhood!"
7579854,40540483,2015-07-31,9057118,Christina,Duncan was very helpful and easy to communicate with. His space was very cozy and clean-- the beds were especially comfortable! 
7579854,40696945,2015-08-01,19255120,Khalilah,"Functional spot near Broadway, short walk to shops, bars etc"
7579854,41023199,2015-08-03,39764304,Yi,The location is quite convenient and the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Is it enough for two people but a little bit small for four people. Anyway it is quite lovely.
7579854,41486765,2015-08-07,39760326,Ryan,Duncan was a great host - very flexible and accommodating.  Capitol Hill is a nice place to stay for the night with lots bars and coffee shops.  Would definitely recommend this listing
7579854,42038673,2015-08-10,1869165,David,"Great communication and very prompt. This was one of the busiest weekend to book in Seattle and Duncan was very polite, quick to respond, and very pleasant. The bed was comfortable, it was in a great location, and also had the bonus of a parking space. I would definitely recommend this place and the host Duncan. He kept accommodating all my change, thank you again."
7579854,44188603,2015-08-24,6707442,Diane,Duncan was a most accommodating host. His place is located so near efficient and clean public transportation that we left our car parked for the whole time. And that saved us some money. And it was such a relief that he has designated parking. The little coffee shop near him became a regular place for us. Perfect for us tourists to experience Seattle's ubiquitous coffee experience. He was so kind as to pick up milk and cereal for my father (age 83) who arrived before my daughter and I did. He showed my father around and made him comfortable before we arrived. He even had fresh flowers for us. The place is small but the three of us had VERY comfortable beds and the kitchen had everything we needed.  His is a wonderful AirBnB. Thank you again Duncan!!
7579854,45133241,2015-08-31,28534609,Peter,"The description and the photos are very accurate as to what the experience was like at Duncan's Cozy Oasis. However, the apartment was slightly darker than what it is depicted in the pictures but it was not a problem. Additionally, the beds were very comfortable and large; we were able to fit two people on each bed with no problem at all. Furthermore, the location of the apartment is great! There is a bus stop very close and the bus takes you straight to downtown within 15-20mins. Also, Duncan is a very nice and accommodating host. Thus, our experience with Duncan was wonderful!"
7579854,46176529,2015-09-08,9960942,Alison,"Duncan's apartment is in a nice location, right next to the Volunteer Park and a quick drive away from downtown. All the pictures and description of his place are accurate. It seems as though the rest of the tenants in this complex are younger. We could tell that he put in effort to make you feel welcome, with fresh flowers and nicely folded towels (it's the little things!). I would recommend this place if you plan on being out in the city and need someplace to rest up after packed days of travelling. "
7579854,47838668,2015-09-21,1153244,Andy,"Great location, clean apartment. Small, but just fine if you're not planning on hanging out at home."
7579854,50309658,2015-10-11,43071196,Gulsun,"We are seniors both my husband and I and used to certain amenities that were lacking in this little apartment.  However the kindness and positive approach of Duncan, our host made things much easier.  He was always willing to help with any problems we had.  The location is perfect the apartment, especially the kitchen is very small.  Don't expect to do any major cooking ;).  But if you are young and do not stay in a lot it is very convenient, and like I said before Duncan is always available to smooth out things and a charming young man.  "
7579854,50803699,2015-10-14,11907,Charles,Great host
7579854,51542524,2015-10-21,7643544,Stephen,"Duncan made my wife and I feel very comfortable, and we quickly came to appreciate the apartment's conveniences. The neigborhood
was great, with many shops on Broadway.  The place was very quiet after 11pm, which made sleeping easy.

Wifi worked great, and TV  too.

Apartment was clean and very functional. I can't imagine staying in
a hotel when a place like this offers a refrigerator, microwave , coffee maker, etc


 

"
7579854,54006358,2015-11-15,23610390,Maryann,"Duncan was very welcoming and helpful.  The apartment was comfortable and in a nice quiet neighborhood, but close to restaurants and transportation.  Great walking area with 
Volunteer Park 2 blocks away."
7579854,55953747,2015-12-07,5882827,Diana,"We really enjoyed our experience at Duncan's place. The place was a breeze to get to from I-5 and the fact that there was a dedicated parking space was indispensable. We ended up walking pretty much everywhere. For ease of reading, I'll break down my favorite aspects about Duncan's listing and a few things to note as well.  

Favorite parts:
- Price based on location and amenities. The listing is located in a quiet residential area close to many Capitol Hill shops and restaurants. Duncan offers many amenities such as cable tv, Xbox, and dedicated parking, plus two large beds. All this is offered at a very, very reasonable nightly price. 
- Communication. Duncan was quick to respond to every single question. 
- Safety. The apartment is inside a gated apartment complex. This wasn't a huge concern (the neighborhood seemed fine) but it was just a nice little bonus. 

Things to note: 
- The apartment gets a little warm and cannot be controlled from inside the unit. We simply opened up the windows and it was fine, but that may prove problematic if you are a light sleeper. 
- If shopping at the QFC grocery store nearby, be aware that they charge for parking inside their garage. We learned that the hard way...I don't know why we didn't just walk there, it's very close! 

Overall, Duncan's place was awesome and I would recommend it. We would gladly stay there again next time we're in Seattle! "
7579854,57694108,2015-12-28,26392458,Kevin,"Cozy is definitely the word for this apartment. It is in a gated complex, which felt very secure. There was an available parking spot, but we did not find the need to use it. The apartment itself is fairly well-lit, had plants indoors, and was cozy. We had four people during our stay, so the space was a little tight for us and our suitcases. However, we were able to make it work. Duncan is extremely responsive to communication and he is very proactive in checking up on the experience of your stay, which we are grateful for. The apartment also has a TV and gaming consoles, which were a nice touch. The beds were soft. The main drawback of the location is that it is small, but since the four of us were out and about during the day, it did not matter too much. The apartment is very well-located, as it is a block away from a larger street. It is a short 3-minute walk from Volunteer Park, and a 10-minute walk to a supermarket. Overall, I'd recommend this place if you had 3 to 4 people and expect to be using this space only for sleeping. "
1349175,5820415,2013-07-17,7467566,Sarah,"We had an awesome  stay, Kyle & Nicole were so friendly & helpful. We felt right at home, amazing views & got to enjoy a beautiful sunset on the deck! Would love for many more people to enjoy what this wonderful family have to offer, make sure you check out the secret garden."
1349175,5858013,2013-07-19,215113,Terri,the house was great  a very helpfull  cute baby did not not make a sound   and really nice  room and bathroom
1349175,5956206,2013-07-23,3562197,Nirav,"Kyle and his wife Nicole were wonderful hosts. Very communicative, gracious, and hospitable. The room itself is, along with its bathroom, on its own level with its own entrance, so it's almost like having your own apartment. And the view is as incredible as it seems. I'd definitely go back next time I'm in Seattle."
1349175,6060311,2013-07-28,7610269,Leann,"Amazing place to stay!  The location of Kyle's home is very close to bus stops and an easy walk into capital hill shopping.   I also recommend the short walk to prospect park for additional views of the city and enjoying the green space.  I highly recommend staying here  for the great views, friendly faces, and comfortable room.   We had a great time, and hope to stay there again soon."
1349175,6115449,2013-07-30,7429561,Desmond,"Kyle and Nicole were GREAT hosts. Our room and bathroom was spotless, and they even provided lovely organic toiletries. Each morning Kyle texted me letting me know there was extra coffee in the shared kitchen. This area of town is great, with lots of shops and food within walking distance. The 49 bus stop is a very short walk away and takes you downtown in a matter of minuts. I would highly recomend you stay at the Capital Hill Oasis for your next trip to Seattle."
1349175,6203038,2013-08-03,7591971,Matt,"Excellent hosts and a wonderful home. We enjoyed our stay, felt very welcome, and very accommodated. Thanks you guys!"
1349175,6296793,2013-08-06,4382217,Leslie,Kyle and his wife were very accommodating and helpful with information on the area. The location is terrific with great restaurants a beautiful half mile walk away and wooded paths right outside.  The guest room is cozy and the bathroom is nice - though it is in a basement.  They open their kitchen and breakfast nook to guest with organic cereals and fresh hot coffee awaiting in the morning.  Much better value than a hotel!
1349175,6316998,2013-08-07,436887,Scott,Kyle was a very friendly host and the accommodations were clean and very comfortable.  The house is also very convenient to downtown.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again!
1349175,6466154,2013-08-13,1144610,Max,"The house was perfect! Convenient location, gorgeous sunset views, really friendly, helpful hosts.
We were able to walk to breakfast (coffee and crepes) 10 mins. From there we were at the center of Capitol Hill. 
We had full run of the downstairs, nice bedroom and bathroom, even our own refrigerator! Our hosts were away for the weekend, but we felt right at home. Hosts checked in a couple times during the weekend to make sure we had everything we needed!
Why ever stay in a hotel!?"
1349175,6526412,2013-08-15,71884,Jag,Kyle has a nice place and was very accommodating! I highly recommend staying with him. 
1349175,6629748,2013-08-19,5396025,Kristina,"We stayed with Kyle and Nicole for a friend's wedding and it was a wonderful experience. Easy, super convenient to Volunteer Park and all the wonderfulness of the Capital Hill neighborhood. Nicole was super helpful and very gracious hostess. She had some great recommendations for brunch options. We would gladly stay with them again. "
1349175,6694742,2013-08-21,7903391,Victoria,"We had a great time at Kyle's place! Our hosts were friendly and  helpful while being respectful of our privacy. Communication was prompt and the place was clean and well looked after. I especially loved the amenities provided for us in the bathroom and the view from the breakfast nook was - phew, breath-taking! The location is convenient both by feet and by bus for the downtown area as well other districts like University district and Capitol Hill. The household is well loved and we would love to come back again!"
1349175,6969889,2013-09-01,1243271,Mallory,"Kyle's place has the most unbelievable view. Breakfast on the porch was amazing- we felt like we were in a treehouse! We liked having our own space downstairs, even though it was a small space. Kyle and Nicole were both really helpful with suggestions of restaurants in the area, and we loved their dog Zari! Also, Jack the baby was adorable, and very well behaved.

If you stay here, definitely walk to Volunteer park and a little bit north of it where you can get almost a 360 view of the city from the top of Capitol Hill. We stumbled upon the views by accident while walking home one night, and it was a wonderful surprise!"
1349175,6987080,2013-09-02,7446335,Julia,"Kyle's home was lovely and an easy bus ride to downtown Seattle - the views were stunning (as shown in the pictures), and the hosts were welcoming and friendly!  I recommend a stay for anyone looking to enjoy a neighborhood vibe while enjoying the city.  "
1349175,7097476,2013-09-06,6217575,Cindy,"We had a great experience with Kyle and family.  We hope to return again the next time we visit Seattle.  Great location, comfortable accommodations, and gracious hosts!"
1349175,7160925,2013-09-09,1556147,Melissa,"We had a lovely time staying at Kyle's place. The room was comfortable, and it was nice to have our own bathroom and entrance. The view from the deck is incredible! And we were close enough to be able to walk to the shops and restaurants on Capitol Hill. Kyle and his family were gracious hosts. He made sure we were comfortable and had what we needed. "
1349175,7232649,2013-09-11,8266818,Alana,"Beautiful hillside spot with a stunning view!  The location is great: safe, quiet neighborhood and conveniently next to stairs that lead up to the main road that takes you a short walk over to Broadway.  The accommodations were clean and the private bathroom was a plus.  Kyle was very responsive and Nicole was very kind in showing us the place. Thanks!"
1349175,7306073,2013-09-15,4365735,Virginia,"Warm and welcoming.  'Like visiting ""friends.""  Kyle and Nicole were very thoughtful and made us feel very comfortably ""at home.""  'Just to meet little Jack was a delight.  We were very impressed with their caring about the planet, their practices of sustainability, their use of healthy foods and of trying to preserve a healthy earth for their son.  We also enjoyed their garden and the vast neighborhood garden and its history.  'Comfortable room and bed -- and comfortable neighborhood.  People we would love to welcome to our own home."
1349175,7461532,2013-09-21,7182655,Faten,"Had a great stay here while in Seattle! Great hosts, homey accommodations, and very picturesque setting. The bedroom was comfortable, and the bathroom was clean, modern, and had a selection of products available. The kitchen and breakfast nook were lovely, and having a cup of coffee in the morning on the deck was such a nice start to the day. And the dog is very sweet! Highly recommended if you'd like a comfortable and serene stay close to Capitol Hill"
1349175,7534051,2013-09-23,8822028,Logan,Highly recommended.  Kyle and Nicole were so kind.  They had a great knowledge of the city too. Got recommended a few local eateries that we amazing.  Their place was great.  We had our own entry so we could come and go as we pleased.  Room was spotless.  Overall great experience.  We will be back. 
1349175,7614302,2013-09-26,8883225,Lucas,"Kyle, Nicole and their family were excellent hosts.  Nicole provided accurate guidance about nearby bus access and directed me to park areas where I could enjoy a nice morning run.  Kyle is a quick responder by text or phone call, and he pointed me to some nice coffee and lunch spots within walking distance.  The bedroom and bathroom were in great shape and as advertised.  This was my first visit to Seattle and first AirBnB stay.  Great first impressions on both accounts, and a big thank you to Kyle and Nicole.  "
1349175,7747955,2013-10-01,8373820,Alanna,"Staying with Kyle in Capitol Hill was a great idea. It was like waking up in a garden every morning. (Literally, Streissguth Gardens.) Kyle and his wife were super-charming and intelligent over morning-coffee, but certainly gave me and my boyfriend plenty of privacy. The guest-rental portion of the house is downstairs, but still has windows that let in plenty of morning light -- and you can see right from the bedroom to Lake Union. A quick walk to the other side of the hill, and you're looking at an amazing Lake Union vista. Most days we walked to the cafes-and-shopping part of the neighborhood, or to downtown, but several buses stop nearby, and Seattle cabs are really cheap, late at night. In ever way, a better deal than staying at a hostel (same price) or even the Ace Hotel, where the thriftiest room costs a third again as much and requires you to share a bathroom down the hall. The sparkling-clean bathtub at Kyle's came with the fluffiest towels and lavender bubble bath sachets, soooo yeah, using AirBnb to stay with Kyle and his little family was a very savvy decision. We had a great time in Seattle, thanks again!"
1349175,7890370,2013-10-07,766513,Jane,"My first visit to Seattle was truly special, thanks in part to our stay at Kyle and Nicole's beautiful home. I couldn't have imagined staying anywhere else. The room felt like a cozy cabin. It was clean and the bed was comfortable. My boyfriend and I also loved the privacy of having our own entrance and bathroom. We loved the surrounding gardens and the amazing view of the city and lake from their deck as well. The entire process of communicating with Kyle, from booking to checkout, was super smooth. We're looking forward to being back in Seattle, and without a doubt, we'd stay at Kyle's again."
1349175,8104567,2013-10-15,4669248,Lucas,"Kyle's house was great! It was easy to find, there was plenty of parking and the view was simply amazing! I really appreciated how clean, both the bedroom and bathroom were. There was fresh towels in the bathroom and clean sheets on the bed. Kyle kept in contact with me to make sure that I got into the house without any problems. I would definitely recommend Kyle's place to anyone coming to Seattle."
1349175,8127291,2013-10-16,3598102,Brett,"Kyle and Nicole are great hosts. I was a solo female on this trip, and felt very safe and comfortable. Exactly what I was looking for. Definitely accommodating  (I needed to arrive a little earlier than we discussed and Kyle worked it out).  He is extremely attentive to all communications.  Easy to work with. A comfortable, cozy, tranquil spot with a gorgeous view and easy access to the hustle and bustle without being in the thick of it. "
1349175,8191389,2013-10-20,8743721,Jonathan,"we've passed good time in Seattle.
The room was clean and the organization with kyle was perfect.

I recommand this place."
1349175,8381695,2013-10-28,7511325,Kristin,"I am from out-of-state and booked the Capitol Hill Oasis so I could spend the weekend with my daughter for her birthday. My older two daughters joined us as a surprise. Kyle was very accommodating with all our plans and the four of us thoroughly enjoyed our time at the bnb. The view is wonderful as is the home nestled in the hillside garden. From the home's location, we were easily able to get to restaurants and enjoyed all the nearby parks.This place is an absolute gem and I intend on trying to book here again when I am visiting Seattle."
1349175,8472757,2013-11-01,3553662,Micah,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Kyle's for a last minute 4 day trip up to Seattle. Kyle happened to be on a trip of his own at the time we were coming up so we didn't get to meet, but he left us notes with good recommendations! Morning coffee overlooking Lake Union from the balcony was wonderful. For us it was nestled nicely north from things to do in Capitol Hill, but also a short (2mi) walk to all the vegan food in the University District. The place it self was nice and warm at night, it felt like a cozy little cabin. This place is really a wonderful little haven."
1349175,8693054,2013-11-12,4230205,Kevin,"Kyle & Nicole were great! Very accomodating, good communication, and great to talk to. They gave me great advice on my first trip to the Puget Sound region. The space was very nice as well, with fantastic views of Lake Union on a quiet street. "
1349175,9400182,2013-12-26,10775349,Mimi,"We could not have asked for a better first-time Airbnb experience!  Though Kyle was out of town when we arrived, his directions were clear, and he was so helpful over text.  His beautiful place was spotless, the view from the porch was amazing, and it was everything my boyfriend and I could wanted on our first trip to Seattle.  My only regret is that I didn't book for longer!  An absolute gem!"
1349175,9518905,2014-01-01,9273975,Amy,"Overall I like the lovely atmosphere, friendly hosts and a cute dog. We only stayed two nights in Kyle's house, but we can totally feel the warmth of the family. Zari (Kyle's dog) is so well-mannered to guests, so even people who are not a big fan of dogs should be fine to stay in their place.
Only a few flaws about noise.
1. There is a highway near the house, so it would be a potential interruption for people who really need a quiet environment to sleep.
2. The house is made by wood, so we could hear the squeaky sound sometimes when people walks on the upstairs.
Other than that, we had a wonderful time there."
1349175,10435397,2014-02-18,11104620,Katie,"Extremely charming space in a very convenient and accessible part of the city. The views from the house were absolutely stunning, and it's a very short distance from the center of the city and everything that you could possible want.

The best part of the stay was definitely Kyle, who was an extremely helpful and gracious host. He went out of his way to make our stay comfortable, and his graciousness and generosity took our trip from good to spectacular. "
1349175,10697522,2014-03-03,3240288,Matthew,"Beautiful, private room in a great location. It really felt we were in our own private cabin. Kyle was a phenomenal host - always making sure that we were comfortable and didn't need anything. I'll absolutely come back again next time I'm in Seattle. "
1349175,11122897,2014-03-21,3149979,Nadav,"Kyle and his family were wonderful hosts, the room was a bit small for two separate beds but very comfortable, with parking, an amazing view of the bay to wake up to and minutes from downtown. I'd definitely come back!"
1349175,11189062,2014-03-24,5079734,Austin,Kyle has a beautiful and comfortable home. Both he and his wife were exceedingly friendly. Our stay could not have been better. Highly recommended.
1349175,11263721,2014-03-27,11790827,Gary,"Kyle's place was amazing. The view from his deck is priceless and location is superb. He was very accommodating, kind, and gave plenty of recommendations for food and coffee. Can't go wrong. His puppy is very playful as well. "
1349175,11509582,2014-04-06,10115353,Courtney,"Perfect accommodation for my boyfriend and I... clean, cozy and in a great location. Thanks a lot Kyle and Nicole :)"
1349175,11969042,2014-04-20,12883488,Victor,"Kyle and Nicole have a beautiful property in Capitol Hill. 

It's very convenient to use public transport and our room and living area was perfect. Our own access in and out was handy so we didn't have to disturb them upstairs. 

As someone said earlier, you can hear when they walk directly above but it didn't bother us and we were already awake or on the way out.

Thanks Kyle, Nicole, cute little Jack and Zari (the cool dog). Hope to see you again soon."
1349175,12693640,2014-05-08,2649866,Si,Kyle and Nicole couldn't be more accommodating during our stay at their place. Beautiful neighborhood and super convenient to get to any places. Will definitely stay with them again. 
1349175,13195670,2014-05-21,8861678,Kristen,"My husband and I absolutely loved this home away from home! Kyle and his family were away during our stay, so sadly we weren't able to meet them in person. We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, going for runs in Volunteer Park, walking down the Howe steps to see the sun set over the water, taking a Sunday sail at the Center for Wooden Boats, and plenty of other local activities. The room was clean and cozy, the shower was top notch (removable showerheads are wonderful for us tall individuals), and the view from the deck was incredible. An amazing experience!"
1349175,13606370,2014-06-01,4116103,Marissa,"My two friends and I had a fantastic three-day stay here. Kyle was very easy to communicate with prior to our arrival, and everything went smooth checking in. They made us feel very welcome, gave great tips on cool restaurants and views to check out, and were exceptionally accommodating with our check out (late flights). The room itself was simple and clean- everything one needs for a short stay. We appreciated having our own entrance to minimize disturbing Kyle and his family if we came home later. And the view of Lake Union was incredible. We would definitely stay here again!"
1349175,13901381,2014-06-07,4044080,Fritz,A lovely view.. well-furnished room... and phenomenal hospitality!  Kyle & Nicole graciously adjusted their schedules for a last minute stay.  It made my short time in Capitol Hill easy and breezy.
1349175,13918866,2014-06-08,61634,Zhihua (Emma),"Our stay with Kyle was exceptionally great! Kyle is very good at communicating and providing timely help. He allowed us to put our luggages in his place after checking out, which saved us a lot of troubles. The location is very good as well, we have great view of the Lake Union and quick access to a lot of great restaurants. 

I highly recommend staying with Kyle and explore the amazing Capitol Hill area!"
1349175,14101862,2014-06-11,15363070,Sarah,"This was such a wonderful first air bnb experience, and it was wonderful! Kyle and Nicole were such wonderful hosts. The view from the porch must be one of the best in Seattle. Perfect location for a quiet neighborhood with a quick walk to coffee shops and great food on Capitol Hill.  I highly recommend!! "
1349175,14530157,2014-06-21,5382191,Therese,Staying with Kyle and Nicole was a great experience! The bedroom and bathroom are very clean and comfortable and the view from the deck is stellar! The neighborhood is safe and beautiful. Easy access to public transit. Kyle and Nicole are welcoming and wonderfully accommodating. They offered good conversation and plenty of space as well as great local recommendations!
1349175,14624776,2014-06-23,15696205,Andrew,"Beautiful spot in a great neighborhood.  Kyle and Nicole could not have been more hospitable.  As first time users of AirBnB, we were unsure what to expect, but our weekend at the Capizzi's made believers out of us!   I look forward to using AirBnB again in the future.  "
1349175,14752611,2014-06-25,6082034,Zoe & Sam,"Kyle's place was in a beautiful location, very conveniently located to Capitol hill and the bus down the hill will take you to pike place and down town. The room was cosy and the bed was super comfy! We had very limited time there and my boyfriend's family lived in west Seattle so we ended up spending our second night at his grandma's house-wanting to be closer to the family. Wish we had more time to take advantage of the beautiful gardens and running trails next to kyle's place!! Didn't get to meet Kyle but I accidently left a sweater there and Kyle was nice enough to offer to mail it back to me!! Overall pleasant stay and will book again with him."
1349175,15090097,2014-07-02,13456928,Joan,"Kyle and Nicole were gracious and accommodating hosts. Their home is set in a picturesque location, convenient to the center of Capitol Hill and downtown Seattle. We enjoyed both the Streissguth Gardens next door and Volunteer Park right up the hill. The accommodations were comfortable and we enjoyed Kyle’s fresh coffee every morning."
1349175,15462045,2014-07-09,8105145,Nancy,We definitely enjoyed our stay!  The place was clean and conveniently located plus the views were fantastic. We didn't get to meet Kyle but maintained good communication. Thanks Kyle!
1349175,15588999,2014-07-12,615210,AnneMarie And Marc,"Lovely split level home for which we had the bottom floor bedroom and bathroom. It was cool and comfortable. Nicole & Kyle made the arrangements very easy, allowing us to drop off stuff early and pick up stuff later on. Definitely check out Joe Bar, a peaceful and delicious coffee shop a 10 minute walk from the house."
1349175,16214113,2014-07-23,3120386,Amanda,"The perfect place for our first time in Seattle ~ Capitol Hill restaurants, coffee, and shops were only a ten minute walk away. Super comfortable room and amazing views from the porch. We didn't get to meet Kyle but he was great at communicating; he even let us leave our backpacks after we checked out so that we wouldn't have to carry them around. Highly recommended!"
1349175,16364794,2014-07-26,6246446,Alison,"Kyle's home is in the best location you're going to find! It's located in Capitol Hill with stunning views of the lake and the city. And the space is like a mini apartment of it's own.  The downstairs is basically all yours with the exception of a storage room (which is neat and items out of sight) you pass through to get to your space. The bedroom is clean and the bathroom has updated tile and fixtures. We never saw Kyle during our stay due to our busy schedule while in town, but we had great communication via text which made us feel welcome. Stay here! If you are driving it's super close to get off and on the freeway. Parking wasn't an issue. It's on a tight road, but if you are used to driving in the city you shouldn't have a problem. Also, it's just $6 uber ride to awesome bars and restaurants!"
1349175,16544795,2014-07-29,6529305,Kate,The Capitol Hill Oasis was an amazing spot for a fun-filled getaway to Seattle.  The location was perfect for us.  It is close to major bus routes and walking distance to lovely restaurants/shops/theaters in Capitol Hill.  The place is nestled on a side street surrounded by beautiful gardens where you can enjoy your morning beverage and take in the view of Lake Union.  Kyle and his wife are just as amazing.  They were very helpful with recommendations and directions.  I highly recommend this gem and will hopefully visit again in the future.    
1349175,16817292,2014-08-03,9479285,Vanessa,"Kyle and his wife are the perfect hosts: they are so friendly and helpful and their son Jack is just lovely. From the beginning it was absolutely easy to get into contact with Kyle via mail: he immediately answered all the questions we had and even sent us a picture of our private entry door and explained how to get inside our rooms. The accommodation, though not very spacious for four adult people, is very very proper and offers everything you need, from hair dryer to towels and shampoo. The shared kitchen and veranda are just great places to get to know Kyle and his little family and have some great conversation. The view is just stunning and I sent pictures to make my family at home jealous.... The location is perfect to get into downtown by bus which leaves a few hundred meters aside. Volunteer park is within walking distance and is a great possibility to get some rest after a long day in town or for the last day of your stay While waiting for your taxi....The Asian art museum inside the park is worth a visit: it is free on every first Saturday and offers workshops for children and adults. Kyle gave us some great tips of where to have a good breakfast in the neighborhood but also on Broadway there is Starbucks and plenty of other places to eat. We would absolutely recommend this place for a stay and would definitely come back again. Thx, Kyle and all the best for your lovely little family!"
1349175,16976119,2014-08-05,14563885,Yi,"This is our first homestay trying during our travel through airbnb, the exprience is quite happy. The location of Kyle's house is amazing, especially the beautiful view of Capitol  Hill and the lake when we 3 had breakfast around the small white table just beside the window in his warm  sweet kitchen. The room we stayed is quiet and comfortable, the restroom is very clean and we all like the smell of shampoo and bath foam Kyle prepared for us. Transportation to Kyle's house is easy, including driving and bus. We surely would recommend Kyle's house to our friends who have plan travel to Seattle."
1349175,17263715,2014-08-10,10547864,Judith," Kyle and his wife Nichole and their adorable son Jack were great hosts.  The room is downstairs, and very private, with a private bath, and a separate entrance.  We were able to use the kitchen to make breakfast every morning, which was great, and a great view from the kitchen.  They also have a wonderful balcony with great views of Seattle and Lake Union.  We were able to come and go as we pleased, and they were very helpful with suggestions of places, as well as general conversation.  I also really appreciated Kyle's willingness to allow my brother and sister-in-law to spend the night with us, when they missed their flight out of Seattle.  That was definitely above and beyond!  We would love to come back again sometime."
1349175,17507056,2014-08-13,16597477,Wei,"This is my first time to be a airbnb guest. I can say, Kyle's house is very well located and funitured. We can enjoy our stay with fun. Kyle and Nicole helped us (email hidden)commentable surely!"
1349175,17829735,2014-08-18,132685,Lynne,"Kyle and Nicole were just wonderful. Their apartment is perfect and we enjoyed the space, their hosting and the location. They were friendly and shared 2 wonderful restaurant ideas (Serious Pie - a great pizza place downtown and the delightful Volunteer Cafe). I was so happy we stayed at their clean, well organized and wonderful place."
1349175,18028388,2014-08-20,17917297,Jolene,"We really enjoyed staying at this home! The location is great and the deck overlooking the bay is beautiful, just like the photos.  We walked to many places in the area and public transportation was easy to use as well.  We really enjoyed the cozy feel of the home.  We were also lucky enough to walk to the Sunday evening (email hidden). Mark's cathedral which was quite an experience -check it out if you are there on a Sunday.   "
1349175,18414278,2014-08-26,17889980,Barbara,Kyle made us feel right at home.  The sleeping accomodations were very comfortable and he offered us the use of their kitchen and wonderful garden and deck.  What a hidden gem!  Great views near and far and a great location.
1349175,18663882,2014-08-30,8208040,Tracy,"We had an enjoyable stay at Kyle and Nicole's home. They provided everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Everything was clean and the view from the porch was beautiful. We never used the upstairs kitchen area but it was offered to us. It was also nice to have a separate entrance from the laundry area which had a fridge as well for us to store some drinks. The bedroom and bathroom were separated from the laundry area by a door so we had lots of privacy. We had a vehicle with us and it wasn't too difficult to find parking along their street, although evenings were a little tougher but we were still able to find parking a short walk away. It was a short drive to most of the major sites and overall we had a great time in Seattle. We didn't get to meet Nicole, but we did meet Kyle and little Jack who was adorable! Thanks again for welcoming us into your home."
1349175,18878021,2014-09-02,16683487,Chelsey,"Everything was great and Kyle was very hospitable. The place was clean,  quiet, in a great neighbourhood and easy to take transit from. "
1349175,19103685,2014-09-06,13519221,John,Kyle was able to help me in a last minute cancellation and it worked out for the best. Great views with a private room & entrance on capital hill.  Very helpful with suggestions on how to get about and what to see.  Highly recommend. Sometimes things do work out for the best. 
1349175,19208802,2014-09-08,2625596,Sophie,"Kyle was a great host! He made our stay super easy with our baby, the house is very nice and super well located with tons of gardens all around and great view! Thanks again Kyle!"
1349175,19472021,2014-09-13,14867708,Kira,"Thanks Kyle and Nicole was prepare a lot of useful living goods, and recommend a prefect coffee shop!a great host !The house is very nice and super well located with tons of gardens all around and great view! Thanks again Kyle!
"
1349175,19690910,2014-09-16,5050051,Penny/Tony,"Kyle and Nicole were very hospitable and we felt very welcome in their house. 
The suite was very comfy, clean and quiet.
The house is situated in a good neighbourhood for walking .
I would recommend this as a great place to stay in the Capitol Hill area."
1349175,20427737,2014-09-29,13265825,Anna Priscilla,"Kyle and his wife Nicole were wonderful hosts. They made me feel very welcomed, even before I arrived. They invited me and my cousins to a party that they were throwing during our stay at their house, prior to our arrival. We went to the party and felt very welcomed there as well. It was as if we knew them before. 

The house is absolutely beautiful. I took so many pictures of the lake view from the deck. The Airbnb description was very accurate. The room was clean and perfect for our needs. I would love to stay with Kyle and Nicole again and would definitely recommend their place. 

They have a lovely family, great friends, a beautiful home, and a great location. There is so much green and so many flowers all around, I couldn't believe it! If you stay with them, make sure to check out the public garden that is only  couple blocks away from the house.

Kyle and Nicole, thank you so much for sharing your beautiful home with me. I wish you the very best and hope I can come back someday.

Priscilla"
1349175,20557287,2014-10-01,173249,Jeff,"We were delighted to stay at Kyle and Nicole's place. It's tucked away in a tranquil corner of Capitol Hill yet just a few minutes away from the restaurants, bars, coffee shops on Broadway.  Downtown and I-5 are just a few minutes away by car.

Kyle and Nicole were wonderful hosts and made as feel at home. We appreciated making breakfast in their kitchen and watching  knock-out sunsets over Lake Union from their  deck.

If you're looking for a quintessential Seattle experience, we highly recommend Capitol Hill Oasis."
1349175,21278299,2014-10-14,16263730,Cara,We had a great time staying with Kyle and Nicole. The view of the lake was beautiful and the neighborhood was very friendly. The basement felt very private with our own bedroom and bathroom. The bed was also super comfortable! Kyle and Nicole made sure that we had everything we needed for our stay. Five stars! 
1349175,21664919,2014-10-21,69327,Stuart,Great hosts! The room is good value for the excellent location which comes with a breathtaking harbour view and is close to everything in Capital Hill. 
1349175,22025965,2014-10-28,1325478,Martha,"This was our first airbnb stay in the Seattle area.  Kyle, Nicole, Jack and Zari went above and beyond in hosting our stay.  We found our room and bath quite nice and cozy.  Not fancy, but homey and clean, which is our preference.  While we were offered the kitchen and dining area for use we did not need them.
Kyle answered all of our questions and directed us to new experiences in the neighborhood.  A favorite was touring the neighboring gardens.  We also enjoyed the Asian Museum at Volunteer Park and the walk we took on Federal Way to admire the different architectural styles of the homes.
When we arrived we were concerned about parking in this neighborhood but it was never an issue (just as Kyle had assured).  We observed that public transportation was easily accessed, but due to weather conditions drove to distant sites.  Locally we just used an umbrella and strolled to the nearby shops and restaurants.  
Kyle went again beyond expectations when he texted us during a storm to assist with returning to the house.  He thought we had taken the bus to UW game and offered to come get us.  Thankfully we had driven, but we were so honored by his offer.  
Kyle and Nicole are parents to a delightful little boy named Jack, who graciously shared his mom and dad's attention with us and a few of his favorite toys.  Zari (house dog) loved to take advantage of the extra pats and rubs we offered.  
We had a wonderful stay."
1349175,22378598,2014-11-04,923189,Cheryl,"This family proved to be fabulously warm and welcoming.  They even included me in a honey extracting experience!  Meeting and engaging with Kyle, Nicole, Jake, and Zari was a highlight of my journey.

The room was exactly what I needed.  A simple accommodation with my basic needs met.  The bed was super comfy and I enjoyed the private entrance.  All was super clean and tidy.

For those of you who might be light sleepers and wish to sleep in a bit you may benefit from bringing earplugs as once the family is awake above you the pitter patter of feet will surely let you know where everyone is. :-)  This is a slight, slight suggestion. 

For me, the stay was perfect!  "
1349175,22839755,2014-11-16,22393204,Areski,"Great hosts and the experience of the beautiful room and the amazing view on Seattle worth it a thousand times. Thank you Kyle, Nicole and your cute little 2 year old :) "
1349175,22958576,2014-11-18,2758678,Lisa,"We had a wonderful 2-night stay here. Kyle, Nicole, Jake, and Zari were so welcoming and helpful. Super comfortable bed, private bathroom, and great location made our Seattle stay perfect. They even let us do laundry. Our packed scheduled didn't allow us to spend too much time at the house, but we appreciated the warm invitation to socialize if we wanted. Since the room is downstairs, upstairs footsteps and movement are quite audible. But it didn't bother us since we were up early. "
1349175,23180260,2014-11-24,23595713,Phil,"We found Kyle's accommodations clean, private and very comfortable. We particularly enjoyed the location, which let us explore Capitol Hill on foot. There are great restaurants and interesting stores just minutes away. "
1349175,23478309,2014-12-01,24131623,Steven,"Our host was very helpful in making sure we were able to enter their home when they were absent.  An information sheet was valuable in directing us to the nearest coffee shop and walking opportunities. The accommodations were warm and comfortable on a snowy night. The room has a partial view of Lake Union, diminished only by the lovely foliage in their yard.  The kitchen is charming. When we could not find a wine opener, our host went out of his way to get one for us. Their family is engaging. Parking was in short supply, but adequate. "
1349175,24065395,2014-12-18,15581338,Teresa,"Kyle and Nicole's brilliantly located treehouse has the most amazing view, the photos on Airbnb simply do not do justice. Since the room was located in the lower level, we had much privacy, it was almost as if we were renting out a completely separate unit. We ended up extending our stay in Seattle and they accommodated our request without a problem. We miss it already! Thanks for all the hospitality and being amazing hosts, we look forward to another trip to Seattle in the near future."
1349175,24198684,2014-12-22,24467642,Justin,"Well for my very first airbnb experience Kyle, his family, and his home was an awesome starter.  When my friends and I first arrived it was actually a little rough trying to get into contact with Kyle (he was traveling at the time) and we came to his place late into the night so we also had a hard time finding his house, but everything was sorted out soon thereafter.  Kyle's wife Nicole was very very welcoming to us, and once she gave us a tour of the home we were glad we had chosen to stay with them.  Their dog Zari was so sweet, and everything inside the home was clean and well-kept.  Having a separate entrance of our own also made things very convenient because my friends and I were out and about most of the time during our stay.  The one caveat though may be that their floors seemed very thin, and so when Kyle and his family (especially Zari) get up and scurry about at 7am plan on waking up around then as well.  All in all it was a positive experience staying with Kyle and his family, and I can't emphasize how nice they were as hosts (we even flooded the toilet on accident and Nicole washed all of our towels and the bathroom mat without saying a word).  Highly recommended! "
1349175,24280997,2014-12-24,350007,Loren,Easy communication and very helpful.
1349175,24580299,2014-12-31,20172035,Paul,"We thoroughly enjoyed our five days at Kyle and Nicole's Capitol Hill Oasis.  They were both so very warm and welcoming and provided us with very helpful recommendations re: getting around and seeing the sights in Seattle. The accomodations were exactly as described, very clean and comfortable.  The garden and the deck were so enjoyable and the views from the deck were stupendous! the immediate neighborhood is very interesting and enjoyable, with plenty to do and see in the Capitol Hill area.  This is a great location, lovely accomodations and friendly hosts---we highly recommend Kyle and Nicole's place!"
1349175,25107146,2015-01-06,21577415,Elizabeth,I couldn't have imagined a more perfect place for my visit to Seattle.  The location is spot on and the view of Lake Union is spectacular. Thank you Kyle and Nicole for being such wonderful hosts. I will definitely stay here again and recommend to ppl I know!!!
1349175,25283776,2015-01-11,25166313,Prabhjot,"Kyle and Nicole were great hosts! They were very accommodating, the neighborhood was beautiful, and both their son and dog were absolutely adorable! I will definitely plan on staying here again if I plan to come back to Seattle! "
1349175,25506320,2015-01-18,25108436,John,"Kyle and Nicole have provided a really nice ""oasis"" in a great Seattle location. The quiet north Capitol Hill location with easy access to Eastlake and South Lake Union was exactly what I needed for my stay. The separate lower level entrance made coming and going simple and private. The downside was that I didn't get to know Kyle, Nicole, Jack and Zari better. 
Kyle always responded quickly to every message, even from the airport waiting for his flight to board. I had to extend my stay and Kyle accommodated the extra days available. He then sent a quick recommendation for me to another host nearby ensuring another reservation. 
I highly recommend Kyle and Nicole's Oasis and would gladly stay again. "
1349175,26371033,2015-02-10,1502387,Schoneck,"Great space and location. Capitol Hill is a lovely area. Go check out Top Pot for a donut, walk down to the water front and at night wander over to 15th and hit up the Smith for a lovely drink and bit to eat. Thanks a bunch!"
1349175,26749690,2015-02-18,4367464,Woods,"Had a great stay here! The photos accurately represent the listing, although one thing to note is that the beautiful view is primarily from the upper deck (not from the room itself). Kyle was extremely welcoming and made us feel very at home with lots of suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood. The bathroom was fully equipped with amenities, and while we never used the kitchen it looked quite nice. Their is a really nice garden just down the street, and a long set of stairs that are great for running up!

Lake Union is a good neighborhood as it's not far from capitol hill, and also in striking distance from Fremont, Ballard, etc. Perfect if  you're planning on doing a lot of exploring. You do need to do some walking or take a car to get to the nearest coffee shops / bars though, so if you want to be able to walk out the door and be in the thick of things probably not for you. I definitely recommend renting a bike or using the Pronto bike system (there is a station very near this house)."
1349175,27036962,2015-02-23,25890440,Marnie,"This was the best possible place I could have stayed in Capitol Hill. Kyle and Nicole were excellent hosts, they gave us everything we needed to enjoy our stay. The view was truly amazing and it was a short walk to the bus stop. I highly recommend staying here if you plan to visit Seattle."
1349175,27595858,2015-03-08,27339781,Francesca,"We really enjoyed our stay here! Kyle and Nicole were very gracious hosts, accommodating us with everything from their own parking spot to organic fruit. The photos are accurate, the only thing we underestimated was the proximity to the freeway and its noise. The room and bathroom were very clean and cozy and once inside, you don't really hear the freeway anymore. The location is perfect. Very close to any sight seeing as well as nice little cafes and restaurants. 
We will definitively stay here again if we get back to Seattle. "
1349175,27971596,2015-03-15,28996854,Carrie,"Lovely and peaceful location within walking distance of Capitol Hill, Downtown Seattle, etc. Kyle was wonderful.  He met me at the door with his cutie son Jack, made me feel welcome and at home.  Nice private bedroom and bathroom downstairs.  Great place to stay. "
1349175,28129198,2015-03-18,27418717,Russell,"Kyle was a great host for our quick stay in Seattle. We arrived late in the evening due to a day trip on our way up from Portland, and Kyle made sure to be there to greet us. The space was just as described and met all of our needs. 

Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood located near downtown. Jump on a bus or take a pretty easy walk to get to downtown or any other major site that you want to see. Coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants are all nearby. 

Free street parking available so we didn't have to worry about the rental car we had. 

Great stay, great time in Seattle. Until next time.."
1349175,28301738,2015-03-22,25496196,Tracy,"I took my daughter to Seattle for some college visits, and we loved staying with Kyle and his wonderful family - especially his adorable little tyke and their friendly pooch, Zari!  The location is superb -- we loved the views of Lake Union, the historic Streissguth Gardens, the hip energy of Capitol Hill, and the proximity to downtown Seattle (the house is just off I-5, with easy access to everywhere we needed to go).  Kyle was a terrific host - very friendly, easy to work with, and full of wonderful tips, tidbits, and history about the region.  We loved how we were able to walk to so many things from the house - a little sushi place on Lake Union, Streissguth Gardens, Volunteer Park, and an iconic coffee shop in Capitol Hill, Espresso Vivace (at Kyle's recommendation!), for some traditional Seattle latte art.  We feel like we barely scratched the surface of things to do in the Seattle area, so we just have to come back!  We would definitely stay in Kyle's wonderful apartment again!"
1349175,28528101,2015-03-25,6139361,Emily,"Kyle was there to welcome us into his home when we arrived, and gave us a tour of the place. The views were amazing, and the gardens in the neighborhood were beautiful as well. Lots of privacy, and it was very easy to get in touch with Kyle whenever we needed to."
1349175,28675063,2015-03-28,17981444,Luyun,"I stayed at Kyle's place with my wife for two nights.  The place is clean and private.  The location is perfect - next to highway ( it's close to everywhere in Seattle), and we got the great view on deck.  You can easily find the coffee shop and restaurant within 5 minutes drive.
Great place to stay!"
1349175,28949265,2015-04-01,28769687,Pamela,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I feel so fortunate that it was at this property and with this family. I can only echo all the positive things others have said. I would like to emphasize the responsiveness and excellent communication with Kyle. The beauty of the location was just as
pictured. Everything was very clean and comfortable. The only thing I might offer that was not mentioned anywhere, that initially surprised me, was the freeway noise down the hill. However, I quickly realized it was like white noise and I could easily imagine it as the ocean. I found the family to be delightful; friendly and welcoming, though considerate and respectful regarding privacy. I just don't think it gets much better than this!"
1349175,29201412,2015-04-05,21019382,Sammie,"I wish I could give a 10 star review!

Kyle and Nicole were extremely gracious hosts. Their home is located right by the lake, with breathtaking views of the water and Seattle skyline. The neighborhood is very peaceful, and there is a beautiful public garden close to the house. If you like dogs, they have a very friendly dog named Zari. She is absolutely adorable!

Overall, the house is very well-maintained. The room is perfect -- spacious, cozy, and clean. There is a big closet with hangers, extra blankets and linens, a portable heater, and other useful items. The bathroom is spotless and has a heater that is perfect for those who are afraid of the cold. The shower also has great water pressure. Best of all, the bedroom and bathroom are both very private. We basically had the floor to ourselves! The room is accessible through a (pretty much) private entrance. 

The house is in a prime location, with easy access to public transportation. It doesn't take much time to travel anywhere. Whether it was during the day or later at night, we felt quite safe walking around the area. 

Kyle was easy to communicate with and very accommodating. He answered all of our questions and made sure that everything worked out. For example, because we had a later flight, Kyle arranged for us to leave our luggage at the house after check-out so that we could explore Seattle some more before our flight. He and Nicole also prepared a helpful sheet of paper with house rules and tons of recommendations/tips. They made everything so easy and carefree!

Aside from being a great host, Kyle is also very kindhearted. My mom got major motion sickness the night before our flight. Because she was worried that she would get sick again on the bus to the airport, we decided to check-out earlier than planned (to allow for more travel time). When Kyle learned of this, he actually rushed back to the house to meet us. Not only was he so understanding about the whole situation, he actually offered to drive us to the airport. We felt so bad!! Since we still needed last minute gifts, he ended up driving us to Pike Place Market and gave us directions to take the LINK light rail straight to the airport. My mom and I deeply appreciate his kindness and hospitality!!

This is the best Airbnb experience I have ever had. I will definitely be coming back to stay with Kyle and Nicole for my next Seattle trip!"
1349175,29508830,2015-04-08,29156000,Bugra,We had a very nice at Kyles stay. The room was clean and the bathroom too. Kyle and his wife were very friendly. Also the stay was near to the 49 bus. So going downtown is no problem.
1349175,29708666,2015-04-11,5985075,Coleman,"great host with a great house in a great location. Kyle was very proactive in making sure I was good to go after setting my reservation and made sure I was able to get to his house without problems. once there, Kyle was very accommodating and provided a nice rundown of the neighborhood. the house itself is great with amazing views of Lake Union and very conveniently located in Capitol Hill. overall, great experience!"
1349175,30031162,2015-04-16,19005645,Wei,Very cozy and good room with pretty view. Beautiful and convenient neighborhood. Very warm and kind host. We enjoyed living there for a couple of days. They help us a lot. Thanks to them.
1349175,30391146,2015-04-21,24357168,Kazuhiro,"The ideal place to stay in Seattle. The room with nice bed and nice couch was very comfortable to spend time or sleep, clean and totally private. The bath room was also comfortable and clean. Kyle, his wife Nicole, their dog, and their boy were friendly to me and nice. She let me use their detergent when I wash my clothes with their washer. I visited by car and the parking space was not enough wide on the road in front of the room, and sometimes I couldn't park my car in front of the room, but it was easy to find another space on the road not in front of the room. That was very helpful for me. In the day time, in the room, I heard some noises when their kid were playing himself with a ball on the floor above the room, but it made me feel happy and I didn't mind it at all. From the deck, I saw the sun went down behind Olympic Mountains. That was so amazing sight! There were some books and maps about Seattle in the room, it would help other guests. I miss the room and I hope I can stay there again and longer."
1349175,30726859,2015-04-26,419674,Yiting,"We had a lovely time staying at Kyle and Nicole's house.  They have a charming home in North Capitol Hill with great views from the deck.  We had lots of privacy but also greatly enjoyed interacting with Kyle, Nicole and their adorable toddler Jack.  Highly recommended!  "
1349175,30910178,2015-04-28,31762260,Ian,"I had a fantastic time at Kyle's place. It was excellent for one person, cozy and comfortable with easy walking access to Capital Hill restaurants and sights. There's a beautiful huge water tower with sweeping views at the top of the hill.

I arrived early and sat happily in the beautiful garden while I called Kyle for the key box code. I bonked my head on the transom but I'm tall and careless. There were even Epsom salts, deeply appreciated after a long day of walking. Highly recommended!"
1349175,31453315,2015-05-05,21130734,Chelsea,"Fantastic! Kyle's place is absolutely beautiful. Gorgeous gardens all around and the view is fantastic. I highly recommend over a hotel! The roads in his neighborhood are narrow with just a little parking. We only had trouble one night but Kyle let us use his carport. 

The sleeping area was great too. There's a queen size bed and a pullout couch, my friend and I were very comfy. Kyle, his wife, and his son Jack we're great. We saw them the first night to introduce ourselves but not much after, only because we were busy out doing stuff in Seattle. But he had great suggestions about what to do and we took alot of his advice. 

All in all if I go to Seattle again I'd for sure stay with Kyle.  Thanks again!"
1349175,32391763,2015-05-17,32340276,Qing,"Kyle's place is very good for living, it is clean and beautiful. He and his family are nice and friendly, we are happy to live here, it is a wonderful trip in Seattle."
1349175,32621483,2015-05-19,11668180,Jon,"Neighborhood was great.  Place as advertised. By phone agreement with Kyle and his wife, we did not interact too much directly because we both wanted to keep our alpha dogs away from each other."
1349175,32751292,2015-05-21,29696405,Angela,"Kyle and family were wonderful, warm and welcoming. Their space was perfect for us and the view and location were ideal. There is easy access to some local spots of interest and very easy access to public transportation. We rented a car but found we didn't even really need it. The hosts were so friendly and fun. We would highly recommend a stay here!"
1349175,33111744,2015-05-25,7615832,Veronica,Our stay with Kyle and Nicole was great. They are very pleasant hosts who are willing to help with any questions and point you in the right direction if you are looking for local tips. Our stay was very convenient as it was away from the hustle and bustle of the city but close enough to be convenient. We had a great time visiting Seattle. 
1349175,33398068,2015-05-27,12897816,Sam,"I had a lovely time with Kyle and Nicole, everything was as described (and they have very nice shower products). "
1349175,33494496,2015-05-29,20861515,Danielle,"Everything was great with this airbnb. Firstly, the location is amazing and the house and neighborhood are very charming. Going for a walk or run was very pleasant in this beautiful area. The room and bathroom are downstairs and very private. While we didn't meet the hosts because they were out of town, they were extremely proactive and responsive with giving key instructions and leaving information about the place. They have a coffee machine and fridge downstairs for guest use and plenty of closet and drawer space. The space was very clean. Overall, this place was so much better than staying in a hotel and we would definitely stay again and recommend to friends. "
1349175,33736556,2015-05-31,34045241,Alex,"The 'Oasis' was a perfect jump-off point for our adventures in Seattle. The room was cute and breezy, the heart of Capitol Hill was easily walkable, and that view! You can discover a lot of natural beauty a short jog away - Streissguth gardens, Volunteer and Interlaken Parks, and the Arboretum. Whether you're interested in noisy music at Chop Suey, finding a cozy green area to curl up with a book, or a delicious vegan-friendly place to dine, this is the place for you."
1349175,34454076,2015-06-08,30432315,Jonathan,Very nice location. Moderate road noise because of I 5. Beautiful garden  next door down The owners are great folks. 
1349175,34852550,2015-06-13,18342747,Yvonne,Kyle and Nicole were very good hosts and gave us good advises for the city tour. They even shared their coffee when we arrived after a 10 hour flight. We had a seperate entrance to our room and bathroom. Very private :-)
1349175,35089798,2015-06-15,31559709,Rachel,"Kyle made us feel very welcome and gave us excellent information regarding dining, transportation and things to do in the neighborhood.  The view from the deck was even better than anticipated.  What a great vantage point to eat a meal or watch the sunset!"
1349175,35641428,2015-06-21,28684815,Cheng,完全符合房主人的描述，位置还可以，去超市需要开车10分钟左右的路程，我们住的那天在露台看到的落日简直美极了。房间稍微有点小，我们一家3口睡显得有些拥挤。
1349175,36010987,2015-06-24,31186209,Marlene,Great visit and location in the Seattle area. What beautiful views and parks in your city and we loved walking the stairs up and down for dinner at Moss Harbor. Great hosting and comfortable accommodations. Would visit again. Thanks.
1349175,36856071,2015-07-02,3560281,Camilla,Perfect location for our two nights in Seattle. The hosts at were very nice and gave us good advice on our further trip. The most fantastic view from the deck that balanced out the noise from the highway.
1349175,37154582,2015-07-05,31382325,Cory,"Kyle was a great host, and my girls loved the company of the dog! We enjoyed the wonderful views from the deck and especially treasure eating breakfast overlooking lake Union.

 Kyle's place is super for getting around town easily. Bus 49 runs directly to the downtown transit center where you can catch buses anywhere in the city and bus 70 skirts around lake Union for easy access to ""the center for wooden boats"" where you can take a free sailboat ride every Sunday and catch.  Another great treat is a flight around the city on ""Kenmore Air"" 

Thank you Kyle for a memorable time!
Cory, Melanie, Savannah and Staszia"
1349175,37485875,2015-07-07,18984251,Chris,"Kyle was out of town, but he made himself available by phone. All the directions were clear and the entry was secure and easy.  The room and bath were very nice and in pristine condition.   "
1349175,37839758,2015-07-11,29963693,Micca,"Enjoyed the stay. Great view! Comfortable bed, cool clean and neat room even in the dead of summer. Very accommodating. "
1349175,38369354,2015-07-15,9502332,Anne,"We spent a great time in Capitol Hill Oasis. Kyle had planned everything to make our stay comfortable and easy. The appartment is great, with a wonderful view from the deck, a lovely garden, and everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. The location is great too, very near the living neighbourhood of capitol hill and all the good restaurants and nice places to shop. We had a very pleasant day in Seattle."
1349175,38730680,2015-07-18,8981052,Claus,"Good room with awesome view from terrace. The host was nice and very flexible. ~7$ with uber to downtown, ~45$ with uber to the airport.  "
1349175,39002010,2015-07-20,6660298,Martin,"Thanks to Kyle and Nicole for making us so welcome.  Would really recommend the suite for anyone staying in Seattle.  Located I Capital Hill it was nice and quick into town. Loved the deck, and the view of sunset was awesome.  Only thing to be aware of is that the home is above the Interstate 5, and as such there is a fair bit of road noise.  Ear plugs essential for the light sleeper.  Will certainly stay again the next time we are down.

Thanks
Martin and Jules"
1349175,39378159,2015-07-23,31904977,Isabel,"The hosts were very kind and gave us a lot of good advice about local places. Definetly reccomend Jamjuri (thai restaurant). The room was a bit smaller than it seemed in the pictures, but was otherwise great. The area was lovely and the house has a beautiful view. We only had  slight problen with parking on one of the days, otherwise it was easy to find street parking. Would definetely recommend this place."
1349175,39759701,2015-07-26,4166860,Marianna,"Kyle was very nice and helpful, really appreciated everything he told us. Super reliable and easy to communicate with. It was clear they took this seriously and made sure the room and bathroom were clean prior to our arrival. The only thing is that it was hard to sleep in because the floors and walls are thin so we could hear the dog and footsteps above us. We did love having a separate entrance though! "
1349175,40088374,2015-07-28,4462494,Blaire,Kyle and Nicole were amazing hosts! I thought that we really guests in their home. I appreciated the time they took to show us around the place and also to talk about life in Seattle. I felt like a local for the weekend! Thank you for your hospitality!
1349175,40430358,2015-07-31,13618228,今莹,"Kyle is really nice guy,and their rooms got nice position in (email hidden)e view is wonderful,especially the sunset. "
1349175,40931591,2015-08-03,35919242,Carol,"Great location to get anywhere in Seattle! Kyle was very friendly and it was like staying overnight at a friend's house. The room was downstairs - it was small when we used the pull out couch for my 2 daughters, but no need to spend any time in the room except to sleep. We were grateful to find a room that would hold 4 of us. The upstairs deck overlooking the Lake was very nice and a good place to sit while the others were getting ready in the morning."
1349175,41314331,2015-08-07,28539620,Adriana,"First than anything the view is magnificent. 
The place has a great location, close to the freeway, close to the bus stop, to many shops and restaurants but still in a nice quit street. 
Kyle and Nicole were very friendly and helpful and the cherry on top is their little son Jack. 
The room is big enough for 4 people and its very private. We felt welcome and at ease. 
We highly recommend this place for couples and families."
1349175,41930715,2015-08-10,30984418,Eric,"Very comfortable and warm home in a quiet neighborhood with a fantastic view. Kyle was very accommodating and made every effort to tend to our needs. We were able to use and enjoy the premises with a lot of freedom. The wifi is also very fast and reliable which was an important aspect of our stay. Interior was very clean and the sleeping quarters were more than adequate, our group had a good nights sleep each day of our stay. There was another group staying at the house and though we had little interaction with one another, I would have appreciated a locked door to keep our areas separate and provide a bit more peace of mind. I would definitely stay here again and would definitely recommend this home and host in the future. Thanks once again!"
1349175,43223184,2015-08-18,32854684,Kari,"Kyle texted and emailed plenty prior to our arrival.  He gave great directions to the house, which admittedly isn't easy to find the very first time (easy from then on).  He was up late the night we arrived, which was great and made us feel welcomed.  He showed us the house, gave us some great tips of places to go, and made us feel like his home was our home.  The place was clean, nice bathroom, awesome deck to hang out on, and an amazing view.  Great location for LOCAL bars, restaurants, and view of the city/bay.  Strongly suggest future guests go down a few blocks to the local businesses.  About a $8-10 cab ride to downtown from the Airbnb.  "
1349175,43608052,2015-08-21,14760868,Moritz,"Zuallererst war der Ausblick mehr als super. Die Bucht im Blick kann man auf der Terrasse frühstücken und das Bild genießen. Die Umgebung ist ebenfalls wunderbar, viele kleine Häuser, viel Grün und eine gute Anbindung. Kyle und Nicole waren sehr hilfsbereit und haben uns mit allen nötigen Infos versorgt. Das Zimmer ist für 4 Personen ausreichend groß, lediglich die Autobahn ist etwas laut. Alles in allem also eine wirklich zu empfehlenden Unterkunft."
1349175,44071364,2015-08-23,18293547,Rebecca,"Kyle was a super attentive and hospitable host! His listing was a great home base for cruising around Seattle - clean, comfortable, and within walking distance of tons of fun restaurants and bars. We enjoyed drinking coffee on the porch in the morning and taking in the beautiful panoramic view of Lake Union. I'd feel lucky to stay here again!"
1349175,44300860,2015-08-25,12448092,Katerina,"Great location, great views from the deck and private room with bathroom on the ground level. We had a pleasant stay and will come back again. Thanks, Kyle! "
1349175,45244665,2015-09-01,31439477,Deb,"Kyle was great and made us feel very welcome. His place is very central and has a killer view from the deck. The area available to us was clean and spacious and it was such a noon to have access to laundry facilities after travelling for a few days.
On the downside, if you are not very mobile or have trouble with stairs then this is not the place for you.
On a positive note it was a short stroll to the suburb of Capitol Hill where we found a wide variety of places to eat."
1349175,45479206,2015-09-03,38456908,Qiming,"It's definitely a great experience staying in this house. The bathroom is good，the bed is good，the washing machine is good，the kitchen is good，and the most important is that the host is good！BTW, the host has a very lovely dog.
The scene around the house is just like a garden. The neighborhood is really kind. There lots of details I can't list one by one... anyway , next time we travel in Seattle ，we will stay there for sure"
1349175,45830549,2015-09-06,40980099,Yurie,"We had very great time to stay Kyle's house!!!
I and my Japanese friends stayed there for 3 days.
His family welcomed us and were so kind and friendly!!!
And then, they had so clean and comfortable room, bet, sofa and bathroom, also very beautiful scenery ;)
The location is very convenient to close to Seattle downtown.
In addition, his sun was very cute, so we were healed by him♡
Anyway, we were very happy and satisfied with staying Kyle's house.
If I stay in Seattle again, I want to stay there!!!!
Thank you for your kind, Kyle and your family :)
"
1349175,46273822,2015-09-09,36307191,Carmen,"I wanted to stay in a home in Seattle that is not too far from downtown but is still representing the ""locals"" instead of tourists. 
Capitol Hill was just great! Super close to beautiful Lake Union as well as the vibrant Broadway with all its shops and restaurants.

Kyle and Nicole were super nice and caring hosts. They gave my siblings and me plenty of information - already in advance! With the directions we were able to find their home easily - even at night!
Over all we were very happy with our room, the bathroom and the use of their kitchen (bowls, silverware etc.). 
Fortunately our hosts were also very social and helped us a lot finding transfer to the airport. Thanks!

The only thing that might bother ""sleepings princesses"" is that even with windows closed you still can hear the noice of the highway/interstate that is relatively close to the house.

Thank you Kyle for this nice stay :) !

The room + bathroom is cozy, and there are nice touches like toiletries and fridge space that are helpful while traveling. Would stay again!"
1349175,47638501,2015-09-21,35978831,Fernando,"We (my wife, 16 month old toddler and I) had a great stay at Kyle's. Very nice place and got exactly what was offered in the listing. Stayin there was part of our great trip to Seattle. At first we thought we were a little far, but after a couple of days we realized we were in a great spot close enough to everything."
1349175,47988541,2015-09-22,6385648,Monica,"Kyles place was totally charming, like a treehouse overlooking the lake. The neighborhood is an easy nice walk filled with beautiful homes and architecture,a local run garden and lush tree lined streets, Capitol Hill shops and restaurants and a beautiful view with Mt. Rainier in the distance. Kyle was accommodating and helpful and the space was clean and cozy. Thanks for an awesome stay!"
1349175,48195534,2015-09-24,14089981,Julie Jia-Fen,"The room is comfortable and beautiful, decorated with flowers. We have our own bathroom and can easily access to the kitchen. Definitely recommend the place! "

It was a clean and spacious basement bed and bath.  I did not spend much time there except to sleep.  But I felt safe coming in alone after dark. Lovely park down the street, not to be missed!  Thank you Kyle and Nicole.

1349175,49432418,2015-10-04,29024734,Alex,"The AirBNB is located in a cool, active neighborhood, while still feeling residential. Although you'll want to spend most of your time out-and-about, I recommend getting a view of the sunset from the deck. It's excellent!

Kyle was incredibly responsive and helped make our visit to Seattle smooth. He also had great recommendations for our travels outside the city."
1349175,49895796,2015-10-07,41872158,Steven,"Kyle and his family were great hosts. He was very flexible about check-in times and made every effort to be accommodating. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was clean and fully stocked, and the room was spacious. The view was just as amazing as described, and we almost wished we had a less busy schedule so we could have sat on the deck to enjoy it more. They offered great hiking advice and even let us borrow some water bottles that we forgot to pack. Also they have the friendliest, sweetest dog."
1349175,50533203,2015-10-12,22992822,Jason,"The pictures don't lie, that is the view you get. I love the neighborhood and there is so much to do within a $6 Uber ride. Kyle is a great and helpful host, but isn't at all intrusive if you want your space. Would happily stay here again."
1349175,50932761,2015-10-16,42086842,Rachel,"Staying at Kyle's beautiful home during our trip to Seattle was one of the highlights. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable (very soft sheets and lots of extra blankets), and the bathroom was lovely. The stay exceeded our expectations. My husband and I had more than enough space and privacy. Kyle and his family were friendly and gracious hosts, and generously shared their kitchen space with us. Kyle responded to any inquiry almost instantly, and he was incredibly flexible with our travel plans during our stay. The view from his deck is absolutely breathtaking, and there are plenty of city views around the property. It's a great location in relation to downtown and attractions - We used Uber and had no issues. I really can't say enough wonderful things (did I mention the soft blankets and great bed?!), and I would definitely stay at Kyle's beautiful Oasis again."
1349175,51214318,2015-10-18,46074744,Deepika,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and my husband and I loved it! We booked with Kyle just a few days before our trip to Seattle and got super lucky! Their house is just a 15 min walk from Capitol Hill that has many great bars and restaurants. It's also near the bus 49 route, so we were conveniently able to take the bus to Seattle center as well as downtown Seattle, whenever we wanted. The room itself was really cozy with comfy bed and the bathroom was very clean. They also provided us with toiletries as well as towels, which we weren't really expecting. The views from the deck were beautiful and the neighborhood in general is great!  
We didn't get a chance to meet Kyle, but interacted quite a bit with Nicole and their sweet dog. Nicole was super helpful with her recommendations of places to visit. I would definitely stay here again, if we come back to Seattle! "
1349175,51534800,2015-10-21,42075677,Branden,Timely communication from Kyle. Hospitality was as described and very welcoming into the home. Capitol Hill neighborhood was the best location I could have asked for to see the city by bike! An absolute must if staying in Seattle!
1349175,52219849,2015-10-27,9849443,Andy,"This was a cozy room with a private bathroom. The bedroom and the bathroom were clean. Even though the space we had was not completely private, we did not have the chance to interact with Kyle's family due to our full schedule running around Seattle. We had everything we needed during the stay. "
1349175,52543179,2015-10-30,2488379,Rebecca,"Kyle's communications were excellent and speedy, and he was helpful and accommodating about our arrival time. The neighborhood is lovely with sweeping views of the lake, plus the very special public garden to wander around in which is right next door. The room was cozy, and the bathroom very clean and well-stocked. Although it was a bit chilly and rainy for spending time on the deck, we did enjoy sitting in the breakfast nook, which feels like being in a treehouse, to enjoy the view and even to do a bit of bird-watching. We appreciated having use of the kitchen. Kyle, Nicole, son Jack and their sweet dog were welcoming and friendly. We had a nice time chatting, but we also had our own private space. Altogether a very nice Airbnb experience!"
1349175,52861904,2015-11-02,1325478,Martha,"This was a return visit for us to Capitol Hill Oasis.  Kyle and family's hospitality is so appreciated.  We always have felt very comfortable in their home and appreciate the accommodations they provide.  They go above and beyond to make your stay comfortable.  The recommendations Kyle provides in answer to questions about the area are always right on the money.  
"
1349175,53598506,2015-11-10,42875767,Michelle,"Kyle and his wife Nicole were very accommodating during our stay at their home, which was very clean and tidy. We were especially surprised by the hotel-like appearance of the room and the bathroom. The price for the room and the location is more than fair, considering most of everything worth seeing is within 10-15 minutes by bus. The view from the porch at the home is absolutely breathtaking, and even more so during a sunny day. Nicole and Kyle helped us out a lot during our stay with everything from where to go, to how to store fish in our carry-on for our flight (long story there)! I really felt that they were great people who genuinely cared about my experience there, which was evident through how well the room was maintained. If any of my friends were going to Seattle I would recommend this location ten out of ten times. Plus, they have a really cute and friendly dog to play with!"
1349175,54101320,2015-11-16,20540463,Yang,"Kyle's place was absolutely wonderful - clean, private, convenient and cozy. Great location and beautiful neighborhood. Would definitely recommend to friends traveling to nearby areas."
1349175,54310364,2015-11-18,41079640,Gintare,"This was  a very positive experience! The room is as described, clean, cozy and well equipped, with a  beautiful view. Kyle and Nicole are very welcoming and helpful hosts. Prompt communication with Kyle is very much appreciated. I would definitely recommed it."
1349175,54665004,2015-11-22,49134698,Rocio,"Kyle and Nichole were very nice and very helpful. And even though we didn't get a chance to interact a lot with them, the little bit we saw them really made us feel comfortable and almost as if we had known them from before. Their 3-year old son was very polite and cute. Their dog was also super friendly."
1349175,56271586,2015-12-11,22992822,Jason,"This was my second stay here, so I think that speaks for itself. "
1349175,56513285,2015-12-14,49041924,Susanna,"Listing description was fairly accurate. Kyle and Nicole were also extremely friendly, and the dog was a wonderful bonus! 

If sleeping in, creaky floorboards might be a disturbance, and because we had four guests, we utilized the sofa bed, which was pretty worn down - creaky and able to feel the springs as well (what you expect from a sofa bed though). However, the temperature of the home was kept perfect throughout the day, the sheets, towels, and sheets felt clean, and amenities in the restroom were a plus. Overall a wonderfully convenient location, super central to everything, and truly a cozy oasis for what you pay for.  

Would definitely return again! Thank you for the warm hosting!"
1349175,57334965,2015-12-24,50616307,Ruolin,"Our stay with Kyle and Nicole was awesome! We arrived quite late for the day we reserve, but Kyle sent me the access information in advance so that we got in as soon as we arrived. We feel really welcomed by Kyle, Nicole, Jack (their son) and Zori (their dog)--they really spent time talking to us, telling us about their life, the community around and the city. It is a pleasure to know about them in person and that's a great part of Airbnb experience. The private bathroom was really clean and our bedroom was definitely large enough for three of us. Great view from the window and interesting experience to live in a wooden house, yet still enjoying all that technology brings. We mainly went by Uber and it was pretty convenient (about 10 to 20min to Pike Place Market). I took sometime in the early morning to explore the public garden nearby--definitely recommended!"
1349175,57780479,2015-12-29,13872005,Andrea,"Loved staying here!  The house was absolutely gorgeous, with lots of greenery, and very warm and welcoming.  Kyle had a nice large room set aside for us, with out own bathroom, and welcomed us to make use of the kitchen upstairs.  He made us feel very comfortable in his home, and treated us very nicely.  

The house is also very close to bus routes that go into Capitol Hill and further downtown, it was so easy to get around.  Would definitely stay here again, thanks a bunch!"
1349175,58205337,2016-01-01,984753,Lindsay,We had a lovely stay at Kyle and Nicole's house. The accommodations were simple (in a good way) and private. The view was pretty stellar. We didn't get to meet Kyle but Nicole was very kind and helpful with helping us find cool restaurants/bars in the neighborhood. They neighborhood itself was amazing as well. Beautiful houses and a fair amount of stuff within a 15-20 min walk. We would definitely stay with them again. 
1566487,6863126,2013-08-27,3462691,Rebecca,"Rodrigo's apartment was amazing! Getting to stay in such an awesome place was a highlight of the trip. His apartment is so well decorated and hip (and super clean!) it was like staying in a fancy boutique hotel. Short drive to fun neighborhoods, but a nice quiet place to come back to after a long day of touring Seattle and super easy parking right out front. Will definitely recommend to all my friends! "
1566487,6950336,2013-08-31,7994899,Lukas,Great time!
1566487,7003595,2013-09-02,3586462,Joshua,"Rodrigo's place is great!  It's very spacious with a good sized kitchen packed with snacks for guests.  His place is situated in a good location between Lake Washington and downtown as well as Capitol Hill.  You can also use Rodrigo's bike, which was a relaxing way to see Seattle."
1566487,7207025,2013-09-10,2554611,Justin,"Rodrigo's apartment was exactly what we were looking for during our trip to the Northwest. The apartment was clean, well stocked, and conveniently located.  The Blendtec blender was a huge plus.  I would definitely recommend this place to others. "
1566487,7498090,2013-09-22,2919895,Harry,Very clean & modern unit. There was always plenty of parking directly in front of the unit. Rodrigo was friendly & very gracious. 
1566487,7750592,2013-10-01,7302560,Colin,"I was in Seattle for ten days with my fiance, 6 days being a tourist, and 4 days doing some restaurant work around. For this, Rodrigo's place is certainly a gem. It is everything he promised it to  be: CLEAN, so clean, modern, charming, stylish, well decorated with not too many personal affects around, making it truly feel like your own place. As for things he did have, everything you would need to cook, do laundry, get around, perfectly stocked with all the necessities of everyday living.  In addition to all of this, the location was great, 10-15 minutes to Pike Public Market by bus (with two options of bus), 10 minutes to China town (I recommend checking out the Asian markets) and a short 5 minute walk to a grocery store and a few fast food outlets, in case you're a bit exhausted and just want to grab some quick tacos and get back to your favorite show on Netflix.  As well, you can get to the light rail on either the 14 or 27 bus in about 10 minutes, which will then take you straight to SeaTac for about $3 in 30 minutes. As far as Rodrigo himself, we did not meet in person, but had a few contacts over the phone and it was very obvious he knew what he is doing and was very pleasant and helpful. Would definitely stay here again, for the price and accommodations received, this place was essentially perfect. Thank you Rodrigo."
1566487,7893107,2013-10-07,377964,Nikolaus,"Very nice apartment in a quiet neighborhood. We had no issues at all and even found the refrigerator fully stocked. While we did not meet Rodrigo he was always very responsive and answered messages literally within seconds. Great Host!

Expect something like 30 minutes bus transit into downtown. I wouldn't recommend walking as it takes the same time and some street towards downtown are quit steep."
1566487,8376589,2013-10-28,2610881,Tom,"We stayed here for two weeks. Apartment was great, super clean, wonderfully designed/curated stuff, and in a good location for us.

If I'm ever back in Seattle, I'll almost definitely come back here."
1566487,8604328,2013-11-07,9639864,Seth,"5 stars. Everything was as promissed. Clean and stytlish apartment. Plenty of privacy, nice view from balcony. Rodrigo was very helpful host. Great proximity to downtown. We walked nearly everywhere (by choice of course)."
1566487,8733720,2013-11-14,7264400,Ryan,"Rodrigo's place was amazing, and he was such a great host.  He gave us all the info we needed up front, responded promptly to messages, and the place itself was very clean and fun to stay at!"
1566487,8761897,2013-11-16,2578323,Darrin,Rodrigo's place was great and just what we needed. It was very clean and he was a pleasure to deal with!
1566487,8906677,2013-11-25,431664,Aris,"My wife and I stayed at Rodrigo's flat for a week and had a great time. It's very bright, clean, comfortable and spacious one-bed flat with all the necessary equipment and kitchen appliances. The area is very well served with Metro bus services to downtown and Capitol hill (15min), and other neighbourhoods. Rodrigo is a great host  - very friendly, helpful and flexible with check-in and check- out times. We highly recommend staying at his place. 
Aris & Ieva"
1566487,9359400,2013-12-23,5242690,Rebecca & Lance,"Rodrigo's apartment was very clean and comfortable, and he was an excellent host! Easy to get ahold of and friendly. We would definitely recommend his place!"
1566487,9554016,2014-01-02,5722969,An,"POSITIVE: 
-Place was incredibly clean 
-Rodrigo was extremely responsive
-Easy to access, easy for cabs to find

NEGATIVE: 
-This might be an AirBNB error but I am deducting stars for this. Rodrigo's apartment on the map is stating that his apartment is on 15th and Spring, which IS walking distance to the main 12th Street of Capitol Hill bars/restaurants. However, I was extremely disappointed to find out that the apartment is ACTUALLY 1.3 miles/20+ blocks away from the spot on the map, making it not really walking distance in the evening to and from the 12th street hub so I had to spend money on 2-3 cabs per evening to get around. I would say that this apartment is in the Central District and not actually in Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle. 
-The temperature had to be played around with often because without heat, it was too cold and if the heat is on too often, it gets too hot. "
1566487,9845115,2014-01-13,11075284,Rob,"Rodrigo was a great host & his place was exactly as advertised.  My father and I stayed this past weekend and I slept on his air mattress in the living room while my Dad took the bedroom.

I'd add that there is plenty of street parking if you have a car, as we rented one for our trip to Seattle."
1566487,10089406,2014-01-30,1698192,Bodo,"We really loved to stay at Rodrigo's apartment, it's a great place to stay in Seattle. Rodigro is a great host and we can recomend his nice apartment very high!"
1566487,10220983,2014-02-07,6537352,Lauren,We stayed at Rodrigo's place for 6 days and really enjoyed it. The apartment was as advertised and very clean. The location is very good. We didn't walk anywhere due to the unusually cold weather but there were a lot of cool restaurants in short driving distance. Overall a great experience. Would definitely stay there again! Highly recommend!
1566487,10281294,2014-02-10,3086913,Janna,"We had a great stay at Rodrigo's place.  The apartment was immaculately clean and nicely decorated.  The refrigerator was well-stocked with goodies and beverages that could be purchased - and we did! Parking was easy, as well as the key exchange.  The only negative thing that I could say about the experience (which I read from the reviews of other's now) is that the pin on the map for the apartment's location is different than its actual physical address.  This meant that we were farther from down town than we would have liked.  That said, we did walk downtown and it only took around 30 minutes. I would suggest changing the pin just so there are no surprises.  Other than that, Rodrigo's place was very hospitable and accommodating! "
1566487,10403283,2014-02-17,4037226,Alison,My husband and I had a great experience staying in Rodrigo's apartment during our stay in Seattle.  Rodrigo was attentive and responded to all of our questions quickly.  His place was very clean and well maintained.  He even had snacks available for purchase!  There was plenty of free street parking too.  We would certainly stay with Rodrigo again if we were ever in need of accommodations in Seattle!
1566487,10675625,2014-03-03,5416169,Ann,"Very clean apartment, lots of amenities, super quiet neighborhood, comfy bed, SUPER easy bus access, walking distance from supermarket. We discovered on the first day of our visit that we needed a spare key and Rodrigo was quick to supply one. He made it easy. "
1566487,10815236,2014-03-09,11279570,Kathleen,"The apartment was in a great location! only several miles from Chinatown and Pike's Place. It was very centrally located and convenient. The place was spotless when I arrived and had everything that I needed for a 3 days stay. The owner even gave us a carton of orange juice. His fridge was also stocked with water, and food some that was available for purchase, kind of like a mini-bar in hotels. Reasons for only 4 stars is because it was located on the 3rd floor with no elevator, no reserved parking, and because it seemed like the owner lives in the apartment on a full time basis. His clothing filled up the entire closet, and personal items were also in the laundry room, and bathroom. Also, the bed was very firm for my liking."
1566487,11227624,2014-03-25,12305337,Elizabeth,Rodrigo's apartment is very comfortable and adorably decorated. Extremely tasteful and chic. He was a helpful and communicative host. There is also a cute coffeeshop just a two block walk from the apartment where we got breakfast several times. I would certainly recommend that anyone looking for comfortable and well-located place in Seattle stay at Rodrigo's!
1566487,11521975,2014-04-06,13006643,Zach,Great accommodations with everything we needed! Didn't anticipate spending too much time at the apartment but felt comfortable and ended up hanging out more than expected. Rodrigo communicated well and helped us to a streamlined trip. Thanks Rodrigo! Recommended. 
1566487,11784738,2014-04-14,2339312,Airick," Very nice and clean flat, are seemed safe, Walking distance to a few shops and a couple cafes. About a mile walk/drive to the hip and nightlife area of Madison, Pike and Pine streets. Communication with Rodrigo was excellent and access to the flat was easy for us even though we came in late at night.

1566487,12122317,2014-04-23,13054940,Anne,"It has been such a great pleasure to stay at Rodrigo's place, the apt was very clean and confortable, well situated and calm! Rodrigo always answered any questions at any time and we really found everything we needed! highly recomended! would definitly go back there anytime!"
1566487,12170686,2014-04-24,48384,Katy,"Rodrigo was super easy to communicate with and responded to my questions quickly. Super clean, comfy place. LOVE the bed and pillows! Lovely decor, pleasant view, and the location was great for us. Broadcast Coffee nearby--a great spot! Recommend!"
1566487,12345716,2014-04-29,552512,Alexander,"Rodrigo's space is amazingly clean, functional, and well appointed with everything you need for a great stay. Parking out front is free and convenient and the apartment is very close to downtown and many great neighborhoods. As a host, Rodrigo was very quick to communicate, respond, and make sure we had everything we needed. "
1566487,13311151,2014-05-25,13231236,Lily,"Rodrigo was an excellent host. He responded quickly, his apartment had everything you would need if you are visiting seattle for the first time and what you see in the photos is what you get! "

But There was Only One thing that I unsatisfied with. Location of Rodrigo's apartment on the map is different from its actual physical address. I was very panic that I had realized this difference. (check carefully!)


"
1566487,13856866,2014-06-06,15117782,Stephan,"The apartment is exactly as listed, quiet area yet central enough
Ridrigo was very responsive and helpfull
Would I stay there again, yes I for sure would!"
1566487,14121779,2014-06-12,8630600,Kenny,"Most of these other reviews are spot on. Rodrigo's apartment is  a m a z i n g l y  clean, calm, and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. His decorations are modern, simple, and tasteful. Parking out on the street in front is free and effortless. Access to the apartment building was uncomplicated, even in the late hours. The apartment is very close to downtown and it's adjacent communities with lots to choose for dining and entertainment. he park directly behind the building offers a pleasant view from the balcony. Rodrigo was swift to communicate and easily available for anything we needed."
1566487,14435745,2014-06-19,6334601,Jonny,"Apartment was clean and exactly as described. Very comfortable for me and my friends. Rodrigo has some snacks and drinks available for purchase.

Only downside was that the internet was really slow, but that forced the person that was supposed to do some work on our vacation to actually come and hang out with us all day, so maybe that goes in the Pros column?"
1566487,14613606,2014-06-23,10801104,Skye,"I would absolutely recommend anyone to stay at Rodrigo's place, it exceeded our expectations. Fantastic location and Rodrigo's apartment had every detail taken care of, it was extremely clean and Rodrigo was a fantastic communicator, even when we had trouble making contact! We hope to stay again :)"
1566487,14841791,2014-06-27,6393874,Patricia,"Rodrigo was a great host - friendly, easy to contact and quick to respond to all our questions and requests.  The apartment is as advertised: cool and stylish, super clean and comfortable, well equipped kitchen, great balcony and grill.  The  neighborhood is quiet and there is nice green space out back.  There are not many shops/cafes/bars nearby, but it is an easy walk into downtown neighborhoods.  I definitely recommend and would stay again. "
1566487,14909961,2014-06-29,6056674,Brooke,"A beautiful, clean apartment. The accommodations we cozy, and working with Rodrigo was a breeze. He provided information quickly, and was polite and friendly. We also had a car, and were happy to see parking was convenient, easy and free. "
1566487,15264915,2014-07-06,15368887,Tamra,We really enjoyed our stay and experience with Airbnb.  This was the first time that we used it and we definitely will use it again.  Rodrigo's place is centrally located and an easy walk to downtown.    We arrived early to Seattle and Rodrigo was very accomodating and let us check in earlier.  Rodrigo was responsive to all our questions/concerns.  
1566487,15427151,2014-07-08,17211002,Kevin,"Rodrigo's place was the perfect fit for my wife and I as we visited friends for a few days in Seattle. It's exactly as pictured; minimal, modern, clean, with some very cute and/or cool details.

The central location is ideal for getting most anywhere in Seattle in a few short minutes. There are transit options but having a car would help a lot from here. If you've never been to Seattle and have no connection to the city, perhaps you are better off in a hotel in another neighborhood. If you want to feel like you LIVE in Seattle (if only for a few days) this place is perfect!

Plenty of street parking. No hassle with key exchange. Good to go.
"
1566487,15549757,2014-07-11,10640853,Eunhyung,"I stayed at Rodrigo's apartment two nights with my family. It was great time because the apartment was neat, clean, and well equipped. We felt that we were really at home with relaxing mood as well as convenient facilities. Fantastic!! Thank you, Rodrigo!!"
1566487,15757407,2014-07-15,12619413,Sandy,"Fabulous location. We were 10-20 minutes from everything we wanted to do. Plenty of parking, quiet, CLEAN, and very comfortable.

The location is great, we were able to get to where we needed in 5-10 minutes. Rodrigo is very professional in handling everything and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone traveling to Seattle."
1566487,16309410,2014-07-25,16316577,Jaroslaw,"Good location, everything you need is available within 5 minutes walk. Not far from the center. The apartment is well equipped, nicely designed and perfectly clean. Rodrigo was ready to help any time?"
1566487,16401552,2014-07-27,15403666,Scott,"Never met Rodrigo in person -- we communicated via email / text, which worked for me.  Seems to be a very friendly guy.  Very helpful / quick to reply to texts.  Place was clean, immaculately / artistically designed.  Perfect for 1-2 people.   Quiet neighborhood with easy street parking.  Not far from Capitol Hill and downtown.  Recommended."
1566487,16771538,2014-08-02,14150281,Jim,"The apartment was pristine. Very, very clean and well taken care of. It was evident that Rodrigo was a perfectionist. It had a very nice feel and I loved the balcony overlooking the park. Rodrigo was very responsive."
1566487,16988078,2014-08-05,16837838,Desiree,"Rodrigo was very quick to reply to messages and provided all necessary information prior to our visit.  The apt was clean and very organized.  The location was conveniently close to bus lines, and the cab rides we took to downtown Seattle were surprisingly inexpensive.  WiFi worked great.  A/C was perfect for the heat wave we experienced.  As a first time AirBnB Experience, it's the best I could have hoped for. Thanks!"
1566487,17169944,2014-08-08,13232495,Alex,"The space was very clean and inviting - and the location was perfect.  My cab ride from Broadway and Pine was less than $10!

Would recommend the space to any of my friends traveling to Seattle."
1566487,17343095,2014-08-11,13886698,Tiernan,"This was a clean, top-quality space in a fairly convenient location. Downtown and the Capitol Hill areas were generally a fair hike away, but cabs were cheap when we were too tired to walk. The neighborhood had a nice independent coffee shop and a Walgreens very close. And Rodrigo's initial text sent at check-in time answered any question we might have had."
1566487,17580607,2014-08-14,11813062,Emma,"Awesome host and amazing apartment! Very swish but minimalistic! Style right up our street. Great location. Wish we could have spent longer here. Balcony very cute. Shame
We didn't get to utilise the bbq. Rodrigo was brilliant in answering any questions and was a phone call away if we needed any help. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks so much. E & K  "
1566487,17995493,2014-08-20,3949224,Julia,"This flat is just gorgeous! We felt at home just at the time we arrived! Extremely comfy so we did not want to leave.
Rodrigo was very helpful giving us hints where to go and what to do and see - I definitely recommend this place."
1566487,18131929,2014-08-22,18657409,Jackie,"Rodrigo was great and was easy to communicate with.   His apartment was super clean and was just like the pictures.   Rodrigo even included small touches to make it feel like a hotel.   Even though I might choose to stay in a different neighborhood next time I'm in Seattle, this is a good option if you are looking for a deal, aren't traveling with small kids, and don't mind some stairs. "
1566487,18417028,2014-08-26,18145743,Lina,"The Appartment was clean and comfortable. It reflects the pictures posted. We were fooled by the location, expected easier commuting by foot. In all other aspects, this appt. is better than average. "
1566487,18590415,2014-08-28,2726546,Susan,"A great apartment in a convenient neighborhood. Many cool design elements - even the tissue box in the bathroom is interesting - and we appreciated the vase of fresh flowers on the balcony. Even the aerobed was unusually comfortable. Like most Seattle homes, no A/C, so during the unusual warm days during our visit, the apt was a bit hot during the day. It's on the top floor, so it got plenty of sunlight. We also enjoyed the well-stocked kitchen."
1566487,18875487,2014-09-02,16095086,Aaron,"Space was very clean and well kept. Made for a great home-base while in Seattle for the PAX Gaming convention. Rodrigo was easy to communicate with and very prompt with his replies.

The actual location was somewhat off the mark (and further from downtown than we wanted) compared to what the estimate showed when we were initially setting up the booking. It looks like this is no longer a problem and the posting shows an accurate location now."
1566487,19274393,2014-09-09,19145783,Brandon,"Rodrigo's Condo was magnificent, it was only a 20 minute walk to downtown, great views, great neighbors. When ever i had a question Rodrigo answered almost immediately.  When i come back to Seattle I will try and book Rodrigo's place again!!   

Thank you."
1566487,19606391,2014-09-15,5105857,John,"Rodrigo's apartment was nicely decorated and spotlessly clean. There was an array of snacks and beverages available for purchase, which was a nice touch. The neighbourhood is pleasant, with plenty of parking available and a good supermarket just around the corner. It's about a 30 minute walk from central Seattle: we actually enjoyed the exercise (especially given the wonderful weather when we visited), but there are also bus-stops nearby if you prefer. We didn't meet Rodrigo in person, but his response to messages was consistently fast and helpful."
1566487,19945058,2014-09-21,1699607,Jeff,Great place. All was as described. Super fast and cheap to make it to downtown. 
1566487,20657150,2014-10-03,1701171,Antons,"This was a perfect location for us. It was in a vibrant area close to transit and within an easy walking distance to downtown. The apt was as pictured... beautiful and very hip. It was very clean and had everything we might possibly need including wifi. Rodrigo was a lovely host. He was very responsive and had information available on points of interest and suggestions about good locations, restaurants and pubs in the area."
1566487,21221955,2014-10-13,1730313,Paul,"Rodrigo's space was clean and comfortable. Not entirely home-like (snacks  were laid out for purchase like a hotel), however it was perfect for a few friends needing to crash over the weekend."
1566487,21628243,2014-10-20,8763721,Adam,Rodrigo's place was very clean and exactly as described.  He was easy to communicate with through text and was helpful.  We would consider staying again on our next visit to Seattle.  Thanks Rodrigo!
1566487,22328439,2014-11-03,19291833,Connie,Rodrigo was very welcoming. He was very helpful in guiding us to the location and gave us all the information we needed to know. His listing was accurate and was a very convenient location. Safeway and restaurants were all less than 10 mins away by car. I will definitely stay here again the next time I travel to Seattle. 
1566487,23252566,2014-11-26,23595720,Matt,The experience was exactly as advertised. Very clean. Close to amenities. Free parking on street. Easy access. Rodrigo does a great job in communication as well.
1566487,25247722,2015-01-10,18276365,Marc,"Rodrigo was incredibly accommodating, attentive, and got back to me immediately when I needed him to.  His place is really charming and clean, and would definitely recommend it to others."
1566487,25484399,2015-01-17,2120578,Reed,"Great place to stay. It was very comfortable and clean. It was easy to get there from the train station for me, and plenty of food and coffee options around."
1566487,25561965,2015-01-19,24173423,Zach,Wonderful home! My girlfriend and I loved every aspect of it. Everything came just as advertised and the entire apartment was exceptionally clean. Can't wait to come back!
1566487,25817358,2015-01-26,19808677,Mike,Very clean modern apartment.
1566487,25915897,2015-01-29,25364077,Andrew,"Very clean, very nice place.  Rodrigo was very informative and available .  Recommended."
1566487,26121895,2015-02-03,1273832,Charmaine,The was very clean it was very Central. Located downtown Seattle. There was good communication with Rodrigo. Easy access to the apartment. It was a great experience.
1566487,26282844,2015-02-08,26981034,Juyoung,"i couldn't meet Rodrigo but i didn't need to meet him.
Room was so clean, Everything is fine.
The room is so far from downtown by walking. If you have a car, This room will be good choice, In my case i used Uber. price for Uber is just 5~6 $ to downtown from room."
1566487,26574403,2015-02-15,398872,Dalia,"We did not meet Rodrigo, but the instructions were clear and everything was easy and straightforward. 

The apartment was very clean and the description was accurate. 

Location is good, secure and quiet, but far if you plan to walk to the main tourist attractions. That said, you can get anywhere by driving less than 5 minutes. We did not try public transport, but there were buses a few blocks away.

Overall, a good experience. We would definitely stay there again. "
1566487,26785910,2015-02-19,25253322,James,"Lovely cozy place, kept in immaculate condition, tucked away in a nice quiet spot in town. It made for a most excellent trip to Seattle! A+"
1566487,27502920,2015-03-06,8119228,Frank,"Clean, cool and chill crib.  

I recommend Rodrigo's place.  
It is a little bit of a hike to capital hill and downtown....still very walkable + many a bus line nearby.  And there's an amazing Fried Chicken joint down 23rd.  "
1566487,27739487,2015-03-10,1198913,Arash,"Great apartment that was spotless and an amazingly accommodating host. It is centrally located in the heart of Seattle, so you are always minutes away from whatever you are planning to do in Seattle. Have I mentioned that the neighborhood is very quiet so when you come back from a long day, you sure can get a good night rest?"
1566487,28389611,2015-03-23,15474241,Jeffrey,"Loved staying at Rodrigo's place!  I arrived early and he was able to accommodate an early arrival and made the check-in and check-out experience very easy.  He was always on quick to respond to any questions and always offered his help.

We rented a car (in hindsight unnecessary -- you're a quick Uber ride from anything!) and parking was easy nearby.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.   I would definitely stay here again!"
1566487,28633965,2015-03-27,6387496,John,Rodrigo was very helpful at the last minute and flexible when i needed to stay an extra day. He did a nice job setting the place upa nd I had a great stay.
1566487,28809100,2015-03-30,12271210,Aileen,"Rodrigo made us feel very welcome! Walking into the apartment, my first impression was, ""Beautiful!"" "
1566487,29764906,2015-04-12,1876017,Ally,"Rodrigo is an exceptional host! Upon entering the apartment, we said, ""wow, so fancy!"" He had already made up the extra airbed for us, so all we had to do was relax and enjoy the space. He has thought of everything for his guests in offering snacks or beer (that you pay extra for, but still so generous to take the time to stock the fridge.)
We didn't do much in the neighborhood, mainly going out in nearby Belltown or Capitol Hill. Where Rodrigo lives has a very nice park and ampitheater, and Broadcast Coffee a couple of blocks away made the BEST americano I've ever had. Thank you, Rodrigo for opening your apartment to us!"
1566487,29883398,2015-04-13,10904997,Yohanes,It's wonderful place.
1566487,30499633,2015-04-23,28400832,Ada,Loved this place. Rodrigo was super easy to get a hold of and the apartment was so comfy. He had an air mattress to accommodate all 3 of us. Close to downtown and uber ride away. Thank you Rodrigo!
1566487,31814990,2015-05-10,6067392,Andrew,"Rodrigo is a great host. Communication was good and checkin was easy. 
The apartment is great. Big single bed, with a balcony, good light in the afternoons, and full kitchen with everything. Parking was easy too. 

Good location, there are groceries withing walking distance, you can get the bus to downtown on jackson, or you can walk to downtown about 30 min. Little saigon and china town are a 20 min walk. I had no problem walking.

Overall, I was really pleased."
1566487,32184447,2015-05-15,2880826,Mélissa,"Nous avons passé un très bon séjour à Seattle, du 9 au 14 mai. L'appartement de Rodrigo était parfait et exactement tel que décrit dans son annonce. Propre, fonctionnel et facilement accessible. 
Rodrigo a toujours été disponible pour répondre à nos questions et était facilement joignable. Le check-in et le check-out se sont très bien déroulés et Rodrigo a été très accommodant avec nous.

Merci encore Rodrigo et au plaisir,
Mélissa et Émilie-Maude



"
1566487,32511437,2015-05-19,27222674,Vincent,"We have spent a great weekend at Rodrigo's home. The apartment was very clean and there were all we needed for the weekend in Seattle. It is close to bus stations, so very convenient. "
1566487,33248811,2015-05-26,13271348,Elda,"Buena localización, el lugar estaba muy limpio, fácil acceso al transporte público. Rodrigo fue muy accesible todo el tiempo, nos facilitó el check in y check out. Respondió muy rápido a mis preguntas. Muy amable "
1566487,34345879,2015-06-07,10625596,Zach,"Space was as described. Clean, modern, and very comfortable. Rodrigo was very hospitable and the whole experience was very nice. Thank you!"
1566487,34862798,2015-06-13,28882032,Peter,"Great place and location! Few blocks south of Pike street, a few more blocks east of downtown, 2 blocks from a coffee shop and 10 blocks from uncle Ike's! "
1566487,35214138,2015-06-16,595495,Jill,We had a lovely time at Rodrigo's Apartment. It was extremely clean and the patio overlooking the park is great! We had four of us staying at the apartment and Rodrigo graciously set up the airbed for us with linens and sheets. We never cooked but he has all the necessary tools to create a great meal in the kitchen. The walk downtown to Pioneer Square only took 20 minutes and Uber taxi's were always around and convenient. There is a brewery a few blocks away from the apartment and it is a cool place to check out. Overall I would highly recommend his place. It looked exactly like the photos . You can't go wrong! 
1566487,35639534,2015-06-21,15383326,Terri,"Rodrigo was very welcoming, communicated freely, and accurately described the listing.  This was the beginning week of an extended trip for us, and started us out in a great way: wonderful place, perfect location for us, easy drive to anywhere in the city.  We were very comfortable during our stay!"
1566487,35817583,2015-06-22,33533668,Craig,"This was my first stay in an Airbnb listed property and it was exactly what I expected.
The apartment had lots of sun in the afternoon and the balcony overlooked a park that had some action but surprisingly very quiet noise wise which was great.
Rodrigo made available lots of extras such as beverages and snacks for a minimal fee which was a nice little touch.
Rodrigo was very prompt at answering any communications and with complete detail to the questions or comments. His home is true to its description in every aspect.
The location was a 5 - 10 minute cab ride to Safeco field  ($7.80 fare $10 with tip made the driver happy). The drive was down Jackson street which took us through Little Saigon and a part of China town. 
Overall we had a great stay and would stay at Rodrigos again in the future.
Thank You Airbnb and Rodrigo"
1566487,36122829,2015-06-25,35002890,Nina,"This was my first Airbnb experience and a great one! Rodrigo was awesome to deal with - answering all questions promptly & kindly (before and during the visit). We forgot to tell him we needed the air mattress until the day before we arrived and he accommodated us with no issues. 

Although we were a bit nervous about the process in general, check in was super easy. The place was exactly as it looks in the photos - clean, modern, natural light and well-equipped. Parking was easy and the location was convenient for getting to wherever we needed to go (drive, walk or uber). We used the kitchen for breakfasts, lunches & snacks and found everything we needed.

The neighborhood was pleasantly quiet. There was some noise (planes, get-togethers in the park below) but we never found it to be a nuisance and it always stopped before we were ready to sleep.

Great spot!"
1566487,36528908,2015-06-29,30752137,Allison,The apartment was very clean and lovely to stay out. My friend and I enjoyed the decor and amenities that were provided by Rodrigo. Nice neighborhood surrounded by other newly remodeled apartments. It was a little tricky o navigate since there is so much construction going on but other then that I highly recommend this stay. About a 10-15 minutes drive to downtown
1566487,37058571,2015-07-04,33521668,Shreyas,"Rodrigo is a very nice person, responded very quickly whenever we had a question. He has a beautiful well furnished modern home. Very clean as well. Plenty of street parking. His home is very close to downtown Seattle. We used uber to get around which cost us less than parking fee in downtown. Overall very pleasant experience. Defiantly recommend his place."
1566487,37567572,2015-07-08,24245712,Alan,"The place was very enjoyable exactly as advertised. It was clean, well decorated, and spacious for myself and my girlfriend. We loved the balcony. The location was also great for a mixture of walking to destinations and reasonably priced Uber rides. Rodrigo was a very helpful host and responded quickly to inquiries. Overall, I would highly recommend this for a Seattle trip."
1566487,37788551,2015-07-10,28733193,Kevin,Great place to stay. It was very close to Chinatown and Downtown Seattle. The place was quite spacious. I'd love to stay here again. Rodrigo arrange the check in and check our process really easy and very convenient. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends. 
1566487,40093886,2015-07-28,31541811,Michelle,Awesome apartment in a great location close to light rail station and grocery store! Well definitely pick this place to stay at next time I am in town. Amazing host who made sure we had what we needed for our stay!
1566487,40789964,2015-08-02,5573264,Molly,"The apartment was just as described. It was very clean, check in/out was simple, we loved the washer/dryer, we loved the roku/netflix, and the bathroom was very nice. Although we have no complaints there were things I think would have made our stay better. If you plan to visit Seattle in July/Aug we would highly recommend you get a place with Air Conditioning. We didn't think it would be this warm (the deck read 100+ almost every day we were there) and although we were provided fans we were frying in the apartment. This was also the first Airbnb I had stayed in where the host didn't greet us. One of the main reasons I love airbnb is meeting the hosts and them recommending things for us to do in the city.  Overall though it was exactly as described and our stay was easy. Thank you!"
1566487,41951942,2015-08-10,34616475,Aeon,"Very nice place with a good patio view, and a solid host! Affordable Lyft rates to anywhere in the city when you can't handle the Seattle hills in the summer heat!"
1566487,42473107,2015-08-13,31889072,Jesse,"Listing was accurate.  Above average Airbnb property, a few issues, but it will be fixed I am sure.  I wouldn't book if it is going to be warm in Seattle as the apartment has a lot of western exposure and heats up excessively in the afternoon and evening."
1566487,43072844,2015-08-17,24299685,Julie,"This was one of the best Airbnb's I have ever stayed at. The apartment is impeccable; I was very impressed with the cleanliness.  The decor is great too!  Parking is easy and available on the street.  It's possible to walk downtown, but we just took Ubers and it costs about $5 to get downtown.  There isn't any AC and it can get hot on the top floor in August, but there are plenty of fans to cool you off.  Host was responsive."
1566487,46124620,2015-09-08,31093773,Danny,"I loved staying at Rodrigo's apartment. The space is clean, the grill is excellent, and the place was perfect for me.  I was a little nervous it was too far from Downtown but the 27 bus picks up right up the street and means your downtown in about 20 minutes. Great Stay!"
1566487,46626992,2015-09-12,20989733,Lana,"Rodrigo's apartment was clean, modern and comfortable. We had a great time staying here. The location was convenient since it was close to downtown and everything else. Parking on the street was easy to find. We were able to use Rodrigo's TV to watch shows on Netflix, and we were also able to use his BBQ, which we were stoked about. The balcony was great! Communicating with Rodrigo was easy and he replied almost instantly, which was convenient when I had questions.
Thanks for a great stay Rodrigo!"
1566487,47971198,2015-09-22,6107725,Sam,"Rodrigo's apartment was the perfect launching pad for seeing Seattle!  My flight arrived earlier than the official check in, and Rodrigo was very accommodating.  The apartment was clean and nice with all the amenities.  I can't recommend this listing highly enough! "
1566487,48890555,2015-09-29,19143089,Edna,"Best BNB I've stayed in so far! Rodrigo's home was very clean and exactly how the pictures look! Great communication skills and will reply fairly quickly. His home isn't too far from downtown Seattle- We used uber for 2 days for close by areas and a rental for the other days that were a bit farther. His home has practically everything (extra pillows,linens,towels,dishes,pots,Netflix, Hulu) Definitely a great place to stay!  "
1566487,49820712,2015-10-06,633313,Michael,"Rodrigo's apartment was great! Super clean and modern with all of the conveniences you could ask for (washer/dryer, dishwasher, balcony, grill(!)). While we didn't meet Rodrigo, he made our arrival and entry super easy and was always very quick to reply to any of our messages. The neighborhood is quiet and seemed safe, just a 20 minute walk from downtown/Capitol Hill. A great experience, thanks Rodrigo!"
1566487,50632244,2015-10-13,16043345,Atsuko,"I feel good I was able to spend a week.
Thank you!"
1566487,51282118,2015-10-19,890116,Ruben,"Rodrigo was in constant contact before the trip and made the stay in Seattle very stress free. His house was very clean and exactly as advertised. He had all beds, sheets, and towels ready when we arrived and provided assistance throughout. A really great host and the place is within walking distance to Capital Hill. "
1566487,56049721,2015-12-08,30722806,Deborah,"Rodrigo's apartment is exactly as it is described - modern, incredibly clean, and perfect.   He responded to any messaging promptly, and included offers of any assistance that we might need.  We were comfortable in his place, and loved the neighborhood.  We would wholeheartedly recommend this listing!"
278192,1025259,2012-03-20,1847002,Dee,This room is also clean and quiet. The host is really really nice. Recommend!
278192,1168970,2012-04-23,1614285,Jeffrey,"Keith & Cherie are great hosts. Great communication from booking to our arrival! Keith even stopped by to check on us and show us around and he even took the time to drive us to the Light Rail station so that we could catch a Mariners game in time, thanks!!"
278192,1269261,2012-05-12,2321203,Brice,"I was travelling around the US with a friend and we had a really nice stay in Seattle for a couple of nights. The place was simple, comfy and located in a very nice and calm neighbourhood. Keith and Cherie were extremely welcoming and easy going. I would highly recommend the place and the hosts."
278192,1522908,2012-06-20,2193619,Brendan,"Keith was a great host and made my trip a memorable one. Great location, short walk to transportation to the city. Keith even took me to see Jimi Hendrix's grave which would have been a long trip on the buses so I am thankful for that also. Overall a great host and I recommend him highly"
278192,1644241,2012-07-06,2709003,Aaron,"When you travel to a place that you are unfamiliar with, one of the best feelings is having a friend there. That is exactly how Keith & Cherie made us feel. We loved our stay with them and their family made us feel right at home over the fourth of July holiday."
278192,1725063,2012-07-16,2060993,Melissa,"This was exactly the weekend my girlfriend and I needed. Keith met us at the ferry and took us to his home. Nice quiet neighbourhood which was located close to the Lightrail system, a fresh market and liqour store. 

When we orginally contacted Keith and Cherie about our plans for Seattle we told them a little about ourselves and what we were looking for and then they filled in all the blanks. We had such a great time with the party bus, Keiths love for Seattle was apparent. He took us to a few hot spots & seemingly knew someone everywhere we went which only added to our experience! 

Cherie was really sweet and made sure we had everything we needed as if we were at home. They really made us feel welcome and we would definitly be back! 

Sarah and I couldn't stop giggling about our night and kept saying that had we not stayed with them we may not have had the fun and experiences we did! Thanks Guys! I'm sure we will see you again!

Melissa & Sarah"
278192,1798953,2012-07-25,2818282,Meagan,"My girlfriends & I LOVED staying at Keith & Cherie's!  They are super fun hosts... if you chose to stay with them, get ready to have a blast!  Their house is neat & clean, and feels very safe. Furthermore, both Keith & Cherie know all the fun spots in Seattle, and they gave us lots of great suggestions. PLUS they gave us rides to those places via their transportation business, which was great because we didn't have a car.  Overall, a wonderful experience!"
278192,1815319,2012-07-27,2750760,Leslie,"I really enjoyed staying at Keith &Cherie's place! Cherie was nice, and Keith was SO HELPFUL!! The rooms are clean and so was the bathroom. We stayed in the upstairs bedroom with the bunk beds. I thought it was plenty for us. His Daughter was super sweet! loved seeing how they both are so proud of their city! And they know so much! The neighborhood is calm and its about a 5-10  min walk to the sound transit rail! Super easy to get into DT. Next time I go back I'd definitely try and stay here. The Asphy family is a great Host!"
278192,1833591,2012-07-29,3019783,Michael,Keith & Cherie accommodated us last minute.  They were friendly and informative in regards to telling us what areas to go check out even though we were rushed.  Thanks Keith & Cherie!
278192,7150305,2013-09-08,8588394,Abby,"Prez and Cherie were very kind. I needed a place to stay at the last minute. They were prompt in their response and I felt accommodated through my whole experience. 

I stayed in the lower level of the house which was nice and cool during the hot summer week I was visiting Seattle. The kitchen and bathroom were both clean and nice. It was great to have a place to cook!
"
278192,7571198,2013-09-24,8925981,Beatriz,My sister and I stayed at Prez and Cherie's home while celebrating my birthday. They were great hosts and very sweet! Their home is located close to all the sights and they recommend places to go which was really nice! We'd love to stay with them again!
278192,9844083,2014-01-13,10290454,Han Lin,"Prez and Cherie were great, extremely helpful in showing us around the house. They even offered us a ride to our destination to save us the hassle of travelling!"
278192,9947316,2014-01-20,11379572,Diana,"Our stay was really express (only one night) we were 4 people total and for what we wanted it was perfect! The place was really clean and in good conditions, it seemed really nice even for a longer stay. I will recommend it if you are looking for something more affordable!"
278192,16193833,2014-07-22,10301180,Alexandra,We booked last minute and they responded right away. Prez met us in person and showed us the apartment. The bed was very comfortable and we were able to use the washer/dryer. Thanks for making our stay in Seattle pleasurable.
3418349,15720924,2014-07-14,2879494,Alyson,Great place and location just outside of downtown in a nice neighbourhood.  Very stylish and clean apartment with a great view of the city- the photos dont do the place justice!  Zachary was quick to respond to messages and easy to speak with.  Great host and highly recommend the apartment.
3418349,17387220,2014-08-11,1695943,Dan,"The stay at Zachary's was ideal. It was clean, well-furnished and the location and view cannot be beat. Walking distance to Queen Anne, Belltown, the Space Needle, museums, bars/restaurants, etc. Zachary was extremely easy to work with, kept in good communication throughout the process and check-in/out was a breeze. I will definitely be staying there again next time I am in town. "
3418349,18132141,2014-08-22,17569976,Julie,We loved staying at Zachary's apt. It was clean and had a great view. The parking was clutch! He responded to any and all msges before and during our stay very promptly. Perfect for one person or a couple.
3418349,18325482,2014-08-25,8145088,Dave,"This place is awesome!  Not only because the apartment is rad, but Zachary was quick to answer any questions to help us out.  I would absolutely recommend this place to stay.  Super clean, quiet neighborhood, and very close to downtown (if that's your thing).  Anyway, 5 out of 5 stars."
3418349,18424440,2014-08-26,18978834,Rebecca,"We stayed here for our wedding night and it was perfect. The view was amazing and we could just relax in this beautiful, clean apartment :) Thank you!"
3418349,18496981,2014-08-27,3783270,David,"Zachary was a great host. Detailed instructions, great communication throughout the stay, even willing to text back and forth in the middle of helping his family move to help me connect to the (excellent) wifi. 

The condo/apartment building isn't much to look at but Zachary's place is beautiful. Photos of the views don't lie and the location's a convenient 30 min walk to downtown. Great value for the money, highly recommended."
3418349,18593308,2014-08-28,10001777,Jake,"The place was great, just as advertised. It was a good space, the view was awesome. Zach was easy to reach and made the experience very straightforward. "
3418349,18667911,2014-08-30,18882797,James,Zachary's place was exactly as described.  We spent 1 day/2 nights in Seattle and walked everywhere we wanted to go from the apartment.  Awesome view from the balcony too!  Would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle.
3418349,19283258,2014-09-09,20117679,Ellen,The apartment was very clean and attractive. The view of the Seattle skyline and Space Needle was spectacular! Location was very convenient and neighborhood seemed safe at night. Good place to stay. 
3418349,19487498,2014-09-13,20691992,Owen,Had a great stay.  Bed was extra comfortable.  Location was perfect.  Communication with host was outstanding.  Would stay there again in a heartbeat next time we are in the area.  
3418349,19613412,2014-09-15,5160352,Hope,"Zachary was quite eager to communicate with us & clearly wanted us to enjoy our stay. The view from his place is stunning, far better than I had hoped. The bed was quite comfortable & the tv was quite nice. He also provided us with plenty of water bottles, which we definitely used. As well as some snacks & cereal (but no milk). All in all it was a pleasant experience,  & we appreciated being able to check in quite early/easily."
3418349,19916474,2014-09-20,21360238,Gabriella,"I give this Listing 2 thumbs up and 100 gold stars! Everything was exactly as described. The view from the deck is UNBELIEVABLE! You see the whole Seattle skyline and are super close to the space needle. Very impressive-- the pictures on here don't do it justice at all. Great waking score as well-- we walked to bars and restaurants and the bank, as well as quick pick up by Uber. The apartment was very clean, bed was amazingly comfy, shower was awesome, and the TV was the biggest I've ever seen. Zachary is super super nice and very communicable- he answered my questions quickly and thoroughly. WAY better than a hotel , and a better deal too. Quiet neighborhood as well."
3418349,19974324,2014-09-21,13985971,Karen,Great neighborhood and nice apartment. Zachary provided all the detail and made it very easy for us to arrive and depart. There was convenient on street parking and we found a great neighborhood breakfast place the next morning.
3418349,20477309,2014-09-29,2796437,Bill,"I will reiterate what others have said: great apartment, beautiful view, great host. Zach is very friendly and helpful and is eager to make your Seattle trip a good one. The neighborhood is great and a good base from which to explore Seattle.

I will say the following with the caveat that it's no fault of the host, just stuff you should be aware of for planning purposes: this is a multi story apartment building and you can hear the upstairs neighbors walking around. That's just city living, but something to be aware of if you're sensitive to it. The building is on a steep hill (how else to get great views?) so keep that in mind when you plan to walk. You'll feel it in your hips the next day! Seattle is under construction! I counted 16 cranes from the amazing patio view. Again, not the host's problem but keep it in mind when making travel plans in the city, allow a little more time for getting around. 

Great place, and great host. We would happily stay here again."
3418349,21029209,2014-10-10,3638267,Jared,"Very nice apartment with a stunning view. Zac was easy to communicate with, even as he was going out of country, and getting in and out was super easy. The neighborhood is quiet with bars, restaurants, groceries, etc all in walking distance. I'd stay here again."
3418349,21315274,2014-10-14,22086229,Bryant,Experience was Great glad I choose to stay here while I visited Seattle!
3418349,21581237,2014-10-20,18679798,Jimmie,"Zachary's place was amazing and exactly as described, actually it was better! The view of the city and Space Needle is spectacular. The bed was very comfortable, kitchen had everything, deck, large TV and was in walking distance to many things. Would HIGHLY recommend to anyone! Great experience!"
3418349,22075939,2014-10-29,22213436,Sarah,"We had a great experience at Zachary’s place! The view is stunning, accommodations were exactly as described (awesome TV!!) and the kitchen had everything we needed.   Walking distance to a lot of places (Seattle Center, cafes, restaurants) and under two blocks to a bus stop. This is THE PERFECT location if you don’t want to rent a car on your trip. Zachary was easy to connect with and was quick to respond to any questions we had. We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
3418349,22330784,2014-11-03,9685280,Amy,"A little slice of perfect in lower Queen Anne, a wonderful safe neighborhood with plenty of places within walking distance for shopping, eating and milling around. We were attending a concert at Key Arena, it was a perfect to walk to dinner, concert and back. Zachary was easy to communicate with, quick to answer questions even while in another country. The space was very clean, nicely decorated, the bed super comfy. Zachary was kind enough to let us linger as no one was checking in after us, it was great to have extra time to relax before heading home. We frequent Seattle and would consider this our place to stay in the future! "
3418349,22513059,2014-11-08,12934633,Ryan,"Zachary was quick to contact me to make sure I had everything I would need.  His place is wonderful-clean, comfortable and an AMAZING view of downtown Seattle.

It's very close to just about everything you would want in Seattle.  There is a nice restaurant and coffee shop just down the hill.  Parking can be somewhat tricky, depending on the time of day, but overall not a huge deal.  

The bed was super comfy and I had everything I needed for a great stay.  I would definitely recommend staying here."
3418349,22530744,2014-11-09,15722314,Kylie,"Zach's apartment is perfect.  It's cozy, clean, and equipped with everything you could possibly need for any length of stay.  And you absolutely cannot beat the view and location.  Zach was excellent at coordinating and immediately responded to all communication.  Couldn't be more pleased!   "
3418349,22668895,2014-11-11,9682754,Alicia,"I did not get the chance to meet Zach in person, but he had great communication skills and was very accommodating.  He gave me detail instructions and that made it so easy. The location was with in walking distance of transportation and Seattle center and very safe. The view was lovely! The bed was very comfy, but we did hear the upstairs people walk around. Nothing serious but it is something that you just get use to, besides that we had a great time, thank you Zac. "
3418349,22755078,2014-11-13,18492801,Ned,"Great location, great place! Just as advertised, if not better. Cozy, spacious, comfortable, easy and beautiful walks to Queen Anne, Seattle Center, Westlake. Beautiful stairways and parks all around. Highly recommended place and an excellent host!"
3418349,22871881,2014-11-16,21878200,Todd,"I travel for business I love Lower Queen Anne. Zachary's location was perfect. You can't have a better view of the city. 
Zachary's communication was spot on. Very accommodating. 
Great restaurants and coffee shops just down the hill."
3418349,22921019,2014-11-17,23384193,David,Great location.  Amazing view!  Comfortable and cozy apartment.
3418349,23167194,2014-11-24,3656709,Bryan & Mark,"Zachary's listing of the property was accurate and the night view of the Seattle Center and Space Needle were stunning. Parking was sometimes available in front of the apartment complex, but more often available within a three block radius. WATCH THE SIGNS as there are restrictions!! Zachary was excellent at responding to messages and questions before and during our week-long stay. The proximity to my business at the Seattle Center made this lodging an idea situation. There are many restaurants, stores, and shops in Lower Queen Anne within a fifteen minutes walk. On the downside, the walls are thin and it is possible to enjoy the neighbor's music and conversations through the walls and floor. Bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. "
3418349,23201558,2014-11-25,7026288,Heidi,The reservation was canceled 8 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3418349,23380756,2014-11-30,21470564,Debi,Overall great place.  Clean. Comfortable.  Well equipped kitchen. Good movie selection in DVD library.   Great view! Great location.  Easy walk to downtown.  Host is very accommodating and easy to communicate with. 
3418349,23486226,2014-12-01,5469454,Toni,"Great location. Plenty of parking around the neighborhood. The apartment interior was comfortable. Great light, view and balcony. The bed was comy."
3418349,24216568,2014-12-22,19264278,Sam,The apartment was in a great neighborhood near the space needle. Setup was super easy and the place looked great on the inside. Zachary was an excellent host .
3418349,24251556,2014-12-23,4521672,Adriane,"We loved staying at Zach's place during our weekend in Seattle. He was prompt with communication leading up to our stay, and provided clear instructions and expectations for his home. The space was clean, quiet, and conveniently located to downtown. Plus, the view was breathtaking both during the day and at night! "
3418349,24393163,2014-12-27,24977445,Jared,"The place was immaculately clean, the view off the deck is incredible, and Zachary answered all questions promptly.  There is a great coffee shop, bar, and 7-11 3 blocks down the hill that came in handy, QFC is within walking distance as well.  Plenty of good cookware was available in the kitchen.  Would gladly stay here again."
3418349,26081121,2015-02-02,21047089,Dora,"Zachary's apartment was awesome. It was clean, comfortable, and the place had great access to everything in downtown. He was very quick to answer all our questions. Great place, would come back here. "
3418349,26122533,2015-02-03,27004497,Mark,"Zachary was very helpful and quick to respond.  His apartment is tastefully decorated and very clean.  Better than expected 180 degree view of downtown Seattle.  Very close to supermarket, convenience store and restaurants.  The 55"" TV was a great plus for watching the Superbowl.  Bed mattress is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept on.  The apartment is close to public transportation.

On the downside, some minor things:  

1/  Water pressure for the shower could be stronger

2/  Walls and floors are a bit on the thin side...can hear the upstairs neighbours every step and a small party but I can overlook that since it was Superbowl weekend.

3/  Looks like they are beginning to build a new home/building in front of the apartment.  I was already awake by 8am but if you want to sleep in the dump truck and backhoe might wake you up until the construction is complete.

Overall, great location, host and decor at a reasonable price."
3418349,26720213,2015-02-17,25849735,Makaela,"Zac was very communicative and laid back. I am very thankful that he allowed me to book this apartment for my parents. They were thrilled but the view, excited about the balcony, and deeply appreciated the quality and presentation of his space. It was my parents' first experience using airbnb and their experience was so good, they said ""We will never book a hotel again! This is so much better, we feel at home!"" Thank you for helping my parents and I have such a pleasant and comfortable time while they stayed in Seattle."
3418349,26852512,2015-02-20,8803600,Lisa,The apartment was wonderful. Zachary is a great host & his place has the best view of the Space Needle & more. We had everything we needed for a great stay. 
3418349,26935201,2015-02-22,1373394,Jeff And Kati,"We loved Zac's place!  The view was tremendous and we walked most everywhere.  We especially loved eating at Toulouse Petit and Pesos--both an easy walk.  It is in a great area and we loved exploring!  Seattle Center was an easy walk.  The apartment was clean and cozy with mostly hardwood floors.  Check in was easy.  We did not cook anything during our stay, so I did not check out the equipment, but it looked like we would have been comfortable preparing meals.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat."
3418349,27013430,2015-02-23,7005151,Stephanie,"Zachary was an amazing host.  We didn't meet, but he had great communication (very detailed and responded to any questions I had quickly).  
The apartment is in a nice neighbourhood which is close to EMP and the Space Needle.  We went to a great Mexican restaurant and a cafe as well (both within a few blocks) which made it easy. Street parking was found within 2 blocks of the apartment at no extra cost which was a bonus.  
We were there for a night and loved the view from the balcony.  You can hear people walking around (on the stairs outside of the suite and the tenants above), but it wasn't an issue.  The bed was incredibly comfortable as well which made for a great sleep."
3418349,28321755,2015-03-22,25792829,Jessica,"Zac's place felt like home! The pictures and views are exactly what you get! (The view of the space needle is fabulous!) The neighborhood is well kept, and full of places to eat and drink, which is super convenient. Communicating with Zac was extremely easy and his responses were quick. 
The only drawback is being able to hear the upstairs neighbor walking, but it's just a cause of normal apartment living. If you're planning to sleep in or are a light sleeper, bring earplugs and you'll be just fine.
We were very happy to stay a few nights at Zac's pad. Thanks for being such a kind host!!!"
3418349,28424140,2015-03-23,28893652,Dylan,Great space for a weekend in Seattle. Close to downtown and easy to find. Communication throughout the time leading up to the trip made everything run smoothly. Thanks again!
3418349,28736231,2015-03-29,3636406,Shannon,"Zac's apartment was clean and comfortable, exactly what we needed for a quick trip to Seattle.  And the view was better than advertised.  Thanks Zac!"
3418349,28820361,2015-03-30,1239330,Matthew,Zachary's place was great. Extremely close to the Space needle and monorail station so it's easy to get around by walking if you want. Street parking was free which was very nice. The apartment was great and exactly as described. I'd would definitely stay here again when i return to Seattle.
3418349,28899702,2015-03-31,1789515,Dmitry,"Very nice place with great view. The only thing is we had hard time starting the grill, turned out we accidentally damage it, but the problem was solved ( paid out half of the grill price). Unfortunately that's probably wasnt enough for Zack....."
3418349,31402789,2015-05-04,32000352,Paul,"My experience with Zach was great!  Super fast and easy communication, place was exactly as described, and the view is amazing! Also, I slept amazingly well as bed was very, very comfortable.  As an added bonus, being a WSU alum I certainly enjoyed the crimson and gray motif.  Highly recommend this place for anybody coming to Seattle!"
3418349,32262947,2015-05-16,31544835,Justin,"Host was very quick to reply to all our questions about how to get to the place, how to get in, etc, which made us feel at ease when arriving. The view was amazing at the place, and the whole apartment was well kept. Overall a nice place."
3418349,36534971,2015-06-29,31931541,Keiko,"We had a great stay at Zach's place. It is very clean, well organized, with all the necessities for a comfortable stay. The location is perfect, being reasonably close to downtown, and right on the transit routes and very close to the bike share. As advertised, the view is amazing. Zach is very responsive and helpful."
3418349,37561595,2015-07-08,28834027,Peggy,"The listing was accurate. Home was on a steep hill (common for the area)! We had all the amenities needed--several small restaurants nearby. Easy access to grocery store, too!"
3418349,37850795,2015-07-11,831910,Eric,"Zachary was a great host!  He checked in with me to make sure I was all settled and that everything was good.  His place is awesome!  Great views of the space needle, tons of free parking near by and also some great restaurants, coffee shops and bars within walking distance. The apartment has everything you need and it is kept very neat and clean. If you are in Seattle I would recommend Zachary and his apartment, neither will disappoint ! "
3418349,38499545,2015-07-16,33829207,Claes,"We had a great time staying here! The view is nothing like the picture.. Its way better! Perfect location. Nice calm neighborhood but just a short downhill walk to everything downtown. 
Check-in and out was super easy.
"
3418349,38594490,2015-07-17,59866,Roxanne,"Zachary's place was fabulous! The photo of his view is exactly as shown, except much much better. This apartment's entire south side is window-filled - which means plenty of sun and plenty of views. Views are local (Seattle Center and lower Queen Anne), plus a background of growing downtown Seattle, and just a peak of water somewhere (Elliott Bay). Walk around his delightful neighborhood and you can find excellent eateries or gorgeous old architectural beauties (mansions, apartments and bungalows all) with breathtaking views of Puget Sound and the Olympic Range... Lots to see in this part of Seattle, and most everything is accessible. I would happily stay here on any Seattle visit.
By the way, this apartment is very comfy. Wonderful bed, cozy couches, airy deck with chairs and table. One could hardly ask for more.
Thank you, Zachary!!!"
3418349,38851593,2015-07-19,19928532,Carrie,The location is great and accessing the apartment was very easy. The apartment had everything we needed for our stay. The only downside to our stay was that the bathroom wasn't very clean when we arrived. 
3418349,39152884,2015-07-21,17346673,George,Great
3418349,39398503,2015-07-23,29240758,Phi,"Listing was accurate and apartment was very close to what we wanted to do in Seattle. You can pretty much walk to the space needle and the entire area. The location was great! The view of downtown and the space needle is one of the best as it's on the hill. Zachary's place was clean and as shown in the pictures. We had a car rental and parking was not too much a problem. Just note that the area is hilly. Overall the neighborhood was safe, so coming in late shouldn't be a huge concern."
3418349,39748209,2015-07-26,32168575,Tara,The apartment is definitely for the younger gens. I didn't look forward to the hill climb everyday but my glutes needed the exercise ;) I'm sure I overstayed my visit cause I was slow getting out but Zack is a very gracious host. He introduced me to Uber and the cute little abode was never lacking in amenities.
3418349,39930101,2015-07-27,6675620,Brad And Marine,"Zach was very welcoming and flexible with our arrival time. The apartment was perfectly clean, the perfect view, really well arranged and decorated. Perfect to visit Seattle, walking distance from space needle."
3418349,40576055,2015-08-01,32281211,Robert,"Zachary was super helpful getting me setup. His recommendations for where to eat nearby were perfect--I mean really top notch. His tips on transport also very helpful. Apartment was 'just like home'. Had everything I needed, very comfortable and cozy. I had a terrific time and would love to go back.
"
3418349,40909181,2015-08-03,23083118,Alex,"Great location apartment was exactly as described. Communication with Zachary was easy and clear and simple check in/check out process. Exactly what we wanted, perfect."
3418349,41070695,2015-08-04,31937629,Christine,"Zachary's place in Seattle is fantastic. The space is clean, has every amenity we needed, and a view that is truly priceless. Zachary suggested some great dinner places and made sure we had everything we needed upon our arrival. The place was just as described, if not better. We loved our stay here! The location is also well worth the money. We were able to walk to dinner, downtown, the Pike Place Market, and Kerry Park for the sunset. Parking was also easy and we were able to be right in front of the building."
3418349,41326992,2015-08-07,18661724,Minae,"We felt like home at this place. We had everything we needed for our trip. It is a clean and nice place.
The view of this place is much better than I expected from the pictures. The night view was just beautiful.
I was worried since it seems like on a hill, but only one block from this place was pretty stiff. We had an easy walk to Seattle center. 
Not like the downtown Seattle, we felt the neighborhood was very comfortable and safe. The location was perfect for a visitor to Seattle.
I would highly recommend this place. "
3418349,41735400,2015-08-09,31158039,Vivian,"We thought the apartment was very comfortable.  Was nice to have a place to retreat.  The neighborhood restaurants, specifically Sushi Land and Crow we're really good.  The only issue we had was parking."
3418349,42117726,2015-08-11,7365735,Victoria,"Apartment was clean and in close proximity to everything we wanted to do. Street parking was not a problem. Definitely walkable, it is not that far up a hill. Beautiful views of the city."
3418349,42566569,2015-08-14,16114356,Felix,"A very nice and clean apartment with spectacular views of the city. Zachary was very quick to respond to all our inquiries and we found everything ready when we arrived. The location is great, it's less than 10min walk to the EMP and Space Needle. I can definitely recommend staying there when you are in Seattle!"
3418349,42801908,2015-08-15,11803109,Patrick,"Super easy to work with Zachary.  Apartment was as he described.  The view is killer!  Great neighborhood and a short walk to some cool places.

The host was ridiculously helpful and quick in communication. It's a short walk to the heart of the lovely Queen Anne neighborhood, but still essentially in the downtown core. Two thumbs up."
3418349,43354673,2015-08-19,29239685,Abby,"Listing was just as described. Very convenient location. We were able to walk to the Space Needle, Kerry Park and lots of restaurants. Parking on the street was easy too. "
3418349,44102526,2015-08-24,19658725,Rebecca,"Awesome View! Clean and Comfortable!  Excellent location close to the Seattle Center.  Several great places to eat within walking distance just down the hill.  Still convenient to downtown (6-10 buck Uber fare).  

No AC makes the place toasty in the middle of August heat wave, but opening the windows at night cools down the place quickly.

Zac was responsive to our inquiries.  Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!

3418349,44418214,2015-08-26,9469438,Phuc,"Great host, great view, great experience!"
3418349,44760172,2015-08-29,9621805,Megan,"Zac's apartment was perfect for everything we wanted to do in Seattle. The apartment was very clean and the view was great. It was a quick walk to the space needle, chihuly gardens and the emp museum. Thanks! "
3418349,44950709,2015-08-30,39963555,Jack,Great place with a perfect view and extremely convenient location!  Only complaint it that the parking was a lot more difficult than described however that could be attributed to the PAX convention in town and not an error by the owner.
3418349,45402712,2015-09-02,7775989,Paul,"I stayed in Seattle for one night only so I was looking for a place with easy check in and check out, conveniently located and offering all that is needed for a short stay. Zachary's apartment was just perfect and I'm sure it is as good when you make it your home base for longer than one night. 
And you can't beat it's  spectacular view!
"
3418349,45555985,2015-09-04,34228523,Daniel,"Let's clarify a few things about this listing.
-""Ample street parking"" must have been a sarcastic joke that I didn't catch as we weren't able to park within 2 blocks in any direction at any point on our trip.
-Advertised playstation 4 (selling point) was not there.
-The location is conveniently placed and there is a nice view, but the apartment was small and not cleaned.  My companion and I were constantly disgusted by the messes (dirty toilet seat, toothpaste on the mirror, etc.).
-The bed was OK, but there was only a rough feeling fitted sheet and a comforter on top of the stained mattress.
-Construction was going on in the courtyard of the small apartment complex.
-Yes, there is a laundry facility, but Zach told us not to tell anyone that we're AirBNB users, so it doesn't seem that he is allowed to rent out his apartment to us.  The laundry facility was in use when we were at the apartment, thus preventing us from doing our laundry since we weren't supposed to be there."
3418349,45656586,2015-09-05,21536025,Robert,"Zachary's home was exactly as described, cozy, comfy, and in a great location. While my husband and I didn't meet Zachary, we was always promptly and friendly in written replies."
3418349,46467101,2015-09-11,23233704,Jessica,"Zachary's place was fantastic.  Great location with a wonderful view, very close to downtown.  Apartment was clean and has everything you could need.  "
3418349,47357126,2015-09-18,37846663,Kevin,"The apartment was everything as described within the description. Zach made himself available to answer any questions or concerns via email/text and made the entire experience very simple. 

The apartment itself was very homey and well set up. Having the Space Needle visible in the background through the windows was a nice addition. The complex is located on a rather steep street, so please be prepared if you should have any physical limitations that may hinder your ability to comfortably get around. 

The property is very central to the heart of Seattle. We walked to the Space Needle and the Chihuly Garden and Glass museum, and from there, it was a couple minute tram ride to Pike Place Market. 

I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone looking to visit Seattle. 

"
3418349,47502848,2015-09-19,41773747,Son,"Zac's place is amazing! Clean, tidy, and have pretty much everything you need. Oh and did I mention the view!?? His place is about $5-$10 Uber ride to downtown. It is also conveniently located very close to Dick's Burger which will satisfy your late night munchies after a night out downtown. Check in/out was a breeze and he is quick to answer all of your questions. I definitely will be coming back next time I am in Seattle.  "
3418349,48255720,2015-09-24,8855991,Peter,"Zach was respectful and easy to communicate with. His place is very clean, comfortable, and the view is spectacular. Everything was close enough to walk or less than ten dollars in an Uber. "
3418349,48998527,2015-09-30,39177215,Christiana,"Great place in a great location. The view from this cute apartment says it all.  We were looking for an affordable, basic place in a good location and this delivered.  The neighborhood is nice and you can walk to a ton of things, including the Space Needle.  We had everything we needed right there, even a grocery store!   The apartment was clean and Zachary was very helpful.  Again, anyone looking for location, location, location with views and a clean place to sleep, you'd be lucky to book this place.  If you are a traveler with more upscale picky tastes or have difficulty climbing in anyway, this might not be the place for you.  The apartment building is located on an extremely steep hill.  Hence, the stellar views.  However, if you can't navigate stairs or hike uphill to get either to your car, restaurants or stores, this isn't the place for you.  Parking can be a little tricky.  We always found parking within a block but, again, the streets are very steep and narrow.   Sound proofing within the building was not the builders concern.  We could hear everything the neighbor upstairs was doing.  We didn't find it to be a big deal but some people might be bothered by the noise.  I wanted to put these down in the review so that if these were things that would bother you, you should find somewhere else to stay and not be upset when  you rented.  Therefore, leaving an unnecessary bad review.  Thanks again Zackary for letting us stay at your place.  Should we come back to Seattle, we'd love to stay at your place again. "
3418349,49161997,2015-10-01,44133885,Paul,Zac's place was just as advertised. I really enjoyed the view and the easy accessibility to Seattle Center. Everything else was only a 5-10 minute uber ride away. Check-in/check-out was super simple and convenient.  Thanks Zac!
3418349,49330442,2015-10-03,13304178,Phillip,My wife and I had a very enjoyable and relaxing time at Zachary's flat. The view is insane! We will for sure be coming back! 
3418349,49891887,2015-10-07,317002,Thomas,"We just got back from an awesome stay here. Zachary's apartment was perfect for my wife and I. The view was amazing, good location, a couple of extra cold beers in the fridge for us, couldn't have asked for more. Everything was within in a good distance for a quick Uber ride or public transportation. Since the weather was so good, we walked a lot of the times. Zachary was a great host and would recommend staying here. Hopefully, will be next year. Go Hawks!"
3418349,50247397,2015-10-10,8145724,Melynda,"The location was perfect, with a fantastic view of downtown and the Space Needle!  Zac's place was clean and was everything I needed for my night in Seattle."
3418349,50388743,2015-10-11,8410712,Rebecca,"Zachary's apartment is a great place to stay when in Seattle. Located in the perfect location, the apartment is clean and welcoming with an amazing terrace and view!"
3418349,50631878,2015-10-13,891410,Becky,"Very easy to locate and check in to the apartment. We didn't meet Zac, but he was very friendly, communicative and easy to reach by phone. The location of this apartment is great, and the apartment itself is comfortable and clean. It does feel like you're staying in a bachelor pad, but a well-appointed one. Be aware that the neighborhood of Queen Anne is essentially a giant hill, so you will be working your glutes if you're walking the neighborhood! The payoff is the stellar view from the living room. "
3418349,51441246,2015-10-20,42205555,Katie,"This location was great! It was a great location for what I needed! I was able to visit local attractions within walking distance! Zachary was very nice, and available if I needed anything. His place was very clean, very orderly, and perfect for a long weekend! I loved everything about it! I had a great time! I would definitely go back and set up a similar arrangement with Zachary! "
3418349,51722177,2015-10-24,34948290,Rachel,Loved the location!  Zachary's apartment was located in a perfect location to downtown Seattle.  Fantastic view of downtown and the Space Needle!! Zachary was also real easy to get ahold of during our stay. All in all perfect place for the city. 
3418349,51901853,2015-10-25,4490636,Dante'Y,Great location and insane view!!! I can't even explain the view. It completed our trip.
3418349,52136844,2015-10-26,16990713,Abe,We had a great time at Zachary's place.  The neighborhood has a great view of downtown Seattle and the place itself was clean and open.
3418349,52576940,2015-10-31,169148,Joan,"Zac was a great host, checking in ahead of time and a couple of times during my 5 day stay. He responded quickly (by text) when I had a question. He also made arrival and departure easy and flexible. 
The apartment was comfortable, clean, and quiet. It has an absolutely incredible view of the city out a wall of big windows, which I especially loved at night; a comfortable living room and dining area, kitchen with everything you need, and a very comfortable bed. (I didn't use the big flat screen TV with surround sound, but it's there.) I liked the exercise, but it is up an extremely steep hill. Lower Queen Anne is a great neighborhood."
3418349,52794540,2015-11-01,10114365,Sarah,This place was nice! Really close to the Seattle Center and a very good view. 
3418349,53000022,2015-11-03,3057194,Scott,"Everything was really fine -- and just as Zachary listed it. Nice space, great location (esp. if the Seattle Center is a main destination), and Zachary made it super easy all the way around. "
3418349,53144666,2015-11-05,42949767,Rebekah,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. The pictures don't lie, the view is incredible! The location is great if you want to walk or take public transportation. We had a rental car and were concerned about parking but there were always a couple spots open for us to park! The home is clean, well appointed, and really is everything you need. Zachary was great at communicating and giving us pointers, and although we didn't meet, he was a perfect host! "
3418349,53491080,2015-11-09,25070638,McKenzie,"We loved staying at Zachary's apartment! The place is very nice and tidy, with an incredible view of the city and space needle. It's just up the road from the Seattle center area and has coffee shops and a couple restaurants within a couple blocks. The area is nice and quite, but not far from the hustle and bustle of the city. Zachary was great about working with our travel times and answered any questions we had right away. I would definitely recommend this apartment!   "
3418349,53645089,2015-11-10,19345950,Deborah,"The apartment itself was very nice; neat and generally clean, and the view of downtown Seattle is truly awesome.  Although the apartment building is pretty rundown (looks like some renovation was in progress), the neighborhood is a very good one; close to many services, but still available parking.  Zachary was very nice and checked in that I'd arrived.  A couple of downsides: no soap in the shower, although a lot of shampoos, and the tub was clean, but could use a good scrub. Can't beat the location!"
3418349,53891978,2015-11-14,21191101,Jesse,The stay was awesome Zach was cool gave me suggestions on everything out there place was clean just as advertised close to the city walking distance to just about everything you need really good coffee place right down the street if I came to Seattle I would defiantly stay again 
3418349,54141852,2015-11-16,47062468,Eboni,I felt very welcome at Zach's place. It was very clean and I felt right at home. His place is conveniently located and we were within minutes of some of Seattle's main attractions. He was very easy to contact and answered all of our questions during our stay. Would definitely recommend! 
3418349,54334129,2015-11-18,19630917,Robin,"Very convenient to get into the apartment, the view was everything I was hoping for from the pictures. His bed is amazingly soft!"
3418349,54484158,2015-11-20,48819701,Sarah,"Zachary was a great host and has a very neat little spot with a wonderful view. Even watching some tv is that much better when you look outside to the view of the space needle and skyline ;D overall we really enjoyed our stay, and look forward to visiting when we're in Seattle again. Thanks, Zac!"
3418349,54521647,2015-11-21,47366473,Amber,"Zachary's place was great! Exactly what I was looking for. Comfortable, great view, clean and crisp atmosphere. Zachary provided great directions and responded quickly to any need of ours. Would book again. "
3418349,54889538,2015-11-25,46329386,Lillian,"The apartment was great! Perfect for two people. When we first pulled up we were a little nervous about it because it is an older apartment building but we had no problems with either neighbors or the surround buildings. Once we got inside it was just as we saw in the photos and the view was better in person than what you see on the profile pictures! Great apartment had everything we needed, even though we did not use the kitchen at all! I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking to visit Seattle. We mostly traveled by foot or Uber. About $5-7 to downtown (a little over 1 mile) but so worth not having to deal with having to find and pay for parking! Also lots of restaurants within walking distance! "
3418349,55017521,2015-11-27,5199745,Sarah,"Two of us stayed in Zach's place very comfortably. Everything in the apartment was easy to use, it was clearly well cared for, and excellent walking distance to Queen Anne nightlife. It is a smallish space, so you won't find absolutely every kitchen gadget you could ask for (couldn't find a toaster or tea kettle for example), but what's there is definitely sufficient for a short stay."
3418349,55261963,2015-11-29,48726630,Bridget-Anne,Fine.  Very attentive.  Neighborhood a bear to find parking.
3418349,55524750,2015-12-01,49744859,Soraya,The view was brilliant at night. The location was ideal. Loads of good spots to chow down at close by. I had a lovely evening at this Spot.
3418349,55549689,2015-12-01,40032262,Nina,"It's was a last minute booking at Zachary's place due to sudden travel plan changes. Zachary responses to my request almost instantly and gives us instruction about his place. His apartment was perfect (location, clean, and tidy). We really enjoy our stay at Zachary's home. Will recommend people to stay there if they go to Seattle to visit. You can view the space needle right at his balcony window. Walking distance to some awesome local restaurants. Highly recommend. "
3418349,55725704,2015-12-05,47565953,Eleanor,"Great location, very clean, great mattress! "
3418349,56089389,2015-12-08,38518332,Janine,"Zachary was an excellent host, and the apartment was wonderful.  The outside of the building was a little run down but it looks like work is being done to improve it, and you forget all that when you enter the apartment and see the stunning view of the Space Needle and downtown Seattle.  "
3418349,56230448,2015-12-10,50768110,Mario,"Zachary was an amazing host. A buddy and I went to Seattle for a concert and we're looking for a last minute place to stay. Zachary responded within the hour. The apartment looks amazing, great view of Space Needle, great location, and very responsive host. Would definitely recommend to anyone."
3418349,56617863,2015-12-15,2318684,John,"Prompt, courteous responses from Zachary.  Apt was as described.  Easy to find and smooth check in.  Very clean with comfy bed.  Awesome night time view of the city!  Pictures do not do it justice!  Much nicer than pictured.  Space Needle is right there!  Great location for us.  Close to everything we needed!  "
3418349,56722689,2015-12-17,1533204,Christopher,Zachary was exceptional in being so accommodating and available in all his communication with me before and during my stay at his fantastic apartment. The view of the city is stunning and the apartment was very clean and comfortable. Highly recommended!
3418349,56815818,2015-12-18,4648628,Hannah,"As others have highlighted, the views from this apartment are spectacular.  It is a very reasonably priced option to be walking distance from key Seattle destinations like the EMP Museum, the Space Needle, and even the Pike Place Market (about 30 minutes walk).  In fact the views were so great from the apartment, we felt no need to pay to go up in the Space Needle.  There was a grocery store just down the hill that was convenient as well.  While the parking is free, we had to spend some time searching around.  With respect to the interior, this small bachelor pad is adequate, though nothing special in terms of amenities.  For example, the pillows were pancakes, and I agree with a previous guest on the condition of the bathroom tub.  Nevertheless, Zac was a very accommodating and friendly host, and despite the minor drawbacks, we would stay here again."
3418349,57338355,2015-12-24,46901359,Sarah,"This place was incredible!  A block away from bus stops, and 5 blocks from the Seattle center- it doesn't get any better! Plus it is so much more attractive on the inside than the outside."
3418349,57417078,2015-12-25,48453373,Tauseef,"Great host and excellent house. Every guy's dream apartment. Lots of TV channels, great view and most affordable in the city. Highly recommend."
3418349,57614434,2015-12-27,22895511,Eric,Very close to the city with a amazing view.I loved the place and would definitely stay again
3418349,57851963,2015-12-29,30705443,Arvin,Zacs apartment is definitely a clean and cozy quiet place. The hilly area his building is in makes for some pretty amazing views of the space needle and skyline right from his balcony. Short walking distance are a great coffee shop and restaurant (crow) just down the block. I'd definitely stay again when in Seattle.
3418349,57977095,2015-12-30,37287623,동영,"it's nice and convenience apt that can easily access anywhere in downtown Seattle. Needless to say, Zachary, host, took care of us really well. Thank you."
3418349,58409015,2016-01-02,23593795,Pham,"Great view, clean home, and responsive host. It was a sunny day and the patio is great for just relaxing and taking in the warmth. Short walk to the Space Needle and Monorail. "
7648716,41052460,2015-08-03,22886999,Christopher,Mar was super accommodating to my needs and very responsive. Her place is super clean and comfortable and I'd love to stay there again. Even though I didn't get a chance to really hang out with her or chat for very long you can tell she is super cool and chill. 
7648716,41291227,2015-08-05,39984796,Jung Won,"Mari's house is very comfortable,clean,quiet place. And as a traveler in seattle for the first time, she kindly picked me up at the train station. Also she informed that nice place, good restaurant and so on..like a tour guide. I appreciated it.
Someone who will visit seattle, i recommend Mari's house"
7648716,41563356,2015-08-07,9129198,Ye,"This is ordered during my previous stay there because my apartment isn't ready until that Thursday. Still great experience, except the bed just got larger and there was a individual bathroom inside the suite. Even Better:D"
7648716,43692708,2015-08-21,30455667,Darcy,"Such an incredible way to end my stay in the United States! Mari was so accommodating and such a kind soul, when it came to making sure I arrived safely and pointing me in the direction of places to go etc etc. The room was better than the photos and words cannot describe how insanely luxurious the shower is!
My stay was comfortable and enjoyable! Fantastic accommodation that goes hand in hand with a fantastic host! An absolute pleasure :)"
7648716,45313519,2015-09-01,13284950,Shawn,"Mar was an excellent host with a great location! The room & bathroom were both very clean and inviting, the bed was perfect after long days in the city, and parking in the neighborhood was reliable and without difficulty. Mar gave great recommendations for the city and was very welcoming to her home. I will certainly look Mar up next time I need a place to stay in Seattle!"
7616507,41553289,2015-08-07,598892,Winnie,"Clay was such a great host! The place was great and the location was perfect for me and my guests in town. We stayed on the pullout couch and main bedroom which were very comfortable.  The neighborhood is awesome, you can walk to Top Pot Doughnut, Sun Liquor (where we had some amazing cocktails). It's an easy walk to several Capitol Hill bars and restaurants. Downtown and the Market were around a 30 minute walk from the place which was great. 

All and all it was a great experience. We would definitely book with Clay again! "
7616507,41862385,2015-08-09,19797313,Catherine,"Before we arrived, Clay sent us a very detailed guide to local restaurants and bars in the area that he recommended. He had great communication with us the entire time, which was very helpful as we had never been to Seattle. Clay's neighborhood Capitol Hill is full of bars and restaurants and is only a 30 min walk to Downtown (probably a 5 minute taxi ride). We appreciated some local goods (coffee and chocolate) he had waiting for us when we arrived! We had 4 girls and were able to sleep comfortably, 2 on the pull out sofa and 2 in the bedroom. Parking was a little tough in the area but we were trying to park at a busy time (Saturday night). Once parked, we did not have to move our car at all as everything was so easily accessible. Thank you for being such a great host Clay!"
7616507,45732431,2015-09-05,9016894,Courtney,"Clays home was great for our one night in Seattle. He left us coffee and allowed us to check in a few hours early, which was wonderful. The second bedroom contains an air mattress rather than a bed, but it was very comfortable! His home was clean and he was so communicative and helpful. We would definitely stay again! "
7616507,45850147,2015-09-06,3414488,Suraya,"Clay's place is great! It's the ground floor of a house and really quite spacious. We only stayed for one night, but the place would have been very comfortable for a longer stay, even with four or more people. Location is good - only a few streets over from Broadway (which has loads of restaurants and bars). Might be a bit of longish walk into downtown, but was easy for us as we had a car. Clay was great to deal with and attentive. He even left us some coffee out, which was a sweet touch. Would definitely recommend if you're visiting Seattle!"
7616507,46781257,2015-09-13,9913589,Mandy,"Great apartment in an incredible, quiet neighborhood; convenient to many things in Seattle. Clay was very easy to work with and quick to respond. It was great that I was able to bring my pup with me too! Parking is mildly tricky, but once we figured out the streets that do not have permit requirements (explained to us prior to booking), it was a non-issue. I'd definitely return. "
7616507,47935783,2015-09-21,25227565,Margi,Cute & comfortable space in a fantastic location! Very clean & easy to find everything in the kitchen. Clay is a friendly host who gave of lots of helpful information. Highly recommend this listing & would definitely stay here again!
7616507,48718073,2015-09-28,407863,Peter,"Though we never actually met Clay, he made our stay as easy as possible. We were a group of 6 friends with only two couples comfortable sleeping together. Clay provided an additional queen air bed at no extra charge, which fit just fine to the right of the fireplace in the living room. He placed the keys in a secret hiding spot so that we could each obtain our key independently, as we were all arriving separately and then heading out to events. Clay even provided a complimentary pound of coffee with his french press and a delicious bar of chocolate! The North Capitol Hill neighborhood itself was super convenient and very comfortable, and the neighbors upstairs were friendly and easy-going. We couldn't have asked for a better host and location, and I hope to stay here next time I come to Seattle with a large group of friends!"
7616507,50304648,2015-10-11,22053963,Carl,Clay's place was great!! Clay was super responsive and everything went smooth
7616507,50569927,2015-10-12,45780065,Grace,"My group had a great time at Clay's! He made us feel super welcome with handy tips for the house and neighborhood. Parking was really easy. The neighborhood was a perfect location too! You could walk or easily catch a cab to anywhere you could want to go! The house was very comfortable too, and pet friendly, which was perfect for our friends in case they couldn't find a dog sitter. "
7616507,51123710,2015-10-18,34475091,Brandon,"Clay was a great host that was very communicative and helped in each and every way he could.

GREAT apartment and location. Would definitely do it again."
7616507,51934849,2015-10-25,6475001,Gilles,"We had a great time staying at Clay's home. It's very comfortable, beautifully decorated, and of course in a great location. Thanks Clay, I hope I can come back soon!"
7616507,53398300,2015-11-08,31187253,Merrill,Cool spot in a great location!  Clay was very friendly

7616507,55270265,2015-11-29,1199661,Alexis,"Clay was a great host, responsive and welcoming--we had everything we needed, and he let us head out later than the normal departure time, which was much appreciated."
7616507,55841478,2015-12-06,14170584,Brianna,"Clay was very helpful and easy to contact. The place was clean, adorable and perfect for my friends and me. It was very close to all the bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. 

Overall, great stay!"
7616507,57790579,2015-12-29,14294151,Connie,"We did feel welcome in Clay's home; he went out of his way to put up a Christmas tree for us. The neighborhood has many good restaurants within walking distance. The apartment is decorated very nicely, but we found that it wasn't quite right of us 68 year- olds. The mattresses were comfortable, but getting to them was a challenge. He had many luxurious towels in the bathroom, and the shower head was terrific which we all appreciated."
7616507,58369609,2016-01-02,49881492,Alissa,"Everything was awesome!! Great location. Close to so many things. Clay was great and easy to get ahold of, let us arrange a late checkout without any hassle! The neighbors were really nice too, we ran into them for a bit.  The fact that it was dog friendly was so convenient! Would definitely recommend staying here and would stay again myself!"
8995844,55237970,2015-11-29,52061,Bill,Marina was a great host and made my family's visit over thanksgiving easy and fun. It's a beautiful home and the location can't be beat... Across the street from a wonderful park and a few blocks from Wallingford's commercial center. We walked to restaurants two evenings I've the weekend. 
7347229,39846566,2015-07-26,38487915,Eric,"Tim & Michelle offer a very nice apartment with a wonderful view! If you're looking for a place in Seattle, look no further! It's a very convenient location that's close but not too close to the hustle and bustle of the downtown area. The apartment is very well taken care of and they definitely put effort into making it nice for their guests. As a first time AirBnBer, I was slightly nervous. After arriving and meeting Tim, that nervousness cleared as I knew I was in good hands. "
7347229,40154069,2015-07-28,38502133,Dimple,"Dear Readers,

Michelle and Tim have a beautiful place and the pictures and description were highly accurate.  Michelle was my main point of contact prior to coming to Seattle and Tim was my point of contact on site.  Both were quick with responses and professional.  The space is beautiful (and VERY  CLEAN and GREAT VIEWS) and the neighborhood is active full of restaurants and things to do.  Many great restaurants only a few blocks from the space.   I would definitely stay here again. 

Thank you, Michelle and Tim.

7347229,41015739,2015-08-03,34229043,Heather And Mark,"Michelle has a very nice condo with extraordinary views of the sound and Mt. Rainier. The rooftop is also available, and has a 360-degree view of the city (and a putting green, if you're into that). The rooms were spotless, and she included some very thoughtful touches such as a bottle of wine, some snacks after our long flight, and she was available to show us around as soon as we arrived in Seattle.  We would definitely stay here again!  Thanks Michelle!"
7347229,42003423,2015-08-10,37528155,Hanlin,这间公寓非常的不错，离市中心以及我在西雅图要去的钥匙球馆都很近。如果有明年想去观看The International可以选择这间公寓。房东人非常好，公寓设备齐全，非常幸运能在第一次使用airbnb就入住这么好的公寓。
7347229,45111301,2015-08-31,38965889,Debra,"The apartment was lovely and exactly as described.  Michelle was a gracious and accommodating host.

7347229,45971871,2015-09-07,1481733,Birgit,"Perfect, clean and cozy apartment with amazing views and in walking distance to many great restaurants, bars and sights. There's a bus stop right across the apartment building with buses going to Queen Anne, Ballard and Downtown. 
Michelle is a great host, very accommodating, easy to communicate with and fast to respond. 
"
7347229,46742149,2015-09-13,3693020,Richard,"Amazing place to stay in Seattle, close to everything you need to be close to, loads of bars, restaurants etc. The views from the apartment are incredible and if you go to the roof terrace you can see even more. Definitely a great place for all the cool young cats out there! Michelle is an amazing host as well, really recommend booking here."

7347229,48283828,2015-09-25,12424915,Laura,"We didn't get the pleasure of meeting Michelle in person but everything went very smoothly with our trip!  Great location in Belltown and easy to walk to downown, Pike Place, etc. for sightseeing and restaurants. Great views of the sound and downtown! We loved the moden look of the place and everything was very clean and well taken care of.  Amazing rooftop with views for a relaxing morning or nightcap.  We did notice the place was a bit noisy (you can hear everything on that rooftop since you are on the top floor) when it was Friday/Saturday night (2 am ish) and people were out late but thankfully turning on the a/c unit in the place for the night drowned out most of that noise.  Overall, we loved our stay, and spent many an afternoon relaxing there after lots of walking around the city!!  "
7347229,48759566,2015-09-28,20369266,Leigh,"Michelle was a really great host from start to finish. When she greeted us, she showed around the building's premises and let us know of some convenient places nearby. Additionally, she left us a bottle of wine, a sweet welcome note and some snacks to enjoy! The place was decorated so cute and it was really clean. Most importantly, Michelle was really quick to respond to any questions we had. I would definitely recommend staying at one of her places!"

7347229,51364596,2015-10-19,5501417,Brad,"Michelle's place is stunning. The view is truly incredible. You get two views for the price of one! You get to see the downtown seattle skyline to the left and looking straight out you see the whole Pujet Sound. The decoration and styling of the apartment is top notch and Michelle has clearly put a lot of work into designing the apartment. Check in and check out were totally effortless. There is a rooftop patio that is amazing and you can see the Seattle Space Needle perfectly from up there as well as everything else in the city (downtown, Pujet soud etc.) Also, the location of the building is great, in a really clean safe neighborhood with great restaurants and nightlife. The building itself is very funky (in a good way) and it seems like a happening place which helps with the vibe of feeling like you are somewhere truly special. Thanks so much Michelle!"
7347229,52260294,2015-10-27,33115138,Ann,"Great space--wonderfully located! We easily walked to many attractions, and felt very comfortable in Michelle's place. We especially appreciated cookware in the kitchen, so we could make a few dinners and enjoy some fresh food from the Pike Street Market!"

The apartment was in a perfect location in Belltown- very walkable and close to a ton of different cafes, bars and restaurants. "
7347229,56428584,2015-12-13,22992822,Jason,"It's hard to capture how good the view is in this apartment with pictures. The view is even better than the pictures show. I love the apartment and view so much I ended up getting my own apartment in the building. The apartment is excellently furnished and comfortable. Michelle was very accommodating, too."
7347229,57931317,2015-12-30,6344038,Bruce,"I stayed in Michelle's house for 3 nights. It was amazing experience. The house is in top floor of the condo. Walking distance to pike place market and space needle. Super convenient to all the major places.

Michelle is also super responsive and willing to help anytime. Highly recommend!"

6423488,38028399,2015-07-12,10389827,Joanna,"Outstanding on all fronts!! 
Nicole and her wonderful family greeted us as if we were old friends. She had the house beautifully prepared and thoughtfully stocked with everything we could need. 
Her description of it is accurate. It is modern, and very comfortable. 
We were two moms and two sons staying 2 weeks in Seattle. We felt completely safe in Nicole's home and neighborhood. It is about a 15 min. easy bus ride to the downtown area. Very accessible and convenient. 
The ground floor has a cozy bedroom with a queen bed and a full bathroom. Walk up the beautiful wooden stairs to the main floor with a living room, dining room and wonderful kitchen. Up another set of stairs brings you to a bright bedroom, gorgeous bath, laundry, and small deck. 
Check in and out was very easy. 
Nicole really did take care of everything, and we truly appreciate her sharing her home with us. 
Would highly recommend Nicole and this house to anyone looking for a beautiful, safe, friendly, easy place to stay in Seattle. Cheers!"
6423488,38747249,2015-07-18,35984826,Chris,"Nicole, Cale and their precious kids are phenomenal hosts! We received such a warm and gracious welcome upon our arrival, we wished they would stay :)
Their home is lovely and extremely well appointed. The location has easy access to public transit downtown. Their neighbors are delightful, super friendly and helpful. We loved every minute and would love to return next time we're in Seattle."
6423488,39214858,2015-07-21,23697708,Adrian,"The place was amazing, walking distance to great spots felt right at home. Would definitely recommend this to anyone else."
6423488,39789639,2015-07-26,9719638,J + G,"Nice modern home in an up-and-coming neighborhood! All the amenities and tons of parking. We are really easygoing and liked the euro feel of the set-up but just a heads up for people that are particular about privacy or noise, it faces a shared courtyard and a lot of the windows don't have blinds or curtains so you can see and hear everyone and they can see/hear you BUT the neighbors were really friendly and there isn't much action overnight. Oh also, amazing white towels and sheets, always a plus!"
6423488,42200061,2015-08-11,25391848,Alexander,"Nicole and Cale's home was very comfortable and accommodating.  I'm pleased with my stay.  Their house is very close to the International District.  Also, it's a quick Uber ride to Capitol Hill and Downtown.  Very easy to grab a Car2Go in the neighborhood.  If you feel like riding a bike, then there's a Prontocycle bike station down the street."
4023177,33735316,2015-05-31,15684810,Jamie,"Absolutely unforgettable experience! Great location just minutes away from the ballard ave. in a hip neighborhood not too far from the beach too! The house was absolutely lovely and we had lots of room to spread out. Joe is one of our favorite airbnb hosts and gave us excellent recommendations for bars, restaurants, things to do etc. He's such a cool dude with so many awesome stories to tell so getting to know him was one of the highlights of our trip. If you're lucky enough to have dinner with his family, there are some excellent chefs in the house!"
4023177,34382344,2015-06-07,1406509,Justin,Joe was a wonderful host. He's very accommodating and has spot on recommendations for where to go in Ballard. The room itself provides plenty of room for one or two and has air conditioning which was critical on the hotter days. Would highly recommend for anyone who wants to get to know Ballard. 
4023177,34594596,2015-06-09,6225193,Maayan,"Joe and his family were wonderful hosts! We felt very welcome in their lovely home and cozy up on their third floor. Their home is in a great location with easy parking and access to the rest of the city.  Even though it was a rare heat wave in Seattle, there was an air conditioning unit in the room that we turned on for a bit before bed which was perfect. We received great food tips (Salmon Bay Cafe!) and advice about the community and city in general. What a pleasure! We'd happily stay with Joe and his family again. "
4023177,34747764,2015-06-11,14008342,Maren,"Staying at Joe's Place was exactly the right thing to do in Seattle. Joe was very helpful, he picked us up at the Bus Station and showed us interesting parts of Seattle. He seems to know everything about this City. Very interesting. His whole Family was very welcoming. We had an excellent time.  "
4023177,34899838,2015-06-13,3378897,Bryan,"We had a very pleasant stay at Joe’s. He and his wife were extremely welcoming and went out of their way to answer all our questions. The room was both comfortable and quiet, and Ballard is a perfect location for exploring the city. It’s a great place to stay. I highly recommend staying here."
4023177,35845791,2015-06-22,34688318,Matthew,"Joe was an exemplary host. He was very welcoming and was interested to hear about what we had planned to see and do in Seattle. Location is great, lots to see an do within walking distance. 

Joe knows where to go! He recommended several great places to visit and eat at and made us feel totally at home. "
4023177,36810918,2015-07-01,13416185,April,"We had a very good stay at Joe's house.  It was GREAT value for the price. The location was excellent and the baby didn't cry much while we were there. Everything was VERY neat and clean. No trouble parking in front of the house every night. The family was quite nice and we had the privacy we wanted.

At first we were unhappy to have to share their bathroom, but it actually turned out fine. We were able to use it every time we wanted and it was very clean. The shower had good pressure and lots of hot water.

We would certainly stay there again."
4023177,37086316,2015-07-04,35897624,Christina,Joe was the first person we ever book with. He was avaliable to talk to and quick to respond to messages. He gave suggestions for the area. He and his family were wonderful.

Joe had great suggestions for the Ballard area, and we appreciated the openness of their house. Their home is warm and super artistic. The kids were great, and super cute as well. If you're in Seattle and love interacting with a wonderful family, this is your spot! Thanks so much, Joe, for being so wonderful and we hope to come back to Seattle soon."
4023177,37890859,2015-07-11,17017598,William,"Joe is a warm and welcoming host who does not resemble his photograph.  The room feels private on an upper floor and was clean and comfortable. An AC helped cool it down. The shared bathroom is on the main floor. We would have liked the bath to be a bit cleaner. Still, we would be happy to return. The neighborhood (Ballard) is great."
4023177,38305146,2015-07-14,27694447,Heidi,"Joe and his family made us feel right at home!  The room was comfortable and clean. The house is in a great location to explore the Ballard neighborhood by foot, and convenient to getting around the rest of the Seattle area.  Joe had wonderful suggestions for restaurants and things to see and do around Ballard - we really got a taste of the neighborhood rather than being in a hotel in the midst of tourist attractions. This was a really unique way to experience Seattle!"
4023177,38563467,2015-07-16,13258902,Maiko,"Joe was a great host and he provided us with all the information we needed to discover the neighborhood and the rest of Seattle. The location was great, too. We took the bus into the city from just around the block, and there is much to see in walking distance. It was also nice that we had our own little space on the 2nd floor. "
4023177,39047190,2015-07-20,36365586,Helen,"The listing was just as described, lots of room for me and my travel companion.  Joe was very accommodating to my erratic travel schedule.  I'd book with him again. "
4023177,39840122,2015-07-26,38033779,Mason,"I had every intention of hanging out upstairs and doing my own thing  for the duration of my stay, but Joe's family were so friendly and kept drawing me in for conversation.  An excellent host, and their house is at a great location for using the bus!"
4023177,39969417,2015-07-27,34931135,Lauren,"Joe was very friendly and welcoming.  He answered any questions we had, made suggestions and helped to point us in the right direction.  The house is in a nice area of the city with a great Sunday farmers market.  The room was clean and comfortable.  "

The location was also great for exploring both the neighborhood and the city of Seattle. Bus stop is just walking distance from Joe's house. Joe and his wife had wonderful suggestions for things to do during our stay. Their kids are super cute as well! 
Joe's wonderful family made my mom and me feel very comfortable at home. I highly recommend staying at Joe's place if you come to Seattle."
4023177,41218171,2015-08-05,26265218,Nora,Cannot recommend this place enough! The house was within walking distance to an incredible assortment of stores and restaurants. Who needs downtown Seattle? Joe was ridiculously accommodating and always willing to offer amazing advice on what to see and do. The upstairs area was clean and comfortable. No complaints! 
4023177,41439135,2015-08-07,38677565,Christine,Joe made us feel at home by putting up with our difficult travel schedule and giving us great advice on things to do in the city.  House was clean and is a short bus ride to downtown seattle. Also walking distance to great bars and restaurants. 
4023177,41969453,2015-08-10,2192,Sarah,"Joe is a « natural » host, making people feel instantly welcomed. He was always available when we had questions and of good company. About staying in Ballard, we were at first a bit afraid to be far from downtown Seattle. But the public transportation work just well and Ballard is a sympathetic place to discover."
4023177,42948349,2015-08-16,40297973,Joanna,Joe and his family were very welcoming. Accommodations were simple and great. We didn't need much. He also shared some space in the fridge for some food items and snacks we bought. The location was easy to find and the neighborhood was quiet with lots of restaurants and bars not too far away. We felt comfortable there and would definitely stay there again! He is what everyone has said and more. As Airbnb lists...a super host for sure!
4023177,43272122,2015-08-18,19294771,Claire,"This listing is in a great location for people looking to check out the Ballard area. Every restaurant and brewery we wanted to hit was a 5-10 minute Uber ride away. It was also really convenient to get to Pike Place, Chihuly, and other central sites.

While we didn't get to meet Joe because he was out of town, he arranged for someone else to let us into the house. He was flexible with our late arrival time, and the spacious, clean bedroom and bathroom were exactly what we needed to get our bearings after a long day of driving. We were able to park in the driveway because no one else was home, but there's also plenty of street parking right outside the house.

Our stay in Seattle was only two nights, but we would definitely recommend this listing!"
4023177,43414404,2015-08-19,39540740,Charlotte And Jon,Very comfortable and welcoming home.

Our baby had a blowout in the car and Joe immediately set us up for a bath in the baby tub. Beds were comfy, room was clean, we felt comfortable staying here. He suggested a variety of downtown Ballard restaurants, we ended up eating at the Kickin' Boot for dinner. I loved talking to his wife who was also nursing a young baby at the time, I felt like I could really relate to our hosts. Our son enjoyed playing with theirs and Joe made us a cup of coffee on our way out to Seattle."
4023177,44007755,2015-08-23,37898876,Phillip,"I arrived at Joe's later than I thought so I didn't have a lot of time there. I found the family kind and inviting. I had an early morning but  Joe offered me a chance to go grab a pint with him and his brother at a local pub and pinball. The place was great . After hanging with these two I'm sure I'll be back to Joe's on my next trip through Seattle. Location is walking distance to food,shops and local brew."

4023177,44384810,2015-08-25,1971733,Caroline,"Joe is a very nice host, and he had me laughing as soon as he opened the door.  :)  He was very welcoming, showed me our upstairs rooms (both very sweet), bathroom and the general set up, and from there we had some fun conversations, for the little time we were actually there. We're hosts too and needed a place to stay for the night.  His home is very close to Ballard (just less than a mile or so), and has good street access to the rest of the City.  A good place to stay for sure!"

4023177,45751588,2015-09-05,5511235,Thomas,"We spent two nights at Joe's place in Seattle, Ballard neighborhood. Joe and his family are very welcoming, nice hosts! We had a nice time there. There's a bus stop really close to Joe's place: it takes about half an hour with the bus number 40 to downtown Seattle. In Ballard neighborhood on walking distance there are a lot of nice pubs and restaurants! It's good for a weekend in Seattle! If you're booking last minute, Joe will be ready to answer you request and help you! Recommended!"

7581974,41274642,2015-08-05,39700144,Ellen,"Mari did an excellent job of making me feel immediately welcome to Seattle. Throughout my entire stay she was a constant source ideas and a wealth of knowledge about the area. Mari was very pleasant to talk to clearly cared about making sure her guests were well taken care of. 

Her house and the individually rented rooms were very well taken care of and a joy to stay in. There is roof access to a beautiful view of the surrounding neighborhoods. The location is a very easy uber, bus or (long) walk to downtown.  I enjoy walking so I did a combination of all three during my time at her house. 

This stay was definitely the highlight of visit. I highly recommend this Air BNB! "
7581974,41851927,2015-08-09,39386929,Khalid,"Mari was an amazing host. She went above and beyond making sure my stay was pleasant, and it was very much so! The house was modern, clean, and impeccable. She afforded such a pleasure by offering helping helpful tips and information about the city and local expertise. This was my first time in Seattle, and I have to thank my host for making it a memorable experience. Looking forward to staying there again!"
7581974,42038451,2015-08-10,38977595,Caleb,"Mar was a PHENOMENAL host! Before our arrival she was great with the communication. Upon our arrival, she was extremely friendly, welcoming, and accommodating - she had homemade chocolates waiting for us in our room, and offered to drive us into the city when we wanted to go grab lunch so we didn't have to pay for an Uber. After we had lunch we came back to her home to fresh-baked cookies. After that, we ended up spending the next couple hours just hanging out with Mar in which she drove us around the lake, showed us some Seattle landmarks, and ended up dropping us off right where we needed to go. We had great conversation and Mar aided it making the trip one to remember! 

Couples things to note for future guests:
1) This is definitely a ""shared economy"" experience. Mar puts several of her rooms on Airbnb at a time so you could have others also staying in the place at the same time you do. 
2) That being said, because it is a shared household, guests should not expect ""hotel-like"" neatness in the common areas. 
3) The mattress in the room that I stayed in wasn't super comfortable for me, but that is person-specific and definitely not the worst thing I've slept on. Just a little thinner than I prefer. 
These things didn't bother us whatsoever, but just something to know. 

Overall, the stay was amazing and I would definitely recommend Mar's Airbnb listings. "
7581974,42353351,2015-08-12,40732377,Vaughn,"The house was very clean and felt welcoming. The host was very kind, helpful, and friendly. The pictures don't give the listing justice. It is a VERY pretty home. She cooked me rice, gave me coffee, and left chocolates on my pillow. One of the best places I've ever stayed in."
7581974,43132754,2015-08-17,11325869,Hio San,"Mar is really a good host and good mother. Her sons are lovely and very helpful. The room we live is quite comfortable. The house is more beautiful than we saw in the photo. In general, I highly recommend you to stay at Mar's house if you waana travel to Seattle. Everything in her house is excellent and fantastic. Also, the location is very convenient, few minutes walk to the bus stop!! "
7581974,44473552,2015-08-26,4628475,Caleb,We loved our stay at Mar's place in the Central District.  Mar was thoughtful and put fresh flowers in our room and gifted my girlfriend an oragami bird and a cookbook (it was her birthday).  The accomodations were simple and clean. We would stay here again.
7581974,45026766,2015-08-30,41930972,Carlos Agustin,Mar is an awesome host she offered me a ride when I was stuck in an airport because of an inconvenience I had with the car rental company. She has a great attitude to help you if you are having a a problem.
7581974,45400526,2015-09-02,4957160,Fran,"We had a great time staying in Mar's home.  She was a fantastic host that went above and beyond to make our first trip to Seattle wonderful.

The room was clean and well-kept and well worth the price.  I would recommend this room without reservations."
5652705,35013167,2015-06-14,34764614,Johnny,"I'm really glad I choose to stay here.  It was perfect.  I was able to walk to my work, restaurants and it's a beautiful neighborhood.  "
5652705,35572261,2015-06-20,13749355,Casey,"Lovely little cottage on a street really close to great food, and drink. Very comfortable space, and extremely cute. Perfect for a couple. Highly recommend!"
5652705,49307831,2015-10-03,6305669,Katie,"Great little place near all the good stuff in West Seattle. I stayed here with my friend for three months during a work assignment. It does have air conditioning, which was a real life saver during Seattle's unseasonably warm summer. The kitchen has all the essentials to make a really nice meal. We particularly enjoyed grilling in the back yard. The area is very quiet and safe. We kept the windows open during the entire summer and never worried about it. Laura and Joe were very receptive and available if we needed anything. 

It's just a 10 min drive over the West Seattle Bridge to enjoy all of downtown Seattle's offerings. I would definitely consider taking the ferry from West Seattle (Seacrest Park) to downtown. It drops you off right near Pike Place. That way you can see all of the touristy things without paying $15 for parking.

All in all, this place was just wonderful. I would absolutely recommend staying in this adorable 100 year old cottage."
5652705,55578483,2015-12-02,47903579,Laura,"The cottage is a perfect home away from home. Cozy, quiet, comfortable, well-stocked and close to everything. Laura and Joe were very helpful and responded to my questions within a few minutes, even on a holiday weekend. I would definitely stay here again!"
5652705,55814987,2015-12-06,21065410,Benjamin,"Laura was a terrific host! The cottage was clean, lovely and exactly as it was described. It was just just what my girlfriend and I were looking for. Laura even brought over a hairdryer during our stay. I'd recommend the cottage to anyone looking to spend some time in Seattle. "
699460,2617170,2012-10-15,2637199,Lisa,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Patti & Benson's place. The location could not be better...close enough for an easy walk to the restaurants and shops on Market and Ballard, but far enough away to enjoy the peace and quiet of a nice residential neighborhood. The property itself is terrific. Although Patti works from here, you pretty much have the run of the place. There is a functioning kitchen, should you decide not to avail yourself of the many great places nearby to eat. (There is a very good grocery store just a few blocks away.) The bedroom is quite comfortable, with lots of closet space. Free Wi-Fi is provided. There is ample space to move around, and a nice outside area, when the weather cooperates. Be aware that there is no TV, so if you need outside stimulus, bring a book!. This property is best for adults and older children. Much of Patti’s work is on display and would be irresistible to little ones, and there would be no way  to child-proof the place. There is a very narrow, somewhat steep stairway going to the upstairs, which could prove hazardous to small children. Finally, Patti and Benson are the most thoughtful of hosts and went out of their way to make sure my visit was perfect. And it was. I will most certainly stay with them again when my travels take me to the Seattle area. "
699460,2668472,2012-10-20,3818812,Matthis,"An absolutely extraordinary place with extraordinary hosts - it was truly an honor to stay at this gorgeos B&B! The house is located in Ballard, a nice, independent neighborhood north of Seattle Downtown. You will find a cosy, newly renovated bedroom with hand selected interior - so if your sense for design goes beyond IKEA and favours real wooden furniture from earlier times, this is your place! As the house is quite spacious and offers a fully furnished kitchen, you can easily stay here for more than a couple of days.
Patti and Benson are very kind and helpful - we couldn´t image better hosts! It was very interesting to learn sth about their art work.

"
699460,2683294,2012-10-22,760772,Mayna,"Patti and Benson were very helpful, personable hosts.  The space is great - a tastefully decorated heritage house in a quaint neighbourhood with great light.  The hosts were able to accommodate an extra guest in the second bedroom just a week before we arrived.  Ballard is a lovely neighbourhood and the Sunday farmers market is not to be missed.  "
699460,2726562,2012-10-26,1901246,Patrick,"Wonderful location. The artist's studio is spacious, neat, beautiful and quirky - exactly why we love airbnb. The owners are very thoughtful, pleasant and responsive. We loved the space and Patti's ongoing art projects are delightful to look at. My wife bought a clever little necklace and gets many comments on it. 

Ballard is a great Seattle community, with plenty of restaurants, coffee houses and cool shops, all within easy walking distance of Patti and Benson's place. Highly recommended."
699460,2755340,2012-10-29,2407529,Yishai,"This was our first AirBnB experience and we could not have been happier. Patti responded to our inquiry within less than 10 minutes and we confirmed the reservation shortly thereafter. 
Staying here allowed us to be within 3 blocks from our event in an area that has few other lodging options. After staying in their studio, we would choose to return even if other options were available.
The space was clean and tastefully decorated with Patti's beautiful art pieces. The bedrooms are up a narrow flight of stairs while the bathroom is right at the bottom of the stairs on the main level.
Patti uses the space as her art studio yet was very respectful of our privacy.
On Sunday morning, a plate of home baked brownies appeared with a lovely note.

We hope to stay at Patti & Benson's studio again soon. 
"
699460,2867582,2012-11-12,3969714,Katie,"Patti and Benson are gracious and helpful hosts. The opportunity to see Patti's art work added to the experience, and she was forthcoming about her work schedule so sharing the kitchen and bathroom was easy. The private bedroom are gleaming bathroom are very comfortable; the whole house is a work of art. You will enjoy this corner of Ballard creativity with Patti and Benson."
699460,2911830,2012-11-18,3437131,Monique,"On very short notice Patti and Benson were able to accommodate us in their beautiful Art studio.  Patti's communication was very prompt and friendly.  We only stayed the night but wish we had stayed longer.  A very spacious, commfortable house with plenty of hidden treasures.  I would highly recommend to stay.... I feel inspired!  Thank you Patti and Benson."
699460,2964440,2012-11-26,1966133,Alison,"Our stay in Ballard was everything we had hoped for. Patti and Benson provide a welcoming, tidy, and inspiring accommodation that is in the heart of such a great neighborhood. I'll never rent a hotel room again! It was a great pleasure meeting them both. I hope to visit again, real soon."
699460,2993623,2012-11-29,949375,Monica,"Patti is an excellent hostess. Her artist's studio is immaculate and cozy. There is a great amount of detail and beauty to the space that really made my stay enjoyable. Walking distance to Ballard Avenue shops and amenities, the neighborhood is a gem. I would love to return in the future!"
699460,3022473,2012-12-03,1123249,Lucy,"We had a wonderful (but too short!) visit staying in Patti and Benson's beautiful studio. They were kind and responsive from the first email, and very welcoming to us when we arrived. We can't wait to find another excuse to come to Seattle to stay with them! 

Also, the place itself is absolutely stunning. Every room is thoughtfully and meticulously decorated in simple, elegant and handmade detail. It is an old house, with broad wooden floors and warm light. The bed is very comfortable -- with both slept like babies. I could go on and on about this location. Truly unique, and perfectly priced. Thank you Patti and Benson for our one-night visit! We'd love to stay with you in the future.

699460,3450602,2013-02-01,3608716,Martha,"I booked Patti & Benson's home as a lovely place for my family to stay when they visited us (we live in Ballard) after the birth of our child.  My mother and mother in law both stayed there and it was perfect.  I wanted somewhere nice, comfortable, and safe for them.  Patti was great to work with while making the reservation and during their stay.  She is kind, helpful, and very responsive but not in an intrusive way - the guests always had their privacy and space.  Our family will happily stay here again any time they come to visit us in Ballard.  As a local, I can also attest this this home being very close (a few blocks walk) to everything you'd want to see and do in Ballard and an easy location for driving/visiting the rest of Seattle.  I can't thank them enough for making everything so easy and comfortable."

I highly recommend staying at this bnb. It is on a quiet neighborhood street, but just a few blocks walk from great restaurants and cages and the Sunday's farmers' market.  Patti and Benson were extremely attentive to our needs. Thanks again!"
699460,3620754,2013-02-26,4418071,Daniel,"Patti & Benson's house is spacious and warm, bright and clean, and filled with the diverse art of Patti's.  The decor and cleanliness makes the atmosphere very calming and serene and relaxing. 

 The location is a quick block or two from the bustle of Ballard, with shops, restaurants, and all else within walking distance.   I found my stay easy, and all the evening and mornings, you have the place entirely to yourself.  Great and easy parking spot around back.   

As a host, Patti was warm, informative and communicated quickly each time. She was also very accommodating and flexible to some changing needs.   

All in all a great experience. "
699460,3682649,2013-03-04,1932029,Diana,"Patti and Benson were wonderful, flexible hosts, and their studio was cozy and unique. I loved staying among artworks, it was like having our own little museum. The space is comfortable, in a great location and is a beautiful old craftsman house. I'd love to stay again!"

"
699460,3741326,2013-03-10,572132,Carly,"This space was so lovely- it was spotlessly clean and cozy, full of neat art and just a few blocks from great restaurants bars and shopping. We found free parking in front of the house, stopped for (excellent) coffee at a shop a block away and had a great afternoon browsing the neat shops in Ballard before hitting a show at one of the many bars down near market street. Great weekend! (And I wouldn't miss trying brunch at the portage bay cafe- it was outrageous!!)"
699460,3785514,2013-03-14,2543111,Angelika,"Fascinating experience, very high energy spot, super sophisticated hosts that embody the spirit of Seattle.  Very comfortable bed, a great place to reflect for anyone.  -An added thrill was seeing Patti's artwork hanging in a gallery as I was out exploring the nightlife of a very spirited and honest place.  "
699460,4084503,2013-04-08,5612455,Teresa,"Patti was very prompt in communicating with me.  The space was absolutely lovely, very light and bright.

699460,4610502,2013-05-15,3211932,Carole,"I had a wonderful stay at Patti & Benson's darling accommodation.  It was comfortable, neat, clean and in Ballard, a quiet area of Seattle.  Best of all it was just blocks from my daughter's efficiency.  I spent my time with her and so did not get to try out the kitchen which was fully stocked with cooking utensils.  The back garden offered a sweet seating area with possibility for outdoor eating.  While I was staying by myself there was another room available should there have been 2 of me.  Thanks, Patti & Benson, for the comfortable, lovely place to stay.  "
699460,4676227,2013-05-20,135638,Cynthia,"What a sweet place! Patti was a great host and her space is adorable. Perfect. Charming. I was only sad to have such a short visit. 

Frankly, I think I'll plan another trip to Seattle just so I can stay here longer! 

A great neighborhood with lots of cool shops, cafes and restaurants. I loved the pastry and coffee I had at Cafe Bresalu on Sunday morning!

Highly recommended. "

The neighborhood, Ballard, has great stores and restaurants and it is a 20min bus ride from downtown Seattle. It has some great features live Ballard Ave and the Chittenden Locks within walking distance. 
And Patti and Benson are very good hosts and smart Seattlelites with great taste. Thanks Patti, thanks Benson, we will be back!"
699460,4903391,2013-06-01,5889960,Kerry,"I can't speak highly enough about my stay at Patti's and Benson's place in Ballard. Patti is a gracious host who made my stay a delightful experience. The house is lovely; spacious, exquisitely furnished and decorated and, of course, filled with artworks. Bed and bathroom perfect. Patti gave me excellent guidance on where to go locally to provision myself for my all too brief stay. I spent a lot of time working as I was on my way to a conference. Patti also worked in her studio and it was great to be in a place of art practice. Ballard's a great neighbourhood and a lovely place to be in Seattle. Thanks Patti and Benson. I hope I can come back sometime! "
