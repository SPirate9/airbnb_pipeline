The location couldn't be any more perfect, literally walking distance to everything as well as local transportation which is super easy. Felix has tons to recommend and was quick to response to my text if and when needed.

I will definitely would recommend staying at Felix's."
4760181,28235006,2015-03-20,23338772,Aman,"I need a place to stay in urgency Felix came through great host.Very nice and quite place in safe neighborhood,Beautiful dogs very friendly. I will recommended Felix place to everyone looking for a spot in Fremont,Ballard area.   "
4760181,28424971,2015-03-23,7409338,Jesse,"What an awesome location from which to see Seattle! John and I had no trouble checking in, and with the free Lyft rides from Felix, we saw so much of the city! Felix was great about talking us through the different neighborhoods so that we could have a more authentic experience. He even drove us to Ballard so we could walk to the beach!

The room we had originally booked was actually being renovated while we were there, so we stayed in the larger upstairs room, which was just perfect for the 2 of us! I will say, although there were construction noises, they only started at a very reasonable time, and we were never disturbed. Felix was very generous about sharing snacks and beverages, and his dogs were extremely allergen-free and well behaved. I would not hesitate to recommend Felix for a future stay! "
4760181,28839303,2015-03-30,29624229,Ross,"Felix was a great host! He made me feel right at home. His place is very nice, new, clean and comfortable. His dogs are very friendly and playful! He showed me around the neighborhood which was great! 

If you want to explore Seattle, stay here! He is close to great coffee shops, restaurants, and parks. If you like to run, he is a short distance from Green Lake which has a nice joggers track! Stop at Beth's for some Brunch after!"
4760181,29549679,2015-04-09,25808452,Molly,"Staying with Felix was awesome!  It really did feel like I was coming ""home"" each night.  The room was spacious and comfortable.  It was nice having the TV and internet available.  The bathroom was clean and had a really nice shower head.  Upstairs the complimentary keurig coffee was a nice treat. Felix was really helpful giving advice on neighborhoods, restaurants, and hikes to check out!"
4760181,29833722,2015-04-13,130500,Marna,"Felix was busy when we first arrived, but his friend Khloe greeted us and showed us our room and common living space of this attractive condo very conveniently located only a few blocks from our daughter's home and performance venue, both on Phinney Ridge. We soon met Felix, the dogs, and were made to feel welcome.  Felix introduced us to an impressive app (August Smart Lock) for access to his place and helped me install it on my iphone. Sweet!  Our busy schedule kept us out a lot, but we enjoyed our stay and would gladly return."
4760181,30090155,2015-04-17,20905257,Kimberly,"My boyfriend and I loved our stay with Felix! The room was downstairs with its own bathroom, incredibly soft sheets (double points), a sliding door to outside and a TV. Perfect little home-away-from home with some privacy. The space is just a hop-skip and jump from some of the greatest treasures of Seattle (take the bus anywhere and you'll be there within 15 minutes). 

Felix was a completely gracious host. He had snacks and coffee for us and gave us advice on the what-to-dos of Seattle. His two pups are to-die-for adorable and will become your new best friends. 

Felix gave us great conversations and a great space for our quick stay in Seattle. He was always prompt to respond with questions and made sure we were well taken-care of. 

If you're looking for a place to kick-back with a bit of privacy (or great conversations about the start-up world and beyond), I highly recommend Felix :) We'll absolutely stay again when we visit Seattle!"
4760181,30321384,2015-04-20,29950621,Kyla,"Our stay with Felix was great! The room was lovely and clean, and the location was great. Felix was helpful and accommodating."
4760181,30482956,2015-04-22,381014,Amado,"Felix is the man. Although I did not get to interact w/ him too much because of my tight schedule, the times I did were great. He was extremely hospitable and very willing to help me w/ anything I needed. The place is in a great neighborhood convenient to the best Seattle has to offer. I will definitely look up his place again when I'm back in town and would recommend it to anyone who is visiting!"
4760181,30833652,2015-04-27,31560058,Rhian,My friend and I enjoyed our stay at Felix's place.  Felix was a wonderful  host.  We enjoyed chatting with him about activities  in the Seattle area and were grateful for the Keurig coffee that was provided for us each morning.  
4760181,31018035,2015-04-30,31877778,Sarah,"All around, it was a very pleasant stay. Felix & his roommates went out of their way to make us feel comfortable in our home away from home, & even included several free maps of the area which were very helpful! I would definitely stay there again. "
4760181,31378162,2015-05-04,25418369,Emmie,It was a great stay! Very easy to work with Felix and have our needs met. His roommate was also very to work with so that was great. Great dogs!
4760181,31602213,2015-05-07,27455618,Alexandra,"We had a great time at Felix's place in Seattle. The room is comfortable and clean and the apartment is very conveniently located. We didn't get to spend much time with Felix, but he was always helpful and made us feel welcome in his home. "
4760181,31814826,2015-05-10,1458083,Kyle,Felix townhouse is located in great convenience location. He was very help in getting us settled
4760181,32250847,2015-05-16,20941645,Cesar,"Felix was a great host with lots of tips for our trip, including dining and breweries. There are 8+breweries in his neighborhood alone! If your in town for that, this is a great place to start ( or end up for the night hehe) We had our own downstairs living quarters along with bathroom. Simple room with bed and tv. What else do you need?  Very clean room. You can use his fridge if need be. His dogs were super friendly and did not disturb you in your part of the house, unless you allow them to. Shirt walking distance from public trasportation. I highly recommend this place. Thank you Felix for having us!"
4760181,32576195,2015-05-19,3851545,Brian,"Felix and his pups were kind and gracious hosts. Being international travelers without wifi/cell service in the States produced a separate set of challenges, but Felix was very responsive in ensuring that we had everything we needed to feel comfortable. Neighborhood is neatly out of the way but within walking distance of Ballard and Fremont. We had a great time staying with Felix and are already looking forward to visiting again!"
4760181,32784969,2015-05-21,2402240,Steve,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience at Felix's place. We were already familiar with Seattle and we were busy throughout our stay so we didn't get a chance to interact much with Felix and his roommates. In the time we did talk to Felix, he was friendly and accommodating. The room itself was cozy and comfortable."
4760181,33116882,2015-05-25,6677749,James,Had a really nice stay in Seattle which was enhanced by Felix and his girlfriend with really nice and private room downstairs as well as really good tips and suggestions on places to go out and eat 
4760181,33397076,2015-05-27,7131656,Bri,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Felix for two nights and had a great time! Both Felix and his girlfriend were very welcoming and kind, and their dogs are great as well. The entire apartment was immaculate, and driving to different parts of Seattle was easy in this location. It was great to have access to coffee and snacks in the kitchen as well. I would stay here again if I was in the area!"
4760181,33812867,2015-06-01,18917994,Iris,"My boyfriend and I stay 3 nights in Felix's house. It is a cute little room in a pretty nice house, tidy and clean. Bus station is just at the other side of the street and it is very close to Ballard downtown. Felix has a magic check in and check out process. Check it out!!"
4760181,34009223,2015-06-03,2559357,Tony,Felix communicated well and met me at the agreed time...was very courteous and showed me the room and the upstairs amenities...room was just as described and very comfortable...neighborhood is close to everything...great value ...i would recommend highly
4760181,34331753,2015-06-07,22792,Leigh,"Felix is lovely. He took the time to get to know me and chat. He was very open to talking about Seattle but as I lived there for 35 years we just chatted. :)
The room is lovely and the bed comfy. It's very private with all the right touches to make you feel right at home. 
His kitchen is stocked with snacks and tea and coffee.
His roommate and lady were very friendly and welcoming as well. AND THE POOCHES are darling! Great playmates with sweet kisses all around!
I will definitely stay there again. Thank you , Felix!"
4760181,34580110,2015-06-09,3758593,Astrid,"Beautiful, clean room with a comfortable bed. The private bathroom is defenitely a plus. Felix has been very hospitable, his dogs are sweet and well-trained. His house is located in a great neighborhood and public transport to downtown is nearby. We had a great stay!"
4760181,34872027,2015-06-13,699741,Susi,"Felix is readily available to share both his home and his passion for his town. Very accommodating and generous with his time. As a guest, you are treated like an old friend from college moreso than a stranger. The space is quiet and well equipped. I especially appreciated Felix's extensive hospitality. I would greatly recommend a stay in the private suite. The location is terrific to access park and neighboring downtown Ballard. Don't miss Slate coffee! Thank you Felix! You made my stay what it was!"
4760181,35220151,2015-06-16,17082774,Walter,"My girlfriend and I stayed at Felix's home for 3 nights and it was wonderful. It's in a great safe area with plenty of things within walking distance. 

The bed was super comfortable, the best one we stayed on while on our 18 day trip, also the room and bathroom were very clean! 

Felix showed us around thoroughly when we arrived and introduced us to his wonderful two boxers! They are super awesome dogs, love to be pet, but will also give you your space if you need it. We couldn't get enough of them! 

Felix was a fantastic host, he had friends over often during dinner time and urged us to join them in watching one of the NBA finals games with them at the house! He is very outgoing and great to talk to about things to do in the area. Just a cool laid back guy! 

If you're in the Seattle are I highly recommend staying with Felix! You definitely won't find anywhere better. So glad we stayed here instead of the city! "
4760181,35486037,2015-06-19,34179950,Cory,"We stayed with Felix for three nights and had a great time. He is a wonderful host and has two adorable and super friendly boxers. Felix made sure that we had everything needed, provided us with lots of great tips on where to go and how to get about, and even organized our transfer to the airport. Our flight went at 5 am, which means we had to get picked up in the middle of the night. Everything went very smoothly."
4760181,35669291,2015-06-21,26310713,Dakin,"Felix is an wonderfully gracious host. His taste in coffee is impeccable, and the room itself was clean, bright, and very private. It was about as optimal as the experience could be.  "
4760181,36210196,2015-06-26,8035876,Stephanie,The apartment was great on the lowest level. Neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. The walk to the main strip in Ballard (where the yoga studios and restaurants are) was about 20-25 minutes. I needed a blow dryer and was promptly met with one upon request. This location is also not far from public bus transportation. Felix and Khloe were also very nice and welcoming.
4760181,36884233,2015-07-02,8648118,Stephanie,"We enjoyed our stay with Felix immensely!  Felix & Chloe were very welcoming and helpful.  We happened to be visiting during a heat wave, and the air conditioning unit in our room was AMAZING!  The room had everything we needed:  a private bathroom, a sliding door to the patio, and was also nicely tucked away on the bottom floor.  It was really a wonderful stay.  Also, we enjoyed Felix's boxers, Kai & Karma.  They were so sweet and well-mannered! 

If you have any questions about Seattle or the surrounding areas, Felix is your guy.  We've been interested in moving to Seattle for a while, so we had a bunch of questions.  He was very patient and informative :)

Stay here!  It was in a great location, a great value, and great people (and dogs)!"
4760181,37468082,2015-07-07,18669517,Allan,"We really enjoyed our stay at Felix's place. It's in a great location for getting downtown, with a bus just outside. Felix made sure we had everything we needed and was keen to suggest ideas for where to go. The place was reply clean and the snacks were great to have for making sure we didn't go hungry. Felix's dogs are fantastic fun and very well natured and I really wanted to take them with me when I left!Many thanks, Felix!"
4760181,38124597,2015-07-13,20195178,Joshua,"Our trip started out nice with easy access to the room thanks to the door lock app. Felix was out of town when we got there but arranged for his girlfriend to welcome us. The room was very simple and just what we needed. The air conditioner is the room felt so nice. The TV was a good size and had plenty of channels, perfect for winding down at the end of the day while getting comfy in the extremely comfortable bed with soft sheets. Although we didn't really take advantage of it, having complimentary coffee and snacks in the common area helped us feel more welcomed and more likely to go upstairs. The dogs were totally kickass and it was nice to be greeted by them. The house was extremely close to a coffee shop and a pizza place, perfect for getting coffee in the morning or getting a snack throughout the day. It was pretty quick getting anywhere we needed to go with Uber, no matter what district it was in. All in all I would definitely recommend staying at Felix's place. "
4760181,38611883,2015-07-17,34918565,Michael,Felix was super nice and handled everything through text very efficiently before my arrival.  I arrived later due to my flight being delayed but because of his smartphone connected door lock i didn't need to worry about waking anyone in the house to let me in.  The door was super convenient and allowed me to come and go without worrying about keys.  His place was a quick walk from main Ballard dining and bar area and was really convenient.  
4760181,39081850,2015-07-20,37728909,Dan,We felt very comfortable at Felix's home.  It is located in very safe Seattle neighborhood.
4760181,39671192,2015-07-25,16513364,Kate & Mark,"We loved staying at Felix's place. Him and his girlfriend Kloe were very friendly and welcoming during our 5-night stay.  They had great suggestions of things to do and places to eat around the city. The suite we stayed at was downstairs (still fully above ground) right off the main entrance. It was clean, with modern minimal finishes & felt private. We highly recommend this place!"
4760181,39932999,2015-07-27,19008950,Caitlin,Felix was super friendly and helpful! The space was private and and clean and the location was great too! 
4760181,40361554,2015-07-30,12721012,Amy,Felix was very helpful and friendly. He had some great suggestions for Seattle and really made us feel at home! Very comfortable bed. 
4760181,41091983,2015-08-04,34118576,Joe,"Felix was out of town, but his partner was very gracious and welcoming.  The quarters were bright and clean. I had no trouble finding his home, and getting around was easy. Ballard itself is an interesting part of Seattle, and the Ballard Locks should not be missed. Did not get a chance to know the two boxers, but they are impressive."
4760181,41851941,2015-08-09,9183592,Ron,Felix gave us a quick tour and key.
4760181,42431733,2015-08-13,37089113,Charles & Alexandra,"Charles and I had an amazing time staying at Felix's! He was away while we were there, but he was extremely accommodating and easily accessible by text. His girlfriend Khloe and adorable dogs were there to meet us, and they were all absolutely wonderful. We fell in love with the dogs and it was so hard to leave them when they gave us those puppy dog eyes! Khloe herself was so sweet and we felt so comfortable being there. She gave us suggestions on places to go and helped us out with any questions we had. The room was exactly as described (even better), and we were so glad to get there after a long day of travelling. To be able to just shower and rest in that clean & serene room was heaven. The AC was a lifesaver as it was pretty hot out during our trip, AND it made no noise - which was great. We enjoyed watching a bit of TV before bed, and the complimentary coffee and tea in the morning was awesome. The room was very private, the house was very comfy and clean, and we truly were so glad we chose to stay there. We will definitely book again with Felix next time we're out on the west coast! "
4760181,43051735,2015-08-17,7274187,Lauren,"Felix was a wonderful host! He made every effort to make my friend and I feel at home, and was incredibly welcoming and friendly. The room was exactly as described on the listing, and was clean and very comfortable.  Felix had great recommendations on dining and coffee shops in the area, and was very communicative via text/phone whenever we had questions. Thanks Felix! "
4760181,43799167,2015-08-22,4000182,Julie Ann,"Felix and Khloe are wonderful, welcoming, and friendly hosts! The house is clean and the room is very comfortable! The dogs are super fun and friendly, too!! I felt right at home using the kitchen and dining room (snacks, tea/coffee/water, cereal and bagels provided!!) The A/C is such a lovely bonus given the unusually hot summer Seattle has been experiencing. Location is very central - in Ballard, close to Fremont and Magnolia neighborhoods, 10 minutes to downtown, and easy access to I5. Easy parking right in their driveway. I would definitely stay again!!"
4760181,44477137,2015-08-26,20729371,Dustin & Chris,"Everything about my stay was absolutely wonderful! Felix, Khole and all the animals made my stay so welcoming and fun! With all the tips Khole gave me I felt like a local. The bedroom and bathroom are clean and quietly situated off to themselves. The free snacks and coffee were a treat and everything was just FABULOUS!! I will definitely stay again if I can the next time I visit Seattle!"
4760181,45273512,2015-09-01,11557195,Carey,"Staying with Felix was fantastic. From the moment I arrived in Seattle (and Ballard), I felt welcome and right at home. Felix hooked me up with a great location for happy hour oysters, and gave me a wonderful tour of the local spots.

The location is great - about a mile/15 min walk from downtown Ballard; and 10-15 min Uber to downtown Seattle. I will look to stay with him again on my next visit for sure. Thanks Felix!"
4760181,45967244,2015-09-07,21192479,Stephanie,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle! Felix's place was just as described in the listing. He was very good about communicating with us prior to arrival and made the process very simple. The suite is very private and located down a small flight of stairs immediately upon entry. Everything was clean when we arrived and we had access to a closet, full bathroom, TV, movies and a small patio with a table & chairs. He provided us with plenty of extra towels and linens as well. The room also had a wall unit a/c and space heater so that we could adjust the temperature in the room as needed. 

The location was great, close to the city and other cool neighborhoods that had good spots to eat. Felix was awesome about providing us with suggestions on food and activities. As we were staying over the weekend, he also frequently welcomed us to join what he was doing. 

Overall great experience. We loved Seattle and would definitely go back and stay with Felix! "
4760181,47283450,2015-09-17,42303705,Brian,"Felix was a fine and welcoming host. The apartment was clean and comfortable, the rented room was nicely separated from common spaces for privacy, and Felix made snacks available in the kitchen.  Felix and Khloe were both friendly and happy to answer questions about the area. His boxers were great, too!

The area itself is good--relatively quite, but close to lots of restaurants in Ballard, close to public transit, and a short drive or bus ride away from downtown."
4760181,48133650,2015-09-23,28171041,Matt,"Felix was a fantastic host, hands down. No problems whatsoever. We arrived and found the accommodations just as described - if not better considering the (very) comfortable bed and TV situation. He greeted us and chatted with us about neighborhoods, nightlife, etc. which proved helpful. The iPhone app used to open the door was also great and easy to use. Totally recommended for anyone looking at Fremont/Ballard adjacent. "
4760181,48888975,2015-09-29,1200767,Stanley,"Kloe welcomed us and introduced us to the three dogs and other guest who was staying there.  She made things in the kitchen available to us and was amiable.  Our room was small but comfortable and adequate .  The bed was comfortable (low for some folks maybe),  The bathroom was fine although the sink drained slowly.  Good shower! The room was quiet and there was a nice TV.  It was a good stay and we definitely recommend it.  One must enjoy dogs.  They are friendly and fun and well behaved.  A big plus for us since we love dogs!  Definitely would return."
4760181,50806424,2015-10-14,20629630,Jaclyn,"We had a lovely stay at Felix's place. The room was clean, comfortable, and private. The common areas were clean and lovely, and the coffee and snacks were a sweet touch.The dogs were wiggly and amazing! Felix was prompt to text back and had lots of great recommendations for us. The neighborhood was quiet and safe, with some great shops and restaurants a 10-15 minute walk away. In general, though, we got around via cab and bus. "
4760181,51218508,2015-10-18,46119121,Joseph,"I could not have had a better experience here with Felix. The neighborhood was gorgeous and the location is not far from anything you need to get to in Seattle. During the week I was in Seattle on business and had work to do. Felix accommodated me and gave me space to get what I needed to done. The basement room is very private and Felix didn't come down there once. On the weekend, he invited me out with his friends, and took me to all the known spots in Seattle. He is a natural host and clearly wants his guests to enjoy themselves and have a great time. On my last day him and his girlfriend Chloe ordered us chinese food and we watched some walking dead. The cost of staying here is very competitive to everything else in the area, and the quality of the stay is outstanding. I would not only recommend this to everyone who is looking at its listing, I will most likely return in the winter for some snowboarding with Felix. "
4760181,52173425,2015-10-26,46978588,Corby,"Felix was fantastic! He welcomed me when I arrived and made me feel right at home. He also texted me some during my trip with recommendations on things to do and to ensure I was having a great time. I spend a lot of my time just walking around and exploring the neighborhood and had a great time.  The room itself was as described, nice bed and sheets, nice hot shower and small back patio for stepping outside."
4760181,52790226,2015-11-01,22114111,Samuel,Felix was a great host! really relaxed and open. We got along pretty well and he was kind enough to show me around the neighborhood restaurants. The room was clean and cozy and it was very easy to feel at home there. The dogs are super nice and incredibly well trained and polite (...you know some dogs go nuts). All in all great time and I will definitely try to book Felix's place next time I'm in town. 
4760181,54927138,2015-11-25,21060288,Mishi,I had a fantastic stay at Felix's place. His house is very clean with great amenities and a beautiful view! Loved using the Kevo app he had set up for his guests as well as his gracious breakfast bar setup. He was a perfect host and I couldn't have felt more comfortable. Side note: his dogs are awesome and super friendly. I just relocated to the Seattle area and Felix gave me some great tips for the area and even some restaurant recommendations I'm looking forward to checking out soon. Couldn't recommend his place more!! Thanks so much for the hospitality. 
4760181,55403842,2015-12-01,46571646,Dale,"We stayed at Felix's place during the Thanksgiving week and Felix decided to visit his family for Thanksgiving so we never met him.  There was a miscommunication between Felix and his girl friend so when we arrived no one was home.  Fortunately Felix had hidden keys in a couple locations so, with Felix's directions via cell phone, we were able to get in.  The best thing for us was the location in Ballard.  The room was small and clean with an attached private bath.  The bed was a low profile  design so there was no place for two people to set down and have a conversation in the room.  Usually there was on street parking available within 1 block of Felix's place.   "
6453383,33408131,2015-05-27,1200912,Autumn,"We had such a great stay in Robin's private suite - it is beautifully furnished, spacious, clean and in a fantastic location. We were able to walk about 50 metres to the best pizza (Delancey's) the best bakery (Honore) and the best breaky in Seattle (the Fat Hen) as well as a very cool little bar and a pub. Downtown is an easy 10-15 minute drive or you can walk just around the corner to the D line bus route. We explored a few areas in Seattle but found that Ballard was our favourite - we loved walking through the beautiful green streets down to Ballard Avenue where we found even more of Seattle's best restaurants. In summary - this is exactly the type of Airbnb that we love. Thanks Robin."
6453383,33854419,2015-06-01,30739423,Lauren,"Robin's home was my first airbnb experience and she was just lovely! She was warm, welcoming and accommodating.  The lower level was clean and private with a full bedroom, living room, bathroom and private entrance. The location was also great! Walking distance to all the unique shops and restaurants in Ballard.  I'd recommend Robin to anyone - a great stay!"
6453383,35121802,2015-06-15,19407676,Rich,"I had an amazing trip to Seattle this past weekend, and Robin played a huge part in my visit surpassing high expectations. 

Her care started shortly after I booked when she learned I was foodie. She pointed me to insider Seattle food blogs and local restaurateurs, and was quick to answer any questions I might have.

Robin was still at work when I arrived, but check-in was seamless and welcoming (she had set out some local chocolate, a city magazine with tips, and thoughtful card…classy touches all).

Robin’s house and the Ballard neighborhood were a perfect fit for my weekend. You have the renovated downstairs all to yourself. The apartment is perfect size for a solo traveler or couple. The bed is super comfortable. Cozy sitting area. Great shower in the bathroom. 

Robin and I were passing ships during our stay, but I did have a chance to sit with her in her lovely backyard one morning. She’s awesome…laid back and super outdoorsy (she went on a night hike one evening during my trip). She has two kids, but I never heard them or saw them. 

A half-block from her house is a little cluster of restaurants…I had a nice breakfast at the Fat Hen on my last day (try their avocado bread). Walk over to 15th and in a few minutes you’ll be come to my favorite breakfast spot of the trip, Morsel. Big biscuits with overflowing eggs, etc., and homemade jams. Keep walking south (and a little west) and you’ll come to the hub of Ballard at the intersection of Ballard Ave and Market St. Lots of boutiques, restaurants, and bars. FYI, Sonic Boom Records is a must stop for any music lovers. I saw some great bands at the Tractor Tavern. I also walked down to the water further west…beautiful views (be sure to check out the Ballard Locks).

One last recommendation -- while in Seattle, make a point of visiting Westward, a restaurant on Lake Union. They have a small area outside with Adirondack chairs…you can order wine and oysters, then take in the water and downtown Seattle. Transporting. I also had a fun time on the Savor gourmet food tour in downtown Seattle.

Truly an A+ visit. Robin rocks!

Her basement unit is nicely appointed and a great value for the price.  We didn't get to experience Ballard however as we were only in Seattle for 2 days. Wish we could've stayed longer! Robin was an awesome host!"
6453383,37326605,2015-07-06,33910870,Pat,"My daughter and I were in Seattle for a wedding. Robin's house in a quiet residential area of Ballard was convenient to the church and reception locations. We stayed 3 nights at her lovely updated, bright and cheery lower level walk out private apartment with its own entrance. Unfortunately we did not meet Robin in person as she was out of town for the holiday week. However, she was very prompt in responding to our questions before and during our trip. Robin was flexible regarding check-in and check-out times. Because it was unseasonably warm she gave us permission to store food and water in the lower level refrigerator of her home. She had a portable fan which we easily moved from bedroom to family room as needed. She has a beautiful private fenced in backyard which we would have loved to use had the weather been nicer. We walked to several nearby places. We got rides from friends or took an Uber when needed. The White Hen (?) restaurant (a block or two from Robin's) was closed for the July 4 week. However, right across the street from this restaurant we discovered a French artesian bakery (Honore) with wonderful baked treats. It was very popular, a tad pricey but the quality of the food was worth it. We picked up breakfast from there every day. We did not try public transport in Ballard but heard it was quite convenient. We would gladly recommend Robin's place to friends interested in accommodations in Seattle. Thanks, Robin! Pat & Laura P."
6453383,38295792,2015-07-14,35424864,Barbara,"Really enjoyed our 3-night stay at Robin's lovely and comfortable lower level walk-out private apartment with its own entrance.  Robin was really helpful, friendly, informative about the neighborhood, and available while we stayed there; and promptly responsive in planning the visit.   I really liked exploring the neighborhood and area, and as a foodie was happy that good coffee and food was a quick walk away.  This was my first airbnb experience, and glad it was so positive.  Thanks, Robin!!"
6453383,38520682,2015-07-16,35917929,Daniel,"We had a great two nights stay in Robin's comfortable and private space. The location was perfect for us to explore Seattle. The room was clean and welcoming, and the bed was very comfortable. Robin was the perfect host and we could not have been more pleased."
6453383,39421817,2015-07-23,10012290,Sam,"Robin was a very welcoming and kind host. She was easy to reach when we arrived and had prepared for us by leaving out a couple of pamphlets about where to eat and sights to see in the neighborhood and greater Seattle, and a small treat to keep us going. The space was well furnished with a TV and DVD player, totally private, and in a great location in Ballard. "
6453383,39945634,2015-07-27,8473411,Deona,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Robin's! I never got to meet Robin but she was extremely flexible and friendly with all of our emails. You have an entire floor to yourself so if it is privacy you are looking for this is it! The home is next to great restaurants and a 2 min walk from a bus that takes your straight downtown Seattle. 
6453383,40353276,2015-07-30,36718391,Melvin,"Robin is an ideal Airbnb host and her house is excellently located in Seattle. Perfectly clean, with fresh linens and towels, with a personal note awaiting us on our arrival. This North Ballard neighborhood is beautiful and quiet with super easy access to the main sights of Seattle. We took the bus everywhere. The house is a couple minute walk from the D rapid line in a safe neighborhood. Ample street parking for a car. I highly recommend it! The house was an excellent value at $95 / night. It was roomy for us two, the bathroom is deluxe, you won't regret it!"
6453383,41115561,2015-08-04,37791222,Wenda,"Robin was terrific.  Very welcoming and very helpful with information.   I really didn't spend any time in the neighborhood because I was busy with family some distance away.  That said, it was a welcome refuge to come home to at the end of the day."
6453383,41415533,2015-08-07,37944567,Hannah,"We had a wonderful three days staying in Ballard! Robin was very helpful and accommodating prior to arriving and when we got there.  The private floor made it easy to come and go often without feeling like we were intruding on Robin.  She suggested many restaurants in the area that we took her up on and absolutely loved! Definitely go to the Fat Hen for a sit down breakfast or grab pastries and coffee from Honore Bakery just down the road from the house! We were visiting Seattle for the first time, so we were on the go pretty much the whole time we were there. We found the location very easy to get to downtown and all of the tourist attractions. There is also a cute overlook park in Ballard that we went to one night to watch the sunset. We had a wonderful time and would recommend Robin's private floor to everyone!"
6453383,42262773,2015-08-12,33870595,Cydney,"We had a great experience here!  The lodging was very spacious and comfortable.  Nice bedroom with comfy bed, living room area with tv, books, and games, and large, spacious well it bathroom.  Robin provided hot tea and coffee.  There was a private entrance.  Extra blankets, a fan, washer and dryer if needed.  Close enough to anywhere you would want to get to in Ballard.  Robin is super nice, accommodating, makes you feel at home.  I would stay here again.  "
6453383,42568719,2015-08-14,29949392,Chad,"Robin's place was incredible!  She was so on top of everything around our booking, and the place was ready and waiting for us.  It was exactly as she'd described it, and bonus the shower is AMAZING!  Ballard is a really cool part of Seattle and we enjoyed our time at the place and in the area very much (especially at the great little breakfast place just down the street.)  We'll be back for sure."
6453383,43513999,2015-08-20,35884063,Courtney,"Robin's place is awesome.  The accommodations were exactly as described.  Very clean, spacious, and comfortable.  Robin was extremely friendly and gave detailed instructions for check-in/check-out.  The neighborhood itself (Ballard) is a fantastic place to stay- plenty of dining and shopping options.  Downtown Seattle is easily accessible by bus.  So glad I stayed here!"
6453383,44316361,2015-08-25,18116785,Brittani,"Robin was a fantastic host! Check in was incredibly easy. She knew we were coming for a surprise birthday trip for my boyfriend and she left a kind note and a bottle of champagne in the fridge--so thoughtful! The area was lovely, very close to downtown, and other great neighborhood restaurants. Highly recommend! "
6453383,46131184,2015-09-08,4896443,Meghan,"We had a wonderful time staying in Robin's cozy basement apartment. It was very clean, comfortable, and was the perfect ""home base"" for our activities around Seattle. The check-in and check-out was incredibly easy. The bathroom is fabulous! (What a great shower!) Robin was thoughtful enough to leave some neighborhood information as well as books to enjoy and even a rain jacket and umbrella. Thanks Robin!"
6453383,46375212,2015-09-10,15190888,Nathan,"The place of Robin is situated in the great local residential area of Ballard. We think this is the coolest part of Seattle. Everything was clean and the early check-in was no problem for Robin. She is a very kind host! Down the road there is a small French bakery and 'The fat hen', which was nice for breakfast. We rented bikes at Dutch Bikes in Ballard and another tip is: 'The Fat Duck' for a great bagel (in University district). Conclusion: a great place to stay and explore the local neighbourhood. Taxi to the city center was around $ 21."
6453383,47407211,2015-09-18,43352203,Brandii,This was a great experience. The house is located close to the car rental location and a couple good restaurants. The instructions were very clear and easy to follow. I work in Seattle frequently for work and it really felt like a home away from home. 
6453383,47677959,2015-09-21,10023841,Linda,Robin did a great job making me feel at home in her spotless lower level apartment in her craftsman home. The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood was lovely and close to many boutique restaurants. I enjoyed the nice welcome letter since she was out of town for the weekend. My son lives in Seattle so I enjoyed going with him to the Sunday Ballard farmer's market. I can 't wait to return.  Linda Lawrence
6453383,49131343,2015-10-01,42462087,Wiebke,"We had a wonderful stay at Robin's!
A seperate, spacious and light apartment was all we could wish for.
As good as a hotel but felt like home.
Great, quiet neighborhood too. Wish we could have stayed longer...
We recommend it!
"
6453383,49794128,2015-10-06,42535714,Audrey,"Our host seemed to have read our minds, knowing certain questions we probably would've asked her.  She proactively left a map of the neighborhood, showing what shops, eateries, coffee places, gas stations, and grocery/drug stores were close by.  There was a list of important phone numbers, with the wifi code, and instructions on how to use the TV/cable.  Even sweeter, since it was our honeymoon, Robin left a little bottle of wine chilling in the mini fridge!

The first night we arrived, we were greeted by the next door neighbor, who was very friendly.  In anticipation of the weather, and knowing that we are from sunny San Diego, Robin also left an extra umbrella and jacket, in case the weather turned during our stay.

We stayed for 3 nights and were mostly out and about.  It was so nice to be able to have a private floor to come back to, to nap or regroup in-between exploring Seattle.  Amazingly, our host lives so close to many of the places we wanted to see.  Most times we didn't have to drive farther than 10-15 minutes.

Overall, it was a great first Airbnb experience.  I wasn't sure how interactive it should or shouldn't be, and I think Robin was really gracious about respecting our privacy.  On our last day, we were able to at least say Goodbye and Thank You face-to-face and I really appreciate that we got to do that."
6453383,50033282,2015-10-08,39046730,Kathleen,"Robin was super responsive to check-in details and questions. Her guest space is wonderful--generous sized bedroom, sitting room and bathroom--and private and quiet. Entry/exit is also private and steps away to a walkable neighborhood with trendy restaurants. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and will be back in November!"
6453383,50863204,2015-10-15,43352203,Brandii,"This is my second time staying with Robin. She communicates well. The B&B is very clean and quiet. 
This B&B is so close to dining options without being in a commercial district. It is quiet and peaceful. I stay here while I am working in Seattle and it really feels like coming home. "
6453383,51430087,2015-10-20,33324420,Michael,"Robin's neighborhood was really great. She met us when we arrived and was very friendly. The place was nicely decorated (and she is adding more art as it finds her) and more spacious than we expected. Robin had restaurant suggestions and a local hand drawn map that laid out the neighborhood nicely.  Gotta say- we loved the heated tile floor in the bathroom!  Thanks, Robin!"
6453383,51595605,2015-10-21,28058608,Renee,It was a lovely place that was easy to get to and very relaxing to stay. The place is comfy and there is coffee and some tea and a tv with a movie selection. Robin is great to work with. 10/10 would stay here again. 
6453383,51743401,2015-10-24,44214039,Lisa,Thank you Robin! My parents loved staying in your home. You made them feel so welcome. It was absolutely perfect for them.
6453383,52377423,2015-10-28,26275228,Christopher And Ashley,This is a great place to stay in Seattle. It's also one of the nicest air bnbs I've stayed at. Robin is very nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend!!!
6453383,52465204,2015-10-29,21395518,Rosely,"Robin's home was an absolute delight! She has amazing taste and we truly felt like we were at home. She greeted us upon arrival and made us feel very welcome. The place was spotless, comfortable and beautifully decorated.
Thank you for providing us with a beautiful place to stay during our visit, Robin!"
6453383,53226071,2015-11-06,37554083,Ma,"Very nice appartement, clean, close to public transportation, friendly host.

The only tiny issue was that there is no desk, so working is not possible."
6453383,53755607,2015-11-12,39046730,Kathleen,"Brought my husband with me on this visit and we both had a great time in Robin's spacious, quiet apartment--a great place for out-of-town grandparents to spend days with the family and evenings as a couple. We walked the neighborhood, had coffee at Honore Bakery (IMHO the best coffee/tea and pastries in Ballard) and lunch at Un Bien (the Caribbean Roast Dinner is enough for two). As on my first visit, Robin was super responsive and the perfect host."
6453383,54102616,2015-11-16,4202156,Gonzalo,"Robin was an excellent host! She made sure we had everything we needed in advance and accommodated a late arrival - she even gave us a heads up about the weather. The apartment is very private and well located, we had no issues going in and out. I would recommend her place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle and I would stay here again.   "
6453383,55074390,2015-11-27,49024537,Margaret,"Clean,comfortable downstairs with really nice bathroom. Great neighborhood, walked to local ""dive"" bar for football. Robin was friendly, helpful and tried unsuccessfully to get the Airbnb app on my phone so I could see complete messages in the future"
6453383,55216878,2015-11-29,46039528,Bridget,"Nice, quiet neighborhood. Robin really made us feel welcome, and answered our questions promptly. No breakfast (instant coffee and an electric kettle) but there were really good restaurants nearby. Darling, newly remodeled, with a wonderful shower and comfortable bed."
6453383,55575549,2015-12-02,48086793,Karen,We had so much fun in Seattle and Robin's place was perfect and exactly what we were looking for. It was a great little neighborhood and a quick easy drive to downtown
6453383,56602415,2015-12-15,47829670,Dale,"Robin is a great host. She provides a clean, comfortable, private place to stay in a nice neighborhood. Everything was just as described on the website. She communicates very well and responds to inquiries very timely. She provided us with helpful information about the area that helped us plan our stay. We will  need to return to this area to visit our son and his family and I hope that Robin has a vacancy for us! "
6453383,56806546,2015-12-18,3562983,Mark,"Robin is a great host. She sent me very clear instructions about how to access her place and introduced herself to me the first morning of my stay. The space itself is very clean, comfortable, and private. Its a perfect place to rest after a busy day in the city. "
6453383,57895222,2015-12-30,48284556,Norma,She kept in touch before and after our stay that made it a great experience.  We got to meet Robin she made us feel comfortable.  Her place was quiet and in a nice neighborhood.  We would recommend to others.
8116395,45738212,2015-09-05,6137350,Joey,Extremely pleased with my stay. It was an awesome spot and the location was amazing. 
8116395,45897121,2015-09-06,6137350,Joey,Excellent experience with Robbie and his apartment. It was an amazing location and we had a blast. The space was very clean and functional. It's not the ritz Carleton  but it's beyond suffice and Robbie was more than hospitable. There was wine for us when we arrived and he told us to use or eat anything we found. Robbie relied within minutes whenever I emailed and was very accommodating when it came to check in and check out. Highly recommend this space and this area. So much better than being downtown. It only took 20-25 minutes (through an amazing neighborhood) to get to shopping and tourist attractions. 
8116395,46957839,2015-09-14,42719568,Aurora,"Robbie was a very gracious host and made sure we had everything we needed. The apartment was cozy and just the right size for our purposes, and was also located conveniently near the heart of Seattle. Would not mind staying here again! "
8116395,48428776,2015-09-26,27497473,Alex,"Had a great time staying at this apartment! Perfect relaxing location near a few restaurants and close enough to all of the downtown action. Very clean, fun and decorative place with everything you need for a weekend in Seattle. Robbie was very friendly and he was always available on the phone for any questions or recommendations. "
8116395,49999121,2015-10-08,1169057,Pamela,"Great location, and Robbie even let me have my cats in the apartment, while I transitioned from SF to Seattle. 

There was a bit of a funky odor coming from somewhere in the apartment, but Robbie was gracious and offered a discount for the inconvenience."
8116395,50511658,2015-10-12,19874260,Julia,"Easy check in and check out.  As soon as we walked into the apartment we were greeted by a bottle of wine and a note.  It's a great location- many bars and restaurants all in walking distance. It's a beautiful quiet neighborhood with a great view of the space needle around the corner.  The bed was comfy and he also provided two inflatable mattresses if we planned to  have guest over (we didn't use them, but it was thoughtful!) thanks Robbie!!!"
8116395,50982484,2015-10-16,6506342,Sharon,robbie's apartment is in an older building in a good location in capitol hill.  a short walk to many restaurants and bars etc.  the apartment is pretty basic but suited our needs for a one night stop over.   check in was easy.  robbie responded quickly and was easy to deal with.  
8116395,51140175,2015-10-18,27456523,Matt,"Had a great stay here, had everything I needed in a good location. Robbie was a great help in finding more about the city, and couldn't be more pleasant to deal with."
8116395,51764001,2015-10-24,12073973,Min,Robbie's apt is clean and tiny with interesting decoration. We were welcome with a friendly note and a bottle of red. We had a pleasant stay. 
8116395,53361933,2015-11-08,30158502,Ben,"The we were looking for: a cozy, clean crash pad for a weekend away from our kids. It's close to everything in Capitol Hill. Robbie even had beer in the fridge and a bottle of wine in the living room.
Liberty Bar is a must visit around the corner."
8116395,53804362,2015-11-12,6904454,Greg & Johann,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

8116395,54245305,2015-11-17,43690537,Ross,"Spent 4 awesome days at Robbie's place. Robbie was quick with suggestions and directions for the area. The neighborhood is great, there are some good restaurants within a two minute walk and a grocery store just down the street. Yoga is just around the corner too. I thought the best part were all the cafes, I didn't drink coffee from the same place twice, and I had a lot of coffee. Ada was probably my favorite, it's a small cafe and geek/technical book shop, very cool. Uber rides to and from Pike Place and the ferry terminal were all less than $20. "
8116395,54597851,2015-11-22,3299158,Diane,"Robbie's space was as described. It was nice to have a chance to meet each other when we arrived. He was very welcoming and made himself available if we needed anything. The location is fantastic, close to lots on foot and central to several locations by car. And the apt is set up with everything  you'd need for a weekend stay, plus really peaceful and quiet.

The only cons were that the sheets on the bed were polyester- I have no need for fancy sheets, but cotton would be much more comfortable. There was barely a dribble of hot water in the shower in the morning so I gave up on trying to have a shower, but maybe this was unusual? 


"
8116395,56027623,2015-12-08,45607943,Lisa,Awesome apt in Capitol Hill of Seattle. Robbie was incredibly organized and allowed me to check in early and check out late. He left a lovely gift and the stay was perfect. Great view of the Space Needle just outside the apt and super close to yummy restaurants and other delicious treats :). Highly recommend if traveling to Seattle and would like a place to yourself at a super reasonable price. Thanks again Robbie. 
8116395,56397536,2015-12-13,4431766,Mona,"Robbie was a wonderful host! His place was clean and he responded immediately every time I texted him. Great location!!Easy check in. He also left some wine, super thoughtful! Thank you Robbie!!"

7471629,40829329,2015-08-02,3836710,Sean,"Bob, thanks for letting me be your first guest. I enjoyed my stay. What a nice view, and having the bus to and from downtown on the same block was very convenient. I enjoyed the quiet neighborhood and was grateful for the easy and free street parking. The back yard was a well planted and peaceful retreat after a hectic work day. Thanks again"
7471629,41280878,2015-08-05,7681928,Maie,We had a pleasant stay;Bob is a gracious host who cares that his guests are comfortable. His posted photos don't do his garden apartment justice.  The apartment is very nice and tastefully decorated. The garden is lovely and an excellent addition to the indoor space.  It is special. Bob is fine tuning the furnishings and a sofa is coming soon. We would happily stay again when we return to Seattle. 
7471629,41703777,2015-08-08,34658393,Kyle,"Bob's place is phenomenal. He took care in designing both the interior and the beautiful garden/backyard overlooking downtown Seattle. After chatting with him, bouncing our travel plans around and hearing a few suggestions/ideas, it seemed as though the offbeat and creative tendencies reflected in the decor are also reflected in their creator. Bob is rad; a kindred soul. We went for a morning jog down through Leschi park and along the waterfront in the morning and marveled at the view of Rainier. Quiet neighborhood with a few shops and cafes, close to PT to downtown. Truly enjoyed ourselves here and would absolutely return when revisiting the Seattle area."
7471629,42184857,2015-08-11,39288734,Frank,"Very convenient location. Very personable host.
Great view from the backyard.
Best of all - a great brew pub around the corner.
Would definitely stay again.
Thanks Bob."
7471629,42343784,2015-08-12,40551908,Edward,Very cozy Lockout with amazing view. Convenient to downtown. Friendly owner was very helpful. Would definitely stay again! Thanks for everything.  
7471629,42471361,2015-08-13,12355749,Kristin,"Bob created an extraordinarily well decorated space which feels spacious and inviting. If you like immaculate tribal-industrial-Northwest moderne, accented by a verdant garden and a lovely view, this rental is for you! As much as I liked Bob's space, I liked the neighborhood of Leschi just as much. This block has boutique coffee, gourmet French food and a bakery within steps of this house, as well as a public seating area with the same great view of downtown. It felt safe and welcoming. Walking around is a workout, up & down hills, but totally worth it. One other thing I enjoyed was reading the books on the shelf! I would stay again with enthusiasm. "
7471629,42642913,2015-08-14,12331515,Tiffany,"We booked with Bob at the last minute. He met us outside and showed us to the home. It's a bottom level apartment styled one bedroom. Decorated absolutely beautifully. Modern with a cultural twist. Private, lush garden in the back. We found our secret getaway, close to home and will definitely be back. Highly recommend. We felt safe and comfortable during the whole stay."
7471629,43119398,2015-08-17,37226448,Matthew,"This was a phenomenal place.  Beautiful view of the city, with quick access to Lake Washington.  The room itself felt exotic and private and I felt like I was away.  Seattle was only a $10 Uber away, which made having fun in the city easy.  Bob was quick to respond to any of my needs and I enjoyed that. There are two nice coffee shops within walking.  Also this was a reasonable price, saved a ton by not going to one in the city."
7471629,43444019,2015-08-19,41220744,Marissa,"The apartment was beautiful. It has a garden area with a view, and the apartment itself was clean and had great decor. It was very spacious and we enjoyed staying there! The neighborhood is mellow, not a lot going on, but nice areas to go for a run and get a coffee. A few restaurants close by. Overall, great spot. "
7471629,43858651,2015-08-22,21419972,Charity,"It was perfect! Nice private basement apartment with a beautiful garden and amazing view of the city in the distance…spectacular sunsets each night. I couldn't have been happier, and so much less expensive than a boring hotel room."
7471629,44029031,2015-08-23,7391089,Kara,"Our stay in Bob's apartment was truly fantastic. The location is great, right on a bus line to downtown (or a $10-$15 uber ride!) but out of the city enough to have an air of welcomed peace & quiet (and views!). I cannot find the words to describe how wonderful of a space Bob has created with this apartment - both inside and out. It is clear the amount of dedication and attention to detail Bob had with this home space. Phenomenal space, wonderfully decorated. I would highly recommend to anybody traveling to the city."
7471629,44371807,2015-08-25,5140640,Shino,"Dear Bob,
I am so glad that I found you, Bob! Thank you so much for your hospitality and kindness. It was PERFECT!!!! 

-------------------
There is a nice cafe in front of his apartment. You must try their pastries! These were super tasty. Also they have great coffee and sadwichies. "
7471629,44498488,2015-08-26,468603,Aly,"Bob was so accommodating. What a wonderful apartment with all the basics, gorgeous views and really comfortable bed. The room was perfect because it stays dark so I can sleep in. I hope to stay again hopefully it'll be available because Bob will be sure to be a Seattle super host in no time. "
7471629,45395859,2015-09-02,24366804,Micaela,"We couldn't have asked for anything more! Great place, comfortable bed, good water pressure, very clean, great views, beautiful neighborhood...

The detailed craftsmanship and eclectic decor throughout the apartment really made Bob's place stand out.  The view from the backyard was phenomenal and it was a very peaceful place to relax. The full kitchen was just what we needed to prepare a seafood dinner after our trip to Pike Market. The neighborhood was great for an evening walk and is near several parks. The apartment doesn't have wifi, but luckily there are two coffee shops across the street that provide free access. The apartment was a $10-12 Uber ride to most everywhere we wanted to go, and about a mile from the Mount Baker light rail stop if you're coming from the airport. 

Bob was a fantastic host who really went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. If we make it out to Seattle for a vacation in the future, we would love to stay here again!"
7471629,46178954,2015-09-08,40825427,Ashley,"We couldn't ask for more! Bob has created a beautiful place of peace, where we could escape the hustle and bustle of the city, while not being too far away to admire it's beautiful view. Waking up to the sunshine gleaming through his large windows every morning was amazing. The view of downtown Seattle from the garden was even better. Bob was a great host. Soooo happy I booked this place! "
7471629,46757573,2015-09-13,5707845,Minda,Very nice apartment with great city views. The apartment is just like the pictures shown. Loved the neighborhood coffee shop just down the street. 
7471629,47080636,2015-09-15,31740518,Alex,"Bob was a fantastic host, communicative and friendly - his place was in a great neighbourhood, and the place has a really cool look. The place was clean and about 10 minutes away from everything in Seattle. The garden had some fantastic views too. Would definitely stay here again."
7471629,47440388,2015-09-18,936680,Scott,"Great place.  Quiet,  convenient and cozy."
7471629,47591696,2015-09-20,3529485,Tyler,Great place to stay close enough for a short uber ride to city center.  Eclectic decorations and a great view from the backyard. Communication was flawless as was check in and check out.  Space was very clean when we arrived.  Would stay here again.  Thanks!
7471629,47948001,2015-09-21,285179,Ellen,"My fiancé and I are avid airbnb fans but we were pretty disappointed in our stay here. After trying to contact Bob about our concerns, we received no response. 
The pros:
The view and backyard were nice. The art work in the room was lovely and overall was well designed. 
The Cons:
We weren't aware from the listing description that this is actually a finished basement under an old house and it was possible to hear the people upstairs walking around until 11pm and then waking us up at 6am. The bed also slumps in the middle and my fiance and I both got up with huge pains in our backs and got about an hour of sleep total. :( 
There isn't a designated parking for the guests so we had to park more than a block away to carry our things in the rain. We were soaked and the cement floor has no rugs of any kind and they were quite cold and dirty when we were trying to get warm. 
When I went to sit outside in the morning after an uncomfortable night to enjoy the backyard, there was a person chain smoking there (whom ended up being the neighbor and Bob's niece) however we were lead to believe that this was a private yard. It was also a privacy issue as we hadn't closed curtains etc. 
Unfortunately, the price was not conducive to having no rugs, a slumpy older bed, no parking, no WIFI, no television, no games or entertainment, no breakfast items, no coffee maker and a clamp wrench for a hot water handle in the shower. So, for the rate and cleaning fees he is charging, we could have stayed and a fancy hotel downtown."
7471629,48440264,2015-09-26,881784,Jennifer,Bobs home was lovely and super stylish. Loved the neighborhood!
7471629,48742373,2015-09-28,31325773,Winnie,"Beautiful garden, but a bit difficult to find the apartment. "
7471629,49926308,2015-10-07,8253302,Halimah,"Really enjoyed our stay here in Seattle! Lovely apartment and garden. We watched the hummingbirds bathe in the water fountain every morning! Apartment is very clean and just as described/pictured. Bob was friendly, helpful, and we enjoyed chatting with him. We liked the location in a quiet neighborhood and mostly used the bus system to get around and downtown. It took about 20-30 minutes, depending on the time of day. Uber ran about $11-12 when we used it. Nice area with several eating options very close by, which was helpful. We didn't have any issues with privacy/backyard and had it all to ourselves when we were there.  Bob cares about the apartment and his guests experience and it shows in the cleanliness, decor, and thoughtful gestures (water and beer in fridge, books on Seattle, enough clean towels/sheets) Would definitely stay again! "
7471629,50647137,2015-10-13,36643538,Troy,Bob was a great host. The apartment had everything we needed for our stay and we immediately felt right at home. The Zen garden was amazing and the views were fantastic. Bob even went out of his way to loan us a few rain jackets one rainy day. We couldn't have found a better place for our vacation and will be returning the next time we come to Seattle. Thanks Bob!
7471629,51076718,2015-10-17,168862,Mikal,"We love staying at Bob's quintessential apartment!
Eclectic, fabulous views, and well appointed!
Every detail tells a story, books abound, creativity inspires.
A very comfortable space."
7471629,51411634,2015-10-19,12786067,John,"We had a wonderful time at Bob's! It's a very nice place, with a very thoughtful, very well done interior and exterior. The backyard area is beautiful, and it has an AMAZING view of the downtown skyline and surrounding areas; perfect for a cup of coffee and waking up. 
The place is directly across from a nice newer restaurant with a bar (Heyday), and the owner even sat and chatted with us for a good 20 minutes. The French restaurant nearby (a la Bonne Franquette) is absolutely fantastic, and in the morning there is a pastry place across the way. It's the perfect little nook of convenient and sleepy, and Bob was very easy to work coordinate with to make the whole experience feel relaxed... exactly what we were looking for. The place was clean, orderly, and we wish we had more time to go through all of the wonderful books Bob has collected on Seattle's history and sights. The next time I'm in town, I'm giving Bob a holler!"
7471629,54830482,2015-11-23,49522635,Lara,"What a wonderful place to stay! Lovely neighborhood and a wonderful view. Cozy and warm, we had a great time. "
5834820,31411606,2015-05-04,5053141,Ellis,"We had a wonderful stay.  The home is very pleasant, comfortable and extremely clean and tidy.  Our room was very comfortable -- with twin beds, a desk and chair, a closet with space for clothes on hangers, and plenty of drawer space.  The bathroom is large and beautiful.  We had a couple of small requests and John and Carol were completely accommodating;  they also responded quickly to our e-mail.  We would definitely stay there again."
5834820,34587111,2015-06-09,4206117,Booyoung,"It was an excellent staying in Carol & John's beautiful lake side home!
The bed was so comfortable, neat and everything was as have described.
Thanks!!!"
5834820,34832545,2015-06-12,19408390,Madeleine,"John and Carol were great hosts and took great care of my family. The room was organized and clean and the private bath was large and very nice. The house is just a block from the lake and has a beautiful garden. Most of all, John and Carol were very friendly people!"
5834820,35020083,2015-06-14,21340980,Kim,"John and Carol were beyond accommodating.  Their home is incredibly beautiful,  clean, and welcoming. The room is very clean and comfortable.  We left at 5 am because we had a race downtown to get to (they were so understanding about race preparation offering suggestions for appropriate dinner spots in the area as well as room in their fridge for our supplies). A note worth mentioning,  we tried to be really quiet as we were leaving,  and we accidentally slammed the bedroom door! It closes very easily and louder than we thought!  SO sorry John and Carol!  All in all...incredible location and beautiful home. Outside the downtown core so nice and quiet. We will definitely keep it in mind when we travel into town!"
5834820,35091885,2015-06-15,4133769,Gene,"Very nice neighborhood, hosts were wonderful. Beds were simple but enough room"
5834820,35442537,2015-06-18,1669695,Claudia,John and Carol were very welcoming to us. They have a beautiful home in a quiet neighborhood close to Lake Washington.
5834820,35527869,2015-06-19,35956164,Elizabeth,"John and Carol have set the bar high for future Airbnb stays!  I stayed during a house hunting trip to Seattle.  They have a lovely home that is very clean, comfortable, and steps from Lake Washington.  The beds were comfortable and the bathroom is HUGE!  Carol and John could not be two nicer people and I enjoyed our conversations and hospitality.  Highly recommended!"
5834820,35721083,2015-06-21,35305591,Alyssa,"Carol and John were very welcoming! Their place is in a beautiful location right by lake Washington, but just a short drive to downtown. It is super clean and cute. Carol was an awesome ""foster mom"" who was beyond helpful and had a lot of advice on what to see in Seattle."
5834820,35872528,2015-06-22,11193998,Fabian,We stayed 1 night at John and Carols House. The house is cozy and close to the beautiful Lake Washington. John and Carol are very kind and really good hosts. We enjoyed the conversations and the coffee in the morning. We hope we can come back to this nice place near Seattle. Thank you very much.
5834820,36393588,2015-06-28,32721254,Becky,"John and Carol were fantastic hosts. They made arrangements to leave a key for us when we arrived so that we could get in before they arrived home. They have a simple but comfortable room they rent out, with a bathroom to yourself down the hall. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. They were delightful people that we found out we had some overlapping history with! All in all (it was really hot for Seattle that weekend!) a great stay, and when in need of Seattle lodging again we will definitely rebook!"
5834820,37715146,2015-07-09,20084428,Nathan,John and Carol were fantastic. They were extremely welcoming and helpful in pointing us in the right direction for Seattle and surrounding areas. They made themselves super accessible for us when we did have questions and were always eager to help. It was a real pleasure!
5834820,37891315,2015-07-11,35956164,Elizabeth,Thanks John and Carol for a second stay!  Lovely home and great people.
5834820,38109466,2015-07-13,20868825,Amy,"Carol and John were welcoming and replied promptly to our messages.  We checked in late the first night and they arranged an easy way for us to find the key.  Accommodations were clean with a spacious bathroom and the neighbourhood was absolutely beautiful (right beside Lake Washington).  The hosts were kind enough to have breakfast bread, tea, and supplies for us (but we didn't need them as we had made other plans)."
5834820,39252133,2015-07-21,37838597,David,"John and Carol are a very accommodating couple, they accepted my booking with relatively short notice. The house is nice, large bedroom and everything was very clean. Their neighbourhood is approx 2km from the main sky train route into Seattle and they have spectacular views of of the lake from their house."
5834820,39772614,2015-07-26,34490480,Ingrid,"John and Carol's home is in a lovely, quiet spot near Lake Washington and close to downtown Seattle. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and comfortable, and John and Carol were great hosts! They provided a nice little breakfast, and lots of great tips on parking options and getting around via public transportation. We would definitely stay with them again!"
5834820,39975398,2015-07-27,19977432,Vince,John and Carol provided a very comfortable place to stay in Seattle. Their home is in a safe and quiet neighbourhood by the lake. Bed and bathroom were in terrific condition. They are also the nicest hosts you'll ever meet! Both are very helpful and great to converse with. My only regret is that I couldn't stay there longer!
5834820,40164223,2015-07-28,38970641,Nancy,"Johns' and Carols' home was lovely! It has beautiful hard wood floors! The bedroom was very nice with french doors leading to the back yard. The bathroom was over sized and very nice. Very quite at night. Nice neighborhood. A very nice view of Washington lake, just steps away. 
John and Carol are very nice. My daughter and I had a nice visit with them about Africa adventures.
"
5834820,41497535,2015-08-07,3334231,Danielle,"My dad and I stayed with Carol & John for one night on our recent trip to Seattle. Their house is beautiful and very well maintained and the room was even nicer than described. The bathroom is huge and everything was spotlessly clean. It was also nice having the porch off the bedroom to let the cool air in at night. We were happy to have time  to chat with both John and Carol during our stay, who are both very warm and accommodating hosts. Carol provided us with great directions and recommendations for our trip and in the morning we chatted with John who also showed us around their nice vegetable garden out back. They also have a cool apple tree with different types of apples and a plum tree, yum! I highly recommend staying at their place if you find yourself in the Seattle area!"
5834820,41988342,2015-08-10,36398739,Pallav,"The place is awesome. The room in which we stayed was spacey and cool. The room opens into a backyard (pretty cool). There is a lake beside, but we did not get enough time to stroll along it."
5834820,42299859,2015-08-12,13861053,Jacqueline,Carol made us feel very welcomed. She had our room ready and everything was very clean and organized. The listing description was accurate. Her home is beautiful and in a great location. The house is in walking distance to Lake Washington and nice local spots. 
5834820,44074481,2015-08-23,7127353,Melissa,"Carol was great and the location was amazing.  The location on the lake, in a historic craftsmen, in a quite neighborhood would be hard to beat anywhere."
5834820,44247573,2015-08-24,38774762,Ashley,This was our first air b and b and it was fantastic! John and Carols home is beautiful and right beside the lake! Our taxi was about 20 mins to Safeco and we had a great stay! We were running late and Carol was in touch about the key as well forgot our passports and contacted us right away! Amazing hosts!
5834820,44461450,2015-08-26,40653144,Richard,The room was very clean and quiet.  The hosts were very friendly and helpful.  The room was exactly what I was looking for.
5834820,49726495,2015-10-05,21499284,Betty,"Carol's welcoming presence was such a gift!  The kitchen was available, our private bathroom beautiful and well stocked, and the location of their home outstanding.  We enjoyed beautiful walks by Lake Washington, only 1 block away.  "
5834820,50006894,2015-10-08,43863329,Gang,"It's a great pleasure to stay at John and Carol's house. The house is very close to Washington lake. It's within walking distance to Seward park. We had walked to the park, it's wonderful. John and Carol are very kind. Carol suggested us good places to go. She cooked breakfast and we had it together. The room is very clean. If you visit Seattle and have a car, this is an ideal place to stay."
5834820,51488747,2015-10-20,46004380,Cecilia,"John and Carol were excellent hosts. Their home is in a quiet upscale neighborhood a block  of Lake Washington. The location is great, just 15-20 minutes drive to downtown Seattle and Seattle-Tacoma Airport.
I recommend."
2256124,26383307,2015-02-10,1326282,Daniel,"This is a really great place! Great neighborhood in the U-District, nice studio with a comfortable firm bed. Dan was super helpful and flexible. Highly recommended."
2256124,26830248,2015-02-20,23361179,Kyle,"Dan was an excellent host for our 5 day stay in the Udistrict. His apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable stay, down to the little chocolates on the pillow. He was very communicative and flexible, generously accommodating us every step of the way. Overall,  a great place to stay in the Udistrict!"
2256124,27411019,2015-03-03,28073758,Paul,"Dan was a wonderful host. He was always available to assist us if we needed it. We had a late arrival(10:30 pm) and he was there right when we arrived. The place was very well kept, and perfect for what we needed. He had towels and complimentary chocolates waiting for us, and showed around the place before we settled in. We were in the university district(which got a little rowdy at night) but he was very upfront about the area, and recommended where to go and not go at certain times. All in all, he was a fantastic host, and would recommend him to anyone. "
2256124,27542743,2015-03-07,27405325,Amiel,"Dan was a wonderful host. Even though our flight in was delayed and we arrived much later than originally planned, Dan was very accommodating and welcoming. The apartment was in a perfect location for our visit to University of Washington, close to public transportation and to great food (some of the best vegan food in the city was minutes away!). "
2256124,28030076,2015-03-16,5210054,Alex,"Dan was a great host and his apartment is centrally located in the U-district but on a quiet street (so you can get a good nights sleep). The apartment is modern and clean and while it is cozy, if you need a place to crash, it is perfect. I would recommend to others. "
2256124,28404626,2015-03-23,27977880,Alyssa,Dan was great!  Very helpful and accommodating.  The space was perfect and I have no complaints.  Highly recommended and this will definitely be my go to spot on Seattle trips!
2256124,28742088,2015-03-29,12255032,Kate,"The listing was accurate and Dan had fresh linens laid out and waiting. He invited me to use shampoo or soap if I needed it and I enjoyed the lavender incense. The location was indeed optimal for exploring the University district and there were several buses available to get downtown with relative ease. There was a grocery store nearby and the kitchenette made it easy to keep to a food budget so that I could treat myself to some seafood for dinner on the town one evening. The wifi connection was reliable and fast; having a desk to work at was extremely helpful. The apartment overall was relatively clean but it could have used a good vacuuming and the shower could have used a tougher scrubbing, but overall everything was clean. Dan was attentive and responsive to my communication while I was in town. That said, I would have enjoyed it if he communicated with me before my arrival as to my question about making coffee inside the apartment. I realize that this concern is trivial and it certainly did not spoil the trip (by the way, a pour-over device was available along with a grinder for the serious coffee drinker after all!). If given the chance to go back and change my plans, I would keep my stay at Dan's place as it was nice, comfortable, and was pretty affordable."
2256124,29861949,2015-04-13,869706,Zac And Becky,"If you want to stay walking distance to UW and are looking for a convenient place to crash, stay here. The price is basically unbeatable for your own space. Dan left us chocolate and water bottles, toiletries in the shower, and was very flexible with check in and out times. Corner unit gets a nice breeze through the windows. Honestly the photos he has posted don't do the place justice - it gets sunlight on the non-rainy days and there is a beautiful tree right outside one of the windows. There is a tiny kitchen for basic needs (storing leftovers in the mini fridge, heating up leftovers on a skillet or in the microwave). Grocery store, walgreens, and weekend farmers market right down the street. For U district this place is pretty quiet at night. Didn't hear noise from other units in the building, either. Solid wifi. The listing description is accurate but the photo of the bed doesn't show the mattress is about half a foot less wide than the bed frame, which didn't impact our sleeping - just be careful getting into and out of the bed once you turn off the light. That's really a trivial complaint for such a decent location, amazing price, and nice host."
2256124,30716110,2015-04-26,30990872,Katie,"This was my first airbnb experience and it was perfect - it completely met my needs. Dan's building is nicely situated and extremely convenient to many things. In walking distance you'll find a Safeway, Walgreens, a number of restaurants and a movie theater. Even a Zipcar location, which worked out great for me because I needed a car the first night I arrived.
The accomodation is basic, but good. The building is modern and very safe. Dan's apartment has huge windows that let in a lot of light. There is a little kitchen (no stove but two burners along with a big microwave and a little fridge), and this was fine for me. The bed was comfortable and Dan provided me with a towel and an extra blanket (this was most appreciated actually because I found Seattle really cold!). Overall a very positive experience."
2256124,31364813,2015-05-04,31349942,Jason,"Dan was a great host, very responsible and responsive.  The small private apartment is in the perfect location in the heart of the U district of Seattle. Great value, excellent experience. "
2256124,31805743,2015-05-10,27438480,Mike,"Dan was very accommodating with our situation. We came out to house hunt and were only available to check in late upon our arrival. We left early and he proposed a way that we could leave without a follow up meeting. The place was small but perfect for our needs. The location was great to go out and have a great time without worrying about having to drive. Thanks, Dan!"
2256124,32752752,2015-05-21,16284353,Mike,"Dan was a great host. He met us outside as soon as we arrived, provided us with a few solid points on what was in the area, and even left water and chocolate in the room. Definitely recommend staying whether you're exploring Seattle, heading to a UW football game, or visiting friends. "
2256124,33151812,2015-05-25,8822992,Noa,"Dan was wonderful--we came in late because of a bachelor party, and he came and let us in at 2 am. The room was wonderfully clean, organized, and had everything we could need, including little chocolates on the fresh towels. Great location--we ended up walking to Greenlake for a wedding, and it took about 25 minutes in verdant green. Thanks Dan!"
2256124,33927164,2015-06-02,9972473,Ceh,"Dan was fast, communicative, and easy to work with. his little studio worked out great for us to spend a few days there just needing a home base. my partner and I are avid travelers and sight-seers so we really only went there to sleep and recoup, which it was perfect for. if you're a traveler who needs more amenities  like a TV with access to Netflix and a huge area to hang out, you might want to keep looking. his studio is basic and to the point which is exactly all we needed. the neighborhood is your typical university party neighborhood so there's a lot of great eats, bars, and yes...drunk college folks. all in all, worked great for us!"
2256124,34238908,2015-06-06,5945070,Heather,"Dan was very friendly and quick to respond to messages! The bachelor-sized apartment was cozy (enough room for 2) with lots of natural light. Great location for anyone looking to explore the U-district on foot. It generally took 30-45 minutes to arrive downtown by bus (traffic on the freeway was awful at times). There were some great places to eat nearby Dan's apartment, including Chaco Canyon cafe (delicious food and coffee!), and a homemade ice cream place just a block away.  Having a grocery store so close was convenient too. 

"
2256124,34594882,2015-06-09,1511590,David,"Dan has an extremely convenient setup, here. He was excellently communicative and prepared, and his place was full of light."
2256124,35204594,2015-06-16,29607616,Sehee,"This is such a great place to stay! nice host! nice location! Thanks, Dan. "
2256124,35699073,2015-06-21,16871658,Ashley,"Dan was great at communicating he accommodated us checking in early. His place was exactly as pictured. Overall we had a great time visiting Seattle, would stay here again. "
2256124,36391981,2015-06-28,18145560,Rich,"The host was friendly and helpful. The accommodations were exactly as listed on the website. I thought the rental was good value for the money. 

The location was fine and there is a Safeway right across the street, which was very helpful. While there was on-street parking, on several occasions it was challenging to find a space close to the rental unit. "
2256124,36887931,2015-07-02,10656822,Caitlin,"Dan was a great host. When we arrived, he offered to help us with our bags; gave us a quick tour of the building/apartment; and made sure we were comfortable before he left. The room is a comfortable size with a lot of natural light and has everything you need if you're just vacationing.
The room was clean; building was very nice; and the Avenue over from the apartment has a lot of neat shops and good food options. I recommend this to single or couple vacationers/tourists like myself who plan to do a lot of exploring during the day and who prefer to stay in the eclectic towns outside the city (which I preferred)."
2256124,37960849,2015-07-12,4187058,Paul,"Small space with no frills, but perfect!"
2256124,39759823,2015-07-26,33703626,Lyndsey,"Awesome studio apartment/dorm style place. Perfect for a weekend in the city, has everything you need and great location. Dan was awesome and so friendly and helpful with anything that we needed or had questions about. Location is close to almost everything with just a short drive to major attractions, such as, safeco field or space needle. Only downside is parking, which is street parking and two hour limit between 7am-6pm. "
2256124,41118981,2015-08-04,15192280,Andrew,"Overall, great place and friendly host. "
2256124,41601977,2015-08-08,11728005,Mackenzie,"Dan was a great host! He was super responsive to my questions and very accommodating. The apartment is located near the University of Washington campus, which is a fun area and about a 25-minute direct bus ride to downtown. The bus stop is only a block away so that was easy. There was also a grocery store down the block which was perfect. Dan's apartment is a studio, so there isn't a lot of extra room, but if you're planning on being gone for most of the day it works out great. The kitchen was very well stocked (pans, cooking spray, etc.) and we made breakfast there every morning. The bathroom and bathroom sink are small, but manageable. "
2256124,42533016,2015-08-14,35519662,Irina,"Dan was an excellent host. He was very nice and provided all necessary information about the apartment and neighborhood. The pictures of the apartment included in the listing were accurate. When we arrived, we found the place to be very clean, and comfortable. There are many good places to eat nearby, and it is easy to commute to the center of the city by bus. He even mailed to us the stuffed animal my daughter left behind!  Overall, I am very pleased with my stay at Dan's apartment in Seattle."
2256124,43246202,2015-08-18,16685068,David,"Dan was a great host  - he was flexible with check-in and provided a clean and comfortable place for my time in Seattle. The apartment was perfect for seeing different parts of Seattle - close to the highway and the bus. If you're looking for a simple, yet accessible accommodation in Seattle, this is definitely the place. "
2256124,44799298,2015-08-29,8503526,Levi,"Dan was flexible with our check-in time and was friendly. The place is small and lacks some amenities, but it is a great value and in a convenient location in Seattle's U-District. We were able to cook a small breakfast for two and didn't have any problems with WiFi or getting in/out of the building. Overall it was a pleasant, comfortable stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable place to stay in Seattle."
2256124,46405081,2015-09-10,3260412,Sarah,"This is a private bedroom with a table and chairs in an apartment Dan frequently uses for work at intermittent times. The unit is small and lacks some amenities (no hair dryer), but is in a convenient location in Seattle's U-District. "
2256124,46895049,2015-09-14,4081669,Glenn,"My stay at Dan's was awesome. The place was perfect for my visit, everything you need in the neighborhood, close to bus routes into town, and super close to the freeway. The apartment is simple and spotless with everything you need. Dan was amazingly nice and helpful."
2256124,47384877,2015-09-18,41930548,Robert,"I had a pleasant stay here. There was ample room, as this unit appeared to be ADA accessible. Dan was friendly and flexible with check in/out time. The place is located near a lot of great restaurants and major bus routes. The surrounding eclectic neighborhood may be appealing to some, but I made sure not to be out too late at night."
2256124,48508949,2015-09-27,6576925,Ryan,Dan was extremely flexible when my flight got cancelled and I arrived ten hours late. I definitely appreciated that. Apartment was simple and clean. Good location for what I wanted to do.
2256124,49147407,2015-10-01,11776801,Eriko,"Dan was a great host, flexible and friendly. The apartment was simple and clean. The location was great, in safer area in U district, right next to the farmer's market, convenient for shopping, dining and taking bus."
2256124,50883115,2015-10-15,45549555,Jorge,"The place is great, plenty of restaurants and bars nearby and places to buy things if you prefer to cook. Mostly clean and simple apartment, perfect to crash at night and explore the city during the day (city center 30 min away, bus stops a block away). Dan was great, very easy to reach by phone and great with check in and out times. Nice place to stay overall!"
2256124,51066243,2015-10-17,45683582,Ruby,"We had a great time, this was a perfect landing spot for a busy weekend!"
2256124,51480780,2015-10-20,13824525,Zack,Great place to check out the city. Right by public transit and easy to catch an uber or lyft. Dan was incredibly friendly and worked around my late flight to let me in. Secure building. No complaints!
2256124,52113408,2015-10-26,45556198,Abby,"Absolutely loved this place. Located super close to campus and bus stops to get downtown. Adorable  and clean apartment, would definitely recommend!! "
1000883,5424986,2013-06-29,7057633,Alissa,Nicole was an excellent host and the cottage was clean and well kept.  I loved waking up to the bright colors on the walls and of the original pieces of art around the room. This cottage was in a great location. I got up and ran down to the shoreline to an amazing view of the Seattle skyline.  It was also just a short water taxi ride to the city. We had a great stay. 
1000883,5563425,2013-07-06,48995,Janie,"Nicole's cottage is absolutely adorable! My fiance' and I enjoyed every moment of our stay there. The space is decorated with vibrant hues and lovely art, complete with a contemporary and cozy ambiance.  Nicole is very sweet and she immediately shared the most fantastic 'must see' sites and restaurants in the area.  We will definitely be visiting here again!   "
1000883,5758064,2013-07-15,1639347,Amy,We had a wonderful time at Nicole's charming cottage!  The neighborhood was vibrant and the water and Alki Beach breathtaking! A real vacation away from home. The accomodations were very comfortable and well thought out with great attentention to detail! Even knives were sharp!! Nicole was delightful and available by phone as needed. We even experienced the Summerfest festival as an introductory welcome to the neighborhood!  We sure hope this breath of fresh air and ray of sunshine will be an available to us for a long time!  Amy and Bill
1000883,6109152,2013-07-30,7066404,Denise,"Airbnb is an incredible service. This was our first time using Airbnb and we will definitely continue to use it. Communication about our reservations and our stay was prompt and informational. Everything went like clockwork. Great business to use when traveling - so much more ""homey"" than a hotel."
1000883,6225661,2013-08-04,956684,Jc,"We had a great stay in Nicole's cottage and check-in was a breeze. It was nicely decorated, spacious, and the central heating worked great. We look forward to seeing Nicole and her sweet daughter Leila again! "
1000883,6576420,2013-08-17,924362,Miranda,Beautiful place. Quiet. Well appointed. Within walking distance of great food and activities. They were also super nice and welcoming. The space felt very big and open. We've stayed in 1 bedrooms that felt cramped- and this studio didn't at all!
1000883,6718055,2013-08-22,7989586,Trudi,"We had a really nice time at Nicole's cottage. We really enjoyed the fig butter that she made, and she and her family were very hospitable.  The location in West Seattle is quite pretty, and it's easy to get around, both in West Seattle and in Seattle itself. "
1000883,6918967,2013-08-30,7784589,Lesley,"This cottage was perfect for our needs! Located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to all that Seattle has to offer, this place was wonderful. Communication was super easy with Nicole and she had some great recommendations for nearby attractions and restaurants. The cottage was cozy, warm, cute and clean...very comfortable and we stayed for a week. There is a gorgeous old growth tree just outside the yard and you can smell the fresh sea air in the morning. Parking is convenient...Nicole and her family were happy to share the driveway just outside the door! Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a peaceful place to stay with very easy access (car, bike, walk, water taxi, ferry) to all of the life the Emerald City are has to offer. And airport is about 15 minute drive away!"
1000883,7035100,2013-09-04,1858675,Andy,"Nicole's place was awesome. Clean, quiet, and cozy. We used mass transit for the majority of our trip, and Nicole's place is very accessible via buses. Going to Bakery Nouveau is a must. Also, Alki is easily within walking distance. Great location, enjoyed every bit of our stay :-)"
1000883,7259368,2013-09-13,8440305,Julie,We had a wonderful time. Nicole was super nice and the cottage was awesome. Great location - everything was perfect!
1000883,7670846,2013-09-29,2594903,David,"My wife and I spent two nights in Nicole's West Seattle Cottage and we are so happy that we did! We were looking for a place that was convenient to both downtown Seattle and to the airport. This studio was the perfect location. We were able to take advantage of the water taxi and were happy that several restaurants were within walking distance as well. 
The cottage is comfortable, spacious, nicely decorated and well appointed. It is very private and quiet as well. Nicole was easy to communicate with and made us feel very welcomed. 
We had two great nights sleep and highly recommend this cottage retreat. Wish we could have stayed longer!"
1000883,7863386,2013-10-06,2314801,Megan,"Nicole's guest cottage was a great home-base from which to explore West Seattle. You'll love the heated floors and comfy bed. Skylights are a nice touch, but perhaps not so great if you like to sleep in. We were really pleased with this booking and would stay here again. "
1000883,9033203,2013-12-02,9898416,Henry,"I was moving to the area and stayed in Nicole's cottage for about three weeks, and it was a great experience.  It was a great independent ""base"" during my first weeks in Seattle.  Nicole and her husband have done a great job with the space.  It was comfortable to spend time in, and, in practical terms, also had everything I needed.  And spending a few minutes with Nicole and her family when I would run into them was always enjoyable.  I lucked out."
1000883,39209403,2015-07-21,1530118,Willis,"My stay at Nicole's cottage was simply amazing! I had the opportunity to meet her family & they were equally as warm & welcoming as she was. The cottage was very accommodating, & Nicole went above & beyond to ensure all my needs were met. Her home is conveniently close to downtown which made it accessible for my work obligations as well as indulging in all the great tourist attractions, restaurants, & nightlife in the city. I highly recommend staying at Nicole's cool cottage if you're planning a visit in Seattle!"
1000883,41631723,2015-08-08,18583752,Bryce,The neighborhood is adorable with lots of restaurants and parks close by. Nicole is very sweet and was always available if we ever needed help with anything. The shower was amazing and the finishings were great! It was the perfect quiet sanctuary for us while enjoying our vacation.
1000883,44811624,2015-08-29,40052831,Rob,"The Cottage was great for my week long stay for work in Seattle. Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Nicole as I had some odd long work hours. The location is great and close to Alki Beach, which is a must visit if you're in Seattle if you ask me. Loved the restaurants there along the water. Long hours meant wanting to have a good nights sleep and the bed in the Cottage was extremely comfy! Waking up to the light from the skylights is another plus! Would recommend it to anyone!"
1000883,49159712,2015-10-01,12995898,Susan,The cottage was a great place to stay with its lovely skylights and amenities. The proximity to downtown and Alki beach made touring easy and great running. Nicole was a great host and fun to visit even though my schedule was packed. I will definitely stay here again.  
1000883,55628406,2015-12-03,8715487,Jenny,"I really enjoyed my stay at Nicole's cottage. The space was great and very comfy. Even though we didn't get to meet, we spoke over the phone and she was super helpful.

5927083,29958412,2015-04-14,1125196,Paul,"Randy and Lynn are amazing and generous hosts! They made me feel like a member of their family. I felt at ease and comfortable in a cozy home where they have raised their kids and clearly created a lot of happy memories. Shelves overflowing with interesting books, a lovely TV set and TiVo with all my favorite shows, french press coffee, beautiful garden and panoramic views from all the bedrooms. Within walking distance to the rest of Capitol Hill, and on a major bus line to the U-District and Downtown. Make your next Seattle stay a great experience and stay here!"
5927083,35280578,2015-06-16,1819314,Jody,"After another AirBnb host cancelled our reservation at the last-minute, Randy graciously and quickly responded to our reservation request. (Thanks!) his home is spacious, comfortable and conveniently located--not toe toon that Randy is a friendly, welcoming host. This is a great place to stay in Seattle! "
5927083,35518709,2015-06-19,10641647,Jill,"I stayed at Randy's for a couple of nights. I enjoyed the view from the back bedroom out over their lovely garden and Madison Valley. The room was spacious and quiet. Public amenities and transport were all within walking distance, important to me as I was without a car. Randy and his wife were friendly and laid back. I enjoyed my stay at their home."
5927083,35751714,2015-06-21,26123284,Ellie,"Lynn and Randy provided excellent accomodations while I stayed at their house! They are located in an area in Capitol Hill that is near all the action, but not exactly right in it..so there is a perfect balance of peace and action if that is what you're looking for. Their house has a cute backyard with a beautiful garden and spectacular views of the mountains/Rainier..especially if you're staying in this room! Lynn and Randy were out of town when I first arrived, so their friend Tim was kind enough to show me around Capitol Hill and grab dinner/drinks with me! I'm moving from Chicago to Seattle in the near future and my first impression of Seattle was made a thousand times better with my fantastic stay here. I would recommend a stay with Lynn and Randy to anyone! :)"
5927083,36070016,2015-06-24,16752582,Iris,The communication was clear and immediate. The place was accurate as described. 
5927083,37021913,2015-07-03,15099850,Lorenzo,"The Cerf were great - perfect b&b hosts - interesting people with busy lives - but who take a real interest in their guests and in the world.  The room is just beautiful, large with a wonderful treehouse view.  As others have said, it felt more like you were in the home of family or friends.  Really enjoyed my few days there and would stay again when I am in Seattle.  They were easy to communicate with via texts to  make arrangements.  Great overall experience."
5927083,38417336,2015-07-15,35262451,Albert,"Randy's home is peaceful and very spacious. The house has a big backyard with a hammock (a big plus especially in summer!). Not only that, Randy and his family have been very gracious during my visit. They invited me to breakfast and allowed me to extend my stay a few hours past checkout time to accommodate my circumstances then. Highly recommended place to stay when you are in Seattle!"
5927083,39199229,2015-07-21,8686116,Denis,"We just spent a very pleasant six nights in Randy and Lynn’s house.  They were both wonderful hosts who made us feel comfortable and welcome in their home.  They are very interesting people – fun to speak with and we really enjoyed visiting with them.  A particularly memorable example is the nice breakfast we shared at which Randy served us eggs in egg cups fresh from their chickens in the back yard coop!

Our room was large enough to not feel cramped, and the view from the large window was simply amazing.  Even though we were out most of every day, my wife enjoyed stealing a few moments to curl up by the window and read.  Be aware that you will not have an entire floor of the house to yourself as with some options, but this was never a problem and we had all the quiet privacy we needed.   

The neighborhood was quiet, pretty and safe, and very convenient.  It seemed like we were never more than a 15 minute drive from anywhere we wanted to go.  All in all a great stay!"
5927083,41648736,2015-08-08,21970221,Lauren,The host canceled this reservation 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5927083,41963653,2015-08-10,14074492,Dmitry,"Staying with Randy and Lynn was an awesome first Airbnb experience! Even though they were out of town, it was arranged that I could get in my room. The room was as beautiful as in the pictures - the view is simply great. Sadly I was almost always out and I only chatted with Randy and Lynn a tiny bit, but their family and the dog are awesome!"
5927083,43503860,2015-08-20,37057444,Kate,"What a wonderful first airbnb experience! My bed was super comfortable, the view was gorgeous! The neighborhood was very walkable and quiet. I felt so welcome and enjoyed chatting with Randy and Ellen. The garden is so lovely and is a perfect spot to catch up on work or read (and it has strawberries!). 

I really can't say enough about how great my stay was. Highly recommend!"
5927083,49022320,2015-09-30,28218572,Dana,Randy and Lynn are very warm and friendly. They make you feel right at home with a nice cup of coffee and smiles. The Garden room has magnificent mountain views and even a view of Mount Rainer on a clear day.  The bed is super comfortable tucked between multiple windows. There is also a two person couch in the room for light reading and a desk to plan out your next adventure. Come and go as you please there are always friendly faces around. 
5927083,54576949,2015-11-22,28472763,Richard,"Lynn and Randy were super friendly and welcoming. Their house is almost like a home away from home. The room is just gorgeous!
The view is spectacular and the bed super-comfy.
Lynn and Randy were always interested and invited me to numerous activities. I really felt comfortable at their place.
Also, the neighborhood in which their house is located is super safe with tons of bus lines close by. 
So, thumbs up, for sure!"
5549211,27977959,2015-03-15,10096294,Carlos,This was honestly the most amazing Airbnb experience I've ever had. The apartment is beautiful and Mercy made everything perfect. Thank you so much.
5549211,28535222,2015-03-25,19531934,Dolly,"1. Most courteous and hospitable host family, which made us feel the rental as home away from home. Mercy even in advance picked/shopped for us our basic necessities to get us started like juice, milk, honey, tea, bread etc.

2. Central Ballard location with great neighborhood and quite location

3. The condo is in excellent shape, with all facilties

5549211,28891121,2015-03-31,28722728,Dana,The host made us feel welcomed.  The neighborhood was peasant and seemed safe.  The host had great communication.
5549211,29421621,2015-04-07,10513367,Niall,"We had a great stay here. The apartment is very clean and modern, the local area Ballard is great, and there is a bus from just outside going straight to Downtown. Mercy and her family were wonderful hosts, overall a great few days in Seattle."
5549211,29856604,2015-04-13,12336072,Laura,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at the Plum apartment. Mercy and her family were welcoming, helpful and kind. We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood and exploring everything it has to offer. The apartment is downstairs from the main family house. It's a good space for early birds. With two young kids the days start early. That works well for us, because we are eagles not owls. Thanks to Mercy for a wonderful stay... And for letting me borrow some nail polish "
5549211,30048661,2015-04-16,30801087,Louis,"We had a wonderful two nights in the Plum Apartment. The space is super clean, modern, and bright. The neighborhood is quiet, but just two blocks from everything Ballard. Mercy stocked the fridge with breakfast goodies and made us feel very welcome. She even took the time to talk with us about her bees and garden! We definitely recommend staying here!"
5549211,30234745,2015-04-19,7831757,Susan,"Our stay at the Plum apt. was perfect! The space is super clean, bright and well appointed. It was very comfy and we would stay here again in a heartbeat! Thank you Mercy!"
5549211,30877685,2015-04-28,1678887,Kelly,"We had such a great stay! The apartment is clean, beautiful, well-lit, and well-stocked. Mercy has done a great job stocking the kitchen with everything you need to actually cook, which is not always the case with rental spots. The neighborhood is really fun, with great coffee, food, biking, and shopping. But most importantly, Mercy and her family are wonderfully hospitable. They went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Can't recommend this place highly enough!"
5549211,31191729,2015-05-03,9873526,Ramya,"We stayed here for 3 nights with our toddler and absolutely loved it. The apartment is spacious, well-lit and has great amenities. A lot of thought has been put into making everything accessible and comfortable. Mercy is a great host and was available to answer all our questions. Won't hesitate to stay here again. Highly recommend this place! "
5549211,32066550,2015-05-13,30835076,Andre,"Our stay here was fantastic and the place was incredible.  It was as clean as can be when we arrived, and the fridge was filled with a small breakfast all set for the next morning.  The beds are comfortable and we were always able to get a good night's rest. The Ballard neighborhood has a lot of great places to go to, and the location has easy access to the rest of Seattle. I would recommend this place for anyone staying in Seattle. "
5549211,32349593,2015-05-17,2346895,Andrea,"Mercy was so lovely to deal with.  I contacted her ahead of time to ask if she would mind setting up/making the extra bed since we would get in late and wanted a smooth transition for our kids.  She was happy to do it!  There was a tray of simple breakfast supplies waiting for us in the refrigerator, which made the next morning so easy . . . we felt pampered!  Her husband made an effort to welcome us when we crossed paths outside and asked if we needed anything as well.  The apartment was clean, easy to access, and is located in a very fun part of Ballard.  The beds were comfortable and the kids loved watching a little TV in the morning while snuggled up on the couch bed.  We will definitely come back!  "
5549211,32733153,2015-05-20,28971099,Samantha,"The space is beautiful, light, airy, and modern. The bathroom and kitchen are gorgeous and look brand new. Everything was immaculate.  Many nice touches, like kitchen and bathroom supplies, and even a white noise machine in the bedroom. The apartment is in a quiet residential neighborhood. There are great restaurants and cafes nearby. The hosts are very friendly, considerate and professional. I would highly recommend staying here. "
5549211,32856710,2015-05-22,23079704,Laura,"What a delight it was to spend our time at Mercy's. This apartment is right off a main road and close to everything. The bed was so comfy I slept like a baby.
She even left us coffee & yummy bread & jam for breakfast. Very good find!"

We rode our bikes from the Plum House to the Washington Park Arboretum - great fun.  The house was roomy and comfortable.   We had a great time.  Thanks Mercy!"
5549211,33734662,2015-05-31,17325509,Rob,"Mercy made us feel remarkably welcome.  She was a great communicator, was warm and inviting and worked with us to make sure we had everything we needed.  The place was as described, immaculate and cozy.  It was in a convenient part of town and on a beautiful lot.  There was a little noise during peak hours but that is to be expected given the set up and is indicated on the description.  It was perfectly quiet at night when it really matters so it did not affect us.  I would stay here again any time I am in Seattle."
5549211,34544065,2015-06-09,21711950,Jerry,"We had a wonderful time at the Plum Apartment. It was quiet, in a nice neighborhood in Ballard, and close to several restaurants and bars. We had everything we needed without needing to contact Mercy throughout our stay. It does get a little warm during the summer so keeping the windows open will cool the apartment down a bit. Would definitely stay here again."
5549211,35206082,2015-06-16,29883117,Deborah,"We just spent a week in the Plum Apartment.  It is exactly as described.  It is very spacious, comfortable and well stocked.  We did not have a car as it was conveniently located near our daughter's apt in Ballard so did not have to deal with parking.  We did make a mess of the trash/recycling requirements and do apologize to Mercy for that.  Also, we left a pair of eye glasses in the apt and Mercy was kind enough to mail them back to us. I would definitely highly recommend these accommodations especially to environmentally conscious travelers."
5549211,35436100,2015-06-18,13971154,Bailey,"We highly recommend the plum apartment! My boyfriend and I recently stayed at this location for a few days on a trip to Seattle. Since I used to live in the area, I wanted to avoid the hassle of trying to maneuver downtown in prime tourist season, and Ballard has always been a favorite neighborhood of mine. Not only was the plum apartment in a beautiful area, it was within a few blocks of Ballard's main street, and a short drive to the locks and Golden Gardens beach. The apartment itself was gorgeous, modern, and pristine. Mercy herself was incredibly welcoming and thoughtful-a perfect hostess! We will absolutely stay here again in the future. "
5549211,35640195,2015-06-21,6158075,Nanna,"Didn't meet the host because the were out of town but really nice place in a great neighborhood.  Nice with busline 40 so close by, so it was easy to get to downtown in 30-40 min.
The apartment had everything we needed and it even had bread and coffee in the fridge. 
Very recommendable. "
5549211,35815906,2015-06-22,33531827,Kevin,"The accommodation at the plum apartment was completely adequate. 
However, I cannot give a positive review following our present experience.

Mercy had provided the information regarding the property. She had indicated that she would be out of town and the residence above our unit would also be occupied by guests.

I had decided to take two friends who had travelled overseas to Seattle.

On our first evening, we were awakened at 3am to the sound of heavy footsteps and yelling coming from the upstairs unit. The occupants upstairs had decided to throw a party on an early Monday morning. 

I went outside and noticed two individuals on the upper deck smoking marihuana. I went upstairs to advise the occupants to keep the noise level down. I had noticed approximately 11 people in the unit. All appeared to be intoxicated.

One of the male's we spoke to had suggested that the previous guests in our unit did not mind the noise. We had asked for them to keep the noise level down, As their voices were carrying into the unit below. The male himself, was intoxicated. He merely suggested that we 'join the party'. After a series of non-constructive arguing with the male he He advised he would take the party up to the top level of the home.

The noise persisted. I had left mercy both a phone message and an email. I did not receive any correspondence.

I called air B&B who advised that the occupants upstairs had the place booked for one more day. The noise level was too excessive and we could not stay there any longer. We were advised by the Air b&b accounted to find a hotel and the first nights stay would be compensated.

After scrambling to find a hotel in dt Seattle during a PGA golf tournament, we have been displaced waiting to check into our room for noon.

Air b&b agreed to refund the rental price for the plum apartment. However, they had advised that they 'would have to look into' compensating us for the first nights stay into this hotel as the reimbursement nullified the initial agreement to cover the first nights stay.

I really hope air b&b does the right thing here. This has been my first experience using this service and I can hounestly say I'm completely turned off by it. This experience has ruined what was supposed to me a memorable trip.

5549211,36583121,2015-06-29,25039667,Kendall,Really amazing apartment in a great neighborhood. Great location and walking distance to all the Ballard shops and restaurants. Mercy was very accommodating and sweet. Would definitely stay there again!
5549211,36874299,2015-07-02,33328134,Jay,"The Plum Apartment was amazing for my wife and me.  It was as clean, spacious, and cool during the very hot days that we were visiting Seattle.  The access is very easy and the location is great, just a short walk to downtown Ballard and all of its restaurants, bars, and shops. Mercy and her family were not there during our stay, but she was very responsive to our questions via email."
5549211,37292942,2015-07-06,21763536,Bryce,Plum was great. Modern and very comfortable. I would highly recommend it. Walking distance to many great restaurants and bars.
5549211,38403528,2015-07-15,2582566,Laura,"We had a lovely stay at the Plum apartment! The space is even more beautiful than the photos. Everything was clean and the unit had all the amenities you could want! My boyfriend and I spent a few nights here after exploring the downtown area of Seattle. Ballard has a lot to offer by ways of food, shops, culture and water views and Mercy's apartment was close to it all! Parking was super easy should you rent a car or drive one to the area. Most sounds can be heard from the house above the unit so this wouldn't be the place to go if your goal is to sit in silence but luckily we are busy bees when we travel, as one should be in the beautiful PNW!!!!"
5549211,38821666,2015-07-19,28012150,Florence,The Plum apartment was perfect! The pictures do not do this place justice. The apartment is located in a great neighbourhood with many great restaurants at a walking distance. The few things left for our first morning in the fridge were a nice attention. The bread was terrific!! The house was gorgeous and the backyard was great. I would definitely recommend this place. 
5549211,39420181,2015-07-23,34578818,Sharon,"Mercy was responsive in accepting our request and providing instructions on how to access the apartment.  This Ballard apartment is spacious and well-equipped; the accommodations are clean and comfortable.  The location is excellent with easy street parking.  A nice coffee shop (Java Bean), excellent French bakery (Cafe Besalu), and grocery store (QFC) are located right around the corner.  Numerous great restaurants are just a few blocks further. We walked to the Ballard locks (easy walk) and to Golden Gardens beach (longer hike).  Fixings for a simple breakfast left in the fridge to get us started were a nice touch.  We really enjoyed our stay and would love to return."
5549211,40253448,2015-07-29,25846953,Kathryn,Perfect spot in Ballard to relax but still have access to restaurants and shops.  Just as pictured.  Very cute and clean.  Thank you for accommodating a shorter stay and for such a relaxing time!
5549211,40714932,2015-08-02,18180104,Tijana,"One bedroom modern, gorgeous, clean, and well stocked apartment walking distance to all that Ballard has to offer. The host thought of everything one might ever need. She was responsive and flexible. This is a basement apartment with plenty of windows and light. The host actually put in some blackout curtains after I enquired about them, prior to our arrival. During our stay the house upstairs was also rented out and we could hear the people walking around. After contacting Mercy, she got in touch with the other guests and asked them to be mindful of us...which helped some. I'm sure that when the hosts are at home this is less of an issue as they are aware of their guests below. We really loved this space and had a positive experience overall. We hope to be back soon! Thanks for everything! :)"
5549211,41137425,2015-08-04,6235491,Tedros,"We had a fantastic experience in this beautiful, light-filled apartment. I would absolutely stay here again!"
5549211,42110252,2015-08-11,29596820,Casey,"What a lovely, well-equipped place to call home for a few days! The comfortably modern apartment is right in the heart of Ballard, within walking distance of the neighborhood's many shops, restaurants, and bars. Hosts are generous with their knowledge of the area and with the goodies found there—so nice to have fresh sourdough bread and coffee waiting for us. You couldn't ask for more."
5549211,42430928,2015-08-13,7011618,Cristobal,"What an amazing place. All our family loved it!!
Amazingly well-equipped, very modern apartment and in a great location (right in the heart of Ballard, walking distance of almost everything)
Easy parking for your car if you are driving, it has a beautiful patio that our kid enjoyed and the neighborhood was peaceful and noiseless
A great place that we felt like home during our stay.

I would definitely come back again to Mercy's house if I have the chance."
5549211,42823894,2015-08-16,30499541,Amy,"Beautiful place, very homey, great location, easy in every way. We would definitely stay there again!"
5549211,44405301,2015-08-26,4968750,Shizuko,"The apartment was perfect!  Cozy but spacious enough to host my family of 5.  Everything was VERY clean and modern, and we absolutely loved staying here.  It also stayed very cool inside, which was nice given the hot weather. "
5549211,44899959,2015-08-30,34396449,Jared,"This place is great, I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle.  I traveled to Seattle with a friend for a wedding and we were very pleased with our choice to stay here.  The apartment has a very updated and modern touch with plenty of space.  My friend even slept on the pull out couch and he said it was the most comfortable pull out couch he's ever slept on.  Mercy is very accommodating and very responsive when I would email her with questions about the apartment.  She and her family made us feel welcome from the beginning and they even left us some local food to get us started on our first morning.

The surrounding area of Ballard is a lot of fun, there are tons of great restaurants, bars, shops, and even a 24hr grocery store all within walking distance from this location.  When we felt like being ""tourists"" and going downtown to the space needle or visiting the University of Washington we were 4 miles (a short cab ride) from both.

I can't recommend staying in Ballard and at this location enough."
5549211,45553414,2015-09-04,32078582,Kate,"What an incredible stay my husband and I had at the lovely Plum Apartment! We were in town for a wedding and most of the pre-wedding festivities took place in or near Ballard - we were right in the heart of it! Everyone kept remarking how perfectly located we were! The apartment itself is fantastic - wonderful light and layout, comfortable bed and pillows, awesome television set-up with Netflix, updated kitchen with everything we needed and a great washer and dryer! Having been on the road traveling for almost three weeks we felt at home in the Plum Apartment. Mercy was quick to respond, generous and kind. We can't wait to come back to Seattle and stay there for a full week!! "
5549211,46607710,2015-09-12,40430807,Karen,Great location with tons of places to walk to!  The apartment looks just like the photos- very nice!  
5549211,49671966,2015-10-05,44109369,Mark," My son and I did some sightseeing in Seattle and stayed at the Plum Apartment during our visit. This was our first Airbnb experience and we may never stay in a hotel again! The accommodations were perfect. The apartment was well equipped with all the comforts of home and tastefully decorated. My son used the pull out sofa bed/couch and said it was very comfortable. My bad back enjoyed the memory foam mattress in the bedroom. The apartment was very clean, modern and met all of our expectations as advertised. The location couldn't be beat. The house was on a quiet side street and within 1 block of public transportation and 2-6 block walk of a full service grocery store, coffee shops, superb bakeries, bars, excellent restaurants and night life. We had a rental car and found it a very short drive to all the sights in town and nearby burbs. Street parking close to the house was easy.You could easily do without a car and use mass transit and cabs from this location.
Mercy was "" incredibly""  responsive and helpful with our reservations and during our stay. 
The Plum Apartment is a terrific place to stay, in an excellent neighborhood   and located close to all the Seattle attractions and offered by a terrific host.
I only hope my next Airbnb experience will be as nice as this one has been.
Mark"
5549211,50266266,2015-10-11,5478632,Anne,"Lovely two night stay @ Plum Apt! Perfect size for 3 of us (me, my husband and teen daughter). Quiet neighborhood yet close to shopping and other things we were doing in Ballard. 
"
5549211,52698416,2015-11-01,1014166,Johannes,"Even though Mercy wasn't around when we arrived at the Plum apartment, she provided great detailed information upfront (access code, fridge had basics already stacked). She also has a neighbor looking after the house and is available for questions.

The apartment is great, clean and a wonderful location close to bakeries, groceries and the center of old Ballard.
"
5549211,58548154,2016-01-03,20853503,Rachel,"We had a lovely time at the Plum Apartment! The space was beautiful and very functional for us, three guests. Mercy left some staples and coffee in the fridge to get us started, which was a very nice touch. The apartment is in a great area, close to shops and restaurants. We will definitely be back!"
6007267,34639588,2015-06-10,32009836,Dwight,"To start with, we absolutely loved staying at this apartment - just wish it had been available for our entire Seattle vacation.  Hannah left an instruction sheet on the dining table that answered most of our questions.  She placed info about Seattle on the coffee table - places to explore, restaurants to eat at, etc.  She invited us to make ourselves at home.  The apt. was neat & tidy and had everything we needed.  Ground level apt. made it easy to move in and out.  There was a TV available, but we never had time to use it.  The location was good for us because it was only a short 5 minute walk to our daughter's apt.  We loved walking down to the University district with all the fun shopping & restaurants, also Trader Joe's & Safeway were short walks for food.  I don't know if parking would have been a problem because we did not have a car.  There is a fire station next door, so there was a lot of siren activity, even at night.  We enjoyed sitting out on the chairs on the patio.  Can't say enough good things about this apt. - wish we could stay here each time we come to visit our daughter!  "
6007267,35086239,2015-06-15,5315570,Sarah,"Fabulous place, close to UW, clean, and comes with a VERY sweet cat, if you don't mind taking care of her. Hannah wasn't in town, but her friend coordinated with me, was super responsive, and it was easy to get keys/drop them off when I left. The place was clean and had everything you needed! Thanks, Hannah!"
6007267,35795777,2015-06-22,29011783,Sichang,"The room Hannah left to us was much cleaner than the photo. I originally thought living with Norrie might be a little bit troublesome since we don't haven't raised any Kitty. But it turned out to be a pleasant experience and she is just cute!
Generally, nice room, comfortable bed, good location. Would recommend it to future travelers. "
9473312,58376194,2016-01-02,35526072,Megan,We had a fantastic time in Jamie's bungalow. The location was great - very cute neighborhood and close to downtown. The space was a good size and cutely decorated. The beds were really comfortable. Communication was prompt and thorough. We would definitely recommend them!
9489310,58254192,2016-01-01,50915611,Morgan,Colleen was a sweetheart and this room was beautiful and quiet. A wonderful private place to escape. We will definitely be returning next time we need brief getaway!
7420762,49162336,2015-10-01,13967830,Sheila,"We feel honored to be Brian's first guest.  He was a super hostess and  made us feel right at home.  He allowed us to have a flexible check in time with good directions about the key etc.  The apartment was clean, orderly and comfortable.  

The location was perfect for us from walking at Green Lake Park to providing everything from good places within walking distance to eat and shop and a short ride to downtown Seattle.  We hiked most everyday and had easy access to major roads etc.  
 
It was comfortable sleeping in the comfy bed and quiet.   The kitchen was stocked with everything needed to be able to cook.  A  tv package and internet service was provided for us to use, etc.   We will definitely want to stay again on our next visit to Seattle.  Hats off to Brian!!! Great Job!!
"
7420762,50113922,2015-10-09,44958991,Nathan,"Even before we arrived, Brian was a very accommodating and gracious host. We had to make a few changes to our schedule and he handled that very accomodatingly. You can definitely tell Brian is very well travelled and it shows in his hosting. Aside from being very aesthetically pleasing, clean, and functional, the unit was stocked with items that only a person that has travelled a lot themselves would know to be necessary. Small additions like chopsticks, scissors, and even the mirror setup reflect an intuitive and thorough knowledge of what a traveler needs. Brian is a very courteous host, and has a very good balance between being proactively helpful and respecting your privacy. The unit itself is only a short drive away from the many borough neighborhoods surrounding Seattle like Ballard and Northgate, but still maintains a large enough distance from the hustle and bustle where you'll feel at home and calm in the residence. All the appliances work well, and I felt like I was cooking in my own kitchen. We stayed there a week, and wish we could've stayed longer. If you find yourself and maybe up to two other people wanting a comfortable and worry free place to stay near Seattle, look no further."
7420762,50542817,2015-10-12,30058699,Katherine,"Our stay in the Villa Maria was everything we were hoping for!  What a terrific location, warm and inviting atmosphere and a very accommodating host.  Our stay met all our expectations and then some.  We also appreciate that you checked in with us earlier that day to warn us about traffic and offered tips on where to go since we were new to the city.  It was also nice that you had city and state maps and guidebooks available - as well as a blow dryer (might seem like a little thing, but it means a lot). We'll see you on our next visit to Seattle! Ivan and Katherine"
7420762,50983611,2015-10-16,37039633,Dan,"What a great property.  Quiet. Comfortable and nicely appointed.  Felt truly at home here.  I'm definitely going to be booking here again.  Brian was quite helpful when needed which, truth be told, was only one time when I needed an iron and ironing board.  It's a beautiful home, a beautiful neighborhood and a great choice for staying in Seattle for business or pleasure.   Also, keep an eye out for the Easter eggs, if you like a good chuckle!  Nice touch!   "
7420762,51343910,2015-10-19,832671,Keren,"Brian was a great host - I was coordinating the rental for my in-laws who are not tech-savvy. Brian was very helpful and accommodating, and make their experience calm and easy. They loved the apartment!"
7420762,53257549,2015-11-07,45473454,Sam,"I enjoyed my 3 week stay at Villa Maria so much that I think my wife was getting concerned I may not come home to LA. Brian is an A+ host, and just an all-around great guy. The apartment is so nicely situated I would bet you'll want to move right in too. Neighborhood is perfect. Away from the hustle and bustle of downtown or other more active neighborhoods- yet just blocks away from all of that excitement when you want it. Easy bus access for one of the main bus lines that takes you directly into the city. The immediate neighborhood has a very good coffee shop (Fresh Flours) and 4-5 restaurants that are very good for when you just want a quick bite and get back to your room. Don't hesitate on renting this unit! Very clean, very comfortable, and very well looked after. Brian has considered every last detail so that you don't have to! I loved it. I'll be back as soon as I am able."
7420762,54269285,2015-11-17,2390134,Heather,"The suite at Villa Maria was even better than anticipated! 

The suite itself was impeccably clean, very comfortable and exceptionally well located. We had everything we needed and thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Despite the cold and rainy weather, the suite was completely warm and cozy! 

The queen bed was super comfortable and the little ""nook"" was perfect for our youngest (5 years old). The pull out sofa was firm but comfortable and there were plenty of extra bed linens to make it all work.

Parking was easily found on the street just outside but we mostly chose to walk and take the bus; Phinney Ave was only a block away and is home to a number of lovely little shops and restaurants. 

Although we didn't have a chance to meet Brian in person, he made sure we had absolutely everything we needed to access the suite upon our arrival and made a number of great suggestions as to local restaurants that suited our family perfectly. We did have a chance to meet his room mate and dog and both were extremely warm and friendly. Brian was easy to reach via email/text and was very responsive both prior to and during our stay.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Villa Maria!"
7420762,54784806,2015-11-23,10368040,Lauren,"We loved our stay in Brian's apartment.  The space was very inviting and comfortable.  The location is outstanding, just a block away from a great street with lots of interesting restaurants and shops, a short walk to the Woodland Park Zoo (which our 3 year old loved) and a hop skip and jump to Greenlake Park.  

Brian was very good at keeping us informed and made us feel welcome.  The house is filled with interesting decor, great books on the local area and enough basic kitchen supplies that we easily prepared  a few meals during our week long stay.  We really appreciated the soft bed linens and fluffy towels too.  Thanks for a great place to stay!  We will definitely be back! "
7420762,54986166,2015-11-27,44382681,Shannon,Great location!!!  Perfect rental apartment.  Would stay again!!
7420762,55148618,2015-11-28,49118761,Jonathan,We enjoyed our stay there. We had a great time. Safe neighborhood. Really nice quiet place. Space was bigger than it looked in the pictures. Close to shopping and tourist stuff.
7420762,55383825,2015-12-01,2538405,Mary,Brian's unit was a great home base for our long weekend in Seattle! Everything was exactly as described. We especially enjoyed the big kitchen and the fun neighborhood. Brian is an excellent host - he kept in touch before our visit and his attention to thoughtful details added to the good experience.
7420762,55698930,2015-12-04,37039633,Dan,"Second time I have stayed here.  Not the last, either.  Great place."
7420762,55935145,2015-12-07,28994879,Sara,"Brian, We very helpful in responding to questions about the apartment. He was also very generous and purchased a pack and play for our baby so we did not have to bring one with us. "
7420762,56319286,2015-12-12,3032232,Kevin,"Brian was super easy to coordinate with and accessing the unit couldn't have been simpler. The location is great - tucked into a sweet Seattle neighborhood with cafes, bookstore, restaurants within walking distance as well as the zoo. Bus access to downtown was also a breeze. Recommended."
7420762,57769421,2015-12-29,17816276,Youngmin,"Brian welcomed us as bringing extra pot and pan for cooking that we asked:) We felt very thankful.
He was a cool and nice.
Villa Maria is neat and cozy place to stay. 
The location is perfect . I went back and forth UW and Bellevue almost everyday. Easy to accesss. 
Me and my husband walked every morning around neiborhood.(safe & sound) We enjoyed clean and cool breath.
I liked its kitchen very much. So spacious and Easy to cook. 
We stayed nine days. Our family made a wonderful memories of Christmas holidays. 
 
"
7420762,58017550,2015-12-31,47430343,Crystal,"While Brian was traveling a friend of his made us feel very welcome, she let us drop our stuff in the room early and had a lot of great recommendations for the area. The apartment was great! super clean and aesthetically pleasing. "
7420762,58302021,2016-01-02,500918,Elizabeth,"This was a lovely little apartment in a fantastic neighborhood with easy walking distance to restaurants and retail. It gets plenty of light and has a very comfortable bed. The lock box outside made it easy to access and Brian was great at communicating. Since it is the lower floor you can hear the movement of those living above you, but it wasn't excessively loud. We would definitely stay here again!"
5310193,41731274,2015-08-09,29872434,Jeremy,"Scott's house was clean when we arrived and decorated with fresh flowers. I learned that most houses in Seattle don't have air conditioning, and fans were included in the bedrooms to help with the heat (since we arrived during a heatwave).

It was located in a great neighborhood with restaurants and groceries within easy walking distance. Seattle Center (i.e. the Space Needle) was within walking distance, but required going up and down a pretty steep hill. Ubering to Pike Place Market and Safeco Field was around $10-$20.

Scott does have pets (both a dog and cat), though there wasn't visible pet hair downstairs. If you have allergies, you should plan accordingly."
5310193,54021733,2015-11-15,20596684,Robert,"The house was in a great location and was nice and roomy. Entry via lockbox was seamless. The alarm code was tricky the first time and didn't work, which was a very loud experience. No problems after the first time. Unfortunately, the listing didn't show bedroom pictures. Two of the bedrooms had great beds, but the third was simply a mattress on the floor. There was pet and human hair on the sheets of this mattress. Cell phone reception was poor for T-Mobile and Sprint, but great for AT&T. Lyft drivers were available in abundance. "
5310193,57668693,2015-12-28,28167748,Robin,"Scott was very responsive and provided all of the info needed to be comfortable in their home.  The house was exactly as pictured - it is very nice and had everything we needed to cook for/host 16 people for a family dinner.  It was a little tight, but fun!  The neighborhood is quiet and the location is great -  it is easy to get to attractions like the space needle, Pike's Market etc.  I definitely recommend Scott as a host and would love to stay there the next time we travel to Seattle.  "
2586642,13965863,2014-06-09,15045273,Justine,"We truly enjoyed our stay in this private, fresh and airy, newly renovated, comfortable suite! Emily and Daniel were great hosts! They immediately responded to any requests or questions we asked by email or text.

The location is great! Just blocks from Upper Queen Anne (we enjoyed the uphill ""hike"" to the center and the downhill stroll home), one block from Whole Foods, walking access to the Elliott Bay Trail along the Sound, and a short drive to Discovery Park, Ballard, and so much more!"
2586642,14446280,2014-06-19,15646278,Allan,"The listing was exactly as presented and met all of our needs. Since we were going to events in Capitol Hill, Ballard, Fremont and the U-District this was a great central location. The patio is a nice feature, as are the new appliances and furniture. Emily was always available when needed and check-in and check-out was easy. Would rent the unit again in the future."
2586642,14705417,2014-06-24,16260168,Liz,We stayed here with another couple and absolutely loved it! The space is small but still gave enough privacy for the four of us. No complaints.
2586642,19405933,2014-09-12,15744997,Jennifer,"We had a lovely time staying in Emily and Daniel's 2 bedroom get away. It has a separate entrance and is completely private from the upstairs dwelling. There is a nice deck with a fire pit and large table with chairs off the main bedroom which we were allowed to use as our private outdoor space. Our stay was longer than the typical trip. We were in the space for 2+ months waiting for a house to be built.  This worked well for our small family for an extended period. Ballard, the space needle, centennial park, and the heart of Queen Anne are all a short drive away. "
2586642,20053799,2014-09-22,4240324,Julia,"This place was the perfect place to stay in Seattle. The apartment is the lower unit of a very cute house in Queen Anne. It's very close to the D Line, a quick bus ride into Lower Queen Anne, Downtown Seattle or Ballard. The place was clean and very cute. Emily had scones, coffee, and fruit in the fridge for us which was so nice to wake up to -- and unexpected. Thank you for a great stay, we loved it! "
2586642,20878055,2014-10-06,21961627,Randall Jr,"Emily provided pastries and juice, which was nice, upon arrival. The unit was a nice size but there were a list of other items that provided an unsatisfied feeling after our stay. When I expressed them to Emily, she indicated that they were ""courtesy"" items and not a requirement of rental. Some of the items I mentioned to her were; that we did not receive hand towels, the bath towels we did receive were musty, there was mold in the tea canister, water was left in the tea kettle, tea kettle's Teflon coating was coming off, and there were two pillows per bed provided that were paper thin. In fact let my wife have both paper thin pillow on our bed and used a rolled up blanket as a pillow.

To my family we place an emphasis on attention to detail. I truly believe that finishes selected could have been nice had it not been for the poor craftsmanship at installation. The perception of a rushed renovation was amplified during our stay by, what we felt was, a unit that was l rushed during the cleaning process. Mind you a cleaning process that we pay $75 for.

Maybe Im overly critical OR maybe I just expect more when Im spending $250/night."
2586642,23570512,2014-12-05,22547447,Amanda,"This place was just perfect! I stayed there several weeks for a temporary living situation - it had everything I needed and was super cozy. They've spent a lot of time on the ambiance through finishes and décor, and it was clean and modern and cozy all at the same time. 

The location is great, right on Queen Anne with lots of restaurants and shops close by, Whole Foods just down the street, and just a few minutes to downtown and other great neighborhoods. 

Emily was a wonderful host, ensuring I was all settled in and leaving me to it. They even hung a holiday wreath on my door, which was a nice touch! I would definitely recommend this unit!"
2586642,24389873,2014-12-27,16118531,Alek,"Emily was not able to greet us when we checked in, but the instructions she provided were excellent and had every detail for us to check in and out without any questions.  It made my job easier as the organizer of our trip to not have to deal with too many questions.  We rented the basement floor which was decorated in a clean and modern style.  Everything was provided, including kitchen appliances and utensils.  All amenities we expected were there.  The wall heaters were very effective in keeping the place warm and cozy.  There was construction going on at the house next door, but they kept appropriate quiet hours at night and the machinery was barely noticeable during the day.  "
2586642,34600630,2015-06-09,35021302,Eric,"We really enjoyed our stay here! It was clean, and the check in/out process was simple. The unit had all the amenities necessary for our stay, and was centrally located with a car, but walking anywhere was not very convenient. We barely saw the owners, but when we did, they were friendly and welcoming.

Thanks!"
2586642,35565186,2015-06-20,28060623,Leah,"We had a lovely time. Home was clean, comfortable and in a centrally located area. Emily was helpful, provided some toys and extra bedding for our little ones. Would recommend this for others looking to stay in Seattle!"
2586642,35817167,2015-06-22,3839366,Karn,"My parents stayed at Emily's for 2 nights during our stay in Seattle and we could not have asked for a better vacation. Emily provided  us anything we needed to check-in. The unit was quaint and comfortable (the kitchen is super cute!!!) and there is a very nice patio area to sit and enjoy your coffee in the morning (there is a beautiful view of lake). The house is located in one of the cutest neighborhoods , which is very close to all the attractions in Seattle has to offer. It didn't take us longer than 10-15 minutes to get anywhere we wanted to go.

Overall they had such a great experience and I would highly recommend Emily  to anyone planning to visit Seattle!"
2586642,36319221,2015-06-27,32767001,Cara,Emily and Daniel were great hosts and made us feel very welcome. Their place had everything that we needed and was in an ideal location. Very close to downtown yet quiet and not too crowded. The apartment size was just right and included all of the amenities that made you feel like you were at home.
2586642,36746772,2015-06-30,2624195,Bryan,The place was perfect. Very clean and had everything one would want at a great price. Short uber ride to everywhere we went. Nothing was more than 10-15 mins away. 
2586642,38108524,2015-07-13,30878500,David,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Emily's. The 4 of us were quite comfortable sleeping in the 2 bedrooms, and the kitchen made it easy to have breakfast before heading out. The scones that were provided for us the first day were tasty! There were only 3 chairs for the 4 of us, but we brought in an extra one from the deck. Some evenings when we returned it was a little difficult to find parking on the street, but we never had to park more than a couple of blocks away. "
2586642,38663563,2015-07-17,4849243,Jamie,"I had a lovely stay. The neighborhood is near Interbay and the Ballard bridge. I was able to walk or Uber to where I needed to go, but would suggest a rental car if staying for an extended period of time. New homes were being built next door, but surprisingly had no effect on the noise level or waking me up in the mornings. 

Emily was a gracious host with quick responses and thoughtful details. Fresh flowers, scones and a list of things to do/see were left out on the counter. The internet connection was great and I enjoyed the patio every night during these long summer days. I stayed here while on a work trip so the apartment was perfect for a quite location to come back to, relax and work from. "
2586642,39306990,2015-07-22,36519567,Rilly,"yes, we enjoyed staying at Emily's. We felt welcome and the place was clean and well equiped."
2586642,39944228,2015-07-27,35090952,Audrey,"Amazing. Extremely lovely place. Modern, great design. Emily was fabulous, couldn't have asked for a better experience to visit seattle for the first time. She was even overly nice when we made the mistake of walking into the wrong part of the house (rental is to the right down the hill of the main entrance). Would recommend this place to anyone. "
2586642,40494989,2015-07-31,37439957,Derek,We enjoyed staying here.  It was very easy to get to downtown Seattle and all of the things to do there.  It was a nice place for us to stay during our visit and served my family's needs well.
2586642,41095161,2015-08-04,1342343,Troy,"Emily was a great host.  She was there when we arrived and extremely welcoming.  The space was great for us.  With a car the location was very convenient, the kitchen has everything we needed to cook and make coffee, and the beds were comfortable.  "
2586642,41625845,2015-08-08,36624125,Margery,"Emily and family were very accommodating. The neighborhood was very safe and the description of the apartment was spot on. I very much enjoyed my stay and they made me feel at home and comfortable.
Thank you!!"
2586642,42816815,2015-08-16,9131485,Yvette,"When we first arrived at Emily’s place, I was disappointed to find that it did not appear very clean. The sheets had crumb-type residue as well as small dog-like hairs on them and the pillows did not smell fresh, but rather as if they had been slept on. The carpet in one of the bedrooms seemed dirty; there was hair enough (blond and mine is brown) so that it gathered on my foot when I walked over it. The bathroom smelled like mildew with a slight urine odor, the towels reeked of mildew as if they had been left wet in a washer and then dried. None of the beds had a top sheet at all, only a bottom sheet and comforter, and I generally found this gross. The place had the appearance of not only a shabby cleaning job, but also a shabby construction job, which lent to the feeling of “yuck.” Lastly, they recycling bin had been left full under the sink and one of the odors revealed itself to be the old compost left in the bin long enough to grow mold and reek, this may have contributed to the flies that had taken up residence. I am a fan of composting as much as anyone, however—I don’t want to find it left in the bin for me to dump.

After sleeping on the disappointing arrival (I want to do things with a clear head) I wrote an email to Emily, and outlined what I had found. I had just finished and walked out the door (with my husband and 5-year-old) when Emily appeared outside, she was visibly upset (and obviously having an immediate emotional reaction given the timing) and she stated that “the floor had been cleaned with a toothbrush, the place was clean” and “So sorry it is not up to your standards” and I was “more than welcome to wash (myself) the sheets and towels if I felt they were not clean.” Clearly we were not going to agree on any other outcome. I was wrong in her eyes and that was that. 
Later, I contacted the Air bnb and sent them the pictures (I took after getting home that day) and they agreed that cleanliness was an issue and worked with me to resolve the matter. I could not change locations (Seattle in August is BUSY), which was what I would have liked to do. However, Air BnB was awesome and acted as an intermediary with Emily. They arranged for her to have the place cleaned, and that was a huge relief. We bought ourselves towels, 

 I wish that Emily had come to me and said, “I am so sorry you are uncomfortable, how can we resolve this?” I would have gladly worked with her. Instead her attitude and general lack of willingness to help left me without an alternative. In fact she NEVER spoke with us again, not to say she was sorry, not to ask if things had improved-nothing. 

"
2586642,43424455,2015-08-19,40483784,Mark,This was a very nice and cute little place.  It was obviously taken care of and was very clean.  Emily was responsive to a last minute phone call.  The location is not too far from downtown and within walking distance of the Queen Anne area (if you are in shape and don't mind hills).  No complaints at all.
1012003,4480325,2013-05-07,5896110,Nancy,"Larry is remarkably thoughtful and considerate, and my family greatly appreciated his kindness. The space was remarkably clean, and Capitol Hill is a beautiful neighborhood. "
1012003,4841540,2013-05-28,6197880,Kathy,"This was a wonderful stay, great location, fantastic hosts, and just the right size for two for an 8 day stay.  The rooms have adequate sunlight.  We loved being near Capital Hill and Eastlake.  Safe and walkable.  Larry and Suzi are fantastic hosts!
"
1012003,5464008,2013-07-01,5963104,Mellissa,"I enjoyed my time with Larry and Suzi! He picked us up from Westlake knowing that we were lost and couldnt find the bus stop to his place. What we booked was more then expected, we booked a ""mini"" home complete with a kitchen and living room! House was clean, and the location was great. Close to volunteer park and capitol hill. everyone gotta stay here if you're visiting Seattle!"
1012003,6618121,2013-08-19,2676923,Monica,We had a wonderful stay at Larry and Suzi's place-they were very friendly and helpful when we got in late the first night. The bed was comfortable and it was a very quiet room and quiet area of town. It's a great location; within walking distance of Capitol Hill. We really enjoyed our stay!
1012003,7878336,2013-10-07,8447801,Tristan,Larry and Suzi made for fantastic hosts and great people to get to know making my stay in Seattle one of my favourites. The granny flat under the house is spacious and has everything you could need in a visit. I would not hesitate to return!
1012003,15030569,2014-07-01,1658668,Patty,"We have fairly extensive experience with Airbnb, both as travelers and as hosts.  This experience was one of the very best we have ever had!  Larry made sure he communicated with us previous to our arriving and even offered to (and did!) pick us up from the end of the Light Rail.  He gave us a quick tour of the area and drove us past our daughter's house, so we could more easily find it.  Told us a bit about the bus system, where to pick it up, etc.  He also spent some time showing us his beautifully restored 1907 residence and 1973 Corvette and we shared a beer on his back deck.  Really lovely man and we look forward to staying there again on another trip to Seattle!  
The kitchen was really well stocked, the bed super comfy and the 50"" TV along with Netflix and Pandora made the stay even better!
Maybe next time we'll meet Suzi, too ;-)"
1012003,18877395,2014-09-02,1422414,Alexis,"Larry and Suzi were wonderful! I have stayed in several airbnb places around the world and they are by far the best hosts - they are very thoughtful, helpful and left detailed guides and instructions for us. Although we didn't get to meet in person, they went above and beyond to make sure we would have everything we needed and that we could contact them if anything came up. Their home was lovely as well - very comfortable and a perfect place to explore Seattle from."
1012003,34114095,2015-06-05,8114781,Katy,Beautiful apartment and the hosts are extremely welcoming and helpful.  Highly recommended.  Close to public transportation downtown.
1012003,34433294,2015-06-08,31694199,Sunghee,"It was a memorable experience at Larry & Suzi's.  Everything was neat and clean. The separate access from the host entrance really kept privacy. The host provided extra bus tickets (if used, needs to be replaced) and information about sightseeing, which was great especially for first time visitors. Definitely, I would love to go back Larry & Suzi's."
1012003,35000254,2015-06-14,23497269,Fiona,"This recent trip to Capitol Hill was my first experience with AirBnB, and it was wonderful to have Larry and Suzi as hosts! Larry was very helpful with navigating the city, and made the accommodation so comfortable and convenient for our stay. The rooms had everything you could need in a visit, with a full kitchen and living room. It was clean and quiet, and in a great location (close to a nearby coffee shop and access to the bus). We enjoyed our stay, and I would definitely return! Highly recommend!"
1012003,36059280,2015-06-24,2925841,Sally,"Larry and Suzi were very welcoming. When we arrived, they greeted us very warmly and showed us everything we needed to know, including information about Seattle and the neighbourhood. They also sent a nice, welcoming email ahead of time to my daughter and me."
1012003,44278105,2015-08-25,29390096,Julie,"After booking, Larry called me right away and offered suggestions as to how to best plan my trip and provide the local perspective.  He was also welcoming when I met him.  I loved the location of this house!  It was in a beautiful neighborhood and seemed close to everything.  Downtown and the highways were very accessible by car.  (We didn't try any mass transportation) I would highly recommend Larry and Suzi's house and would gladly stay there again."
7665392,41295451,2015-08-05,32907791,Michael,"A beautiful West Seattle jewel!  Clearly a work of love, as fine detail has been put into every facet of the apartment.  Furnished with care; toxic free paints, up-cycled materials, and Etsy/Homemade furniture this place is delightful and green.  Gabriela is a wonderful host, and extremely friendly.  I honestly can't name a place I'd rather stay in Seattle."
7665392,42062110,2015-08-10,885186,Lindsey,"Sublime!  I wish I lived here.  

Truly a beautiful and breathtaking modern flat, and one of the best Airbnb experiences we've had!  It is located in a lovely, quiet and very safe neighborhood, and parking was super easy.  The flat was so totally quiet, spacious and comfortable.

All of the fixtures and appliances were deluxe, top of the line and extraordinarily luxurious. The king-sized bed was so comfortable, with fine linens. We really felt spoiled! This is the style of flat that I would want to live in, if I could!

Gabriela was an absolute pleasure, so welcoming and warm, and I can't recommend her highly enough! We really appreciated that they welcomed us personally and helped us familiarize.

I would absolutely book here again without any hesitation, and I highly recommend that you do the same."
7665392,43297154,2015-08-18,21021421,Elijah,Gabriela and her family made us feel very welcome and were very attentive to our needs.  The place is in classic Seattle neighborhood and the apartment itself is superb.  We had a great time on our weekend there.  Hope to stay again!
7665392,43563700,2015-08-20,40959832,Katie,"Nice neighborhood. Unit was very clean and looked just like the photos. Private entrance and you don't have to share any spaces with the homeowners so it feels very private. No surprises. Quiet home, did not hear much from upper levels. Would stay here again. "
7665392,44193715,2015-08-24,24897082,Simone,"This apartment was bigger and more beautiful than I had expected from the pictures. Recently renovated it had great lighting and all new appliances. The apartment was very clean, spacious, comfortable and functional. Great quiet neighborhood. The only surprise was that this is a garden apartment. The owner lives upstairs and the apartment is completely independent. We loved staying there and would do so again. Our son lives a few blocks away, so we did not need tips on the area, which I am sure Gabriela would have provided if asked. "
7665392,45536759,2015-09-03,38618579,Dasi,"Host - Gabriela is a friendly and laid-back but attentive host. She provided a full tour of the place and was very flexible and accommodating of our travel schedule. She and her husband (and sweet dog) live above the apartment and were available if we needed it.

Accommodation - brand new separate entrance, private apartment located in the basement of a house. You walk down a short flight of stairs to the separate entrance. We only heard soft footsteps twice during our 4 night stay, so it is extremely quiet. Despite being in the basement, there is plenty of light so it didn't feel gloomy. All new appliances in the kitchenette, high-quality furniture, peaceful modern colors and style. Table and kitchenette are in the same room as the sofa/TV/fireplace. Down the hall is a bathroom and a bedroom. Floors have radiant heat, lights were all dimmable, everything was spotless. Kettle for heating water, fresh ground coffee, dishes, pots/pans/silverware were all provided. In the bathroom are an HE washer/dryer, large shower and two sinks. A hairdryer and plenty of nice hotel-quality towels were provided. Bed is king-sized and had a firm foam mattress, with great pillows. Wifi was high-speed and reliable. We never needed anything. Compared to other Airbnb's where you only get the bare minimum, this is a full featured place to stay! 

Neighborhood - this West Seattle ""Admiral Junction"" neighborhood has so much to offer. Fancy and regular grocery stores, excellent restaurants/bars, drugstore, library, close to Alki, etc. The house is located approx. 6 blocks from all of that, so you can enjoy the quiet  but still have all the amenities 5 min away. You are also 2 blocks from the bus (57 route) that takes you downtown, so if you wanted to skip the car, you could.

Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at La Casa Morada and will definitely return the next time we're in Seattle."
7665392,48732654,2015-09-28,20916465,Ron,"Great place to stay in West Seattle.  Completely remodeled, very tastefully, and super quiet with a very comfortable bed.  We've stayed at 6 West Seattle airbnb, and while we'd stay at any of them again, this was the best -- at least for us (2 people, didn't need to walk to ""junction."").  Like all W Seattle homes, there are steps..."
7665392,49289463,2015-10-02,16070322,Michal,"Gabriela's apartment is a delight.  It is very nicely appointed, tastefully decorated, and extremely comfortable.  There's plenty of kitchenware, which is great, and lots of coffee and tea (we enjoyed both).  The washing machine and dryer are top-of-the-line, very easy to use.  Bed is very comfortable, good quality linens too.  Overall, very, very nice! 5-stars on our chart, for sure."
7665392,50198330,2015-10-10,38618579,Dasi,"This was our second stay at La Casa Morada and it was a great experience again. I was impressed that some improvements had been made based on feedback I had provided in my first visit. This shows that Gabriela is intersted in making the space comfortable and she is an attentive host. If you're looking for a nicely appointed, quiet and private place to stay in West Seattle, you can't go wrong here. You can see more details about my thoughts on the space in my previous review. "
7665392,51503047,2015-10-20,16070322,Michal,This was our second stay with Gabriela. It was even better than the first - thanks for the extra pillows and chair!
7665392,52882205,2015-11-02,24897082,Simone,This was our second stay at La Casa Morada. We spend two weeks there and enjoyed the place even more than during our first visit. Halloween in the neighborhood was great and Gabriela was as attentive as ever. 
7665392,54104068,2015-11-16,24082245,Charles,"My parents loved staying at this very well equipped lower-level apartment.  They were especially impressed with the comfortable bed and large closet and they also reported that the shower with large enclosure worked very well.  During a rainy, cold spell in Seattle, the radiant floor heating made for a very cozy place to stay, with cheery lighting and comfortable furniture.  There is even a full-size washer/dryer.  I highly recommend this place and the location is excellent, within easy walking distance of the Admiral/California junction."
7007598,39969310,2015-07-27,17801309,Janelle,"Thank you so much Shadi for opening your home up to us. It was exactly what we were looking for! The house is beautiful with lots of places to sleep (gorgeous kitchen) and only a 10 minute drive to downtown where we always park for free behind the stadiums. Shadi, the host, was extremely helpful and answered all my many emails before and during our stay. I would love to come back next time we're in Seattle. 
Thanks again!
Janelle"
7007598,40772018,2015-08-02,27165733,Ryan,"Shadi's home was beautiful! The location was perfect and the price was right. This spacious house has been beautifully renovated, which made it a welcome rest stop between jaunts around the city. We even ended up staying in one night just to enjoy time around the house. Also, Georgetown is just down the street, a kitschy, fun neighborhood with plenty of awesome bars, breweries, and restaurants."
7007598,41782287,2015-08-09,36741400,Karen,"What a beautiful and spacious home! It was a treat to relax after a long day of sight-seeing. I wish my own house had such a nice kitchen and laundry room. We stayed here for a girls' weekend, and having three bathrooms for four women/girls was a nice feature when it came to getting ready each morning.

There was continual airplane traffic overhead, but that's probably common most anywhere in the Seattle area. I kind of enjoyed watching them, but if you're sensitive to noise it might be an issue. 

I especially loved sitting out in the back yard with a cup of coffee. Ahhh! Perfect! "
7007598,45967045,2015-09-07,13267339,Tony,Our stay at Shadi's home was a great experience. She was a very accommodating host dealing with plan changes and early check ins. The house was very clean and having the 3 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms was great. Uber is definitely a must have if staying here as there isn't much in walking distance. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone who is planning a trip to Seattle. 
7007598,57585191,2015-12-27,1946500,Manoj,"Shadi was wonderful.  She was very prompt in getting information to us in a timely manner in advance of our reservation.  Christmas in Portland caused our trip to be delayed by several hours so we weren't able to check in until around 9pm on Christmas day.  The house was clean and charming and well represented by the pictures we found on Airbnb.  We hadn't fully thought things out regarding food and found ourselves at the house on Christmas in the evening without any food.  We found some food in the fridge and made quesadillas from some tortillas and cheese we found in there.  I emailed Shadhi about this and she was very warm, supportive and understanding in her response.  The only minor problem that we encountered was that the TV and the internet weren't working.  I emailed Shadi about the issue and I got a prompt email back and followup call from her husband, Matt.  I ended up being able to figure out that a breaker had been tripped that had shut off all the wall outlets in the basement and hence knocked out both the internet and the tv.  Overall we had a nice experience at the house.  We were gone a lot of the time so we really only got to enjoy it in the evenings right before bed time.  But I would recommend it to anyone looking for a great rental."
2763078,11980817,2014-04-20,9553883,Margaret,"The mother in-law-apartment was very quiet and private. The location is great with easy walking to the market and shops and restaurants. The bed was comfy and warm and the room has big, bright windows that make it a nice space to work in. A very nice place to stay! "
2763078,12028617,2014-04-21,14159828,Sarah,"This was our first time using airbnb. 
Freddie was so great from the first message to meeting her in person. 
The Mother-In-Law apartment was great. We loved having our own entrance and being able to come and go as we liked. The apartment was stocked with everything we would need for the stay, towels, bath and body supplies, cups, tea, pots and pans. 
We highly recommend the mother-in-law apartment and renting with Freddie. "
2763078,12264467,2014-04-27,13930053,Ha,The apartment was definitely nicer than the picture indicated. Our host was very nice and the space provided a lot of privacy. Excellent brunch location nearby and close to the airport.
2763078,12319895,2014-04-28,3249208,Yifat,"Freddie and John's mother in law unit was lovely. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable, and had everything we needed. Freddie and John were very nice and helpful, and my boyfriend and I appreciated their flexibility around check in an check out time, it gave us a chance to make the most out of our stay. The Columbia City neighborhood is beautiful, quiet, and relaxing. We definitely recommend this spot and would stay here again if the opportunity came up. "
2763078,12519739,2014-05-04,14012928,Trista,"Freddie is a great host. The space was clean and comfortable. The bed, which is always important to me for a good night's sleep, was comfortable. It is a private space, which is appreciated when traveling. 
Freddie was very accommodating when I needed something for the kitchen, which was also greatly appreciated. 
They were exceptionally quiet upstairs in the mornings, which is also worth its weight in gold. 
Overall, a nice place to stay with lovely hosts."
2763078,12762159,2014-05-10,2542378,J.R.,"Great space, nice and private, with a  good view of urban greenery out the windows. Super close to the shops on S. Rainier (Columbia City), so dining and morning coffee was just a five-minute walk away. Would definitely stay there again."
2763078,12939975,2014-05-14,11934835,Natasha,We had a really nice one night stay at Freddie's place. The room was a good size and clean. The kitchenette was convenient and the bathroom was also nice. Great neighborhood and Freddie was really helpful with our last minute booking. Didn't get to chat much as we were only there for one night but had a very pleasant experience so thank you!
2763078,13014803,2014-05-17,15025683,Cam,"The private mother-in-law apartment is a great place to stay when visiting Seattle. Columbia City is a lovely Seattle neighborhood that most tourists miss out on experiencing. The apartment is within walking distance to the light rail and  bus lines to downtown, Seward Park and Lake Washington, restaurant/bars and brewery, and a grocery co-op and weekly farmers' market. Freddie and John provided us with every we needed during our stay, including valuable advice for tourists, and shared a bit of easy conversation when our paths crossed.  The only shortcoming of the apartment during our stay was the unreliable and slow wifi connection. Great Price! Highly Recommended!"
2763078,13096848,2014-05-19,5053141,Ellis,"We stayed over a weekend.  The bed was comfortable and 
everything was neat and clean, including the kitchen  
and bathroom areas.  Freddie and John were gracious and
accommodating hosts.  We would definitely stay there again."
2763078,13835902,2014-06-05,16140533,Michael,Great stay! Very quiet neighborhood. Freddie was very good at keeping in touch and leaving instructions for my stay. Thanks!
2763078,13865491,2014-06-06,16136261,Jonathan,"Freddie was very helpful and friendly. The room was clean, tidy and comfortable, and in a lovely area that is both nice to walk around in, and in close proximity to transport in to town. I would stay here again gladly."
2763078,13886602,2014-06-07,15442956,Ruisi,"Very comfortable and clean room with a little yard. We also appreciate the privacy here, thank you so much and we will stay again if we go to Seattle next time."
2763078,14155224,2014-06-13,15194596,Ti'Esh,I had an amazing stay this past week at Freddie's home. The mother-in-law was extremely clean and comfortable. Freddie was flexible with check in which was extremely helpful for our schedule. The Columbia City neighborhood is awesome! My boyfriend was able to walk just a few blocks down the street and eat lunch and hang out while I was at work. We went to the Farmer's Market on Wednesday and explored some great shops that week as well! 
2763078,14288530,2014-06-16,15284735,Jk,We were in town for UW's graduation and our local family had an overflow of guests.  This was a great place for our busy schedule since it is convenient to get to the U and just a few blocks from Columbia City and all it has to offer. Im sure that there will be others from our family and friends staying with Freddie and John.
2763078,14407802,2014-06-18,16073663,Bellen,"It was clean, comfortable, quiet, convenient, in a nice neighborhood walking distance to restaurants and shops, a good price, and I will use it again if the occasion arises."
2763078,14478063,2014-06-20,6926830,Megan,"The room was wonderful!  Clean, bright, comfortable room, comfortable bed.  The location was good, as long as you have a car (it is Seattle, so it is hilly).  Unfortunately I wasn't able to meet Freddie and John, but my friend and I had a wonderful stay in their guest room.  I really appreciated the separate entry because my friend and I kept coming back late at night, so we did not need to bother anyone upon our return."
2763078,14750117,2014-06-25,467020,Henry,"Lovely, quiet and peaceful neighborhood. Very safe area. Hosts were friendly and helpful. Very nice, clean, modern apartment with separate entrance. Comfortable bed. Restful, green back yard view through large windows. Convenient to great little downtown Columbia City, which was more like a little village. Great value! Would love to stay here again.

2763078,14842684,2014-06-27,16017420,Robert,"The room is nicer than it looks in the photos. I would happily stay here over and over again when I am in the Columbia City area. And if you do not know Columbia City, you may want to check it out.  It is a charming neighborhood that is easy to get to and from downtown Seattle, and easily accessible from light rail.  It is about a 10 minutes walk to Columbia City, and a five minute walk to a coffee shop and a grocery store.  There are a few zip cars in downtown Columbia City too. Communication was easy from start to finish.  Freddie is a delight.  I highly recommend staying at Freddie's place."
2763078,14927615,2014-06-29,7290458,Angela,"Great location, easy to find, clean and comfortable, cozy little suite with private entrance, looks exactly like the pictures. Freddie was very friendly, they were hosting a bonfire that night, did not hear anything at all. Did not get a chance to talk to John but they seem like a lovely couple with a lovely young family. 

Check in and check out was very simple. Didn't know what to expect as we are first time users of Airbnb. Will definitely stay again if were in the area. 
"
2763078,15015368,2014-06-30,14254515,Heather,"The suite was private with a small patio with a great view. Bathroom clearly recently renovated and very clean! Freddie had everything ready so we could check in early. 

We didn't stay long, but this seemed like a great place to us. "
2763078,15368133,2014-07-07,12512676,Malia,Our stay was perfect! Freddie was very accommodating and upfront with pertinent information regarding our stay. It was easy and ideally located. We will likely stay here again if we take another trip to Seattle. Much nicer than staying at a hotel!
2763078,15593404,2014-07-12,7682781,Stacie,"This place was great! Had everything we needed and lots of space. Freddie was easy to get in touch with and quick to respond. The neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance to coffee shops, places to eat and public transit. This place has all the little things necessary for a very comfortable stay.  I would definitely recommend a stay here!"
2763078,15642373,2014-07-13,3521398,Natalie,"Clean and private little suite! Everything is here to make you feel like home. We only stayed for one night, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place. "
2763078,15816930,2014-07-16,11395903,Tracey,"The apartment is under the main house with its own entrance which is good for privacy. The neighborhood is very quiet and safe. Very easy to find parking, we always find parking right in front of the house. The room itself is clean and neat. We enjoyed our stay very much. "

2763078,16047110,2014-07-20,7483366,J.,"Clear communication, nice neighborhood, friendly couple -- nothing more to ask.  Enjoyed my stay there albeit only one night. "
2763078,16067155,2014-07-21,14954975,Silke,"The apartment was easy to find, calm,nice and clean. The bed was comfortable. The apartment has an own entrance so that you can come and go as you like.
It was easy to find parking directly in front of the house.
We met Freddie only when we arrived and left, but she was very friendly.
We only stayed for one night but we really would recommend this appartment."
2763078,16148469,2014-07-22,2082840,Julie,Freddie's place was great!  We only stayed there for one night and didn't get a chance to meet Freddie because of our busy schedule but the room was even better than we could've hoped.  Freddie was very helpful with leaving a key for us to let ourselves in when we arrived.  I will definitely stay there again if I'm in Seattle!  Thanks Freddie!
2763078,16404830,2014-07-27,15934022,Shannon,"We had a great stay in Seattle! Freddie and John were great hosts! Like the description says, this mother-in-law apartment is very private. It is on the ground level of their house and has a separate entrance in the back. Once you are in the apartment, you have your own bathroom and kitchen area. Their neighborhood is very nice and everyone seemed very friendly. They are only a 15 minute walk from Columbia City, where there are several dining options/cafes/bars. The light-rail station is just another 5 minute walk from there."
2763078,16495735,2014-07-28,17791465,Jesse,"Great place, very accommodating!"
2763078,16622197,2014-07-30,2609051,Ashley,"Freddie made us feel very welcome and even came to check on us to make sure everything was going well and that we were comfortable during our stay. We had a very comfortable stay in the mother-in-law apartment and would definitely stay again. Thanks, Freddie!"
2763078,17118702,2014-08-07,18486580,Emi,"It was such a clean, quiet, and nice room to stay for 3 days. Accommodation was adequate. I loved the fact we had a separate kitchen (but no microwave) and a bathroom.  Will definitely recommend to friends and will come back again! Thank you, Freddie, for letting us stay at your place.  "
2763078,17218865,2014-08-09,5592821,Monika,We've just stayed for 2 nights on weekdays so we didn't really get the chance to talk to our hosts. We found everything okay. The appartment was clean. The neighbourhood was really nice and quiet. To park was not a problem at the appartment. Downtown is close by car. The public transport is good as well. 
2763078,17642361,2014-08-15,6578267,Peter,"sehr gut gelegen für einen Besuch  von Seattle. Mit öffentliche Verkehrsmittel gut erreichbar. Sauberes Zimmer, Kitchenette etc , alles prima in Ordnung.
Gute Gastgeber, empfehlenswert!"
2763078,17728289,2014-08-16,906830,Bridget,"The space did just the trick for a short overnight stay in Seattle. The room was set back and allowed for a very peaceful night of sleep, yet the neighborhood was vibrant and conveniently located. Freddie was a great communicator and had things tidy and ready for us to drop in with no problem at all."
2763078,17841049,2014-08-18,3086508,Vladimir,"Everything was perfect, the room and location are great. Freddie made sure we felt comfortable and at home. Thank you!"
2763078,18007732,2014-08-20,15287607,Hieu,"We were able to check-in whenever we wanted because Freddie left a key outside the entrance to the mother-in-law suite. She did greet us briefly. There was a welcome sheet and instructions in the suite. There was wireless internet, but the signal was very weak. Towels were limited. Space was as described, private, quiet, and clean. Street parking was plentiful. There was debris in the driveway because they were working on the yard. We would definitely stay again."
2763078,18342612,2014-08-25,16505697,Rachel,"We had a very sweet experience at Freddie's place. The back patio was magical in the morning, and I appreciated the express kettle and range for making breakfast. Wonderful shower and towels, nice bed, and very sweet family."
2763078,18948331,2014-09-03,18230000,Jeannie,"Clean and private little suite, nice neighborhood and short drive to downtown.  We only stayed for one night, but wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place.  "
2763078,19062556,2014-09-05,20649303,Juan,"Awesome bed, very clean, private and quiet. Perfect place to rest and very close to downtown. We loved it!"
2763078,19207415,2014-09-08,19202635,Debbie,"We enjoyed our stay in the Private Mother-in-law apartment.  It was clean and the bed was comfortable.  My son lives in this neighborhood, so it was a convenient location for us.  In addition, it's only about 15 minutes from downtown Seattle.  "
2763078,19478394,2014-09-13,2521375,Annie,"We had received a very warm welcome, Freddie was even kind enough to let us check in a bit early to accommodate our daughter's nap schedule! The space was very comfortable and private, true to the description!"
2763078,19737482,2014-09-17,706611,Elizabeth,I loved the little rustic cottage with private entrance. The place was exactly as described in the listing. We did not intersect with the owner as we had different plans and were coming back late.
2763078,19863752,2014-09-19,244900,Katerina,The reservation was canceled 39 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2763078,19896387,2014-09-20,20821020,Natalie,"Freddie's room was the perfect place to rest. We had just flown into the city and appreciated the comfortable, clean, and private room that was just a few minutes away from the airport. The room would be great for a longer stay as well... Kitchen, dishwasher, full bathroom. It is a 2 minute walk to downtown Columbia City which has awesome little shops and super yummy food. Parking is simple and our whole experience was stress-free thanks to Freddie's space! "
2763078,20024089,2014-09-22,3807021,Kim,The apartment was clean and comfortable and had all the basic supplies we needed for the weekend.   It was a perfect home base while we explored Seattle!
2763078,20296943,2014-09-27,13120075,Alan And Michelle,"Our interaction with Freddie was online.  We found him to be responsive to us and very helpful in arranging to check-in and check-out.

This apartment met our needs: comfortable bed; clean bathroom and shower; kitchen area with range and refrigerator; private entrance; quiet environment; and accessible to Columbia City shops and light rail.

A nice touch was a map of Washington State that covered an entire wall.  

We look forward to returning to Freddie's apartment on future visits with our son's family in Columbia City."
2763078,20923843,2014-10-07,21630672,Jeff,"Freddie made us feel very welcome, when we had a request it was granted promptly. very quiet neighborhood, a few blocks away from the organic grocery and Lake Washington."
2763078,21268355,2014-10-13,22331475,Bluesette,We had a fantastic stay.  The room was cozy and very inviting.  The kitchen was well stocked which was lovely.  I must say though that the shower was my favorite part of our stay.
2763078,21654326,2014-10-21,1442600,Alicia,"Staying with Freddie and John was wonderful!  It was incredibly easy and they made us feel at home.  We would definitely stay here again if back in the Seattle area.  Everything was clean, plenty of space, and had great amenities.  Great experience!"
2763078,22029281,2014-10-28,21823496,J,"Great place in a beautiful neighborhood. Walk to downtown Columbia City to enjoy coffee, restaurants, rail to downtown and more.  
The hosts are great, the cottage is nice, clean and private, and it's perfect for 1 or 2 people.  I'd recommend staying there.
"
2763078,22665575,2014-11-11,5913054,Donn,"This place was a perfect hide away.  It was peaceful and relaxing.  Great neighborhood,  Freddie had everything ready for me - it was easy to find and access, a comfortable oasis from a busy visit to Seattle.  THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!"
2763078,24992245,2015-01-04,311521,Bev,"The MIL suite is very cozy, quiet, and minimally furnished, which means it has just about everything you need.   The bed is super comfy, which means you get a great night's sleep.   There was one of  me and the space would certainly accommodate two very comfortably.   I did not meet the hosts, and they were available and accessible via phone and texts.  "
2763078,25178221,2015-01-08,24989827,Karina,"We had an amazing stay. Everything was clean, easy to figure out the heater and kitchen appliances. It was cozy and we immediately felt at home. Really recommend this place!"
2763078,25218679,2015-01-09,17639945,Sarah,"The room was nice but for this price, I have stayed in much better places.  There was no coffee in the room that I could find, I had trouble accessing the internet, the shower faucet was difficult to use, and I came across both a very large spider and some ants in the room in a single night.  The hosts were really generous and helpful, very kind and welcoming despite these complaints."
2763078,25361925,2015-01-13,23674158,Gary,Great location and great accommodation.   I was in Seattle for a three day program and Freddie's place was 12 minutes from my meeting place.  
2763078,26066691,2015-02-02,1552491,Elizabeth,"Freddie was very welcoming and available to answer questions or replace basic supplies as needed.  We found the unit perfect for our needs and an excellent value.  The neighborhood is appealingly hilly, convenient, and quiet.  The only drawback for us was the somewhat finicky shower, as others have noted, but still it was usable and did not pose a major problem.  Hopefully this is easily fixable."
2763078,26781427,2015-02-19,25157795,Wendy,"We enjoyed our stay, the apartment was simple, clean, private and relaxing. Freddie checked in with us once during our stay and was readily available when we had a question. Great location and neighborhood."
2763078,27593903,2015-03-08,24383578,Bob,"It was a darling place to stay, and was as described.  Our host was out of town, but we were sent specific instructions on how to get in, and to make ourselves at home.  the bed was comfortable and we really enjoyed our visit.  Would definitely stay again if we were to travel to Seattle"
2763078,28084976,2015-03-17,13120075,Alan And Michelle,"This was our second stay with Freddie.  Her apartment is very comfortable and we enjoy having our own private entrance.  This Airbnb setting has a large bedroom/sitting area, a kitchenette, and private bath.  We like having the small refrigerator in which to keep snacks and drinks.
Freddie was engaged in yard work and landscaping while we were visiting.  We felt like this is becoming our home away from home and love the quiet neighborhood.  We often returned late in the evening and found the local streets well-lit.  Freddie's yard had motion-detector lights that eased our nighttime access.                 "
2763078,28144275,2015-03-18,28922400,Gayle,"Lovely apartment, really comfortable and well maintained!  Unfortunately we had only 1 night to enjoy it - would of loved to stay longer and make use of the facilities more.  Loved the decoration of the rooms.  We also loved that it was a short walk from the rail station which took about 15 mins to the city."
2763078,28350882,2015-03-22,25883682,Erin,"We had a lovely time at Freddie's place.  It could easily be listed as an 'entire place' option for the privacy and autonomy it affords.  Very clean and cozy, and it is definitely walkable to some great Columbia City spots. The shower requires a gentle touch, as explained by Freddie, but is still good and hot.  Thank you again!"
2763078,28600516,2015-03-27,26431054,Brian,"The host made us feel very welcome, helping us hook up to the WiFi. The space very comfortable, excellent for two people travelling together who do not want to sleep together or a couple with a child. The neighbourhood is very quiet, with a good bakery, butchery, and restaurants close by. The light rail station to downtown Seattle or to the airport is about a twenty minute walk away. The bus stop to downtown is about ten minutes away."
2763078,31694423,2015-05-09,26877391,Susie,Freddie was a great host! She made sure that I had everything I needed and was always available if I has a question. The apartment is very private and was the perfect size for my son and I. It is in such a nice neighborhood and not a long walk from Seward Park.
2763078,31993096,2015-05-12,13836859,Jesse,"Great little suite that perfectly suited my needs. Comfortable, quiet and well-equipped. Great cafe and restaurants within walking distance  along with a natural foods grocery store. The hosts were very accommodating and were willing to help with any additional requests. I'd definitely return to this place. "
2763078,32187442,2015-05-15,23742904,Cara,"We unfortunately did not have the opportunity to meet our hosts, but everything was exactly as described and just great! Our flight was delayed, so we got in quite late (hopefully we weren't too noisy). We had great instructions on how to get in and how everything in the place worked. The bed was comfortable and the shower was hot. "
2763078,32676926,2015-05-20,4421888,Margaret,"Freddie's apartment is a wonderful place to stay. It was very clean with nice lighting and privacy. The windows overlook the back yard. The neighborhood is quiet, but one can easily walk to the lake and park or to restaurants and coffee shops. Although I didn't cross paths with Freddie more than once, I was able to find everything I needed and she would have been available if I had needed her. I had read some comments about problems with the shower, but it worked fine for me. It was a very comfortable place to stay and very reasonably priced."
2763078,33786100,2015-06-01,28933776,Michelle,Freddie made us feel very welcome and at home. The space is very private and cozy. We enjoyed our stay.
2763078,33991967,2015-06-03,11077274,Judy,"Freddie made us feel quite welcome and the cottage was quite clean.  The house is extremely well-  appointed and our family who visited loved the HUGE map of  the Pacific Northwest  on the wall.   We loved having a little patio and  used it right away,  given the great weather Seattle was having.
I did miss having a toaster  and a microwave,
though we made do by using the oven.  The air cleaner was a wonderful touch   and the apartment felt clean and fresh.  Would definitely stay there again."
2763078,34433204,2015-06-08,11738773,Andrew,This host provides the amenities of a five-star resort accommodation and then some. It's the little things like tea and coffee and a fully functioning kitchen that makes this the airbnb gem of Seattle. One of the nicest touches was the information card showing where to go and what to do on the weekend plus places where you can eat and buy food. Truly an excellent experience.
2763078,34736637,2015-06-11,34489697,David,"Freddie was really nice, she provided amenities like towels, tea, coffee, etc. The place itself was also very clean, so that was a major plus for us. The only downfall was hearing the kid running around upstairs at 7-8am, but thankfully we were already waking up by then. Other then that we loved the place."
2763078,35069735,2015-06-15,7362915,Toni,We enjoyed our stay. It was small but clean and had everything we needed. Would come again. Thanks so much!
2763078,35411906,2015-06-18,34605937,Patricia,"This was a great first time airbnb experience. The private apartment was exactly as described. Freddie left us a note to tell us the bathroom light went out earlier in the day, which was nice & very considerate. It was very clean, easy to access, and comfortable. I would recommend staying here. Great neighborhood, felt very safe. "
2763078,36260049,2015-06-27,12531222,Judith,"Ein freundliches Gastgeberpaar, nette und gemütliche Unterkunft wie beschrieben in einem sehr schönen Stadtteil von Seattle."
2763078,36768606,2015-07-01,30714250,Roland,"The place was great! It had everything we needed and the little mini fridge was a savior! We wanted to cook some of the great produce we came across in the neat little kitchen but didn't have the time. The giant Washington map was really interesting too. Also, Freddie came down to say hi and make sure we were set with everything, which was nice. She even invited us to their neighborhood movie screening on the deck. The instructional sheet made it easy and simple to understand how everything worked. The place is actually not very far from downtown Seattle, which was a very pleasant surprise, as google maps made it seem further. Just about a 15-20 minute drive. Highly recommended and a great deal. "
2763078,37107721,2015-07-04,1028825,Michael,"We had a lovely time at Freddie's place. Great location. Cute little apt. Love the MAP wall and the hills of the area. The suite was clean and quaint. Definitely stay again. 
Thank you! "
2763078,37241212,2015-07-05,20450657,Maschell,"Freddie was a very friendly host. As some of the other reviews have mentioned, it can get a little loud upstairs with footsteps sometimes. However, the place was clean and we had a good night's rest. Despite it being summer and there was no air conditioning unit, the room was quite cool even with the window shut all night. There was a large fan in the room which helped with that too. Quiet and clean looking neighborhood. Cold water bottles for us in the fridge was awesome! "
2763078,37303995,2015-07-06,30809187,Keith,This was a nice little place in a pretty quiet area. Everything was there ready for us and our stay was very pleasant. The host was nice as well. Really enjoyed staying here!
2763078,37642003,2015-07-09,29597710,Anna,"The host was not home when we came, however, everything was set up for our arrival. We felt the host's presence even though he was not on site. The setting was warm and welcoming.
Everything that was needed for our stay was there, all the instructions written clearly. The house was very clean and pleasant to be in. The area is quiet, with many old houses, beautiful flowers, close to public transportation and easy access to downtown. If I plan another trip to Seattle, I will certainly ask Freddie for hosting me."
2763078,37978468,2015-07-12,33619777,Whitney,"The location was good even though it was a bit far from the downtown area. You could take transit in pretty easily and get there in about 45 minutes. The room was comfortable enough although the bedding was a bit to be desired as the sheets were a jersey material and there was no cover for the duvet. Also, if you don't like spiders, steer clear of this place. We saw at least 10 big spiders in the room and the ceiling was crawling with little spiders. The place was near a busy street (Ranier Ave.) that had lots of food options which was great. Overall, I'd say we had a mediocre experience and probably wouldn't stay here again."
2763078,38499261,2015-07-16,33393801,Britten,Clean quite place.
2763078,38744836,2015-07-18,25478371,Erin,This was a great accommodation and location! Freddie had everything nicely prepared and included helpful written info about the place and the area.
2763078,39041294,2015-07-20,35979068,Cindy,"Very nice place to stay - comfortable, well equipped.  Everything we needed + more.
Lovely area - great local bakery.
The only problem was how far it is to downtown Seattle.  I'd understood it was only about 20 min by bus but it's much more than that.  Easily an hour by bus.

"
2763078,39231265,2015-07-21,16929275,David,"The host was awesome and made us feel welcome.  He let us check in late, and the house was all ready.

Clean and comfortable, I would recommend this to anyone!  it is in a great location as well."
2763078,39515857,2015-07-24,5088678,Alina,"What a treat was it to stay at Freddie's home.  Thank you for making our Seattle trip a gem.  Clean, quite, at home feel, kind host, all amenities, easy access to downtown.  Cannot compare to a traditional hotel.   
Thank you Freddie for your efforts and for trusting us enough to open your home for our stay.  My dad left you some buckwheat grain for your daughter to try.  If she likes it, we'll send you more from a local Russian store.
Wishing you all the best,
Alina."
2763078,40560644,2015-08-01,28778596,John,"All as expected; safe, quiet and pleasant. All amenities included. The leafy neighbourhood was a total contrast to CBD hotels. Morning walk to cafe or excellent bakery, a highlight. We rented a car to get around, easy to find and easy to get out of, and close to the City, say 10-15 minutes drive. Recommended."
2763078,40782139,2015-08-02,23748355,Richard,Charming private apt in a great location. Everything was fantastic!
2763078,41928506,2015-08-10,30929634,Paul,Lovely place very private as described  .easy to get around...love Seattle 
2763078,43488310,2015-08-20,609937,Emily,"Nice little place.  Everything fine: shower, bed, electric kettle (I brought my own tea) and a tiny fridge."
2763078,44314080,2015-08-25,38119737,Jill,"     Freddie was out of town when we arrived, but we had communicated beforehand via text & email, and she had a local friend make sure that the apartment was ready for us. 
     We were attending a conference in town and wanted a shipment of books to arrive before we did. Freddie generously worked out logistics with us, and the shipment was safely waiting for us when we arrived. 
     The living space was charming and as described. We enjoyed eating at a couple of local spots that Freddie recommended."

2763078,48271327,2015-09-25,35264046,Stefan,We stayed about two weeks in this place. The apartement ist located in a very calm and beautiful neighbourhood. Public transport to Seattle downtown ist close (approximatly 10 min walk). The communication with Freddie was always good and questions were answered quickly. The apartement itself made our stay really comfortable and enjoyable. It is well decorated and equipped with important kitchen and bath tools.We enjoyed our stay and would definitly stay again.
2763078,49880539,2015-10-07,28692239,Katharina,"We stayed at Freddie's nice place for 3 nights and absolutely loved it! The bed-/livingroom was very tidy,the bed so comfortable that it was hard to get up early to explore the city. We found everything we needed in the kitchen in order to prepare breakfast and even dinner(dishes and cuttelery). This place's interieur seemed to us like a little cute british cottage, which was extraordinary in the centre of a big American City. We felt warmly welcomed and recommend Freddie's ""little cottage"" to everyone visiting Seattle and looking for a quiet and comfortable place with much privacy. Thank you Freddie!"
2763078,52138601,2015-10-26,2190408,Lesley,"I found these hosts to be quite responsive, considerate, and accommodating. The space was as described -- the platform bed is quite firm. Information is clearly presented. The neighborhood was perfectly situated for my Columbia City visit!"
2763078,53883106,2015-11-14,32011305,Melvyn,Freddie gave great instructions for arrival and finding the key (we arrived in the dark and had no problems). The space was clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable! I really liked that there was kitchen space - we didn't end up making anything but it was nice to have the option to cook and stay in if we wanted to! This was a good first AirBnB experience!

Plenty of bus lines to wherever we needed to go in Fremont or Downtown. We even walked to some of our favorite restaurants and to the locks."
3884851,21724191,2014-10-22,21511585,Mike,Great host who knows the area. It is a great location that is very close to bud stops. Very nice and comfortable bed. 
3884851,21899351,2014-10-26,21061918,Avery,"Cindy is awesome. Great communication right from the start. She was very welcoming and willing to give advice and info on things to do and see. We got to hear a little bit about her travels and experience abroad, very interesting.

The apartment was nice and clean. The bed was very comfy and had notably nice sheets on it. We had everything we needed.

The Ballard area is great. We really enjoyed staying in the neighborhood. Grocery stores, tons of restaurants and a few touristy things nearby to check out.

Overall, great stay. We would highly recommend it and would definitely stay again.

"
3884851,22201801,2014-11-01,22116021,Tom,"This is a wonderful place to stay, close to downtown Ballard, grocery stores and restaurants.  Cindy is a gracious host very helpful and knowledgeable.  The room is comfortable and quite with its own heat control. Both the room and shared living area are very clean. I definitely would stay again when in the Seattle area."
3884851,22454751,2014-11-07,20645779,Jake,"Cindy was very welcoming and accommodating. Cindy made me feel very welcome and comfortable staying at her place. It is a short walk from public transit, and was very convenient for my La Marzocco training in Ballard."

3884851,22879001,2014-11-16,20702472,Heather,"Cindy was very kind and made us feel welcome in her home. Accurate description of the room, which was simple, nice, and clean. This is a great location; the Ballard neighborhood was hip and had lots to offer within walking distance as far as shows, food, and fun little shops. We enjoyed our walk to the locks and found the bus system into downtown Seattle to be very easy. "
3884851,22960518,2014-11-18,22116021,Tom,"Again Cindy was a great host, fire in the fireplace, warm house and good company.  It’s my go to place in Seattle"

Most nights a nice crackling fire going, and good conversation.  If I wasn't in the mood for all that, I was left to my own devices.  Cindy is very in tune to the area, and if she doesn't have current information about a business or restaurant, she won't hesitate to research it on the internet, or ask friends or family.  Very convenient location.  Everything is within walking distance, or a close bus route if you don't have a rental car."
3884851,26117813,2015-02-03,8172217,Daniel,"Cindy is very accommodating, Room is clean and so is the apt, nice friendly cat too."

The listing is located within walking distance of multiple shops, restaurants, and nightlife. We were able to comfortably walk to 6 different breweries from her doorstep. I highly recommend this place. "
3884851,27883233,2015-03-14,27661403,Betty,"This was a great first experience with Airbnb! 
Cindy was great and her listing was accurately presented, so was absolutely perfect! The room was comfortable and clean and looked just like the picture. The bathroom was also clean and comfortable.
The listing was within walking distance to the Ballard shops, as well as close to two large grocery stores and many restaurants, both chain and unique. Perfect for my travel plans. I appreciated having a kitchen (I just needed the refrigerator really) available for a few items I bought at the store, such as cream for my coffee, yogurt, etc.
I was able to come and go as my own schedule dictated. And a few times, we had a chance to chat, which is a wonderful thing to do when traveling.
I also had a great time with the neighborhood cat, who seems to have adopted Cindy as her human!
This experience has been very positive. I hope future Airbnb adventures will live up to this one!"
3884851,28503967,2015-03-24,15422524,Liane,"We enjoyed the time with Cindy very much. Thanks for that :).
She is a very warm and welcoming person and we had a few beers together.

3884851,29313805,2015-04-06,29230631,Laarni,She let us have our privacy and space. Our experience was better than staying at an expensive hotel. She was very helpful with information on public transportation and rental cars.
3884851,30635214,2015-04-25,30982576,Ada,"It was a short and pleasant stay. Cindy was nice. The room was the larger one in her apt., clean and enough space for my two large suitcases. I needed a room in Ballard, Seattle. Her place is conveniently located in a safe neighborhood, close to Market st., a large Safeway supermarket (3 mins walking), and plenty of restaurants. I really enjoyed our chat. She offered me simple breakfast and a ride to my meet up point, first thing in the morning on a Sat. I really appreciated it! "
3884851,30801861,2015-04-27,23148040,Teresia,"Cindy is a great and friendly host. The room looks exactly as in the picture, clean and neat. It is a cozy room in a great neighbourhood.

3884851,31251498,2015-05-03,31857281,Angela,"I stayed with Cindy to take a weekend course at the Swedish hospital. It was about a 10-15 min walking distance and I never needed to drive since great shops and food are very close by. It was quiet, I felt safe and the whole experience was very easy! I highly recommend staying here since 3 nights  with Cindy was cheaper then one night in downtown."
3884851,31554574,2015-05-06,21147122,Carl,Our stay with Cindy was great. We will be moving out to Seattle in the fall and Ballard was at the top of our list as far as potential neighborhoods to live: the location was perfect for exploring and getting a sense of the neighborhood. Cindy was helpful in our exploration of the city (thanks for the maps!) and was very accommodating. The sleep number bed was definitely a highlight: we slept like rocks. We very much enjoyed chatting with Cindy and were overall very happy with the experience. We left excited to move out in the fall! Also noteworthy: parking was incredibly easy. 
3884851,32836304,2015-05-22,31973558,Peter,"It's like staying with an auntie you have never met. The apartment is basic but clean.  It's not the lap of luxury, but it fit my needs perfectly and would stay there again. "
3884851,33122168,2015-05-25,2104669,Enrique,"It was just great! Cindy is awesome! She´s very chill and helpful! It was our first time in Seattle and she left us some flayers-info on the desk to lookout during our stay. She also gave us several tips and places to go to. Besides that, she was very nice to us from the moment of arrival ´till we left. I really didn´t want to go, she´s the kind of person who you would like to continue talking to. Also, the bed is delightful!!! "
3884851,33805379,2015-06-01,25176350,Sumuk,"Cindy was an amazing host and is probably one of the nicest people I've ever met.

3884851,34554643,2015-06-09,32269211,Clara,"Cindy was a great host ! She let us feel home and gave us good local advices. The bedroom is large and comfortable, common areas were clean and functional. The location is very good, in a quiet neighborhood but near Ballard and Fremont that are fancy and hipster-style areas with many bars and restaurants and only 20 minutes by bus to downtown.
I recommend for a stay in Seattle !"

3884851,35300639,2015-06-17,30110976,Eddie,"There aren't enough words to describe how great of a host Cindy is. I stayed here for five nights with my girlfriend.  Cindy was an absolute delight. Her place is a 10 minute walk to Ballard's restaurants, bars. Getting to other parts of the city is easy due to the proximity to bus lines. 

This place is an absolute steal!

"
3884851,35677757,2015-06-21,20941189,Jessica,Cindy was very welcoming and helpful! Everything was exactly what we had hoped for in a beautiful and convenient location!

Cindy was also great and went out of her way to make our stay comfortable.  The neighborhood is in a great location within walking distance to plenty of restaurants.

Alles war sehr gut organisiert (so bekamen wir zb zwei Schlüssel für die Wohnung). Kann diese Unterkunft im Preis- und Leistungsverhältnis nur empfehlen. Auch ließ Cindy 24 Stunden den Ventilator laufen, da es sehr heiß war. Geschäfte sind in der unmittelbaren Nähe sowie Cafés und Co...
Vielen Dank 
Cindy"
3884851,37985918,2015-07-12,7054454,Kathy,Cindy's apartment was just as advertised and very clean.  We enjoyed our stay with her.  We would stay with her again.
3884851,38350215,2015-07-14,11477410,Rod And Theresa,"Our expeience was just as advertised.  The place is simple, but very clean and comfortable.  Cindy was very flexible and accomidating.  A pleasant surprise was the Wi-Fi which was suprisingly hi speed from my experience of similarly priced Airbnb.  I clocked it at 15 Mps, more than enough for streaming movies and uploading photos"
3884851,38501923,2015-07-16,390113,David,Super friendly host with lots of good suggestions for where to go in Seattle. Generous and welcoming- she even took our laundry out of the dryer! Can't recommend her enough.
3884851,39486805,2015-07-24,31171730,Dan,"Cindy was a great host, accommodating, and had great advice in terms of where to go. Bed was extremely comfortable and the place was always quiet. A very relaxed and chill atmosphere. Cindy was available to help us with all of our requests. Her home is such a great location near Ballard and Freemont. I couldn't recommend her more. "
3884851,40406016,2015-07-30,22573308,Jenny,"Cindy was really welcoming and accommodating to us. She gave us lots of tips on things to do in the neighbourhood and in Seattle. The room was really clean, had a great bed, and nice towels for us to use. Her house is really clean and tidy- with a good shower! She offered us coffee in the mornings and was very friendly.  The house is located close to a bus line so very convenient for going into town, there is a supermarket very near by and the neighbourhood has lots of nice restaurants. We would stay with Cindy again if we were in Seattle!"
3884851,40782736,2015-08-02,37484452,Katlyn,Cindy was wonderful- she made us feel very welcome and the apartment is in a great location; we were even able to keep cool during the heat wave. We had the perfect stay.  
3884851,41072072,2015-08-04,32511884,Rich,"Cindy made us feel right at home.  Everything was the way she described it would be.  We appreciated the WiFi, the cleanliness of the room and entire house, the use of her kitchen in the morning, muffins, bagels, coffee, tea, etc.  The bus was only a walk around the block away and a Safeway store (groceries) is just another block away.  The buses are really affordable and run every 15 minutes, so there are no worries in that regard.  We explored the Fremont area with ease, doing our own walking tour using the guides Cindy provided.  We walked down to the beautiful Ballard Locks and enjoyed all the shops along the way.  The Locks and the whole area around them is well worth visiting.  Cindy was always there to answer any of our questions and we felt very privileged to have stayed with her.  She is extremely generous and as friendly a person as you are likely to meet.  "
3884851,41363441,2015-08-07,35185803,Martina,"We spent 3 days in Cindy's  house , everything was ok the room and the bathroom were large and very clean. Cindy was a really kindly and helpfull host. She gave us a lot of  information about the city and a great help when we needed it. "

3884851,42695448,2015-08-15,17051251,Kathy,"We had a great experience staying with Cindy while visiting our son in Seattle.  As other reviewers have stated, the apartment is clean and comfortable with a dual-control sleep number queen-sized bed.  The pictures and description accurately define the experience.  Cindy was very responsive to our inquiries, made us feel comfortable from the moment we arrived, and generously shared the common areas of the apartment with us.  The apartment is located in the highly desirable neighborhood of Ballard, a very safe and walkable area.  You can easily access the downtown area with public transportation.  The Rapid Transit D-line stop is just 2 blocks away and will take you to Seattle Center or Pike Place in less than 15 minutes without needing to transfer.   We look forward to sampling all of the different neighborhoods as we plan our future trips to Seattle but would not hesitate to stay with Cindy again."
3884851,43410762,2015-08-19,39726176,Ida,"As most will tell you, Cindy was helpful in advice on how to get around  with tips on where to go as well as brochures for us to leaf through. We happened to arrive shortly after her apple cobbler came out and she was very generous in offering it to us even with ice cream--how could we say no? She also had english muffins and other breakfast-y/snack-y foods and condiments for us to use, as well as water and towels waiting for us in the room. The area was very easy to get around to other places and fun to hang around as well--I really like Ballard and staying with her, especially for my first Airbnb experience. She's a world traveller and has some cool things to say if you get past any shyness you might have. Highly recommended spot!"
3884851,44116607,2015-08-24,35156586,Stav,"Cindy and Guy were so nice and very welcoming. They were happy to give us tips for our stay in Seattle. The room was very clean and big, the bed was comfortable and the shower was great. Ballard neighborhood is very nice we went to the sunday farmers market and to the ballard locks. Public transportation is great you have busses every ten minutes or so in a few blocks walking distance. We truely recommend staying at Cindy's house!"
3884851,44701034,2015-08-28,7556545,Devon,"Cindy was a great host, and made us feel very welcome in her home!  The neighborhood is nice and quiet, but is close to lots of interesting stuff in Ballard.  If you have a car, there is plenty of on street parking nearby."
3884851,45266261,2015-09-01,37843381,David,"Staying with Cindy was great. She was welcoming and immediately hospitable. The place was as advertised and she responded quickly to any questions or concerns over air bnb. Her home is in a great location. Cindys home was clean and and cozy, the bed was very comfortable. Overall, my wife and I would definitely stay with her the next time I'm in Seattle!!"
3884851,46381553,2015-09-10,36735386,Valeria,"It was my first time in Seattle and frankly it couldn't have been better. Cindy and her folks (one of which has four legs and red hair) are lovely and always in for a nice chat, but also very understanding with people who, like me and my mate, were on and off the house for working reasons on a regular basis. The house is a little jewel, the room is very clean and spacious. No noise, no nasty neighborhood. Cindy is a splendid host willing to make people at ease. The house is just minutes away from downtown Ballard (round 10 mins walk) and very very close to at least 3 bus lines to downtown Seattle. So, no need to struggle for transport, which is definitely a plus if there is no car available. A few spots for last minute shopping (Safeway, Wallgreens...) are just round the corner. I would recommend this place to anybody wanting to stay in Ballard. Which honestly is the best place to stay in Seattle:)
"
3884851,46919833,2015-09-14,41294584,Kristin,"Easy, pleasant, neat and clean.  Neighborhood is nice, but parking is limited."
3884851,47183256,2015-09-16,28131377,Genise,"Good tour, including available breakfast items, how to use coffee pot. She allowed us to come in early to leave our bags before sightseeing on our first day. The location was great for proximity to good bus to downtown (rapid D) and the good restos & shopping in both old Ballard & the Ballard market, which has good carryout."
3884851,48323640,2015-09-25,8752764,John,"Cindy made it very easy to get the key even though I arrived before she got home and she was very welcoming when we met later that evening. She even provided some simple breakfast foods to complete the BnB experience.

The room is quite nice, the bed is very comfortable, and the whole place is fairly quiet. The apartment is just two blocks from great transit options to get you straight to downtown quickly and is an easy walk to some really great spots for food and entertainment in Ballard."
3884851,48891438,2015-09-29,40913804,Kok Meng,"Wonderful host provide us with good breakfast and help us book taxi to the airport. Very clean room and change tower without us asking. Very helpful and friendly, highly recommend anyone to stay with Cindy. "

3884851,53404510,2015-11-08,27282225,Kellie,Cindy is lovely! She and her home are both warm and comforting. The bed is also incredible! She had great suggestions for great restaurants and things to do around the area. I would definitely suggest staying here!
3884851,54660553,2015-11-22,14337930,Gina,Cindy and Guy were great hosts. They left out food and coffee for us in the morning. The shared bathroom was never an issue. We kind of kept to ourselves and they were respectful of that. We also ended up needing to bring our puppy with us last minute and Cindy was very accommodating. 
3884851,56268115,2015-12-11,4162524,Xuan,"Cindy was very welcoming during my stay at her place. The place is just as described in the apartment's profile. Super clean, the cat is very nice, and her boyfriend was also welcoming. Every morning, there was breakfast for us if needed and she had let me use her laundry detergent for a load of washing when it was needed. My friend and I had a great cozy time here. The bus stop to downtown is literally 5 min walking distance. Takes about 30 minutes to Pike Public Market. It's a super close walk (5-10 mins) to Ballard's downtown where you can check out some bars, coffee shops, and farmers market on the weekend. Safeway is in walking distance if you needed anything. Overall, great experience, cozy place, cozy room, and the heater was money when it was cold! :)"
3884851,57468872,2015-12-26,16760248,Robert,"Having a place to stay close to our children in Ballard was a godsend. Cindy's apartment was clean, close and comfortable. "
3884851,58432999,2016-01-02,24226616,Chris,"We had a really nice stay at Cindy's room, and felt welcomed. The room and residence were clean and easy to feel comfortable in. Great location with lots of access to fun things to do nearby. They told us about picking up the D-Line bus which had a nearby stop, and knowing that was very helpful. I'd be happy to stay here again."
2357110,33473272,2015-05-28,22763655,Milene,Andrew was very friendly and accommodating - he provided great dinning recommendations. I loved the gym on site!  The apartment is located in the heart of Capitol Hill - everything is in walking distance!

2357110,41675373,2015-08-08,33293656,Puneet,Andrew is very welcoming and helpful.. his place was very clean and location is quite good. Lot of eating options right on the same street.. I would recommend his place to others
2357110,48855148,2015-09-28,28316568,Nicole,"Andrew let me make a last minute reservation, as I was headed into town.  I had the place to myself, which was great.  He made sure I had everything I needed for my stay and quickly answered any questions I had.  The neighborhood was great, with many food and drink places within walking distance.  "
6165353,35695598,2015-06-21,9399521,Michael,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Shae's duplex apartment.  It was ideally situated in Capital Hill just a few minutes from everything.  The apartment was roomy with lots of natural light and a very comfortable feel.  I had to rent a car and there was ample parking, which is foreign to me being from SF."
6165353,44961200,2015-08-30,19111173,Vikram,"Shae was a great host. The space was as described and the bed was very comfortable. Location was great for Capitol Hill night life, although we did uber/lyft when raining. Don't let the outside fool you, the place is ideal for 4 people. "
6165353,45838374,2015-09-06,28928795,Lucas,"The house is very centrally located (it's a 40 minute walk to Pike Place and a 45 minute walk to the Space Needle). Everything is very cozy and well kept, and we had a great time rocking out to vinyl records in the living room. Shae was very nice and we felt very welcome in her house. "
6165353,57475431,2015-12-26,51041675,Priscilla,Shae was a very accommodating host. Her instructions were clear and it was easy to find the home. The home has a very homey feel with lots of character. My family and I enjoyed our stay there. It was located in a quiet neighborhood with easy access to the main area of Capitol Hill.  Thanks for being a wonderful host! 
392140,1235242,2012-05-06,2140101,Simon,"If a super friendly, and laid back west coast atmosphere is what you're looking for, and for a good price, Leslie's tin house is the place to be! Leslie even offered to pick myself and my girlfriend up from the Seattle harbor, a very kind gesture! The great view and Leslie's eclectic decor, are also great :)"
392140,1306088,2012-05-19,1919591,Sarah,Leslie was a lovely hostess.  She really knows and values her neighborhood and it's clear she enjoys sharing it with visitors.   The place was beautiful.  I loved the openness and rustic comfortable feel combined with the view.  Thanks Leslie! 
392140,1360005,2012-05-27,2451534,Maarten,Leslie was a great host! We enjoyed her lovely house at a great location in Seatle! Waking up in the sunlight was amazing. We were delayed but she was very understanding about the situation! Amazing stay!
392140,1461138,2012-06-11,2516146,Lucy,"My husband I came up for a short week for work and really enjoyed our stay at Leslie's home. The house itself is very cool with a lot of recycled and found materials and custom built details. The view itself is incredible and we found ourselves relaxing over tea and a sit on the balcony. Everything was clean and easy. The bed was very comfortable which is always a plus.

The location of her home is very convenient depending on what you are in Seattle for. We were a short walk to the Light Rail which will take you into downtown in about 7 minutes or the stadium in two. Beacon Hill is charming and worth hanging out in if you value true diversity.

Overall, Leslie and her home exceeded our expectations."
392140,1525798,2012-06-20,189030,Adron,Great place. Great location. Amazing house. To top all that off Leslie was a great host.
392140,1569046,2012-06-26,2547230,Mel,"A friend and I stayed at Leslie's tinhouse in the Beacon Hill neighborhood for a weekend this summer. We chose her place for it's location and we were not disappointed. The nearby light rail station provided easy access for the sightseeing we wanted to do, while still having a quiet place to relax and rest in the evening. The living room view of the Seattle Harbor and Olympic Mountain Range is indeed FANTASTIC day or night. The inside of the house is adorable and cozy, and the decor is thoughtful and homey. We did not see Leslie too much but when we did she was helpful with instructions and suggestions. We were able to reach her by cell phone when we needed to. If you are looking for a unique but comfortable and practically located accommodation, I would highly recommend Leslie's!"
392140,1736116,2012-07-17,2853238,Sophie,"We have really appreciated our stay at Leslie's home, really as fantastic as the view, charming, personnalized, cosy, and spacious. We have loved the elegant stair in the middle of the living room, our large and confortable bed, and bedroom, and the bathroom with the original bath ! Our guest has been truely welcoming, making us feel like at home. We would be happy to come back if we should visit seattle again, and definitly recommand it !"
392140,1742777,2012-07-18,2860122,Marc,"Leslie was friendly and accommodating. She even went out  of her way to pick me up at the train station and drop me off at the light rail.  Leslie is an interesting woman with varied interests and I enjoyed chatting with her.  Despite (or maybe because of) being a little rough around the edges, Leslie's Tin House is one of the quirkiest, most unique spaces I've ever had the pleasure of visiting.  The view from her deck in phenomenal and the location is convenient to public transportation,  SeaTac and downtown."
392140,1765480,2012-07-21,1532448,Travis,"Beautiful house very close to downtown. Leslie was a great host and was more than willing to help me navigate the city. The room was very spacious and comfortable, views were incredible!"
392140,1771712,2012-07-22,2860122,Marc,"Leslie was friendly and accommodating. She even went out of her way to pick me up at the train station and drop me off at the light rail. Leslie is a dynamic woman with varied interests and I enjoyed chatting with her.

392140,1785820,2012-07-23,3005899,Simon,"This was the right choice for our first airbnb trip; 
great location, Leslie is a very friendli and helpful host and she gave us a lot of informations about the city and recommended restaurants.
The view over the harbor with the mountains in the background is amazing. A good place to stay also more than only one night, we enjoyed it at Leslie. 
Thank you."
392140,1805957,2012-07-26,2639681,Joseph And Marc,"Leslie was the perfect host and her home is even more beautiful in person! The room that we stayed in was clean and super cozy. The view from the living room windows is astounding. One thing you'll notice about the space is that Leslie has put her heart and soul into every inch. Her home is full of DIY style and eccentric charm. Leslie herself is an intelligent and worldly individual, who gave us some great suggestions for things to do around town and was very welcoming. Her house is located in the middle of an eclectic neighborhood, just a hop skip and jump away from the Light Rail. Her neighborhood is also home to a nice little coffee shop called ""The Station"" and a really yummy restaurant called Baja Bistro (perfect for brunch). We both had a very enjoyable stay at the Tinhouse and our stay in Seattle was so inspiring that we're now thinking about moving there for good! "
392140,1841827,2012-07-30,2474679,Claire,"The Tinhouse was my first ever airbnb.com experience and Leslie's hospitality really did set the tone for the rest of my trip. The house is fabulous and fascinating, and Leslie is the perfect host - laid back, welcoming and let's you simply get on and do your own thing. The location is super convenient for exploring the city, and the neighbourhood has some cool things going on too. And the view from the deck....way better than any five-star hotel in the city! Can't praise the place enough and would most definitely make a beeline for The Tinhouse on my next visit. Leslie, you rock!"
392140,1917455,2012-08-07,2548995,Cori,"Leslie's home is the ideal ""home base"" to explore Seattle.  It is spacious and Leslie is very knowledge and welcoming.  We found it easy to access to public transportation system to attend a Sounders game and explore Pike's Place Market!  Thank you to Leslie for a cozy space and warm visit!!"
392140,1962522,2012-08-12,2364407,Mark,Leslie was the perfect host and her place was charming and fun. It has a great view and a nice deck to view it. We really enjoyed our stay at the tin house and also Seattle. Access to the city and airport was excellent via bus or light rail. Can't recommend it more highly!
392140,2033629,2012-08-19,3191392,Natalie,"Leah and Leslie were wonderful and very accomodating! The TinHouse was amazing, close to the city yet in a very comfortable neighborhood just outside of the frenzy. Which means amazing views and quiet evenings if we chose to have them! Great vibes, people, and space!"
392140,2068635,2012-08-22,2957709,Ruby,Leah's place is great. We arrived to a beautiful sun setting behind the Olympics and just sat on the upstairs balcony and watched the sun go down The place is so artfully balanced and is wonderfully creative. We slept very well and easily made breakfast for ourselves with fixings in the fridge. Leah also was very responsive to our questions and in popped by to say hello. 
392140,2163041,2012-09-01,3212553,Erica,"We loved this place.  It was exactly as described.  I worried a little about negotiating the shower without grab bars, but everything worked out just fine.  The aesthetics and personal touches made us feel very at home in someone else's space.

Leah answered all communications promptly and responsively."
392140,2181229,2012-09-03,3179240,Rhea,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Leah's place for one night on two separate occasions.  Leah provided excellent communication prior to both check-ins.  The house is easy to find and located in a very convenient neighborhood for coming in and out of the city.  The view from the porch is  AMAZING!  The interior is beautifully and eclectically decorated.  The bathroom and bedroom were clean.  We went out and did not want to drive, the cab ride home each time was only about $10.  

Overall, it was a great experience.  We would not hesitate to stay there again.  "
392140,2223454,2012-09-07,206203,Amanda,"The Tin House is one of the more unique places I have stayed in Seattle (and I have stayed in a lot of AIRBNB places!). It is a bit rough around the edges but also captivating in many ways. It is centrally located, well equipped, and has a wonderfully comfortable bed. Leah made check-in and out easy. The view is of industrial Seattle and Elliot Bay and is quite dramatic at sunset and at night. The soaking tub is awesome. I would definitely stay there again."
392140,2265915,2012-09-11,1626692,Jenny,"This apartment was amazing! Gorgeous view, beautiful and open living space, and a way comfy bed. On our first night there, we enjoyed a couple of local beers on the balcony while watching the breath-taking sunset and wouldn't budge until it was done! This place was exactly what we wanted-- really close to everything and easy to get to/from, but still quiet and relaxing. Leah was warm and easy to get ahold of, and was quick to reply to our questions. We basically can't wait to go back and stay here again!"
392140,2288020,2012-09-14,3421046,Andrew,"This was our first airbnb experience; what a great way to start. Communication was prompt and clear. Leah was available but very unobtrusive. Leslie’s apartment is unusual and quirky (up a metal staircase so not for the frail), full of old wood, with a spiral staircase, a rocking chair on the porch, overlooking a magnificent view. She left us a crib sheet that looked like something from Ahab’s cabin. The tin house  isn’t modern and pristine, but the bed linen is clean and of good quality and the bathroom is fresh. Everything about is original and charming, even if the china is a bit chipped or the floor is bare. Only an interesting person would own a place like this. "
392140,2399462,2012-09-24,2162970,Ryan,"Leslie's place is a great and beautiful house to stay. The views from the balcony are exceptional and the layout of the house is interesting as well. Everything was clean and Leslie affords you privacy if that is what you need. Overall, a great place to stay and I recommend it to anyone coming to Seattle.  "
392140,2472246,2012-10-01,1419216,Keenan,"Leslie was extremely welcoming, and has an absolutely beautiful home which she has clearly put a lot of love into. The guest bedroom we stayed in was huge, and the view was amazing. We parked the car and got around seamlessly with the bus which stops barely a block from her house.

Most importantly though, Leslie was awesome. Letting strangers share your home can surely be awkward, but she was so warm and the shared time with her was as refreshing and interesting as the whole of our trip. We highly recommend the Tin House!"
392140,2554299,2012-10-08,3256289,John,"I stayed for one night with Leslie. What a comfortable and relaxing experience. Her house is amazing. Fantastically appointed and she's a super hostess. I booked at the very last minute (i.e. the night before) and Leslie made this happen. When I got to her place on a beautiful sunny afternoon she was waiting to greet me and show me around. The view was spectacular, especially sitting in the rocking chair on the balcony with a cold beer. The location was perfect. Close to everything but in a quiet, drowsy neighbourhood. Shops, grocery store, bistro, ATM, Light Rail, restaurants and taco kiosk all a few blocks away. Easy access to downtown. I went out in town for my first night and came home rather late. My room with the lights out and the blinds drawn was lovely and cool and dark and quiet and the bed was so comfortable. I slept like one of the 3 Bears. Next day I was going to go back into Seattle but decided to just mooch about the neighbourhood and have a fairwell drink with Leslie instead. Getting to the airport from Leslie's is a piece of cake too. Light Rail goes direct or you can grab a cab for about $25 if you have too much luggage. I really can't wait to go back and stay longer. Super spot, Super house, Super girl."
392140,2567667,2012-10-09,2125916,Wiley,"Leslie was a great warmhearted lady. Her home is unique and welcoming. There are many plants and cool art pieces in the room. If you are inside of the house, any direction you look at, you will find something interesting that makes you pause for a moment. The location of the place isn't far to walk to light rail station to the airport."
392140,2634986,2012-10-16,3696840,Taylor,This was my first time using Air bnb and i could not have had a better experience. Leslie was more then accomadating and her place was quit unique with a very laid back style.  The view was fantastic and was easy to get in and out of down town. I would highly recommend this place.
392140,2767624,2012-10-30,1838119,Stephen,"What a beautiful place to stay! The pictures of the place were spot on ... a beautiful view from the back porch, and an awesome space with a very DIY, almost ""treehouse"" feel. Very relaxing, very welcoming, super comfy. Leslie was the perfect host. Very accommodating, but since her room is on the second floor and she was gone during the day, it was like we had the place all to ourselves. Definitely recommended."
392140,2870852,2012-11-12,4060984,Matt,"Leslie was a fantastic host and her home is very comforting.  The view is amazing, the house is perfectly located, and Leslie is/was more than accommodating!  When I'm back in Seattle I will definitely stay there again.  The bed is super comfortable and everything seemed to have it's place.  Thanks a million Leslie!"
392140,2895795,2012-11-16,132575,Charles,"This is the 2nd time I have stayed in Leslie's home and both stays have been great.  The Tin House is a comfortable, unique space for guests and it is located in a part of Seattle convenient to both Downtown and Capitol Hill.  Finally, interactions with Leslie are always smooth which always helps make your trip easier.  "
392140,2920376,2012-11-19,4042301,Travis,Amazing View! Very charming home and a wonderful host! She was very helpful in finding where to catch the local transit system and was happy to help! Everything went on without a hitch! Leslie has made our first AirBnB experience great. She has also made sure that we will do it again!
392140,3233812,2013-01-02,4107148,Jenny,"Leslie's place is very cozy and clean. She is a generous hostess and very accommodating. Her place has easy access to the new light rail, and only ten minutes by car from the center of downtown. I would recommend her home.  "
392140,3418814,2013-01-26,4817770,Brian,"Leslie was very hospitable.  Her place was warm and cozy.  She was very flexible in terms of scheduling.  Her place is located in north Beacon Hill, near the old Pac Med hospital/former Amazon HQ, and therefore has quick, easy access to downtown Seattle."
392140,3608929,2013-02-22,4790211,Jochen,Can really recommend staying  at Leslie's place. She's a nice and easy going person and flexible and good to talk to. The location is good with view of the city and direct bus (#36) to King Street Station. Also check out the photo of Beacon Hill and the story about it. Would stay here again for sure.
392140,4119522,2013-04-11,5554776,Tyler,"I loved staying here! Leslie is a wonderful host, very friendly, easy-going, and helpful. The space is tidy, unique, and comfortable -- and, it has a cool Pacific Northwestern aesthetic. The bathroom and Japanese sit tub are charming. The house is situated in a nice, quiet neighborhood, and location-wise is a short drive to most places of interest in and around (website hidden): thanks for the breakfast! "
392140,4498383,2013-05-08,6130758,Peter,"I found Leslie to be a great host who was extremely helpful when it came to exploring Seattle and the surrounding area. Her home not only has great character but has stunning views over the port, Puget Sound and the snow-capped mountains in the distance. It's also conveniently located for bus services and is less than 10 minutes walk to Beacon Hill's 'Link Light Rail ' station. I even walked to the Downtown / International District and Amtrak railway station in under 40 minutes. I stayed for 3 nights and slept like a log. Highly recommended."
392140,4792386,2013-05-26,281566,Ange,"My flight got delayed, and Leslie helped me check on the transport routes available and gave me advice on how to get to her place safely. Her place has an awesome view, and is terribly convenient (I could walk downtown!)
I didn't get a chance to meet her in person because our travel plans clashed, but Leslie kept in touch via the phone, and she gave me a heads-up on a music festival this weekend. Leslie was very nice and accommodating, and I would definitely stay with her again if I'm ever in the area."
392140,4968840,2013-06-04,1307985,Amanda,"Leslie's home is amazing! The view was breathtaking, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was gorgeous (and had great water pressure) and the decor was fabulous! You can spend hours looking around at every little detail in the apartment - from the plants to the antiques to the mugs! Loved it! "
392140,5000688,2013-06-06,6598601,Sharra,"AWESOME. The place was lovely and very very convenient. Leslie was amazingly accomdating. Everything people have said on past reviews was exemplified to the nth degree. She was not only great w recommendations but also really took into account who i was and why i was there. The views, the bathtub (!!!) ,The location were perfect for my business trip.  Will be staying here again."
392140,5185124,2013-06-17,2562343,Jorge Benoît,"We had a great time at Leslie´s house. The room is very quiet and very easy to get to downtown and Capitol Hill, our favorite district !!!!
The view from the house is spectacular !! and Leslie is always ready to help you and give you all the information you need."
392140,5298234,2013-06-23,1288118,Taylor,Leslie was a great host and her home was lovely! It was very accessible and had a beautiful view from her front porch. I would definitely recommend staying with her
392140,5371651,2013-06-26,6763103,Austin,"Leslie's home was very pleasant, clean, and easily accessible. It lived up to expectations and then some. I would definitely stay with her again"
392140,5551204,2013-07-05,5108864,Brian,"The whole interior is a conversational piece, and Leslie a wonderful host. Very comfortable place, bright and breezy with a great deck view looking west over the Puget Sound. A nice toned down feel with items of reclaimed wood (awesome sink counter) and iron accents, and a great kitchen space for cooking in. All creative and interesting. "
392140,5600868,2013-07-08,731212,Jacqui,"My mom and I loved staying at Leslie's place! There are so many great little touches everywhere, and it's a truly unique space. Leslie happened to be out of town while we were there, so we had the space to ourselves, but we talked by phone beforehand, and she was very helpful, and sounded like someone who would have been fun to meet in person. Maybe next time!

We found a couple of great spots to visit in the neighborhood--Traveler's is a south Indian restaurant very close to the rail station. It came recommended by Leslie, and our dinner was delicious! If you happen to come on a hot day like we did, there's a great patio outside. Then we stumbled onto a great cafe the next morning called The Station Cafe. Don't miss it if you are in the area! Super nice people and great baked breakfast goods. "
392140,5751126,2013-07-15,1903645,Kumiko,"The thing that really stood out for me about Leslie's place was the amazing view and amount of natural sunlight it gets. My friend and I spent most of our time out on the balcony looking towards the bay with our mugs in hand just relaxing or taking pictures of the beautiful sunset. The neighborhood is quiet (I probably got the best sleep even though it wasn't my own apt!) and walking distance to coffee shops, lightrail and close to Jefferson Park that made my inner kid's heart skip a beat! We were busy running around helping at our friend's wedding but would definitely recommend Leslie's place if you're in Seattle."
392140,5818783,2013-07-17,381411,Stephanie,"The Tin House was easy to find, and is a completely unique, beautiful and artful space.  I loved everything about my stay here.  Leslie is so cool and inspiring - I think it took about 4 seconds to feel comfortable with her and in her space.  The first night we shared stories and wine on her deck overlooking Seattle and the mountains.   Everything is thoughtfully available - all the amenities and then some- an awesome Japanese tub and shower, a very comfy bed, maps, local suggestions, clean and beautiful surroundings!  Oh and her tea selection should be applauded...(Russian Caravan? Carrot Curry?!) Thanks for the awesome Airbnb experience and fantastic conversations!  
"
392140,5855577,2013-07-19,6581079,Claudia,Leslie and her place were amazing! It felt so homey and calming. It was a wonderful retreat on my long trip. The bed was incredibly comfortable and Leslie was so accommodating. She offered up her entire fridge contents and I loved just chatting with her about our lives and random topics. I would definitely stay there again!
392140,5892641,2013-07-21,7077141,Janice,"Our first Air BNB experience and it was fantastic. Leslie is an excellent host and a very interesting gal. Her home was unique, warm and comfortable and in an excellent location, close to the light rail for going to the stadiums or exploring downtown or other attractions. Beautiful view from the deck. Lots of great nearby restaurants in the Beacon Hill Area. Communication was excellent. Would stay there again in a flash. "
392140,5977990,2013-07-24,1208759,John,Leslie's place feels like a real home. And it's made from many reclaimed materials! She is an energetic and welcoming host. The view is really great too. Highly recommended.
392140,6134692,2013-07-31,7291775,Travis,"After our train was delayed heading into Seattle, I contacted Leslie to let her know we would be late.  She was nothing but hospitable, and a delight to stay with.  This being our first Airbnb stay, the bar has been set pretty high!

Leslie's house is so very unique and spacious, and the views of the sound are unreal!  Such a great little neighborhood too!  Public transit is completely walkable.  We are already planning a return trip, and will definitely check with Leslie first for lodging!"
392140,6258078,2013-08-05,2049982,John,"I had a wonderful stay here!  Leslie's place is in a quiet, comfortable neighbourhood, but only a quick bus or train ride away from downtown.  The house itself is beautifully renovated, with a spacious bedroom and very large and comfortable bed.  I spent most of my time in Seattle out and about, but I would have been happy spending more time in this fantastic house!"
392140,6351007,2013-08-09,6832520,Brad,"Got to stay at Leslies' place earlier this month for my first Airbnb experience and was not disappointed. Leslie was a great host for my 2 nights there, offering full access to the house. Weather was great which made the views over Seattle even better to witness in person. The house was a short walk to the light rail station which made getting downtown easy and was a definite plus. Thanks again Leslie for everything!

392140,6488093,2013-08-14,7078102,Michael,"Leslie was super helpful before and during my stay. Her place has great energy and the bed was very comfy. There are lots of public transport options available nearby, and if you don't mind braving the hills, biking is a great option. Overall, it was an excellent first time using Airbnb. Thanks!"
392140,6550848,2013-08-16,8124170,Markus,Leslie was amazing. Very accommodating and helpful. The place was very clean and really close to all you need. The light rail was ever so convenient for someone who is from outta town. On our last night there we all cooked dinner drank wine and shared stories. Felt like I made a friend and will definitely be back when I come to Seattle again. 
392140,6666617,2013-08-20,7764472,Beth,"Great place, great experience. Leslie was hugely helpful with advice (including multiple texts about transportation the first night I arrived); lots of fun to talk with, but also respectful of privacy. Her place is beautiful--fascinating renovation, amazing view. Room was clean, spacious, and comfortable. And being near the light rail made a huge difference."

392140,7232980,2013-09-11,5466133,Bliss,"Leslie was a fantastic host in Seattle, and the Tinhouse was perfectly situated for all my needs.  Not only that, but the view is spectacular from the front porch and it is a great, peaceful neighborhood.  Plenty of space to relax in the house as well.  I came to Seattle for work in SODO, and the house was a quick 15 min walk from the studio.  On my day off, transportation into downtown was very easy and quick, both by bus and light rail.  Leslie and I had great conversations, and she was respectful of my space and needs as well.  She even did my laundry for me one day! For the price and pleasure of my stay here, this would be a difficult experience to top.  I plan to stay here again on any subsequent trips to this awesome city."
392140,7907801,2013-10-07,1358501,Catherine,"A great place to stay. A very welcoming, friendly and helpful host.
The view over the city, sea and mountains is stunning and constantly changing. The house is wonderful to be in with exciting use of space. Excellently located with easy access to the city by train or exploring places like Columbia City. 
Brilliant. Thank you Leslie."
392140,8127233,2013-10-16,5210295,Jimmy,"Leslie is a wonderful host. The apartment ""es muy chulo."" She lives in a low-key but happening neighborhood a bit south of downtown. The access by metro or taxi to other city sites is fantastic. She goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and makes sure you have a good plan while you are there. I happened to be in town for a conference which cut into my enjoyment but never the less she guided me to some cool off the beaten places. The bed, bathroom, everything was really clean and nice. 

As an aside, she was really great first host and helped me get introduced to the system. She will consider couch surfing profiles (with good references) if you don't have an established AirBnB profile. 

Thanks Leslie! "
392140,8242255,2013-10-21,6666867,Marc,"Had a great time staying at Leslie's place. You instantly feel welcome and at home. Of course the view is great, but even without the view I'd definitely stay there again."
392140,8388922,2013-10-28,9330744,Jenni,"Leslie was very accommodating and helpful. She gave us directions, told us about some local places to eat and was generally pleasant. The house was unique and made for an excellent story upgrade to my weekend in Seattle. Something very important to me is a good shower and I was not disappointed. The Japanese soak Tub was amazing and I highly recommend using it if you stay with Leslie. The room was big, bed was comfortable and everything nice and clean. I also loved the location, few minutes’ walk from a grocery store, restaurants and the light rail which gives you access all over Seattle. We did get locked out once, which she did warn us about, but perhaps a backup key would be a good idea. I did really appreciate the fact that she knew we had a very late night function to attend and let us sleep in on the day we had to leave. This is a great spot and you will be happy with your stay. Thank you much Leslie!"
392140,8919849,2013-11-25,9576937,Russell,"This was our 2nd AirBnB experience, and the 1st Private Room experience, something I didn't pay much attention to at the time I booked my stay. I wasn't sure how we'd feel about this, but wanted to give it a try. Turns out that Leslie's offering is a great Private Room option in the Seattle area.

I've realized, upon some reflection, that staying in a room in Leslie's apartment felt a little like visiting an old college friend you hadn't seen for awhile. What I mean by this is that Leslie was technically a ""stranger,"" in that we were meeting for the first time, yet there was something altogether very familiar about her. She treated us (my wife and I) just like friends she hadn't met yet. Leslie was great about explaining everything from local public transportation options, to the workings of her apartment, from making coffee to how the front door locks. 

We live 25 miles north of Seattle, and are starting to use AirBnB to stay overnight in neighborhoods where we're having dinner, attending an event, etc. I could see us staying again at Leslie's if we have the need again in the future."
392140,9570972,2014-01-02,1160814,Aimee,"Leslie's home is one of the loveliest places that we've stayed through airbnb. We really lucked out as it was only a few blocks from some friends of ours, so it was easy to visit with them and then come back and relax at her beautiful home. We didn't get to meet her as she was out of town, but she made everything seamless and comfortable for us. We found getting the key back to its spot to be a little tricky upon checking out, but she did leave her #, and we should have taken advantage of that and just called her for help! We are full of gratitude for getting to stay in her place, and we found it calm, peaceful, and inspiring. Thank you!"
392140,10442709,2014-02-18,4318012,Becca,"I had a great experience staying at the Tin House. The Beacon Hill location was within walking distance to the Light Rail station which provides easy access to downtown. The neighborhood itself has a cool vibe with restaurants and a grocery store close at hand. Leslie was a generous host who responded to my interests and provided recommendations that led to a great trip. The bedroom is a generous size, the communal spaces have a great vibe, and the house enjoys a wonderful view (weather permitting). Be sure to give yourself enough time to enjoy the Japanese sit tub before you depart! "
392140,10707974,2014-03-03,3750694,Charles & Sulma,"I truly enjoyed my time at the Tin House.  Leslie is extremely gracious.  She was accommodating to arrival/departure schedule as well as my daily coming/going.  Her knowledge about the area was very welcome as I had never been to Seattle  She is also a very engaging person without being intrusive.  The house itself is very artistic--antique doors and door knobs, custom welded staircases etc.  Unique art pieces abound around the house.  The bed is very comfortable.  The house is quiet and has a magnificent view.  Sitting on her couch, drinking a cup of tea, and staring out over the water to the mountains was a great way to start the day.  Thanks Leslie!"
392140,11192307,2014-03-24,12435851,Joyce,"Leslie was an amazing host!  Her place is great in all ways--quiet, fantastic view, awesome Japanese tub and deck!  The experience was great in all respects! 
"
392140,13167222,2014-05-20,10979856,Lindsay,"My stay at the Tin House was great! Leslie is a lovely, welcoming, very interesting host. She had lots of information about the area and great recommendations for places to visit. The house is delightful and quirky with many of the fixtures and fittings made from reconditioned/ repurposed materials. The bedroom is very spacious, bright, clean and quiet. The view is fantastic with beautiful sunsets over Puget Sound and the mountains. Public transport links are close by and make it easy to get into downtown Seattle and all the tourist hotspots. Thanks to Leslie's advice I visited some wonderful places that weren't on my itinerary and wouldn't have known about otherwise. I would wholeheartedly recommend a stay with Leslie if you're ever in the Seattle area! Thanks for having me :)"
392140,13384393,2014-05-26,9837878,Sue,"This was our first AirBnB experience, and it was a great one. Leslie is a very engaging and interesting host. The house is very unique and comfortable with a wonderful view. Great bed! It's close to transit so you don't really need a car to go downtown. We had a lovely time.
"
392140,13477424,2014-05-28,12525568,Kerryanne,"We only stayed 1 day (2 nights), but it was a very good and relaxed time. Her place is perfectly placed for train/bus travel, and Leslie is a very friendly and helpful hostess. Nothing was too much trouble.  We would definitely recommend her place for travellers through Seattle."
392140,14005786,2014-06-09,15972192,Friedrich,"I stayed with my girlfriend for two nights at Leslie's place. It was a very nice time and I can highly recommend. The place is very homely and arranged in a nice and personal style. Leslie was a very caring host and she helped us to have a good time in Seattle and in the Olympic mountains. As already outlined in other reviews, the view is brilliant and it takes you about 20 minutes walk+subway to go tho the city center."
392140,14302039,2014-06-16,2819329,Stephanie And Michael,"This was a fantastic experience! Leslie went above and beyond in making us feel welcome. Her house is eclectic, thoughtful and clean. We highly recommend staying here."
392140,14551645,2014-06-22,13203782,Felicia,"This is a cool apartment in the Beacon Hill neighborhood.  Guest accommodation is a spacious room on the second floor, with living room, bath and kitchen shared with the owner.  The place is comfortable and clean, and the view from the living room and balcony is terrific.  You can see the ferries and tugboats plying the waters below.  The place was quiet, the bed was very comfy, and we always found a spot to park on the street.  Leslie made the meet-up easy, and she was gone all weekend, so we had the place to ourselves.  This would not be a good choice for someone with limited mobility.  In addition to the stairs up to the apartment, to get into the shower you have to go up a step, over an edge, and then step down into the sunken tub.  Go over a couple of blocks and treat yourself to a meal at the Baja Bistro.  Delicious chorizo and eggs for breakfast!"
392140,14887690,2014-06-28,8878021,Lin,"I stayed at the Tin House for 4 nights, and it was a great experience. The house is  amazing with great views. The location is excellent, I can easily access to the bus or light rail and grab a cup of nice coffee on the way. Leslie is a fantastic host, very easy going and communicable, she's also fun and interesting to have conversations with. The neighborhood is friendly, not too busy like in the city but easily enough to get to downtown. Couldn't think of a better place to stay for visiting Seattle. Highly recommend it!"
392140,15345700,2014-07-07,16773879,Jenice,"This was our first AirBnB experience which we found quite enjoyable.  Leslie was
a great host. Location is close to the rail and restaurants. Easy parking available.
Fantastic view. We had a very positive experience."
392140,15779432,2014-07-15,16960551,Kai,"We had a great time at the Tin House. It is really a unique place, you can see, that it was build with a lot of passion! It was absolutely clean and the room is really big! As you probably read in the other reviews, the view is really awesome. Leslie is a great host and gave us some very good advice for the city and the olympic peninsula. We would definitely stay here again!"
392140,15889402,2014-07-17,17738389,Yonghwa,"Leslie's home is very good. Leslie was so sweet and kind. Her house was comfortable we could feel real Seattle. 
Leslie recommeded to us good restaurant and a  way we want to go.
We loved Leslie's house :)"
392140,16085188,2014-07-22,15764586,David,"We stayed 4 nights at the Tinhouse and it was a wonderful experience.  Leslie is a most gracious host and provided a fantastic first experience using Air BnB.  Future hosts will have a high bar to meet.

Leslie's place is quirky, fun, and convenient.  Access to the city is easy with the light rail 5 blocks away and two bus lines less than two blocks away that provide a direct shot to downtown and Capital Hill.  The Beacon Hill neighborhood has a great local coffee shop and food choices with the Baja Bistro and Beacon Avenue Sandwiches."
392140,16270707,2014-07-24,4080195,Qi,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Leslie's Tinhouse, which has a great view at the Olympics mountains at sunset. The place is quiet, low-key, tidy but fully functional with everything that you need for a short-term stay. Leslie is very energetic and open-minded, she maybe one of the few persons that you will feel like to talk to immediately after you meet her in a second. She also gave me some great suggestions for the place I may think of visiting in Seattle. I would highly recommend everyone who is going to the area for the summer to contact her now!"
392140,16564251,2014-07-29,532466,Dana,"Leslie's home, The Tin House is very unique. We loved staying there and recommend it highly for those with an adventurous spirit. "
392140,16854717,2014-08-03,262115,James,"Leslie's place was great for my trip to Seattle. The bed was comfy and the accommodations were great, from the abundant space, to the balcony adjacent to the kitchen that overlooks Puget sound. She was very accommodating for check-in, as my flight was delayed and arrived late into Seattle. And she also allowed me to store a rental bike at her place, which I used to explore the city. The location near the light rail also worked out really well for getting in from the airport as well as travel downtown. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle."
392140,17107558,2014-08-07,9805484,Karin,"The Tinhouse is something special - an extraordinary place with with a wonderful view on the Puget, we will not forget. We felt very well and welcome. Thank you Leslie!!"
392140,17361641,2014-08-11,11711971,Julie,Had a great trip. Leslie was sweet and very helpful. Great house with amazing views
392140,17572493,2014-08-14,17915036,Jordan,"Leslie's house was in a great location for using public transportation. We took the bus or light rail everywhere and it was very easy and convenient. The view is fantastic, as stated, and Leslie seems really knowledgeable about the city, which is very helpful when planning activities.
The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom is quite spacious, which was nice.
Overall, we had a great experience!"
392140,17955646,2014-08-19,16833058,Renee,"As our first airbnb stay this was a wonderful experience. The view was definitely FANTASTIC! A nice, easy walk to the light rail also was a plus giving us access to Seattle's downtown area and airport. Leslie was welcoming and easy going, willing to give recommendations for eateries and directions to the local businesses (market, coffee house, yoga). The king size bed was very comfortable and we slept very well while we were there. The step in shower/tub was very unique. Having access to the refrigerator was nice allowing us to store our yogurt and fruit for breakfast. Leslie had available to us coffee and tea. We would definitely stay here again! "
392140,18093753,2014-08-21,14676966,Heather,"An excellent place to stay. Super comfortable, relaxed and easy. Loved that it was only 5 blocks from the light rail ad a quick train ride to downtown. "
392140,18190348,2014-08-23,7972673,Fabio,"We had a short but very nice stay at Leslie's place. We arrived in Seattle very late in the night but Leslie found a way to let us inside, and she also helped us with our luggage lost at the airport, very very cute! The house is very clean and it's exactly as shown in the pictures; it is also very close to a bus stop, and only a few blocks away from a light rail station. If you want to go to visit Seattle, i can definitively suggest Leslie's place."
392140,18667787,2014-08-30,9528907,Sophie,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle. The house is amazing (and very energy efficient), the guest room is very nice and indeed the view is magnificent. The place is located outside of downtown, yet still easily and affordably accessible from both the inner city and airport thanks to the light rail. Leslie is a very experienced airbnb host and always helpful if we needed anything."
392140,18945542,2014-09-03,18059731,Liang,"I had a great experience staying at Leslie's for 4 days. She was very welcoming and clear in explaining everything. The room I stayed in was spacious and tidy, and had clean sheets, clean towels, and was fairly private. The house in general was clean and organized, and the shared restroom was right next to my room, which made life easy. Leslie made efforts to arrange things in the area of the house that I was living in so it was without clutter and I never felt I was disturbing her home. She is also friendly and does not mind having conversations with you, and if you have questions about Seattle activities, she knows a ton!

The neighborhood is very residential, and quiet at all hours of the day and night. I got great sleep my whole stay there. It is only about 1 block from a bus ($2.50 fare) which travels from this area to the Seattle downtown area - very convenient. The link to SEATAC airport is also within walking distance, but takes about 10-15 min depending on how fast you walk.

Overall I had a great time!"
392140,19095920,2014-09-06,1657954,Ellen,"Leslie was a wonderful host, didn't see much of her but when we did, we had some nice chats. She was very helpful telling us how to get around the city and such. The view from the livingroom is incredible and the bedroom is very spacious. Don't look any further, just stay here if you're visiting Seattle."
392140,19295726,2014-09-09,2385128,Olivia,We had a fabulous time in Seattle at Leslie's place. She made us feel incredibly welcome and will offer to share tips for getting around and having a good time seeing the city. The king bed was amazing. Would highly reccomend!

392140,20376284,2014-09-28,2842907,Anthony And Audrey,"Leslie's house is located at the top of a hill, less than 10 minutes walk to the light rail. The view from the deck is simply fantastic, we could see the ferry boats commuting in the bay and hear the loud cheers from the baseball stadium. The house is very charming, its design is unique and eclectic. The decoration mixes eastern and western culture very well. We really felt comfortable there. 
Leslie is a very welcoming host, she had a lot to share through conversations, tips and advice. We had a great with her.
I would definitely recommend this place."
392140,25641688,2015-01-21,13225626,Silviu,"Great experience, great host, great space. highly recommended!"
392140,27607964,2015-03-08,26507818,Yoshiko,I had a wonderful stay! Leslie was very helpful and accommodating.  Beautiful space and perfect for my weekend away.  Very easy to get around to other parts of the city.  I would highly recommend!
392140,28989731,2015-04-02,25504678,Denise,"Because we were able to text Leslie regarding our time of arrival, we easily were able to make ourselves at home.  Leslie was friendly and welcoming.  It was a perfect location for us to visit our family in the same neighborhood.  We would happily stay with her again.  "
392140,30846836,2015-04-27,23871496,Jackiez,Leslie was super helpful and accommodating. The house was exactly as described--fantastic view indeed! I didn't use public transportation all that much but it was pretty easy to navigate when I tried. The cabs into town were super cheap--I was shocked how easy it was to get to the really touristy areas. I would definitely recommend this spot (and Leslie's superb hosting skills) to others!
392140,31861405,2015-05-10,2914745,Bernard,"Leslie's cozy home is located at the top of Beacon Hill with a truly fantastic view of the harbour from the living room/balcony. Everything was very well kept and clean, the bed incredibly cozy, and Leslie seemed like a very nice person, though we didn't see much of each other as we spent most of our two days in Seattle out and about. We parked our car for free on the street directly in front of her house and took the #36 bus in to town and back which is about a 20 minute ride. When we stayed out late on Saturday night Leslie even left our room light on so we could easily find our way when we came home. I fully recommend staying at the Tinhouse on your next visit to Seattle!"
392140,32383983,2015-05-17,20328804,Charles,"the hostess has great communication time with you prior to your arrival
a warm welcome greeting you into the very nice home
with a nostalgic feel you will feel relaxed and welcome
rustic kitchen, comfy sitting area and the view is second to none from Beacon Hill.
So close to the entertainment/sports/tourist districts, makes it too easy via the Light Rail."
392140,33605895,2015-05-30,32932003,Ben,"Leslie was extremely helpful, accommodating, and really fun to talk with. She gave excellent advice on everything from good places to eat in her neighborhood to good hiking trails in the national parks. Beacon Hill is a cozy, safe area close to downtown, and the residents are  ethnically and socioeconomically diverse.  As for the house itself, it is filled with as much character as the host, and is situated with an outstanding view. I can't stress enough how much we enjoyed our stay."
392140,33840642,2015-06-01,33255576,Margarita,"The place was even better than I expected from photos. Beautiful view from the deck, relaxing space, fun decor, great bedroom, and Leslie was so kind. Having this place to come home to at night really made me feel grounded during my trip. I can't recommend it enough. "
392140,34675497,2015-06-10,172696,Karen,Was perfect! Great host and lovely home.
392140,34837718,2015-06-12,35347811,Chrystal,Leslie was a very welcoming host and even offered to take me out to some local bars and coffee shops in the area. She gave wonderful food recommendations. The place itself is gorgeous with mind blowing views from the balcony and one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in.

Leslie was really knowledgable about the area, all of her suggestions were exactly what we were looking for. Her location was great,  easy access to public transportation. I highly recommend staying here!"
392140,35457259,2015-06-19,18061549,Terry,"Leslie was a great hostess. She was very helpful and accommodating. The ""Tinhouse"" was exactly as describe and the view from the deck was breath taking of the bay along with the cheery  and fig trees in the backyard. The light rail about 10 minute walk and worked out perfect as It drops you off right in front of the baseball stadium. Also took the light rail to the Space Needle and others attractions. Great way to travel around Seattle. If you want to stay at a quiet and comfortable place I would highly recommend Leslie's ""Tinhouse""."
392140,35677352,2015-06-21,33376846,James,The host did an excellent job.  The place exceeded expectations.  Five stars!!
392140,35967612,2015-06-23,23561991,Bob,"We had a very fine time at Leslie's place. She was very friendly and my wife and I were very comfortable at her home, which overlooked Puget Sound. We had no car so to walk or take a bus to the downtown area was convenient. We would not hesitate to stay there again. "
392140,36411422,2015-06-28,9014223,Winona,"Leslie is a fabulous host, she made me feel at home and comfortable, and had good quality coffee with organic milk! The house is very cute with a nice view, a quiet place to stay, and very close walk to the bus. I had a car and there was always parking right outside. The neighborhood was okay, not the nicest not the worst, but just fine. I would stay there again. Leslie gave me help with things to do and general tips about Seattle. Bed was very comfy too! Thanks Leslie!"
392140,36811823,2015-07-01,35477952,Tamas,"Leslie was a wonderful host. She made me feel at home. Not only did she give me maps and a lot of useful tips she even made me lunch, breakfast and tea.
The view from her place is indeed unique (Rainier, skyline, harbor).
The location was very convenient to public transport and grocery store.
The room was clean, spacious, and the bed was confortable. "
392140,37343203,2015-07-06,5213831,Erin,We had a fabulous time staying at Leslie's place! The view from her deck is absolutely stunning - it's a great juxtaposition of the harbor and stadiums with the Olympic peninsula in the background; we made sure we were home every evening in time to see the sun set! Leslie was a top-notch hostess. She gave us suggestions that got us away from some of the tourist hotspots that really allowed us to see the unique and fun culture of different neighborhoods within Seattle. Her location is great as well; she lives a short walk from the light rail and a yummy Mexican restaurant. Thanks Leslie for helping to make our trip special!
392140,37614034,2015-07-08,4455902,Brian,"Leslie and the Tin House were awesome. The house has incredible charm and it's in a great spot on the south side of town. Light rail is super close with easy access to where you want to go. 
Stay at the Tin House!"
392140,37784606,2015-07-10,36538106,Hee Jeong,Leslie was a great host and tried to help us about public transportation and places to see in Seattle. Her home is inviting with a fantastic view. It is in a good location for public transit. It only takes about 3 minutes of walking to the bus stop and about 20 minutes on the bus to get to downtown. We didn't get to see her much because of our schedule but she offered her towels and kitchen to use and let us have our privacy. It was a great experience. I recommend staying at her place!!! 
392140,37989686,2015-07-12,5789383,Jay,"We had a fantastic stay with Leslie at the tin house. Her space was inviting, creative and comfortable. The room was clean and the bed incredibly comfortable. Although we had a bit of communication trouble due to the airbnb site Leslie went out of her way to make sure we got into the house and oriented to the neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying with Leslie. "
392140,38500030,2015-07-16,14299842,Jessie,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying with Leslie! The house was really funky (loved the creative use of space!) and exactly as described and pictured. Leslie was super responsive, both before and during our trip, made sure we had everything we needed, and was just a great and genuine person to talk to.

The neighborhood is quiet -- a neighborhoody neighborhood -- but, as mentioned, an easy walk to light rail. Plus, there are two good coffee spots along the way (always a perk...)"
392140,38756668,2015-07-18,2930707,Justin,"The apartment had an awesome view of the city. The interior is really fun and airy, with all the amenities of a home. Leslie is a pro at hosting guests and was really accommodating to travelers and their schedules."
392140,39040087,2015-07-20,36010511,Julian,Leslie was such an amazing host! She was very accommodating to our needs. She would answer all of our questions in a timely manner.  She provided us with things to do and check out. She also provided us with information to get from one place to another. She has a unique house with an awesome view. Would totally recommend staying at her place.
392140,39512089,2015-07-24,35596205,Juliet,"Leslie was wonderful and very down to earth.  It was our first time in Seattle and she gave us pointers on where to go and how to travel. She made us feel comfortable as well as gave us our own privacy. Her place was unique and amazing and we felt right at home.  It was a perfect location in between the city and the airport.  The view from her patio and rooftop deck showed off the city skyline and beautiful waterfront as well as the 2 sporting stadiums.  It was my boyfriend and my first time staying at an airbnb; if this is how every airbnb host will be, we will never stay at a hotel again.  ;) Thanks Leslie"
392140,39732380,2015-07-26,6137941,Jeremy,"Went to Seattle to see the Blue Jays play the Mariners. This was a perfect spot to stay, as the balcony has a lovely view of Safeco Field and the ocean beyond. Was also easy to take transit to Pioneer Square. Leslie was really helpful in giving us info on transit, neighbourhoods to check out, etc. House was clean and quiet. We would definitely stay here again."
392140,40752696,2015-08-02,34397296,Priscilla,Leslie was a sweetheart and her tin house made for wonderful accommodations! 
392140,41369726,2015-08-07,35003855,Melanie,My boyfriend and I stayed with Leslie for three wonderful nights. The view from her place is spectacular. She was very gracious and gave us all our privacy. I would highly recommend her place for a stay while in Seattle. 
392140,41822864,2015-08-09,8837353,Catherine,"Leslie is an amazing host! She was very accommodating in terms of our late night-time arrival for our 2-night stay and even checked in with us to make sure that everything was ok. When we met in the morning, she provided us with awesome suggestions on places to eat and things to do & check out; we totally lived and ate like locals.

Leslie also gave us info on getting around - as others have said, the Tin House is close to public transit, you won't need a car if you're heading downtown or over to the stadiums to catch a show or game. 

Her home is uniquely cool, she had a hand in designing and building it herself. If you're a light sleeper like me, make sure you pack a set of earplugs as the trains awakened me even before the sunlight peeking through the shades.  There is a small quirk with closing/opening the bedroom door, but for me it kind of added to the charm of the place.

Definitely recommend staying here if you're considering it."
392140,42283385,2015-08-12,22966418,Max,"One word - Amazing!
Leslie was there to greet us. She was super cool and welcoming. It didn't feel like we were staying at some random persons house, it felt like we were visiting someone we already knew. The room was great, bed super comfy. The house such a great view of the bay and city. You are really close to the rail, so we just parked and didn't drive again till we left. Leslie had some great suggestions and places to check out. The Mexican spot around the corner has some amazing fish tacos. The neighborhood is cool as well."
392140,42690251,2015-08-15,36041446,Gabe,"Nice house with very interesting architectural elements and a great view of the harbor and the baseball stadium. 

At first glance the neighborhood looks a little rough, but we had NO problems walking around and leaving our car parked on the street. I will say the street narrows to one lane because of cars parking on either side so i wouldn't bring a large car or truck. It is within half a mile of good food and public transit. We paid $9 for the two of us to ride the lite rail/bus and it was good for 12 hours.

The room is nice with a comfortable bed.  No A/C, but it is Seattle so you don't really need it. We didn't use the kitchen, but it was nice and organized. My wife LOVED the Japanese style sit tub in the bathroom. You do need to be light footed as she has renters below you on the first floor. This wasn't a problem for us as we tended to only use the space for sleeping and getting ready for the day.

Leslie is a great host and has lots of good info on places to eat and things to do.

If you are coming in for a baseball/soccer/football game this is a great place to stay. it is a 5 min lite rail ride to all the stadiums and 7 min to downtown and the waterfront. It is located directly off I-90 so it makes it super convenient to get around the area."
392140,43066726,2015-08-17,36958286,Jim,The house is beautiful with wonderful iron work everywhere. The views from the balcony were breathtaking. The neighborhood is very diverse and surprisingly quiet for being in such a large city.
392140,43644930,2015-08-21,34011425,Shanyue,Leslie is a really nice host. She helps us a lot. The first night our flight got delayed so we got to her house really late. But she made a really detailed instructions to get her house and prepare mangy things for us. Also the house is really clean and nice. The house has an amazing view of Seattle. The neighbor is good too and it is easy to go to the light rail.
392140,44128339,2015-08-24,20867234,Michelle,What a great place with such a beautiful view of Seattle. Location is pretty sweet and convenient for getting around Seattle. Leslie was very helpful with places to go and how to get around. 
392140,44768526,2015-08-29,15485330,Shane,"We had just the two nights stay with Leslie and she was a great host, even when we caught  her at a busy time.  It's a quirky AIR B and B, comfortable King Bed and if you like bohemian you will enjoy the tin house."
392140,46826218,2015-09-13,6130138,Barbara,"Wonderful place and really amazing view but the best is Leslie! Perfect host and very lovely person with a lot of information about Seattle and the surroundings. 
Oh yes and a very comfortable bed! You need around 30 minutes to downtown (by train) but there is a supermarket and restaurants around the corner. 
"
392140,47541315,2015-09-20,43380092,Matthew,"Very warm hearted host, with an amazing home.  The light rail is only a few blocks from the house and definitely the most affordable and practical way to get around.

Highly suggest this location.

Thanks again Leslie

Matt"
392140,47849393,2015-09-21,43222701,Vidal,"This was my first time using AirBnB, and Leslie was a fantastic host.  She contacted me the day I was supposed to arrive to make sure I hadn't had any problems on the way.  Her house is easy to find and has a great view of the water and the downtown area.  The room is very comfy -- the Cal-King bed provides a great night's rest and there is plenty of room to lounge and just relax.  
The house is only one block away from the bus that takes you downtown and only a few more blocks to the Lite rail.  There are plenty of restaurants close by as well as a supermarket if you feel like cooking.  
Leslie was a pleasure to talk with and made me feel right at home.  All in all, I had a great time and would definitely recommend staying at the Tinhouse!!    "
392140,48544478,2015-09-27,207266,Mary,"Great place 
Fantastic view
Quiet"
392140,49184096,2015-10-01,1553498,Anshuman,"This was my first time using Airbnb and Leslie was a warm and great host. Her place is clean and nice with amazing views and a very comfortable king bed in a cozy room. Leslie was very helpful in giving information on Light rail transit and local restaurants and her kitchen is equally convenient for fixing a quick meal. All in all I enjoyed the place and would highly recommend her place.
"
392140,49574549,2015-10-04,41719965,Sara,"This is a delightful place to stay. I recommend it strongly to anyone who looks for a super clean, comfortable room with an amazing view and an amazing host. The relation price/quality is excellent. The house is near the Light Rail and it is very easy to go downtown. 
Leslie is very friendly, warm and welcoming. She was extremely helpful with us. "
392140,49794886,2015-10-06,13746241,Naomi,"Leslie was a perfect host, and told us about all the great places in the area. Her place is unique, beautiful, and comfortable, and it's in a great area for transit. A lovely stay!"
392140,50388787,2015-10-11,27835705,Timmer,"They say ""Don't judge a book by its cover.""  I arrived late and was surprised by the appearance of the property.  Being tired, I had not fully paid attention to the hosts direction so I looked disappointed from the street at the appearance.  BUT once I got the instructions to head up the side stairwell, it was completely magical.  The view is awesome.  The inside flat was simply homey.  Christo and I had a lovely night out nearby in the Beacon Hill area enjoying the restaurant recommendation from our host.  We returned and relaxed after a long day.  Leslie joined us for a delightful conversation.  She is one smart cookie!  She treated us to one of the best cheeses I've had in my life as we shared some lovely wine.  Our time was really enjoyable, and she was truly a great host."
392140,51568262,2015-10-21,6110297,Ryan,"The Tin House was a unique, comfortable, and very nice place to stay while I vacationed in Seattle. The location is convenient to the bus, light train, and nearby bakeries and coffee shops. Extremely comfortable bedroom with a large sized bed, quiet, and everything was very clean. Leslie always made me feel welcome and right at home! And the view is amazing! I would definitely stay at the Tin House again, if I ever revisit Seattle."
392140,55939177,2015-12-07,47044283,Carol,Leslie and her home were lovely and very welcoming.  Great location and a comfortable room.
6823781,35988053,2015-06-23,15607994,Gina,"Great space in a great part of the city. Only stayed two nights, but would have been comfortable here for a long stay. The space has everything you need, gets lots of great light and is very quiet. "
6823781,36609653,2015-06-29,35652150,Monica,"Apartment was great and just as described.  Host was very welcoming upon our check-in and then left us to explore.  The extra touches left in the apartment were a plus (pillows, blankets and chocolates). The neighborhood eateries are wonderful and the trip to downtown Seattle a quick ride away.  "
6823781,37598478,2015-07-08,3272307,Marek,"This apartment was wonderful. It's in a quiet, nice neighborhood and is well-equipped with everything we needed. Thanks for the hospitality, Lisa!"
6823781,38168622,2015-07-13,236083,Aviv,"Lisa was a wonderful host. Check in was easy, check out was smooth.  We had a wonderful stay her private apartment.  Perfectly located for easy access to Fremont and Ballard, we really enjoyed our trip to Seattle."
6823781,38438629,2015-07-15,34079173,Colleen,The apartment was great and exactly as described. Great neighborhood! 
6823781,38631977,2015-07-17,36644378,Katelyn,"Nice,  clean, safe neighborhood,  and affordable for a short visit.  Basement apartment below Lisa's house with its own entrance and spacious. Very short commute to center city."
6823781,39192154,2015-07-21,8119368,Lisa,"Cute, clean apartment! It looked exactly like the photos.  I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to friends."
6823781,39682821,2015-07-25,1446861,Ryan,"Lisa was a lovely host. Traffic delayed our arrival, and she was more than accommodating.  We were house-hunting in Seattle, and her place was a perfect basecamp for running around the city. "
6823781,40116755,2015-07-28,36212493,Jenn,This private apartment was perfect for my small family.  We were on a family vacation and needed something close to the city but quite enough to relax after our long days of exploring.  Lisa was welcoming and then left us to our privacy.  Check in and out where smooth and we would definitely would stay again.
6823781,40625868,2015-08-01,11226499,Alison,"The apartment is on a quiet street near a couple of very interesting neighbourhoods, and is also near bus lines going into downtown Seattle.  My friends and I found it to be a good home base for a short trip."
6823781,41097893,2015-08-04,36166886,Lawrence,"Located in a quiet residential neighborhood with ample parking in the street. Apartment was very clean, open, and well lighted. It was bright and pleasant and very comfortable. Sleeping was very comfortable. Fresh nice towels and linen were (website hidden) area was nicely appointed if you wanted to prepare meals. 

The host was responsive to questions by email and text. 

We enjoyed our stay and would stay here again if we are in the area. "
6823781,41437223,2015-08-07,18146637,Travis,"The apartment was fantastic, exactly as described. A much larger space than I was expecting. With a comfy r table bed and nice living room. Lisa was extremely nice and helpful. Loved the neighborhood. Can't uldnt recommend this highly enough."
6823781,41967093,2015-08-10,13791342,Gretchen,Very well represented by photos and descriptions. Quiet neighborhood & convenient location. Clean & well kept despite basement feeling entrance.
6823781,42593566,2015-08-14,8737028,Will,"Lisa's apartment worked out perfectly for me on a trip to Seattle for work. I was attending a conference at the Convention Center downtown and, while Lisa's apartment is not within easy walking distance, there are several buses that can get to within a few blocks of the Convention Center or the apartment easily and efficiently. The apartment and neighborhood are quiet and homey after a busy day downtown.

There are a number of good places to eat near the apartment as well. The apartment has a full kitchen, but I only used the coffeemaker to brew up some excellent coffee from Seattle Coffee Works near Pike Place market. Just a note, the one thing fairly standard thing I did not see in the kitchen was a microwave oven.

Wifi worked well and my cell phone reception was good, so it is easy to communicate while staying at the apartment. Lisa and I communicated mostly by text, but she did show me around the apartment when I arrived. She seems to be pretty available upstairs in the main house, if needed.

All in all, I thought this apartment was a very good value and I would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle."
6823781,42935139,2015-08-16,12373874,Christopher,"A great location from which to explore greater Seattle. This basement unit provided us with everything that we needed, with notable privacy and cleanliness."
6823781,43628735,2015-08-21,7656201,Adam,Lisa was very accommodating and very responsive throughout the process. Her place is fantastic and the pictures are very accurate. The place has everything anyone would need!
6823781,44141828,2015-08-24,15689446,Bassel,"The neighborhood is extremely quiet and just minutes from downtown. The ADU was warm, inviting and accessed pretty easily by going through Lisa's yard.

Lisa is responsive and was kind enough to text me a few hours before our arrival notifying us that she's running a bit late. It's the little things that count.

The unit was spotless and if you're going through Seattle, I'd recommend the apartment again."
6823781,44434581,2015-08-26,33147532,Julia,"Lisa was a great host and responded quickly to any questions I had. The space is in a great location, easy to walk to both Ballard and Fremont. The apartment is very well decorated, has lots of light and comfortable to relax in. Great place to stay."
6823781,44911224,2015-08-30,36299023,Amber,"The apartment had everything we needed, was clean and comfortable, homely and private. We also appreciated flexibility around arrival time."
6823781,45267512,2015-09-01,38028682,Marjorie,Stayed a weekend in Seattle for my boyfriend's birthday and felt right at home here after spending all day exploring the city. Extremely clean and comfortable. She even had coffee in our kitchen for us! So convenient from downtown as well. Couldn't have asked for a better stay for our first time in Seattle.
6823781,47982084,2015-09-22,19593945,Brian,Our experience staying at Lisa's house was great.  Our train to Seattle was delayed by 4 hours which put us in town at 1AM.  Lisa gave clear instructions how to access the unit and get settled in.  There was an issue with accessing Wi-Fi which Lisa addressed promptly.  
6823781,49788104,2015-10-06,41772839,Jerry,"Lisa was very helpful, and went above and beyond to help us have a good stay. (Including picking up flowers for our stay!) The location was great, with bus stops and shops within walking distance. 

The room itself was very clean and attractively furnished. However, the main bed sagged a bit in the middle, and the sofa made a great place to sit, but it was a bit too hard and small when converted to a second bed. Overall we had a great experience, and it's a good place to explore Fremont."
6823781,49997632,2015-10-08,9604776,Tim,Loved the funky neighborhood and Lisa made checking in and out easy. 
6823781,50664987,2015-10-13,3525876,Jesse,"Lisa's place was very spacious, and in a perfect quiet neighborhood that was only a mile from the best of Ballard AND Freemont. Easily the best location possible, and super convenient if you rent a car to see some wilderness outside the city and need a place that's friendly to park it. She was even great at quickly sending us some items we forgetfully left behind!"
6823781,52084814,2015-10-26,6972441,Jennifer & Kevin,"A nice, clean and comfortable apartment in a good location. It's on a quiet street with easy parking available. Also,  it is very easy to bike to locations in Fremont or Ballard from the apartment."
6823781,52859719,2015-11-02,27220620,Dan,"Delightfully quiet neighborhood, this was exactly what I was looking for! Breweries within blocks, green lake and the zoo a few streets away, and an uber within 5 minutes to go downtown.

The place itself was quiet, secluded, and neat. I couldn't have asked for a simpler stay, and Lisa was perfect in communicating everything I needed to know! Would definitely stay at again, and wished my time in Seattle was longer!"
6823781,54286645,2015-11-17,13933918,Mike,Lisa's place was awesome and the perfect place to crash after a day of exploring Seattle. Very chill neighborhood and parking was a breeze. Check in / out was super easy and the apartment was very clean and in tune with its description. Would definitely recommend staying here. 
6823781,55252427,2015-11-29,11495472,Kathe,"The listing matched the reality.  Nice, clean, cozy basement apartment in a quiet neighborhood.  Parking on the street was always available (which is important in Seattle).  We were close to major streets without having to be stuck in traffic.  It was just right for what we needed.  We even managed to prepare a Thanksgiving meal for our daughter in the kitchen.  

We didn't meet our host in person, but she was always available via text and responded to us right away.  Very nice!"
7018009,39839916,2015-07-26,10606604,Ryan,"Great place to stay, plenty of room, and great communication during our stay when we had questions. "
7018009,41476252,2015-08-07,1830185,Mark,"The neighborhood is peaceful and quiet while still being well-situated to the University and the Seattle core.
The host was extremely well-organized in his anticipation of our visit, giving us exactly the information we needed without bogging us down in detail.
It was the perfect landing pad for our needs, since we landed late at Sea-Tac and had to leave promptly in the morning.  A very no-nonsense landing pad for through-travelers."
7018009,42720250,2015-08-15,38492867,Robin,"Jim did an amazing job making us feel welcomed and was exceptional in his outreach and communication! The neighborhood  was wonderful and the location could not have been better for my group! Also, the house was just as described and seen in the photos (except maybe even better!) There is a real charm and warmth in this home and it is easy to see how much the place is loved and taken care of. Any guest staying here will feel the same way."
7018009,43301640,2015-08-18,40551951,Jennifer,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the house. It is a beautiful home and was very comfortable for our 6 family members. There were flowers and a welcoming gift on the counter.  There was also important information to help orient us to the neighborhood written on the chalkboard. We had a little trouble with the wifi connection initially, but Jim and his house manager were very easy to work with and the problem was solved quickly and effectively. Initially, we had scheduled to rent the home for 2 nights and then decided about a week before our trip to see if we could add one more night. Jim was quick to respond and we were able to easily make the changes to our reservation. The house was everything it said it was and we are glad we chose to rent it. If we are ever visiting Seattle again we will definitely check it's availability. "
7018009,46188406,2015-09-08,41408296,Michael,"Four friends and I stayed a week here and enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. The host, Jim, has a great, conveniently-located home in a quiet neighborhood that accommodated us very well, with ample bed/couch space. With two vehicles, we did have to worry about street parking a bit (the garage was occupied during our stay); however, this minor inconvenience hardly detracted from our overall pleasant stay and is mentioned only for those who might consider bringing multiple vehicles. 
We would absolutely stay again. "
7018009,46778878,2015-09-13,42334307,Brian,"I cannot say enough positive things about our host Jim.  He was accommodating and welcoming since our first interaction via email.  Rarely do you find individuals this genuine.

His communication was quick and the house was clean, orderly, & exactly as described.  It's a beautiful cozy spot, period.

I will definitely recommend his house to family and close friends.  When the next overnight trip to Seattle comes up I will email Jim without hesitation."
7018009,49361070,2015-10-03,42024284,Sara,"My family of 5 lived here for a week while we moved to Seattle from across the country.  Jim was very welcoming and provided lots of details to help us get acclimated.  The twin beds are downstairs and the two bedrooms with larger beds are upstairs.  The location was really convenient to access shops, a park and the freeway."
8341720,50941529,2015-10-16,42989599,Xiao,"Trang and VB are very nice, excellent communications. They live upstairs but answer text messages and emails really quickly if I need something. Trang gave me a lot of recommendations of where and how to go around the city. I stayed for a month, the room, kitchen and well-sized bathroom were clean, the apartment was well-organized with cute decorations, other guests that stayed over at the other room were respectful. I get to use the amenities of the apartment. The location is very convenient, close to buses, supermarkets and local restaurants. I would highly recommend this place for my friends and other Airbnb guests."
8341720,53140925,2015-11-05,47323964,Rocío,"El piso está muy bien, es tal como en las fotos. El sofá es comodísimo y la cocina muy práctica. El baño también genial. En el piso hay de todo: toallas, secador de pelo, champú y pasta de dientes, lavadora y secadora, TV... 

Trang fue muy amable desde el principio, llegué muy tarde por el horario de mi vuelo y porque tuve problemas para llegar desde el aeropuerto y fue muy flexible.

Al llegar me dio todo tipo de indicaciones sobre el barrio y la casa y se mostró disponible a ayudarme en lo que necesitara.

Totalmente recomendable para alguien que necesite sentirse como en casa nada más llegar. :)"
8341720,55953817,2015-12-07,49040602,Chris,My trip to Seattle was awesome!  Trang was a great host.  She responded to texts promptly and kept me updated with any changes during my stay.  The location of the apartment is also within walking distance or a short 5-10 minute bus ride away from a lot of great places to visit.  I would definitely recommend Trang and her apartment for anyone that is going to Seattle.
4550099,23350930,2014-11-29,14661085,Shauna,"Mike and Laura really made our Thanksgiving special as they opened up their home to our family on such short notice over a holiday that could've been a disaster. Their kitchen is wonderful and spacious enough to prepare dinner for 10 or more.  
       They are very gracious and easy to work with I highly recommend their place as it is located in a perfect spot to explore Seattle without even having a car. The view on the deck upstairs is breathtaking.  Located near the bus line as well.
        Highly recommend."
4550099,24481439,2014-12-29,24020678,Jason,"Mike and Laura were incredibly gracious hosts, having a welcome gift and kind note waiting for us upon our arrival. Their home was very well kept, spacious, and aligned perfectly with their description. It was within walking distance to the great amenities that Ballard has to offer.  Mike and Laura made themselves available via phone/text for any issues we may have had (which we didn't!), but were otherwise respectful of the time our family had together. Their space afforded my family a wonderful holiday experience. Highly recommended. "
4550099,33251679,2015-05-26,14811879,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed our stay at Mike and Laura's home. Well-stocked kitchen and comfortable rooms. Ballard is a great location for visiting many areas of Seattle, especially while visiting SPU. "
279063,855883,2012-01-10,742661,Shai,"The host was nice and the apartment was fine.  No lock on the bedroom door.  The bathroom is shared but pretty clean.  The host was a little chatty for me, but a nice guy.  There is a very sweet dog as well."
279063,1459566,2012-06-11,2449385,Iris,"""Cc""'s place is pleasant, clean, equipped with most necessities, and the owner is constantly trying to improve it. There's a beautiful view from the balcony and the neighborhood is quite lovely. It's really close to the 15th Ave shops/restaurants/supermarkets, which is nice. The host is amiable and his dog, Lucky, is friendly (although,she may be a bit frightened of you at first). Oh, and contrary to a previous review, there is an interior lock on the bedroom door.

Overall, I had a good stay."
279063,1481499,2012-06-14,2507243,Pan,"The host is very nice, kind, and warm-hearted. He helped me carry luggages. This aparmtent is very clean and confortable as well. The discription and picture that people see on the website is very accurate and real. Overall, its a good place to live in, and the price is also resonable! "
279063,1509398,2012-06-18,2503005,Wren,"The host was very accommodating and my room was clean.  The apartment was nice and quiet with an amazing view.  I recommend this as a simple, safe, and ideally located place to stay.  Trader Joes, great taverns, restaurants, and coffee and bakery shops are all within a short walk."
279063,1545208,2012-06-23,1489755,Don,"The apartment is small.  The room has just enough space for a queen-size futon and a desk.  The owner is building computers so there is no place to sit in the living room.  If the weather is warm, then there is a good couch on the deck.  Calen is a good person, and tries to be helpful.  He has a small dog which, in my personal opinion, is much too friendly and is always underfoot.  He likes to beg food, which annoys me.  In summary, I think it's major advantage is simply location, but it is not a good space to relax and enjoy yourself.  I would recommend it as a place for backpackers.
"
279063,1562692,2012-06-25,2661773,Hernan,"CC is a great guy very approachable, friendly, and the place is well located and clean. will stay there again."
279063,1615547,2012-07-02,2693558,Brian,"I stayed with Cc Powell in Seattle and highly recommend him as a host.  The accommodation is in a hip, central area of Seattle, Capitol Hill, and there is plenty of space in the apartment.  The bed was comfortable, and Cc was a gracious and responsible host.  He does have a friendly dog in the apartment, which could be a consideration if you don't like pets."
279063,1651176,2012-07-07,2050536,Kolbe,"Cc was very nice and accommodating. The location is phenomenal, the place was clean, his dog is adorable, and the view is indeed stunning. 

There was plenty of space in the fridge for me to stash some food and I had no problem finding the pans and utensils to cook & eat it!"
279063,1859188,2012-08-01,2097940,Tanya,"The apartment is a great base for exploring Seattle - close to a groovy neighbourhood - Capitol Hill - there are heaps of bars and eateries to keep you busy. A 20 to 30 minute stroll or a quick bus ride will get you to Seattle''s Pike Place Market! 

The room isn't huge, but it is all you need for a holiday. There is space to unpack your stuff and a place to rest your head. There is a balcony with great sunset views of the city and the Space Needle. There is a kitchen available for use if you need to have a night in.

Host is polite and always trying to improve his apartment. "
279063,1888761,2012-08-04,2895557,Steven,"Had a good stay here. The location of this place is just right. Quiet street but just a couple blocks from everything. It's a simple, spartan apartment. Not overly decorated. A bachelor pad but much cleaner. The host was great-- kind of a serious, smart jock.  We only chatted for a few minutes, but i wish we'd grabbed a beer or something. Seemed like a cool guy. Also, his dog was really cute. And the bed was comfortable. I slept like a baby. Would definitely book this one again."
279063,2005409,2012-08-16,3157832,James,"Great location in Capitol Hill, 2-3 blocks from bus line. Great view of city skyline. Comfortable bed."
279063,2021795,2012-08-18,3078370,Melissa,My daughter and her boyfriend stayed with CC and they were very pleased.  They loved the location and especially loved the puppy!
279063,2056930,2012-08-21,802977,Matthew,Calen and Lucky where excellent hosts!!  The place was in a wonderful location and very nice.  Calen offered plenty of advice as to what to see and where to go.  I would gladly stay with Calen again.
279063,2082412,2012-08-24,3001431,Megan,"Calen is a gracious and charming host, very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is super clean and comfortable and the dog is well behaved. "
279063,2094202,2012-08-25,3211677,Sally,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Calen and my first airbnb experience.  He was super accommodating and the apartment is just like the pictures.  It was great to come back into a comfty, cozy, and freshly laundered smelling bed after a long day of running around.  Lucky the dog is the sweetest thing, so she was definitely a bonus!  The proximity of the apartment to cafes, bars, restaurants, downtown, tourist spots, etc. was perfect and parking was relatively painless.  I would most definitely recommend Calen for anyone who is looking for a home away from home during their travels."
279063,2112941,2012-08-27,693774,Shawn,"Calen was very accommodating.  He had no problem letting us checking early.  His dog Lucky is awsome!  Great neighborhood location in Capital Hill.  Only a 5-15 minute walk to almost anything in this fun and eclectic neighborhood. 

Thanks Calen!"

279063,2191661,2012-09-04,2800915,Michelle,"CC was a great host. He gave me tips about the bus system, and the place is within walking distance to major bus lines. The 8 will take you to the Space Needle, and the 43 and 49 will take you towards downtown. I was encouraged to feel at home, and I was. Yes, the dog will bark at you when you first arrive because she is scared, but once CC comes home, she will calm down. Lucky can be very affectionate once she is calm. The biggest test is this: Would I stay there again? Yes. Great location, enough space for my stuff, good internet connection, space in the fridge, and I could come and go as I pleased as long as I respected the house rules (like being quiet when he's asleep). If you're going to have a busy vacation and all you need is a place to sleep and shower, then this is the place for you."
279063,2254085,2012-09-10,1971556,Nushin,Calen's place is super clean and comfortable.  He was very accommodating and you can't beat his location!
279063,2286700,2012-09-14,3341927,Janelle,"CC was a cool host, & his dog, Lucky, was so sweet.  Lucky was there first before I met CC. She barks alot to my partner & me, but I saw her treat bag in kitchen. I decided to give her half a piece (then my sweetie gave other half), then she was calm & loved our attention.  The location is awesome - good shops & eats nearby. The bed was comfy & shower was good. Cool view of Space Needle & the city.  I didn't realized the location was third floor of the bldg - so after a long day of walking, we gave a little more 'umph' to our legs to upstairs. Good workout tho. Aside stairs, it's a comfy place to relax, sleep & shower. "
279063,2361441,2012-09-21,351107,Šimonko,"Cc is  a good host and we had opportunities to talk while I was there. He is very respectful of your private space and you are made to feel very welcome and at home. The apartment is a a great area of Seattle and it is very easy to get around to see all the major attractions the city has to offer. The room is clean, well decorated and has lots of storage space. The view from the balcony is great. Lucky, his dog is great when he is around, but is much more nervous when he is not there and initially she did bark quite a bit - understandable really as I was a stranger to her. However, she does warm to you soon enough and will always look to you for attention. Overall a good place to stay with good hosts!
"
279063,2421999,2012-09-26,1358786,Justin,Calen was a great host and did not hesitate to answer any questions that we had and even provided us with some tips on places to see. The property was in a nice neighborhood and very centrally located. Highly recommend to anyone staying in the Seattle area. 
279063,2487222,2012-10-02,3491654,Laura,"My kids enjoyed their stay with CC,  The room was nice and the location was central.  They were on the move pretty much from the get go and didn't do much more than sleep and recharge at CC'(website hidden) was helpful with all  inquiries they did have.  They also enjoyed Lucky !
Thanks CC"
279063,2513773,2012-10-05,2755622,Pablo,"My sister and I were in town from Portland, Oregon for a big concert at the Key Arena. This listing was very appealing because of the cost and location. We were really excited about being there because its in the heart of Capitol Hill just walking distance to all the local shops and bars. Calen is great! He  was very trustworthy and accommodating to our needs. His home is very nice and well equipped. He has a lovely balcony with a beautiful view of the city and the space needle. The guest room was well furnished with a comfortable bed, closet, and desk. Parking however is really crazy around that part of town. We had to station the car a few blocks away from his home but were commuting by bus and by foot so it wasn't a big deal for us.

Sadly, his dog ""Lucky"" wasn't as gracious of a host. When we first arrived Lucky was there to give us a very hostile greeting. We were rather scared  with the possibility of her biting us. He assured us that she wouldn't but we were skeptical. When Calen is around she is well behaved but as soon as he's out or in a different room Lucky has a bit of memory loss and gets territorial all over again. At that point we would  distract her with a treat and close the door of the room where she would sleep. She then would proceed to bark... endlessly. Aside from the cranky canine, our stay was good. I would recommend this place for sure if you're willing to dodge the dog. LOL!"
279063,2632189,2012-10-16,3568743,Dean,CC was a great host - very helpful and personable.
279063,2682862,2012-10-22,2327395,Tisha,"This place was extremely clean and had everything to make this a very comfortable stay - heating, internet and a full kitchen. Calen was extremely accommodating and his dog is a sweetheart. Very convenient location to Seattle University and downtown Seattle. I was very glad I found this apartment. "
279063,2712731,2012-10-24,619805,Stefan,"Cc is a nice guy, as is his dog, Lucy. I only stayed one night, but wish I could have stayed longer, and during a warmer period of the year, to make use of the barbecue and the nice view from the terrace. I loved the very comfortable bed, I slept like a baby.
Unfortunately, the heating didn't work flawlessly. The apartment is not insulated and it was very cold. When Cc and I both ran the electronic heaters in our bedrooms, the fuse blew. I'm pretty sure that Cc will resolve this problem shortly, he is committed to make his place perfect for hosting guests."
279063,3021975,2012-12-03,4275471,Ben,CC was a great host. I stayed with him for a weekend via a last minute reservation. Even though the timing wasn't good for him he made it work. The room was comfortable with a space heater that i truly was thankful for. The Apartment was beautiful and you cant find a better location! Also its worth noting the host was very inviting and engaging. Basically you have a great person with a great place and i highly recommend staying with CC!
279063,3080297,2012-12-12,3269127,Andy,"""pretty laid back and drama-free"" describes Cc well! I enjoyed my stay—the room is comfy. Thanks!"
279063,3318575,2013-01-09,2937770,Michelle,"The room was very clean with great closet space, a desk, and night stand. The bathroom was also very clean with ample towels as well as shampoo, condition, and soap. 
The rest of the apartment was very nice as well, with usuable kitchen space and a television. I also loved the location!"
279063,3449867,2013-01-31,4870671,Jaime,"Hey everyone!  I stayed with Calen for a few nights so I could check out CapHill while in Seattle (I lived in Belltown for 9 months).  He and Lucky were SUCH great hosts!  Very easy going, friendly and helpful (not to mention a clean room/house with lots of amenities).  Lucky is truly a sweetheart as well.  I stayed there on my own as a single woman and felt completely safe and comfortable... very hard to find.  I would definitely recommend this place not only for the incredible location, but also for the great host!
-jaime"
279063,3526484,2013-02-12,1511749,Mike,"Host was very accommodating. Room is as described and spot on with the photos. The space it self is not as updated, but a top floor unit with nice views! Easy street parking available. His dog is a sweetheart after warming up to you. I highly recommend only checking in when the owner is home, so that the dog is friendly from the get go. This place is in the perfect location for checking out restaurant and bars in Capitol Hill area of Seattle. Overall another great experience via airbnb. "
279063,3563923,2013-02-17,380693,Amelia,"The location of the apartment is great. It's right on Capitol Hill, a short walk to all the fun bars, restaurants, and shopping. Downtown is about a 20 minute walk away.  The room is very cozy and the apartment has excellent views of downtown from the living room.   "
279063,3588050,2013-02-19,4132978,Bo,Nice place. Great location smack dab in the middle of Cap Hill. Especially nice if you are a dog lover.
279063,3641541,2013-02-26,2304128,Serena,I needed a nice homey place for my Son to stay while meeting with prespective employers and looking at apartments. This was a very comfortable place. It worked out perfect for our needs and we got it for a steal at the last minute.
279063,3664614,2013-03-01,4666312,Dan,"I had a great stay in colin's place. The room was very comfortable, and his balcony had a fantastic view. It was fun to chat with Colin about energy politics, diets, and biking around Seattle. All in all a pleasant experience. "
279063,3692543,2013-03-04,5193903,Jason,Had a great stay. Everything was nice and clean. Friendly dog. Would stay there again.
279063,4002911,2013-04-02,3794701,James,"Calen was an exceptional host! I stayed at his place for two weeks, and he and his dog, Lucky, were very accommodating! The room was exactly as described, the bed was sleep-inducing comfy and the view of downtown and the Olympics were breathtaking. Lucky was cautious of me when I arrived the first evening, but after that she grew onto me! More often than not, she would greet me enthusiastically whenever I returned home. If you're a dog lover, you'll definitely get along with her!

Overall, the Airbnb experience at Calen's place is perfect. I could not have asked for more. Calen respected my privacy and he was always there in case I needed help with something. Thank you Calen for the stay!"
279063,4500732,2013-05-08,3179473,Emlyn,"This was a great AirBnB experience -- great company, beautiful view, ease of organisation and very comfortable digs. I'll definitely be staying here again when I come through Seattle. "
279063,4520992,2013-05-10,111564,Hyun A,"Calen was such an awesome host. He is super approachable and friendly and has this amazingly cute dog named Lucky. The view from his balcony is sweet especially when we went - for once, the sun was out in Seattle! "
279063,4558862,2013-05-12,4903492,Mervi,"Great place to feel home and explore in the heart of Capitol Hill! I stayed two nights and would have wanted to stay many more. Extremely well located, walking distance to so many cafes and bars and restaurants yet very peaceful 'microenvironment' :) Lucky was sweet even though she was a bit nervous but I'm sure with even one day longer we would have became the best friends. The apartment is not maybe the tidiest but with a lot of home feeling, at least that makes up a lot for me! Highly recommended!"
279063,4668239,2013-05-19,1434720,Jim,"I stayed for 5 nights in Calen's apartment - it was a great base to explore Seattle from. We only briefly met during check-in as Calen works during the day. Lucky the dog kept a low profile and spent most of the time asleep when I was at home, but he seemed sweet :) Thanks again, I loved Seattle and hope to return someday."
279063,4740001,2013-05-22,6472236,Julie,Great place. Great location. Great host. Great value.
279063,4766216,2013-05-24,6472236,Julie,"Great location, great value, great host.  Calen is a super nice guy, extremely helpful, and seems to genuinely enjoy hosting his guests.  He totally has a heart of hospitality.  "
279063,4958969,2013-06-03,6675596,Michael,"I was in Seattle for a capoeira event and I needed a place to stay in a pinch. Calen quickly responded to my request and made me feel welcome. The room was clean and ready for guests, and he even provided some tourism literature for newbies like me. Between Calen's (and his dog Lucky's) friendly and welcoming nature, and the apartment's proximity to the shops, bars, and restaurants of Capital Hill, I highly recommend this BnB."
279063,5012357,2013-06-07,5259098,David,"Good location, helpful host, and a nice dog."
279063,5030924,2013-06-08,6727850,Meimei,"Cc is ideally a great host--if you communicate with him well and be prepared for his doggie. My best friend certainly was unprepared for Lucky since most doggies love her very (website hidden) let us have access to the room earlier (thanks, because my girl friend is flying from the east and want a good daytime nap) and told us about the doggie who will be locked in his room (appreciated). My friend was upset because Lucky was barking even in CC's room and she could not sleep (she freaked out actually). I guess it is my fault to have not communicated WELL with either Cc or my friend.  What I can say is CC is very helpful and considerate, but you have to LISTEN and be PREPARED for any concern he may want to share with you!"
279063,5043824,2013-06-09,6557307,Emily,Caden was a great host! Very hassle free experience. Would definitely recommend!

279063,5107926,2013-06-12,6713765,Thomas,"Calen is a great host and a good fellow. Lucky the dog is super friendly, part of the team, and no hassle. Great views from apartment.  And it is very quiet at night. Up and coming edgy bars and eating not far. I would definitely stay again."
279063,5292678,2013-06-23,6007485,Ludovica,"My friend and I had a fantastic AirBnB experience!
The room is large and comfortable and the whole apartment is tidy and clean, with a fantastic view from the balcony. We were in Seattle for a conference at the convention centre, which is at 30 min walk away (just a little tiring to go home because of the hill :) )
Calen was a great host, very friendly and helpful, and Lucky is such a lovely dog, very friendly and absolutely not annoying.
We would definitely recommend this place!"
279063,5438151,2013-06-30,2395113,Kyle,"Excellent place to stay -- nice host, clean room in great location, and plenty of supplies for people looking to explore Seattle.  I especially appreciated the guides to the city that were left in the guest room as well as the flexibility that this host offered in check-in and check-out.   This is my first time using AirBnB and I don't think I will be going back to conventional hotels any time soon!  "

Pleasant to speak with, even briefly as he was up and gone before I arose. Also, Lucky is the best!!! Would stay again if I need a place to stay in town for a night!"
279063,5867534,2013-07-20,326735,George,"Great location only 5 minute walk to either Broadway or 15th Ave. Easy access to downtown.  Street parking is limited due to zoning restrictions, so best to walk or use public transportation. "
279063,5972861,2013-07-24,3170082,Randy,"Easy to find....great location.  Parking a bit of a challenge (it is Seattle, right?), but findable.  Calen was friendly and communicative.  Lucky (Calen's dog was nice, although he never really warmed up to us.  Comfortable bed."
279063,6032783,2013-07-27,4782630,Jo,"Cc has a great spot here with fantastic views over Seattle, he arranged for me to get the key even though he couldn't be there and we only met up once because of timings. The apartment is just 3 blocks from Broadway which has great coffee shops, restaurants, and a terrific store and quite a trendy vibe. It is also only 3 blocks along his street to the 43 bus which takes you all the way downtown. It is a little bit of a 'lad's pad' but the bed was one of the comfiest I had slept in and there was plenty of room in the closet the room also had a desk and chair.  I was very comfy there and loved the balcony with the sofa. Definitely a good place to stay.  "
279063,6062292,2013-07-28,7659934,Jason,"Great stay. Was in town for the night after a business trip and couldn't have asked for a better place. Centrally located, easy to get around and a beautiful (website hidden) was the perfect host and more then accommodating. Will definitely be staying there again!"
279063,6071488,2013-07-29,981362,John,"Perfect spot if you want to to slumber away from the bustle of downtown, but still be in a cool neighborhood that's got it all.  Very tidy, comfy, modern apt, great view and decently accessible to bus routes, or even a good long walk to downtown (though coming back you might want to bus because the uphill can be daunting after a long day).  Our host was most helpful and accommodating :)"
279063,6178796,2013-08-02,2944539,Harold,My worst airbnb experience so far! The dog was so annoying. And the room is small with constant noise during the night! 
279063,6206956,2013-08-03,7682285,Cara,It was a pleasure to meet Cc and stay in his lovely apartment. He made us feel very much at home and the bed was very comfy. Great neighborhood too!
279063,6437233,2013-08-12,1474908,Jamie,Calen was a wonderfully accommodating host.  We got in later than expected and he was super flexible and made the coordination very easy.  The location was great and very central to all of the things we were looking to do during our time in Seattle.  I would definitely stay there again.

279063,6764470,2013-08-24,2457255,Caodan,"I stayed with Calen for two nights during the week, so he was working for the most part. We only saw each other a couple of times, but made sure my stay was very comfortable. The location is great, and I couldn't have asked for more!"

"
279063,7173091,2013-09-09,1378512,Robyn,The overall experience was great.  The apartment was clean and organized and Calen was very nice and laid back.  He knows the city very well and was able to answer any questions I had from using public transportation to suggesting solid resturants/bars.  I would definitely stay here again if I end up visiting Seattle in the future. 
279063,7321252,2013-09-15,8800692,Alex,Cc was a great host. Despite our late arrival Cc organized a way for me and my guest to get into the apartment with ease. The apartment was clean and tidy. It was only a 5 to 10 min walk to the main strip in Capital Hill which was incredibly convenient. Check out was equally simple. A great experience and a definite recommendation.
279063,7513253,2013-09-23,8055938,Robert,"Cc Powell was the ideal host. Told me what I needed to know when I arrived, and although I was gone most of the time as was he, he was helpful if I needed any tips about the area. His place is ideally located in Capital Hill, has a great view of downtown, and the room had a comfortable bed and closet, desk and chair. The shower had good water pressure, and his dog Lucky is very sweet and friendly. I wish I had more time with his dog, as I am a dog lover and am currently canine challenged.  He also has a full kitchen and smoker BBQ if you like that sort of thing. Highly recommend his place/ he is quiet and respectful of your privacy."
279063,7702740,2013-09-30,6913245,Melanie,"This was my first trip to Seattle and the stay here was ideal.  The location was perfect-close enough to easily venture into the city, but far enough to avoid its trappings.  The view is absolutely gorgeous!  The neighborhood itself is within walking distance of some great Seattle landmarks and neighborhoods and Calen, besides offering up some fantastic suggestions of what to do around town, was a gracious and accommodating host.

279063,8118339,2013-10-16,8934898,Giuseppe,so just few things about that place. nice area and good position in the city. balcony perfect for smoking outside but...acid smell of dog in the all apartment and toilette full of dog furs....well ..clean for me is a different concept...!!!! and the dog not so friendly..
279063,8163511,2013-10-18,9411383,Shelby,"I had a magical time in Seattle and I owe a large part of the positivity of my stay to my airbnb host. The apartment was beautiful, the view was outta this world. I had my own private getaway. My first airbnb experience couldn't have gone any better. "
279063,8389441,2013-10-28,9270569,Peter,"The apartment was in a great location. Super walkable. And our host was easy to get ahold of, with plenty of great recommendations. The master bedroom was rented out as well, which we didn't expect, but it didn't end up being a big deal.

279063,8455630,2013-10-31,7368434,Joel,Great spot in Seattle nice and quiet but with in walking distance of some great bars and restaurants. Has a cracking view from the balcony great to watch the sun set

279063,8700958,2013-11-12,1017964,Stephanie,"Calen has a wonderful clean place with a very sweet, friendly dog. Great neighborhood with some cool stores along 15th Ave, which was a short walk away. Highly recommended going to Bakery Nouveau if you decide to stay with Calen. The twice baked almond croissant was delicious.
It was a great location for a jump off point to see all Seattle has to offer; just a 20 min bus ride to downtown or the Space Needle. Overall it was a great stay. Thanks for hosting me!"
279063,8863933,2013-11-22,10036384,John,Tyler had an excellent experience staying there. I'm certain he would highly recommend anyone staying there.

279063,9340232,2013-12-22,449544,David,"Great flat - well maintained, sweet view, convenient location -- and very helpful host. Highly recommended! "
279063,9360833,2013-12-23,1391342,Wenbin,"The neighborhood is perfect and close to the downtown, you can find good eats and drinks here. The balcony has a stunning view with much of the downtown view, and a perfect place to enjoy the breeze. Calen is nice and helpful, we did enjoy the trip and the stay here."
279063,9390725,2013-12-25,15710,Michael,"I booked last minute and had an awesome stay. The location is great, I walked right out the door to explore Capitol Hill.

Also, Calen (the host) was great! He even let me leave a bag for a week and pick it up when I got back.

I'd definitely stay here again, highly recommend!"
279063,9416393,2013-12-27,118951,Steve,"Calen is a great host. He is very responsive and helpful, even though he wasn't there during my stay he managed to make everything work remotely. The room is clean and nice. The location is awesome. However, as other airbnb'ers suggested, it'd be nice to be informed there're other airbnb guests, especially of opposite sex, in the house during my stay, to avoid unnecessary awkwardness. "
279063,9525774,2014-01-01,10368911,Grace,The apartment was great and we enjoyed our stay. There was a bit of confusion when we arrived because the host wasn't at home but he was very responsive when contacted. We weren't aware that there were other guests but it wasn't that much of a problem. The only con is that it is a bit far from the downtown.
279063,9616711,2014-01-03,10641314,Alex,"Calen was great, very communicative and accommodating with a lovely apartment in a great neighborhood!"
279063,9693976,2014-01-05,449544,David,Great flat! Stunning view of the Olympic mountains (when it's sunny out). Very good value for money. 
279063,9881745,2014-01-16,5290426,Ryan,"Cc was a great host.  He was very accommodating and I felt, unlike other hosts I have stayed with, that his place was mine.  After traveling as much as I have, it was comforting to know that Cc was there to answer and attend to any questions I had.  If/when I stay in the Seattle area, I would definitely stay at Cc's place again.  "
279063,10140246,2014-02-02,10934297,Pablo,"CC's place is great, it's walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill and has a great view. During the time I got to meet him he and Lucky were very friendly. I definitely recommend his place to anyone visiting Seattle."
279063,10169889,2014-02-03,9899195,Tommy,"Nice stay abeit brief.  Great access to capitol hill and room was cozy, smelled very pleasant, easy check-in.  Would stay again."

279063,10438386,2014-02-18,4274504,David,"Easy to find and nice spot that is easy walk for food etc. Was a one night visit, but a good one! Did not get to meet Lucky, maybe next time.."
279063,10487816,2014-02-21,12196572,Mary,"Calen was an excellent host. He is very polite, and accommodating. I loved staying in his condo, which is centrally located, with easy access to public (email hidden)ere are tons of restaurants, stores, and parks in walking distance. The view from his balcony is beautiful and exactly what you want to see when visiting this gorgeous city. If this is your first time to Seattle or your 100th, I definitely recommend staying here!"
279063,10562451,2014-02-24,8259027,Nicole,"We were looking for an affordable location on Capitol Hill. 
This fit the bill! Beautiful, clear view of the Space Needle.  The apartment was clean and well-appointed.  Comfortable bed and large towels that smelled incredibly fresh! The portable fan was extremely helpful in controlling the (website hidden) recommended Lost Lake for breakfast but we were able to get in earlier next door at the Oddfellows Cafe and it was a great experience! Only a 20 minute walk down to Pike Place market and the Sunday farmers market on Capitol Hill was awesome!

Parking can be a bit tricky but as long as you are patient and willing to walk a bit we were always able to find something within four blocks.

We never met Cc but communication was fairly easy.  Our only concern was that we did not know that another guest was staying in the apartment with us. We would have liked to have known that information ahead of time and we also would have known to be much quieter in the morning! Apologies to the other guest!"
279063,10717017,2014-03-04,11274799,Brian,"Calen was a great host! He was flexible with out arrival time and suggested a bunch of great things to do around town. Other than that, he pretty much left us alone, which was perfectly fine. He was also quick to help us solve a small problem that came up during our stay"
279063,10872491,2014-03-10,902768,Karen,"Calen was sooo accommodating. I lost my reservation to another place, and he was able to offer me a room last minute, no problem. He was super helpful, and his place was comfortable.

I would totally recommend him for anyone visiting the city traveling by foot.  It is a hike, but sooo beautiful, with plenty to do in the area.

Thanks!!!"
279063,11081139,2014-03-19,12391013,Javier,"Stayed for 6 days at CC's, and had an awesome time! Really good location, beautiful view, and comfortable bed and room. Highly recommended!"

In short: Highly recommend this place, it's a deal in a wonderful neighborhood"
279063,11584944,2014-04-08,11807079,Sum Kei Stephanie,"I'm so enjoyable while staying in Calen place,it is so convenience with great location,i have have no difficulty to find the location in my first arrived and during my stay. Walking to the downtown it takes 25mins only,and its close to the metro station,and walking to the broadways just takes 3mins,and there have lots of restaurant and groceries store too.
The house is clean,the bed is so comfortable,and i like the most is the balcony!it really got the stunning view!!The kitchen is well equipped that i like to cook in here too!
Calen is a great host even he is not staying in the house during my stay,but he always have a quick response when i got questions!
I would definitely stay here again and i would like recommend Calen's place to everyone who is planing to have a trip in Seattle!"
279063,11631257,2014-04-09,9983123,Oliver,"I can't say much about Calen himself, as I did not meet him in person. But everything worked out perfectly and and Calen responded very quickly on messages. The place itself is very conveniently located in a very nice neighborhood. Only when you have a car, it is a bit tricky to find a parking spot. But that seems to be a general problem in Seattle... The apartment is nice with a truly awesome view over the city. I would go here again the next time I'm in the city!"
279063,11654396,2014-04-10,978851,Tana,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience! I had about 3 hours to find a place, and found myself starting to panic. I messaged Calen and he got back to me in what seemed like seconds. He was very communicative and direct. He met me at his place and within minutes I felt like I had been there for days.  Another guest had just left so he hurried around and got my room picked up and fresh sheets on the bed. It was clean and in an excellent location! I'm regretting having a hotel for the first part of my stay and wish  I would have found this place sooner. Her gets a 5 out of 5 from me!"
279063,11726018,2014-04-13,2663774,Veronika,"We stayed in Calen's apartment where he rents out two rooms. Check in was smooth and Calen was at the apartment when we arrived and gave us information about he local area. He also contacted us during our stay to ask how things were going. The apartment is well located in the Capitol Hill area which is home to the more alternative Seattle scene. There are lots of restaurants, bars and things to do nearby. Despite this the area is also very quiet. The apartment itself has a nice view. We had a full run of the house and noticed that it could benefit from a clean and a tidy up. Our bed had clean sheets but there were areas in the room and apartment that had a build up of dust. That being said the room was very inexpensive and Calen was a proactive host. "
279063,11918576,2014-04-19,2738872,Alex,Awesome pad and Cc is a laid-back gent!  
279063,12142255,2014-04-23,14208562,Ariel,"We were looking for a place to stay last minute- not only did Calen respond promptly, he was extremely accommodating. His place was spacious and comfortable, and the location was perfect. "
279063,12229721,2014-04-26,13823298,Gopal,The room was just right for a quiet stay in Seattle for a couple of nights. Calen was accommodating and helpful.
279063,12292809,2014-04-28,1778883,Jon,"We had a great time exploring Seattle from Calen's place in Capitol Hill! The apartment was in a great location between Broadway and 15th, both streets having plentiful dining & drinking selection, it is also a short walk to Volunteer Park, a great place to go for a stroll in the morning. Our room was plenty comfortable for Hannah, myself and our best buddy Trooper (our dog), and Calen has a cozy balcony off the living room which gets great afternoon sun and has amazing views of downtown Seattle and the snow capped peaks of the Olympic National Park. Calen was very responsive to questions and readily available with suggests of things to do in the area. Highly recommended for your next trip to Seattle!"
279063,12433395,2014-05-02,6262889,Esther,Was in town for work and wanted a place to stay in fun neighborhood. Great location on Capital Hill. Awesome view of the city from the deck. Calen was very hospitable and checked in on me to make sure I was comfortable. Would consider rebooking next time in town.
279063,12964649,2014-05-15,15358551,Kaede,"Stay was comfortable, cozy, and welcoming. The location is great and was close to everything, within 5-25min driving radius. Got the feel for what its like in Seattle for sure! Best zoo and art museum ever btw! Otherwise, just be careful driving in Seattle in the residential area--we broke our bumper on the car from some of the driveways in the blocks within. They are steeper than they look... we also hit some bars/clubs as per Calen's recommendations and they were so fun and spot on for what vibe we were looking for. There's a comfortable patio w couch, nice relaxing living room, kitchen, plenty of towels and basic amenities! Great overall stay 8.5/10. Fantastic deal for the price!"
279063,12994272,2014-05-16,8302875,Frank,"The place was nice and a good value, and Calen was a friendly and helpful host. Would stay again in need. "
279063,13019285,2014-05-17,9606453,Elva,"The apartment is in a convenient location to the bus station can take you to UW and downtown very easily.  Calen was very helpful and instant for giving us the direction of everything we had question.  One problem was that broken internet. We couldn't get in from both wifi and wire. If this problem got fixed, this apartment would be a good choice for Air bnbers!"
279063,13058681,2014-05-18,107954,Kara,I needed a last minute place to stay on my trip to Seattle and Colin came to the rescue with an awesome place to stay. I was able to easily navigate from SeaTac to his place via public transport with a little bit of guidance. I appreciated all the travel resources he keeps at the kitchen table and I was able to make tourist plans on the fly. Would love to stay again if I ever return to Seattle.
279063,13203455,2014-05-21,11675569,Megan,"Calen had a lovely house, very clean with a gorgeous view! We would definitely stay again!"

279063,13552278,2014-05-30,15544772,Andy,Capitol Hill was a great central location to the neighborhoods I visited. I have never walked so much. Room was quiet and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again in Capitol Hill.
279063,13765091,2014-06-03,13790301,Andrew,"Calen is a magnificent host. He was friendly, attentive to my needs, eager to offer suggestions and maps of the city and surrounding area, and provided a comfortable and clean space to come back to. The bed was cozy, the projector with Roku box was a great touch, and I enjoyed relaxing on his front balcony overlooking the skyline and space needle. I highly recommend staying at his central guest room! Thanks Calen!"
279063,13996215,2014-06-09,11625144,Ana And Paul,Calen was very nice and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. He even went out and bought an iron so that we could iron our clothes for a wedding we were attending! The location of the apartment is fantastic. Close to everything. Super cute neighborhood. I would definitely recommend it. 
279063,14382958,2014-06-17,2959974,Andreas,"Calen's place was wonderful - a nice apartment in an awesome neighborhood. He basically saved our lives with a super last-minute booking, as we hadn't planned to stay in Seattle for that night - but it was definitely worth it! I would definitely stay here again!"
279063,14457676,2014-06-19,8146719,Rei,"I booked this apartment almost in last minute, and Calen confirmed my request very quickly. The place is spacious and cool, and located in the fabulous area of Seattle. Also I met a nice roommate, we hung out together to explore the cool bars and restaurants in the neighborhood. It was such a good time! "
279063,14641808,2014-06-23,16347817,Christina,"Cc was an amazing host! We were nervous seeing as how it was our first airbnb experience but Cc made us feel right at home. His place was spotless. Everything we needed, he had for us in our room. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our lunch on his boulcany looking out to downtown."
279063,14981972,2014-06-30,15577066,Nicholas,"Stay there for a week. I like to say Calen is an excellent host, friendly and communicating well. The place has a fab view over Seattle, easy access to broadway. Highly recommended!"
279063,15192770,2014-07-04,15011333,Leah,"Highly recommend this apartment. Calen is an extremely friendly and responsive host. The location is great as well. Easy walk to downtown for sightseeing, but also a nice neighborhood feel with restaurants and shops nearby. His deck has a relaxing sofa with views of the mountains. His dog Lucky is super sweet as well!"
279063,15403641,2014-07-08,7164863,Alan,"It was great staying here - awesome location. Calen was helpful - he sent a map with parking options beforehand, key info, and was responsive when I had questions after I showed up.  Thanks!  "
279063,15479739,2014-07-09,17157373,Jingya,"Caleb's place has a good location and beautiful view. He is a super nice person who is patient to my questions and flexible to my schedule. It is really a wonderful experience, though it is only one-night stay there. He is very professional on hosting, and prepares well to welcome you. Wish everyone have awesome experiences there!"
279063,15640883,2014-07-13,7198119,Daniele,"Communication and reliability of Colen are perfect.
The apartment is in a great location to live the Capitol Hill area and visit downtown and waterfront"
279063,15735424,2014-07-14,17898642,Emilie,"Calen is well set up and organized to receive guests. I liked that there was a key box in case our schedules didn't match up so I could check in or check out at my convenience. The location was a short walk away from some really great restaurants and shops, and the neighbourhood seemed friendly and safe. Since it was so hot while I was in Seattle, I took advantage of the balcony and enjoyed the beautiful view and neighbourhood. "
279063,15769674,2014-07-15,16441955,Blanche,Calen was very responsive and answered all questions we had. The apartment is in a fantastic neighborhood and has great views of the city - especially from the balcony ! The room/bathroom were set up much like a hotel. Lots of reading material regarding the city in the room and plenty of towels in the bathroom.
279063,16100632,2014-07-22,8187178,Alice,"Calen was very quick at response, very accommodating about the arrival and departure time. The place is clean and convenient.

Plus side is the location, walkable to Broadway and you can walk to downtown in about 25 min, parking is relatively easy for Capital Hill. Bed is comfortable. Balcony does have a great view, and it is a great place to chill and have a beer.

However, it is shared bathroom, so beware of morning bathroom traffic jam. Laundry mat is couple blocks away.

Overall it is a great place for a great price to stay in Seattle.

279063,16488728,2014-07-28,16508052,Lukasz,"The room, flat, neighbourhood and the Airbnb experience were great. The flat is very welcoming, spacious, well-cared and indeed has a balcony with an scenic view. The room definitely suits its purpose - has a comfortable bed, desk and decent floor space. Although I didn't use them, the flat seems to have great cooking amenities. Throughout the process, before arrival, Calen was very responsive and keen to assist with anything that might require attention, so big kudos for that. Can definitely recommend it for a few days stay in Seattle."
279063,17279224,2014-08-10,10730782,Carmiel,"I booked this for 8 days for a coworker named Angel--I did not stay here myself. Angel said the place was great and had a beautiful view. He was there by himself most of the time, and the one night there was another guest, Angel didn't hear a peep. At one point Angel misplaced his keys late at night and Caleb was very responsive. Great place to stay!"

The neighborhood was very nice and was close to the things we wanted to see and do. We had a lovely walk to Volunteer Park. It's also walkable to the waterfront and other more touristy stuff (maybe 30-40 minutes) and easy to take the bus, too. There were grocery stores and restaurants about 3 blocks away. The apartment itself was clean and stylish, and the bed was very comfortable. Calen left bottled water for us, and he had many tour books and brochures in the apartment for his guests to use. Check in and check out was easy and flexible. It was an excellent experience. I would recommend Calen's place to others."

He was gracious and gave us a great rundown of the area!  Parking is a little tough arriving as late as we did, but he helped us gain an understanding of parking areas in the neighborhood!  Gave some recommendations for eats late at night too!  He really made us feel welcome in his home - very pleasant stay for us road weary folks!"

279063,20129415,2014-09-23,21564060,Po,"Clean, great location and great terrace.

279063,20357279,2014-09-28,19294609,Ryan,"Had a great stay at Calen's place. The bed was very comfortable and his place was very cozy as well. I didn't get to meet him personally but he was very quick to respond to my emails and was very helpful. I would recommend staying at his place!

It's about a 12min drive to Pike's Place Market so the location was great. Parking can be a bit difficult around the neighborhood but I didn't have to much trouble finding a spot each night."
279063,20479709,2014-09-29,2301071,Sasha,"Calen's place is lovely and it's in an AWESOME location! He did a great job building furniture that fits the space perfectly. The room is neat and clean, and even included guidebooks for exploring Seattle. Getting there was easy and his directions for getting inside were perfect. The only nitpicky thing I would suggest is letting guests know who they'll be sharing the apartment with, if it's not Calen himself. We didn't run into any problems, but knowing we had a housemate ahead of time would've been nice.

Calen himself is extremely friendly and helpful. We met up for coffee and had a long, interesting conversation. 

I'd be happy to stay here again."
279063,20593788,2014-10-01,6035413,Ahmed,well described and as presented on pictures. Calen's place is an excellent base to discover Seattle and above all very convenient. we had to look for last minute accomodation due to late change in our program but thanks to automatic answer from Callen this was made possible in good conditions. this is a nice two bedroom apartment where both rooms are for rent. but still the apartment feels very lively and we immediately felt like home with all you may need. there is nice view and walking distance from either animated Broadway (all sorts of shops) and 15th avenue (more local atmosphere). to reach downtown you can easily catch buses from Broadway or 15th Av. we met with Calen in the morning which is always nice to meet in person.
279063,20804111,2014-10-05,9493075,Charlotte,Calen was quick to email me with all the information I needed. The apartment is in a great location in Capital Hill as we were able to quickly walk to great restaurants and coffee shops. The only disappointment was the dirty bathroom. I was glad we were only staying there for the night before we flew out as I wouldn't have wanted to shower and get ready there. 
279063,20889897,2014-10-06,18205942,Adriana,"Calen was so quick with communication and was there to greet me and show me the place. My stay was a short one, but pleasant. "
279063,21223964,2014-10-13,1378763,Michael,"Calen stopped by to make sure we had everything we needed.  Hi place is very well located to everything.  He even had a yoga mat and we went to Core Power twice during our stay.
"
279063,21641219,2014-10-20,626478,Bob,This is a great place to stay in Seattle. A cozy & comfy bed plus a great location....with views of the skyline & space needle to boot. 
279063,21734028,2014-10-22,3252631,Fletcher,Awesome! 
279063,21816850,2014-10-24,3252631,Fletcher,"I didn't get to meet Calen, but his place is great! Awesome view and great location. "
279063,22276317,2014-11-02,7246098,Laura,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend. Great location, easy and quick communication with Calen. Just wish the bathroom had been cleaned prior to our visit. My boyfriend spent time cleaning the tub before use."
279063,22413254,2014-11-05,8571993,Justin,"Calen was a great host. Although i did not see him much throughout my stay, he was gracious and very accommodating. Would be happy to stay at his place next time im in the area."
279063,22608488,2014-11-10,10929438,Eddie,"Calen was such a great host!!!  He welcomed us to his place with his lovely dog, and gave us very clear directions from the airport to his place.  He made our stay very comfortable, and we would stay with him again when we are back in Seattle!
(Also, from his place, public transportation is easily accessible which was also a plus too!)"
279063,22728305,2014-11-12,16448528,Katherine,"Well-equipped apartment with a host who clearly has this room-rental thing very well thought out. No complaints. Location is good, 15-minute walk away from Pike/Pine Corridor. Would stay here again when I come back to Seattle."
279063,22817813,2014-11-15,16221024,Vahe,Great place to stay.clean and in the center of the city.would be happy to be back again.
279063,22975739,2014-11-18,366791,Viviana,"I needed a place real quick, so it was awesome to have a very fast response from Calen. The place has a great location, and if you're in downtown a taxi is really not expensive. The room was cold, so be prepared. Is not the most luxurious place but it works for the price. "
279063,23028296,2014-11-20,764481,Andrew,Calen's place was perfect for my stay in Seattle. I was sad to leave such a nice spot. Any traveler should consider him/herself quite lucky to find such an affordable and well-located place.
279063,23234759,2014-11-25,18420379,Rowan,"Calen is a very responsive host. His instructions were straightforward and we slept very comfortably in his guest room. It's a good value, though not entirely spic-and-span. "
279063,23297142,2014-11-28,116143,Richard,"Calen was a fantastic host! The apartment is clean, comfortable and inviting. It is ideally situated for exploring all parts of Seattle. I definitely would consider staying here again. "
279063,23856869,2014-12-12,3241946,David,Great experience. Easy and comfortable.
279063,23909579,2014-12-14,23320035,Aemar,Great place! Great location and has a great view of downtown Seattle. I recommend for someone that wants to be centrally located and near the bars and restaurants of Capitol hill. I had a blasts thanks!
279063,23986819,2014-12-15,1717692,"Wayne,Sonnie","description was accurate,although we did not expect another guest to be in another room.We never met Calen and we did not know if someone lived there full time or not.I felt the cleaning fee was undeserved as it was not all that clean.He forgot to leave the key so we were left to our own devices until he returned from watching a game somewhere.After reading other reviews,we must have booked on a bad day for him."
279063,24129843,2014-12-20,1377028,Kelly,"Great accommodation for a last minute booking, and everything else. I was stuck in seattle and tried to book friday at 9pm. Calen responded promptly and I was on my way to an excellent spot in close walking distance to all the great things Capitol hill has to offer. He let me borrow an umbrella the next day because it was raining, and that was a great help. There was a heater in the room, a comfortable bed, and the location was excellent. What else do you need?"
279063,24485392,2014-12-29,15377220,Cecilia,"I had a great time in Calen's place. The room was warm and comfortable. The kitchen has almost everything you need, which is fantastic if you like to cook your own food. The sound box in living room is perfect for me to play my music. Calen was responsive to our problems and gave useful answers. "
279063,24607357,2014-12-31,23569347,Daphney,"I had such a great first experience with Airbnb thanks to Calen. He was excellent. Super flexible with check in/check out time, super nice and welcoming. His place was also super welcoming, with maps of the city and brochures for things to do. The view was amazing in the mornings as the sun was coming up. The whole experience was great. I would recommend Calens place to anyone who asked."
279063,24977344,2015-01-04,7631578,Katya,"Calen was a great host - he's the kind of thoughtful, fun host that Airbnb was made for. Checkin and checkout were very easy thanks to his thorough instructions. He even had bottled water, every public transport map, shampoo and soap, and a hair dryer available for guests.  His apartment is on a quiet block in a great neighborhood, sandwiched between popular Broadway Avenue and 15th Street. And that view!! I couldn't get enough of the Olympic Mountains, the Space Needle, and the downtown skyline. I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to others without hesitation."
279063,25210044,2015-01-09,18979279,Nigel,"Thanks very much Calen. I love your lovely apt. This is my first airbnb experience, and it is so wonderful. If I come to Seattle again, I would definitely continue to stay at your place. Thank you so much. The only pity is I do not see your lovely dog, cause I am also a dog lover. Would u send me a pic of you and Lucky???"
279063,25359676,2015-01-13,9862374,Tian,"Calen did a very good hosting. He is very responsive and tries to accomodate every request. Checkin process is smooth. The apartment is very clean, and has all the equipments. wifi is fast."
279063,25394060,2015-01-14,4176873,Lauren,"Great, comfy space. I had some troubles renting a car so I had to uber it here and it was super easy for the über driver to find. It's is a great central location with only a two block walk to Broadway st. Loved it. "
279063,25489587,2015-01-17,26160873,Vicky,"After originally staying at another airbnb listing to soon find out the water heater broke (no heat or no hot water), my friend and I quickly switched to Calen, who was awesome enough to accommodate us last minute. He was super quick at replying and when we met him at the apartment he was laid back, helpful and answered any questions we had. The apartment is located in the capitol hill area, which is a very hip neighborhood filled with cafes and bars alike. It’s only a 10 min drive to downtown tops. Although most of the parking on the street was restricted (7am - 6pm, 2 hours max), finding parking wasn’t too much of an issue, some nights you might spend a couple more minutes looking. Now onto the apartment itself, it was cozy/warm and looked exactly like the pictures posted; however, it could have been dusted down/cleaner, but that’s coming from an ocd neat freak. In addition, kitchen was communal and the space needle could be seen from the balcony, which also had a grill. The apartment has two rooms side by side and one restroom to be shared. At the time my friend and I were staying in one room, the other room was rented out to another guest. Calen mentioned that he would stay there usually if one of the rooms were vacant. Over all, my friend and I enjoyed the convenience of the location and slept like babies; therefore, we can’t complain.  "
279063,25570974,2015-01-19,15575110,Irays,"Calen was prompt to respond to any questions we had and was very helpful. We had no trouble checking-in or checking-out. The view was great, just as in the pictures. Everything was in walking distance, but also easy to get a taxi. Definitely a great location to stay in! Calen was a great host.  His apartment had everything we may have need, even maps, which was great. "
279063,25733110,2015-01-24,26478800,Rahul,"The neighborhood is great and the host did a great job keeping the room clean. There was a towel, shampoo, and fresh sheets. Also he was very prompt in replying and he was professional. "
279063,25783055,2015-01-25,24904399,Pei,"Overall, it is a good experience. Quite and located in a convenient area."
279063,25894412,2015-01-28,26242611,Eric,Great guy. Really understanding. Place is awesome as well
279063,25966905,2015-01-31,832082,Stephanie,"Calen was a wonderful host. He was friendly, responsive, accommodating, and very helpful with advice and info about the city. The apartment is in the ideal location if you want to get a sense of the neighborhood feel of Seattle. I was a single female traveling alone and felt completely safe. I was about a mile walking distance from everywhere I wanted to go. The apartment is at the top of a hill so you have to factor that in, but it is an easy bus or inexpensive Uber/Lyft ride if you don't feel like making the hike. Overall, my experience was excellent and I would definitely stay with Calen again. "
279063,26092343,2015-02-02,26416845,Isaac,"The room was big and the bed was comfortable. The whole apartment was clean and had the all the amenities you could hope for. The neighborhood is fun, lots of stuff in walking distance. Calen was very professional and pleasant when I met him. Would very much recommend this place"
279063,26123913,2015-02-03,2874219,Sarah,Quick response and great view !
279063,26173047,2015-02-05,6068054,Chris,"Calen was friendly and responsive. We had a pleasant stay at his apartment. He was able to accommodate our desired check-in time, and check-out was simple. The room was clean. We liked the view from the kitchen table. We also enjoyed the other guests we met during our short stay: a young couple traveling the west coast and someone looking at graduate schools in the area. The location was great for walking around Capitol Hill. The street parking nearby is limited to 2 hours during the day and unrestricted at night. I found unrestricted day parking in the area of 19th and Republican, which is about seven blocks away. Perhaps there is some unrestricted day parking closer than that. In hindsight, I should have asked Calen for advice on that. "
279063,26322556,2015-02-09,26187267,Kelly,Calen was a great host. The apartment was very tidy and cozy. Great location in capital hill. It's easy to take public transpiration from the airport and it's easy to walk downtown and to the market.
279063,26460807,2015-02-13,7877671,Ricardo,"Calen was a great host! He was very accommodating for my check-in and was always keeping me informed about new guests checking into the other room. Though I didn't get to spend too much time in the apartment, it was clean, quiet and spacious - just what I needed! 

A great location, especially if you want to get the most of the city. You can walk anywhere and take Uber/Lyft without much of a hassle or money anywhere.

Definitely recommend this!"
279063,26569979,2015-02-15,18163314,Billy,"Calen was great! I was in town for the night, the room was nice, clean, and he even left me a couple water bottles to hydrate. Life saver! "
279063,26762660,2015-02-18,23372681,Shannon,"The place was better than described. The view, oh my God that view of downtown was unimaginable. Just gorgeous, don't ask questions, just see for yourself. The house amenities are just as described, with the projector featuring Netflix being my favorite. Calen himself was very informative of the area of Seattle as he answered all my questions in detail without sighing in disbelief that a human could possess so many questions. He was very accommodating and easy to contact in case I needed anything. I would definitely stay with him again."
279063,27067103,2015-02-24,27329081,Wilfred,"Calen was an excellent host. His space was my first time using Airbnb, and it was a joy. He was very kind and helpful with the area and with my needs. He made sure that there was bottles of water, fresh towels, everything was clean, etc. when I arrived. This place is in a great location; It is close to downtown and many other shops but isn't loud at night.

Calen himself, and the place definitely made my Seattle trip very enjoyable. No problems at all."
279063,27136928,2015-02-26,17851350,Dom,Great place. Calen is a standup guy and I couldn't have asked for a better host.

279063,27865216,2015-03-13,13997096,Robert,"Great neighboorhood, ended up being just a couple blocks from where my friends wanted to meet in the city. The apartment was nice, and no real issues since my stay was so short. Calen was very responsive via message and checked in frequently to make sure all was going well. No complaints."
279063,27969433,2015-03-15,6253641,Alex,"Everything as described. Calen's place was simply awesome. Although I didn't get to meet him as I was exploring the city all day, he was very responsive and half way through the day when I emailed him to ask for any suggestions he got back to me extremely quickly with some options of what else I can do in the city.  "

Calen's place was well equipped with the essentials.  Getting into and out of the house was easy, and the internet was very fast - great for checking some last minute work emails and looking on Yelp for goodies in the hood.  I would definitely recommend staying here if you are looking for an affordable, easy place to rest your head.

Thanks, Calen!"
279063,28427776,2015-03-23,29027874,Moises,"Honest rate for a convenient, clean and comfortable room.  The host is very friendly, helpful and proactive.  It worths the money"
279063,28614311,2015-03-27,28473732,Cedric,"Calen was very welcoming, and even gave me a ride to the grocery store. The place is very well located in the capitol hill, perfect if you want to go for a run to volunteer park, or hang out on pine and pike street or broadway."
279063,28812967,2015-03-30,116143,Richard,"This was my second stay at Calen's place and once again he provided a clean, comfortable and inviting home while visiting Seattle. Calen is fantastic host. The apartment is ideally located for exploring the city. I would definitely recommend staying here."

We had a lovely comfortable stay and the room was nice and clean. We really appreciated the leaflets Calen left out for guests to look at. The apartment is a good base to explore Seattle however it is a taxi ride/30 minute stroll into the city centre. Thank you for letting us stay with you! "

279063,35214891,2015-06-16,31476928,Mike,"Calen's place was great. The space was cozy and the bed was very comfortable. It's located in a cute neighborhood with lots of bars, restaurants and coffee shops nearby. It's not incredibly close to the main tourist attractions, so expect a ~30 minute walk downtown. If you're from the Midwest, like my girlfriend and I, the hills are a bit of a challenge. 

We had the chance to meet Calen and he was a great guy. Incredibly helpful and very organized. We had no issue finding the place or getting in. "
279063,35670331,2015-06-21,32837905,Jim,"Calen's apartment is well located in a safe, pleasant and quiet neighborhood - long blocks of interesting houses and shady sidewalks.  Three blocks away in both directions are hip bustling streets with lots of cafes and shops.  The 3rd floor view looks out over all that with downtown and mountains in the distance - beautiful.
Whenever I stay anywhere one of my main concerns is having enough pillows, as I need more support around my body to get good sleep.  Calen delivered all the way - the pillows along with the firm mattress...I only wish I could sleep that well at home. 
He has most everything around in the kitchen and bathroom to make your stay comfortable and generously shares anything you want from bottled water to food in the refrigerator.
There were a couple of other guests in the other room during my stay, so unfortunately I never got to meet Calen in person, but he was communicative about everything I needed to know, including key instructions, and pretty much left me alone to enjoy the space."
279063,36069664,2015-06-24,33500132,Jenny,Very good staying here. Quiet and convenient. Have really good view. Will come back again.
279063,36471107,2015-06-28,8537356,Eric,Calen was responsive and helpful before and during my stay.  My trip to Seattle was made easier and more enjoyable because of it.
279063,36842406,2015-07-01,36742510,Manuel,"Though I never got to see Calen, he made sure everything was great. I enjoyed staying at his place, and the location was perfect! Thanks a lot!"
279063,37083994,2015-07-04,7332152,William,"Our stay with Calen was excellent. Very composed host and communicative. He has air conditioning in the unit, which seems like a luxury in Seattle, that helped keep things cool during the hot July weekend. Everything was in order, though we had a little trouble getting our keys together (had to swap with the other tenants while they were on the way out). His place is nicely located, with a beautiful view, as advertised. We had no problems with any amenities, and the fridge was great for holding some drinks which needed to stay cool. Definitely worth a look if you're in Seattle!"
279063,37437399,2015-07-06,1149464,Lacy,"Although we didn't get to meet Calen, he was a fantastic communicator regarding directions, suggestions, and photos of his place. He responded quickly to our requests and questions. "
279063,37542086,2015-07-07,5155735,Will,"Really nice house - comfy bed and a simple, nice room. Would have been nice to have AC in the room (considering the listing says AC and is for the room specifically), given how hot it was, but the AC in the living room worked in a pinch after a bit. Easy to find, and a nice location. If I had a few more days it would have made a nice simple place for a homebase."
279063,37697779,2015-07-09,23820944,Collin,Great place in the heart of Capitol Hill. Calen was very communicative with directions as well as any suggestions of activities in the area.
279063,38016382,2015-07-12,8547499,Traci,Calen was an excellent host. He communicated well and was accommodating to our schedules as well as guests that were checking out before and after us. His place is in a really great spot and we enjoyed the view from the balcony most mornings we were there. We also liked having access to a kitchen to prepare a few meals. The room was nice and clean. We took advantage of some of the Seattle maps and walking guides he had around the apartment - which were convenient. I would recommend.
279063,38196911,2015-07-13,18696142,Chiwide,"We didn't spend too much time at Calen's place, but everything was as described. When we first got to the apartment, the sheets weren't changed yet from the prior occupant, but Calen got clean sheets for us a short while later. Thanks for everything!"
279063,38333339,2015-07-14,30423270,Dan,"Clean space and easy to get into even though Calen wasn't available when we arrived. The shower didn't have supplies for us, but otherwise we couldn't have asked for anything else. Good location close to a lot of great Seattle places."
279063,38518345,2015-07-16,2649005,Mickey,"The location is great, right between the action on Broadway and 15th Ave E.  Calen is very welcoming and makes himself available at all times via email and/or text.  The bedroom we had was very comfortable. The bed was excellent. There are some things of which guests should be aware: Calen did not appear to live in the apartment, he is not around to provide any guidance on the apartment, neighborhood, or Seattle in general. Thus you do not get to know or gain insight from a local resident.  Unfortunately, he rents both bedrooms and the place is too small for 4 guests (two in each bedroom with one bathroom).  During our first visit the other guests who had arrived before us monopolized the entire place (kitchen and living room) and in effect we were relegated to our bedroom.  The kitchen can only hold one person at a time.  During our second visit, the other guests were very considerate and friendly which made the stay much more pleasant.  In general, the apartment was functional but could use a good cleaning.  The patio/balcony was not very functional because it was cluttered with junk and the living room was also cluttered with things that should have been stored elsewhere.  "
279063,38674795,2015-07-17,38388696,Brad,"Although we didn't meet Calen, everything was prepared and laid out as he said it would be. Much appreciated! Great view from the deck with a lounging couch. Only a 8-10 buck cab ride to Seattle Center, as well as a few great restraunts 2 blocks up the hill. Great location! "
279063,38952500,2015-07-19,492445,Elena,"Calen was easy to communicate with and a great guy, and the place was in a convenient location at the center of Capitol Hill. The bed is comfortable and the room has everything you would need for a good stay. This isn't a fancy hotel experience- it feels like you are staying with a friend. We showed up and then Calen arrived to clean the place for us and chatted with us, offering suggestions. One thing to note is that there may be another Airbnb guest staying in the other bedroom."
279063,39188090,2015-07-21,2649005,Mickey,See earlier review
279063,39342999,2015-07-22,38390191,Min,Good communication by text & stay was comfortable. Good location. Would recommend.  
279063,39557136,2015-07-24,38522279,Saul,"The apartment is well located, and seemed well equipped. My main issue was that I was unaware that this was a shared space, and there was another couple staying in the apartment. There is also only 1 bathroom, so that there can be a wait, especially if there are 2 people in the other room.  The apartment is on the 2nd floor, with no elevator, which can be a problem if you have a heavy bag.
Calen was a good host and communicated well."
279063,41238070,2015-08-05,16292357,Erin,"Calen was great! He gave us excellent recommendations, and the space was perfect. The location was wonderful, too! Close to tons of cafes and shopping. Definitely consider staying here if you make a trip to Seattle, though I warn you--parking is ROUGH (this is all over the city, not just in Calen's neighborhood), so if you can get by without a car, do it!"
279063,41766214,2015-08-09,2828958,David,Great experience! Calen was friendly and helpful. 
279063,42168389,2015-08-11,16833650,John,"Calen was very responsive via text even though we weren't able to meet. The room was nice and clean and the balcony has a nice view of the city skyline. The neighborhood is excellent; there is so much to do within walking distance. There is currently some construction work nearby but I never noticed any noise while I was in the house. Parking could be challenging at times but I never had to park more than two blocks away. Overall, my stay was very pleasant and I would be happy to stay here again."
279063,42301059,2015-08-12,20069427,Martin,"The apartment is well located. There is significant  construction in the next building. The bedding is comfortable; there is a ventilator in the room. The space needs some cleaning up, especially the balcony that is quite cluttered with objects and dead plants. Calen was very responsive prior to my arrival but he did not manifest himself during my one night stay."
279063,42502016,2015-08-13,27151563,Daniel,"Great stay, I recommend staying in Calen's apartment. Very good location just a few blocks away from Capitol Hill trendy bars and restaurants. Calen is very nice and easy going."
279063,42913075,2015-08-16,39202021,Edwin,Calen was an excellent host who made sure that I had a great time. He has extremely comfortable living space set up with a superb soundsystem. It also comes with Roku that offers a lot of different movies and dramas. The balcony is beautiful. I was able to view an amazing view of the city. 
279063,43297100,2015-08-18,39985703,Sarah,地理位置比较好，房间卫生间比较干净。
279063,43728889,2015-08-21,38923553,Gal,"Calen is a great guy, who has perfect location apartment, clean and very nice bedroom. Would definitely recommend for single or couple travelers.
Caleb is super communicative and helped me with everything. The best thing though is the location."
279063,44219789,2015-08-24,6009212,Justin,"Galen's place was awesome. Near a lot of bars (Witness; Liberty; Sun Liquors), restaurants (Single Shot, Coastal Kitchen), Pronto station, etc. I walked everywhere. The setup and private room (with key!) worked perfectly. Calen was welcoming and nice. There was one other person rooming next to me, but he didn't leave his room much so I had the place to myself when needed. "
279063,44950859,2015-08-30,18352803,Andre,"Calen was amazingly accommodating as I partied my way through Seattle.  His place is super comfy, reasonably priced and located in the coolest part of town.

The room I stayed in had tons of storage and the bed was pretty large and comfortable.  The bathroom was very clean and well stocked.  

If you're going to be in Seattle, this is where you want to stay!"
279063,45207445,2015-08-31,7727712,Philip And Caoimhe,"Our stay at Calen's was restful and casual. He sent us all of the info about the apartment in advance by email. That way, we were able to get the keys and leave our luggage even though he wasn't there. The bedroom was comfortable, and we were told to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen. Calen responded very quickly to our inquiries both beforehand and when we arrived at the apartment, which was extremely helpful for the stressful situation that brought us to Seattle. He was also very flexible about our check-in and check-out. We enjoyed the outdoor patio very much. There are comfy cushions and blankets everywhere. The location is also great for accessing Capitol Hill and bus routes. Thanks, Calen!"
279063,45451500,2015-09-02,41498040,Melissa,Calen's place is like a hotel away from home. He was very helpful when we arrived and the rooms were extremely clean. He also had plenty of towels in the bathroom even more than a hotel which was appreciated! Thanks so much Calen!
279063,45642089,2015-09-04,35480938,Michael,"Calen is very nice and his place couldn't be more conveniently located.  It's a quick walk to several streets full of restaurants, bars and businesses.  We rented 1 of 2 rooms in the apartment and there was a shared bathroom.

Pros:
-Convenient location
-Nice view
-Keyed lock on the bedroom door
-Calen's dog is rad

Cons:
-Apartment was a bit dirty
-Calen seemed a bit hectic

This listing is apparently very busy and constantly booked.  I could tell the bathroom hadn't had a deep clean in quite some time but had been wiped down.  For as much traffic as it sees, a professional cleaning person twice a month would make a huge difference and pay for itself.

Also, there was a bit of a booking overlap.  Checkout time was 2 pm but at 10:30 am there was a knock on the door from the next tenant.  There were 2 sets of keys and apparently they were promised ours.  Check in time is apparently 11 am, which is fine, if the other party is getting the 2nd set of keys.  We weren't fully dressed or ready to leave but I had to choose between leaving 2 people with suitcases outside on the stairs or letting them in.  We let them in, got dressed in a rush, left the keys on the bed and took off.  Calen was in the middle of moving his business and said he was hectic but I think it could have been handled better."
279063,45995597,2015-09-07,39712653,Sarah,We arrived a little earlier than expected and Calen came by to help us settle in. Calen was also very responsive to text at all times when we had questions.  Overall a good experience!! 
279063,46258313,2015-09-08,20678893,Nastja,"It was perfect place for little getaway to Seattle. Me and my bf really enjoyed this apartment, very comfy bed. Location is perfect. Easy to get to downtown with public transport. I really recommend it! "
279063,46567454,2015-09-11,23352555,Glenn,It's great working with an experienced host like Calen. That makes things so much easier. The apt is perfectly as described and very easy. I love this location and will be back often. Thank you.
279063,46994861,2015-09-14,9495142,David,"Friendly , good communication, good information overall"
279063,47451654,2015-09-18,44453857,Chaz,Calen's apartment was great. I would recommend it to anyone. It's in a perfect location at a great price. It had all the comforts of home. I can't think of one bad thing to say about the place. It was an overall great experience! Thanks again Calen!
279063,48221963,2015-09-24,43802353,Thanh,"We liked the fact that the location is central which made all the things we planned to do easily accessible. Calen checked in on us during the duration of our stay to ensure our stay was comfortable. It was nice to have Netflix and projector set up, we did a movie night to relax after a long day exploring the city.  Thanks for hosting us!"
279063,48617349,2015-09-27,44269547,Terrell,"Calen was a good host and his place was in a great, easily accessible area. Especially for someone visiting for the first time and their first time using Airbnb. I was so lucky to find his place last minute for my trip. Calen communicated with me before I came out there and quickly answered any questions I had, putting me at ease. It was a short trip so I didn't get to try out any of his amenities like the grill and projection screen, but I'm okay with that because I really just wanted to explore the city in my free time. I definitely recommend Calen's accommodations and hope to be able to use him again if I come back to Seattle in the future."
279063,48851969,2015-09-28,42365495,Colette,"My friend and I tried airbnb for the first time and Calen made our experience great ! He always responded to questions timely, was very informative, and made you feel welcome. Will definitely be using airbnb again after an awesome first time experience. "
279063,48977129,2015-09-29,27547703,Brent,"Calen's place was great for my night layover in Seattle! Place was super clean, easy to get into and he had everything I needed. Would definitely come again!"
279063,49196256,2015-10-01,37536901,Maurizio,"Nice accomodation in a great neighborhood of Seattle. The house was beautiful and cozy. Even if I hadn't the chance to know Calen, it was a great stay."
279063,49676816,2015-10-05,7916515,Renee,"Location is great. Lots of walking-distance restaurants, including a couple on Eater's list of Seattles top 38 restaurants. View is stunning. Surrounding neighborhood is very posh and pretty. The apartment is very quiet, so it's great if you need a place simply to crash or get some work done. Our room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The guest computer was down while we were there, but that didn't matter because we brought our laptops. The shared space (living room, porch) could have been cleaner (dog hair was omnipresent and the porch needed a hose down). "
279063,49869627,2015-10-06,45772373,Jarrett,"Calen was a great host with a comfortable, quiet space near downtown.  It worked great for my trip !  I would highly recommend him and this space.

"
279063,50557338,2015-10-12,12146102,Michael,Seattle is an amazing destination and this accommodation is on point. Located right in the middle of Capital Hill - a short distance to all of the bars and restaurants and easy access to the rest of the city. Bonus points to the balcony overlooking he whole city. 
279063,51878551,2015-10-24,21622021,Adam,Calen was very hospitable and accommodating. Enjoyed the stay and also meeting other guests.
279063,52034057,2015-10-25,4026467,Jonas,"Great, very convenient stay in Capitol Hill! "
279063,52305159,2015-10-27,45570452,John,Instructions were spot on even for someone like me just arrived in the city the same day. The room was better than I expected as I am always slightly wary of places that have instant booking and no filtering of guests. Calen has it well organised so that instant booking makes sense in his case. I felt safe and relaxed there at all times and was made to feel at home in an atmosphere based on trust. 
279063,52779793,2015-11-01,34866632,LeighAnne,"Calen's place was awesome. Right in between 10th ave and 15th ave (busy restaurants and bars) was perfect after Halloween night. The bed was comfy and the amenities were great! Calen himself was super nice and treated my partner and I as welcomed guests. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking to spend it in after some drinking in cap hill ;)
Also, there are 2 bedrooms that calen rents out- just FYI.
Thanks calen!"
279063,53315406,2015-11-07,29247865,Erin,Great location. Great host. Everything was good to go!!!  Would love to stay here again on my next trip over. 
279063,53441254,2015-11-08,46604622,Brad,Calen's place was a wonderful location and he was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend his place to others! 
279063,54364415,2015-11-18,22072807,Jessica,Great host! thank you! 
279063,54493807,2015-11-20,21545556,Shinjae,I had a last minute trip to seattle and calen's instant booking made my trip easy! He emailed me all the details to get into the apt and the place was very comfortable. Its 10 min walk to all the restaurants so the location was great! His apt also has a great view to the space needle! Highly recommend!
279063,54561277,2015-11-21,22572437,Evan,"Staying at Calen's place could not have been any easier. I arrived in Seattle for just a night, and he provided arrangements for me to pick up the key without having to worry about much coordination.

The bedroom was a good size, and the views from the front balcony of the mountains were impressive. The location is great for Capitol Hill - nicely positioned between the parks on one side and nightlife of the Pine/Pike area on the other."
279063,54830315,2015-11-23,48110594,Gerrit,We had a great time at Calen's place. There are some nice bars and restaurants at walking distance and the downtown area can easily be reached by bus. Recommended.
279063,54943532,2015-11-25,21575328,Andrew,Calen's place was nice and quiet and had everything I needed! The sheets were clean and everything was communicated well in terms of how to get there and in. When I stay in Seattle again I will be sure to try this one first!
279063,55159896,2015-11-28,48593499,John,"I could not have asked for a better introduction to the AirB&B experience. Calen made everything super easy by communicating often and in detail about what to expect.  His friendliness and open attitude about sharing his charming apartment allowed me to feel completely at ease despite being a newbie. The immediate neighborhood provided easy access to many shops and restaurants.  A great location from my point of view, since I was also visiting family who live only four or five blocks away.  I made a point of varying my walking route each day to take in the diversity of housing styles in that part of Seattle. "
279063,55543721,2015-12-01,48566983,Erik Freyr,"Calen's place was great. I would highly recommend it. The room was nice and clean and as described, and the apartment was nice. Calen was fast, responsive and non intrusive as a host! Separate key for room and apartment! "
279063,55697699,2015-12-04,48190271,Michael,"Calen was great and made my stay very comfortable. His instructions were clear and simple. The room he had was very cozy, warm, and cozy. The bed was very comfortable as well. The neighborhood is perfect for going bar-hopping or trying out new restaurants. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay for a few nights in Capitol Hill."
279063,55863510,2015-12-06,11149838,Devon,"Great, walkable location! Bedroom and bathroom were both comfortable. Great view from front windows. Calen was an accommodating host!"
279063,56208288,2015-12-10,13926706,Leandra,"Calen's place was warm and inviting, great kitchen and location."
279063,56419830,2015-12-13,49745120,Matt,Calen was a great host! We had an exceptional time in Seattle and the place was located in a great area! Very clean and accommodating. Would recommend this apartment to anyone visiting. 
279063,56769692,2015-12-17,41418856,Evan,Calen was a great host! Accommodations were great as well. Highly recommend!
279063,57105223,2015-12-21,13676529,Benjamin,Excellent host and very attentive. 
279063,57358235,2015-12-24,1410975,Brad,"Great little place in the Seattle Uptown area , I stayed for 1 night , Calen gave me all the information i needed to find the location and for entering. its in a hip part of Seattle convenient to restaurant and grocery stores  all my travel need was met . He had everything in the apartment you needed for a traveler. Clean room , Full size bed , Good Shower , Clean towels , fan , books, desk, iron, 
My only qualm is the
Living room gets pretty cold but great stay overall.
 I recommend to other travelers private room at great price in hip area ."
279063,57981720,2015-12-30,16597919,Jamie,"The apartment was beautiful, great view and location. Would definitely stay here again! "
279063,58207739,2016-01-01,22678892,Simone,We had a great experience at Calen's home. The location was perfect for us and it was easy to get into the place with his directions. His home was really comfortable and cozy with a killer view of the city. 
781474,4020274,2013-04-03,4797328,Patricia,"The studio was not available, so Lynne offers to rent me her bedroom (aka master stateroom.) While the bed was comfortable, it felt odd to be staying in someone else's space. I had trouble keeping track of my stuff as the space was visually very busy, although from a voyeuristic standpoint, interesting. 
Lynne was a lovely hostess and a very easy going person. The location of the houseboat was perfect for my needs, and you can't beat the price."
8632651,55561916,2015-12-02,32668698,Candy,Kelly is a fabulous host. We encountered a problem that was outside of her control during our stay and she was quick to respond and was able to move us to this new location. Her homes are welcoming and comfortable. Our family of three was well cared for during our long stay. We slept very comfortably in the king sized bed. All of the bedding was nice and comfy. 
7007118,53669688,2015-11-10,48510627,Erika,"Loved our stay!! Alison was the perfect host! She was easy to communicate with and always quick to respond to any questions that I had. She had some great recommendations for good local spots and made us feel at home. 
The place was so cozy and welcoming. It was private and quiet. Everything was new and so clean. We had everything that we needed and more. Loved the added touches too: chocolates and wine, flowers on the table, and the extra toothbrushes! 
The location is perfect. Great spot to get all around the city in no time. 
Would love to stay here again and highly recommend to anyone looking for a great place to stay in Seattle. "
7007118,54209803,2015-11-16,48446224,Megan,I had a wonderful experience with this beautiful apartment. It's in a quite neighborhood. The place was clean and smelled good. They have wonderful towels that I fell in love and blankets. They have Netflix which is awesome. I will definitely be going back here when I want to visit Seattle. 
7007118,54795729,2015-11-23,31779232,Maryanne,"Pros: -
Alison was very quick and responsive to all of my texts. Everything in the place was true to the posting. The place was easy to access, was very clean, and had great amenities (super soft towels, Netflix, extra blankets and pillows). The location is not bad either...it took us about 20 minutes to get to downtown Seattle by car. 
(Minor) Cons:
-the bathroom is a little small with no sink in the bathroom (just in the main kitchenette area)
-Gets a little chilly at night (we're from San Diego, where it's always 80 degrees). Heating couldn't be controlled from our place alone, but Alison took care of the issue right away. She controls the heating from her place. 
Overall though, we had a good stay!"
7007118,55275068,2015-11-29,49211617,Max,Alison was a great host! The location was fantastic and I'll be sure to go back next time I'm in Seattle.
7007118,55686915,2015-12-04,48021583,Jeremy,"It was a very nice place, and we enjoyed our stay. Although we did not see the space heater so it was very cold at night. Other than the temperature it was a very nice stay in a really nice neighborhood."
7007118,56343051,2015-12-12,50581529,Ruth,"This home is extremely clean and comfortable. We had a delightful time in Seattle. We slept well in the comfortable bed in this quiet neighborhood, and felt right at home here. We had everything we wanted to heat and eat a few of our own simple meals--the ""kitchen"" had just what we needed. I didn't anticipate that I would need a little sewing kit, but there it was. Everything is fresh and new and has a modern style. The hosts are helpful and immediately responsive. We were in Seattle for a special event, and this apartment was the perfect place to prepare for it--to relax, rest, shower, and nourish--and to unwind afterwards."

There were nice additional touches, such as lovely plush bath towels, and supplies for coffee and tea. It is located a short car drive away from downtown, which was extremely convenient for us.

Even though we never met, Alison was friendly and easy to communicate with. We would definitely stay again."
