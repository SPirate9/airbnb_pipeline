6603061,41766611,2015-08-09,15745466,Joseph,Lee and Rebecca were hospitable hosts with a friendly cat and dog. Their neat little apartment was perfect for our trip to Seattle!
6603061,41996230,2015-08-10,27930762,Kyeyong,He was very kind and the location is very close to every where. I could go to downtown in 5~7 minutes. The area is very quiet and clean. Room is clean and well managed. It is better if there is dryer. 
6603061,42722179,2015-08-15,37369075,Lori,"This apartment is in a super convenient location.  It is nearby to many great shops, including El Diablo Coffee--the best coffee shop I found in Seattle (of the 12+ shops I tried!) Suki, a very fluffy cat, made for relaxing entertainment, as did Cecil the dog.  Lee and Rebecca are great hosts.  They are both very relaxed, chatty, easy to get along with, and have great recommendations about the city.  At their apartment we had a super comfy bed in the private room after long days of touring Seattle and hiking at Mt. Rainer.  The room is on the third floor of a building, so hopefully your suitcase isn't too heavy!  You should stay here!"
6603061,43536476,2015-08-20,39868350,Steffen,"Lee was a fantastic host. This was our first time staying through airbnb and he made it so easy to check in/out and was very helpful in suggestions/recommendations for places to visit as we had never been to Washington before.

The place was great! The apartment was spotless and was extremely comfortable staying in. The location was amazing, so much so that we didn't spend but a couple hours downtown Seattle, most of our time in the city was spent in Lee's subdivision walking around and enjoying the coffee shops, parks, and views his neighborhood had to offer. 

We also enjoyed the two hairy hosts of the home (cat & dog). We have a cat and dogs back home and having furry hosts to play with helped the stay feel even homier. "
6603061,43693522,2015-08-21,7530707,Echo,Perfect location & great host!
6603061,44324428,2015-08-25,39161135,Chris,"Stayed at Lee’s for 3 nights while visiting friends who live nearby.  His apartment is in a great location, in a nice neighborhood with a short walk to Kerry Park (awesome views of the Seattle skyline).  I wasn’t at the apartment much other than to sleep and get ready early in the morning before heading out.  Lee slept on the couch and has a cat and small dog who were very friendly.  I usually ended up chatting with Lee when I got back to the apartment at night.  Lee was a very nice host and the bedroom and bathroom were clean.  Apartment is on the 3rd floor.  Lee was quick to respond to all messages. "
6603061,44450526,2015-08-26,39868350,Steffen,"We spent our first and last nights in Seattle with Lee. Coming back to a familiar place after spending 5 days in Port Angeles was such a relief and very comforting. Our first night was great, we loved the area (especially the coffee shops and places to eat) close to Lee's place, so coming back to his place allowed us to relax a little more before an early morning flight. Lee was a great host again and we would love to come back and visit!"
6603061,44812602,2015-08-29,12902652,Zach,"Lee provides a comfortable room with some good local recommendations, navigating the line of chill guy who you can talk to for a bit while still giving you a bit of privacy.
He slept on the couch, which was fine for me, but others might want to know (or I didn't read carefully)
A true gentleman, he even drove me early in the morning to my ferry. Easy to talk to, made you feel  at ease."
6603061,45109304,2015-08-31,7748751,Jake,"Really loved the neighborhood Lee's apartment is in. Great parks and food / drink. Beautiful homes as well. The description is accurate regarding Lee's apartment. It's on the 3rd floor in a fairly large complex. The complex is adequate. The apartment itself is well done - very clean and neat. The bed was comfortable. Lee himself was very chill, very nice. We didn't chat much - he let us do our own thing. Lee was also very easy to get a hold of via text of call - and was always very helpful regarding any questions we had. 

The only downside to this place is it is small - it's a 1BR. I didn't realize Lee would be sleeping on the futon. It's not necessarily a big deal and I am glad I stayed here, but if I was spending more time at the Air BnB and less time in the city, I would have opted for a place where everyone has their own room. "
6603061,45308391,2015-09-01,13391022,Laura,Lee was great and very helpful. The room was quite and in a great location. 
6603061,45959248,2015-09-07,5919580,Heather,"This is a cute apartment just a few blocks from Kerry Park and a quick Uber ride away from downtown. Lee was very responsive with any questions we had. Overall this airbnb fit our needs - the only challenging part was our arrival, where we found that the building was locked. Luckily someone let us in but we were a bit concerned we'd be stuck in the rain for awhile."
6603061,46488792,2015-09-11,35016730,Marcial,"Comecei com o pé esquerdo nesta estadia. Tinha agendado outra anfitriã que cancelou minha estadia por problemas (website hidden) época, o único disponível que encontrei foi este.  Terrível, pode ser o minimo a ser dito.  
O anfitrião que tinha me avisado que não estaria não  deixou ninguém para nos orientar.  Ainda bem que fiz uma ótima pesquisa sobre Seattle. 
Apesar de ter enviado e-mail para saber como entrar no prédio nunca tive uma resposta satisfatória. Apenas um "" não se preocupe"".  Resultado: Encontramos a porta do prédio fechada. E a gente com 3 malas e com forte possibilidade de chuva.  Liguei para ele e caiu na caixa postal e ele não deu retorno. Conseguimos entrar graças a um outro morador do prédio. Ele deixou um gato que ia ser cuidado por alguém que nunca apareceu. Fomos surpreendidos pela falta de microondas na cozinha e por não ter uma mesa para a gente fazer refeições nem na cozinha e nem na sala, de vez que a unica mesa existente era usada pelo gato, que escalava uma das cadeiras para alcançar sua comida, deixada sobre ela. 
Alias, o gato  usava nosso banheiro também, sendo que   a caixa de areia nunca foi limpa.  Como a gente nunca sabia quando o gato iria fazer suas necessidades, a porta do banheiro tinha de ficar aberta o tempo todo e assim o cheiro se espraiava pelo apartamento todo. 
De quando em vez, no meio da noite, o gato dava umas corridas pelo chão de assoalho e a gente acordava  meio assustado, já que o gato era bem grande.  
Da televisão indicada no anuncio não pudemos usar, porque não nos foi indicado como faze-lo, de vez que o controle remoto deixado não funcionava. 
Também não nos dito que o apartamento ficava no terceiro andar e que não tinha elevador.  
Nem o apartamento e nem o prédio tinham um cheiro muito bom. 
O aprendizado que tive desta estada foi que por mais erradas que as coisas ocorram a gente deve olhar pelo lado bom: Uma hora tudo passa e a gente esta de ferias passeando e então o espirito precisa estar leve. Gracas ao gato a gente saia do apartamento as sete e meia para tomar cafe da manha na esquina e só voltava depois das dez da noite com as refeiçoes  efetuadas na rua.  Ou seja, fizemos do limão uma limonada. Depois que sai do apartamento, troquei mensagens com o Lee e relatei tudo que estou descrevendo agora.   Ele não me pareceu muito surpreso, dizendo que nunca tinha dito ter microondas e nem televisão a cabo. Disse também que iria tomar providencias quanto a pessoa que ficou de cuidar do gato e não cuidou. 
Em termos de custo-beneficio não foi um bom negocio: Eu não voltaria e não recomendaria nem mesmo a um inimigo.

6603061,48087637,2015-09-23,37752723,Trung,Nice little appartment. Lee is a very friendly and helpful host. Recommended.
6603061,48910242,2015-09-29,34785494,Dianne,"This was a great choice. Lee was a gracious and welcoming host. I really enjoyed our conversations. Everything was exactly as described, his apartment is charming and I was very comfortable there. Loved the neighborhood, you can just walk down the road to Kerry Park and see the most amazing views of Seattle and Puget Sound. I would definitely stay here again."
6603061,49796338,2015-10-06,13872658,Stephanie,"Lee was very hospitable and always was there with great conversations and recommendations. I wasn't around too much but the apartment is lovely, be sure to check out the view from Kerry Park. Another plus is that there is a coffee/donut shop right next door. It's a great value for an awesome location. Also, his pets are wonderful. "
6603061,50712952,2015-10-13,45785510,Ya,"Lee is a clean, quiet, easygoing guy. Although this is the first time I am using Airbnb, I love it! My boyfriend and I had a great week in Seattle. Lee gave us some advises and he also invited us go hiking with him. His apartment is clean and tidy and makes me feel like home. It is way better than living in a hotel. If I get a chance to visit Seattle again, I will definitely choose Lee's place!"
6603061,51485333,2015-10-20,24882104,Tyler,"Had a fantastic time staying at Lee's place. Very clean, well maintained, and safe.  His place is located in a great neighborhood with plenty of bars, restaurants, and shops all within walking distance. Lee was able to suggest quite a few tourist friendly things to do during my stay.  He's very knowledgeable about Seattle and the surrounding areas.  Was happy to grab a donut and coffee with him.  Anyone looking for an affordable place to stay and call home for a weekend needs to stay here."
6603061,52123789,2015-10-26,13666392,Konstantin,"Lee is a great host, very friendly and welcoming. His dog is a bit loud in the first couple of minutes as he sees a stranger, but is also friendly and totally harmless. The apartment (including the one bedroom where I was staying--Lee slept on a couch in the living room) is very clean and quiet, and it's location is *awesome*: a stunning view on Seattle and, importantly, the Molly Moon's Ice Cream right next door (trust me: once you try it, you'll realize that it's like +100 to the apartment's attractiveness). My only concern was that the wi-fi didn't really work throughout the whole week end I was staying at Lee's place, so I had to go to one of the cafes to make a Skype call."
6603061,53701261,2015-11-11,11210360,Kira,"Neighborhood was really pretty and close to a lot of sites. The apartment was cute, very clean and comfy. Our host was very friendly and accommodating. "
6603061,54995847,2015-11-27,30677375,Kiyoon,"Lee was a nice host.
When we checked in, he was welcoming us and helpful even though we missed the flight and let him wait for a long. 
His pets were adorable. Especially his cat was friendly to us. :)
His room and bathroom were really clean and nice.  
The location was awesome! It is pretty close to downtown. We could get to many tourist spots by bus, uber, and walking. 
It was great staying his house for us.
We enjoyed our trip and staying there.
I would highly recommend."

3820186,19853449,2014-09-19,1554184,Dawn,"Sea To Sky's Penthouse in Belltown was the perfect place for me and my co-workers. We were in town for business and found this to be an incredible alternative to impersonal (and booked up) hotels in Seattle. The views are amazing, the layout of the flat perfect for providing lots of personal space, and we had every amenity we could ask for including a lovely gas fireplace for the cooler evenings. The concierge service downstairs is very helpful and allows you to pick up and drop off keys at any time. Belltown is conveniently located near downtown and is close to convenient stores, delicious Macrina bakery, as well as tons of restaurant choices along 2nd and 1st Aves. Recommend this spot enthusiastically!"
3820186,26591501,2015-02-16,21146889,Julia,"A group of 8 girls stayed at the Olympus for a Bachelorette party and we couldn't be more pleased. The service inside with the concierge was great, the penthouse itself was great and the overall neighborhood was amazing. We had a front row view of the water right outside on our patio - it was absolutely amazing.

When we did have problems with the penthouse, i.e. one of the toilets flushed incredibly slowly, SeaToSky responded back very quickly and had the problem fixed in no time. 

I would very much love to stay at the Olympus again should I return with another big party."
3812725,19278090,2014-09-09,19653268,Trent,"Meisha's house in Ravenna was such a pleasant experience, I would highly recommend it for any family looking to relax and explore in Seattle.  I stayed with my brothers and a niece and nephew from Nebraska.  Miesha was very kind to provide an airbed for the kids to sleep just outside the master bedroom.  

The house was very well furnished and beautifully remodled, so it feels like a luxury vacation rental at the same time it feels like home.  That's one of the best compliments I could give!

The kitchen and dining areas are spacious so we relaxed every morning with a newspaper, excellent Seattle coffee provided by Miesha, and lots of sun (if you are lucky enough to enjoy Seattle in September).  In the evenings, we enjoyed a glass of wine on the back deck, very quiet and peaceful looking south and west.  
Easy access to all other parts of Seattle.  We spent a lot of time in Ballard, but were also a very short drive from Greenlake, Ravenna Park, the University, and the Woodland Park Zoo (which the kids LOVED.)
"
3812725,23496016,2014-12-02,22451304,Rachel,"My family was in town for Thanksgiving. We rented Miesha's house for the week and it was a wonderful experience. We had kids with us so the fact that it's a kid-friendly house was nice. The rooms were spacious, beds were comfortable, and all the essentials were available in the kitchen for cooking. We really liked the location, too. Miesha was extremely responsive when I had questions and even sent us a pie! And finally, the heated bathroom floors and tub with jets were quite a nice luxury!"
3812725,24667893,2015-01-01,24210758,Krista,"My family was coming to visit, and we have a very small house. The home in Ravenna was a wonderful solution. Miesha was very friendly and responsive. The house was even decorated for the holidays, and Miesha left us a little gift under the tree. The house was clean and comfortable, and my family felt spoiled by the newly remodeled spa bath (and heated floors in all bathrooms!). Plenty of space, and comfy beds. The family took many walks around the neighborhood, for fun and exercise, and also for nearby coffee and Top Pot doughnuts. A great experience, and we wouldn't hesitate to book the house again. WAY better (and less expensive) than the hotel we have used in the past."
6044106,30747097,2015-04-26,3034969,Ashley,"Christine and Steve are lovely, conscientious hosts. The apartment is everything you might need. Very clean and new. Great location and lovely view of Union Lake from the balcony. Would definitely come back."
6044106,31265567,2015-05-03,26919954,Ari,"Reasonably-priced accommodations with easy access to Fremont, which is what i was aiming for.  The apartment is a nice size, and has a lovely balcony and view.  It was clean and everything looked new.  The host was friendly and accommodating.  The side-loading washer and dryer unit was a nice touch.

The roads in the area are a little weird, and my GPS wasn't familiar with all of them, meaning i drove around more than i needed to.  Steve, Christine's husband, spent some time briefing me on them.

Downtown access was also fairly simple, by way of public transit.  My smartphone's map application was helpful in telling me how and where to cross Aurora, via foot underpass."
6044106,31551218,2015-05-06,29902264,Mark,Great place. Very clean. Walking Distance to the restaurants on Freemont. Would definitely stay there again. 
6044106,31674570,2015-05-08,11358484,Rachel,Christine and her husband Steve are new to airbnb but eager to learn what is expected from guests. They responded promptly and generously to any needs or requests. The apartment was spotless as everything is brand new. We were comfortable even with three adults and two 2 year olds with comfy furniture for us and ample floor space for the kids. It is conveniently and centrally located with easy access to Seattle and the surrounding areas. We would happily book with Christine and Steve again. 
6044106,31826697,2015-05-10,30165994,Aaron,"The location and the amenities of this place were amazing.  Steve had everything ready including new appliances.  The BBQ and ping pong were a hit.  The place was very clean and quiet and very close to Lake Union.  I will definitely stay here again.  

"
6044106,32287088,2015-05-16,6882503,Matthew,The apartment was clean and comfortable. Nice view and location to Fremont. Christine was very sweet and accommodating. 
6044106,32382034,2015-05-17,12958851,Deborah,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Christine's place. It was clean, had comfortable beds, and had all necessary amenities. It was within walking distance to the Fremont area, which is filled with restaurants and food shopping. It's very close to the bus that will take you all the way to downtown and Safeco field. Highly recommend It!"
6044106,32769279,2015-05-21,31379010,Angel,"Meeting up with Christine was easy, and she was very friendly while explaining some of the great things to see and do in the neighborhood. We found the apartment to be just as it is described on the listing. We had a blast exploring Fremont, Queen Anne and all the great restaurants nearby.  Seattle is a wonderful city, and having a home-like space to relax in after a day of adventures made for more rewarding memories. We would recommend this listing for it's location, comfort and value. "
6044106,32849731,2015-05-22,10478210,Armaan,Christine was very organized and the entire stay went very smooth. Recommended! 
6044106,33139008,2015-05-25,16357051,Qi,Christine and Steve are very nice couple! We are so glad that we chose their apartment. It's very clean and well furnished. It's quiet and close to downtown. Parking is free! It fits perfectly for 4 people. We really enjoyed staying in this apartment. It worths a lot more than any hotel. Highly recommended!!!  
6044106,33875794,2015-06-01,8931336,Alex,We were very comfortable in Christine's apartment which was conveniently located for us to explore Seattle.
6044106,34331551,2015-06-07,5544849,Suzanne,"Enjoyed our stay at Christine and Steve's Unit. The place was clean, comfortable, and cozy, done with style. Lake Union view from the balcony was great, especially during these summer temperatures. Everything we needed and could possibly think of needing was provided. The location was great, too. Felt safe walking to Dexter Ave and having my morning run through Fremont Bridge and to Gas Works Park via the Burke Gilman Trail. The building was right off of 99 (Aurora Ave N). We appreciated that Christine checked up on us before and during our stay to make sure everything was ok. Check in and check out was super easy."
6044106,34781223,2015-06-12,31095663,Raisa,I enjoyed staying in this comfortable apartment with a wonderful view of the Union lake from the balcony.  Christine is a welcoming and a very accommodating host. She made sure that my stay was pleasant.
6044106,35381645,2015-06-18,31841198,Diane,"Christine was a really helpful and thoughtful host. We never met but she was very accommodating and the apartment was better than she described it. Perfectly placed with parking facilities it was clean quiet and had a lovely view over the water. We enjoyed walking to the Gasworks park of an evening and being central enough to be able to get in and out of town. Sitting out on the balcony eating breakfast and evening meals was delightful.
We will be coming back again soon.  "
6044106,35661559,2015-06-21,31244122,Jennifer,"We loved all of the great trip information that was left for us.  It was so helpful.  It was a wonderful base to explore the great city of Seattle.  Great views, too!"
6044106,36022752,2015-06-24,33161255,Tony,Beautiful location and room.  Christine sent emails leading up to the day we were checking in to make sure we knew how to get there and how to get into the apartment.  Would definitely stay there again!
6044106,36158258,2015-06-25,36486917,Julie,Great location! Very clean. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you!!!
6044106,36239531,2015-06-26,32705795,Steven,"Christine was very welcoming and accommodating during our stay.  She was proactive with her reaching out to ensure that everything went smoothly and also left very clear and detailed instructions on how to access the building, park our car, etc.  The location and view from the balcony were awesome.  I highly recommend staying here to experience Seattle.  "
6044106,39001563,2015-07-20,32632084,Joe,"Hi Christine and Steve - 

We really enjoyed our stay at your apartment.   It had everything we needed and was very quiet.  Once we got familiar with the city we found it to be in a great location - very close to Seattle Center, Fremont, and other neat areas to visit.  The views from the balcony are just as described.  The apartment was extremely clean and well provisioned - we wish we would've stayed longer to take advantage of it all.   We would highly recommend this to anyone staying in Seattle.   

Joe and Stephanie"
6044106,39510823,2015-07-24,20330617,Lulu,"Christine's place was such a gem -- clean, homey yet spacious, with beautiful views, and convenient to everything in Seattle. The washer + dryer were a nice bonus. Christine was also a great host! She was proactive with reaching out ahead of our stay with instructions for check-in and had a helpful book of recommendations. 

I would highly recommend this listing!"
6044106,39927874,2015-07-27,10691723,Currie Cole,Christine was a great host for our visit to Seattle for a friend's wedding.  We appreciated that she provided very detailed instructions about how to access her West Queen Anne apartment and her flexibility in allowing us to check in a few hours early.  The apartment was just a short walk to the cool neighborhood of Fremont so we were able to walk to the wedding ceremony and reception.
6044106,40637519,2015-08-01,38028766,Claire,"Wonderful stay in a quiet building.  View from the small balcony lovely. The apartment was comfortable, very clean, and well furnished.  Would definitely stay there again when visiting Seattle!"
6044106,41086570,2015-08-04,15716376,Quinn,"Christine was an amazing and responsive host, and the apartment was as lovely as posted!!!"
6044106,41365498,2015-08-07,18566631,Svetlana,"The Hudson apartment we stayed in was really nice and clean and had a great view from balcony. It had all the necessary stuff in the rooms and kitchen including coffee, sugar, oil, etc. Even chocolates:)
Christine and Steve were easy to contact if needed. Did not use the parking but it was available and included. Everything was to my satisfaction and more.

"
6044106,42256130,2015-08-12,32017817,Natalie,This Seattle apartment had a lovely balcony with a great view of Lake Union. The windows and door to the balcony were wonderful open to let in the clean fresh Seattle breeze. Kitchen was fully stocked. Convenient parking space. Washer and dryer in apartment (with laundry detergent included) was very useful.
6044106,42558725,2015-08-14,37996845,Kenneth,The apartment was clean and modern and had a great little balcony for enjoying morning coffee. Conveniently located with a parking space. We are glad we rented a car. Fremont Brewery is just a skip down the road and it was great. Our only regret is that we didn't rent the space for longer. Next time we are in Seattle we will most likely be contacting Christine again. 
6044106,43035595,2015-08-17,28667153,Michelle,"We had a great time in Seattle.  Christine's apartment was clean, had all the amenities of home and a great view of Lake Union.  We cook dinner one night and found everything we needed, including oil and spices. I enjoyed working out in the gym and hanging out at the deck.  The only parking available for guest is on the street.  Christine was very helpful and kept in contact with us, as well as her husband.  We will definitely come back!"
6044106,43336127,2015-08-18,6847603,Alison,"Christine and Steve were very quick to respond to our last minute booking request and make sure we had all the information necessary for arrival. Apartment was exactly as described. The garage is tight to manoeuvre, but we were able to get a standard SUV rental in (Hyundai Santa Fe). "
6044106,43966724,2015-08-23,23529012,Cia,"The apartment is a peaceful retreat from the city, yet close enough for a quick drive to the neighborhoods of Fremont and Queen Anne. Airy and light-filled, the main room is outfitted with a modern kitchen, small dining table and a living room area with flat screen TV. All the basics are in the kitchen, just bring your groceries. For coffee lovers, there's even a French-press or drip-style coffee maker. 

A small balcony off the living area provides a partial view of Lake Union and an adjacent green space -- a great spot for more coffee! Easy to connect WIFI and 2 flat screen TVs (living room and bedroom) make staying connected a breeze. A stacked washer and dryer are in the unit, a real benefit for life on the road. The one bathroom is modern and very clean. 

Unlike some Airbnb properties that are personal homes, this one bedroom unit is set up as a rental, so it really feels more like a large hotel suite that is professionally maintained and easy to make your own. 

A single parking space beneath the building with ceiling height of 6 feet requires a little maneuvering, as others describe, but having a dedicated spot is gold in Seattle. The garage can handle a small SUV.

Christine and Steve were very quick to respond to any questions.  I'll be back without hesitation."
6044106,45420917,2015-09-02,27099102,Jenna,We loved staying at Christine's place! The view was phenomenal!! It was very nice to have a parking spot reserved for us and a kitchen during our stay. The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have the sleeper sofa as an option. 
6044106,45834669,2015-09-06,26016271,Daniel,This place was great! Perfect location with a great view. Thanks so much for having us!
6044106,46342306,2015-09-09,95284,Brett,"Christine's place is great for a short stay in Seattle. She was thoughtful to include ping pong paddles and BBQ equipment to use from the shared deck. I loved the great view of Lake Union, the gym downstairs, and the well equipped kitchen. Christine was great about communicating information before we got to Seattle. I'd recommend this place!"
6044106,46747293,2015-09-13,25652564,Leigh,"Christine was very easy to work with in booking her airbnb.  She was quick to communicate with me about the accommodations and directions prior to my arrival at her apartment.  On the day of check-in she was also available to answer questions and responded quickly. 
The location of her apartment is so wonderful!  We had a great view of the lake from the balcony and the lake is close enough to get to if you would like to take a jog around it, which my husband and I did one morning.   
The apartment was very lovely with a comfortable bed and nice shower.  The kitchen was supplied with pots and pans and dishes which would have allowed us to stay in and make dinner, if we had chosen to do so. What I really appreciated however, was the coffee and coffee maker.  Thank you!  "
6044106,47232017,2015-09-16,6594955,Marcos,Christine replied quickly and we always very kind and helpful. The apartment is very nice and we'll equipped.
6044106,47992058,2015-09-22,41327047,Suzi,"This apartment turned out to be a great choice for a memory-making trip with my parents and our first Airbnb experience.  The apartment is comfortable, nicely decorated and filled with thoughtful touches.  We found everything we needed in the well-equipped kitchen to make breakfast each morning.  The memory foam topper for the sleeper sofa made it a comfortable bed. The living area was a great place for us to relax and recharge when not exploring Seattle.  My parents enjoyed watching the boats on Lake Union from the balcony area and I appreciated the small park next to the apartment with its interesting design.

The Queen Anne location is charming and very convenient to many attractions, which we often accessed via Lyft.  (Tip:  Schedule your pick-up at back entrance on Birch Ave. N.)

The parking place that comes with the apartment is a huge asset as well which made it easy for my niece to visit.

Christine was a very responsive host, quickly answering initial questions then continuing to be available leading up to the stay and during the stay.  She clearly genuinely cares that her guests have a great experience, both enjoying the city and the Airbnb -- which we did!

6044106,48157782,2015-09-23,24934629,Ryan,Great modern apartment! Very cozy and clean with a great view. The space had everything needed to feel right at home including fresh ground coffee in the fridge. Christine takes all of the guess work out - extremely responsive and easy to work with. A place I would definitely visit again. Thank you!
6044106,48397061,2015-09-26,38238742,Heather,Christine texted prior to our arrival to make sure we had all that we needed for our stay.  The place was very clean and comfortable.  Close to downtown and to the Fremont and Wallingford neighborhoods.  
6044106,48578805,2015-09-27,6307614,Ronnie,"The apartment was excellent - great view from the balcony, kept clean, overall very nice.  I would stay here again.

It took some wandering to find the apartment once inside the apartment building, but that wasn't a big deal."
6044106,48801282,2015-09-28,29139701,Aaron,"Christine's place was available for instant booking, which was extremely helpful given the short notice of my trip. She emailed me with instructions on how to park, pick up keys, and get to her place a few days before the trip. 

This was the first experience where an Airbnb host wasn't onsite to greet me and give me a walkthrough of what was in the area. Not a huge deal since I already had plans made and Chrstine left a guestbook with some details on things to do and places to eat. 

Christine's place was nice and fairly well decorated. Two TVs, fans, etc, were a nice feature. Food-wise, the kitchen was partially stocked (water filter in the fridge, some hot sauce, spices, etc). Bed was comfy, sofa was sleepable. The neighbors were reasonably quiet.

Good location and an overall decent enough place."
6044106,50335610,2015-10-11,8063441,John,"Great location.  So convenient to Queen Anne, Fremont, Ballard and downtown.
Nice little apt. Minimal furnishings.  Lovely view from the little balcony.
Very nice on premises gym and common areas.
Rather warren-like complex.  Although written directions on how to get to apt were accurate, a map of the complex would have been helpful. "
6044106,51188231,2015-10-18,35305841,Martina,"I had a fantastic stay at Christine's unit in Queen Anne. Christine was extremely prompt and detailed with her communication immediately upon booking. She sent along a detailed document with everything I needed to know to get to the unit, access the garage and building. I was even able to have a package securely delivered while I was there. I stayed for a full 7 days, so I had plenty of time to settle in. The unit itself is very clean and welcoming with a hotel like feel in the bathroom including all the basic amenities (shampoo/conditioner, soap, lotion, blow dryer, etc). Easy to connect to wifi and fully functional kitchen. Location is great for anyone looking to enjoy downtown, Queen Anne or Fremont areas of Seattle. Very central and easy access to 99 or I-5 for additional travel. I highly recommend this listing and will definitely book again in the future for work trips to Seattle! Thank you, Christine!!"
6044106,51835242,2015-10-24,41126423,Josh,Overall good stay.  Location was close to downtown and walking distance to Fremont.  Gym was huge and relatively empty although we  were in there at 5:30am.  I would stay here again.
6044106,52216080,2015-10-27,5552612,Desiree,"Christine and her husband were very welcoming, accomodating, and kind. They gave us easy instructions of how to get to the aparyment. The apartment was in an older building, but when you opened the door to the apartment it smelled clean and new. This apartment is beautiful. We were very comfortable there and enjoyed our stay. "
6044106,52779574,2015-11-01,16819325,Cory And Sarah,"Christine's place is just lovely.  Well put together,  clean,  with a gorgeous view of Lake Union.  She was friendly and accommodating.  The place isn't walkable to too much as far as we could tell,  but the E line bus is a block away and takes you right downtown in 15 minutes tops.  A great place from which to explore a great city.  Thanks,  Christine."
6044106,53655166,2015-11-10,13466201,David,The listing description was accurate and so was the description of the neighborhood. They gave a good description of how to get to the unit. 
6044106,54419112,2015-11-19,27128862,Marlon,"Although a very quick booking for me (same day), they were able to get me in their place! It is a very nice apartment, more than what I needed and everything I asked for! It is not very far from South Lake Union (about a 30 minute walk) and easy to access via car as well. Nice balcony view from the apartment and a comfy queen sized bed, also a couch in the living room for extra guests. Christine and Steve made me feel very much at home! Both were very clear about the directions to get to the property and the rules."
6044106,55279831,2015-11-29,256515,Claudia,Thank you Christine for having the perfect spot to have a warm cozy Thanksgiving holiday with our family.   This apartment was clean and tastefully furnished with zero clutter.  The kitchen was amply equipped with tons of clear space to keep our food and gear.  The designated parking space was such a relief. Having ping pong on the deck with heat lamps provided for hours of family fun. Many thanks. We will be back.
6044106,55962895,2015-12-07,2798037,Jenna,"This apartment was in a perfect location to avoid traffic since the client I consult for is right down the street on Dexter Avenue.  It was nicely decorated and the hosts supply everything a traveler would need.  I love the wood floors and the modern look of the kitchen.  The view of the balcony is pretty, even at night.  I appreciated the fact that the host (Christine) and her husband (Steve) messaged me and let me know that they had their ringers on their phone on in case I needed help with directions or getting in the lockbox/building - and it was 1am when my plane landed - so that made me feel taken care of.   Thank you for a pleasant visit!
p.s. I loved having a washer and dryer for my travel; it beats being in a hotel without one!"
6044106,56671285,2015-12-16,48436603,Anna,"I agree with all the other positive reviews below. Christine is very efficient and quick about responding via email. I was always pleasantly surprised by her responses. She is very accommodating and helpful. Also, the gym is superb. There is a small wall to climb and tv's to watch while running. It is clean and big enough to accommodate many people. The one thing I should have taken into account was the square feet of the apartment. I did not account for a wide angle lens to be used and forgot that apartments in Seattle are probably smaller than that of in San Diego. It is still a very good apartment. Also, it was very clean. I love that it had a surplus of towels, shampoo, and soap for the dishes and clothes. It really was the little details that Christine took care of that made it wonderful. "
6044106,57718471,2015-12-28,19355373,Magy,"Although I didnt meet Kathy she left very detailed instructions for how to get to the apartment, where to park, and how to find the apartment. which was super helpful. The neighborhood was great, super close to everything we wanted to attend and see in Seattle, also great view!"
910784,5814320,2013-07-17,103793,Brooke,"Brian and Nate are amazing people. We actually stayed in their other property on the first floor of their home which they've converted to a two bedroom apartment. (They live upstairs). They have a notebook filled with suggestions of places to go around the neighborhood, a DVD player with lots of DVD's including Modern Family which we watched every night :) and we both slept amazingly well there. A great place to stay if you're ever in Seattle!!!"
910784,6111181,2013-07-30,6617806,Maximilian,"We had a wonderful stay at Brian and Nate's .They are great hosts and People. Olive, their little dog, is super cute! Their apartment is even better as described, super clean, spacious and well equipped. My mom fell in love with the washing maschine and the dryer, so effective and quick (she said). We wish them all the luck in the world and a lot of great guests!"
910784,6282247,2013-08-06,6017182,China,"Nate & Brian were the most gracious of hosts.  Nate was infinitely flexible with our evolving travel plans, extremely personable and communicative.  They both had great recommendations for places to eat, which added so much to our trip.  Their space is extremely clean, comfortable and inviting.  Stay here!"
910784,6515006,2013-08-15,6049981,Melissa,"What a fabulous apartment. So cute, comfortable & tastefully decorated. The entire house looks very well maintained & nicely landscaped.. I wanted to move in!  Wish I had more time to spend at the actual apartment. Sad that I did not get to meet Nate & Brian.They seem like such nice guys. Communication was great. They checked to see if we needed anything & were comfortable. What a great first AirBnB experience."
910784,6591303,2013-08-18,7461057,Michael,"Brian and Nate have a delightful apartment that is extremely well appointed, easy to get to, and minutes from downtown Seattle.  It was a perfect option for our family of four- highly recommended. "
910784,6758245,2013-08-24,7452955,Kirk,"I'm a first timer at using airbnb and how lucky was I to find such a great place in the heart of Seattle.  Nate and Brian's place exceeded my expectations to accommodate 2 adults and an active 10 yr old girl.  We stayed 6 days and loved the convenient  location, just minutes from everything we did and visited!  The neighborhood was quiet and calming, a great place to come back to after a full day of seeing the sites in Seattle.  Nate was very helpful in suggesting local neighborhood eateries as well as places to chill.  I would definitely love to stay at Brian and Nate's Urban Oasis again!"
910784,6817369,2013-08-26,1332110,Lena,"Brian and Nate were great hosts. Easy to communicate with and helped us with an extra mirror. It was quiet and in a great area. The place was clean and we had enough space for the four of us. The towels were clean and beds were comfortable. There were some great little spots to eat close by and some cute shops. Easy in and out, loved the keyless entry. Thanks for everything. And would love to stay there again next time we visit Seattle."
910784,6898205,2013-08-29,3461172,Aaron,"Brian and Nate were great hosts. They were easy to get in touch with before we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed when we got to their place. They even met us out front to say hello (with their little dog Olive) when our taxis arrived.
The apartment is cute and comfortable. Originally, we planned for just three of us to stay but another couple decided to join us at the last minute.  Brian and Nate were very accommodating and while the place was a bit tight for 5, it was definitely workable.
Location-wise, it's just a short walk to some great restaurants and bars. We even walked downtown in about 40 minutes.
We'd definitely stay there again!"
910784,7010163,2013-09-03,3695525,Kevin,"Stayed here to go to PAX Prime at the Washington State Convention Center. Although a hotel downtown would have been more convenient, Brian and Nate's place was a nice respite every night from the hustle and bustle around the center.

Transportation-wise, it was easy to get to and from Brian and Nate's place. We just took the Link from the airport to downtown and got a ride to the house. One day, my friend walked to the WSCC. He said that the walk was nice and didn't take too long. Most of the days though we used SideCar or public transit to get around.

The home was pretty much as described and included everything we needed from bath soap to and iron. The images don't show that the home is connected via a long hallway, but the rooms are large enough to where people can come together to decompress. This factor also seemingly lends itself to the cultured charm of both the home and neighborhood.

Brian and Nate are also awesome people. As I was exiting their place to walk to a nearby grocery store, I saw Brian upstairs through the window. I waved. He waved back, got Nate and Olive (their dog), and came outside. Later that day, there was an intense storm. There was thunder and presumably lightning (I was napping so I only heard things). The rain was some of the hardest I've heard in a long while. Brian and Nate were about to head out somewhere when this storm swept by.

Outside, their neighbor was trying to get into her house but she didn't have the key because the contractor had it. She was caught in the downpour. Instead of just pretending it to be a non-issue, I believe it was Brian offered for this neighbor to come into their home despite leaving it at the same time. Surely in LA, this wouldn't happen. It makes me smile to know that there are people that would do this.

All in all, Brian and Nate are great people who simply want you to feel at home. Their place is a nice size and has what you would need. It's pretty convenient to downtown and even more convenient to the nightlife options in Capitol Hill. Would totally recommend it to people wanting a taste of Seattle."
910784,7159129,2013-09-09,6708156,Yuval,"My family and I loved staying at B & N's!  Their place is ultra stylish, clean and cozy, and in a perfect location.  It was easy to communicate with them prior to and also upon arrival, and we appreciated the binder they left us which was filled with tips and brochures about local spots (don't miss out on high spot cafe!).  We were a couple with a toddler and the in-laws, and were quite comfortable in the suite.  We would definitely stay there again!"
910784,7395517,2013-09-18,7884265,Amanda," I stayed here for a week with 2 friends and it was a great experience. Super clean, comfortable and amazingly well stocked, the apartment is in a quiet neighborhood that is walking distance to some great spots. We were able to walk to downtown most days, but if the hills start taking their toll on your calves, public transport and cabs make it easy. Brian and Nate are easy to get in touch with and greeted us at the door when we arrived. After that, they gave us full privacy and we had everything we needed for the week. Highly, highly recommended. :)"
910784,8145952,2013-10-17,4839809,Richard,Very cute flat in a good location and great hosts. Even got to play a bit of Mario on the Wi! 
910784,8275882,2013-10-23,4625449,Sandy,"Brian and Nate's place was beyond anything we expected.  I traveled with my boyfriend, my sister and her 6 month old baby, and her friend.  We couldn't have asked for a better place for our first time in Seattle! Not only was it in a great location, but it also captures the true essence of the Emerald State in the neighborhood.  Whenever we needed anything, they were just a text away, which made it very easy for us.  They also have a washer and dryer in the unit, so if you want clean clothes before packing to go home, this is the perfect place! Next time we go to Seattle, their place is DEFINITELY our first choice!  Thanks for making our first Air BNB Experience a great one! "
910784,8641469,2013-11-10,7250079,Michael,"Brian and Nate are hands down the best hosts ever.  We absolutely enjoyed being part of their home and community for a couple weeks.  So why 4 stars and not 5?  Because I'm a picky person! ;-)  The apartment is wonderful for the weekender, etc.  We stayed for two weeks, which is definitely to long without a full kitchen, more space etc.  We read the ad, and it is RIGHT ON the money accurate.  Cute, cute, cute and great location.  As a business traveler who does long stays, I should definitely be more selective of the size of the property, items in the kitchen (the only way to warm up, cook or provision food is from a microwave).  If your going to Seattle for a weekend, STAY NO WHERE ELSE!  This place is absolutely perfect.  But if you like to cook eggs, etc, then know it's a European Style Kitchenette, which means no cooking items other than a microwave.  The apartment was spotless and clean - they did an amazing job with making sure you had everything you needed.  Last point -- the guys have an amazing selection of movies and a Wii.  I've not ""lounged"" on a sofa in over 5 months, and found myself doing it twice at their place watching a little ""..Did you hear the lambs at night Clarice...[i.e., Silence of The Lambs] - kick ass movie)...""  This is a highly recommended spot.  
"
910784,8706673,2013-11-12,9810027,Naureen,"This was such a wonderful, wonderful find in Seattle!! Brian and Nate's place was incredibly well kept, beautifully decorated and a wide arrange of amenities were provided.  Every detail from a stocked coffee bar to shampoo dispensers in the shower were totally appreciated! My friends and I were in love the minute we stepped in to the minute we had to leave.  It's conveniently located near the coolest places in town which made it super easy for first time visitors to see everything we wanted to see.  

We got a real sense of the warm and generosity that Brian and Nate have for guests, I would highly recommend staying here - and I would love to come back!!  If there was a sixth star, this place would get it.

910784,8743239,2013-11-15,659038,Royal,"Location was great, Brian and Nate were great communicators, the beds were actually pretty good as compared to many hotels I've stayed in."
910784,9255823,2013-12-16,1681647,Dan,"Brian and Nate provide everything they promise.  I used to live in Seattle so didn't need much guidance but I bet if you can use it they would offer whatever you need.  Their apartment was quiet, exceptionally clean and, important for a restless sleeper like me, had a really comfortable bed.  There was even easy on street parking.  And lest I forget, the price was right.  Recommended.  "
910784,9488753,2013-12-31,8934343,Chris,We very much enjoyed our stay with Brian and Nate.  The house was very well appointed and clean; the beds very comfortable – it was like staying at home away from home.   The location was great – very short walks to the bus line.  The Location made for easy access to downtown or any of the attractions that Seattle has to offer.  We will definitely stay again on our next trip to Seattle.
910784,9644575,2014-01-04,9841523,Chelsea,"Staying at Brian and Nate's place was above and beyond what we could have expected. The apartment was beautiful, clean and very close to many restaurants and bars. They were very flexible with us and easy to communicate with. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here if you plan on visiting Seattle. Very charming and would love to stay here again."
910784,9800966,2014-01-11,5217059,Paul,"Details, details, details. B&N were the ultimate hosts! 
They provided all the amenities that made me and my friends' stay amazing. 

Time rented: 2 nights in early January 2014

Location: Perfect! The location is a quick drive away from the downtown area (~15 minutes). There was plenty of parking in front of the complex.

Housing: There were two bedrooms, both equipped with queen size beds that were super comfortable. There was also a pull out bed in the living room (that was somewhat comfortable). The overall living quarters were well decorated, warm and welcoming (we were greeted by a faux fireplace display courtesy of netflix). B&N provided everything down to the tiniest of details-- extra toiletries, towels, linens, blankets and pillows, chocolate, coffee, and even umbrellas for the rainy season! B&N also provided a guide to city in a neat little folder filled with many maps and recommendations.

Communication: B&N were easy to contact via the airbnb app or via text. They were prompt and very helpful. They were always willing to help make our stay more enjoyable and exciting.

Value: I would definitely recommend this location to my friends. I would also definitely rent from them again in the future (perhaps during the non-rainy season).

Overall: A++++ would rent again!"
910784,9906895,2014-01-18,10349175,Ken,"Brian & Nate's place was very comfortable, located in a very upscale, very safe and quiet neighborhood, close to shopping and restaurants.  The 2 bedroom basement apartment is beautifully decorated and included very easy access to laundry machines which came in very handy for me during my stay. The well stocked kitchen made it very easy for me to prepare several dinners during my stay. I left for work early and returned late during my stay due to my new job, so I did not get the chance to meet Brian and Nate in person, but the house was very quite. I had no trouble finding parking right in front of their home. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend Brian and Nate!"

910784,10168643,2014-02-03,10512790,Peter,"Brian and Nate are great hosts who seem to be genuinely concerned that their guests get to make the most of their time in Seattle. Their studio is just as described and even though we stayed in quite cold weather conditions, the bed was so warm and snug that we turned off the heating. They have added many thoughtful touches that make their place feel like a home - something that would make the apartment ideal for a longer stay. The location is extremely central, and although we had never visited Seattle before found it really easy to get in and out of the city center and make our way to various attractions. The nearby neighborhood offers an abundance of great cafes, restaurants, bars and clubs. We would happily stay here again the next time we visit."
910784,10224190,2014-02-07,9669411,Joel,"Brian and Nate have an amazing two-bedroom apartment in a fantastic location!  We were there for a business trip and the location allowed us easy access to downtown and freeways for out-of-city meetings.  Meanwhile, when we came back for the evening, we didn't need to go far to find restaurants and entertainment in nearby Capitol Hill or Madison neighbourhoods.

The apartment itself was nicely decorated with some of the most comfortable beds I've slept in!  Nice soft towels, a fine selection of teas and coffee, local area maps, Wii and on-demand HBO made the place even more enjoyable and cozy.  Thanks guys!"
910784,10381746,2014-02-17,10857911,Amber,Brian and Nate were very kind and their apartment was perfect!  There was more than enough room for us and the space was very cute and comfortable.  It was great to have a kitchen and they made sure it was stocked with everything needed.  They were very accommodating and they went out of their way to make sure everything was ready and taken care of for us.  We really enjoyed our stay in their apartment in Seattle and look forward to returning!
910784,10493538,2014-02-22,10968864,Becky,"Nate and Brian's suite was perfect for our best friend road trip to Seattle.  It had all of the amenities of a luxury hotel, with the comfort of a good friend's home.  We were able to walk to all of the major attractions we had come to see and came upon lovely neighborhoods and beautiful parks along the way.  Nate and Brian went out of their way to make their home welcoming and comfortable, and were very friendly, accommodating,  and kind when we had the luck of meeting them briefly.  We would love to stay here again and highly recommend their suite to anyone looking for a fun and relaxing place in Seattle."
910784,10980406,2014-03-16,11848727,Laila,"Hi Brian and Nate,
We have very much enjoyed our stay at your home. The place was very organized, clean and in a quiet area. It's very close to most attraction esp downtown. The kids enjoyed watching movies through the wii which offered a great variety of cartoons and movies. They loved the house so much that they would prefer to stay in if that was an option :) also, Brian and Nate were very quick to respond when we had questions. 
Thank you for making our trip an interesting one."
910784,11071881,2014-03-19,10129930,Joe,Brian and Nate made us feel like we were staying in a 5 star resort. My family of 4 had a blast in Seattle.  The Wii provided us with TV and the game selection made my my girls very happy. The location was fantastic. Many restaurants and a couple grocery stores were within walking distance.  The entire apartment was updated. The shower and bathroom were amazing. I hope that this place will be available the next time we head to Seattle. Thanks again.
910784,11240754,2014-03-26,11280921,Giao,Brian and Nate's place is absolutely adorable! My three friends and I stayed here for 3 nights and were completely comfortable. The place is walking distance to the bus stop and a Zip Car location so getting around was easy. We would love staying here again the next time we're in Seattle. 
910784,11430185,2014-04-02,12154472,Sara,"We loved staying in Brian & Nate's cozy apartment while we were in Seattle. It was nice to come back to a quiet neighbourhood after a busy day of seeing the sights. The apartment was well stocked with luxury towels, tasty coffee & teas and several guidebooks and maps of the area. B & N really exceeded our expectations! Nate came out to say hello when we arrived and recommended a few local places, which was much appreciated. We would absolutely stay here again. "
910784,11582664,2014-04-08,11632994,Tom,"We loved the 2 BR apartment - perfect for 2 couples with a nice kitchen and living room area.  The beds also were very comfortable and the apartment was immaculate.  Perhaps best of all, the location was perfect - a very nice, quiet neighborhood but centrally located and easy to get anywhere we wanted to go.  We definitely hope to come back soon.

910784,11788535,2014-04-15,1015403,Cindy,"Brian and Nate are wonderful hosts.  All communication prior to our arrival was quick and easy.  They did a great job of sharing all arrival information in a timely manner.  The communication couldn't have been easier.  

Communication during our stay was also wonderful.  Brian and Nate are really nice guys and my family and I so enjoyed meeting them and chatting with them.  It felt like we were visiting family!  

The 2 bedroom private access accommodation went well beyond our expectations.  It was roomy, immaculate, and perfect for the 5 of us.  Everything we could have wanted or needed was there.  We can't wait to return!

The neighborhood is lovely and so close to bars, restaurants, stores, and groceries.  There is a YMCA around the corner and Brian and Nate provided me with a 3 day pass so I could swim.  

We have used Air B and B  around the world for a few years now, and I can say that this was one of our best experiences!

A million thanks to Brian and Nate.   "
910784,11924132,2014-04-19,6887015,Jude,"My son and I really enjoyed our time in Brian & Nate's Urban Oasis.  The apt is just as it's pictured with lots of little nice touches to make us feel right at home.  There was coffee and a note of greeting waiting for us when we arrived.  We stayed in to watch a movie one night and all the pillows and blankets made the couch nice and cozy.

The neighborhood is easily accessible - we drove all over and never had a problem finding our way back home.  Lots of good restaurants and shops near by.  I won't hesitate to stay here again on my next trip to Seattle.

Brian and Nate live next door and gave us great recommendations for our stay - actually, they were the only hosts we personally met on our trip with airbnb in the US, which was a great pleasure for us! The house is in a quiet neighborhood near a lake with blooming gardens all around - a wonderful place to be espacially in spring when we visited..."
910784,12687805,2014-05-08,1234820,Yanru,Brian and Nate were great hosts and their apartment is exactly as it looks. They answered all my questions very promptly and their neighborhood is a gem with wonderful scenery and walking distance to a major street. Would love to stay there again!
910784,13181760,2014-05-21,3494504,Christine,Brian and Nate were awesome hosts! Their apartment was perfect for my boyfriend's parents. We loved all the little touches of the place and could tell they really went the extra mile. It was a perfect location and they were very friendly and communicative. We will definitely look this place up next time they visit!
910784,13484804,2014-05-28,2415998,Erika,"I needed a place for my mom and her best friend for a few days.  Nate and Brian's place was absolutely perfect.  It was safe, clean, centrally located and they were great with communicating.  I would strongly recommend them to anyone wanting to stay in the Seattle area.  "
910784,14168212,2014-06-13,2242552,Benita,"My boyfriend and I spent two nights in Seattle at Brian & Nate's apartment this June. We had such a wonderful time and the apartment was everything we had hoped for!!! The space is exactly as depicted in the photos - extremely clean, well decorated, cozy and well maintained. They have done an excellent job with this space. I was so impressed! They had tons of information and maps available for us to use to get around town. While we did not have a car during our stay, the commercial section of Capitol Hill was within walking distance, where we found excellent restaurants and shops and one morning we walked a little further to downtown Seattle. Brian and Nate were very responsive, getting back to my messages almost immediately, we even had time to meet them in person. They were very welcoming and accommodating! Even when our flight was canceled and we ended up having to stay an extra night in Seattle, we reached out to see if the space was available and while it was not, they offered to help in any way they could. We greatly appreciated that. I would highly recommend staying at Brian and Nate's home. If we are back in Seattle we 100% will as well!!"
910784,14219616,2014-06-15,252069,Frances,"We had a wonderful booking experience and stay.  B&N's communications were very quick, friendly, and detailed.  I was so pleasantly surprised that their Urban Oasis was located in an adorable residential community with a small commercial street within walking distance with cafes and boutiques.  They are located close to the beautiful Washington Park Arboretum where we walked after having a meal at a cafe.  We went for my daughter's UW graduation, and the nearby 48 bus took us straight to the campus.  The apartment itself is beautifully decorated, modern, comfortable, and extremely clean.  I will also mention the thick white fluffy towels!  I also thought is was cool that, upon entering, we were greeted by a ""virtual aquarium"" on their flatscreen TV!"
910784,14350693,2014-06-17,14883324,Jananne,"Brian & Nate were great.  Very gracious and completely available to us.  The apartment was beautifully decorated.  Great beds/good linens/great towels.  Wish it were bigger, but great deal for price."
910784,14467567,2014-06-20,13969606,Mark,"We really enjoyed our stay at Brian and Nate's place! It was close enough to downtown to easily get to where we wanted to go but also felt like it gave us the ability to escape to a more quiet place and relax at the end of the day. Brian and Nate were wonderful hosts, they quickly responded to any questions that we had and gave us all of the information that we needed.  The apartment was very clean and well appointed for the needs of our family of 4.  We had enough room so that we could do something in the living room together or escape to one of the bedrooms to read alone.  Another note about the bedrooms, the beds were wonderful.  So comfortable that you hated to get out of them in the morning.  I would not hesitate recommending this property.  Wonderful, accommodating hosts with a quiet, relaxing home.  What more do you need ?"
910784,15045974,2014-07-01,15525386,Trevor,We had a wonderful experience. The suite was perfect. Great location. Great hosts. Would definitely stay there again!

Very good!"
910784,15305124,2014-07-07,7772399,Cameron,"Brian and Nate have the most lovely home in Seattle. It is in a beautiful neighborhood with lush gardens, friendly neighbors, and within walking distance of most everything in Seattle.

My fiancé and I traveled with two of our friends to Nate and Brian's place for a long weekend on 4th of July. We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Nate and Brian's urban oasis. It is clear that they take great pride in their home and making sure that all of their guests feel welcome and comfortable. Everything is extremely clean, organized, and well maintained. We could not have asked for a better place to stay for a long weekend. 

Thanks for a great weekend, Nate and Brian!"
910784,15487893,2014-07-10,14604964,MaryAnne,"We really enjoyed our stay.  The neighbourhood is very convenient to downtown, and the Capital Hill area has lots to offer.  Our accommodation was very comfortable and cozy.  Our hosts provided all the little extras that make a stay very enjoyable like assorted toiletries as well as tea and coffee.  Our girls loved the DVD collection as well as Netflix.  Our hosts, Brian and Nate are gracious and warm.  I would definitely come back for another stay."
910784,15666404,2014-07-14,11633755,John GORDON,Stayed and Brian and Nate's BnB in July for 4 nights with my wife and adult daughter so two bedrooms was required. Very pleased with the accomodations. Was clean and neat. Had use of coffee maker and kettle which was very convenient. Also had travelled for 6 days straight prior to date so the use of the washer and dryer was greatly appreciated. Had a rental car and parked legally on the street right in front of bnb. Less than 10 minutes away from downtown Seattle. Brian and Nate suggested some breakfast and dinner spots and we followed their recommendation and had great dinners and breakfasts on outside patios for every meal. Also a great ice cream shop Molly Moon's down the road for your sweet tooth. Quiet neighbourhood and we would definitely book again with Brian and Nate.
910784,15858516,2014-07-17,12401516,Kah Yoke,"Walking into Brian & Nate's was quintessentially airbnb: coming to live in a friend's home. The keyless entry and sensible layout was foremost convenient and straightforward, along with ample necessities for power, laundry, heating/cooling, toiletries, kitchen and entertainment (books, an iPod dock, Wii [w/ Netflix, Hulu etc., all you need even if you're there to stay in all day!], DVDs, WiFi.
Kitchen and living area is slightly tight for gatherings and major cooking but the uber comfy beds more than make up for it.
Then there's the little touches that make it all the more wonderful: a little welcome note, sweets, some fridge supplies, the faux fireplace on the tv which goes a long way to show that Brian & Nate goes the extra mile and really cares about your comfort; not just a transaction of services.

Would have loved to meet them but unfortunately we spent most of our time out; they took pains to ask after our experience and even during our stay.

Highly recommended, looking forward to be back!"
910784,16196415,2014-07-23,12484336,Laura,"Nate and Brian were excellent hosts! They were both friendly and personable, helpful in regards to tips about the city when we inquired, but respected our privacy. Aside from the comfy furnishings and the awesome little speakers for playing music on your iPod or through Bluetooth, the apartment had every little thing you might want when traveling down to the Q-tips and even a DVD collection if you end up with a little down time and wanna just relax.  

My friends and I would def return to Nate and Brian's apartment if we travel to Seattle again!! :) "
910784,16308119,2014-07-25,9504589,Thomas,"We felt very welcomed arriving at Brian & Nate's apartment. Everything is self explanatory and the apartment was comfortable for the four of us. The apartment is located in their house, at ground level. The neighborhood is residential, very green and quiet, and it's only a 7 minutes walk to Safeways if you need to buy groceries. Our hosts kindly let us use their gas barbecue for two nights, which we found very nice."
910784,16543530,2014-07-29,13919012,Ashlan,"I unfortunately didn't get to meet Brian and Nate due to an extremely busy itinerary, but I had a great experience staying in their apartment. They were communicative and readily available in the days leading up to my arrival in the city, and provided detailed information about transportation and how to get into the house.  Their description on airbnb does not do the place justice! The tidy 2-BR apartment is in impeccable shape, and I was thrilled to find it well-stocked with toiletries, fluffy towels, washing machine/dryer, and a full-sized fridge. I was able to cook most of my meals on the portable range that they provided (a huge money-saver). There was even a sweet welcome note on the kitchen chalkboard and some leftover city passes that hadn't expired yet - majorly nice! N & B responded to all of my messages and requests for information promptly. I give these hosts and their wonderful, well-kept apartment my highest recommendation."
910784,16702889,2014-08-01,10473218,Jenny,"We had a fantastic time staying at Brian and Nate Foster's place in Seattle. The apartment has everything you need, it's clean, well designed and the location is perfect. The apartment is located in a quiet neighborhood and and easy walk to downtown."
910784,17035441,2014-08-06,2022624,David,"We (two couples) stayed at Brian & Nate's for 3 nights.
The communication with Brian and Nate was perfect. The apartment itself was as described although the picture of the kitchen might be a bit misleading, only two people can eat there. It was clean and well equipped. We could cook our own dinner.

The neighborhood is quiet and you can walk to Lake Washington. Downtown is easily reachable by car. We haven't tried public transit. "
910784,17197877,2014-08-09,13322831,Lulu,Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful.  The house was tidy and comfortable as well as having a lovely decor. The neighborhood was cool and very walkable.
910784,17738212,2014-08-17,2667049,Carol,"The place was well prepared when we arrived and fully equipped with everything you need for a short-term stay.  My daughter loved their ""welcome"" chocolates in the kitchen.  As I had a lot of mail packages being delivered to their address during our stay, Nate and Brian were so kind to pick them for us and leave them inside the house.  The location of this place is excellent especially after we found out that it is only a few blocks from our favourite restaurant find in Seattle--- The Harvest Vine.  Everywhere we go, it seems they are within 5-10 minutes driving distance.  Highly recommend Nate and Brian's home. "
910784,17992950,2014-08-20,10842827,Steffi,"Wir hatten einen tollen Aufenthalt in Nate´s und Brain´s 2BR. Es war alles vorhanden, was wir benötigten. Nate (Brain haben wir leider nicht kennengelernt) war sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Wohnung war sehr sauber und ruhig. Besonders gefallen haben uns die kleinen Aufmerksamkeiten, wie das frische Wasser, die kleine Schokolade und der Willkommensgruß. Wir kommen gerne wieder :)"
910784,18233723,2014-08-24,5567556,Rena,"We enjoyed the apartment very much. It was in a good location and we were able to get buses easily. We walked to the nearby area, with many cool restaurants. "
910784,18645524,2014-08-30,13676533,Margaret,"We (couple and 2 teenagers) had a wonderful 1st experience with airbnb, thanks to our wonderful hosts! The space was even better than we anticipated. It was immaculate and included everything we needed plus extras (including martini-making and -serving supplies!). The neighborhood was great with easy access to public transportation and within walking distance to several necessities (coffee shop, frozen custard, supermarket, restaurants). The kids enjoyed the collection of movies and wii games. We were visiting for a week and were able to eat many meals ""at home"" in the eat-in kitchen or on the lovely patio. Nate and Brian were helpful with suggestions for Seattle activities and for getting around town. They were very accessible before we arrived and during our visit.

Here are some of the great things about this apartment: it is extremely well stocked (washer & dryer, dishes, game console, towels & linens, iron & ironing board, hair dyer, etc.) and nicely decorated. It easily accommodated our family of four by using the futon as a bed. It would also accommodate 2 couples easily. There is privacy as well as a gathering space. It was a very comfortable place to spend a week, and we all agreed we could have stayed longer.



Seattle is a wonderful place to visit; there is so much to do - arts, sports, nature, restaurants, history. The favorites for our family: Mariners' game, whale watching, Underground Seattle tour, Space Needle. 
"
910784,18936606,2014-09-03,10415473,Kerry,"We enjoyed a wonderful stay. The unit had everything we needed and was in a great neighbourhood and location.
Communication from the host was always very prompt. I would certainly recommend the unit to anyone wanting a home away from home stay in Seattle."
910784,19462960,2014-09-13,17959733,Jia Han (Serena),Wonderful house with everything! It looks better than the photos. Good location. Definitely recommend staying here! 
910784,19731014,2014-09-17,18642736,Aimee,I stayed at Brian & Nate's apartment with my brother and sister-in-law for a short vacation to Seattle.  The apartment was clean and well-equipped and perfect for the three of us.  We appreciated the quiet neighborhood and found it definitely walkable to the grocery store and a few restaurants nearby. We were out and about most of the time but it was nice to have a quiet place to relax after a long day of sightseeing. I would definitely recommend it to others.
910784,19820027,2014-09-19,17896761,Barbara,The home is located at the bottom of a hill in almost the neighborhood of Capitol Hill.  Much to my surprise we didn't realize how hilly Seattle is and how challenging it was to drive in the City.  For the convenience and peace of mind we took a cab to all the major sights in Seattle from this great location and I would highly recommend it to all those who have difficulty walking up and down hills. 
910784,20274003,2014-09-27,2275914,Brittany,"Literally you walk through the door to this apartment and automatically feel like Brian and Nate have created your home away from home! Three of us travelled to Seattle and comfortably fit in the space not to mention THE BEDS WERE COMFORTABLE (which is huge when traveling)!! There were local guides, Brian & Nate's go-to spots, coupons, maps, TONS of DVDs, Netflix, Wii, Hulu etc ... all you could ask for and more from a ""hotel concierge"" to discover this amazing city! We rented a car for the first 3 days, and then hopped on the super convenient & walking distance bus route. Uber (the car share app) also became our best friend in Seattle for cheap quick rides here & there. Kitchen was not an issue with the space and having access to the outdoor grill was a great help. LOTS of closet and drawer space. The washer and dryer makes life easier not having to travel with dirty clothes, always a plus! :) Oh, ALSO ... the garbage in Seattle is a dream - steps from the front door are individual bins for composting, recycling, and garbage. 

Nate & Brian prove that they too have traveled and understand that the little things go a long way - the sweet chalkboard welcome note, the local guides, little chocolate sweets, more than enough towels & blankets. Staying on E Olive St was nothing but a treat for us, and we DID NOT want to leave!

Our advice... for the price, the location, the quaint neighborhood, the upgrades, the wonderful environment, knowing that your hosts genuinely care about your comfort level... look no further for an outstanding apartment to call home during your travel to AMAZING Seattle.

The little cafes at Madrona were handy, good and an easy walk especially if you went via Union St where the hills are easier. Thanks also for all the DVDs. We watched one after a long day out."

910784,22788093,2014-11-15,11180728,Yanni,"Stayed at Brian and Nate's with a friend.  We were drawn to the fact that their place had two separate rooms.  Both rooms had very comfortable double beds and also the rooms were a decent size. There was also the option of a sofa bed.  The bathroom was slightly on the small side, however it did the job and was clean.
Location of the apartment is on a peaceful street about 5-10mins drive or 25mins walk.
We met Brian & Nate briefly and they were very helpful with any questions we had and if we required anything we could just text them and we would get a response almost instantly.
Very happy with the stay!"

910784,25766988,2015-01-25,2192778,Jayson,"Brian and Nate have a fantastic place! It's the lower level of a really cute house, but don't let that scare you, it's on a grade so there are plenty of full size windows to let light in.  The place is decorated immaculately, they have a great eye for interior design and space layout.  The kitchen is a little on the small side, but very functional and space efficient.

Brian and Nate when over the top to make sure we were happy in the place.  We had a change in our plans and had to say another night and they coordinated everything to make sure it won't be a problem.  Thanks so much guys!"

When we first reached their house, it was at night, and it was kinda hard to find the house in the dark. Luckily they told us specific descriptions about the house and how to get to the address. The room was small than I thought, but it had everything you needed and wanted. Those two bedrooms were cozy and sweet, I really like those movies on shelves, all of them are my types. We also played the Wii games at the last night, that was awesome. Overall, I enjoy the time in the little house, and would recommend to my friends if they need. "

910784,32111963,2015-05-14,29482858,Joe,"My partner and I stayed in Brian and Nate's home for 6 days and have nothing but positive things to say about our stay!  The home was very clean, organized and well stocked with everything we could have needed.  The appliances were all new and in great condition.  The kitchen and bathroom fixtures were also new and clean.  The home is in a nice neighborhood that was quiet and near a bus stop, a grocery store, and many good restaurant/café options.  It was also very close to downtown, where we visited almost daily.  Brian and Nate had great communication.  They were always expedient to respond to any emails that we sent them.  They're also some of the nicest and most respectful people!  Overall our expectations were definitely exceeded and we highly recommend Brian & Nate's place. "
910784,32967777,2015-05-24,28628973,Isabel,"The hosts were out of town, but from the email exchange we knew we could send them an email or contact the neighbors upstairs. The listing was accurate.  The neighborhood felt like home. The place was perfect for our trip."
910784,33671625,2015-05-31,30397368,Michelle,"Fantastic place, just as described. Great location with easy access to bus stops and Safeway. Thoroughly enjoyed the stay here, highly recommend for others. Uber to or from the city centre less than $20. Thanks Brian and Nate!"
910784,34279802,2015-06-07,5437191,Ann,Great little place in close proximity to many things. Great location! We rented a car and was able to park easily on the street and get around towns. Great place for the 3 nights that we were there. 
910784,35291380,2015-06-17,26211429,Christine,"This is a comfortable, clean small 2 BD condo. Host provides coffee, tea and all kitchen utensils needed for any short stay. The beds are comfortable. Others have written the location is close to attractions, implying you can walk easily to restaurants, attractions, downtown, etc. I did not find this to be the case. The condo is about 2.5 miles from downtown and therefore transportation is needed. You have to walk about 15 minutes to get to any restaurants. But there are a number of convenient bus stops nearby, which can get you anywhere downtown. A Taxi ride from the airport cost us $50.  I found calling the Metro bus co easier than trying to figure how to use the buses online. Their instructions on where to walk to find the bus are confusing online. Everyone I spoke to at Metro was helpful. "
910784,35642470,2015-06-21,27321530,Marianna,"Very nice 2 bedroom in a quiet area. The place was super clean. Lots of movies for the whole family to watch. It's walking distance to restaurants, bars and supermarket. From the apartment, Pike Street Market  and the Pier is about 2.5 miles away - so still walkable."
910784,36167077,2015-06-26,1197414,David,"Brian and Nate's apartment was the perfect spot to get away from the excitement of Capitol Hill, while still being a close walk to many of the best restaurants, bars, and parks in the area. The apartment was very comfortable and had many amenities that made it a seamless second home while in Seattle. While I didn't have a chance to meet Brian and Nate, they were proactive and friendly in their communication and made the process extremely easy and welcoming. I'd recommend them apartment for anyone looking for a space in which to live like a true Seattle resident. "
910784,37549283,2015-07-08,21152871,Frank,Their place was close to everything but far enough from the all the noise. 
910784,37950017,2015-07-12,29204677,Susan,Brian and Nate made us feel very welcome. We kept in touch by email as I didn't want to disturb them in another time zone. they really seem to care about their guests. 
910784,39260988,2015-07-22,12231162,Isabel,"Die Kommunikation mit Brian & Nate war unkompliziert, alles hat zuverlässig geklappt, obwohl wir sie nicht persönlich kennen gelernt haben. Das Haus & die Umgebung sind sehr schön & ruhig.
In der Wohnung hat es alles, was man braucht, aber für 4 Personen fanden wir es doch etwas zu eng und auch ein wenig dunkel."
910784,39604722,2015-07-25,28946496,Julia,"The place was ideal for a safe, affordable location with the comforts of home. Comfortable beds, quality linens, small touches like great coffee and milk, many guidebooks and info for travelers ... a great place to stay with easy access to transit to get downtown. We brought our kids, and the access to laundry and the ability to cook a homemade meal was great. Very good communication with the hosts too."
910784,40320074,2015-07-30,32541752,Brad,"Brian & Nate have a great place in the heart of Seattle. It's clean, cozy and has a nice layout. It was a short drive to all the places in the city we were wanting to check out and had several nearby bars and restaurants that you could walk to. It has plenty of space with enough to comfortably fit a group of four or five people. I would definitely recommend it!"
910784,41189966,2015-08-05,27690262,Sylvie,"Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour dans l'appartement de Brian and Nate. Le quartier est très calme et proche du centre.

910784,41335117,2015-08-07,30449148,Stephanie,"Brian and Nate were very accommodating and allowed us to drop our luggage off before check-in time.   The apartment is a good size, and the beds are very comfortable.  Having a washer/dryer in the unit was definitely a plus!"
910784,42250740,2015-08-12,10084498,Marianne,This place was very clean and within 12 mins or so of the downtown which was perfect for us! 
910784,42823698,2015-08-16,30436279,Jaime,My family and I enjoyed our stay at Brian and Nate's place. We have two sons and we were able to keep them entertained with the various games and systems that were present. Everything we would need was there. We will happily stay again. =D
910784,43602561,2015-08-21,24142443,Raz,Easy transaction for our stay. Brain & Nate place was very clean and comfortable and well appointed and exactly as listed.
910784,44106762,2015-08-24,13464996,Tash,"The apartment was in the perfect location. Only a few minutes drive to downtown Seattle. There was plenty of parking on the street. The apartment was very nicely equipped with amenities and the beds were comfortable. The neighborhood was lovely but hilly. Brian & Nate communicated wonderfully leading up to our visit, giving good instructions for our stay. The cost was very reasonable. Overall, this was a fantastic experience with Airbnb."
910784,44633896,2015-08-28,27170694,Roberto,"The apartment is in a great location. Only 20 minutes bus ride from downtown Seattle. The neighborhood has some lovely restaurants.  The apartment was very clean and had some very nice amenities, The beds were very comfortable. Brian & Nate communicated wonderfully leading up to our visit and gave spot on instructions about our stay in a timely manner. Overall, this was a awesome first experience with Airbnb."
910784,44881695,2015-08-30,26992139,Mary,Brian and Nate's apartment was adequately described with plenty of comfortable space for two couples. The apartment was fully stocked with necessary amenities. The upstairs tenants promptly greeted us upon arrival and allowed us to drop off our luggage prior to check in which was greatly appreciated. Overall a great little place to call your temporary home.
910784,45550160,2015-09-04,15285641,Omar,The place was impeccable. The proximity to UW and downtown made it very easy to get to the action. In addition the booking experience was great with these guys. 
910784,46265928,2015-09-09,9052302,Keith,"Brian and Nate were really good about communicating - fast to respond, gave helpful tips, even followed up about potentially checking in early. 

The apartment still gets good natural light even though it's garden level. The floors get a bit cold since they're concrete, but there are rugs to help. The location is about a mile from Capital Hill and 2 miles from downtown (the Space Needle and the market). Surrounding neighborhood is nice and quiet, with a few nearby cafes and bars and restaurants.

The wireless was fast and didn't give any issues. Washer and dryer were handy for doing laundry. The doors don't go all the way down to the floor and the walls/ceiling are thin - you can clearly hear the TV, footsteps and conversations upstairs so if you want total quiet, you probably want to look elsewhere."
910784,46602041,2015-09-12,39762654,Anna,"Nothing but great times on my recent Seattle trip, starting with Brian and Nate's excellent communication throughout the booking process.  Everything was as expected when we arrived and we had no problems whatsoever.  Apartment is cute and very close distance to lots of amenities; short drive to everything on our radar.  "
910784,47621582,2015-09-21,25583591,G,We had a pleasant stay the house was very comfortable and the neighbors was very friendly. The neighbors upstairs even let us borrow a ice chest. I would stay here again.
910784,48349090,2015-09-25,16579299,Penn,"Apartment was fantastic! Great neighborhood, exactly as described, I was thrilled with the experience. Thank you Brian and Nate! "

910784,49059309,2015-09-30,27566059,Bibo,This is a nice place to stay and close to a lot of things.  Bedrooms are spacious and comfy. Brian and Nate is very helpful to resolve any issue coming up quickly and we appreciated it.

910784,50176132,2015-10-10,41376850,Sadie,"We had a wonderful experience with our 1st time traveling with airbnb from booking to checking in. Brian and Nate were quick to respond to our inquiries and they provided transportation details of getting to their place and area information before we were there. Apartment was super clean, we had everything we needed. They left us a personal welcome note in the kitchen and mint by the bed. So sweet..."
910784,50496302,2015-10-12,42854755,Maël,Everything as described. Perfect for two couple weekend stay.
910784,51262263,2015-10-19,31231485,Maira,"Brian & Nate and their apartment were absolutely perfect from booking to check-out. We (3 people) were looking for something comfy, spacious, and close to everything, as this was our first ever trip to Seattle. The entire place was nice and clean (linens, kitchen, bathroom, floors, beds, etc.). The location is beautiful, quiet, and  safe. We were always able to find parking right in front. The unit had all of the basics, plus it also has a great selection of DVD's and books.  Brian & Nate, you have awesome taste in movies and literature. FYI, your Prisoner of Azkaban copy is missing... and even though that's my fave in the series, I promise it was not me. "
910784,51755828,2015-10-24,44944346,Heather,Home was just as described.  It is close to downtown and a very quiet neighborhood.  I look forward to a future visit!

They were very prompt to confirm our reservation and to also check on us to make sure we had everything we need.  We highly recommend this home and will definitely be back our next stay in Seattle.  Thank you to Brian and Nate for making our busy weekend relaxing and enjoyable."
910784,53375793,2015-11-08,541006,Liz,"Brian and Nate were quick to respond to all my questions (within minutes!) which made checking in easy! The place itself is exactly like the photos and the description is extremely accurate. I also like the little touches, such as the framed instructions on how to use the TV, wifi password, guidebook, etc..it was very helpful to have. It was fairly quick for us to get downtown and there are many great restaurants in the area within walking distance (if it's not raining it would be a really nice walk). I would highly recommend this place! "
910784,54854433,2015-11-25,12906084,Dylan,"Brain and Nate were very accommodating to me prior to us arriving, when we had arrived, and were very easy to communicate with! The place was a great location and very nice. We had an amazing stay in Seattle, Brian and Nate's place made it better!"
910784,57872242,2015-12-30,6823554,Nahma,Our hosts communicated extremely well throughout - were prompt and thorough in their responses and anticipated our needs. The accomodations were comfortable and accurately described. Neighbohood was lovely and convenient to all we wanted to do in Seattle.
6479027,35712212,2015-06-21,33189001,Mandy,"This is the first time that I use Airbnb to book accommodation. The house of Justine is very nice and comfortable, and Justine is nice and hospitality. It seems that we stayed at home during the 3 days. It's also  convenient that there're supermarket and restaurants nearby. Mandy"
6479027,36074578,2015-06-24,32934167,Inga,Justine was a great hostess. She was able to accommodate our visit on very short notice. The rental was clean and felt very private. Thank you again Justine! 
6479027,36352820,2015-06-27,36573914,Cat,"Justine was a super helpful and relaxed host. Her place is tidy, clean and inviting. Her housemate was welcoming and fun to chat with, and there was ample space for everyone in the house. The bus to Seattle centre was frequent, fast and easy :) highly recommend :)"
6479027,36495610,2015-06-28,36573914,Cat,Have reviewed previously - great host and house :)
6479027,38077183,2015-07-12,37942565,Michelle,We stayed at Justine's Townhome for a few days while in town for a wedding. Her Townhome is very comfortable and in a great location. We had quick access and short drive into downtown and the neighborhood is quiet at night. Justine did a great job to make sure we had everything we needed and her roommate was really nice and helpful. We had a great stay!
6479027,38779182,2015-07-18,34706864,Gordon," I am a boy, twelve years old. I found the house in Airbnb. so I went to Justina' house with my Mam and Dad. J's house is very quiet, and the car can be parked on the edge of the house safely. Mother also can do delious food for me every day. J is a good, kind host. She has a son like an angle. This experience of Airbnb makes us feel happy.the Thank you."
6479027,39340234,2015-07-22,20480316,Richard,"Justine was very quick to respond by text throughout my 3-day stay - a great help when I managed to lock myself out! 

I found the entry just fine on arrival with great directions and a compete & accurate ""manual"" of where and how things were. The off street entry actually adds a sense of security if there were any concerns (I had none) in the area.

The 3rd floor bedroom would be cramped for two people and bags, but the availability of the 2nd story kitchen and living area makes all the difference so it ends up being cozy and workable at same time. The house is clean and lived in at the same time: the second floor is shared.

Neighborhood appears low key and grocery and other services are a drive away, like 1-1/2 miles to Safeway. Quiet. A bit off the main roads for sure, but it was convenient for my purposes in West Seattle and pretty easy access to main byways."
6479027,39992237,2015-07-27,37739939,Julianne,Justine's place is right next to the highway so it's easy to get anywhere in Seattle easily (in a car).
6479027,57959508,2015-12-30,51492349,Zhipeng,"Justine was very hospitable. My family felt just like at home during the entire stay. She gave us detailed instructions on how to get to her house, invited us to use the living room and the kitchen, and stayed around to help even if it was Christmas. Everything was well prepared, exactly the same as the description of the listing. We enjoyed great privacy. The community is always very safe here."
6479027,58256239,2016-01-01,51078137,Amber,"The room was nice and Cozy. The Bed was perfect. Slept like a baby. The Location was perfect,easy to get on freeways.plenty of street parking. This was our first airbnb experience. We liked having our own floor with bedroom and bathroom. That's all we needed for a quick trip to Seattle. When we visit Seattle again we would book again. "
6644796,40655957,2015-08-01,3046293,Benjamin,"Joy made me feel right at home. She was there to greet me with the two cats and told me all the (minimal) stuff I'd need to do for their health and well being over a very last minute and extended stay. In addition to offering (and delivering on said offer) to swing by a couple times to take care of cat stuff (much appreciated) she was also kind enough to point me at all the cool stuff in her neighborhood. The neighborhood is quiet and comfortable, the list price is affordable for a relatively large and super comfy apartment and overall it was a joy to stay there. Hopefully I'll have the pleasure of staying at Joy's again the next time I visit."
6644796,41475036,2015-08-07,37177921,Jeanne,This was my first airbnb experience and I can't imagine it going any better. Joy was absolutely wonderful during the whole process from booking to our departure. Her apartment was wonderful and in a great area of Capitol Hill. I would definitely try to stay at her spot for my next Seattle adventure. Thanks for everything Joy!
6644796,42170237,2015-08-11,38403315,Karen,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I was very pleased with our first experience. Joy responded to all my questions in a timely manner and made me feel very at ease with her clear & detailed answers. I traveled with my fiance and we were greeted by Joy at the apartment. The space was eclectic and great for two guests! She gave us a quick tour and was also nice enough to give us a few suggestions for dinner and made us aware of the closest bus routes. Plenty of room for luggage/bags. She made the walk in closet available to use and there was a great sitting space. Bed was super comfy and AC worked great (we came from the south and learned that many apartments didn't have AC so we were super thankful for that, lol). The refrigerator was clean and she left us enough room for our own leftovers and groceries. Description of the apartment was accurate. We fell in love with the neighborhood!!! It was the perfect area and within walking distance of convenience stores, grocery stores, restaurants/cafes, and bars. Again, great experience at ""Bohemian Artist's Casita!"""
6644796,46943063,2015-09-14,3946604,Vince,Joy was an excellent host and a total sweetheart. Her apartment was the perfect place to explore Seattle and get a feel for what it's like to live there. I would stay at Joy's place in a heartbeat if I were to visit again.
6644796,54165376,2015-11-16,4734546,Eva,"Joy was great -- very helpful and her studio is very cosy, comfortable and in a great location. The apartment and street it's on is really quiet and the location is great. Warmly recommend for all those looking to stay close to the buzzing Capitoll Hil but while staying in a quiet place."

It was charming, in a nice neighborhood, clean and the accommodations exceeded our expectations. The views at this home are fantastic, our only regret is that we couldn't stay longer. We will definitely stay here again if we come back to Seattle in the future.  "
4485424,23456762,2014-12-01,11639591,Adam,"Our family really enjoyed the View Home. It has amazing views and we felt right at home. The location is in a quiet neighborhood in a central location, easy to get to. The three bedrooms provide tons of space. It was the perfect home base for our family of 5. "
4485424,23845452,2014-12-12,4810065,Trey,"The home was beautiful, perfectly located near Seattle for a quick trip into the city, but quiet enough to get some rest!

The neighbourhood was quite and the views were amazing, very convenient to catch any buses getting to downtown Seattle as well. 
Kerry was very communicative and got back to me soon after I sent him any messages. Additionally, he was very kind that he even offered to pick up the laundry and finished them for us while there hasn't been a laundry room set up at the house yet. 
Booking, check-in and check-out were very easy. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone and would book it again myself when I ever come back to Seattle next time! "
4485424,24425986,2014-12-28,11462543,Regina,"Kerry's house was exactly as described. It was a lovely, charming house in a wonderful neighborhood with stunning views. He was communicative from the get go, and even went out of his way to acquire a pack and play for our baby. "

They were incredible in communicating ahead of time and took the time to make our stay easy (especially with a baby). They set up a pack n play and had baby shampoo. They really went above and beyond. 

The house is wonderful and inviting and the view is breathtaking!  We will definitely come back. "
4485424,28002515,2015-03-16,24305375,Lola,"Kerry and Shari were good communicators , they always answer my questions quickly, and they were so sweet to prepare all the things we need, and put a welcome sign in the ketchen. Although it was raining all day when we stayed there, we still had a nice experience in the house. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful, we could see the space needle from the top floor balcony, the view was amazing especially at night. It will be highly recommended."

Kerry was an excellent host; we felt welcomed and cared for. A pak-n-play was waiting for our daughter and she had a great time going up and down (and up...and down) the stairs inside and out.  Instructions were clear for using items in the home and check-out instructions were minimal and easy to follow. 
A very ""Seattle"" location, neighborhood, and view for those visiting from out of town. Highly recommended!"
4485424,28579491,2015-03-26,29332877,Giselle,Kerry's place is absolutely beautiful. It is very clean and well furnished. The view is breath-taking. The kitchen had all we needed and the house is very spacious. Will absolutely recommend this place!

The setting is beautiful and so close to Seattle but at same time close to Discovery Park and other parks and points of interest
After long holiday in Alaska and Canada our chill out in Seattle was enticing
Cant recommend View Home more to all 
Thank you again Kerry "
4485424,35060328,2015-06-15,26187369,Jeff,"Kerry & Sherry were great hosts.  Our first time to Seattle and the location was close to all of the major attractions.  House is exceptional.  Beautiful everything including a master suite upstairs, awesome shower and jet tub, and incredible views from the deck.  Thanks for the great experience!"
4485424,35631787,2015-06-21,10572742,Clifton,The house was beautiful and very clean. The location was great and the hosts were very responsive. I'd definitely recommend them!
4485424,36654337,2015-06-30,28222578,Kim,"A beautiful home  and in proximity to everything that Seattle has offer. We enjoyed the beaches, museums, parks, lakes, and food.  Thank you  for lovely place."
4485424,38094368,2015-07-13,26928438,Katy,"Kerry and Shari are great hosts. The house is kept in perfect condition - the linens, towels, kitchenware etc., all good as new. The kitchen was stocked perfectly with everything you could need and a really nice touch was a basket of toiletries in the bathrooms for any essentials you might have forgotten - a small but super thoughtful and helpful touch. The location is AMAZING. Hilltop view - coffee shop in walk-able distance, a play park for kids two blocks away [that overlooks the city too!], and all major attractions are literally within about 15 mins of the property. You couldn't ask for somewhere better.  We stayed here as a family of 5 - Grandparents and baby inc. and it suited everyones needs perfectly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone who will actually spend time in the vaca home [vs. just needs a place to sleep] as it is warm, homely, well equipped, and close to everything. A wonderful experience. "
4485424,40419343,2015-07-31,26011626,Libby,"The website for this place couldn't begin to capture the charm, comfort, or convenience of this beautiful home.  Not only is it spacious, clean, and convenient, but the majestic view of Seattle at night and Mt Ranier on a crystal clear morning will take your breath away.  We visited during an unusual heat wave and Kerry kindly brought us some extra fans to keep us comfortable.  This was a great find for our family. Couldn't ask for anything better. Many thanks!"
4485424,43017670,2015-08-17,27370013,Cynthia,"This is a lovely home located in a quiet neighborhood, close to Ballard.  There are two decks to enjoy the beautiful views of downtown Seattle.  

We were a family of 5 and very comfortable.  The owners have a house manual that answered all our questions and they are close by if you have any problems.  We would definitely stay here again."
4485424,43908725,2015-08-23,31613783,Pat,"The home was even better than our high expectations.  The quiet neighborhood was very convenient to the areas of Seattle that we wanted to access.  The hosts provided adequate information on the home and the neighborhood without overwhelming us. Plus, the home grown plums they provided were delicious!"
4485424,44514769,2015-08-27,26332004,Carol,What a fabulous way to experience Seattle! Kerry and Shari's home was a total pleasure for our whole family. So open and airy and comfortable! The master suite upstairs is so spacious and has an enormous bathroom and huge closet. Loved enjoying the view of the Seattle skyline and Mt. Rainer from the balcony and roomy deck. Kerry and Shari made us feel so welcomed by their personal homey touches. They even set up a portable crib with a cute monkey toy for our grandson! Thank you for making our family vacation such a pleasure!
4485424,45922720,2015-09-07,16442479,Paul,"Wonderful experience, excellent very thoughtful host, house was perfect for all 6  of us, plenty of amenities, better than 5 star hotel.  
"
4485424,47028673,2015-09-15,20774995,Paula,"The photos of Kerry & Sherry's house are very accurate; the house and it's views are just as pictured. But they don't show everything. There's nothing missing in this house. There were 5 of us and so the owners set up an extra bed in the basement. Didn't know what to expect, but even the basement is really nice with a top of the line queen-sized air bed, plenty of room and it's own bathroom, complete with shower! The master suite is amazing, especially the spa tub. I cannot say enough about how nice and well appointed and well kept this entire house is. They have thought of everything. We had a rental car, but also used the nearby bus service once, and that was a great way to get to the Seattle Center or downtown. The views of the city at night will keep you out on the deck or the terrace, and the neighborhood is quiet but friendly. We were all so comfortable and happy with the house that we wished we could have stayed longer. Next time we travel to Seattle we'll stay here, if it's available, and we'll stay at minimum 2 weeks! Thanks, Kerry & Sherry!"
4485424,47628361,2015-09-21,21644614,Robert,"It was great.  A fabulous home with a great view and even a jacuzzi tub.
All was totally PERFECT.
Owner was very responsive to all questions."
4485424,48689760,2015-09-28,37145226,Thomas,The house was in amazing shape! It was so welcoming. 
4485424,49770317,2015-10-06,38401354,Lauren,"Very welcoming! House was clean, easy to check-in and the location is wonderful!  Hosts were very welcoming and communicative leading up to the trip to make sure we had everything we needed! View from house over downtown is beautiful and this neighborhood is so charming!  We were 4 adults and a two year old.  Would definitely recommend!"
4485424,50274023,2015-10-11,28376930,David,"Kerry was a fantastic, communicative host that personalized our experience and made our families (they were in town for our wedding) feel right at home.  The house was very accommodating--we had four individual parties staying and all were taken care of.  The master suite on the top floor is spacious, private, and extremely comfortable.  Likewise, the basement was large (ensuite bathroom) and accommodated my mother very well.

I would highly recommend the home and would be very happy to book again!"
4485424,51106493,2015-10-18,26318090,Michael,"This is a beautiful location with beatuiful views. Kerry was always quick to respond to questions and very accommodating. The house was well kept, clean and in a very safe and quiet neighborhood. Very close to anything you need. Slept 8 very comfortably with plenty of room. Definitely a superior 5 star experience as I've been using airbnb for a long time. I would definitely book again."
4485424,54850021,2015-11-25,43307249,Sara,The house and experience were fantastic!  The home was beautiful and accommodated us perfectly.  The hosts were responsive to all questions and very helpful.  I would definitely return!
4485424,55184940,2015-11-29,39655203,George,"Great place to stay and the hosts were more than accommodating.  First, the location is great.  Quiet area but close to where you want to be:  Ballard, Fremont and Downtown.  The house easily accommodates 6 and is equipped with everything you need.  Hosts supply those items that you left at home, such as toothbrushes.  One of the small touches that made the stay one that we truly enjoyed.  And, finally, the hosts were more than responsive:  They checked in to make sure everything was ok on arrival; they worked with us so that our Thanksgiving meal was a great success.  We look forward to another visit when we return to Seattle.  "
4485424,57231097,2015-12-23,49106745,Rembrandt,Superior experience all around.  Exceptional home exhibiting lots of care and attention to detail.  Master bedroom spanning entire upper floor has many luxurious appointments.  Fantastic view of Seattle city center.  Hosts are very professional and focused on guests comforts.   Will certainly attempt to book in the future.    
4485424,57868640,2015-12-30,8240756,Rea,"Kerry's home was wonderful!  The location was great; it was a quick drive to the city, but far enough away to offer great skyline views.  The home is beautifully maintained, and was comfortable for my family of five.  The kitchen was well stocked, which allowed my family to cook some meals.  I would definitely return on my next trip to Seattle!"
3533224,15984779,2014-07-19,7535757,Adrianna,"Rosemary and Michael's place was amazing. Beautiful home atop capitol hill. Michael was away so we did not get to meet heel but Rosemary was a gracious and hospitable host. The room is in the basement giving you plenty of privacy, don't worry there's a huge window providing loads of sunlight. 
The star of the house of course was their cat, Avery who is very sweet and playful.
I would strongly recommend staying here. You won't be disappointed."
3533224,16036675,2014-07-20,2092173,Erin,"We had a lovely stay with Rosemary and Michael recently.  We drove up to Seattle for a friendly soccer match and to do some sightseeing.  When we arrived Rosemary was baking banana bread and the house smelled amazing.  It's a good size room with a comfortable bed, clean linen and nice towels left out for us.  They have really made it inviting and left out all sorts of brochures of things to do, extra supplies in case you forgot anything and hooks to hang things.  Rosemary is really sweet and hospitable, we didn't meet Michael!  The indoor cat is super friendly although we accidentally brought the neighbors cat in off the porch thinking it was theirs late at night, oops!  Rosemary was really good about it, she has a fun sense of humor.  We would recommend this as a comfortable, affordable, room in a very central location!"
3533224,16146807,2014-07-22,14568050,Elisabeth,"Our one night stay at Rosemary's and micheals house was great! You get exactly what it shows on the pictures. The room is nice and clean! And with a lot of private space. The house is located in a quiet area but so close to the city!! 
Rosemary (Micheal was not in town) was very friendly and gave us a lot of recommendation :) 
Our flight was leaving late so it was not a problem to leave our luggage at their house for the day, awesome :) 
A great place to stay while visiting Seattle!! "
3533224,16224093,2014-07-23,17776423,Jennifer,"Rosemary was a wonderful host she made me feel welcome both on her home and in Seattle. I enjoyed our conversations, a chance to leave behind my memories of Seattle in pictures and the company of her cat Avery! I was very grateful for the use of laundry facilities as well, having been on the road for over a week with 3 further weeks of travel ahead. "
3533224,16495802,2014-07-28,17792922,R. Matthew,We had the most incredible time in Seattle and Rosemary was such a great host! The apartment is beautiful with a nice garden and small chicken coop in the back - fresh eggs!  It was really easy to walk to Pikes Place market and parking for the apartment was a breeze.  I highly recommend this locale for any Seattle visitor.
3533224,16638803,2014-07-30,18481352,Kiril,Friendly host with awesome cats :)
3533224,16999902,2014-08-05,14107665,Shirish,"We had a wonderful week stay in Seattle with Rosemary and Avery (the house cat) -- our hosts were very friendly and accommodating! We enjoyed Rosemary's travel tips and food recommendations.  She even dropped us off at an amazing freshly made pasta restaurant so we could make it in time! We also enjoyed spending the night watching Rushmore together. 

The house was very clean, comfortable, and charming -- the little post it notes and guest drawings were a nice touch! The room was spacious and afforded us privacy when we wanted. 

The house is conveniently located near the #3 bus which goes to Pike's Place Market and then to Seattle Center where the Space Needle, EMP Museum, and Pacific Science Center are located. We enjoyed eating at the nearby 12th avenue restaurants and walking around the capital hill area. We would love to stay here again when visiting Seattle!"
3533224,17121775,2014-08-07,18843321,Chul,"What a nice room. Although it was pretty warm in Seattle during our stay,  our room in the basement was so cozy and cool.  You can see the sacrifices Beth makes by providing this room for guests instead of the one she uses upstairs so her guests can stay cool. Neighborhood is conveniently located near everything Seattle has to offer. Thank you Beth!"
3533224,17225361,2014-08-09,14285206,Igor,Rosemary was great. The house is very nice and they made every effort to accommodate our daughter. She loved the cat and hens that Rosemary let her touch!
3533224,17374423,2014-08-11,18170481,Natalie,The home was very nice and in a great location. Walking distance to most tourist attractions. Good host and lovely atmosphere. Very cute cat as well!
3533224,17463240,2014-08-12,6203764,Alvina,"Rosemary was a wonderful host who provided us with recommendations in the area, a ton of guidebooks and maps to choose from and fresh towels and linens. The room and home is clean and neat and very central to many cute cafés, restaurants and shops. We had a great time exploring the area. Avery the cat also gave us a friendly welcome :)"
3533224,17778106,2014-08-17,17225332,Angie,"It was a great experience at Rosemary's place. The private room is in the basement, which is clean and cozy. We arrived very late, and it was really nice that Rosemary opened the door for us. Great experience! "
3533224,18141798,2014-08-22,13435248,Patrick,"L'appartement de Rose Mary se trouve dans un quartier tranquille à 1/2 heure à pied du centre ville. Il est propre, agréable et bien tenu . La chambre confortable est au sous sol, les toilettes au RDC et la salle de bain partagée au 1er. Nous recommandons ce pied à terre, qui plus est si vous avez une voiture car Rose Mary prête un badge ""Guest"" pour stationner en face de la maison. Celle ci dispose d'un jardin et d'une terrasse agréable."
3533224,18503751,2014-08-27,1146742,David,"It was fantastic staying at Rosemary and Michael's. Michael was extremely accommodating with our arrival time and we had a few hiccups on the road that didn't get in the way of having a great experience in Seattle. The space was lovely and we wished that we could spend more time there. It would have been nice to stay a few extra days in the neighbourhood. The location is great and not too far from some really amazing eats. Overall, this has been a great Airbnb experience! Thank you!"
3533224,18596417,2014-08-28,17048226,Michael,I'm very happy with my stay with Rosemary and Michael. The room was as described and they were gracious hosts.
3533224,18722716,2014-08-31,17739425,Amanda,"Michael and Rosemary were nice, responsive and accommodating. We arrived on an early flight and Michael was kind enough to ride his bike home about 30 mins to meet us so we could drop our bags off before exploring the city.  The room was well set up with toiletries and other things to make the stay comfortable. The home was very clean and the room was as described! Thanks!"
3533224,19040831,2014-09-05,11162085,Christina,Michael and Rosemary were delightful and welcoming hosts. The bedroom was lovely and the bed was comfortable. A big thank you to Michael for generously giving me a ride to The Hub at 5:30 am! Going above and beyond! I'd stay here again. :)
3533224,19103945,2014-09-06,20419105,Felix,Beautiful clean space.  Rosemary and Michael were super helpful and friendly. Would stay there again when we revisit Seattle!
3533224,19139271,2014-09-07,1485189,Abby,Rosemary and Michael were very welcoming and nice. We enjoyed the basement bedroom as it stayed nice and cool/dark on a hot summer day. Beautiful home in a great neighborhood close to everything. 
3533224,19526200,2014-09-14,18996373,Garseng,"The listing description was very accurate alongside the photos; we got exactly what we were expecting. The space was very nice and clean. The bed was spacious and very comfortable. The room itself is in the basement, so it is kept very cool even when it is warmer outside. You have to go upstairs to take a shower or use the bathroom, and there is only one shower in the house, but it didn't feel cramped. There is also a washer and dryer. 

The neighborhood we stayed in was great. It was quiet, felt safe, and was walking distance from the International District, Capitol Hill, and even Downtown if you're willing to make a little bit longer of a trek. 

Our hosts were great. They were very nice and welcoming, were generous with sharing their kitchen and some supplies, and respected our privacy (but were very willing to talk and give suggestions for things to do when asked). 

Their cats are the friendliest things ever, they love being petted. "
3533224,19877848,2014-09-20,10471362,Jaimie,The basement room was perfect and private. It was not as cold down there as I had read in other reviews. It was actually quite warm the first night. It was a walking distance to everything we needed. Parking was ample as we  had a rental. Didnt really see much of rosemary and michael but when we did they were very pleasant and welcoming. Their cat is a sweetheart too. I'd definitely recommend staying with them.
3533224,20018919,2014-09-22,197615,Cynthia,I had a 10k race in the Seattle area and Rosemary and Michael were quick to respond to my Airbnb request. They even helped me pick up my my race packet for me prior to my arrival since my flight arrived in the evening. =) The description of the room and home was accurate and I found it quite comfy for my short stay. Street parking was not a problem and I was provided a guest residential parking permit so I didn't need to move my car every 2 hours. Instructions on how to obtain the house key were clear and simple. They also left clean towels and a note explaining how to turn on the hot water for showering. I did manage to interact with Rosemary and Michael for a bit which was nice and pleasant. The kitty was also very cute and cuddly. =) 
3533224,20290743,2014-09-27,20331855,Kristopher,"Rosemary and Michael were very welcoming, the room was as pictured and very cozy, and the neighborhood was quiet and safe. Loved our trip to Seattle."
3533224,20652587,2014-10-03,20519985,Travis,"Rosemary and Michael have a frankly lovely flat in a great part of Seattle (I did not know the city before booking, so I was very luck with my choice). The neighbourhood restaurants and shops are excellent and being just a short walk from either Capitol Hill or Downtown Seattle is just perfect. 

The basement room in the flat is marvellous, it is dark, quiet and immensely peaceful. Rosemary and Michael were exceptional hosts, sending me to fantastic bars, restaurants, coffee shop and attractions (and even taco trucks) whenever I was unsure of what to do next. They also are very considerate people, easy to live with and great to get to know. Their cat is super friendly and makes the place feel like home. I could not recommend this Cozy Room in Seattle more highly!"
3533224,20745905,2014-10-05,3319396,Karson,"Michael and Rosemary's room was perfect for our brief stay in Seattle.  We were walking distance to many great places to eat and only a short cab to downtown.  In addition to the comfortable room, we thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Michael and Rosemary.  Great space and fun couple, I highly recommend."
3533224,20926345,2014-10-07,21532847,Tyler,It was a quick stay. I came in later in the evening and left early the next morning. Michael was fabulous and made me feel very comfortable. The house was super clean and inviting. Michael and Rosemary have created a great space to stay. I slept well and appreciated the fresh cup of coffee awaiting me after a morning shower.
3533224,20994283,2014-10-09,6371998,Erin,The house is very tidy and the neighborhood felt very safe with easy street parking.  I adored the cat! He added to already friendly feel of the home and hosts.  The room was quiet for sleeping and working - spacious and neat.  This is exactly what I was looking for when I booked.
3533224,21087106,2014-10-11,20705704,Kwangik,I've enjoyed my stay so much. Detailed experience was explained on the other review.
3533224,21177711,2014-10-12,17597860,Brittany,"Nice basement room in a cute house!!  The room seems newly renovated, with new carpet.  It doesn't even feel like a basement.  While you share a shower with the owners that is two floors up, there is a half bath one floor up.  

Rosemary, Michael (and Avery the cat) were great hosts while I was there! There are loads of maps and little extras (like an umbrella) that came in handy for me during my short stay.  And Rosemary and Michael provided lots of restaurant/bar recommendations in advance.

You are not in the middle of tourist central, but a short distance away.  Between public transport, uber, car2go, and my feet, I was easily able to get everywhere I wanted.

No complaints.  There are a lot of stairs to get up to the house, but this wasn't a big deal for me personally."
3533224,21233747,2014-10-13,20705704,Kwangik,"At first, it felt a little bit long from International district chinatown light rail station because of those ROCK heavy luggages. However as soon as we met Rosemary and her cat, Avery, all the fatigue was gone already. They were so kind to us and the room we stayed was cozy and clean though it was basement room. During the stay, we needed to go to Portland. They kindly allowed us to check in the luggages during that trip. I really appreciated that. I became a fan of Seattle because of the great restaurants at Pike Public Market, Space Needle, and most of all, kind people of Seattle like Rosemary, Michael, and Dana. Hope to see you guys including that outgoing cat next door."
3533224,21617319,2014-10-20,9004470,Matthias,"Rosemary and Michaels place ist just perfect for a weekend in Seattle! It's a quiet area but still in walking distance to downtown, the room is spacious, the bed comfortable, really a great value!"
3533224,21742018,2014-10-23,6371998,Erin,"Once again I had a lovely stay at Cozy Room.  Rosemary and Michael took extra care to make sure the downstairs room was warm enough since the temperature had dropped in Seattle - the room has its own thermostat. Again, plenty of parking, quiet private room, and a warm homey feeling in the midst of my busy days of meetings.  It was exactly what I was hoping for when I booked!"
3533224,22074720,2014-10-29,22099279,Delia,"Rosemary was extremely accommodating in regards to our early arrival from KC. She recommended a great restaurant for lunch and gave perfect directions for nearby shopping and transit. 

We loved how quaint the neighborhood was. We didn't want to be right in the heart of downtown but needed to have access to the Washington State Convention Center. The 3/4 bus line is right up the street from the house and runs every 15 minutes. It was perfect.

The room was exactly as described and Rosemary made us feel right at home. They have a plethora of local information to help guests find the best thing to do during their stay (We added some literature). The house is super cozy and Avery made a great napping buddy. 

Michael was out of town and returned on our last day. He was so helpful in showing me how to use the washer/dryer and lent a helping hand since I was nursing a low back injury. My husband and I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with Airbnb. Thank you so much! :-D"
3533224,22295607,2014-11-03,20028351,Katy,"Rosemary and Michael's home was perfect for our Seattle trip. Located in a quiet and cozy neighborhood, their tri-level apartment offered both privacy for our stay and opportunities to socialize with our hosts and their cat :-) Michael and Rosemary were warm and welcoming, and offered great suggestions for restaurants and activities. Had an awesome time and definitely recommend it!"
3533224,22434587,2014-11-06,14314556,Adam,"We had a wonderful time at Rosemary and Michael's apartment. There is plenty of privacy, the location is great (if you're ok walking 15 minutes), and the cats are the friendliest you'll ever meet. I would definitely stay here again.  "
3533224,22606403,2014-11-10,4337630,Long,"Our hosts, Michael and Rose gave our family a very warmth welcome. The stay was excellent as described. The neighborhood is very accurate to al the local attractions. Would love to stay here again when we have a chance to visit Seattle. "
3533224,22710826,2014-11-12,6371998,Erin,"Rosemary and Michael are lovely, understanding hosts. I have stayed with them now 4 times because of my busy work/travel schedule and they could not be more accommodating!  Again - cannot stress how much I adore the cuddly, quiet, and courteous cat! I loved thinking of my clean room with my own half-bathroom and a kitty on the couch waiting for me after my long work day."
3533224,22829817,2014-11-16,17055854,Antonin,Rosemary and Michael were the perfect hosts. They gave us a warm welcome and made our trip very pleasant. The room offers plenty of privacy and is exactly as advertised. The location was convenient and they provide a guest parking pass to park directly on the street.
3533224,23119660,2014-11-23,20420049,Dongze,"Very comfortable place to live and have rest, I made a great choice to live here for 3 days travel in Seattle. House owner are very nice. Great experience for this trip."
3533224,23574228,2014-12-05,17759274,Fiona And Yang,Rosemary and Michael are always friendly and nice. Our room is also very cozy and quiet. It is convenient to Seattle center and Airport. We have a good talk during our stay and a sweet brunch with them. We really enjoy their host and appreciate it. Avery is so cute. We will choose theirs next time.
3533224,24235893,2014-12-23,23465750,Jenny,"Rosemary and Michael are wonderful and sooo kind. Their kitty cat, Avery, is the such an amazing host. He converted us into cat-lovin folks. Also, Rosemary and Michael are very accommodating and helpful because of our early arrival. They recommended a bunch of good spots to check out. They let us cook and use their spices which is a great plus! The room looks exactly like the pictures. Buses are near their location but we started using Uber cars for everything! The location of the home is okay. Quiet neighborhood. Their home is very lovely and adorable."
3533224,24735456,2015-01-02,23787731,Marie,"We had a great stay with Rosemary and Michael. Everything was exactly as described. The rooms were neat and clean, and our hosts were calm and considerate. They were helpful with whatever we asked. We would recommend this place to everyone!"

3533224,25202320,2015-01-09,23791204,Abigail,"We had very nice experience in Rosemary and Michael's home. I have a lot of thanks to say but time allow us stay only three days. I highly recommend here as the best choice in Seattle. The whole area is so clean. And it's very warm in our basement. Location is great! Easy bus to downtown, pike market. Details like plants make our living really special. I will come to visit as long as I can go to Seattle again.   "
3533224,25468205,2015-01-17,6849015,Marc,"Great hosts, and everything was as described in the listing. The house is very warm and clean, and the hosts are very friendly and genuinely care about their guests. We felt welcomed and enjoyed our stay. We were in the area celebrating our anniversary and the hosts even got us a bottle of wine :) Thanks for the wonderful stay in your fantastic space. Keep up the good work!"
3533224,25816564,2015-01-26,20723369,Jennifer,"Excellent stay with Rosemary and Michael! Our room was nice and clean, equipped with plenty of pillows, towels, closet space, and an iron for us to use. The neighborhood was quiet and in a great location for everything we were looking to do which was basically exploring the city. We didn't arrive the first night until late and after they had gone to bed but we were welcomed by friendly post-its all over their home guiding us to our room, bathroom, and pointing out all the necessary amenities. They were happy to share some fridge space with us and had a great kitchen for our cooking needs. Also, a very comfy bed! They've got some great tour books that we were able to take advantage of too! Definitely recommend these guys- great hosts :)"
3533224,26224536,2015-02-07,2277755,Bridget,"Rosemary and Michael are hospitable, friendly, and great communicators; I felt comfortable and welcome throughout my stay.  Their house is convenient to capital hill, super clean and tidy, and I had a lovely time! "
3533224,26456742,2015-02-13,26470963,Eric,This was a great place to stay. Rosemary and Michael were very friendly and helpful. The room was quiet and private and very nice. I would recommend staying here. 
3533224,26513083,2015-02-14,5251525,John,"Very comfortable room. Excellent bed. Very, very quiet--basement room. Small bathroom (toilet/sink) at top of stairs; full bathroom w/ shower 2nd floor, part of main upstairs living quarters. I stayed only 1 night, didn't use upper BR. Friendly, warm hosts--instructive, pleasant. Wonderful friendly cat (Avery.) (I'm a cat guy.) House is a couple of miles from Seattle center; #3 or #4 bus goes within 2 blocks, but more convenient if you have  a car. I would certainly come back.  The photo is accurate."
3533224,26702189,2015-02-17,24643747,Helena,"Thanks Rosemary and Michael! We felt very welcomed and everything was nice and tidy. Avery, their cat, was such sweetheart as well. It was a great first experience using airbnb. Thank you!"
3533224,26758904,2015-02-18,754736,Joshua,"Rosemary and Michael were great! The place is really nice and clean with a perfect location, and the room is discretely located below grade. I would definitely recommend this place. "
3533224,26853869,2015-02-20,2487546,Cameron,"We only crashed for one short night, so we didn't get to meet Rosemary, but Michael was very friendly and helpful.  The house was very clean and in a nice location as well.  He also gave us a great recommendation for a bar/restaurant."
3533224,26952011,2015-02-22,9892446,Sheila,"Michael was there when I arrived but had left instructions on how to get in if he wasn't there.  He was casual, friendly and helpful as was Rosemary.  I thought the room was actually more comfortable that the pictures indicated.  Loved the cat Avery!  Would be delighted to stay there again.  It was in walking distance of Seattle U where I was visiting my Granddaughter.  The neighborhood felt safe to walk in at night."
3533224,27190379,2015-02-27,28241637,Jiri,"Perfect place! The room is nice and comfortable and you have lots op privacy, since the room is located in the basement of the house, which you will have all by yourself. The house is really beautifully renovated, tidy, clean and fully equiped with everything you need. Though you only rent a room, you can make use of the kitchen and other utilities. Little stickers will help you find everything and make it easy not to use stuff you're not supposed to!
Michael is a nice guy and a good host. He told me a lot of cool places to check out in Seattle. I've seen Rosemary only a very short time, but they make a very cute couple... :-)"
3533224,27630348,2015-03-08,28784490,Jenna,What a wonderful stay it was at Michael and Rosemary's cozy home in Seattle! Neighborhood was very quiet and they are such accommodating hosts. Check in/check out was a breeze due to their kindness and flexible. Room is very comfortable and clean! About a two minute ride into Capitol Hill so great location--would hope to stay with them again and would highly recommend it to fellow AirBnbers! :)
3533224,27898804,2015-03-14,3004379,Rob,Rosemary and Michael's place was perfect for us and they were fantastic hosts. Their beautiful house is a reasonable walk away from the centre of town and there's buses close by too. The room was clean and tidy and both of them were welcoming and fun to chat to. Definitely recommended :)
3533224,28032648,2015-03-16,9348065,Jae Yoon,Had a nice and comfortable stay here! The room is in the basement so it is very private and warm.

3533224,28318494,2015-03-22,10551633,Nathan,"Michael and Rosemary were incredible hosts and I felt they made my brother and I feel extremely welcomed. Upon our arrival, they allowed us to drop our things off early, they provided us with breakfast one morning along with stimulating conversation. The room was super clean, quiet, and comfy. I would highly recommend this spot while in Seattle!"
3533224,28797565,2015-03-30,7401302,Pujashree,"We had a really comfortable stay at Michael and Rosemary's beautiful home. They were super accommodating and welcoming. Our flight in to Seattle was really late, but they made it easy for us to let ourselves in, and get familiarized with the setup with little helpful sticky notes everywhere. We had some lovely chats with them both on our way in and out during our stay about our adventures in Seattle, and Michael gave us some excellent recommendations for restaurants. Avery the kitty was super friendly, and adorable!!
The house is located in the really cozy and quaint First Hill Neighborhood, only a quick bus/Uber ride away from Downtown and Pike Place and such. The room is the basement of the house, with ample space, privacy and is really cozy! All in all, staying with Michael and Rosemary on our first visit to Seattle made it really enjoyable and stress-free!"
3533224,29064641,2015-04-03,16061998,Sandhya,"Rosemary and Michael were extremely welcoming hosts! The room and bathrooms were clean and spacious. The place is in a quiet, residential neighborhood, but still a close walk to restaurants and bars in the Central District and a quick bus ride to Capitol Hill, Pioneer Square. Very convenient and would definitely highly recommend this place!"
3533224,29305146,2015-04-06,28408353,Suniti,"Rosemary and Michael were wonderful hosts to us. They allowed us to check in early to drop off our bags and provided us with some great suggestions during our visit here in Seattle. Our stay here was relaxing and quiet, we truly felt welcomed into their home. My mom and I had a wonderful time and definitely recommend this listing! "
3533224,29639694,2015-04-10,5922659,Margo,"Felt very  welcomed by hosts. Good energy people, neighborhood is quiet and lovely in springtime. I only spent one night, so it went fast. Had an overall good experience. Walked out the door with one of Rosemary's homade muffins...delicious!!  "
3533224,29849987,2015-04-13,18462623,Daniel,"Rosmary and Michael were very welcoming and pleasant hosts who nevertheless respected our privacy, as I suspect they understod we prefered. The accomodations were clean and tidy and full of literature about the Seattle area. The neighborhood is quiet and attractive."
3533224,30101308,2015-04-17,30727349,Jacqueline,"Rosemary and Michael were excellent hosts to my girlfriend and I on our recent trip to Seattle. The room (and house) was cozy, clean, and so welcoming!  Great location as well, we had no trouble getting to and from downtown with our car. Rosemary and Michael also offered a guest parking pass so overnight parking was worry free. 

In addition, they gave us some great recommendations for things to do in the area and food to eat. (we highly recommend borrowing their picnic gear they equipped the room with if the weather is nice!)  

I would highly recommend Rosemary and Michael as hosts to anyone traveling through the area! "
3533224,30321651,2015-04-20,27380006,Peter,"The home was clean and comfortable, and the hosts were excellent. The room was private and spacious, perfect for my weekend trip. The downtown area was not too far away on foot, but public transit was close by as well. The overall experience I had in Seattle was great, in large part thanks to the fact that I had a cozy bed to come back to after a long day's trek over hilly terrain. Expect peace and comfort."
3533224,30435508,2015-04-21,22545000,Audrey,"Rosemary and Michael were the perfect hosts And made our Seattle stay very enjoyable. The room was perfect, there were plenty of guide books for us to look at  and the location of the house was only a bus ride away from downtown Seattle. All in all I would highly recommend a stay here with this lovely couple if you are planning on coming to Seattle "
3533224,31043757,2015-05-01,27508043,菲,The location is very convenient to downtown by the bus no.3 &4. Rosemary and Michael are very warm and feel comfortable staying in their house. 
3533224,31835848,2015-05-10,18945396,David,Warm and welcoming home and hosts.  Well equipped clean suite in a great neighborhood.  Perfect!
3533224,31976316,2015-05-12,17793210,Ma,"Rosemary and Michael welcomed me with great hospitality. The room was lovely! It was neat and tidy, and the bed was very cozy. There was an entire collection of travel guides in the room which were very nice to look at if you do not have an idea where to go in Seattle. Rosemary and Michael provided great recommendations for ""to-go"" places in the city, and they generously let me use their kitchen, which I loved. Plus, the cat was very cute, and elegant in some way. Generally speaking, a great experience."
3533224,32259784,2015-05-16,31233389,Donna,"The home was easy to find and the directions were clear on where to find the key and how to get in.  The room was clean and very comfortable for our one-night stay.  The bathroom upstairs was just a bit small for my 6'3"" boyfriend but then again, so is my car.  We enjoyed the binder and art supplies that encouraged us to leave a remembrance of our trip to Seattle.  Very nice experience, thank you Michael & Rosemary!"
3533224,32775234,2015-05-21,32007352,Jennifer,"Rosemary and Michael made us feel very welcomed and at home immediately! They were very friendly as respectful of our privacy and were more than willing to share their knowledge of the city and neighbourhoods with us.
There are so many little things they did or had set up that were extremely helpful such as little sticky notes everywhere helping to find things, or the amazing shampoo, conditioner, and body wash they graciously had out for us. 
The listing was more than we were expecting, great privacy and the neighbourhood is very central and awesome for commuting to anywhere we had to go, including taking the very short bus ride down town!
We very much enjoyed our stay and getting to know a little bit about both Rosemary and Michael! Oh, and Avery the cat was adorable!"
3533224,32993003,2015-05-24,31479898,Mandy,The place is adorable and Rosemary and Michael were very friendly. They gave us great tips on things to do in Seattle. Our room was very comfortable even with only a full size bed. The shower is a bit tricky with hot water. Avery was the best part of my stay. I would definitely recommend this place!
3533224,33576732,2015-05-30,29754498,June,"it was really cozy, and really good.  The two hosts, Michael and Rosemary are nice ! and the cat was so adorable!!!   if you are planning to trip to seattle, you must go! it wasn't  really hard  to go downtown seattle,  you can take a bus easily. "
3533224,34137625,2015-06-05,32159229,John,"Very nice space, very clean and tidy, comfortable bed.
I enjoyed my brief stay."
3533224,34260555,2015-06-06,16301617,Maria,Great place to stay in Seattle. This is a very quite residential neighborhood with good public transport. Communication was very clear for check. We love the place. 
3533224,34642477,2015-06-10,16339426,Bashar,"Excellent hosts. The house is in a good area, and is well kept. "
3533224,34811221,2015-06-12,33220951,Henry,"I booked with Michael and Rosemary for my visiting fiancé. Unfortunately, my fiance's flight was cancelled and so she never was able to stay over at Michael and Rosemary's place. So, an adequate review cannot be made at this time. What can be said is that Rosemary and Michael had no issues working with me in providing access for my fiancé since she was flying in really late; they were very helpful, professional, and understanding. Perhaps one day I can give a full assessment in staying at Michael and Rosemary's place."
3533224,34948218,2015-06-14,27073928,Jonathan,Rosemary & Michael were very nice & welcoming hosts.Their basement room was exactly as described and perfect for my needs.Rosemary & Michael were also able to allow me to add 1 friend to stay with me on short notice.Their pet cat was nice also.I would choose to stay with them if I come back to Seattle for another vacation in the future.
3533224,35189073,2015-06-15,14662129,Marissa,"A lovely stay with a lovely couple and cute little cat. It's walking distance if you like to wander and explore from most things including cool Capitol Hill, the room is private, and whilst the toilet is upstairs from the room, in the living area, it is practically yours as there is another upstairs. Quiet neighbourhood, comfortable bed, full kitchen access, great value for a Seattle stay."
3533224,35386698,2015-06-18,5672067,Mathieu,"This was our first experience staying in a private room and this turned out to be a really good one in Rosemary and Michael’s home. First, they are both very kind and nice persons. They were very accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. It was also very easy to communicate with them before and during our stay. We enjoyed chatting with them when coming back from our long days out exploring the city. 

The location was perfect for us as we didn’t have a car and public transport was easily accessible. The room itself is in the basement, is of a great size and a window provides good light. The bed was comfy and we had access to everything we needed. We also need to mention that the cute cat Avery was a nice little extra ! 

It was a very enjoyable stay at Rosemary and Michael’s place and a pleasure meeting them. We wish them all the best !
"
3533224,35471359,2015-06-19,32642964,Yoonjung,"This room was awesome. Even though the room was not my room, it was super cozy for me. If I go to the Seattle again, I wanna book here again surely!"
3533224,35781051,2015-06-22,27281009,Karin,"Rosemary and Michael are very nice hosts and we had a great stay at their place. They were helpful and gave us advises of good restaurants and happenings in the city. The room was clean and spacious, a bit dark though. 
The house is in a lovely neighbourhood. 

Close by there's a bus going to the city center but restaurants and shops are not just around the corner.
"
3533224,36066366,2015-06-24,18400084,Charles,"This is the sscond time that I've stayed with Michael and Rosemary.  The room is private, the house clean and the hosts are very accomodating.  Located a short walk from Capital Hill in a quiet neighborhood, I would recommend this airbnd without hesitation.
"
3533224,36230838,2015-06-26,5370026,Karen,"I had a wonderful time in Seattle! Rosemary and Michael have a cute place on a quaint street. 

The room itself is comfortable and secluded in the cool basement. I loved the thoughtful notes they left around the house; they were super helpful when I first arrived on my own. 

To add, their home is conveniently located to a number of bus stops. It takes no more than 25 minutes to get down to Pike Place.

Rosemary and Michael were always prompt to reply. So it was easy to coordinate my arrival and departure.

I would be happy to stay here again! The cat was a great bonus."
3533224,36513743,2015-06-29,29834741,Raymond,"I stayed for 3 nights and 1 day. It was my first time in Seattle and loved every minute of it. The Crawfords were pleasant and made sure I had a comfortable stay. They, including Avery the cat, made me feel welcome. =^.^= I know they had chickens but I didn't even hear a peep from their coop. Anyway, if you're not a cat lover or a lover of any animals... what is wrong with you?! I kid. :D

All kidding aside, Avery, Rosemary & Michael are quite folks and they respect your privacy. Since I was out and about most of the time, I really didn't have much interactions with my host. I can only gather that they live a happy, simple, sustainable lifestyle from the few times I chatted with them. They enjoy the outdoors and even brew their own beer. How cool is that?!

My private room was in the basement. Coming from Chicago, I particularly enjoyed the cooler temps in my room. It was very clean and void of any clutter. Free wifi is available and my cell phone had full bars; something all of us can appreciate! I traveled alone but the room was big enough for two guest with tons of floor and closet space. The slew of travel guides and a chalk-board serving as a welcome sign was an added plus.

The house sits on top of a hill which offers a clear view of the beautiful and quite neighborhood. Sitting on the porch and enjoying the breeze is highly recommended. If you're feeling adventurous, you can actually walk to Downtown where all the high-end shops are and to Pike's Market Place. But public transportation and small shops are within walking distance as well. 

Needless to say, I recommend the Crawford's & Avery's place!"
3533224,36772972,2015-07-01,11881007,Emma,"Rosemary and Michael were great hosts. They responded quickly to messages, provided clear information and left clear instructions for us at their home.

During our stay, Rosemary and Michael were friendly and welcoming. We enjoyed our conversations with them.

Their indoor cat was wonderful. He is large, athletic, friendly and delightfully talkative.

The house itself is in a safe neighbourhood, only a short bus or car journey from downtown Seattle. We were provided with a guest permit which enabled us to park outside the house for the duration of our stay.

Inside the house, all was as described. The shared shower, washing machine and tumble dryer were upstairs. The kitchen/living room and cloakroom were on the main level, and the guest room was in the basement.

There was an excellent selection of books, leaflets, transport schedules and other Seattle-related tourist information in the basement for us to peruse at our leisure.

Whilst Seattle roasted in 90°F/30°C+ temperatures outside, the basement room remained pleasantly cool.

I am happy to recommend this property and Rosemary and Michael as hosts."
3533224,36989184,2015-07-03,35882452,Ji,we arrived late but room key and parking permit was exactly where she stated. room was even better than the picture looks! it was very clean and nice not to mention that tiny blackboard in the room was very cute and welcoming. her cat! is so sweet. only about 10mins drive(with traffic) away from the pike place market. i would recommend anyone who plans their visit to seattle to stay at rosemarys! :)
3533224,37076769,2015-07-04,27380760,Tianyu,"The neighborhood is cozy and quiet. Michael and Rosemary welcomed us right when we got here. There are cute little notes and signs all over the apartment letting us know where things are located to help us feel more comfortable and situated. The facilities are very clean and everything was well put together. The bedroom where we stayed had AC and it was a relief and sanctuary every time we came back from the scorching 90 plus degree weather this weekend. This is our first time using airbnb and it was an amazing experience! Slept better than we have at hotels. Also their cat, Avery, is a sweetheart. Very loving and is down to be pet and give you purrs. "
3533224,37293232,2015-07-06,29773030,Marko,"Rosemary and Michael were great hosts who made our stay comfortable and easy. Everything was perfectly organized for our arrival even though we arrived much later than planned. The room is very nice and spacey and full of information for the traveller. Although we were mostly out, we enjoyed our brief encounters with these lovely hosts. Thanks for having us!"
3533224,37658065,2015-07-09,28213046,Yun,"Rosemary and Michael are very nice and helpful. We are very happy to meet their family during our stay. The room is quite nice with a lovely garden. It's very easy to get there by bus from the airport. It takes only about 20 min. And 15 min-20 min walk to downtown.
I would like to stay with them again next time when i visit Seattle.

Yun and Ben"
3533224,38482617,2015-07-16,29777485,Susan,他们两夫妇非常热情，房间也干净整洁，在西雅图的时光一切都很美好。家里有很多提示的便利贴，方便也很自在。
3533224,39014326,2015-07-20,25159444,Inge,"Excellent, cool room in hot Seattle. Best sleep this trip so far!"
3533224,39391113,2015-07-23,12485494,Eirik,"I had an excellent stay at Rosemary and Michael's place. Their place was inviting, tidy, and clean. I arrived a bit late and thus really appreciated the conveniently placed post-it notes to guide me around the house. The guest room itself was spacious, and offered a great bed, a practical desk, as well as plenty of handy travel guides. The neighborhood was residential and quiet, and is a relatively short walk to Seattle downtown and the hip Capitol Hill area. Finally, both Michael and Rosemary were really friendly and helpful. I give their place my warmest recommendation. "
3533224,39559983,2015-07-24,38395074,Tom,"We arrived after 10 p.m., but Rosemary's and Michael's instructions helped us easily locate their home and get entry without them being able to be there.  They left thoughtful notes in several spots within the home, which was clean, neat and warmly furnished.  We felt quite at home.  This was a quick overnight stopover for us, as we had to leave at 6:45 a.m. to catch a train.  We met Michael in the morning as we were bringing our luggage up the stairs from our downstairs room.  He was very pleasant and even helped carry luggage down the outside front stairs as we were departing.  We wished that we could have conversed more and lingered longer.  "
3533224,39656443,2015-07-25,24462119,Irene,"The room was charming and clean, as was the whole house. Rosemary and Michael are kind hosts. All was as advertised."
3533224,39770562,2015-07-26,34764717,Madeleine,"Michael and Rosemary were good hosts although I only interacted with Michael but he was very friendly and relaxed. Our arrival was easy with clear instructions and they even gave us a guest parking pass for us to use which was so handy.

The room looks exactly like the pictures - big, clean, and a lot of personal touches that were sweet (like a little welcome Madeleine chalkboard sign). The bed was comfortable too. 

The neighbourhood was good - we were able to walk to SafeCo Field within 20 minutes after Michael's suggestion. We didn't spend much more time in the neighbourhood. 

All in all it was great space for us to spend the night after a fun Mariners baseball game!"
3533224,40578746,2015-08-01,8957015,Rebecca,"Rosemary and Michael were communicative, and accommodating.  They were home early on my check-in day so that I could drop off my suitcase.  They also left good directions throughout the house, and had toiletries and other little touches to make me comfortable."
3533224,41321904,2015-08-07,2418496,Julien,I had a great time with Rosemary and Michael! They were extremely welcoming and helpful; Michael even gave me a lift to Seward Park on the second day. I would love to come back!
3533224,41599953,2015-08-08,33935403,Sue,"Rosemary and Michael were very welcoming despite being about to leave for the airport very soon after we arrived. The room was comfortable, totally fine. Easy bus ride into town. We hope Avery the cat will be allowed outside soon!"
3533224,41730167,2015-08-09,29874534,Lisa,"The Hosts were traveling.  Dana covered for them.  She was wonderfully helpful and friendly.  
Location to Century Link and Safeco Stadiums (if you have a car or use Uber) is EXCELLENT!  
The room was private, comfortable and clean.  29 steps to enter the front door, so pack light if you stay.  It worked wonderfully for my niece and me.  I would definitely use Rosemary and Michael's Airbnb again and will recommend it to friends.
"
3533224,42412668,2015-08-13,9661585,Christopher,"This was a fantastic experience! Michael and Rosemary needed to travel, so they had a friend meet me upon arrival. The house was secure and the unit was clean and comfy. They had everything I might have needed ready in case I didn't think to bring everything (I didn't), and the room was well decorated. The neighborhood is quiet but it's also a stone's throw from the university, so there were lots of shops a short walk away -- perfect, since I was traveling for a conference and wanted someplace to work and get coffee a couple of hours each day. 
Highly recommended! Bonus: Avery the cat is a rock star. "
3533224,42915700,2015-08-16,2451175,Linda,"Rosemary and Michael's place was just what we were looking for in Seattle. The great location allowed us to walk everywhere! Avery (the kitty) was very sweet. Unfortunately we didn't meet our hosts, but Dana did a great job filling in for them. She answered all our questions and even recommended a great breakfast place."
3533224,43098010,2015-08-17,21688464,Jeff,Beautiful home and room; it was like a Pinterest board come to life! Rosemary was very welcoming and nice to talk with during our short time in Seattle. Would stay again. 
3533224,43659234,2015-08-21,15914463,Josh,"I really enjoyed staying in Rosemary and Michael's cozy home.  I basically felt like a friend visiting from out of town!  While I was here, Michael was out of town and Rosemary had a friend over.  We had some nice chats, the room was comfy, Wi-Fi worked great, conveniently located near downtown Seattle.  Really happy with my choice, and thanks for making my visit to Seattle that much friendlier!"
3533224,43858713,2015-08-22,41423416,Shirley,Great house! Perfect for nature-lovers
3533224,44322677,2015-08-25,38154145,Tasha,Everything was nice and clean. Rosemary was extremely helpful and welcoming.  The house was walking distance to restaurants and shops.  
3533224,44636813,2015-08-28,32795305,Josh,We had the BEST time in Seattle and part of the reason for that was our proximity to all the downtown action. Rosemary and Michael's house was a nice walking distance from everything and the room we stayed in was perfect. Very spacious and well-kept. We would definitely be open to staying there again in the future (especially because we never got to meet them!). Thanks for the great stay!
3533224,45070162,2015-08-31,34054301,Oliver,"Everything was well marked when we arrived, there was no guess work needed at all.  Our hosts even provided some amenities in case we had forgotten something.  There was a note on the desk in our room welcoming us and explained a few of the odd quirks of the place.  Avery (the cat) was very friendly and sweet.  It is clear that the hosts of this room care about the experience of their customer. "
3533224,46132927,2015-09-08,15111139,Patrick,"Rosemary's place was safe, clean and super cozy. The downstairs bedroom is really private. I would recommend this spot to anyone. "
3533224,46479452,2015-09-11,37579022,Stefana,"I highly recommend a stay at Rosemary and Michael's! Rosemary was super nice and even gave us some awesome brunch recommendations. Everything in the home was very well organized and they are really good about putting notes so that you're not wondering ""hmm I wonder if I'm allowed to use this."" The setup was nice as well with a private room in the basement that was very cozy. There's a half bath for use and the main bathroom is shared but very clean and they are even nice enough to have a huge bottle of Shampoo and conditioner in there for everyone to use. Great hosts."
3533224,47937010,2015-09-21,44373055,Rexton,"Rosemary was as sweet as can be and between her and Michael have done everything they could to make their home easy to navigate and perfect for Airbnb.  

The check in process was very smooth and described clearly.  Rosemary happened to be there and gave me the basic tour.  The room is very private and separate from the rest of the house which was nice, but the common areas of the house were also very open and welcoming.  The house is in a very cute neighborhood in Seattle, and I got to enjoy my Sunday morning reading my book in their beautiful back yard.  Rosemary ended up joining me and she was very easy to talk to and a wonderful host."
3533224,49000004,2015-09-30,30346205,Nicole,"First of all,  I had a wonderful time in Seattle. Not only had I time to explore an interesting city but also I enjoyed my stay with Rosemary and Michael. 
As I arrived, Avery the cute cat was there to say hello and a lot of notes which helped me to find everything. 
The room was big, very clean, quiet and the house so nice with a beautiful backyard. Times for having a shower, using the kitchen or the washing machine were no problem. 
Rosemary and Michael gave me helpful tips for my city visit and my trip to Portland and Cannon Beach which was great and we had an interesting evening with sharing our travel experiences. 
The neighborhood was safe with nice cafes and restaurants, therefore walking home in the evenings was no problem. 
For my next time in Seattle, I will stay with you and maybe have the chance to taste your delicious banana cake again. 
Thank you so much. 
Take care. 
Nicole"
3533224,49467348,2015-10-04,31240308,Auður,"Our stay was very short but sweet and Rosmary and Michael provided us with exactly what we needed for our whirlwind visit of Seattle. 

Their place is nice and clean and the extra room cozy with a comfy bed and duvet. They were also very accommodating letting us arrive a little early because we were under some time restraints. 

It was easy to find their house and it was close to a lot of interesting things. It was also easy and fairly quick to take a bus downtown. 

We would definitely recommend you book with Rosemary and Michael and we would do so again without any (website hidden) Avery is adorable. So is the neighbors cat even though we weren't sure if it thought it was there to guard the house  or to get petted. "
3533224,49675049,2015-10-05,42147761,Allycia,"It was very nice staying with Rosemary and Michael. They welcomed us into their home, showed us the space, talked with us for a bit and were very respectful of the time we wanted to be together. Their home is very nice and Airbnb-ers have a basement space all to themselves. It is about a 30 minute walk to down town and on your way you pass by many fun places. It was a wonderful place to stay for the night!"
3533224,50084819,2015-10-09,17865677,海涛,"This trip is our last stop at Seattle, this city is cool, Michael and Rosemary 's house is amazing. Warm welcome, cozy, lovely environment, cute cat and neighborhood cat :) comfortable as home. From short stay, I would feel they are Eco- friendly person, and love life, live in life. Best wishes from Hitao and Sophia "
3533224,50682853,2015-10-13,26450595,Jenny,With friendly. Attentive ( quick response) communication from the start. Discreet notes around the house also gave complete clarity to all the facilities. This is such a well thought out accomodation and I had one of the best beds ever! Also  my own private loo. ... all impeccably clean. 
3533224,51504056,2015-10-20,46503717,Irina,Michael and Rosemary were great hosts - very friendly and flexible with my check in time. This was my first airbnb experience and I felt welcome and comfortable in their home. I got a private room in the basement of their house. They had very helpful notes that gave me the guidance on what I can use in the house or tips. Very tidy and cosy house. 
3533224,51763468,2015-10-24,3636001,Daniel,"This is the perfect place to stay in Seattle, very close to nice dining areas, walking distance to bus stations and touristic places, and all of that with a very comfortable bed and excellent hosts. Rosemarie and Michael waited for us in our late arrival and they were very kind with us during our stay. The room is exactly as described, comfortable bed, very clean, and you have all that you need. Don't hesitate and stay here!
Thanks for everything Rosemary and Michael!"
3533224,51907877,2015-10-25,111110,OroLynn,"Rosemary and Michael are wonderful hosts.  They are gracious and adaptable which makes them comforting.  The room is lovely and private. The bed is great. The house is remarkable for it's cleanliness and order. Small post it notes provide all the instructions one needs, if (like me) you should fall into bed without listening to Michael's helpful introduction to his home. The neighborhood is lovely and the excitement of downtown is an easy walk.  I was beaten a bedraggled when I arrived and left renewed and restored.   I feel lucky to have stayed with them."
3533224,52621279,2015-10-31,14000665,Katherine,"We felt right at home in Michael's place - we were greeted by the friendly kitty and happened to catch Michael at home before he had to leave for work. He was very accommodating because our arrival time needed to be a little earlier than planned and Michael gave us a nice rundown of nearby areas to walk to for our short stay in Seattle. The house is in a quiet neighborhood and walking distance to 12th St & Pike. Overall a pleasant experience, and would love to come back for a longer stay one day :)"
3533224,52837661,2015-11-02,43573783,Frank,"Michael and Rosemary are two very kind and down to earth people. They are very welcoming and have very convenient post-its all around the house, making it very easy to find you way around even when they're not there. The house is located close to a bus stop that will take you into downtown withon five minutes. The room is like the pictures and very spacious and clean. "
3533224,53432987,2015-11-08,48179351,Sayan,"I had a great time in Michael's place, though I stayed only for one night as I was switching hotels. Everything was neat and tidy, and there were cool stickers telling me where the bathroom was, how to use the heater, and a ton of nice guide books on Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. I enjoyed my experience and am looking forward to stay there again when I'm around in Seattle. The cat was out for the weekend so I missed her, though."
3533224,53808232,2015-11-13,28091371,Patrice,I really enjoyed staying in Michael's house. I enjoyed a very large and clean room in a very quiet neighborhood. Michael made everything possible to make my stay pleasent. He prepared coffee in the mornings that was really appreciated.
3533224,54007727,2015-11-15,16968418,Nikolay,Super cozy place in a great location. Michael's place is perfect for 1-2 people to stay for several days to discover Seattle. There is everything you (website hidden) is clean and friendly.Michael is warmly welcoming!

3533224,55874460,2015-12-06,22254531,Terra,Best part about your place: everything is so QUIET! Well built house. I never felt in your way or awkward in your space. Thanks for sharing some shower stuff too. Very helpful!
3533224,56095588,2015-12-08,15648815,Gregory,"Michael was a great host. He checked in to make sure I got into the property okay, and was friendly and helpful throughout my stay. He has a wonderful set-up, with small notes posted around the place to inform guests what is available to them. Everything was clean and well maintained. Would definitely come back here again. "
3533224,56538126,2015-12-14,50160883,David,"Michael was a wonderful host and his home is in a prime location. Even with the winter rains it was still a highly walkable experience. The room was comfortable and private. 
Thanks Michael!"
3533224,56692298,2015-12-16,50615292,Madison,"Michael was helpful in suggesting places to see around Seattle. The house was very neat and organized, and in a convenient location. We only used public transportation and Michael's house was in good proximity to the bus stop which could take us downtown (just a quick ride). Our room was very spacious, yet at the same time cute and cozy. We really enjoyed our first time using Airbnb. "
3533224,56999479,2015-12-20,51660048,Mary,The place was awesome! The room was super clean and spacious. Michael was super nice and helpful. Definitely would stay there again.

6768768,35869770,2015-06-22,29591961,Stephanie,"Although we never met Gil we absolutely loved staying at his place! It's bright, sunny, and quiet and the little alcove where we slept definitely felt like a tree house, you have a great south/west facing view of the city. Perfectly located, everything is walkable and highly recommend utilizing the bus system and the pronto bike system. We brought a car and parked it in the garage for the weekend for a reasonable price. We absolutely loved checking out oddfellows cafe, Elliot bay bookstore, victrolia coffee, and bauhaus. Melrose market is fun to walk through, we also walked down to south lake union and spent a lot of time biking around the lake. The house is very clean and bright, as the elevator is really cool :) thank you Gil! We would definitely stay again and recommend it. "
6768768,36133929,2015-06-25,3599181,Richard,Gil's communication was great.  I got all the details I needed to get in and was able to get there/in without any problems.   The apartment was good and got the old school charm.  2 beds which made it nice.   
6768768,37360345,2015-07-06,34949912,Andriy,"Great apartment with a lot of character. Centrally located, a minute drive from the interstate 5, walking distance to the main attractions in city.  very quite and safe neighborhood,  and only few blocks away from night life destinations. Stayed at Gil's apartment for 8 nights, the place will accommodate three people comfortably. The apartment has everything you will need. Very memorable time in Seattle.  Thanks Gil."
6768768,37519964,2015-07-07,1536163,Cecilia,"Terrific! I highly recommend a stay at Gil's. Everything from communications through my stay last night went smoothly. Gil's home was spacious, light-filled, clean, and has a record player to boot. His home is in Seattle's hip Cap Hill neighborhood. It's half a block from fun restaurants and coffeeshops. 

In terms of communication, Gil was responsive, and gave thorough directions and information on his home. His manager John was responsive too, met me at the building, let me in and gave me directions on everything. "
6768768,38005533,2015-07-12,35613471,Jasmin,Great place. Loved the old vintage feel. We had a great time. Close to everything. Everything was provided. Love the Jam Box. Definitely has great energy. Thank you Gil.
6768768,45596973,2015-09-04,3010723,Rich,"Great location, great host.  While some contractor work on the apartment provided some unforeseen issues, let me be clear that Gil was up-front about the work beforehand, and went above and beyond in resolving the issues, leaving this AirBNB more than satisfied.  Thanks to Gil for a good place to stay while I was in town for some coffee tourism and a friend's wedding!  My favorite part of the apartment might have been the Jawbone ""Jambox"" that paired with my iPhone to play music in the apartment.  Now I need to buy one of those..."
6768768,46039154,2015-09-07,17602090,Celeste,"The apartment was in a great location in the center of capital hill, it was adorable on the inside just like the photos ! Gil and his manager Jon we're great communicators and it made our night stay very easy! If we go to Seattle again we would definitely come back! "

10118341,58441444,2016-01-02,49912003,Cameron,"My mom and I came for a 4 day trip and had a great stay at Elise's place. She was very friendly and helpful with providing basic directions to get around the area, and the place is a fairly close distance to both Ballard and Downtown, about a $10 uber ride either direction and a close by bus stop. I would stay here again for sure, it was a cute room for a great price! "
1579615,7080797,2013-09-05,8403389,Soo,"Newly renovated building. It has its own kitchen, bathroom and s mall patio as well. When I stayed, there was no one in the building so I had quiet, cozy time. Having a designated parking is also a big plus!   "
1579615,7228520,2013-09-11,8366192,Darya,"Mario was a great and attentive host. The studio was just lovely. We spent 9 nights at the property and it certainly felt like home away from home. The studio was immaculate, clean, private, quiet, conveniently located, spacious, tastefully decorated and with all of the amenities we needed. I especially appreciated french door access to outdoor patio and the great water pressure and temperature in the shower.
I would definitely recommend the studio and Mario to anyone looking for a place to stay in Ballard area.

1579615,7400301,2013-09-18,461015,Maura,"Mario's home was lovely, very private, incredibly clean and just perfect for my stay. The neighborhood was very quiet and so close to the shops/restaurants/docks in Ballard. The apartment had everything I needed and I hope to stay here numerous times."
1579615,7526687,2013-09-23,8072925,Curt,"Mario is a wonderful host. His apartment was excellent for the need I had. I rented for a senior aunt and my cousin. My aunt was sight challenged and has walking challenges. Mario installed extra lights that were bright and motion sensord that helped with the one large unlit step that needed a light and the stairs to the front door that really gave a sense of security. Once inside this lovely apartment everything was easily accessible. The bath was wonderful, shower large and alot of hot water. The kitchen had everything one needed to cook, microwave, and a large refrigerator. Cabinets were finished nicely, the bamboo floors were lovely throughout the apartment, and quite a contemporary feel everywhere. The French doors leading out to the private garden with a fountain and a table for two, just the right touch of romance for this lovely private garden tucked away in Ballard. When I checked in the needs for extra blankets, covers, sheets, etc, all were still in their new packages, hidden in the couch that opened into an extra bed. There was another cot for an extra person, making room for four easily. The large king size bed was a dream. The size, the sheets, pillows, and comforter made this place a desirable place comparable to the hotels in Ballard that are upscale. Any questions,or needs were quickly answered by Mario. The fact that he went out and installed extra lights for my senior aunt's special needs says enormous things of the type of desirable person affiliated with Airbnb. I heartily recommend  Mario, and his apartment to all who will use this service. I will use this service again, and am glad to know of the quality that Mario offers all who will use him.
Curt , Juanita, and Greg"
1579615,7652715,2013-09-28,8503751,Doris,"Mario's place was ideal for our stay near our family.  It was very clean and had everything we needed.  Great king size bed and was
All very comfortable.  We especially liked having our own entrance.
Mario was easy to work with and answered any question I had. 
Beautifully decorated place.  We will be staying there again."
1579615,7763129,2013-10-01,6779235,Dekker,"Although just a single room, the apartment was large, spotless and very comfortable. The kitchen was great. However, the bed was the best part ... so comfortable that I had a hard time getting the motivation to get out of bed in the morning."
1579615,7804314,2013-10-03,5904860,Amanda,"Our stay at Mario's place was a great way to end our honeymoon. We found the place at the last minute and Mario was very accommodating, turning around the booking quickly, leaving us details so we could check in late at night and allowing us to stay a little longer on check out so we didn't have to traipse around Seattle with our luggage. The place itself is great, amazingly comfy bed, NetFlix, self contained kitchen was great for a late night snack, located in the cute suburb of Ballard, with cafes and restaurants a 5 min walk away. Thanks again Mario!"
1579615,8121226,2013-10-16,1867172,Ben,This was a great place in an awesome location in Ballard! Nice neighborhood and really thriving little downtown area with excellent bars and restaurants (all walking distance). Not too far from downtown Seattle as well. Mario was very kind and made sure we had everything we needed. The bed was AMAZING!!! High recommend this place and would definitely stay here again.
1579615,8472709,2013-11-01,3584187,Doug,"Mario`s apartment was new and clean and very light for a lower unit. It was comfortable, felt homey, and has a nice little kitchen and office nook. The king bed is outrageously comfy and the flat screen with netflix makes it hard to leave.
Mario is very friendly and responsive to all calls and texts. He made sure we were all settled in before he left, had a handy key retrieval if he wasn`t to be around, and even brought us a vase from his home when we showed up with flowers. 
 It looks like the back patio would be nice to use when it is warm. The unit is a half a block away from a nice neighborhood pub, within short walking distance to a great bakery, a good QFC grocery store, and Skillet restaurant for breakfast, etc. The whole Ballard area has good pubs, restaurants, and shops along NW Market St, Ballard Ave, and surrounding, with Walrus and Carpenter, Ocho, Bastille, Staple and Fancy, The Noble Fir, Hazelwood and Bitterroot all walkable. 
We only wished we had had more time here and will definitely return to Mario`s apartment."

1579615,8707245,2013-11-12,2340695,Kirsten,Mario's place was awesome. Great location and a nice quiet and comfortable place. It was within walking distance of the great downtown Ballard area. We enjoyed the Matador for a drink and the Hi-life for some delicious food. Hot cakes was pretty high on the list to visit but it was packed every time we walked by. Guess we will have to go back and we would try to stay at Mario's place again.
1579615,9035346,2013-12-02,1323750,Connie,"We loved Mario's apartment located within walking distance of Ballard's wonderful local shops, theater and bookstore.   I will tell my friends in Spokane who also visit relatives living in small apartments in Seattle!
 
All furniture and supplies look brand new, stylish and pleasant.  Mario was very accommodating with our travel schedule, lighting and arrangements for arrival.

"
1579615,9115398,2013-12-08,37412,Gary,"Mario is an excellent host - he's very responsive and made the entire process super easy.  The apartment is as pictured ... essentially new, very clean, very quite, cozy, and comfortable.  The neighborhood is also quiet yet close (walking distance) to Ballard and all it has to offer.  Easy access to the city bus a short 1/2 block away.  When in Seattle Mario's place will be my first choice!  "
1579615,9445185,2013-12-29,3459761,Robert,"A beautiful, comfortable studio! Brand new renovation. Quiet, nice layout. Very comfy bed. Easy walking to Ballard restaurants and movie theater! Mario is a thoughtful and friendly host who I met only by chance the first day as he was updating the door lock. Mario built in sensors that light up the private entry path- a really nice touch when returning at night. I stated a week and found it to be pleasant, very comfortable, and convenient. A wall mounted electric fireplace added a nice amount of heat during some chilly nights, and looked beautiful too. I would stay here again and look forward to it! Thank you Mario."
1579615,10125759,2014-02-01,1128976,Vanessa,"My stay at Mario's place was perfect.  The apartment was even more cozy and comfortable than I had even anticipated; and I thoroughly enjoyed the fire place, and the magnificent bed. I was there for work so the little office nook also came in handy. Mario was out of the country while I was there so we never met, but we managed to communicate everything necessary to enable the check in to run smoothly.  I come to Seattle often for work and I would most definitely stay there again."
1579615,10259835,2014-02-10,10041116,Douglas,"This was a wonderful place to stay, 8 minute walk to downtown Ballard (passing several cafe's along the way for my morning coffee) spotless, seamless check in - out, and the most comfortable bed I've slept in for a long while.

Mario's place comes with a 100% recommendation from me.

1579615,12215653,2014-04-26,1128976,Vanessa,"This was my second timing staying at Mario's place. (See my first rave review written previously). It was my second stay of many, as I come to Seattle often and this perfect little apartment makes my work trips so much more enjoyable! My new favorite part of the stay is waking up early for morning runs along the water not too far away. Followed by a caffeine stop at one of the local coffee shops up the street. I'm starting to feel like a local, all thanks to this lovely place. See you again soon Ballard! "
1579615,15002817,2014-06-30,17021291,Garland,"Loved Mario's place! It was my first time using airbnb and was a little apprehensive at first but Mario made everything so simple. We arrived, typed in the door code and walked into our beautiful home for the weekend. I couldn't have asked for an easier first airbnb experience! The apartment was in a wonderful location-close to tons of great restaurants. The space was clean and comfortable. The bed was FANTASTIC! Soo comfortable. There was a parking space for us which was a huge plus. Overall I would highly recommend it and definitely would stay again. "
1579615,15616309,2014-07-13,12076051,Katherine,"The apartment was perfect for us!  The location is so amazing that we didn't rent a car for four days.  There is a supermarket and fabulous restaurants nearby.  Bakeries, pubs, and shops are super close.  We went to a Mariners game using the bus which is around the corner.  The apartment was clean and well-done with a nook and a separate light for working.  The bikes were an added bonus.  Mario is wonderful and accessible.  A super host.  We will return!"
1579615,16976173,2014-08-05,14898914,Sean,"The listing was exactly how I expected--clean, cozy and comfortable.  The bed was my favorite part.  I hadn't slept that well in years....YEARS!

Mario was an excellent host.  He was available to answer any questions I had about arrival and entry and is easily reachable.

The neighborhood was fine.  It was close to where we needed to be and had easy access to a few restaurants and coffee shops.  It's about a 5 minute taxi ride to the shore and only cost $5-8 per trip.

The place comes with a double door walk-out to a beautiful patio with table and chairs, which we used every night to catch up and philosophize with friends.

The kitchen was well equipped.  We had everything we needed to pan fry steaks, make rice, and saute veggies.

I honestly felt right at home, had everything I needed right there and slept like a king on a king."
1579615,17669908,2014-08-16,12901589,Brigitte,"Mario came and introduced himself the first evening. His apartment had everything we needed and a very inviting yard. The neighborhood is close to shopping and lots of restaurants. Also, it was very easy to access the apartment with the secure codes. "
1579615,17999278,2014-08-20,14924968,Lorraine,Great stat in Seattle. The apartment was clean and well fitted out. The bed was huge and very comfortable. Loved the little garden area where we sat out for breakfast. Particularly enjoyed the daily visit from a squirrel plus a visit on the last day by a lovely tabby cat! Mario was very helpful to my queries and responded very promptly. Once we figured out the bus route it was reasonably easy to get to down town as we didn't have transport. Would definitely recommend this to others. 
1579615,20339423,2014-09-28,18937853,Barbara,"The apartment was perfect in every way -- exactly as described with a luxurious king size bed and matress, full size refrigerator., great towels, etc. There was even a first aid kit!! And, in a district with little public parking, we were happy to have our own free parking space with the unit. This was our first airbnb experience and we will definitely do it again."
1579615,21029211,2014-10-10,9033181,Marco,Mario is a fantastic host.  The experience is better than the listing page.  We will definitely stay there again.
1579615,21384814,2014-10-16,20389404,Mark,"Great apartment in a great location.  Was perfect for us, and bikes were an addde bonus to go exploring (really appreciated Mario going out of his way to get the bikes working).  Outdoor area was also really handy, as well as the laundry/gym.  Would definitely recommend.  "
1579615,23212040,2014-11-25,11375189,Rachel,"The listing was accurate - the apartment was nicely stocked with the necessary items and had everything we needed. However, we had trouble getting in touch with Mario (via email and several calls and voice mails) about checking in and when the code to the gym and laundry didn't work and we didn't hear back from him until the night before we left. He was traveling and out of the country, which I understand - just wish he would have reached out prior to our check in date to let us know that he would be gone and that he would have given us the correct code. The location is great - walkable to Ballard and safe. "
1579615,27285277,2015-03-01,11404588,Philip,Mario was an excellent host to my Wife and I. From the very beginning  he was nothing but accommodating to our stay. Can't say enough good about his Ballard home. 
1579615,27405178,2015-03-03,8413572,Janice,Loved this unit. Everything was new and clean. Mario was very responsive. Location was great. Will stay again.
1579615,27765525,2015-03-11,2740044,MaryAn,My husband and I came for the first time visiting Seattle and what a Wonderful Experience we had! What made it even more great was Mario and Monica's sweet abode. We were very impressed with the little apt. It was super clean and very welcoming! My favorite was the electronic fireplace wall unit. Everything we needed was provided! Wonderful and gracious hosts! We wished we could have shared more time with Mario and Monica.  This place is located in a very good area which is close to everything! The Mexican restaurant La Carta De Oaxaca which Mario recommended was Delicious! (He was right) we would love to come again! And hope to do so!  We very highly recommend this place!   Muchisima Gracias Mario y Monica.
1579615,28024772,2015-03-16,8504285,Aaron,"Mario's place was very well appointed and immaculate. The private yard and central location in Ballard were especially nice. This is a great place to stay if you're going to be out and about in Ballard/Fremont and looking for a ""home base"". The bikes, while we didn't get a chance to use them, were an especially nice touch. Mario even took time to come and check on the bikes as we unexpectedly decided to use them. Overall, this was a great experience."
1579615,31031799,2015-05-01,26525312,Lynn,"We loved our first airbnb experience. We stayed in Mario's 3rd floor, 2 bedroom apt. It was very spacious, so cozy, comfortable and very clean.We even enjoyed the deck off the bedroom one sunny afternoon. Mario provided all the information we needed to make our stay very easy and enjoyable. All communication was done through emails with quick responses. We loved the neighborhood, easy walk to downtown Ballard, and only a few blocks from our son's apt. 
We will be back often visiting our son, and we will also encourage all our family and friends to stay in one of Mario's apts. during their visits."
1579615,33131492,2015-05-25,20472146,Mary,"The studio was just as described-cozy, clean, quiet and excellent neighborhood. Perfect home base for exploring the city, would definitely stay again."
1579615,33924629,2015-06-02,868877,Christie,We had a great time staying at Mario's cozy studio in Ballard. The studio had everything we needed. It was nice to have a small kitchen so that we could cook up what we snagged at the Ballard Sunday Farmer's Market. The location is great--so convenient to Market Street. Lots of room for the two of us and we took great advantage of the outside patio area. The inside is nicely furnished--exactly as it looks in the pictures--and the bed is very comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. 
1579615,50158673,2015-10-10,1128976,Vanessa,"Love this place. I am a repeat stayer, and will continue to come back time and time again"
1579615,51445886,2015-10-20,43000146,Michael,This is a great place to stay. The apartment is private and nice. The location is walking distance to Ballard and 2 minutes from bus #40 to most anywhere in Seattle. Also convenient to bike paths. My son and I really enjoyed our stay. Thanks Mario!
1579615,54243217,2015-11-17,45141653,Trudy,"This cozy apartment was just as described! It was clean and modern, cozy and quiet and right in the heart of a wonderful area of Seattle. All details were perfect. The linens were soft and warm, the bed very comfortable and the kitchen well appointed. We could not be happier with the space. There was a great outdoor patio area just out our back door which we would have enjoyed more except it was raining quite a bit. And having an available washer and dryer (very new btw) was great. Also, loved the keyless entry!
If there was a 5+ rating this would be it. I can't wait to return!
Super easy communication and prompt responses! We arrived sooner than expected and Mario let us check in early which really helped us out.
Thank you so much Mario"
1579615,56005291,2015-12-07,17037210,Jamie,The location was wonderful and the size of the place was just right for the two of us.  The host is very responsive with any requests.  
1579615,56628407,2015-12-15,21054705,Maria,"Mario's studio exceeded our expectations. Not only was it located in a great part of town, but the studio itself was well appointed with a comfy bed and comfortable living area/kitchen. We loved the keyless entry and Mario even gave us a call to make sure we knew how to get in properly. When visiting Seattle in the future, we'd certainly stay here again. Thanks Mario! "
1579615,57093926,2015-12-21,2430308,Daniel And Patty,Mario's studio is super clean and well appointed. It was perfect for my needs and the King bed was divine. Mario was easy to communicate with and pleasant all around.
8053990,45036710,2015-08-30,1433207,Eileen,"Elin's place was just as described.  Quiet, clean, good location, comfortable bed, very easy to walk to the many restaurants and bars of Ballard.  A 15-minute walk to the D-line took us right to downtown Seattle's Pike Street.  From there, easy to navigate the city.  "
8053990,45625984,2015-09-04,38045325,Sara,"Elin was wonderful. The room is large, bed very comfy. The house was clean and well laid-out. Having access to do laundry and use the kitchen was great. Her house is close to downtown and lots of fun things to do. Quiet neighborhood. I had a lovely stay and would absolutely stay with her again."
8053990,46335087,2015-09-09,42649883,Chris,"Great stay! Quiet, clean, cozy, and thoughtfully arranged.

I really like Ballard; it's a nice quiet getaway from the downtown hustle & bustle, while still being walkable with lots to do and easy transit access.

"
8053990,46816335,2015-09-13,14165005,Thomas,"Place was quiet and comfy and the location was very convenient. We arrived late and the key was missing from the lockbox, but Elin quickly came and let us in. Street parking was easy to find nearby."
8053990,47312319,2015-09-17,23874658,Debra,Elin was a great host. The room was clean and comfortable. The electronic keypad was very convenient.  The location was great. We did not have any problems finding a street parking spot.  We highly recommend this place.
8053990,48243379,2015-09-24,41158892,Paige,What an amazing space! I absolutely loved the room and  Elin was a great host. A+
8053990,48820907,2015-09-28,26222981,Stacy,"The description of this Nautical Bedroom was accurate. The room was very well appointed, comfortable, private, new-feeling, and clean. The location of the condo is excellent, walking distance to the downtown Ballard area (Market Street), yet the neighborhood is quiet and safe. Finding parking on the nearby streets was easy. I loved having access to the washer and dryer right outside our door. The combination lock on the front door worked great--no key necessary. The kitchen was also great--it was very clean and had everything I needed, including free coffee and plenty of space in the refrigerator for food storage. I appreciated the shampoo, conditioner, liquid soap, and hairdryer.  It was fun meeting Elin--she was super nice yet I hardly saw her during my four-night stay. The whole overnight experience was very quiet and private. Thank you!"
8053990,50401474,2015-10-11,45605957,Alexandra,"I really enjoyed my stay at Elin's!  My arrival time was a little approximate and I appreciated that she was ok with this; the electronic keypad lock made it easy to come and go, in general. The Nautical Room was just as it appears - simply and tastefully decorated, and everything was very clean, comfortable and felt very private, despite sharing the home with other people.  The bathroom amenities (shower toiletries and hair dryer) were super convenient, as was knowing there were plenty of extra towels if needed. The duvet on the bed was toasty, and there was also an extra blanket in the closet if you need a little something extra.  Happily, the wifi signal was strong in the room, and Elin left a card with login information that was easy to use.  Multiple outlets were accessible for charging.  As a first time Airbnb user, I had some trepidation about sharing someone else's home, but the way the townhouse is set up you don't really feel like you're traipsing through someone else's space to get to the 3rd floor rooms, which made me more comfortable.

I didn't really take advantage of the main floor access other than to store some leftovers in the fridge and briefly chat with Elin when I ran into her on my way in/out.

The location is fantastic - I had wanted to spend time in the Ballard neighborhood, and this was very walkable to some great coffee shops, bars and restaurants on the main street, but still quiet and felt very safe.  Only a few minutes' walk from the Ballard Locks, as well.  I purposely did a lot of walking, but saw that there was easy bus access if you plan to use public transit, and street parking was pretty reasonable.

Elin was a great host, and really helped give me confidence in the Airbnb experience.  I easily recommend staying with her, and hope to have an opportunity to visit again."
8053990,51647257,2015-10-22,26222981,Stacy,"Our stay was great, just like last time. I highly recommend staying here. Location is perfect and all needs are met for a wonderful stay."
8053990,53344846,2015-11-08,1021619,Leslie,"Elin's house was very easy to access, close to central Ballard, and totally clean. The sleeping accommodations were extremely comfy and Elin was very warm and welcoming! I would definitely stay here again! :)"
8053990,54216593,2015-11-16,48867027,Vince,"Elin's room was really good! It was all the way we expected it to be. Very clean, enough space and a comfortable bed. Elin was a very nice host and we had our privacy. The neighborhood is safe and quiet but all the bars and restaurants are within walking distance and there are plenty of them. The area itself is more than awesome. We could have spent at least a week more here. Also when it comes to exploring seattle this place is a very good starting point. All in all we can really recommend this place when you want to visit seattle! "
8053990,54378354,2015-11-19,52505,Judy,"We enjoyed our stay at Elin's townhouse. It was just as pictured, clean and we'll decorated and close to downtown Ballard."
8053990,54652929,2015-11-22,2252,Ryan,"Elin's room was a perfect spot to stay for a weekend exploring all Seattle has to offer. The location is almost perfect! If you don't know Ballard, you should get to know it, and staying here is the perfect opportunity to do so. Some of Seattle's newest and best restaurants are nearby, within walking distance, and Ballard's charming main street is blocks away - complete with its own restaurants and a weekly farmer's market!!!

The house itself is tucked away just off a main thoroughfare, so it's easy to access and find. The setup is comfortable, quaint, and inviting, with main floor access that includes a kitchen and open living space.

The room itself is exactly as described, and again provides a wonderfully comfortable space - just enough to unwind with ease. The bathroom is spacious and includes fresh linens, soap/shampoos if you need them, and a hair dryer just in case! 

I would absolutely stay here again. The home and neighbors were incredibly quiet, there was a small market and liquor store within walking distance, and downtown Seattle was a cheap uber or transit ride away. "
8053990,55435240,2015-12-01,21966442,Joann,"The listing was accurately described.  Elin was a good hostess.  She procured items for us that were dwindling in a timely manner.  She gave us our privacy which is always good for me as we were in Seattle to visit son and grandkids and I talk a lot, so we were able to get on our way quickly.  The bed was quite comfortable.  There was heat adjustment in the room itself so the ambient temperature was nice.  Some additional clean dishes would have been helpful at breakfast time but certainly not a deal breaker.  Liked the hair dryer.  Thank you, Elin, for a wonderful visit to Ballard and my son."
8053990,56066059,2015-12-08,9212728,Roger,"The room was wonderful, very clean and beautiful with a private bathroom.  The location was very private and quiet.  I had a very pleasant stay and Elin was very kind and accommodating."
8053990,56461698,2015-12-13,22534960,Karen,"The room was exactly as described. The bed was really comfortable and the bedding was warm and soft. I felt like I was right at home. The bathroom is really clean and the shower is very easy to use. It's a quiet house with very little noise from the street. I didn't really have a chance to say more than hi or bye to Elin since I was out looking at apartments for most of my trip, but she was very kind during our brief encounters. I would recommend this room to my friends. "
1145590,5117777,2013-06-13,5970487,Wanjiku,"Pam was a terrific hostess.  We had some overlapping dates, and she was extremely unobtrusive in her own home! The place is perfectly situated which makes it very easy to get around Seattle, and some neighborhoods are in walking distance (Queen Anne, Fremont, SLU)-though you must like hills! The place has everything one needs with w/d in unit, full kitchen with dishwasher and the like, and parking.  And the best thing is the deck-which is truly expansive and a lovely place to spend some time in the sun.  Pam was also gracious, when I needed to extend my dates by 2 days, in allowing me to re-up.  And, as mentioned before, she is a fantastic cook.  So while our schedules overlapped for those few days, I was able to enjoy both breakfast and tapas.  Overall, a really wonderful experience."
1145590,5245146,2013-06-20,6312189,Dany,Great host and a great place! Balcony was out of this world. Quite calm but easy to get everywhere with busses. The Italian place one street down is really nice. 
1145590,5316177,2013-06-24,4589859,Kate,"Pam was a very accommodating host. She was very helpful and her place was left in great condition for our arrival. She had left us a lovely note with instructions and books on Seattle to make our trip as easy as possible. Her house is in a great spot and a walkable distance from downtown. We walked into downtown everyday along the lake which was beautiful and after a busy day we enjoyed wine on her amazing patio.

I would recommend this apartment to all of my friends and family and would certainly stay again.
Kate "
1145590,5679498,2013-07-11,6876007,Jill,"We visited Seattle with our 5-year-old daughter.  We all loved the deck and having the privacy of our own bedroom was great.  If you've been to Seattle before, or wish to explore beyond Pikes Place Market, this is a perfect.  You are within a 20 minute walk of just about everything with some effort (not a flat surface for more than 2 blocks in Seattle).  

The only downside I can think of is that I was terribly worried about the floors at all time.  They are very soft dark wood and very easily scratched.  NO SHOES ALLOWED.  

Pam was very accommodating and my daughter already calls it her Seattle home.
"
1145590,16244242,2014-07-24,6161393,Nancy,"This apartment does indeed have an amazingly large patio, and enough space to technically sleep 6 people. Our party of 5 stayed here feeling a tad cramped though, as the 5th person's ""bedroom"" was basically the livingroom.

A few days before our arrival, I asked for check-in instructions, and Pam politely informed us that she would be out of town, and that friends would be taking care of us instead.  I was also told that the apartment did not have enough towels for 5 people, meaning that there were no extras at all.

While the apartment was *well-furnished*, it was not *well-appointed*. Various essentials were missing, including toilet paper, and like the towels, there weren't any extras of anything to go around, but it was just enough for a 7-day stay.

It is also a rather noisy location, as sea planes are constantly taking off and landing throughout the day, so we rarely made use of that large and fantastic patio."
1145590,17194347,2014-08-09,6044219,Isabella,The reservation was canceled 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1145590,17557269,2014-08-14,4986762,Kevin,"The apartment has a lot of potential, with a huge deck and view of south lake union, 2 bedrooms each with their own bathroom, and off street parking. Other than the tv which we couldn't get working the place was as advertised.

Pam was nice over the phone and very responsive to our  inquiries.

"
1145590,18892601,2014-09-02,12881696,Elizabeth,"We had a great stay at Pam's place. She met us there to show us the ropes, left a bottle of wine, and then left us to make ourselves at home. The neighborhood is central to everything, has several good eating/coffee/bar options, and is very accessible by public transport/car/bike. (However, if you are looking to stay in a quaint Seattle neighborhood, this is probably not it.) The apartment was clean, comfortable, quiet. The best part - the decks are huge with great views!"
1984692,14483322,2014-06-20,16116379,Joseph,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and Esther made the whole process
very simple for us starting with the initial email communication all the way until we
arrived.  Esther answered all our questions/emails and had everything ready for
us by the time we stepped in the door. We had a wonderful time staying in
Esther's  lovely home.  Everything matches the description and pictures plus
we were able to cook with herbs from garden.  Esther's home is located in
a quiet neighborhood but restaurants and grocery store are within walking
distance.  We also enjoy the Greek restaurant that Esther recommended."
1984692,20478326,2014-09-29,13251842,Dan,Great place!  
1984692,23377839,2014-11-30,8639050,Mark,"Esther's house was beautiful-- exactly as airy and loft-like as it is in the photos. It's in a nice neighborhood, a short walk from the park at Green Lake and the cafes in Phinney Ridge. Esther was quick and responsive to questions, and she made the checking in and out process simple and intuitive. My family and I really enjoyed having the place as a home base. "
1984692,28527535,2015-03-25,13580456,Shan,"We had a great time at Esther's house! We were traveling with two teenagers, and particularly enjoyed the privacy that the layout of the house provided. The house as a whole was comfortable and well taken care of, but the main attraction is definitely the master bedroom/roof deck! So much light, even on cloudy days, and although it was cool and rainy most of the time we were there, the deck was a fun option for hanging out when it was dry. The jacuzzi tub was an added bonus. The neighborhood itself was great for walking, and we found it to be super convenient to jump on 99 to get from place to place in the car. I'd definitely stay here again. A great value!"
1984692,29877863,2015-04-13,5428318,Franziska,"We had a wonderful time at Esther's place. Check-in was super easy, and the house is lovely, clean and spacious. We had all the amenities we needed. Communication with Esther was fast and easy, she was very flexible and went out of her way to ensure everything was smooth for us. Would highly recommend this place. "
3383329,15432456,2014-07-08,17533046,Arthur,"We spend 3 nights in Seattle. We totally loved the apartment in Fremont. We were impressed by the comfortable apartment we came home to every night. Communicating with Jacqueline was easy and she replied promptly. She made our first Airbnb experience unforgettable. Her apartment was clean, modern and very well located.
Cafes, bars and restaurants are within walking distance to her quiet and cozy place! 
We'd love to return to Jacqueline's apartment and would recommend it to anyone!
Thank you very much Jacqueline!"
3383329,16914050,2014-08-04,8926017,Ken,"We recently stayed three nights at Jacqueline's place in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. The apartment was very nicely furnished.  The bed was comfortable with enough pillows and blankets.  Although we didn't avail ourselves of the fully-equipped kitchen, it came stocked with eggs, milk, butter and coffee for breakfast, as well as water bottles and even a bar of chocolate - a very nice touch.
The bathroom was likewise stocked with shampoo, conditioner, body wash and a blow-dryer.
Overall, our stay was great and it restored our faith in the Airbnb system as we had had a very bad experience prior to this one.
Note: Jacqueline's apartment is in the basement of a multi-level building. There is an apartment right on top of this one and you can easily hear when the occupants and their pet(s) upstairs move around. This might bother you, if you go to bed early or would like to sleep in.
As with most Seattle neighborhoods, parking could be an issue, meaning you cannot always count on parking right by the apartment. But for the most part we parked on the street close by and just walked down the steep sidewalk."
3383329,17449744,2014-08-12,17320922,Susie,"It was such a pleasure to have Jacqueline as a host. Very close to the heart of fremont and a short trip into the city. The place is lovely. Very clean. Loads of room. Great comfortable bed and the coffee maker was a lovely little feature. What a great base to see Seattle from. 

Jacqueline was great to communicate with and goes above and beyond to ensure you have all you need. Would stay again and definitely would recommend. "
3383329,18067089,2014-08-21,18007770,Sharon,"The host could not have been more warm and welcoming. The Freemont area is funky and interesting. Great walking, running and biking options with Burke Gilman Trail so close. "
3383329,18261999,2014-08-24,7079198,Jana,"Jacqueline is a fantastic host, very welcoming, easy to communicate with and what you see is what you get with Moody Hues!"

3383329,19224208,2014-09-08,20245100,Be,"Jacky was awesome, had a chocolate bar waiting for me. The electric key entry is perfect, no keys necessary, made it a breeze to go and come as we pleased. Jacky's email with instructions was very through and easy to read. The place was clean and photo's are exactly the same as the place. Awesome location too, 15 - 20 or less to downtown, neighborhood was nice."
3383329,19435412,2014-09-12,3355131,Drew,"I had a great stay at Moody Hues. The room was clean, well-equipped, and in a great neighborhood. Full kitchen was great for making breakfast before adventuring around the city. Plenty of bars, food, and coffee within walking distance and very close to the bus stop. Also, right around the corner from Theo chocolate. Go there. 
Jacqueline was extremely accommodating and provided a ton of info for new visitors to Seattle.  Would definitely stay again!"
3383329,19674262,2014-09-16,17842773,Erik,"Check in was really easy. Jacqueline was friendly and provided excellent restaurant recommendations. The apartment was clean and included everything in the listing. A non-down comforter was available and while no non-down pillows, doubling up the pillow cases worked. Location was great. Short bus ride to downtown and walking distance to all of the great restaurants in Fremont. 
The tenants upstairs have one or more small children. They were running around from early morning to late at night. While it did not disrupt our stay it was noticeable. 
Overall a great place.  "
3383329,19854880,2014-09-19,16496578,Drasi,The apartment was wonderful and just as described.  It was very clean and very comfortable.  Jacqueline was a great and friendly hostess and communicated timely and clearly.  I was here for work and the apartment was only five minutes from the office- so very convenient.  The bed was really comfortable and the kitchen had everything I needed.  I enjoyed my  stay here and would certainly stay here again in the future.  Thank you Jacqueline!!
3383329,20012662,2014-09-22,13533650,Sarah,"Very much enjoyed my stay at Jacqueline's apartment.  She was a very friendly and responsive host. The place was exactly has described and had everything we needed for our stay. The location was awesome, could walk to everything we wanted to see in Fremont.  Had no problems parking in the lot each night. We had seen the reviews about the children upstairs and didn't think it would disrupt our stay since we were only planning on being at the apartment to sleep but the noise from the apartment above was constant and went well into the late night and very early morning.  Aside from that, this is great place to stay."
3383329,20200142,2014-09-25,20907690,Antar,"I was really impressed with Jacqueline and Moody Hues.  Jacqueline was a very friendly and attentive host who was easy to reach and communicate with.  Moody Hues was clean, welcoming and warm. There was great attention to detail and many nice comforts of home throughout the space.  Jacqueline thought of everything and then some.  The neighborhood was great and  very close to Freemont's main strip which had a trendy vibe.  Theo chocolate is a highlight in the area.  Totally enjoyed my stay and would highly recommend."
3383329,20499393,2014-09-30,4122954,Georgiana,We enjoyed our stay at MoodyHues immensely.  The apt was welcoming and set up with the essentials we needed since we arrived late in the evening weary from our trip.  Jacqueline checked in with us several times to make sure everything was okay.  It's conveniently located for trips into the city as well as walking to great restaurants in Fremont and the Green Market on Sunday.
3383329,20905941,2014-10-07,20315322,Joanna,It was my first airbnb experience And Jacqueline was super helpful and nice. Thank you so much for having us stay at your apartment.
3383329,22652485,2014-11-11,13620478,Lauren,"We had a wonderful stay/experience at Jacqueline's apartment. I can't even think of anything bad to say about the stay. We were very cozy, and the apartment is very inviting. I thought the door/lock worked well and made for easy entry and leaving--worth it! "
3383329,23772008,2014-12-09,23877970,Patricia,"The home was spacious, clean, organized and comfortable. Jacqueline provided great directions and we were greeted with a handwritten card and chocolate bar from a local chocolatier.  There were local magazines which we used to find fun things to do in the city. The kitchen was fully stocked with amenities which made it easy to cook in the home."
3383329,24295064,2014-12-25,2438160,Matthew & Martha,Moody Hues was a good resting place.  The bed and bathroom were very comfortable.  We used the kitchen to bake cookies and puddings for the holidays.  The location is great for access to Ballard and Fremont with good off street parking.  A very low friction and pleasant stay!
3383329,24490040,2014-12-29,17844337,Anne,"The place is exactly as described- cozy, warm, clean in a very quiet lovely neighborhood.  
Jacqueline checked on us on  our arrival and 
welcomed us with the delicious chocolate bars.  We definitely will stay at her place again!"
3383329,24825805,2015-01-03,19288233,Catherine,"Jacqueline was a great host. She gave us a personalized list of recommendations for the area. The apartment was very comfortable with lots of kid-friendly touches (books, toys, dishes, towels...)
The parking was very easy and the location was super convenient for running on the Burke Gilman trail and driving to other attractions (zoo, Green Lake Park, Ballard).
The only slight downside was the noise of footsteps in the apartment above."
3383329,25153193,2015-01-07,25442809,Austin,"We had a wonderful time staying here! The place is adorable and very cozy, and we loved being within walking distance of many great restaurants and shops in Fremont. We did hear some noise coming from the upstairs neighbors at times, but it wasn't too disturbing. I would definitely recommend this apartment to others!"
3383329,25414034,2015-01-15,4615725,Hassan,"We had a really good time staying at Jacqueline's place. The apartment was very comfortable and cozy and the location was very convenient and close enough to the city. Jacqueline was a great and very helpful host, I absolutely recommend staying at her place. "
3383329,25713615,2015-01-24,25096058,Carolyn,"Moody Hues was perfect for my week long stay in Seattle.  I really appreciated that Jacqueline took the time before I arrived late at night to turn on all the lights and heat so it was a warm welcome after a long plane ride.  The apartment is exactly like the listing, only the apartment is more charming in person.  I would be more than happy to stay here again!"
3383329,25881624,2015-01-28,4697529,Vivian,"What a lovely time! Everything that Jacqueline's describe we had it. Great house, super comfortable, good neighborhood (just 15 min by car from downtown), next to restaurants, bars and some shops.
Our days were perfect and Jacqueline is a great host! 
We really enjoyed our time in Seattle. :) "
3383329,26302332,2015-02-09,2088066,Emily,"We had a very positive experience at MOODY HUES, KID FRIENDLY in FREMONT February 4-8, 2015!  The apartment is located in a safe neighborhood and close to many shops and restaurants.  The interior of the apartment is very clean, comfortable, well-stocked and quite nicely decorated.  There was a nice selection of books, a Keurig machine with a wide selection of coffees, tea, and hot chocolate, an adequate selection of pans, and lovely glassware and dishes in the kitchen.  The bathroom was stocked with shampoo, conditioner, hand soap, tissues, and a hair dryer.  The bed and bedding were comfortable and closet space, with many hangars was spacious.  My adult daughter wanted to spread out so she chose to sleep on the trundle-style couch that pulled out into a full size bed in the living room and found it to be very comfortable.    It certainly would be large enough for two small children.  The communication with our host, Jacqueline, prior to our arrival was easy and she presented herself as highly professional.  We were greeted with a handwritten card and a delicious bar of chocolate from a local store, upon arrival.  We plan to return to Seattle many more times to visit my son and definitely want to stay here again!
 "
3383329,27032009,2015-02-23,20594132,Nick,"The place matched the description perfectly. It was quiet, clean and had plenty of amenities. The host was very nice and helpful. Would definitely stay there again.  "
3383329,27463501,2015-03-05,26600404,Agnes,"We loved our home-away-from-home, it was perfect for our needs. The description and pictures on your site are accurate, the location is perfect, couple of blocks from restaurants, bars, coffee. Our host, Jacqueline, welcomed us with a selection of books and magazines about Seattle. There was local chocolate, coffee, tea and cocoa waiting for us.  We strongly recommend the apartment."
3383329,27758411,2015-03-11,10127261,Gregory,Jacqueline was the perfect host. Communication was supurb. Security system for entry into the place reassuring. I am confident that no one would breach lock system. Very nice and comfortable apartment. If I go back to Seattle this would be my first choice
3383329,27990988,2015-03-16,24859220,Phillip,"

This was a great spot in a great neighborhood. Usually travelling in a metro area can be stressful even if it is for a vacation, but we left feeling relaxed and rejuvenated. This is largely due to the effort the owner has put in to make the space accommodating--especially to families.  Had a great time!"
3383329,28180885,2015-03-19,7590415,Lauren,Jacqueline was absolutely incredible.  She had all of the information attached to an email making the accessibility and stay seamless.  She was nothing but hospitable.  The area in Fremont is great as well.  The apartment was just a short walk away from the main (Fremont) downtown.  I would definitely stay again the next time I visit Seattle.
3383329,28513891,2015-03-25,24937982,Tatiana,"We had a wonderful stay and were extremely comfortable.  The apartment was immaculate.  It seemed to have everything we could want, but wasn't cluttered at all.  The closets, cupboards and many hooks made it easy to put our own things out of the way.  
We didn't meet Jacqueline, but she checked in several times by text/email and responded quickly."
3383329,28864769,2015-03-31,25522638,Brianna,"We had a fantstic stay here with our two young daughters. Jacqueline reached out prior to our arrival and offered up a number of kid-items to make our stay more enjoyable (portable high chair, changing table, BOB stroller, kids bike, etc). The apartment is an easy walk to Theo Chocolates, cafes, restaurants and a wonderful natural foods market as well as having easy access to a number of Seattle attractions by car and/or public transit. It was a very clean, safe place and we would happily stay there again. "
3383329,30289372,2015-04-20,26801998,Valerie,"I would stay here again! Jacqueline was a great host. My husband and I stayed here with our two children. I have no complaints about the apartment and would recommend it to others. It's in a great neighborhood and is within walking distance to many places (Downtown Fremont, dining, grocery, etc...) "
3383329,30525703,2015-04-23,4379507,Chris,"Great experience! Host was very accommodating, and made us feel at home.  Apartment was clean and in a great area.  Would definitely stay again."
3383329,31141793,2015-05-02,17842178,Julianna,"Jacqueline was a gracious host. Her place was clean, comfortable and private. We happened to run into each other outside, as she is renovating an upstairs apartment - she was very sweet, personable and helpful about the best places to go in Seattle (and Vancouver, BC where we were headed next)! I'd definitely book with her again."
3383329,32270094,2015-05-16,20998319,Brittany,"Jacquelines' place was amazing. The apartment was just as pictured. Elegant but casual. The neighborhood was easy to navigate and easily accessible by cab, and even walking if you're up to it. Jacqueline was a great host. This was my first Airbnb experience, and the communication between us was prompt but not intrusive. It shows through the apartment and her interaction that she takes pride in what she does and it was very much appreciated. "
3383329,32537148,2015-05-19,27191588,Jared,"Jacqueline was an awesome host, both prior to and during our visit to Seattle.  She made the stay at Moody Hues very comfortable with easy instructions and regular contact with us.  The apartment looked and felt modern and cozy, and we can tell a lot of great work went into creating an environment that felt like home.  I can't recommend Jacqueline or Moody Hues enough, so I recommend anyone looking for a great stay while in Seattle to look no further than here!"
3383329,32985109,2015-05-24,30855310,Raul,"Jacqueline was an amazing hostess, and we found her posting to be 100% accurate. It's not easily travelling with a young child, and I think our trip was only possible by staying here. It was in a great location, parking was convenient,  and it never took us longer than twenty minutes to get anywhere. 

The apartment itself was immaculate. Everything was in complete working order, and she delivered on all reasonable requests. We will definitely be bookmarking this listing for future visits! "
3383329,33769960,2015-06-01,20925217,Michelle,"We were so happy with this lovely apartment, and Jacqueline was so thoughtful as a host, gifts of chocolate,  beer and a card. The accommodation is gorgeous with all you would need for a great stay, and easy parking in private lot. Great location. We would definitely recommend this one!"
3383329,35765178,2015-06-22,3630955,Karen,"We absolutely loved our few weeks at Moody Hues! Jacqueline's attention to detail is fabulous from the beautiful ceramic plates to the large range of kitchen appliances. Her communication levels are top notch, which us always a bonus. Add in that the flat is in a super location and we wouldn't have stayed anywhere else. Thank you Jacqueline from your new friends in the Marshall Islands."
3383329,36179850,2015-06-26,31519120,Katie,"Location was great (easy to walk to restaurants, coffee shops, and a chocolate factory), and the apartment itself was SPECTACULAR. Could not ask for a better space! We loved the little decor details (that chandelier!). We had a small problem with the wifi when we got there, but one quick touch-in with the owners fixed that immediately! Jacqueline is super nice and super helpful. If we're ever back in Seattle, I would rush to book this location again!"
3383329,36513412,2015-06-29,29741781,Aleisha,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Jacqueline set the standard high!  We relished the thoughtful details she put into this place to make it welcoming and practical as a home away from home. We were greeted with a sweet card and amazing local chocolate. The kitchen was complete with all the pots, pans, appliances, etc., necessary to prepare a nice meal of fresh seafood (which we fully intended to do but ran out of time). Next time we are in Seattle, we will have to stay here again so we can curl up next to the fireplace with one of the interesting books stacked neatly on the table. The location was perfect - easy walking distance to a plethora of restaurants and bars. I highly recommend this Seattle gem."
3383329,37039802,2015-07-04,30078315,Gabriel,"We loved it!  The Roots Apartment was accurately described, clean, affordable, and cozy.  Jacqueline was responsive and even left a welcome note with a local chocolate!"
3383329,37446583,2015-07-07,6779303,Liz,What can I say about the Moody Hues except it was wonderful!! We explored all around Fremont and even found a few local favs we went to on more than one occasion (Roxy's is a MUST). The apt was perfect for our stay and we'd love to come back when we visit in January!! Thanks for making my first visit (of many) a memorable one! 
3383329,38251258,2015-07-14,111125,Lynda,The apt was just as the listing described. Jacqueline left me a locally made chocolate bar and a note and checked in with me. She was great and I'm learning some things about being a host from her too. I would stay here again for sure. 
3383329,39755094,2015-07-26,33185326,Kristen,Jacqueline was an awesome host and the apartment was gorgeous! She was very quick to respond to messages and ensured that we were enjoying our stay. She also allowed us to check in early since our flight came in very early in the morning. I would recommend Moody Hues to anyone staying in the Seattle area! It was close to everything and offered a lot of great shops within walking distance. 
3383329,40199049,2015-07-29,28050123,Russ,"Very good place to stay
Great host
Great location in Fremont

Thanks "
3383329,40580639,2015-08-01,33069606,Alexandria,"Jacqueline was wonderful and incredibly welcoming! We really enjoyed the apartment which looks exactly like the pictures. Will definitely stay here again, the next time I'm in Seattle!"
3383329,41064281,2015-08-04,30363338,Hailey,This place was lovely. Getting in and seeing a personal card and chocolate made me and my friend feel very welcome. It was clean and organized. The very few questions we did have were answered very quickly after sending our host a message. It was a very pleasant experience. I would stay here again!
3383329,41923903,2015-08-10,29958079,Ryan,The place was clean with plenty of room. We really enjoyed our stay.
3383329,42648674,2015-08-15,26682511,Hyunju,She was so nice and welcoming! She wrote us a card and gave us a delicious chocolate and it was so sweet! My friends and I felt like it was home and relaxing. 
3383329,43898350,2015-08-23,27286567,Michael,"This was our first time using Airbnb, and we were surprised at how awesome this turned out.  The apartment is so clean , beautifully decorated.  The neighborhood was perfect for walking, easy to get in and out of.  Jacqueline is such a great person to talk with and meet. A personal welcome note make you feel like a guest that is cared about.  She really wanted us to have a great time gave us many tips and suggestions.  The Theo Chocolate bar she left for us as a welcome gift had us hooked. The bed was comfy for a mid day nap sleeping all night or whatever relaxation you need.  Temperatures in the apartment stayed cool even on a 90 degree day we slept wonderfully.  The greatest thing was there was a parking lot for us to use and always parking right next to the apartment up the hill a bit.  Freemont was so fun we didn't go do some stuff we planed outside of Seattle due to so much to see in Freemont.  Follow Jacqueline's recommendations she is right every time. She knows the area very well.  Walking to the ship channel became our favorite thing to do in the mornings.  The Freemont Bridge is within walking distance to sit and watch it raise and lower in it's beautiful colors.  There are plenty of pots pans dishes and other stuff to use in the kitchen if somehow you don't find a restaurant to eat at while in the area.  A fancy grocery store is within walking distance.  There is a Fred Meyer and Safeway very close by car.  People, dogs, commuters in the neighborhood are all very polite driving and walking.  Have fun in the area relax in the great apartment enjoy life every day you are there."
3383329,44349771,2015-08-25,17171176,Terry,"We have stayed at another unit that Jacqueline offers on airbnb and both experiences have been excellent.  She is very responsive and each unit was spacious, immaculate, and very comfortable.  The units are created with an eye for style and detail, and the pride that Jacqueline has in showcasing her units is very evident,  Thank you again for a wonderful stay!"
3383329,44888090,2015-08-30,30771173,Summer,"This apartment was absolutely perfect for our family of three. It was very clean and well-maintained and had everything we needed. Jacqueline was a fantastic host. She responded quickly and was super helpful. The parking situation is great. There are four slots in the lot and the street always had ample parking.  

The kitchen and bathroom were well stocked with necessities. It was nice that the host provided nice shampoo, conditioner and body wash. I had everything I needed to cook meals in the kitchen. It's a small kitchen, but two people can work in with a little coordination. The couch in the front room pulls out in a nice bed that was perfect for my daughter. It's also long enough for an adult. 

I love that the place is kid friendly. My daughter enjoyed reading some of the books left for her (Jacqueline even contacted me prior to arrival to ask her age so that she could leave out appropriate things for her). There is a full set of kids dishes and cutlery and lots of toys in the sofa storage box (most are geared younger, but my daughter found some imaginative ways to play with them anyway).

I love this neighborhood. There are so many things within walking distance and it's just a short drive to many popular Seattle attractions. The location is fantastic.

All in all, we had a great trip and it was made that much better by having a comfortable, clean and convenient place to stay.  Upon my next trip to Seattle, if one of Jacqueline's apartments is available again (she has several in this building) I will definitely be staying there again. "
3383329,45801835,2015-09-06,39190058,Sarah,"Five star! Jacqueline's place is very lovely, it's clean and tidy, and it provides all the necessities we need for our stay. Location is very convenient as well, it's minutes from the market. The cost is very reasonable for what you are getting. All three of us enjoyed the local chocolate she left for us, that's a very nice touch.

I travelled with a married couple, they stayed in the bedroom and I used the sofa bed. It wasn't a big deal for us but just wanted to point it out that the bathroom entry is inside the bedroom, for those of you that may find this inconvenient.

The apartment is kind of hidden in a corner where I wouldn't have thought of to look. I made the mistake not reading Jacqueline's house manual carefully, therefore I had to bother her in the middle of the night trying to find the apartment. Make sure you read her instruction on where the apartment entry is!"
3383329,46267224,2015-09-09,29349574,Cody,"From the moment we walked in, my girlfriend and I knew this was going to be an amazing Air BnB experience! There was a cute little note from her kids welcoming us along with a bar of local chocolate!...The vibe described in her profile was absolutely on point and the pictures absolutely did it justice. Although we didn't spend a ton of time in the Air BnB we found ourselves just wanting to go back and hang out in it just because it felt so good in there, it quickly became a part of our vacation, rather than just a place we were staying. 

I would absolutely recommend anybody stay in this place, I'd give it 10 out of 10 stars and even though I never met Jacqueline in person, she was absolutely wonderful to deal with over messaging and I could tell she truly wanted to make sure we had a great experience, and we did! "
3383329,46862407,2015-09-14,31751470,Jessica,"Jacqueline was a great host. The place was perfect for my boyfriend and my stay. Everything was ready when we arrived. The code is easy to use and made a late arrival easy; no need to meet up for keys! Jacqueline had dark chocolate from a must visit chocolate factory a quick walk away.

The kitchen is ready to go for anyone who wants to cook. We were especially pleased with the stocked Keurig which came in handy every morning. She has many magazines and guides about Seattle which we used to get some recommendations for restaurants. 

The neighborhood was perfect, there is a ton to do nearby and its easy bus ride to get downtown. We spent a day exploring Freemont and a day downtown.

I would highly recommend this place for anyone's next visit to Seattle!"
3383329,47677378,2015-09-21,20161159,Julia,We had a great time in Seattle and the appartement was wonderful!!! Everything was clean and friendly!!! The 20 minutes Bus drive to Downtown Seattle was absoluteKy okay for us. The neighbourhood is nice and Jacqueline was a great host. Supermarket and Restaurants are in walking distance. We would definetly choose this appartment again!!!
3383329,48499793,2015-09-27,33609690,Andrew,"First time AirBnb users here - we stayed here for a week for vacation. The place was amazing! Location was great, quiet area, far enough from downtown but close enough for easy accessibility. Condo was well-equipped, Jacqueline followed up to see if we needed anything mid-stay. I would recommend this place to anyone coming to Seattle! "
3383329,49107387,2015-10-01,5002876,Isabelle,"We had an absolutely wonderful stay at Jacqueline's apartment. Check-in was really simple, each AirBnB guest gets their personal keycode, so they can check-in anytime they like without having to arrange a meeting beforehand. Jacqueline left us a very sweet personal note and a delicious chocolate from local chocolatier Theo on the table. The apartment has everything you need - large sofa, comfy bed, fully equipped kitchen, nice bathroom with towels, a washer and dryer, but no TV, which isn't a problem at all with Netflix and Amazon Prime nowadays :). Parking was always easy. We never had to street park since there was always at least one free parking spot in the lot. I'd definitely stay at Jacqueline's apartment again. Absolutely loved it!"
3383329,49431181,2015-10-04,28723383,Yi Jae,"좋은 곳이었습니다. 동네도 깔끔한 곳에 있어서 맘에 들었습니다. 다운타운에는 버스로 25분 정도 걸리는데 괜찮은 수준입니다.

아파트 자체도 전체적으로 다 깨끗하고요, 생수를 따로 살 필요없는 주전자형 정수기, 캡슐커피머신, 오븐, 냉장고, 전자레인지, 세탁기, 건조기 다 잘 갖추어져 있습니다.

소규모 가족에게 딱 좋을 것 같습니다."
3383329,50073653,2015-10-09,20494160,Corey,"The listing and photos were accurate of the listing and was located in a convenient part of town.  Fredmont had a lot to offer in the way culture, food, and drink; with not being too far away from any other part of Seattle.  The listing was secure and felt safe at all times."
3383329,50623130,2015-10-13,38783705,Jessica,"This 1 bedroom apt provided adequate space for our family with 2 kiddos (2, 4yrs old).  
Jacqueline was easy to contact, quick to respond.  She provided a pack n play, booster high chair seat and sleeping bag.  She even put out special character towels (spiderman, batman) for them!  The toys were an added bonus for helping entertain our boys on a rainy day.  
The written instructions for finding the apt entrance and parking were very helpful."
3383329,51014722,2015-10-17,34948096,Amy,Jacqueline was simply amazing.  Were were welcomed with a cute card and a Theo chocolate bar (made in Seattle and not far from Moody Hues!).  You can never go wrong with chocolate :P .  Any issues we had were resolved quickly and the space was wonderful.  The neighborhood was pretty quiet other than the street traffic.  We would absolutely stay here again!
3383329,51525289,2015-10-21,36671847,Nancy,"Jacqueline is amazing. She's super communicative, friendly, and helpful. I am really impressed with her attention to detail and how much she made us feel instantly comfortable, happy, and at home. We had a late night check-in so the keypad lock was extremely convenient. I loved finding the welcoming handwritten card and the chocolate when we got in. The apartment is very clean and cozy with everything you might need and more. We slept very well here and enjoyed having the black-out curtains. Thanks so much for having us! We had a lovely time."
3383329,52053303,2015-10-26,41009408,Maria,"When we arrived at 'Moody Hues' we were delighted with our funky, modern and clean the space was. The owners were incredibly thoughtful staging the space especially for our family of four. One out of many unique details were that we found four freshly cleaned towels, two of which were super hero themed because they knew we had two young boys. The location of the apartment was absolutely perfect, within walking distance of all the restaurants and places we wanted to see in the Fremont neighborhood. We will definitely look up Moody Hues again the next time we are visiting Seattle!!!"
3383329,52518850,2015-10-30,46236330,Jennifer,Jacqueline could not have been a more gracious host. She was amazing to work with. Located in a great neighborhood;  walking distance to great shops and amazing resturants. Our stay at Moody Hues made the trip to Seattle memorable! 
3383329,52975911,2015-11-03,44467519,Emily,"This was our first Airbnb experience and I'm so glad it was here! We were welcomed with a lovely card & an amazing chocolate from a local chocolate business. The apartment was spacious, welcoming, cozy and so clean! There was even eggs & milk in the fridge along with coffee. Jacqueline was very helpful, suggesting local places to find gluten free foods for me and quick to respond to messages for anything we may need. I would stay here again next time I'm in town and would highly recommend anyone else to stay here as well. "
3383329,53994761,2015-11-15,19938082,Adam,"This place was a dream! Great decor, and close to the trendy Fremont village. Jacqueline did a great job of welcoming us with a little card and treat left in the suite, which we found on arrival. The checkin/out process went smoothly, and Jacqueline always seemed friendly, accessible and communicative. "
3383329,54306900,2015-11-18,26058876,Carolyn,"From check-in to check-out, everything was a breeze. Mindful decor & natural elements - what's not to love! I had a wonderful vacation in Seattle sight-seeing & loved coming back to this apartment. I adore baths & the wide tub + heater was a luxury away from home. 

Can't wait to book one of the other apartments on my next trip here! "
3383329,54706941,2015-11-23,16793053,Addy,Great apartment in the Fremont area of Seattle. Public transportation into downtown was accessible. Great restaurants/bars/coffee shops less than 10 minutes away walking. The kitchen would have been great to cook in if we had had more time in Seattle! We did not meet Jacqueline in person but she was accessible via email. 
3383329,55357027,2015-12-01,19459912,David,"Had a great stay at Jacqueline's place! Plenty of space for the 3 of us, comfy beds, great shower, and the kitchen was perfect for preparing the dishes we took over to our daughter's for Thanksgiving. Plus the location was excellent, a lot to do and see in the neighborhood and easy access to the in-town attractions. A fine spot & a great value!"
3383329,57757540,2015-12-29,645719,Betsi,"Jacqueline was a fantastic host.  She was always quick to respond to questions and was very helpful in providing suggestions for our toddler. The apartment is PERFECTLY situated near Fremont and close to bus lines, parks, groceries, and the BG Trail.  The bed was very comfortable.  The small kitchen was just right for us and our one month stay. The waffle iron was a treat for special mornings. Highly highly recommend.   "
226536,715263,2011-11-13,1394729,Willa,Cheryl was a wonderful host and helped us feel right at home. She was very helpful in suggesting restaurants for us as well. Her cozy spot was exactly what we needed for a peaceful getaway. 
226536,730694,2011-11-19,1410885,Haley,"I had a wonderful stay, I wish I could have stayed longer. The bed was comfy and quite. Cheryl was delightful, acomidating and great with driving directions. The location is very close to the city but far enough away to be quiet. Parking was easy too."
226536,971382,2012-03-05,1670308,Mark,Cheryl is the perfect host always willing to help. You get more of a sense of home and family when you stay with her.
226536,1880240,2012-08-03,261975,Jonathan,"Cheryl was a gracious, relaxed host. Made us feel very welcome without being intrusive.  She is a rising star in the sewing world!  The room is in the basement, but is comfortably appointed.  We were there in the summer so the cool temperature in the room was welcome, but I imagine it may be a little chilly in the winter.  I'm sure Cheryl has it figured out.  Her friendly dog will never say no to a treat from the jar on the counter.  The accommodation worked perfectly for our stay."
226536,3970768,2013-04-01,4234024,Lauren,"To be honest, though Cheryl herself is a great lady, my boyfriend and I had a really mixed experience here.

First, Cheryl is a VERY sweet, kind-hearted woman who is a driven, talented independent designer.  She was willing to accommodate me and my boyfriend for 3 months, then our baby for a few weeks just after he was born, which was a true blessing and a saving grace as I finished school!

However, this room is one area of a dark basement (not a sunny cottage) that has no access point except through the main house, and no room door separating it from the rest of the basement that is home to Cheryl's sewing supplies and printer.  She comes down to access these at will (she'll usually nicely ask first -- though there were several times in the middle of the night or early morn where she came in anyway when she assumed we were sleeping).  She was kind enough to hang a tapestry up on request -- though it was a month after we asked -- so that the room at least felt to be sectioned off, but we both agreed that it never really seemed to be its own room, which was hard for a long-term stay.   

Cheryl uses this rented room partially as a storage space, and we felt like we were a bit of a hassle for requesting that we move her things into a different area of the basement so we could have space for our things.  Being new parents, we admittedly had way too much stuff, but it still seemed a little unfair that the room we were paying for was half full of things already.  This probably wouldn't be an issue for a short-term stay, however, and if you were to ask, Cheryl would jump at the chance to help, though she might not easily find space for the things, as pretty much every corner, drawer, shelf, and nook of her house is packed with things.

Her dogs and cat are characters!  Very cute and unique.  You may be asked to take them out in the backyard if you're at the house while Cheryl is at work.  If you have allergies to pet dander at all, beware:  there is hair everywhere.   

Cheryl is very generous with food, and we shared many-a-meal with her, which was lovely.  She'll freely tell her life stories and show you sewing projects she's working on.  She is charming, but she joked with us about how she is anal about the way her house is kept, which is very true.  There were at least 40 particularities we counted that she repeatedly mentioned we do & not do.  But again, this is another thing that might not be an issue in shorter stays.

All in all, Cheryl is a good-natured person, but we cannot honestly recommend this room unless you are staying briefly, looking for something affordable, & not bothered by the above mentioned things.   "
226536,5351999,2013-06-25,547465,Matthew,"Cheryl was a lovely host and I had a great experience at her place. It is cozy, clean, and inviting and Cheryl was great at giving tips about where to go around town and for wonderful conversation. Wouldn't hesitate to come back again!"
226536,10412184,2014-02-17,11903561,Michael,"Staying with Cheryl was an absolute delight. She is very accommodating, kind, and an overall wonderful host. Highly recommend staying at her place."
226536,11356615,2014-03-31,5041448,Sara,"I greatly enjoyed staying with Cheryl. The house is in a wonderful location, conveniently located near two different bus lines and right at the entrance to Discovery Park, one of the largest green spaces in Seattle, with miles of hiking, beaches, and exploring opportunities. 
Cheryl is easy going, gracious, and a great conversationalist. The room is set up with everything you need, just show up with your clothes and you’ll be set. She was very helpful about giving advice on things to do or places to go. 
The animal friends at the house are great. Both the dog and cat are well behaved and sweet. It was so nice to be greeted by them everyday. 
Overall, staying here was a fantastic experience, I recommend it. "
226536,12318811,2014-04-28,9558158,Erin,"Cheryl was a lovely host - very accommodating and very dear.  Her home is warm and cozy with her own artistic accents throughout. The house is in a quiet neighborhood conveniently located next to beautiful running, biking, and hiking trails.  I really enjoyed our conversations and had a blast playing with her animals.  I look forward to seeing her again when I come back in the fall!"
226536,14216337,2014-06-14,8616871,Sovannaroth,The space is very clean and the host is very cool. 
226536,14330986,2014-06-16,10622915,Omid,"Beside being a great designer, Cheryl is a fantastic host.  I stayed with her for 3 days, and It was easy to feel at home there! She even provided the towels .  The bed is very comfortable, and the dogs are super fun to play with.  During my last day of stay, she even cooked a delicious spaghetti for us.  She is very responsible, and made sure that I am feeling comfortable in the house."
226536,22630189,2014-11-10,21801739,Jonathan,Cheryl made me feel at home. She was  very curteous and helped point me around Seattle. The room was comfortable and plenty of space for to put my stuff. Her place was in a very relaxed and wonderful part of Magnolia! It is pet friendly!
226536,24232800,2014-12-23,23725551,Scott,"Cheryl went above and beyond to make me feel welcome in her home.  She was also especially accommodating to my work hours during my stay, which were truly all over the map.  The room and bed were extremely cozy and comfortable, the neighborhood was very quiet, and it was awesome to be so close to Discovery Park and its trails!  Cheryl also invited me to a home-cooked meal from time to time, which was really cool.

I would highly recommend her place to anyone looking for a quiet piece of Seattle."
226536,33811613,2015-06-01,10608608,Kuang,"Cheryl was a wonderful host, and the place is great for the price. I would definitely recommend the place short or long stay."
226536,34470901,2015-06-08,33210359,Claudia,"In 5 bullet points: best host you can imagine!!, awesome place!, very close Discovery park, 30 walking minutes from Beach, close to Downtown (via Bus) and Ballard Shopping Street. GO THERE!

Cheryl is the best host ever! She gave me a great time, and I was so glad I could spend some time together with her. She was very helpful and provided me with lots of information what to do in the neighbourhood. She was so helpful, kind and nice, just to name a few of the things: one evening she cooked awesome spaghetti for us, I could spend time with her (that was really so much fun), and when I went to the airport and a strip of my bag broke, she helped me out.
I would have loved to stay there longer and would definitely stay there again. I made a new friend, and I'm really so glad I met her. It was my first stay via Airbnb and it could not have been any better.
I searched for a room to sleep in, and when I was there it felt like coming home.

I received a very warm welcome! The room is awesome. A very soft, big nice bed with lots of pillows. I had a great sleep. The room and the neighbourhood are very quite. The room has 2 closets and I also got 2 towels. The house is beautiful, lots of art and designs. Just great!
There are Jackx (2 years old Labrador) and Barben, a very cute cat who both love to cuddle. They made my stay even better.

Cheryl provided me with detailed feedback regarding the directions to find the place. The taxi driver used his navi and he found the place easily.

Neighbourhood: plan some time to walk through the locks (you can see salmons swimming up the fish ladder), then you can walk along the coast to a very nice beach. There's also a place to rent SUPs.
The way back I walked through Ballard, lots of small arty shops (that close between 6 and 7 pm however). Plan some time for Discovery Park, that's really nice. "
226536,34810538,2015-06-12,34380779,Tanja,"The room was great and the bed very comfy. Cheryl's house is very warm and cozy. The loction is great because the busstop is just around the corner with two buses going directly to downtown. Cheryl is just lovely! She has a great humor and is very helpful regarding any questions about the City, where to eat and what to see! Last but not least her dog and cat are just craaaaazy ☺"
226536,34916481,2015-06-13,5291258,New,"Cheryl was very very gracious.  She made us feel welcome and I really enjoyed hearing about her home-based business.  This is the first time we have ever stayed IN someone's home in a room and, although it was an adjustment for us, it was just fine.  The bed was extremely comfortable.  We also loved her dog and cat!"
226536,35123940,2015-06-15,33877676,Monica,"Cheryl and her home was lovely, colorful and quirky in the best ways. Not only did she have the most adorable pets but she also made us feel at home. We came to Seattle to run a marathon and when we returned she was so proud of us.  "
226536,35359576,2015-06-17,10527177,Jan,"I was in a crunch to book a room for the same day and Cheryl made it very easy for me. She was very quick to respond, easy to communicate with and accommodating to our schedule. The overall experience was a pleasure! "
226536,35581688,2015-06-20,8145234,Alexa,"I had an absolute blast staying with Cheryl in her home! The listing was as described, and the zoo was the most lovable pair I've ever encountered. 

Her neighborhood was easily accessible to downtown by bus. (Great for me since I didn't feel like renting a car!) Walking over to Discovery Park for a hike on the Loop Trail and to Ballard for delicious dessert was a breeze. 

I would definitely recommend her place if you want some much needed peace and quiet after a busy day in the midst of the hustle and bustle of downtown. Hope I can make it back to the area soon because I would stay here again in a heartbeat!  :)"
226536,35721199,2015-06-21,1904401,Rochelle,Cheryl made us feel very welcome and was very kind. Comfortable bed and pleasant stay!
226536,39164218,2015-07-21,30866390,Yuntao,Cheryl was sooo nice and helpful to me and I really enjoyed my long stay. She not only made me feel at home but also made me feel like we were family. The house was lovely and the neighborhood was quiet. And I loved her dog and cat so much!!
226536,49972599,2015-10-08,4398697,Jillian,Cheryl is a very thoughtful and warm host with a cute space and adorable pets! She really goes out of her way to make you feel at home!
226536,50563744,2015-10-12,32013739,Krista,"Even though I was only staying a few days, I felt at home in Cheryl's house. The room was great and the bed was comfortable. Discovery Park was a 10 minute walk from the house and downtown was about 15 minutes away by car. Cheryl was extremely helpful in giving me ideas on places to go and things to see! "
226536,52458298,2015-10-29,46990331,James,"Cheryl's house was so nice and cozy, and it was a perfect location for discover park and fisherman's terminal, where I was working!  Unfortunately, I didn't get to meet Cheryl because she was away, but she was very helpful with all my needs, and it was very easy to get in touch with her."
2950213,14212914,2014-06-14,16529566,Michelle,"This was a fantastic place in an excellent neighborhood, exactly as advertised. Walking distance to great restuarants and fun pubs, very quiet and neat.  Easy taxi rides downtown. Overall an excellent experience.  Highly recommend this place if you are looking for a cool place to hang in Seattle, without having to deal with downtown. "
2950213,15336929,2014-07-07,16500312,Jeff,"myself and 2 others came to town to visit friends who live in ballard and we wanted a nice, centrally located place in the neighborhood to return to at the end of each night.  this apartment was right in the middle of downtown ballard and worked out great.  it had everything we needed for the weekend, Ginny met us upon arrival and made herself available if there was anything we needed even, and we had good communication leading up to our arrival.  shops, restaurants, coffee shops, and bars line the street, and it's all very walkable once you are in the area.  sunday morning farmer's market is about a 1 minute walk from the front door, and runs all along the main drag and was very impressive!  we did not hit up what i think many would call the big name seattle attractions (ie. space needle, experience music museum, pikes place) because that was not our focus for the trip.  we did walk over to the chittendam locks and watched the boats and the salmon runs, and that was cool.  if you are looking for an urban setting, cultured neighborhood, with great nightlife, fantastic food options, and less crowd than you'd run into in capital hill or downtown, you'd really enjoy staying here."
2950213,16258943,2014-07-24,16770327,Adam,"A very nice apartment, right in the middle of a popular neighbourhood. There are good restaurants and bars just outside the door and the centre of town is only a 10 minute drive away. Ginny was very hospitable and did her best to make sure we were comfortable. Thoroughly recommended!"
2950213,16618344,2014-07-30,17077225,Marian,"The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable, very functional.  The neighborhood was full of fun, interesting places to eat, shop and listen to music all within walking distance.  The apartment is also very close to downtown Seattle so it was a quick drive to the Pike Place Market and Seattle's City Center.  Ginny welcomed us and was very responsive to text messages during our stay.  The only challenge we had was finding parking on the weekend (Th-Sat) but to be fair, it was also the weekend before Seattle's Seafair.  "
2950213,17233079,2014-08-09,4996653,Linda,"Ginny's lovely apt sits right in the middle of the action in lively, colorful Ballard. We were not able to arrive until the evening, still, she was out on her stoop enjoying the night air & greeted us warmly. When we let ourselves into the apt, we were ready to move in! Colorful art fills all the walls & the decor was cozy. We were in town for our son's wedding, but found time to hit some coffee shops, restaurants, & galleries. It was fun to be close to Hotel Ballard & The Tractor Tavern, yet in the evenings, close the bedroom door, block the sound, & read a book or have a conversation on the cool, tiny, gardened back porch. There's no AC, but because you're close to the water, the mornings & evenings are cool. Ginny provides fans in apt if like me, you tend to ""run hot"". I was amazed that I could open the bedroom door out to the garden porch in the evening, and get a breeze w/no bugs! Delightful. Parking can be a bear if like us you find yourself transporting multiple items, but we actually found street parking relatively close. We'd love to visit again, for more than 2 days, and take in all that Ballard has to offer. Thank you, Ginny, for sharing this lovely comfy hip space."
2950213,17383967,2014-08-11,18739868,Alex,"Ginny was a great host.  She was very accommodating when my arrival time was delayed significantly (bad I-5 traffic plus some car trouble), and asked several times if I needed anything else.  I also had a few nice chats with her about the neighborhood, including some parking tips I passed on to a local friend.

The apartment itself is beautiful, and right in the middle of the action in Ballard.  It was bright, clean and well-stocked with linens.  A bonus is that it's just 2 blocks from the Sunday farmers market.  "
2950213,17532326,2014-08-13,17657905,James,"Apartment is great, exactly as advertised -- cozy but very comfortable one bedroom with a pull-out couch in living space big enough to sleep two teenagers.  Ginny very accommodating and easy to work with -- our flight was early and she even made an effort to get us into the apartment early.  And location in right in the heard of Ballard can't be beat."
2950213,17801076,2014-08-17,14756343,Donna,"This exciting place was in the heart of Ballard with lots of great eateries, pubs and bakeries.  the place is very nicely furnished.  "
2950213,18326597,2014-08-25,17573269,Phyllis,"I was in my element here amidst the wonderful artwork and fresh orchids and the whole joie de vivre of this cozy nest that looks down on the hubbub and ""scene"" below. Ideally situated, this ""pied a terre"" is just a hiccup away from all the conveniences and the action/shops, and it was a fun, invigorating walk to the historic Ballard locks which where cool to see. The Golden Gardens park, where we attended a wedding reception, was a short distance and a fabulous scenic spot for picnics and all kinds of beach fun (and we had stellar summer weather!) The apartment layout is such that one can look out on the street or get away from it all in the back bedroom or on the sweet little back porch. Loved the historic aspect of the neighborhood and building, too! All in all, Ginny was a wonderful host and this was a great experience. "
2950213,18817543,2014-09-01,3738561,Jacqueline,Great location and apartment! We loved our stay here. 
2950213,19383621,2014-09-11,20455648,Timothy,"We had an excellent experience staying at Ginny's apt.  It was exactly as described and Ginny is a wonderful host. We were working in Ballard for 2 weeks and the location was perfect.  On Sunday we loaded up on food for the week at the Farmers Market held one block away. With so many restaurants and bars within a 2 minute stroll that we mostly dined out though.   We look forward to returning we are not working and have recommended Ginny's apartment to family and friends.
"
2950213,19571172,2014-09-14,5937294,Eden,"We loved this lovely little artist studio in a bustling part of town! We really enjoyed staying here in the beautifully lit loft. The area does get a little loud with street sounds (which we didn't mind), but it's probably best for fun seekers, not solitude seekers. Ginny has tons of linens and things to make you feel cozy and restaurants and entertainment are just feet away."
2950213,20124489,2014-09-23,1308075,Luis,"The apartment was definitely one of my favorite! Ginny was able to accommodate my guests who happened to arrive earlier than expected so I was unable to meet her personally at check-in. But, from our conversations she seemed very sweet and helpful. 
The apartment is exactly as pictured, and is centrally located within walking distance to many bars, restaurants, and shops. Ginny had everything we could need already in the apt during our stay that I didn't really need to ask her for anything. I definitely want to return again.   "
2950213,20459206,2014-09-29,1507209,Penelope,"Ballard is our favorite neighborhood to stay in and this apartment is in the middle of Ballard. We didn't touch our car all weekend which was great. Ginny was a great host and it was amazing to be surrounded by her incredible artwork. The exposed bricks and high windows and back shared balcony were charming. Ginny generously gave us a late check out Sunday to accommodate strolling the farmers market which is 2 blocks down the street. 

The one thing to mention is that since it is in such a great location it can be noisy.  I thought that only the front of the apartment was lively however on one of the nights the bar next door's back patio made the back bedroom quite loud. I slept with earplugs and with the fan on to dull out the noise. 
"
2950213,21297614,2014-10-14,15584114,Amanda,"Everything about our stay here was excellent. The apartment is exactly as pictured in the listing--sunny, bright, clean, cozy, and charming. We were three New Yorkers in town for a friend's wedding and staying here was the perfect choice. Ballard is a neighborhood with lots of shops, amazing restaurants, and a farmers market on Sundays along Ballard Avenue. All of this is walking distance. I had the best sashimi I've ever had just down the street. The waterfront is also a short walk away. You head down there to see the locks, watch the boats, and enjoy the green space. To get around to other parts of the city, we used Uber, which was very affordable, but were also told the buses were easy to learn too.

Ginny was an excellent host. She was timely with her responses, and every interaction we had to have with her went very smoothly."
2950213,24004608,2014-12-16,8850842,Frank,To describe this as a charming artist's loft is an understatement. The apartment is filled with beautiful art and objects raised to the level of art. We hope we are lucky enough to get a chance to stay here in the future.
2950213,24208160,2014-12-22,235485,Al,"The apartment is in a great location in Ballard. We walked everywhere from here, even to the bus stop for a ride to the Space Needle (Chihuly Glass, really). We set the heat to be just right for us after a day in the rain, warm and toasty!  Sunday was sunny and lots of light shone thru the living room but not in the bedroom, so we could sleep in late. Sunday market just steps away. We had a great time and will return to stay in this way cool digs. "
2950213,24548520,2014-12-30,306615,Tara,"Our experience at Ginny's apt in Ballard was fantastic!  Ginny was a great communicator and made sure that we had all the information we needed prior to arrival, she also checked in with us during our stay.  The apartment is colorful and artsy, cozy and warm, full of charm and located right in the middle of the best part of Ballard.  As other reviews mention, there will be a bit of evening noise below on a Sat night, yet I had my earplugs since I was sleeping in the living room and that's the point of staying there to be amidst all the activity.  My parents slept in the back bedroom and it was quiet for them.   We enjoyed exploring the Sunday Farmers market, ate at some delicious restaurants and watched the Seahawks game from Bad Alberts. We look forward to coming back to stay here again next summer.  Such a lovely 3 days!  Thanks Ginny."
2950213,25111451,2015-01-06,13285403,Lynn,"Such a cute apartment in the heart of Ballard. Fabulous location, charming funky-chic decor. A wonderful place to stay. "

2950213,29584257,2015-04-09,1575627,Huda,"Ginny was a fantastic host - she was quick to respond to my last-minute reservation and offered great tips on what to see in the area during my stay. The apartment is stunning with high ceilings and lots of exposed brick. I really enjoyed my stay and would come again. If you're in the area, I highly recommend booking here."
2950213,29880257,2015-04-13,30298745,Nicole,"Wonderful location and charming home! The perfect Seattle experience within walking distance to bars, restaurants, the locks, and Market Street in Ballard!
Very cozy apartment and comfortable for 4 people. Ginny was wonderful to work with."

2950213,35374646,2015-06-18,10843588,Sara,"Ginny's place was a perfect little landing space for our family during the craziness of graduation week. With our changing flow of family and friends, having a keypad number rather than a key was SO very convenient. The apartment is so tiny but somehow never seemed to feel cramped! We greatly appreciated the thoughtful touches throughout, like the water purifier, the peppermint tea bags. The porch is charming, but connects into a neighbor's apartment, which was rather confusing. Our wifi service was never very strong, but for the most part we were too busy to care. Ballard is one of our favorite Seattle neighborhoods and this location was great! Ginny sent us a heads-up about the Sunday Farmer's Market, which was a fun way to spend our afternoon. We had the windows open in the 80* weather (with the fans on, this kept the apartment at a very comfortable temperature) and the live music from the Tractor Tavern across the street drifted in. Almost wish we had stayed one more night to enjoy the San Cisco concert from the comfort of Ginny's sofa! (Or come a day earlier for the Monday night square dance!) Thanks for a beautiful stay!"
2950213,39003433,2015-07-20,24511828,Deborah,"This apartment was very comfortable for a month stay while I was working in the area. The neighborhood was fabulous! Farmer's market a block away on Sundays and some of Seattle's best restaurants within walking distance.  The blooming orchids in the windows and flowers and herbs on the balcony were a nice touch.  Sometimes the street below could be a little noisy, but the bedroom in the back was very quiet. I would highly recommend it to get the real old Ballard neighborhood experience! "
2950213,40803390,2015-08-02,4358357,Christine,We loved the location of this Airbnb. It is exactly how it looks in the pictures although it was much smaller than it looks in pics. Much more suitable for 2 people. Internet service was poor which made it difficult to plan day trips and transit. Ginny was friendly. 
2950213,41670941,2015-08-08,36671491,Mark,"The place was great and with a lot of character. Both location and house was great, I felt like I was at my friend's house.

2950213,42578773,2015-08-14,515770,David,Great location in Ballard. Very cute apartment. Need to move furniture to use sofabed as it is  a bit cramped. Real flatware rather than plastic would have been nice.  Would stay again.
2950213,43074937,2015-08-17,37579287,Emily,"We had such a nice time in this art-filled, cozy apartment in Ballard.  It was a fabulous location - walking distance to so many great restaurants, shops and cafes... the locks.  We felt like locals for the weekend!

2950213,43544953,2015-08-20,40325184,Ashley,"The location and place were great! If you really want to get an feel for what downtown Ballard is like, this is the place to stay. It is within walking distance of everything you want to go to. We walked to the locks, local coffee shops, and more. I recommend staying here to anyone traveling to Ballard. "
2950213,44543413,2015-08-27,38098253,Jay,"Ginny's Studio was charming and in the heart of Ballard.  The location was exactly where we wanted to be and walking everywhere was a breeze.
The balcony was colorful, whimsical and fun.
"
2950213,45192636,2015-08-31,8641944,Jess,"The neighborhood and the apartment were perfect! The location cannot be beat for live music, coffee shops, restaurants and unique shopping. Ginny has an adorable place and we felt right at home!  I highly recommend this place for a comfy stay in Seattle!"
2950213,46230782,2015-09-08,33624501,Yankun,"Nice trip with lovely apartment, Ginny was very nice and helpful. The location is quite good with excellent coffee shops. :) "
2950213,52894019,2015-11-02,2014761,Ryan,Ginny was very forthcoming with information and helpful tips for the stay. The space was exactly as it appeared - absolutely lovely and centrally located in Ballard. Highly recommend!
4766173,25386166,2015-01-14,17384443,Kaitlin,"Karen's space was cozy, cute, and clean. We had a great time! The location is great and within walking distance of plenty great restaurants and shops. Kind of sad we only stayed one night!"
4766173,27262249,2015-03-01,7448752,Tom,First thing- the location is just perfect. You are in the beautiful Capitol Hill and walking distance from downtown. On top of that-very cute and comfortable apartment. And it has a space needle+Snow capped mountains in the background! But the icing on the cake is Karen who was flexible in our check in/out time and generous enough to give us a lift to the bus station. Heck yeah I recommend this place!
4766173,28791476,2015-03-30,4484197,Jen,"The apartment was very comfortable and in an amazing location, with lots of restaurants and cafés nearby.  I was attending a conference downtown and it was an easy 20-minute walk to get there from the apartment. Karen was an excellent host and always responded quickly to messages. I would definitely stay here again!"
4766173,29692114,2015-04-11,28348154,Mark,Karen was very accommodating and helpful. She was going to be away when we arrived so she FedEx'd the keys to us ahead of time and everything went smoothly. The apartment was clean and comfortable and it was very conveniently situated near all of the bars and restaurants in Capital Hill.
4766173,33383299,2015-05-27,18421473,Mimi,Very accurate description - it was cozy and perfect for what my boyfriend and I needed.  Great location - 20 minute walk from downtown.  Delicious restaurant and bars nearby.  Karen and her friends were very helpful and responsive.  Will totally stay again and recommend!
4766173,35380366,2015-06-18,31625770,Bowe,"Karen was a fabulous host. She was very accommodating to our requests to check in early and was flexible about departure. Her communication was top notch. The studio was welcoming and met all our needs. The location could not be beat and allowed us easy access to all our sightseeing and nightlife activities.  I would recommend this in a heartbeat to any single or couple looking for a small, homey launching pad for a few nights in the city."
4766173,36666739,2015-06-30,31205913,Karen,"Great location, restaurants, coffee shops and grocery store nearby.  Centrally located for either a 20 minute stroll to downtown or cross the street to the bus stop.  The only negative point was the lack of storage space, all closets and draws were full."
4766173,38651316,2015-07-17,30932239,Khalid,Karen was a great host. She's very responsive to any inquiries about her apartment and was flexible with my check in time. The apartment is very comfortable and everything was as promised. 
4766173,42259244,2015-08-12,32985543,Dylan,"The listing was accurate and the place was great. Karen left us some useful information on her page with nearby venues. She dropped off the keys and provided us with everything we needed in her apartment. One downside—no air conditioning (there is a ceiling fan but it’s very hot in the summer). Also no TV but that didn’t bother us at all, as we were there to explore the city. Other than that, it was a great place to spend a couple of nights in the city. The neighborhood was fun although we ventured elsewhere (Space Needle, Pike Market) so we didn’t spend a lot of time nearby. Overall, I would recommend Karen's apartment. "
4766173,44335929,2015-08-25,1340019,Junichi,"We had a wonderful time at Karen's apartment. It was so much more than described! It's very clean, bright, and easy to access. The location couldn't be better. It's so easy to get to everywhere in Seattle area. It's surrounded by great restaurants, bars, and shops. And the view from her windows are magnificent. Karen was very attentive. She was also responsive to our very insignificant questions and helped us feel at home from the moment we arrived. 
Thank you Karen and hope we get to stay there again soon!"
4766173,45938227,2015-09-07,359515,Sheila,Karen was great about communicating all the details I needed.  She was extremely fast in getting back to me regrading questions.  The place she has is as described.  The location is perfect and the size is great.  We were able to have our son and his girlfriend over each evening  for visiting.  The view of the Space Needle is perfect and the garden outside is beautiful.  We stayed three nights and felt very comfortable.
2760901,12795785,2014-05-11,5926177,Jessica,"I had the most wonderful time at Frances' cottage in Seattle! Frances was very helpful in pointing us toward some nice places in the neighborhood (also providing us with a fantastic list of local bakeries to check out), and she always got back to me in a timely manner regarding details about our stay. The place itself is a haven; piano, records, beautiful art, an exhaustive library and plenty of space for two people. I wish I could have stayed longer just to drink more tea and read in the morning sunlight. The location is fantastic; very walkable to the Pike/Pine area and easy access to Downtown by car. Honestly, I can't wait to visit Seattle again so I can stay at this little cottage again. Thanks, Frances!"
2760901,13421954,2014-05-27,14320538,Melanie,"My boyfriend and I just returned from a trip to Seattle and we were very fortunate to have had such an amazing trip, but to also stay at Frances' AMAZING cottage.  I can't emphasize AMAZING enough, absolutely loved her place! So charming, quiet, homey, relaxing and uniquely decorated.  We adored the little couch by the large window in the living room and spent a lot of time relaxing on it and looking out at the green trees and plants. I also loved the bathtub, so cute. The cottage was clean and we had everything we needed, blankets, towels, soap, etc. We did not cook while we were there but there were plenty of kitchen utensils if we needed them. GREAT location, we walked everywhere, close to restaurants, bars, downtown. I really can't wait to visit Seattle again and would love to stay at Frances' cottage."
2760901,14433680,2014-06-19,11822105,Danita,"Frances was a wonderful host! Her home has an eclectic flow and the garden was a joy to see from either of the 2 decks. The highlight of staying at the cottage was watching the hummingbirds. This was our first trip to Seattle. When we come again, Frances will be our first choice :)"
2760901,15395126,2014-07-08,3294250,Sara,"What a lovely cottage indeed! We had a wonderful experience staying at Frances' place when we were in Seattle for a wedding over the July 4th weekend. Not only did Frances make us feel very welcome, but her little home was perfectly equipped with everything that we could have needed for our short stay. Being vinyl collectors ourselves, it was also an immense joy to find a few Talking Heads records in her collection to play while we prepared ourselves for the weekend's activities. The location is near perfect for a Capitol Hill-centred Seattle visit, being in walking proximity to great coffee shops, restaurants, and independent shops. (The Ethiopian Restaurant around the corner is amazing!) Even trips to the organic food market or Trader Joe's are just a short walkaway!  I can't express how wonderful this spot is.  I will absolutely stay here again if the opportunity arises.  "
2760901,16202977,2014-07-23,14993181,Hilary,Frances made this whole experience very easy and enjoyable. Her home is an amazing quaint little home that is a perfect retreat. I would recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle.
2760901,17555041,2014-08-14,9859569,Trajan,"Frances and her home were wonderful. When we flew into Seattle she was packing up for a camping trip and offered to pick us up partway into town to save us having to lug our bags through the streets and public transportation. Top tier host.

Her place was extremely clean, provided everything that could be reasonably expected, and while on a lot behind another home, felt very private. Very short walking distance to buses that can take you to the U-District, Downtown, or Capital Hill with many nice parks and places to eat nearby.Next time I'm in Seattle I would definitely try and book with her first. 

"
2760901,18528537,2014-08-28,11616196,Leticia,"Frances was a great host. Her house is a very nice place, very private, and close to many restaurants and Bus route around the corner. Would definitely stay here again!"
2760901,18711843,2014-08-31,2458995,Kate,"Frances's cottage is beautiful, inviting, comfortable, and well located. Though Frances was away, she was a terrific, generous, gracious host from afar, extremely thoughtful in checking in and making sure i had everything i might need. The cottage has a wonderful porch, amazing library, very comfortable bed, great bath, excellent and fully equipped kitchen, and is full of color and texture and inspiration. A great escape. Easy to get to and from airport via bus + light rail as well as to all over the city. Walk to tons of shops, markets (including co-op and trader joe's, bookstores, and bars, and 20-30 min walk to the center of the city. I would absolutely stay here again - for as long as possible! thank you frances!"
2760901,19725403,2014-09-17,17428656,Kolt,Frances's cottage is gorgeous. I had a superb weeklong stay. 
2760901,20145674,2014-09-24,9148397,Johanna,"We felt welcome and at home from the first second. A wonderful place, clean, cozy (as pictured) and in a great neighborhood. Everything we needed was on hand. Warmly recommended!"
2760901,20841914,2014-10-06,4888470,Michael,Great experience! Very warm welcome and an incredibly cozy space. Felt like a home away from home.
2760901,23169362,2014-11-24,23218213,Jamie,"Frances' cottage was my first experience with AIRbnb, and I can't say enough to fully explain how awesome this service is. My girlfriend and I wanted to get away for a week in Seattle. We searched around to see our options and Frances' place was exactly what we needed. Super cozy, great location, all the amenities to make for a good time : (record player and records [[[[awesome selections too]]]], all the books one could imagine to expand you fiction or spiritual knowledge. I only have one complaint: we wanted to hang out with Frances after she left us to her place! She was super warm and inviting, and from the small conversation we had and looking at all of her knick knacks, books, and records.... super cool lady! If we're back in Seattle to visit, we are definitely going to try her place again."
2760901,40997855,2015-08-03,29702757,Brian,"Frances has a charming, warm home that is in a great location!  Had a wonderful time in this safe and cozy spot."
2760901,43402880,2015-08-19,14494618,Petra,"A lovely little cottage where we felt very welcome and 'at home'. Everything was very clean and well equipped. A busstop just around the corner gave easy access to the downtown area. The area itself was quiet at night yet just about 10 blocks to the central area of Capitol hill - sometimes rather steep up and down ;-)).

Frances was always quick to repond to questions or other communication. When we met her upon arrival she gave us a tour of the place and explained things very well.

For us this was the 1st time in an Airbnb address which is actually a permanent residence and we enjoyed it very much. Almost as if visiting a friend's house, especially as this place felt very cozy."
2760901,44011315,2015-08-23,14445398,Ashley,"My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of staying in this cottage for a few days, and I am so glad we did!! The cottage was beautiful, and in a perfect location in Capitol Hill. Easy walk to restaurants and bars, and a wonderful home to stay in and relax. Thanks again Frances for letting us stay!"
2760901,46602759,2015-09-12,13458914,Nicky,"Like others, this was our first airbnb experience and it was so amazing. Frances was so helpful and wrote all important information down and gave us a quick tour. Her place is awesome and in a central location to everything. Every corner of her house has something interesting to look at and is immaculate. It was really warm and welcoming and cozy and smelled so good. Walking distance to cool little places and also close to public transportation. Such an amazing time !! Thank you Frances!!"
9419,71022,2010-07-30,166478,Beth,"If you love art, animals, and yoga, this is the place for you. My niece was visiting me in Portland from Springfield MO and had never been to Seattle before. I found this site by accident while looking for a place to stay. 
Angielena Chamberlain is a very cool and talented hostess. We shared her wonderful art studio with her, 4 rescue cats, and an adorable Jack Russell Terrier. The room was small and quaint with a comfortable feather bed. There were towels and fluffy bathrobes laid out for us to use. 
For those of you who like something artsy and not overrun with tourist, you will love the Georgetown area. 
And...if you want to go downtown, the 106 bus will get you straight to all the downtown Seattle usuals such as Pike's Market. The 106 will also get you straight to and from the Amtrak station. When we arrived late at night, it was so great that the bus went from the Amtrak station to just 2 doors down to Angielena's door! No car needed!
If you don't mind sharing a little space, this is a great place to stay with an amazing hostess. I highly recommend this and hope to stay again on my next trip to the area!
"
9419,83099,2010-08-23,165949,Erica,"I only overnighted here but I loved the offbeat location and the historic, industrial styled architecture in the vicinity. Angielina was a warm friendly host, who provided fresh towels and a robe, a soft feather bed, delicious huevos rancheros for breakfast and great company and environment from which to experience Seattle. I wish I had stayed longer as it was super convenient for accessing downtown and the historic King Street Amtrak station."
9419,87533,2010-08-30,210970,Geetika,"I stayed with Angielena for two nights and it was a really comfortable stay. The room is a good size and clean. Her studio is quite an interesting place in itself, and so is the neighborhood. It's extremely convenient to get to downtown and beyond as it's directly on the route of bus 106 and takes about 10 min (only $2!) to get there. Getting further to Fremont area or Airport was also very easy. If you are concerned about the animals, they are very very quiet, affectionate and non-intrusive - so don't let that stop you. Angielena was kind and helpful - she helped me find her place/got a ride because I was a bit lost in the area when I first got there and also gave me tips on places to check out. A very good experience - just one star short, coz I missed having a mirror in the room. But that's just me - I was on a short vacation, and I wanted to look nice in my photos for facebook and kept running to her other mirror :) This was not an inconvenience in any way though - just in case you wonder why I said nice things and gave one star less! =)
For the price and proximity to all the must-see sights in Seattle without being in the thick of mad downtown rush, this was GREAT!"
9419,91596,2010-09-06,219991,Andrew,She's amazing and so is the neighborhood and community.
9419,130632,2010-10-31,257657,Bru,"I only got to stay a day with Angielena but she made me feel right at home. Although her studio was above the Jules Maes Saloon, I slept comfortably—it wasn't noisy at all, and loved waking up to the historic view of Georgetown's brew house and Seattle sky. Angielena was kind enough to drop me off at the Earthwise salvage shop —there are so many antique and vintage shops in this area! And how could I forget having a delicious, hearty and healthy breakfast with her at Hanger Cafe. It was also relaxing to just spend the night in her artist studio, but alas I had to get on with my travels. 

If you see a small cow waddle by don't worry, that's just Murmur, her black and white cat :) She doesn't allow her squeezable pets in the guest room to keep it allergen-free."
9419,149669,2010-12-06,294275,James,Cool and funky place in a cool and funky part of Seattle. Very good bus service downtown and pretty easy connections to the airport. Angielena is a welcoming host. Only downside is that the building is on a main road and near the tracks so it can be a bit noisy at times.
9419,170115,2011-01-13,326849,Jihye,"It was my first time to use this website and I felt nervouse because I had never used this kind of website for accomodation.
However, I realized there was nothing to worry about after I stayed at Angielena's house. She's a super cool host! I was really confortable. 
Also, public transportation is very close to get to both downtown and  airport. I really like to recommend her house for your perfect trip! :)"
9419,175895,2011-01-29,344779,Daniel,"Angielena is amazing. She made me feel at home. If you like to meet people and make friends, there is the right place."
9419,181300,2011-02-12,378714,James,"A real inner city art space accompanied by normal inner city hum and noises. Georgetown has an emerging art scene with a small number of interesting bars, cafes and restaurants scattered amongst industrial looking buildings.I didn't need public transport as I had a car. Its halfway between the airport and the CBD so about 15 minutes from the airport and about the same to the CBD (except in rush hour). The room is next to the kitchen. No TV (good), pets so keep your door closed. Angielena is a lovely host. She is well known in the area and if art is your thing you are in the right place."
9419,193754,2011-03-07,249052,Jami,"Angielena was the best host I could have asked for! We didn't get a chance to really hang out but we did cross paths during my trip many times and I couldn't have better things to say. The room was comfy and private, the cats were sassy and aloof and the pup was just adorable! I can't wait to go back to Seattle, I already know where I will stay. "
9419,290670,2011-05-31,558296,Geraldine,"Had a great time staying with Angeleina - she really made me feel at home. The apartment was very spacious and the bedroom really comfortable. Her dog and cats are gorgeous. Very easy to get into downtown and also to and from the airport. The 106 from outside the front door leaves you at Rainer Beach stop for the rail link for SeaTac (15 minutes from Angeleina's to Rainer Beach) , and then two stops on the rail link to the airport. Very convenient!"
9419,316329,2011-06-15,606214,Callie,"Angielena went out of her way to accomodate my odd schedule.  (day sleeper) And I liked her art, and I liked the fact that MY room was simple and uncluttered, the how-to use the space and any quirks* were explained clearly.  I'm a fan of charming (quirky) historic buildings.

*You have to step down a step to the bathroon. She left the light on so that I could handle this safely.

I plan to be back with a friend so that we can fool around together in Georgetown."
9419,321077,2011-06-18,672562,Jyonghwa,"angielena was very kind and sweet. the studio is cool and located conveniently. love the arty atmosphere of Georgetown too. the room was clean and comfortable, but it was a little noisy with traffic outside and people from the bar downstairs. it was a great stay nonetheless."
9419,327302,2011-06-21,681054,Bruce,"To all Seatlle bound travelers!  Plan a stay at Bella Vitale Studio as you won't be disappointed.  In fact, your expectations will certainly be exceeded by your lovely and gracious host, Angielena.  Spending time in her studio is like sneaking into a Smithsonian; a rare, rewarding privilege.  So 5 stars for Bella Vitale Studio."
9419,331711,2011-06-24,628152,Peter & Gail,"Angielena is such a lovely person and a super host.  Her house is so handy to quick public transport to downtown Seattle that we recommend it, dispite a little roadnoise. We will book in again whenever we visit Seattle."
9419,343933,2011-06-30,540073,Wen-Chien,"Angielena's house is well located, you can experience hip and art in George Town and the transprotation is good, no matter to go to downtown seattle or airport. Angielena is a nice person and i really appreciate her paints. The room is simple but enough. I also had great time in seattle."
9419,357374,2011-07-06,694185,Christopher,"Super comfortable and centrally located. 

Walk out the door hop the bus and you are wherever you'd like to be in the city.

This was exactly the kind of place I was looking for. From the minute I walked in I felt that I had a home to stay in while I was in Seattle. Add in 3 wonderful kitties and possibly the wiggliest Jack Russell I've ever met and you talking about staying in the perfect spot.

Angielena's space was everything I could ask for. This place is even better if you're a vegetarian like myself as there are two quite tasty spots to eat within a five minute walk of the house.

"
9419,392476,2011-07-24,586640,Kenny,"Honestly I did not spend enough time to get to know her as a person because we both busy. However as artist I understand how it is (Because she is a professional artist and she had a lot of great art creations.) As a host, she is the best because 1) she cleaned the room before I got here which is nice; 2) she left me a glass for brushing my teeth. She is so nice and so thoughtful as a host. I will definitely recommend her to everyone."
9419,402751,2011-07-28,711450,Aimee,"Wow!  For a first time Airbnb experience, I can't say enough about Angielena and the Bella Vitale Studio.  

About Angielena: She's a gorgeous painter, and she's made the space into something special.  She's also incredibly helpful, and so fun to talk to (wish we could've chatted more, but I was out sightseeing, mostly).  She's laid out transportation and sightseeing guides in the guestroom, and a fluffy white robe and a basket of toiletries (She also has an impressive teadrawer:).  Her little dog Savie is a darling, and the cats are as lively as houseplants.  

About staying in Georgetown: I'd never been to Seattle before, and was worried about proximity to ""important things"".  There is a bus stop literally across the street that gets you where you want to be in 20 minutes.  And along the route is the Goodwill OUTLET store.  Not to be missed.  Goods by the pound.  Never would have seen it unless I was staying in Georgetown.  Between SEATAC and downtown, Georgetown is adorable AND industrial.  Like, they sell plane propellers down the street, but they also sell gourmet veggie reubens, microbrews, and espressos. There is a motorcycle club, but there's also Fantagraphics, the comics publisher.  Geeks and foodies and artists align.  

The Bella Vitale Studio is above an actual SALOON.  Hilarious.  But NOT AT ALL noisy.  There's lots of insulation, I guess, because in three nights I never heard a peep.  On my next visit, I'm going to forgo the typical Seattle sites, and spend more time in Georgetown.  There's plenty to see and do and eat there.   

I will TOTALLY be back.  "
9419,406212,2011-07-30,665103,Reshma,"I booked the stay for my parents who are in the mid sixties and were spending a couple of days in Seattle before departing on an Alaskan cruise.  Angielena was amazing!  She went out of her way to make them feel welcome, carried their luggage upstairs (as my dad has a bad back), came back home early from her class to assist them when they were departing and was very warm and charming according to my mother.  Her place was very clean and well kept and my parents thoroughly enjoyed their stay as well as loved getting to know her.  I would definitely recommend her as a host and the excellent location of her studio"
9419,419305,2011-08-04,399158,Varun,"This was a hard review to write, because this spans both ends of the spectrum. I've done a fair amount of Airbnb, and almost always have extended my stay wherever I have lived, but this was different. I left the first chance I got (which was rather soon, a couple of hours). 

First, let me begin with the good by saying that whatever little time I spent with Angielena, and the pre-arrival exchanges, she was very nice, gracious, and seemed like a very cool person I could have really gotten along with. She maintains a nice, clean, artsy place. 

Now let's talk about the place, and the rental / value aspect of the whole package. The neighborhood is a bit run down; there are demolitions and teardowns happening literally right across the street, it is noisy in the daytime as it is also right under the landing path of the airport, and I saw a fair few unsavory characters at the intersection near the place, so I'd be worried about going out in the night. 

Inside, the bathroom too is rather tiny, and quite a bit across the hall to make it inconvenient. Also, the listing says the room is 250 Sq Ft, which would be a decent size room, but in reality the room is rather tiny. Maybe a bit more than 9 feet by 12/13 feet, with an angled wall at one end. Even the tiny closet was almost full..  In a city where a 3 star hotel room with breakfast can be had for as few as US$100/day, this doesn't really offer great value, or great convenience, considering it is in a rather inconvenient part of town. "
9419,436446,2011-08-11,745563,Julia,"This was me and my boyfriend's first experience using airbnb and it far exceeded expectations. We needed a homebase while we did some apartment searching in Seattle. I did my research beforehand and saw good reviews for Angielena. Every one was correct. 
First, there was unexpected loud construction outside of the apartment in the morning and she called the construction company to see if they would either postpone some of the construction or pay for a hotel room for us. Also, we arrived later than expected but she still moved her schedule around so that she could be at the apartment when we arrived. 
She was friendly and warm without being intrusive or over-talkative. It was very much like staying at a friend's place. 
Also, the shower head is one of those wide rainfall types. It's amazing. 
I can't recommend her enough! "
9419,453475,2011-08-17,847473,Suzanne,"If you love old industrial brick buildings, art studios and want to know where the locals hang out you will love this location and Georgetown.  Spacious accommodations, super friendly hostess and the bus stop couldn't be more convenient - literally right outside the front door.  I felt very safe, my car was safe and parking was free ( big seller for me).  I was in town for business so the noise from the busy street and airport was a bummer but I travel with earplugs and they came in handy.  I plan on staying with Angielena again and have already recommended her to friends."
9419,476141,2011-08-26,684425,Mary,"I actually stayed twice with Angielena, with a one-day break in between, and I have to say she was totally cool about letting me break up the stay even though it may have been a little awkward for her."
9419,491201,2011-08-31,684425,Mary,"Angielena is the most charming hostess you can imagine. If you like artists, you will enjoy staying here because Angielena's home is also her studio. She has three adorable cats and a sweet dog, and they are kind spirits in the place without being forward with their presence. Note that Georgetown is a true artists' community and therefore on the cutting edge. If you want to stay in a well-touristed area, you would be better off downtown. Georgetown has a certain grittiness and can seem deserted if you come in after 12 a.m. or so on a week night. If you have a sense of adventure, however, and want to stay in a non-touristy area, Bella Vitale is a good choice. Angielena is very personable and generous with information about Seattle and a lot of fun to talk to. Another bonus is that it is very easy to get to Bella Vitale from the airport but also easy to get downtown from Georgetown on the bus.

Some other folks on here talked about noise. I am not an especially sound sleeper, but with the fan on and the window closed, I slept fine. I always think ear plugs are a useful travel accessory, so if you bring some of these along, you should be good to go."
9419,503438,2011-09-05,995190,Gaurav,The apartment is very conveniently located with respect to transportation.
9419,523081,2011-09-12,462391,Tim,"A very, very comfortable bed!   Nice atmosphere and a generous and helpful host."
9419,563303,2011-09-24,1144059,Court,"This was the perfect experience for my first use of airbnb, Angielena was an incredible host. I was able to park my car in a nice safe place, felt right at home, and after a long day at school orientation came home to rad music to study (or take a nap). What a wonderful week!"
9419,599739,2011-10-04,684928,Seth,"A wonderful place to stay. A nice small sunny room in a large beautiful space. Angielena is a fantastic host. Highly recommend staying here if you are cool with the neighborhood (industrial, somewhat sparse, but only a short bus ride from downtown). I loved the neighborhood, the host, the space, everything. Stay here!"
9419,633908,2011-10-16,146762,Sarah,"I've stayed twice now. The room is small (but enough room for a small desk and to change and for your suitcase and everything). Bed has a very soft comforter and great pillows. I love walking into the house and up the stairs. It just makes me happy to see all the color and art on the walls. Her cats and dogs are sweet and Angielena is really welcoming. I also really love the neighborhood. You are next door to some great bars, restaurants, artsy shops, and coffee shops."
9419,695707,2011-11-06,1005393,Dorte,"If you stay with Angielena, you get to experience the great neighborhood of Georgetown! Access to Downtown Seattle is very easy. The bus stops right outside the door, and it's a mere 15-20 minutes ride. Georgetown is close to the Boeing Field, and your room is above a bar, but it's part of the charm! I never had trouble sleeping - but just something to know in case you're a very light sleeper.
I wouldn't hesitate to stay here if I make it back to Seattle :)"
9419,704775,2011-11-08,1256486,Karl,"""Angielena the adorable"" was an amazing host. I received a warm and welcome reception that I will long remember. I found her to be very caring, considerate, and comfortable, enjoying her company and conversation. Angielena's accommodating abode is also her personal art studio and gallery. This unpretentious place of historical significance is the perfect place for any student or admirer of the arts. Her interest and willingness to help others experience Seattle's industrial art scene exceeded my expectations. As the impressive founder of Georgetown Arts & Cultural Center, Angielena proved to be perfect host of home as well as city concierge. I very much look forward to visiting again. "
9419,808870,2011-12-27,1258924,Dana,"Angielena is very friendly and knowledgable of the city of Seattle. If you are looking to stay close to the heart of everything then you may want to choose elsewhere but her house is right outside a bus stop and the bus ride only takes about 20 minutes right into the heart of downtown. I recommend earplugs if you are a light sleeper - there is a lot of air/road traffic noise. But overall, a great airbnb option and you get the opportunity to meet her very cute dog and cats!"
9419,911325,2012-02-09,1539211,Andrew,"Angielena is well cultured, intelligent & a blast to have stayed with. Very knowledgeable, helpful and cordial. The place is depicted accurately in her listing and is very pleasant! If you like art & New York-Esque loft styling you'll enjoy this place immensely! I would ABSOLUTELY stay with Angielena again. "
9419,977286,2012-03-06,1822846,Torsten,I like to stay in local places with local folks.  Angielena was amazing in her response to my request and her hospitality.  Within 48 hours booking I had all the information necessary.  She was very flexible in regards to the check in process.  Wonderful location.
9419,1043387,2012-03-26,1722859,Jesse,"The space is noisy and never truly dark, but that is part of being in a city and, with how busy we kept ourselves, it wasn't too much for us to sleep. Angielena is a charming and generous hostess, and her dogs are sweet, if a bit yippy. A cozy, stylish space and a comfy bed, what more could you really ask for?"
9419,1099920,2012-04-08,2021170,John,"Staying with Angielena is like being hosted by a cool friend of a friend -- the ambience is relaxed and it's easy to feel at home. The room is in an art-filled loft space in a culturally happening neighborhood. The house dogs and cats have lots of personality without being annoying. Pretty much everything was good except that the bed's mattress was squeaky and sagged in the middle, but Angielena mentioned it's slated to be replaced after my stay so it shouldn't be an issue in future. There's easy bus access to downtown Seattle right outside the door. Angielena is a gracious host, flexible and easy to communicate with. Overall, a great place to stay.
"
9419,1212821,2012-05-01,2195802,Justin,We had a great time w/Angelina. Fun location!
9419,1366841,2012-05-28,2383687,Harsh,"Angielena was my first hostess through airbnb.  She hosted me for a week, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying in a great little neighborhood I stayed here as my first stop after moving to Seattle for work. Angielena is very helpful, accommodating and such a sweet person. She is a new friend I have made in this new city. The house pets are very lovable, friendly and easy to fall in love with. You sure will miss them when you leave.
There are plenty of local restaurants and stops worth enjoying. The bus stop is right across the street and the bus takes you to downtown in 20 min and if you plan on frequent trips I would recommend getting the ORCA card from one of the machines on any of the Link stations. "
9419,1424473,2012-06-05,2412668,Laura,The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
9419,1530509,2012-06-21,2500740,Anne,"We had a wonderful stay in Angielena's new airbnb adventure!  She is a fantastic host--gracious and full of recommendations for meals, sites, neighborhood adventures, and in house yoga classes. The building as a whole is in a remodel phase (which was  not at all a detractor), but our room and bathroom were absolutely perfect.  The neighborhood is great--it has a well developed sense of community, a good mix of shops, a couple galleries, a delicious diner on the corner, a great bar just up the block, and a handful of other tasty looking restaurants scattered around.  

We would both be happy to be her guests again on our next trip to Seattle. "
9419,1624045,2012-07-03,2473254,George,"Angielena was a fabulous host! She helped point the way towards fun things to do in the Georgetown neighborhood and left little pastries outside my door. How can you not love that? The place is also in a renovated, 1904 hotel across from the old Rainier brewing factory and had tons of character.

I would highly recommend and happily stay there again!"
9419,1877776,2012-08-03,2905611,Maddie,"I am so glad that I planned my stay with Angielena. Not only was the room comfortable and charming, but it was also in a great location. Angielena was very helpful with directions and information about the city. I highly recommend staying here! "
9419,2052544,2012-08-21,2530960,Chae,"It was great to stay amongst an artist community since I was in Seattle to take art classes. Georgetown is funky with lots of bars, restaurants and a great little cafe with decent coffee. The room was comfortable, clean and the bathroom is what made my stay 5star. A must experience... "
9419,2162342,2012-09-01,1015491,Janine,"Angielena was a friendly and fun hostess who we bribed with dairy free chocolate : )
She has very thoughtful in her suggestions for local things to check out. She also checked in on us to see if we needed anything. Angielena took the time to get to know my partner and I and is a very genuine person. 
The accommodations were going through a renovation when we stayed. Angielena was really helpful with laundry, making up for the in-progress nature of the Center. If returning to this section of Seattle, we'd definitely consider staying at the Center again. "
9419,2206992,2012-09-05,3067700,Cam,"Angelina was an excellent host, our room was beautiful with tons of character, Georgetown is a REAL neighbourhood with a vibe all its own and I would recommend anyone travelling to Seattle stay with Angelina!!! Plus her dog is adorable and the restaurant down the street has the best grilled-cheese I've ever had!"
9419,13171053,2014-05-20,9977228,Sam,"She was great. From the moment we first connected she was present and on board. She was excited about our stay in the Golden Sun vintage room because she had just completed the creation of the room, I think. 
FYI: this is a great room in a great bldg in very cool bohemian south Seattle area of Georgetown, (by Boeing Field).
Good: artsy, down to earth, clean, SHOWER from the Gods, close to great restaurants, easy on/easy off for Freeway and bus.
Caveat:
bathroom and kitchen down hall. Being a first timer, I guess I really didn't check it out as well as I should have to know that.
Occasionally a little noisy with motorcycles but this is a very random occurrence. 
Essentially, its super cool if your ok with wifi but no tv, and the down hall shared kitchen, bathroom thing. 
We were there in May and if windows were open = nice air. 
Bed is comfortable and little hang out area in other room is nice and free parking is very convenient. 
If 2 people be cozy because its a full size bed (not queen)

Last thought-
great place. No deal breakers here at all if your a down to earth person and you sleep easy. Very laid back.
This was a very good fit..."
9419,13554620,2014-05-30,15942475,Chris,"I had a amazing time staying in this room! The accommodations were perfect for me, full access to the kitchen, and a million dollar bathroom! I was surrounded by some amazing food as well. Angielena was an amazing hostess, her suggestions for places to visit were spot on. La Catrina is a must, the bar downstairs, and the authentic Italian pizza place around the corner. I didn't get to explore as much as I wanted because I was up for a class, but I'm excited to come back again, and will definitely be staying in Georgetown! :) "
9419,15355937,2014-07-07,16925288,Sean,The stay in Georgetown was cool.  One of the more highly rated breweries in seattle is right down the road.  Its only a few minutes to downtown.  Angelina was very nice she told us all about what was around and was very accomodating.  Some loud motorcycles across the street would be my only complaint.   I was there for only a couple days and cant wait to see Seattle again.   I was happy with where we were as it seemed to be a better neighborhood than  downtown.
9419,15717821,2014-07-14,961747,Sheng-Jun,"Angielena was a helpful host. The room does get a bit hot without AC in the middle of the summer and the traffic noise can be loud at night, but overall an enjoyable stay."
9419,16109927,2014-07-22,15689338,Callie,We really enjoyed our stay in Seattle. The area is very interesting and artsy which we both appreciated and the room was cute. We felt that we were able to get around by bus fairly easily and there was also some cute places to eat around the neighborhood. The Mexican place down the street is amazing and has a really great friendly staff. Angielena was helpful and was quick to respond via text if we needed something.  The building itself is very unique and I enjoyed the old-fashioned vibe. We also met a few artists who were very nice. I would definitely recommend. The bed is a bit small for two but we slept well enough.
9419,16267445,2014-07-24,601994,Kathy,"Angielena was a warm and professional host. After we mentioned the possibility of a trip to Mt. Rainier, we later found a guide book waiting outside our door! We got to meet a number of other artists and travelers in the building, all of whom were quiet and respectful during our stay. The neighborhood is fun and inviting. Downtown is a safe and convenient bus ride away. Be advised, late night buses to Georgetown might attract some shady passengers. The room was clean and comfortable. However, sleeping with the windows open did prove problematic at times -- the building is close to both an air field and a freight rail yard. All in all, a cute room with a great host!"
9419,16812554,2014-08-02,19100252,Steven,"We had such a great experience at the Golden Sun vintage room. Angielena was such a gracious host, giving excellent recommendations of where to go, restaurants to try, etc. She was also very welcoming and accommodating to our check in/check out times needed. Overall just a lovely person! The new bathroom was beautiful and the air conditioning unit in the room is great. As long as the windows are closed the airplane noise is really no issue. Georgetown is such a cool area, we were so happy we stayed there and were forced to check out other neighborhoods besides just Downtown. Highly recommend Hangar Cafe for breakfast!"
9419,17018330,2014-08-05,18865341,Kate,"Angielena was an excellent host. The welcome tour gave us an thorough and hilarious lay of the land that was to be our home for four days. All basic amenities were supplied, including the use of a full kitchen (fridge, toaster oven, microwave and a few dishes were provided in the room for easy access), and accommodations were quite comfy. Being that the room is located in Georgetown, we were easily able to escape the busy downtown scene at anytime with the use of the transit system and escape back to our comfy little corner of town. All in all, it was just what we needed, it was the perfect little get away."
9419,17659999,2014-08-15,3248743,Michelle,"I had a change of plans and Angielena was very flexible and understanding. She's a great host and has tried to think of a lot of the details to make you feel welcomed in the space. Room was clean, building was unique & interesting, & the residential artists and other guests were quiet. I think there's probably street traffic noise in the morning (it was a weekday), but I sleep with earplugs so no problem for me. I also liked the neighborhood--northeastern, industrial, arts feel to it. "
9419,18220816,2014-08-23,6707324,Claire,"Angielena was warm and welcoming and the room was perfect! I was in town exploring different neighborhoods and I wanted to try out Georgetown. It had great bars/breweries for drinking, and coffee shops for writing. It's not too far from the airport, so you get a lot of airplanes overhead, but I liked being able to see the planes up close. The bathroom was amazing and the bed comfy. It was really cool to be staying somewhere with a kickass artistic community and mission. Would love to stay here again. "
9419,18445029,2014-08-26,19115960,Jessica,"I couldn't have been happier here! The building is full of 1920s charm - flapper dresses hang from some of the doors, there's art everywhere, gorgeous plants, (some of the units here are actually art studios), beautiful hardwood floors, crown molding, long drapey curtains, etc. 

LOVED the neighborhood - hip industrial style bars, cute restaurants converted from old houses, and right outside our window was a flea market housed by trailers. So cute.

Angeleina was great - she spent over an hour with us showing us where everything was - kitchen, bathroom (how to use the shower - by the way - amazing - multiple shower heads that will spray you from every angle), gave us neighborhood tips, etc. 

If I ever come back to Seattle, this will be my first choice for sure."
9419,18757128,2014-08-31,20143065,Christine,"Angielena is a wonderful host! She gave me an enthusiastic tour of their lovely historic building & amenities & is definitely passionate about what she does there and enjoys sharing the neighborhood. Helpful, cheerful, just the best. The room was as described (and cuter!) with plenty of room to kick back & relax in the sitting room after a long day. The bed was comfy ( I slept really soundly) & that shower! You simply must see it for yourself. The other residents & guests I met were exceedingly polite & welcoming. I love the care taken with restoring this building & enjoyed being surrounded by the artistic atmosphere. Georgetown is an amazing little eclectic neighborhood with superb food & drink choices. I wish I could have spent MORE time there. Nothing but positive things about to say about the whole experience. Thank you so much Angielena~! "
9419,18954897,2014-09-03,6270689,Milo,"Thank you Angielena for making our first AirBnB experience a pleasant one!  From the start, she was very accommodating and helpful with her suggestions.  The room was exactly what we were expecting and the rear balcony ""lounge"" area was perfect to unwind after a long day of exploring the city.  I definitely will recommend to friends.       "
9419,19239290,2014-09-08,10047158,Keith,"The location of Angielena’s place was good for our needs, although if you have a car, you can get around much easier, as Angielina’s place is a 20-minute bus ride to Seattle central.  Free off-street parking is available.  If you don’t have a car, you can access the bus right across the street in front of the building, which is nice.  During our 3-night stay, we greatly enjoyed Angielina’s warm hospitality.  She was personable, very helpful and attentive to our needs.  She recommended several local restaurants and events, like the St. Gennaro (Italian) festival on Saturday night.  The bed was comfortable and the room of adequate size.  Overall, we found the room and building pretty much “as advertised.”  The large bathroom was well stocked with all the essential personal care products.

We found several local restaurants to be excellent:  The downstairs pub, a superb Mexican place, and the Hangar Café (breakfast and lunch).  Also---there’s a good craft beer tap room just across the street.  We also liked that the Enterprise Rental Car location is 5 minutes away----and they will pick you up.  "
9419,20072394,2014-09-22,9339008,Esther,"Angielena was a lovely host! I was stuck in traffic with no cell phone reception, and 2 hrs late for my check in, she graciously welcomed me and showed me around the art centre. It's in a great up-n-coming neighborhood especially if you're into one of a kind shops, it's a fun area with great food and loads of art. It was a fun experience overall!"
9419,23453701,2014-12-01,556693,Mike,"Great place, friendly folks living and making art in the old restored hotel. Craft beer and burgers downstairs. Great place to stay in the heart of Georgetown. "
9419,33533714,2015-05-29,17626331,Gianpaolo,"Staying @ Angielena's place was very comfortable, a good home base. Even on nights where the area was more lively, upstairs was peaceful.

The kitchen, bathrooms, porch provide all the amenities needed to be comfortable.

Angielena is a welcoming and respectful host as the other reviews indicate."
9419,36327555,2015-06-27,36002551,Dylan,"Angielena was an amazing host. She was always there if I needed something and also was extremely fun to talk to. 

The place in question was really awesome to stay in. You're in this little town with beautiful industrial buildings that has been turned into an artist town. Amazing food and amazing places to visit everywhere and just a bus ride away from the city. You have you're own room with a shared kitchen and bathroom. It's almost like staying in a private roomed hostel."
9419,36747958,2015-06-30,36867892,Robert,"Angelina was an absolute pleasure to deal with.  She was friendly and inviting right from the start.  If you are looking to stay at a place with charm and character, this is it.  The room was spacious and well located inside the Georgetown district Seattle.  "
9419,37347815,2015-07-06,32915986,Martha,"Angelina was a very kind and welcoming host, her facility is much to be proud of. "
9419,38127346,2015-07-13,1106187,David,"Angielena was a delightful and helpful host. She was kind enough to welcome practically my whole family--two parents (including myself) and a baby in the Golden Sun room, two grandparents in the Toulouse Lautrec room, and an uncle in the calm green room. The Golden Sun room's side room was a nice place to gather, with two comfy chairs, a small fridge, and toaster oven. It was also easy to make some coffee in the communal kitchen. The shared bathroom never posed a problem; there is actually a second, smaller bathroom besides the Barry White bathroom, and at least one was always available. We stayed over the second weekend of a month, which means we got to enjoy the Georgetown Art Attack, a neighborhood gallery walk with a central corridor right around this AirBnB location, plus a couple of other locations (Equinox Studios and Studio E) reachable by the frequent shuttle service. Get started early on the Art Attack. There's lots to see. End your night right downstairs at the Trailer Park Mall, where, when we visited, a singer and guitarist were playing some gypsy/cabaret/jazz/bossa music. They stayed open later than the rest of the walk. The next day was also the Georgetown Garden Walk, where the neighbors and parks show off their gardens and backyards and produce. The host Angielena was working at the Urban Farm and Food Forest, a new enterprise on the southern edge of the walk. There's lots of good food, beer, bars, and coffee around. Some spots had irregular hours, but we were never left without options. There's also the Carleton Avenue Grocery (the oldest in the state, with friendly owners, and astrong wine selection, especially for a corner market) ~10 min walk away. If you're staying at the Georgetown Art Center, you're probably also interested in visiting downtown Seattle. Luckily, the bus stops right in front of this location, and can get you downtown in about ~15 minutes (though we found the wait on the return trips to be a little slow. Try to time the return). A smaller group could make good use of Uber. The only real drawback I'd point out is that there's a county airport just to the south (not SeaTac, King County). Most of the planes that fly over are small jets and little private planes, but there were a couple freight planes that were fairly jolting. This was most noticeable in the Golden Sun room; my parents in the Toulouse Lautrec room didn't notice it as much. So, yes, we had a terrific time staying here and exploring Georgetown. It's different from probably anywhere you've stayed. The doors that don't lead to AirBnB rooms lead to private art studios. There's a Trailer Park shopping mall, a bar, and a cafe downstairs. The only comparison I can make is to the famed McMenamins properties of Oregon and Washington, where they've taken historical buildings and turned them into lodging (and dining and drinking) establishments, like Edgefield. History buffs will love..."
9419,39933343,2015-07-27,7705305,Cathy,"Angielena greeted us and gave us a tour upon arrival.  It's a delightful historic building with high ceilings, wood floors in the bedrooms, vintage light fixtures, and tasteful decor.  The accommodations are pleasing without being fussy; simple but not austere.  The Golden Sun room has a mini fridge, toaster oven, and microwave.  Artwork is hung around each room and in the hallway - showcasing not only Angielena's beautiful work but some of the other artists as well.
There is a real sense of community here, whether you're staying one night or many.  Sharing kitchen space made it easy to connect with other guests and artists.  The back porch is lovely first thing in the morning with your tea or coffee; and later in the evening with a friend.  
A few items of note : the entrance into the hotel is a full flight of stairs and there is no elevator.  The view out my window wasn't the best (a restaurant supply company yard filled with used equipment), and the Georgetown neighborhood is quite close to the King County Airport.  Planes on approach are sometimes pretty low - which is why there is sometimes the ""Georgetown Pause"" in the middle of conversation while the planes fly in.  I didn't mind any of those things - but do be aware that this is not a quiet, pampering hotel.  Rather, staying here is a way to insert yourself right into the funky vibe of Georgetown!
Georgetown is a colorful, vibrant neighborhood that is still a little on the wild side.  If you like to listen to live music, enjoy good food, good drink, and shop for excellent artwork, you'll enjoy staying here.  It's close to the downtown area, just a short drive or bus ride away.  There is a wonderful chocolate maker right across the street (Fran's).  The Georgetown Trailer Park Mall is right out the back door on weekends (which is a sweet attraction in its own right) and the neighborhood has lots of fun shops and places of business.  The Museum of Flight is close by - and of course lots of other cool things to see. I really enjoyed the proximity to many attractions. 
 I stayed here with my teen, and didn't worry about my safety. We did a fair bit of walking in the area, as his summer camp was a few blocks away.  SANCA circus camp was fantastic, and being able to stay within walking distance was PERFECT!!
 Angielena is a wonderfully warm person and I am really grateful I had a chance to stay here.  I will be back - that's a certainty.  I've discovered a lovely host, made a new friend, and find that I love Georgetown and the people there.  The Golden Sun room was my home for two weeks, and I miss it already.  What a great experience!!"
9419,40274932,2015-07-29,183398,Anna,"Angielena as a host and the space (Golden Sun Vintage Room) were both great—as advertised and reviewed! Georgetown proved a most convenient locale for a quick zip thru Seattle: airport-proximate, bus line accessible, car-friendly and ultimately a warm, unique, affordable spot to stay. Angielena was a terrific host—responsive, thorough, accommodating...with a quick wit to match! Travel and enjoy!"
9419,40837586,2015-08-02,22457582,Modou,"Great host, fun and pleasant community, lots to see and enjoy in the vicinity. Loved my stay. A+."
9419,41818413,2015-08-09,38622750,Sandra,"Angielena was very welcoming and reassuring as this was my first time using Airbnb. My boyfriend and I stayed to job-hunt for a week and so having a nice, clean, and air-conditioned room helped us out a lot! The bed has been moved but the room includes a small kitchen and living area. The community kitchen is small but has everything you need if you will be cooking during your stay. Also, per Angielena's recommendation, there is a really sweet bar downstairs that has a great happy hour! 
Aside from the cleanliness of the room, I was most content with Angielena herself. She's such a great host and is very informative! Definitely give this place a thought if you are looking for an affordable, yet nearby, room in Seattle!"
9419,43129677,2015-08-17,40036978,Lindy,"Angelina was there to show me around.  Though there was a mix-up with my room she made sure I was taken care of until I could get into my room the next day.  

Thanks, Angelina"
9419,43771346,2015-08-22,2241325,Rinske,"Great shared art space in Georgetown. Angelina was very helpful and warm hearted, she showed me around the house, her own atelier and was happy to give some good recommendations for the area. The place has a super chique bathroom and a huge balkony for evening sun which directly looks upon the Georgetown art market. The neighborhood is fun to explore and buses to downtown leave from right across the street. Thank you Angelina!"

Angielena was incredibly friendly and straight forward about the process, even helped us by guiding us with transportation, will surely recommend and repeat stay!"
9419,45155678,2015-08-31,10874851,Giovanni,"The place is a boutique hotel in a very charming old building from 1904 in a vibrant art district near airport and near downtown.. Both 10 min by car... Room is simple, old furniture and floors , bathroom in the hallway ... You can hear any sound from hallway and rain make noise and a few planes go by ... Not ideal for a romantic trip but perfect as a stop by to stay in Seattle, free parking, amazing breakfast and restaurant a block away! A great spot   ! Never met angielena .. My schedule was tight ... "
9419,45958324,2015-09-07,5911774,Hoa,"This was a nice place to stay - it was conveniently walking distance to the wedding venue this past weekend. From when we arrived, we received a call from Angielena making sure we weren't lost and got into Seattle ok. When we arrived, we received a detailed tour of our where we are staying. The best part of this place was the bed. It was comfortable. The extra room was helpful where we could lay out our luggage - otherwise the bedroom area itself was just big enough for the two of us. Be aware that this place is in an older building and you will be sharing the shower/restroom area. We didn't mind too much, but it did feel like I was in a dorm room carrying my stuff back and forth to the bedroom and back. Otherwise, cute area and comfortable stay. Host was responsive and helpful. "
9419,46710938,2015-09-13,36879334,Judy,I enjoyed my stay at angielina's art studio historic hotel very much. I have Ben without Internet on the cruise. So my apologies for not responding sooner. Angelina was such a warm and attentive host. The room was very comfortable and quiet at night. The location in Georgetown is awesome and it is aneT area to explore!! Thanks for making my stay so nice!!! Judy
9419,48761344,2015-09-28,8542060,Chris,"What really makes the experience is Angielena - she's super accommodating, gives you a full tour of the place when you arrive, leaves clear instructions about the room and facility.  I'd highly recommend based on her alone!

The place is in an older, industrial part of town.  It looks like it's becoming a trendy place to live.  Easy food, drinks, and freeway access nearby.  

I'd stay here again."
9419,55896302,2015-12-07,9252239,Shandra,"I love Angielena's Airbnb in Georgetown! It was my 2nd stay, and this time I actually got to enjoy the area a little more. Angielena is a great host. If you want to immerse yourself in the arts in a cool little neighborhood, this is the spot. "
4340838,24693297,2015-01-01,25281391,Taylor,"I enjoyed my stay at the Greenlake studio. I appreciated the easy access to I-5 and downtown via Aurora Ave. The apartment was clean and the kitchen had everything I needed to cook!  Also, I didn't have any trouble finding a place to park! "
4340838,26070697,2015-02-02,21500976,Max,"Brian was an excellent host--he made sure that we had everything we needed and more. The space was wonderful--clean, bright, spacious, recently renovated (in a quiet neighborhood, close to coffee shops and restaurants). The mattress was so comfortable that my girlfriend and I decided to buy the same one (which of course Brian helped us find and purchase). We'll be recommending this place to anyone who comes to visit Seattle! "
4340838,26325100,2015-02-09,25279699,Cat,Brian and Kylie were very welcoming and helpful.  Their apartment was beautiful and cozy.  We enjoyed our stay in Seattle.        
4340838,26709070,2015-02-17,25868230,Peter,Great space. Great location. Brian and Kylie really go the extra mile to make their guests feel welcome.
4340838,27068537,2015-02-24,4024359,Sam,Great little place in greenlake/wallingford area. Close to the tangletown shops and within walking distance of the lake. Brian and Kylie were great hosts--they went out of there way to accommodate me and were nice all around. Highly recommend. 
4340838,27741502,2015-03-10,2866841,Dan,Great location and great hosts.  I would definitely stay here again.
4340838,30957443,2015-04-29,22026275,Eric,"I was in Seattle working while house hunting so I spent a fair amount of time in Brian and Kylie's studio during the day and it was perfect! 

From the moment I walked in: it was cold and raining outside, they had already turned a heater on with spa music playing on low! You don't get that kind of greeting at a hotel. Felt relaxed right away. 

The pictures, while accurate, make the place look smaller than it is. I was surprised how roomy it was. They are great hosts and very considerate, they asked me a few times about the noise as the studio is in a basement. I consider myself sensitive to noise but even when working without music, writing in absolute silence, at most I would hear a floorboard creak or a footfall hear and there. Quiet music - never heard anything. 

Neighborhood is very safe, great view of the mountains on the street, easy parking and from driving around all over Seattle looking at places - it's centrally located and easy to get anywhere you want to go. 

It is an apartment to yourself, so it had everything, and was well stocked. I didn't cook in but stove looked great and all the pots and pans were there, I was just on the go at nights, so didn't try it. 

It was a great experience, was very happy to find it, and I would stay with them again!"
4340838,31050493,2015-05-01,2762776,Jessica,"Brian was very friendly and responsive and provided all of the information that I needed. The apartment is very well laid out and neat and tidy. The location is fabulous - just a few blocks to the restaurants in Tangletown, and a few more blocks to Green Lake. All and all a great place to stay!"
4340838,34249191,2015-06-06,33867692,Susan,"The apartment was exactly as described. It was ready early and when I arrived, nice music was playing and the heat was set to the perfect temperature. Quiet neighborhood with street parking and close to I-5 and bus line. Brian and Kylie were very accommodating and quick to answer any questions. A great first airbnb experience for me. "
4340838,34846440,2015-06-13,27796485,Mona,"We have had a great time visiting seattle and staying with brian and kylie. They are both wonderful caring hosts, especially for our first time with airbnb. The Greenlake itself is worth a visit! 
It is easy to get into the city. There are two bus lines close by that ensure quick access to downtown and futher locations.
The appartement has everything one could ask for and made us feel like home.
Thank you for a great stay!"
4340838,35094814,2015-06-15,31945464,Tosha,"This was actually a better experience than I even expected.   The location was perfect for what I needed, parking easy, the BED is  supergood quality mattress so I slept like a baby, and the place was clean, neat and quiet.  In the morning, like right now, you can lay in bed and hear the birds chirping outside.   The hosts were great about taking care of any questions, and even loaned me a bicycle when I needed one.  I would definitely stay here again. "
4340838,43696490,2015-08-21,2410993,Olivia & Dakota,"Brian and Kylie were spectacular hosts! Upon arriving they had taken the time to suggest some places for us to visit based upon our specific interests. They offered great local tips and were super approachable. 

The studio itself was so cozy! It was clean, comfortable and in a great neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again in the future.

Thanks so much guys!"
4340838,43851473,2015-08-22,22334177,Collette & Richard,"We had a wonderful time staying at Brian and Kylie's Greenlake apartment. The suite was very clean and seemed quite well looked after - there were even maps of the area (with favourite spots circled!) and we arrived to a little hand written note.
Brian and Kylie were great with pre-communication and were available if we needed anything during our stay."
4340838,43969924,2015-08-23,38874692,Laura,"This was my husband and my first experience with Airbnb and Brian and Kylie made it a wonderful experience.  The apartment was exactly as listed and was very clean and comfortable with a very ""at home"" atmosphere.  They went out of their way to make our stay very enjoyable.  They took a few moments to introduce us to the area with very accurate reviews of the eateries in the area.  They also told us what other businesses were in the area.  We had the security that if we needed anything they were only a phone call away.  I think they went over and beyond their responsibilities and I would recommend this studio apartment to anyone going to that area.  
"
4340838,44895850,2015-08-30,33317504,Ellis,My husband and I had an amazing time at Brian and Kylie's house. The neighborhood was so beautiful and quiet and their studio apartment was even better than the pictures showed. We brought our eight month old son with us and there was plenty of room for the three of us. The studio had everything that we needed and was so close to it everywhere that we needed to go. Brian and Kylie even let us borrow some baby items for our son and were so great about recommending places to go and eat! We will recommend this place to everyone we know and we will stay here again when we come back!
4340838,45976711,2015-09-07,22723219,Alyssa,Very easy access into the apartment.  Was clean and had everything we needed!  Loved being near tangletown.  Great stay!
4340838,46126780,2015-09-08,8858697,Linda,Brian and Kylie were such inviting hosts and their apt does not disappoint! There response to our questions were prompt and gave us the most excellent recommendations on great places in the area to dine! We certainly will use them in the future and already recommended them to a friend!!! 
4340838,46413839,2015-09-10,31103901,Asher,"Very cute and clean!  Brian and Kylie were very communicative, and the separate entrance with programmable lock made our stay feel safe and convenient.  Thank you!"
4340838,46720790,2015-09-13,38596685,Annika,"We really enjoyed staying at Brian and Kylies place. The studio was nicely decorated, clean and perfectly equipped (full kitchen so we were able to cook dinner/prepare breakfast). The neighbourhood is quiet and basically everything is in walking distance (Donuts&Coffee, small supermarket,  2 bus lines to downtown). Thanks again guys, definitely a 10 out of 10 :-)"
4340838,46864418,2015-09-14,10129185,Sophie,"This darling basement apartment is tucked into a quiet, hilly neighborhood of beautiful old homes. When we arrived, we found a personalized note welcoming us with chilled cider in the fridge, lights turned on and music softly playing (a Pandora station created by Brian and Kylie for the band we came to Seattle to see perform!). These little touches are what make all the difference when staying away from home. The bed was immensely comfortable, the couch as well; we had everything we needed. Plus, the apartment stayed cool during the warm day. Brian and Kylie were easily reached by text and they even let us know that there may be extra overhead noise during their dinner party (which we were not home for). They recommended some nearby restaurants and advised when traffic would be lightest (during the Seahawks game!). Very thoughtful hosts! Would definitely stay here again!"
4340838,48069004,2015-09-23,36904752,James,We loved our stay in Seattle thanks to Brian and Kylie and their cute apartment. It was so much nicer than staying in a hotel. We had everything we needed to make our visit comfortable and enjoyable. The bed was awesome! The kitchen was well equipped making it easy to eat in when we wanted. The location is great…walkable to Tangletown and Greenlake with suggestions and maps to guide us.  We will plan on staying with Brian and Kylie again and would recommend their place to Seattle visitors.
4340838,48326357,2015-09-25,43893145,Jill,"The Greenlake studio apartment was our first experience with AirBnB.  Nothing but positive remarks for this place.  From the time we started communicating with Brian & Kylie...about reserving their place till the day we left; they always responded to our questions promptly and thoroughly.   The apartment was nicely appointed and very, very clean.  Cold bottled water waiting in the refrigerator and some kind of awesome coffee for brewing at your leisure.  Picnic basket for use, and complete kitchen.  Windows for light and fresh air.  The apartment is cozy and has a restful ambiance and comfortable bed and pillows.  This place is walking distance to Greenlake stores, eateries and cafes, park and walking trail around the lake.  A perfect location on a quiet street.  I would come back and stay longer."
4340838,48699139,2015-09-28,23126424,Jack,"This place was perfect, and is a total steal!  Completely met or exceeded my expectations in every way. I will absolutely try to stay here again if I come back to Seattle.  
Stayed here with my girlfriend for a long weekend while I was attending a conference near the UW campus, and this place had everything we could ever have needed and more.  Brian and Kylie were awesome hosts - left us to ourselves, but were always available and very accommodating, and made check-in and check-out super easy.  The place was very warm and inviting, with plenty of little touches to make it feel like home. One of the things that I appreciated most was that they provided maps of Seattle and the local neighborhood, marked with great recommendations for nearby restaurants. The bed was also incredibly comfortable (reminded me of a very nice hotel), and the kitchen was fully stocked with dishes, utensils and cookware.
The location was perfect too - a quiet residential neighborhood with the classic Seattle flavor of beautiful, unique Craftsman homes. Within a 2 minute walk, there are a bunch of cool local restaurants, a donut shop, coffee shop, and a fairly nice carryout/grocery.  Greenlake is a 5 minute walk and is a beautiful park with a nice trail surrounding the lake for walking/running/biking.  UW's campus is a little further, but still easily within walking distance, and only a 5 minute car ride.  Downtown is only 10-15 minutes by car, and with Uberx, Lyft, and Sidecar all operating in Seattle, it's easy to get a cheap ride.  
Botttom line: if this place is available - stay here!"
4340838,48928054,2015-09-29,10198507,Sean,Brian and Kylie were very accommodating and their place was clean and comfortable.  I would certainly stay there again.
4340838,49192282,2015-10-01,44698266,Kate,I had a great stay at Brian and Kylie. The studio was incredibly clean and had eveything I needed for a short stay. Other great additional touches were maps of the area and supplies for coffee and tea in the morning. I highly reccomend their place.
4340838,49337917,2015-10-03,42208999,Alexina,"This was such a great experience!! Brian and Kylie left us maps of the area with some fun places circled, and the apartment was so clean. The bed was AMAZING, and the apartment was very quiet in a beautiful neighborhood. I would 100% stay here again, and I would recommend it to everyone! "
4340838,49784930,2015-10-06,408065,Mateo,Really convenient location. Having the keypad lock instead of a key made it easy for us to check in late and leave early. Everything was great. 
4340838,50331557,2015-10-11,43382417,Heather,The Greenlake studio was the perfect weekend hideaway. Brian and Kylie had everything there that I needed including an iron and ironing board. The place was very welcoming when I arrived with music playing and heater going.  I would definitely visit here again. Thanks guys! 
4340838,50634742,2015-10-13,4394009,Alicia,Great place! Great location! Brian and Kylie were very accommodating and helpful.  Loved the bath towels and their cute kitchen even had a dishwasher!  Brian and Kylie had maps for various locations around the area and the 3-4 minute walk to Mighty-O donuts was perfect with another 5 minute walk to Greenlake an added bonus!  Thank you for the wonderful hospitality! 
4340838,51289520,2015-10-19,4549747,Lee,"We had a great stay at Brian and Kylie's. Check in/check out was easy. The space was inviting and comfortable and the bed was super comfortable.

4340838,52124309,2015-10-26,45621672,Robin,"Our hosts provided clear information about the ins and outs of using their studio apartment. They also provided neighborhood maps and tips about some of their favorite places--several of which we happily visited. The apartment was just as described, plus it was warmed up for our arrival, with soothing music playing to welcome us. The location and level of comfort was wonderful. We will want to stay here again when we visit Seattle and will be pleased to recommend it to any friends or family who also plan to visit the area."
4340838,53136465,2015-11-05,25648763,Brent,"Had a fantastic time staying here. The 26 and 16 busses are both convenient for getting to Fremont, Queen Anne, and downtown. The room is quiet and full featured-- I wasn't lacking for any kitchen equipment, and cook several times. I was surprised how big the studio was-- plenty of room to spread out and not feel cramped. "
4340838,53624604,2015-11-10,14779664,Annie,"The studio was clean, cosy and warm and was perfect for our Seattle stay. Very easy to get to the university district and everything we needed.

4340838,55776930,2015-12-06,23231390,Marilyn,"Brian was extremely helpful. He even put a small Patriot's helmet on the TV table to make me feel at home. He has a great sense of humor. Everything in the studio was perfect.  It was warm and cozy. The location could not have been better. I hope to stay there again in the future. Thanks for everything,  Brian."
4340838,56544631,2015-12-14,46494500,Jordan,"What an awesome place to stay in Greenlake! Cozy, comfortable, and nestled in a nice neighborhood outside Seattle. Off their suggestion, took a short walk to Elryian Tanglewood for some local brews. Check in and check out was smooth. We will definitely use this in our next trip to Seattle!"
9028447,56360049,2015-12-12,12904363,Jenny,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

7066118,40475224,2015-07-31,21873465,Leslie,"Dan and Teresa were incredible hosts. We needed a temporary home in between the closing of our old house and our new one. They were so friendly and made us feel welcome before we even arrived. They bent over backwards to meet all of our needs. Their rental space is light, bright, and clean. It is well-stocked in every area. The bathroom, kitchen and bedding was everything we needed. It was a perfect place for our family to live for three weeks. The home is located to shops, restaurants and walking paths. We settled in and enjoyed our stay immensely. 
We especially appreciated the private entrance, our own washer and dryer, and ample parking. Dan and Teresa were gracious and gave us privacy, but we also had a couple of really great visits on their lovely patio. I highly recommend this charming apartment. "
7066118,41017102,2015-08-03,26976230,Bryce,"Daniel and Teresa! You two were the best host we have had yet. From all the questions we asked to the recommendations you had given us, you guys were amazing. Thank you again for enhancing our Seattle experience. We will most definitely recommend you guys and stay with you again in the near future. Thanks again!"
7066118,41486328,2015-08-07,21148758,Ladina,"This was honestly the best Airbnb we have stayed at! Teresa and Dan are the best hosts you will ever get. They really go out of their way making sure you have the best experience in Seattle. The apartment has everything you need and want, even a blender so you can make your healthy smoothies :) Teresa and Dan have great suggestions for restaurants, breweries, and fun activities. We definitely fell in love with the apartment and the wonderful hosts! Also the apartment is super close to the bus stop that takes you anywhere you want in Seattle and there is a close running trail to their house.  If you want to go on a morning run, you should take their dog with she is a great running partner :) "
7066118,42150210,2015-08-11,23231026,Jennifer,Dan and Teresa were fabulous hosts and welcomed us to Seattle. They were a wealth of knowledge about the area and gave us great suggestions about what to do and see. We had a great experience and would definitely stay here again. 
7066118,43671848,2015-08-21,40057776,Christine,"Our stay at Dan and Teresa's home was wonderful. They were incredibly organized, detailed, and prompt with their responses, and checked in with us shortly after arriving. They were even able to accommodate us with an earlier check-in time since our flight got in well before 4. The basement apt was also fully stocked and impeccably clean (very important for someone who's OCD!). We were able to make coffee one morning - then realizing we didn't buy milk, found small creamer cups - very considerate! Laundry access was great too, coming from NYC where no washer/dryers are ever available in the apt and NON-allergenic detergent was available (also very considerate). Everything was nicely labeled. We mainly used their home to sleep and were out most days, and the location was fairly convenient from most of Seattle's touristy spots (all within 15-20 min range). Overall, an awesome experience and super cute apt!"

Daniel and Teresa were lovely hosts and great with communication. They gave advice and information about things to do in Seattle and were helpful in making our stay comfortable and easy. Wonderful stay at this North Seattle Charmer! "
7066118,46923711,2015-09-14,21381297,Jade,"Just as pictured/described. Both Teresa & Dan are lovely people. They were very welcoming & the apartment was super clean! Had everything you would need.

Would definitely stay again!"

They were very helpful about the area and Seattle in general. The basement apartment was a great place to stay for the 8 days I was in their home. They had every thing I needed to cook dinners during my stay, even a blender for my shakes.

The space was perfect and I look forward to staying there again next month.

I didn't have a car and had no problem getting around. They are close to the E bus route which takes you right downtown."
7066118,48734206,2015-09-28,11025951,Patrick & Kathryn,"Don't even hesitate because this is the place! Daniel and Teresa are awesome hosts. They put a gift pack possessing a few of Washinton's treats on the kitchen table for us. They offered their seats to a Sounders soccer game and a downtown parking spot.  This was the best Airbnb experience.

The place is clean and better than pictured.  The private entrance, washer/dryer, and all possible amenities you'd need make it a perfect rental.

We'll be making repeat visits to see our son in Seattle (and Daniel and Teresa's)."
7066118,51020076,2015-10-17,41128587,Chris,The unit was exactly as described and was stocked with more than what we expected. Daniel and Teresa were excellent hosts.

7066118,52523691,2015-10-30,41835843,Brandon,"Dan and Teresa are terrific hosts. This was my second stay with them. I am working 2 weeks a month in Seattle and this cosy basement apartment has become my home away from home. They are friendly and helpful. They always point out things to do and places to see based on our conversations. They have provided everything needed feel like you are at home. 

I work near Pike Place Market, and the commute downtown is ver reasonable, even during rush hour. It is a short walk to the bus stop and a single bus ride down town. 

Dan and Teresa went out of their way to make me feel comfortable. If you are staying in Seattle, their home is a great option. I highly recommend staying at Dan and Teresa's, you won't be disappointed.

"
7066118,53416362,2015-11-08,19749954,Ellis,"Daniel and Teresa have a lovely one bedroom guest apartment in NE Seattle. The neighborhood was cute and convenient, with restaurants and coffee shops nearby, and an easy drive to downtown Seattle. It was fully equipped for a cozy, home-away-from-home experience. Our hosts were lovely and very welcoming, even offering us baby-friendly Seattle tips! (We were traveling with our 5-month-old infant). This was our first Airbnb experience. We loved it!"
7066118,54444197,2015-11-20,41835843,Brandon,"Dan and Teresa are great hosts and wonderful people. I have to travel to Seattle almost every month and their hospitality keeps me coming back to their home. They are very helpful with suggestions on places to eat and things to see around Seattle. If I stay many more times I'm going to consider myself family.

The space is perfect and they have gone to great lengths to ensure that their guests have everything they need for their stay.  The kitchen has a nice selection of spices for cooking. The fridge has a good selection of condiments. They provided coffee, creamer and several different tea varieties. They had all appliances that I needed to cook my meals for the 2 weeks I stayed. The addition of a toaster oven was a nice touch.

If you get a chance to socialize with them you will be made to feel very comfortable.

My wife visited for a weekend this trip, they invited us to hang out with them on Saturday afternoon and we enjoyed a trip to the market and Two Beers Brewery with Dan, Teresa and Chloe.

The house is just a short walk to Aurora Ave where you can catch the E Line that takes you right downtown. 

Stop reading this review and book a stay at Dan and Teresa's, you won't be disappointed."

7066118,57526592,2015-12-27,16501812,Alia,"Wonderful, clean home with great hosts who checked in even while they were on vacation to make sure everything was good."
7066118,58412483,2016-01-02,51546568,Lakesha,"Our hosts communicated from the time of our booking until we checked out. We weren't sure about our public transportation options - I texted the hosts and they responded immediately. For our departure, we asked for a late check out and they were fine with it. All in all, a fabulous experience!"

4701205,26514140,2015-02-14,4153423,Matt,Brent was a great host. Great location too! 
4701205,26568042,2015-02-15,12903923,Everett,Brent's a nice guy and his place is as advertised. Just a futon in his living room but if you're looking to save a buck Brent is a nice guy and really helped me out when I stayed with him. Thanks Brent
4701205,26803228,2015-02-19,26585882,Lorenzo,Brent was a great host. Very chill and willing to help anyway he could. 
4701205,26853454,2015-02-20,10981763,Rosslyn,Brent was very nice and helpful. The sleeping space was as described. Thanks for accommodating me!
4701205,27024547,2015-02-23,27702607,Michael,"Brent is an awesome host. He shows you all the insider tips for eating, clubbing and must-see's if you ask him. The couch is exactly as shown at the pictures. It's not the biggest comfort, but if you need a cheap place near downtown then go and visit Brent!"
4701205,27360681,2015-03-02,21926840,Jeff,Brent took good care of me and even took me to get some excellent Malaysian food right across the street- chill guy and I definitely recommend his place. 
4701205,27483944,2015-03-05,22442669,Andrea,Brent fue un anfitrión muy agradable y nos ayudó en todo lo que pudo. La descripción del sitio es correcta. El espacio es pequeño pero para ahorrar dinero es un buen lugar. El barrio está bien comunicado y se puede llegar a downtown andando en 20 minutos.
4701205,27508907,2015-03-06,7960916,Sarah,The bathroom was dirty and the pillows and sleeping bags that were provided were also dirty. Room spelled like spam and pot. 
4701205,27550142,2015-03-07,1137046,Sharon,Brent was a wonderful host. He went beyond what I expected by showing me a great place to eat and the nightlife in Capitol Hill. It was just like staying with a friend. He was also flexible with check in/check out time which I greatly appreciated. Communication was easy via text. Futon was as described. Location was excellent for checking out the hip neighborhood. Thank you Brent!
4701205,27743384,2015-03-10,28471027,Yong,"Brent was an awesome host. He showed me around town, showed me how he makes music and we talked about a lot of things. This place is definitely more than a Crashing Pad."
4701205,28192446,2015-03-19,28309486,Therese,"It was fine.
"
4701205,28218668,2015-03-20,437376,Nhi,"Brent's place was as expected - small inner city studio. Ideal and economical option if you are just looking for a place to crash on a short trip to Seattle and to only be there for sleeping, but not a place you want to go to for relaxing or cooking etc. The couch is probably a little small for two people, so wouldn't recommend it for stays more than a night. Easy access to the city with just one bus, which was a nice bonus."
4701205,28481804,2015-03-24,28009851,Mario,My experience with Brent was good. He is nice and the hospitality was great. Small place and futon was comfortable. I would book again 
4701205,28635546,2015-03-27,15726612,Michael,"Top stay! Easy BNB especially if laying over or wanting to explore a more casual, less touristic side of town. Great food - Brent was kind enough to show me a bit of the neighbourhood on th first night and had a delcicious meal. Would happily stay again!"
4701205,28711477,2015-03-29,27487584,Jamie,"Great host, and good location."
4701205,29029488,2015-04-02,30369452,Brooke,"Brent was great - super welcoming!  The area of town was fantastic and the price was exactly what we needed.  The house was more like a bachelor pad, and so when we just needed a place to crash for the night it was perfect for us.  =)"
4701205,29177567,2015-04-05,27897755,Tristan,"Brent was a great host; showed me around Capitol Hill, and informed me of the other great spots to check out in Seattle. "
4701205,29645914,2015-04-10,30651021,Fabian,"Brent was helpful and friedly, He was  always available and ready to talk. The space is small but consistent with its price. A good solution for hosting near downtown. I recommend it."
4701205,29736699,2015-04-12,7961886,Christopher,"Can't imagine a warmer welcome than I got from Brent - really nice way to start off my stay and he was a unfailingly courteous person to share a space with for a few days.

 For the price you get a place to lay down + clean sheets and a clean towel. It's a great value for the neighborhood! Highly reccomended for people who need a place to crash."
4701205,30249089,2015-04-19,29960435,Harald-Nicolae,Brent was 
4701205,30690907,2015-04-26,28658136,Libor,"Brent is cool guy, we didn't see him a lot but every time he was helpful.
For 1 guy who needs to sleep over a night somewhere it's okay.  U will get what u see on the pictures."
4701205,31083949,2015-05-01,11272885,Gabriel,"I am very satisfied with my stay at Brent's place. He is super cool and down to earth, if you need a place to crash that is inexpensive and close to downtown Seattle this is your place. If your more high maintenance maybe no. Thanks for being a great host Brent! "
4701205,32095091,2015-05-13,5267540,Leif,"It was a bachelor, Spartan experience but no real surprises. Great location. Brent is friendly and easy going. No issues with noise, although I sleep with earplugs. "
4701205,32219303,2015-05-15,22633320,Kuan Ming,"Brent is very friendly and down to earth person. The place is quite convenient, very close to the downtown, Pike Place market, and espresso vivace. If you just need a place to stay and sleep, don't miss it!"
4701205,32432291,2015-05-17,8161960,Lea M.,Brent is very welcoming and easy going. If you are just looking for a place to sleep do not miss!
4701205,32721324,2015-05-20,33145242,Will,Host was great and welcoming. The area was nice and I felt safe walking around at 1am.
4701205,32803362,2015-05-21,10538602,Ariel,"Although I ended up not using the spot Brent was accommodating and friendly, no hassles and very flexible. I will always consider this as an option if I find myself in CapHill-Seattle needing a place to crash.  "
4701205,32804276,2015-05-22,654333,Pratap,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4701205,34347911,2015-06-07,32851463,Trip,Brent was a great host. Very welcoming and fun to hang out with. I'd definitely stay with him again. 
4701205,34614777,2015-06-09,35216839,Seijiro,近くに雰囲気の良いBarがたくさんあり、シンガポール料理？の屋台が美味しかった。部屋は一人で泊まる分には何も問題ないです。手ごろな価格で滞在を楽しめました
4701205,34747321,2015-06-11,32653238,Lucio,"Brent is friendly and easy gogin (quiet). There is a small room to sleep in a amazing district. Very dirty , no interphone, no key to enter. Very cheap for a great spartan experience."
4701205,35025478,2015-06-14,26175335,Christina,"His house has a great location and he is very nice. 
"
4701205,35422880,2015-06-18,33833545,Michael,Brent was a great host. Made me feel welcome and checked to see if there's anything I needed. Awesome location as well. I recommend this place for sure
4701205,36232365,2015-06-26,35874300,Hugo,"Brent is very nice, honnest, and particularly intéressant.  I have enjoyed my self à his place. Moreover thé location is perfect,  many restaurants, bars, safe and near downtown. It was gréât."
4701205,36340419,2015-06-27,36380948,Yuta,Brent is really kind and nice guy. He explained me a lot of things about Seattle. Also location is great. There are so many bars around his house and easy to access to downtown. 
4701205,44745846,2015-08-28,37681389,Sean P,"I was so happy last night when Brent accepted a request for a bed when our Amtrak train journey was cancelled due to fires. Brent is a very nice and easygoing person with a good sense of helping and being of service to folks. We found his place off the 49 bus, though I am sure there are other buses that go closely. We ended up getting our quota of sleep and hopefully the rest of the journey will proceed as planned. I will keep Brent on my contact list for future benefits."
3272374,14327414,2014-06-16,5067614,Bill,"Claire is an excellent host! Her apartment was clean, and cozy. Also, it surprisingly quiet given the great location within walking distance to everything Capitol Hill has to offer. I would definitely stay again."
3272374,14383320,2014-06-17,5600480,Lynette,The reservation was canceled 30 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3272374,14715399,2014-06-24,3363852,Leif,"Great stay and fun apartment, Claire was a wonderful and thoughtful host. Easy to contact and very accommodating/flexible with getting checked in. Good location too, would recommend staying for anyone interested. Thanks again Claire!"
3272374,15415644,2014-07-08,16760822,Katy,"Claire was very easy to work with. The photos were an accurate representation of the apartment, which was perfect for the two of us and our long weekend in Seattle. The neighborhood had several great places to eat & browse/shop, all within walking distance. You are in Capitol Hill and so everything is a downhill walk from the apartment so remember your comfy shoes--but this is all part of the Seattle experience for us! Public transportation is also nearby and easy to navigate."
3272374,16559838,2014-07-29,5226889,Jessica,"Claire's apartment is ideally located in a quiet neighborhood, yet within a short walk to some great cafés and restaurants. Communication was a bit spotty, but that may have been due to our limited phone service and last minute changes to her work schedule. The apartment is cute and we were pleasantly surprised by how comfortable the sofa bed was.  "
3272374,16777500,2014-08-02,9892625,Brittany,Claire went above and beyond- we ended up being massively late and she waited for us to show us around and make us feel at home. She also helped us find our way around the city. Claire's place is super cute and comfortable not to mention clean! We were so relieved to come back to claire's place knowing it was such a great place.
3272374,17353066,2014-08-11,16874176,Lauren,"My husband and I had a great stay at Claire's apartment!  It was quiet and very spacious, with everything we needed for a great weekend away.  Very cute walkable neighborhood with plenty of restaurants and bars near by.  

Claire was great with directions and flexible on timing to let us in.

All in all a fantastic experience!"
3272374,18792746,2014-09-01,5897356,Alyssa,"Claire was super responsive and helpful prior to the trip, and great about giving us our space while we were there.  She was also really great about accommodating our late arrival, which we appreciated.  The apartment was in a beautiful, very well connected area.  Space was perfect for two people, and there was available wifi.  

It did appear, however, that the sheets may not have been washed or changed from the guests before us.  There were also stains on both the bottom and top sheets.  While I might be wrong and hate to overreact, there was enough hesitation that we ended up sleeping on top of the comforter and using a shirt as a pillowcase while we were there.  So despite our otherwise lovely stay, I would probably look elsewhere the next time I'm in Seattle."
3272374,19962377,2014-09-21,17323534,Mona,"Great little apartment! Nice neighbourhood, very useful directions, towels and beds cosily readymade! thanks so much Claire!"
3272374,21314661,2014-10-14,16836517,Laura,GREAT NEIGHBOURHOOD.  We had a lot of fun exploring.  Apartment was also great  -  kitchen was well equipped and Trader Joe's is just a few short blocks away.  The sofa bed was extremely comfortable.  Claire was kind enough to wait for us when we got a bit lost and arrived late.   Is an older building so shower pressure was a bit lower than what we are used to.  Overall we would definitely come back!
3272374,21547916,2014-10-19,2888736,Hugo,"Claire was very helpful and responsive. We were arriving on a late flight and she was very accomodating . The neighborhood is really pleasant, you're close to stores, great cafés and coffee bars. We didn't use the kitchen but it was large and clean. Overall we had a pleasant experience. 
The living room - which is also the bedroom - could have been a little cleaner though. Also note that the sofa bed is firm (and not as comfortable as, say, a hotel bed). "
3272374,22213031,2014-11-01,20667333,Christopher,Great spot in a great location.  Claire was super responsive and a wonderful host.
3272374,22542028,2014-11-09,22100894,Jill,"Claire was very nice and responsive. Her apartment is in a great neighborhood! We enjoyed walking around and exploring. There's a lot of good places to eat and have cocktails. If want to cook, there's a couple of grocery stores near by.  The apartment is very cute. I like how she decorated the place. The sofa bed is very firm so if you don't like a firm mattress, I wouldn't stay here. My husband and I didn't mind.  Also, the living room could have used a little dusting. Other than that, I would stay here again b/c of the location, host, and price. 
  
"
3272374,23467084,2014-12-01,23876845,Bay,"Claire's place is very cute, and the location is great! Perfect size for two people. Claire is very flexible due to our delayed arrival but she's still there to check us in. We'd definitely stay here again next time in Seattle. Thanks for having us, Claire!"
3272374,23763081,2014-12-09,4447834,Carrie,"Claire and her place were amazing! Claire's place really has it all: it's cozy, great location, has parking (!!!), has a coffeemaker, and every detail is really thoughtful in her home. It looks like a wonderful page in an Anthropologie catalog. :) I would not hesitate to stay here again and I recommend it highly to others.

Claire was also really easy to contact throughout and was super accomodating of my late check-out time."
3272374,23972509,2014-12-15,24348956,Christopher,Claire was a great host and the listing was in a cozy and charming location. Her room has a lot of character and overall it was a good experience. I would recommend this listing to others.
3272374,24574199,2014-12-30,22089930,Jane,Had a lovely stay here. Super cute warm and charming studio. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to and had some drinks down the street at the Smith. Highly recommended!
3272374,24689624,2015-01-01,2384380,Miriah,"Claire was very welcoming and helpful, and also let us kees our bags there after the check out which was really nice.  The place was very cute and clean. The hot water was a little shaky for a moment but other than that we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay again! "
3272374,25395144,2015-01-14,8832967,Omari,Claire was great and very accommodating when my travel plans abruptly changed. The apartment is cozy but not small and everything was well set up when I got there. It's centrally located and by a number of cute bars/restaurants and several buses are minutes away. Highly recommended.
3272374,25516518,2015-01-18,21989080,Teresa,"Claire's place was lovely and perfectly-located -- we were within walking distance of a good number of coffee shops and restaurants. It's small, but with a huge kitchen, which made getting up in the morning so much easier, since we could enjoy coffee and pastries without leaving the apartment when we first woke up! Claire was a welcoming host and met us at her place to show us around. And the secured parking place was a big plus, since Capitol Hill has some pretty strict parking rules. Would definitely recommend!"
7325455,57193740,2015-12-22,5364345,Weston,"The space was clean and comfortable, cozy and fit my needs perfectly.  Enjoyed the location and the neighborhood, lots within walking distance.  The hosts were accommodating and nice, I would recommend this place to my friends and family!"
6658052,35598623,2015-06-20,34947282,Jason,"Our host was probably the best communicator I've nearly ever encountered. After arriving on the train, we had a short window before needing to head over to the baseball game. He ensured we had keys, and were shown the ends and outs. Although we didn't spend much time in the condo, it was everything we needed. Short walk to the Seattle Center and a quick uber away from the rest of downtown. Lots of restaurants nearby, and a Whole Foods, right on the corner. Again, we had an early morning train after our stay in Seattle, and he was there to meet us, making sure we enjoyed our stay. Highly recommended, as I would stay here again. Thanks!"
6658052,35754294,2015-06-21,2186011,Tim,Awesome!  Mack was super accommodating and attentive.  Listened to us and helped us with carrying luggage.  Above and beyond
6658052,35892809,2015-06-22,2127657,Chris,"Host was great. Had his Mom waiting for us at the entrance when we arrived and showed us the entire apartment. The apartment was clean and wifi was available (awesome). 

Easy check-out. Mack met us at the entrance of the apartment when we were leaving and we handed him the keys"
6658052,36580653,2015-06-29,24342507,Matt,"Booking with Mack was an easy and straightforward process. Mack was responsive and did a great job with the check in process. I was delayed on my arrival to Seattle and Mack and Urv were able to adjust schedules and made the check in process really simple. Mack also provided recommendations for local restaurants and attractions prior to my arrival. 

The apartment was as advertised and had a comfortable bed, fast internet, and a great view of Lake Union from the balcony. The neighborhood is a great place to walk around and has good restaurants nearby, all within walking distance, and the whole foods across the street has great breakfast and lunch options. The apartment building has great views of the Space Needle and partial views of the mountains from the two terraces. I will definitely stay with Mack again when I return to Seattle and would recommend anyone traveling to Seattle to stay with Mack. "
6658052,36751541,2015-06-30,5098261,Arleen,"It was a hot summer night and our portable AC had stopped working.  We contacted Scott in the mid afternoon about staying here that evening, and he went out of his way to accommodate my husband and I, including doing laundry for us at the last minute (obviously, he was not expecting anyone that night).  The unit is urban chic, and very well appointed (not to mention, the AC worked superbly).  Both my husband and I slept soundly on the comfortable bed, and I enjoyed coffee the next morning at La Toscanella, which is just next door.  I highly recommend this place to any couple looking for something in the middle of Seattle's tech scene with close proximity to downtown and a Whole Foods next door."
6658052,37522448,2015-07-07,19862462,Mark,"We had a lovely time on our visit to Seattle over the 4th of July holiday staying at Mack's place. We found the accommodation to be clean, well appointed and situated close to many attractions such as the EMP and Space Needle.
Mack was more than helpful, really responsive and a pleasure to meet. He provided guidance and couldn't do enough for us, great experience. This lovely place also had gym access which is really cool .... Weights, basketball court and more. We even watched the fireworks from the baloney, great trip!"
6658052,38208253,2015-07-13,60387,Jp,Mack was busy when we arrived but he arranged for his colleague to meet us. His colleague made us feel welcome and showed us around the property and gave us suggestions for places to go. Mack was very  easy to communicate with and responded quickly. Mack had many helpful suggestions. He also sent us messages making sure our stay was going well. The apartment is just like the pictures. The neighborhood is great and very pedestrian. We were able to walk to Pike place market area in about 10mins.  Parking was a bit difficult because the garages have different rates for day and evening making it complicated to keep a car 24 hours. We didn't use the car much so I probably wouldn't rent one again. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle.
6658052,38423280,2015-07-15,36550388,Nicholas,"Everything from the location to the condo was fantastic. It was clean, quiet, and safe. There are bars and restaurants near by that are pretty good and open late. I would recommend you staying here!"
6658052,38682636,2015-07-17,18416460,Andrew,Host replied promptly and saved the day as I needed a place for the night. Place is exactly as advertised and would be a great place to stay for an extended period of time. Good location with Whole Foods next door and many restaurants in the area.
6658052,39679429,2015-07-25,25646907,Andrew,"Awesome, clean apartment in a great location.  Mack was easy to communicate with and check-in was a breeze.  The building also has a gym and other common areas that are great.  The location is a 15 minute walk to Pike Place and easily walkable to other great locations.  There was street parking, but it was all metered.  I'd stay here again for sure! "
6658052,39844456,2015-07-26,10768816,Sisi,"Definitely great location! We only stayed one night, but it's very comfortable and clean set up in the apartment. I love that it has its own little patio.   Mack was quite busy, and I experienced 'waiting for people  in airport much longer than I expected' situation, which cause us arrived there late. But he was still been very helpful and gave really clear instruction to get in the apartment. In one sentence: totally worth to stay here!  Just one thing is that the apartment building has a kind of stuffy smell, but that's just bad circulation "
6658052,40766207,2015-08-02,6492658,Richard,"Appartement bien situé, sécuritaire et tranquille. À15 minutes à pied du Seatle Center et du Pike Place Market. Et surtout, à deux pas d'une épicerie très sympa Whole food Market. Thank you Mack!
"
6658052,45890559,2015-09-06,28762213,Francisco,Apartment was exactly as described. Large unit in beautiful new building. Very clean and well appointed. Also in a great location to explore this sites. Mack was very responsive and helpful in getting us settled. Would definitely stay again. 
6658052,46218319,2015-09-08,35150685,Mario,Great place. Would recommend.
6658052,46784507,2015-09-13,6910978,Andrew,"Mack and Diane were incredibly responsive throughout our trip to Seattle. The room was just as advertised, very modern and within easy walking distance of many of Seattle's main attractions. Bonus: There is a Whole Foods right beside the apartment which was very convenient. They also had the place stocked with drinks and food for us right when we showed up so there was no need to run to the store late for something to eat. It was a real pleasure staying here, and I would absolutely recommend this listing. Great hosts, great location, great room. Thank you for everything Mack. "
6658052,47198379,2015-09-16,42362489,Don,"Just a half mile from the heart of Seattle. We enjoyed coffee and 1st Starbucks coffee house, the space needle and even rode on the largest Ferris wheel.  "
6658052,47829710,2015-09-21,19530515,Vincent,"This was actually my first Airbnb experience, and it was perfect. We stayed 3 nights here. What a great, spectacular place Mack and Diane have. A beautiful, large flat with hardwood floors and an amazing view in a very nice area downtown. A small balcony where you can wake up and sip your coffee and take in the city. The location is close to all your main attractions from Pike Place, the Space Needle and everything else. 

We were greeted and given the key when we first arrived, as well as a quick tour of the place. Check in was easy, and checking out was even easier. Great communication with the hosts as they always responded promptly. 

It was hard to leave this place! I would definitely book it a 2nd time if I was ever in Seattle again. No doubt. Thumbs up. "
6658052,47902447,2015-09-21,44310559,Ryan,Mack was a great host.  The place was immaculate.  Location was walking distance to all the places we wanted to see!
6658052,48463857,2015-09-26,44542320,Natalie,"This is a wonderful place and area to stay, close to all the restaurants and of course the whole food market which is super convenient for us to do grocery shopping for our baby's food. Mack was extremely helpful and responsive to our needs, because we are traveling with a baby, so we have to rent a baby crib before arrival and Mack was super nice to help us set up the baby crib before we arrived at the apartment late at night. Everything was perfect, I would definitely recommend this beautiful place and come stay again when we visit."
6658052,48922778,2015-09-29,26621803,Damon,Mack met us and was very friendly and welcoming.  The apartment was very clean and well decorated.  We had a great time in Seattle and the apartment made an excellent home base for our trip.  I highly recommend it!
6658052,49193442,2015-10-01,45304476,Marques,"Mack was excellent. The host was able to arrange for our arrival on short notice. Check in was quick and painless! The place was beautiful and clean with a great view. The bed was very comfortable, the kitchen was well stocked and the bathroom is huge. The apartment is located in a very upscale, well secured building. We enjoyed having the Space Needle and Pike's Place within easy walking distance, and having a kitchen and washer/drier made this a much better value than a hotel."
6658052,49821028,2015-10-06,35260977,Josh,"We celebrated our 1 year anniversary in Seattle and Mack's spot was perfect for us. Walking distance to everything we needed like Pikes Place Market, the Space Needle, EMP Museum, etc. Worked out and shot b-ball everyday at the gym, enjoyed coffee on the balcony and had wine on the rooftop overlooking downtown. Mack was very helpful in getting us situated and advising on local attractions. Awesome trip all in all and I highly advise this spot."
6658052,50891584,2015-10-15,45984188,Martin,"Great place to stay in Seattle. Mack was most accommodating with our very late arrival at 1:15am. 

Very clean, modern space in a great location. Highly recommended!

"
6658052,51476730,2015-10-20,33687224,Dawn,"Perfect stay! We were met a block away and shown to the apartment, which was really nice and not having to worry about being buzzed in remotely. The apartment is gorgeous and nicely decorated, while remaining comfortable. 

The space has everything one might need - comfy bed, full kitchen, full size laundry all with a wonderful urban view!

The location is ideal. We walked up to Capital Hill (twice), Pike Place (twice), the  Space Needle, the piers, Century Link Field, Lake Union and every where in between.  There's a Whole Foods and a great pizza place half a block away. I can't say enough about the location.

We visit Seattle at least once a year and I hope we'll be staying here again.

"
6658052,52621517,2015-10-31,12717771,Simon,Diane & Mack were great - met me at the apartment and showed me around. Flat was amazing - really convenient for the conference centre and a great little base for our trip. Would definitely try another of their flats next time I'm in Seattle!
6658052,53299658,2015-11-07,1438122,Tim,"The condo was same as in the pictures......modern, open layout and big space. Felt right at home here. Great location close to lots of great restaurants and walkable distance to city center. 

Would definitely stay here again. "
6658052,53517112,2015-11-09,35990497,Scott,"Mack's apartment was awesome for our short weekend getaway.  The place was clean and well taken care of, and we were able to walk to Pike's Place Market.  We were very comfortable and Mack made us feel welcome as well as giving us recommendations.  It was a great experience and I would absolutely stay here again. "
6658052,54123173,2015-11-16,20582169,Kyle,Mack was very accommodating for our stay.  He met us a little early to give us the keys and the unit was nice and clean.  Mack also was happy to share some great suggestions to eat and answered our every question quickly. Would highly recommend his service! 
6658052,54386047,2015-11-19,3881764,Chris,"Mack was fantastic! He let me into the apartment ahead of schedule and showed me around until I felt at home. Really nice guy, would have loved the chance to chat with him more. The apartment itself couldn't have been better! Lots of space, lots of natural light, and every amenity you could ask for. The building was very safe and secure. The gym and basketball court was an added bonus! This was such a better experience than staying at the Holiday Inn 3 blocks away (where my company usually books people). The next time I travel to Seattle I wouldn't think twice about booking this apartment again."

2186330,13215771,2014-05-22,14248241,Nina,"Excellent experience. Everything clean, easy to access, great windows and a small balcony. There is no real dining table, so if you want to have several people over for a dinner party, be ready to eat casually from couches and chairs. "
2186330,13311259,2014-05-25,3734756,Cindy,"We had a great time! As a newbie AirBnB renter, we were a little confused with the 3rd party management company handling some of the logistics, but instructions were very detailed and easy to follow.  The suite and neighborhood was perfect for first time Seattle visitors.  We fit 6 in the suite comfortably (2 rooms + 2 rollaway beds).  The area was very safe, walkable to so many attractions and Jordan, StayAlfred and the building staff/security were so helpful.  Would highly recommend this to anyone and would use Jordan again if we were to return."
2186330,14358520,2014-06-17,9564810,David,Great Location and the apartment was perfect for us.  We had a great time.  Will definitely stay there again if I visit Seattle.  
2186330,15625880,2014-07-13,5803066,Todd,The place was very clean and organized.  Close to many places Seattle has to offer.  I would stay there again.  Easy Check-in and Check-out.
2186330,16236534,2014-07-23,18391623,Erick,Great spot!
2186330,18401689,2014-08-26,12932864,Carol,"Apartment was great and worked well for us. We don't smoke but could definitely smell smoke, presumably through the air conditioning. Also damage on some doors and furniture, did not affect us but unexpected given the documentation required.  The gym was excellent. Pool area and outside area were lovely. Beds really comfortable.  Nice view of Space Needle.  Excellent position in downtown Seattle. Really close to monorail, tram, buses and easy walk to Pike Place.  Plus the added bonus of Pamela's breakfast bar across the road and Barolo and Max Restaurants on the same block, both excellent.  Would stay here again."
2186330,18708538,2014-08-31,14288768,Cynthia,The neighborhood was great. Jordan was an excellent host. Place was exactly what I expected.
2186330,19368396,2014-09-11,12235246,Nadya,"The place was great. Perfect location downtown, clean and great views of the space needle. Check in/out was easy. Overall, great stay and would go back if in Seattle."
2186330,21688755,2014-10-21,22533539,Janet,"Amazing location, accommodations were great, easy check in and check out process. Hassle free!"
2186330,22518557,2014-11-09,17309877,Martin,"The Stay Alfred experience is pretty well managed.  The link through to their website with full instructions was easy to follow and got us smoothly through the apartment concierge and into our apartment.

The apartment was as described and had all we needed for our stay.  

The check out process was also documented and easy to follow.  Overall exactly as described."
2186330,26021085,2015-02-01,17466272,Heather,"My husband and son stayed in the condo and had a great time. Parking was requested, the stalls are quite small.  The beds were comfortable and the washer and dryer was definitely a plus. Thank you!"
2186330,26699469,2015-02-17,6623211,Raz,"While the property was very nice with a swiming pool, business lounge, fitness room and jacuzzi, it missed on all of the AirBNB experience with a very cold ""suite apartment renting"".
this is a well organized real estate company and not privately held property. 
they force you to download their mobile application which creates lots of overhead.
In addition to that, the apartment WiFi was very slow with only 5MB download speed which made it impossible to use.
"
2186330,27429257,2015-03-04,24746077,Maggie,位置不错，房子挺大，就是厨房用品不全！其他都不错！
2186330,30795717,2015-04-27,3019597,Endi,"Jordan was quite responsive, at least during the booking process. He manages several units in the same building. However, my reservation was changed from one unit on a higher floor to another on a lower floor without informing me.

The location is pretty good. It's near the train station to airport and monorail to Space Needle, but there is only a limited selection of restaurants around that area and if you want to go to Pike Place Market you'd have to walk at least 8 blocks.

The place feels like a hotel suite rather than a private condo. The check in process is done via an app, and it couldn't find my reservation so I had to call the customer service. When I arrived I picked up the keys from the security guard. The AC was programmed to a very low temperature at night and if you want to know how to change it you'd have to call the concierge at the normal business hours. Later I found out one of the keys did not work and had to be reprogrammed. Also, neither of the two printers at the business center were working and nobody was there to fix it.

So if you're not really looking for a personalized Airbnb experience, this place is OK assuming they fix the above issues.
"
2186330,31814469,2015-05-10,27910271,Andrew,"Well organized, clean, great location"
2186330,32769987,2015-05-21,32004694,Jerry,"We rented this place to check out the city a little bit before we went to the Sasquatch music festival. It was perfectly located for our needs between the more touristy areas and a quick Uber to areas like Capital hill for the some awesome night life spots we enjoy visiting.

Overall, the place was easy to find as it was just a few blocks off the light rail from the airport. Checkin was simple, just walked in and gave them our information. The front desk was very helpful explaining all the information we needed to enjoy our stay.

I'd definitely recommend this rental for location, size, quality, and overall experience."
2186330,34882508,2015-06-13,33742153,Elizabeth,"We had a nice experience! A few hiccups. The internet never worked and when we called the customer service number no one ever answered! The host was always helpful and responded quickly. We tried to get an early check in by a few hours because the event we were there for started at 3pm and check was no earlier than 3 pm. We asked the day before for an early check in but they couldn't because they said the cleaning service was booked so they couldn't accommodate an earlier check in so that was a bit of a bummer. The unit was new, clean, had 2 balcony's, all the amenities you could ask for and the security and concierge were both so helpful! There were 2 couples and our adult son and we had 2 car rentals but only one parking pass for parking which wasn't cool that we had to find other parking or pay $50: day at the building. I think there should be an option to get a second parking pass with no problem at no cost or at least a minimum additional charge. But they weren't able to give us any other option. Other than that this unit was great. The location was great and Jordan, the host and Stay Alfred were nice to work with."

2186330,45279112,2015-09-01,11300861,Stephanie,We had a great stay in downtown Seattle! The location is walkable to so many great restaurants and shopping (and the monorail station that you can hop on to take straight to the Space Needle!) The condo was very clean and everyone who worked in the lobby and for Stay Alfred was extremely helpful and friendly. They even went above and beyond when I left something behind. I appreciated that very much. Thank you all for such a relaxing vacation! 
2721575,12868544,2014-05-12,15109393,Jacob,"Debbie was wonderful and the apartment was a perfect, quiet getaway! Will definitely stay there in the future! "
2721575,13109151,2014-05-19,14915166,Alex,"The apt was wonderful. Very clean and comfortable. Debbie is an awesome host. We didn't meet but she checked in from time to time to see if all was ok and whether I needed anything. She thought of every little necessities i.e. shampoo, coffee, creamer & soap. I felt my privacy was respected. "
2721575,13377921,2014-05-26,3102656,Valerie,"Debbie was a terrific host! She checked in a couple of times to make sure we had what was needed. We'll definitely stay again next time we are in Seattle.
Great location, easy parking, nice host!"
2721575,13552146,2014-05-30,15747590,Kevin,"Staying in the Columbia City Apartment was the best decision we could have made for our house hunting trip to Seattle. It is close to downtown and in a beautiful neighborhood. Good food and sight seeing attractions were easily accessible. And our host was gracious and thoughtful. Debbie was an absolute joy! We would have never gone back to reality, given an option. "
2721575,13692850,2014-06-02,2466417,Perry,"Debbie's apartment is wonderful!  It's well decorated, spacious, and clean.  It's also located very close to some great amenities, including the Columbia City strip and a couple of big parks.  The light rail is fairly close as well.  Debbie made check-in and check-out very easy, and also checked in after the first night to make sure everything was OK.  I highly recommend this great apartment for visiting family or anyone looking to get a great Seattle experience.  With the light rail fairly close, much of Seattle is just a short walk away (downtown, pike market, stadiums, airport, etc)."
2721575,14453945,2014-06-19,2871086,Jan,"I had a very positive experience with Airbnb and with my hostess, Debbie. She was very prompt with information and helpful with all the details as well. The apt is very quiet and neat as a pin. The decor is comfortable with everything one might need for their stay. The neighborhood of Columbia City is a favorite and has the best farmer's market on Wed and great restaurants. Having beautiful Seward Park and Lake Washington in the back yard was nice too."
2721575,14617311,2014-06-23,4161656,Kristina,"Debbie was a wonderful host!! I couldn't have asked for a better experience. She went out of her way to make the stay comfortable, even cooked dinner one evening and invited me to join.  The location of this apartment is perfect - about a 15 dollar cab ride to downtown and walking distance to many shops, restaurants  and the light rail in Columbia City! During the week there was a farmers market. Lake Washington with views of Mt. Rainier was a short walk as well.  The apartment itself was meticulous and spacious. I felt like I was staying at a friends house. I will be back to Seattle again and I wouldn't stay any where else! "
2721575,14873075,2014-06-28,15579410,Nicolene,"We had a wonderful time in Seattle, and we were so glad we stayed in this AirBnB. It was spacious and so clean! The (king size) bed was heavenly. The kitchen had everything you need to make meals, which we did twice a day. There are bus stops and grocery stores, parks and a movie theater within walking distance. There was even a closet in the bedroom, so we unpacked for the week. This place has all the little things necessary for a very comfortable stay. We never met Debbie but she checked in to see if we needed anything. We will definitely recommend this place to everyone we know."
2721575,14985905,2014-06-30,13585587,Kyle,"Debbie was extremely communicative from when I booked the apartment. She was helpful and friendly throughout before and during my visit.

I enjoyed my stay as the apartment is in a great neighborhood with views of Lake Washington and of downtown Seattle. 

The apartment was comfortable, although head's up on the low ceiling. All in all, I would stay here again and I absolutely would rent a room/apartment again from Debbie. "
2721575,15358205,2014-07-07,17082670,Beth,"This was our first experience with an AirBnB booking. Debbie's apartment was easy to find, off street parking, quiet neighborhood. It is a basement apartment, which was very nicely finished. The only problem we had was the low ceilings vs. my husband's height. We had everything we needed, and more. I would recommend this listing."
2721575,15679352,2014-07-14,8638167,Beth,"I had a wonderful 4-night stay at Debbie's apartment. The photos were accurate - the place was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. Loved the king bed and huge closet. It's a basement apartment, but the windows let in so much light you'd hardly know it. Kitchen was fully stocked with everything you'd need to cook for yourself - but honestly we never did with all the fantastic restaurants nearby. 

Debbie was the perfect host. Friendly, communicative, and offered recommendations for what to do during our stay. I would definitely return here in a heartbeat! "
2721575,15837552,2014-07-16,5269644,Victoria & Dale,"Debbie was such a gracious host!  The house is so Cute and Artsy (;lot's of treasure throughout)  Surpise greeting was an amazing book and home movie collection!

Please venture out and see Columbia City!! It's diverse, fun, and funky! 

Light rail is not too far away- while walking stop and smell the roses-- Lot's of interesting neighboring homes with nice gardens (some with with large sunflowers), organic vegetables, and cleverly designed one of a kind homes! 

The bed and sofa was ""ah"" so comfortable!

I loved the added touches Debbie provided!

The mattress was a little too firm for my osteoarthritis and when Debbie found this out, she brought two extra soft pillows to see if that would help.  The apartment looked like the pictures online.  Debbie has the kitchen stocked with all the items needed to do light cooking.  The place was clean and well mantained.  The apartment does not have cable, but a variety of dvd's were available in the apartment to watch.  The apartment was very convenient in using the light rail to downtown Seattle.  Just a few blocks from the apartment were local restuarants.  It was very nice having an off street parking spot.  "
2721575,16433351,2014-07-27,7153201,Amy,Very enjoyable stay! Our flight arrived late evening & Deb gave us excellent directions. Approx 15min cab from airport ran about $30... 12min Uber to downtown ran $14. The space was cozy basement with lots of natural light. the king sized bed was comfortable and the bedroom had small nook area for yoga in AMs.. ceiling is very low in areas. The neighborhood was great for walking with parks and waterfronts to enjoy. Never had been to Seattle we figured we could grab a late night dinner in the neighborhood on a Thursday but most places closed between 9-10.. (probably different on weekends?). Great stay!
2721575,16832058,2014-08-03,5190942,Jennifer,"My husband and I spent a week at Debbie's place to have a remote working vacation. We loved staying there. She was super helpful with tips on what to do in the area and how to get around. She also made sure we had reliable internet connectivity throughout the week. Her apartment was clean and spacious and had exactly what we needed. I was especially impressed with how well-appointed the kitchen was. The neighborhood is great, too. Just a short walk to the main street of Columbia City. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in the area."
2721575,17100844,2014-08-07,7362243,Rick,"Of our five airbnb experiences thus far, Debbie's was clearly the most prepared and thought-out. Without exaggeration, she had thought of everything needed to make our stay in Seattle enjoyable and worthwhile--from coffee beans, grinder, and French press, to a fully equipped kitchen, to reading material as well as DVDs, and to a nicely organized binder with maps, things to see in Seattle, information about the  main street of Columbia City with its many shops and restaurants, and instructions about the apartment.
      All this was most helpful, as we had only brief personal contact with Debbie, a contact that confirmed the conscientious, flexible and most pleasant person we had imagined Debbie to be through our frequent and rapid e-mail exchanges.   
     The apartment is unbelievably spacious, private, and very comfortable. It has been meticulously designed and furnished. As a half-submerged basement apartment, it does still lack some natural light and, as one other reviewer noted, can present some problems for quite tall people (by my estimation, those 6'5"" and taller) with its lower ceilings. As an older couple who has some difficulty negotiating hills, we were thankful that we had a rental car at our disposal, since the apartment is located in a quite hilly section of Seattle. This is probably not the ideal location for anyone who has problems walking up and down hills, but Seattle itself was, to our surprise, also quite hilly. 
    In sum, however, a delightful place hosted by a delightful person! We recommend Debbie's apartment with great enthusiasm, especially for those under 60 and 6'5""!"
2721575,17350668,2014-08-11,16707217,Jennie,"Debbie was great, very welcoming.  It's almost like you are staying in a Bed and Breakfast.  Coffee, tea, KIND bars and chocolates left for you.  There is even a view of the city from the bedroom window.  Also it stayed nice and cool with minimal help from a fan."
2721575,17766699,2014-08-17,15401930,Erin,"Stayed here for two nights. Debbie was a welcoming and accommodating host. The room was comfortable and well appointed. Everything was provided that a traveler would need and then some (iron/ironing board, q-tips, blow dryer, kitchen supplies, French press, coffee bean grinder etc). We loved the location and Columbia city. Many cafés and shops are within walking distance as long as you don't mind some hills. Parking was never a problem. Only thing we wish travelers to note is that this is a basement apartment with low ceilings. My husband is 6'5"" and had to duck most of the time but this obviously won't be a concern for most people. Nevertheless we would definitely stay again. "
2721575,17947168,2014-08-19,3119847,Lilla & Steve,"We've had a wonderful stay at Debbie's apartment. The place was very clean, tastefully decorated, well equipped with all of the necessities. The bed was very comfortable. Parking in the driveway and private entrance with coded lock was a plus, we didn't have to worry about loosing keys or locking ourselves out. Debbie was a very attentive but not intrusive hostess.  She was available by text to answer any of our questions and it was very easy to communicate with her. We would definitely stay with Debbie again. Thank you Debbie.

Beyond the apartment itself, I was most impressed with Debbie's proactive communication via text and email. I was never in doubt or had any questions because of how thorough she was. 

Debbie, thank you very much for making our first Airbnb experience such a pleasant and memorable one!"
2721575,19523347,2014-09-14,18500665,Jessica,"We had the pleasure of staying with Debbie for a weekend. The apartment is so well-kept and charming, and very spacious for 2 people. It was very easy to communicate with Debbie beforehand and during our visit. I knew exactly what to expect when we arrived, and she let us check in early to leave our bags, which was so helpful. 

The house is in a wonderful neighborhood, just a few blocks from restaurants, coffee shops, a movie theater and more. Plus, it is within walking distance of the light rail, which made it very easy to get there from the airport. 

All in all, we loved staying here and felt like we got a more ""local"" experience than just booking  a hotel. We also appreciated the little treats that Debbie left for us! If we are ever in Seattle again, this will be our first choice."
2721575,20832584,2014-10-06,20266023,Jeremy,"We loved Debbie's Colombia city apartment! The place was really cute and cozy, and had everything we needed. It was just a 5 minute walk to the main street in Colombia which had some great restaurants and we loved the Colombia City Bakery! And the light rail was an easy 10 minute walk from the house and was super convenient to get around on, and go downtown. Debbie was super helpful, and easy contacted by text. We would definitely stay here again! "

Seriously...when I say perfect, it was the right size and cozy for the two of us traveling. She gave us plenty of space, but also kept tabs to make sure we arrived safely and had no issues.

Two added pluses: Parking available in the front/or separate driveway and easy access/egress with lock.

Combined with price and good location, this would be a place we highly recommend.

Thanks, Dave and Dennis"
2721575,22036074,2014-10-28,22256305,Charlie,"Debbie's place was fantastic! She was very welcoming and texted us to provide all of the pertinent details a few days prior to our stay.  She also provided a detailed booklet with information about Columbia City and how to get around the area, as her place is about 15 min from downtown.  We loved her DVD (The Big Lebowski!) and book collection.  We also appreciated how well-appointed the accommodations were.  Extra towels and blankets, coffee, breakfast items, and even q-tips were thoughtfully provided.  Definitely recommend this while visiting Seattle and would love to stay here again - Debbie created a perfect AirBnB experience!"
2721575,22523723,2014-11-09,20907503,Matt,"Great space (bigger than it looked in photos) and a welcoming host. What more could you ask for? 

Debbie was very responsive via text, and we didn't have any problems with the space. Private entrance made the whole stay feel very, well, private. 

Recommended. "
2721575,22680612,2014-11-11,2315832,Abbie,"What a wonderful place to stay! So comfortable, so beautiful, so convenient, and such easy logistics with a gracious host. We never met Debbie in person, but her texts were thorough, timely, and conscientious. She took great care of us and made everything easy.

Our visit was too short, with only 2 nights on a trip home to Seattle for a job interview and to visit family and friends. As others have noted, everything you need is here. It is so spacious, especially the near-palatial bedroom with its large ""changing room"" area and full-size closet. And the bed! So big! So comfortable!

We loved the earth-tones color-scheme and art and artifacts used in the decor. Note that the floors are concrete, so bring your slippers or your house socks if coming in the colder months. The cadet wall heaters do a great job keeping the space warm, and it probably stays deliciously cool in the warmer months.

If you require a dining table, you won't have one here. That didn't bother us: we like cozy meals on the sofa anyway, and the breakfast bar stools are there, too. Both of us are under 6'/2m tall, so we hardly noticed the low-ish ceilings. The windows are well-placed to let pleasant daylight in, too, as you can see in the photos.

We loved the neighborhood--Columbia City is so much fun to explore. Easy to do on foot, and connect with all the good transit nearby. Having the dedicated off-street parking space was a big bonus, especially on a steeply sloping street.

Not too surprisingly for a basement apartment, where it's hard for signals to reach, the wi-fi was a bit slow and sometimes dropped signal for us. Debbie generously offered to let us come upstairs into her home for a stronger signal, but our visit was brief and jam-packed so we were OK.

Thanks, Debbie, for everything! We hope to be back! "
2721575,23236603,2014-11-26,9894638,Claire,"Although we never met Debbie, she came across as a very kind and hospitable lady who was always checking in to see if everything was ok during our stay. My friend got sick whilst we were staying at Debbie's place and it was so comforting to know that she had somewhere so homely and comfortable to recuperate. Debbie's place was immaculately clean, very tastefully and nicely decorated and conveniently situated to transport links. We had a lovely stay in Debbie's apartment and thoroughly recommend it! "
2721575,23317793,2014-11-29,16188710,Barbara,"We were e-welcomed by Debbie McGibbon throughout the entire process...when arranging to stay at her airbnb location.  The description was accurate and accommodations lived up to all that we envisioned and hoped for.  
I didn't personally get a chance to meet Debbie, but this in no way effected our stay;  her professionalism in replying to each inquiry was quick and very helpful.  She was also very friendly in our correspondence, which is encouraging when travelers [us] aren't sure what to expect.  "
2721575,24330394,2014-12-26,12367586,Elisabeth,"My mom stayed at Debbie's over Christmas, and we both thought it was delightful. It's a spacious, clean, one-bedroom unit and very tastefully appointed with everything necessary for a cozy stay--a comfy living room with a supply of books and DVDs, and a kitchen stocked with coffee, milk, and fizzy water. You could cook full meals here if you wanted to. The location is also great, about a five minute walk from the area around Columbia City's main strip, where there are some excellent restaurants (try La Medusa), cafes (try Empire), a great butcher and a great bakery, a yoga studio, and a movie theater. Highly recommended.
"
2721575,25306457,2015-01-12,21541577,Jolene,"Great apartment, tastefully and comfortably furnished. Very attentive and friendly host. Fabulous neighborhood."
2721575,25572669,2015-01-19,3414865,Erica,Very cozy and welcoming! Perfect for a weekend getaway. It's location is so nice. Super close to some great shops and restaurants- you can't stay there without going to Tutta Bella! Debbie is such an accommodating host!! 
2721575,26247731,2015-02-08,19856952,Beverly,"Debbie was warm and welcoming. Since no one was arriving for a stay the next day she offered us a later check-out time. The apartment is clean, quiet and cozy. The bed is very comfortable. We liked the location because it is close to where our daughter and family live and also close to our favorite restaurant: Geraldine's. We hope to stay here again on our future visits to Seattle."
2721575,27764408,2015-03-11,11077274,Judy,"Yes,  this is a complete  one bedroom basement apartment{  with windows}>   The kingsize bed has a wonderful mattress and the closet space and ""dressing room""  is awesome.   It is very quiet apartment even though it is in a bustling community on bustling street.  There is an off-street parking place  right in front of the apartment.   It takes some practice getting the skill and
courage to back out of the parking space because  street parking is dense  and you cannot see oncoming traffic.  You will not find a better equipped apartment or a roomier  one,  I don't believe.
"
2721575,28197546,2015-03-19,14685252,Deb,Very clean apartment. Debbie was a great host and accommodated our late arrival. 
2721575,28356662,2015-03-22,22086788,Meeshee,"We had an absolutely fantastic weekend relaxing in Debbie's place! It's exactly as pictured, if not cuter. Debbie clearly has the gift of hospitality. There wasn't a single touch missing. We felt very much ""at home"".  Clean, tastefully decorated and really welcoming. I can't say enough about how nice her apartment is. Did I mention the King size bed? Awesome, I slept like a baby!  High recommended! Would definitely there stay again! Thanks Debbie :)"
2721575,28964647,2015-04-01,29825762,Mario Ulysses,The place was very comfortable in a safe and popular location. The layout was bigger than I expected and very clean. I would recommend.
2721575,29403441,2015-04-07,4500867,Denise,"This was a perfect location for us to walk to our family members' house in Columbia City.  It is very tastefully decorated and the bed is super comfortable. There was everything we needed in the kitchen and snacks were provided in the refrigerator.  There was also a good selection of tea and coffee.  Debbie was very quick to respond to communications, and the number-pad key mechanism made access to the apartment very simple.  "
2721575,30198191,2015-04-19,19856952,Beverly,"We have stayed with Debbie before. She is very warm and welcoming and has a detailed notebook about the area. We appreciate the privacy, the quiet, and the comfortable bed. Our favorite restaurant, Geraldine's, is within easy walking distance as are many other restaurants. Debbie is always available if we have a question."
2721575,30842473,2015-04-27,1507645,Manda,"My husband, our toddler and I celebrated my birthday weekend here and are already planning a return trip! Debbie was a gracious and welcoming host and respected our privacy. She was quick to respond to texts and even let us stay a little later since she didn't have a guest staying the night we checked out. We appreciated the welcome/information notebook with menus and info of the neighborhood. 

The apartment was beyond our expectations - very clean, very spacious, cozy, well-lit and the decor is beautiful. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware, cooking utensils, leftover containers and even Ziploc bags and foil/cling-wrap. The bed-sheets and towels smelled fresh and were soft and clean. There was ample storage and wardrobe space, with a separate little private area in the bedroom to get dressed. The off-street parking was very convenient as well. The neighborhood is quiet and the houses are adorable and well-kept. We felt safe and right at home!

This location is situated a short 5 minute walk to a large park equipped with a toddler-friendly playground, and a 10 minute walk along a nature trail to Lake Washington. Columbia City main street is another 5-10 minute walk, here we enjoyed (and highly recommend) Geraldine's Counter and Empire Espresso Bar. It took us about 15 minutes to drive downtown and to the aquarium."
2721575,32458579,2015-05-18,19856952,Beverly,"Debbie always makes us feel welcome. She is friendly and always checks in to make sure we have what we need. We enjoy this apartment. It is clean, quiet, comfortable, and close to our favorite restaurant and close to the light rail. Plus, Debbie has beautiful flowers in her yard."
2721575,32810667,2015-05-22,25646305,Tami,"We had a great first Airbnb experience. The basement apartment was very comfortable and nicely furnished. Debbie is a wonderful host and went above & beyond to make sure we had a comfortable stay. The apartment is conveniently located and within walking distance to restaurants, shops, parks & Lake Washington. It was an easy drive into the city and it was refreshing to retreat back to the apartment. "
2721575,33103787,2015-05-25,7872006,Paul,"Debbie was fantastic, as was her apartment. The place is very clean and you can tell has been designed and renovated carefully with lots of great attention to detail. Couldn't have asked for better, and the location is great. Debbie herself was very helpful and communication was perfect. I'd recommend to anyone!"
2721575,34156620,2015-06-05,33472002,Dan,"Debbie was a great host!  She kept in touch before and during our stay and made sure we had everything we needed.  The apartment was so adorable!  The keyless entry was convenient.  The kitchen was well equipped and stocked with snacks, coffee and tea.  The living room was cozy and comfortable and have library of DVDs and books.  But the best part must be the memory foam king sized bed! It was so comfortable, you might not want to leave!  She also provided us with off street parking when we had the rental car.  For those commuting, the bus stop is less than 10 minutes downhill walk from the apartment.  Although someone taller might have an issue with the ceiling height, we didn't. This apartment was perfect for us (shorter people)!"
2721575,34721685,2015-06-11,20097300,Logan,"We had a fantastic stay in the Columbia City Apartment! Debbie was a wonderful host and we felt right at home. The apartment itself is well decorated and cozy, and includes all of the conveniences you will need while visiting Seattle. The location is excellent, with easy access to all of the big attractions downtown and lots of great local restaurants in the Columbia City area.

We did an enormous amount of walking in Seattle, and our evenings in the apartment were very relaxing at the end of each day. We don't have a single negative thing to say about it! We're looking forward to coming back.

-Logan and Caty"
2721575,35536713,2015-06-20,21541577,Jolene,"My folks had another great stay at Debbie's place. She is a very attentive, responsive and amiable host. The apartment is spacious, tastefully decorated, and comfortable. It has everything you need and more. It is a lovely find in a fabulous Seattle neighborhood and we would stay again in a heartbeat! "
2721575,35814038,2015-06-22,16298303,Edward,Debbie's apartment worked very well for our short stay there. It was very clean and has a large and comfortable bed. It is centrally located to the area and has a good selection of restaurants nearby in particular an excellent bakery where we had breakfast each morning. 
2721575,36136793,2015-06-25,35827162,Ruth,"This ""English Basement"" apartment is conveniently located between Sea-Tac airport and Seattle, making it very convenient to both and easy for visiting Seattle. Debbie's attentive directions made it easy for us to find and get into at 4:30 am after delayed flights and missed connections from the East Coast. The space was very cute, well appointed and Debbie made us feel welcome. It was the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in! Since we rented a car at the airport, we did not negotiate public transportation. Driving in, out of and around the City was easy."
2721575,36362254,2015-06-28,13422835,Kathleen,"We can't wait to return to Debbie's apartment and have already referred it to friends. While Seattle was experiencing a very hot spell, we were comfortable and cool. 
The furnishings are lovely and Debbie is a gracious host."
2721575,36957044,2015-07-03,18018208,Joanie,"I had a great experience, Debbie is responsive and very communicative. The apartment is fresh, clean and inviting, I will stay again!"
2721575,37191641,2015-07-05,34885435,Cindy,"Debbie's apartment was clean, cute and cosy! The pictures online represent the place accurately and I had no complaints. There were extra towels in a cabinet if needed and she also provided some protein bars and nice cold bottled water, which was a kind gesture. There's also a nice selection of books and movies to choose from if you wish. The bus stop to downtown  is about a 5-8min walk and takes less than 30 mins to get to downtown. Although I did not meet Debbie in person, she kept in contact through text to make sure everything was okay. Overall very satisfied and happy with our stay! Thanks Debbie! "
2721575,38126229,2015-07-13,18760321,Sara,"Our stay was wonderful! The house is in a quiet neighborhood, close to the city. The apartment had easy private entry, easy parking, was wonderfully clean, and all the amenities you could want. 
 
The bed was super comfy and the neighborhood was quiet which allowed for great sleeping. 

This is the perfect comfy and cozy sat in Seattle.

Debbie was wonderful!"
2721575,38865463,2015-07-19,35346141,Jeff,"Our experience at Debbie’s place was fantastic from start to finish. The apartment exceeded our expectations, being beautifully appointed and extremely comfortable, with an eye for aesthetics and attention to detail evident throughout. Checking in was as easy as it gets, with Debbie providing information about accessing the unit well before our arrival and being very responsive to our communications throughout. Debbie left a comprehensive set of menus for local restaurants, and made herself available to provide recommendations about places to eat and things to do. Being near a Link metro station made Debbie’s place a great location to explore Seattle, and having amazing restaurants close by made for nice transitions to and from the larger city itself. Should we need a place to stay in Seattle again, Debbie’s place will be at the top of our list."
2721575,39151684,2015-07-21,13422835,Kathleen,"Debbie's apartment is a favorite of ours in Columbia City. Love the decor, it's quiet and a great place to relax and return to at the end of a busy day with family. Hope to return often."
2721575,39487862,2015-07-24,30807141,Lisa,"I had the opportunity to spend 4 weeks at Debbie's place in July as I used it for temporary corporate housing.  First off, since it's a partial basement apartment it stayed nice and cool which was such a relief in an unexpectedly hot Seattle summer.  The apartment is quite spacious and the impeccably clean.  The kitchen is well outfitted, and all the furniture quite nice and very comfortable.  Debbie lives upstairs, but I never heard a thing.  There was a little difficulty with the Wifi in week 3, but she got a new service and by week 4 it was working perfectly.  She was great with texts to stay in touch and was super helpful.  I would highly recommend Debbie's place if you're looking for a good location with a great little apartment. "
2721575,39831313,2015-07-26,38113320,Kevin,"Debbie was great and I loved this apt!  Beautiful neighborhood and fairly close to food and link train.

"
2721575,41328418,2015-08-07,29539160,Ka,"Debbie's little apartment was perfect, everything we needed was there. The neighborhood is very peaceful and quiet. Debbie was also a great host, she answered any questions that I had right away. There was more than enough supplies inside the apartment and everything was pretty much accurate as to what you see on the pictures. I recommend her airbnb apartment to anyone who is interested! "
2721575,42523529,2015-08-14,33860305,Valerie,"Our stay here was wonderful in every way. The place is exactly as listed and decorated in a charming way that made us feel at home and comfortable. The kitchen has everything needed and then some. Debbie was responsive to questions that we had, friendly and helpful. I can not say enough about her perfect blend of helpfulness and professional attitude. Thank you, Debbie! 

The location was perfectly situated for us, outside the city center but close enough to get there within a few minutes. The neighborhood has a charming historical center as well with some great restaurant and cafe choices. 

We would absolutely recommend this place, and Debbie as a host, to anyone at any time. And we will!
"
2721575,43357439,2015-08-19,26158658,Rachel,Debbie was a fantastic host. She left thoughtful recommendations and the apartment has everything a hotel can offer plus more! We loved the neighborhood and downtown was a short uber or light rail ride away. I'd highly recommend this for a Seattle visit!
2721575,43652051,2015-08-21,38608081,Terri,"My daughter and I stayed two nights at Debbie's apartment in Columbia City (Seattle) Washington.  The apartment was clean and very comfortable, especially the king mattress!  We spent most of our time in downtown Seattle sightseeing but also discovered breakfast ---coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants--- were definitely a short walk away.  Debbie was excellent in keeping me informed prior to my stay and making herself accessible by text should we have questions.  I would highly recommend the apartment!"
2721575,44445911,2015-08-26,39471829,Nick,"The place was great, the city is awesome, and the weather was perfect!  The location and cleanliness of the apartment was the best part.  It's a very nice and cozy spot perfect for a couple.  Me and my wife really enjoyed the place and the provided toiletries and chocolates were a plus!  Didn't get to meet Debbie because of how busy me and my wife were but we were in contact with her the entire time.  She would respond within minutes and is very polite!  Would love to stay here again if we take another Seattle trip.
Thanks Debbie!!"
2721575,44902935,2015-08-30,840919,Lauren,"My sister and I stayed at Debbie's apartment for a long weekend trip to Seattle.  We spent most of our time out and about exploring but the apartment was well situated for our trip. It has all the amenities, very spacious, and nicely decorated. It's just a few blocks from shops and restaurants in Columbia City, the light rail, and an awesome market called the PCC. Debbie was easy to contact via text and made sure that we were settled. We had a wonderful time!"
2721575,45947547,2015-09-07,35195177,Melisa,"Debbie was great!  I only met her once, and she was very nice (again sorry for my friend waking up so early).  She was very attentive and kept in touch during our stay to make sure we were ok.  The neighborhood was great, close to restaurants and grocery stores.  The area is very quiet.  I am keeping this listing contact information for future trips."

2721575,47733721,2015-09-21,41581804,Nadine Maria,"Staying at Debbie's place was wonderful. Location very convenient, walking distance to shopping and restaurants and very close to downtown.  Debbie made us feel very welcome and promptly responded to any questions or concerns. Columbia City is a great place to be, very diverse.  If we visit again, we will definitely stay at Debbie's place.
"
2721575,48510922,2015-09-27,19856952,Beverly,"We have stayed with Debbie several times. We sleep so well when we stay there! The bed is comfy and the neighborhood is very quiet. It's an easy walk to the light rail and also to our favorite restaurant, Geraldine's. Debbie is very pleasant and lovely to work with. We look forward to our next stay with her."
2721575,48954460,2015-09-29,28833678,Kelsey,"My best friend and I took a road trip to Seattle, and we couldn't have been happier with the accommodations! After a long day of driving we were so happy to be welcomed with hot tea, Pellegrino, and a room full of dvd's and great books. The apartment was beautiful and comfy; the size was much larger than expected. 

I will say, however, that while the apartment was perfect height for both me and my friend (we are 5'2""), the ceilings are really low and would most likely be problematic (and/or claustrophobic) for anyone over 5'8"". 

I would 100% recommend this listing to anyone staying in Seattle!

2721575,49113352,2015-10-01,20632032,Richard,"Awesome place to stay! Very accommodating and very clean! We would definitely stay here again. Debbie was a great host!

2721575,49897372,2015-10-07,3404314,Cindy,We had a great time at Debbie's apartment. It was super clean and neat and had everything we needed-including yummy artisan chocolates waiting for us on our arrival. The apartment itself is charming and comfortable. Debbie is very organized. She contacted us by text message prior to our arrival with check in information and again the evening before we left-offering us a later checkout time. The neighborhood is great (and convenient to public transportation). We had a rental car on this trip and street parking was always available in front of the apartment. We will definitely stay at Debbie's again-although I suspect we will have to book well in advance as word gets out that this is a great place to stay!
2721575,51127245,2015-10-18,41478245,Bradley,"Debbie was very warm, friendly, and welcoming. She went above and beyond. The apartment was beautifully decorated, spacious and clean. There was a welcome binder with local shops listed and restaurant menus  so we could better experience Columbia City.  Debbie accommodated us flying in the afternoon with the code and how to park since she could not be there right when we arrived. We were able to meet her our first day. Debbie was so sweet and helped us find a place for dinner. She was available via text if we needed anything like Seattle suggestions to B&B needs. We were very comfortable with blankets and towels, etc. The apartment had a full kitchen and everything we needed for cooking too. This was the best first Air B&B experience!"
2721575,53977026,2015-11-15,654094,Lilie,"the apartment was clean, comfortable, and very nicely furnished! we only stayed for two nights but would happily have stayed longer in comfort. i slept incredibly well on the bed. i also loved how the host thoughtfully provided whole coffee beans and a grinder to go with the french press. thank you debbie!

2721575,54631819,2015-11-22,5140497,Kimiko,"It was a fantastic location for what we had planned...very convenient to park the car in the off-street parking spot, walk down to the 'village' of Columbia City and have a meal, go shopping, and check out the music at Columbia City Theater and the Royal Room. The apartment was clean and tatefully decorated, the kitchen was stocked with coffee, and the bed was super comfortable! The ceilings are definitely low and there isn't a lot of window action so you do feel like you're in a basement suite but the location and the comfy bed make up for that. "
2721575,55362594,2015-12-01,21541577,Jolene,"

We didn't have the pleasure of meeting our host, but she was in close communication and even offered us a late checkout. The king-size bed was excellent sleeping, the kitchen and bathroom included all the necessities and many extra niceties, and there was a generous closet in the bedroom. Her color choices and art objects were well chosen and enjoyable without being intrusive. Our stay was peaceful and quiet with complete privacy, though Debbie was right upstairs. We have already booked a second stay!"
2721575,57633625,2015-12-28,16188710,Barbara,"Debbie stayed in touch w/me all along the way...when booking and during our stay.  To sum the experience up, Debbie goes above & beyond.  We love staying at her place....all the amenities are as advertised:  roomy, comfortable, a very comfortable bed (I wish were my own!), full kitchen, tv, and so forth.  Thank you, Debbie ~ you've taken our initial hesitation out of the mix.  The entire process and stay...seamless and terrific!

1601714,7524923,2013-09-23,4651371,Neil,"Michael's apartment was just as pictured and described. He thoughtfully picked up some wine and fruit for me - not to mention the airport pick-up! The place was clean, very comfortable, in a perfect location and the views were stunning. There is a little road noise, but I enjoyed the hum of it. It was definitely a great experience, and Michael is a great guy. The next week, when I was on the opposite coast in a city he used to live in, he gave me tons of travel tips for there too! It's these kinds of people & places that make airbnb great!"
1601714,7686630,2013-09-29,5641067,Lauren,We booked last minute after our original booking feel through. Michael was incredible helpful and accommodating considering we literally booked the night before. He met us at the apartment gave as a quick tour and some advice on restaurant and places to go. Couldn't have asked for a better location to stay. 
1601714,7924354,2013-10-08,7431236,Augustin,"Michael's apartment was convenient and comfortable. He was a great host--flexible about my arrival time and checked in to make sure everything was working out at the start of my stay. Plus, the view from his balcony is pretty great. It's a short walk to Capitol Hill or to Belltown from this location.

Bed was comfortable (especially the pillows), city noise was not bad even though it's near a highway, and kitchen had everything I needed to cook meals for the week. My only frustration was that the place wasn't super clean, though some cleaning had been done prior to my arrival."
1601714,8096298,2013-10-15,8207909,Laura,"This apartment is located conveniently within a 15-min walk from Capitol Hill's restaurant area and also conveniently located to visit Seattle downtown.  It has a clean view to downtown and the Space Needle, and has good privacy with no neighboring buildings across from its windows.  The street itself is not the nicest in the neighborhood and there is quite loud road noise from the highway below.  Michael was quick to respond and flexible with a time arrangement to meet and hand over the apartment, and also very flexible for key hand-out after our stay.  He was also very kind in recommending places to eat at and visit in Seattle, and in showing the apartment so we could find everything and feel comfortable with the high-tech goodies he has if we wanted to use them (XBox, DVD player, etc).  Note that this is Michael's apartment, where he lives regularly but which he leaves temporarily when receiving guests.  Michael has furnished and decorated the apartment with a very nice taste.  The apartment, though, could have been cleaned a little better before our visit."
1601714,8158120,2013-10-18,8047294,John,"I traveled to Seattle for a conference - Michael and I exchanged correspondence about his apartment several times.  Throughout that process, Michael generally responded within minutes to hours.

Once I arrived, Michael had prepared a list of possible sites and restaurants to visit in his neighborhood - totally unnecessary, but very much appreciated.

The space is exactly as billed - one bedroom, fully stalked kitchen, and very comfortable living and dining areas.  The technology in his apartment was more than adequate.

Finally, Michael was polite, amiable, respectful and considerate - I would recommend his place to all family and friends."
1601714,8242951,2013-10-21,1508512,Nicola,Michael was a great host. He had a great apartment and gave us very thoughtful tips of things to see and do in Seattle since it was our first visit. The location and neighborhood were fantastic as well. 
1601714,8391387,2013-10-28,9472594,George,"I too traveled to Seattle for a conference, a short 15 min walk from the apartment.  As mentioned before, Michael easy to communicate with - usually within minutes. He was able to accommodate my late arrival and even brought me for a late dinner, and had a bottle of wine as a gift!!.  His apartment is exactly as described and seen in the pictures. Michael was a perfect host, his apartment was quiet despite the proximity to the highway, with nice views of downtown (when you get a view due to the fog...). The neighborhood has some GREAT food (Michael's pointers helped a lot). This was my first AirBnB experience and I would highly recommend Michael's place."
1601714,8662133,2013-11-11,9373008,Liz,"This was my 1st experience using airbnb for myself, although my husband and children use airbnb for traveling/family vacations. I wanted a private, furnished space, near my daughter's apt. on Capitol Hill and I found what I wanted. Michael's condo was exactly as described/pictured on the website, no surprises. I live in a small mid-western community, am a middle-class retired professional and wanted to spend a week or so in this very busy, urban area with my daughter, but we both need our own ""space and time"", i.e., privacy. I was amazed and pleased with the whole experience. Michael returned messages quicker than I could with easy answers or explanations. The location turned out to be about 1/2 block away from my daughter, which made everything more convenient and within easy walking distance. I was ready to reserve a motel room until I found this venue and thought his price was more than fair, as everything was provided and ready to go. I had not seen more than the 1st and 2nd reviews of Michael's condo, and I think you should know that cleanliness was NOT an issue. I'm kind of a ""germaphobe"", so if there was a problem, it's been resolved! My daughter had seen two later reviews re: cleanliness, but didn't tell me until we both saw the condo. She apparently had ""antennae"" working overtime and I heard a huge sigh as she walked a few steps ahead. She turned around with obvious relief, said to me, ""I was so worried, Mom, and this is very clean..."" and I had no idea what she was talking about! I had some questions about the space/use of items and Michael was readily available. He offered  transportation to or from the airport, left a list with neighborhood restaurants and coffee shops. I found Michael and the whole experience very welcoming and friendly. I hope to rent his condo again. Thanks, Michael...."
1601714,8789989,2013-11-18,6449375,Tana,"If you are looking for a perfect spot to stay in Seattle, I doubt you could find a better view, location, accomodation, or overall experience than Michael's apartment in Capitol Hill. He was a fantastic and thoughtful host, even picking me up from the airport and leaving a bottle of his favorite bubbly and he has a seemingly endless list of ideas for first time visitors!

The rate was very reasonable especially considering the apartment included an adorable balcony with views of the Space Needle, Queen Anne, and the Olympic Mountain Range (weather permiting!). 

I stayed for 4 nights in mid-November and was able to walk everywhere I wanted to visit - but public transporation was also very close. The apartment was spotless and had everything that I needed to make breakfasts/lunches so I could splurge at dinner. That said, there are many restaurants and trendy spots just a few blocks away. OH! And if you have a 24 Hour Fitnness membership there is a great gym close by as well. 

I hope to find myself back in the Emerald City in the future and I would most definitely stay at Michael's Capitol Hill apartment again. "
1601714,9331988,2013-12-22,8962701,Sean,"I absolutely loved staying here! The apartment was beautiful, in a great location, and full of awesome amenities. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood, with excellent restaurants, and close to lots of good place to shop as well. Michael and Miranda were both helpful and responsive and just two of the friendliest people ever. I needed a place for a month and this more than met my expectations. Highly recommend staying here if you can!"
1601714,9393997,2013-12-26,9987495,Mark,"Hi,
Michael and Miranda's place was perfect for our visit to Seattle.   Not far from friends in the Capitol Hill area and close to bus lines to get us to where we needed to go.   Seattle is hilly...really hilly and the place is on the incline so if your walking be ready.   But once your up in Cap Hill area its fine or down in the city.  The place had everything we needed.  And when the electronics were a little be confusing Michael was a phone call away.  The only draw back was the constant noise from I-5 just below.  But once you put on some music or something it was fine.  And the bed room is away from the highway.   Finally.....the view is spectacular.  Thanks again."
1601714,9546241,2014-01-02,8307086,Kristen,"There were a lot of firsts on this trip for my boyfriend and me: first vacation together, first time in Seattle, first New Year's celebration together, and (my) first time using airbnb. With that said, I could not have asked for a better first experience or a warmer welcome to the city. Michael and Miranda's hosting skills and the apartment itself are just what the doctor ordered when you want a relaxing visit to Seattle. Michael was kind enough to pick us up from the airport and show us around the apartment, where we found wine, champagne, chocolates, and even toiletries (e.g., shampoo, body wash, and toothpaste). Michael was also very helpful in providing a list of places to go/things to do in Seattle.  While we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Miranda, she was great about checking in with us to see how we liked the apartment and how things were going. As for the apartment: it was very clean, cozy, and quiet; the furniture was very comfortable; and we had a great view for watching the fireworks on the Space Needle from the living room.  There were so many things to do both in and outside of the apartment, our stay simply wasn't long enough! "
1601714,9691616,2014-01-05,3770121,Brian,The apartment was awesome. Great view of downtown Seattle with the Space Needle. Loved the keyboard. We found some really cool bars within walking distance in Capitol Hill and in general really enjoyed our stay in Seattle!
1601714,9877599,2014-01-16,8015092,Garrett,"Great Location. 10 minute walk to Downtown, the Space Needle, and even Pike market. The room was clean and had everything we could need. Definitely recommend"
1601714,10296823,2014-02-11,11371024,Katie,"I cannot say enough great things about Michael and Miranda! They were wonderful and super helpful. The apartment was clean, and in a great location close to downtown, and Capitol Hill, with amazing views of the Space Needle. We will be staying here again; I would highly recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle. "
1601714,10369729,2014-02-16,11835023,Jackie,"Michael and Miranda were both very responsive to inquiries prior to arrival. On the day of check-in, Miranda met me to give me the keys and made sure that I was comfortable before leaving. The place was great. Only downside was that the couch is a loveseat and not a full-length couch, so make sure you are comfortable sharing a bed with the other person staying with you! (Luckily for me I was, but I could see that being awkward for others.) The view was great and the noise from I-5 was very easy to tune out. Overall, a great stay!"
1601714,10510720,2014-02-23,7810863,Brent,"This was a truly seamless experience from start to finish. Michael and Miranda were very gracious hosts. They picked me up at the airport and quickly answered any questions I had. The apartment was better than expected. It was clean and comfortable. The kitchen was well stocked. The view from the apartment is very nice to come home to. I was in town for a conference at the Washington State Convention Center. The walk took about 10-12 minutes through a nice neighborhood. I always felt safe walking through the neighborhood (Melrose to Pike). I would recommend The Pine Box for food and drinks (Melrose and Pine). I agree with other reviewers that the traffic noise from I-5 is palpable, but the bedroom is quiet. The traffic noise certainly did not keep me from enjoying a drink on the balcony in the evening and is typical of city life. I highly recommend this space to anyone visiting Seattle for work or otherwise. Cheers, Brent"
1601714,10654807,2014-03-02,10273476,Christina,"Miranda and Michael's place was an absolute dream; the view was spectacular. Not only did they leave us a bottle of champagne and chocolates, but also the apartment was incredibly comfortable for 3 of us. Beyond that, Miranda is so nice and was available late one night when I lost the key! We are so thankful that they were both humane and lovely. Next time I'm in Seattle, I will definitely see if this apartment is available."
1601714,10980776,2014-03-16,11682685,Milos,"Miranda and Michael were great hosts. The apartment was very clean and tidy and they also provided another cleaning after a week into our stay. Very well furnished, with high speed internet and a huge flatscreen TV. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a nice place on Capitol Hill!

The location is just excellent - seconds from I-5, meaning it takes just a couple of minutes to get out of Seattle"
1601714,11168566,2014-03-24,779357,Jasmine,"Michael and Miranda's apartment was great--it was a 15 minute walk to our conference at the Sheraton downtown, and a 10 minute walk to dozens of wonderful bars and restaurants in the Capitol Hill area. There are four James Beard award winning restaurants within walking distance of the place. We also had breakfast at two of Seattle's top-rated brunch places, also within a short walk of the apartment. Pike Place market and the other, more touristy places on the water are within a 30-minute walk. 
The apartment's view is incredible. We'd wake up and drink coffee while looking at snow-capped mountains and the space needle. 
There were two of us, so we switched off between the bedroom and using an air mattress in the living room. It wasn't like a typical air mattress that leaves you sinking to the floor, it was a really huge, high quality number that was more like an actual bed. There's a little street noise (cars) if you're sleeping in the living room, which didn't bother my friend, and I just used a white noise app on my phone and it was fine. The bed in the bedroom was great--very comfortable. That room is virtually silent. 
Miranda was very easy to get in touch with. She met us at the apartment and had a bottle of champagne, chocolates, and maps/brochures for us. She welcomed us to get in touch over the weekend if we needed anything. Overall, it was a great place to stay--comfortable and tidy, great location, and a spectacular view. "
1601714,11680088,2014-04-12,11102496,Romain,"We had a great stay in Seattle at Michael & Miranda's place. The location is great, within a walking distance from downtown and Capitol Hill (a great place to have fun), the appartment is very comfortable, and the view on the Space Needle and the moutains is just wonderful. We were three friends sharing the place, some of us slept on the air matress, which is very comfortable (it is a real bed actually). Sleeping in the living room can be a little noisy, due to the i5 which just under the appartment, but sleeping in the room is very calm. Miranda was so nice and so easy to catch, I would highly recommand this place!"
1601714,11961452,2014-04-20,7763068,Sarah,"Michael and Miranda were great hosts and the apartment was perfect! Both Michael and Miranda were quick to respond to all our emails/calls/texts and were always kind and thoughtful. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed/wanted. We loved having a balcony and being able to see the Space Needle, especially at night. It was an easy walk to downtown shopping and the market: not too long and the hill was not too steep. We would absolutely rent from M&M again. Thank you so much for everything."
1601714,12243126,2014-04-27,1301548,Kraig,"The communication with Miranda was excellent and easy.  She met me with the keys to the place.  I had come for a convention that was taking place in downtown.  Had I stayed downtown, I would have missed the chance to explore a bit of Capitol Hill.  There are a couple of great bars just down the block.  The place was clean and they provided an airmattress for my visitor. 

Thanks guys!"
1601714,12695899,2014-05-08,11744438,Colleen,"Nice little place, clean and comfortable, about a 20 minute downhill walk over the freeway from Pike's Place Market and the ferry terminals to one side, and maybe 5 minutes from the main streets of Capitol Hill to the other side. We agreed with previous posters that the noise from the freeway didn't bother us in the bedroom at all. 

We had a tough start, with a last minute change in the key exchange plan that involved us carrying our luggage around to a random other building at about 11pm at night before we could actually get in to the apartment; we never actually saw our hosts. But generally everything worked fine. No chocolates or champagne for us, but (more importantly!) two working umbrellas placed strategically by the door! We would certainly stay there again."
1601714,13077814,2014-05-19,655631,Johnny,"Miranda met us at the apt and showed us around.  She asked us before we arrived if we had any special needs or request.  We neglected to bring shampoo; she went out of her way to run out to local market and grab us some soap and shampoo for the 3 days we stayed there.

The apt location is awesome.  Its located 15 min walk to downtown and its only a few blocks from a lot of restaurant and bars."
1601714,13403702,2014-05-27,12197331,Kyle,Great hosts! We would gladly come back anytime in the future!
1601714,13617017,2014-06-01,14789544,Andrea,"Miranda is a lovely and very attentive host. The apartment itself is quite nice and clean, and the kitchen has everything you need to cook. It is centrally located and walking-distance to lots of sites. The apartment feels new, but the building is a bit run down. As others have noted it also sits on top of the 5 freeway. The nice thing about this is that there is a marvelous view of the city. On the downside, you can hear the freeway from the living/dining room (but not the bedroom). It didn't bother me as long as we kept the balcony doors closed, but you do hear a constant zoom. "
1601714,13813587,2014-06-05,11869021,Justin,"The hosts were great, and made the stay a good experience.  Mike hooked me up with a credit on Uber as an option to walking.  The place was what I had expected, I just needed a place to crash (but many amenities like a kitchen were available) and booking this helped me stay within my company's travel budget. It was about a mile to downtown (20 min walk) where I was attending a convention at the Sheraton.  I ate at a few local restaurants in Cap Hill, which were close by.  I liked the rooftop seating at Terra Plata where I had the water buffalo burger - really good!"
1601714,13921817,2014-06-08,2037588,Stacy,Great place to stay in capital hill. Miranda was one of the most helpful hosts we've experienced while using airbnb. She was also quick to answer any questions we had and checked in with us frequently. We did have one little issue with the free parking space advertised. It's really just street parking and if your trying to find a spot on a Friday night... Well let's just say it took us an over an hour circling the block before we decided to bite the bullet and pay for parking 5 blocks away. Other than that the place was great. Would recommend!
1601714,15306363,2014-07-07,12742799,Winnie,"Miranda was wonderful in answering all my questions prior to the stay. I didn't get a chance to meet her personally since she was out of town at the time I was staying at their listing. However, their friend, Bobby, was there to help us. Bobby was absolutely wonderful and really friendly! He was very sweet to wait for us to hand us the key to the apartment when we arrived, and he also helped us with our bags to our car when we left.

The neighborhood was nice. It was pretty quiet. We live in the city so the highway noise does not bother us. The neighbors were great. We accidentally lost our baby bags and one of their neighbors found them and return them to us."
1601714,15745220,2014-07-15,1420924,Danny,"The place was great, lots of space and a wonderful kitchen. Fairly close to downtown and Broadway so walking to key sites around town was extremely convenient. There was no air conditioning so it got a little warm at times, but there were plenty of fans around the apartment to keep the air moving and keep it cool at night. This place is great and the check-in/check-out process was extremely easy. Miranda and Mike are VERY accommodating and were great to work with on this rental. Highly recommend! "
1601714,15918673,2014-07-18,91583,Roman,"Miranda was out of the country, and her friend checked us in. We had to wait extra 20 minutes for him to get there; but I'd attribute that to traffic. He was very nice, and made us feel welcome.

The neighborhood is great, and just a short walk to downtown Seattle. The view of Space Needle out of the window is great as well. You can hear the traffic if you keep the balcony door open, but it's pretty quiet with the door closed.

I'd definitely stay here again.

Thanks Miranda and Bobby."
1601714,16053844,2014-07-21,12163418,Devin,"Miranda & Mike were out of the country when my brother & I stayed, however they made arrangements with their friend Bobby to take care of us. Everything went very smoothly - communication with Bobby was great! The apartment was in an awesome location with an excellent view of downtown and the stratosphere. It was really nice staying in an apartment vs. a hotel for many reasons - the small things really do matter. This was my first airbnb experience and it was excellent! I highly recommend booking with Miranda & Mike if you want a guaranteed stay!
