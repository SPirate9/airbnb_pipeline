Didn't get to meet M&K but they have perfect instructions upon arrival and assured us that we could contact them for any issues. Luckily our trip was smooth and we had no problems whatsoever. The only thing I missed... Was a television. Overall, had a great time."
4084712,39207030,2015-07-21,16375437,Alyshia,"Their apartment was the cheapest and cutest place I could find for my summer trip and it was well worth it!

The place itself is very cute, as represented in the pictures. Adorable decorations, extremely comfortable beds, and thoughtful accommodations/tips. 

The surrounding neighborhood isn't the cutest place, but it's not terrible either. 

It was a quick 10 minute drive to pikes place (the public market) and a quick 5 minute drive to the night life in capital hill. "
4084712,40126206,2015-07-28,4142274,Jackie,"We had a great time here, the house was exactly as pictured, beds were super comfy and location was fantastic, downtown was easily accessible. M&K had a wonderful list of recommendations and if you know what's good for you, you'll check out the twice baked chocolate croissant. Would definitely stay here again."
4084712,40865377,2015-08-02,20273734,Doris,"Everything was perfect! We experienced a very easy-going and helpful way of communication with the hosts. The apartment is incredibly cute, enough space for us 4, and the beds are very comfi. The decoration style is just amazing and made us feel home from the beginning. The connection to downtown was only 10-15 mins. We highly recommend this place for a stay in Seattle! :)"
4084712,41107127,2015-08-04,36498788,Shiv,"The place was exactly as described in the pictures and was in a good location.  Also, the beds were very comfortable."
4084712,42151966,2015-08-11,347586,Monica,"Four of us had a wonderful stay at M&K's place in Seattle.  The place was clean and well-organized; it was easy to find everything we needed. We especially loved the shower with the stand-alone clawfoot tub and all the cute accessories decorating the place.

We spent our weekend in Seattle in the southern part of the city, so for us the location was perfect: a 45 minute walk or 10 minute Uber/Lyft ride from Capitol Hill. And there were lots of cute coffee shops and great Vietnamese restaurants within walking distance. M&K kindly provided a list of recommendations that we took advantage of.

Check-in and check-out process were easy. We appreciate efforts to keep costs down while maintaining a clean, welcoming environment.

Thanks for hosting us! :)"
4084712,42420058,2015-08-13,37783340,Anne,"Had a great stay and really enjoyed our time here. The place was exactly as described. It was easy to get downtown, either by walking (about 20 mins) or by taxi. Checking in, checking out as well as parking were all very straightforward."
4084712,43279907,2015-08-18,23784084,Jessie,A great place to stay! Really love the decorations inside of the house!
4084712,44315249,2015-08-25,20976155,Katie,"This was my first time using AirBnB and it did not disappoint! Cute place, great neighborhood, and extremely close to everything you want to go see and do in Seattle. M&K were extremely communicative beforehand, and it was a super easy stay. Comfortable beds and a great vibe in the house! Would definitely recommend."
4084712,44808779,2015-08-29,125820,Kate,"Clean and well-decorated. Soft mattresses. Large kitchen area with natural light. I appreciated the details: cotton sheets, filtered water with glasses in the bedrooms, local restaurant guides. Wifi worked perfectly. "
4084712,45263943,2015-09-01,35860494,Diana,"This place was just as the pictures show. The beds were comfortable, and all 3 of us really enjoyed showering in the clawfoot tub (separately haha). The location was just ok, however. We walked to the downtown area on the first night, and let's just say it wasn't a very scenic route. Besides that, we enjoyed our stay and appreciated how much we got for our money."
4084712,46141438,2015-09-08,38380488,Bradley,"The listing description and the picture perfectly represented the charm and quaint atmosphere of the place. The hosts were exceptionally available in case any issue arose (none did of course). Leading up to and proceeding our stay I repeatedly had good and quick responses to my questions. The attention to details was noticeable and very welcomed; from the French press coffee, to the towels and linens, and the availability of a washer and dryer on site. "
4084712,47047969,2015-09-15,3385985,Devangi,The house was all we needed. A very cute and comfortable home. It's conveniently located and plenty of street parking. 
4084712,47285302,2015-09-17,12941953,Tracy,Quaint and cozy is a perfect description of this place. The neighborhood was very quiet and accessible from all the major freeways... a big plus! We had no issues with street parking. Did not ever meet the host but she always responded quickly via text. The beds are comfy and the space looked like it came straight out of an Urban Outfitters catalog! Would definitely stay again.
4084712,47866924,2015-09-21,9173196,Constance,"The hosts left a key in the lockbox and I never met them. The house is an adorable anachronism in a neighborhood of colorful neo urban apartments near the international district. Easy to find, not always easy to park in front of. We loved the funky old house (built in 1903?!) and felt right at home there. I was able to bake my daughter an awesome cake for her thirtieth birthday celebration thanks to the spacious well equipped (but definitely vintage) kitchen. I also enjoyed the claw foot tub! Comfortable bed, and I made good use of the washer and dryer too. I'd definitely stay there again and recommend it to friends as well."
4084712,47980642,2015-09-22,40144891,Rachael,"We had a lovely time in Seattle. M&K's place was great for us - really spacious, very tidy, big kitchen, lots of linen, great washer and dryer, and not far from public transport. They were amazing with communication and were really generous with our check-out flexibility! There's a super helpful 'guest guide' on the kitchen table when you arrive, with all the information you need on the house, and the local area, and things to do in Seattle. We tried a couple of the eating recommendations and they were great! "
4084712,48210293,2015-09-24,1572237,Sharon,"Very sweet place with cozy beds! Lots of clean towels. Good communication before arrival. Easy check-in and check-out, clear house instructions left on the table. The only small problem was that there was a bit of an animal smell that came in with the windows open, but the house itself was very clean and well-kept. (One of my friends is allergic to cats and didn't have any reaction, so I'm sure it was from outside.) Thanks M&K! Totally recommended."
4084712,48906983,2015-09-29,21788552,Andrea,"It was my first time using airbnb, house was great, we had no issues. Thanks for hosting us!"
4084712,49822408,2015-10-06,25104642,Long,"The location is good, 10mins drive away China town, save your time if you want stay around Seattle downtown. "
4084712,51446940,2015-10-20,33159643,Celise,"My stay here was wonderful. Kara and Michele were easy to communicate with and always quick to respond. They even helped recommend some nice spas for me and my girlfriend to check out! The house fit me, my boyfriend and another couple very comfortably. We loved the way the house was decorated. Would definitely come back here. Thank you for hosting us! "
4084712,52252825,2015-10-27,45691506,Jessica,We arrived pretty late after communicating with M&K and found our arrival very smooth. The neighborhood was quiet and the downstairs neighbor was never actually seen. M&K were very flexible especially with last minute needs and we didn't find anything that could change. I can speak for all of us and say that if this place is available next time we're in town we would definitely prefer to stay here. 
4084712,54272034,2015-11-17,18700806,Jose,"House is great with lots of clean towels, comfortably fit 4 guests in two beds. Great location and Kara was quick to respond to any questions. Great stay."
4084712,54898785,2015-11-25,46501033,Kevin,"The house was great, exactly how it was  described. Easy communication with the owners. Really appreciated them leaving a list of local places to eat broken down by price."
4084712,56059851,2015-12-08,9716294,Stephanie,Great little house. Spacious and just as the pictures showed. Easy to get around the city by car. Would recommend. 
4084712,57156632,2015-12-22,9875976,Aram,"Nice little bungalow, well situated near stuff. Easy parking out front. Easily sleeps 5. Good kitchen. A little traffic noise/light in the back of the house, a little chilly in the front bedroom. Otherwise awesome. "
1392332,6091116,2013-07-29,7607460,Laurel,"Wow, if you are in the Seattle area..you must try to stay at the ""Modern-Eco-Friendly Retreat"".  Beautiful views, amazing house, super hosts....can't say enough about this place. Holly has everything organized to make your stay as worry-free as possible. The house is so spectacular, that it's hard to leave and sight-see.  Amazing Sonos Sound System, breathtaking views, great neighborhood for walking, books galore. When we head back to the Northwest, we will definitely contact Holly again. "
1392332,6285288,2013-08-06,1424549,Will,"We had an amazing time in Seattle. Early August is definitely the perfect time to visit there. Holly's house in Queen Ann is pretty awesome. It is modern, very comfortable, and clean. And you can't beat the view. The balcony is so relaxing and the neighborhood is very convenient and super safe."
1392332,6434395,2013-08-12,7651521,Jean,Everything about this house is perfect! Hoping to need to be back in Seattle again for an extended trip so we could rent it again:)
1392332,6573680,2013-08-17,6764611,Geoff,"This place is absolutely beautiful.  From the amazing views to the fantastic taste and attention to detail in the architecture, electronics, and furnishings, to our wonderful host it was an amazing stay for us and I very much hope to return."
1392332,7221953,2013-09-11,7723608,Elizabeth,"Not sure of all the superlatives that I can use to describe this wonderfully lovely home...gorgeously designed, beautifully furnished, ridiculously convenient to all parts of the city by several bus lines or a short walk away from the funky shops and yummy restaurants in Upper Queen Anne!  Sitting with a cup of coffee in the mornings, with the trees next to the patio filled with chirping birds, was such a perfectly peaceful way to start the day...and in the evenings taking in the sunset over the bay and the mountains from the vantage point of the hot tub was beyond tranquil. And Holly was the perfect host...providing all the information we needed to set up house when we got there and available throughout our stay when we needed to ask questions.  One of my most positive travel experiences ever.  Really feel so grateful to have had the experience to stay in this gorgeous home thanks to this gracious host.  Thank you, thank you!"
1392332,7468959,2013-09-21,8406970,Douglas,"The Modern Eco-Retreat in the quiet Queen Anne neighborhood of Seattle boasts more than just a terrific view... Holly's place is a home away from home with every amenity and household feature an example of mindful and sustainable living. My wife and I are ready to build a replica of this perfect retreat! As the owner of such an ideal dwelling, Holly is a thoughtful and attentive host, offering helpful advice that made our experience even more memorable.  If we're lucky enough to make a return visit to the area, I can't imagine staying anywhere else!"
1392332,7564335,2013-09-24,4048305,Lulu,"Holly's place is fantastic. The view is beautiful, and the area is quiet and so relaxing. The sound system is a very nice bonus to stimulate our senses. My family and I had a great time there. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. "
1392332,8099059,2013-10-15,451354,Jeremy,"Holly was super attentive and the house is just a dream!  Every amenity, hot tub, beautiful light and view. Just super comfy and a perfect getaway. It was fantastic "
1392332,8220643,2013-10-21,1632326,Ben,Holly has a beautiful home. There is simply nowhere else better to stay in Seattle. Wonderful.
1392332,8427403,2013-10-30,8516026,Mark,"Beautiful house in a lovely quiet neighborhood. Fantastic views from the main floor deck. Very nice home entertainment system. Modern kitchen with high end appliances. Loved the large upstairs windows that opened to the deck, and literally open up nearly the entire living space. Really only two things that didn't work for us. The mattresses in both bedrooms were just too firm for us. And the lack of window coverings in the bedrooms. We're light sleepers, and it just got too light too early in the bedrooms."
1392332,9968348,2014-01-21,11357869,Pouya,"A quick work retreat - we had a great trip, beautiful house made for many late evenings of our team wrapping up while watching a gorgeous sunset. A unique home, great design and a relaxing spot with all the amenities you need. "
1392332,11334896,2014-03-30,3936248,Jonpaul,We loved staying at Holly's beautiful home. The pictures don't do the place justice. We were all blown away at how great the design and decor of the home was. I wish we could have spent more time there but we were busy with work while in Seattle. I'll surely stay here again if I get the chance. Holly answered our questions within minutes of texting her. Highly recommend! 
1392332,11427576,2014-04-02,11425329,Julia,Staying at Holly 's beautiful home was an amazing experience.   It exceeded my expectations in every way.   So happy I found out about airbnb and found this listing.  It really made our vacation a memorable experience.  Our time there was way better than a hotel.  It real felt like home. Holly was great to deal with throughout the entire process. Rent this house ! You will not regret it.
1392332,11738120,2014-04-14,5254143,Lianna,"What a beautiful place to live and play. Holly's place was a dream - we couldn't get over the nanowall, that opens up to probably one of the best views in town. The kitchen was stocked with anything and everything you would need. Beds comfy. We spent a night in and it was more fun than our night out. Didn't want to leave in the morning. Thank you Holly!"
1392332,12348171,2014-04-29,3503519,Rebekah,"Although hesitant to tell everyone how awesome this place is, so we can visit again without hassle--three of us (and our two small dogs) stayed in this lovely home for 4 nights. We were all incredibly comfortable & impressed with the amenities, along with how ""at home"" we felt. Cozy yet open, great kitchen to cook in, the beautiful view, hot tub, sweet surround sound system, and comfortable beds...the place is perfect! The parking can be a drag, but we found it manageable. It is super close to whole food market and convenient to get downtown. Only a few miles from Discovery Park, which is one of the most beautiful Seattle parks! 
We will definitely be back to stay here again. Thank you, Holly! We feel lucky to have found you on airbnb..
"
1392332,12691148,2014-05-08,2301365,A.J.,"Holly's incredible Seattle residence located in Queen Anne is the perfect landing pad.  The home might as well be in the pages of Dwell magazine, and has a wonderful view of the Olympics and the Puget Sound.  Modern...yet comfy and cozy.  There is no doubt I will make this my regular spot when I travel to Seattle for business or pleasure.

Hands down the best element of the home is the accordion glass door that opens nearly the entire West facing wall.  Fresh Northwest air on perfect Springtime days!"
1392332,13417927,2014-05-27,12658101,Shelly,"
As soon as we walked in the door, we felt at home.  The decor was lovely.  The house spotless.  The view from the deck and hot tub, priceless.  Holly was a very respectful host and a good communicator.  Although we were in the area for busy wedding events, we looked forward to getting back to this oasis every evening.   The neighborhood is very quiet and lovely to stroll in on pursuit of coffee or food.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat and recommend it highly."
1392332,14148088,2014-06-13,13622086,Elizabeth,"This house was wonderful. It was very modern and very comfortable. Loved the well equipped kitchen and the balcony areas were great just to sit enjoy the view and relax.
The location was very convenient and only a very short walk to coffee shops and restaurants.
The hosts were also wonderfully accommodating.
I would highly recommend this eco-friendly retreat."
1392332,15248317,2014-07-06,9574849,Tristan,"My wife and I stayed at Holly's house for a week around July 4th and it couldn't have been better!  The location was perfect and the view was amazing! Holly was so nice and a great host! 
"
1392332,16075609,2014-07-22,13343133,Toshi,"Holly's Modern Eco-Friendly Retreat was just fantastic.  It is located in W. Queen Ann's quiet residential area, yet only a few minutes drive to downtown Seattle.  It's got most beautiful views overlooking Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains beyond.  The Nanowall opening to the upper deck from the dining room is unique and brings comfortable breeze into the house.  It's got a modern, well equipped, kitchen. It's got great sound system throughout the house. We even enjoyed watching freight trains and the commuter train (the Sounder?) from afar occasionally from the deck.  It's got a BBQ grill on the upper deck (yes, there is a lower deck, too) and a hot tub and an espresso machine in the kitchen, but we did not have chance to use any of them as we were too busy going on outings every day.  It was a wonderful place to come back to watch the sunset.
All in all, we were more than pleased to stay in this house for a week.  We would recommend this to anyone.  Toshi & Liesl Kii
"
1392332,16585868,2014-07-29,18410850,Lala,"I had a great time.  The house was perfect, the kitchen is well equipped.  I was able to find everything I needed because Holly had a house book with all the information.  "
1392332,17331717,2014-08-11,481203,Samir,"We stayed at Holly's house for a week and had a wonderful time. The view is even better than what you see in the photos, Holly was easily reachable by phone/email whenever we had questions, and the house had everything we needed for a fun and relaxing stay. It was easy to find parking for our rental car right outside and the house was close to grocery stores, coffee shops and other conveniences."
1392332,20373471,2014-09-28,6971200,Liz,"Beautiful place, super easy access. Very modern and unique and a great place for me to get ready for my wedding with the bridesmaids! Thanks for your flexibility and hospitality. "
1392332,21240354,2014-10-13,1474267,Douglas,"Holly's home was absolutely beautiful with a great view! Good central location that is really easy to get around between downtown, Ballard and Fremont. Easy and smooth check-in and check-out process. Very safe neighborhood."
1392332,22150951,2014-10-31,2817644,Christopher,"This is a truly amazing modernist house. Everything, from the views of boats and trains, to the selection of books, to the cozy fireplace and the hot tub on the deck in the rain, is very special. It really is an urban oasis.
Highly recommended to anyone wanting a treat. We will certainly be back."
1392332,22862552,2014-11-16,501739,Tony,"Holly's home is amazing and exactly as described. The views of the Olympic mountains and Puget Sound and nestled on a small street in Queen Anne. We couldn't be happier with our stay and are looking forward to coming back. It was quiet, beautiful and clean. And Holly was extremely quick to respond to all of our questions."
1392332,24412736,2014-12-28,19509236,Sean,"I rented this place for my family who was visiting us in Seattle for the holidays.  While it only slept 4 the 6 of us spent a lot of time hanging out, enjoying the view/music/movies, and eating together.  We were all big fans of this rental.  It came equipped with all sorts of enjoyable amenities including an espresso machine and aero press coffee, internet tv/radio with lots of music and movies, telescope to watch the passing ships, amazing hot tub, the list goes on.    The eco nature of this rental is no lie.  This is the only place I have ever stayed where the trash can was smaller than the recycling bin.

Two notes to be aware of.  1)The open nature of the space means there is not a lot of privacy.  Even with doors closed you can usually hear what is happening in other rooms.  2)The house lacks some common features like a microwave and standard coffee maker.  The lack is really a net positive because it caused us to slow down and take time to enjoy making coffee or cooking food together.  Not a big deal but if those are a must this might not be your kinda place.  

As for the hosts, Holly and Dave did a wonderful job to make us comfortable.  They were very accessible to address any questions we had leading up as well as during the reservation.    Great communication and support.  

I would have no hesitation to rent this place in the future or to recommend it to others.  "
1392332,25825803,2015-01-26,20573874,Victor,We had a wonderful experience and loved our time spent in the house. The upstairs was better than any ambiance the city could offer so we actually ended up staying in every night! The beauty of the house is definitely in the details and the hosts were accommodating and quick to respond. We're already looking forward to our return!
1392332,26970204,2015-02-22,28130727,Erin,The reservation was canceled 43 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1392332,27304214,2015-03-01,10278488,Jordan,"The house was great, very clean and designed very well. The giant open balcony doors really made it nice to enjoy the good weather as well as the hot tub for the cold evenings.
The house was full of everything you need, and Holly responded quickly from the start of my inquiry and whenever needed. It isn't the easiest to walk to and from anything but as long as you have a vehicle while you're staying in Seattle I would recommend staying here if you get the chance.
 "
1392332,27953300,2015-03-15,501739,Tony,This was our second stay at Holly's home and it was just as wonderful as the first. The neighborhood is great and the views are beautiful. Can't wait to come back. 
1392332,28628437,2015-03-27,13373144,目白隱宅 Mejiro Mansion,The view from the house is amazing! We were also able to enjoy nice music from the sound system here. Although the space is a bit small for a family.
1392332,29872202,2015-04-13,205570,Lindsay,The reservation was canceled 135 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1392332,30211668,2015-04-19,29124319,Craig,Fantastic View and a great space.  Great neighborhood. Easy access to everything. 
1392332,31857337,2015-05-10,21542051,Brandi,This place is nothing short of amazing! Best air bnb we have stayed at by far. Aside from being totally adorable the place wasn't treated with a bunch of chemical cleaners which was a huge perk for our partner and I as we have chem sensitivities. Parking really wasn't too bad. And the hot tub..... With that view? Awesome! We would def stay here again. 
1392332,32660552,2015-05-19,33431956,Lizzie,We loved this rental. We were in Seattle for an unfortunate medical issue and it was lovely to come back to this home after a stressful day. It's also beautifully decorated. I must have taken 20 pictures before we left! They welcomed our dog and made everything as easy as possible. We would definitely stay here again during our next trip!
1392332,33511143,2015-05-29,113743,Matt,"Everything was absolutely beautiful - of course the view... seriously, go for the view.  Moreover, the home was so well appointed and designed.  Everything was perfect - from the garden to the soaps, from the music system to the books and art.  The location is well in a great section of Queen Anne - it just couldn't be more perfect.

I've stayed at a number of AirBnB's.  Some feel like a staged rental and some feel like a home.  This definitely feels like a home.  If you are a senior or handicapped, this home is unlikely for you because of the stairs.   Be sure to get your food from Ken's Market up the street and there's a nice little cafe a short walk away.  Enjoy!"
1392332,34624217,2015-06-10,28592564,Vicki,"We truly enjoyed our week stay in this beautiful home! Sitting high upon a hill, we had wonderful views of the Olympic mountain range and Puget Sound through the sliding windows/doors that opened up almost the full width of the wall. The home is clean and comfortable, like being in our own home.  

Holly was a wonderful, accommodating hostess, and her home is well-supplied with the amenities necessary for our stay, including a washer and dryer, hot tub, grill, towels, shampoo, soap, etc.  We will definitely make this our place to stay when we visit Seattle in the future!"
1392332,36563736,2015-06-29,34476682,Chris,"Holly's home is a beautiful, modern jewel, and I don't think we could have found a nicer perch for a warm June weekend.  Everything was bright, airy, and beautifully detailed, but the view tops it all.  Holly was super responsive and accommodating.  I will have family stay again if it's available.

"
1392332,37856497,2015-07-11,651331,Chris,"Absolutely beautiful flat! Hot tub, lovely. Multiple decks, lovely. Well worth a stay if you're in Seattle."
1392332,40428980,2015-07-31,30535797,Frank,Everything went perfect and the home was warm clean & wonderful.
5941598,30433503,2015-04-21,271454,Katie,Lisa was a good communicator and very welcoming.  The cute house is next to a large park in a pleasant neighborhood.  Bonus to have a washer & dryer!

5941598,32591879,2015-05-19,21021421,Elijah,"Lisa has a great spot in West Seattle.  It was very convenient for our business trip.   The space is very homey and is right next to the Duwamish Greenbelt, which is some great hiking as well, had an opportunity to walk it early one morning. 

The house is very quiet with a huge yard!

Lisa was very accommodating and nice, it shows that she really cares about the house and your stay."
5941598,35092129,2015-06-15,31018434,Vanessa,Amazing time and great home for our stay in Seattle. Lisa made sure we had everything we needed. Had great spots to eat nearby and just a quick drive to all the fun Seattle activities. We highly recommend staying in this cute and cozy home:)
5941598,35582083,2015-06-20,7411429,Virginia,"The house was cute, comfortable and clean, on a quiet street across from a park. All necessities were provided, the kitchen was well-equipped and Lisa was quick to respond and available. The yard would have been perfect for our dog; really large and fenced."
5941598,35794056,2015-06-22,28769247,Ernie,Great house located right across the street from a large park. The kids loved the park. The neighborhood was quiet and easy walks or short drives to some fantastic restaurants. Felt right at home in this cozy house
5941598,36437666,2015-06-28,12852221,Stephanie,"Lisa was a great host and very accommodating during our stay! She was great with communicating with us before and during our trip. She even dropped by to give us a hairdryer and extra mirror. 

The house gets very hot (mornings & nights, we were out mostly during the day) and some of the windows didn't have screens, so we didn't want to have those open. The living room also doesn't have blinds in case you are having some of your guests sleeping out there. 

The neighborhood was quiet as described, but quite dark as we arrived at night and a bit far from downtown Seattle (~25+ min drive). We weren't really familiar with Seattle neighborhoods when booking the home, but would probably want to stay in a more well-lit area & closer to the city next time. "
5941598,37075285,2015-07-04,35242027,Alfredo,"Lisa was great about communicating.  We told her our window when we planned to arrive and depart and she was able to meet us.  She was very friendly and had simple directions to get downtown (only 15 minutes), the closest grocery store and gas station.  The kitchen was stocked with a pitcher of cold water, ice, coffee and seasoning for cooking.  We appreciated having a pet-friendly, clean, cozy house in a quiet, safe neighborhood that was perfect for a family of 4.  Our teens enjoyed their own beds and board games.  Our dog liked the fenced backyard and park trail across the street.  We enjoyed the back deck during the mornings and evenings.  Lisa also left us a fan since we were there in the middle of a heatwave.  I would recommend having a car when staying here.  "
5941598,37413635,2015-07-06,20250374,Megan,"The house is an adorable older home in a very quiet neighborhood. We loved our stay here and were thrilled we could bring our dog along for the trip! The backyard was awesome; it was large and fenced. Our dog loved exploring the yard and it made for a great space to play. We enjoyed sitting on the deck and drinking our coffee in the morning and local beer/wine at night. There is no A/C in the house so it did get warm. We were able to stay cool enough by opening the windows/doors in the morning and using the fan. We visited Alki Beach and the trendy Georgetown area, all a short drive from the house. We would recommend checking those out! Overall, we had a great stay and Lisa was the most helpful and accommodating host. She was very easy to get in touch with and answered any questions we had. "
5941598,37880865,2015-07-11,35822306,Leticia,"Lisa was warm and welcoming from the very beginning of our trip. She communicated with us by email, calls and by text. She was able to answer all of our questions about how to get around Seattle and even recommended places for us to visit and where to grab a bite to eat. 
The house is located across the street from a park where my sons were able to play basketball as my husband and I walked off dinner.  The house was well equipped with everything we needed and very clean.  The beds and pillows were extremely comfortable and something to look forward to after long days out and about. 
Thank you Lisa for providing us a great place  to stay!"
5941598,38277356,2015-07-14,12959428,Laura,"We enjoyed our short stay here. The house was large enough to accommodate four adults without making us feel like we were on top of each other, which I definitely appreciated! We also brought our dog, and she had a great time there as well. 

The location is a little bit away from the hubbub of the city life, as indicated in the description. It's really quick to get to downtown Seattle from the house though, and there's a lot to do in the West Seattle neighborhood anyway. The neighborhood seemed safe and opening the windows for a cool breeze worked well for us. 

With respect to the host, Lisa was very accommodating of our check-in/check-out times and went out of her way to ensure we had a great stay. She even offered to mail us our iPhone charger after we left! 

Bottom line is I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future!"
5941598,39033883,2015-07-20,23760679,Kelsey,"Lisa was fantastic. She kept up thorough and quick correspondence throughout the reservation, which was very helpful during our stay. The home was very cute and quaint/in a great neighborhood. I just loved it! Btw, the map doesn't make it seem so, but very quick drive to DT Seattle. Everywhere we needed to go was under a 10min drive. I ended up leaving two small items there, and Lisa graciously sent them back to my home (Thanks!). Overall, awesome little weekend trip. Having a home to stay in always makes a family weekend that much better. "
5941598,39444603,2015-07-23,19014474,Zhijiao,Nice home! quiet neighborhood. Love the big yard and it's really good for my Dog. He had a happy time there!
5941598,39762045,2015-07-26,110917,Erin & Vince,I'm an AirBnb host myself. We rented Lisa's cottage to house my extended family for a visit. Lisa and Beka made the check in process very easy.  Communication was great.  The place was very neat and clean.  It had everything my family needed. 
5941598,40923502,2015-08-03,23624535,Beth And Garrett,"Lisa was a great host and her home is lovely.  She was easy to communicate with, and left helpful house rules in the home.  The house was clean and comfortable with an amazing backyard for dogs or kids and very close proximity to a nice park with trails, playground, sport fields, etc.  A very nice home away from home!"
5941598,42473019,2015-08-13,40602089,Sam,"Great location, super clean! Host is really accommodating "
5941598,43186757,2015-08-17,40169052,Robert,"My partner Israel and two pups stayed at Lisa's place for a total of four days and it was nothing short of amazing. Very cozy clean and comfortable. Despite not ever physically meeting Lisa she was very accommodating and responsive through text. Staying at her place definitely allowed us to see Seattle in a whole new light, would highly recommend people stay here if want to feel like you have a home away from home. "
5941598,43578240,2015-08-20,10784019,Dairine,This appartment was super. Bus routes are regular and its not too far a drive from downtown. We got several cabs all under $20. Host were very generous and left some supplies and also assisted with reuniting me with my bankcard which I had left behind! Thanks again Lisa
5941598,44125095,2015-08-24,15324142,Karlee,"Lisa was great to communicate with, always quick to respond.  The house was very charming and just what we needed for a girls weekend.  We were in town for a wedding and it was nice to have three beds (two rooms) instead of sharing a hotel room.  The house is very close to downtown Seattle, 10min drive?  It is on quiet street in a cute neighborhood. Would definitely stay again."
5941598,44273128,2015-08-24,38402147,Carol,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5941598,45292755,2015-09-01,37776441,Jessica,"The house is a cozy, older bungalow in a very quiet neighborhood. Lisa and her partner were very communicative and quick to respond to our inquiries. We were there for the first storm of the season, which knocked out the power. Lisa graciously answered my rather late text about candles and flashlights. 

As others have said, it's a very quick drive to downtown (though I'd recommend someone with map skills or a GPS), it's also fairly close to Alki Beach.

The house is clean and well stocked, including a washer and dryer (which is key when travelling with a seven year old). 

Thank you for the wonderful stay Lisa! We will keep you in mind for future trips to Seattle. "
5164581,26270072,2015-02-08,17468680,Kate,"Luyao is a super sweet and attentive host. Her place is warm, clean, quiet, and very pleasant. I was very comfortable and had a terrific night's sleep. I look forward to staying at her place in magnolia again."
5164581,26377279,2015-02-10,6246499,Angela,The place was great for what we needed. Nice and simple. Luyao was very accommodating and friendly. Thanks for the stay! 
5164581,26713534,2015-02-17,27331146,Burkhard,"The host was friendly and helpful.
The room, bathroom/shower, and kitchen area were clean and had all I needed.
If you prefer to sleep with an open window (as I did) there will be some occasional sound carried from the railway line. Being a heavy sleeper, it did not bother me, but might bother a light sleeper. Closed window means quiet, however.
WiFi access fine.
Overall, recommended."
5164581,26805982,2015-02-19,20576297,Robert,I enjoyed my experince from when I got there to when I left. My hosts boyfriend who took care of everything I needed to know while at the 3 story home was very friendly and informative. I was able to take the 33 bus downtown which was only 2.25 each way and was only a couple hundred feet from the house. One street up the hill then !boom! there is the bus stop on to the left. I took full advantage of the beautiful trail that is very close to the home to walk back after my excursions to downtown Seattle each day. Great views of Sound and little parks along trail. Takes 1 1/2 hours to walk back to home from Seattle. Home was very clean and well organized for guests. Temperature was very comfortable. Long shag carpeting felt great between my toes in the bedroom. I slept well on the bed. Liked the provided Starbucks Vanilla K-Cups to get me going in the morning for my days adventures. Good food choices close by. Pizza!
5164581,27064265,2015-02-24,2824999,David,"Luyao was sweet, kind, and accommodating looks just like the pictures. Clean bathroom with soap and shampoo. Beautiful view. The air through the window smelled amazing. Cool neighborhood, cool condo. "
5164581,27185959,2015-02-27,27816934,Jims,"Luyao and company were great hosts. The house was clean and orderly.  They had tea available (cold or hot) all day.  Despite being a few blocks from a train yard, the house was pretty quiet while I was there.  The bed was the firmest I've slept on via AirBnB."
5164581,28561059,2015-03-26,26482179,Matt,"The hosts of the place were warm, kind, friendly; they kept the place very clean and organized, and they were readily available to answer any questions about the place as well as my stay there. I would definitely stay there again and I would recommend the place to anyone who is looking for a short or long term stay in the nice Magnolia neighborhood. "
5164581,28682603,2015-03-28,3120505,Bea & Henri,"Very nice and quiet couple. I had an issue with my car on arrival and Tao drove me to the closest mechanic to get help, it was really nice!!The house is clean and the bed very comfy. Perfect area to stay only 20 min from downtown by bus ! Nice neighborough. You have access to the kitchen for the meal when your host are not there. The host are a bit shy or may be just want to respect your privacy so don't except long talk, it can be a great thing if you want to relax or you are not talkative yourself ;) 
Finally I think the price is good for what you get!
I recommend this place"
5164581,28749290,2015-03-29,1978881,Chaucee,Luyao and her husband were great! The space was clean and they were very accommodating with our check-in time. This is a great place to stay in Seattle!
5164581,28839659,2015-03-30,29707261,Lavisha,"This was my first experience of airbnb and it could not have been better. Luyao and her husband were so understanding of almost any adjustment we made to our plans! We were there for just one night but I could see the immense changes they had made  to their entire house to make a guest feel comfortable for a long stay. I highly recommend their place, its clean, exactly like the posting and the neighbourhood is quite accessible from downtown even in late hours. We got back at 2am by bus and had no trouble getting home."
5164581,28966409,2015-04-01,286839,Louis,"Very welcoming, accurate description of a lovely home, nice neighbourhood with a bus to town every half hour or so."
5164581,29061741,2015-04-03,28132351,Fay,"I had a good stay at Luyao's place. She was flexible with my late arrival and was very friendly when I arrived. The room was spacious and brightly lit, with more closet space than I needed for a one night stay. "
5164581,29498938,2015-04-08,665016,Vivian,"Comfortable room with lots of closet space! The bathroom is shared, so make sure you are respectful of other guest's schedule. This can be tough if you are in a rush and someone's in there! Just something to keep in mind. 

We did not meet Luyao till the last night we were staying there due to our conflicting schedules, but her husband was working from home and was downstairs if we ever needed anything. They were both suuuper accommodating and helpful throughout the whole trip!! Hosts are great about guests using their kitchen space. Everything is labelled in the kitchen for guest use (i.e. cabinets, drawers in fridge, toaster, etc.) and there are definitely utensils and what not for use!

Bus stops were only about a block away and even though there were some nights where we out late, it was really not a problem getting back to their place. I would definitely recommend if you don't mind the public transportation!"
5164581,29715767,2015-04-11,7075416,Patricia,"Luyao and husband were very helpful and welcoming.  The room is as described, quiet and close to downtown.  The bonus is there's plenty of off street parking if you have a car. "
5164581,29740654,2015-04-12,27672466,Ruisi,Luyao's house is pretty and quite. We had a great living experience there. Everything is clean tide and convenient. 
5164581,29844843,2015-04-13,8427795,Julia,"We had a wonderful short, but sweet, stay with Luyao. The neighborhood was convenient and she prepared a nice clean room for us to stay in. If you're traveling to Seattle, I reccomend staying here!

Thanks again,

Julia"
5164581,30417391,2015-04-21,30556535,Ellen,"I appreciated the flexible check-in time. This was adequate for budget lodging. Room itself was as described. Location was quiet and safe, street parking was available for no added cost.
""Access to"" the bathroom here really means Shared bathroom with other airbnb bedroom rented on second floor. The one review that pointed this out was written after I booked this, unfortunately. Listing is not quite accurate on that. So I was not prepared to share a bath but it worked out fine and there was only one person in the other room luckily. 
The bus line downtown is just one block up and very convenient 10 minutes to downtown, however some planning is required depending on your destination. Mine was Seattle Center all weekend and the bus only ran every hour with last bus to get home at 10:24p even on a Saturday, not 2:00am like another reviewer commented. 
Overall it is a good choice if you need an inexpensive place to sleep."
5164581,30876538,2015-04-28,8002495,Alex,"Had such a wonderful time staying here! Luyao and her husband are lovely people and very accommodating. The room was nice and in a quiet neighborhood, but very easy to get downtown via public transportation. 

Would  recommend staying here and I would definitely return."
5164581,31115861,2015-05-02,4903894,Fuego,"The room was clean and nice. We didn't meet Luyao, but her husband was in the house to greet us. Sharing a bathroom can really be inconvenient sometimes, but we knew what we are getting into. The house is easy to find and get to, but if you come late, parking is limited, you might need to park on adjacent streets. The neighborhood is nice too."
5164581,31524764,2015-05-06,30086744,Casper,"Very nice room & house in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood. Luyao made us feel welcome and was very hospitable and helpful with our questions. Supermarket, restaurants, and bus connection to the center were close by. I'd recommend anyone to stay at Luyao's place!"
5164581,32068863,2015-05-13,31147584,Yvonne,"The host couple are very nice and friendly. They always tried to help me get the directions and transportation information. The room is tidy and neat. Wifi and detailed information/direction of the house are properly provided which has made everything easy during my stay.

Thank you so much for making my stay in Seattle so wonderful.
 "
5164581,32173112,2015-05-15,23273192,Melody,"We had a great stay with Luyao & Tao. Their home is neat and clean, the room is cozy, and the bed is comfortable. They live in a nice neighborhood with easy public access to/from downtown via the 33 bus so you can get around without a car. We walked to the grocery store nearby and cooked a few meals in their kitchen. We would definitely stay again if in Seattle! "
5164581,32296254,2015-05-16,851779,Patricia Elizabeth,"Comfortable and economical place to stay. Luyao was quick with communication and arranging check in which made for a smooth stay. Thank you, Luyao!"
5164581,32681558,2015-05-20,28259107,Tanner,"Luyao was a very accommodating host! We were out most of the day each day to see Seattle so we did not get to interact that much. The room was perfect and the bed was comfy! The bus stop is so close which made getting around a breeze Luyao also provided transit books  and attractions which came in handy for us! Would stay again, great experience! "
5164581,32866354,2015-05-22,7476513,Jennifer,"Luyao and her husband were great! The room, bathroom and location are as described, and it was a close drive to downtown. She was very flexible with check-in time, and we were very happy with our stay! "
5164581,32974534,2015-05-24,7107553,Farina,"The Check-In was quick and easy, the room was clean and the bed very comfortable. It is not located in the city center, but there are busses or you can go by car in 20 minutes. We had only one night at Luyaos place but I could really recommend it!"
5164581,33650613,2015-05-31,24766455,Shu Wei,"Comfortable and clean house to stay.  Even you don't have car, transportation is still convenient. Host are really nice and hospitable. "
5164581,34146140,2015-06-05,16815798,Cécile,"Great room! I recommend this place when you want to visit Seattle. Next to the house, there are many services (bus, shops...etc.). Luyao was very flexible with check-in time. Thanks Luyao for everything."
5164581,34274944,2015-06-07,9251783,Diego,Luyao was a great host. The place is in a really good location if u want to visit downtown or if going in a cruise like we did. The only caveat is that it is in the second floor so if u have a lot of luggage it is a little challenging. 
5164581,34445948,2015-06-08,2390775,Felipe,Thank you so much to our host for greeting and inviting us we had a comfortable safe and secure stay right outside of central Seattle.  Plenty of closet space a comfortable bed and if you take a lift ride into downtown Seattle it's about 12 bucks for two people. A nice condo community with wifi
5164581,34794092,2015-06-12,33346102,Dragan,"The room was very clean, the bed was perfect and there was plenty of space and shelves for luggage and other things, even more than I needed. Luyao was very flexible with check-in and check-out times and responsive about any question I had.

The neighborhood is very nice and quiet, with a couple of very close (2 - 5 minutes walking) stops for buses going in different directions. There is also a very nice pub close by, where you can have food and drinks any time of the day.

In conclusion, a very nice accommodation, which fitted perfectly in my first ever Seattle experience."
5164581,35261571,2015-06-16,35173552,Bryan,"Luyao was a great hostess. Her place is in a nice neighborhood with easy parking, and she was very kind and accommodating. Our only interaction was when we first arrived, but during that interaction she was warm and friendly. "
5164581,38978498,2015-07-20,4487859,Hannah,"We really enjoyed our stay -- Luyao provided us with everything we needed-- a clean bedroom with plenty of closet space, towels, etc. Luyao was flexible about a late arrival which we needed due to a late flight! We also really liked the neighborhood -- it was extremely easy to take buses downtown or to other parts of the city. We didn't spend much time at the BnB because we were extremely busy with our stay, but it certainly provided us with everything we needed! "
5164581,39276956,2015-07-22,25935362,Tarina,This was my ver first Airbnb experience. I'm glad I got to experience this with Luyao and her husband Tao. They were very friendly and ver inviting. Their home was lovely in a very nice part of town. 
5164581,40336888,2015-07-30,14524850,Kavee,"My wife and I really enjoyed staying at Luyou's place. The place was clean, comfy and very easy to get in town as it's described. The area is safe and quiet. We didn't have chance to meet Luyoa but we met Luyou's husband. He was a nice guy. I would recommend this place to my friends and whoever is looking to visit Seattle."
5164581,40638843,2015-08-01,30599257,Jason,"Luyao was very accommodating and friendly! The room was clean, with more than enough storage space, good bed, and a good bathroom. The location is pretty good as it's a simple bus ride or Lyft to downtown , Discovery Park, Ballard/Fremont, etc. All pretty awesome places. Of course it was all capped off with Luyao and her hospitality. "
5164581,40897162,2015-08-03,1930593,Ben,Luyao and Tao were very nice hosts and the place was clean and quiet. Starbucks and a couple good restaurants nearby. Great value!
5164581,41924411,2015-08-10,30115257,Brian,"First time using Airbnb was a pleasant one. Luyao and her husband were very accommodating, although I didn't interact much with them due to our different schedules. The room was cozy and clean and the bed was large (always a plus). The area was quite nice as well, very quiet. Would definitely stay here in the future!"
5164581,43232778,2015-08-18,34980581,Adric,"This was my first time using airbnb, and i'm glad to report it was a positive experience! (Admittedly i don't having anything to compare it to yet, but i was very happy with my stay.) Luyao and Tao were very kind and welcoming, the accommodations were as advertised, and the neighbourhood was safe and quiet. I was initially worried the street parking might be an issue, but i was always able to find a spot nearby. I would definitely consider staying here again."
5164581,43553004,2015-08-20,3496067,Bronwen,"Our stay at Luyao's was very pleasant and exactly what we needed for our short time in Seattle. Luyao and her husband were friendly and helpful whenever we encountered them. Luyao was very responsive when I later realized I had forgotten my passport in the room too. Their neighborhood is quiet and had good street parking. We found it easy to get into the city from their house, about a 15 minute drive. We did share the bathroom with other guests but that wasn't a problem for me. I'd recommend their place to others looking for a quiet place to sleep after exploring the city."
5164581,44300738,2015-08-25,36442109,Ivy,Luyao and her husband are wonderful and kind hosts. The room we stayed in was comfortable and they washrooms had the basic essentials provided for by host. It was wonderful to return to their home after a busy day exploring to rest. Thank you!
5164581,45244925,2015-09-01,33234905,Tommy,"I really enjoyed staying with Luyao. The neighborhood seems to mind their own business, the home was clean, cozy, and comfortable. I cooked a little for myself, but I was usually out most of the day every day. The room was clean, bed was comfy, and was pretty bright while there was sun outside. No complaints here!

The only trouble I ever had was parking, but there isn't anything Luyao could have done about that. There was only street parking available, but my issue was finding a place to park. Especially at night. My advice for anyone coming with a car, park on the street, and leave your car there. Take uber/lyft. It will save you money and hassle."
5164581,45937284,2015-09-07,33452196,Adrian,"Luyao and her husband were very accomodating to my girlfriend and I :) There was ample space in the fridge for our groceries, the living areas were very well maintained, and we even got to enjoy a few episodes of a hilarious chinese trivia show with them. A downtown-bound bus stopped one block from their house and there's a pleasant grocery store a few minutes walk away. 

I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone who would like a low-key visit to Seattle. "
5164581,46393670,2015-09-10,12200358,Christoph,"Luyao's room is wonderful and she is a great host.  Communication prior to our arrival was excellent, too. The neighborhood is quiet and convenient. I can highly recommend it."
5164581,48002288,2015-09-22,40538114,Jenifer,"Although we did not get to meet Luyao during our arrival, however, we were welcomed by her husband Tao who was accomodating. He showed us where are room was and that was basically it. We got to meet Luyao, I believe the following day or the day after. Both husband and wife are very friendly and Luyao made sure we were comfortable. I am a light sleeper, so the noises outside kept me up half the night. But, for the most part the drive to Downtown area and Ballard and to many attractions was not bad at all. We had a great time!"
5164581,48330684,2015-09-25,9061561,Rex,"Great experience, fine room, convenient location, wonderful hosts! "
5164581,49137357,2015-10-01,43053520,Chaz,"I cannot recommend this Airbnb enough. The room and house are very clean. Soap, shampoo, conditioner, q-tips and toothpaste are all provided for those staying. The room has shelving in the closet which makes it very easy to keep the room from feeling cluttered while you stay. Another thing I liked was that there was a desk in the room. I had homework to do on my trip so this was very convenient. 
Another cool feature is that if you aren't familiar with Seattle you will have no problem getting to the down town area from the house. The bus stop is about a minute walk from the house and a single bus ride will take you into the downtown area. Also there is a variety of restaurants, a gas station and convenient store within a 5 minute walking distance. 
Luyao and her husband were both very nice. I hope they are both making a lot of money off this Airbnb because this is a great place to stay!"
5164581,52464626,2015-10-29,19543859,Mary,"Luyao and her husband are a very sweet, young couple! Helpful, friendly and cheerful. A quiet, clean, uncluttered condo. The neighborhood is very quiet. Well placed for the Ballard, Queen Anne area. I was only 7-8 minutes from Key Arena where my concert was. The coffee was nice perk, plus some room in the frig. I would return."
5164581,53014067,2015-11-03,3517410,Meghan,Luyao was a great host and the room was just as described. Great location and very convenient. The bed was comfortable and we had a great stay. We'll be back!
5164581,53689206,2015-11-11,45173024,Amber,"Luayao was very welcoming! The room was spacious, tidy and warm for the cold/wet weather. The nice thing about staying here was the bus lines (33,31, & 24) were very close and take you pretty much everywhere. There is a grocery store near by, Starbucks, gas stations and other restaurants near by. Also, there's a Pizza place and a burger joint about 9min. walk away that are pretty good. This trip was a success thanks to Luyao's place."
5164581,53859533,2015-11-13,38945420,Giancarlo,The host made me feel as if I was in my own home. Everything was very clean and the bed was comfortable.
5164581,56852368,2015-12-19,6404545,Justin,"Luyao was a great host! I stayed for two weeks after just moving to Seattle from the east coast and I was thrilled to stay in such a nice place for such an amazing price. I was pleasantly welcomed and was helped with whatever I needed. Nice, quiet area in Magnolia/Interbay and would recommend to the next guest."
5164581,57065087,2015-12-21,44697052,Alexa,Great host! She was very quick at responding to my messages. I felt comfortable and safe. She was organized with before and after instructions. I would definitely recommend someone to stay there. 
5164581,57232186,2015-12-23,39650645,陈,Luyao is a very very nice landlord! She responded very fast whenever i had a question. The room is clean and tidy and there is a good view looking out of the window. The kitty pet in the house is super cute!!! When i opened the door in the morning i always saw her lying in the middle of the hall and she is not shy at all. Super cute. Recommend this airbnb to everyone. 
5164581,57412377,2015-12-25,36525087,Noah,"Never met the host, but the place is in a nice neighborhood. It's a 30 minute bus ride from downtown. "
5164581,57697948,2015-12-28,22218436,Xiao   Jun,"The rom meets my expectations in term of size and as described. The ceiling to floor window provides feeling of spaciousness and some view of a small mountain and surrounding. The closet is relatively huge ang very functionable. It has many section that can handle different type of clothing and supply enough room for storage. Luyao provides a few sort of shampoo and body wash. After first day of introduction, The cat is so close to us that it wants to come into my room. The next day it was policed and is only allowed on third floor. The good part of Luyao ' house is that it is so close to downtown that it only takes 15 to 20 minutes by ONE bus to very core part of commercial.shopping streets. The best is that you will enter the border of downtown only 8 minutes after you get in the bus and enjoy the vivid modern city life. This impressed me as you may not know that many part of Seattle looks very countryside and infrastructure is underdeveloped . So luyao's house location also give sense of security to many first timer to Seattle.   On the other front. Luyao spent considerable amount of time chatting with me on how they settle,grow and develop in Seattle, which benefit me a lot."
5164581,58028547,2015-12-31,48800076,Olivia,"Luyao was a sweet, thoughtful hostess who provided me, a newbie AirBnB user, with a fantastic experience. Simple, safe, stress less - the trip was exactly what I had hoped it would be. "
5164581,58565345,2016-01-03,13509835,Burcin,it was very nice to stay with Luyao and her husband. very clean and comfortable. Thank you guys!
319768,1072595,2012-04-02,1828890,Katie,"We had a wonderful, 10+ day stay at the Hobbs family's beautiful modern home in Seattle in March.  Jen met us when we arrived, gave us a tour and showed us everything we needed to know.  She had inquired about what we were interested in doing and seeing in Seattle before we arrived, and had put together a great list and Google map of these spots of interest, including factoring in my half-marathon training and recommending nearby running routes.  She and her family were lovely to meet.  

The house was a perfect spot from which to explore Seattle.  We used the internet connectivity to work on our computers during the mornings, went for runs along Lake Washington, and in the evenings we very much enjoyed their gorgeous kitchen, where we were able to cook great meals.  We had our car with us and used it to get around, but we noted that very frequent bus service was available at the end of the block.  We felt very welcome in the Hobbs' home, in the 'mi casa es su casa' type of way.  Thank you Hobbs family!!  We would love to come back  : )"
319768,5840865,2013-07-19,5492159,Hank,"Beautiful house and thoughtful hosts. Jen provided lots of cupboard and closet space for our things and left out toys and books for our three year old. He enjoyed the stay as much as we did. He beelined to the backyard sandbox whenever we came back from an outing.  The house is beautiful, parking was easy and the neighborhood was lovely with parks and shops nearby. Everything was just really handy and comfortable. We hope to come stay again."
319768,5961892,2013-07-24,5538943,Jana & Jay,"We absolutely LOVED this home - and although we never met them in person, we love this family too! Jen was extremely helpful and responsive leading up to our stay, and we really appreciated her sending us a map with kid-friendly neighborhood restaurants and parks. Our kids also really enjoyed having some new toys and books to play with. 

Their home is warm, friendly, and bright, so it was very easy for us to feel comfortable right away and just RELAX! We also loved the backyard, our kids spent hours out there and my husband just sat back, sipping his beer and enjoying the beautiful Seattle summer. 

Kitchens, bathrooms, etc. are all well-stocked, and we all enjoyed cooking on that awesome stove. I spent a LOT of time just chilling in the hammock on the master bedroom patio - yay!! :)

We parked our rental van in the driveway - very convenient! Street parking was easy for my brother's rental. He found parking within a couple houses every time. 

Location is great too - felt like everything we wanted to see was 5-30 minutes away, and found SO MANY great restaurants, playgrounds, cultural experiences, etc. within 15 minutes. 

We hope their availability lines up with ours next time cause we'd love to stay there again! :) 

MAHALO HOBBS FAMILY! "
319768,6169187,2013-08-02,5250394,Dave,This is a nice house in a convenient neighborhood close to downtown and UW. The area has plenty of restaurants and grocery stores. The kitchen is amazing. My elderly mom had some trouble with all the stairs but did alright as it turned out. Jen was very helpful with some changes to our schedule and was always quick to respond to emails.  I hope to return here next summer! Dave
319768,9419492,2013-12-28,44631,Bradford,"What a COOL place! Jen was kind enough to let us stay here while we were in town for the week for xmas. We've always wanted to live in a modern home in Seattle and we had our chance! Great location, super neat architecture, good amenities (GOOD ESPRESSO MACHINE!). Will definitely stay again. "
9170870,55154150,2015-11-28,6908581,John,"I have stayed in many AirBnB around the world - Rachel's is one of the best.  The home looks just like the photos - squeaky clean and neat.  The HUGE HD TV on the wall gives the impression of being THERE for the big game, anywhere in the room.  A few blocks walk to Lake Washington, quaint coffee shops, food and bars.  Off the main streets and away from busy sections of Seattle, quiet and peaceful, friendly neighbors walking their dogs greet you with a Hello and a smile.  Street parking in front of the house was always easy, any time of day.  Put Rachel, and her rental, at the top of your list of Seattle area's ""Home away from Home"" choices..."
9712716,55870490,2015-12-06,8009766,Lucie,"Had a very good stay in this gorgeous house. Lovely art, very comfy and so quiet. Five stars"
9712716,56086106,2015-12-08,29350055,Stacey,"This was a really stellar AirBnB stay for us - exactly what we hoped for. Our son just moved to an apartment in the same neighborhood as this stately home and we were happy to find such a reasonably priced, close option with off street parking. 

The photos and description looked great to us but pale in comparison with the real thing: 1 of the coolest and most interesting homes we've visited. From the furniture to the dishes to the art work and linens, the place is classy and comfortable. The location is awesome - you can walk to Pike Place Market to explore like we did if you like to stretch your legs - and access is easy with a 4 digit lockbox. It was rainy during our stay but there are several outside areas to enjoy if time and sky allow.

Communication with Sam was prompt and friendly; directions were clear and house rules simple and logical. We were happy to cross paths with Sam 1 day before he left for work; we hope it's not the last time. This place is a real gem and we're already looking forward to future visits. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."
9712716,58632693,2016-01-03,8243574,Krista,"My partner and I stayed at Sam's place for a total of four nights over New Year's Eve. We had a great experience - the room was spacious, clean, and nice & quiet. The second bedroom (which you can rent; we stayed in the plaid room) also has a scenic view of downtown, which was great for New Year's Eve fireworks. We also had use of a parking space, which was GREAT as Seattle can be really difficult in terms of parking. Sam himself was also welcoming when we saw him and responded to my emails / texts promptly. No problems with our stay whatsoever. 

Overall, a great stay for a great price. Highly recommended!"
8815061,51399086,2015-10-19,17339741,William,"Great location, amazing rooftop view of Space Needle and downtown, well-appointed 1-bedroom studio. Thanks Daniela for an amazing stay."
8815061,52383398,2015-10-28,12968467,Jonathan,This cozy one bedroom was like home away from home. It is decorated well and has all the things you need with a great layout. The host was very helpful with the check in process and suggested places to see. The rooftop was the most amazing part. The view of the Space Needle and the city was spectacular. I highly recommend this space. 
8815061,53844962,2015-11-13,22756422,Jesús,"Jocelyn was a great host and I enjoyed her kindness and help during my visit to Seattle.
Amazing apartment in a great location of Seattle. Beautiful views and space.
Thanks for helping me to have such a great time!"
8815061,54923805,2015-11-25,4293080,Bryan,"Jocelyn was excellent from the start to the finish and the apartment is absolutely fantastic - totally modern, absolutely clean, all the amenities you'd need and in a perfect location.
If you're visiting Seattle... this is an awesome apartment."
8815061,57148141,2015-12-22,49754146,Ashley,"The condo was perfect for my weekend of exploring Seattle! It was clean, had a wonderful view of the city / space needle, and was conveniently located/ waking distance to many great restaurants, shops, and bars.  Check in and check out was very smooth/ easy! I would definitely re-book for my next trip to Seattle. "
3412630,16261740,2014-07-24,3346850,Evan,"Scott was an awesome host and I would absolutely recommend staying with him again.  He is very responsive and attended to our many needs to ensure a great stay before we got there, including finding a parking spot in the complex for us, an extra mattress, baby gates for the stairs, and more.   While we stayed there he continued to keep in touch.

The place itself is gorgeous.  In addition to the great looks and the loft, there is a great and really spatious patio.  We enjoyed watching the late Seattle summer sunsets from the patio, and the kids loved walking out to the Patio and playing there.   Note that there were no screens on the windows, though this may be addressed.

The location is super convenient.  It is really close to three different bus lines that take you downtown or to the Seattle Center; and there are tons of restaurants as well as a park close by. 

I would not hesitate to recommend this place to others."
3412630,16485587,2014-07-28,17380325,Lucyna,"This place is truly an oasis in the heart of vibrant Capitol Hill.  It was great to be within walking distance of so many great pubs, restaurants and roasteris, and then to be able to return to a calm, peaceful, comfortable place of rest.  The beds are SO comfortable, the kitchen is fully functional and the patio is great to lounge in the sun.  I also appreciated having a great sound system in which to plug my phone.  The decor is Asian inspired and flowed beautifully.  Our hosts were so easy to communicate with and very genuine and helpful.  I can't wait to come back."
3412630,17624135,2014-08-15,17182906,Julien,"The unit was beautiful and I really enjoyed our stay there. Everything was easy, convenient and clean.  Scott was a great host, responsive to all our questions. Capitol Hill is a vibrant area is Seattle and the unit is perfectly located in this area. Everything was within a walking distance, with great bars and restaurants. I will definitely consider this unit for my next trips to Seattle. A great place!

3412630,17943759,2014-08-19,15747134,Peter,"Beautiful space, both comfortable & luxurious. Great location. All was as good or better than described. Will use again and highly recommended to anyone. We traveled as a couple with a teenager & all were wonderfully happy!"
3412630,18943109,2014-09-03,2186286,Michael,This was an amazing AirBNB in a great location for us.  Everything was very convenient and we could walk to almost everything.  I loved that Scott left a list of recommended coffee places and restaurants.  Skillet was my favorite.
3412630,21286039,2014-10-14,6718179,Peter,"The location is dynamite, right in the heart of shopping/restaurants/bars.  The home is a comfy 2 bedroom in a Japanese motif with a great kitchen and fantastic south-facing deck for summer use."
3412630,21625610,2014-10-20,22253362,Lindsay,"Scott was a wonderful host and his place is beautiful! We had visited Seattle for the weekend and couldn't have found a better location! His place is located in the heart of capital hill, near many restaurants, bars and shops. Scott's place had everything we needed to cook and had a wonderful patio out back to enjoy the evening. When we head back to Seattle next, we will certainly try to stay here again!"
3412630,22015183,2014-10-28,10487952,Dave,"4 of us adults stayed 5 nights at Scott's place. It met all of our needs and we were satisfied.
Location is the best thing about this place. Couldn't get much better for access to downtown and Capitol Hill offerings.
It rained our entire stay, which is Seattle but wished there was more light. The skylights help."
3412630,22434847,2014-11-06,3740717,Katrina,"The apartment was gorgeous and clean and listing was accurate. The host left lots of detailed information to get us oriented and comfortable. Checking in was easy as could be. ""Oasis"" is a great description. "
3412630,22703841,2014-11-12,20438632,Jenny,"We loved our stay at Scott's place! The location is amazing. We found so many delicious food spots nearby. The apartment itself is beautiful and perfect for two couples since there are two bedrooms, one and a half baths, lots of indoor common space, a beautiful full kitchen, and a huge patio. Scott was so accommodating and responsive. He left us a pack and play, baby gates, and made parking easy. We would definitely stay here again!"
3412630,23128441,2014-11-23,2220382,Sarah,Scott's place is the perfect Seattle hideaway and he is lovely and super helpful.
3412630,24807829,2015-01-03,19396804,Viviane,"This is a great unit in a great location!  There are plenty of good restaurants and cafes within walking distance, plus a full playground for kids just down the street. Scott is one of the most responsive landlords I've ever met; he always dealt with any house issues quickly and efficiently (and cheerfully).  I would recommend this place if you're looking to stay in Capitol Hill.  "
3412630,27689663,2015-03-09,28496187,Christina,"I don't like to gush, but our stay was great in every way.  Scott was friendly and flexible and helpful.  We shared the unit with our son & hias girlfriend, who were very happy in the loft. Kitchen and deck are especially nice. A charming space, very much as shown online."
3412630,28803180,2015-03-30,14338840,Matthew,"Scott's home is beautiful, and I would definitely stay there again!   Very modern, with a wonderful deck, and a fine piano, which made me realize I need to play the piano more!  It's also in a great neighborhood, walking distance from all kinds of shops and restaurants, a great park, and the cenral co-op.  Highly recommended."
3412630,29079196,2015-04-03,10827446,Gabe,"The unit is beautiful, spacious, extremely comfortable and well equipped. The location is great.. Very central to the best parts of Seattle, and especially close to the Capitol Hill action (though the street it's on is very quiet so noise was never an issue). Truly a special apartment that I was fortunate to call home for 4 nights of my business trip.

And on top of all this, Scott & Ryan were fabulous hosts. They were very responsive in answering my questions about parking, etc. pre-checkin. They took me out for coffee at a locally iconic coffee shop and gave me a great introduction to the Seattle region (I'm brand new to Seattle so the knowledge was invaluable and much appreciated).

All in all, amazingly friendly and hospitable hosts, and a gorgeous property in the best part of Seattle. Five stars across the board :)"
3412630,30048783,2015-04-16,30703094,Tim,everything was as described. We had a great stay and Scott was very sweet. Would definitely stay again.

It was located in good proximity to many restaurants so we had the opportunity to walk and explore Capitol Hill. Scott was very attentive and texted me almost daily to check in and make sure our stay was comfortable and things were going smoothly. He fixed any small issues that came up quickly. The mattress and pillows were heavenly, I almost didn't want to get out of bed sometimes. The full kitchen is excellent for entertaining and sitting out on the deck with a glass of wine and friends is absolutely perfect. Great place!"
3412630,31249828,2015-05-03,25651037,Daniel,"I loved my time here!  The apartment is perfectly clean, and Scott is incredibly responsive to all communications. A++++"
3412630,31711065,2015-05-09,28281505,Travis,"This was our second time staying at Scott's property, and just like last time, it was impeccable. 

The unit is fantastic. The dining room table just begs you to set around it with friends. The back deck is the perfect spot to end the day at. "
3412630,31988438,2015-05-12,32096321,Tim,"Fantastic lovely oasis in the middle of everything in Capitol Hill.  Just steps away from shopping and nightlife.  Tucked away on a lush, green street, a handsomely appointed multi-level space with all the comforts of home and exceptional privacy.  Incredibly comfortable beds made it hard to leave.  I feel lucky to have chosen Scott as our first Airbnb experience."
3412630,32261450,2015-05-16,25145825,Christen,"The apartment was perfect for our visit: all the right amenities, beautiful space, and incredibly comfortable beds.

3412630,32629754,2015-05-19,31099945,Joshua,"Incredible oasis and beds all in the middle of a lovely neighborhood. Definitely will look back into coming here again in the future. 
Scott was very good at communicating with us. I'm glad this was our first stay!"
3412630,33249485,2015-05-26,11706386,Karl,"Unit B was perfect! The location could not have been better. The home is located on a quiet residential street but less than 3 minutes by foot to the hustle and bustle of Pine And Puke Streets. Our group travelled from Chicago, Waco, and Portland ready to walk to everything they wanted to do; no rental car necessary for a 3-night stay. 

Scott was easy to communicate with and was helpful when deciding which unit to book. The accommodations were modern Asian with a Pac NW feel - thus adding to the Seattle feel for out-of-towers. There is a large rooftop gathering area, but the accommodations outside are sparse. Still, it's nice to have. It would be perfect with a grill and dining table. 

The beds were comfortable; everyone has the preferences, but everyone slept like champs.

I would recommend this place over and over. Why would anyone want a hotel room when you can stay at this fantastic evening place?"
3412630,34079152,2015-06-04,1170011,Michael,Great place in a really great neighborhood! Honestly this place was so chill we never wanted to leave - the only thing that convinced us to were the many amazing restaurants no more than a 5-10 minute walk away. Would definitely stay here again.
3412630,34505401,2015-06-08,22165127,David,"The stay was absolutely wonderful--I already will plan to stay again on a future visit.  Scott's home was clean, spacious, inviting, and relaxing.  He has the right balance of the critical things you need, while remaining simplistic for guests.  The bed is wonderful--the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in!  Scott himself was a wonderful host--he made sure all my questions were answered prior to arrival, ensured the place was ready for my arrival, and even took time to have a glass of wine and make recommendations for other great venues for the remainder of my trip.  You absolutely can't beat this place--a wonderful home, in a fantastic location, in a neighborhood that breathes relaxation and friendly people.  Thanks Scott for a wonderful stay!"
3412630,34795177,2015-06-12,23891858,Anne,"Scott was warm, welcoming, and promptly answered all of our questions. He went the extra mile to make sure we could check in in comfort after a long, hot day, and his Urban Oasis is just that -- well appointed and clearly well loved. The neighborhood is wonderful, with good coffee & groceries a short walk away and Pike Place Market an easy 20-minute walk from the house. And the dining area and deck are fantastic! Lots of room to spread out in the shared spaces, and comfy bedrooms with good closets/storage. Great home away from home."
3412630,38998621,2015-07-20,27288350,Robert,"The Pike/Pine Urban Oasis Unit B is the rare environment that turns out to be even better than the description and photographs advertise. Scott is a class act with a true artist's eye, and we immediately appreciated what he's created.  There's beauty everywhere you look, from the dining room with the magnificent table that seats (or so it seemed) 100, to the large and magnificent piano painting to the living room with the coolest couches in America to the upstairs bedroom with the skylight to the treasure which is the splendid outdoor patio.  And if that doesn't sound like enough, Scott is a genuinely nice person who was extremely helpful to us. And the neighborhood is very cool, too, with terrific restaurants a matter of a few blocks away, and you can get anywhere you want to go without a car. The only thing we didn't like was the fact that we had to leave, but nothing is perfect.  "
3412630,40394459,2015-07-30,91432,Andrew,The place was great - just as described with a great kitchen and back roof deck!  
3412630,41310965,2015-08-07,27616433,Sandra,"We loved the well furnished-home on Pike Street. And Scott, our host, was helpful and informative. The home is within walking distance of great restaurants, a food coop, and public transportation. We rented a car because we planned trips outside of Seattle and there was an extra cost for parking at the home. If you do not plan on outside travel, a car in Seattle is not needed. We recommend this host. "
3412630,46475654,2015-09-11,4143990,Non,"Clean place, great location, and extremely accommodating and responsive hosts! We very much enjoyed our time at Scott and Ryan's place while in Seattle and would highly recommend it to anybody looking to explore Capitol Hill!"
7500976,53891809,2015-11-14,2664491,Gemma,"Great daylight basement apartment.  It is a perfect location, quiet street but close to it all.  We needed housing for our mother (and intermittent visiting family) while a family member was at Swedish Cherry hill for over 6 weeks and this was heaven sent!  It was 2 easy blocks to the hospital and a wonderful place to come home to.  There were two spacious bedrooms, nice kitchen and living area.

4752817,26607764,2015-02-16,26074658,Horace,Connie's place was exactly as described and Connie was very helpful in making sure the whole experience was as smooth and amazing as possible. I would highly recommend staying at her place!

The space was just the right size with gorgeous views and an unbeatable location.  There is so much of Seattle within walking distance and it made our stay just perfect!
4752817,27696968,2015-03-09,106040,David,Although I didn't meet Connie she made everything seamless. The place was even better then the pictures which are great and the location was perfect! Highly recommended!

4752817,28145428,2015-03-18,27624705,Yuhan,Nice location. Connie was very accommodated. Definitely will recommend this place to my friends.  
4752817,28308237,2015-03-22,25651734,Megan,"Connie was the best! She was very flexible and worked with our schedule, which we all really appreciated. The condo itself was great, and we loved how we could spend a night in, and utilize the kitchen.  It  is also right in the middle of downtown, and was walking distance to a lot of the main Seattle attractions. Overall, we all had a great time and it felt like we were really living in Seattle!"
4752817,28777176,2015-03-30,8127501,Tony,"This place was exactly as the pictures indicated.  The host was very compliant and helpful throughout our stay.  This place is a 7 minute walk from door to door of the convention center so that was perfect.  Towels, little shower gels, and other minor touches really made us feel welcome and relaxed the moment we got in.

Can't recommend enough."
4752817,29183781,2015-04-05,14853977,Charity,"We had a little difficulty getting our August Lock to work, but Connie came to our rescue and unlocked the door, letting us in. We were so grateful. It was as pictured, very welcoming to us. It was appointed well, so we didn't have many worries. We really enjoyed our stay, every night after our convention it felt like we were returning home. I don't miss staying at a hotel and all the noise and parties. So this was quiet and ideal."
4752817,29820519,2015-04-13,26712252,Andy,"Connie was very helpful through the whole booking experience, answering queries promptly and being flexible and accommodating.  
We spent the week at the Convention Center and this is easily the closest accommodation to the venue which is right across the road. 
The roof-top deck has the best views of the city skyline and we met many residents up there getting some sun in the morning or enjoying a quiet drink in the evening watching the sunset, its a really nice oasis to relax and watch the city move under you.
The condo was spotless and well appointed and well maintained, nice beds, great lounge and very useful kitchen.
The area has plenty of food and drink choices and everything is just a short walk away.
I would recommend this property to anyone and will certainly stay here on my next Seattle trip.  Stop looking, you found the best in Seattle for the convention center right here!"
4752817,31484594,2015-05-05,9342087,Ladislav,"Connie was very kind host, we had no problem with her neighbours."
4752817,32091134,2015-05-13,28836814,Matthew,"Connie's apartment was exactly as pictured.  We only needed 1 bdr, but this would be very comfortable if sharing with others.  This condo is nestled by Capitol Hill and very close to restaurants and even a few convenient stores.  It is an easy walk down to Pike's Place (about 15-20 min walk) and all the other tourist spots.  The little touches in her apartment make your stay more comfortable, from the toiletries to the coffee maker.  Connie was also very responsive if we had a question about something and even accommodated our request to stay an additional day.  I would definitely stay here again."
4752817,32353880,2015-05-17,20187812,Adam,"Connie's condo was in an awesome location, and she provided everything we needed for our trip.
Would highly recommend her plqce for anyone interested in a great trip to Seattle!"
4752817,32899279,2015-05-23,30809209,Kris,"The place was beautiful and looks just like in the pictures. It was very clean and well-maintained. The location was great. We had easy access to the buses at Convention Place station and within walking distance to Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill. The neighborhood is pretty safe and also just a quick cab ride from most places downtown. Connie was very accommodating with our stay. We had to wait a bit outside the building to be able to get in. Luckily, the mail man came out and let us in. We used the August app to get in the apartment. Once we had the keys, it was pretty smooth sailing. 

It gets a little hot in the apartment since it was on the topmost floor and we had really sunny days. We opened the windows but it would have really helped if there was AC. There was a fan in one of the rooms but we mostly had to take off our blankets at night because it gets really warm. 

The beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was clean and well-stocked. The washer/dryer was a nice bonus! We felt very much at home and enjoyed our stay in Seattle. Definitely recommended!"
4752817,33230969,2015-05-26,28100573,Jill,"Connie was a wonderful hostess.  Her apartment met our needs beautifully.  It was clean, quiet and comfortable.

She responded quickly to our questions.   We had a very nice stay.

The two bedrooms were comfortable, but the couches in the living room might be better ""beds"" for those under 12 years than for adults."
4752817,33602135,2015-05-30,2732531,Liam,Great place at a great price. Connie was great. Would definitely recommend.
4752817,34052623,2015-06-04,27563712,Keri,"This was an incredible experience - I'll never stay in a hotel again!  Connie's place was in the perfect location:  Walking distance to convention center and the public market.  I ran along the waterfront to Myrtle Edwards park, and it was beautiful!  The apartment was clean and bright. I LOVED it!  All the amenities including full kitchen, 2 bright bedrooms, free Wi-Fi, toiletries available....I could write pages on this wonderful place. The August Moon lock system worked perfectly.  Connie was a great hostess - quick responses and great communication!  If I ever go back to Seattle, I won't even look for a different place!  This has completely changed my mindset:  Instead of sitting in a dreary, lukewarm hotel room, I'll find hosts with great places and great feedback, willing to share their space via airbnb!!!"
4752817,34691511,2015-06-11,26589045,Jen,we had a great time and the apartment was in a great location. Connie was also very easy to communicate with and was incredibly accommodating. 
4752817,34953579,2015-06-14,31114017,JaimiAnn,This sweet condo was extremely clean and simply decorated. We enjoyed our stay for three nights and the location was perfectly located for a walking vacation. Connie had a parking space that we rented and left our car. The August lock app and key system worked flawlessly. It was very easy to come and go and we felt very safe. Starbucks coffee and creamer were provided for our stay and I have to tell you how appreciative we were for that after arriving at 1:00 am the night before. Connie was a great host. She was quick to reply to any and all of our questions. I would recommend this condo in Seattle. We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. 
4752817,35363836,2015-06-18,1178086,Miiri,Connie's place was perfectly located for our stay in Seattle - close to the Convention Center for a conference and easy access to Pikes Place and the monorail.  We had some questions about accessing the condo and she was very prompt and kind in responding.   It did get a bit hot in the evenings but we were there during unseasonably beautiful weather.
4752817,35907922,2015-06-23,25609997,Shirley,"We found our airbnb experience perfect for our needs in Seattle and Connie was a very accessible and helpful host.  The location was convenient for us being so near Town Hall and many other restaurants,  shopping and Pikes Market."
4752817,36188097,2015-06-26,9139617,Ying Ting,We had a comfortable stay at the apartment. The check-in process was a breeze. We liked the central location.
4752817,36650808,2015-06-30,25817866,Mary,"Connie was very responsive and helpful. The apartment with a beautiful view was clean and had all  the things promised; coffee, washer/dryer and toiletries. The location was great, we walked most of the times. The only problem was the record heat wave in Seattle and there was no AC in the apartment. It was very hot inside. "
4752817,37038806,2015-07-04,29790806,Laura,The apartment is located in a great area. It is in between two major neighborhoods within a reasonable walking distance. The accommodations were spacious even with 5 people. The host always replied to me when I had a question or concern. Would love to stay here again if I come back to Seattle. We loved sitting on the rooftop space at sunset.
4752817,37489074,2015-07-07,12862593,Nori Kenneth,"Connie was very hospitable during our stay in Seattle. The best part is that it's only a quick walk away from the pier and Pike Place Market! The location was very convenient, and Connie was very communicative during our stay, and made for a very relaxing and seamless trip. Just an FYI, parking is available but make sure to let Connie know in advanced. Would stay again!"
4752817,38579183,2015-07-17,12315016,Ann,"Having the Autumn electronic key made arrival simple - no need to coordinate a specific time to meet.  My plane arrived an hour early and Connie buzzed me in remotely.  Fantastic location!  Connie provided a parking pass when the regular parking lot was being repaved - I call that above and beyond!  The fans in the apt were definitely welcome during the unusually hot Seattle weather this July!
I would definitely stay here again."
4752817,39172789,2015-07-21,34483318,David,The space is very homey and comfortable with a great view. Seattle is a beautiful city and this spot just adds to the wonderful experience. 
4752817,40325953,2015-07-30,34182656,Olivier,"Die Wohnung war bei Übernahme perfekt sauber. Die Wegbeschreibung zum Condo war ebenfalls sehr gut, so dass wir  problemlos dahin gefunden haben.
Für 4 Erwachsene Personen sind die Betten zu klein, hier wäre zumindest ein King Size Bett ein Vorteil. Zudem ist für 4 Personen das einzige Badezimmer sehr klein. Sehr positiv empfunden haben wir, dass die Wohnung keine Teppiche, sonder Laminatboden hatte. Die mobile Klimaanlage funktionierte zwar, ist jedoch in der Nacht zu laut. Die Lage ist perfekt, Downtown und der Pike Market in 10-15 Minuten zu Fuss erreichbar. Das WiFi funktionierte problemlos. Alles in allem eine gepflegte Wohnung, jedoch eher nur für 2 Erwachsene mit kleinen Kindern."
4752817,41062672,2015-08-04,7179292,David,"Connie was very responsive and helpful - available and communicative before and during the trip. The apartment was clean and had all the little things that make a stay nice: coffee/tea, washer/dryer, toiletries, wifi. Like most buildings in Seattle, there is no A/C, but Connie has a portable unit in each bedroom. There was record heat during our stay, and the units were more than sufficient to keep the rooms very comfortable."
4752817,42107660,2015-08-11,15169066,Isabella,"We really enjoyed staying at Connie's flat for three nights. Communication with Connie before and during our stay was really good and her instructions on how to get to Elektra Condominiums were perfect. She was super helpful. We also found the location perfect for exploring the city as many of the points of interest are within easy walking distance. The whole condominium complex is not as modern as I had pictured it, but Connie's flat is very appealing, well kept, neat clean and with all amenities we needed for our short stay. I can highly recommend it."
4752817,42471175,2015-08-13,28944738,Ben,Connie was an awesome host. Super helpful and accommodating. Apartment was great and location was very convenient. Recommended.

4752817,46155179,2015-09-08,14693888,Liz,Photos are accurate. Connie's place is about 1 mile walk to Pikes Market. Connie responded to all my questions within 1 hour.

4752817,47691113,2015-09-21,40249720,Sean,Connie is always quick to respond to any questions you may have and walks you through the process so it's very easy.

I was visiting Seattle for a conference at the WA State Convention Center and this was an ideal place to stay. The apartment is cutely decorated, spacious, comfortable, and has all necessary amenities. The photos are very accurate. The internet was fast and the kitchen was well stocked. The complimentary tea and coffee was also very nice! I'd recommend this place or stay here again."

4752817,55895526,2015-12-07,15725274,Victor,"Great apartment located in a great neighborhood - central to a lot of places we wanted to go to. Checkin process was great and painless. Connie responded very quickly to questions and resolved a small issue with parking with ease.

The apartment was very clean and well kept. All appliances worked as expected. The only thing to keep in mind is that walls are a little thin."
4752817,56809132,2015-12-18,50270250,Sumit,"this was my first time using airbnb. the pictures posted is very accurate and Connie really made everything easy. everything was provided in the house for example soaps, towels and even kitchenware which really made it easy for us to do a little bit of cooking. the parking space provided was really comfortable and the apartment itself was located in a convenient location (walking distance to downtown). this is a very nice place to stay in Seattle if you are travelling with 3-4 friends. will stay here again if i plan to go to Seattle."
4752817,57039707,2015-12-21,31528483,Andrea,"Connie's listing was just as pictured, comfortable, and conveniently located in a very central location. It was walking distance to everything, including Pikes Place Market, Starbucks Roastery, and all the restaurants in downtown and Capitol Hill. The games (apples to apples), Xbox 360, and the Seattle lonely planet books were a nice touch. "
6766513,35721963,2015-06-21,20827018,Chanse,"Christy was incredibly helpful - not only did she totally make us feel at home but she was great at recommending local spots to eat and drink. The house felt spacious and open it was a pleasure to stay there.  Its a great location while its close to the freeway the noise didn't bug us at all.

Would definitely recommend to anyone staying in the Seattle area."
6766513,35979798,2015-06-23,34957381,Michael,Excellent host. Quick to reply. Very nice and professional.  The place is clean and roomy..better than in pictures.
6766513,36340535,2015-06-27,28302210,Julie,The place was perfect for me and my mom. It was close enough to everything but still quiet enough that my mom could enjoy it! Christy was a great host and so accommodating! Our ride to Vancouver arrived late but Christy allowed us to stay past our agreed upon departure time. We were so grateful! I would definitely stay here the next time I'm in Seattle. It was clean and comfortable. Definitely highly recommend it!
6766513,36494998,2015-06-28,36809722,Mark,Christy was a excellent host we arrived later then we had planned she had no problem letting us in and making us feel at home. The condo is in a great location it is next to the freeway but that didn't bother us at all you can't even hear the cars unless your outside. I would definitely recommend this condo. 
6766513,36809369,2015-07-01,3794140,Rocket (Dylan),"Christy was kind and thoughtful and gave us a thorough walk-through when we arrived.

"
6766513,49738913,2015-10-05,27714584,Ruth,"The stay was wonderful! Christy was very accommodating with our check-in time, was beyond pleasant, and even left us a bottle of wine since my husband and I were on a little weekend getaway. The space was warm, decorated nicely, clean, and filled with basics like tea and the often forgotten Q-tips. Parking wasn't too bad, as she provided a zone pass. The bed was comfortable (better than any hotel bed I've had), the towels were soft and clean, and the heating worked immediately for those cold nights. Very thankful and would book again! "
6766513,49936098,2015-10-07,38788076,Majid,"Christy was super friendly and quick to respond. Even though I couldn't nail down my arrival time until very near my booking date, she remained patient and was able to accommodate my schedule.

The place itself is cute, clean and comfortable. I was slightly worried about traffic noise due to the nearby freeway, but it was quiet and peaceful in the bedroom and I slept very well both nights I was there. The proximity to bars, restaurants and coffee is superb. I'd definitely stay here again."
6766513,50356447,2015-10-11,2409922,Megan,"This was such a lovely place.  The location was perfect for me, as it was right on a bus route to UW where I was working for a few days. The decorations were cute, and you really felt like you stepped into a home.  I would definitely seek out this place again when I come to Seattle next! "
6766513,50708416,2015-10-13,12758,Kieran,"Christy was a great host. Her place was really nice. She gave us a tour when we arrived, and some great recommendations on a few local spots. It was a great introduction to Seattle."

Her condo was pretty much like the photos but better!!! It was a cool little corner house perfect for just my girlfriend and I. She had all the cool streaming apps which was useful on those rainy days :). The location was awesome, super close to a lot of really good brunch spots and bars, The Zoo was the favorite. All in all I would defiantly stay there again and would recommended it to others as well. "
6766513,52652887,2015-10-31,40127899,Blair,"Our stay at Christy's place was really nice.  The place is comfortable, clean, cozy, and very centrally located, just as described in the posting.  Christy is amazing when it comes to prompt communication, and flexibility with check in and out and stocking the kitchen with plenty of essentials such as spices, oils etc. for some nice home cooked meals.  She was present at check in and took the time to show us around the place before leaving.  The place is next the  highway, but with the windows closed you can barely hear it.  I loved the projector screen serving as the blind and TV.  The availability of the street parking pass is also an added plus.  I would definitely recommend Christy's place for your stay in Seattle."
6766513,53003853,2015-11-03,20215950,Geoff,Christy was awesome. Very great host with a wonderful home. She was very informative and also helpful on helping us figure out where to go in neighborhood. I highly recommend her place.

Excellent host. "
6766513,56138538,2015-12-09,6046725,Merlin,This was basically heaven. Extremely central and yet tucked perfectly away with an amazing restaurant and bar just down the way. The house itself went way beyond our expectations with plenty of room and  everything you could want or need. Definitely would recommend this spot if you can get it! 
6766513,56506336,2015-12-14,48424093,Deborah,Great stay! Thanks Christy!!
6766513,56953212,2015-12-20,49883630,David,"From the very first contact, Christy was very sweet, warm and friendly and incredibly helpful and patient in answering my many questions (where was the nearest Wholefoods, the closest gym and walking routes to my workshop!).   She was even so kind as to pick me up at the light rail station when I arrived as it was en route to where she was going that evening.  The apartment was clean and had a lot of character and I felt totally at home.  I just loved my time there and walked everywhere and didn’t want to leave.  I’d love to go back for sure."
4574039,23803287,2014-12-10,23633061,Anna,"I had an amazing experience and stay at Tamara's designer loft! The location is great and Tamara couldn't have been a better host. She went above and beyond expectations and I would recommend staying here! 
Not only was she great, most of the furnishings were designed by her and are available for order through her company! "
4574039,24243940,2014-12-23,13749626,Taylour,"Tamara was kind enough to let me and a few professional friends of mine rent her space for a photo shoot, and I couldn't gush about this loft enough! Tamara was so sweet, and she met us there to let us in. We had such a blast exploring the unique and whimsical decor and I hope to stay here again for a non-business related trip, because somehow it was even more stunning in person. You certainly won't regret choosing this spot, the location is great and incredibly walkable as well. "
4574039,24313284,2014-12-25,21580308,Justin,Tamara's loft was by far the coolest airbnb location that I've ever used!  The space is amazing!  It's filled with extremely cool furniture and is truly unique. Amazing natural light and the speakers were great for music. It's within walking distance to a ton of great food and drink spots as well.
4574039,24675501,2015-01-01,24087024,Gina,I had a wonderful time staying at Tamara's designer loft! The place was just like the pictures. it was very beautiful  and unique place. The location was really close to the all the spots to visit. Also the speakers were great for music!
4574039,24797053,2015-01-02,3563334,Kyle,This place was whimsical and borderline mind blowing!  It's a perfect example of Seattle/ Tamara's eclectic style.  It had everything you could ever want or need for an overnight stay plus some!  So much to look at and play with.  Tamara was awesome and very attentive.  Ill definitely be staying here again.
4574039,25374894,2015-01-13,3160016,Eduardo,"I love it. Tamara is a very nice person, very helpful and kind. The place is amazing. Kind of a museum. Well located, and being so close of the Alaskan bridge is not a problem at all. I'd really enjoyed staying here. Thanks a lot..."
4574039,25551777,2015-01-19,9110391,Tiarra Sorte,"Wonderful experience from very first interaction. All questions were answered quickly, and professional from start to finish. The space.....wow. More than I even expected. I used the loft for a photgraphy event and it was perfect. My clients felt right at home and comfortable. Well stocked kitchen and amenities too.  I cannot thank you enough. I will absolutely be making reservations to stay here and using again for business. "
4574039,25698903,2015-01-23,21696728,Riley,Tamara was very attentive and answered all of the questions I had. Check in and check out were very simple. The space was pristine and I  will be staying at this location again in the future. Thank you Tamara!
4574039,26426347,2015-02-12,559703,Dylan,"Tamara's place was fantastic. If you want a great and huge loft space with amazing decor, then this is it.  Perfect in every respect.  I will definitely return.

Tamara was also super helpful and made check in as smooth as could be.  Highest recommendation on everything."
4574039,26640787,2015-02-16,16395846,Joey,The space is as beautiful as the pictures suggest. Tamara was a great and helpful host. Highly recommend. 
4574039,27559629,2015-03-07,9151058,Tane,"We rented this space for a three-person photoshoot and not for a vacation stay. The space was exactly as advertised but there were an unfortunate few elements of the interaction that dampened the experience. The first was that the nightly rate was listed at $245 but when you went to check out, the price jumped up to $300 with no explanation. Because we are a company that values honestly, we were upfront about the purpose of the rental, causing the rate to increase to $500 plus $60 for cleaning and airbnb's fee. In comparison to a studio, the rate of $500 is quite reasonable but the loft had not been cleaned. Additionally, I did not receive the exact location of the loft until one hour before our rental was to begin. From other reviews though, it seems that the tenants normally communicate quite well so hopefully this was just a one time thing. The tenants were also flexible with the hours of the rental, which was appreciated. Other than that, the interactions were pleasant and minimal. If you are wishing to to rent this for vacation purposes, it is important to note that the viaduct is literally right out the window and blocks most of the view. "
4574039,27593661,2015-03-08,12303480,Justin,"This was an amazing place. the location was perfect, close to anything you could want. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. "
4574039,27997637,2015-03-16,20729745,Leah,We had an incredible stay at Tamara's loft! It was even more beautiful in person and bigger than I had expected. Tamara was so welcoming and I would definitely recommend this to gorgeous loft to anyone.

4574039,28805131,2015-03-30,2869032,Mark,"Tamara and Jaqueline are great hosts. Communication was easy and they answered all my questions. Personally, the pictures only capture a part of how amazing the space is. From the size to the cool decor it has a lot of character. It was a wonderful place to stay and I am glad I found it. There are a lot of little shops around to visit (including a used guitar store with vintage guitars!!!!) and an underground sightseeing tour nearby. It was well worth the stay. Thank you again Tamara and Jaqueline:)"
4574039,30586692,2015-04-24,10218518,Cory,David had a great stay. Thank you!
4574039,31083684,2015-05-01,10218518,Cory,Tamara is great to work with and quick to respond.
4574039,31556654,2015-05-06,23147740,Jason,"I was met by Jacqueline who arrived 1-2 minutes after my cab dropped me off; super fast and convenient.  I got the tour of the place, how to connect to wifi, and was on my way.

I thought the inside of the loft was absolutely fantastic.  I could see shoring up in this place for a few weeks if I was working on a project and needed to breathe and think.  Only negative is that the potentially amazing view of the water is blocked by the highway, although it sounds as though they are taking that section of highway out.

Area is mildly sketchy immediately outside, but a block away you're into the cool kids area.  I may also not be use to all the weed smoking homeless people of Seattle.

Great pizza place, cafe, etc. nearby.  I also went on a nice run right from the loft through downtown.

When I'm back in Seattle I will definitely stay here again.  The interior design of this place was absolutely fantastic.  So fantastic, I'd have these folks consult on my next home."
4574039,33896262,2015-06-02,4133445,Matt,"Easy to get to, and check in/out was super easy.  The loft is huge and designed really cool.  Location was great, easy walk to downtown and all the fun places.  I would love to stay here again."
4574039,34778391,2015-06-12,17382599,Suzanne,"Tamara was an excellent host.  The apartment was exactly as described and was the perfect setting for the work we were doing.  The dining-out guide was very helpful and we were quite comfortable.  The neighborhood was great, in that downtown-Seattle-gritty kind of way (loads of character).  We would highly recommend Floor 13.  It is an exceptional space."
4574039,35801395,2015-06-22,6492490,Brian,"Tamara epitomizes excellence in Airbnb hosting. Her communication was swift, her pictures accurately presented the space (which was spacious, well lighted, and decorated with really cool furniture that she designs), and gladly accomodated storing my bags after checkout and before my flight. The immediate neighborhood is a little noisy and a little dirty, but that's a small price to pay for its proximity to Pioneer Square, the ball parks, Pike Place, etc.

There was a fully equiped kitchen, stocked bathroom (yay shampoo!) and plenty of clean towels and linens. Oh, and dare I forget to mention a disco ball in the main room?

All told, the loft space was comfortable, stylish, and light. 

Thank you for helping make my Seattle trip memorable. "
4574039,36658466,2015-06-30,29639433,Carl,"The host manager was helpful but not on site.  The Loft was in nice condition and was mostly representative of the description. The location was in the area we wanted to be, close to downtown Seattle. There were plenty of towels and supplies on hand. The problems we had is the location was a block away from the mission so there were lots of bums hanging around. When we arrived there were 3 bums sitting at the back door. Not the safest situation for kids. There is also no mention of the fact that there is no parking. We were told to park in a no parking zone but that we probably wouldn't get towed! There is a parking garage 2 blocks down that we were able to park in once we found it. Our car parked in the no parking zone had the back window busted in and ransacked. Cost me 600.00 to have fixed. Also no mention that the viaduct is right outside the front window. The noise was like the freeway was going through the living room all the time! We were going to move to a hotel but because gay pride week there were none available for the time frame we were there. We stuck it out and mostly had a good experience once we got used to it. "
4574039,37897214,2015-07-11,5081206,Christine,"Wow...just wow...
This was straight out of a magazine spread. The exposed brick, the water views, the amazing furniture, the cozy bed nooks. I would venture to say that these accommodations rival any hotel you could find in Seattle.
The location was fantastic, walking distance to most everything you need. Tamara was a great host and worked with us to ensure we got in and out easily. The book she provided with recommendations during our stay was also very much appreciated!
Thanks again, Tamara, for sharing your wonderful loft with us. We'll be back!"
4574039,38209920,2015-07-13,306640,Jason,"Tamara was very nice and receptive/accommodating for our early check-in and the place is as breath-taking as the pictures suggest, like staying in an art gallery. There was unfortunately very loud music that started in the adjacent studio around 1am, but they mostly quieted down when we knocked and asked. Other than that, it was a good stay."
4574039,38444353,2015-07-15,19976285,Jessica,"Tamara was an absolutely perfect host.  She was quick to communicate before my stay + walked me through everything I needed to know on arrival.

The loft is insanely beautiful.  It looks exactly as the images in the listing.  There is tons of natural light, space, + inspiring pieces of art.  Everything was clean + in working order.  

I loved that it was right around the corner from Pioneer Square + only a quick drive to Pike Market.

I definitely cannot wait to return to Seattle + have my next visit here!"
4574039,40178200,2015-07-28,36485419,Savanna,It states to be 275$ a night but when you go to book it jumps up to 430$ with no explanation. I do not think that it is worth 400$+ a night. It was nice but looks much bigger in the photos. The building is dirty and not a great location.
4574039,40553409,2015-08-01,25613110,Moon,"Tamara was able to accommodate an 'early check in' request from us since we arrived Seattle in mid-morning. The elevator was being serviced so we went to lunch and it was fixed in about an hour. The bed was really comfortable, bathroom toiletries were well-stocked. Seattle was experiencing a heat wave when we visited (90 plus degree mid-day) and the unit has no A/C, but we were pretty comfortable and no problem with it whatsoever - the unit itself is pretty cool, temperature wise. Neighbors and traffic can be a bit noisy.  If there were no elevated freeways in front of the building the view would be absolutely spectacular! Easily walkable to the pier and Pike place market.  Sterling was a big help on the day we left since the elevator broke again and he helped lift my husband in a wheelchair down 2 flight of stairs.  Really appreciate it! Our need is somewhat unique; most people will find it a great place to stay. "
4574039,41490497,2015-08-07,21749758,Nathalie,Tamara was great from the beginning. She responded promptly to all my questions and was very easy to work with. Her place was beautifully decorated and can comfortably fit around 3 people. She provided all the necessary amenities and she checked in during the middle of my stay to ask if I needed anything. I definitely would consider staying at her loft again the next time I'm in Seattle.
4574039,42500879,2015-08-13,4181677,Jessica,"Amazzzing place, practically convinced me to move back to Seattle! Tamara was great and helpful, let us do a last minute booking when we were in a bind."
4574039,42791457,2015-08-15,23034341,Sunnie,Excellent communication and hospitality.  Everything was as she said it would be.   The space is as large as it appears and very impressive.  
4574039,44250199,2015-08-24,39194581,Glenn,We arrived late because of flight delays. Driving in at night using Waze we thought we were lost. Parking is a premium. Tamara met us late with a smile. She didn't complain about the unavoidable delay and made us feel welcome. The place is huge. Loved the space. Quirky yet works well. There was a heat wave and no air conditioning but should be fine any other time. Close to lots of restaurants. At 1st I was put off by the homeless but then I calmed down. They were mostly keeping to themselves but the ones that engaged were polite. I had a good moral reset. 
4574039,45029260,2015-08-30,3011274,Jay,"This house was stunning. The pictures do not do it justice and Tamara was a wonderful host. We were greeted immediately upon arrival, she gave us a tour and even had a huge binder full of awesome spots to check out. All the design detail makes this spot a true gem to stay at and I look forward to coming back. "
4574039,45933596,2015-09-07,6904826,Christine,"You have to see this place in person! It was clean, spacious, and simply gorgeous. The decor is amazing and you can tell the owners are creative and have a sense of humor ;) Tamara was accommodating, helpful, and responsive. Parking can be tricky but you're so close to everything, you won't even need a car. I will definitely stay here again!"
4574039,47493882,2015-09-19,23187542,Katie & Hagan,"Tamara was a delightful host and partner; she was responsive, flexible, helpful,  and generally lovely to work with. Her space is gorgeous, and very much impressed our guests. All of the furniture and fixtures are one-of-a-kind and stunning. 

The building it's self is historic and cool, with a lot of different uses, and interesting people coming and going. It's an awesome neighborhood, as well. We'd highly recommend renting this loft for either events or just a fun, unique place to stay while visiting Seattle."
4574039,49692562,2015-10-05,31284246,Maria,"The listing was even better than the pictures! Beautiful, comfortable and a great location that fit all our needs. Tamara was a fabulous host and was very easy to contact. Would love to stay here again in the future!"
4574039,50356719,2015-10-11,23807617,Alan,The flat was perfect for our stay- even more impressive than the pictures. Tamara was very helpful & friendly and accommodated all of our needs.

4574039,51792215,2015-10-24,1090184,Brice,This loft was great! It fit perfectly for our needs and was just as described. Highly recommended.
4574039,53738625,2015-11-11,3711286,New,The host canceled this reservation 247 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4574039,54780900,2015-11-23,48772825,Derrick,"Tamara was there to greet me when I arrived. She was friendly and showed me around, while giving me the keys. The loft is really a unique space. One of a kind furniture throughout and incredibly high ceilings. It is right downtown and walking distance from the ferries. Definitely has a downtown vibe in location and atmosphere. Perfect for couple's without children. "
4574039,55495773,2015-12-01,24750484,Shelby,"I absolutely loved staying at Tamara's place. It was every bit as gorgeous as the pictures, and they were great with communication. Would definitely recommend! "
4574039,57389028,2015-12-25,2506612,Devin,"Unbelievably beautiful loft right in the heart of Pioneer Square.  Feels bigger than it looks in the pictures.  Like spending the night in a designer furniture studio.  A truly unique experience.  Tamara went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable.  A flexible, friendly host.  Can't wait to go back!"
4574039,58074416,2015-12-31,1027194,Manuel,The apartment was just as described. It was clean and the hosts were very welcoming.

2238105,10502852,2014-02-22,2996405,Shirag,Thanks Melanie & Brian for a wonderful stay! Everything was incredibly well organized and ready when I got there. Your open and timely communication was just icing on the cake!
2238105,10727396,2014-03-04,414366,Kelly,"Melanie and Brian's place is the perfect spot for a fun weekend in Seattle. Check-in was smooth and easy, the room was clean and the location is great! Hope to return at some point!"
2238105,10809195,2014-03-08,5775807,David,Comfortable. Quiet. Great location. Good value.
2238105,10886136,2014-03-11,3609994,Kelly,"Had a great time at Melanie and Brian's! Clean, quaint, quiet, bright. We rode our bikes all through Fremont and Ballard from there. Awesome stay! "
2238105,10988434,2014-03-16,12681367,Tamara,"Melanie and Brian's cottage is great! It is super cute and is in a great location. (Not far from coffee shops, restaurants, and Trader Joe's!) We also found it very easy to use as far as coming & going, parking, etc. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to anyone staying in the area! Melanie and Brian are very accommodating. "
2238105,11229803,2014-03-25,2817152,Kathryn,"This was a great stay! Melanie and Brian were very easy to get in touch with and the guidelines for the cottage were straightforward. We arrived very late at night so they keypad lock made our arrival easy for all. Gravy the Golden, who we met on our last day, is just delightful and filled our doggie fix since we left ours at home.
The cottage is very private (tucked behind the main house) and quiet and the inside is neat and clean. We found the bed comfortable and used the electric kettle for tea several times. The bathroom has a toilet, sink, and shower with great water pressure. 
The cottage is in a great location, a quiet street just a block or so from a little breakfast restaurant and also a bar with tasty food. For people like me who inevitably forget to bring several things, Fred Meyer is another couple blocks away. There is plenty of free street parking in front of the house. Just a short walk, ride, or drive to anywhere you might want to go.
This was perfect for our needs (house hunting in the surrounding area) and we would absolutely stay again!
"
2238105,11513451,2014-04-06,373702,Vivian,"Our 3 day stay at the cottage was very nice. It is clean, convenient to pretty much everything, quiet, and totally worth the value.  The bed was comfortable, space just right for 2, bathroom was nicely supplied w/ toiletries and enough towels for our stay. Melanie was easy to communicate with throughout. Instructions were straightforward and appreciated the ease of the key coded door. Would stay again. Thank you! "
2238105,12005768,2014-04-21,12989910,Janine,"Thank you Melanie and Brian for a very nice, comfy stay. I enjoyed the cottage. It looked exactly like it did in the pictures and Melanie, your description of the neighborhood and room is spot on. The cottage interior is very fun and inviting. Everything was clean, both inside and out. I liked the neighborhood; it had lots of places to walk to. I will definitely let me friends know about the cottage if they are traveling to Seattle. Thanks again for a lovely stay. :)"
2238105,12250143,2014-04-27,13756860,Kendra,"We had a great time in the Modern Ballard/Fremont Cottage. They were super friendly, hospitable, and it was a great location for accessing the city."
2238105,13134536,2014-05-20,10256206,Maureen,"
Everything looked just like it did in the pictures, neat, clean, new and bright. We stayed 2 weeks while visiting our daughter in the area. The owners were very helpful even if we never saw them! They answered our questions promptly via email. The area is very quiet and the perfect Seattle weather made this trip unforgettable. "
2238105,13507066,2014-05-29,13854630,Joey,The cottage was awesome and central to everything! Great hosts. I would recommend to anyone looking for a quiet stay in seattle. 
2238105,13805273,2014-06-04,16068932,Jennie,"We had a great experience staying at Melanie and Brian's place. The room was clean and adorable and the backyard is quite charming. Melanie and Brian left us local beers, chocolate, and other snacks, which we enjoyed. We also used the bike that comes with the place one day during our visit. Their Golden Retriever Gravy is friendly and we enjoyed saying hello to her when we walked by the main house.

The location was perfect. I was in town for a meeting and was able to get downtown easily. Ballard is also a close walk and we enjoyed the stroll that direction to check out the cute shops and restaurants."
2238105,14436729,2014-06-19,10655266,Linh,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we really enjoyed it.  Melanie is a great communicator and very responsive before and during our stay. Instructions to enjoy the cottage was clear. We arrived quite late in the early hours of the morning due to flight delay.  Her instructions were clear and allowed us to find the place and get inside the cottage quietly, with no disturbance.  

The cottage is clean, modern and convenient as described. We love the snacks and drinks in the fridge.  Location is great, within walking distance to Ballard or Fremont. Neighborhood is quiet and nice for a quiet stroll. "
2238105,14955741,2014-06-30,13904554,Stephanie,"My husband and I had a wonderful time staying at Melanie and Brian's place.  It was clean, modern, comfortable and pretty much as advertised.  I loved that we could walk both to Ballard and Fremont within about 8-10 minutes.  The neighborhood was quiet and the unit itself was surrounded by trees.  We would gladly stay here again. "
2238105,15398050,2014-07-08,14906715,Kevin,"We had a fantastic stay at Melanie and Brian's cottage. The communication was very clear, helpful, and welcoming. The number-code lock made it so easy to check in and check out effortlessly. The cottage was adorable, clean, comfortable, and extremely quiet. And the location is excellent for exploring Ballard and Fremont. My friend who lives in Seattle was so impressed when she saw the place that she started looking through the real estate listings to see if she could find something similar in the neighborhood. Thank you Melanie and Brian!"
2238105,15750162,2014-07-15,8627746,Marissa,We had a great stay here! Cozy and comfy cottage - perfect for our trip to Seattle.  Thanks Melanie and Brian! 
2238105,16397955,2014-07-27,14656151,Tammy,We loved the cottage. It was comfortable and very cozy. The neighborhood was very nice and friendly. The location was great with stores and restaurants within walking distance.  Thank you Melanie and Brian for being such great hosts.  We hope to visit Seattle again in the near future.
2238105,16970956,2014-08-05,5885920,Terri,"I never met Melanie or Brian during my 5-night stay at the cottage, but I didn't need to -- the check-in instructions i rec'd in advance were clear, and the place was ready for me. I love this cottage! Originally I was to be there with another person, and it might have felt a bit tight (where to put the 2nd suitcase?), but I ended up there by myself, and it was perfect for one. I know Seattle well, and I like this neighborhood between Fremont and Ballard -- more restaurants, pubs, and coffeehouses than you can shake a stick at, all within a 15-min or so walk. A huge plus in my book is that this street is very quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again."
2238105,17753101,2014-08-17,13974166,Olivia,A really great little place in a great location; awesome stuff within walking distance and a very cute dog we wish we saw more of! The hosts even left beer and candy for us... Recommended. 
2238105,18232238,2014-08-24,15150912,Arielle,We had a fantastic trip. We found the cottage to be cozy for two and conveniently located near all of our interests. We can't recommend this listing enough! Melanie and Brian were both super friendly and very accommodating.. And Gravy is the cutest Golden you'll ever meet! We loved this location so much that we're trying to find a place to move nearby. If we're not settled in Seattle by next summer we will definitely be coming back! 
2238105,18785613,2014-09-01,14823596,Melissa,"Melanie was great at communicating with me about the best places to check out in Seattle and quick to send stay instructions. Everything was super easy to follow and I didn't have to worry about anything. 
The cottage had all the basics (fridge, water boiler, bed, restroom, towels, bike if you need it). Melanie also included some tea/coffee and snacks (there was also some energy drinks, water, and beer in the fridge) for our stay so that was pretty awesome! 
Only thing that was a bummer was there was no closet or drawer so I had to literally live out of my suitcase. 
Would definitely recommend and want to stay here again!"
2238105,19118707,2014-09-07,10544946,Cory,Melanie was an excellent host. We were updated several days in advance on how to get into the space as well as given specific directions. She gave us great advice on hikes and restaurants to eat at. We would definitely stay here again when we come back to the area. 
2238105,19720286,2014-09-17,8153618,Lauren,"We didn't have a chance to meet, but did have a wonderful stay. The cottage had everything we needed and the location was terrific. We would definitely recommend to others!"
2238105,20026883,2014-09-22,15198471,Johnny,"The room is a small but cozy cottage in the backyard of the hosts' house. While fairly small, it is private, quiet, and comfortable for up to two average size people. The hosts did a good job setting it up in a way that makes it feel cozy and easy to use. I never actually met Melanie or Brian but they were quick to respond and provided all the info I needed to check in and out. Also, I didn't need to contact them because everything was in place, clean, and in working order. They stocked the fridge with some beer and sparkling water, and provided a basket with snacks, as well as a bottle of wine and some instant coffee and tea...there is a small pitcher for heating up water. 
There is no kitchen area or microwave, and the fridge is pretty small and doesn't make ""useable"" ice, so plan to dine out or pack a cooler with snacks that don't need to be cooked.
The area has many dining options. There is a great breakfast spot called ""The Dish"" close by, (2 min walk) as well as many other restaurants, bars, and coffee shops in the area within walking distance. 
Parking was a breeze! So many neighborhoods in Seattle are painful to park in but there were at least 5 spots on the street in front of the house at all times. 
I highly recommend this BnB for ease of use, accessibility, neighborhood, privacy, and comfort. 
I would not recommend it for large or very tall people, or families with kids. "
2238105,20245390,2014-09-26,19257607,Heidi,Had an amazing time in this modern cottage. Loved the neighborhood and the ease of getting around. First time visiting Seattle and I can't wait to come back. So glad I booked with Melanie and Brian over a hotel in the city.
2238105,20528581,2014-09-30,7536662,Sue,"Melanie responded to my request to stay there promptly and provided clear directions and instructions for how to access the property.  Even though my arrival was later than expected, she and Brian were most hospitable and helpful.  The cottage was accurately described and shown  online.
"
2238105,21216773,2014-10-13,4694920,Warren,"The place was great and the hosts were extremely welcoming and respectful of our own privacy! The cottage is extremely cozy, and only minutes away from the freeway! The host was even kind enough to lend me a card reader when I had forgotten to bring one. Thank you guys so much!

Advice: Set the heater to 55 degrees and you will have no overheating issues! "
2238105,22613345,2014-11-10,23000695,Sharon,"Accommodations were clean, quiet and comfortable in a pleasant neighborhood close to public transportation, restaurants and personal shopping needs.
Host family was eager to please."
2238105,22964242,2014-11-18,23365599,Joe,Great place and great location. The instructions I received were very clear and they gave me all the info I needed. It was my first experience with airbnb and it definitely did not disappoint!
2238105,23397911,2014-11-30,5822176,Alan,"A nice little place. Great for a single but good for two. Tucked away, private and cosy. Great to sleep and wash but listed if you wanted to linger during the day. But why would you do that as Seattle is on the door step. Area is safe and Convient. Saw my hosts at the window and Gravy only barked once. I would stay there again, thanks Melanie and Brian"
2238105,23734954,2014-12-08,11600318,Eduardo,"Great little spot! Brian and Melanie provided a perfect guide to using the space and even though the cottage is in the backyard it feels like a private little home. 

"
2238105,24722548,2015-01-02,23078369,Shayna,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying in this cute little space last week. The process from beginning to end was clear, and our hosts—although never having met them—seemed very nice and communicative as needed in getting set up. All the info we needed in order to use the space was outlined very clearly, and there were no surprises as everything was as advertised. Everything was clean and very tidy. The space itself is small, but perfect for two people to refresh and use as a homebase. We were out-and-about the city most of the days, and found a comfortable space waiting for us upon return each evening, in a nice quiet neighborhood. Overall, we couldn't have asked for a better space or hosts while we were in Seattle!"
2238105,25796730,2015-01-26,13093093,Karen,"This was a great place to stay.  The neighborhood was terrific, just to walk around in, find restaurants and coffee shops, and other sightseeing.  Melanie and Brian provided great recommendations along those lines - definitely check out the ""Guidebook"" (annotated map on the listing).  The space was small but comfy and tidy and I really enjoyed the ""homey"" feel of the space and neighborhood.  "
2238105,26199175,2015-02-06,113926,Elizabeth,"Melanie and Brian's cottage is everything promised - fresh, efficient, quiet and private in a very fun and walkable part of Seattle - AND within a 20min drive to every other part of Seattle. They are generous (that stocked fridge?!) and welcoming hosts that are highly respectful of the privacy of their guests. A great go-to for 1-2 people for a long or short visit to Seattle.
"
2238105,26541488,2015-02-15,21382509,Ben,"We stayed at Melanie and Brian's cottage for four nights in mid February. It was a great location, part way between Ballard and Fremont, super easy to physically get into the cottage without having to use a key, and very convenient and quiet. We were able to take advantage of the unusually sunny weather and walk to both Ballard and Fremont to find good food and drinks. The space itself was small, but cozy and a great place to crash each night. We came to Seattle for a concert downtown and the location was an easy 10 minute drive using Highway 99 into the heart of downtown. We never saw our hosts, but we're sure they would have been around if we needed anything. "
2238105,27017537,2015-02-23,12133237,Natalie,"We loved staying in Melanie and Brian's little cottage! It was perfect for two people. It is extremely small, but is VERY cozy, nice, and clean. We had everything we needed and were comfortable. Melanie and Brian were available if we needed them, but they really just gave us our space and made us feel like we were staying in our own private area. I asked them a couple of questions about the cottage and where to eat while we were there and they responded immediately. Their dog, Gravy, is precious and very friendly. The neighborhood was right in the middle of everything we were wanting to do while in Seattle and felt very safe. Fremont and Ballard are both really fun and this is right in between. Melanie and Brian recommended the Sunday Farmers Market in Ballard which was awesome. Downtown was only about a 10 minute drive. Parking outside of the cottage was always hassle free. Overall, this cottage was quaint, clean, and easy! Check in and check out were a breeze. Thanks, Melanie and Brian!"
2238105,27753939,2015-03-10,3781242,Suzanne,The reservation was canceled 58 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2238105,27950400,2015-03-15,11380160,Jesse,"Clean, private, well located. Stayed  here for a week and it was perfect for what I needed. Even had a couple snacks and beers and a bottle of wine to enjoy. Shower was hot and the heater worked well as did the mini fridge. Wifi was top notch, had no problem streaming netflix at night. Don't plan on making any food while staying here but there is an awesome bbq place a block around the corner. 10/10 would stay again"
2238105,28411298,2015-03-23,23955605,Lara,"After exploring Seattle all day, the cottage was exactly what we needed-a clean, quiet, and cozy place to recap our day and relax.  Restaurants, cafes, and bars are plentiful in the area and are easy to access via walking, buses, Uber, and Car-2-Go.  The cottage had enough amenities to get us by for the five days we were there and the hosts were quick to respond to any inquiries we had.  It was my first trip to Seattle and by day 5 I felt like I lived there. Great experience. "
2238105,29512269,2015-04-08,23300958,Hannah,Very nice little private space in a great neighborhood. Everything was as described and ready for our arrival. Melanie was easy to reach with any questions but gave us space. Easy access to busses and to walk to places in Ballard and Fremont. 
2238105,30391205,2015-04-21,28516407,Julie,"Melanie and Brian have a gem of a vacation rental:)

It was our own private backyard cottage! I loved their style, their little treats left for us and the warm very homey feeling when you come in. Truly our home away from home:) Thank you for sharing your home with us! We will be back! "
2238105,33245643,2015-05-26,16644572,Deborah,"Melanie & Brian's cottage was simply perfect for my several day stay in Seattle. The description was completely accurate!

The location was easy to find and very convenient. Restaurants, grocery stores, public transportation and trails were all within walking distance.

Melanie & Brian thoughtfully stocked a few yummy snacks which was most appreciated after travelling. 

The bed was super comfortable and I slept really well as it was so quiet. The cottage interior temperature was easy & super fast to heat up/cool down as the weather fluctuated over the long weekend. The shower had great pressure and it was a treat to not have to crouch down to get under the shower head (I'm tall).

My stay was relaxed, too short, and I look forward to a repeat stay. Thank you, thank you for making it a great mini-vacation!
-Deborah"
2238105,33818972,2015-06-01,1798214,Peter & Kathryn,"Melanie and Brian's cottage was just what we expected -- a cozy, simple space that served its purpose as a comfortable crash pad while we spent most of our time exploring Seattle. The hosts provided a great amount of detail prior to our arrival, along with recommendations for dining and going out -- which we appreciated, and used. The bed was comfortable, the shower was nice and hot, and the location worked well for us. It's a bit of a walk to either Fremont or Ballard (20 min either way), and we used Car2Go and Uber when we didn't feel like making the treks. All in all, a fine place to stay in Seattle that's close to a lot of great stuff, with considerate hosts who are responsive, friendly, and flexible. We recommend it."
2238105,34653616,2015-06-10,28308223,Tine,"Seattle is a wonderful place as is the space of Melanie and Brian. For us it was the perfect spot for our time at the city. The neighborhood is so quiet – we heard chicken in the backyard somewhere. The cottage was as described – easy to find, clean, quiet and cozy and stuffed with a few goodies like tea, coffee and snacks. We found everything what we needed like dining places and grocery stores in the neighborhood and drove around the city by bus which was easy and convenient.  We were thankful for the space Melanie and Brian gave us and would love to come back some day. Thanks so much!"
2238105,35369399,2015-06-18,681006,Wendy,"Location was great about a mile from both Fremont and Ballard, easy uber distance! Checkin and checkout was a breeze and Melanie and Brian gave great suggestions on where to visit and eat in Seattle. Had a bulb that burned out that was very quickly and promptly replaced! Would recommend for two people, bathroom is small but functional. "
2238105,35768471,2015-06-22,20474495,Joan,"Melanie and Brian are great host, lots of recommendations for restaurants and things to do.  Loved their cottage, it has everything you need to make your stay perfect.  Great location, right  in the middle of Ballard/Fremont, easy to walk anywhere from the house.  Would stay there again on our next trip to Seattle, had a great time."
2238105,36652757,2015-06-30,6395129,Neil,"The communication from Melanie & Brian ahead of time was fantastic.   Checking-in was a breeze, even though we got in after 10 PM.  The neighborhood is AMAZING.  Both Ballard and Fremont are walkable.  

The space is exactly as listed.  Though it's small, we never felt cramped.  If you spend your days in and around Seattle, this is the perfect retreat at the end of the day."
2238105,37228562,2015-07-05,22124840,Kelsey,"We had such a great time staying at Melanie and Brian's cottage! It was incredibly convenient to walk to Fremont and Ballard, and a short drive to anywhere else we wanted to visit.  Their recommendations for restaurants and bars in the area were great as well! We would definitely recommend staying here on your next Seattle trip."
2238105,37780259,2015-07-10,24352383,Naman,"Melanie and Brian were incredibly friendly and accomodating! The cottage is absolutely gorgeous, very homey and exceeded our expectations by far. The sunlight in the room was nice to have as well, and on warm nights we were able to open it up and have that cool Seattle breeze flow in. Both hosts were great in sharing their favorite local hotspots, both restaurants and bars that my boyfriend and I absolutely loved! We truly feel like we got the full Seattle experience from the suggestions and accommodation that we were provided with. The neighborhood is nice and quaint and if you're a dog lover like we were, they have an adorable Golden named Gravy that was just as accepting of us. The room also had a bicycle that you could take out in the neighborhood, along with books, magazines, cards, tea, coffee, wine, etc for entertainment. Can't beat the price for the hospitality and housing we were provided with-- highly recommended! "
2238105,39149427,2015-07-21,273635,Diana & Jon,"The cottage is in a great location between Fremont & Ballard. The space is perfect for a couple and Melanie/Brian were attentive to our questions. We had a rather hot weekend in Seattle and we appreciated the fans in the cottage. The huge plus is the electronic lock. We had a very late arrival and it was nice not to have to bother our hosts to check-in. All in all, we highly recommend the cottage."
2238105,40499877,2015-07-31,35090930,Mark,"I stayed at Melanie and Brian's cottage for 9 nights while transitioning to a new apartment after a move to Seattle. The space was absolutely perfect for my needs: a comfortable bed, a mini fridge, and a fully functional bathroom. It's very minimal, but terrific if you just need a place to call home base. The check-in/out process was very simple with electronic access, and the grounds/neighborhood were great. I can't think of a single thing to criticize.

The bicycle that was provided was very useful for checking out the area and riding along the Burke-Gilman trail, and the beers included in the fridge were clutch after some long days apartment hunting. I walked almost everywhere-- trying somewhere new each time-- and there were more bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and grocery stores than I had time for in 9 nights.

Melanie and Brian were very accommodating and just extremely friendly and pleasant people overall (even their dog was sweet!).

I can't recommend this place enough if you need a space to rest your head in Fremont for 1-2 people. "
2238105,41697912,2015-08-08,359390,Martin,"Love this place. Perfect for one or two people, close to Ballard and lots of nice restaurants and things to do. Melanie and Brian are super hosts -- absolutely recommend to others."

The place is in a great location, being able to walk to both fremont and ballard,  and we enjoyed checking out the local bars etc.   Brian and Melainie communications were excellent, checking everything was OK during our stay.  They also provided lots of tips for places to eat / drink before we arrived.  The room itself was great.  If we are ever in the area again we'll be staying here!"
2238105,45949238,2015-09-07,37431747,Danielle,Neighborhood was very pretty and quiet. Easy to get around. Hosts were very welcoming and had great recommendations. The cottage is quaint and the bed is comfortable.

In de koelkast stond een fleswijn klaar en bier en iets lekkers voor bij de koffie of thee.
Het was tevens op loopastand van een hele leuke straat, namelijk Fremont str."
2238105,47898000,2015-09-21,44217574,Michael,"My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Melanie & Brian's cottage. The neighborhood was quiet, and close enough to the center of Seattle that it wasn't an inconvenience commuting the city via Uber. ($10-$12 to downtown). I didn't have the pleasure of meeting either of our hosts, but they made sure that accessing the property was easy, that the room was clean, and that we had everything we needed."

2238105,54729939,2015-11-23,12264713,Autumn,"I couldn't recommend this little cottage enough! It is in a great location between Ballard and Fremont as described. Melanie and Brian were super helpful both in logistics around response times and arrival, but also how to get the most out of the area. I got a week free at CorePower yoga down the road, toured the amazing coffee shops in the area, and ate some amazing food and had great drinks all locally. The cottage is self contained, quiet, and super comfortable/cute. Street parking is readily available and the pad locked door/entrance is really convenient. I felt totally at home, and this is coming from a former Seattleite. Although I only briefly met Melanie (passing through and on the phone so just waving), they were unbelievably helpful and kind. Definitely stay here if you're reading reviews to help make up your mind!"
2238105,56038234,2015-12-08,32110257,Lisa,"Melanie and Brian are the best hosts. They are available if needed but invisible if not needed.

They seem to be super nice folks and provided great information about the area. The location is excellent and the cottage is exactly as the pictures represent. It's clean, cute, quiet and had everything I needed, and the heater kept the room toasty and warm. There's a mini fridge with nice goodies inside. The bed is comfortable and the bathroom, although small, functions well and the shower has good water pressure. There was always street parking available during my visit.
My daughter lives in Seattle so I will be back often, and I will definitely stay in Melanie and Brain's cottage!"

We loved it so much the first night we decided to walk to the local grocery and buy food to cook on the grill. We watched the sunset over Seattle, AMAZING views of all of Seattle. We would highly recommend this place to everyone!!!!!!"

The building felt pretty high-end, and the view from the apartment was nice. We were there for Memorial Day weekend, and apart from Saturday night, there was plenty of street parking available. Bryon was very accomodating and flexible regarding our check-in and check-out times, and responsive at all times. Would definitely stay here again!"
6033201,34970904,2015-06-14,23298303,Hilary,"We had a wonderful stay at Bryon's condo! The condo looked exactly like the pictures - if not better. The views were absolutely stunning and the rooftop area was a huge plus. The building was in a great location for walking around and exploring the city.

6033201,36398158,2015-06-28,7966401,Michelle,"From my first communication with Bryon I knew I had selected the right place and host for our trip to Seattle

Not only was the condo  EXACTLY as advertised and gorgeous (not to mention awesome location!) but Bryon was so accommodating and responsive to all of my questions . I'm a bit of an A-type personality and was planning a surprise weekend for my BF so leading up to the trip I was very focused on ensuring our arrival would be smooth and hassle free - which it was! Bryon was patient and very communicative and even let us enjoy a very late check out on Sunday so we could make the most of our time in city before our late night flight

WE loved Seattle and would def come back and I would not hesitate to reach out to Bryon again if his place was still available. Fantastic experience all around. One of my best on AirBNB so far

Photos are true to the actual space. The rooftop deck was stunning during the day and night. 
His local food recommendations were great!The apartment was spotless!
 We would definitely come back here!"

His apartment was spotless, looks just like the photos and has many amenities to make the trip comfortable. Extra perk is the amazing roof deck!

The condo is beautifully decorated and so comfortable. Even though we arrived late, Bryon met us and showed us around the condo and left clear instructions. He provided dining suggestions in the neighborhood as well as guide books that were very helpful. The building has an amazing roof top deck with amazing views, which we took advantage of during our stay. Overall great experience and Bryon is a fabulous host."

I thought, from the photos that the kitchen and dining area open to a private balcony but those are just photos of the kitchen on the shared roof deck. Other than that surprise, we had a lovely stay. Bryon made things easy, he left water for us in the fridge which was nice and everything was impeccably clean.  "
6033201,44929624,2015-08-30,21973462,Stephen,"The unit was great- all the amenities. Byron was a great host and ensure to forward local events happening in the area. Great location for walking down to the water, or downtown in about 15 min.

There's also a great rooftop for entertaining friends in the area. Many local eats are around neighboring blocks and you're never out of reach of great food and drinks."

6033201,51338704,2015-10-19,45164271,Shawn,"We really enjoyed our stay in Bryon's condo. We're very familiar with Seattle, having been residents for 2 years up there, and his condo's location is awesome. It was walking distance to almost everywhere you'd want to see/visit and there are lots of dining and bar options in the Belltown neighborhood. Our favorite part by far was the fantastic rooftop area where we enjoyed the view and a glass of wine and (which we picked up on our trips to Pike Place Market..conveniently close by) a couple times during our stay. The condo was exactly as described and was very clean, which is very important to both of us. We would absolutely stay here again! Thanks, Bryon!"

Bus station is near the apartment, also uber is very convenient in Seattle.
There is a good place for brunch Tilikum place cafe. You should try it."

The kitchen was well stocked with the things we needed. Checking in was easy and the bus runs right in front of the complex. 

I highly recommend this sweet studio instead of staying at a high cost hotel."

Both hosts seemed friendly and helpful and made me feel welcome at their rental unit. This unit is located in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle (Yuppie Central) and there are many amenities very near the unit. E.g., there is a QFC supermarket about a 5-minute walk from the unit and a great number of restaurants, cafes, bakeries, specialty shops, etc., within a very short walk. The rental unit is a studio but it has a large central window that opens wide and makes the unit feel much larger and more airy than is the vibe for most studio apartments. The apartment building also has a great roof deck with several BBQ grills and a really nice view of Puget Sound. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would highly recommend this unit to other Airbnb renters. "
7922581,48345982,2015-09-25,14654014,Carrie,"Didn't get the pleasure of meeting Diane + Mack, but the space was well kept and they're certainly thoughtful hosts. The apartment is in a very newly constructed building, and in a fantastic location! "
7922581,48928730,2015-09-29,26798455,David,"Diane and Mack were very thorough in communicating arrangements for arrival and Mack proved a very enthusiastic host when I met him as arranged near the apartment. The flat was as described and in an excellent situation. Mack pointed out a really good coffee place, tucked away down the  side street, that I might otherwise have missed and generally offered helpful answers to any questions I had."
7922581,49178272,2015-10-01,22208406,Kevin,"I had a great experience in this unit. It was clean, well-appointed, and in a modern new building with great amenities. Hope to be back some day!"
7922581,49526697,2015-10-04,43369725,Emily,"The apartment is great!  Super comfortable, safe, clean, AWESOME location. I especially enjoyed the bath tub! Diane & Mack had excellent communication and were personable and kind with each message exchange.  I didn't get to meet them but Mack's mother was so sweet and helped me carry all my stuff when I was too sick to manage! Made me feel very comfortable with them :) highly recommended"
7922581,49743875,2015-10-05,45528612,Alissa,"We had a great time in this rental. The location was amazing, and the room was clean, stylish, and very comfortable. We will definitely be staying here again!"
7922581,49921762,2015-10-07,43968587,Jill And Greg,"Diane and Mack were awesome! We had originally wanted to stay in another one of their locations but it got booked before we could book it...we were so pleased then, that Diane and Mack reached out and told us about this place as an alternative. 

Diane met us when we arrived and gave us all the instructions we would need.  The place was very clean and super comfortable!  Perfect spot to stay in and in a great location! 

We'd definitely stay here again should we return. 

As an added bonus - they left us chocolate for when we arrived :) 

Thanks!"
7922581,50207154,2015-10-10,44429970,Samantha,"Diane and Mack were very accommodating and the apartment was wonderful. The rooftop deck had the most amazing view and you just can't bet the location. If we're ever in Seattle again we'll make sure to find Diane and Mack's listings.

7922581,50524340,2015-10-12,12364442,Katie,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Diane and Mack's apartment this past weekend. It was just what we wanted. You can walk to bar's, restaurants, and downtown Seattle from this location. The apartment was very nice and had everything that we needed. The building was very secure, we parked our rental car in the garage with no problems (we walked everywhere and did not move the car all weekend). We would stay here again anytime!  "
7922581,50797585,2015-10-14,3552368,Jerry And Kamil,"My experience at Diane and Mack's apartment was superb. Communication was great from the get go, location can't be beat, and the flat itself was clean, very well-equipped, and more roomy than you might image a studio apartment being. Really appreciated the two added bonuses: Use of gym downstairs and free rein to enjoy what was in the fridge and cupboards. Would definitely book again without hesitation! "
7922581,50999667,2015-10-16,7319076,Damon,"Great place, great location, super easy and efficient.  Exactly what I needed for a work trip in Seattle.  Thanks guys for an excellent stay! "
7922581,51485966,2015-10-20,11428633,Nancy,"We never met Diane or Mack but they communicated very specific instructions as to how to find their place and the key via texts. They were very good at following up with any questions we had. The apartment was exactly how it was described. The place overlooks a beautiful courtyard and noise was never a problem.
The location was perfect! We walked most of the time and Uber and  public transportation were easy to access.
We hope this place will be available the next time we are in Seattle!"
7922581,51953820,2015-10-25,3976117,Clara,"We had an amazing time. Diane and Mack's spacious studio was perfect for our trip to Seattle. The rooftop view and patio space are such a great bonus to the already perfect apartment. 
Location, Location, location ... The apartment is in Capitol Hill which was perfect. Easy access to the city either by walking or public transit. Lot's of walking distance bars, restaurants and grocery stores.
The studio is spacious and very comfortable. Very clean and has all the amenities one could need. 
Diane and Mack were really helpful throughout the entire process as well. I highly recommend staying at one of their properties. "
7922581,52267491,2015-10-27,19782117,Shea,"Clean, efficient, seamless, great location, and wifi - all you could ask for in an AirBnB listing!"
7922581,52553262,2015-10-30,4080962,Luke,"Mack was a great host. He was communicative and friendly, and even let me check in early.

7922581,52868358,2015-11-02,17045496,Scott,Great trip in a great city. The apt location is perfect for exploring Capitol Hill. Everything was as to be expected. Would stay here again. 
7922581,53408841,2015-11-08,32053083,Caitlin,Great apartment with everything you need for a perfect weekend in Seattle.  The hosts were super accommodating and made the check in/check out process very clear.  They even helped me get back a clothing item I left behind - couldn't have been nicer!
7922581,53835070,2015-11-13,3716333,Peter,"Perfect Airbnb experience from start to finish. Hosts are attentive and informative, the apartment is as described  - clean, quiet and in a great location. Broadway is a lot of fun with lots of drinking & eating options. I would definitely stay here again if the opportunity arises. "
7922581,54493635,2015-11-20,45852827,Kyle,Mack was very helpful in communicating the details for check in. They have a very nice and convenient rental unit. We had a great stay! Highly recommended!
7922581,54779095,2015-11-23,5537837,Riley,The location was absolutely perfect for a tourist to Seattle. Great neighborhood restaurants and ton to do. Good communication from host and well planned. 
7922581,55162831,2015-11-28,19731053,Justin,"Mack was incredibly kind to me, and I was very quickly able to get into the apartment and leave the apartment timely. The space was beautifully maintained, and I couldn't imagine a better space for my visit. When I return to Seattle to see my friends, I hope to stay in his space again. "
7922581,55461976,2015-12-01,34779558,Carrie,"Mack was great at communication!  We ended up coming several hours earlier than we thought, and emailed to ask if that was OK.  He texted that the cleaning crew was not quite done yet, then texted again the moment they were!  Everything was very clean, and plenty spacious for a studio!  Huge deep bathtub, puffy white towels - the works!  He texted a reminder of the check out time, and I let him know when we were out.

The apartment is within a 2 minute walk of the awesome Vivace coffee, several Thai places, and just a few blocks away from several bars and clubs.  We walked to REI in about 20 minutes on a free afternoon.  You can get to everything from here!

Highly recommended!"
7922581,55548382,2015-12-01,4669248,Lucas,"Mack and Sophia's place is just as described. It was clean, comfortable, and had super easy access to one of Seattle's best neighborhoods. I'd definitely stay here again. "
7922581,55684101,2015-12-04,935380,Winston,"Everything was accurately described and pictured. Very convenient location to everything I needed including a grocery store w a great selection of wine. The apartment was tidy and even had a stash of coffee, filters, and creamer!!! What a treat after a long test day. The apartment building is very chic. The roof top should not be missed. Fire pit and amazing 360 degree views of the city. I absolutely will stay there the next time I'm in town. The couple of times I contacted them for questions, they were immediately answered. Excellent experience. I would like to point out that it is clear on the description that there isn't a hair dryer. I, unfortunately, in my hasty manner did not see that so was surprised to not find one. But I went to the corner drug store and bought a $15 one. No big deal. Just thought I'd point that out. :) "
7922581,55868431,2015-12-06,4669248,Lucas,Second time at Mack's and Sophia's. Overall an amazing spot!
7922581,56125582,2015-12-09,19473632,Terrence & Mike,The Listing is exactly as described.  The unit was perfect for two.  I would be happy to stay here again.  We walked every where in Capitol Hill and staying here made it easy.
7922581,56508504,2015-12-14,499411,Ana,"This apartment was absolutely lovely. It features security guards, secured entry, a beautiful and expansive rooftop deck, multiple common rooms with large sofas, full kitchens and tvs (one even had a fireplace!). Great location, can walk to the excellent Vivace for your morning coffee and Einstein Bagel is right around the corner for a quick breakfast. There's also a grocery store nearby and everything else is a quick uber/lyft ride away. "
2522091,11233109,2014-03-25,13170238,Danny,"My stay at the casa on alki was wonderful!  Not only does it boast one of the most impressive views of the Sound and the Olympic Mountains but the lovely patio and fascinating glass wind sculpture capture the whimsical nature of a true vacation in the best possible way.
My girlfriend and I enjoyed the spacious and lovely apartment with it's fresh furnishings, large kitchen island (with everything you would ever need) tasteful art and comfy couches. 
The bed was great, the bathroom was clean and also wonderfully decorated.  Shells, sea stars, as if you needed to be reminded that you were in a northwest paradise.  
Privacy is a big thing for me and this place was perfectly private.  Close to everything Alki and west seattle has to offer, not to mention a ten minute drive into  seattle itself across the bridge, but nestled on a bluff in a posh, quiet neighborhood the whole experience exudes 'getawayfromitall' vibes. 
I would stay there again and again and seriously cannot wait until my schedule permits me too.  
If you are looking for a romantic getaway, a writer's retreat, or simply want to toss your cares into the ocean and relax with a warm cup of fresh coffee, than by all means look no further than this amazing place.  Contact Michelle, she is sweet, easy to work with and also a great gardener as you will see from her beautiful landscaping.  
Enjoy your vacation!

Danny and Carolyn."
2522091,11254928,2014-03-26,9195336,Scooter,"Wow, what’s not to like here? You get a stunning view of  Puget Sound from the lovely patio, so very peaceful watching the ferries cross to the islands during sunset.  The apartment is flooded with light from the wall of windows to the west, and it is appointed so nicely,  with a comfy bed and sofas, a full kitchen and dining area... perfect for when you want that casual (and romantic) evening and feeling of home.
And when you’re ready for some sights and sounds and seafood, it’s just a 10 minute walk down to Alki Beach, with awesome sandy beaches, views of the city, and loads of great restaurants.
Definitely book this wonderful apartment with Michelle! "
2522091,11273044,2014-03-27,247975,Kevin And Monica,"Our stay here was one of the biggest highlights of our trip to Seattle.  What a great apartment.  It is spacious, comfortable, very clean, and the kitchen has everything.   Visually very nice, tastefully decorated.  Best of all is the amazing view.   The house is high on a bluff above the beach where you can watch ferries and boat traffic all day and night.  The terrace of the apartment is surrounded by a lovely garden.   The front yard is gorgeous too.  Centrally located with shopping and restaurants just minutes away, and less than 15 minutes to downtown.  This is an oasis where you can relax in complete peace and quiet and soak in the view.   We would highly recommend staying here. "
2522091,12638081,2014-05-06,14678013,David,"My daughter and I had a great stay at this apartment. It had a grand view of the water with dramatic sunsets, modern amenities, clean with a private entrance we could come and go easily. Located in the heart of West Seattle it was in a perfect location for us. Great!"
2522091,12902429,2014-05-13,14810932,Sandra,"We needed a place to stay in an unfamiliar area of Seattle.  My daughter suggested Michelle's airbnb listing.  The minute I looked at the pictures, I knew this was the place we wanted to rent.  The apartment is just as advertised.  It is cozy, well stocked, and very tastefully decorated. The view, out the large windows, is superb, and the outdoor sculpture, visible in the pictures, is a delight!  We enjoyed walking in the neighborhood, which is full of beautiful homes.  There is a small commercial center a few blocks away from this safe and peaceful setting. Our only regret is that we were so busy we didn't get to spend as much time there as we would have liked.   "
2522091,17440803,2014-08-12,13735453,Kevin,Michelle provided great instructions for our (early) arrival. Her apt is gorgeous and the views are amazing. We walked the steep roads to the beach and restaurant several times.  Great work out! This home is a very short trip to downtown Seattle and all it's attractions.   The gardens at Michelle's home are beautiful and her home was very clean and comfortable.  She even supplied beach towels and mats for our use. A very accommodating host with a lot of knowledge of the area. We enjoyed our stay. 
2522091,18883512,2014-09-02,15399989,Mary Stevens,"Our stay was amazing, such beautiful views and a beautiful apartment. Everything was very clean and she even had a booklet of places to eat. We will definitely be coming back here. "

The beautifully styled apartment is inhanced by the spectacular views, lush gardens, and delilightful host. Michelle gave us our privacy yet was very open to us!

2522091,29699869,2015-04-11,14609532,Emily,"Michelle offers a clean, comfortable, attractive apartment with a wonderful view in a pleasant neighborhood. She was very welcoming and answered texts and emails very quickly.  The apartment has a kitchen that is well-supplied with decent knives, a fridge, a stove and pots and pans, if you want to do a little cooking.  Although you need a car to get to the BnB and for the side trips you'll want to make, we also used a Water Taxi to shuttle in and out of Seattle without driving (runs early April through late October).    We highly recommend this beautiful and quiet Air BnB."
2522091,31254213,2015-05-03,2119542,John,Great place!  very convenient location in W. Seattle.  Would stay here again.

The neighborhood is wonderful, with lots of easy parking (and is a terrific place to go for a walk.)   It's a great location within walking distance of lots of amenities, but a quiet and relaxing place to stay.   The apartment was very clean and comfortable, with everything necessary available and well marked.   The view and gardens are truly special and lovely.     Thanks!"
2522091,33551632,2015-05-29,2799408,Ramon,"Beautiful home with a gorgeous view of Puget Sound, well stocked and cared for. I was pleasantly surprised by how much natural light the unit got. Michelle was great with communication, took a moment to say hello personally when I arrived, and was great throughout. Location was convenient to both Alki Beach and the Admiral commercial district of West Seattle. Highly recommend!"

Michelle, as a host, is very courteous and allows you to keep to yourself... All of this, allowing for a perfect Honeymoon in Seattle.

Thank you so much Michelle!"
2522091,36840177,2015-07-01,36874047,David,"Hello to all that are looking to be and feel amazing while away from home. If you need a place to unwind, than Michelle's Apartment is the place to be. The view is awesome and you have complete privacy of the lovely flowered garden. It looks better than the picture and it's very real. I love to stay again and the place was very clean and a private kitchen with dishes and a dish washer even. The shower has heavenly warm water and as a host, I just had to give her a big huggy bear hug for the love and time she spent in this lovely home. Over looking the ferry to Bremerton is a joy and a must car/ cruise ride as you see it sailing by at the patio table. Take your breath away kind of spot and just amazing to stay there. Her view is like this everyday and the neighborhood is close to shops and Seattle Fish Co. (Plz get the Sword Fish Steaks- and Halibut cakes-OMG) Well this is your spot if you are lucky to book with her. The checks are for family safety guys, well worth it and very real. I fell in love with her place and if I hit the lotto, you betcha we would be neighbors if anybody would give up that hard to get breathtaking view. Thanks Michelle, your hospitality was just over the top. The personal flowers and balloons for the birthday weekend for Amy was lovely, she never stopped taking pics for her FB. David S. Surprise, AZ."
2522091,38121344,2015-07-13,32844709,Terry,What a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! The inside was quaint and homey - perfectly appointed with everything one would need.

Michelle made it super easy and convenient to get into, with specific instructions on how to get to and into the apartment. Close to the end of our stay, she came to say hello and make sure everything went well. We loved the view and had a great time staying in this quiet location. It's the perfect place to stay while visiting the area. You'll need to rent a car so that you can access the many sights in Seattle and get here easily."
2522091,46352164,2015-09-09,2481187,Justin,"Michelle's place is beautiful and clean and peaceful. The location is awesome. Michelle is a great host. If I visit Seattle again, there is no doubt that I will stay at Michelle's place."

2522091,50256851,2015-10-10,35710638,Dave,Great location and very attentive responses. I'd recommend this to friends 
2522091,50965592,2015-10-16,2767232,Julia,"Michelle's apartment was excellent!  I've been traveling to Seattle a lot recently, and this is my favorite spot so far.  The views are unbeatable, and the apartment is equipped with tons of nice extras for the stay - coffee, condiments in the fridge, plenty of pots and pans for cooking.  The entire space was really clean and spacious, too.  "
2522091,51196761,2015-10-18,16871127,Dawei,We had a wonderful time at Michelle's place. I wanted to tell Michelle to take new pictures of her place because the current pictures don’t do it justice. Make sure you wake up early enough for the sunrise view!
2522091,52023056,2015-10-25,125528,Lynn,"Michelle's place is a hidden gem and the view is gorgeous.  She accommodated me last minute and was responsive.  Getting in was simple.  The neighborhood is easy and quite walkable.  This trip was just a layover on my way back home but I was glad I chose to stay in West Seattle.  It was restful, and convenient to ferries and SeaTac.  Almost tough to leave."
2522091,52903576,2015-11-02,8966752,Anthony,"The location was excellent, just a short drive from downtown over the W Seatlle Bridge. The view of the Puget Sound out the back was amazing, and the apt itself was quite nice with access to the highway for the Cascades or Olympics close by. Very clean, comfortable, and plenty of space for two people to sprawl out and feel ""at home"" for the week. I would absolutely stay here again next time we visit Seattle! "
7638282,41174386,2015-08-04,31875723,Pamela,"This is a retreat in a true sense of the word.  Manghild was a welcoming host who provided not only a beautiful space, but a relaxing one.  I wished there wasn't so much to do and see in Seattle because I would have loved to be in the living room and just put my feet up and observe the passing clouds in the skylights.  It was quiet in the neighborhood, close to the bus line and I was lucky to be her first guest."
7638282,41539502,2015-08-07,15587631,Heather,"As I write this review I keep thinking ""I can't write what I really want to cause then everyone will know how amazing this place was!!!""
But none the less... I will.  Besides the host being utterly lovely and caring (she offered to get my son something for his bell at the store after he was car sick!), her sweet dog Loki and friendly kitty, and the sweet secret garden that is her backyard... The space was everything we hoped for and more.
We arrived to fresh fruit and yogurt in the fridge along with a lovely carafe of chilled water.  She also had set out containers with toys for our son and special children's dishware for him to feel comfortable too.

The neighborhood is lovely, quiet, and has some great area restaurants that we walked to.  We ate at a lovely Italian restaurant that was quint and VERY child friendly while still feeling intimate.

My only hope is that the next time we are in Seattle... It will be available!! But I have a sinking suspicion it will be booked solid!!! 

Thank you again for a marvelous stay!"
7638282,42051571,2015-08-10,16157637,Laura,"Couldn't have asked for a better stay in Seattle! Magnhild was there to greet us when we arrived, checking to make sure we had everything we needed to be comfortable. The house and yard are both beautiful and made the perfect scene for a weekend getaway. The adjacency to downtown both by car and bus also made it the optimum location for a quiet night and quick access to our planned events. Shortly after we departed, she even contacted us immediately to inform us of a left behind item. Very thankful for that! I would suggest Magnhild's backyard retreat hands down, and will be planning to visit again when next in town."
7638282,42464313,2015-08-13,674150,Marc,"Magnhild was a great host, very friendly and welcoming. She pays great attention to details, and has put a lot of work into  her cottage to make it feel like home. The cottage also has a beautiful back yard which Magnhild shares with her guests. We had a great time and highly recommend it!"
7638282,42796906,2015-08-15,27641526,Christopher,"Magnhild is the best; she is a fantastic host. We absolutely loved staying with her. She's got the sweetest personality and her retreat is just that, a lovely oasis in Seattle. I can't say enough kind things. I look forward to staying with her again on my next trip to Seattle."
7638282,43138221,2015-08-17,15580890,Karen,Staying with Magnhild at Tall Trees was wonderful! The private house was beautiful and Magnhild was a prefect hostess. We will definitely be frequent guests when we visit our  daughter who/ lives near by in Seattle 
7638282,44000806,2015-08-23,40046501,James,"If you are looking to visit Seattle then we cannot recommend a stop at the Tall Trees Backyard Retreat highly enough. A charming, self-contained cottage that we didn't want to leave. It is wonderfully decorated and kitted out, it was a home away from home for a week.

Located in a quiet area of North Seattle it gave us some space but also was perfectly situated for a half-hour bus into the city itself and equally expeditions to the North and Whidbey Island.

Our host Magnhild was supremely welcoming. She greeted us warmly and offered us a lot of advice for local eateries, shops, and things to do."
7638282,44348032,2015-08-25,1358664,Weldon,"Magnhild made our stay wonderful from the very beginning. She having learned our trip was an anniversary had a special something waiting for us. She walked us through the cottage and the attention to detail was perfect. Not so bare, nor cluttered. That perfect blend of homey yet clean and peaceful. It was very accessible to downtown Seattle, and the garden smelled wonderful. We had a lovely conversation with Magnhild on our last day and were sad we were leaving. We now having stayed at a less than desirable place on our last day, are so sad we left. I would in a moment, come back. This would be a great place to stay coming back for UW football games or Seahawk games in the winter. It's not just a summer listing. This cottage was perfect!"
7638282,45292523,2015-09-01,40294447,Sandy,"My wife and I couldn't have been happier with Magnhild or her lovely cottage and garden retreat. Aside from the great design and quiet neighborhood, we found every little detail covered inside and out. It's very convenient to my son and his family to boot. No doubt we'll be back. Five stars!"
7638282,46923695,2015-09-14,41498149,Marc,"Magnhild is a wonderful host.  She went the extra mile for us when our rental car died in her driveway.  Not only did she arrange for a Lyft driver to come pick us up, but she subsequently returned with a wego charger to help us start our car.  Thank you, Magnhild!   Her guest cottage is exactly as advertised--lovely and comfortable--and it overlooks a delightful little garden complete with Adirondack chairs.  We would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
7638282,48004158,2015-09-22,36653013,Property Management,"We had a wonderful trip & the property was perfect! Our host made us feel right at home and even provided some toys for our daughter. Every morning our daughter would wake up & wave or say ""HI"" to the lady in the garden. It was just the most perfect family time and we can't wait to be back."
7638282,49907263,2015-10-07,2833026,Mandy,"I stayed at Tall Trees for almost 2 weeks, with my husband.  We really enjoyed the stay.  Magnhild was kind enough to make us fresh orange juice for our arrival.  The kitchen was fully equipped and we had a selection of teas to choose from every morning. We were able to enjoy our tea and lunches sitting in the backyard. The washroom was well laid out and the washer and dryer made it convenient during a long stay. 
The backyard was very relaxing and we were visited by hummingbirds each afternoon. Magnhild is very easy going and lovely to chat with. She made us feel so comfortable.  The location was excellent. There is a bus station just down the street, cafe's within an easy walking distance and Green Lake is a 5 minute drive. 
I wouldn't hesitate to book a stay here again. 
Thanks for the relaxing stay Magnhild!!!"
7638282,50754610,2015-10-14,19742086,Lynne,"We came to Seattle from 10/7 to 10/13 and we stayed in the most wonderful place. It was so clean and cozy that it was hard to decided if we wanted to hang out there or go into Seattle. There is a fully stocked kitchen, washer/dryer, great shower, wonderful living area and the bedroom was very nice. The neighborhood is very nice and quiet and you can get anywhere you need to go with no hassle. You look out on a beautiful garden and though Magnhild is in the house next to the cottage you feel like you have all the privacy you need. She is a wonderful hostess who makes you feel like you are home. She has some things that she stocks in the fridge like yougart, coffee, fruit and is available for any questions. Has the friendliest dog and sweet kitty. This place is a winner. We loved staying here and will be back."
7638282,51308538,2015-10-19,27669349,Bob,We had a nice conversation with Magnhild. 
7638282,52094125,2015-10-26,7140845,Andrew,"Our stay with Magnhild was wonderful,maybe one of the best in our long hisory of Airbnb !!!
The space was SUPER clean(which is #1 one our list of desires in a location)with everything you would need to feel at home,i.e.,full kitchen,comfy living room,beautiful garden to relax in,as I said everything you'd need.
On top of that Magnhild was a prefect host,even going out of her way to purchase a fireplace screen to guard against our toddler from touching the glass front.
We would highly recommend to all her home,and THANK YOU Magnhild for the gerat stay !!
We hope to visit again.
"
7638282,54877704,2015-11-25,41758617,Liz,We just stayed recently at the Tall Trees Backyard Retreat. Magnhild was very helpful and friendly. The place is clean and quiet and has all the amenities we needed. We were close to our daughters house and we found a restaurant just up the street called Piccolo Cafe that is fabulous. Great food and ambiance. We hope to stay there again soon.Thanks to the owner--Liz and Bill
7638282,57769715,2015-12-29,23249266,Rob,"Magnhild was very welcoming and informative. We found the cottage to be everything as described.  Very tasteful and peaceful. We loved the shower, but found the handle that adjusts the temperature to be very stiff/hard to do fine adjustments. We definitely recommend this place!  Thank you, Magnhild!"
8080939,47024783,2015-09-14,34936450,Mateusz,The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
176678,1106598,2012-04-10,349498,Ye,"I was one of the first few Airbnb guests at Laura's new townhouse, which was shiningly neat and conveniently located!  Laura was helpful in my trip planning and very accommodating to my requests. I would recommend her to all future airbnb travelers!"
176678,1368842,2012-05-28,1746717,Gregory,"We were very comfortable at Laura's place. It was a nice location on the West Seattle peninsula with very easy access to the Seattle waterfront, Seattle Center and downtown. We would definitely stay there again."
176678,1462229,2012-06-11,2293902,Garrett,"Laura was an excellent host, quick to reply and easy to communicate with. The flexible check in/out times made our visit much smoother...The room/bathroom were clean and exactly as advertised. The condo was easily accessible to all parts of Seattle...I'll definitely look into staying here again when I return. "
176678,1525674,2012-06-20,2497476,Laura,"Laura was extremely friendly and easy to reach throughout my stay. The room and bathroom are on the first level of the townhouse, separated from the rest of the place, so it's pretty private. The room and bathroom was also very clean and new. This was one of my first Air bnb experiences but this had definitely exceeded my expectations."
176678,1549844,2012-06-24,2506142,Sarah,"Really grateful for this stay, 

The house in Magnolia was in a beautiful suburb; just around the corner from a bus stop and 10 minutes to downtown. A nice alternative to any hotel (and beautiful inside- a nice view on the second floor). Miss Laura herself was very helpful and kind- offering directions and help if I needed it. I would definitely recommend this stay for visitors to Seattle. "
176678,1772356,2012-07-22,2898637,Jessica,Laura was very accommodating and  has a beautiful home. 
176678,1831385,2012-07-29,786142,Carter,"Absolutely loved Laura's place, it is well appointed, very clean and I was very happy staying there. She is a friendly and courteous host, who goes out of her way to make her guests feel at home.  The place is in a very nice neighborhood, convenient to all the sights in Seattle and opposite the direction of rush hour traffic.  I could not have been more comfortable.  Thanks again."
176678,2357527,2012-09-20,3523467,Gary,"We really enjoyed our stay at Laura's home. 
We were met with a warm and friendly greeting,  despite us arriving mid evening. As we spent most of the day and early evening out exploring the city, our room was adequate, comfortable and met our needs. I'm sure if you needed anything extra, (more pillows or bedding, maybe a bedside table lamp, water etc.) to make your stay comfortable Laura would endeavor to do her very best to meet your needs. The WiFi was good and access to it most valued. 
Laura showed us where we could make tea and coffee if we wished to do so, however, we are actually quite shy people and we were happy to have bottled water in our room. 
As we were going to be using public transport during our visit, Laura recommended a great bus app, 'one bus away', which was absolutely brilliant and so useful. The nearest bus stop is literally a stones throw from Laura's place. (A word for the Seattle bus drivers, they were always friendly and keen to help us)
The nearby pub is Irish themed, sell Guinness and surprise surprise, it's an Irish theme bar. Sorry, not my thing personally, if you want an Irish pub, go to Ireland! However, it's a five minute walk from Laura's, the beer was excellent, you'll find nice things to eat, or can just prop the bar up and watch sport tv! It's clearly a pub for the local community and should be valued. 
A 5-10 minute walk over the nearby railway bridge, you'll find a very busy Starbucks, a great Burger grill place called the Red Mill Burgers, allegedly one of the 20 burgers you must eat before you die! It was a little rough and ready, but the fries and burger were delicious, not to be missed! Opposite is a grocery store, and a take away/delivery pizza place, whose name escapes me, but looked interesting.
Next to the petrol station, you'll find the busy bus stop, with buses running into Seattle every 10 mins or so. They are doing so interesting things to improve the bus network and services for users, so should be interesting. Our morning routine was to wander into Starbuck's, grab something small to eat, drink coffee, and then keep checking 'the one bus away' app and get the bus into town. 
Finally, a really big thank you to Laura who was leaving for work the same time we were leaving Seattle and who very kindly drove us into the city to make sure we found the railway station okay. It saved us a lot of time, and we were able to enjoy the great atmosphere of Zeitgeist Cafe just a hop skip and a jump from the train station.
Interesting that for us Brits, our 'ground floor' is actually an Americans first floor, and vice versa, ha! So a Brits first floor is an American second floor etc.
   "
176678,3420990,2013-01-27,2471697,Norma,"My husband and I had a very nice stay at Laura's Townhouse just west of the city. The first floor guest room is cozy with comfy linens.  The weather was really cold in January 2013 so we enjoyed being able to control the warmth of the room with and individual thermostat. The private bath is lovely and of course all was super clean. (I want to know that when I read reviews).  The location is excellent. One block from a bus line that gets you to the action in minutes, walkable to restaurants, grocery store, coffee, and neighborhood pubs (all of which we experienced).
Laura is a very kind and gracious host and overall great person.  We enjoyed our chats with her.  She provides and assort of breakfast items in her beautiful upstairs kitchen.
Overall a very good stay and I recommend staying here and I would stay again."
176678,5042747,2013-06-09,6585682,Jakob,"Staying with Laura was great! She responded to messages quickly and thus we were able to shift my arrival time around to fit my crazy schedule. Then once there she let me borrow her bicycle to ride around town all week. The room was clean, warm, and quiet, so definitely no problems at all. "
176678,5694181,2013-07-12,5999067,Eric,This is a great value in Seattle with a superb location and host.  The room is a bit small if you are two but very comfortable and clean - the bed is very comfortable as welll - and your bathroom is pristine.  The location is primo for access to the entire city and there is easy and plentiful on street parking.  Laura is on the go so you'll have plenty of privacy and she is a pleasure to deal with and very sane.  I think this is a tremendous value and a real jewel.
176678,6026877,2013-07-27,932772,Tom,"Laura was a delightful host - always ready to explain things, accommodate requests, and just visit - but never intrusive.  Her home is spotless! Everything was just the way a visitor needs it to be - easily accessible and right where it needed to be. I would stay again and anyone would find Laura's place a very nice stay."
176678,6308128,2013-08-07,2133939,Christina,We had a great stay in Laura's home. We arrived a little late in the evening so we didn't get to meet her when we arrived. She was very sweet over the phone and recommended an excellent Irish Pub that is close to her home. The location was great! It was close to so many great places to eat and see. Parking was very easy to find if you're renting a car. The room was perfect for our needs. Everything was very clean and organized. Although we didn't see her much when we finally met her she was very sweet! We would love to stay at her home again if we are ever in Seattle.
176678,6399535,2013-08-11,4939285,Charlotte,"Laura is very welcoming, available and easy going. The room and the bathroom were absolutely clean and comfortable, as so her house. The location is convenient, with some bus lines stopping really closely. Globally a really good place to stay."
176678,6524274,2013-08-15,8031876,Barbara,"Laura is an excellent host.  Her place is clean and cozy.  She is very caring, and went the extra mile to make our stay comfortable.  Her location worked well for us.  As a bonus, it's only .3 mile from a Starbucks coffee shop."
176678,6877801,2013-08-28,1555309,Mathilde,"I spent three days in Seattle, and looked for a place to stay pretty late... fortunately I could find Laura's place. It was my first time at Seattle, and I first thought... oh, oh, this place is FAR away. But that's fine: it's really well connected to the rest of the city (with buses), and there's a good Irish place in the neighorood to hang out at night. The apartment itself was really nice, cosy, clean and quiet, and Laura was really accomodating."
176678,7042333,2013-09-04,7901397,Tom,"Quaint, private room with private bath and entry.  Close to everything downtown Seattle.  Clean and neat. Enjoyed fresh coffee every morning."
176678,10272851,2014-02-10,11541173,Helen,I very much enjoyed my stay at Laura's. The room was very comfortable. Everything was sparkling clean. I used the kitchen to make tea every morning. Parking was convenient. Laura was very friendly and helpful. I couldn't have had a better experience. 
176678,10665406,2014-03-02,12189685,Chris,"Nice, clean, private space in a convenient section of the city. Wonderful home, kind people. Stay if you have the chance"
176678,11039125,2014-03-17,11404521,Kevin,"After a week of traveling across the country, I found Laura's place to be a great surprise. It exceeded my expectations. I had a great stay. Her place was modern, new, spotless, comfy, warm, private, and welcoming. Great location for all points in Seattle, and north and south. Laura was a superb host. She is friendly and engaging, and very easy to communicate with. I wouldn't hesitate to contact her first for my next stay in Seattle. "
176678,12193495,2014-04-25,13640152,Dean,"The room was great (you basically get a whole floor!), and Laura was fantastic. Ten out of ten, y'all. "
176678,13191196,2014-05-21,4924978,Lucy,"Laura's place is great. I stayed here over a week. The bedroom and bathroom are on the first floor of the townhouse. You have the whole floor to yourself. Lots of privacy. The bedroom is small but very clean and the bed is super comfy. I was working a lot during my stay so I didn't see Laura much at all but when I did she was very nice and accommodating. 
Also the house is a very short drive or an uphill walk to Discovery Park which is an amazing place to spend a sunny day!"
176678,14267474,2014-06-16,12130861,Amy,"This townhouse is in an excellent location! Easy, no-transfer access to Fremont and Downtown via bus, and super quick access to the bikes trails.

It's really clean too, and Laura was very accommodating about everything. It's very private too, because you get the floor to yourself.

Only caveat is it is a little cramped, so it might be hard if you want to do work or read in the room (only relevant to long-term stays!)."
176678,14750762,2014-06-25,16305329,Doug,"Laura was very pleasant and accomodating.  Room was small, but clean and comfortable.  Having a private bathroom was a plus.  Truly enjoyed our time in Seattle.

Doug and Jayne Montgomery"
176678,17049843,2014-08-06,5890742,Jared,"Laura and her roommate Lauren were very pleasant and accommodating.  The room is small, but clean and comfortable. Lauren gave us some excellent advice on what to see, and getting around via transit wasn't a problem."
176678,20058672,2014-09-22,21268291,Esther,"This place was great. It's located in a great neighborhood. As soon as I entered the room, there were magazines that informed me of restaurants in Seattle and attractions I can go to. Laura was a great host and was extremely friendly. I would definitely recommend this place. "
176678,20615789,2014-10-02,21075866,Justin,"I had an absolutely fantastic time staying with Laura! She was warm and welcoming, making me feel right at home (which is great when finding yourself in a new country). The room was very well kept and cosy, and the neighborhood is really laid-back and friendly. I would highly recommend staying here!"
176678,22362961,2014-11-04,21544040,Rahul,"Laura was a great host. Laura made sure I'm comfortable and left me a couple of magazines and recommended a list of local restaurants on the day of my arrival. This room is on the first floor of a townhouse and a restroom on the same floor. The room is small but it was good enough for me and the bed was super comfortable, I would spend most of my time outside and come back just for sleeping. It almost felt like I was living in my own house and I never had any privacy issues.

The neighborhood is called Magnolia and is more of  location is approx 30 mins away from Downtown by bus and has multiple bus routes through it.

I ended up living here for almost a month before I found a permanent accommodation in Seattle."
176678,22685712,2014-11-11,13097482,Jackie,"Laura was a gracious host and made me feel at home! Although she doesn't usually open her kitchen to guests, she let me cook myself breakfast while I was there. "
176678,26365576,2015-02-10,26334690,Sharon,"This B&B was exactly as advertised: clean and quiet. The host, Laura, was very gracious and accommodating. She had a pot of coffee ready for me in the morning. The bed was quite comfortable and I really enjoyed having my own bathroom!"
176678,26717419,2015-02-17,27012742,Peggy,"Because the room is on the bottom floor of a three story, it is very private.  The bed was very comfortable and the private bath is very nice and cozy.  The house is within walking distance of a nice Irish pub, Starbucks, a grocery store and other eating establishments.  Streets in the neighborhood are narrow, but parking was ok, and it was asy to get to the freeway.  

The picture shows a tv in the room which was not there.  But I didn't miss it because Laura provided internet wifi and I was able to watch programs on my IPad.  

Communication was quick and easy with Laura.  She answered my questions in a timely manner and was very respectful of my spaced.  I would definitely stay again.
"
176678,27231607,2015-02-28,13831703,Phil,Laura was great - very hospitable and flexible. The space is fairly private and set aside. Will definitely use her rental in the future. Thanks so much. 
176678,28276258,2015-03-21,1703944,Isi,"Laura was a great host and her beautiful home is in a really great and equally beautiful neighborhood! The private bedroom & bathroom occupy the bottom level of the home and the accommodations are clean, private, comfortable, and quiet. Laura was so gracious, she made sure that I had  everything that I needed and even gave great recommendations to local restaurants. It was a great experience staying there and I'd do it again. "
176678,28411819,2015-03-23,14652281,Barbara,"I had a late evening arrival, but Laura was easy to communicate with so it went smoothly. Fortunately, I wasn't driving a car since parking seemed a bit scarce in the area, but otherwise the neighborhood was nice. "
176678,28736677,2015-03-29,28588732,Vincent,Laura was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay. She had a great recommendation for food and made sure we were comfortable during our time there.
176678,28898230,2015-03-31,17254193,Mingyan,Comfortable and cozy place to live in near center Seattle. The room exactly   The same as description and Laura is very helpful during our stay. Recommend!

Clean and comfortable bed
"
176678,33382811,2015-05-27,5857344,Mohannad,"Laura is a great host. She prepared the space just like hotels. I like staying there, clean with good amount of privacy. I found the room just like the pictures except for the wardrobe and the TV above it, they were not there, but I did not need them any way. I also like the neighbourhood, I felt safe. I like the communication process. Check-in and check-out were very good too. I would love to stay there again. "
176678,33731563,2015-05-31,32514183,Jo,Laura was fabulous. So hospitable and really made sure that I had all the information I needed for a fabulous 4 days in Seatlle. The room was as described and the house was lovely. Thank you Laura 
176678,34972908,2015-06-14,28739,Kathy,"Laura is a great host.  She was welcoming and at the same time not intrusive.  I stayed for four nights and after the first night, I had the house to myself as she went away for a long weekend.  The location is perfect with plenty of on street parking.  Wifi was quick  and it was nice to work outside on the terrace as the weather was beautiful during my stay."
176678,35935428,2015-06-23,33189380,Yulia,"Laura is a great host. She was welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed for our stay and even more! For example, before our trip I asked for a hair dryer and Laura lent it to me without any questions. Or in the middle of our stay my husband felt sick and I asked a cup of tea. She gave us tea and honey. She was always supportive and gave us a lot of recommendations what places to see in Seattle and where to eat.
The location is very calm and there are a lot of parking. We parked right next to house. The bedroom and bathroom are very clean, warm and cozy. However, I think the room is better just for one person. I needed more space for keeping all our stuff :-)
Communication was quick and easy with Laura. It was nice to stay at Laura's place.
"
176678,36138749,2015-06-25,466574,Das,"We had a wonderful stay, and the location was perfect! We did not want to be too far or close to the city, and the area definitely fit the bill. It reminded me of a less congested Silver Lake (if you are from LA), and local eateries / coffeeshops are well within walking distance. While we were worried that there would be some issues with the railroad track nearby, it proved not to be a factor and was very quiet at night. 

Laura was a great host, and she went out of her way to make sure our stay was comfortable. The place was very clean, and she made available juice and some amazing coffee every morning. I won't hesitate to stay here in the future!"
176678,37192588,2015-07-05,35045589,Sara,Laura was super hospitable. Weather was extremely hot and home a/c is not common in SEA. But we enoyed the outdoor space and secluded yard. Lovely 30 min. bike ride to downtown on bike path gives excellent views of South Lake Union/ Westlake.
176678,37592600,2015-07-08,36005590,Debbie,Laura was terrific! Her place was perfectly suited to our needs - located near where we wanted to be. Parking was never an issue. We enjoyed sitting in those Adirondack chairs on the front porch with our morning coffee. Thanks for making our first Airbnb experience easy!
176678,37815221,2015-07-10,15760087,Edie,"Loved, loved the apartment and Laura.  She was a gracious host, and was able to accommodate us after we left a disappointing airbnb location.  Thanks Laura!!!!  Again, I can't say how much we appreciated you and your kindness!!!!!"
176678,39543580,2015-07-24,24462412,Kristine,"Great place, just enough space for the two of us! Laura was super helpful and we'd be back in a heartbeat! "
176678,40106105,2015-07-28,16689212,Jesse,"Laura was absolutely wonderful. Accommodating and nonintrusive she made Seattle feel like home. The entire stay was pleasant beyond compare and I could not have asked for a more fulfilling trip.

The space was better than advertised and incredibly comfortable. No problems or critiques. Simply a homey place to come back to after a long day of urban exploring."
176678,40767018,2015-08-02,33047359,John,"Laura was completely charming, generous and very kind.  She keeps a safe, clean, quiet, private and attractive space.  I particularly appreciated being in a quiet neighborhood while still a hop skip and a jump to all the fun things that Seattle has to offer.   I reccommend Laura's AirBnB to anyone requiring privacy and serenity as well as access to city fun!"
176678,41765772,2015-08-09,29464224,Katie,"Laura's place was exactly what we were looking for during our 1 week stay in Seattle. It was clean, inviting and close to the city, just as described in the listing. Laura was a great host. We were not able to chat with her much due to her work schedule and our own travel plans, but during the times we saw her, she was nice and welcoming; she even offered us coffee every morning. Overall, this was a great location with an awesome host who made our first Air BnB experience a breeze. Would definitely recommend this space, and would stay there again! "
176678,43614261,2015-08-21,33383934,Brian,"Accommodations were clean and neat.  Morning coffee was available.  Room was very private, and home was in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Location was convenient for me since it was near my daughter's home.  Beautiful Park nearby for morning hikes."
176678,44590814,2015-08-27,12934633,Ryan,"Laura's place was great. She was easy to communicate with and left a key for my arrival.  The room was clean, comfortable and parking was plentiful on the street.  Very close to Ballard and 10 minutes from Greenlake.  She even made fresh coffee every morning.  

I highly recommend Laura's place if you are working or exploring Seattle."
176678,45261168,2015-09-01,37069895,Mariam,"Laura was an amazing host. She was generous and beyond kind. Her home is very comfortable and clean. She is very hospitable and takes the time out to make sure you are comfortable :)
I would definitely stay at her place again. "
176678,45697511,2015-09-05,5325173,Megan,"Laura was an exceptional host and her townhouse was a great spot. The neighborhood is very quiet and has easy access to downtown either by driving or by bus. Her place is near Discovery Park in the Magnolia district and it has spectacular views of the bay. Her place is also across the bridge from Ballard which has a fun downtown with great food and shops.

My boyfriend and I stayed at Laura's for several nights and met Laura on our last nite there. With her work schedule and my boyfriend and I out exploring the city so much - we didn't cross paths. We did get a lot of tips from her friend Lauren (who was staying there at the time) and she was very sweet and accommodating. 

We were very happy with our stay and Laura is such a fantastic person. 

I would highly suggest staying at Laura's if you plan a trip to Seattle."
176678,46306446,2015-09-09,41218094,Stephanie,"This was my first airbnb experience and Laura made it very easy and comfortable.  Her townhouse was cute, clean and suited our needs perfectly.  Having the downstairs to ourselves gave us lots of privacy.  The location was great!  I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it for those looking for a quiet place to stay but still get the ""Seattle experience."" Thanks again Laura!"
176678,48780528,2015-09-28,32721561,Sara,"Our stay was wonderful. Chose this listing for the private room with bathroom and it was pleasantly exactly as described. Laura was easy to communicate with and accommodating. She offered us coffee and breakfast items each morning. Due to our schedules, we did not meet face to face until the night before checking out but she made everything very easy with messages and a thoughtful welcome note. The neighborhood was nice and quiet, removed form the tourist scene but easy enough to get downtown and surrounding neighborhoods. "
176678,49776379,2015-10-06,32930900,Eric,Katie and I had a great experience in Seattle. Laura has a beautiful place in lovely magnolia. We would surely spend another night there. Laura was very friendly and gave us plenty of suggestions for having fun!
176678,50248135,2015-10-10,2791511,Benjamin,"Nice room that was very convenient for exploring Magnolia. Easy bus ride from downtown. Honestly one of the best parts was the Irish pub in the neighborhood around the corner! Laura was so friendly and welcoming, and the place is super clean and home is brand new. Thanks for great stay!"
8006745,55358512,2015-12-01,43032412,Adina,"My partner and I had an excellent stay in Madeleine's home! The space was exactly as described/pictured, and the neighborhood is very quiet. We had everything we needed, and the full kitchen as well as washer and dryer were great amenities for a longer term rental. We didn't get to meet Madeleine as she was abroad, but she was very friendly and responsive when questions came up. I was checked-in by her mom who was also very friendly and even made us cookies. If you get the chance to stay here, I would highly recommend it."
8006745,56302653,2015-12-12,46047573,Brittany,"The Seattle Urban Farmhouse was perfect for my stay. The neighborhood was quiet and easy to get find. There is a park right around the corner that's perfect for a morning run, with great views of Mount Rainier on a clear day. The itself is spacious and had everything I needed. The backyard was a great size and has more great views of the mountains in the distance. It's roughly a 10-15 minute drive to downtown Seattle, but there's also a monorail a couple blocks away that takes you straight into the city. Madeleine was quick to respond to any questions or concerns and worked with me when I had to change my trips dates. Her brother in law, Zane, let me into the house and showed us around, gave us information about the house and neighborhood, and some suggestions for places to eat. Overall, my experience was great and I would love to stay at the Seattle Urban Farmhouse when I visit Seattle again!"
8006745,57430822,2015-12-26,1599854,Amber,"The space was perfect for our needs -- clean, spacious, comfortable and stylish, and most importantly, we felt very warm and welcome. Her mother decorated the porch with Christmas lights, adorned the kitchen with greenery and candles, and even shared some wonderful homemade fudge with us!

""Urban Farmhouse"" is a perfect description for the house and location. The quietness of the neighborhood made us feel like we were in the countryside, while access to buses and the train station are all within walking distance. We visited Pritchard Beach several times, about a 5 minute walk from the house, and enjoyed skipping rocks in Lake Washington while taking in the beautiful scenery.

We had a memorable Christmas in Madeleine's home. It couldn't have been better!"
4324317,28688653,2015-03-28,17973212,Naomi,"My friend and I stayed at Danielle's cute little home while visiting Seattle to see a Yonder Mountain String Band show.  It was perfect for us ... One quick bus got us right to the Neptune Theatre, and Danielle suggested great places to grab a coffee and brunch in the morning. 
We enjoyed the ingenious little decorating touches, and her interesting selection of books. 
The apartment is very small but clean, comfortable, and as I said, super cute!  We'd happily stay there again. "
4324317,31853976,2015-05-10,30259317,Jillian,"Danielle was very welcoming to me. I thoroughly enjoyed staying at her apartment! It was very private and quiet, got a great few nights of sleep! "

4324317,33886616,2015-06-01,1183692,Jeanine,"Rebecca has clearly hosted many guests at her place - she leaves things tidy and clear instructions along the way. I enjoyed the place, it is located well, plenty of parking, perfect for a business trip. "
4324317,34546331,2015-06-09,2787636,Liz,"Danielle was a great host. She was really responsive and helpful. The apartment is super cute and in a nice and quiet part of Seattle. It is a cozy space and is perfect for a getaway. There are a few charming places nearby, and the rest of the city was easily accesible by bus. Overall, I recommend it!"
4324317,35214461,2015-06-16,28652697,Erin,Danielle allowed me to check in at 11a to freshen up before my goddaighter's graduation from UW and didn't charge me extra. Her studio is adorable and is literally in front of a bus stop. Very easy to get around and lots to see and do in an adorable part of seattle!
4324317,36576006,2015-06-29,4855892,Joe,"We really enjoyed our stay at Danielle's studio. Communication was friendly and responsive. Her place was nicely decorated and extremely clean. The studio is on the ground floor of a small apartment building with 6 or so units. Even though we had the windows open to help with the June heat wave, we didn't find it to be noisy. And Danielle left us a fan that helped keep the place cool.

The shower worked well, the internet was fast (10 Mbps), and there was plenty of room in the fridge, although we didn't cook anything. The bed was big enough for 2 people.

Ravenna is a great neighborhood - there are cafes, bars, restaurants, and a book store within walking distance. And Ravenna Park is an underrated gem. You can also easily get a bus to downtown. We highly recommend Danielle's place, and would definitely stay there again!"
4324317,37202585,2015-07-05,8464903,Vanessa,Great apartment and Danielle is a wonderful host. Very quick to reply and extremely helpful! She accommodated an early check in as well.

4324317,38447733,2015-07-15,37735024,Cindy,Loved the quaint apartment . Thank you for choosing to allow us a few days respite in Seattle. 
4324317,38740881,2015-07-18,805854,Michelle,"We loved this studio! A perfect layout and nicely decorated. Perfect for two people.  We have no complaints. There are not a lot of places that you can walk to, but the neighborhood was safe and it was close to the freeway. "
4324317,39203488,2015-07-21,2817158,Ekaterina,"The studio was clean, with fresh towels and sheets ready, and check-in was super easy. Danielle was responsive over text when I had a question, and overall experience was pleasant. We enjoyed walking around Seattle, and had a cozy place to come back to in the evening. "
4324317,40103427,2015-07-28,5418198,Esther,"Danielle has a lovely studio. It is nicely decorated, it was clean, and the neighborhood is great. Danielle has been a very responsive host, I never had to wait long for an answer.
The studio is on a busy street and, because of the single-paned windows, you will hear the traffic anywhere in the studio.
The kitchen equipment is very minimal. We stayed for a week and experienced that it was hard to prepare meals in the studio with the utensils/equipment available."
4324317,40633729,2015-08-01,37502656,Talia,Danielle apartment was beautiful. The space was warm and welcoming and really made us love seattle from the moment we arrived. It's very easily accessible by public transportation. Highly recommend.

4324317,43064047,2015-08-17,14609988,Hollie,"We really loved staying at Danielle's apartment. It was exactly what we were looking for for a long weekend getaway-- cute, clean, and close to transit (a bus stop literally outside the door). Danielle was an awesome host: check-in was really convenient and she was very accommodating. Would definitely recommend!"
5579427,39952247,2015-07-27,6559172,Jeffrey,"This place is fantastic.  Some places on AirB&B are like hotels, apartments, hostiles but this place felt like home.  We, my wife and I, had been on a long trip up the west coast.  Our final stop was Seattle.  This place was a great end to our vacation as every time we walked in the door it felt a bit like walking into our own home.  I never met Nikki but never doubted that she would be available to answer questions via phone, email or text.  It is a bit ""out of town"" but public transit was easy enough and we had a great time."
5579427,41091271,2015-08-04,35724716,Michael,Our stay was wonderful. Nikki was very welcoming and informative. We felt comfortable right away. The description of the property was spot on. The neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Everything was spectacular.
5579427,41958243,2015-08-10,15341661,Seth,Nikki was great. We loved the location it was next to Discovery Park and about 4 miles from downtown Seattle. The house was nice and Nikki was very accommodating. 
5579427,43497058,2015-08-20,35500389,Joan,"From the first time I contacted Nikki about renting the house up until the day we checked out after a week long stay, she was friendly, responsive, communicative, and very easy to deal with. Her house is charming and comfortable and we felt very welcomed. The neighborhood is lovely and the location is great, with easy access to the airport, downtown, and surrounding areas. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle.  Thanks, Nikki!"
1925661,13496162,2014-05-28,15107853,Jim,"Had a fantastic time staying with B. She was a fantastic host who was very kind, caring, and helpful. Very happy that I chose to stay here and was just what I needed. "
1925661,13723256,2014-06-02,2124982,Michael,Beatriz was a wonderful host for our 3 night stay in her home. The room with private bath was clean and comfortable. The home is conveniently located to all amenities. We were made to feel very welcome and shared breakfast and a dinner meal with Beatriz and her other guest. Off-street parking is available and we were able to store our bicycles in her garage. We were very satisfied with our brief stay.
1925661,14995948,2014-06-30,152736,Candice,"Bea was such a kind and gracious host. She gave us rides from and to the station and was very responsive before and during our stay. The place was incredibly clean and so comfortable with a ton of privacy (private bathroom and hallway). The home is several blocks away from the light rail station but it was nice to have that option to get into town to see the sights. We highly recommend this lovely room and host! Thanks, Bea! "
1925661,15126187,2014-07-02,9451204,John,"I was heading last minute to Seattle for meetings in Bellevue and wanted a clean, safe, easy to access I-90 place to stay. Beatriz has a great set up with really a little private apartment with its own bath / bedroom and the place was spotless and easy to find, Beatriz is also a kind and wonderful hostess."
1925661,16870653,2014-08-03,16058006,Rachel,Beatriz was very sweet and great to stay with. Her house is incredibly clean and she was very helpful. She even gave me a ride to the Bolt Bus station when I left. I would recommend staying with Beatriz and her family to anyone!
1925661,18897329,2014-09-02,19228209,Noel,"Costumer Service: 

B was a great host. She made my partner and I feel at home. She surprised us with a really good-healthy breakfast our first morning and her overall hospitality was excellent. 

Location: 

Conveniently from Seattle's downtown, walking distance from great restaurants, bars and public transportation. 

Overall, the place was very homely and welcoming. 

Thank You -B-.

1925661,19755890,2014-09-17,21146059,Lara,"Awesome airbnb experience!  The room is situated on the main floor, but very private.  Has its own bathroom and closet.   Bed was comfortable for 2 guests.  The house is in a safe neighborhood and very close (walkable) to light rail which took us everywhere we wanted to go.  The house sits on a busy street with some noise. Bea was a wonderful hostess...welcoming and helpful attitude.  Coffee and breakfast offered in the mornings.  Would absolutely stay here again!"
1925661,20053977,2014-09-22,1789803,Victoria,"Absolutely I would recommend this property to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. Very quick access to the freeways, CenturyLink, Pike Place, SeaTac, and in a quiet neighborhood. I was in and out of town so quickly I didn't even meet Beatriz, but from beginning to end of my interactions with her she was sweet, accommodating and kind. Her property reflects her personality. Nice clean, private room and bathroom. Her yard is beautiful and her dog is a total sweetheart!"
1925661,24256026,2014-12-23,24879127,Jenna,"Beatriz was a very welcoming and hospitable host. I was nervous as this was first experience using Airbnb. The site was recommended by my dental hygienist. I love adventures and traveling so I thought why not give it a try.
I was blown away by my experience. Beatrix was so kind and helpful. Not being from the area she gave me great advice and was so willing to help in any way possible. The room is very private and the bed was comfy. The house was the perfect temperature "
1925661,28902308,2015-03-31,3261342,Ayten,"I had a great time staying with Beatriz. She has a lovely, well-maintained and clean home. The bedroom has a private bathroom, which gives you a lot of privacy. The house is also a short walk away from the link, which makes transportation easy. There is wifi in the house and if you ask Beatriz, she will give you the password. Most important of all, Beatriz is a lovely and kind person and I feel lucky to have met her."
1925661,29874911,2015-04-13,5171971,Jack,"Staying at Bea's home was a pleasure. We didn't see a whole lot of each other - I was in town for an event and out most of the time - but she was great to be around when we were both home at the same time, and the room was clean and comfortable. I'd stay again without thinking twice."
1925661,30355984,2015-04-20,30946490,Sheila,"Beatriz (the host): quite nice and helpful....picked me up at the train station and showed me around her neighbourhood. She lent me her overcoat as weather was much cooler.

Room: love it.......privacy and quiet....private room, external private (email hidden)l part of a ""big"" room..

Location: residential area yet accessible to light rail by short walk (within 10 minutes) on easy walk.

"
1925661,33160782,2015-05-25,33072211,Joanne,"Beatriz has a charming home, very clean, quiet (except for some early morning weekday traffic) and close to downtown Seattle.  I was there only in the evenings, essentially just to sleep, felt very comfortable.  I did not have a lot of contact with Beatriz, but when I did, I found her to be kind and gracious."
1925661,34875050,2015-06-13,22454837,Erica,"I'm moving to Seattle for a job and chose Bea's house for my temporary housing for two weeks. The location is great. In my apartment hunting, I can easily go to most places within 10 to 20 minutes. A friend living in Seattle and familiar with the cities, who sent me home for a couple times, said the location is great as it is close to everywhere. Neighborhood is quiet and safe.

The room gives a lot of privacy. You will love the privacy when you need to rest or just want to have a little time of yourself. Room is well decorated, as well as everything needed, including your own bathroom and a walk-in closet. Bea keeps her house clean and tidy at all time. She also has a very nice little yard, where I enjoyed some of my leisure time too.

Bea and her families are so nice and friendly. Not only they provide me everything I need, but also they treat me as a friend of the family and I feel so lucky to got to know them when I move into a new city. 

And the a little puppy is the sweetest one I've known.

I love my stay with Bea and her families. High recommended."
1925661,35403860,2015-06-18,16395906,Laurie,Beatriz was a great host. We felt welcomed into her home while still having a lot of privacy. Her home is well situated near the light rail. There's a great coffee shop close by and a small grocery store as well. We were happy to be able to drive some days and leave the car at her house others. Beatriz' home is very clean and the suite (bedroom/bathroom) had everything we needed. Thank you!
1925661,42943659,2015-08-16,36584332,Jiang,"It was such a wonderful treat to stay with Beatriz. She is a kind and warm person, and I felt instantly welcomed. She also helped me greatly during my visit to Seattle, and it was a pleasure to spend time together with her."

1925661,46131936,2015-09-08,27655164,George,"Bea welcomed us when we arrived and showed us our very private bedroom and bathroom. She invited us to use the kitchen and provided coffee, English muffins, bagels and eggs. We were delighted when she invited us for Sunday dinner with her family and enjoyed a lively discussion on books and traveling, and found that we shared a love of  history with her son and his girlfriend, recent law school graduates. Bea lives with her college student daughter and a cute dog named Chico, which looks just like Toto. The house is on a busy street, but we were so tired after touring all day that the traffic noise didn't bother us. Bea's home is very clean and ""green."" "
1925661,46629918,2015-09-12,13538773,Bert,"A very enjoyable visit with Bea. Easy access to public transportation. A family neighborhood. Very comfortable bed. Sitting on the deck at the back of the house after a busy day was a special treat. We especially enjoyed the dinner Bea prepared and shared with us and her family. A great hostess, a great facility, making it a wonderful visit for us."
1925661,47699627,2015-09-21,38967657,Jim,"I had a very pleasant stay in Beatriz' home. She was very welcoming and friendly, and the description of the accommodations was accurate. She lent me an umbrella on the only (!) rainy day that week, and offered to pick me up from the nearby transit station if needed. Her family is wonderful, and that includes Chico, a very friendly and cute little dog. Beacon Hill is aptly named, with some elevation changes to the transit station (next to a great coffee shop) and to Lake Washington, but both are easy to get to. The neighborhood is quiet, with some morning traffic during the week. "
1925661,49692723,2015-10-05,30841383,Nadia,"Bea's was an excellent host -- very warm and friendly! The suite was very spacious and private, just as is depicted in the photos. The room is very clean and Bea provided clean towels, bathroom items, and easy access to the internet. The location is easy for street parking, and a lovely walk from the Beacon Hill LINK station. (I did the walk each morning and evening with much ease)"
1925661,55208675,2015-11-29,45767884,Keijiro,Bea was so nice and very helpful during my stay. The room was quiet and comfortable. The room and bathroom were completely separately from main area of the home so that privacy could be kept. I didn't use public. transportation but it was so close to downtown.
6482984,34687195,2015-06-10,8759652,Jason,"Srikanth and his wife are very friendly and accommodating hosts.  They made sure I had fresh sheets and towels and provided clear instructions for access to the building / unit. Their home is very clean and cozy, and the room is quite comfortable.  There is not much privacy as the room is close to the living room and there is an open space between the top of the door and the ceiling.  But this was a non issue for me and they were very friendly and respectful of my privacy.  "
6482984,35442443,2015-06-18,21373015,Jeff,Srikanth was a great host. He is warm and fun to talk with and a great cook!  The apartment has the most amazing views and is in a great location for the city. Room is semi private in that the door is a rolling screen that has a gap between the ceiling and the top of the door and can't be locked. It is the other side of the apartment from the main bedroom so it felt private to me regardless.
6482984,38542476,2015-07-16,10315951,Isaac,"Shoba and Srikanth are both great and friendly people. They made my stay in Seattle much more special. The acommodation was very comfortable and enough if you are there for some days. It's really close to many touristic attractions, just a 10-minute walk. Highly recommended!"

6482984,41680503,2015-08-08,4908256,Bob,"Srikanth and his wife made me feel  welcome before I even met them. He helped me in many ways and even took time to acquaint me with my ""smart[er than me] phone"". He even waited up for me the first night as I arrived late and hungry. Thanks Dad...I mean Commander! 
My short stay was great. Location is PERFECT in a very new,  spiffy apt. bldg. You can walk to everything or get a cheap ""flat rate"" taxi if you get worn out or have a bad knee like me. The room is as advertised and I was quite comfortable. If/when I go back I won't stay anywhere else if I am alone."
6482984,41772524,2015-08-09,10849846,Mark,Very friendly and welcoming couple; room was exactly as advertised. 
6482984,42309806,2015-08-12,38840074,Zhehui,Srikanth and Shoba are great hosts! The room is as described and they respected my privacy very much. I had authentic Indian food on the night of arrival because they were having a party (great timing!). The rooftop is beautiful in sunset. 
6482984,42484451,2015-08-13,40825379,Phillip,Srikanth is a superb host! This was my first experience to Airbnb and to the city of Seattle. I could not have asked for a better start. Srikanth made me feel at home immediately and helped me get to where I needed to go. He was perfectly accommodating and was quick to help me find a bus for transportation. It's about ten to twelve city blocks from the bus station. If you can travel light enough you can walk it. The view from the apartment cannot be beat!
6482984,42930829,2015-08-16,2126305,Marsh,"My hosts were phenomenal people. Not only did they welcome me for 2 nights into their luxury apartment, but we had some amazing business networking. They were very generous with intros to their Seattle business contacts and are super friendly people. Great location and very affordable too. I will definitely come back again!!"
6482984,44429502,2015-08-26,22854420,Caithlin,"Fantastic experience from start to finish. Srikanth provided very easy to follow instructions for my arrival. He met me at the lobby and gave me the mind-blowing tour of his amazing apartment and all its facilities. He and his wife were very helpful and friendly and respectful of privacy etc. If I ever visit Seattle again, I would not stay anywhere else. Great location too!"
6482984,44709599,2015-08-28,23339204,Renjie,"It's a really good experience as my first stay on Airbnb. Srikanth is helpful in giving me advices on living in Seattle. He and his wife even cooked delicious Indian curry as I asked him for recommendations on curry restaurant. The dinner is one of the best curry I've ever had. The view was excellent. You can see space needle and the bay on the west. The sunset view was great. Due to the condo system, it's better to discuss an exact time for check in. Overall, the experience is great."
6482984,45099023,2015-08-31,38028514,William,Very hospitable from start to finish.
6482984,46081233,2015-09-07,43136085,Frances,"Srikanth and his wife were very friendly and helpful during my stay in Seattle. They were both very welcoming and more than willing to help if you had any questions or concerns. They were accommodating and I would recommend that anyone stay here. Their place is in a convenient location downtown, and can practically walk anywhere.   "
6482984,46667800,2015-09-12,1349849,Arumbakam,"I had a most pleasant stay at Srikanth and Shoba's place. The location can't be beat, close to everything in a modern luxury condo building. The hosts are warm, affectionate and friendly people. I shall not  hesitate to stay here again.
The only negative aspect is the space is actually a den not a true bedroom with sliding door to the living room and the bed itself even though comfortable is fit for one person and not ideal for a couple. Of course the bath room is shared. So there may be privacy issues."
6482984,47576628,2015-09-20,32039522,Tango,"A great experience to stay in Seattle with Srikanth and his wife! He provides lots of the information about Seattle and even bring me to explore all the facilities of this luxury apartment! Don't forget to enjoy the sunset on top of the roof, such a great scene! Also, the bedroom is great with a real bed which let me easy to sleep! One more thing, Srikanth and his wife give me a great Dosa brunch, nice curry and I really enjoy it! "
6482984,48978157,2015-09-29,24951322,David,Wonderful couple; very kind and helpful and welcoming; very accommodating for my schedule.  Bed was comfortable and view was great. 
6482984,49383927,2015-10-03,29984689,Nasser,"Great location, welcoming couple, unlimited help, & nice place. Love it and will come again. "
6482984,49527502,2015-10-04,44489521,Cameron,"Srikanth and Showa made me feel very welcome in their house - terrific views, great facilities. It was a pleasure to get to know both of these people, even for a short time."
6482984,52029571,2015-10-25,17742169,Bruno,"Shrikant and his wife are very nice hosts. The place, is exactly as described, and has a fantastic location with a great grocery store nearby and  a movie theater is just nearby, in the center of the city.
The building offers great views with a rooftop, a private lounge and gym. I will certainly come back when in Seattle. 
Thanks Shrikant!"
6482984,52468535,2015-10-29,8648877,Cameron,Amazing location - great access to all amenities. Thank you for the great time in Seattle. I will be back!
6482984,53624752,2015-11-10,675798,Chor,"Showa is the best host ever! When she found out I was moving to Seattle, she even got me a list of apartments around the neighbourhood to check out- what a lovely surprise for me when I walked through the door. Perfect for 1 person (it's a twin bed), and the sliding doors provided me with the privacy I needed. This listing is absolutely accurate. Everything you need (restaurants, cafes, etc.) are within walking distance, and very convenient. Showa took the time to orient me as to where things were, and tell me all about Seattle. We had great discussions about everything, and I couldn't ask for a better introduction to this city. I'd definitely recommend this listing for anyone who needs a place to stay. "
4550199,37892884,2015-07-11,747114,Bob,The house is lovely.  It's a home with nice furnishings and decor with super nice appliances.  We like this neighborhood in Seattle and having a sweet Metropolitan Market just down the block in nice.  Very easy working with Jason.  
4550199,38627635,2015-07-17,36176454,Shankar,"We live in Seattle and had family with kids visiting us, we rented this space to make our guests feel welcome and at home. 
It is exactly as described and extremely homely. The area is an older neighbourhood which means it is quaint, quiet, green and very residential. It is even then very walkable and close to grocery, yoga studios, parks, the U Village mall and the water front. Street parking is plenty if you need it; downtown, Eastside, Cap Hill are all very accessible by car.
The home itself is stunning. Someone has put a lot of thought and care into decorating this space and each item seems picked with a lot of discrimination. The media room is large with plenty seating, comfortable and the kids spent much time there. The backyard is beautifully decorated and was perfect for relaxing in the evening. The kitchen is well stocked.
The hosts themselves are incredible. The house was spotless and they left a box of mini brownies for us which we relished. The fan was left on at the window which was very welcome in the hot summer we've had this year. I would highly recommend this space for anyone looking a little outside the down town area."
4550199,39200345,2015-07-21,36754799,Ronald,"We want to thank Jason and his family for providing such a wonderful home for to use during our visit to Seattle.  Everything was as described and we could not have asked for anything more.  The house,  yard, toys,  and appliances were great. I would highly recommend staying at this location and will plan on it ourselves when we return."
4550199,40119682,2015-07-28,2177112,Stefano,"Hosts gave us everything we needed, and let us have our privacy. The house is wonderful. Very cozy and pleasant. All beds were clean and comfortable. The whole house is like something you'd see in the Home and Garden magazine or Pinterest. Wonderful back yard with a grill and seating area. Kitchen is wonderful, it was nice to be able to make breakfast and dinner with ease. The store down the street is the most epic grocery store ever. Its like going to Pikes Place Market, but on a supermarket size/level. The freshest fruits and veggies, meats, ready-to-eat meals, a bakery, deli, seafood, and so much more. Our stay here will be remembered for years to come. Highly recommend. "
4550199,41106305,2015-08-04,37000590,Max,"We had a wonderful time visiting Seattle! My wife and I came from out of state with our 4 kids and this home was perfect for our 6 day stay. The home is lovely, functional, well stocked, great appliances and very comfortable. Our kids loved playing in the basement and the backyard. It's in a nice neighborhood with easy access to downtown, waterfront, shopping, etc. I would absolutely recommend this house to anyone visiting the area.  Also, Jason was very easy to work with, responsive, and professional."
4550199,43178018,2015-08-17,8019505,Mikel,"La casa es simplemente perfecta: cómoda, bonita y con todo lo que puedes necesitar. Camas fantásticas, salón con megasofá, cocina más equipada imposible... El mejor alojamiento de todo el viaje."
4550199,55199070,2015-11-29,39612329,Elizabeth,This was our first Airbnb experience and we loved our stay here!  Our host Jason provided us with all of the information that we needed to check in and out and feel comfortable in between.  The house was decorated for the holidays and was absolutely charming.  We were in town for the Thanksgiving weekend and while dinner was at another house we were able to host a post Thanksgiving movie thanks to the generous seating in the downstairs family area.  Additional perks include walking distance to Metropolitan Market and close proximity to parks for the little ones.  Really great stay.
8273031,50389125,2015-10-11,45684464,Mandy,"Our hosts were extremely accommodating and gracious. The neighborhood was cool and fun. Our kids loved the ice cream store and the field down the block. The restaurants in the area were amazing. The apartment had a huge flat screen with Xbox and Apple TV in the living area and a projector in the bedroom. The hosts went out of their way and brought our kids an Xbox game that just came out. They were responsive to any questions we had. Overall, this was such an amazing place to stay."
7247720,38464172,2015-07-15,2471226,Sue,This home is on a fairly busy street that quiets down during the evening. It is close to the great restaurants of the seattle university district.  I stayed in a modest room with its own bath.  The room was clean and comfortable. The host are friendly and charming. They made me feel welcome. This is a great place to stay if you are visiting the university. 
7247720,38681416,2015-07-17,28945897,Edmund,"A good stay! Scott and Delmis were warm and friendly and very accommodating as I had booked at short notice. House is easy to access via buses and just around the corner from the stop. The room comes with its own attached bathroom, which was well-stocked with toiletries/hairdryer, etc. (Guys, I loved that yummy muesli bar on the bedside table!) Bed was comfy. My room was the front one, with a window facing the street, so by 7am one hears sounds of cars zooming by, plus airplanes start flying overhead (a point only for light-sleepers to note). The neighborhood has many shops and eateries to explore! Would gladly stay again :)"
7247720,39100326,2015-07-20,12486582,Nancy,"Scott, Delmis, and their son were extraordinary hosts. Their home was very clean and they provided plenty of essentials like soap conditioner shampoo toothpaste towels. Each room that they list has its own bathroom and they provide plenty of privacy. They offered great advice about the local restaurants and entertainment. They made coffee for us every morning and when asked Delmis if you knew how to make Cuban coffee he made me the best Cuban coffee I ever tasted. Their home is centrally located in the University District where there is lots of stuff to do and plenty of delicious restaurants to visit. The bus stop is only a block away and gives you access to the entire city with public transportation. These are amazing people and we were lucky to have found them on Air Bnb. 
"
7247720,40003224,2015-07-27,38106822,Jaiime,"Scott and Delmis were very welcoming and accomodating. They made me feel at home (away from home). Their home was clean and always felt safe and confortable. Both have great personalities and are very friendly. The room had it's own bathroom, closet area, shelves, and a desk. The bed and pillows were incredibly confortable. Home is located conveniently located near bus stops that will take you anywhere in Seattle. All bus stops within 2 blocks or less from their home. I had a wonderful experience staying with them, and this was my first time booking through airbnb, if I travel to Seattle in the future, they will be my first choice and I will gladly stay with them again."
7247720,40666752,2015-08-01,35238219,Jaime,"Scott and Delmis were great hosts! The room looked exactly as listed- no surprises. I always felt very safe walking around the neighborhood at all hours of the day. They were both very friendly and answered all my questions regarding transportation, things to do in the city, etc. Their home is located only blocks away from the university. I would definitely stay here again! "
7247720,41258777,2015-08-05,39081042,Donnie,"The hosts welcomed me and provided useful information about things to do in the area. I felt very comfortable talking to them, and they welcomed me into their beautiful home. The room was comfortable and homey. Although it wasn't a big issue for me, there is considerable noise from the street, but mainly during the early morning rush. At night, things are pretty quiet. Also, during this summer's heat wave, the house is pretty warm until a nice breeze comes through."
7247720,41646288,2015-08-08,38197881,Dorian,"If I could give six stars, I would. The room and house were beautiful and completely exceeded my expectations. Scott and Delmis were both unbelievably nice and welcoming. I would very highly recommend staying here, and hope to come back."
7247720,42164670,2015-08-11,637418,Zaw,Scott and Delmis are the best hosts anyone can ask for. The location can't be beat and the room was very clean and comfortable. They made us feel right at home and even made us sourdough pancakes for breakfast!
7247720,42898776,2015-08-16,24691303,Axel,"We had a nice time staying with our friendly hosts Scott and Delmis. Though they were busy working there was always time to give us information on what to do and see. 
The house was clean and we could use all the facilities. As cyclists they could give us assistance with repairing our bicycles.
We would always come back to stay with Scott and Delmis in the future."
7247720,43985356,2015-08-23,39660926,Hana,"Both Scott and Delmis made me feel extremely welcome from the moment I walked in the door. They were great at anticipating my needs. It was my first time in Seattle and they helped me get my bearings, were very patient, and gave me suggestions and recommendations when I asked for them. They were very approachable and I felt like I could ask questions and that they would be responsive if something urgent and living space related would have come up. They strike me as natural hosts.

The room and bathroom were both lovely, neat, and well stocked with linens. The living room and kitchen were also free of clutter and relaxing. I had everything I needed. Other houseguests/visitors I met during my stay were all friendly, polite, and interesting people as well. I slept great! In addition, the nights I was out late, they left the porch light as well as a small living room lamp on for me-- very much appreciated and welcoming.

The neighborhood is AWESOME. I am glad I chose to stay there-- it was tough to get a sense of Seattle since I had never visited so I was guessing but the location was truly convenient. It is close to the 5, 10 minutes from downtown without traffic (with public transit available), and I had an easy time visiting shoreline, mercer island, pike, and bothell. But the best part is probably the district the house is in itself-- there were many coffee shops and eateries to explore, as well as udub, all within walking distance. It was really nice to have a break from driving and more fun and relaxing to explore on foot. In addition, parking outside the house was very easy. A great balance of urban and hip with plenty of convenience."
7247720,44583733,2015-08-27,33370462,Dan,"I stay at a lot of Airbnbs when I travel for work but I can honestly say that Scott and Delmis were some of the greatest hosts I have encountered. They made me feel very welcome in their beautiful, comfortable home. The location is excellent right in the U district and they even included a list of their recommended restaurants and things to do in the area. A++++"
7247720,45869740,2015-09-06,2353326,Carson,"Scott and Delmis were better hosts than we could've ever dreamed of. Amazing space and they had never ending helpful advice of spots to visit, activities to do, and places to eat. They truly open up their home to you (we woke up to pancakes the first morning) and make you feel welcomed and comfortable. The room itself was great and the house was incredible. Literally, the perfect hosts. "
7247720,47399750,2015-09-18,43036392,Duane,"Scott and Delmis were very friendly and I immediately felt welcome in their home. The room/bath, community space, and amenities were as described and the location is very close to the University. While I was on a busy schedule in Seattle (gone early/back late), I did not have the opportunity to utilize all of the amenities and the hosts were very respectful of my rest and privacy. Great hosts! I look forward to a return stay on my next trip to Seattle."
7247720,47853443,2015-09-21,39251779,Dana,"Staying here again for the second time was great! Scott & Delmis are great hosts and have the answers what's fun and where to go.
I really don't want to write a review as this is such gem & secret in the city I don't want to share. BUT it really is worth your time & money and a great place to stay while you visit Seattle. 
- Dana Baird"
7247720,48397432,2015-09-26,40229635,Shirleanne,"Scott and Delmis have a lovely house and were great hosts! The key code entry was super convenient. Room is cute and clean. The neighborhood is close to UW, about a 20min walk.  I didn't end up cooking, but it's nice to have kitchen amenities in case!"
7247720,49754206,2015-10-05,6106046,Lauren,Scott and Delmis were great hosts. Super friendly and great communication. The room was clean and comfortable. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this stay for friends. 
7247720,52764502,2015-11-01,28998346,Carl,"Excellent space in a great part of town, plenty of room and privacy, along with great suggestions from Scott and Delmis (Morsel and CPG were both awesome).  Great price for being so close to the Univ. District, along with just a 20 minute drive to just about anything you could want to do in Seattle (Fremont, Queen Anne, Capitol Hill, etc.)  Cozy room with a shower attached, can't go wrong."
7247720,55219137,2015-11-29,46775345,Gwendy,"Scott and Delmis were consummate hosts!  They provided very useful information prior to our trip that made access and logistics very easy.  Parking was readily available on the street in front (with pass).  The bedroom, adjacent living room, kitchen and bathroom are beautifully appointed.  The house is located conveniently near bus lines, I-5, the University District and the University of Washington campus.  Scott and Delmis  also provided very useful information about recommended local restaurants and events.  We thoroughly enjoyed our conversations with our hosts and with the other guests.  We certainly will return when we next come to visit our son at UW, and we highly recommend this as a convenient, friendly and extremely attractive destination for anyone traveling to Seattle."
3773417,17538247,2014-08-13,14808174,Elizabeth,"Mike gave excellent directions to his place, left out towels and a bar of chocolate, along with a few guides to the city with his personal recommendations. He also offered to give us some recommendations over the phone during our stay. 

The apartment itself was exactly as advertised--Mike was very frank about what we could expect, including the noise level from the construction next door (which was only an issue for us on one morning). He also let us know that workmen might be coming through the apartment during our stay, and gave us the option to cancel or accept a discounted rate for our stay, which we very much appreciated. He was also very responsive to our questions. 

Overall, we could hardly have asked for a better location for our trip, and Mike was a considerate host.  "
3773417,17810486,2014-08-17,1622778,Jon,"Mike was a really great host. His apartment is exactly as described in the pictures and worked perfectly for my friend and I who were visiting Seattle for the first time. The neighborhood is amazing, a close walk to great bars and restaurants, and Mike was more than happy to give us recommendations for things to do in the area. If you're looking for an affordable place to stay in Capitol Hill this is a great option."
3773417,18154402,2014-08-22,16809056,Jason,Clean and spacious apartment with parking in an excellent area. I would absolutely stay here again! 
3773417,20541200,2014-09-30,21835399,Carolina,Wonderful location. Mike was very nice. Would recommend staying here.
8829472,51237297,2015-10-18,8030092,Rita,"This apartment is brand new with a spectacular view of the space needle, downtown and Lake Union. It only takes a few short minutes to access all downtown has to offer or any public transit you may need. The roof-top lounge is perfect for a beverage and relaxing after a day on the town. The apartment was spotless and has all the amenities you  could want. Daniella responded to my every text and email immediately and was very helpful. I highly recommend this apartment for a couple looking for a comfortable, modern, urban, 26th floor chill pad! "
8829472,51991073,2015-10-25,1892340,Howard,"Stunning 26th-floor views make this already amazing ultra-modern boutique apartment even better. Everything's here including a totally efficient washer and dryer -- as well as a dishwasher. Perfectly located  in Seattle's Belltown section. You're close to all sorts of  restaurants, coffee shops and even the Space Needle. Check-in went extremely well. Daniela responds to all questions within minutes! She has this place packed with all the big (and little) things you'll need for a terrific visit."
8829472,55500618,2015-12-01,2197777,Jonathan,"The Belltown Condos couldn't haven't been better suited for our Seattle holiday weekend.  Located on the 26th floor the views of the city and Space Needle are fantastic.  The condo is also within walking distance to Pike Place Market, Chihuly Garden and Glass (which is a must see) and the vibrant nightlife on 2nd Ave.  Jocelyn was an outstanding host and even greeted us with a bottle of wine to start our vacation.  I would highly recommend a stay at the Belltown Condos for both short and long stays.  "
8829472,56280710,2015-12-11,7306521,Matthew,"I had a great stay at Jocelyn's place. The apartment was beautiful, very clean and great location. The host provided every amenity I needed and went above and beyond to accommodate my needs such as early check in. I will definitely be staying here in the future! Loved it!"
8829472,57154667,2015-12-22,29072469,Sherzod,Thanks to Daniela and Barsala Suites for an amazing place to stay during our visit in Seattle. The apartment was clean and we have definitely enjoyed the view. The location was perfect - 15 minute walk away from major attractions. Would stay here again my next visit. 
9449062,56870340,2015-12-19,114107,Ronald,"Kara’s apartment was perfect for my needs. Although the building is old (it's historic) it's well-maintained and the apartment itself looks new. Very clean and tidy, and quiet neighbors. The neighborhood is a bit gritty, but nothing unexpected for any urban location. Convenient for downtown Seattle. "
19619,90315,2010-09-04,217396,Ross,"We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves in this unit. With a 3 year old, having the separate sleeping area was a must and being walking distance to the Space Needle,Pike Place and close to the Woodland Zoo was an additional bonus. It is like a home away from home. "
19619,113001,2010-10-06,232709,Katie,"We loved our stay at Sally and Darik's place!  Our only complaint is that we didn't stay longer.  It was beautifully decorated, super clean and walking distance to everywhere we wanted to explore.  Would definitely come back to stay again.  So comfortable and DEFINITELY better than staying in a hotel. Great experience! "
19619,753138,2011-11-29,182610,Sarah,"Everything about this stay was top drawer.  It was easy to book - Darik was responsive to questions I had ahead of time.  We received great information before we arrived - the person who was to meet us when we got there was prompt and helpful showing us around the place.

The unit was really well-appointed and well stocked with everything we could need.  The condo project''s common gym was very complete - even went in the jacuzzi which was pleasant.

We were three people and my mom who is 85 slept in the bedroom.  My husband and I took the pull-out couch - which usually strikes fear in the heart (great Seinfeld about Elaine sleeping in the pull-out at Jerry's parents' place).  Anyway, Darik said it was comfy - and it WAS.
Tempurpedic - nice and firm but not too firm.  Great nights' sleep.  

The unit was great for 3 people and  4 would be fine too. "
19619,827394,2012-01-02,1157170,Esther,"Awesome location and views and very professionally and courteously hosted.  We were a little bummed that the hot tub was unavailable during our stay, but it was New Year's weekend and they had to wait for a part - totally understandable.  

Our wifii went out but Darik came over himself to fix it on New Year's Eve - great service!!! :)"
19619,867376,2012-01-17,1378857,Karen,"darik was a great host!  the condo looked exactly like the photos in the profile.  everything we could possibly have needed in a condo rental was provided (i.e. linens, kitchen-ware, toiletries, etc).  if we ever had a question about anything, darik was easy to get a hold of.  he also provided a full tour of the complex and provided a bunch of great recommendations for restaurants nearby.

the condo itself had a spectacular view of the sound.  it was also central to everything (5-7 minute walk to pike place market and just a few doors down to a good handful of great restaurants).  

all in all, we very much enjoyed our stay!"
19619,907467,2012-02-07,1606906,Pearl,"The room was very clean and comfortable. It has a great view of the Puget Sound and nice sunsets. It was conveniently located; with just a brisk walk away from a number of restaurants, cafes, museums, the harbor, and other attractions. The bed was very comfortable to sleep on and the jacuzzi was just the thing after a long trek around the city. The Host was very accommodating and even extended our check out time since our flight home was not till much later in the evening. If any other questions or concerned came up, the Host was easy to get a hold of. It was a great first experience of Seattle and Airbnb. "
19619,1124823,2012-04-13,1973385,Alexis,Nice condo !
19619,1840651,2012-07-30,733379,Alie,"What a great little condo!  Comfortable, clean, all he necessary amenities for a long weekend (including a binder full of ideas and suggestions).  The kids loved the pool and hot tub. Accessible to key Seattle points of interest, we never had to get in our car. We could walk around Belltown, the market, the waterfront, Seattle Center - that was great.  And the fact that our car was secure and parked for free was nice too. I would recommend this spot with its central location, comforts and great view to anyone spending a long weekend in Seattle."
19619,2052968,2012-08-21,2635776,Ryan,"Great place and great host. Darik was really helpful in getting us settled in and told us the route to take on our way out of Seattle to avoid construction and traffic. We would have sat in traffic with two young kids and his tips provided invaluable. The condo was beautiful - well decorated, comfortable and well stocked. It was a perfect alternative to a hotel and had all the same amenities and comforts you'd expect from a high end place. The vacation guide binder in the room was so helpful with restaurant listings, activities, etc. We appreciated their family-friendly tips too. They have really thought things through.  We've already recommended to friends."
19619,3039528,2012-12-08,2550602,Melissa,"The apartment is beautiful and in a fantastic location. Easy check in & out. Great information (restaurants, attractions, shopping) provided to make the most of your stay. We had a wonderful time! Highly recommend!"
19619,3273471,2013-01-05,3266052,Paul,"We were pleasantly surprised to find the condo fully stocked with coffee, tea, filters, spices including salt and pepper, dishwasher and laundry detergent.  Also softener for laundry.  Shampoo, rinse, soap and basic bathroom supplies were also there.  The location was excellent being near so many tasty restaurants and well-stocked bars.  It was only a 15 minute walk to the center of town with major retailers and less time to Pike Place market filled with many things.  We discovered a Target store on Pine street between 1st and 2nd with a full stocked grocery.  We highly recommend this place for anyone wanting a true downtown Seattle experience and see how easy it is to have everything at your fingertips with only a walk to take.  As for a car it was very easy to get in and out of the parking garage.  The pool and fitness rooms were also very good to use.  The pool was warm and the jacuzzi was nice and hot.  We will recommend to our friends using Seattle Oasis  Airbnb for visiting Seattle.  Thanks, Paul & Karen"
19619,3580705,2013-02-19,308692,Nate,Great location and furnished space. We really enjoyed how close everything was. We didn't have any issues with the place itself.
19619,4415828,2013-05-04,5314887,Mignard,"This apartment is very nice with all the commodities
The view from the room overlook the Olympic mountains is wonderful
It's a really nice place to stay at Seattle

19619,4884924,2013-05-31,1575036,Peggy,"We were very pleased with the apartment! The views are spectacular, and it's fully stocked with everything we needed. The bed was very comfortable as was the pull-out sofa that my sons slept on. The Belltown location was right in the middle of all that we had planned to do, and there were soooo many places to eat! The only negatives I found were that the apartment is starting to show some wear and tear, as is the dryer, but it did not stop us from feeling very comfortable there."
19619,13002112,2014-05-17,3041543,Matthew,"This apartment was terrific.  It has a great view of the harbour, handy underground parking, and was very close to so many things we wanted to see in Seattle.  Check-in and communication was easy, and Darik provided so much great information about the city and the area in the apartment.

The apartment itself was beautiful and clean.  Even the pull-out bed was very comfortable.  If we come to Seattle again, we hope we'll be able to stay here."
19619,30119869,2015-04-18,22307723,Russell,The condo was as advertised. It is beautifully decorated and well equipped. The location is ideal with access to many of Seattle's attractions. We felt very much at home there.
19619,31098775,2015-05-02,18050971,Michelle,"What an amazing location and view! We were greeted promptly and directed to easy parking on-site. The apt is beautiful and I couldn't recommend it more. We were so comfortable here, and were able to easily walk to Pikes Place, the Waterfront and even the Space Needle.  This was a one-of-a-kind experience and place!"
7536219,40680496,2015-08-01,22373415,Max,"Jessica was such a great host.  She was very easy to communicate with, super accommodating, and very helpful with our first time to Seattle.  Although her place is a ""studio"" the bed is tucked into a nook off of the living room, which gives the place the feel of a 1BR.  There was more than enough space for my girlfriend and I during our three-day stay.  The area itself was safe and had lots of little cafes and bars around.  It was right on a bus line into downtown ($2.50) or a quick Uber ride away ($10ish).  Neither of us had any problem with the distance, so it was a great cost-effective alternative to staying downtown."
7536219,41678494,2015-08-08,28832705,Robert,"Jessica's place was cute. I did not get an opportunity to meet her, but she made it very easy to get into the unit in her absence. The location was convenient and right next to a bus stop that goes right into the heart of Seattle.
There is also a great place nearby called Mammoth that has awesome sandwiches and over 40 beers on tap."
7536219,42762255,2015-08-15,30474397,David,"Very nice location! Close enough to most places around town including capitol hill, downtown and the U district. Very out of the way hosting style which worked perfect for me and my friend!"
7536219,44240624,2015-08-24,7760321,Matt,I recently stayed in Jessica's Studio for 4 nights whilst on a business trip and it was perfect! It's incredibly easy/fast to hop on a bus into town (the stop is just 20m from the building entrance) and the Eastlake area was a great intro to Seattle (though I'm sure the incredible weather helped!) Jessica herself was very quick to get back to me whenever I had questions and gave some great suggestions for places to eat/drink (definitely recommend Voxx just down the street for your morning coffee...) All in all a great place to stay and I'd absolutely recommend it if you're planning a few nights in town.
7536219,49848788,2015-10-06,11894605,Austin,"Jessica was super easy to work with. If I had any questions they were answered with a matter of a few hours.  I highly recommend staying here, its located near most everything and Jessica is great to work with."
7536219,51404694,2015-10-19,8756128,Scott,"Fantastic communication, really cute place. Couldn't ask for better.  Thank you!"
7536219,53665102,2015-11-10,33382168,Ailynne,The place is in a great neighborhood. The description is accurate and it is a minimalist apartment that is good if you are eating out most nights and spending your days exploring the city. 
7536219,55852063,2015-12-06,49993623,Dan,"Great, tidy place close to everything.

Parking is better is better than most Seattle neighborhoods. 

Kitchen has all the basics and plenty of room in the fridge for longer stays. 

Free WiFi works OK, and unit has a printer for your laptop. 

Neighborhood has a good selection of walkable restaurants and bars."

9097503,54151658,2015-11-16,672879,Van,First time staying in the Capitol Hill area and would highly recommend it. Lots of great dining options with some really nice bars & weekend brunch spots. Onur's place is in a secured building which is really quiet.  Communicated everything I needed from building/room access to Wi-Fi connection. Great value considering you have the entire flat for a shared unit price.
9097503,55505609,2015-12-01,3773829,Valen,"Onur's place is spacious and quite conveniently close to Capitol Hill's attractions. A grocery store is within walking distance, as well as many notable restaurants. Great value for an entire apartment, given its location and accessibility!"
9097503,55514573,2015-12-01,29385281,Isla,"Checking into the AirBnb was convenient and easy. Although I did not get to meet O in person, I was provided with all the information needed to prior to check in. Communication throughout was quick and friendly

The apartment is clean, quiet, warm. As advertised this is a home so expect the owners personal things to be there and signs of being lived in.

The only improvements I would make would be to the bedding i.e thicker duvet and better pillows. Also leaving some towels out for  guests would be better (this however is available on request).
 
It is walking distance and capitol hill to downtown and a good choice for an affordable place to stay for a weekend in the city. The Neighbourhood is a mixture of historical buildings, world known medical and research institutions.

"
9097503,56740867,2015-12-17,24918311,Morgan,"O has a very neat apartment, and it is located in a great spot. He is very easy to communicate with, and everything worked out perfectly!"
9097503,57043885,2015-12-21,5697397,Erica,"O's home was clean and comfortable. He was a good host, and answered many questions I had about the area. We enjoyed the apartment, there was parking close by and we were able to get everywhere we needed, walked almost everywhere! 

Loved the neighbourhood, went to some nice restaurants and pubs and in some unique shops, reminded me of our neighbourhood in Vancouver. Walked to the public market, and even the 40 min walk to Key Area was enjoyable from this location! Loved our time there, we'll definitely be back."
995443,5073363,2013-06-10,6376210,Ping,"+ General
A very good place to stay. Quiet neighborhood, close to waterfront/downtown, not far from the airport either.

+ Host
Very friendly, helpful, and live next door. This apartment is a ground level side section of the house, so it is separate with privacy and independent entrance, yet connected, so you are not far away from help.

+ Location
We rented a car, so it was not a problem, but we did see bus stops very close by (3-5 min walk), although I don't know the condition of the bus. The lightrail station is less than a mile away (10-15 min walk), and looks very clean and modern from the outside. It was about 15 minutes driving from downtown/waterfront, and 20 minutes driving from airport.

Our rental car lady (credibility unknown) told us where we live is though in the good area, very close to bad regions, so she advised us not to get off the car until we arrive at this place. It gave us the creeps a bit on our way drive there (being in the midnight doesn't help either).

We didn't feel unsafe in that neighborhood though. We came back at close to 11pm once and saw there were plenty of people in that lightrail train when it passed by that neighborhood.

All in all, if your flight arrive late in the night, you probably want to rent a car to get there, otherwise, you should be OK.

+ Inside
Well lit with plenty of lights, washer, dryer, towels, bowls, utensils, good size fridge and microwave, humidifier, electric heater, fan... The width of the sofa bed is between a full and a queen, so it fits me and my wife fairly well. The length is around my height (6'3, 1.91m)."
995443,7251126,2013-09-13,8068619,Valerie,"In September 2013 my husband and I visited Seattle for the first time. We stayed in Tom's place and words cannot express how comfortable we were.  The apartment has no surprises. The pictures are exactly what you will find. The entrance is private, attached near the main home. We felt safe and at home. The kitchenette is perfect but sadly we were out and about so often we only used the area once for cooking.  There are coffee pots, microwave, regular size fridge, lots of extras in the cabinet (coffee, tea, and some household ingredients. {oil, seasonings, etc} ).  We were a 1.3 mile walk to a local Catholic church, and great cafe's.  If you get a chance visit Columbia City Bakery for a delicious pastry and superb coffee. Our walk was along a busy street but we felt safe the entire distance.  Lots of bus stops along the way and also the Lite Rail is a short distance from the apartment. The weather for us was a treat. We did have a bit of rain the first two mornings but otherwise the temps were 70-80's and sunny. The drive to downtown Seattle is quick (15 miles ). Our daughter took us around to see the sights. A must for all travelers is a visit to Pike Market. We visited a Farmer's Market in Magnolia, rode the Ferris Wheel, drove 2 hours south to visit Mnt. Rainier, and many other adventures too numerous to list. We were first time customers of AirBnB and will do it again and again. My husband has already asked me "" When are we going back to rent Tom's place again ?""  Sadly we never did meet Tom in person but we did meet his wife Marina one morning. Thanks again for the great, homey apartment.  Valerie in Pennsylvania "
995443,7314254,2013-09-15,8569456,Janis,"This was our first experience with Air BnB and we could not be happier.  We saved so much over the hotel rates and had a wonderful, quiet, clean and safe place to stay.  This apartment was close to our daughters apartment and made it very easy to avoid all of the Seattle traffic.  I would recommend this apartment to anyone looking for a nice place to stay in Seattle.

"
995443,7420159,2013-09-19,2085874,Hank,"In the basement of a nice home.  Tom was a great host.  Would recommend.

One thing to think about when stayng here is the location.  The street itself is nice, but the overall area is a little sketchy.  That is why this place is such a better value than staying in seattle itself.
If ur planning on taking public transit to seattle be careful at night.  If ur taking the link train it's about a five minute drive to the station, but there is no parking.  Everything is a two hour limit around the station during the week, so u have to park about 3 blocks away.  "
995443,7523350,2013-09-23,8575290,Miguel,"My girlfriend and I had a very pleasant stay at Tom's.  He was very prompt in all communication, even for a question about local farmers' markets.  Logistics were a breeze.

We had a car and parking was very easy--every day we could park right in front of the house.  The apartment is comfortable and light with good amenities.  We appreciated the modern front loading washer, as we arrived with laundry.  Tea in the cupboards was also very nice.

Twice, we ran east through gorgeous neighborhoods becoming mansions to Seward Park.  This park is a lush paradise jutting out into a large body of water.  Beautiful running, walking, or cycling!  Another reviewer described a sketchy neighborhood, which we saw to the west when arriving by car.  However, I walked a mile around this neighborhood, and it struck me as a down-to-earth residential neighborhood with a community garden (on the same street as Tom).  Just up the street are two synagogues, which were celebrating Sukkot while we were there.  Families walked from their nearby homes to celebrate, giving it a small-town, communal feel.  In short, I really like the neighborhood, nestled between restaurants just up Rainier Ave and gorgeous runs around Seward Park.

What would I change?  The apartment smelled musty on our arrival, possibly a danger in any converted basement in a rainy area.  Tom supplies a dehumidifier, so we ran that and left the windows open the 1st day.  The 2nd day it was OK and the 3rd I had forgotten about it.

We would happily return!"
995443,7918424,2013-10-08,8267753,Paige,"I contacted Tom two months prior to my trip. My boyfriend and I were moving to Seattle from California and wanted a place that we could stay while looking for apartments. We informed Tom of this and explained we wanted an extended stay but didn't know how long it would take to find a place to live. We booked a first week, then a second week just to make sure. 
This is a basement/mother-in-law studio apartment. There seems to be a door to the right of the sink that connects to the rest of the house, I could be wrong, it was locked. I was expecting a more separate space from the house with more privacy...because the listing said ""has its own separate entrance with no connection to the rest of the house.""
The utensils (silverware specifically) were filthy and there was a giant dead spider just under the bed that I noticed right away. 
The ""bed"" seems to be a futon mattress atop a full size box spring- not comfortable. 
This was our (my boyfriend and I) first experience with airbnb. We liked that the prices were competitive with hotels, accommodating to pets, extended stays and offered more space. 
Staying in someone's home is exciting and unknown and I love the idea of sharing and supporting local residents. I wasn't expecting to have dinner with Tom but I was expecting to at least see him or shake his hand. I mean we did book a 2 week stay in the basement of his house. Which leads me to another question- if you'e staying for an extended period of time are you (as the visitor) responsible for cleaning? The place wasn't very clean to begin with and after a couple of days, we had trash and no where to put it. These kind of things you expect to not have to worry about while lodging. Tom was dissappointed I didn't communicate these issues with him before posting it in a review. I guess I could've contacted Tom and asked him to come down and clean up the dead spider or wash the sticky silverware but you know I think Tom knew about the condition of the apartment prior to leaving the keys in the mailbox. I'm gonna put that responsibility on him because, well it is his responsibility. 
Three days after arriving to Seattle/Tom's place we found an awesome apartment, emailed Tom, told him the news and cancelled the second week. This left a ""bad taste"" for Tom. You win some you lose some Tom, kind of like how I lost money paying for the rest of the week that I wasn't staying in your basement. Thats the cost of doing business.
Overall, the stay felt like living in your parents basement except their not your parents, their total strangers."
995443,8181475,2013-10-19,7321572,Jacob,"Tom had a very nice space. Communication was simple and it was a very secluded space, which was nice. Would stay again!"
995443,8571831,2013-11-05,1578372,Brooke,"This is a great place to stay! Centrally located, full kitchen, nice neighborhood, bus access, dog friendly, friendly hosts, free parking, free wi-fi, washer/dryer....just great! We were able to accomplish all of our touristic plans, while enjoying the comfort of full amenities! Thank you again, Tom."
995443,9582253,2014-01-03,1961863,Matt,"I'm not sure I have enough words in my vocabulary to praise Tom, Marina & Sam (and their sweet pets) enough. 

We needed a place to stay for 2 months and this was more than adequate. Tom and Marina are generous and inviting people and  were absolutely lovely to deal with on all counts. They were very respectful of our space and privacy and very reasonable and upfront in all our business transactions.

The studio is sort of a ""mother-in-law's apartment"" in their home. It was very clean and well organized. Situated on a quiet neighborhood street. Very private. It has a private entrance and all the comforts of a home. Small fully stocked kitchen. Laundry. Closet. A great place for one or two people who don't mind sharing a large one room studio together.

They are not far from bus stops leading into downtown and a 20 minute walk to the light rail. If you have a car, Graham street (1 block north) leads right to I-5, into and out of town. Super easy. Grocery and shopping centers within driving distance. Great place for dim sum nearby. Food delivery is fairly limited in the area, but Columbia City Bakery, Geraldine's, and the pizza place Tutta Bella are a short drive north. Worth it!

If they would have us, we would be absolutely sure to stay in their place again and again.

My only regret was that, due to our schedules, we didn't get to spend more time with them. I strongly recommend them and their comfy studio. I can't say enough about how great our experience was."
995443,10121297,2014-02-01,6519545,Siobhan,"I really enjoyed staying here; Tom and Marina are friendly and called around on the first night to see how I had settled in. As it has a separate entrance, it's quite private and it is in a very convenient geographic location for me as I was commuting to the Eastside (i90) and also to downtown (Rainier Ave. and i5) for work and meet ups with friends and colleagues. 

Columbia city is nearby which is great for restaurants and casual dining too. The apartment is clean and well stocked. In terms of value, I have no hesitation in recommending Tom's place as a great base for anyone staying in the Seattle area."
995443,13354204,2014-05-26,5053141,Ellis,"We stayed over a weekend.  The apartment is very clean
and comfortable (for my taste, the bed was a bit on 
the soft side).  The apartment has its own entrance and
includes a kitchenette with a full fridge and stove, ample
closet space, and the bathroom has a large, modern shower.
Communication with our hosts was straightforward.  We would
definitely stay here again!"
995443,17196666,2014-08-09,9290231,Cara,"Tom and Marina went out of their way to make me feel welcome, inviting me to dinner on a couple of occasions early in my stay and giving advice about things to do in town. At the same time, they're impeccably respectful of the guest/tenant's privacy. They are wonderful hosts and interesting people. The listing is very accurate, and I personally love the neighborhood. I knew it slightly from when I lived in Seattle and greatly appreciated getting to know it better. It's vibrant and beautiful: Seward Park on the one side, array of international stores and restaurants on the other. I would highly recommend this ""bed-sit"" to anyone. I had a great summer in it!"
995443,19941002,2014-09-21,456864,Jen,Great little studio.  Very convenient to Seward park and to the shops in Columbia city.  All the right amenities and dog friendly too!
995443,20070586,2014-09-22,18838647,Erick,Tom was great and really laid back which was wonderful since we had to have a flexible schedule. There was everything that we needed in the place and it was such an enjoyable stay!
995443,20458145,2014-09-29,3562985,Jessy,"Thank you very much for hosting us! We had a great stay at Marina and Tom's place. Very quiet and clean apart, with everything we needed to cook, rest and even wash our clothes (washer and dryer). Total privacy and close to downtown. Loved it!"
995443,24100141,2014-12-20,3787125,Will,"I stayed at Tom's place for 3 months and it was a great experience, parking was easy, bus stops are close by and they take you directly to downtown! I would definitely come back again!"
995443,52672487,2015-11-01,1511931,Clay,"Tom's Columbia City studio is cozy and extremely comfortable. Due to unforeseen circumstances our stay has extended longer than we had planned, but Tom continues to be a gracious and accommodating host. The unit is furnished with everything a couple of people could need and we were even provided extra fans during a very unusual hot streak. We also can't stress how much it means to us to be be able to have our dog here with us. We're very grateful for Tom's continued hospitality and understanding."
935671,9713401,2014-01-06,10228813,Jeff,We enjoyed the location and apartment facility's of the room we had. Our room was not like the photo's 
935671,9957140,2014-01-21,5474308,Sharon,My friends and I stayed here for 4 nights. The apartment is absolutely wonderful. It fitted all 6 of us with no problem. The place was cozy and nice. It has a very nice view of the Ferris wheel and it is close to Pike Place (we went there everyday). The gym downstairs was great as well. Some of us actually used it everyday. StayAlfred was very quick at responding to any of our questions and was very helpful. 
935671,10451426,2014-02-19,11398619,Rachel,"The two bedroom apartment at Harbor Steps, just blocks from the waterfront was perfect for us.  Plenty of space, a great pool for the kids to swim in, convenient to Pikes Place Market and the waterfront, and a kitchen so we could save money by eating in.  The beds were comfortable, especially the king size in the master bedroom.  The queen size sofa bed was NOT at all comfortable and only suitable for the kids.  I would not advise an adult sleeping on it. The room was very quiet (we never even heard our neighbors or those above us at any point during the weekend).  The space was clean, and the people at the front desk of Harbor Steps were helpful.  There is a small grocery store/deli on site and a Target with groceries 1.5 blocks away.

Keep in mind the the kitchen is equipped only with the basics.  If you needs any staples, spices, etc. bring them from home or plan on purchasing them.  There was a small container of sugar that was almost empty and a few sugar packets.  We wished we had brought our blender and our electric skillet for making pancakes because the frying pan provided only allowed on pancake at a time.  This is not a complaint -- just making sure guests know what to expect.  

The only negative for us was that the hot tub in the swimming pool area was out of service the entire weekend we were there.  We certainly had been looking forward to soaking while the kids swam, so that was a disappointment.  It was certainly an issue that could happen at any location, but we were disappointed that Harbor Steps did not take action to fix it more quickly.  

There were not pool towels, but there was a dryer in the unit, so it was not a problem.  Guests may want to consider brining their own pool towels from home.

We'd definitely stay there again, and would likely choose a view unit.  Reservations can be made directly through StayAlfred as well, but we could not find any two night stays through them (perhaps they have a 3 night minimum  on their site?) Even with the Airbnb reservation charge, we saved money doing it this way because we found a great Airbnb coupon to use and did not have to reserve for 3 nights.  "
935671,11228688,2014-03-25,12814753,Tracy,"A perfect place to live. Convenient and comfortable. We like it very much. A small suggestion to you, you are supposed to tell different guests their exact address to get the key. The general address you provided online is not accurate. We spent an hour to target it, but failed. Until 11:30p.m, we called you several times, no answered. Then called service, finally we got there. Anyway, it is really a good house. We love it."
935671,11790170,2014-04-15,6663228,Peter,"It was really excellent.  Communication was great.  Everything came as promised.  Super location, and the people were very friendly.  No complaints at all!"

935671,18789323,2014-09-01,16096999,Iris,"As expected. No personal touches as it's through Stay Alfreds, but the experience was exactly what we were looking for. Itself was generally well-kept and all the basics were covered."
935671,24347123,2014-12-26,12671468,Tracey,"Listing was accurate.  View was lovely and neighborhood was easy access to Pike's Place, dining and shopping even on Christmas Eve.  Jordan accommodated our dog at the last minute and we really loved having her with us."
935671,24864431,2015-01-03,3250071,Karina,"Perfect location to enjoy downtown Seattle—walking-distance to the Art Museum, nice coffee shops, restaurants, the Pike Place Market, the Crab Pot, the aquarium, the ferry terminal... There are so many things close by we didn't have time to check out any of the amenities in the building. The apartment was very spacious. The kitchen had everything we needed to prepare breakfast. The two bedrooms are comfortable and private, and having two washrooms really made getting ready to go out a lot more efficient. The balcony has a great view of the ocean and the Ferris wheel. I would definitely stay here again when I travel with my siblings and my mom, who all enjoyed our short vacation together. "
935671,27456920,2015-03-05,23773720,Jo,"I was thrilled with staying at the Harbor Steps in Seattle. We had a two-bedroom suite with a full kitchen, dining area with table/chairs, living room, and an open area outside one of the bedrooms/bathrooms. One of our bedrooms had its own bathroom with a very large closet area in which were two fold down beds.

The entire apartment was very clean (save the kitchen drawers). It was quiet, we had a great view, and it was so very, very convenient to downtown. We caught the bus easily, when necessary, but mostly just walked downtown and around the Capitol Hill area. Pike's Place Market was only a couple of blocks away, and we had more than enough restaurants to choose from - all of which were excellent. 

I cannot say enough good things about this place. I would not hesitate to stay there again at any time. The concierge was very helpful, also, which was great when we had to get to the airport."
935671,29722026,2015-04-12,18507244,Todd,"The check in process was very easy. Wonderful facilities, great location, great view. If you are doing business at the conference center or symphony hall, this is so much more pleasurable than a hotel!"
935671,30801762,2015-04-27,29899715,John,"Had a great time in Seattle! This place was awesome, it's in the heart of DT Seattle, you got pikes market down the street, the art museum across the street, it was such a great location to stay at. The apartment was very nice, the complex was very well kept and clean, the concierge was very accommodating. Won't think twice about staying any where else when I'm in Seattle! "
935671,31129933,2015-05-02,11110379,Lori,"Absolutely perfect location with great instructions as to obtaining keys and getting access to the unit.  Seattle is a beautiful city with so much to offer.  The beds were very comfortable with a satisfactory apartment.  Some of the amenities need attention, but everything was comfortable and felt like home for the duration."
935671,32690497,2015-05-20,26174367,Vincent,"Great location, no complaints, didn't get to use the pool facilities as was in other building (2min walk away) and was too busy sight seeing. Place was clean and comfortable. Very minor mix up with car park access but was sorted straight away and was not an issue. 

I would stay here again."
935671,35229199,2015-06-16,3501976,Rijesh,Best place! Awesome place.. Great communication from Jordan. This place is right there in Downtown Seattle with amazing bars and coffee shops. They even have a deli that opens at 7 AM and closes at midnight .. Best place for all the action. Thanks Jordan!
935671,36083286,2015-06-25,28433243,Connie,"This apartment was located in the perfect spot and we took advantage of being in such a convenient spot. Our first delight was seeing the Seattle Art Museum right across the street. Then, 3 or so blocks from Pike Place was striking gold. The three days we were there, we were able to walk to almost everywhere: the ferry, the Waterfront, the Seattle Aquarium, Chinatown/Stadiums, the monorail and more!  The condo comes with use of the great gym and indoor pool  (which were not crowded when we used). Although we did rent a car, an added plus and savings for those driving U.S. The included garage parking spot. From booking to questions, our host Jordan was very prompt in responding and the StayAlfred was very interactive in communicating with us by text, email and phone leading up to our stay. Would definitely stay there again should we plan another trip to Seattle."
935671,52423729,2015-10-29,45100463,Matt,Great location! Unit was very clean and staff was helpful! Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the downtown area. 
935671,52987639,2015-11-03,25505356,Winnie,"They were able to accommodate my earlier check in request, which was really helpful. The place was gorgeous- but the pictures are not what you get in this location/room. I was a little bum that I wasn't walking into this sanctuary that the pictures were giving me a vision- but nevertheless, we were able to live here comfortably for about four days. It had everything that you'll need to live like a home from the kitchen, to bathrooms, to washing machines, and most importantly, free wifi! We were so close to everything in downtown Seattle. It's a perfect spot to stay at while visiting town. "
935671,53612521,2015-11-10,45691353,Teresa,"(2bd, 2ba, 6 people)
This location was perfect! Our trip to Seattle was definitely more enjoyable thanks to the apartment's central location. All amenities listed were available and the space looked better than the pictures provided. 

Jordan responded quickly to any questions I had and my encounter with the StayAlfred staff was beyond wonderful. We actually couldn't figure out how to open the door to the apartment so Amy at StayAlfred sent over the city manager to help us out. 

This apartment was quiet, secure, convenient, and cozy. I would definitely stay here again. "
935671,54008093,2015-11-15,46967166,Dinah,great location.  great unit.  easy to check in and out.  parking is a little tight and can be a challenge but manageable.  the concierge was very helpful.  our garage card was not working.  I called twice to get a replacement but they were not able to get in a replacement over the weekend.  it was not a big deal to us but it was more confusing and annoying to the parking attendant getting us out of the garage.  i will definitely stay here again. 
935671,55224714,2015-11-29,45491510,Rachel,It is a veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery nice place to stay during our 3-day visit in Seattle. Thank you. You make my stay in Seattle so warm and unforgettable!
935671,56743293,2015-12-17,4165027,Igor,"The location was perfect, the condo was clean and exactly as described. Instructions was clear. Very happy with the experience!"
2260626,10252809,2014-02-09,11773232,Sara,I had a wonderful and relaxing stay. Sharan and Preet were very warm and friendly. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend them to friends.

2260626,11012638,2014-03-17,7172402,Konstantin,"We really enjoyed staying here! 
Preet and Sharan did everything to make our stay comfortable. 
We also loved the delicious and varied breakfasts.
We recommend this place to everyone."
2260626,11120561,2014-03-21,12708778,James,"This is a nice quiet place. I liked the privacy it offered, also the fact that you could control the heat yourself. The hosts were also gracious, providing breakfast each morning. All in all, a pretty good experience"
2260626,11203156,2014-03-24,13206375,Betty,"Sharan and Preet were so sweet and hospitable.  The basement room & private bath were very clean and comfortable.  We felt we had our privacy, but really enjoyed visiting with our hosts at both breakfasts.  The location is lovely, with flowers & trees and a nice park with playground just across the street.   The house is very conveniently located with interstate and nice neighborhoods near.  We will definitely go back.   "
2260626,11290510,2014-03-28,8056311,Dino,"Me and my friend had a pleasant stay at Sharan's place. It was clean, quiet, and the bed was very comfortable. Nearby were bus stops that conveniently took us to downtown Seattle."
2260626,11316779,2014-03-29,5633907,Florian,"Sharan and Preet are so sweet ! They were super flexible on our arrival, and did everything to make us comfortable ! The room is really cozy and everything is superclean! We got some tea and cofee, and at morning we had a great breakfast ! So it was an really great stay ! "
2260626,11409108,2014-04-01,9174643,Laurie,"I had a pleasant stay with Sharon. The location was perfect for me, and the room was comfortable. Sharan and Preet were friendly and helpful. The neighborhood was pleasant."
2260626,11538149,2014-04-07,7653353,Andrea,"Very nice -- clean,private, but friendly. And they gave us breakfast."
2260626,11727809,2014-04-13,13922259,Vanessa,"I would like to say thank you so much to Sharan and Preet for their hospitality, the place is beautiful and very clean, in a good location, they always make me feel like at home. Was a great experience my stay in Seattle because of them, definitely a place to stay !!!!"
2260626,12481200,2014-05-03,14655935,Joulien,The room is perfect.  Ultra clean and proper.  There is a nice local brewery close by.  It is very quiet and breakfast Sharan and his significant other provided was delicious.  I would *NOT* hesitate *AT ALL* to stay there again if I ever need to.
2260626,12662612,2014-05-07,13720101,Hannah,"Sharan and Preet were very accommodating and friendly. We spent most of the time out and about, but it was nice coming back to a quiet, private room. Overall it was a lovely stay. "
2260626,12764824,2014-05-10,15020423,Bronwyn,We had a lovely stay with Sharan and Preet. They are gracious hosts and even were able to help us out when we got lost past curfew. They are incredibly accommodating and the free breakfast was a great bonus. Thanks! 
2260626,13016369,2014-05-17,14768032,Vera,"We had a nice stay at Sharans and Preets house! They have been very warm-hearted hosts. The room was quiet and produced a feeling of beging at home. The area around was perfect for groceries, Cafés and public transport access to downtown. If you want to stay in Seattle, stay here!"
2260626,13161352,2014-05-20,4399899,Barbara,"We liked staying at Sharan and Preet's place...the room is small, but private, very clean and comfy. It was a great location for us, as it was located near the events we were attending. They were kind and friendly, but left us alone. We didn't care much for the quality of the continental breakfast, but they were very open to suggestions, and I believe they will make some changes to make it better. All in all, it was a very good experience for us!"
2260626,13323843,2014-05-25,15324880,James,"I had a really great experience here and would definitely recommend Sharan and Preet. When you enter their home from the front door, you must either go up half a staircase or down half a staircase. The bedroom and bathroom are down the staircase, secluded privately from the rest of the home on its own level. The room and bathroom were very clean and there was always a lot of space for parking. We did not interact much with the family--all contact was done with Preet through messaging on Airbnb. However, I did not actively try to engage with the family and ask for sightseeing recommendations, so maybe my experience was unique. The breakfast was minimal, but I've had other Airbnb experiences where  I didn't get any sort of breakfast. "
2260626,13516238,2014-05-29,12913259,Jeff,An extraordinary great host and house! Really convenient to downtown Seattle although looks faraway in the map. Really clean and new room and bathroom. What is even better is the free breakfast. Definitely a good choice if you are going to Seattle.
2260626,13591303,2014-05-31,1874084,Gayle,"I needed one night in Seattle, and was thrilled to find this gem. I was do happy to know I wasn't in the hustle of the traffic, but close enough to know I could jump on the freeway to hit downtown. I was greeted so friendly when I arrived, and couldn't have asked for a better hostess! There was a coffee maker, and a variety of teas and cocoas as well. This room was exactly what I needed, and the shower had great water pressure as well. The communication was fantastic, and I had a basket of breakfast variety waiting for me before I departed in the morning. Great choice, great host!! I recommend highly :)"
2260626,13709498,2014-06-02,13697959,Ulf,"We had a very nice stay at Sharan's place. The bedroom and bathroom are private and clean, it's quiet, and the breakfast was a nice added bonus."
2260626,13933853,2014-06-08,16140213,Liudmila,"Thank you Sharan and Preet for a wounderful stay! 
A room (and all the house) is very beautiful and clean. Hosts are friendly and always attentive to your needs. Preet every day helped me to find some new remarkable sights of the city and  a way to get there. And there is a good access by buses to any place you wish from that place. Besides every morning a breakfast was waiting for me. 
In the house of Sharan and Preet I felt like at good friends. A way better than in a hotel!"
2260626,14007114,2014-06-09,16443873,Tif,"Sharan and Preet were great hosts! They were super warm and friendly. Sharan was quick at replying to our request. The room was clean, quiet, and a quick drive to the city."
2260626,14701952,2014-06-24,1893488,Sunil,Many thanks hosting us at your place. We enjoyed your warm hospitality and friendly advice. Wish you both all the best!
2260626,14881337,2014-06-28,1999992,Ryan,"Experience with this host was very welcoming. Both the host and his wife were very helpful and very giving at any chance. They made staying with them very comfortable and easy. I would definitely recommend the place. It was located in a good neighborhood, in fact I went running one morning in the neighborhood, around 6:30 and I felt very safe: people always stopped their cars to allow me to cross the intersection first and others smiled and/or said good morning as I was passing. There were many good restaurants within walking distance and although my family and I had a rental car, public transportation was very close to their residence. I was pleased that the hosts were not of European American descent because I was able to get to know another area of the world that I was unfamiliar with before meeting them and they were open to talking about. In addition, the hosts were willing to provide one more bed for a third person. Lastly, the hosts invited me to have some dinner with them when they were cooking. I can't guarantee this will happen to you, but I am very glad that we got to share time together."
2260626,14939924,2014-06-29,17181410,Lisa,"Contacted Sharan and Preet for my last minute stay in Seattle and was thrilled by their quick response. The house is really easy to find via transit, and in a quiet neighbourhood. The bedroom and washroom were very well kept and clean. Preet was really nice and accommodating and made sure we had everything we needed. It was a wonderful stay!"
2260626,14978557,2014-06-30,13160818,Shawn And Suzey,"Our stay with Sharan and Preet was short, but very nice. They are both very warm and friendly. Private room and bathroom are neat and clean, as advertised. Having a light breakfast brought down to us was an unexpected plus! It was a very convenient location for us, and the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. We would definitely want to stay here again!"
2260626,15267372,2014-07-06,869744,JoAnne & John,"Sharan was very accommodating. We arrived late due to traffic problems, but he welcomed us and made us feel at home. The room itself was adequate. It's tucked away on the lower level with the bath next to it, so we had a lot of privacy. The location was a bit far from the city centre, but we were provided with information on close bus routes, and luckily we had our own car so it wasn't a problem. There was a bit of noise upstairs in the morning, but we had plans to be up and out early each day, so it didn't matter much. Overall, it was what is expected for the price. Seattle is an amazing city & worth the visit! "
2260626,15870794,2014-07-17,2082923,Marie,"Preet greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome. The accomodations were clean, comfortable and quiet. A library, good stores for shopping and buses were all within an easy walk.
The neighborhood is a little bit shabby and being out after dark might not be a good idea."
2260626,16063607,2014-07-21,10417646,Laura,"Sharan was auch a great host!
so friend and helpful. the room was nice and the bathroom was right next to it. we even got some breakfast in the morning which was a sweet surprise! thanks a lot!"
2260626,16258871,2014-07-24,184379,Martina,"The area was really private from the rest of the house. Everything was clean. The bedroom is a little bit small for two people with two big suitcase, but for the price it was really okay! 
The house is 30-45min by public transport away from downtown Seattle, but there are a view buses to reach easily the city. 
The two hosts was really helpful and friendly to us and the serve a simply breakfast. That was nice to have! 
"
2260626,16473434,2014-07-28,16405160,Richard,"Sharan and Preet were so kind and generous to let my friends and I stay at their bnb, we really appreciate the privacy and care they gave us. If you are looking for a place that is quiet with easy access to bus routes then look no further! The room is big enough to fit two comfortably with it's own bathroom just outside the door. If you are a loud bunch or need 5-star accommodations this may not be the place for you. It's a modest home with a respectful family that lives here so try to be respectful to them."
2260626,16990583,2014-08-05,17056436,Srividhya,It was a nice stay! This place is very well connected to Seattle downtown. The room was clean with a stocked fridge and a private bath. Both Sharan and Preet were friendly. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to stay in Seattle.
2260626,17085710,2014-08-06,7253162,Birsen,Both Sharan and his wife Preet were very patient with my last minute booking. Preet greeted me with a lovely smile and showed me to my room which was charming. I had everything I needed. The bed and bedding was comfortable. The Bathroom was clean and right next to my room in the hallway. Parking was easy and convenient. I would stay with them again...
2260626,17178502,2014-08-08,19045609,Daniel,"Neighborhood was nice and lively but on our first night there was a man screaming at the top of his voice until 2 am. It was difficult to find due to a part of the address missing from the site. However, I would recommend staying here, lovely hosts, very helpful and the room was very private. It was in a private estate and modern. Private bathroom, clean room, and a little fridge stocked with some refreshments, overall great place."
2260626,17253827,2014-08-09,2892430,Ben,The room was comfortable and exactly as listed.  Preet was very welcoming.  I made coffee in the morning which was convenient.  I would stay there again.
2260626,17308707,2014-08-10,18944374,Dejan,Sharan's home was super tidy and nicely decorated. Quiet neighborhood and easily accessible from I5 by car. Short trip (15min) to downtown by car. We haven't seen Sharan due to our late arrival and early leaving but he was super super helpful assisting us to get in. PBJ and organic juice breakfast was just what we needed. Definitely recommendable.
2260626,17624324,2014-08-15,15815150,Zerrouk,"I enjoyed my stay at Sharan's home. Everything was as described in the listing. The room was very clean, quiet, and very private. Just outside it, was the private bathroom with full tub. The room was equipped with mini fridge, coffee maker, and microwave oven."
2260626,17979568,2014-08-19,1671517,Lila Or Mike,"Sharan replied right away and kept in touch about our changing check-in times until we arrived. The room is cool and lovely, with a desk, ample clothes space, coffee and cups; the small fridge had juice and snacks. We would definitely stay here again."
2260626,18138639,2014-08-22,17556535,Barbara,"Charan and his wife Preet were wonderful hosts. I arrived late my first night at their place but Charan stayed awake to welcome me and explain the entry lock and give me the key. The room was very clean, quiet, and private. The neighborhood was very safe and pretty convenient to downtown Seattle. I went jogging around every morning and it was fine. I didn't expect a refrigerator, coffee maker, toaster and snacks but it was very nice to have . I would definitely give Charan and Preet an excellent review and hope to stay there again when traveling to Seattle."
2260626,18221609,2014-08-23,20292209,Chris,I was in Seattle on very short notice for a day trip and Sharan was so accommodating.  Very quick to respond when I had inquiries and the room was lovely and very well maintained.  As this was my first time using Airbnb I was very impressed and thanks to Sharan will be using the service again in the future
2260626,18359653,2014-08-25,6056336,Anne-Claire,"We stayed one night at Sharan's place. Very friendly host unfortunately we didn't have much time to talk. Quite close to downtown with the bus and nearby a supermarket. Bathroom is nice, bed is OK but room a little small if you want to stay long. There's fridge and microwave but no real kitchen. Recommended for a short stay."
2260626,18512520,2014-08-27,16763770,Tracy,Host was nice
2260626,18725585,2014-08-31,178394,Bob,"This is a wonderful, convenient location if you want an inexpensive small (about half the size of a motel room), self-contained room that includes a MW, coffee maker, frig and TV. The bathroom is just a couple of feet down the hall. Sharan and Preet were helpful in providing what we needed, like a reading lamp. There is a 10 PM curfew which is not stated in their listing.

What was missing was any personal interaction with the hosts. We were not allowed to use their kitchen or living room and therefore had no opportunity to chat with them. Other Airbnb and Vrbo places we stayed at (about 2 dozen) allowed us to use their kitchen and LR and we had interesting discussions with those hosts. Since we traveled to India and may do so again, it would have been nice to chat with Sharan and Preet."
2260626,18954293,2014-09-03,19523963,Katharina,Sharan and Preet are really nice people. We added a third person to the room after we made our reservation and they were totally flexible about it. The place has a great connection to downtown! The room was really private and clean. We enjoyed our stay! 
2260626,19325123,2014-09-10,19524513,Carol,Nice bed and bath.  Nice hosts.
2260626,19504184,2014-09-13,16335831,Ryan,"Great stay with Sharan and Preet.  I had a last minute trip to Seattle and they were very quick to respond to my same day request.  Room was nice, felt very private but Preet made herself available.  Great place to stay in Seattle!  Great location."
2260626,19629113,2014-09-15,20613361,Ben,"My stay was excellent. Sharan warmly welcomed me. The room was clean and quiet, perfect for my needs. I appreciated the microwave, small refrigerator, and associated kitchen utensils. Looking forward to staying again, when in the area."
2260626,20105234,2014-09-23,17971383,Chelda,"My Fiance and I were dropping my daughter at University of Washington  and needed a place to stay and foiund this air bnb. We were greeted by Preet, Sharan's wife, and she let us know everything about the room, how to come and go and what was around us. The stay was very nice. Though we were gone most of the time and didnt get a chance to meet Sharan, he communicated with us and when we needed a late check out as our airport arrival was in the evening he was able to do so. Very nice room in a nice neighborhood.  About 15 minutes from University Of Washington. "
2260626,20580953,2014-10-01,8621080,Lani,"This very private bedroom and bathroom were just right for my needs.  The hosts were prompt in replying to my questions before my arrival.  Preet met me and got me settled in quickly.  The house was easy to find and I appreciated the quiet neighborhood.
Lani"
2260626,20979064,2014-10-08,63815,Ruth,Wonderful and helpful host that had a great location for me.
2260626,21109683,2014-10-11,20700041,Audrey,"Sharan's place is great and is located in a very calm neighbourhood! It is incredible comfortable, easy access to public transport (the bus stop is right around the corner) and he and his wife are nice people. It was a really good airbnb experience."
2260626,21245294,2014-10-13,21972554,Donald,I was greeted by Sharan who sjowed me the room and made me feel welcome. The room was as described and worked well for me.
2260626,21698770,2014-10-22,9374203,Aj,"Sharan was really great about communicating, she was very quick to approve my request and later, to approve a change to my stay. Even though the room is in the split-level home, she and Preet gave me complete privacy.

The room is pretty much exactly as pictured and described. Probably most ideal for one person, or two if you don't plan to spend a lot of time just hanging out in the room, as it is a little small. The bed was comfortable, and the shower had plenty of hot water, which was basically all I needed out of life.

There are a lot of food options within walking distance of this home, so even if you don't have a car you'll never go hungry!"
2260626,26382512,2015-02-10,16831878,Monica,Host was very welcoming and flexible. The room is as pictured and the neighborhood is quiet. Very easy to get a hold of the host as well.
2260626,27083272,2015-02-24,12192247,Joe,Something happened to me and I could reach Sharan's house. They've been totally opened mind about the situation. 
2260626,27852453,2015-03-13,15090237,Weining,"Sharan & Preet are amicable, warm, and ready to say hello. At the same time, they attained the delicate balance that some guests sometimes need—to come and go as one pleases, and to conserve social energy. The place was conveniently located and clean, not far from the University District and I-5 (that goes downtown), and it had a private bathroom and a small bedroom. I will rate it as 5-stars. "
2260626,28573273,2015-03-26,28843884,Kevin,"Was flexible with check-in and check-out times and was very friendly. Space is as advertised, you get one bedroom and bathroom to yourself , and which are stocked with a few amenities. The surrounding neighborhood is nice with stores, restaurants, and bus stops close by. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience. "
2260626,28756952,2015-03-29,29821063,Andy,We were only there for a quick overnight but the experience was perfect. As it was our first time using an Air B&B we were a bit unsure on how to check in and at what times. Sharan was great and allowed us a later check in with out a problem. The room was the perfect size and a very comfortable bed. The appliances in the room where a great touch even though we didn't need them. The neighborhood was very walkable with plenty of amenities right down the street. Great experience all around. Would definitely recommend them.
2260626,33727543,2015-05-31,27423932,Roxanne,"Written by Roxanne's daughter (Daria), who was the guest at this listing:

Sharan was a gracious and accommodating host who made me feel very welcome.  He helped me bring my luggage down the few steps (I have a bad back) when I arrived, was very friendly about being available if I needed anything, and was helpful when I wanted to extend my stay.  The bed was very comfortable with a firm mattress (great if you need back support!) with a very private feeling, as the room is in its own little nook. Bathroom had lots of hot water for great showers after long days of sight-seeing, and everything was neat and clean.  The location outside of more busy areas gave it a quiet, peaceful feeling, but there were enough buslines, stores, and a good selection of places to eat within walking distance that I never felt isolated or too far from the city. So, it lived up to its billing!"
2260626,34988592,2015-06-14,32447237,Kush,Calm and quiet location and flexible and accommodating host.  Dedicated bathroom is conveniently right next to the room.  Host lives upstairs but you can go straight to the downstairs room from the main door without feeling like you are disrupting anything.  
2260626,35147374,2015-06-15,21897736,Julieand,"Clean, modern, and quiet with easy access.  Great privacy and security with a good room price for the area.  "
2260626,35503439,2015-06-19,35239504,Les,"Great place to stay!!! Perfect for one person on a business trip.  Hosts are great ...  I highly recommend.
"
2260626,35706859,2015-06-21,24342876,Brittany,"Sharan and Preet were both kind people. The room was as described. Enough space to spend a night in, but not quite enough room to roll out my yoga mat. The room had three windows which let in quite a nice breeze. The shampoo and conditioner in the shower were a nice touch. Also easy access to the I-5 and downtown. There is a 10pm curfew so to speak so keep that in mind when planning evening activities. "
2260626,35859976,2015-06-22,6875944,Greg,"This was a great place to stay for us. It was a quick trip, but Sharan was more than flexible with us. The room was clean, the bed was great and the value was excellent. We got to enjoy some special tea with Sharan and his wife and learn about where they come from. My wife and I cannot say enough nice things about them. Hopefully when they visit our town they will let us reciprocate the hospitality. "
2260626,36719993,2015-06-30,27297274,Mary,"Sharan made us feel most welcome.  He and his wife were were charming, solicitous hosts.  The bed was comfortable and the shower excellent.  The proximity to the express bus into town proved to be very convenient."
2260626,37936376,2015-07-11,29892405,Jesse,"Sharan and his wife Preet kindly allowed us to check in late as we stayed at their place on our drive from Oakland to Vancouver.  The guest room and bathroom are on the lower level of the split level home, so it almost feels like having a little motel room in a nice residential neighborhood.  Basic, just big enough for two, clean, and quiet."
2260626,38014166,2015-07-12,10133931,Maria,"Instructions are clear to get to the suite and to enter / exit the suite . The description provided is accurate. The suite is layed out in a way that gives you a sense that our are in a separate apartment . My stay was less than 24 hrs. All of my needs where addressed

The area had all necessary amenities"
2260626,38875740,2015-07-19,24710058,Ryan,Sharan was great and very accommodating! He made sure to keep me updated whenever he was doing projects around the house and the noise was going to be an issue. Highly recommend staying here.
2260626,41033855,2015-08-03,24532653,Colin,Great private room and bathroom with easy parking and a good location. Sharan is a friendly host.
2260626,42428336,2015-08-13,38494381,Logan,"Sharan and Preet were very nice and gracious hosts; they provided everything they had described in the listing, and left us a kind little note of greeting as well as a bottle of sparkling juice to commemorate our honeymoon. They offered plenty of information about the surrounding area and Seattle. The amenities were comfortable and contained all the necessities; it felt like staying in our own little apartment! They were also happy to give us our privacy. We greatly enjoyed our stay with them and would definitely recommend them to anyone visiting Seattle."
2260626,42743448,2015-08-15,8880261,Wolfgang,"Alles bestens und genau wie beschrieben. Sharan hat mir sogar einen Gutschein für kostenlose Fitnessstudiobesuche geschenkt. Sehr zu empfehlen, jederzeit wieder."
2260626,43840274,2015-08-22,30810417,Kim,"Sharan and Preet were nice hosts.  The room was next door to the bathroom and felt very private on a separate floor of their townhome.  It was quiet and comfortable with some convenient amenities, although there was a sweet odor which could be a bit bothersome to those who are sensitive to smell.  The townhome is in a good location within walking distance of several shops and restaurants and a bus line to downtown Seattle.  
"
2260626,44073375,2015-08-23,3650572,Christine,"Although I was only in Seattle for a quick overnight, I felt very welcomed on my arrival. 
Everything was clean and the bed comfortable. 
My concern was how to get a bus into Seattle and that was explained to me by Sharan
The buses to downtown are very accessible from this location.
Would I stay here again?  Yes, as it was everything needed to have a successful airbnb experience. 
"
2260626,44348216,2015-08-25,40731690,Raman,Sharan was there when we arrived and helped us with our luggage. The rooms and neighborhood were as had been described in the listing. The rooms were clean and neat too. We were happy with our comfortable and relaxing stay there.
2260626,44565772,2015-08-27,9452445,James,"We were planning to stay 8 days, but ended our stay after 2 because the room was a bit small for 2 people and there was a musty odor to which we are allergic.  Sharan said he would fix that asap.  He and Preet were extremely cooperative with the change in our plan and made our transition very easy.  They were polite, easy to work with, and understanding of our situation.  We would highly recommend them as hosts."
2260626,45343445,2015-09-01,42541891,Jose,"Sharan welcomed us in immediately and showed us the room, which was laid out very well with everything we needed.  The room and bathroom were both clean, and Sharan was very respectful of our space while we were there.   I really appreciated a message from him I got on Saturday during a big rain storm where he expressed some concerns for us and wanted us to be safe.  Not every host goes out of there way to check in on their guests.  Much obliged.

I do recommend renting a car if you plan on staying at Sharan's place for more than a few days.  It's about 15 minutes north of Downtown in average traffic.  I used Uber to get around, which was convenient but ended up costing at least as much as a rental would have.

The bed doesn't have a traditional box frame, instead using separate wood planks as support.  Some of these fell off one side so the bed gave in on that side the first night.  In the morning I lifted up the bed and saw the planks had fallen.  It took just a few seconds to move the planks back to the proper position on the bed frame to get that reinforcement under the mattress you'd expect from a box frame.  If you stay with Sharan and notice a little give in the bed, it's probably just a plank that fell down and is easily fixed.  Just an advanced tip :).

I would definitely recommend Sharan's place for anyone staying in Seattle during the weekend.

2260626,47007908,2015-09-14,30676101,Minh,Very pleasant stay. Convenient part of town. Sharan was very accommodating and made sure we were satisfied with our stay.
2260626,47133157,2015-09-15,36535653,Don,"When we arrived at Sharan's and Breet's home they both greeted us at the door and assisted us to our accommodation. Sharan explained the locks, thermostat, and home features, answered our questions concerning travel routes and left us to relax.
Though the room wasn't large, it was cozy, containing everything we needed, from closet, robes, brochures, and coffee maker, to an adjoining full bath with towels and toiletries. Parking was on-street, but convenient and spacious on a secondary street. The neighborhood was very quiet, our sleep undisturbed. When we left the next morning they saw us off at the door.
Their home is down near the northwest side of Lake Washington, a few miles from Northgate and is VERY easy to get to from I-5, or the Bothell area. A breakfast cafe is just west of their home near Northgate and the I-5 freeway. Well priced. We'll be back.
Don"
2260626,48827702,2015-09-28,17470383,Larissa,"Exactly as described. Parking was easy to find and Sharan made sure there was every amenity available!
It was perfect for the week I was in town and I would highly recommend it!"
2260626,49412610,2015-10-03,14771199,Erin,"The house was easy to find, very private downstairs with a nice bathroom just outside our bedroom door. It was clean and comfortable, quiet and perfect for our quick stop. Sharan was very gracious and made sure we were comfortable. "
2260626,50251657,2015-10-10,25375368,Kristine,"Stayed for one night with my friend and it was the perfect place. Comfortable bed, really nice and clean shower (great water pressure!), and even had a microwave/coffeemaker in the room. Very safe area. Sharan was really nice and quick to respond to any questions. Highly recommend his place!"
2260626,51410889,2015-10-19,36304562,Muriel,"This place was perfect for a quick stay in Seattle, If you don't mind driving-its about 15 minutes north of the major neighborhoods in Seattle that we wanted to visit, but we had a car, so it was no problem.  The room is very simple-the bed is ok, and overall the bathroom and room were very clean."
2260626,51516468,2015-10-20,29035652,Fra,"Stayed over night in Seattle to meet with a friend, This room was perfect for my overnight stay. Was greeted at the door by Sharan who was very helpful in answering my questions about getting around the area. I ended up using über to get around. It's own bathroom beside the room was handy. Overall great experience."
2260626,52197192,2015-10-26,27793459,Cristina,"I needed a place to stay in North Seattle for work and their place had the perfect location. We felt very welcome and Sharan kept in regular contact with us before and during. The description is accurate and it's a nice, quiet neighborhood. It is also nearby some famous local places to eat such as Dick's Burgers and the Breakfast Club. "
2260626,53070329,2015-11-04,14973682,Emily,"The hosts were very nice and welcoming.  The neighborhood was really convenient for me, very quiet and just 3 blocks from my family.  There is a wonderful coffee shop and resturants two short blocks away as well as a drug store.  I caught an express bus downtown just two blocks from this accommodation.  It was also very clean.  I will use again if my family stays in the 'hood."
2260626,54827025,2015-11-23,22535325,Lakeisha,The room was ok for the 2 days I had left looking for an apartment. It was in a nice area but 10 minutes or so away from thr freeway. The room has no television and was hard to heat up when it's 37 degrees out. I didn't stay but part of the first day and checked out the next night after returning from staying at a friends place. 
2260626,55549141,2015-12-01,48095264,Yumi,It was great~!
7217102,39090075,2015-07-20,16705528,Bruce,"Teri made us feel welcome from the start and we loved staying in her loft. She was responsive to a few questions we had early on and then allowed us to settle in and enjoy her loft. More than that, we really felt that she opened her home to us and she was so friendly and inviting.

The unit has an amazing view of Lake Union, Mt. Rainier (on a clear day) and the nearby ""Aurora Bridge"" which is sort of an engineering spectacle. Relaxing with a cool drink on the terrace was a lovely way to end a summer day. Also, having a washer/dryer in the unit was a big plus for us.

The location was awesome, being quite close to the center of Fremont. The local coffee shops are great (e.g., Milstead & Co. is a 1 minute walk and we understand it has quite a following there, plus there are a number of other independent coffee places nearby - and also a Starbucks only 1 block away if that's your preference). We had a great meal one night at the Turkish restaurant right down the block (Cafe Turko). And although Fremont has a wealth of other nearby restaurants to choose from we chose to cook for ourselves most nights."
7217102,39821942,2015-07-26,34779360,Abby,"Fremont is a super cool part of the city to stay and hang out in. Teri's loft is just down the block from Fremont Brewing Company, one of the best in the city, from a FANTASTIC Turkish restaurant, and just a few blocks from a number of other cool spots. Teri's apartment was great! Clean, cozy, bright--loved all the decor from her travels. And the views of Lake Union! Such an easy, enjoyable experience: we'd definitely stay again."
7217102,42015905,2015-08-10,20444300,L E,"Comfortable loft, in a fun neighborhood.  Great views!  We enjoyed our stay!"
7217102,43711160,2015-08-21,22308307,Kirsten,"We had such a lovely time at Teri's place! It's in a great location, walking distance to shops, cafes, restaurants and more. Found a sushi restaurant that became a favorite and fresh yummy coffee around the corner. Teri's loft is comfortable and relaxed- like a home away from home. While we didn't get a chance to meet Teri as she was off on an adventure... She was only a phone call or text message away. She was helpful and has a great sense of humor. Would definitely stay there again."
5562674,27973612,2015-03-15,23917929,Mark,"We had a great time staying at Anna's apartment. She went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable. The apartment was very clean and new including the sheets, towels, appliances, glasses, and mugs. Anna was ready to help us out any way she could. The apartment is a short walk to downtown Ballard and there is a bus stop across the street making it very easy to get around or do some exploring. I would definitely stay here again!"
5562674,28114188,2015-03-17,1626920,Sophie Jane,"We loved our stay in Anna's cosy home. It was spacious, immaculate and the bed was so comfortable (much needed for a jet-lagged traveller!).
We were welcomed by Anna, who was very helpful, and also by a lovely gift basket, which was so nice to arrive to. 
We'll definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle. "
5562674,28351051,2015-03-22,5641410,Kristi,Anna was a great host!  The rental was clean and she made sure our stay was comfortable with goodies and great recommendations for restaurants and coffee.  This is a great place to stay if you just need a place to rest and sleep. 
5562674,28503176,2015-03-24,27543342,Hannah,"The Ballard basement was a delightful place to stay. It was bright and clean and well decorated. We had everything we needed. Anna left us a welcome basket with some treats and was very helpful and accommodating. It was in a great neighborhood close to great food, drinks and shops. Anna gave us good recommendations of places to visit. My partner and I had a great experience. We will definitely stay here again on return trips to Seattle! "
5562674,28549836,2015-03-25,26086056,Laurie,Anna was a lovely host. She could not have been more helpful and made us feel at home. The bed in our two bedroom apartment was so comfortable and great water pressure.  I would be happy to stay there again
5562674,28617072,2015-03-27,28892968,Sarah,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle in Anna's Airbnb! The space was bright and comfortable, and the beds especially so! Anna was incredibly helpful and responsive and made our stay very easy!"
5562674,28683675,2015-03-28,147318,Alexander,"Anna was very welcoming, and the suite is great: quiet, comfortable, and central in Ballard. I would definitely stay here again."
5562674,28755781,2015-03-29,9419837,T,"We had a wonderful time at Anna's home. The suite is ideally situated and beautifully decorated; a bright, airy, comfortable space with some seriously cozy beds. The separate entrance and parking space guarantees a private stay, though Anna and her husband are lovely to chat with if you cross paths. Hospitable and easy going. I'd recommend this to two couples or up to four people looking for a nice landing pad for their trip. "
5562674,28917181,2015-03-31,29590276,Gerd,Anna was very nice and greeted us when we arrived.  She also followed up to check if we slept comfortably.
5562674,29136454,2015-04-04,28050137,Ryan,"Anna was a fantastic host and we found her basement suite to be as advertised. 

I travelled with my wife and 2 infants (ages 2 & 1) and we were comfortable in the space provided.  

Anna was incredibly hospitable and was very passionate about making sure we had a great stay.  We appreciated the nice little touches and accommodations she made for our family. 

She was also extremely quick to respond to any questions we may have had (as advertised) the entire time - which was very helpful.  

We would most definitely stay with Anna again on our next trip into the Seattle area. "
5562674,29225421,2015-04-05,3420752,Mary,Our visit was short and sweet! The accommodation was bright and clean and met our needs for the Night. Anna was pleasant and answered all our questions. 
5562674,29375068,2015-04-06,4324554,Yutaka,"Anna was an amazing host.  She was so friendly and unbelievably accommodating.  And the space was super clean and comfortable.

I had a fantastic stay!"
5562674,29584929,2015-04-09,13265102,Tama,"Anna and her husband were AWESOME. They were so welcoming (they left a little goodie basket upon our arrival), met us and welcomed us into their home. Their neighborhood is truly beuatiful-we had lived in seattle 9months and not until this stay did we find a neighborhood so beautiful. We walked to great coffee shops, dinner and a cute pub. The location is truly perfect."
5562674,29842011,2015-04-13,2251032,Ryan,This was a great spot for us and is super close to some amazing food and coffee options. Will definitely stay here again. 
5562674,30115997,2015-04-17,6170599,Madelyn,"Anna's place was in a great location for us, and she was very friendly and sweet. There were nice touches, like oranges, pellegrino and some beers in the fridge. There was also a space heater, which was nice since it got a little cold in the basement. We brought our dog, and there was a perfect park 2 blocks away where we could take her to romp. The bed was comfortable, it was the perfect place to crash after a long day in Seattle. Also having our own parking spot was awesome. Everything was super clean. "
5562674,30240338,2015-04-19,11674560,Livio,"Anna has been very nice and a great host. We found some fruirs and beverages when arrived and that was really nice from herself. The place is strategically located between two really cool neiborhoods, Fremont and Ballard, but at the same time in a quiet street. The bathroom was just renovated and the apt was really clean. It's a basement as stated in the website but you get a lot for what you pay. I'll definitively check back with Anna next time I'll come to Seattle! livio"
5562674,30577039,2015-04-24,20190449,Jonathan,"Great location in Ballard for walking for coffee and the many breweries in the area. Live in Seattle and was a great place while my floors were being redone in Wallingford.

The host was amazing and left snacks and made us feel welcome over the week."
5562674,31267328,2015-05-03,4881174,Kanika,Anna was very friendly and responsive--I booked her place for my family during their visit to Seattle and it was seamless.  They thought the place was great and my grandmother raved about the how comfortable the bed was :) 
5562674,31671712,2015-05-08,32197647,Yan,"Anna was a wonderful host and the apartment she provided was perfect for our needs.

Welcome chocolates and nuts as well as water and beer made us feel really welcome. She also let us use her own washing machine and dryer, which were new top-of-the-line stuff. There is no cooking grill or hobs or oven, just a microwave oven and fridge.

The basement apartment is a little rough around the edges. You'll see exposed rafters, a little bit of spider webbing there, the floor has a few pits and slightly uneven ground. You enter via the garage which has Anna's stuff. So if you are looking for a hotel-style, perfectly manicured lodging, look elsewhere. Otherwise, it was very neat and clean where it mattered. Very personal and homely touch.

The location is in the suburbs so expect 20 mins or so transit by car to the city if that is where you are headed. During rush hour traffic that might be double. Otherwise, the location is safe and convenient, gas and groceries within walking distance.

When we arrived, she explained that both bedrooms would have individual space heaters. At night, we only found one, and we called her to check on where is the other heater. Turns out she mistakenly remembered she only has one. Within the hour, she went out and came back with a brand new heater. So I have absolutely no doubt that Anna will take care of your needs and concerns promptly.

Thank you Anna!"
5562674,32001502,2015-05-12,19482814,Sarah,"We had a great stay with Anna - she's a very warm and welcoming hostess! We really loved the space (looks exactly like the photos) and location as it's about a 10-15 minute walk to lots of great restaurants in Ballard. Because the space is the basement, there is a little bit of noise in the mornings from upstairs, but we'd definitely stay there again next time we visit Seattle."
5562674,32268034,2015-05-16,8594815,Rachel,My friends and I really enjoyed our stay in Seattle in Anna's apartment. Everything was clean and comfortable and Anna was a welcoming host. We particularly enjoyed her suggestions for places to eat in her guidebook! The location was very central and gives a nice and quiet neighborhood feel while downtown Seattle and many other attractions are only a short drive away. Since the apartment is in the basement of her home there is some noise in the mornings but definitely not a deal breaker for this great find!
5562674,32468062,2015-05-18,16088775,Nadine,Awesome place. Smooth check-in / check-out. The place is tidy and as nice as described. Anna was always there if we needed any help. Quiet neighbourhood. Would definitely recommend!
5562674,33092146,2015-05-25,10276667,Justin,Anna's accommodations were wonderful. It is centrally located in the ballard neighborhood which I found to be one of the better parts of seattle. The beds were very comfortable and it had all the amenities I needed. Would highly recommend.
5562674,33826859,2015-06-01,5720527,Pia,Anna's apartment was wonderful! So centrally located and perfect for the two of us and our young daughter. Anna was so easy to get a hold of and checked in with us to make sure everything was going well. The welcome basket was such a sweet touch. We really loved our stay and will definitely be back! 
5562674,33970628,2015-06-02,30480858,Charles,"Anna and Nick have an amazing place! Everything we needed was supplied and the parking space made getting in and out super easy. The beds were great and it was a home away from home. I will definitely be staying here next time I visit Seattle. 

P.S. check out her guidebook. Slate coffee is amazing. "
5562674,34082841,2015-06-04,2374537,Nikki,"Anna was a really nice, warm and welcoming host. She had carefully thought out what we would need to make our stay comfortable. From providing a welcome gift basket to fresh towels and body wash and sharing the fruits of the family cherry tree, we felt very at home. We even used the earplugs for sound sleeping that she had on offer.

The accommodation was exactly as described and very nicely decorated.
 The beds were very comfortable and access and communication was easy.

Anna was very helpful with providing suggestions for the area and restaurants. We really enjoyed the restaurants she recommended and we loved Ballard. There was so much to do in Ballard and it is a very cute and fun area, close to everything."
5562674,34422024,2015-06-08,2457327,Amanda,"We loved our stay at Anna's place. She and her family are very kind and accommodating! We felt very welcome and enjoyed the snack basket they left for us. The rooms were very clean and the beds were super comfy. Their house is within walking distance of many great attractions. We walked to the zoo, the Ballard farmers market, and some nice restaurants. 15 minute Uber ride to pike place market and to the Link to the airport. We highly recommend this place for anyone looking to visit Seattle!"
5562674,34647854,2015-06-10,1168423,Sarah,Wonderful welcome to Seattle.. Anna was there to greet us and show us around the place. We were able to do our laundry which was such a treat after days on the road. She also had a little basket of treats :) The neighborhood is really charming. I definitely recommend staying here. 
5562674,34945351,2015-06-14,1814118,Amy,"Anna was responsive to e-mails and texts. She was there to greet us when we arrived. She even remembered Us from our first visit. Clean space, comfortable beds, tasty snacks, close to Slate Coffee."
5562674,35342568,2015-06-17,15100594,Fallon,"Anna was an incredibly warm person. She made us feel right at home after our long day driving. She showed us around, provided us with a cute welcome basket and offered any help for the duration of our stay. The place was cute and quaint. I found the photos to speak truly of the space as well. The beds were very comfy and the rooms were adorably decorated. The evening we stayed we helped ourselves to some tea that Anna provided. It was tasty and the perfect way to end our evening. Anna mentions in the description that the place has some rough edges but I found these to add to the eclectic style of the place. Definitely nothing to scoff at. Location wise, you can't find any better. A very short drive to Gas Works Park and even shorter to some delicious eats (Paseos!) Overall, lovely location, setting and host. "
5562674,35917454,2015-06-23,1761506,Doug & Savanna,Anna's place was great! Cozy and very convenient in a great neighborhood. She was a great host and catered to our needs. We were two couples with two babies and she went out of her way to make us welcome including lending us a crib. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
5562674,37051783,2015-07-04,32620320,Giulia,"The house was ok for the price.
Anna was very nice and very responsive!
The house didn't have everything you would expect (dish towels, spoons, etc.) but she provided them when we asked. 
it's a basement apartment without a finished ceiling, so although she keeps the house clean it tends to seem dusty. Also because of the unfinish ceiling noises carry from upstairs.
But it's a great location and Anna is great!"
5562674,37170214,2015-07-05,22563869,Alex,Anna was a great host and the apartment was exactly as described. I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Seattle. The Ballard neighborhood was a short walk away and fun to spend the day in. 
5562674,37558964,2015-07-08,187313,Kathy,Anna greeted us kindly with treats and info. She was very gracious and helpful. She has done so many thoughtful things to make our stay comfortable and convenient. She even bought a toaster because she knew we loved toast! Can't say enough good things about this stay.
5562674,37980211,2015-07-12,18670826,Gregory,"Anna was great. She was available and completely willing to answer questions and help out. The apt in the basement was exactly as described, and very comfortable. I would absolutely stay again when I return to Seattle"
5562674,38387710,2015-07-15,326529,Adam,"Wonderful, cute basement with the most comfortable beds and bedspreads ever! Anna was a kind and gracious host who went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The location is perfect. 15 minutes to downtown but you really don't need to leave because the Ballard neighborhood has so many wonderful places to eat and drink! We will definitely be staying here on our next trip to Seattle! "
5562674,38624800,2015-07-17,36133534,Karen,It was a great pleasure to stay at Anna's place. She's very kind and flexibele. The Appartment was perfect for a short stay in Seattle. Thanks again Anna.
5562674,39089871,2015-07-20,36450132,Zoe,"A very charming and impeccably kept suite in a cool neighbourhood! Anna was wonderful and very accommodating as our host for our short stay in Seattle.

Would definitely recommend this suite and host!"
5562674,39396130,2015-07-23,24933785,Samuel,Great location! You can walk to almost everything you would want. Anna was extremely friendly and was willing to help out any way she could.
5562674,39491669,2015-07-24,17613721,Greta,"Perfect first Air B&B experience! Anna was super friendly and the place was exactly what we expected. Check-in/out was easy and convenient, as was the location would definitely recommend and definitely book again for our next stay!"
5562674,39924413,2015-07-27,17613721,Greta,"Perfect first Air B&B experience! Anna was super friendly and the place was exactly what we expected. Check-in/out was easy and convenient, as was the location would definitely recommend and definitely book again for our next stay!"
5562674,40332898,2015-07-30,7964831,Dorothy,"Anna and her family were great hosts! The space was comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet. Anna helped with dinner recommendations and loaned us some beach towels/ blankets to take to the beach. There was a bit of construction going on, so there was some daytime noise, but we were forewarned ahead of time, so no big deal. Overall a great experience and we would certainly return! Also - beds were very cozy - a big plus!"
5562674,40445322,2015-07-31,34001594,Ansley,"Anna was a wonderful host, accomidating and quick with communication.   The house was cozy and comfortable.  We had two couples staying and had plenty of space and privacy.  The house was in a great spot, only a few steps away from a bus stop and a short walk to restaurants, coffee shops etc.  We would gladly stay again!"
5562674,40758126,2015-08-02,35881175,Trisha,We had a great stay. It was a perfect spot for our family of four. We most enjoyed walking to coffee and bakery and getting to know the neighborhood cats and the beds here are exceptionally cozy. Anna's family are early risers so if you are a light sleeper definitely make use of the ear plugs provided.
5562674,41331665,2015-08-07,31939890,Lisa,"What a great space, so cosy & inviting.
It easily accommodated both me & my sister & her husband.
Very clean & well presented with a few welcoming treats.
Anna was very accommodating & happy to help with any issue.
Close to Rapid Transit options into downtown.
Anna also gave us a great local restaurant tip that proved to be fantastic. A must - Señor Moose!
A definite recommendation, thanks for a great stay."
5562674,41946879,2015-08-10,34387982,Kelsey,"Anna was so warm, welcoming and flexible when our arrival time changed. The listing was just as pretty in person as the photos and very comfortable. Those beds! I've never slept so well while away on vacation! The location was perfect, too. Close to a lot of cute shops and restaurants, and central enough that catching an Uber was a snap! There is a private entrance that was so convenient. Anna had a few refreshments waiting for us upon arrival which was such a lovely gesture.

Anna went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable, and we so appreciated it! It was a great first trip to Seattle, thanks in large part to Anna! "
5562674,42408999,2015-08-13,36822567,Cindy,"My host was very welcoming and upfront about everything that she felt might be an issue (staying below an active family with a toddler and the noise level that comes with that).  She was very accommodating, quickly answering any questions (do you have an iron/ironing board, etc.).  Everything was very clean, the beds/pillows were totally comfortable, the white noise machines worked wonderfully. Her descriptions were accurate, check-in/out was very easy and simple. The location was excellent to come and go from.  It was my first experience with a bnb and I loved it. There was a large refrigerator, inside was a filtered water pitcher (a plus), there was a microwave, dishes, a little table and 2 chairs. I loved that it had two bedrooms, since it was my daughter and I staying there. If I get to visit the city again I will definitely try to book this one again."
5562674,43387216,2015-08-19,37835655,Robert,"Anna made us feel very welcome upon checking in!  She provided us with some snacks, and she also had toiletries and dishes stocked for use as needed which came in very handy during our stay.  Our accommodations were very clean and we had plenty of fresh linens for the bathroom.  Anna was also great about answering questions and helping us out with anything we needed while we were visiting Seattle.  The location was great, we were walking distance from downtown Ballard, which had lots of cute shops, restaurants, bars, etc.  The bus routes were also conveniently located for ease with public transportation.  Overall we had a terrific stay, and would definitely recommend this listing to anyone looking for accommodations in the Seattle area."
5562674,43493713,2015-08-20,18012515,Danielle,"We had a wonderful time at Anna's home. We loved that it's located in the Ballard neighborhood - we were able to walk to the majority of the breweries, bars and restaurants that we wanted to visit. Anna was very easy to get in touch with, she made sure we were comfortable and knew about the neighborhood. The beds were super comfy and the house was quiet. Would definitely recommend and look forward to visiting Seattle again in the future! "
5562674,43791992,2015-08-22,38038396,Katie,Anna was welcoming and kind. The apartment was clean and convenient. White noise machines were great!
5562674,45313525,2015-09-01,10322884,Mark & Liz,"Anna was a terrific host - the space was perfect for us: parents and a grown sibling visiting a Seattle college student!

The beds were comfy and each room had some space to spread out. Great location and easy parking.  Thanks Anna! "
5562674,45468850,2015-09-03,6474626,Raymond,"Anna had a great place in Ballard close to many things and greeted us when we arrived. Clean towels and sheets were provided. The basement flat had laundry machines that were being used by Anna and her family with dirty laundry on the floor which was a bummer.

We should have read all the reviews. It is a basement flat which has thin ceilings and you can hear everything from upstairs. Anna did provide ear plugs and sound machines for our convenience."
5562674,45908455,2015-09-06,8636303,Katie,"Anna's place is in an excellent location, very walkable easy access to Ballard shops and restaurants. We arrived to snacks and a fridge stocked with sparkling and still water and a nice welcome note from Anna. The place was just as pictured, a very clean basement apartment. Beds were comfortable, it was the perfect place to stay for a night in Seattle. Will definitely be re-booking in the future. "
5562674,46435224,2015-09-10,29045604,Gwenn,"The host was very friendly and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. The beds were very comfortable and the unit very clean. the location was good to walk to several restaurants and some shops but if you're not familiar with Seattle, it is not very central. Although it's mentioned in the description, I wasn't expecting the host to be doing laundry (which is in the rental unit) while I was in the apartment so that and the pile of dirty laundry was a bit of a turn off. Overall, it was a nice stay and well equipped for two guests, would also be nice for two coupes because the rooms are private. However there is no central area to hang out together except sitting at the small dining table. "
5562674,46505805,2015-09-11,30166238,Jeanne,"We only had a fleeting visit, but was lovely. Great little basement flat with incredibly comfy beds. Anna was very welcoming and gave some recommendations of  great Seattle eateries. Thanks for a short but sweet stay!"
5562674,47426226,2015-09-18,636100,Thomas,Work took me to Seattle. My host's demeanor made me wish to move to Seattle!
5562674,47720195,2015-09-21,27498319,Daisy,"Very clean, easy, comfortable place to stay. Wasn't very noisy at all, there's white noise machines incase. (I predicted heaps of noise from the summary Anna gave). Anna was very welcoming and helpful with suggestions. Good location. "
5562674,48544911,2015-09-27,4783841,Megan,Anna was a great host. Showed us how to use the laundry which was muchly need!! Also had a basket of treats for us which was beyond our expectations. The place was well heated and beds were comfy and only heard Anna's son cry once - pretty good for a 2yr old!! Anna even let me borrow her hair dryer! Anna's place is so close to everything in Ballard. Slate Coffee up the road is to die for!! Thanks for the suggestion. Would definitely come back!!
5562674,49340248,2015-10-03,41098314,Karen,"Anna made us feel very welcome and was so hospitable in every way. She supplied us with everything we needed including coffee, teas, sparkling water, chocolates which only made us all smile! Both beds were extremely comfortable and the location was perfect to wherever we wanted to go."
5562674,49530922,2015-10-04,8756408,Philip,Great place exactly as described. Parking was easy. No problems whatsoever.
5562674,49956926,2015-10-07,45682245,Kimberly,"This by far was the best experience I could have ever asked for. Being very new to Airbnb we really didn't know what to expect, this two bedroom bright basement felt like home as soon as we walked in. It was spacious enough for my husband and 3 boys. Beds were large and super comfy. Location was perfect and a hop skip and a jump from any attraction Seattle has to offer. Thank you Anna for making us feel like family, you were the perfect host!! "
5562674,50539951,2015-10-12,23574022,Kai Hong,"Became Strava friend With Anna, enough said!"
5562674,51001197,2015-10-16,36970492,Jamie,"Excellent stay! The place was very clean and comfortable. The location is great, we loved Ballard and our stay here! Highly recommend. "
5562674,51095803,2015-10-17,46514225,Nick,"We had a great experience staying at Anna's! Great location and she went out of her way to make us feel welcome. The place was very clean, welcoming and homey! Anna was super easy to reach and work with. Definitely would recommend. "
5562674,51336085,2015-10-19,45002999,Jackie,"Anna was very welcoming and friendly which made our first AirBnB experience a great one. Anna was very responsive to our texts and requests, and always asked what she could do to make our stay more comfortable - even offing a portable crib for our toddler.

The space is just as she describes and was perfect for what we needed. The beds were cozy and comfortable, great pillows, and lots of extra blankets, too. The white noise machine was so helpful in getting our daughter to relax and fall asleep as well. We hardly heard anything going on upstairs the entire stay.

It was easy to get to and centrally located for our plans (perfect for visiting the zoo). I really appreciated the small touches, like applesauce in the fridge for our 1 year old daughter, and I could tell Anna had gone through and made the space very toddler-friendly.  I would definitely stay again!"
5562674,53309321,2015-11-07,1468954,Edie & Jim,"Our accommodations were great. The description and pictures were accurate. Our beds were so comfortable. Our host was awesome and paid great attention to details that brought smiles to the end of a great day in Seattle. 
We'd recommend and stay again. "
5562674,53688892,2015-11-11,1887576,Jeramie,"Anna was very welcoming and easy to communicate with. The space is a very simple basement which suited our utilitarian purposes perfectly. the location and space were a bit noisy, however she had provided white noise machines which were great and allowed everyone to enjoy a good night sleep. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an awesome budget option in Ballard."
5562674,53757660,2015-11-12,20409876,Cassie,"Anna was an incredible hostess. Her house guide was easy to follow and her home was in a perfect location. Once we arrived Anna made us feel super welcome and at home! We even needed a hair dryer early in the morning, and she brought it down immediately. So kind! 

The location was a renovated garage, and it's one of the coolest locations ever. It had two completely separate rooms both decorated to the tee, a small common room area with a refrigerator and microwave, and a private bathroom. Anna left coffee, tea, and chocolates and honestly we couldn't have asked for a better host. We can't recommend Anna enough!! Thank you, Anna and family :)"
5562674,55004718,2015-11-27,47266308,Gwynne,"I had three friends visiting over Thanksgiving and needed a location close to my own home in Ballard for them to stay. Anna's was perfect - within walking distance to my house as well as the rest of Ballard! The space was clean and well appointed and Anna was very communicative and happy to help. My friends did note that while toddlers definitely do live above the the basement rooms, the noise was not overly disruptive. 

Great location and space, would definitely rent again when I have visitors in town!"
5562674,56171020,2015-12-09,34429752,Jesse,"Anna was awesome! So welcoming and warm, as well as knowledgeable about the area. The space was bright and comfortable and had everything we need, nothing we didn't. Just as described!"
5562674,56405786,2015-12-13,3364945,Nick & Yohko,"We had a great time staying at Anna and her husband's home! The basement apartment is plenty spacious, the beds were really comfy, and the location is great for exploring the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods. Anna was very friendly and accommodating, and was super easy to communicate with! Definitely would recommend this to any small group headed to Seattle."
1840671,15663166,2014-07-13,17939152,Akshay,Reena is the perfect host and welcomed us with open arms. Her house is in a beautiful location and well connected to Seattle downtown by public transport. We spent an amazing evening and took a gorgeous moonlit walk along the coast at night and were almost reluctant to leave the next morning. Thanks Reena for a really great time in Seattle.
1840671,15731533,2014-07-14,1385159,Beth,"Reena is an absolutely amazing and most welcoming host! She made us feel at home immediately - and was even kind enough to accommodate our later than expected arrival after midnight. Upon arriving I was greeted with a warm smile and a hug from Reena. 

The room is very large, nice and private for two people. It is located in the basement of the home, so stays quite dark if you like to sleep in, but also has plenty of pretty and well-placed lighting to brighten up the space when you need. There is a bathroom downstairs, as well. It isn't attached to the room, but is right outside and a short walk to the bathroom. 

The home is in a beautiful neighborhood and is a short walk from Discovery Park and a bluff overlooking the Puget Sound with stunning views of the water, across to Bainbridge Island, mountains in the distance, etc. The views from that park are unrivaled. 

But overall the very best part of our stay with the interactions with Reena. Though they were brief, as we were only there one night, she is an amazing person, full of positive energy and love. We had such fun looking at all of the treasures in her garden in the front yard. I would definitely come back again for a stay in Seattle. And this is a very reasonable price for the location and space. Thank you Reena!"
1840671,16224666,2014-07-23,17732692,Mitchel,Was located in a very nice neighborhood and was a very nice room. Reena was very welcoming and made sure we had everything we needed throughout the whole trip.
1840671,16947377,2014-08-04,18689684,Joe,"We had a wonderful experience staying at Reena's.  My 4 year old son and I had a 5 night stay in Seattle and Reena helped make it an awesome stay.  The room itself was clean and comfortable, and it was a little cool the first night but Reena provided a nice thick quilt that made the rest of the nights even better.  Reena truly made our first AirBnB experience a great one.  She helped us figure out how to get around the town and even provided a bus pass that we just had to reimburse for the rides we took.  The bus stop is only a block or two away to get to downtown, so even though I had a car I tried the bus a couple times and it was kind of fun.  Discovery park is also very close by and was lots of fun for my son.  I honestly have nothing but good things to say about our visit to Seattle and Reena was a great host!"
1840671,17598153,2014-08-14,19656904,Nick,"Reena was a wonderful host.  The room was as advertised - a nice simple room in the basement of her house which offered lots of additional private space in the rest of the basement with a private bathroom.  Reena was welcoming, warm, and entertaining!  I most enjoyed our walks through the neighborhood.  Reena brought me on a few 3-5 mile walks through Discovery Park and along Magnolia Blvd.   I would stay with her again next time I'm in town!"
1840671,18752240,2014-08-31,3392521,Brandon,"Everything people have said about Reena is true. She is a delight.

However, this basement room she rents left a lot to be desired for the price. First of all, the basement is an unfinished space. What the pictures don't show you is that the ceiling beams/insulation/electrical wires are completely exposed. This meant that each morning we were awoken by any footsteps or movement upstairs. The downstairs ""living room"" she references in the listing is actually just another bed. When we asked if anyone would be staying there, she replied: ""Not as of yet, but who knows two hours from now."" Which meant that we could have potentially been walking through another person's sleeping quarters every time we came, went, or used the bathroom. I should also mention that the areas weren't dirty, per se, but the bathroom had (water?) stained linoleum and there were several spider webs throughout. Again, this basement room is an unfinished space."
1840671,39710765,2015-07-25,39169024,Jenn,"Reena was great! Very warm and welcoming, and interesting conversation, and she even made us a great breakfast! The place was clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood was beautiful, with large houses and nice landscaping, and right next to a Discovery Park with trails etc. It's about a 30 minute bus ride to downtown."
1840671,40689557,2015-08-01,39510370,Jose,Reena's place was located in a lovely area. Short walk to the park with a wonderful view and a minutes drive to the downtown Seattle area. She was very friendly and made us feel at home. 
1840671,43338759,2015-08-18,6532138,Ashley,"reena is a lovely and welcoming person.  the space was comfortable and private since the basement is isolated from the rest of the house.  the neighborhood is very quiet and nice, just a few minutes walk to discovery park."
1840671,43711500,2015-08-21,753272,Shayne,"Reena was amazing!! See welcomed us with open arms and had a very special energy about her that had you feel at home. I highly recommend staying with her.
"
1840671,46034973,2015-09-07,42305938,Karen,"Reena was very welcoming and accommodating of our arrival and departure schedules.  Her home is in a lovely, quiet neighborhood, close to the park which overlooks the sound and near where our daughter lives.  Lovely.
While the bedroom we used is in the basement, it is very comfortable and we slept well there (in spite of the unfinished ceiling in the room).  Quiet.  The bathroom was a convenient to the bedroom.  The finished basement through which one walks to get to the bedroom is beautiful. We were pleased to have a strong cell signal in the room.  And, her garden tomatoes were a delicious taste of summer.
Our only regret is that Reena was feeling less than well during our stay.  Would like to visit again under better circumstances.  "
6676926,37238148,2015-07-05,16106505,Truong,Such an awesome place and the hosts are the best! We had such a wonderful time staying here and we hope we can come back soon! They were very accommodating and friendly! Thank you to you both!! We love you guys!
6676926,37605834,2015-07-08,985653,Autumn,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Seattle at the Ravenna Hideaway! The space is clean, unique, and very comfortable. We had everything we needed and more! Lacy and Kyle were thoughtful and welcoming. We will definitely be back!"
6676926,38529847,2015-07-16,36085237,Sherry,"Ravenna Hideway is the perfect place to unpack your bags and experience Seattle.  Kyle and Lacy were great hosts, knowledgeable about the neighborhood and interested in our outings.  The home is within walking distance of fast food, fine dining and great shopping.  With transportation this location is minutes away from the zoo, the Mariners, Seattle Center and the University.  Our family could not have been happier with this new Hideaway."
6676926,39198926,2015-07-21,36739795,Tove,"Lacy og Kyle gav os en dejlig velkomst ved at tage sig god tid til at vise os lejligheden og til at give os de første praktiske info omkring parkering, hvor der var supermarker osv. Under opholdet var de nemme at komme i kontakt med og de var altid venlige, imødekommende og hjælpsomme. Et par fantasktiske gæstfrie værter.
Beskrivelsen af boligen levede fuldstændig op til vores forventninger. Boligen er super fint indrettet og der er virkelig tænkt over de små detaljer med bl.a. paraplyer, indkøbsnet og førstehjælpskasse til rådighed :-)
Området er et villakvarter hvor fra det er nemt med bil at komme ind til centrum af Seattle. Til trods for tæt trafik i morgen og aftentimerne var vi aldrig generet af støj."
6676926,39798727,2015-07-26,36745541,Kyle,"We really enjoyed staying at the Ravenna Hideaway for our recent trip to Seattle. Kyle and Lacy were really friendly and helpful with advice on getting around the city and finding nearby shopping and parks when we arrived. We were welcomed with a tour of the apartment, a bar of local craft chocolate, and a handbook to the apartment and neighborhood as thorough as any you would find at a hotel, and probably more helpful.

The location was quite convenient for us - the neighborhood gave us easy access by car to hiking in the Cascades (we recommend Wallace Falls), while the nearby bus (only 1/2 block away) was a quick and direct trip to the heart of downtown. There was also a number of good restaurants within walking distance.  

The apartment itself is spacious, clean, and comfortable, well decorated and well stocked. When you stay here you will truly feel like you are at a home-away-from-home, much more so than any hotel. The bed is soft and comfortable, the kitchen contains everything you need to cook or prepare any meal (just add food!) and despite the lack of air conditioning the apartment stays nice and cool. It was a pleasure to stay here, and we would heartily recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle."
6676926,40347861,2015-07-30,2611598,Anthony,"We loved staying in Lacy & Kyle's beautiful Ravenna apartment. They gave us plenty of privacy but we're totally accessible if we had questions and were there to welcome us when we arrived later than expected, due to a delayed flight. The neighborhood was charming and we enjoyed exploring and going for runs in Ravenna Park. The apartment had lots of great touches and everything we needed to feel comfortable and at home! "
6676926,41284079,2015-08-05,40053788,Kay,"
We were personally greeted by Kyle and Lacy and they made us feel very welcome! Their home is charming and very comfortable; it had everything we needed and the backyard was a delightful respite after a long day at the hospital. We appreciated their warm hospitality and look forward to staying with them again soon. Thank you Kyle and Lacy!"
6676926,42591324,2015-08-14,12896158,Navin,"This was by far the nicest AirBNB we've stayed in to date.  The place was meticulously clean, bright (despite being underground) with a beautiful design aesthetic.  Lacy and Kyle went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable, and even offered to host our bags after checkout so we didn't have to lug them around town.  The house is a convenient walk to a nice commercial strip on 65th (including one of Bon Appetit's 50 best new restaurants - Salare).  Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Seattle."
6676926,43065213,2015-08-17,31302003,Yi,The place is awesome. The hosts are very nice. The thing I like most is the room decorations. It makes you like staying at a  lovely home. Also the place is very convenient to both UW and downtown Seattle.
6676926,43941421,2015-08-23,15741773,Brian,Simply the BEST airb'n'b EVER!  Amazing attention to details and every possible amenity is available. Kyle and Lacey have created the most wonderful space and make you feel incredibly welcomed and cared for. Well done-We will be back!
6676926,44317942,2015-08-25,37486682,John,"Phenomenal hosts, great space, couldn't ask for more. The roku with Netflix is a great touch."
6676926,45619191,2015-09-04,31754647,Jessica,"We had a lovely stay at Ravenna Hideaway.  Beautiful apartment, perfectly stocked with everything you need and more. Lacy was very thoughtful and gave us a small gift to thank us for accommodating  a quick visit by a repairman during out stay.  Would absolutely stay here again."
6676926,45955606,2015-09-07,13157176,James,From the initial message the stay was great. The place was very clean and tidy. The hosts were very welcoming. Highly recommended! 
6676926,46344728,2015-09-09,1525299,Diana,"We were totally pleased with the Ravenna Hideaway.  Everything about the place was lovely AND comfortable.  The Hideaway is well appointed, well stocked, light, and in a great location - easy to get to Seattle points of interest.  It is spotless clean and spacious. The hosts were warm and gracious and available. We had everything we needed and more.  I will definitely stay here again the next time we need lodging in Seattle."
6676926,46498648,2015-09-11,2762776,Jessica,"Fabulous place to stay! Lacy and Kyle's apartment is beautiful. The decor is lovely and it is very clean and well organized. It's also in an ideal location - close to UW, UVillage, and Greenlake. "
6676926,46907825,2015-09-14,40551398,Valerie,"Lacy and Kyle communicated wonderfully with us in advance, so that checking in was super easy.  The property is lovely, and we were very much in a home away from home.  I'd highly recommend it!  It will work well if you are courteous about the noise level at night because their home is right above this one. "
6676926,47161236,2015-09-16,38741448,Sarah,"This is a beautiful place! Lacy and Kyle have put together all the perfect touches to make this a home away from home. Spacious, nicely designed, good location, lots of amenities, private laundry, and the list goes on. If we are ever back in Seattle we will definitely stay here again."
6676926,47657854,2015-09-21,27476576,Kristy,"Kyle and Lacy's place is so charming, I want to live there full time! The rental space is very generous (almost the entire footprint of the home above)  and the decor is impeccable - so warm and inviting. Every room is incredibly clean and well decorated, making the space truly feel like home. Kyle was very kind to explain everything to us in person (from the wifi, to the door lock, to the recycling, to the street parking).  Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer!  A wonderful experience, would return in a heartbeat. "
6676926,47984841,2015-09-22,40548044,Heather,"If you are looking to stay somewhere close enough to see the sights of Seattle during the day but want a quiet, relaxing place to escape at the end of the day, this is a wonderful choice! This charming little apartment is very well maintained and looks like brand new. Not only do they have all the comforts of home (a well-stocked kitchen, a Roku to watch Netflix/Hulu, plenty of books for perusing), but the neighborhood was such a fun place for us to explore on foot. There are quite a few restaurants in the area, all within walking distance. Our area favorites were the pastries at Sod House Bakery and the nearby park with an awesome walking trail and a sand pit for our toddler to explore. The hosts were very friendly and welcoming, providing everything we could need (including an air pump for the wheels on our jogging stroller--thanks!). The backyard is a delight and even had a little garden/pumpkin patch, which our son just loved. Our only regret is that we had already booked another place to stay for the remainder of our week so we couldn't stay here longer! "
6676926,48426261,2015-09-26,30346595,Betsy,Our stay at the Ravenna Hideaway was wonderful! The apartment was beautiful with all the amenities we could have wanted.  The space was immaculate and decorated so tastefully.  My daughter wanted to live there!  It's quiet and safe and very comfortable.  Lacy and Kyle are lovely people and we felt welcome in their home.  Highest recommendation.
6676926,48727832,2015-09-28,30848108,Chris,"Our stay at the Ravenna Hideaway was outstanding.  This place is very clean, beautifully decorated, and loaded with amenities.  Kyle and Lacy were the perfect hosts.  The location was ideal for us, very close to UW, restaurants and shopping.  I give this place my highest recommendation.  We didn't want to leave!    "
6676926,49042801,2015-09-30,33360350,상완(Steve),"Simply F.A.B.U.L.O.U.S! Anything you need or anything you imagine, it is there. Lacy and Kyle are superb hosts!
The house is not only cleam, but also well-organized and well-equipped. Transporation to downtown is convenient.

Thumbs up!
Definitely would stay again.  "
6676926,49492775,2015-10-04,43469839,Peng,"The cozy apartment running by Lacy and Kyle is very pretty. With fully equiped furnitures and useful stuffs. Although the room is partly underground,It is bright, clean and warm. Lacy left all nessecary information and guidance in room and always response timely to help us with any questions during our stay.  The location is good , which is very easy to access to food and shoppings. Within half hour's bus trip to downtown. The only pity is the parking area for guest on both sides of the street has strict limitation during rush hours, you have to be very careful to read the parking notice on the street before parking, and  remove the car during rush hours, while it is always nervous to a traveller who is the first time being here. Fortunitely the very nice friend of Lacy allow me to leave the car besides the apartment  , she find other place on the street to park her car.  There's a cute  teddy dog in the yard , always quiet and polite to guests "
6676926,49817084,2015-10-06,7198397,Shannon,"Lacy was very helpful and quick to answer all my questions. The apartment was a perfect set up for my 3 elderly travel companions. Everything appeared brand new, which was a real treat.  The apartment was quiet, cozy and everything arranged to he easy for guests. I will definitely stay here again when the opportunity arises. "
6676926,50684356,2015-10-13,35435236,Shelley,"Ravenna Hideaway is perfect!  It is very cozy and it has everything we needed for 3-day visit to Seattle.  It has a clean, artsy decor, and just the right amount of personal touches.  The hosts put together a good selection of area info for the visitors and they are all very helpful.  The kitchen is well stocked to prepare simple meals.  All the linens are very clean and comfortable.

Revanna Hideaway is close to University Village and that is a really nice place to shop, dine, and walk around.  In addition there is a nice supermarket in University Village too.

The hosts are very good with communications.  Even though they were out of town during our visit, they made arrangement with friends to ensure that our check in process was as smooth as it can be.

Ravenna Hideaway is our first experience with airbnb and all in all it is a great experience."
6676926,51435726,2015-10-20,39762384,Katy,"The Ravenna Hideaway was really wonderful. There is quite a bit of space and no detail is overlooked. We have two young children (3 and 15 months) and were so grateful for all of the space and the ability to have a kitchen, washer/dryer (with laundry soap!), etc. The neighborhood for us was perfect. Lots of great things within walking distance and easy access to other Seattle neighborhoods. We will definitely stay here again if we are back in Seattle! "
6676926,51908147,2015-10-25,15127650,Ruth,"Everything was quiet, calm, and well-appointed, and Lacy and Kyle were quite gracious and welcoming. Ravenna is a great neighborhood to walk in and a good base for exploring Seattle."
6676926,52274839,2015-10-27,36398108,Stella,"I stayed here for a weekend to spend some time with my son who in attending UW. The location is perfect as the bus stop is only 2 minutes away and also you can easily walk to campus and University Village which is a big, upscale shopping center. Convenient! Not only this apartment is brand new but also it is impeccably decorated. Lacy and Kyle have thought of everything guests might possibly need during their stay. They even brought us a welcome gift! I have never been this comfortable when I was away from home. Thank you so much, Lacy and Kyle!"
6676926,53080712,2015-11-04,1696134,Devendra,"It was one of the finest AirBNB place we stayed. Very spacious, clean & designed keeping full comfort of guest. "
6676926,53241978,2015-11-07,14510253,Amy,"Lacy and Kyle's Ravenna Hideaway was cute, comfortable, conveniently located—everything it appears to be in the photos/description but better. I think Lacy's profile says she has an eye for lovely things. Well, you can certainly see that's true once you step inside. Great details throughout, VERY clean, thoughtful to travelers' needs, and even featured a local treat (chocolate!). Loved the heated bathroom floor, and the bed was extremely cozy. Highly recommended."
6676926,54217720,2015-11-16,34185,Jennifer,"What a lovely place!  The apartment was beautiful down to every little detail.  They aren't kidding when they say ""brand new"".  Lacy and Kyle accommodated my crazy 2am arrival time and 4am departure.  I was traveling for work so my time in Seattle was very limited.  But I felt very comfortable and well rested because of the RH.  I'll be returning for sure.  "
6676926,54472307,2015-11-20,48500895,Anna,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Ravenna Hideway.  A perfect location for our appointments at Children's. Kyle and Lacy were great hosts, always available when we had questions. I loved the way the apartment was decorated and wished I had more time to enjoy all the reading material!"
6676926,55438328,2015-12-01,47473335,Karis,"Ravenna Hideaway was exactly as described-- brand new and beautifully curated, down to every last detail. Lacy and Kyle were welcoming and lovely hosts. The Theo chocolate bar left for us was a great personal touch."
6676926,55948383,2015-12-07,7628593,Kimberly,Lacy and Kyle's Ravenna Hideaway is super cute and cozy yet spacious!  It was a treat to meet such friendly hosts.  And they provided many details that go above and beyond to make you feel at home.  The best part of the experience?  The heated bathroom floors... mmmmmm.... sooo nice.  Thank you Lacy and Kyle!
6676926,56278436,2015-12-11,7586439,Christine,"Lovely space.  Kind hosts.  Great welcome chocolate bar and coffee for the morning!  Maybe a little chilly as most basements are in Seattle, but warms up quickly with heaters. "
6741135,42398156,2015-08-13,14249076,Dileep,"We had an awesome family stay in Jeanne's beautiful home.  The photos are exactly what you see.  We woke to amazing views and enjoyed the house's proximity to Seward Park (great jogging option), Columbia City and downtown.  We covered a lot of ground in Seattle - one of our favorite cities - and each day relaxed in Jeanne's house.   Our vacation was special because we stayed in this house - not a Hilton or a Marriott - but a well lived and loved home."
6741135,43384478,2015-08-19,20885114,Hugo,"actually I reserved this house for my friends who lived there for 5 days and gave very high appraisal. They said they love everything   related, cat, lake, huge balcony, clean room. and it's a lot of fun to cook fresh seafood in BBQ. 

My friends asked me to highly recommend Jeanne's house and thanks for the good memory."
3769336,18272331,2014-08-24,18348268,Amy,"Beautiful cottage and lovely hosts. The cottage has everything you could need including full kitchen, private bathroom, washer and dryer, wifi, air conditioner and private access. Is close to bus transportation into town and close to local restaurants and Safeway.  Loved our stay at this cottage!"
3769336,18496013,2014-08-27,19107088,Patty,"Dale and Laura were very welcoming and friendly, while they also respected our privacy. Their cottage is very comfortable and cute, with large windows and a skylight for extra brightness. We also enjoyed the woodsy feel of their backyard. The location was perfect for us! We enjoyed walking to breakfast, coffee, and the arboretum. Restaurants are also close and walkable. It was nice to be in a neighborhood and to get a sense of the community while staying there. We would definitely return! Thanks Dale and Laura!"
3769336,18747067,2014-08-31,5980670,Maria Del Mar,"Ficamos no chalé construído no fundo do quintal. É totalmente independente da casa. Entramos seguindo as orientações dos anfitriões sem problemas. O chalé tem as comodidades de um pequeno apartamento. Limpo, arrumado. É bem iluminado por uma clarabóia e amplas janelas, cujas cortinas são apenas as árvores em volta. Então, prepare-se para acordar cedo! Para usar o WIFI procure o roteador na janela! Só vimos no dia seguinte.
É um bairro residencial, bom para estar de carro e com GPS. "
3769336,19151447,2014-09-07,10231470,Myriam,"This is a beautiful and cosy place, exactly like in the pictures. We felt very much comfortable and enjoyed our stay in this cottage. The only inconvenience was the lack of curtains/shutters which makes you wake up early in the morning :) But apart from that, it is an amazing place! "
3769336,19547203,2014-09-14,20481661,Magali,"Dale & Laura were great hosts ! 
Their place was very nice, clean and comfortable. We had all the things we needed - the bathroom was great and the washing machine and dryer were really helpful. We really felt like home :).
Dale provided us with very good advices to plan our different road trips to the United States and there was a lot of brochures inside the cottage that helped us not missing anything in Seattle and its surroundings.
Going to downtown from the cottage is really easy because 2 bus routes are passing nearby.
If we go back to Seattle, that's definitely the place we will try to stay !
Thanks for everything !"
3769336,19955212,2014-09-21,411539,Maria,"We really enjoyed staying at Dale and Laura's cottage. It had everything we needed, and the kitchen had enough cookware and basics such as salt/pepper/oil that we were able to make any meals that we wanted. 

The neighborhood is on a quieter side, but within walking distance to grocery stores and some restaurants. We took a bus into town and back every day.  Be warned that the hills around there are INSANE. We managed without a car, but it does take some work. "
3769336,21962935,2014-10-27,21750727,Dean,"Everything about staying at the ""Cozy Garden Cottage"" was wonderful.  For us, it was very close to whom we were visiting in Seattle.  Dale and Laura were wonderful hosts and the cottage was like a treehouse...nothing but greenery seen from every window.  The cottage was remarkably well-furnished and clean.  The privacy was incredible and it was simply a serene environment and a wonderful place to stay.  Thanks so much, Dale and Laura!"
3769336,22406287,2014-11-05,5487932,Russell,"Dale & Laura's Cozy Cottage was the perfect asset to our stay in Seattle. Clean, spacious, welcoming, and most of all.. Cozy! Located in a beautiful, quite, peaceful neighborhood just steps from plenty of entertainment and dining - which Dale had several great suggestions that we followed and appreciated.

Upon arrival, we found it to be incredibly accommodating and thoughtful that they had taken the time to reprogram the thermostat in anticipation of the chillier weather. The cottage was set up with anything we might need during our stay. The kitchenette is complete with cooking utensils which will come in handy if you find yourself at one of Seattle's many farmer's markets.

We can't imagine our next trip to Seattle without staying in the Cozy Cottage again.

Thanks Dale & Laura!  "
3769336,23005433,2014-11-20,21029260,Mary,"I absolutely loved this place! It was like stumbling upon a zen retreat. Being so near the upper canopy of so many beautiful trees was like having a secret hideout in the woods. Being from the Midwest I enjoyed listening to many different bird calls and watching them soar above the skylight as I lay in bed.
It was in a nice neighborhood where I felt safe to walk home at night. It was close to museums & excellent restaurants. Access via the back gate was indispensable & private.
My soul really needed these 12 days of blissful solitude. "
3769336,24136581,2014-12-21,5108864,Brian,We stayed for a week at Dale & Laura's place. This cottage was completely self contained and met all of our needs for our stay. A nice neighborhood and for half our stay we didn't have a vehicle - either walking or hopping onto a bus worked well as most of our time was spent in Capitol Hill and downtown. 
3769336,24292726,2014-12-24,20233493,Audra,The reservation was canceled 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3769336,24548760,2014-12-30,24108457,Chris,The cottage at Dale and Laura's place was the perfect home base for exploring Seattle. A nice retreat from the urban environment but centrally located and close to anything we needed. The neighborhood felt extremely safe. The cottage is exactly how it is pictured. Would recommend their place to anyone. Very friendly hosts as well. Thanks Dale and Laura!
3769336,25038850,2015-01-05,2451531,Amber,"Laura and Dale were great. They stayed in communication with us until we reached the cottage and sent us plenty of information to help us find our way. 

The cottage is exactly as pictured as well as immaculately kept and stocked. It was great to wake up to a happy sunlit room everyday. The alley entrance is super convenient. Though the cottage is directly behind the house, we never interacted with anyone in the house other than through email or text. It felt like our own little private home.  

As far as location, we couldn't have asked for anything better. We felt comfortable walking to and from Capital Hill where a lot of restaurants and bars are. There are also frequent buses that allowed us to easily travel downtown or connect to additional buses to go into Fremont/Ballard.

Should we return to Seattle the garden cottage would be our first choice."
3769336,25304227,2015-01-11,19733481,Thea,The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

On a walk one morning we noticed a lot of beautiful homes with distinct Seattle architecture. The cottage was well equipped, and I only regret that I didn't stay longer to read more books, and make some more coffee."
3769336,26549826,2015-02-15,5344727,Andrew,"Staying at Dale & Laura's cottage was great! They were good with communication and made it very easy to gain access for our stay. The cottage itself felt like a studio apartment, had everything you would need, and was very well kept. Location was great, and in a nice neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying here and would do so again in the future."
3769336,26754915,2015-02-18,26497492,Hana,Dale and Laura were excellent hosts.  The cottage was exactly as described and easy to find.  The added bonus of coffee and water were nice touches.  The keyless entry was extremely convenient to  allow coming and going.  Great spot and will book again!
3769336,27592509,2015-03-08,22017317,Jenelle,"I had the pleasure of staying at Dale & Laura's cottage on two different occasions, recently.    The cottage is exactly as described.  Having the feel of a calm, country cottage, it's the most private city-space I've rented from Airbnb.   It felt instantly like home and was a much needed sanctuary. 

The keyless lock/entry system and in-suite wash/dryer were welcome additions. 

I didn't have the opportunity to meet Laura  but had a few occasions to interact with Dale.  He was kind and generous and helpful.  He also brought his canine companion, Tasha over or a visit when I expressed interest. 

You couldn't rent from better people or in a better spot.   "
3769336,29040808,2015-04-03,12161590,Diane,"Dale and Laura were excellent hosts. They addressed any concerns I had immediately.  The cottage was exactly as pictured.   It was the perfect place for me to spend most of the month of March. The bed was comfortable. The cottage was bright and pleasant.  I loved having the washer and dryer right in the cottage.  I also used the kitchen fairly regularly and it was stocked with everything I needed. The shower had strong pressure, which for me was a must! I would definitely recommend the Cozy Garden Cottage if you plan to stay in the Seattle area for any length of time. "
3769336,29506259,2015-04-08,28740971,Sean,"This listing is spot on for what we found when we arrived. The cottage is stand alone on a secluded property in a very quiet neighborhood. We were comfortable right from the moment of our arrival. Communication with our hosts was clear, concise and made our arrival smooth.  Our visit to Seattle was only 3 days and wished we could have stayed longer as the cottage is equipped for a long term stay. Washer, dryer, stove, frig, micro, all worked fine. There is even a coffee grinder with a French press to start out your mornings with a decent cup of coffee! 

The cottage is bright, cheerful and surrounded by beautiful gardens. A well stocked bookcase with a tasteful décor add to your comfort. Draw a card from the bowl of Angel cards to guide your day. If you are lucky you will receive a greeting by Tasha the French bulldog. We only had a chance meeting with our hosts as they respect your privacy, but always felt welcome to engage if necessary. 

Overall we had a very positive experience and would not hesitate to stay again if we find the opportunity to visit Seattle. 
"
3769336,29762043,2015-04-12,26109902,Josephine,"Our stay at the cottage was wonderful. The location was extremely convenient, easy parking, and cute neighborhood. The cottage itself was very cozy, clean, and accommodated every need. The space was very private and serene. We met Dale for a few minutes while preparing to leave (sorry we were a few minutes late getting out the door), and he was a cordial, kind, and polite host. I appreciated that the cottage had everything we needed for our stay, with helpful (and funny) notes located throughout. "
3769336,30457271,2015-04-22,8992991,Christopher,Fantastic little cabin in a quiet neighborhood with easy bus access to Capitol Hill. Loved walking around and exploring. You get your own entry and I felt like I had a lot of privacy. Everything was very well laid out with tons of helpful notes around. Appreciate it! 
3769336,30927575,2015-04-29,21102825,Gail,"The listing description was spot on! Laura & Dale were so welcoming.  They placed easy to read signs in the large garden directing me to their cottage & made sure I had complete directions to get inside upon my arrival. 

The cottage is bright, cheery & very comfy. I enjoyed the singing birds & lush greenery all around.  They have a small patio outside the downstairs bedroom perfect for an afternoon break, (they have a small library of books & games also available at the ready), a little breakfast, lunch or as I preferred a cup of tea. A rocking chair made a nice addition to the patio!  Maps & Seattle booklets were also out & really helpful.

Their dogs were friendly and not bothersome at all, although I didn't come across them until my 3rd day. Their pets names were in the welcome material & in the cottage. I didn't see the cat.

I met Laura on day 2 & we had a nice visit in the garden. She recommended the botanical garden about 1/4 mile walk with lots of food spots nearby. She let me know ahead that they'd have a small group hanging about one evening & apologized for any extra noise.  Since I had other events all weekend, it wasn't an issue.

I liked having a coat rack near the front door. Light switches were easy to find as were the Wifi directions. Kitchen was stocked with the essential tools & cookware. There was extra bottled water in the fridge & teabags available.

The bathroom had extra towels handy & easy to understand directions for the washer/dryer combo. I appreciated having a hair dryer. 

The bedroom was large with two chairs & a handy table too. The closet space was ample.  Extra bedding & blankets were upstairs in an easy to reach spot. The bed was a bit creaky on one side but didn't hamper my slumber. 
The floors are wood & have the usual creaky settling sounds in a few places. It made for a warm, lived-in feel.
I would have liked a nightlight upstairs & downstairs so my cell phone flashlight wasn't needed & room lights could stay off.

Overall, I found the place to be not only quiet, but charming & a little retreat-retreat-like. I can't wait to stay again!

Warmest thanks Laura & Dale!

Every morning we woke up to birds singing and all of the green around us was just wonderful. In case you are a runner: the Washington State Arboretum is very close - it's amazingly beautiful! I can also recommend you take a stroll through the neighborhood at some point. Amazing houses! the supermarket and bus stop are also very close. If I/we ever come to Seattle sgain (which I hope I will), I would definetly stay with Dale and Laura again :). Thanks again! Ramona "

Highly recommended."

3769336,35970839,2015-06-23,32993921,Sarah,"We stayed at Dale & Laura's cottage while visiting Seattle.  Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Dale & Laura in person, they were in touch by text as needed.  The directions to the unit were easy to follow and there was ample street parking.  The unit itself was very private, quiet, and clean.  The cottage had a well-equipped kitchen, a full bath, and a nice sleeping area on the lower level.  Even had a little outdoor seating area off the bedroom. It felt like our own private oasis in the woods.  

The central location made it a great home base for exploring the city.  Took about 15 minutes to drive to tourist spots like Pike Place Market and Seattle Center.  

We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend Dale & Laura as hosts."
3769336,36222391,2015-06-26,16912599,Robert,"Checking into the house was easy peasy.  Code key was very functional and I was surprised to find the cottage to be a large as it was.  From the pictures I had though it much smaller.  It fact, It is two stories and a patio.  Dale and Laura communicated well and made my hectic business trip easier.  Good ventilation from opening windows with screens is always a good thing.  A very well equipped kitchen and a washed dryer.  Though the wifi is a bit of a challenge (because of the hilly location)…I am told that it will be upgraded soon."

The upstairs living area was bright and airy, and the whole place had a tucked away secret garden feel. It was a great, quiet place to stay with a lot of character, and an easy 45 minute walk to the city for those who like to explore places on foot!"

Es ist ein paar Meter vom Haus des Vermieters entfernt und hat einen eigenen Zugang. Es war als ob wir ein Häuschen für uns alleine hätten. Von dort waren wir mit dem Auto schnell in Downtown Seattle. Uns hat es super gefallen. Wir können das Cottage uneingeschränkt weiter empfehlen. "
3769336,40712540,2015-08-02,13542668,Ken,"Great place! Lots of space, it has everything you could ask for, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, it's also clean and spacious. If you have a car it's a really great spot, but it is a short bus rodent $10uber to pretty much anywhere in the city. Highly recommended place for sure! But beware the Internet wifi is T-Mobile 4g with a poor signal, it's terribly slow, but it does work..."
3769336,41621230,2015-08-08,14567004,Sarah,"I had such a wonderful time in Seattle and got to stay at the most wonderful place. Dale and Laura were fantastic and I got to actually see them a few times during my stay. The location is absolutely perfect. There is a Trader Joes and Co-Op within 5 minutes and I was able to buy some great food throughout my 4 day stay. Downtown and the waterfront are about a 15 minute car ride. The cottage was larger than I expected and is tucked away in beautiful landscape and trees. Even bamboo! I felt secure and safe, as Dale and Laura had provided secure access. Thank you!!!! "
3769336,42556508,2015-08-14,1829015,Andrea,"Best place ever!  It's super cute and feels like you are living in an urban wilderness.  There is a separate entrance, so it feels very private.  The pictures don't reflect how large the space is, but it is 2 floors and was very cool in the summer time weather. The wifi is a little weird, but it's very relaxing so it's a good place to be unconnected anyway. "
3769336,43212944,2015-08-18,26578196,Maddie,"Had a great time at Dale and Laura's. The place was spacious, light, comfortable, and private. It is close to restaurants and a small business district, and there is easy access to transit to get around. I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others!"
3769336,43806138,2015-08-22,38872768,Mary Beth,The perfect get away in a Japanese style cottage garden setting. Very private and inspiring. The dogs were a great welcoming committee the first morning. Our very late hour arrival was easily handled due to their lack of key needed for entry!  We would stay there again in a heart beat. 
3769336,44297090,2015-08-25,13855085,Jane,"This cottage was great. It was located towards the back of a large and wooded property. We had a lot of privacy and were surrounded by lovely trees. The cottage itself was very comfortable and really big! It would be great for a family or friends that don't mind sharing a bedroom. The bedroom was downstairs and felt a little dark at first, but that turned out to be great for sleeping. The upstairs has the kitchen, living room, and bathroom. It was light and bright and well-stocked. I thought it would be annoying to have the bathroom on a different floor from the bedroom, but it was easy to find lights in the middle of the night so it wasn't a problem. The hosts placed lots of helpful post-its notes throughout the cottage so we didn't have to ask a single question. Overall, a great place to stay in Seattle. "
3769336,48864749,2015-09-29,14511401,Jim,"Great location and accomodations. Although we did not meet our Hosts they made our stay very comfortable and were readily available to answer questions prior to our visit. 
The accomodations were superb, very comfortable, easily accessible, well furnished and equipt. It is the perfect private cotage. This will be our first choice when we return to Seatle. "
3769336,49810663,2015-10-06,43689583,Christine,It was our first time using Airbnb and Dale and Laura made the experience of checking in as easy as possible.  We loved their cozy little cottage.  It was very inviting and quiet.  The location was great.  Dale and Laura thought of everything from a big bottle of water in the fridge to coffee to little post-it notes with how-to instructions everywhere.  We would definitely stay here again in the future.
3769336,50768925,2015-10-14,41475494,Linda,"We had a great time at Dale and Laura's cozy cottage.  The accommodations were super clean (very important to us) and very well equipped.  The location was perfect for visiting all the hot spots in Seattle.  The bed was Soooo comfortable.  Although we didn't have occasion to really chat with our hosts, they were available and responded by txt or email when we had questions.  We would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend this very private, cozy cottage"
3769336,51453263,2015-10-20,6074338,Chanstay,"This was such a lovely place. Roomier than I expected, with 2 floors and 2 outdoor spaces. The place was clean and well equipped. The decor was sweet and this cottage was very homey. I loved my stay and so did my teen-age daughter. I will absolutely stay here again and recommend anyone visiting the area looking for a private space to check this place out!"
3769336,52241317,2015-10-27,12561,Diane,"The cottage was so cute, and such a great space for my husband and I when visiting our adult kids who live in Seattle. I especially loved the cheery yellow upstairs living area. 

Dale was really great and always available if we needed anything.  

The only downside for us was the lack of high speed internet. The 4G Hotspot was adequate for email checking and some web searching, however my husband was working remotely while in Seattle, so that made it a bit difficult for him. I know Dale is working on that, so hopefully it won't be an issue much longer. We knew that might be an issue going in, so it wasn't a surprise. 

We really had a lovely stay and hope to stay again!"
3769336,53677396,2015-11-11,16989967,Al,This was a wonderful stay in a perfect getaway cottage.
3769336,56662761,2015-12-16,45959885,Rebecca,Felt welcome. Listing was accurate. Cottage was clean and warm. Parking is easy and location is close to bus lines. 
6545602,48268563,2015-09-25,23707914,Michael,"I had a great time here. Timo was the greatest host, I felt so welcomed being embraced by a fellow Ohioan. I met a lot of great people from all over the world who had a lot of great ideas. If I were a time traveler, I would go back in time to when I booked this house and congratulate myself. There are usually between 3-5 people in here, so it felt like being back in college with a lot of cool people. "
1956274,10467848,2014-02-20,11591978,Hanley,"Vera was a gracious and wonderfully splendid host and the apartment was absolutely superb. It had everything we wanted and then some. Plenty of room, lots of electrical outlets, wifi (so that I could conduct my business with folks back home), large refrigerator, washer/drier, king-size bed, 1-1/2 baths, on-site parking (a real bonus in Ballard where on-street parking is hard to find), large-screen TV, very comfortable and tasteful furniture. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone visiting the Seattle area.  A real gem."
1956274,10574461,2014-02-25,11944541,Alexandra,"Vera was a fantastic host from start to finish. Vera greeted me upon my arrival and gave me the grand tour of the space. Super comfortable, and super convenient to the heart of Ballard. The king-size bed was super plush, making it hard to want to wake up. I seriously could have spent my entire vacation sleeping because it was so comfortable. There were 2 bathrooms, one full, and one half. The full bath was stocked with very plush towels, eco-friendly hair products, and a very powerful blow-dryer. Vera had so many sweet and personal touches throughout the apartment, including treats from Dahlia Bakery, some fresh fruit, and coffee. The apartment had all of the conveniences of a hotel, with the charm and comfort of home. I loved how the kitchen was fully stocked with cooking equipment, as there's a QFC market down the street. Vera was also super gracious with her time, making herself available to answer local questions, and to help with the logistics of check-out. I highly recommend this listing to anyone visiting the Ballard area. "
1956274,11811658,2014-04-15,2493722,Tom & Hannah,"Vera's place is great and she's such a nice lady. I intend to stay next time I'm in Seattle. Also, great location in Ballard, where there is loads of quality restaurants. "
1956274,12175133,2014-04-25,2093084,Jamie,"Vera was a great host and the apartment was very spacious and set up to be very comfortable with nice little personal touches.  The location itself is great, walking distance of the QFC, restaurants, stores and, of course, the Ballard Locks.  Had a wonderful time staying here."
1956274,12291101,2014-04-28,3170305,Effie,"Lovely place in Ballard. Totally fit the image of small but stylish town. Walkable distance to everything. I love a restaurant called toast, just few blocks away from Vera's place. What's more, Vera is truly a people person. She is so mega nice. 

It was my 2nd time leisure visiting Seattle.  I went travel with my friend for celebrating my birthday. We took Amtrak for an unique experience. But somehow there is a huge delay due to the electric problem on train. And there were almost three hours later when we arrived in Ballard. She stayed awake for us though she gotta wake up early on the next day. She was patient and even order us a house tour. Besides, her welcome snack basket was really a great good addition to my birthday trip. We appreciated that a lot!

All in all, Vera's place counts a nice spot to check out. It is part of Ballard culture. We highly recommend to people ready to visit Seattle. Transportation is quite convenient out there BTW."
1956274,12784411,2014-05-11,1673320,Anthony,"My wife and I recently visited our daughter and family in Seattle for a week. We decided to try AirBnB for the first time.  Lucky us, we choose to stay in Ballard at Vera's wonderful apartment.  She met us on-time as promised and walked us through her beautiful unit. She took the time to make us feel very welcome.  Vera, is very outgoing and friendly.  The property far exceeded our expectation. Vera has thought of everything!  The apartment was spotless clean.  She even stocked up a few items to get us going (eggs, milk, coffee, water melon, oranges, apples, fresh coffee cake (yummy), gray salt chocolates, Greek yogurt...ect. We arrived in Seattle after an 18 day cruise and need to do some laundry. Vera's apartment included an in unit washer and dryer!  The apartment is in a very safe and well kept neighborhood.  Outstanding location with off street private parking (big deal in Ballard).  The bed is king size and very comfortable. You can also walk to restaurants and coffee shops Overall outstanding five stars (we will be back). "
1956274,13473575,2014-05-28,13796066,Linda,"We had a wonderful stay at Sweet Ballard. The apartment was very nicely appointed with attention to every detail with everything we needed and more! The apartment décor was so cute and some of the features we really appreciated were an off street parking space, 1.5 baths, microwave, washer & dryer, comfy bed and soft linens, a fridge stocked with coffee, eggs and milk and a lovely fruit basket with chocolates! How ""Sweet"". We could not have asked for a more welcoming Hostess. Thank you Vera!"
1956274,15448348,2014-07-09,13817399,Sally,"This was our first airbnb visit and it didn't disappoint. The most important things to us when we stay away are: a comfortable and clean bed, great shower and a great location. At Vera's place in her little neighborhood in Ballard we enjoyed all of that and more. Vera made us feel welcomed right from the start. Her apartment is cozy and spacious at the same time. The walkability to bus lines and the downtown area of Ballard, The Locks, and other tourist attractions made for a fun vacation. We only rented a car at the end of the trip to ride out to Rainier. (You can hop a bus to 3rd Ave Enterprise Rental and get one!) Also, at the start of out trip we landed at SeaTac and Light-Railed it and bused over. This was a great vacation spot. Thanks, Vera."
1956274,16299510,2014-07-25,16221760,Lynn,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The apt. was clean, bright, and very comfortable. We could not have stayed anywhere more comfortable. And Vera was a delightful host. Although we never needed to contact her for anything, we knew she was always available.  I highly recommend this place."
1956274,16545929,2014-07-29,14698691,Kellie,"Awesome location and exactly, if not better than pictured.  Little touches make this place your home away from home.  Vera could not be more helpful, and totally respects your privacy. Highly recommend, We will visit again."
1956274,17069508,2014-08-06,18714183,Cynthiah,"The Ballard neighborhood in Seattle is like a small town in a big city. Everyone, especially our host, Vera, was so helpful and friendly. With Vera's listing we got way more than we expected. Not only was she helpful above and beyond what we were promised, she came to our rescue more than once! I can't recommend this impeccable sweet spacious home any higher!"
1956274,17500751,2014-08-13,10909068,Rita,"Our experience was totally positive.  Vera is a wonderful host and the apartment was perfect for us.  Convenient to all areas of Ballard, and especially to our daughter, who lives nearby.  We certainly hope Vera's apartment will be available when we return to Seattle in a few months!"
1956274,17786262,2014-08-17,7681928,Maie,"After having numerous Airbnb experiences on three continents I rate Vera's Ballard Apartment as one of the best.  Vera is a warm and generous person whose attention to detail and comfort is evident in her basement apartment.  She was attentive but not intrusive and we especially appreciated her promptly fixing our tv problem.  The beautiful fresh flowers and generous basket of breakfast/snack goodies were special touches.  Vera's airy, light and spotlessly clean apartment is tastefully furnished with a comfortable bed, small but powerful shower, washer/dryer and fully furnished kitchen.  Light sleepers will be in heaven when the  blinds are closed as it is eerily quiet - perfect sleeping conditions.  Ballard has many good restaurants and bars and Vera's is in walking distance to several.  An added plus is the bike/running trail, botanical gardens and Chittenden Locks which are only a couple of blocks away.  We enjoyed our stay at Vera's and recommend her place without hesitation.   "
1956274,18877550,2014-09-02,16604740,Imogen,"Sweet Ballard was a wonderful ""home from home"" whilst visiting our son. Vera was a tremendous host- so welcoming and helpful, but also she respected our privacy. She provided us with a welcome basket with lots of goodies and filled the fridge with food for breakfast. The apartment is beatifully furnished and well equipped. The bed is very comfortable and the bathroom spotlessly clean with plenty of soft fluffy towels provided. The kitchen is well equipped for cooking a meal and even has a dishwasher. The location is on a quiet residential street, within easy walking distance of the centre of Ballard ( lots of dining options, great Sunday farmers market and you can catch buses downtown) and the famous locks ( watch the boating, the salmon leaping up the fish ladder, listen to the band at weekends)- also close to Ray's fish restaurant and Golden gardens beach. It was our first AirBnB experience- and one which will be hard to beat!"
1956274,19279654,2014-09-09,19734397,Casey,We really enjoyed our stay at the Ballard apartment! Vera was incredibly welcoming and made sure we were comfortable. She was more than willing to answer any questions we had about the neighborhood. It was easy to get to various Seattle sites via the bus. The apartment was perfect and was exactly as described. It was an awesome first experience with airbnb! Would recommended this apartment to anyone traveling to the Seattle area! 
1956274,21520010,2014-10-19,1467869,Brian,"Love love love this place, Vera was an amazing host.  Highly recommended.  Thank you Vera!"
1956274,23112582,2014-11-23,13571919,Irene,"Vera was a wonderful hostess and her apartment was perfect. Very clean, cozy and comfortable. Even better than I expected. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
1956274,23425908,2014-12-01,9074455,Jon,"Vera was a great host! I had rented her apartment for my parents while they were visiting over the thanksgiving break, and it could not have been a better experience. Vera's place had plenty of space for my parents to stretch out their legs, but it was still nice and cozy during the freak snow dusting we got over the holiday weekend. Vera was always super responsive via email or text whenever we had any questions.

If you are looking for a great Ballard/Sunset Hill location near the Locks, I can't recommend Vera's apartment highly enough!
"
1956274,24409830,2014-12-28,22548710,Kirby,"We had a wonderful stay at the Sweet Ballard Apartment.  The apartment is large and accommodating. It was spotless and well stocked with amenities.  Vera was a wonderful host.  She attends to every detail in the preparation of the apartment. And she left us a really remarkable welcome basket with snacks and fruit, as well as refreshments in the refrigerator.   Vera was also respectfully attentive. She made sure we had everything we needed for our stay.  And she is just a genuinely nice person, which made our stay all the more comfortable.  
     The apartment has a bedroom and master bath on one side and a living space, kitchen and half bath on the other.  It was very well-suited for our needs allowing for activity and/or sleep as desired. It is conveniently located near many interesting attractions and only a few blocks from downtown Ballard restaurants and shops. We couldn't have been more pleased. This will be our first pick for places to stay when visiting Ballard."
1956274,26371996,2015-02-10,26853804,Joanne,"Sweet Ballard was a fantastic experience. From the designated parking space to the incredibly comfortable king-sized bed, only fabulous describes our visit. Vera is a responsible, generous host who stocked the fridge with fruit, yogurt, milk and fresh juice. When we returned from having been drenched by Seattle rain, it was a joy to put our pants in the dryer!! The couch was a cozy place to read, and the extra half-bath was a bonus. The only thing missing was a pug! Vera responded almost immediately to questions we emailed. We loved the keyless entry. I appreciated how clean the apartment was and how much thought and energy went toward making sure we had everything needed to wash clothes, store leftovers, cook, be warm, be cool, relax. We will definitely stay here when we return to Ballard. "
1956274,26705180,2015-02-17,10909068,Rita,My brother was so pleased with his stay at your lovely apartment.  It was his first Airbnb experience and he said that he and his wife will surely use it again in their travels.
1956274,27225625,2015-02-28,24868329,Angela,"Vera was the most welcoming and caring person I have met so far in my travels. She was extremely attentive to my needs and even left a welcome goodies basket for me when I arrived. She made sure I got in okay, had everything I needed, and was just the most pleasant woman. 
Vera's place was exactly what I wanted. It was spacious and full of amenities. I met with Vera the day after I landed and she showed me where everything was located, which made for a very convenient stay. The place was stocked with different-sized pots/pans, dishes, utensils, coffee pot AND filters, paper products, etc. She also told me what neighborhood restaurants were good and the best time of day to go (to avoid long lines). 
After learning that I was considering moving to Seattle, Vera went out of her way to answer neighborhood/city questions, alert me to the housing availability/changes, etc. 
I think the wildly popular success  of airbnb is based primarily on hostesses like Vera. Without her, the home would have been very nice, but the stay was made fabulous by her attention to details, willingness to go the extra mile, and overall sweetness. "
1956274,28678100,2015-03-28,14247651,Bibi,"We absolutely loved staying here!  The apartment really is sweet, and the neighborhood is really nice.  Quiet, but very close to a bus stop that takes you to pretty much everything.  Vera was a wonderful host -- she was great to talk to, and she had a bunch of goodies waiting for us when we arrived, which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The place itself was perfect.  This was our first airbnb experience, and we can only hope that others will live up to this one.  "
1956274,29253748,2015-04-06,10909068,Rita,"It was a pleasure to stay at Vera's apartment.  Very comfortable, clean and so nicely decorated.  We will surely want to return."
1956274,29944077,2015-04-14,11936774,Roger,"Our stay at Vera's was wonderful! The first impression on walking in the door was very ""home-like"" and comfortable. The place was clean and had all the accommodations that our home has like kitchen ware, technologies, laundry services and more. 

Vera had out favorite fruits and snacks available to us, it's like she knew us. Great place! 

We took half of our meals in our temporary home and enjoyed the NW foods fresh from the Ballard Farmers Market and Pikes Market. We walked all over Ballard, lots to do and see. We used public transportation that was readily available. Walking along the water front was an every morning event, beautiful! I called and asked Vera a couple of questions and she answered immediately and I managed to lock myself out and Vera was right there! Very kind and fun host. We have gladly pledged to give up our usual stay downtown at the hotel and have a new ( temporary) home at Vera's! The bed was amazingly comfortable. "
1956274,31638684,2015-05-08,3143151,Shani,"We had a fantastic stay at Vera's place. Check in was smooth, thanks to her detailed instructions. The apartment was beautiful, clean and welcoming. She even left a goodies for breakfast and snacks - amazing! Vera was a good communicator and always responded promptly to any enquiries. The location in Ballard could not be better, quiet, convenient to lots of restaurants and transport yet just removed from the busy main road for a peaceful night. Thanks!"
1956274,32327885,2015-05-17,28712507,Sam,"Excellent place to stay.  Walkable location, very clean. The space is well organized and everything amenity we could have wanted was readily available.  Also, the space has a dedicated and very accessible parking space which is very important for the area.

Vera was very responsive to questions during our stay."
1956274,33268458,2015-05-26,284455,Chandra,"We really enjoyed our stay and would definitely stay here again; the apartment is lovely, clean and quite well-appointed.  The pictures don't do it justice.  And there are two bathrooms, which was a nice bonus.  The location was very convenient to everything we wanted to do downtown Seattle and points North. The only improvement I could have wished for is a thermostat so that we could control the temperature in the apartment ourselves (having lived in Arizona for the past 2 years we are no longer acclimated to the Pacific North West temps!) but Vera was great about cranking up the heat when we asked and she also provided a space heater which helped keep us cozy. Vera is a terrific host and she was very responsive to our needs.  And the gourmet treats she provided were above and beyond our expectations; I have stayed at many airbnb locations and this was definitely one of the nicest experiences I've had."
1956274,33946675,2015-06-02,31626108,Hawson,"First of all, Vera is a very kind and helpful host! She provides not only the apartment with perfect condition, but also much more help than I expected. She always asked me about what I need, made a list of nearby sceneries and facilities for me as a tourist, and even reminded me to park at a right place. =)

The apartment itself is also great! Rooms are super clean, as well as the washrooms. Coaches and the bed is pretty comfortable. Network and TV worked good too. And you can find basically any ware and supplies there if you wanna cook something.

Also, the location is wonderful, right besides a beautiful park(a lock) where you can spend your nightfall at, surrounding by several good bars and cafes. The Ballard community is quiet and peaceful. To me, it is definitely the first choice of place to stay if I visit Seattle again in the future."
1956274,36941779,2015-07-03,28106555,David,"My wife and I stayed here for a full month at the beginning of the summer.  Vera met us when we arrived and showed us around, described the neighborhood, and gave us suggestions as to where to eat.  Vera had stocked the kitchen with a variety of foods so we didn't have to rush right out to grocery store.  Her selection was excellent and we enjoyed everything she bought.  The apartment is very nice and spacious (especially for Seattle), well decorated and had benefits you don't often find in the area.  The bed is king size and was very comfortable.  I especially liked having the extra half bathroom, as this enabled my wife and I to get ready simultaneously and not fight over bathroom space or timing.  As an early riser, I was able to be in the kitchen, living room and extra bathroom and let her sleep without disruption.  The kitchen was well equipped and had everything you would need for cooking any meals.  The apartment was also equipped with a flat screen TV, full HD cable TV service, a DVR, internet, and a clothes washer and dryer.  The apartment comes with a dedicated parking space, which is a huge benefit in Ballard, as most people have to park on the street.  If we needed anything, we could send a message to Vera and would get an almost instant reply from her.  Vera was very diligent about making sure we had what we needed and were happy with the apartment.  In the middle of our stay, she had her cleaning lady come in and do a thorough cleaning.  It was easy to walk into the village where there are a large number of eating places.  The Ballard Locks are a very short walk, and it was fun to go over and watch the boats go through the locks.  Overall, I would highly recommend this apartment.  You have everything needed for a comfortable stay and a host who cares about the quality, her patrons' comfort, and is responsive to their needs.  "
1956274,37485090,2015-07-07,1530496,Maybelle,"Vera was an excellent host, and accommodated some of our special needs. Communication, check-in, and check-out were easy. The place is exactly as advertised with some nice perks like a washer/dryer, fresh fruit and snacks, and parking in front. It's in walking distance to the Ballard Locks and salmon stairs. It's also a little further walk or short drive to the bustling part of Ballard where there are a bunch of cool boutiques, restaurants, and hip bars. We felt really safe in the neighborhood and enjoyed spending a lot of time around it."
1956274,39543618,2015-07-24,8879132,Jackson,This was a really comfortable and nice place! Vera was prepared and available and left a nice little spread of coffee and light breakfast options. I loved this place and would definitely stay here again. 
1956274,39929000,2015-07-27,33312138,Anita,"We had an excellent stay while visiting our son and grandson in Ballard.  We arrived a bit early and Vera was there to greet us.  The apartment is very clean and cozy.  Comfortable king size bed and loved the convenience of bath and 1/2.  Quiet, residential location, just a few blocks to the locks and to downtown."
1956274,40645496,2015-08-01,11471577,Rachel,"Vera offers nothing more than perfection.  She is the ultimate AirBnB hostess providing many goodies, a beautifully presented apartment that was incredibly clean and tidy and her personal touch was beyond compare.

Communication could not have been faster with instant response to any questions we raised.

The apartment is in a lovely residential neighbourhood that is not far from the city but wonderfully peaceful.  Restaurants galore are within easy walking distance, just wish we could have stayed longer to try them out.  

The bed is really comfortable and a restful nights sleep was very easy to come by.  The kitchen provided everything needed to cook breakfast, lunch or dinner, as well any baked items, though Vera left so many goodies we didn't need to do much of this!

Cannot recommend Vera's place more highly and we can't wait to return."
1956274,41055242,2015-08-04,24423873,Debby,"This Sweet Ballard Apartment is great! More than enough room, very clean and cheery, comfortable and quiet. Within walking distance to all fun shops in quaint Ballard. Vera is on top of it for arrivals and departures so that happens without a hitch . A highly coveted parking space is provided right at your front door. A welcome basket is at the ready on the kitchen counter!

1956274,42383142,2015-08-13,2966633,Brian & Alison,Vera made us feel very welcome in her lovely B&B.  It was everything we were expecting and we would love to return again if ever in Seattle.  The neighbourhood is attractive and safe and there are great shops and cafe's within 15 minutes walk.  A stroll down to the locks and shoreline are well worth doing. A ride with Uber will have you in the central city within 15 minutes (traffic depending) for a cost of about $15. We loved returning to the tranquillity of Sweet Ballard after time in the city.

Came with delicious snacks, including coffee and milk, and delicious small breakfast items. It was a lovely, private, relaxing experience for our vacation. Obviously well cared for and very (VERY) clean. Washer and dry was an added bonus as we were in mid-vacation, as well as an additional 1/2 bath. Lovely kitchen. Cozy feeling, but not in the small sense! "
