1790020,21499818,2014-10-18,14006592,Isa,"Had a good stay at Calen's apartment. On the evening there was another guest, there was ample escape routes for my inner introvert  (deck couch, private room). And on the evenings there wasn't, I had the view of the city all to myself. The fridge was stocked with a surprising diversity of beer. Centrally located near Broadway, the beating heart of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. So plenty of good coffee in reach."
1790020,21648389,2014-10-20,2488223,JoAntonio,"We arrived late and left early. However, were able to enjoy the conveniently located apartment. Furthermore, Calen was able to seamlessly accommodate us last minute, which ended up working perfect for our roadtrip. "
1790020,21817543,2014-10-24,14891717,Megan,"Calen was Johnny on the spot for welcoming us and showing me where everything was. His place is all it is cracked up to be location, location, location!! Straight shot to the waterfront, great walking around neighborhood and gorgeous view of the Olympic Mountains with breakfast. My husband and I were only there one night and wish it could have been longer!! We will definitely be back to Calen's!"
1790020,21920630,2014-10-26,11529280,Hannah,"After reading glowing reviews, was actually not that happy with my stay at Calen's apartment. Calen was friendly and my room was clean enough. The bathroom wasn't super fresh and I wish there had been a floor mat that wasn't already soaking and covered with dog hair. Didn't think it was worth $100/night.  But MOST IMPORTANTLY, Calen gave my room key to the other couple staying in the apartment for the weekend by accident and when we couldn't open the locked door because he had given them his only key (all my stuff was inside) he made NO effort to retrieve the key or rectify the situation. He only sent them a text asking when they would be back. Hours later I asked if he had gotten they key or heard from the other Airbnb guests, and he said they had texted ""oops"" and that he ""assumed they [would] be back later tonight."" So there I was alone in Seattle, all of my things locked in a strange apartment, and I wasn't even sure I would be able to sleep in the bed I had rented for the weekend. Not impressed. Luckily the other guests left my room key for me before they went out for dinner. "
1790020,22268509,2014-11-02,11614174,Chris,"Calen was awesome! He was very informative, answered all my questions promptly, and the place was clean and organized when we arrived. He gave us clear instructions regarding parking and the check-in process. I would definitely book with Calen again!"
1790020,22391481,2014-11-04,4564827,Eric,"Awesome location, comfortable apartment, and very easy to communicate with Calen.  I recommend. "
1790020,22449898,2014-11-06,22920704,Aaron,"This is best place for the best value that you will find in Capital Hill Seattle. Hands down. It is in a central location, just a short walk to the Capital Hill scene. It's equipped for a quick stay, or a longer stay. It has an awesome deck with a view of the city skyline. The bedrooms are comfortable. The TV projector with Netflix is great. The place is thoughtfully arranged and equipped to make guests comfortable and efficient. "
1790020,22474465,2014-11-07,13976001,Stef,"I was in late and out early, but the place was clean and well-located.  Calen was kind and easy to get in touch with.  "
1790020,22516738,2014-11-08,22098800,Julián,"Calen's deck is located in a quiet, pleasant neighborhood, 15 mins to the Seattle night life by walking (rests and clubs). Although we didn't get to meet, it was really easy to follow his instructions and access to the apto. Thank you Calen! Travelers'd better keep in mind that the bathroom is shared."
1790020,22994863,2014-11-19,23584739,Joshua,Calen was a great host and was very helpful at helping me get my bearings of Seattle at large; as well as the Capitol Hill neighborhood. His place was exactly as described—very centrally located and with fast wifi.  
1790020,23084773,2014-11-22,22349150,Andrew,Very responsive to messages and left clear instructions/pictures of the building including how to get in.  The room was clean and bed comfortable.
1790020,23375135,2014-11-30,21292713,Patricia,"Initially I was delighted with my choice of accomodations due to the four block proximity to my daughter. The bed was great, all seemed good, and the view was terrific. But life went downhill fast. thanksgiving night we returned to find the bathroom toilet was nonfunctional. After a large meal I found it necessary for a flushing toilet and we had to go out at 11:30 pm. But, hey, it was a holiday so I let it pass as things that happen. The next day though we returned to find it was still non functioning. I calmed Tim down and we decided to stay and just walked to my daughters that night. The third day we returned to an apartment that not only STILL did not have a functioning toilet, but now the heater was no functioning in the bedroom and it was 18 degrees outside, no electrical plugs worked in the bedroom(s) or bathroom, and Calen did not text me back until Sunday about where the electrical panel was. Too late. I have medical equipment that needed electricity so I slept on the couch because we found one in the living room that worked and I could plug to. There were not enough blankets and the German girl from the next bedroom came out, freezing, and slept sitting beside me. We left the bathroom door open Sunday to get enough light to shower and packed up. My partner, Tim, was furious and haranged me for the whole fifteen hour drive back home Sunday about the fact that he feels we should be reimbursed for the last two days. I had held him back from calling the city about sanitation laws when the toilet never got fixed!  It was disappointing as I love the location. Calen needs a property manager to attend to items of that sort!"
1790020,23517718,2014-12-02,23584739,Joshua,Had another comfortable stay on Capitol Hill at Calen's place. Coming in from Chicago for business this was an easy place to walk to everything on the hill. 
1790020,23665435,2014-12-07,9036480,Dan,"Super convenient location, clean room, great communication from the host. Highly recommended."
1790020,23851162,2014-12-12,12393648,Brian,"Calen has a very nice apartment located in an easily accessible part of Capitol Hill. Everything about the apartment was as advertised and I didn't have any trouble finding it or following Calen's instructions for how to get in. The bed is comfortable and there is a space heater in the bedroom so you can adjust the temperature to your comfort level. I didn't actually have a chance to meet Calen in person, but he was very responsive and helpful in providing information about his place."
1790020,24156055,2014-12-21,24118837,Megan,Calen communicated everything clearly in regard to the reservation and throughout the stay.  The room was clean and only walking distance from downtown.  I enjoyed my stay and would definitely return to Calen's Capitol Hill home. 
1790020,24397484,2014-12-27,18011523,Marc,"Clean, simple, straightforward experience. Calen's communications made for a smooth transition in and out. Great neighborhood, lovely views. My first choice Seattle spot."
1790020,24488162,2014-12-29,23157093,Tatiana,"Calen and his Capitol Hill apartment were awesome.  This place couldn't have been more walkable to everything I wanted to do in Seattle.  Calen was extremely helpful via txt message, he was kind and welcoming, and the instructions about the apartment were very clear.  I am definitely renting Calen's place on my next Seattle trip!"
1790020,24670372,2015-01-01,877885,Robert,"It is as advertised with a great 4th floor patio view.  The bedroom as roomy and there are local transportation and travel guides provided.  Soaps and hair products are made available.  Heating throughout seems to be by only portable mini electric heaters.  Therefore, when, for example, the bathroom door is closed that room can get quite chilly because there are only heaters in bedrooms and the living room.  Overall, the place is clean, reasonably tidy, roomy, and very well located."
1790020,24979559,2015-01-04,22082076,Anna,"We thoroughly enjoyed our Seattle experience at Calen's. This quaint apartment is not only close to awesome restaurants and bars, it is also just a short walk to downtown. Also, Calen offers several gracious amenities, including mini shampoos, and access to relevant literature to occupy cozy downtime. 2 thumbs up. This one gets the game ball."
1790020,25244368,2015-01-10,25046494,Janice,"The apartment was easy to locate, the directions were clear with photos. Calen provided prompt responses to questions throughout our trip. It was a wonderful experience to stay here. We were not only seeing the hotspots for tourists, but we were also able to explore Capitol Hill like a local. Easy access to nearby (3-4 blocks) bars, restaurants, pizza joints, super markets. Neighborhood was very pretty. Nice houses and nice people also.

The apartment was very laid back and chill. We were able to wake up warm, cook our own food, enjoy a great view, and just sit back and watch Netflix after a long day. Transportation to the rest of the city was spectacular and easy. It was a pleasure to meet and chat with Calen when he came by to clean up. "
1790020,25304004,2015-01-11,9438052,Raymond,"Two thumbs up. Calen is quick to respond and very organized. He had the room ready for my arrival and instructions in my inbox immediately. The house is very clean and comfortable. Calen had even left me a couple of bottles of water, which was a nice personal touch, especially if you've arrived thirsty from traveling.  The apartment couldn't be in a better location, just a few minute's walk from Capital Hill shopping, dining and nightlife. I'll definitely book the next time I'm in Seattle."
1790020,25519546,2015-01-18,25668697,Hannah,"Calen was an exceptional host, though we never met, he was very responsive to text messages and air bnb messages whenever we needed a question answered. He was very flexible and easy going by allowing us to sleep in a little over the check out time and was generous and gracious. "
1790020,25588269,2015-01-19,15340216,Cassie,Calen was great and in constant communication. It was my first airbnb and I would recommend it. No complaints!
1790020,25731429,2015-01-24,5873482,Travis,"Calen was a great host. Flexible with check in and check out times. The location is incredible, with great views from the apartment and lots of cools things to do nearby. I liked the neighborhood and was a better experience than when I stayed at a hostel in downtown Seattle. The room was clean and spacious. I liked that he had a desk where I could work when I needed to."
1790020,25783204,2015-01-25,20935421,Megan,"Really great place, even better in person. Bed was comfortable, heating blanket and small heater in the room (not that it needed it). The apartment is on a somewhat busy street, but the bedroom was quiet. Parking was the only downside, but I can't argue with the location: within a 10 minute walk to about everything you would want to do. Calen was super quick to respond, even though I booked last minute. "
1790020,25819017,2015-01-26,26180788,John,"Calen is a terrific host with a really great space. I had unusually warm January weather and having coffee on the balcony with a view of downtown and the Cascade Mountains was terrific. I walked everywhere and getting downtown was a snap. Thanks, Calen."
1790020,26122673,2015-02-03,19932779,Holly,"We had an excellent stay at Calen's place, it is well recommended. Calen provides plenty information about the local area, the room and apartment is great and is located in a fun area. Would definitely recommend this place to others. "
1790020,26345047,2015-02-09,3509541,Rebecca,Staying at Calen's was incredibly easy and convenient. His apartment is in a phenomenal location to explore the city! And Calen is very knowledgeable about the neighbourhood and happy to provide suggestions! The apartment itself is clean and comfortable. 
1790020,26547916,2015-02-15,2177209,Elisa,"We had a great stay at Calen's. The room is small but cozy. The bed was very comfortable. The bathroom was clean. The living room has a projector that was fun to use during down time. The location is great! Close to everything we needed: pharmacy, supermarket, coffee shops, restaurants, and public transportation. I downloaded Lyft and got 10 free rides of $20 (try using ELISA233843 to see if you can get the same) and that was very helpful. We never met Calen but he was always very helpful and easy to contact. I wouldn't mind staying there again. Thanks Calen. "
1790020,26668507,2015-02-16,2533636,Naomi,"Very comfortable stay, nice guy. He accommodated us with very short notice and we were very happy!! Would recommend "
1790020,27000869,2015-02-23,4810767,Joshua,"Calen is the man! His apartment was clean and conveniently located, he had a very generous set-up, and went well out of his way to make sure I had a great time in Seattle. You really can't go wrong with the host or the space. Thanks again, Calen!

10/10 Would Stay Again"
1790020,27084476,2015-02-24,1356945,Anik,"Comfortable, convenient and affordable. Exactly what I was looking for. "
1790020,27257100,2015-03-01,25572905,Johann,Great location and easy to access the city. I really enjoyed my stay. A very relaxed and friendly environment.
1790020,27898752,2015-03-14,1918714,Michael,"I stayed a little under two weeks while apartment-hunting and this place served as a great home-base. After getting a quick response for booking the room, check-in was explained clearly in a text message, so even though no-one was around when I arrived, I was able to get access to the place quickly and easily. Calen's knowledge of the city proved insightful when he was at the the apartment a couple days later. He has a bulletin board with loads of thank-you notes from previous guests, so I felt I wasn't the only one who enjoyed my stay. It was a positive AirBnB stay overall. "
1790020,28188835,2015-03-19,22653831,Dongwoo,"Two thums up! I deeply appreciate a very warm welcome from Calen. Few days prior to arriving his place, he already provided many details enough in clear ways, so I didn't get confused and didn't have any problem with enjoyng the place at all. I liked clean bedroom, fast wifi. The place is located in he Capito Hill area where you can enjoy nightlife."
1790020,28278762,2015-03-21,4158314,Gloria,Good place. Calen was very helpful and easily reachable. He made check in and check out easy. The apartment is cool and good location. Thank you! 
1790020,28421954,2015-03-23,28818499,Yuna,"Calen was an awesome host- very friendly, genuine, and accommodating. He is very approachable and responds quickly to messages/concerns. More than anything, he made us feel very welcome &  at home, and I was happy to have an awesome first airbnb experience thanks to him. "
1790020,28659550,2015-03-28,2257446,Tina,"Calen was very helpful and responsive when checking in. The view from the deck was amazing! I wasn't in the apartment much, but it had everything I needed and the heated bed was awesome. Thanks for letting me stay!"
1790020,28751327,2015-03-29,9244707,Jessica,"Calen was a great host. The place is in a very convenient location, close to lots of great food and shops."
1790020,29358408,2015-04-06,12311805,Belinda,Calen was very helpful though I was unable to meet him.
1790020,29708833,2015-04-11,2716462,Shanndara & Ben,We very much enjoyed our stay here. Calen was a great host and really helped the whole process run smoothly. It is very conveniently located and just what we were looking for during our few days in Seattle. Much recommended! :)
1790020,30055671,2015-04-16,1708279,Melanie,I booked last
1790020,30323600,2015-04-20,3806067,David,Everything was great. The apartment is in a very nice part of Capitol Hill with all the amenities including a yoga and barre studio nearby. There were basic things including towels and shampoo included.
1790020,30539550,2015-04-23,31559160,Evan,Comfortable stay in a great location. The view from the deck is incredible.
1790020,30720983,2015-04-26,31170444,Juliet,Perfect location! The place was close to the bus line and the city was a 15 minute walk away. The apartment was clean and has a balcony with a view of the city. Calen was personable and helpful. He gave us some suggestions of things to see based on our interests and even got us in touch with another guest staying the same weekend to see if we wanted to include him. Capitol Hill is a beautiful neighborhood with friendly people. I would definitely recommend this place to a fellow adventurer. 
1790020,31019734,2015-04-30,23501928,Bill,"Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood with wonderful restaurants and bars just up the hill from 12th Ave East on 15th Ave East - extremely accessible to Calen's place. I had a great late night meal on arrival at Hopvine, a pub, plus dinner with friends that I met on my trip at Jamjuree and amazing Thai place next door to Hopvine. We finished the evening with an amazing drink, ""Point of No Return"" at Liberty on the other side of Jamjuree. Try the drink if you dare:)

Calen was an excellent host. He communicated with me in advance when I asked questions. For the most part I didn't see him until my last evening because I was in Seattle working on a project at Creative Live and had to be in the studio by 8 AM and for the most part came back to Calen's place late.

BTW, there is excellent bus service to other parts of town just 2 blocks away. I chose not to hassle a car in Seattle on this trip."
1790020,31861557,2015-05-10,26629870,Kelsey,We had a great time staying in Seattle at Calen's place unfortunately we never got a chance to meet him but don't have a bad thing to say about the experience. This was our first airb&b experience and Calen was organized and made the process very easy for us.
1790020,32042930,2015-05-12,33077710,Jay,"Great, no fuss host. I tried to book at 9pm for same night stay and response within minutes, and clean sheets by 10pm on arrival. Great communicator for host, and super capitol hill location.

Would recommend for any guest."
1790020,32210228,2015-05-15,26405720,Xiaoyi,"I from china and traveling in USA.calen is very nice people,I am no more English ,but Calen is very patience for (website hidden) is so close board way  .just 5miu by walk and here is very (website hidden) downtown just 13miu by bus."
1790020,32404427,2015-05-17,31308295,Jacob,"Calen was great!! Very easy going and accommodating. I was mainly just looking for any easy place to crash, leave my stuff, and take a shower. Worked great and he was far enough from the fun for quiet but not so far it wasn't walk-able to all the best Capitol Hill spots."
1790020,33289748,2015-05-26,20129316,Lawrence,"Calen was a very hospitable host. He was very professional  and experienced...he knows what he is doing. He was prompt in contacting me regarding the details of the booking sending pictures of the place and special instructions. He was generous in sharing tips on getting around the city, places to see and places to eat. I think he is pretty flexible in how much interaction you can get from him depending on how you prefer.

Location of his place was pretty convenient. Probably a 10 min walk to Pine/Pike St in Capitol hill which is a pretty happening place in Seattle. Pretty safe neighborhood. Lot’s of great food around the area without having to go all the way down to 1st Street. Definitely stumbling distance when you had too many Rainier Beers and Seattle dogs. And less than a 10 min walk to Volunteer park if you want to get some jogging done. 

The room was basic but sufficient. He has a nice Patio overlooking Seattle. Perfect for just hanging out with a cold brew. He has a nice comfy couch with a projector and a roku. Internet connection is decent and he even offers a guest computer. Just remember though that his place is on the 4th floor so you have 3 flights of stairs to go through if you have lots of luggage.

I would definitely stay with Calen again when I go back to Seattle.
"
1790020,33718587,2015-05-31,4433566,Alexandra,"Calen's apartment is a great spot to explore Seattle, very nice and lively neighborhood, we liked it a lot. 
Calen is a great host - easy to communicate with, gave us helpful tips for our visit, and keeps the apartment all clean & cosy! 
It was really fun staying there, thank you."
1790020,33873327,2015-06-01,26375453,Luke,"I didn't get a chance to meet Calen in person, but he did an excellent job of getting everything arranged with me and was a fantastic host.  The room was clean and comfortable, and the location of his apartment (especially the view!).  Overall a great place to stay. "
1790020,34028293,2015-06-03,10701731,Elizabeth,"I had a great stay at Calen's apartment. The location is phenomenal...i was in walking distance from a great coffee shop, a yoga studio and great restaurants/bars. Calen was super accommodating-I arrived early and had a late flight out--and very nice/approachable. I highly recommend this stay!  "
1790020,34179799,2015-06-05,31818565,Cameron,Calen has a very nice place in Capital Hill and I enjoyed my stay. I had the place to myself for most of my trip and just briefly met Calen. 
1790020,34567126,2015-06-09,14834008,Amanda,"My friend and I had a great stay at Calen's place!  We didn't get to meet Calen due to our hectic schedule (there is so much to explore in Seattle!) but he responded promptly to my reservation request and the questions I had along the way.  The location is great--it's close to tons of restaurants and the bus stop, so transportation was easy to figure out from there to other parts of the city.  I thoroughly enjoyed the view of downtown Seattle and the distant mountains from the balcony--it's absolutely gorgeous at sunset!  I would definitely recommend staying here if you're headed to the Emerald City for a trip!

"
1790020,34879858,2015-06-13,33440092,Lindsay,"We didn't get the chance to meet Calen until we were leaving but upon arrival, everything was clean and in order. His directions were very clear and easy to follow. Calen was also great at letting us know when other guests were checking-in to the second bedroom.
The neighborhood was great! There are tons of restaurants to eat at and places to explore. It was also nicely located between downtown Seattle (Pike's Market) and Seattle Center.   Overall, this was a really good Air BnB experience.   "
1790020,35241840,2015-06-16,22896921,Kim,"Calen was an absolutely amazing host! We had an amazing experience that was made easy for us from beginning to end.

Calen was even super understanding when we were late due to getting lost in public transit. I would recommend this Air BnB time and time again.

As my first time using Air BnB I can say that this has made me want to use it again."
1790020,35487435,2015-06-19,12182091,Janet,"Calen was great, as was the apartment.  Everything was as advertised, no surprises.  Bed was comfy and sheets were SOFT - must be a high thread count.  Also, the location is fantastic.  Just be careful of getting stuck on the wrong side of the 5 during rush hour - Seattle traffic is no joke!  

I would definitely stay at Calen's again."
1790020,35663778,2015-06-21,30720648,Devon,"great place in a great area, exactly as advertised, easy check in and out...Calen was great and accommodating and easy to get in touch with, room and apartment was perfect for us...great deck."
1790020,36150607,2015-06-25,36289987,Adam,"Great view. Loved the balcony. Clean, easy access. Worked out well! Thanks again. "
1790020,36562724,2015-06-29,7044769,Jeremy,Calen was a great host! The place was great and the location was awesome. Right in the center of everything you want to get to in Capitol Hill and not a far walk from downtown. I enjoyed getting to know Calen and the other guests too. I'll stay here again and again when I'm in Seattle!
1790020,36751755,2015-06-30,18354169,Matt,"My stay was simple and seamless - exactly what I was looking for. I needed a quick comfortable place to crash for a relatively-last minute work trip, and the Calen's place delivered. His communication was flawless, entry was easy, the neighborhood is full of interesting places, and the bed was comfortable. I didn't get a chance to check out much of his house. It was hot and humid, but water and a well positioned fan helped keep discomfort low. A great stay all around."
1790020,36870826,2015-07-02,13158682,Timothy,"Calen was a nice guy and easy to coordinate with. The location was great. The common areas, especially the bathroom was in need of a good cleaning though."
1790020,37094219,2015-07-04,12966966,Henry,"This place was great! Easy, flexible check-in, very comfortable, and awesome location. Will definitely check it out for future stays in Capitol Hill. "
1790020,37372586,2015-07-06,36080586,Stephen,"Great view of the Seattle skyline, especially at night.  Didn't actually meet Calen, but he gave us excellent thorough instructions on the apartment."
1790020,37824660,2015-07-10,9453644,Amanda,Great place in a great location.  I had to book last minute and Calen was quick to respond and his directions were perfect and easy to follow.  The place was clean and comfy; I'd definitely stay again on my next trip to Seattle! 
1790020,39471467,2015-07-23,39266874,Michael,"Calen was extremely helpful finding parking and was very easy work with.  The place was nice, with an excellent location.  "
1790020,39556829,2015-07-24,21502581,Brian,Apartment was in a great location.  It is nothing fancy but it gets the job done and as said the location was perfect.  Calen was very welcoming and made us feel like we were at our own home
1790020,39650591,2015-07-25,7488877,Donna,"Calen was a great host! He was quick at responding to my questions and ensure that my friend and I felt welcome. The place was clean and well-organized. I am also very glad that the place is also close to everywhere we wanted to go in Seattle, making our stay that much more enjoyable. Thank you for having us, Calen!"
1790020,39798307,2015-07-26,17031988,Alex,"We were only here for one night. Place was fine. We had what we needed. Apartment wasn't super clean, but not too bad. "
1790020,40405093,2015-07-30,3370111,Bob,"Yes, I felt welcomed.  Good communication despite hosts busy schedule. We connected several times with good results."
1790020,41225912,2015-08-05,1654261,Sara," I came to Seattle with my sister for a little R & R. Our stay with at Calen's place was exactly what we wanted and needed.The apartment is smack dab right in the middle of great restaurants, bars, bookstores, cafes, etc., the balcony has a great view of downtown and the Space Needle, room and bathroom were clean and the bed was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept on. I would recommend staying here, most definitely. "
1790020,41394171,2015-08-07,7591980,Jennifer,"Calen was incredibly responsive and accommodating.  Our flight got in 2 hours before our check in and Calen coordinated with the previous guests to see if we could check in earlier. The unit was as described, clean and functional. The only downside is that there was construction in the neighboring unit that was quite loud at times. The neighborhood is fantastic and fun to eat and go out in. I recommend this place."
1790020,41466628,2015-08-07,27606866,Arl, Calen was an excellent Host.  The flat was everything that is advertised. Would Recommend this to everyone.
1790020,41963383,2015-08-10,35341453,Erin,"While we did not get to meet Calen in person, my fiancé and I had a great stay at his place. Calen was really easy to get in touch with despite being out of town for the weekend and was very accommodating in arranging for a late check out since we had a late flight out of Seattle. His apartment is very conveniently located within walking distance to a lot of the attractions in the city and is close to great restaurants and bars. I'd definitely recommend Calen's apartment as an easy, convenient place to stay."
1790020,42572706,2015-08-14,6340166,Paula,"Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this listing. While the host was very responsive in the beginning providing info and access to the property, he was completely unresponsive once issues arose that required resolution. MAIN ISSUE: the property was very dirty -- hair and grime in bathtub, toothpaste residue in sink, and enough dust everywhere to write in. We alerted the host, who came over to address this, but cleaning had been neglected for so long that it really required a professional deep cleaning. So even after host attempted to clean, it was still not OK. We left before our reservation expired and booked at a local hotel, which was very expensive on short notice in high season, but conditions at host's property were intolerable."
1790020,43078770,2015-08-17,31940059,Glen,The room was exactly as described in the listing; and location was great.  It was easy to get to and a great place for a weekend visit.  Thanks for the room!
1790020,43468187,2015-08-19,38965992,Warren,"Calen was great. This was my first time on Airbnb. He was very helpful. The sign-in went flawlessly. A very clean, well equipped apartment. Nice view. I'd stay there again in a heart beat."
1790020,43725239,2015-08-21,24969579,Melissa,"Smooth check in check out.
The shower is very good and the bed decent.
Nice location, walking distance to bars and restaurants. Also an enjoyable walk downtown.
I appreciate that Calen was able to place the sleeping bag that I forgot by accident at his place, in the outside for me to pick it up 2 days later.

"
1790020,44621801,2015-08-27,7727712,Philip And Caoimhe,"Our stay at Calen's was restful and casual. He sent us all of the info about the apartment in advance by email. That way, we were able to get the keys and leave our luggage even though he wasn't there. The bedroom was comfortable, and we were told to help ourselves to anything in the kitchen. Calen responded very quickly to our inquiries both beforehand and when we arrived at the apartment, which was extremely helpful for the stressful situation that brought us to Seattle. He was also very flexible about our check-in and check-out. We enjoyed the outdoor patio very much. There are comfy cushions and blankets everywhere. The location is also great for accessing Capitol Hill and bus routes. Thanks, Calen!"
1790020,45115116,2015-08-31,39334342,Christine,Calen was a great host. He gave very clear directions and was also very welcoming. The description of the place was also accurate and looks just as it is in the pictures. The location of the place was also  conveniently located near many bus stops and stores. I highly recommend this airbnb! 
1790020,45845172,2015-09-06,41836841,Brent,"Calen got in touch with me in the days leading up to my stay and provided detailed instructions of how to get access to my room, which made things pretty simple. The apartment was clean and the room was as described. 

The neighborhood has a lot of great bars, restaurants and coffee shops, and has really great access to a public transit. I never felt unsafe walking around, even at night. I definitely made a smart choice by staying here."
1790020,46291280,2015-09-09,3462968,Amy,"I had a great time staying at Calen's place. The location is actually pretty fantastic and his place is immaculate. Calen is a great host who made sure I was able to get into his place, and communicated with me consistently from check-in to check-out. awesome place, and GREAT wifi. :) "
1790020,46988694,2015-09-14,29234533,Randy,"I stayed at Calens for 5 nights, it's in a great location within walking distance to a ton of great places in the neighborhood.  It is on a pretty quiet street as well, I slept with the windows open and even on the weekends I didn't hear much traffic or people.  The balcony was also amazing, great view with a comfy place to sit and enjoy the evening air.

There were alot of thoughtful little things for guests like power strip near the bed, a desk, hangers and open closet space, lots of guides and maps, a shopping bag and grocery store card on the keys.  You can tell he takes pride in being a good host and put effort into making the place even more accommodating than a hotel."
1790020,47677019,2015-09-21,39245642,Jeanette,Calen was a congenial host.
1790020,48633580,2015-09-27,44475755,Rieka,"I stay 5-6days. Here is best place.clean and walk to downtown 20min.
People is kind :)
There is big screen, so i enjoy watching movie.Thanks calen."
1790020,48838910,2015-09-28,44767394,Rebbecca,Calen was easily available for questions. The neighborhood was perfect! His place was comfortable. My daughter and I went to Seattle to visit family and had a great time--no worries. 
1790020,49189501,2015-10-01,41158892,Paige,"What a great place! I didn't get to meet Calen, but the room I had was comfy and the apartment was in a great location. Would recommend!"
1790020,49539726,2015-10-04,44305318,Paula,"Great calm spot in the middle of Capitol Hill! Though i never got to meet Calen,  he made sure everything went fine.  Clean, cosy bed, cool flat. Recommended "
1790020,50153810,2015-10-09,6600206,Michael,"The apartment was fabulous. Without Calen present, we were able to check-in and check-out with ease. Calen was very helpful and we'd certainly stay there again!"
1790020,50339877,2015-10-11,44636340,Michael,"Great location, amiable host, easy check-in and checkout."
1790020,50609597,2015-10-12,42156679,Jason,It was very easy to work with Calen and the room is in a great location with easy walking access to everything around Capital Hill. 
1790020,51206433,2015-10-18,45904237,Jeff,"The location is perfect. The place and bathroom were very clean and welcoming. It was easy and comfortable, the way you hope for with an AirBnB. Thank you for a great stay. "
1790020,51518302,2015-10-20,46804569,Mathieu,"First of all, staying at Calen's place was my first AirBnB experience and so thankful my plans fell through and I was able to stay at Calen's Capital Hill apartment. My original housing cancelled and I submitted to Calen and within twenty minutes I had a place to stay...for the very same night as I was pulled over at a rest stop in Portland on my way to Seattle. I had three interviews in two days and coincidentally Calen's spot was in the middle of all three so I was able to walk to all of them making the experience that much more enjoyable. I even lost (deleted) his e-mail laying out the finer points of entering the building and keybox information between walking from my car to the building and texted Calen. He responded within a few minutes with a call back. Extremely helpful! The place was tidy and quaint...a living, breathing apartment. Towels were left out and a couple bottles of water. I even pulled out the ironing board from a closet to iron my shirts. Great location...few blocks east and you're own 15th avenue with anything you might need. Walk down 12th and you're in the hustle and bustle of the downtown. Stay in and you've a nice little living room and fully functioning kitchen with a spectacular view of the skyline. Parking was a breeze. Again, I haven't had any other experience to compare it to, but I would highly recommend Calen Capital Hill spot...and would more than likely stay there again if I needed. "
1790020,51865421,2015-10-24,23542822,Bryan,"Calen was super attentive and everything was great, just what I was hoping for. Would definitely stay again."
1790020,52064462,2015-10-26,10934438,Katherine,Capitol Hill was a lovely neighborhood; most things accessible by foot with adaptable transportation.
1790020,52783461,2015-11-01,46671058,Jack,"Calen has set the bar high for my first Airbnb experience.  He was very friendly and very fun to talk to.  His house was well maintained and the location couldn't be beat.  I loved staying in and watching Netflix on his wall projector, and the views were gorgeous.  Plus Lucky was a real sweetheart and very cute. "
1790020,53437710,2015-11-08,5327498,Derick,I really enjoyed my stay at Calen's place in Capitol Hill. He was very accommodating and has a very nice dog. I would definitely recommend this place and would stay here myself a second time.
1790020,53738324,2015-11-11,881861,Darrell,Host was so kind to take a very last minute request in the middle of the commute hours in the evening. He quickly went home and prepped my room for me. He was so gracious as to invite me to use his tv in the living room. Bed was comfy and for the price the accommodations were perfect! I would highly recommend Caleb as your host!
1790020,53870762,2015-11-13,43197902,Brooke,"Calen was wonderful, easy to coordinate with and really helpful and knowledgeable about the area. The place was clean and cozy -- we felt right at home!"
1790020,54187319,2015-11-16,6229452,Maria,"Calen's place was great! A perfect location to live like a local but with easy access to Seattle's best coffee shops, bars, restaurants, and parks. Calen may or may not be there but he's always available to answer any questions. "
1790020,54364549,2015-11-18,3769508,Jordan,"Calen was a blessing. When my flight got into Seattle at midnight (two hours late), I used the Instant Book feature and he helped me get adjusted—even way past check in time! Great place too, comfortable bed, and a great place to view Capitol Hill/dwtn Seattle on the balcony...I'll definitely stay here again :)"
1790020,54949437,2015-11-25,42066154,Aubrey,Calen was extremely friendly and accessible. He was a great host! The location and view of the city was great. The walk to broadway was about ten minutes. Parking is always kind of an issue in Seattle but we managed to find a few spots pretty close by. Theres a lot to do in this area which is awesome. great deal for the price.
1790020,55034565,2015-11-27,41512,Sarah,"Calens place is in an ideal location, has great views, and is very comfortable. Calen himself is a warm and welcoming host, clear communicator and available for anything that may arise. Single female travellers should be aware that Calen rents out both his rooms, so you might be sharing with someone who is not the host and whom you've never met. This was a surprise to me as I arrived home late one night to find a man I didn't know in the house. There are locks on the bedroom doors but only from the inside, so there is some element of trust needed if you choose to leave your things during the day (like a hostel). Everything was fine with my stay - most people are good people - and I had no incident. Just something to note. I walked everywhere and had a great time. Thanks! "
1790020,55089226,2015-11-27,13100682,Adam,"Calen's place was easy to check into, very central location and at a good price. Calen was also accomodating and communicative, I Would come back. "
1790020,55336238,2015-11-29,4716944,Forrest,The place was great. Spacious and convenient. 
1790020,55506179,2015-12-01,33858606,Stuart,Calen was extremely helpful and responsive. His place was very clean and had an amazing view!
1790020,57736229,2015-12-28,19227916,Michael,"Calen was very easy to work with, and his place was very accommodating and centrally located. I would stay here again."
7518794,41020640,2015-08-03,33783237,Sage,"My boyfriend and I stayed two nights and had a great time.  Izabella's apartment was in a great location, walking distance to downtown Seattle and popular attractions.  The apartment was very clean and comfortable, so we felt right at home.  Izabella was a great host - she kept in touch while coordinating our arrival, and even suggested her favorite coffee and food spots in the area.  Great place to stay while we explored Seattle!"
7518794,43129657,2015-08-17,18230433,Dmitriy,"The apt is as described, perfect location for restaurants/bars/downtown. Very easy access. coffee roasters on every block including across the street. Parking lot available a few blocks away. Great spot for a weekend trip!"
7518794,44240827,2015-08-24,122699,Shira,"I loved everything about staying at Izabella's studio in Capitol Hill. It was perfect for my needs as a solo traveler - cozy, clean, very comfortable and quiet, but near all the action in the area. Izabella was very communicative and made for an easy check-in. "
7518794,45308445,2015-09-01,359179,Cemre,"Izabella's studio was perfectly located within walking distance to all of the novelties of the Cap Hill area. The apartment was small and cozy. This was a great launchpad for weekend adventures. couple things to note: the bed might be a tad small for two, and parking in the immediate vicinity is zoned. So, pre-plan should you have a rental car."
7518794,45996958,2015-09-07,156103,Alan,"We rented the entire place for a short time, it was easy to stay here and Izabella's apartment is nicely put together and filled our needs as we were in town for a wedding."
7518794,46933937,2015-09-14,29448348,Matt,"Great location. Short walk to everything in Capitol Hill, 15/20 minute walk to downtown/pike place market. And short uber to other nearby sights. "
7518794,48007809,2015-09-22,3261901,Michelle,"This studio in Capitol Hill was fantastic. It was in a great neighborhood full of bars, restaurants, and shops. Everything was in walking distance and the entire area felt very safe.

The apartment itself was great for 2 people. We had everything we needed and thoroughly enjoyed our short stay in Seattle. The wifi was a bit spotty at times, but sometimes it worked just fine. 

My only feedback was I wish there was a larger mirror other than the bathroom mirror to get ready with."
3379116,19555163,2014-09-14,20739379,Mary,"This was our first stay using airbnb, we were so pleased with the carriage house and the overall experience.  Jill, our host, replied promptly made us feel at home.  We hade 4 adults, 2 teenagers and two toddlers staying in the carriage house.  It fit our needs and had something for everyone.  The kitchen was perfect, the games and books were fun for all and the wifi was great.  It was clean and the towels and linens were very nice.  The attention to detail was appreciated.  I hope we can return and stay again.  "
3379116,19793324,2014-09-18,17430331,Dawn,"We loved this spot!!
It's all about the details.
Everything we could have possibly needed was provided us from gas for the grill to firewood for the fire place and out door firepit.

We had the dishes and steamware we needed, bathroom soaps and more.

The house is charming...a spot you can imagine comfortably living...and the details!
It's close to the freeway, which could be a distraction had not Jill considered this.
The white noise machine in the bedroom had me peacefully falling asleep each night to the gentle sound of rolling ocean waves and not noticing the cars near by.
The books and games added a homey feel.
The decor fit the cottage perfectly and added to its charm.

This was my first experiance with airbnb. Based on this stay I can honestly say BRAVO!!"
3379116,19876691,2014-09-20,19081057,Sarah,We loved staying at the carriage house! Although it was small there was enough space for all 7 of us to sleep and we all slept wonderfully and very comfortably! 
3379116,19935736,2014-09-21,18890416,Jennifer,Jill was very hospitable and friendly.  Everything was provided.  The Carriage was clean and charming.  Outside was rather noisy since the lodging is near a highway.  The interior was comfortable but the highway could still be heard.
3379116,20835103,2014-10-06,20768157,Tammy,"This was our first airbnb experience and it couldn't have been more perfect!  We loved the carriage house! The location was perfect, the entire carriage house was immaculate and Jill has thought of everything a guest could possibly need! Laundry soap, dryer sheets, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, iron, books, games and so much more!
Even though we only live across the Puget Sound from Seattle we needed a place in Seattle proper for our daughters wedding weekend of festivities.  We had 2 of our son's and their wife/girlfriend staying with us from out of state. Jill let us check in early and was very responsive to all communication throughout. 
The house is right by the freeway so it is a bit noisy but that is city living. Jill provides sound machines and ear plugs (none of us needed them).  It's is beautifully decorated and bigger than it looks in the pictures. 
The parking is street parking and can be a bit difficult to find an open spot at times. However we never had to park more than a block away. If you have elderly or disabled people in a group you can pull into the alley right in front of the door to drop off and pick them up.
We had many family members come and hang out with us at various times in the 4 days we were there. Everyone fell in love with it.
It was a wonderful experience and we highly recommend this place and Jill!"
3379116,22646668,2014-11-11,16097169,Jenny,"Great experience!!! Four parents, three kids! The loft area was fabulous for the kids!! Location excellent! Ask for flat rates with the Cab Companies! All and all great time !"
3379116,25557313,2015-01-19,25353070,Tiffany,"Loved our stay at the Whimsical Seattle Carriage! House is cute, quaint, perfect to come home after a day of sight-seeing. Pictures and description were accurate, and Jill was a pleasant to work with. "
3379116,26005215,2015-02-01,17370155,Chanel,"Great house!  Quiet, clean, cozy.  We loved the toys, puzzles, books and games for evenings in and discovering another part of Seattle.  We couldn't figure out exact upstairs layout from photos - FYI: upstairs is one little nook where a kid could sleep and then one big room with a bed and a futon."
3379116,26162387,2015-02-05,26019364,Alex,Nice neighborhood and location.  Host was very nice.  BBQ area looked welcoming but I never got a chance to use with weather
3379116,26220375,2015-02-07,26312417,Msyel,"Jill's place was perfect for our needs. We came in at night and she was there to meet us and welcome us to her house. We couldn't have asked for more, we had everything we needed- from toiletries, kitchen supplies and toys for the kids. We are definitely looking forward to coming back here! Thank you for sharing with us your beautiful home."
3379116,26320881,2015-02-09,26509087,Reetu,"We had a group of 6 girlfriends recently rent Jill's place. It was fantastic. Jill was very helpful and kind. The place was very clean, and well stocked (shampoo, conditioner, dishes etc). The house itself is quite spacious and the beds in the downstairs rooms were very comfortable. The coffee was delicious, and there were books for all ages in every room. It was about at $10-$12 cab ride to downtown Seattle and close to a grocery market and coffee shops. We would definitely recommend this place. "
3379116,26927615,2015-02-22,402884,Newman,"Absolutely awesome cottage-feeling home in the middle of Seattle. Jill did a fantastic job of trying to meet us on arrival (we were about 40 minutes late due to a border delay). 

The house was immaculately clean and amazingly well appointed. The coffee and snacks left behind were very much appreciated. Beds were amazingly comfortable and when we were inside, it was like an oasis inside of such a beautiful city and location.

A great family space as well, the children's nook with games and books would have been fantastic for my 4 year old.

We will absolutely be back, Seattle is a fantastic city and the Carriage house is the perfect place to debrief your adventures."
3379116,28304892,2015-03-22,21023578,Katherine,Jill was super responsive to all of my questions and her home is absolutely beautiful! 
3379116,28537371,2015-03-25,29179378,Alex,"Beautiful, charming place! Jill was very responsive and made sure we had all we need. "
3379116,29005785,2015-04-02,29198801,Caroline,"I love my host, no kidding. She made my Seattle that much better even with the gloomy weather. It also mentioned that we get to fit in 8 people at most but I believed there could have 10 people overnight and it still will not be a problem. Not sure if Jill mentioned in her listing but yes, she provides generous amounts of shampoo, body wash, conditioners, towels(big/small, she has it all), games(from board to poker), and leaves around sweet little treats in the entire house. 
Not to mention, I also believed that her house is very Instagram-worthy! "
3379116,30131295,2015-04-18,9583489,Michael,"Jill made it very easy for us to check in and accommodations were perfect. The place looks just as beautiful in person as in the pictures and yes there are real chickens and you can have their eggs for breakfast.
The house is VERY close to downtown and Pike's Place (about 5 min drive).  
One tidbit that isn't mentioned, the house is within walking distance of the cemetery that Bruce Lee is buried in.
We had a blast and when we return to Seattle we will be sure to check if this place is available first."
3379116,30312036,2015-04-20,29174131,Chelsea,The carriage house in Seattle was my first Air b&b experience and it was lovely! Jill was a gracious host and let us enjoy her backyard fire pit. The house is beautiful with two queen beds two full beds plus a children's nook. She has books for all ages everywhere and though I was there for work it would be a lovely place to stay with kids. I will be back for sure!
3379116,31166787,2015-05-03,24950857,Faith,"Jill was very welcoming from the very beginning and responded to emails very quickly. The pictures do not do the place a justice! It is so beautifully built, and it is clean, cozy and comfortable. It was the perfect mini-getaway for a girl's weekend. We were also fortunate that the kitchen was stocked with all the cooking supplies we needed to prepare a full meal. We also had the chance to spend some time in the backyard patio area and really enjoyed being out there. After booking the place, we decided we wanted to watch a boxing match on PPV. I contact Jill about this, and I was so impressed with how she went out of her way to make sure we could watch it. She contacted the cable company, moved around her cable boxes, and even offered us an alternate option in case it didn't work. We could not have asked for a better host. We would all love to stay here again! Thanks again for everything Jill!! "
3379116,31454110,2015-05-05,6243013,Dale,"My family and I loved this gem. Jill was an excellent host, easy to communicate with and always accessible. The place was very clean and had great interiors. Loved the beds.. very comfortable! :) Would absolutely stay here again. Thanks Jill!"
3379116,31693583,2015-05-09,26602343,John,"The carriage house was everything we were looking for. Plenty of space, great location, parking and privacy. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in seattle. "
3379116,32170109,2015-05-15,29754426,Jeff,"This first experience with an Airbnb property was a real joy.  Our family flew into Seattle in the morning and easily accessed this conveniently located Carriage House using only public transportation.  This clean, well appointed house was just right for our stay. There was plenty of room for a party of 8 and our group of 6 had privacy in the 2 bedrooms and the upstairs sleeping area.   The kitchen allowed us to prepare our breakfasts before we ventured out for the day.  We also visited a wonderful restaurant within easy walking distance. The buses were frequent and we used the Uber cab for inexpensive ($12) transport from downtown.  Our host was very responsive to our requests and was quite an experienced / knowledgeable resource.  We felt safe, secure and cared about.  Our only wish was that our stay would have been longer.  I wanted to enjoy a campfire on your back patio.  Thanks for a wonderful experience. Jeff M"

The backyard is amazing and so fun with the chickens and fire pit. It's a great location near the city with fun local spots nearby. Jill and her husband were great with us as well, easy to communicate with and happy to host us. A real gem! "
3379116,33541757,2015-05-29,26041707,Sophie,"Jill was a wonderful host and we had a fabulous time at the cottage. We had absolute privacy, though Jill was also available to answer any questions about shopping/dining/sightseeing. The cottage is very comfortable and full of toys, books and games for children and adults of all ages. I highly recommend this cottage. "
3379116,34009501,2015-06-03,32768362,Gail,"House was very nicely done and Jill was very welcoming.  There are lots of homey touches and helpful information all over the house.  Our kids loved finding a warm egg compliments of the chickens.  The only thing we wish had been put in the listing is that the house is adjacent to a major highway, it may not have changed our plans to stay but we felt we should have known up front.  The house has shutters on the windows and heavy curtains that cut down the traffic noise so we slept fine but it was too loud to enjoy the back yard."
3379116,34179226,2015-06-05,21465549,Sven,"Very nice stay, cute lil house with the perfect amount of space. Everything worked out delightful and Jill our host is very nice as well!

3379116,34549689,2015-06-09,31121125,Claudio,"Our group had an amazing time in Seattle. Very much aided by the amazing home provided to us by Jill. 

The house slept 6 adults easily and was very comfortable with everything you needed for a few nights in Seattle. 

Would recommend this Airbnb to anyone! 

Thanks Jill"
3379116,35996390,2015-06-24,24422001,Laura,"This little carriage house happily accommodated our 6 person family. Less than 15 minutes from the space needle, the location can't be beat. We walked to a bakery and a little general store easily and Jill was very helpful. The back courtyard is super cute (with the quietest chickens ever). 5 stars for sure. "
3379116,37131995,2015-07-05,21233767,Allyson,"We loved our visit to Seattle!  The location was very ideal.  We were able to walk to several parks and yummy restaurants.  We also felt very safe.  My family also loved how we were able to all be together in one place.  The house was so cute and comfortable.  Jill was a great host.  She made us feel very welcome.  The beds slept great and the shower was wonderful.  The home also had a nice kitchen where you could cook if you wanted to.  Jill was also very helpful in providing tips for the city. She also was very easy to contact.  One thing that really impressed my family was that Jill would allow us to check in early due to special circumstances.  If we ever stay in Seattle again, we would love to stay at Jill's."
3379116,37829779,2015-07-11,26445153,Douglas,"We had a great experience in Seattle!  Our group could not have had a better experience!  House is quaint, well stocked, well decorated and even supplies fresh eggs!  Jill, the owner went above and beyond to help any need that we had!"
3379116,38120904,2015-07-13,6064740,Rebecca,"So charming! The house is adorable. It was easy to park and drive to tons of great restaurants, shops, etc. Jill was helpful and quick to respond to any questions we had. Would definitely recommend it! "
3379116,41308452,2015-08-07,23299350,Carrie,"Jill was a fabulous hostess. Very welcoming, checking in right before and during our stay. She always answered questions promptly and had great suggestions on how to enjoy Seattle."
3379116,42377956,2015-08-13,21707523,Erin,"The carriage house was amazing! For a relatively small building, the space is used incredibly well. There were two bedrooms downstairs each with a 2-person bed, and upstairs was a big room with two big beds and plenty of space if someone wanted to sleep on the floor. We had between 6 and 8 people, and there's only one bathroom, but it wasn't a problem. Jill was very welcoming, and the neighborhood was very quiet and peaceful. The highway does make a significant amount of noise outside of the house, but inside I didn't even notice it. The back patio is perfect, too, with a great firepit, a big fancy grill, and chickens."
3379116,42812013,2015-08-16,26181893,Eli,"Overall a great place to stay. Well decorated, a good size for 3 couples and a few kids. The courtyard was a nice extra space. The road noise seemed like it would be a problem but the sound deadening made it barely noticeable. "
3379116,43263759,2015-08-18,37240282,Idell,"The description does not do it justice, rooms were a nice size great accommodation. Very nice area and convenient location to get around."
3379116,44282164,2015-08-25,30583999,Cynthia,"The carriage house felt like home away from home.  Clean and comfortable with everything we needed.
Lots to see in walking distance and very close to Lake Union.

3379116,45368201,2015-09-02,29731203,Donald,Jill was an excellent host and the house was perfect for our family.  The location is great for getting in & around Seattle.  We wouldn't hesitate staying here again. 
3379116,46865091,2015-09-14,30671478,Carolyn,"
Jill was the perfect host, taking care of so many details. She really thought of everything, from a well stocked kitchen to games and toys for children. We had a family barbeque while there and Jill even supplied the music for us. Everything was clean and tidy and we were very comfortable there. The house is in walking distance to many restaurants and to Lake Union where you can enjoy the beautiful sunset. I would highly reccommend this lovely carriage house when visiting the Seattle area  "
3379116,47623357,2015-09-21,3435536,Lexi,"We had an absolutely fantastic weekend at Jill's wonderful Seattle home! She was responsive, extremely accommodating and absolutely wonderful to coordinate with. Our group had a wonderful weekend, and thanks to Jill it was done with ease! Would recommend to any small groups staying in the area, and wouldn't be surprises if we find ourselves back there next time we're in town!"
3379116,48444378,2015-09-26,43956432,Carmen,The carriage house was perfect for a few nights for my family to relax while we were in Seattle.  Jill has done an amazing job covering anything one would need while on vacation. From the kitchen items to make our own breakfast with the fresh eggs from the chickens to the toiletries in the bathroom - Jill covered it all.  She also allowed us to check in early due to an early morning flight arrival.  The house was beautiful and comfortable.  Our young boys especially loved the toys upstairs to play with and the chicken coop in the back.  We will not hesitate to stay here again.  Thanks again for everything Jill!
3379116,49633630,2015-10-05,2935758,Alexandria,"We booked the Carriage House for a family birthday weekend and it was just perfect for our needs. It was even more lovely than the pictures! Nicely decorated and appointed with many nice touches (candy bowl at the door, board games, toys, fancy soap/lotion, fresh eggs from the backyard chickens!). It's a very spacious place and can sleep a lot of people. The home is in an accessible location in a beautiful neighborhood, with a good coffee shop down the street. Jill was very responsive and accommodating both before and during our stay there. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone."
3379116,50627711,2015-10-13,39819281,Christine,This place was more than great! It was so adorable and cozy and Jill went out of her way to make us feel welcome! She had everything we could possibly need and reminded us several times that if we needed anything at all to let her know. She even brought us a whole bucket of ice because we forgot to fill the nice cube trays :) I highly recommend staying here. It was very close to everything downtown and in a really cute neighborhood. We went running each morning and had some beautiful views of the city. We even walked to a cute french pastry shop about a mile away. Can't say enough great things about this place and its host!!
3379116,51125086,2015-10-18,13506350,Gregory,"The Seattle Carriage House was the perfect home away from home for our weekend in Seattle. Situated in a great neighborhood with quick access to anywhere we needed to be, it served well for us exploring Seattle. The listing is EXACTLY like the photos portray it and the beds are extremely comfortable. Finally, Jill was the best host. She was responsive, answered any questions I had and made sure that we were always taken care of. Thank you for a weekend we will not soon forget! "
3379116,51898369,2015-10-25,41723181,George,Jill was a great host! She kept up communication and responded promptly every time. The Carriage house was clean and had a good supply of kitchen items. We found what we expected thanks to Jills well thought out description. I even found some bonus items such as  a movie collection and a large supply of wood that Jill allowed us to use graciously.  The neighborhood is adjacent to the freeway so there is some road noise but we quickly became accustomed to it; the house itself is located off a small alley which leads down to a upscale cafe and yoga studio. We had to walk a mile or so to find groceries mainly because we set out looking for it without mapping it out. That provided an opportunity for a good walk for our dog which Jill allowed despite the last minute request! We are very appreciative of their hospitality and would certainly stay again.  
8956628,58139101,2016-01-01,46790466,Dina,Marianne was very responsive and was very informative.  The location was great and close to work.  
3329962,15702156,2014-07-14,13360873,Patricia,"The host is easy to contact, and accommodated me when I needed to leave my suitcase before check-in time. Other than that, the small, two-level apartment was a disappointment. It was difficult to find within the older motel-like complex with no elevator. I dragged my suitcase up and down the concrete steps trying to find it.
It was a super hot day in Seattle, but there was no fan or air conditioning in the apartment. Leaving the windows open for air compromised my privacy, but I had to keep the blinds up to get a breeze. Don't expect the level of hotel care because this is an old apartment without fancy amenities. There is no TV. There was one bath towel. The hand soap in the bathroom was used. There were no ice cube trays to fill, important on this ultra warm day. It is located between a creepy alley covered with steel plates that make noise when driven on (see other review), and the parking lot. Lots of air conditioner/machine noise came from the alley. This was an expensive mistake on my part."
3329962,15920878,2014-07-18,5291258,New,"Melissa was wonderful.  I was worried that she was not receiving my texts and emails, but we connected in advance of our arrival.  She had unlocked the door and met us when we arrived.  I appreciated her friendliness and responsiveness.  The temperatures were very hot in Seattle and their is no ac in the apartment. I let Melissa know that there was no toilet paper and that we really needed a fan.  She drove all over Seattle that afternoon to find us one so that we weren't melting the second night.  She even brought us an ice cream bar each to acknowledge our situation.  She is very thoughtful.
As for the room, it was clean and the bed was comfortable.  This is what I had most hoped for, so I was not disappointed.  The room itself is very noisy because of the alley behind the building and the road in front of the building.  After having lived in NYC in my 20s, it didn't particularly bother me.  The double garbage truck pick up at 6:45 a.m. was a bit of a bummer, but certainly nothing that our hostess could have controlled!  Overall, a very good experience.  Extremely convenient to the University!"
3329962,16303336,2014-07-25,16670137,Tobias,"We enjoyed our stay at Melissa's apartment a lot. We were in Seattle for job interviews at the university, so the apartment with its central location was ideal for us. It is a clean and cosy little place that has (almost) everything you need for living. 

Before we came, we read some of the negative feedback concerning the apartment: e.g. missing shampoo bottles, missing fan, too little towels. We were very pleased to discover upon our arrival that Melissa had taken this feedback to heart and had made the appropriate changes. Great job!!!"
3329962,16575161,2014-07-29,7670863,Charlie,"Reviewing unit 44

My gf and I were seeking to stay three nights in Seattle last minute.  Thank God Melissa's place was available - everywhere else was $200+ per night (before fees!)

The place: it's a pretty basic, clean place, no frills here.  But the bed is super comfortable!  We slept great on it.    

There's also an awesome fan that could really keep us comfortable.  It's small but moved serious air!

The location:  it's really easy to get downtown, and quite close to the bus line.   It's also next to large college campus, so there were many restrauraunt  options for when we got back from city.

The host: Melissa is super responsive.  The room didn't have ironing board.  She originally told me she'd have in 2 hrs because of appointments, but then delivered in 15 min.

The value: we paid $140 per night all in.  Given it was last minute booking it was good value.  But had it been further out, I'd say around $100 all in would be a great value, otherwise try to seek another location. "
3329962,16748645,2014-08-01,18413939,Kori,Our experience in the U District was great all thanks to this place! Close to everything and easy to find parking. Everything you need was here and Melissa is very responsive and easy to work with! Thanks Melissa! 
3329962,17694729,2014-08-16,5130155,Daniel,"A nice, really functional place in the U District. Clean, enough space, great location. The price is right. One complaint: the wireless internet was really unreliable, so, if wireless is a priority to you, maybe look somewhere else."
3329962,17896225,2014-08-18,19709209,Joseph,"I did not meet Melissa personally, but did chat with her on the phone and could tell she was very willing to help with whatever issues may arise with the apartment. However, she did such a good job of taking care of everything ahead of time, I didn't need to contact her about any issues! It was a great little quiet apartment (except for the garbage trucks as noted) and easily accessible to other parts of the city. I'd definitely be willing to stay here again if I were back in the city and needed a place to stay."
3329962,18135899,2014-08-22,12930125,Haoyuan,Melissa is a nice lady and professional host. 
3329962,19992787,2014-09-21,6138521,Andrew,The space was relatively easy to find and well accommodating for my needs while staying in the Seattle UW area.  The bed was comfortable and the space had everything I needed.  I'd love to stay there again anytime.
3329962,20580072,2014-10-01,4114056,Tori,"Melissa was very easy to keep in contact with and was always just a text or phone call away! We did not get the chance to meet her in person, but she was still very accommodating with our requests. The location itself is nicely nestled away in an apartment complex that is only a few blocks from The Ave, making it convenient to get to the restaurants there. Portage Bay Cafe, a great spot for breakfast, is just a street behind the apartment, as well! If we were not dining out, the apartment was well stocked with an assortment of kitchen utensils for us to cook with. Street parking was typically a bit of a fight, though we got lucky with all the nights that we stayed and were able to find a spot no more than a block away each time. We did not see many of the neighbors out, though the tenants above us engaged in a very early and thorough DIY project that woke us up a few mornings with their audible hammering and sawing (though I'm sure that this does not happen often). Some mornings, we woke to the sounds of the garbage trucks behind the apartment, but other than that, it was a peaceful location to stay in. The apartment has a cozy feel to it and is convenient for those who just need a place to rest, as the bed was very comfortable and we had all the privacy that we needed. Overall, it was a great place for our temporary stay."
3329962,21669770,2014-10-21,4296293,Barbara,"This apartment was pretty much as described.  The bed was comfortable, unit was clean. Location is excellent for visiting UW.
Fairly worn feeling apartment but adequate.  Optional parking spot at $8/day was a very good extra, as parking in the area is tight and regulated."
3329962,24065531,2014-12-18,11687832,Jim,"Melissa was great to work with. She got back to us quickly.  She answered all our questions. We had to add an extra night for the stay and he was very accommodating. 

The apartment is in a great location. It had everything we needed, including a very reasonably priced parking space.  The apartment was clean and just right for our needs.

3329962,25068362,2015-01-05,25421489,Grant,"small place in u district, i would even say 100 a night is a little steep, once there for a few days it felt cozy though, nice bed and enough supplies to get by and cook and such, steep cleaning fee though! aside from which melissa was fine; convenient for UW students"
3329962,26221297,2015-02-07,8958058,Noah,"Melissa was a very good host. She welcomed me, showed me apartment, and gave me restaurant suggestions for the area. The apartment was exactly as advertised, and I was very satisfied with it."
3329962,26656012,2015-02-16,7369350,Tommy,"The host was very responsive through texts which was very comforting.  Great location near UW Campus with a Starbucks a few blocks away.  Nice to have a kitchen to cook in.  Best part of the stay was the bed.  Super comfortable and spacious.
I would definitely say this place is suitable for 1-2 people as the place is not that spacious.  Lot's of noise going on outside with the remodeling but didn't seem to be loud in the house with some music on.  The $60 cleaning fee is a tad steep but was fine paying considering that I was able to walk into a clean place.
I travel to Seattle often and would stay again if the place was available."
3329962,31126680,2015-05-02,19328555,Peter,"Melissa was a great host. Although she was not at the  apartment when we arrived, we  could get into it without any problems. Thanks to her arrangements.
If any problem or question came up she was available and helped us. 
The apartment was well equipped, clean and is very close to UW as well as to several bus stops going downtown.
All in all we enjoyed our stay at Melissas apartment and would like to stay there again in the future"
3329962,33372031,2015-05-27,30868004,Celine,"It was a cute apartment with all the things I need! The bed was extremely comfortable and really helped me to get good sleep. The location is also great with lots of restaurants ten-minute walk away. It also closed to UW campus. 
 And Melissa is a great host. She always answer my question quickly. I had a chance to meet with her and she is so elegant!"
3329962,33756106,2015-05-31,34461163,Emmy,"I checked in really late, so I didn't get a chance to meet the host at all. However, she was very sweet and accommodating via texting, so that made me felt comfortable to know that I can always contact her for anything. There were shampoo, hand-soap, and towels...but no toothpaste, toothbrush, and body wash. Good thing there was a local drug store that was 5 minutes away, so I was able to buy them all without a problem. Bed was clean and everything was nicely organized/put. I didn't really like how the room felt a bit dead to me; there were dried up plants on the table instead of fresh plants. The carpet wasn't actually clean since there were dark gray stains at some areas of the room. I didn't really used the kitchen since my stay was only for 2 nights. Overall, it was decent living conditions for a 2 nights stay."
3329962,34473443,2015-06-08,5321860,Belinda,"Melissa was very accomodating and responsive--she answered questions quickly and was flexible. She gave us great food recommendations for the area and was generally helpful. The apartment was as pictured. It was well situated in the U District and convenient to UW and surrounding areas. The area is very walkable. The apartment was no frills, which was totally fine with us. Despite having blinds on the window, it did get very light early in the morning which made sleeping-in tough. The apartment was relatively quiet, but we woke up to garbage trucks on Sunday morning and the sound of cars on the roadway. All in all, the apartment met our needs for the weekend."
3329962,35072838,2015-06-15,29599301,Wang,"It was a really nice experience living in Melissa's apt for one week. I reserved this apt for my mother who came to attend my graduation commencement of UW. This apt has a small kitchen, a cute dinning room, a clean restroom and a warm bedroom. All stuff are clean and neat. It's just like still living in my home. "
3329962,35471654,2015-06-19,7943592,Shanthi,"Key was in a lock box as arranged so access was no problem even though we arrived on a night flight. Melissa made us feel very welcome, texting to make sure everything was alright.
This is a lovely little apartment, compact and cozy, with everything absolutely spotless, and plenty of drawer space to unpack into. Great location too - a few blocks off campus and to the bus stops. "
3329962,36180839,2015-06-26,31722040,Nazar,The host was very helpful when got to the apartment.
3329962,36690026,2015-06-30,34060900,Mark,"Melissa was not there for check-in, and there was much confusion. She told us we could just go there and check in, but we couldn't get in the room, so we left. When we got a few miles away, she told me someone would be there in ten minutes, so we went back. No one came for quite awhile. The whole check-in process took one and a half hours, and the person who met us was unapologetic and seemed annoyed. We had said we would have three guests, but there was only bedding for two. Again, we had to wait a significant amount of time for bedding. Then I found there were only two towels for three people. We just suffered through it, rather than go through the lengthy process again.  The carpet was dirty and all was shabbier than we expected. There was no air conditioning, so we had to open the windows, and the neighborhood was noisy, so we had trouble sleeping.  The bed was comfortable and felt clean. We will not stay with Melissa Yao again due to the lack of consideration for our needs. "
3329962,40093335,2015-07-28,5774711,David,"The apartment was basically as described. It's a well-kept student apartment, with worn but not shabby furniture and carpeting, and a very comfy bed. Fully-stocked might be a slight exaggeration re the kitchen, but there were adequate dishes etc. for meal-making and -eating at home. The bathroom window was either broken or installed in such a way that it couldn't be be fully closed, but that wasn't a problem. And we had no issues with noise from the street or other apartments.  We weren't able to access the apartment wifi, but didn't try very hard, as there was a free and open connection from a nearby hotel.

The location is outstanding. Super-close to the university (we were in town for a conference) with very easy, affordable mass transit (bus) to basically anywhere else one might want to go.

We never saw Melissa, but getting in and checking out was easy.

The place is nothing fancy, but fully met our needs!"
3329962,40661613,2015-08-01,2747142,Mark,"Our stay at Melissas unit was totally uncomplicated.
She was quick, very friendly and helpful with her answers.
We didn't get to see her, so I can't say anything else about her.
The unit itself was comfortable and definetly recommendable.
Only the Wifi didn't really work constantly good but it was free at least.
The neighborhood, was easy, safe and full of students. What is understood as it is in U-District. It's also not to far away from downtown. Max. 20 minutes by bus and also 20 minutes by (website hidden) is just 10 minutes away and you can rent a bike for a good price to explore seattle on pedals.
There is also a Trader Joe's and lot's of possibilities to grab a snack or some to drink around the unit.
At night it was not to quiet but if you're used to citylife, you'll easily deal with it."

3673011,16441675,2014-07-27,15559684,Philip,Andrew and Christine are awesome and very friendly and helpful. Their house is clean and beautiful. The room was very nice and perfect to stay there.

Welcoming. The room and the private bathroom were very clean. The neighbourgh is very nice with lots of bars and coffees. It really
was a good experience I would repeat and I do recommende staying at their place. "
3673011,16802170,2014-08-02,13378837,Trent,"Andrews place was really nice! The private entrance and bathroom was a big plus for me. I've already been staying in Seattle for a while when I rented out their room, so I really just wanted a place to sleep. It was nice getting to just walk into my own room. The hosts were very attentive and, even though we didn't communicate in person much, wanted to be sure I had a pleasant stay."

It was like being at home.the flat was very tidy and clean and the bed was very comfortable.just around the corner there are nice restaurants, movie theater and the train towards downtown or the airport.Andrew and Christine gave us very good tips what to do and where to go.we would always go back there"
3673011,17525378,2014-08-13,6819075,Stephanie,"Andrew and Christine's place was clean and comfortable. Andrew was fast to respond to emails and super responsive to my requests. There were lots of neighborhood restaurants within walking distance. We didn't have a car, but we were able to get around fine. The light rail is about a 10 min walk and the buses are located 2 blocks away. Highly recommend! "
3673011,18077636,2014-08-21,12992904,Paul,"Andrew and Christine's apartment is an ideal place to stay in the Seattle area.  The room is spotlessly clean, the bed is comfortable and having your own private entrance and bathroom is very convenient.

The local neighborhood is very safe and the residents are friendly. Downtown Columbia City is a couple blocks away and is upbeat and fun with several bars, restaurants and music venues.  An easy walk will take you to Lake Washington and several parks.

Public transportation is also handy with quick light rail and bus connections to downtown Seattle and Seatac airport.  

Andrew and Christine are super nice and made me feel at home and welcome right away.  They know the area well and were helpful in suggesting things to see.

3673011,18344393,2014-08-25,140552,Andreas,"W had a great stay! The place was very clean, the location is convenient and  Andrew was a perfect host! I can recommend this place to everyone who wants to spend a couple of days in Seattle! Although the place is not in the center of the city, the public transport connections are so convenient and the area around the place is very nice with small shops, restaurants and bars that this was a great place for us to spend some days in Seattle!
And, I mentioned it before, but I need to say this again, Andrew was a great host, I would come back to this place anytime again!
Thanks!!! "
3673011,18556853,2014-08-28,7364968,Amanda,"Hosts were super responsive and accommodating. The place was exactly as described - cute and quaint and had everything I needed. Great place for travelers who literally just need a nice place to sleep in between their site seeing. The neighborhood is adorable and filled with cute eateries. I took the bus every day that stopped a block away in front of Starbucks. Very convenient. Only downside was the noise of the complex which included playing children, handymen, and airplane noise overhead from the airport. Bring ear plugs if you are a light sleeper!"
3673011,18890892,2014-09-02,17272699,Char,"We stayed at Andrew & Christine's place for the Bumbershoot long weekend and arrived to a very warm welcome. The room was comfortable and very clean. The private entrance is a plus, especially if you're going to be coming home late after a day of exploring. The place is in a safe area and conveniently accessible to downtown Seattle by Light Rail. The neighbourhood has some great restaurants for breakfast and lunch. Two places we enjoyed down the street were Lottie's and Tutta Bella. 

Overall, we really enjoyed our stay! We would definitely stay with Andrew & Christine again."
3673011,19205480,2014-09-08,18483226,Jessie,"Andrew was a great host, and his space is perfect for someone looking to escape and rest between excursions in the city. Everything was as Andrew said it would be: nice, clean, and convenient. A brief walk away from the light rail station, bus stops, dining, and shops, Andrew's home provides easy access to anything you're looking to do in Seattle. He is also very accommodating with the other areas in his home and has no problem letting you use the kitchen or living room.

Overall, I had a great experience staying in Andrew's home. He and his friends and family were kind hosts to a first-time Seattle visitor, and their suggestions, tips, and general conversation were greatly appreciated! He really helped me feel at home and made my trip complete. "
3673011,19303996,2014-09-09,15937977,Pammie,"As soon as I saw him walk down those stairs and said 'welcome home' I thought wow. Then he sat down on the stairs and gazed into my eyes with his beautiful eyes and said, 'you weren't kidding about being from Mississippi'. 
Well that may or may not have happened but that's the way I chose to remember it and thank goodness for Freedom to Think What You Want.
Oh, goodness, I just realized I'm supposed to be reviewing the space and not Andrew. Sorry.
Ok, everything was as described, but I think a little downplayed. The en suite was awesome and Andrew has put a lot into making this space feel like a hotel room. Everything about the room was like being in a 3 star hotel room. As a woman, the bathroom was important to me and it passed my white glove test PLUS I loved the hotel bathroom feel. Complete with Ikea bath mat and all the toiletries you need. The closet also had 2 nice bathrobes and more toiletries and cleaning supplies. No personal items of Andrew's in the space. Cute little hotel like bedside lamps on beautiful antique like tables I wanted to take with me.
Ok, please walk down the alley to the lil shops in Columbia City. Geraldine's Counter is not open on Mondays, BUT there is a great Bakery on the opposite side of the street with hot breakfast items...so Yum. Plus some lil Anise cookies to yearn for. I also had dinner at the Ethiopian Restaurant on one of the side streets...Beef tibs with collard greens and homemade cottage cheese and Injera. Yum.
Ok, back to Andrew, Andrew if Christine ever messes up and you'd like to have a live in 45 year old country talking Mississippian perpetually leasing out the space, just call me. Christine, I'd also considering being a Sister Wife.  Big smile yawl.
Stay here guys, Andrew was an amazing host who will answer any questions you have and stay out of your way. I appreciate this place.
"
3673011,19887727,2014-09-20,8380163,Hyonah,"I was at the house for 5 days - Andrew was away on a trip so I never met him, but the check in process was seamless. The room was clean and well-kept. I loved having my own bathroom. Although he was out of town, Andrew made every effort to be reachable and had contingency plans to troubleshoot unexpected hiccups. The convenience was great - 5 minute walk to the beautiful and convenient light rail system. 15 minutes to downtown. The place is as advertised and I'd definitely consider staying there again when in town."
3673011,20291723,2014-09-27,10137591,Amy,"Andrew was friendly and helpful in helping me discover Seattle prior to going. He provided all the necessary information I needed if I needed help. The room and bathroom was clean and efficient.  The room off of the separate entrance provided privacy. The home was a 10 min walk from train station. It was also around the corner from a local movie theater, great coffee, and a block from a delicious bakery. I would definitely stay here  again when I return to Seattle."
3673011,20575698,2014-10-01,3407034,David,We had a great stay in Seattle. The room was clean and nice; comfortable bed and even with own bathroom. Andrew and Christine gave us ample amount of privacy. 
3673011,20976254,2014-10-08,21207940,Jia,Perfect little suite in cozy columbia city next to cafes and diners. Andrew and Christine were super communicative and had a lovely home with detailed touches. 
3673011,21232256,2014-10-13,887297,Raphael,"The room is as accurate as the photos. Quaint, clean, and welcoming. Andrew is a friendly, helpful and thoughtful host. Towels, bath soap, shampoo, moisturizer were provided, which we liked. We appreciate getting tips on where to go for hiking and places to eat. Definitely recommend La Medusa, a Sicilian restaurant a few blocks away. Andrew is a well-prepared host, from contacting us on instructions a week prior to trip and during the stay in answering any questions we might have."
3673011,21381926,2014-10-16,14256584,Wei,"Andrew's house is the same as shown in the photo. Private entrance is a plus and my boyfriend and I enjoyed the dinner in the yard once! The location is good with plenty of public transportation and a lot of restaurants and bars.He was very helpful and willing to give advice. As it was not my first time in Seattle, I was really familiar with the downtown. "
3673011,21641768,2014-10-20,22585993,Emmett,"Andrew and Christine made us feel right at home. We arrived and everything was ready! They were great hosts. Although, we spent the majority of our time exploring, they were extremely hospitable in every way. The location was comfortable and convenient with lots of amenities nearby. I highly recommend Andrew and Christine!"
3673011,21847337,2014-10-25,12038774,Bulent Ben,Andrew & his wife have been great hosts and I'd definitely recommend their place. They were super responsive to fix any issues that might come up and they make you feel welcome at their house. Their place is close to all Seattle attractions and I never had any problem finding street parking nearby... Great hosts! 
3673011,21993372,2014-10-27,21499085,Jake,I want to thank Andrew & Christine opened up their beautiful home to my girlfriend & i. The room/house was everything they said it would be & more.  Great location in Seattle that more should go too & overall good people to talk with!  Thanks again. 
3673011,22138064,2014-10-31,20230476,Michael,"Andrew and Christine were great hosts. They made sure we had everything we needed. The place was exactly as described. It was nice and clean and the bed was very comfortable. The area around the place is nice and you can easily get to downtown. 

We will stay at their place again soon and we are looking forward to it. It was our first stay with Airbnb and we couldn't have been happier."
3673011,22759213,2014-11-14,20230476,Michael,"We were happy to stay a second time at Andrew's and Christine's place. Again they provided us with guides to the city and all the information we needed. The room was clean and comfy as always. 
Both are very nice people, fun and easy to talk to. 
They were so nice to let us store a few things in between our stays. They made sure we had everything we needed.

The area as mentioned before is safe, the neighborhood is nice and many restaurants are in walking distance. You can get to downtown quickly by taking the link light rail.

If we ever get to Seattle again, we would definitely stay with Andrew and Christine again."
3673011,24089438,2014-12-19,11029005,April,"It was really easy to find Andrew and Christine's place! Access to the house was explained in great detail and we got in just fine. We basically used their place as a crash pad. Came in around 8 and left at 4am. It was great because there was a private entrance so I felt happy knowing we wouldn't disturb them. Although they said they wouldn't mind if we did. We got to meet them briefly when we got in and they were very very nice! Told us to make ourselves at home, we chatted a bit about our trip and they gave us some tips on where to eat.

They are just 2 blocks from a great row of bars and restaurants. 

The room was super clean and the bed was very comfortable. 

Their dog is very sweet too! 

Would definitely stay here again! Thanks guys :) "
3673011,25331324,2015-01-12,25423442,Vince,"I had a good 2-night stay while visiting friends in this great neighbourhood. The hosts were very welcoming and the room is just as described, no problems. Keep up the good work!"
3673011,25423443,2015-01-15,16759460,Gundars,"I enjoyed my stay for one night and was in and out and so just met Christine, a delightful and very helpful person.  The location is great, adjacent to the main drag of Columbia City, three blocks from my favorite live music venue, The Royal Room, and a short stroll to the light rail.  I will be visiting them again for sure"
3673011,25830289,2015-01-26,10370285,Leslie,"Super-easy check-in (even though we had pre-arranged a very late arrival), separate entrance, very clean and comfortable ensuite room. Room and bathroom is a bit small, but I've stayed in way smaller (and not nearly as immaculate!) in NYC.  :)  
We didn't get a chance to interact much with Andrew & Christine but what we did, they were very kind and helpful. The neighborhood is cool, in a small-town kind of way with lots of shops and cafes/restaurants nearby. Parking is off-street but you can pull into the alley behind the house to unload/load. Convenient location, very close to the Seattle Sound Transit (rail). Would definitely recommend!"
3673011,25984434,2015-01-31,26164658,Olivia,"My boyfriend and I moved to Seattle from across the country, and needed a place to stay for few days until we got on our feet. Andrew and Christine's place was EXACTLY what we were looking for. The bed was really comfortable and we loved having our own bathroom, entrance, and key. The Japanese themed style and cleanliness were great added perks. They live in a great location: walking distance to downtown Columbia City- which has many good restaurants to check out- and a nice, safe location. Finding street parking was always easy too. Andrew and Christine also spent a very generous amount of time offering us insight about neighborhoods/housing/jobs in Seattle. They are an easy-going, friendly, and adorable couple with a sweet dog. We needed to add an additional last minute couple of nights, and they were so flexible. I highly recommend staying with them! This was a wonderful first airbnb experience, and we are very thankful for the time they spent with us."
3673011,26090999,2015-02-02,26956923,Davey,"If you're looking for a nice place to stay with great hosts in a nice part of the city, this is it. The room is exactly as pictured and you'll have all the privacy you'll want.
Great place with some great hosts who went beyond the call of duty to make us feel welcome."
3673011,27297448,2015-03-01,421467,Jessica,"I stayed at Andrew and Christine's for a 3 day business trip. After a long day of work I was pleased to come home to a quiet, comfortable setting. 
I met Andrew and Christine on my second day. They are so welcoming and extremely accommodating.
The neighborhood is very up and coming, with great coffee shops, bakeries and restaurants. I highly recommend staying at Andrew and Christine's. I will definitely be coming back. "
3673011,27594514,2015-03-08,21293525,Natalie,"Andrew is a very welcoming and kind host! The apartment was easy to find and in a nice area close to food, coffee, and transportation. I would love to have had more time to explore Columbia City. "
3673011,28445261,2015-03-23,21943332,Vanessa,"Andrew and his wife were excellent hosts. We didn't spend much time together on a busy weekend, but they were funny, charming and inviting. The space was very clean and thoughtful. As noted, It's a small space, but they've made good use of it. We love the neighborhood and you are just a block away from grest food, coffee,shops. The lake is close as well"
3673011,28704973,2015-03-29,25636211,Whitney,"First time using Airbnb and it was a great experience! Andrew and his wife were very welcoming and their dog was a sweetheart! They made great recommendations for eateries and activities in the area. The neighborhood was nice with a ice cream parlor, movie theater, bakery and brewery all within a 5 minute walk. The room was very nice and easy to access. You have your space when you want it and the owners are friendly for when you don't. The room was clean and was supplied with soaps, towels, robes and anything else you would expect from a hotel plus more. They even supplied is with a guide book and a map of the public transit. Never had trouble parking which was also a huge relief. I'd highly recommend this location as it surpassed everything we wanted from this experience.would definitely stay again!!"
3673011,29867717,2015-04-13,12266201,Shi,"We spent 3 nights in Andrew and Christine’s warm house. They are very friendly and nice host. We love the room, it’s very clean and neat with private bathroom and entrance. (It reminds us of the hostel in Tokyo, small but clean and thoughtful)  ) Having own key is also much easier to arrange your own time and don’t have to worry about disturb anyone. About 15 minutes drive to downtown and easy to find a place to park on the street. We highly recommend this place to stay !"
3673011,30297272,2015-04-20,26471593,Courtney,"This was my first airbnb experience and I absolutely loved it! 

The Hosts: I never met Andrew in person, but I met his wife, Christine, and she was incredibly helpful and well educated on the area. She gave us great directions and pointers/ideas of what to do in the area surrounding Safeco field and downtown. Andrew emailed me the day before we arrived with the code to the lock and his address. The house was extremely easy to find and we got right in and felt very comfortable. We were there late and left early, but we never heard them. They gave us our space, and were there when we needed them. Exactly what we wanted! 

Amenities: The bedroom and bathroom were perfect, very small, not quite what we expected, but it was perfect for us.  They updated the room with a very fun comforter which I loved! They allowed us access to their kitchen and they gave us our own private entrance. They had towels and a box full of things that we may have forgotten, the Tylenol came in handy. Thank you! 

Location: Literally perfect. Nice, cute residential area. walked  to a fun bar called Rookies which we loved. Had the best coffee at Empire cafe and an amazing breakfast at Gerdalines (Sp?).
It was an 8 minute ride to Safeco field for you Mariners fans, and it was about 15 to downtown and about a 10 minute walk from the Link (way of transportation) to their house, so it made getting to and from the touristy areas very easy. 

Overall, I couldn't have asked for a better place to stay. The price was a steal and the hosts were super helpful. The area was perfect and the way of transportation was extremely cheap (~2.50) and super quick and easy.

We would definitely stay with them again.

Sam and Courtney

3673011,31957371,2015-05-12,30421209,Ryan,"Andrew was incredibly nice and made us feel VERY welcomed...He provided many awesome recommendations, and the space was immaculate!  The neighborhood was a perfect place for us to begin our adventure in Seattle.  Would stay here again!"
3673011,32700865,2015-05-20,31487480,Will,"Andrew did all the right things to make us feel at home for the few days we were in Seattle.  The space was great, and he provided a lot of suggestions for what to do in the city before we even arrived.  The neighborhood was a perfect balance, in that it was close enough to everything we wanted to do but still in a quiet area.  This was my first time using airbnb, and I definitely see the value in using the site as a  way of making a smooth transition into a new place.  "
3673011,33436120,2015-05-28,27334632,Jesse,"Andrew and Christine were great hosts, very friendly and accommodating and lovely to talk too. The room is really awesome, has everything you need and is very comfortable. It was a very private space in a great location."
3673011,33922176,2015-06-02,31762922,Bohyun,"We enjoyed our stay in Andrew and Christine's beautiful home. The neighborhood was quiet and friendly as described. The bus station was near home and the link train station was not far either. We had a good time in their backyard right in front of the guests' private entrance. The room was very clean and organized. If you are looking for a quiet and cozy place for a reasonable price in Seattle, stay in Andrew and Christine's place!"
3673011,34954099,2015-06-14,1552491,Elizabeth,Andrew and Christina were very welcoming.  The best part for us was the location very near the hip commercial district of Rainier Av in Columbia City.  Although the room was small it was very clean and well-supplied and the access to common areas made up for the size.  We appreciated the use of the kitchen and especially the patio where we were able to entertain a small group of friends one evening.  The bed is low to the floor but comfortable.
3673011,35371374,2015-06-18,27950534,Ali,I had a awesome time during my stay in Columbia city! The room was great. The room was spot on with the pictures provided by Andrew. I felt very welcomed at his place. Its a friendly city and Andrew was a friendly host. I had an incredible stay. 
3673011,36868336,2015-07-02,20638076,Jack,"Only my second stay using Air BnB but I am confident in saying this one is a real gem of a find!

The room and attached bathroom were immaculately clean, light and the bed very comfortable. There was ample room for storage and the additional toiletries provided (although not used) were a thoughtful additional touch...

...which leads me to the hosts. Andrew and Christine are sincerely some of the nicest people I have ever met in my 10+ years of travelling. From the first welcome both were very happy to share information on the city and the immediate area as well as their home and free time. It was really nice to meet them, their friends and Kiko (their dog), who had a lovely character. 

Downtown is easily accessible by public transport, less than 5 mins walk away and a 10 minute ride thereafter, but the unique joy was the immediate area around the accommodation. Less than 1-3 minutes walk from the house are many restaurants, a cinema, micro-brewery, butcher, baker, ice cream parlour with retro arcade and mini mart. All very friendly and most important to me as a horrible foreigner, a nice slice of 'local'.

I can't recommend enough, both Andrew, Christine and their top notch accommodation. I only wished I had the money and time to be there longer. Congratulations to any future user!"
3673011,39169098,2015-07-21,20901231,Beth,"Andrew and Christine were great!  Super sweet couple who made sure I had everything I needed and even offered to help with grocery shopping.  The room and bathroom are definitely on the small side, but totally fine for one person, and was really well maintained and stocked (and came with chocolate!).  Columbia City is a great neighborhood with lots of option to get to the city and the apartment is a two minute walk to restaurants, coffee shops, yoga, gym, bars and the cutest movie theater you've ever seen.  My only regret is being so busy and not being able to hang with the Andrew and Christine more! "
3673011,39912194,2015-07-27,10980493,Isabel,"Really enjoyed my stay while visiting Seattle! The room was clean and well kept, very comfortable place to be in. The hosts, Andrew and Christine, were helpful and super nice. Really recommend this place! Short walk to the Link Rail and other buses. "
3673011,43505117,2015-08-20,6806292,Bill,"Andrew is a welcoming, but non intrusive host. We had a wonderful two weeks in his small but tidy room with a private bathroom. We also used the kitchen and living room which he made available to us. He also changed the sheets and towels part way thru our stay. The location is great. Columbia City in Seattle has great restaurants and is a short walk from the light rail that wisks you into several areas of, including downtown.
Highly recommended."
3673011,44440194,2015-08-26,38912537,Michele,"Andrew and Christine are great hosts! We were able to meet them both and their sweet dog kiko. The room is small but really cute. It was just what we needed because we were only there to sleep. We were too busy out and about exploring Seattle and the beautiful surrounding areas. The location was perfect with coffee shops, grocery store, restaurants, and a little shopping all within walking distance. Driving downtown took us only about 10/15 mins! The communication before and during the arrival was easy flowing and they accommodated us with everything we needed. Thank you so much Andrew and Christine! We will be back again! "
3673011,45090234,2015-08-31,37175948,Yvonne,"This was my first time using Airbnb and we had a wonderful time staying at Andrew’s place. He replies his messages very quickly and was very helpful. Both Andrew and Christine were very easy to talk with and Kiko was such a friendly and sweet dog. The description for this room was very accurate. The room is small but very cozy, clean and comfortable. The neighborhood was a nice quite neighborhood and it was a quick drive to downtown. I highly recommend this room.  :) "
3673011,47489715,2015-09-19,5905955,Teresa,"Andrew's place was perfectly located for my purposes and is just a half block from a cool neighborhood area with great places to eat, hear live music, get coffee & breakfast, shop for gifts or just browse.  The room was private, quiet and clean with nice modern decor and I was welcome to use the kitchen to make tea.  I didn't meet my hosts, but they were easy to communicate with and responded immediately to my messages.    I was welcomed with a huge chocolate bar placed on my stack of towels. "
3673011,49492604,2015-10-04,34610619,Jessi,"Staying at Andrew's place was really great and convenient. I stayed with a partner and the room was more than adequate. The best part, honestly was the proximity to the light rail and the Columbia City shopping district on Rainier Avenue. It was our first time in Seattle, so having this great place as a home base was fantastic. Andrew was more than accommodating. We needed to keep our luggage somewhere after checking out since our flight was later that night. Andrew was more than happy to let us keep our luggage upstairs in his living room while we walked around the city for the day waiting our plane. Definitely recommend. "
3673011,49764782,2015-10-06,10923651,Whitney,Very nice home and lovely neighborhood. Andrew was very welcoming. 
3673011,50871582,2015-10-15,45168561,Jay,"Andrew and Christine were very welcoming and made us feel at home. Although our schedules did not cross frequently, they were both quite friendly when we ran into them. The space matches the listing and is in a great neighborhood and close to bus and rail. I would definitely recommend!"
3673011,51299980,2015-10-19,8749956,Claire,This was perfect for my needs -- a quiet place in a great neighborhood.  Thanks for the hospitality.
3673011,52320905,2015-10-28,35174806,Judie,"Wonderful experience for our first Airbnb! Great location, close to shops, restaurants and the light rail. Andrew was a terrific host and made us feel like we were relatives visiting from out of town. An added plus was getting to play fetch with Kiko!"
3673011,53716143,2015-11-11,6759946,Heather,"Andrew & Christine were both very friendly hosts, providing us with recommendations around Seattle (check out The Crumpet Shop!) Finding the house was an easy walk from the Columbia City Station (light rail). We relied on the Rail for transportation from the airport, to the house, and then on to the downtown area, and it worked out great. The neighborhood around Andrew & Christine's was cute, with a little main street with places to eat and a few shops. The room was clean and we were greeted by some Seattle made chocolate, which was nice after a flight. The room is underneath the main living space which has hardwood floors, so you can hear quite a bit above you, but it was quiet at night for sleeping. The mattress felt more like a futon which we didn't find comfortable, so that part was a bummer. There is a cute outdoor table and chairs set on the patio but we couldn't take advantage of it in the rain. Overall, good location for using the Light Rail between the airport and downtown. Cute neighborhood, clean room, friendly hosts and hilarious dog."
3673011,55206030,2015-11-29,7788044,Emily,Andrew and Christine's place was perfect for a long weekend trip - clean and comfortable. Thanks for being such great hosts!
7363727,41902814,2015-08-09,3192267,Manuel,Helen was just great! Warm welcome with anything you need. Beautiful remade basement makes the stay very comfortable. Helen even provided freshly baked cookies and fruits for breakfast. I can recommend this place for your stay in Seattle. Swimming in Wahington Lake just 5 min. walk and car drive to DT Seattle is just about 10 min.  
7363727,42314220,2015-08-12,2946496,M Cooke,"Lovely home in a lovely part of Seattle. Less than 10 minutes from the light rail system (all downhill) and less than 10 minutes from a quaint coffee/food establishment. The accommodations were perfect; bedroom, large sitting room with TV and bathroom/shower at the top of the stairs.  Helen was an exceptional host, very friendly and open. The rooms were exactly as pictured and I felt at home.  WIFI available if you needed it. I would absolutely stay there again and I highly recommend! "
7363727,42756203,2015-08-15,38785351,Alan,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Helen! She and her daughter Lydia were welcoming and kind, and happy to answer all of our Seattle questions. She even got out a map and helped us navigate were we were headed, as well as pointing out a few of her favorite parks and restaurants too, it was so helpful! Our private floor was beautiful, comfortable, and well taken care of, and our private bathroom was also immaculate and easily accessible. Her homes close proximity to the light rail was fantastic since we were traveling without a car, and we really enjoyed seeing all the gorgeous homes in the neighborhood on our walks to and from it. Perfect host, perfect accommodations, and perfect location! I will definitely want to stay there again next time I'm Seattle. Thanks so much Helen and Lydia! "
7363727,43111534,2015-08-17,1815923,Marta,"Helen and her family made my fiance and I feel very welcomed! They accommodated us when our flight was late on the day of our arrival and could not have been more hospitable throughout our stay. They always made sure we had everything we needed, whether it was coffee or directions. The accommodations are lovely and newly refurbished - very comfortable, quiet and clean. The area of Seattle that they live in is one of the best neighborhoods in the city and it was convenient to everything that we had planned during our weekend visit. I would not hesitate to stay with Helen again and will be sure to recommend her to anyone looking for accommodation in Seattle!"
7363727,43430263,2015-08-19,25451663,Joanne,"I felt most welcome. As a matter of fact, I felt right at home. The accomdations were exactly what I had seen in the photos on the website:  beautiful,  comfortable & super clean. If ever I'm in Seattle, I'd be happy to stay with Helen, Andrew & the girls."
7363727,43814419,2015-08-22,18802905,H,"Helen and her husband are very gracious and hospitality. This is cute single old-style house with a beautiful yard.  They provide perfect living facilities that let me feel at home. The location is nearby Lake Washington that is quiet with good view and easy to go out. This is my first time to Seattle, They help me order a car rental and make travel routes. Thanks for their help and all cares that make me enjoy good time."
7363727,44197202,2015-08-24,39824121,Judy,"Great location, sweet people, Seattle's beautiful...what more can you ask for."
7363727,44947416,2015-08-30,39762860,Tze Ken,"Splendid! The place has a spacious bedroom and private living area, WiFi is available and they even let you use their netflix. Toilet has heated floors, most toiletries are provided. The hosts were very friendly and helpful and even picked us up from the train station and took us to get dinner as our flight arrived at night."

"
7363727,46166739,2015-09-08,1705668,Laura,"Helen and her family are very warm and welcoming. They have made their AirBnB space also just as warm and welcoming with added details such as magazines and brochures of Seattle that are actually interesting and helpful to having local Seattle coffee in the mini-kitchen. The neighborhood was quite lovely, and just to the North on 31st is one of the best views of downtown. Hope to visit again soon! "
7363727,46443240,2015-09-10,10439905,Jemma,"We stayed in Helen's home for 2 nights and had a great experience. The room is well-appointed and has a cosy living area with a big TV and Netflix. It is downstairs in the basement so is a little dark - but as we were out during the day it didn't bother us. The bathroom upstairs is lovely and spotless. 

Helen and her family are very friendly and helpful. The neighbourhood is very pretty, just moments away from Lake Washington, which is great for a morning run. There are also a few little shops nearby - and importantly coffee places! 
"
7363727,46746130,2015-09-13,21218227,Candace,"I enjoyed my stay at this clean and comfortable home in Seattle. Helen and her family are very warm and hospitable. The room is nicely decorated, private, and large along with a living and breakfast area.  I will definitely stay here again next time I am in Seattle."
7363727,46994620,2015-09-14,5115005,Maaike,Helen and her husband are very Nice people who are making you feel comfortable. The appartment has everything you need! 
7363727,47185807,2015-09-16,42031065,Cheryl,"My husband and I were extremely pleased with Helen! She and her husband were incredibly sweet and accommodating. They were eager to help with directions, maps, recommendations and had much to share. Their home is absolutely lovely and the accommodations were nothing but the best. Whatever we asked, they honored! The neighborhood is beautiful and clean with incredible homes and a park nearby. Our favorite spot was Mio Posto -(thank you Helen for the great recommendation) what a great little treasure in your neighborhood. Just walking distance from the house and amazing food - best breakfast we've had in a long time! Helen and her husband helped guide us to all the local attractions, including the wineries which are only a quick 20 minute ride away. Their home has everything: beauty and location - easy to get almost anywhere from there! The home was clean, comfortable and quiet - the perfect place to celebrate our anniversary. "
7363727,47541126,2015-09-20,40680843,伟琍,Wonderful stay in Helen'house from Sept 15-18 in Seattle Very convenient to go outside from the house Nice family of the Helen' clean room hospitality of the whole family I really enjoy the stay in Helen'house If I have time I would stay at Helen'house again Cheng Chao from China on Sept 27
7363727,48430276,2015-09-26,42778889,Andrew,"We really enjoyed staying with Helen and Andrew. The accommodation was lovely - spacious, clean and comfortable and just as described. The location was a safe, leafy part of town, close to the lake. Our hosts gave us space to do our own thing when we wanted but were happy to help us make the most of our visit. It felt like staying with friends."
7363727,49146181,2015-10-01,4728068,Tom,"Helen is such a sweetheart. We made sure to let her know that we were on our way a day ahead. We got to the house and was greeted by Helen. She showed us around and let us know where the closest grocery store was and other places nearby in case we ever needed anything. She was warm and welcoming, that’s to say the least. I wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if I’m ever in Seattle. The neighborhood was safe and inviting, very quiet and peaceful. The streets are a bit narrow though, in case you are going to rent a gigantic SUV."
7363727,49650492,2015-10-05,42850062,Christian,We had such an incredible stay! The room was amazing and Helen was so friendly! She even gave us recommendations on places to see and eat!! I would recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle. 
7363727,50592335,2015-10-12,17214752,Barno,"Helen is a very nice lady and a great host! She and her family are thoughtful and considerate. I highly recommend this place!
Helen has a gorgeous and cozy house near Lake Washington not far from downtown Seattle. My bedroom had a comfortable bed and a private living room with a door to the streets. The bedroom and bathroom were clean, with clean towels, refrigerator, a coffee maker, snacks, and a TV.  She gave me restaurants and sightseeing recommendations. It was a very pleasant stay and I highly recommend it. "
7363727,51244978,2015-10-18,103782,Sonja,"Beautiful house in old, established neighborhood of stately homes. Extremely comfortable bed with super soft sheets in elegantly decorated bedroom with ample storage and places to hang clothes. Very cozy sitting room with several seating choices plus small table for dining. Great selection of tea and coffee, plus a few snacks -- microwave and refrigerator a nice touch. Gorgeous bathroom with heated floor, high pressure shower and quality soap/shampoo/conditioner. Host was easy and efficient with her communication. Overall this listing is an excellent value and I hope to stay here again!"
7363727,52125035,2015-10-26,45972118,Deanna,"Helen and her family were very welcoming, and the rooms were wonderful. Very quiet and comfortable setting in a beautiful area of Seattle. The heated floor in the bathroom was awesome and the bedroom and sitting area were exactly as listed. Helen made us feel very comfortable, even though this was our first experience with staying in a private home with Airbnb. Very close to the light rail station and everything we needed was within an easy walking distance. I would recommend this listing and hope to stay again next time we visit Seattle. "
7363727,53845039,2015-11-13,20449585,Michel,"The place was super cozy, clean and nice! Helen's family were super welcoming and nice! The kitty (LuLu) is so cute! Will definitely come back again! "

7363727,55548127,2015-12-01,8859082,William,"Helen was very friendly and helpful. The room  is really a suite; living room, bedroom and a little kitchenette area. Comfy bed. Neighborhood is very nice."
7363727,57107457,2015-12-21,51707480,Andy,"Helen and her family were very generous and friendly hosts.  They had no problem accommodating us and our near 2-year old child, and did everything they could to make us feel welcome.  The unit was clean, comfortable, and exactly as described.  We loved their classic Mt. Baker home. "
7363727,57674630,2015-12-28,23985518,Zhi,Really a nice place and kind host! Highly recommend it!
4324917,26944152,2015-02-22,177045,Anya,My daughter and I stayed in the Cozy Bedroom for 1 night at the very end of a college tour. Ralph met us when we arrived. He and his wife were friendly and welcoming. They were very helpful with everything we needed. The place was as described and we felt very comfortable.
4324917,30385016,2015-04-21,15642583,Ronny,"My wife and I stayed over 2 weeks at Ralph's place – and enjoyed very much being there. The place, the location, and the hosts are all great.

The “cozy bedroom” is indeed a very cozy bedroom and beyond. The room is big and has a warm and pleasant color scheme, 2 tables and a big closet with drawers and hangers. The room has 5 windows and gets ample natural light during the day with very good shades to control the wanted amount of brightness and privacy and enables a very pleasant outside view. Also enough lamps during the evening. The guests have a very convenient bathroom and a small kitchenette including kitchenware, refrigerator and microwave all for their sole use on the bedroom level and they can use the hosts’ washer and dryer.

The location is in upper Queen Anne - on a very calm and quiet street, yet very close to the Queen Anne central area which has many parks, nice landmarks, restaurants, coffee shops, shops and supermarkets (Safeway, Trader Joe’s, Bartell). The entire area is easily accessible on foot. The Seattle city center and down-town can be reached using a car (10 minutes) or local public transportation (20 minutes).

Last but not least – the hosts – Ralph and Susan are super kind and helpful. They are very attentive and sensitive to their guests’ needs and wishes. They gave us as much space and privacy as we wanted without lacking a bit in warmness and kindness.

Overall, we wholeheartedly recommend the ""Cozy bedroom on Queen Anne"" – in fact, I will be in Seattle again for a weekend in June and I have already booked the place for that visit! We are looking forward to meet Ralph and Susan and their great place again and again.
"
4324917,31460467,2015-05-05,8631573,Kate,Thank you for thinking of all of the details! I appreciated access to the mini-kitchen and to a private bathroom. The bed & room were very comfortable and well-furnished. The neighborhood was safe and very quiet at night. Thank you Ralph & Sue for providing a lovely private space in your home!
4324917,32696839,2015-05-20,23509216,Jaymes,"We really enjoy our stay in the cozy room, which is in walking distance to the Kerry Park. And there are quite a lot of bus stops nearby so that we can easily commute to and from the downtown. I highly recommend this room to anyone who want to come Seattle."
4324917,33558744,2015-05-29,20405829,Eric,"I stayed here during a business trip to Seattle. The room is spacious with plenty of natural light coming in. The neighbourhood is simply stunning with beautiful tree-lined streets, lovely homes, shops and boutiques, cafes (including an excellent ice cream parlour), and amazing panoramic views of Seattle within 2 minutes walk. A clean, safe, upscale area and quality hosts to welcome you. Highly recommended. "
4324917,33814991,2015-06-01,31909656,Hooi Koon,Everything was thoughtfully prepared and organised for us. Ralph and Susan were gracious and superb. We had a memorable stay. We highly recommend this to everybody! 
4324917,34458017,2015-06-08,19004949,Emily And Beau,"We had a wonderful time at Ralph and Susan's! The home was clean, quiet and private. The neighborhood was in a perfect location and the bed was comfy. Great to have the mini fridge and kitchen space. "
4324917,34889692,2015-06-13,12711550,WeiShan,"This place is located in a wonderful neighborhood, great view to whole Seattle in just a block away. Nice, huge, and clean room. Although I just saw Palph one time, he gave me all the info I need. Highly recommended.  "
4324917,35925334,2015-06-23,15642583,Ronny,"This was my 2nd stay w/ Ralph & Susan – and it was - as in the 1st time – an excellent stay. 
See my previous review from 4/2015 – it says it all, no reason to duplicate. I said then that I will come again, and I did. And I plan to return again. 
If you are visiting Seattle, especially Upper Queen Anne – I recommend staying in the “cozy bedroom”. You will enjoy it very much.
"
4324917,36764057,2015-07-01,20953339,Lisa,"Ralph and Susan went out of their way to be welcoming and make sure I was comfortable during my stay. They live in a beautiful and well-situated neighborhood that is lovely for walks at all times of the day! The accommodations are spacious and private with incredible amenities!! I'm looking forward to visiting Seattle again, and if possible, staying with the Levins."
4324917,37306951,2015-07-06,31484238,Yali,"Very clean, very close to the Kerry Park. Ralph and his wife are very friendly."
4324917,38499213,2015-07-16,2225860,Fariba,"The listing was exactly as stated, the location outstanding. The room very spacious and clean. Access to laundry a plus. Briefly met our host Ralph who was very helpful and welcoming."
4324917,39154609,2015-07-21,17779363,Therese,"This is a great place to stay.  The room is large, comfortable, and very clean.  It's an easy walk to lots of shops and restaurants in the Queen Anne area and not far from downtown Seattle.  I hope to return."
4324917,40198040,2015-07-29,5485267,Kerstin,"I stayed 1 week at the “bedroom” well, it was not only a bedroom, it is an apartment. Unfortunately I couldn’t meet the hosts as Susan and Ralph haven’t been at Seattle during my stay, but they did everything to make my stay perfect. Every little detail in the bedroom, the bathroom and the “kitchen” was perfect and the access to washer/dryer is also a thumbs up. It is close to bus stops and in the evening you should get yourself an ice-cream just around the corner and then have a short walk (approx. 5 minutes) down to Kerry Park and enjoy the amazing view. I would definitely stay again at the cozy bedroom on Queen Anne Hill."
4324917,40725794,2015-08-02,4483505,Carey,"Great experience!  Very quiet and interesting neighborhood high up over the city and water. Famous view of city and Rainier from Kerry park only 2 blocks down the hill from the house.

All the restaurants and coffee houses you need are nearby on Queen Ann Ave or around the corner.  Bed was comfortable and night was still cool for sleeping with a fan at the window even though we had 90 deg temperatures during the day. Pictures are accurate.

Though the hosts were not there for our one-day stay, the keys were easily accessible and Ralph sent us all the instructions we needed before-hand for the area and house.  Had the whole first floor. Everything was clean and prepared for our arrival.  Even plug-strips were provided for charging electronics.  Nice neighbors too. Very friendly neighborhood.  Great stop off point before a cruise. The ports are only 2.5 mi away and $11 by Yellow cab.  Arrival from airport is easy on the light rail to last stop downtown, but #2 or #13 bus can take quite some time and is hot in Summer.  May want to take a cab from Downtown instead. 

Easy bus ride to Space Needle but we decided to walk down the hill to the water trail, and got a real workout walking back up :-).
Overall, we had a very pleasant stay and the weather was beautiful!
"
4324917,41923754,2015-08-10,17088673,Analise,We had a nice time at Ralph's house. The photos of the place are very accurate. The home is very close to Kerry Park! Everything was clean and good directions were given.  Thanks Ralph!
4324917,42518087,2015-08-14,32511884,Rich,"Ralph couldn't be there during the time of our stay, but he kept in constant contact with us via Airbnb.  Our stay was VERY comfortable.  The room was sparkling clean and airy.  Down the hall we used the private laundry facilities, fridge, and microwave, and the whole place felt like home.  The only difficult part is climbing up and down the stairs to the side door - LOL - but we soon found out that stairs are ubiquitous in Seattle!  There is a 7-11 just a block away going north on Queen Anne Ave. N. and a Trader Joe's just a short distance farther for groceries.  The buses are close by and take you right downtown.  Incidentally, the bus drivers in Seattle had to be the friendliest I've ever seen!  We actually walked downtown and really enjoyed it, especially as there is a lovely lookout area just a short distance from Ralph's place that afforded a breathtaking view of the Seattle Needle and the various ports below.  I recommend staying here; the room was excellent and just as cozy as described."
4324917,43242430,2015-08-18,36312186,Loren,"Everything was exactly like pictured.  It was a lovely, clean and neat home with kitchen facilities.  I did not meet the owner, but he made me feel welcome by texting me soon after I arrived.  I did meet the neighbors and they were very nice and friendly.  Each morning I had coffee and breakfast at the cafe down the street.  The buses were easy to figure out and within a short walk.  I would recommend staying here when you're in Seattle."
4324917,44120257,2015-08-24,9629407,Missy,"Our stay with Ralph and Susan was great! The house is in a great location with next to the best view in Seattle. The bed and room were very comfortable. I loved their sustainable bath products. I only wish we had more time to talk to Susan and Ralph, they seem like very interesting people! Would definitely recommend staying here in Seattle. "
4324917,45424837,2015-09-02,15854785,Mitchell,"My wife and I stayed here for an entire week while searching for an apartment in the area, and we could not have asked for a better experience. Ralph not only greeted us at the beginning of our stay, but he checked in with us periodically to make sure all was well. Not only that, but he also provided us with some apartment leads in the area! Although the room is within Ralph's home, we received ample privacy and space. 

The room itself was exactly as pictured. It included a very comfortable queen bed, plenty of closet space, and two desk areas with a lot of natural light. We enjoyed having our own personal wash room as well as a mini fridge and quaint kitchenette area - quite convenient having those 'extra' amenities. A very clean, comfortable and hospitable experience, no doubt. "
4324917,46271039,2015-09-09,8236945,Margaret,Space was lovely and the location was ideal. Ralph and Karen were super helpful in getting me situated when I arrived. I'd stay there again in a heart beat. 
4324917,47043981,2015-09-15,36895226,Gail,"Despite my unexpectedly late arrival, Susan met me at the door and welcomed me to their guest quarters, which were exactly as pictured on the website. The room was perfectly clean and thoughtfully appointed with s desk, table, chest of drawers, and a bookshelf stocked with something for every reading taste, along with a reading light beside both the bed and the rocking chair... a real bonus for me. And they had left a stack of Seattle maps and brochures on the desk, to help with my sightseeing itinerary. They kindly accommodated my request for an iron and ironing board. The bathroom was stocked with plenty of towels and toiletries, and reserved for my private use. It was great to have a little fridge and a few dishes for breakfasts before I went out on the town, and although I never needed it there were washer/dryer facilities available as well. The layout of the house allowed me to come and go independently, maintaining the privacy of both the hosts and myself. I saw Ralph and Susan rarely, but every encounter was friendly, open and comfortable. The neighborhood was pretty and felt safe, as I walked back and forth to Queen Anne Avenue and down to Kerry Park many times. Uber serviced the area  nicely, and there was also nearby bus service. The only downside was the unfortunate loss of their wireless internet service on my first day... but that can happen anywhere, any time. All in all, a very pleasant and satisfactory visit for my  first experience with Airbnb."
4324917,49636712,2015-10-05,42716390,Dustin,"Thank you for a great stay. Ralph and Suan are great hosts. We had a great time and the space was perfect! We weren't able to get too much interaction, but they left great instructions and details in the house for us."
4324917,50362133,2015-10-11,176579,Elodie,"The room is very nice and spacious. We loved the quality of the bed and the other amenities: private bathroom, laundry corner, fridge and coffee maker. Ralph and his wife are very welcoming and responsive. They made sure we had everything and really helped us with our concerns and questions. 

We would definitely stay there again if we need to stay again in Queen Anne. The location is great! "
4324917,50558701,2015-10-12,25399223,Wayne,"The room is mostly as advertised.  My only issue is that the bedroom and bathroom are not in the same room which would be my preference.  You have to walk down a hallway, past an office to get to the bathroom."
4324917,50640116,2015-10-13,4757940,Wendy,Ralph was very flexible about my arrival time. He gave me local information and was very helpful. The room is extremely comfortable and private. I had an excellent experience! I hope to return in the future!
4324917,52063965,2015-10-26,16886819,Toni,"Ralph and Susan's place was great. the room was very large, with three windows, two tables, chairs, big closet. and a very comfortable bed. Down the hall was a bathroom and kitchenette. It was only a block to a bus to downtown."
4324917,53952005,2015-11-15,20452975,Søren,"I stayed two weeks in November and can only add to the general praise. The room is pleasant and the private bathroom and kitchenette is a luxury. Ralph and Susan are as friendly and helpful as one could only wish for. The neighborhood is great, with lots of places to eat a variety of foods,buy groceries, homemade ice-cream, chocolate and lots more. The bus downtown is close by and takes about 20 minutes. All in all, I can only recommend unreservedly."
4324917,54860728,2015-11-25,42773444,Thor,Terrific spot - I would definitely stay here again.  The accommodations are just as described and Ralph made communication and check-in very simple.  
4324917,55916937,2015-12-07,37440287,Maria,Super lovely stay in Seattle! The house was cozy and we had everything we needed during our work trip. Thanks for having tea and cocoa available during the rainy weather!
7698721,47214042,2015-09-16,43511076,Matteo,"Unfortunately I did not manage to get to Seattle because I had issues with my VISA to enter the USA, but Barbara was very supportive and understanding. 
"
5893969,32998397,2015-05-24,31830689,Jasmine,"This was a wonderful apartment perfectly located in quirky Fremont just a short drive from downtown. Only thing to note is the upstairs neighbour's dog could be noisy at times,  but other than that it is a fantastic place to stay."
5893969,34319173,2015-06-07,30862301,Casey,"Had great communication with host and she was easy to accommodate when our plans changed. Walking distance to the Fremont Troll was cool, and a very easy distance from Gas Works Park and many other very cool places!"
5893969,39770723,2015-07-26,15181674,Jessica,Melissa was a great host! The place was just as she described and getting the key and accessing the apartment went smoothly. And she was always responsive. We had a great stay!
5893969,45934167,2015-09-07,16157251,Nate,"Central to everything I needed. Clean, spacious and well decorated unit. Door lock sticks a little but nothing but good memories for this trip. There is a dog upstairs that barks at random times but the owner does a good job keeping it under control. Melissa was accommodating and responsive. Highly recommend. "
5893969,55274547,2015-11-29,49197346,Andrew,Really enjoyed our stay here. Fremont is a great area that's close to everywhere you could possibly want to go in Seattle. Melissa was very generous and even left us a bottle of wine for our trip. Would stay here again!
5957039,30347174,2015-04-20,8525330,Jen,"Short but sweet Seattle stay - great location for train & plane, plus terrific food & coffee all around! Quiet building & great view of rooftops & the water. "
5957039,31384284,2015-05-04,23069954,Tom,"We had a fantastic time staying in Elle's apartment. The location couldn't have been better, and we were provided with a great list of restaurants, coffee shops and attractions for us to visit during our time in Seattle. The apartment was comfortable and quirky, and the view of the waterfront were awesome. We highly recommend and would definitely stay again"
5957039,32288753,2015-05-16,32923341,Joel,"Nice little unit, comfy futon bed, great location. A bit noisy, as any downtown unit would be. But closing the window at bedtime helped a lot. Compared to downtown hotels, a real bargain. And Elle is a delight. "
5957039,32605311,2015-05-19,32300847,Aaron,"Elle made my wife and I feel welcome from the beginning, providing a great list of local restaurants and activities. Her place is clean and well located downtown near the waterfront. I will seek out Elle's place if I am ever in town again. Both Elle and her apartment are highly recommended! This was our first airbnb experience and we will definitely be trying it again."
5957039,32783049,2015-05-21,25612582,Helen,"Staying at Elle's was a pleasure. She is a communicative and gracious host - and judging from her place she's had lots of interesting adventures all over the world. The apartment is small, as you'd expect from a studio, but it feels surprisingly spacious and it's beautifully decorated. The pictures don't do it justice at all. The location is perfect - right in downtown, walking distance from many of Seattle's attractions as well as transport links. I'd definitely recommend it as your base in the city. "
5957039,33125489,2015-05-25,1037527,Judith,We had a great stay at Elle's place! It was very clean and cozy and in a perfect location to explore the city. We loved her recommendations for bars and restaurants in the neighborhood! Thanks Elle
5957039,33856227,2015-06-01,33871088,Paulo,Everything Elle described was on point and she was extremely accommodating given the time of my arrival. She left clear instructions and even provided some recommendations on places to visit in the neighborhood. The place was very quaint and cozy and had everything I needed for my stay. 
5957039,34952209,2015-06-14,28777706,Erica,"I stayed in Seattle for two days as part of my honeymoon then went on to Alaska for the rest. My husband and I had never been to the west coast before and really enjoyed ourselves! This apartment had a wonderful view of the bay and a great location. It was not a huge apartment but that's all we needed. My only criticism was that some of the neighbors were smoking even though there were signs all over the building that said no smoking. However, Elle had everything well organized and had left our key for us at the coffee shop below the apartment. She also left a wonderful list of places to visit in Seattle which my Husband and I went and explored. Overall a very nice experience :)"
5957039,37372977,2015-07-06,13393926,Terria,"Location was great. You can walk to the ferries, metro, and the wharf. Apartment was cute, looks exactly how described. "
5957039,39089895,2015-07-20,37518739,Shelly,"This was my first Airbnb stay and it was great! The apartment was exactly as Elle described. The location was fantastic-easy walking distance to Pike Place Market, transport, charming neighborhood with lots of choice for coffee, bars and restaurants. I had a late flight in but Elle had made easy arrangements for me to pick up the key. She also had provided excellent recommendations plus how to get to and from the airport. She made sure I had her contact details too should I need. I loved the studio, the location. I'd definitely return! "
5957039,40779761,2015-08-02,37327707,Ashley,"The listing was exactly as she described it. It was a very central location, which was nice. The apartment had everything we needed, except for an iron, which we ended up borrowing from a nice man at a hotel. I would recommend this place to friends or family."
5957039,41250599,2015-08-05,38588420,Julia,"Elle was a friendly, helpful and reliable host! She provided us with useful information about check in and exploring the city. She quickly responded to messages and answered all of our questions. The perfect hostess for the start of our trip! Her place was nice and cozy and gave us a glimpse of a great city and groovy owner! She made our trip to Seattle a beautiful adventure and we would always come back to Cherry and Elle! So sad we didn't get the chance to meet her in person!!!"
5957039,42288055,2015-08-12,7019737,Jen,"Elle's apartment is located in a fantastic location in Seattle. Everything's only a couple of minutes away by foot, be it Pike's or Westlake (where the major shopping district is). Her place is also near well connected bus stops that'll take you up to University District or Fremont. Also love how cosy and comfortable her apartment is! Thanks for letting us stay at your apartment!"
5957039,46885752,2015-09-14,316263,Jeremy,"Elle's apartment was easily accessible via public transit (literally a stone's throw from the Courtyard Marriott) and quite spacious for a studio. While she was away for the week of my stay, she put me in touch with a local friend in Seattle should anything come up. The communication leading up to my arrival was very thorough, and I'm happy to say the visit went smoothly. Elle's restaurant and coffee shop recommendations were also on point and much appreciated!"
4241862,21325179,2014-10-14,948327,Paulina & Gideon,"Jennie Kay went out of her way to make us feel comfortable. We had muffins, apples, bananas, muesli bars waiting for us and she created a fantastic personalised list of things to do. She provided an info folder and tonnes of local menus. Communication was great. The apartment itself is one in a two-storey building, which is located on a steep slope perched in what felt like a rainforest, but across the road from the freeway. One side of the ride is residential, the other side looks over the freeway. It's about a 15min walk to the bars and restaurants of Capital Hill and 30mins to downtown. The apartment has a vintage/grunge vibe and looks the same as in the pics. There was no wifi available, but Jennie Kay offered multiple solutions."
4241862,21680850,2014-10-21,22220168,Ryne,Everything was ready to go. She had a detailed booklet with local sites and information about what we could use in the room. It was very helpful. 
4241862,22044634,2014-10-28,22644133,Keehnan,"Perfect. Exactly as described, somehow both in the city and nestled in the woods. Private and quiet, warm and totally welcoming. 

For those feeling lazy (me), it's a $5 cab to both the center of Capitol Hill and to the heart of Downtown. 

Jennie stocked the apartment with food and tea and coffee and anything I could have needed, w/ the closest grocery store just up the hill on Broadway. Laundry in the basement was an added bonus. Would absolutely stay again. "
4241862,22325953,2014-11-03,16795264,Victoria,"Jennie was awesome! Her little apartment was a great place for my husband and I to stay for an extended weekend. No TV, which we already knew, and the internet never worked for us, but honestly, it was great to get away from those things. We played the board games provided and sat on the patio. We walked to bars and breakfast spots, as well as bus stops. We also used Uber, which was usually only about a $7-9 ride to wherever we needed to go. She always responded quickly to questions and was really helpful! As she notes, the freeway is really close, so it was loud, but we got used to it quickly."
4241862,22669087,2014-11-11,22965638,Ferris,Jennie is an awesome host. I had a great time during my stay in Seattle. The location was amazing and provided a great view of the city. Very short and cheap Lyft rides to Cap Hill where good restaurants and nightlife are located. 
4241862,22872457,2014-11-16,7650677,Justin,Great place great host!
4241862,23777560,2014-12-09,8679613,Kya,"Jennie Kay's space was lovely & full of charming touches! Breakfast foods were kindly provided, communication was great, and it was wonderful to be close to the vibrant Capitol Hill district! We would be happy to return. "
4241862,23870983,2014-12-13,11635199,Brandi,We enjoyed our stay at Jennie Kay's immensely. The apartment was even more adorable then described and in a great location. Jennie is a wonderful and thoughtful host. I only wish we could have extended the trip to stay longer. Highly recommend!
4241862,24798419,2015-01-02,24645147,Diana,"Our original Airbnb reservations fell through in the very last moment when our first host canceled. I started to get a little worried, as it was New Year's Eve, but Jennie Kay was very accommodating and able to get her place ready for us with very little notice. We didn't have a chance to meet, but she was a gracious host and easy to connect with when we had any questions. I appreciated the small treats she left for us, and her funky little apartment."
4241862,25237642,2015-01-10,18085,Vivian,"This place was a great home base for the business we had in the area. Jeannie has put an incredible amount of detail into the amazing apartment  vintage decor! She even made sure we had some breakfast foods for our time. The only downside was that we stayed for 5 nights, and the proximity to the freeway (and its noise) was less than ideal and something to think about if you are planning staying that long. "
4241862,25565337,2015-01-19,662294,Molly,"Jennie's place is sweet (just as pictured). The location is so convenient, parking was easy and communication with Jennie was good."
4241862,26140465,2015-02-04,8539062,Robert,"I had a great time in Seattle and a great time at Jennie Kay's place. It is cozy, well located, warm, and quiet, with ample parking. The deck is charming. Oh the freeway is nearby and I heard it constantly but chose to think of the sound as being more like the sound a river makes.  Jennie Kay is a great hostess. "
4241862,26630479,2015-02-16,10552358,Jilli,"I was so pleased with our experience! Jennie left us breakfast in the kitchen, linens and toiletry essentials in the bathroom and a living room full of games and books for entertainment! The location is a 30 min walk to downtown Seattle, and a 10 minute walk up to the center of Capital Hill. Great location and an inviting apartment! We had a wonderful experience staying here. "
4241862,27008006,2015-02-23,21788547,Kimberly,"Jennie's apartment was cute, cozy and met my needs. I absolutely loved the quirky kitschy little knock knacks and vintage charm the place had.  It was also very warm, plenty of linens and blankets and necessities were available. My boyfriend and I stayed there for the weekend. It was close to lots of shops & restaurants and very easy to get to. 

I read other reviews about the noise of the highway, but to me it was just white noise and hardly noticeable.

The free parking is a bonus! I definitely recommend anyone who has a vehicle to park their car for he day and take public transportation or uber. 

I enjoyed my stay very much, Jennie is a generous & kind host."
4241862,27317219,2015-03-02,20112316,Doug,"Jennie communicated really well and the place was exactly as described and better set up than expected. The place was extremely ready and more than adequate for what we needed.

The groceries were appreciated, even if we didn't use them all. The efforts made to make our trip comfortable were over the top!

Thanks again for making Seattle so welcoming!"
4241862,27821611,2015-03-12,23595720,Matt,"After a slight snafu with a cancelled reservation, I reached out to Jennie last minute. she was absolutely accommodating for myself and my friend and couldn't have asked for a better situation! She maintained constant contact with me before the reservation to make sure all was accounted for and response was very fast. The place is exactly as pictured and described, plenty of free parking, very accessible to all of Seattle. You are right on the highway, but as described by others it's mostly white noise. Do keep in mind that the lower tenants are 420 friendly, so you may get some strong smells in the hallway (which wasn't an issue for me, but I can imagine it could for others). Thank you Jennie!"
4241862,28492900,2015-03-24,12796559,Kim,"Jennie Kay was a great hostess.  She was very friendly and went out of her way ensure we had a great trip.  The apartment had everything we needed to make for a comfortable stay.

The apartment was very nicely decorated and certainly was not lacking in vintage charm.  The location was great, especially if you like to walk.  The apartment is off the drag by a little bit which allows it to be quieter and also allows for some amazing views."
4241862,28537249,2015-03-25,113247,Karmin,"Jennie Kay is an accommodating and gracious host!  She seems genuinely concerned that your stay is fantastic.  She left organic fruits and milks and such, making for extra treats, and bath salts for the amazing tub.  The apartment and bed are super comfortable.  I never heard the neighbors, and while the noise from I-5 is a constant stream, I think it depends on your sensitivity whether that will be an issue.  The location is really central and easy to get where you need to go, and parking was no problem at all.  Great spot!"
4241862,28883682,2015-03-31,16478649,Danielle,"Very gracious host, had breakfast foods available and quick to respond to questions.  Small but clean space in a convenient area.  Walking distance to downtown and Capitol Hill.  Close proximity to highway can be a little noisy."
4241862,29417370,2015-04-07,18020178,Jessica,My boyfriend and I rented this apartment so we could sightsee in Seattle and we had a wonderful time. The place was exactly as described and it was perfectly situated for sightseeing and nightlife. Everything was clean and comfortable and Jennie Kay was sweet enough to have milk and breakfast staples in the refrigerator for us when we arrived. We had a fantastic time and would definitely rent the place again next time were headed to Seattle. 
4241862,29844015,2015-04-13,1781888,Karina,"Staying at Jennie's apt was great. For us, we felt right at home and the proximity to the freeway was easily accustomed to.  Jennie made sure all our questions were answered and that the apt was ready for us. She was very responsive and made communicating with her very easy. We had no concerns during our stay and would definitely return."
4241862,35634635,2015-06-21,18655414,Ashley,"Jennie was super thorough and friendly! Great host, and the location is described quite well. Awesome and detailed guestbook. Very homey and lived in feel. There's a hammock on a cute porch, too. $10 Uber ride to get to Pike Place in morning traffic, $8 to get back with no traffic. Overall, a great stay!"
8047522,46212197,2015-09-08,13346664,Jose,"Andy was a great host! He did everything he could to make sure we had what we needed to feel at Home. He even made sure that the cable and TV were working before he left. He was easy to talk to and very responsive to any questions that came up.

There are two rooms with a total of three beds ( one bed fit two ) and there is a pull out bed downstairs. We were a group of 5 and we fit perfectly. There is only one shower so we had to play a lot of rock paper scissor to determine the order.

The location is great, we never felt far away from anything, but we still got to stay in a nice quiet neighborhood. 

Andy is a great guy and a great host, the place was exactly what I was looking for."
8047522,47200253,2015-09-16,42936508,David,"From our initial contact through to our stay and afterwards, Andy was very prompt and helpful on responding to our questions for our stay. Prior to our stay, Andy shared their own visitors guide to the greater Seattle area which was very helpful on their insights to the city which helped in our planning for our vacation. The townhouse was exactly as described and met our needs perfectly. The house was vey clean and well taken care of and made us feel at home while we stayed in Seattle. We had a rental car and so the private parking space that was part of this townhouse came in very handy. When we arrived, Andy had a personal note to us, a bottle of wine, and a bag of snacks, etc. to welcome us, this was a very nice touch that made us feel at home.

The townhouse is located in a great area and was nice and quiet. It was very convenient to both some of the out of the city things we did, but also was very close to the ""in city"" activities and various districts within the city we went to in trying restaurants. 

Andy was a great host and we have recommend his townhouse to our friends and family if they are in the Seattle area.  Andy, thank you for helping us have a great vacation in the Seattle area!"
8047522,48937693,2015-09-29,31613602,Darla,"No more hotels for me,  not when it is possible to be Andy's guest! I had 4 lovely days in Andy's ""Juries House"" with two dear friends. We were in Seattle for a conference and a reunion. The two bedroom craftsman was tastefully updated, impeccably clean, and elegantly appointed. Perfect for the three of us - space to be together and bedrooms when one needed a nap or to work on a presentation. 
The mattresses were firm and comfortable and the bedding was cozy. 
Andy was a responsive host throughout our stay, quick to answer any question: ""Where is a good place for late breakfast nearby?"" ""How do we turn on the gas fireplace? - the evening had turned chilli enough that we would enjoy."" Andy was always helpful.
We went daily to University of WA for a conference, and then usually downtown for meals. The location was great for both. We had a car,  but one day we took a bus downtown, easy access, and then UBER ""home"" at the end of the day (for only $13!).
I plan to stay with Andy in this unit or any of his properties whenever I am fortunate enough to travel to Seattle."
8047522,52107694,2015-10-26,2229930,Duke,"Andy was an incredible host from our initial e-mail up until leaving the residence. He gave me a bit of a deal due to the nature of my work, and I appreciate that very much. He also left us some wine and an incredible welcome package, very generous and welcoming. The house was immaculate, neat, and had basic needs covered all the way. I would suggest this house to any parties of 2-4 people who are looking for a comfortable home to call their own during their stay in Seattle! "
5261239,26654547,2015-02-16,5519725,Olivia,"Eric's house was right downtown and very close to everything. Thanks so much for the chance to visit, Eric!"
5261239,27697132,2015-03-09,18763872,Amy,"The apartment was easy to find and access.  It's in an area of town near lots of coffee shops and restaurants, and close to tourist activities and public transportation.  The pictures are accurate.  If you need a basic place to stay in a good location I would recommend this place."
5261239,27805644,2015-03-12,27788724,Delilah,"Eric's apartment was perfect for our visit! It is very close to shopping, restaurants, all the touristy attractions, & the monorail. The projector screen was great for downtime. The pictures are very accurate & it was clean. Very easy to find and get around. Eric worked with us and our schedule very well! I would recommend this place to anyone."
5261239,28234784,2015-03-20,12090368,Catherine,"My friends and I stayed at Eric's apartment and it was as exactly as the photos showed. Very centally located and Eric was accomadating. Check in and out went seamlessly.  I forgot my charger and he offered to mail it back to me, Thank you for your hospitality Eric!







"
5261239,28505463,2015-03-24,8700813,Patrick,As described.  Eric greeted us at the apartment on time - and then left us to it.  Apartment was great for easy access to Seattle needle - we also walked down to Fisherman's wharf.
5261239,28798660,2015-03-30,2874493,Kyle,"Great location. Spartan furnishings, smallish studio apartment, reasonably clean (very tidy, but a bit musty). We had a problem with the key to the apartment door not working -- like, not working *at all*-- but Eric offered to come try to fix it, and I expect that he will do so before the next guest arrives? On the whole we enjoyed our stay and felt that it was a good bargain. "
5261239,29884360,2015-04-13,6405366,Sudarshan,"Eric was a very good host. The location is great and walking distance from downtown and Pike place. The place is comfortable too. It is definitely worth staying at Eric's place for the weekend. He was very responsive and help us with late check in when our flights were delayed. With that aspect he is a 5/5 host. 

I guess with the amenities, if you were to be for a longer duration, the room can be slightly more prepped up given sometimes you would end up staying more indoors with rain in Seattle. With the in-house amenities I would give it a 4/5. All in all, a great stay!"
5261239,30454143,2015-04-22,23878047,Sommer,See previous review (we extended our stay).
5261239,30537689,2015-04-23,23878047,Sommer,"The location of this place is pretty spectacular. You are in the heart of downtown near the Seattle Center, Pike Place Market, and Olympic Sculpture Garden. We were able to walk everywhere, so there was no need for a car. 

The place itself had its downsides though. The lock to the apartment is old, making it VERY difficult to even get into the apartment. There is an art of wiggling and shaking the key around to unlock the door and just get into the place. Make sure that Eric shows you some tricks to get it to work, because the first time we did it, it took us 5 minutes just to get in and we were exhausted from a long day of walking around the city. Also, it wasn't the cleanest place either (there were unknown foods underneath the curtains and food crusted on the silverware), but we rarely spent time here for it to be a real issue. We were hoping to cook, which was a big reason why we chose an apartment over a shared room, but didn't really feel comfortable to do so (there were not a lot of cooking supplies anyways). If you don't plan on spending much time in the apartment and just want to be super close to everything the price of the place is extremely reasonable though. 

Overall, like I said, the location really beats anything else we found, even with some of the issues. Eric was very responsive to if we had any questions. We also last minute requested an extra night and he was very gracious to help us out. "
5261239,31365024,2015-05-04,29109939,Tasha,The apartment was actually for my dad. And from what he told me was the location was perfect! Centrally located with tons to do near by. The apartment itself was a bit on the smaller side but unless your planning on staying in the whole time the location makes up for the room. Being that the apt was actually for my dad I still was the one communicating with Eric and everything went very smooth...! He replied to any concerns either of us had very quickly. 
5261239,32532763,2015-05-19,30949202,Heather,"Perfect location!! Walking distance to everything you want to see in Downtown Seattle!! Eric was always prompt in his response via text- very polite, but not too social- which is fine :)
The downside to this place is that it is not very nice, not cluttered- but pretty dingy. Bed was okay. It definitely sags to the middle- but after walking around all day we were exhausted and slept hard! The shower was a bit dirty- but hot water and pressure was good. 
If you are looking for simply a place to crash at night, and don't mind being in a bit of a shabby apt then this place is great! We didn't mind- it was an adventure! Kitchen is tiny and not much room or utensils to cook- so we ate all of our meals around town. There is a convenient store one block away which was very helpful! 
100 inch projector style screen tv was fun to watch movies on late at night- but volume was pretty low.  There isn't a closet to hang clothes or dresser to put anything away- so we used the smaller couch as a storage place for our suitcase and belongings. 

All in all- it was a good experience. Perhaps a little pricey for what it actually was- but I have noticed the price has been significantly reduced since our stay. 
Again- if location is a priority- and you are low maintenance- then this place is perfect for you! "
5261239,33797929,2015-06-01,3777798,Lee,"Easy checkin and checkout
Quick response to all correspondences
Sort of a dark, dingy feel to the place 
Bathroom, shower was a bit dirty
Excellent location"
5261239,34949797,2015-06-14,30662706,Tanya,"The neighborhood and location were fine and Eric was friendly and communicative. The listing however, was not what we expected. It is on the 3rd floor and is a pretty small studio that felt cramped and dark. The carpets were also wet from a cleansing which left a cloying sweet smell to the place. Eric explained that this had to do with the previous tenant making a mess. We didn't feel comfortable sitting on anything or touching anything. "
5261239,35644005,2015-06-21,27811061,Adam,"Very good location, and Eric was a great, flexible host. It's an older, pretty Spartan building, but the necessities are there, and we spent most of our time roaming the city anyway. It suited our needs perfectly."
5261239,35944628,2015-06-23,34048938,Jennifer,"Eric was prompt and brief. Key problem was addressed and easy to handle. The description is accurate. Small and cramped and a very small kitchen but we came for the great location. Walking distance to the market adm fun shops and restaurants. Space needle, if you want it, is literally a
Short walk. Entertainment system a bit glitchy. recommemd great Vietnamese place around the corner - greenleaf - in a labor temple. Very cool and cozy bar. Nice staff. Overall a great deal for the location. "
5261239,36210439,2015-06-26,4507843,Aaron,"Great communication, needed a blow dryer and Eric delivered!"
5261239,37075235,2015-07-04,34872620,Sari,"Eric was super helpful and available. We needed some concert tickets delivered and he made it really easy to get them delivered before our stay in Seattle. Eric's spot was located in a really cool area that was nice and fun to walk around. Great restaurants and bars right nearby. If you're looking to have a spot to crash at and not really hang out at, Eric's place is great. Could have been a little bit cleaner/organized, but altogether had a great stay."
5261239,37581758,2015-07-08,3916172,Mimi,"Check in & out were simple. The 3 floor walk up was not an issue. I was surprised at how quiet the building was. The location really made our vacation - we were close to all the museums and parking was not a problem. We visited during an unseasonable hot spell and the a/c unit treated us well. However,  the bed was not very comfortable and the kitchen was sparse.  We didn't spend much time in the apt apart from sleeping. "
5261239,38646081,2015-07-17,37072482,Mie,"Eric responds  immediately.
The room was very close to Space Needle.  It was quite at night, but old."
5261239,38854454,2015-07-19,19756597,Dana,"I booked Eric's space for my parents and it was perfect! The location is ideal for downtown. 5 min walk from Space Needle. Great bed, huge tv, clean and spacious. Stay here if you are doing the tourist thing. Get coffee at Drip City too!"
5261239,39414860,2015-07-23,34003998,Michael,"Eric's apartment is a great spot to stay while sightseeing in Seattle if you are planning on being out of the apartment most of the time.  The pictures are exactly how it looked, and the location was fantastic.  We were able to get around without a car because the apartment was so centrally located.  It was the perfect place to crash after a long day of seeing a really great city.

We never got to meet Eric, but we were able to get into the apartment and get the key without any trouble at all.  Eric even left us some supplies when they ran out.  We would stay here again."
5261239,39613075,2015-07-25,23049796,Kayla,"Great location in Belltown, very close to downtown, Space Needle, and Pike Place. The apartment is small but fine for two people, especially if you're going to only be sleeping there. Eric was nice, and communicated via text to coordinate check in and was there in person to give us the keys. 

This is a no fuss apartment. Sheets and towels were new, but bathroom was dingy (bathtubs and sink were dusty, and old bars of soap were left in tub and on sink). There is no parking included; if you're bringing a car, be prepared to pay for street parking.  Make sure you discuss check out process ahead of time, as we were unable to get a hold of Eric before check out on the day of. "
5261239,40350474,2015-07-30,37053703,Matthew,"Erick was extremely accommodating  and answered all of my questions, responding to my messages promptly. His studio really is in an amazing location, place market is about a 15 min walk and the space needle is a 5 min walk. Also really liked his projector which has Netflix! Only gripe I have about my stay Is that me My Wife and my 10 month daughter were not aware that there was not elevator access to the apartment. Being that his apartment is on the 3rd floor which isn't the biggest deal, but when you are hauling a jogging stroller and diaper bags, car seats etc. Up and down stairs it feels like 6 floors. Overall we really enjoyed our stay. "
5261239,41924453,2015-08-10,26380229,Steven,The apartment was in a great place close to many attractions that were all walkable. Netflix and Plex were available on the Tivo and worked great.  The refrigerator was stocked with some fruit and drinks which were great after a day out on the town. It's an older building but as all of the essentials which were more than adequate. Eric was very understanding with us when we were late due to our plane being delayed and answered all our questions leading up to our stay very quickly.
5261239,42166430,2015-08-11,38281611,Ashley,"Although we never got the chance to actually meet Eric, it was easy to make arrangements to get into the appartment. The listing was accurate about being just steps from the needle it was quite cool."
5261239,42712899,2015-08-15,15155079,Russ & Kira,The location was great for exploring the city.  Be prepared to pay for parking and still spend money on public transportation.  The apartment is a 3rd floor walk up.  The building is older 1930's maybe?  
5261239,43564842,2015-08-20,40918918,Vincent,"We got to meet Eric briefly during check-in, he was pretty friendly and accommodating overall. The communications beforehand could be better tho, as I was trying to ask for check-in instructions a few times before the check-in date, but I didn't get a firm answer until about an hour before checking in at 3pm on that day, just shortly after we've arrived Seattle. As we're from Canada, that's why I wanted to get confirmations before we arrive in the States. Everything works out at the end tho, we arrived at the building at 3pm, no one were there so I gave Eric a call, he was polite and told me that he's running 10 mins late. He did in fact sent me a message on Airbnb shortly before check-in to tell me that he'd meet me at the building but will be running 10 mins late. As I didn't have a data plan in the States and no available wifi around, I actually wasn't able to see the message until afterwards. It would of been nicer if I could get the check-in instructions a few days earlier.
The place was decent and located in an awesome location, extremely convenient if you wanted to do some sightseeing. The cleanliness for the bedroom/living room was fine, but there could be more work put into the bathroom, as we found some yellow stain on the back of the toilet seat and cover, and there were some dusts around that could of been easily wiped. Maybe having some air freshener in the bathroom would be nice, as there was this weird smell in it. Could of been the building being so old, so I just put up with the smell.
Overall we did enjoy our one night of stay here."
5261239,44149463,2015-08-24,38507796,Marie,"This place was the perfect location for my weekend needs, just a short walk to everything I wanted to see and do in the area. Very clean, comfortable, quiet and relaxing setting, with no trouble at all. The host was very quick to respond when I had a question about check out. I enjoyed my stay very much and would love to stay here again on my next Seattle visit. "
5261239,44587951,2015-08-27,1106864,Aighleann,We used Eric's space for a quick one night work event in Seattle.  The location was fantastic and it worked out perfectly for our needs.
5261239,45085844,2015-08-31,2396248,Francis,"
We didn't meet Éric but the communication before booking was fast and easy, as well when in the place. The area is few yards away from Space Needle Center thus making it very convenient. However, there are not many restaurants or shops except those at the foot of the Needle. Regarding the apartment, it is located in an ancient typical building and on the third floor. Note that there is no lift and be prepared to carry your suitcases . The bathroom and the kitchen,  would gain to be renewed. The bed is very comfortable. Good points are that there is air conditionning and an up todate cinema equipment that we never had in our previous AIRBNB places. But, without willing to be rude, we must say that we have been a bit disappointed, considering that the place is not matching the price. Anyway, thanks to Eric"
5261239,45409620,2015-09-02,41118907,Arundhati,"The location was indeed great. The only thing we loved about the apartment was  watching movies on the projector screen. The things that we didn't like ...

1. For us kitchen is very important when we go on a vacation. It was a compete disappointment. There was only a medium sized shallow pan and another square shaped flat pan little bit bigger than size of a bread, one knife and one as slotted spatula. We expect bit more than that when accommodation says kitchen. We had to buy all our meals. I asked for a deep pan for cooking rice and making tea but didn't get it. The microwave and oven was very dirty, so couldn't even use it. Overall the kitchen was in bad shape.

2. The bedding didn't look like it was fresh, not used previously. It was the same black comforter as in the picture. I just hope it was not the same used by previous occupant. I didn't quite feel good about sleeping on the bed. But we had no option.

3. In the toilet there were only 2 tissue rolls, we realised it in the morning when we had to leave and it was almost finished. Couldn't find any extras.

4. There was no space to hang clothes. We used the sofa. And when we were sitting on sofa, they were on the carpet.

5. All junk stashed behind closed doors.

6. It's not a professionally maintained apartment. Its as if someone is already living there but for the nights that you're saying he moved out.

We should have had paid little extra and gotten a nice hotel with free parking. We thought there would be parking space instead had to spend extra 70-80 bucks per day for parking outside.
"
5261239,45641298,2015-09-04,16791073,Kyle,Perfect location for your stay in Seattle.  Near downtown and the Space Needle.  Spacious rooms with everything that you would need (even Netflix!)
5261239,45958413,2015-09-07,38521959,Gelin Cara,"Although our schedules did not match to actually meet the host, Eric was still a good host through text, answering questions and concerns. His apartment was exactly what we needed and looking for to stay a few nights to see the city. The location was only 2 blocks away from Seattle Center and the biggest tourist attractions. This was definitely a convenient listing and would highly recommend it. It was clean and the projection screen with Netflix helped when there was a rainy night night and we had to stay in. The host was friendly as said earlier, would recommend this apartment. "
5261239,46671343,2015-09-12,2207927,Tia,Easy access to the apartment and convenient parking in front of building! Thanks for the quiet stay on my quick trip to Seattle! 
5261239,46883541,2015-09-14,38038885,Josh & Audrey,"The apartment was just what we needed for our visit to Seattle. The location is great. The only tricky part was parking, but there are many options nearby so it ended up as not a problem. It's about two blocks from the Space Needle, Science Museum, EMP Museum, and a lovely park. Everyone we saw on the street seemed friendly enough; many people walking dogs or jogging. The building is older, but the apartment was clean and well equipped. There was an air conditioner, bed, shower with hot water, and a small kitchen. Eric was very accommodating."
5261239,48326267,2015-09-25,23196381,Paul,"Everything exactly as described, and Eric was very easy to communicate and work with.  Extremely convenient to the Seattle Center and a nice 20 min walk to downtown (or shorter monorail ride). Would certainly stay again. "
5261239,48751732,2015-09-28,2987709,Jean-Baptiste,"Great experience, walking distance from a lot of amazing things. We really enjoyed our stay. The projector is a nice icing on top of the cake"
5261239,48973356,2015-09-29,11775329,Lisa,"Eric was very  professional and easy to communicate with; he answered all of our questions immediately. The apartment was exactly as described. Eric's place was just what we were looking for.  We were within walking distance to all the areas we needed to be.  There were several nice places to eat nearby.  Parking was not a problem, as we arrived on a Sunday afternoon and left Monday morning. 

The apartment was perfect; we particularly enjoyed Netflix on the projector screen. Everything was clean and well kept. We will most likely try to book with Eric again next time we need to stay in the Seattle area. 
 "
5261239,50260594,2015-10-10,9220973,William,The perfect little place in the perfect location.  Thanks Eric. 
5261239,50997869,2015-10-16,34036620,Phil,"CONs: The place needed a professional cleaning. The rug was quite messes and smelly. The linens looked spot cleaned vice washed. Parking was costly.
PROs: Awesome location. Good privacy. Eric was responsive and met us there. There was plenty of space for the two of us. Awesome projector screen. 
Overall: Reasonably priced. Bachelor pad feel."
5261239,51246828,2015-10-18,44699292,Adam,"Very well located apartment, close to everything we wanted. Clean, a bit aged/dated as described, but very comfortable.

I never met Eric but he was very helpful, got the room ready early for me to drop luggage off at, and helped get the electronic keying set up.

The room also had a very nice projector setup and we were able to watch Netflix/Hulu + from bed."
5261239,53515886,2015-11-09,4167899,Kara,Great location in Belltown + super easy check in and out. Eric was super easy to deal with.
5261239,53944294,2015-11-14,20971142,Meghann,Was very easy to access the apartment. Very good location. Would stay here again.
5261239,54787574,2015-11-23,47331791,Joe,Everything was great would stay again!!!
5261239,55169302,2015-11-28,14488578,Nataraj,"It was great staying at Eric's place. He was very helpful and made the check in process very easy! The apartment is in a nice area, and close to many attractions (such as the space needle!). Would highly recommend!"
5261239,55310937,2015-11-29,8959445,Christina,"Eric's place was a lovely place to spend a night downtown after a very exhausting day. The space was clean, bright, and comfortable. I liked being able to use the electronic key to access the flat, and the privacy of not needing to meet Eric was rather nice as well--it felt like my own place! The building is older, very charming, and the neighborhood was pretty quiet."
5261239,55702152,2015-12-04,48895136,Heather,"Eric was very accommodating and we had plenty of privacy here. The place was nice and secure, in Seattle proper and the bed was comfy! Hulu plus was a nice touch too."
5261239,55925984,2015-12-07,17608665,Cailin,"Apartment was comfortable and clean. Eric was very friendly, flexible, and easy to work with. Location was great! Super close to the Seattle Center and walking distance to several coffee shops, diners, and restaurants. We parked in the lot next to the building for a reasonable rate and moved to street parking on Sunday as there were lots of spots available. "
5261239,56707270,2015-12-16,30483147,Jacob,My dad and I had a great experience staying at Eric's space. Location was great and the building was easy to navigate. Eric had clean trash cans and had a new roll of toilet paper ready for us apron arrival. The only two downfalls of the space was that the kitchen could use some updating (dirty and not many utensils ) and that the TV was super laggy. Overall great experience the space was great for the price. 
5261239,56894404,2015-12-19,19461749,Bryant,"I arrived to Seattle and Eric was very quick FYI respond to my initial text upon arrival.  He made himself available to buzz me in remotely and I was off and away.

The place is as pictured, and it's very centrally located if you have business downtown or in belltown.  There's a lot of value in this rental.  It provided everything that I needed, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a crash pad that's super convenient and relatively close to everything."
5261239,57981004,2015-12-30,9999172,Max,Cool place. Great projector. Great part of town. 
5261239,58482114,2016-01-02,51845825,Tyler,Eric was very easy going and awesome at accommodating. Very easy to coordinate with. 
66540,171985,2011-01-18,288198,M,"Very clean, quiet and safe. 

There are no hotels in this area, so this B&B provides for a much-needed short stay location.

Hostess pretty much left us to ourselves. Beyond the initial introduction, did not see Carol again except for one night when I went to inform her that another guest was playing loud music close to midnight during her absence. She was very responsive and immediately took care of the problem.

Microwave oven and teabags in room; ability to use kitchen with shelf space provided. No ""breakfast"" provided.

Very cute cat, a black-n-white puffball. 

Recommended."
66540,469759,2011-08-23,890695,Tom,"I had a quiet two and a half week stay.  I found Carol to be unobtrusive but also very engaging when conversing.  She has many interests that keep the house artsy and stimulating.  I especially enjoyed the other guests who were polite and engaging. 

Quiet and at the same time stimulating.  Hmm... It sounds contradictory but that''s the way it was.  "
66540,605704,2011-10-07,855595,Hiromi,I stayed at Carol' home for about 4 weeks. I changed my schedules a lot but she accepted me kindly. Her home was located in good neighborhood and easy to access anywhere by Metro bus system. She looked like spiritual artist and generouse. I felt as if I were at like my own home. Sometime I felt too quiet because of not TV. I will come back her home again.
66540,643221,2011-10-18,1131361,Jennifer,"I would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle!  Carol helped me feel at home with her hospitality while giving me plenty of space to relax, cook some food, and enjoy her lovely, artsy home.  Thank you Carol!"
66540,706292,2011-11-09,1322801,Toru,"Excellent location and truly tranquil place to stay.  All the shops and place you need for day to day things are really close, but the home is tucked into quiet residential area, surrounded by trees, and very quiet (as in tranquil)!  And what's more, friendly neighbors will greets you with smiles.  I ended up getting a job and had to be away and return to sleep in odd hours, but Carol was very accommodating.  She always talk to you with friendly and professional tone, puts you at ease, and will meet your need.  I highly recommend you to stay at her place."
66540,1594407,2012-06-30,2048371,J. Chris And Kim,"It took me way too long to write this review (Sorry Carol!), but I have finally found my sanity enough to do so.  I highly recommend staying at this bnb.  Carol was very accommodating, and made it very easy to feel at home while staying at her house.  She even had me eating the lettuce from her awesome garden!  It's a pretty easy location with or without a car (especially if you don't mind the bus).   The neighborhood is quite tranquil.   and the hostess is superb, whether you are looking for a good conversation or just some private study time!"
66540,1790348,2012-07-24,1935424,Trish,Carol's home is very welcoming. I felt right at ease when I arrived and Carol was very accommodating to my needs. Plenty of privacy and a nice and quiet room to sleep in.
66540,2103845,2012-08-26,3251325,Ted,Exactly what I was looking for - a great place to spend a few days in the Seattle area.
66540,2775030,2012-11-01,103178,Judy,"Carol is so warm and friendly that you feel at home the minute you come in.  I was unable to stay the full time I'd planned to, and I believe we were both sorry not to be able to spend more time together, sharing the house and our lives.  "
66540,5797947,2013-07-16,7095173,Daniel,Carol's place is nice and cosy. It is an easy walk to a small shopping district with cafes and a grocery store. The round kitchen is pretty cool. Carol was super nice and has a very upbeat demeanor. She was very flexible when I needed to change my check in time at the last minute.  Thanks. 
66540,5950793,2013-07-23,7098271,Jake,"I really enjoyed my stay at Carol's place. She was very welcoming and we had several pleasant chats about music/sound. She was also more than happy to give me suggestions on places to see, hike, etc. The house is in a nice, safe neighborhood close to shops and the local grocery store. Being able to use the kitchen, and have wi-fi access, was a big plus. I would totally stay again."
66540,6468788,2013-08-13,7576933,Emanuela,Carol is very friendly and enjoyable company for an evening chat. the house it in very quite and located in a green area. Walking distance from Lake Washington and some beautiful trails
66540,23833980,2014-12-12,16879719,Antonio,"The place is awesome in a very quiet neighborhood, all the streets are really green and friendly. There is one QFC and one Rite Aid like at 6 blocks so you have everything close.
In the house you have a lot of independence and Carol is a wonderfull woman that always helped when I needed something and made me feel like at home."
66540,26425756,2015-02-12,374500,Melissa,"I stayed at Carol's home for a couple of weeks and it was the perfect place to relax and get some needed quite time. Carol is incredibly friendly and was very accommodating/responsive to any questions I had. Her house is in a great location. It's close to a grocery store, coffee shops and the Burke-Gilman trail. I felt comfortable and peaceful during my stay and would recommend Carol's place to any fellow travelers or students. Thanks, Carol! "

1796217,19231480,2014-09-08,20491228,Tammy S,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it won't be my last.   Everything about this property was fantastic.  We were in Seattle to visit our great aunt and my mom, aunt and sister all stayed with me at this property.   We all loved it.  Our flight from the east coast was delayed and host was so accommodating in meeting us at the property much later than we had originally planned.  Property very clean and photos are accurate.   Neighborhood was wonderful !  We walked to church (a Polish Catholic Parish) about a mile away.  A beautiful walk through the rolling hills of Queen Anne neighborhood.   Thank you for everything.  We loved our stay !"
1796217,19384632,2014-09-11,1618778,Holland,The space was PERFECT for our group. The separate living spaces and the communal kitchen/dining/living room gives people their own space and and a space to gather! We loved being in Queen Anne and the parking spot behind the house makes life EASY! We'll be back FOR certain! 
1796217,21721904,2014-10-22,1587964,William,"It's like a hotel but better! Awesome house, fireplace, 4 stories with balconies. Great comfortable stay and central location. Thanks!!"
1796217,21877841,2014-10-26,20590019,David,This was a great place to stay. I recommend it and would stay there again. Arrival and check in were smooth. Property management accommodated someone else in my group arriving first. House was clean and well maintained. Very comfortable for our group of six. Great location close to Fremont and hike up to upper Queen Anne. Tully's 2 blocks away.  
1796217,22560129,2014-11-09,22885827,Wendy,"We were late getting in and our host was very accommodating about meeting us later and keeping in contact with us. The actual house was beautiful, very clean, and perfect for our family to spread out. Having bedrooms on different levels made it easy to put the kids to bed and relax upstairs! There were many restaurants within walking distance and it was a quick drive to downtown tourist places. We loved staying here and wouldn't hesitate to book it again!"
1796217,24022448,2014-12-17,22128385,Heidi,"My family and I stayed at Darik's house for our pre-Christmas celebration and had a wonderful time. The kitchen was well equipped with all the tools and dishes we needed to make our holiday meals. The living area was open to the kitchen and dining areas which made for a pleasant time for everyone including the cooks. The beds were comfortable. With 2 1/2 baths, there were plenty of toilets to go around. Even though there was only one dedicated parking space, we had no problem finding safe and nearby parking on the same street for our additional cars. The home was an easy walk across the bridge to Freemont and then on to the Burke-Gilman Trail for some exercise between meals and sightseeing. And there was fast and easy to use internet access which allowed us to stream movies. All in all, we enjoyed our stay very much at this well situated and nicely decorated home in Seattle. "
1796217,29931999,2015-04-14,29466835,Nick,This house was perfect for what we needed!!! There was five of us all in town for a conference and this house enabled us to have a little hub to live from for a week. We were able to cook rather than eating out all the time and also use the dining room table as a little work station - perfect!
1796217,43028190,2015-08-17,30550626,Matt,"Great place in a really convenient location.  Feels very private, and the home is well furnished and made for a perfect place to stay with a group of friends.  Would definitely stay there again!"
1796217,48704693,2015-09-28,28106999,Mark,"Great place.  Very professional experience.  There isn't much in walking distance, which led to many Uber rides.  But the trips to pretty much everywhere were short which was nice.  "
1796217,51512398,2015-10-20,196507,Sarah And Rachelle,"Absolutely loved our stay at ship canal oasis. Great location, walking distance to Fremont district and a short drive to downtown Seattle. The rooms were comfortable and spacious. "
1796217,54697342,2015-11-23,39242721,Koelle,"We were in Seattle for the week for our daughters wedding.  It was perfect!  There was some separation with the different levels that allowed for personal space yet the living area was plenty big to accommodate all of us.   The location was handy to Queen Anne and Fremont.  I would rent it again!
It's a little difficult to find but we managed.
The kitchen was well equipped and functioned well.
All and all it was a complete success."
5459895,37463067,2015-07-07,28754227,Eugenio,There was no welcome feeling as the apartment is owned by what appears to be a large property management company.   You need to pick up the keys at another property about 4 blocks away.    Which is fine just a heads ups with more detail would be nice.. The apartment was very nice and the location was excellent.   Only complaint which would not of been an issue if not for the record heat in seattle.    The profile lists the apartment has A/C  but there is none.    
5989894,30363688,2015-04-20,1235176,Kelly,"Lubna was very friendly and accommodating. Her apartment is clean and comfortable.  The location is great - easily to walk around downtown, First Hill, and Capitol Hill.   "
5989894,34316376,2015-06-07,7020514,Laurence,"Really practical location for Seattle with easy access to all main attractions.
Seattle is a walking City where everything is within walking distance and Madison & 8th Avenue a great starting point. On Madison there is a number of bars, cafes and stores so there is plenty of amenities nearby but as noted above access to the Waterfront, CBD and Bell town is a matter of minutes. 
The apartment is good and well maintained. the bedroom is spacious with a nice sized lounge area. The bathroom is tight but functional. 
Overall it is a really good apartment with easy access to the eclectic and wonderfully diverse City of Seattle"
5989894,36727483,2015-06-30,26184334,Shenila,"It was a comfortable apartment in a GREAT location. I had access to the pool and the gym. The host was extremely caring and helpful. Only problem that I faced was parking. Luckily, I had a friend who drove me around and walking was not a problem. "
5989894,38788741,2015-07-18,231633,Dan,Great location.
5989894,39231719,2015-07-21,23433724,Grace,"Lubna is a very gracious host. It is a very lovely and clean room, and the location is wonderful. We just can walk around downtown."
5989894,39868725,2015-07-26,21491831,Stella,"Lubna is great, friendly and welcoming. The apartment is lovely, clean and friendly. It is small and it is downtown with the usual downtown background noise level. We used the jacuzzi and pool which were great, a real holiday treat. As a guest you have to not mind being in the open living room. We didn't, the privacy was fine."
5989894,40987175,2015-08-03,38755725,Sarah,"My stay at Lubna's apartment was lovely! The apartment was extremely clean and uncluttered. Lubna was very friendly and generous- she offered me space in her closet to hang clothes, a fresh towel, and use of her kitchen and fridge. She made me feel very welcome and comfortable!"
5989894,41457708,2015-08-07,38718519,Nicole,"I was in Seattle for a work conference and all the hotels were booked. This was great for me because it's so close to the convention center--only a few blocks walk away. The place was simple; no frills, but the description on air b&b  was accurate so it was about what I expected. Lubna was very nice and welcoming and accommodating and let me drop my bags off early before check-in time, which was really helpful!"
5989894,45705234,2015-09-05,1806361,Vincent,"Lubna went ""above and beyond"" to let me into the apartment at the time of my convenience - thanks! The place itself is bare bones as advertised, yet very conveniently located to downtown - at walking distance. Also just a few blocks from the University stop of the SeaTac light rail"
5989894,46009444,2015-09-07,28111516,Hanane,Lubna was very welcoming even if she was not there. The place was very clean and beautiful and the futon was quite comfortable. I would definitely recommend Lubna and the apartment to my friends!
5989894,48838140,2015-09-28,39344762,Arie,Lubna is extremely welcoming and accommodating. The apartment is in a great location and very comfortable. Highly recommended! 
6317449,34034984,2015-06-03,2256925,Tamika,"My room had a vase of freshly cut, pink, peonies on the chest of drawers.  There were drawers empty for my things. This made me feel like someone had been waiting for me.  

The room is well suited to gaining a comfortable night's sleep, with a shade that allows for sun (or cloudiness) when wanted, and privacy when needed. As well, the street, which the room faces, is not particularly busy, so it was a very quiet place to be, when the upstairs neighbors were settled or out at work. 

An awesome little balcony looks out on a garden and a gorgeous view of Rainier Valley,and, became my go-to place in the mornings when I returned from my interviews/business, and provided a great reflection place after a long day.  There is also enough room for Sun Salutations there, or you can use the yard.    

Bathroom/Kitchen: Clean and available.  I never felt like I was in the way in sharing space with the host (though I have learned that I am one of the few who have been there when she is still in the home). There were nice pots and pans available is you like to cook, and HBO.   

Location: A block and a half from the light rail allowed for a quick return to the airport.  And, the station being across the street from the grocery store, was a great way to save money.  Beacon Hill is full of life and culture worth checking out if you choose this space (The Station Coffee House, Beacon Hill Community Center, Baja Bistro, Travellers, Amore Spiritual Center....)  

It was a great experience and I would recommend her to anyone traveling to the 206.  "
6317449,41105734,2015-08-04,23760434,Rich,"My mom stayed at Nilda's when visiting us in Seattle and said ""Nilda's home and her hosting of it offered a more than satisfactory setting and accommodation. The bedroom was large enough to sit and read in and had a great bed with a good mattress. The bathroom was very pleasant with a very spacious shower. The house was always quiet and Nilda was quite friendly without being intrusive.  My only complaint was that the bedroom is right on a street so I would recommend earplugs for sleeping. This air b&b gets 5 out of 5 stars from me."" 

She also enjoyed the neighborhood a lot and the proximity to shops and restaurants in Beacon Hill.

We really appreciated Nilda being flexible and easy to communicate with! Thanks! "
6119785,37311293,2015-07-06,1800682,Steve,"We stayed in Aurelia and Tim's home for month while we were in the process of moving from San Francisco to Seattle. The house was spacious and comfortable, and our 2.5-year-old son loved all the books and toys that they had. The location was wonderful too, with some good restaurants and a bakery within walking distance, as well as the zoo and playground. Because Aurelia and Tim were on vacation during our stay, we only saw them the day before, to get the tour. However, they were very welcoming and communicative throughout. It was a great start to our time in Seattle!"
6119785,40478440,2015-07-31,6340539,Leila,"Absolutely perfect. First of all, Tim and Aurelia were very communicative, flexible, and kind. They were easy to contact, and Aurelia even called me to answer some questions I had. She was a pleasure to talk with. I stayed for a few weeks at their comfortable and relaxing home while I was recovering from a surgery. It was exactly what we needed. The house is spacious and quiet, and the living room is so lovely with the big windows. I enjoyed having the bright windows and green trees to look out on. It was a really nice place to be to rest and relax. They have two comfortable sofas in the living room. It is cute because there is a bunch of toddler books and toys displayed around, and it actually adds some color to the room. The house does not look like much from the outside, but inside it is so warm and wonderful. I'm also in love with the neighborhood. It was great for walking, had adorable streets, some shops and restaurants within walking distance, and right by green lake. There is even a small view of green lake from the house backyard deck. I highly recommend Tim and Aurelia's place!!!!"
6119785,44012943,2015-08-23,33946413,Slayde,"We rented the whole house and it was perfect for our two-family (with toddlers) getaway to Seattle!! Plenty of space, lots of toys, books, and play spaces for the kids, and overall just a really good experience. Great communication with Aurelia & Tim and we loved their simple, common sense policies - basically, ""enjoy and be respectful of our home.""

Great north Seattle location was convenient to our outings to Fremont, Ballard, even downtown wasn't bad, plus lots of good food nearby.

The home is definitely lived-in. This isn't a bad thing (in some ways, it's a good thing), just something to be aware of for folks who might be looking for the more ""professional/swanky"" AirBnB experience."
6119785,44980810,2015-08-30,767433,Carme,"Aurelia and Tim's home was perfect! We loved the living room, the views and everything. It was very cozy. 
The neighborhood was very quite and close to downtown and other cool neighborhoods like Ballard and Fremont. 
I would recommend this house! 
I couldn't met them, but they were very nice every time we wrote each other. 
Thanks guys."
8051134,53523373,2015-11-09,47223621,Katie,"I'm never going back to hotels after this stay! The listing is extremely accurate, the apartment has plenty of light even though its rainy Seattle. Its cozy and the kitchen is well-equipped with all the basics, we were extremely pleased. Ryan and April left us a list of suggestions to do in Seattle since it was my first time there, and they were very helpful about answering my questions about the area since I'm looking at grad school in Seattle. The house is situated in a lovely neighborhood by a fabulous small park on the water, we saw salmon swimming up the stream! (Exciting for Midwesterners) We had great pho at Pho Tic Tac, and I felt there were plenty of eating options to choose from. It was an A+ experience and I would stay with Ryan and April again in a heartbeat."
8051134,53734156,2015-11-11,40535651,Monica,"This was my second Airbnb experience and my fiancé's first, we couldn't have been happier with the location and the hospitality of our hosts. The place was just as described and so so so cozy. Lots of natural light coming through the windows, which made it easy to wake up to in the morning. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the necessary tools to make a small meal. There is no stove top but  the hot plates worked perfectly. April and Ryan, were attentive and answered all our questions promptly and checked-in to make sure everything was going well. We stopped here on a long road trip to check out grad schools in the area so we did have a vehicle. This location is within a short drive to several parks and cool neighborhoods. It was easy to find trails for our daily runs. We would definitely stay here on our next visit to the Emerald City."
8051134,54206343,2015-11-16,27812683,Brissa,Ryan and April made us feel so comfortable! They were extremely accommodating to everything! April was also very kind when we met her! They are awesome!
8051134,54560875,2015-11-21,22535325,Lakeisha,I really enjoyed staying here. It's a private apartment with everything you need. I didn't use the cook top cause I ate out every single night. There's wifi and cable. It's quiet and has a view out back of the mountains. The area is right next to Ballard in a desirable area. It's very quaint. I wished all 5 of my days were available but only 3 were. But glad I stayed here during my apartment search. The couple is really nice. You'll hear their toddler playing from time to time during the day but it didn't bother me because I wasn't there often. 
8051134,54781188,2015-11-23,48588247,Evemar,"Our stay with Ryan and April was unforgettable. Their home was very clean, organized, and even had a slide and trampoline that our little one could play on.

The weather was good that weekend that the sun ray's coming through the windows really lit up the apartment. 

The home was located in a nice quiet area that when we went for a morning walk everyone was nice to greet us good morning or hello. Its very close to the beach and river where we were able to see chum try to swim upstream to the nesting ground. (Our little one was excited to see the fish swim) 

Downtown Seattle was only 10-15min away which was great because we didn't have to drive far.
I won't forget how Ryan helped me boost my car because my battery was drained from me leaving my light on the night before.. Thanks again Ryan.

We had such a great time staying at Ryan and April's apartment that our little one didn't want to go home and kept saying he wanted to go to ""the trampoline house"". All in all it was a great stay that we will comeback in the summer of 2016."

7922197,45880224,2015-09-06,42773227,Kristin,"Mack was awesome and so was the apartment. He met us outside with the key, took us to the room and made sure we had everything we needed and knew some neighborhood spots before taking off. The room was exactly as describe/portrayed in pictures and exactly what we were looking for. It was a really central location for all sorts of good stuff. We walked to dinner in the Pike's Place Market, second dinner at Rocco's on 2nd in Belltown, and the ferris wheel of pier 55. The view of The Space Needle was great and the rooftop/view of Seattle was the cherry on top. 5 Stars, two thumbs up, and 10 out of 10. Rent this room!"
7922197,47847886,2015-09-21,23314873,Yves,Mack was very friendly and helpfully. The apartment was very cosy and has a direct view of the needle. Big rooftop. All in all very pleasant stay. May thanks!
7922197,47945955,2015-09-21,36210401,Phil,"We were met at the property and given the walkthrough in person which was great! The place suited us fine for one night, the location was very awesome, a view of the tower plus near all the action but not in the middle of it.

Parking was everywhere, so no problems there, and we slept well.

7922197,48250422,2015-09-24,34190173,Sarah,"The studio is amazing, very close to space needle and walking distance to Seattle city centre. The host is friendly and responsed rapidly. I totally enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back!!"
7922197,49266549,2015-10-02,9150700,Martin,"Diane was a sweetheart. She waited rather late for me to arrive, and she gave me a quick tour of the building. She even left water bottles and yogurt in the fridge for me. Thanks!
Building had a very small gym on the first floor (mainly free weights and a stationary bike), and the roof has a neat arrangement and view of the city. 
The Room (studio, not a 1 bedroom; but I knew this) was spacious and clean. The view of the Space Needle was a great thing to wake up to (you can see it from the living room but not from the bed). The bed was a bit too firm for my liking. The washing machine and dryer were a blessing. In the middle of everything. Lots of great food options all about!"
7922197,49678003,2015-10-05,10385942,E.,"Diane and Mack were so great and the studio is (*)to die for.  
Not only did they send useful information for getting from the airport but they were very quick to respond to emails and also sent us some customized recommendations based on what we like.  They were super easy to communicate/coordinate with and when we ended up freeing up early from the conference we were and and arriving to the place earlier than initially agreed upon Diane went out of her way to get there to greet us and show us the place.

* The pictures seem almost to good to be true, but once you get there you realize that you cant even capture how cool the view is in a photo.  The location was ideal for getting to where we needed to and was also  a short and fun walk over to pike public market.  

I will definitely recommend this place and will stay here next time I'm in Seattle."
7922197,49919411,2015-10-07,42243366,Courtney,Fantastic location. Very accommodating when it came to checking in. Diane was very helpful and provided recommendations for restaurants and things to do. Spacious and clean studio. Would recommend staying here. 
7922197,50329621,2015-10-11,2812939,Joana,The best location ever! We walked everywhere during our three day stay. The apartment has everything you need. The bathroom was clean and had all bathroom amenities. The bed was super comfortable. I I highly recommend this apartment. Enjoy!

7922197,50993910,2015-10-16,28754227,Eugenio,"Easy check in .    Was met on the street in front of the building.   Clean , cosy and great location !!"
7922197,51317855,2015-10-19,42576556,Adriana,"Amazing location! Perfect walking distance to the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. Also, a lot of great bars, restaurants, and coffee shops within walking distance. The apartment itself was clean, modern, and cozy.  The rooftop patio has an amazing view of Seattle. Diane was very accommodating to our check in and check out times. Would recommend staying here."
7922197,51982850,2015-10-25,33820398,Sergio,"Diane and Mack did a great job giving my girlfriend and I the instructions we needed to get to and get into the apartment. They were very kind and informative and made everything easy. The studio is located about a nice 15 minute walk to Pike's Place and from inside, you can see the entire Space Needle! The area around the studio is perfect for walking around and there are countless little coffee shops and restaurants to explore. The only small thing was that the parking situation wasn't fully  explained to us. The closest and most convenient place to park is an open lot right across the street that'll cost you $10-12 every 10 hours (the max amount of time you can buy at a time). Apart from that, great experience and we'll definitely be returning to Seattle in the future! "
7922197,52993481,2015-11-03,43091808,Lauren,Mack did a nice job letting us navigate our experience. And being available as soon as we had questions Via phone calls. The apartment was in great shape and even had fresh milk in the fridge and stuff to make coffee!
7922197,53420515,2015-11-08,19121250,Damon,"Great location close to sites and transit; extremely close to the Clipper  ferries. The studio is beautiful and clean, and the self check-in arrangement for my timing worked well."
7922197,53629203,2015-11-10,22771923,Meghan & Chad,The apartment is perfectly located within walking distance to so much and included everything we could have needed during our stay. Mack and Diane were really quick to respond to my questions and it was clear they would go above and beyond for their guests. We had a great time in Seattle and would definitely stay in one of their rentals again!

7922197,54269583,2015-11-17,25046610,Kristina,Very clean and easy to find! Mack and Sophia have a great place that is centrally located. Perfect for 1-2 people. I was there on my own and felt very safe and comfortable. 
7922197,54740143,2015-11-23,37837342,Teri,I loved the place! It was just as the picture told. I felt cozy and the location was perfect for my needs. Coffee and cream there for me to use. Really good experience for my first airbnb!
7922197,55318648,2015-11-29,408599,Joseph,I had a great time staying at Mack and Sophia's apartment. Everything was as advertised.
7922197,57295749,2015-12-24,41105096,Chris,"Mack & Sophie's place was as described by them and more. This was our first time in Seattle and we're glad we chose their place. It was very close to the waterfront area and the Space needle as well as many bars and restaurants. Their place is perfect for 2 people. When we left, we walked to the Space Needle and took the Mono Rail to the Sound Transit Link Light Rail which takes you directly to Sea-Tac Airport and only cost us $5 each. "
3703121,19553768,2014-09-14,6772535,Betony,"Erin was a kind host. Her home was clean, easy to find, and had all the essentials available (except for a coffee grinder ;-)). The keyless entry was convenient and we enjoyed the back porch and short walk to Matthews beach. We never met Erin or spoke to her during our stay. The information she provided was sufficient and Erin was a ""hands-off"" host. It was compatible for what we needed at the time."
3703121,24768048,2015-01-02,3903741,Ariel,"This was a great place, location and host. It was quiet and comfortable. Even though it was her home, it was nice and uncluttered, remodeled, and the two available bedrooms were  empty but furnished - i.e. not ""lived-in"". I could walk to Matthews Beach. Beds were comfy. ! Highly recommended."
3703121,25577002,2015-01-19,4333274,Laura,"I highly recommend Erin's place....so much value for the price! It was perfect for my partner and two sons and I.  We got so much use from the well-stocked kitchen and the t.v. area, which was what we needed most.  It had space enough for a small dinner party, which was lovely.  I would say it's even nicer inside than the pictures suggest, and it's very quiet ..and convenient to groceries etc. Thanks so much!"

fully equipped as described, 2 very nice living
areas, 2 bedrooms and one bathroom with 
towels, shampoos, and even a blow dryer.  It was great!  Her home is a very short walk from Matthews Beach and I walked over every day.  My husband and I also walked the Burke Gilman trail all week, the location is great.  We were there for our daughter's graduation and really enjoyed barbecuing on the deck!  The home has a very large deck with nice views.  Very enjoyable.  Erin, left us instructions and was available if we needed her.  We didn't need a thing, everything was ready for us!  Thank you Erin.  
"
3703121,36097711,2015-06-25,11356556,Andreas,"This place is wonderful and a great value! It has everything you need - dining table, large and well-equipped kitchen, spacious deck, two bedrooms, modern bathroom, two living areas, all with high quality furniture. Washing machine, dyer, WiFi, and TV with Netflix are available.

Downtown is a 20 to 30 minute ride away but that's not a big deal since the place is in a really nice neighborhood. A beach park is literally steps away, various shopping and dining options and a mall are nearby. There's a bus stop right outside but you're probably better off with a car. 

We had a great stay here and would recommend it to everyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle."
3703121,36833603,2015-07-01,36677293,Anuja,"Erin personally took care of introducing us to her lovely house. We found the place easily and soon after we checked in, we hit the beach (which is hardly 3 mins away!!!). We (my husband, my in-laws and myself) stayed there for 5 nights, which turned out to be an amazing vacation for us."

3703121,39595930,2015-07-25,8360648,Cassandra,"Erin communicated very well via email. Her home is easy to locate and the keyless entry makes things simple. Parking was super easy as well. Her house is very clean and has everything you need, including wifi and washer and dryer.
 
We cooked most nights in house. You will need a car to drive to stores (5 minutes away by car) and down town (20 minutes); however the bike path is a minute away and leads right into the university area. We loved this tree covered path. The small beach and park was also a two minute walk and the kids took full advantage of this. The bedrooms had comfortable beds and Erin kindly empties the closets and provides a ton of hangers (most appreciated).
 It was quiet and very comfortable. Highly recommended."
3703121,41749338,2015-08-09,9035038,Celine,"This nice house is well located just 10min of Seattle downtown and easy to access from I5 or 520. Some market available in 5min driving or mall like University village for some shopping. This house is just at 5min walking distance from Matthews beach and very appreciated during warm summer.
This house is well arrange with two bedrooms, kitchen, salon, family room, bathroom …. The plus is the patio access if you want take breakfast, lunch, dinner or just have fun and drink a beer. We were in vacations in family during 8 days and appreciate to be quiet and comfortable.
Erin provided us all information to have a great time in Seattle and in her house. Really appreciate this vacation and Seattle visit.

"
3703121,55568718,2015-12-02,45249268,Gail,We just finished at 9 day stay at Erin's home.  The pictures and description were totally accurate.  The location was perfect.  The location is close to University of Wash and Children's hospital.  We were able to drive to Bellevue in 15 minutes one morning for an appointment.  There are many different markets within a few miles.  Our favorite was Metropolitan Market.  It was nice to have the bike path to walk on right at Matthews Beach.  The kitchen has everything you will need we cooked most nights including Thanksgiving.  There is a great deck off the back of the house but we did not use it.  The nice thing about this house even though it is cozy there are two distinct areas if you need them.  My husband could watch television in one room and my daughter could do her homework and practice piano in the other room.  Since we were down in Seattle for appointment at Children's Hospital we ended up just enjoying the house and not visiting to many sites.  We did enjoy a few of the coffee shops in the nearby neighborhoods.  Erin was quick to respond to every email message and was the best host.  We will look to stay their again on our next visit.  
8507062,48654995,2015-09-27,44792761,Behrad,"David was the best host I've had. His house is immaculate, his location is great, and he himself is very interesting to talk to. I was lucky enough to have him keep me company and show me the neighborhood when I was bored and we had a great weekend hanging out because of it. Highly recommended."
8507062,51061209,2015-10-17,20934541,Jure,David was a great host. The room fit it's description well. David even took one day off and took me on a day trip to mount Si. Thanks David!
8507062,51246900,2015-10-18,19312381,Caley,"David was a great house and the house was incredible! We loved the old house style and the location was perfect. David had everything thought out, with the wifi network and password on the nightstand. Thanks for a great stay!"
8507062,53432781,2015-11-08,48176884,Alexander,Excellent. I have stayed at four star hotels that had lower quality accommodations. Everything was clean and well thought out and David was an interesting and courteous host.
8507062,56126676,2015-12-09,2855970,Janice,"I stayed for an entire month with David. And a month is a good chunk of time within which an air host is likely to reveal his or her true colors. I'm happy to report that David's ""true"" is genuine and conscientious hospitality. From appreciated essentials like a spic and span bathroom to cheery details such as fresh flowers each week, David consistently delivered awesome throughout my 30 day stay. 

The location was fantastic. A runner's wonderland (otherwise know as The Arboretum) was literally minutes around the corner. The bus stop, just outside his door, made trips to Belltown, Capitol Hill and the University easy and convenient. Seattle restaurant favorites such as Volunteer Park Cafe and Cafe Flora are within a scenic 20 minute stroll. 

Highly recommend. "

The neighbourhood is in a gorgeous area outside of the downtown area- about a ten minute drive. The room was really tidy, clean and comfortable. In the morning, after our rather late arrival, Renee had a lovely breakfast arrangement for us including fresh organic fruits and tea. I definitely recommend you stay here especially if you're travelling by car (easy to locate and free street parking). I am already looking forward to going back!! "
3237501,14319229,2014-06-16,16506252,Wayne,"Renee was a fantastic host. She was friendly, helpful, knowledgable of Seattle and did anything she could to assist me during my stay. 

Her place has a beautiful view, is extremely clean and located in a quiet, safe suburb that is conveniently located to public transport and local shops. 

She even allows you to take over kitchen! I'd happily stay with Renee again and recommend her to anyone. "
3237501,14651860,2014-06-23,241337,Amanda,"We had a great time at Renee's! Her home was easy to find and located close to several different bus lines. We had no problem navigating our way around Seattle and back! The neighborhood was peaceful and quiet - on Saturday morning there is a great little Farmers Market to check out. The home itself has a beautiful view of other neighborhoods and even a peak at downtown Seattle and the Space Needle. The room was perfect for what we needed, and Renee was extremely helpful in answering all of our questions. She was very thoughtful and even checked ahead of time if we had any dietary issues! We loved our visit here and definitely recommend staying at Renee's!"
3237501,16260909,2014-07-24,17206739,Chris,"Renee was a great host during my visit to Seattle. Her place was great! It's just a short drive from downtown Seattle, in a quiet neighborhood with a great view and right next to a few bus routes. She prepared and provided a few documents before I arrived that contained details of her place, of how to get to her place and of the local bus routes.  It was great to have these ahead of time! She was really nice, friendly and helpful the entire time trip.  She even didn't mind when I came in late a few evenings from exploring Seattle. I'd happily stay with Renee again and recommend her to anyone."

The house is in a great neighborhood with easy access to downtown and other neighborhoods like Fremont and Ballard. Renee was a great host and very enjoyable to talk with. She was very accommodating in getting me a key, left clean towels, and offered yogurt and fruit in the morning. Renee was quick to respond to messages and questions and extremely friendly overall. I had a great time and would definitely stay here again if I'm back in Seattle. "
3237501,17883491,2014-08-18,19357776,Amanda,"Renee was a great host. She was very nice and even dropped me off on her way downtown at a last minute festival event I decided to attend. The room and home were very clean and the neighborhood was absolutely beautiful and easy to access anywhere in Seattle that I needed to go. Convenient, friendly, quiet and all around a great place to stay. I'd recommend it to anyone. Safe travels! "
3237501,18359779,2014-08-25,18230162,Gretchen,"We had a lovely time staying with Renee while in Seattle for a wedding. The house was attractive, clean, quiet and comfortable. Renee was friendly and helpful but also gave us space and privacy. Everything was as described in the listing. We would definitely stay here again! "
3237501,18902082,2014-09-02,19760010,Mason,"Very wonderful lady, great house in a good area, and the bed was very comfortable (: "
3237501,20117641,2014-09-23,21251186,Deborah,"I enjoyed my stay in Renee’s home in Magnolia!  Renee was helpful and friendly without being intrusive. Her home was very clean, neat and attractively furnished. The bedroom and bed were comfortable. I appreciated having a good place to park my car. I also enjoyed getting to know the Magnolia neighborhood: the Farmer’s Market, the shops, Discovery Park.  A great stay!"
3237501,33149142,2015-05-25,2639381,Drew And Sarah,"A very enjoyable Airbnb experience!  Renee was a wonderful host....friendly without being intrusive.  Her home is in a lovely neighborhood just a few blocks from restaurants and shopping and close to mass transit.  Renee's house is beautiful, beautifully kept, and decorated and spotless.  Highly recommend.  Thank you, Renee!  "
3237501,39955423,2015-07-27,25420224,Ian,"From the first day of my arrival I was made to feel welcome in Renee's home and all during a fairly extended stay I found her 
to be a gracious and conscientious hostess; her hospitality and
solicitude were unfailing.
 
I occupied a cozy and tastefully furnished room and I was provided the use of an adjoining bathroom. I was, furthermore allowed full access to her living room and kitchen and the use of her laundry facilities.

The house itself is situated in a pleasant lakeside suburban neighborhood; there is a small commercial center nearby 
with a grocery store, pharmacy, post office, bank and a 
few small shops; in summertime it even hosts an open air 
farmer's market on Saturdays. A nearby bus line provides
ready access to downtown Seattle.

I would not hesitate to commend Renee as hostess to any
one visiting the Seattle area and looking for a place to stay. 
"
3237501,40842141,2015-08-02,14608332,Margo,This room is a great space with easy access to many areas in Seattle. Renee is a very friendly and helpful host. The breakfast options are a plus compared to other rooms! I would recommend this room to friends and would definitely stay here again. 
3237501,41980538,2015-08-10,29954968,Harriet,"Renee was a fantastic host.  I had trouble with a wisdom tooth while staying with her and she was so wonderful - including picking up groceries for me and even making me mashed potato.  Her home is very welcoming and comfortable, exceptionally clean and just a lovely and very peaceful place to be. "
3237501,42966434,2015-08-16,23415001,Chi-Fei,"Renee has a great place, located in the most convenient area in Magnolia if you need to rely on public transportation. The house is cozy and clean. Renee is very nice and accommodating. Highly recommended!!!"
3237501,43668188,2015-08-21,7030221,Alexis,"Renee has a great house in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood.  Everything is very clean and tidy, which I love!  The bed was super comfortable, and Renee is very friendly. "
3552006,15738247,2014-07-14,17920811,Megan,"Beautiful loft apartment in an awesome neighborhood.  The place was very clean and, although we arrived later than expected and couldn't meet face to face with Tiffany, we were greeted with a welcome note and a list of recommendations for places around the city.  The loft has a door straight to the rooftop with a great view of the city as well as lounge furniture and a community grill.  Tiffany was willing to answer any questions I had about the apartment and the area, would stay here again  in a second! Great location to visit the city."
3552006,16156661,2014-07-22,17221020,Chris,Tiffany's place was beautiful and perfectly located for us to explore Seattle on foot. The loft setup was cool and intimate but still gave us enough room when one of us needed to finish some work. The deck had a beautiful view. Tiffany was a welcoming host who really tried to introduce us to the area. I'd definitely look this place up again next time I'm in town.
3552006,17882459,2014-08-18,14521159,Jolie,Great experience and loft was just as described.  Tiffany was kind enough to leave us chocolate and wine and left a list of great recommendations as well.  Thanks again!
3552006,18418207,2014-08-26,405182,Wynn,"Stellar location with a stellar view. I loved having more of a neighborhood feel, with coffee shops, little shops, and restaurants all within easy walking distance. Tiffany was very helpful, answering questions promptly and making sure we were settled and comfortable."
3552006,18696262,2014-08-30,4458956,Ingrid,The appartment was amazing and Tiffany was very helpfull in helping us where to leave our luggage the next day before returning to the airport. I woud recommend this place to anyone! 
3552006,18954673,2014-09-03,6323699,Matthew,"Tiffany's loft is as beautiful (very) as it is convenient. Located in Capitol Hill, everything is steps or a short ride from her building. The apartment itself is well appointed, clean, and spacious. The roof deck, accessible from the top floor of the loft, affords breathtaking views of downtown and Lake Union.

Tiffany was sweet enough to leave us chocolate and a great list of things to do in the city (my personal highlight was the Sky View Observatory). Also, she was immediately available the couple times we needed to reach her. 

All around amazing host and accommodations! Highly recommended."
3552006,20125959,2014-09-23,1432443,Mike & Maike,"Great Place! Great Location!
We enjoyed our stay at Tiffany's. Location was perfect for us. You can walk downtown, and even to the market no problem. Also walking further into Capitol Hill was beautiful..some great little parks.  We found parking on the street without issue although we only needed the car once. Tiffany was easy to deal with..no hassles at all. 
Would definitely stay again and recommend to anyone."
3552006,20466967,2014-09-29,21544890,Kristina,"Staying at Tiffany's place was great, the location was exactly where I hoped we would be. My boyfriend and I went to Seattle on short notice in hopes to find an apartment for relocation later this year. Never visiting Seattle was a breeze thanks to Tiffany's hand written list of places to see, eat, and experience. The apartment itself was very comfortable, clean, and spacious. The rooftop was absolutely gorgeous at night. We were able to save some extra money thanks to having an awesome kitchen and cook a few meals ourselves. Capitol Hill and the surrounding area has a multitude of things to do, and we were lucky enough to experience some of it in our short 4 day trip. The only thing we disliked about the area was our inability to find close street parking, we would sometimes have to circle the block for 10-20 minutes. Overall, we would stay there again, she is quick to respond with any questions or concerns. Our first airbnb experience was a success, I highly recommended staying at Tiffany's. "
3552006,21489121,2014-10-18,3463322,Scott,"Nice loft - good location.  Everything was clean, neat - bathroom was clean, bed was nice and comfortable, clean sheets.  Tiffany was available to provide keys and things went well.  My only complaint  was a lot of New England Patriots memorabilia around.   Lot for a NY Giants fan to handle ..."
3552006,22726207,2014-11-12,23504908,Adam,"We had a great time at Tiffany's loft. It has all the comforts we could have asked for, a great location and terrific city views."
3552006,24880195,2015-01-03,1690484,Tyler,"Tiffany was very hospitable.  We were greeted with a few goodies and a Seattle magazine to help with any recommendations.  The apartment was very clean and was almost exactly as described.  The bed was a dream, soooo comfortable. The views from the apartment were rather spectacular.  In warmer weather, the mezzanine would have been a wonderful hangout.  The apartment was very close to many easily accessible conveniences such as a couple bars, restaurants, and coffee shops.  The only major inconvenience was parking in the neighborhood, we usually found a place but after around 15 minutes of searching on average.  "
3552006,25622720,2015-01-20,12033304,Andrew,"I had a great experience at Tiffany's loft. The views were amazing and the location was very convenient for a short trip in Seattle. The apartment was very well taken care of and I had no issues getting in or out. 

Great place to stay!"
3552006,25917842,2015-01-29,21580308,Justin,Tiffany was a great host. The building that her loft is in had an amazing rooftop view that's very easily accessible from her unit.  Great natural light and very clean. I would definitely stay here again!
3552006,27969596,2015-03-15,21989080,Teresa,"Tiffany's place is just like it says: an urban loft with amazing views. We got to town rather late, but Tiffany was there to welcome us and show us the ins and outs of her place. It's a charming loft with access to a rooftop deck that has panoramic views of Seattle. Definitely recommend this cozy modern space!"
3552006,28063752,2015-03-16,19356072,Andrew,"Tiffany was exceptionally accommodating on short notice. Her loft and furnishings are comfortable and very nice. Neighborhood is fun, walkable and plenty to do."
3552006,28267205,2015-03-21,28315783,Adam,"Tiffany's spot is clean and modern. Nice views, great windows. We enjoyed the neighborhood. Single Shot was a highlight, short walking distance. This is Tiffany's personal place and it's very clean. She was great on communication and setting us up, though we never met. "
3552006,28823371,2015-03-30,7965665,Kristin,Staying at Tiffany's Urban Loft worked our perfectly for our Seattle trip.  Her apartment is located in a fun neighborhood with lots of great restaurants within walking distance.  We also could not get  enough of the view directly off of the bedroom. Simply stunning!  Tiffany was more than accommodating and allowed a late check-out to better coordinate with our flight.  Great Stay!  
3552006,29571681,2015-04-09,11150572,Max,The apartment was great and Tiffany left us with a list of great recommendations of places in the neighborhood. The views of the city were spectacular and the apartment was within walking distance of everything you could every need. We had a wonderful experience staying there!
3552006,29864436,2015-04-13,2344620,Elizabeth,Tiffany responded quickly and answered my (many) questions about the trip and apartment. The views and rooftop deck were stunning and the bed/bedding very comfortable. Highly recommended! 
3552006,30426950,2015-04-21,5476660,Justin,"This apartment is fantastic!! It was clean, VERY conveniently located and very unique. We walked to Queen Anne neighborhood, Pike Place, Safeco Field and the Space Needle. We love Seattle. The best part of this apartment (in my opinion) is the connected rooftop terrace. It's ""shared"" but I never ran into anyone out there. The view was so amazing of Downtown, the Puget Sound and Space needle. Tiffany is incredibly communicative and a superb host. ONLY drawback is parking but if you search long enough you can find a place somewhere on the street within several blocks. Just be patient! No doubt when we come back to Seattle, we hope this apartment is available. I definitely recommend 100 times over!"
3552006,32849596,2015-05-22,4158513,Keller,A nice loft style condo with a gorgeous shared patio overlooking downtown and Lake Union.
3552006,35228523,2015-06-16,12775711,Margaret,What can be better than glass of wine at sunset at the roof garden? when garden  is accessable directly from the loft and wine is a complement of the host.
3552006,35569504,2015-06-20,17084471,Caroline,"We had such a great stay at Tiffany's apartment. It is in a fantastic location - both the neighbourhood and the proximity to downtown.  Tiffany was also really helpful and a great host. As everyone else has mentioned, the view from the rooftop deck was phenomenal, especially on a clear evening.

If you are driving there is free parking throughout the neighbourhood but it can take a while to find a spot. On our last night we found a parkade on Harrison that was very close by. "
3552006,35842279,2015-06-22,34757555,April,"Tiffany was an awesome host!  We loved how fast she got back to us when we'd message her, and how she left us a bottle of wine and a great guide for some killer spots; it was a very nice welcome!  The loft was exactly how it had been described, but the view was even better than we expected with an amazing panoramic view of Seattle.  Capitol Hill is a very convenient and exciting place to stay or just hang out because there's so much to do without having to go far, and we were stoked to have such a nice place to call home base while we were visiting one of our favorite neighborhoods.  Thank you Tiffany for sharing your space with us and making our trip this year that much more fun!"
3552006,36637083,2015-06-29,36721068,Shona,Tiffany was absolutely wonderful. The place was very clean and she is very responsive to any questions or concerns you may have.
3552006,39085319,2015-07-20,15353254,Lyn,Great location and AMAZING views!  Exactly as listed.  Parking is challenging in the area - so beware - but the space itself is fantastic.  
3552006,40821270,2015-08-02,4460433,Sarah,"Would visit again! Open, airy apartment in a great location. Walking distance to many cool spots downtown. Tiffany was super attentive - coordination was easy and effective. "
3552006,41988563,2015-08-10,5016501,Ron,Tiffany was very efficient and accommodating.  Maintained contact.  Made recommendations.  Left clear instructions.  The place was exactly as advertised.   Would definitely stay again. 
5058086,31015953,2015-04-30,573136,Julie,"Hollis was an incredible host. Not only did I find everything I needed in The Nest but the place is truly incredible. And as promised in her listing, the space was perfect for myself and my pup (I could see a couple being comfortable here as well!).

I was truly blown away by the level of detail that Hollis and her family put into designing this space. The bathroom was the perfect place to unwind and is complete with heated floors, a great tub (bath salts included!) and even a steam shower. It was a great way to relax after my long days at the office.

There is a great deal of privacy and Hollis was so considerate of my space and my well-being. She checked in with me regularly to make sure I had everything I needed, but didn't overwhelm me with emails or calls. She was really responsive when I needed her.

I wound up having a family emergency back home during my stay and not only did Hollis allow me to extend my stay in her space, but she even offered to look after my pup when I had to fly home for the day to look after my mom. 

I plan on booking a stay with Hollis every time I come back to Seattle and would recommend the space to any of my friends and coworkers."
5058086,31659162,2015-05-08,31472572,Elisabeth,"Staying at ""The Nest"" has been the most welcomed retreat and home! Hollis makes you feel welcomed immediately and greeted my first day I arrived.  After deciding to uproot my life in Ohio and traveling across the country to live in Seattle, it felt amazing to have ""The Nest"" to call a temporary home. 

The ameninties give you a nice retreat between the beautiful scenery this location has to offer. There was a slight issue with the Wifi and I only bring it up to speak to how wonderful Hollis was in resolving this issue. She overnight shipped a range extender so I wouldn't be burdened while she was out of town. I felt like she went above and beyond doing this! The fireplace is nice and cozy and brings a wonderful warmth to the suite. There is lots of natural light that comes through and the steam room and spa tub make wonderful remedies after walking the Queen Anne hills and seeing what all the area has to offer. The espresso machine was an extremely welcomed luxury- if you're a coffee drinker the espresso and the espresso machine are a must try! The suite comes with a four burner gas stove, fridge/freezer and a microwave that would make an oven jealous. Having laundry on site with detergent provided was a life saver for anyone who is living out of a suitcase.

Hollis has a great response time and has been very respectful to my privacy. I have enjoyed my stay so much I extended my stay for another week (and if it wasn't already booked maybe even another week)! I highly recommend this suite and feel grateful to have met someone like Hollis and to have ""The Nest"" to call home during my new transition!"
5058086,32208047,2015-05-15,31472572,Elisabeth,My second week at the nest was as enjoyable as the first! It's a fantastic location with hosts that are very accommodating. Highly recommend and I'm glad this was my first experience on Airbnb!
5058086,32768158,2015-05-21,2066283,Roger,"We had a great time at the Nest. It is well located, quiet and well equipped. The radiant floor steam room/bath was exceptional and by far the best I have encountered in Airbnb. Hollis was very attentive and gave us attentions when needed but also lots of space.  It is convenient to Seattle and surrounding towns.  Parking is ample and free on the street. I would definitely stay there again! "
5058086,33049888,2015-05-24,33864194,Brian,"I had a wonderful experience at Hollis's studio. I absolutely loved the bathroom. It is really as great as it looks and sounds. 

The rest of the studio was nice and cozy.  It really does give off the vibe of being in a ""nest"".  The studio is loaded with all kinds of goodies such as dimming lights, fireplace, gas ranges,espresso machine, etc..  

The kitchen is what surprised me the most. I wasn't sure what to expect when I arrived but I left with great satisfaction. The kitchen has everything you need to prepare a nice meal for a couple. 

I would definitely recommend this studio to anyone who is looking for a comfortable place to relax and unwind. Hollis is more than willing to be of any assistance if you would ever need it. Great host!"
5058086,33959292,2015-06-02,32779709,Gagan,"Hollis place was awesome! It was a great experience staying at nest and I hope someday I will own a similar place. The house was really well furnished and had all things for our needs. We used to espresso machine and the steam bath available! I cant emphasize enough on how great the place was. Hollis also provided us with a guidebook for the place which gave us good info on how to make our way around.

The location of the place was close to bus stops to Downtown and Fremont. It also had some amazing viewpoints at walking distance to the house. 

I definitely recommend the Nest for anyone coming down to Seattle! "
5058086,35677094,2015-06-21,13679808,Natasha,"The Nest was a perfect retreat for the weekend. Close enough to downtown and a 5 minute Uber ride to Ballard. Hollis was extremely kind and responsive in all accommodations prior, during and post our stay. Would definitely stay at The Nest again :)"
5058086,35964317,2015-06-23,35090930,Mark,"Hollis was quick to accommodate my potential check-in delay, and the process was very painless. I showed up to find plenty of parking then was greeted right outside and promptly given a key and directed to the helpful guidebook that was provided (also electronically before the trip). The space was immaculate and beautiful. The fireplace was nice at the end of the night, and the steam room was a very therapeutic wake-up after a late night... The neighborhood has some interesting driving nuances if you're not used to the Seattle area, but with GPS it wasn't a problem. I went all over the major Seattle area and rarely spent more than 15 minutes in  an Uber/Lyft. The bed was very comfortable; I slept so well. I'd stay here again without thinking twice-- like a 5-star hotel room, but better."
5058086,36862671,2015-07-02,30806890,Josh,"The nest was a very modern, clean and quaint little space for our week long stay.  The basement apartment was well thought out and taken care of.  We did feel as though this was a more ""managed"" environment than we are used to with airbnb.  The host is usually at home on the main floor and, I believe she runs a business out of the it as well.  We were under the impression that the apartment was dog friendly, however despite the lively neighborhood dogs and frequent coming and going of guests the first few days, which did make our dogs a bit anxious, we were informed that dogs were not to left on the premises, ""as stated in the handbook.""  Yes, there is a handbook, which includes helpful information about the apartment and the immediate area, however did not include this tidbit to our knowledge or after review.  Although this is a great small space for a lone traveler or couple, it was not a comfortable stay for us, during a stressful move back to the area.  Had we been on vacation, I think it would have been a different experience than expected, due to the high level of structure disclosed upon arrival."
5058086,38599375,2015-07-17,30132860,Rebecca,"Very comfortable and well-stocked studio apartment. The kitchen has everything you need and the bathroom is fantastic, with heated floors and a steam room in the shower. Also, the food bowls and pickup bags she provided for our dog were a nice touch. I'm happy we picked this property to stay in during our visit to Seattle. "
5058086,40213191,2015-07-29,25369816,Michael,"This was our first Airbnb experience.  Everything lived up to expectations.  The property was well represented on the Airbnb site, clean, secure and private.   The neighborhood is very walkable.  Most of the local restaurants are a 15 - 25 minute walk which was fine with us.   The apartment was stocked with essentials. Tea, espresso provided. There is an assortment of local maps, books and games.    The washer / dryer was much appreciated.  The kitchen and appliances seemed well outfitted.  We enjoyed meeting our host and her local recommendations.  She communicated well by email and text before and during our stay.  We would definitely consider returning to the Nest on our next Seattle visit."
5058086,40751564,2015-08-02,35093411,Sarah,We really enjoyed The Nest and the neighborhood!
5058086,41732998,2015-08-09,30560800,Anna,"This adorable little studio is absolutely fabulous! My fiancee and I stayed here for a week while in town for an event (Dota 2 TI5), and we're super happy we found this place. Really cute, clean, beautifully decorated, modern, and very comfortable. Close to everything.

We even got a chance to hang out with our hosts and chat about our adventures (because who DOESN'T want to listen to a couple of nerds rant about competitive video games). Would be more than happy to stay here again if we come back next year. =)"
5058086,42880295,2015-08-16,8595260,Briana,Wonderful beautiful accommodations. The nest provided the right amount of rest and adventure for our Seattle stay.  The views from Queen Anne are second to none and the local top pot doughnuts was a treat as well. My husband and I are planning on visiting yearly for our anniversary and hope to stay at the nest again!
5058086,45071157,2015-08-31,34189061,Steve,Hollis made us feel very welcome upon our arrival and went out of her way to get us a table in order for our children (who live in Seattle) to come over and visit and have dinner with us.  The lovely kitchen was well-stocked with anything we could possibly need.  The bathroom was tastefully done and beyond beautiful.  There was always parking available on the street and the Queen Anne section of Seattle is not only beautiful but accessible to everything you'd want to see in Seattle.
5058086,46368880,2015-09-10,4803738,Hillary,"This is a great AirBNB. The photos totally do the apartment justice - it is gorgeous and luxurious. The bathroom is totally tricked out, and we loved having a fireplace we could so easily use. The neighborhood is very quiet and residential -- perfect for a relaxing get away. Something to note is that it's not near restaurants/nightlife. We used uber and had no problem getting around town. Would definitely stay at this apartment again! "
5058086,46800890,2015-09-13,17853814,Rachel,"We were happy to arrive and find the space exactly as advertised! Hollis was a very thoughtful host - she anticipated many potential needs of her guests and we had access to anything we could need (fully stocked kitchen, washing machine / dryer ...). The house is in a great area, we generally used Lyft as our transportation and were about 15 minutes at the most away from everything that we wanted to visit. Highly recommended!"
5058086,49743157,2015-10-05,11379673,Marty,"A wonderful cozy space nestled in the hills of Queen Anne, the nest offers guests a charming, quiet, well decorated mini home for your stay in Seattle. The bathroom is amazing, and the bed is very comfortable. Didn't get use the kitchen but looked like some great meals could be prepared. It's tucked away in a neighborhood with excellent restaurants and shops if you didn't want to journey far. Pikes Market is an easy 10-15 minute drive and so is the space needle. I would definitely stay here again."
5058086,50102489,2015-10-09,6763916,Erin,We had great stay. The place is very cozy and well thought out. You have everything you need to have a wonderful vacation.
5058086,52130423,2015-10-26,39546425,Andrew,"Gorgeous place! Quiet, peaceful, and very clean. I highly recommend this place to anyone for short or long stays."
5058086,55199283,2015-11-29,1454478,David,"This apartment was a great find in Queen Anne. It is completely updated, cozy, clean and in the best neighborhood. Everything you need is there. The heated floors, fireplace and steam room make it feel like a luxury apartment. Hollis is a great host who answered all of my questions and was a great host for both my dog and I. I will for sure return when I come back to Seattle."
5058086,56875489,2015-12-19,34995376,Xiang,We had a nice experience! The location is really convenient. It takes about 15-20 minutes uber to go to downtown. And quite near Pike Public Market. The apartment is exactly as photos shown on the Airbnb. 
5058086,57286123,2015-12-24,2914881,Amy,"My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay at The Nest over Christmas- we could not have asked for a better place to stay. Hollis was very friendly, communicative, thoughtful and helpful. We enjoyed getting the opportunity to meet her and chat a bit during our stay, and she is the consummate host in every way. The suite itself was luxurious and fitted with all the necessities one might need. The bed is comfortable, kitchen well stocked, and of course the steam shower is to die for. We cannot wait to book our next visit! "
5315169,29211447,2015-04-05,1344602,Matthew,"Barbara's place was greatly located with breakfast and food options in walking distance. Cozy and clean, had a great time!"
5315169,29780201,2015-04-12,4433755,Julia,"Barbara's apartment was adorable (exactly as photographed). She was also very helpful and suggested some nice local bars, restaurants and other attractions for us. The place was super clean and comfortable and I would definitely recommend it to a friend. The location was only a short walk to downtown which made our trip very convenient. "
5315169,30882978,2015-04-28,3906992,Lisa,"I was traveling with a group of friends. Very grateful that Barbara was willing to accommodate all of us even though the listing said 4 max. 

We arrived at the apartment around noon on the day of check in. It was all our first time in Seattle and didn't know that parking was going to be such an issue. Called Barbara a couple of times with no answer so one of us ran in and found a guest parking pass. Long story short we got a parking ticket even with the parking pass. Be very careful to go online and research which streets you can park on. Even after looking on the city of Seattle website it was not very clear so we ended up paying for parking our entire stay just in case. Be warned that parking around the area is $4/hr so that added up. 

Other than that and a somewhat slow draining tub, it was a nice place to stay. Only my second time using airbnb, a little weird seeing her personal belongings at first. 

All in all I would rate it 3.5-4 stars. "
5315169,33363773,2015-05-27,6472291,Diana,The experience was awesome. My friends and I had a great time in Seattle. Barbara's place was already set up by the time we got there and she was super flexible in letting us leave our stuff at her place past check out. I would definitely stay at her place again. 
5315169,34422227,2015-06-08,30801717,Stana,"Barbara made us feel so comfortable and welcomed. The place felt like home, I loved the fresh flowers touch! (Sunflowers are my favorite!) The place is in great location! It was everything and then some of what I expected. 

Thank you Barbara for being an amazing host! "
5315169,35916871,2015-06-23,14104379,Jessica,Barbara's place was just as seen in the posted images and in a great location for visiting Seattle. She was sweet enough to leave us a note that explained everything that we needed to know for our stay and we had a great time thanks to her hospitality. Would love to stay at her  place again if I were to ever visit Seattle again. 
5315169,36577290,2015-06-29,6887585,Tashara,Barbara's place was so fun and adorable. There were three of us in her place and it worked out great! We cooked our meals instead of eating out in Seattle and she had everything we needed in her kitchen. Definitely recommend her place! She even gave us chocolate 
5315169,37339338,2015-07-06,25714131,Kiera,"Barbara made us feel welcome and had a nice welcome treat for us when arrived. It was a nice personal touch. Great space, great neighborhood within walking distance to capital hill and downtown. We had a fantastic stay and is perfect for 2 - 4 people. "
5315169,37966315,2015-07-12,32143001,Hank,The nice condo is in a very good neighborhood with lots of trees and I felt quite safe there. The #2 bus stops two blocks away and can stop one block away. There's also another bus almost as close. Parking privileges were available. The host was friendly and had magazines and DVD's available. I enjoyed Seattle and my stay at the condo.
5315169,39915479,2015-07-27,18257419,Christina,My family and I went to Seattle for a baseball game. Barbara was a great host. Very responsive and friendly. The apartment was is in a really convenient spot and super easy to access. Everything we needed. Had a great time. 
5315169,41080184,2015-08-04,34199296,Wolfgang,"The Appartement was as described. As it is in the Souterrain it's quite dark. But you're here to visit Seattle not to stay in the Appartement. 

Barbara gave us a very warm welcome. With four people and a few days stay the Appartement is the right choice. Downtown is within walking distance. The neighborhood makes a real save impression. 

We would make the same choice with Barbara's Appartement next time. 

Thanks for everything. "
5315169,45243463,2015-09-01,16095392,Moody,"Easy check-in, great location, really nice and large space. Barbara was a great host and let us know everything we needed to know and left us some snacks which were a pleasant surprise. Had no issues with the suite, though it can be a bit noisy in the morning when people walk around upstairs or talk loudly outside - but we were getting up pretty early anyways so it wasn't a big deal at all."
5315169,46153942,2015-09-08,26796563,Cassidy,"The second we walked in, we were very pleased with our stay; the apartment was clean, and we had everything we needed to have a great stay. If you are staying in Seattle, there is no greater place to spend your nights. "
5315169,47045098,2015-09-15,31365187,Nicola,A great apartment in a great location. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed for my stay. Thank you
5315169,48869402,2015-09-29,35520336,Paul,"Host was great, and was able to accommodate for us when we landed a bit earlier than expected. The house is exactly as listed: comfortable and very sweet. For travelers and tourists to the city, the location is absolutely prime. It's a 15 minute walk to downtown/Pikes Place, and a very short Uber to anywhere else. Highly recommended!"
5315169,49775231,2015-10-06,19475084,Megan,We had an amazing experience staying at Barbara's apartment. It is walkable to all of the great neighborhoods. We never waited more than 3-4 minutes for an uber driver.  She was prompt in the communication department and let us keep our bags there after check out. The snacks and fresh flowers were an added bonus! We will definitely book with her again!
5315169,50440630,2015-10-12,22620894,Amber,The location was great for where we needed to be and instructions were clear on entry and use of the apartment.  We enjoyed our stay and the place was the perfect size for our small group.  
5315169,50759714,2015-10-14,42675937,Vivienne,Barbara was not available to greet us in person but had made sure we could gain access easily and had sent welcoming messages in advance and information about the accommodation in the flat for when we arrived.
5315169,52076331,2015-10-26,16580948,Tim,Barbara's place was in a great location and the perfect size for the two of us.  She was very accommodating to our early check-in and late check-out request.  We would definitely consider staying here again the next time we are in Seattle.
5315169,52833350,2015-11-02,12405920,Audrey,"We stayed in Barbara's apartment for a weekend. We were welcomed with instructions, fresh flowers, and local Washington snacks! It was well maintained and the perfect size the two of us. Barbara was great in communicating with check-in and recommendations of nearby bars; she was always available by phone or text. The apartment's neighborhood felt safe and was perfect - walking distance to great restaurants and bars. At times parking was difficult to find after 5pm, but it was Halloween weekend and we walked most places anyways! Thank you Barbara! I would definitely book with you again. :)  "
5315169,54249670,2015-11-17,45467343,Tamara,"Barbara had local snacks (chocolate and chips) waiting for us on the table.  She shared a few of her favorite local spots as well.  She responded to emails quickly.  I received a parking ticket even though I had the parking pass on rear view mirror.  I believe the parking agent only looked at my expired meter ticket on the passenger side window so make sure you don't have expired tickets in view.

The neighborhood is convenient to coffee, food, groceries (QFC and drug stores).  We didn't use the car once in three days but we did use Uber a lot as even though apartment is walkable to Pike Place (12 blocks), it was raining and my daughter's back was sore.  Washer n dryer are a few steps away outside the door.

The apartment is basement level so expect some noise but it didn't bother us.   "
5315169,54700384,2015-11-23,70980,Maddie,Barbara was great! Place was clean and in the perfect location. Nothing super fancy but exactly what we needed. Check in and out could not have been easier 
5315169,55379482,2015-12-01,45457657,Katja,We felt very welcom from the beginning on as Barbara left us a detailed description of the environment including some insider tips. The neighbourhood is nice and calm with some shops nearby (Starbucks and Supermarket).
5315169,56600141,2015-12-15,2246448,Jason,"Arrived to a very clean and welcoming apartment. Barbara left us some local snacks which was great. Easy access to the building and a safe neighborhood. Barbara responded to questions very quickly and even offered local advice. Apartment was well located near bars, restaurants and cafe's. Only small hangup was finding street parking with the guest pass after arriving in the evening on a Friday night. Parking was easy the rest of the weekend. "
5315169,57124185,2015-12-22,46671437,Neil,"Barbara did a great job making our first moments in the apartment feel welcome as we were greeted with some local goodies and a guide on her favourite restaurants and nearby grocery store (which was a lifesaver!) Great location - cots under $10 with Uber to get to where we wanted to go, which was mostly the downtown area. The apartment was the perfect size for the four of us who stayed there and it was easy to get in to the apartment, as well as clean and lock up when it was time to check out. Will definitely be staying in this place again when we return to Seattle!"
5315169,57518641,2015-12-27,15503774,Cherrie,"Barbara was awesome! She was very responsive and welcoming. We arrived a little early but she was accommodating and helped us move in the luggage to the flat while we explored the city. Her apartment is also very very clean and cute and cozy! the best we've stayed at during this 10 day trip in US :) safe and clean neighborhood. Her little touch on the snacks were also very heartwarming, pity we only had 2 days in town, would love to come back!"

4438871,34590814,2015-06-09,2007389,Allison,Paval was great. We booked within the same week and needed special accommodation for bike storage and odd checking in/out hours. He made this trip very easy and comfortable!

4438871,35620979,2015-06-20,35912572,Regina,"We really appreciated our stay at Pavel's. He was very accommodating of our wacky schedule and was available for questions. The room is as described - large, clean, well-lit, bathroom in the same area of the basement. The neighborhood was lovely and quiet with some great eating options nearby (we loved Morsel and Bean for breakfast). We were delightfully surprised by Pavel's wonderful book collection which you can see pictured - it was varied, interesting and seemingly personal. Staying at Pavel's felt like staying in the guest room of a kind, neat and intellectual family member."
4438871,35730961,2015-06-21,416155,Brad & Becca,"Personable, polite, responsive host.  Clean and comfortable accommodation.  Convenient location."

4438871,36638294,2015-06-29,4527691,Philip,"Pavel was very welcoming and friendly. He did his best to accommodate me during my stay. The room is as described, large and clean and in a quiet neighbourhood."
4438871,41457236,2015-08-07,26875426,Agnes,"Staying at Pavels house in ballard was a quiet and pleasant experience. ..the room was neat and airy....with a separate entrance u will find all the privacy u can get but u are also allowed into this apartment upstairs where u can cook or hang out...getting there with the 28 bus takes no time from downtown, sometimes I stopped in Fremont for dinner. ..
I would absolutely go back. ..."

Plenty of clean towels with a sink and mini-fridge on the same level. Pavel was a generous host who aims to keep you comfortable throughout your stay. I'll definitely check on availability the next time I need a room in Seattle!"
7534812,42069723,2015-08-10,40330067,Jason,"This place is newly renovated, and renovated well.  It is the bottom floor  in the picture -- the entrance is at the bottom right, not the big orange door at left.  Dedicated parking spot.  The administration is by Pillow, and their system did a good job of getting me up to speed on how things worked and getting us in and out without hassles.  New furniture and appliances throughout.  Hope that this place is open next time we come to Seattle!"
7534812,46249443,2015-09-08,10607295,Xay,"It was a very pleasant stay. The place was very very clean and well kept. The kitchen was convenient for cooking or heating up food, there was plenty of cups and dishes for us to use. There was nice fresh towels in the bathroom and the beds were comfy. Galina was a great host, very quick and responsive no matter what time of the day! Anything we needed to know she would respond kindly immediately. Overall great experience! "
7534812,51044338,2015-10-17,44069761,Mohammed,"It is a very clean, comfortable, quite and safe unit. The location is very convenient as there is a bus stop nearby. QFC, safeway, target and a mall are within walking distance.
The host was very welcoming. She was swift un having the heaters fixed with8n two days. During this period she provided portables heaters. 
I felt like i was in my home and definitely i will try to rent this unit again when I visit Seattle."
1246117,20468911,2014-09-29,21334322,Kate,Best house in the best place! I stayed here for a weekend with friends and we had a fabulous time. West Seattle is gorgeous and super fun. The house is beautiful and in the perfect location. There was wine and snacks awaiting our arrival. Everything was clean and looked even better than the pictures. We loved the balconies and backyard. We also loved the super comfortable beds :) We will most definitely be returning ASAP. 
1246117,21392527,2014-10-16,19332909,Aaron,"What a great home Steve and his wife have.  Very warm and tastefully decorated.   Great location and amenities.  Steve was very accommodating--he communicated well, checked in to see if everything was okay during our stay, and was overall very helpful and available.   I would stay there again in a heart beat!  "

1246117,22887955,2014-11-17,5285777,Ed & Nancy,"Steve and Vanessa has a great house !
Fit easy 6 People , we stayed 4 weeks and had he great time .
West Seattle is a nice and relax place to stay with nice  views, beaches and good restaurants.
Steve is super easy to connect and reacts fast when needed.
I will recommend this house and book it again when family 
come over .
"
1246117,23011889,2014-11-20,18145508,Clark,"Steve made us feel very welcome and the listing was completely accurate.  A bottle of wine was waiting for us. The house is well furnished and all the extras needed to make us feel at home were there. Our daughter and her family live nearby, so the location is excellent for us.  The view of the water and the surrounding mountains from the upper level was an added benefit.  We look forward to staying in Steve's house the next time we are in West Seattle."
1246117,23278826,2014-11-27,8575372,Lisa,Great house. Enjoyed our stay. Great host. Would stay here again. Thanks!
1246117,23325285,2014-11-29,9614821,Brenda,Steve and Vanessa have a charming home.  The kitchen is equipped well and we found each of the beds to be quite comfortable.  The house is a short walk to the water and in a warm and very friendly neighborhood...several neighbors greeted us.  My 3 adult sons and I stayed here for Thanksgiving.  We felt entirely at home and enjoyed our stay thoroughly.  We wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
1246117,23474183,2014-12-01,10156843,Tariq,"We loved staying in Steve's house. it was a quick drive to downtown Seattle, but far enough away to not feel like you're in the middle of the city. Bedrooms were clean, and very comfortable, many parking spot, close to every thing. Awesome experience, would definitely stay there again!"
1246117,25032207,2015-01-05,24173583,Henry,"This house was warm and clean.   The kitchen setup was fantastic.  Also he has an awesome vinyl collection which you can groove out to as well.

When we first got to the house there was a nice welcome basket with a bottle of wine and clear instructions for the wifi and other necessities.

Park was ample and and convenient.

Overall everything was great staying here and I'd do it again if given the chance."
1246117,25144293,2015-01-07,6958564,Kenneth,"Steve's house is superb. It is spacious for 6 of us. The bedrooms are comfortable. The kitchen is well equipped. The bathrooms are clean. It is a very lovely place to stay.

I like the wine. It was an excellent touch that I felt welcomed.

The house is not far from city. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful. I will choose Steve's house again next time I visit Seattle.

January 2015"
1246117,26782335,2015-02-19,14859570,Luke,"Steve was an incredibly gracious and generous host. My film partner and I stayed in his home for a little over a month, seeking a peaceful sanctuary in which we could work. The home is perfect for anyone seeking that type of environment without sacrificing convenience, location, and all that West Seattle has to offer.

The beds are all incredibly comfortable, and the home is well equipped for anyone who enjoys to cook. I will point out that the coffee maker does not have an automatic shut-off. I did not recognize that and 'cooked' a pot of coffee for a little too long one morning.

I recommend booking with Steve without hesitation. "
1246117,27051426,2015-02-24,10325082,Cuong,"Steve was a great host for my stay in Seattle, Washington. He was easy to communicate with and quick to respond to any of my questions when needed. I felt very comfortable with the whole process of booking his AirBnB and was completely satisfied with the experience. The listing description was accurate - the place was spacious, clean, and comfortable. Everything we needed such as travel essentials was provided which was awesome! The neighborhood was quiet - very relaxing and perfect for anyone who wants to get away from any busy city."
1246117,27544700,2015-03-07,27618474,Jon,"Steve's home was a great place that fit all of our needs.  The neighborhood was very nice and the house was quite charming.
Was nice and close for visiting seattle center and pike place.

Thanks Steve for letting us stay here."
1246117,27810160,2015-03-12,11416147,Yi,"Superb house, and everything is prepared, like shampoo, soup, and etc.. It takes about fifteen minutes to drive to Pike Market, and Safeway is close to the house. This house has a nice view from the balcony, and it is very quiet. I will still live here when I visit Seattle next time."
1246117,28072870,2015-03-17,26083128,Chad,"Steve and Vanessa's house was very easy to find and it is in a great neighbourhood with lots of cool stores, pubs, and restaurants nearby. The house was clean with plenty of space for two families. Steve made us feel welcome from the moment we sent in our date request. I would definitely recommend staying in the area to see a different part of Seattle."
1246117,28407892,2015-03-23,26641167,Kristin,"We absolutely loved Steve's West Seattle home.  As a group of 7 girls who were wandering the streets of downtown Seattle, we adored having such a gorgeous, quiet and comfortable neighborhood to return to at the end of the day.  It is a lovely location and we found all the beds to be very very comfortable.  We adored having our own kitchen, living room, free parking, relaxing environment and a much more reasonable price point than the multiple hotel rooms we would've had to get to house us all.  We also loved exploring the neighborhood, walking down to the beach, and driving the short distance to Alki beach and surrounding small towns.  I would definitely recommend Steve's home to anyone looking for a place to stay in this area."
1246117,28708474,2015-03-29,27187459,James,"We loved the house!  Nice quiet neighborhood, easy drive to all the downtown attractions (aquarium, space needle, harbor cruise, etc) plus close to Alki beach (the kids love tide pools, lots of shells to see, we even saw about 5 starfish).  The house has a great little kitchen, big table for eating at, and plenty of places to relax after a day on the go.  The instructions for everything were simple, and they really made the stay so easy.  Would definitely recommend."
1246117,28983248,2015-04-02,26001139,Holly,"We had a wonderful time at Steve's house! We had a college girls get together, and it was in a safe and comfortable neighborhood. We couldn't have chosen a better place!  I would definitely recommend Steve's house to anyone traveling to West Seattle. He seems like he's been doing this a long time and has it down to a science, completely hassle-free. The place was clean and comfortably slept five people. We cooked a lot in the kitchen was very functional. I am hoping to be able to return again someday!"
1246117,33902243,2015-06-02,28943051,Mark,"Steve and Vanessa were as wonderful and gracious hosts as one could ever expect. These are quality individuals who went out of their way to make our family feel comfortable. Their home was very nice, comfortable, and well appointed. The neighborhood is quiet, right in the heart of West Seattle, walking distance to a handful of excellent bars and restaurants, and an easy drive to anywhere else you want to go. Their home would be an excellent choice for anybody who wants to experience West Seattle. "
1246117,37639324,2015-07-09,28637926,Alania,When we got there it was way hot but it cooled down quick it was nice and big... I was able to prepare and make meals it was very nice
1246117,39592822,2015-07-25,26002853,Derek,Great house and a great location in Seattle. Easy access to all of the activities we wanted to do but also away from downtown to have some quiet time. Lots of space for my family of 5. Steve was very responsive and easy to communicate with. I would definitely recommend and stay here again if the opportunity came up. 
1246117,41924660,2015-08-10,30122687,Gabriel,Host was very friendly and he helped us accommodate with our early arrival time. It is a very comfortable home located in a quiet beautiful neighborhood. Plenty of places at walking distance and its a short bus ride from downtown. A great way to experience a part of Seattle.
1246117,42647913,2015-08-15,25254589,Laura,"Steve and Vanessa's home was beautiful,  spacious and well equipped with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  The location was perfect for us to enjoy the sights of Seattle but also spending time at local parks and beaches in West Seattle.   There was a slight mixup with the cleaning before we arrived but as soon as I notified Steve he went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable.  I definitely would stay here again."

8567933,50236708,2015-10-10,9467509,Emily,"The apartment is new to Airbnb, and Ellen did a great job getting everything ready for us.  Ellen was excellent with all communication regarding this listing, and went out of her way to accommodate us on short notice.  The space was clean, open, and well-maintained, and exactly as advertised, definitely more than enough space for the two of us.  We used the kitchen, the wireless internet, and the laundry facilities in the basement.  Everything worked great!  There are many wonderful restaurants and sites within walking distance of this quiet property, and is on one of the main bus routes to downtown Seattle.  Next time we need a place to stay in Ballard, we will be back!  Thanks so much Ellen!!  "

It was hard for us to leave. The process to get into the house was great! Ellen is very accomadating and quick to respond! We will definitely be back!!!"
8567933,53780898,2015-11-12,13974527,Jenny,"This was just what we needed! Cutely decorated, comfortable and clean. "
8567933,54251533,2015-11-17,8513702,Maya,"Gorgeous place. Loved the vintage tile in one of the bedrooms. Perfect size for the 5 of us (two couples and one single). Very clean, spacious, bright, easy parking, easy to get to, and close to shopping. The loft had all the amenities we needed, with one exception: an iron. We cooked several meals and everything we needed was there. Road noise is fairly loud in the front bedroom, but can't hear it anywhere else in the house. Overall, an excellent choice for our 5 day stay in Seattle."
8567933,54678673,2015-11-22,4508600,Kathy,Lovely home right in the heart of Ballard. Quick communication. Thank you for our stay!

8567933,56070176,2015-12-08,49738455,Jennifer,"Ellen was amazing! Great communication and answered every question I had. The Ballard Charmer was perfect for the 5 members of my family and the perfect location among shops and restaurants. Thank you Ellen & Seattle, we had a great stay. "
8567933,56916504,2015-12-20,8816581,Simeon,"We were spending just one night here as we had come to Seattle to visit friends. We're a family of 5 (parents plus kids ages 3, 5, and 7). We really didn't do much here other than sleep for the night and eat breakfast in the morning.

The space was great for what we wanted and would have been comfortable to stay for a week or so. Neighborhood was quiet. We went just up the street to Larsen's bakery for some delicious pastries for breakfast. The space looks very nice, although a lot of the furnishings are old (sink & bathtub particularly).

Overall, a comfy place to stay in Seattle!"
3561108,17398214,2014-08-11,19233740,Heath,Joe made us feel very welcome. The description of the house was very accurate and the neighborhood very centrally located for our needs. 
3561108,17591946,2014-08-14,19357776,Amanda,"Joe was great and the place is absolutely beautiful. Joe dropped me off by a great bookstore the first day after I checked in. He even drew me a map of things to do close by. The neighborhood is gorgeous, plenty of things to do and close to the bus stop. Joe even dropped me off at the next place I stayed at after check-out. I'd stay there again most definitely. "
3561108,18141962,2014-08-22,19750271,Ann,"Joe, the owner was great, and the location was perfect.  The home could use a more detailed professional cleaning..... But all in all it worked out well for us. "
3561108,18669537,2014-08-30,18611893,Robert,"Joe is a fantastic host and incredibly nice.  The neighborhood is great, so the house has a great location, walkable to restaurants and Whole Foods in Roosevelt.  And Joe's home is a really sweet house.  "
3561108,18818911,2014-09-01,19258531,Nicole,"We had a wonderful time staying at Joe's house. It's a beautiful home in a really cute and accessible neighborhood with a good coffee shop nearby. Joe was a great host, greeting us as we arrived and making us feel very welcome (he even brought fruit from his garden) and we would definitely stay again next time we're in Seattle!"
3561108,23428785,2014-12-01,20906480,Margaret,"Joe made us feel welcome by 
meeting me at a convenient time, explaining all we needed to know, responding promptly to a small, and providing a bottle of Proseccco for our Thanksgiving dinner. 
The description of the property was accurate; the neighborhood pleasant and very convenient. "
3561108,33159909,2015-05-25,33045017,Tommy,Joe's cottage was a great place to stay. This was my first air bnb excursion and if this is any indication of how they are in general then I'm done with hotels. The house is kinda quirky but in a good way. Joe waited up for us even though we were a bit late getting in with another bottle of wine waiting for us...nice touch.
3561108,34376638,2015-06-07,2777245,Clementine,"The cottage was as describe and in a great neighborhood close to the University District and beautiful Greenlake. The place was easy to find. Easy access to the 5 interstate or even the Aurora Bridge  to get downtown/Seattle Center. Also, if you are taking a bus - it's close to Roosevelt which has buses that take about 30 minutes to downtown.  Joe, unfortunately, could not greet us but left a bottle of wine and chocolates! His daughter  met us and was very accommodating since we arrived a few hours after our initial intended time (in which we were able to communicate with her). 

The space is nice, older cottage, two beds (a larger more comfortable bed and a smaller bed, which my friend had trouble sleeping on - could be, just a matter of opinion). Kitchen, dining and living areas with eclectic decoration. Bathroom was clean with fresh towels and toiletries for our needs.  Very lovely garden in the back of the house and a narrow drive way for a vehicle. 

This was one of the best Airbnb spots I have encountered and for a great price. A perfect way to visit Seattle and enjoy a nice little getaway."
3561108,34959252,2015-06-14,20904781,John & Lori,"This house was a wonderful place to stay!  We were welcomed with a delicious bottle of wine and coconut chocolates.  The beds were comfortable and the common spaces (both inside and outside) were inviting.  The claw food tub was amazing- especially with the heated floor in the bathroom!  We used to live in the Ravenna/Roosevelt neighborhood, and found it an easy walk to access local shops (groceries, restaurants, and cafes) and public transportation from the house.  We particularly enjoyed the quiet- lots of foliage and a sleepy street."
3561108,35327591,2015-06-17,5347826,Rachel,"Joes house is beautiful, well located and wonderful to stay in. Joe and his daughters are a great hosts, left me wine and chocolate, and we're pleasant to interact with. Communication was good and accurate. Loved the house, want one just like it.  "
3561108,35673162,2015-06-21,32973457,Abigail,"Joe was a great host! He greeted us with a bottle of wine and fresh strawberries, and provided all the information we needed for a good stay in Seattle. The house is lovely and was perfect for us -- comfy beds, kitchen supplies, and a pretty backyard garden. There are restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance, and public transportation to downtown is close and easy. Would definitely stay here again -- thanks Joe!"
3561108,37229160,2015-07-05,23906639,Ken,"Nice clean little house that was perfect for our visit. We didn’t spend too much time there, just breakfast and nights.  Joe was very friendly and welcomed us with wine and chocolate. He made us feel very comfortable. The location was perfect, with lots of cool restaurants, green lake, and close to UW. Parking is tight but we always had a spot either on the street or in the drive way. Thanks for having us Joe.  "
3561108,37852509,2015-07-11,23400294,Christina,"Joe was extremely welcoming. He met us at the rental and walked us through the house. He was also very thorough with the explanation of how things worked in the house. It was very spacious and charming and the neighborhood felt pretty safe. I think that if we needed to stay somewhere of this size, we would stay here again."
3561108,38205609,2015-07-13,17216840,Josephine,"We were all very happy with our airbnb experience at Joe's lovely place. Our plans for the day were up in the air, and he was very flexible about finding a good time to meet to give us the key and other pertinent information. He had a bottle of wine and chocolate for us to enjoy during our stay! The cottage is bigger than we expected, which was a plus. The neighborhood was quite, the house was easy to locate and situated in a great location (near lots of restaurants, supermarket, access to I5). The space was just what we needed to relax after a long day of being a tourist in downtown Seattle!  "
3561108,38928670,2015-07-19,35237716,Scott,"Joe's place was exactly as advertised and pictured. The neighborhood is so centrally located it made a big difference while traveling in Seattle's notorious traffic. Joe is a great guy, and Luisa is very sweet, they are very kind and responsive. A great bottle of wine, some chocolates, a bowl of fruit and pretty flowers were very welcoming. The house is bigger than expected, and is equipped with everything you need to have a great stay. Would definitely recommend it to people."
3561108,39779286,2015-07-26,17331227,Unique,"It's my first try on airbnb and had a great experience in Joe' s house. It's clean, cozy and located in a beautiful neighborhood about 10 min driving away from downtown. Joe is so nice and gave us a couple of travel tips. Hope we had more days there."
3561108,42362773,2015-08-12,1857087,Peter,"Joe was a great host, even though I never met him.  I arrived very late at night and he was excellent with communication about the arrival time and arranging easy access to the house.  The space was clean and felt fun with lovely high ceilings, and had a delectable kitchen and rear deck/yard area.  The neighbour hood was very quiet, and yet it was easy to get access to and from and have a decent selection of food and other fun just steps away."
3561108,43309756,2015-08-18,24807625,Xiuxian,"This beautiful house is located in a quiet and safe neighborhood. It takes only a few minutes' walk to a variety of restaurants and the whole food market. There were many beautiful Mexican textiles in the house and it was great to have piano, guitar and bells, which definitely has added a lot of fun during our short stay. Joe and Luisa were great host. We arrived two hours' late but they were still waiting for us. They walked us through and explained the house quite thoroughly. From Joe we also got many great suggestions about where to go in Seattle. Thanks Joe and Luisa! It was nice meeting you!"
3561108,44827469,2015-08-29,40718068,Carmen,"I unfortunately had a late check in on account of a surprise layover but Joe was still very accommodating. He told me not to worry and even called my friend who had to arrive solo to make sure she got in ok. He left a hand written note, some chocolates, and a darn good bottle of wine. The cottage was wonderful, comfy, and I especially loved the interior decor. The neighborhood  was quiet although we were only there late nights and early mornings.  There was always parking down the street. "
3561108,46036166,2015-09-07,14479867,Sheri,The house was exactly as described. We found the house easily and it was in a nice neighborhood. 
3561108,47685973,2015-09-21,11282801,Amira,"The cottage was absolutely perfect! Such a sweet spot, located in a great neighborhood  and close to many shops all within walking distance. Our flight got in pretty late but Joe was a great, communicative host and gave us easy instructions for finding the cottage. We also very much appreciated the amazing treats he left out for us- made us feel at home right away. This was a wonderful place to stay ( so much better than staying in any hotel!) and I only wish we could have stayed longer. Next time :)"
3561108,48446516,2015-09-26,2004891,Darwin Lopez Tsurumi,"We found this cozy cottage a delightful retreat tucked into a welcoming and convenient neighborhood - we especially loved being able to walk to Whole Foods for breakfast foods past a historical high school and streets full of happy kids. Joe was very communicative but unobtrusive (we actually never saw him!). All in all, we felt we were having a true Seattle neighborhood experience, and were happy to be dropping my son off to his dorm at the University of Washington after our stay in the friendly city!"
3561108,55926978,2015-12-07,14565892,Niki,The host was very friendly and helpful. The listing was an accurate description and a convenient location. This space worked out very well for visiting family members.
8308316,47939210,2015-09-21,5162952,Lauren,"I travel to Seattle a few times a year so I've gotten to know properties and this is a fabulous apartment. It is cozy with beautiful furnishings and I felt comfortable being in this home.

I also liked being on a quiet street with the ability to get downtown in minutes. I would definitely stay here again.

Kim was very helpful and made the trip easy. "
8308316,48450810,2015-09-26,12807577,Joshua,"kimberly was super nice to us, and gave us some suggestions of things happening in the city and most importantly some great places to eat!

Will definitely be staying here next time I'm in Seattle.  It's very convenient to get to anywhere in Seattle from the apartment.   Thanks Kim!"
8308316,50126169,2015-10-09,4327081,Soren,"We had a wonderful stay at this charming apartment. It has a great view and was spotless. There are some cafes and grocery stores in walking distance and buses to get to downtown. Kimberly was very kind and helpful, provided us with recommendations for a rainy day we experienced ;-) and was easy to communicate with. Would definitely recommend this home away from home if you'd like to stay in a nice neighborhood in Seattle."
8308316,53385269,2015-11-08,45375365,Terrence,"Kimberly is an excellent host. Very responsive and accommodative. I felt like I was staying at relatives. Her home is cozy and has an ""at home feel."" Highly recommend this location and any of Kimberly's locations. Thank you!"

Wonderful location and breath taking views of Seattle.
The apt had everything one could possibly need.
Walking distance to restaurants, shops and coffee stops.
Perfect for 3-4 people.
We always appreciate having a kitchen and was treated to the gourmet touches.
"
8308316,56937786,2015-12-20,25601916,Meghan,"The apartment is great. Really cozy and comfortable! Also in a great spot in queen anne. Only a 10 to 15 minute walk down the hill to the space needle. Even though I never met Kimberly face to face, she would respond promptly if I had a question. Thanks!"
5364244,27410896,2015-03-03,26737848,Alex,"This guest house is perfect for a weekend trip or an extended stay. The first floor bedroom is comfortable and quite with a large closet and washer/dryer. The second floor has a small (but very well equipped) kitchen, a full bathroom and large living area space (including TV and WiFi). The skylights all along the ceiling add bright natural light during the day and make it a great spot to spend some time in the morning before heading out. The guest house has a separate entrance from the back of the property and a parking spot, so access was a breeze. 

I live in the Loyal Heights neighborhood and can attest to the great location of this guest house (quiet neighborhood that is very convenient to Ballard and an easy trip to downtown). My parents came to visit for an extended stay and really loved the guest house. Considering the quality of the nearby hotels and how expensive the nice ones are this place is a steal. You get a lot of living space for a reasonable rate. Finally, Kassy was very responsive to the questions we had and was easy to work with. We will definitely be using this guest house in the future. "
5364244,28808962,2015-03-30,28591804,Chuck,"A vase of tulips greeted me as I entered the kitchen area, along with a note welcoming me and indicating that if I had any questions to contact Kassy by texting her.  Also a nice package of coffee was on the table.  The neighborhood was great.  It was quiet and peaceful.  The interior was immaculate and very cozy.  The bed was comfortable and the shower was very good.  I moved around the kitchen with ease, making myself completely at home.  I had an excellent stay.    "
5364244,34350501,2015-06-07,29664712,Shereen,"Kassy's guest house is beautiful. We kept commenting on how nice everything was. The bed was comfortable, the shower and bathroom were very nice. There is plenty of light and the sky lights with the trees above them made the ambience that much better. She had coffee ready for us and creamer in the refrigerator. She also was easy to get in touch with and would answer my questions in a very timely manner. 
We loved the location and it was convenient having our own parking place. I would highly recommend this location for anyone with a car for transportation (we didn't use public transportation; it seems that this location would not be ideal for that).  "
5364244,34741648,2015-06-11,33203551,Zach,"This property was fantastic. The neighborhood was quiet and not too far from downtown. There was more than enough room, the TV's were massive, the bed was extremely comfy, and I was completely undisturbed which allowed me to work in peace in the evenings. There was coffee and cold creamer available, soap/shampoo/conditioner in the shower, fluffy towels, and a dedicated parking space. Definitely would recommend to others and will definitely try and stay here again in the future."
5364244,35467872,2015-06-19,5451748,Zosia,We had a great week long stay at Kassy's place in Loyal Heights. Very well set-up and good use of space. Skylights add good natural light.  Love the location off a quiet laneway in Loyal Heights. Kassy was very welcoming and responsive during our stay. Would happily recommend to others.
5364244,36780844,2015-07-01,32869127,Jason,"
Our stay at the guest house was delightful. Eventhough it was warmer than usual in Seattle, we were pleased to find the house cool, with fans already running - upon our arrival.
The location is ideal for morning walks! The neighborhood is quiet and a park overlooking the water is less than 10 minutes away. 
Having an off road reserved parking spot was a big bonus!"

A beautiful park where you can watch the sunset, a cafe, and a good bakery are all within walking distance.  The house was very comfortable, quiet, and private.  Towels and sheets were provided and there were some basic toiletries (pump bottles of shampoo, conditioner, and body wash) which is a huge plus if you're traveling with carry on luggage only. "
5364244,37711711,2015-07-09,16654966,Caroline,"Fabulous house, absolutely immaculate. Kassy was very helpful with everything and a great location for our holiday.

The place is very nice, we wanted for nothing. Very accessible to all Ballard had to offer, and we actually found it very easy to take the bus downtown from here as well (the bus stop is only about 8 min walk). "
5364244,38871752,2015-07-19,11429605,Laura,We spent 1 night at the guest house and we were very happy with our stay. Kassy was very responsive and helpful. The guest house is private and well equipped. We were able to walk to a cafe and then explore Golden Gardens park in the morning. We would definitely stay there again.
5364244,39212811,2015-07-21,37368082,Scott,I enjoyed my stay at this guest house. It was very clean and having a washer and dryer to use was super! The bed was very comfortable and the kitchen was well equipped.

5364244,40204332,2015-07-29,4675089,Alanna,We loved this cozy and clean guesthouse! There is nothing better than coming into town after a 12 hour drive arriving to a bed with high thread count sheets. Luxury! Would highly recommend Kassy's guest house 
5364244,40499648,2015-07-31,38269706,Katelan,"Kassy's guest house was perfect for my husband and I while we were in Seattle! It was clean, modern, and the perfect size! All appliances and amenities seemed new and everything was exactly as Kassy described. The neighborhood was very quiet and close to Golden Gardens Park, which was exactly what we were looking for. Kassy was always quick to respond and she provided all necessary details without being asked. Overall, we loved staying here and even said we wish Kassy could come decorate our home! "
5364244,40712084,2015-08-02,28635070,Carrie,Staying at the Loyal Heights Guest House was a wonderful experience!!  This was our first time using Airbnb and the process worked beautifully.  Kassy quickly responded to all our questions throughout the process.  We LOVED the house and location.  The home is spotless and maintained beautifully.  (There's even a washer and dryer!).  We couldn't have asked for a better experience and the Loyal Heights Guest House will definitely be our home-away-from-home in the future!!
5364244,41142327,2015-08-04,35524012,Lisa,"We had a great experience.  The guest house was very clean and comfortable,  and was well maintained.

5364244,43060563,2015-08-17,36395687,Dawn,"We loved this place! It is more beautiful than the pictures show with every detail well thought out. Everything is very luxurious from the towels, blankets and sheets to the very complete kitchen with dishes, glasses, silverware and appliances. My husband said the downstairs bedroom was a perfect nest for rest and relaxation. The storage closet with laundry machines was perfect to keep all of our luggage out of the way. The location was perfect for us and very quiet with parking included. We walked to several local parks and coffee shops.  Sunset Hill Park is only 5 or 6 blocks away and has a beautiful view of the Sound for enjoying sunsets. Golden Gardens Park with a nice sandy beach is only a little over a mile hike  (hike because of the winding path and 100 or so steps down over the cliff)
We did get a quick chance to meet Kassy and she was very warm and welcoming. We were coming from another vacation rental with groceries and she had no problem with letting us drop them off in the refrigerator before check-in time. We really aprreciated this and the chance to meet her. We had absolutely no other need to contact her during our stay. Also, all other communication prior to our visit was quick and helpful
We will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Ballard visiting relatives. The price is more than fair for how beautifully done this guest house is. Thanks Kassy!"

We very much appreciated our space, and with the fence between the guest house and the main house, had complete privacy. Everything was clean and comfortable, and the cable TV was great for downtime. Loved our time here in Seattle and in the neighborhood, and Kassy's listing was perfect for a quiet stay."

The cottage was exactly as described and even better.  It was very clean, fresh, new and comfortable and very private and quiet.  Kitchen was well equipped.  There is allot of natural light in the upstairs living area with 5 skylights with beautiful trees above. We had some very busy days and found the cottage to be a quiet retreat. The neighborhood was lovely with beautiful old homes. one evening we walked down to sunset park with a fabulous view of the water and harbor.  Another day we took a nice walk to golden garden park, it was a good hike back up but very doable, We felt 
very lucky to have found Kassys' cottage and 
will definitely book her place again if we are in the area.   "

My family and I had a great experience in the Loyal Heights Guest House. The setup was perfect as it allowed for plenty of space for a family of four during a three day stay. The amenities were great and as described.  The bed in the lower level is fantastic; this provided restful sleep after a day's activities.    The guest house itself is immaculate, like Martha Stewart just breezed through.  The location provided easy access to activities in Seattle and beyond.   This site was great and we would use again when in the area. "
5364244,52879337,2015-11-02,46008112,Kira,"The Loyal Heights Guest House was PERFECT!  It's quiet, cozy and super clean. Kassy is the most gracious hostess. She responds quickly to questions and keeps the guest house stocked with fluffy towels, fantastic new bedding and everything you need in the kitchen.  The house is ideally located in north Ballard in a quiet neighborhood with access to great Ballard shopping and restaurants. We will absolutely stay again."
5364244,54386155,2015-11-19,46847838,Andy,"Kassy's Guest House worked very well as a home base for our family of four while having some remodeling completed on our house (which is five minutes away).  The guest house is very clean, well maintained, and includes all the comforts of home.  

Kassy was a gracious and responsive host, and even dropped off several items (that we inadvertently left) at our house afterwards.  

All in all, highly recommended and we will likely use Kassy's guest house in the future for when family visits from out of town."
5364244,54980485,2015-11-27,6439785,Martha,"Kassy's Guest House was perfect for us as our daughter lives nearby in Ballard.  It was a nice 30 minute walk for us.  The apartment was very clean, comfortable and well equipped for our stay.  "
5364244,57364608,2015-12-25,17076645,Tyler,"Great place, excellent communication!"
7110655,38781251,2015-07-18,8236763,Matt,Check in and check out with Ross were super easy. He was very flexible about meeting with me. He was super nice and gave me a great description of the local area.
7110655,39226720,2015-07-21,7380397,Cheryl,"The rental was wonderful and the perfect size for our needs. Immaculately clean and well kept, and the bus/rail station is just 2 blocks away (making the trip back to the airport very easy). The check-in/out was seamless and we were even granted our request to keep our luggage in the apartment (in essence, checking out after 4pm!) until we had to depart for the airport. This was a fantastic place to spend our weekend visiting friends!"
7110655,39830001,2015-07-26,15741686,Jason,"Cozy apartment! And, well located in the middle of downtown, near the stadium. And perfect for taking the Link rail to/from the airport. Admittedly, was surprised there was no wifi, but my bad for not reading the listing more carefully..."
7110655,40256637,2015-07-29,578872,Tammy,"We stayed at Ross & Lauren's studio for 3 nights. Check-in was a breeze and though we didn't connect with Ross or Lauren in person, they were communicative before and during our stay. The space is perfect for two and had everything we needed. The location is very close to everything downtown and all the touristy sites we planned to go to. We appreciated and utilized the printed out recommendations and went to the grocery store they recommended in the International District. The couple of points that were not really a bother to us but may be challenging for others: The main window with cool views overlooking the city is not covered and was very bright in the morning and right next to the bed. This apartment is located fairly close to a fire station so you'll hear sirens periodically. Also, there must have been a cat or dog residing in the space previously because there's a little bit of an odor and my allergies were activated. Nothing a Claritin can't cure but it may be bothersome for others."
7110655,40969661,2015-08-03,24271080,Caitlin,A clean and tidy place. Absolutely perfect for my stay.
7110655,41054045,2015-08-03,39251183,Geetika,The host canceled this reservation 24 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7110655,42166384,2015-08-11,38040794,Laken,"This was our first time using Airbnb & we will definitely be using it again in the future. Ross was very welcoming over the phone, wanted to make sure that we didn't have any doubts being 1st time users. Even with them being out of town they had a friend, Mack, who was readily available to get us the keys & answer any questions that we had during our stay- thanks Mack! We had coffee, extra sheets, extra towels, along with all the necessities. The apartment was right outside the downtown area making it convenient to explore the city & surrounding areas! The AC unit made it nice & cool, as well as help drown the outside rustle/bustle of the city. "
7110655,43083186,2015-08-17,37395887,Trevor,"Staying at Ross and Lauren's place was a real treat. The apartment was perfect size, great view, and in a great location relative to downtown and Pike's Place. It's a little bit far if your interested in things further up north such as the Space Needle, Capitol Hill, or Fremont, but the International District has a nice feel to it in and of itself. Ross was very helpful in making sure my stay went smoothly and was very friendly in recommending places to explore in the city (they have a nice little printout of all the places within walking distance that a traveler might be interested in). If I ever find myself back in Seattle, I would have no problem staying at another one of Ross and Lauren's place."
7110655,43963026,2015-08-23,1857185,Melissa & Damian,"It was very easy to communicate with Lauren and Ross - Ross actually met us with the keys and gave us a good overview of the apartment and the neighborhood. The apartment was very bright and had great views because it is on the 5th floor - but with an elevator - yay! It was very clean and tidy. The location is great too. Very close to some great neighborhoods and restaurants. One thing I would note is that the location is great, but urban and located across the street from a fire station. Not for someone who is not used to the city noise (or who is not used to using ear plugs), or is looking for a quaint tree-lined street. Should be obvious based on the location, but I am noting it in case that is someone's expectation."
7110655,46047545,2015-09-07,1600897,Matt,"Ross and Lauren's place was fantastic! It's in a really great location right next to the train station and a super short walk to Pioneer Square. Lauren provided fresh linens, organic fancy soaps and shampoo, and had everything you could need to cook a meal in the kitchen. For someone unfamiliar with Seattle, Ross and Lauren have helpful recommendations on where to go for food, drinks, etc. The apartment is a corner unit with a great view of the water. We had a great stay! "
7110655,46345379,2015-09-09,17784535,Joe,"Communicating with Ross and Lauren was easy and quick. The neighborhood is just as described. The space was very clean, good light, and open. The eclectic and thoughtfully selected artwork around the apartment impressed us, and gave the space a warm, lived in glow. "
7110655,47754796,2015-09-21,16541330,Brian,"Ross and Lauren's apartment is exactly what is described, and fit my needs perfectly. 
Communication was almost instant, and Lauren is very easy going, and made it a pleasure to talk to her. 
Internet worked very well, plenty of towels, hot water, and every form of transportation is within two blocks or so. We used buses and trains our entire visit, and all were simple and within a stone throw. 
I won't hesitate to stay again when in Seattle, and give it 5 stars all the way! "
7110655,48331203,2015-09-25,40346029,Lom,"Ross and Lauren's place was really nice - a great open space with a great view. The location was really convenient, being only a short walk to Pioneer Square and into downtown, and transit. Ross and Lauren were very communicative during my stay and everything went really smoothly. I'd highly recommend staying there."
7110655,48743156,2015-09-28,42523039,Katharine,"Any time I come to Seattle I will try to stay here. Lauren was so welcoming to us, the location was perfect, and the apartment itself was large and clean and comfortable. We felt like we were in our own home in the hub of Seattle. I would recommend this listing to anyone heading to Seattle. "
7110655,49237528,2015-10-02,31339037,Samuel,"A great spot to stay for sports fans, food lovers, booze hounds, and the curious traveller.  The comfortable studio apartment is within walking distance to the football and baseball venues, multiple restaurants and bars, and not too far from the pier and Pike's market.  The light rail station is 2 blocks away for easy access to the airport, space needle, museums, etc.  Location, location, location!"
7110655,49655116,2015-10-05,25222019,Michael,"We had a great stay at Ross and Lauren's place!  The view is fantastic and the apartment is VERY convenient to the art galleries in Pioneer Square as well as the stadiums and the train station. It's also very walkable to the waterfront and Belltown. The apartment is nothing fancy, but it's comfortable and a good place to use as a base for exploring Seattle. "
7110655,50045398,2015-10-08,45678645,Joe,"Ross & Lauren were very easy to contact and responded quickly. The studio apartment was simple, clean and nice. The Wi-Fi worked great. The apartment is in an urban area and there are lots of city sounds including the occasional fire truck sirens leaving the fire station across the street. However, as a former city dweller, I loved the sounds and they were not bad if you keep the windows closed. The rate is very reasonable and I would recommend Ross & Lauren's place for anyone who would prefer not to be in a hotel and have a little privacy as well. I almost forgot, the computer speakers that were there for use was nice when I hooked up my tablet so I could listen to music and Ross & Lauren left a list of places near by. "
7110655,50469057,2015-10-12,20419377,Changbo,Lauren was really helpful and the studio's location was really central - within walking distance to a lot of good restaurants and tourist attractions downtown. 
7110655,51734903,2015-10-24,13939295,Darla,"Lauren was excellent at responding quickly, answering my questions and ensuring a smooth transition accessing the apartment. The apartment was perfect for our needs - we were walking distance to Centurylink Field and nearby bars and restaurants and we were able to find parking within less than a block. The bed was comfortable, the apartment was spacious and clean, and the view was pretty. Although we didn't take advantage of it, we were offered a later check-out, which was a nice touch. "
7110655,52220800,2015-10-27,30734695,Paul,"Lauren was extremely friendly and helpful. The apartment was clean, had plenty of space for me and was in a convenient location next to the stadium and train station. Neighborhood had a lot of character as well. Wifi was super fast (95/10) and reliable. Great experience overall."
7110655,52414455,2015-10-29,9496096,Alix,"Super studio avec vue panoramique, à proximité de tout + un ascenseur et Wifi! Lauren adorable et très serviable. Un séjour court mais extra! "
7110655,53536910,2015-11-09,47411825,Javier,"Lauren and Ross were great hosts. They responded quickly and were very accommodating with our travels. The studio was cozy, clean, and convenient with a great view. It was walking distance to many tourist locations, stores, and bars, if not many places were less than a $10 über ride. Definitely staying here when traveling to Seattle. "
7110655,54260832,2015-11-17,5723160,Conrad,"LOVED this place. Great, central location. Super cozy, clean, and well decorated. And the views of the iconic Smith Tower are incredible day and night! Would absolutely stay again. "
7110655,54644303,2015-11-22,24191161,Anne And Al,"Staying at Ross and Lauren's air BnB was ideal for us. It was three blocks from an event I was attending so the location was perfect for us, and offered amazing panoramic views of the city, water and mountains. They were very accommodating to my allergies to feathers and made sure pillows and comforters were feather-free before we arrived. The place was very clean and I would recommend a stay here if you are in the area. "
7110655,55259700,2015-11-29,2324071,Rebecca,"You can't choose a better place to stay for a close in, accessible time in Seattle. Lauren and Ross provide a comfy spot that is personal and friendly. My first day they invited me to meet them in person, which was greatly appreciated. The day and night views of the Sound and City gave this country mouse a very special experience. :)"
7110655,55581706,2015-12-02,37271222,Amalia,"Clean, comfortable and convenient. The place is as described. My communication with the host was easy. Also, the host made sure I had everything I needed. "
7110655,56623873,2015-12-15,20953668,Steven,Lauren provided answers to all my questions and made me feel welcome.  Nice view.  Desirable location with lots of Asian food options.  Plenty of public transportation in area. 
7110655,57148579,2015-12-22,46452324,Kevin,"Lauren & Ross were amazing hosts!  The room was magnificent and the view was great.  I was in the city to watch a Seahawks game, and the location could not have been any better.  Within walking distance to Seattle's Chinatown and many other great landmarks.  Would love to stay at this place again if I go back to Seattle!"
7110655,57340698,2015-12-24,26271157,Zeyu,The place is very clean and cozy. The best location and close to everything！ strongly recommended！
7110655,57800950,2015-12-29,16511093,Elizabeth,"My husband and I decided to do a night downtown to watch the Seahawks game and found Ross & Lauren's place. I can't express how perfect it was. From them meeting us at the door to shampoo and conditioner stocked in the bathroom is was a great place to stay. Very convenient to go to the game and lots of restaurants in the area. we had a great time and would definitely stay with them again. 

Here's hitting on any questions you may have: 
- Bed: very comfortable
- Shower: good pressure and great hot water
- View: amazing view of Seattle waterfront
- Area: it is an urban area so you get all types but they generally leave you alone if you don't bother them
- Carpet: it's nice, take your shoes off :)
- Bonus: huge closet if you're a hang your clothes up person (which I am)"
9612147,56991103,2015-12-20,26298184,Adriana,"The place was very comfy, nice and clean. Would definitely recommend it "
9612147,57487805,2015-12-26,51434896,Yihui,clean and organized house. awesome!
5042014,26086617,2015-02-02,26856831,Paul,"Emiliya was a great hostess and a lovely lady. She had thought of everything and told me what I needed to know, through our messages and phone calls. I Had no trouble at all in finding the place, checking in, dropping luggage or finding things like the hairdryer and other handy items. The place is exactly as described, very attractive, quiet, comfortable and within easy walking distance of Ballard downtown.  It was a really pleasant stay and the next time I am in town I will definitely book it again. I couldn't be more pleased."
5042014,26758077,2015-02-18,24680413,Robert,"Staying withEmiliya has worked out perfectly. She is an amazing host who is attentive to your needs but also respects your privacy. She offers coffee and food daily which is really nice, and checks in periodically to make sure everything is going ok. The room is clean and bright as pictured, and the attached private bathroom is big with a great shower. The location in Ballard is great. Inside is private and quiet, but you are also very close to the bus, shopping and downtown. I liked staying here so much I extended my visit. Highly recommended! "
5042014,28673930,2015-03-28,11501673,Emilia,"Emiliya was welcoming, communicates well, and the place is nice. The location was perfect, just a couple of blocks from my friend's house. I used it as a base to go out to the San Juan islands, so didn't spend much time checking out the neighborhood, though."
5042014,40250237,2015-07-29,2635616,Becca,"Emiliya was a great host, very kind and considerate. The room is great quiet, cute with an attached bathroom and in a great neighborhood. If you stay with Emiliya you must try Morsel right down the street for breakfast! "
5042014,40545396,2015-07-31,892233,Catherine,"Emiliya was a wonderful and inviting host, and I loved this little room! I was only there for one night, so I did not see Emiliya very much, but when I did she was so kind and welcoming. The pictures are very accurate and the space and bed were very comfortable. Emiliya has provided everything you might need, as well as some things I would not have even thought of! This was an excellent experience."
5042014,42130396,2015-08-11,2963993,Key,"The room has everything you might need: microwave, small fridge and kettle. The best thing about this room is location. It is next to the rapid-bus line D, which take you to downtown in 15-20 minutes. There is also supermarket opened 24 hours 5 minutes away.

I did see Emiliya only few times as I went out quite early and back quite late, but she was a nice and considerate host, make sure I have pleasant stay. Overall, I highly recommended this room!!"
5042014,43506736,2015-08-20,37378247,John,"My stay (one week) at Emiliya's went perfectly.  Just the right balance of attentiveness and personal space.   She makes the perfect hostess.

The room, house and neighborhood are just as she describes.  The cost was very fair.

I can recommend you stay at Emiliya Lane's Ballard Art."
5042014,44309017,2015-08-25,12425192,Steve,"I didn't see much of Emiliya, mostly because our respective schedules had us out and about frequently, but my conversations with her indeed made me feel very welcome.  She was very attentive and often asked if I had everything I need.  The house is located at the corner of two quiet side-streets in Ballard, but a short walk to a main thoroughfare where you can catch a bus to downtown, or another bus towards the U-District (I strongly recommend the OneBusAway app for real-time departures).  

The room itself is comfortable, quiet, has plenty of storage space, its own bathroom with plenty of toiletries in stock, and a microwave.  The paintings on the walls were a nice touch.  I made good use of the sliding glass door to keep the room cool on the warm days.

I would definitely stay here again on a future trip to Seattle.  "
5042014,44598605,2015-08-27,41915270,Mandy,"  The room is lovely and clean, and it has its own washroom with everything you need (hairdryer is available when asking). The place is 2 mins walk to bus stop, which takes you about 20-25 mins to Seattle downtown area. There is also a safeway by 10 mins walk from the house, and you can buy ORCA card there. 
  Emiliya is a super nice person that makes you feel at home. If you have anything unsure, just text her. On my last day of stay, she invited me to have a cup of French coffee, and we chat for a while. I can tell that Emiliya has a strong passion for her life from the decoration of the house, and she is also willing to share her experience. at last, the price is very fair for a short stay.
  I strongly recommend Emiliya's room. It is not only a room for stay, but it is more like a great way to know new people as well as new experience. By the way, Emiliya loves Tea ;)"
5042014,45101649,2015-08-31,4667480,James,The room was great. Had everything I needed (and more). Emiliya was a very accommodating host. I'd definitely look to stay here again if I come back to Ballard!
5042014,49786560,2015-10-06,8504586,Steve,"Staying at Emiliya's was a perfect experience.  She was very warm and welcoming.  The room and amenities were as described.  The area was quiet, felt safe, was close to public transportation, food and restaurants. "
5042014,50846989,2015-10-15,25142094,Gerard,Emiliya is very friendly and accommodating. Description is accurate.
5042014,51772798,2015-10-24,10621417,Justin,"Emiliya was the perfect host! I was in Seattle for 5 days to do some hiking in the surrounding areas and everything was prepared for me when I arrived. The room was clean and comfortable, and having access to the kitchen and laundry was a huge plus. Emiliya provided quick responses whenever I had any questions, and was always available if I needed any help. Would definitely stay with her again when I'm in Seattle!"
5042014,52094200,2015-10-26,9637732,Joan,"I had a nice stay with Emiliya. The room was comfortable and quiet, with a private bath and nice light from the patio. The condo is just off the D line, so quite easy access. It was perfect for my visit to Ballard!"
938785,12298662,2014-04-28,7628973,Brittany,"Jordan was easy to book with, gave clear instructions for the place. Note that you are not booking through the owner but rather through the Stay Alfred business. For this reason I see the apartment as more of an alternative to a hotel, rather than the more 'traditional' Airbnb experience of meeting a local and the special touches of a good host. 

You really can't beat the location - the apartment entrance is accessible via 'gum alley' which is a few steps away from the primary entrance to Pike Place market. The weather was not ideal for outdoor lounging while we were there, but there is also a rooftop area that I believe is available for the building. 

The suite has a view of the ocean and the ferris wheel. While the suite was reasonably spacious and clean, it could use some touch-ups and modern upgrades (such as a fresh paint job or an iPod docking station for music). "
938785,12972326,2014-05-16,5640735,May,"Clean place at a great location.  Easy walk to Pioneer Square, Downtown, and even Belltown.  Nice amenities on arrival that we did not expect -- soap, shampoo, coffee etc.  More than two guest may be too crowded.  Bed mattress is on soft side.  The sofa bed is very uncomfortable and the freeway is across the street.  Traffic is 24/7 and not for light sleepers.  So bring earplugs if using sofa bed.  "
938785,13258919,2014-05-23,44687,Jeanne,Perfect location to walk to everything in Seattle especially the office while in town for work.  Everything needed stocked in the apt.  Super easy 24 hr check-in right at Harbor Steps.  Thank you - enjoyed the stay.
938785,19135241,2014-09-07,6932563,Brian,"Such a great location!  Walking distance to everything we needed.  Clean, easy to access.  Only problem was the patio door was stuck but everything else was perfect for our stay.  Definitely will stay here again when we come back to Seattle.
"
938785,21071588,2014-10-11,16060301,Deborah,"Excellent location, but better suited for two people.  Great views and walking distance to everything.  
Could have been a little cleaner and needs some minor maintenance.  The Stay Alfred team were super helpful and very friendly.  They even brought us a much needed crab pot!  We had a wonderful vacation here.  Construction is going on across the street for the next 9 months or so, and it can get pretty loud at times.  Overall, it was well worth it."
938785,22460821,2014-11-07,9250493,Leah,We had a wonderful time at Best Ocean View in Seattle. 
938785,22843130,2014-11-16,3355591,Jennifer,"Wonderful place located above the heart of Pike's market. I will definitely stay here again should I find myself in Seattle. 
"
938785,44704787,2015-08-28,22709751,Amy,"We loved the location of this apartment!  It was so easy to get around to everywhere downtown.  It was a small space for the four of us (two little ones age 4 and age 2), but we weren't really in the apartment too much. Our boys loved watching the cars go by on the highway and the ferris wheel.  it was a big hit!  The washer and dryer in the unit were perfect for us too.  The only down side was that there was no parking, but we easily found a place to park each night in a garage nearby.  As long as we were in after 6 and out by 8 AM, we only paid about $10 (which includes the crazy taxes!).  We would definitely stay here again."
938785,48867689,2015-09-29,35404184,Paul,"The apartment is in a terrific neighborhood.  We arrived 45 minutes early and wanted to put our bags in the apartment but was told by the operator that we had to wait until check in time.  Once in the apartment, we pulled up the wireless network according to the instructions but that network was not available.  I called the host operator and was told to use a different network that was available.  I typed in the network code on two phones and an ipad and although it accepted the code, a message said the server was unavailable.  There were problems with the TV as program guide was stuck on the midnight listing.  Texted the host operator about both these problems a second time and was told that she is leaving for the night but would have someone call.  Nobody did.  The next day spoke with another person about the problem but still didn't get it resolved.  We didn't have wifi during our stay.  We also had to purchase salt/pepper/butter and other essentials as there wasn't anything like that in the kitchen."
938785,50872914,2015-10-15,34367632,Joe,Awesome!!!!
938785,52482831,2015-10-30,9250493,Leah,This is second time we have rented this apartment and love this location. It's easy to find and has everything you could need. Will be back next year . 
938785,52986432,2015-11-03,45657890,Ikik,"We loved the location and apartment! We had a wonderful time at Best Ocean View in Seattle, If we'll go to seattle, We would like stay here again."
938785,53194257,2015-11-06,30200196,Kenny,"As many others have said, you're going to have a hard time finding a place with a better location. It's cozy and best suited for two people willing to share a bed but the sofa was firm enough to sleep on and there was enough living space for all three of us. The windows are a little drafty but the heaters work well. The self check-in process was a little awkward but once you get the keys, it's all gravy. The kitchen looked like it had all the utilities required to make a meal but there were so many great restaurants nearby that we never got the chance use it. Overall great place."
828298,3436896,2013-01-29,717456,Karl,"Great spot for anyone looking for something near the Convention Center! Darik's communication was good and left me confident that my first airbnb experience would be a good one.  I got clear instructions on what to do, and when things changed a little before the stay, I got an update and was told specifically which phone number to call to check in.  The condo was amazing and in a superb location for the conference I attended."
828298,4243022,2013-04-22,4725173,Amy,"The apt was gorgeous, with full kitchen and a TV in each room. It was a great location and very comfortable. The only downside was that there were only 2 keys. This was inconvenient, since there were 4 of us staying there with different work activities and no cell phone access since we we're from out of the country, The lack of keys is my only complaint though, the apt was great and I'd definitely go back."
828298,4339340,2013-04-29,5424508,Chris,"5 Stars!  This is a great place to stay...it is right in Capital Hill and walking distance from EVERYTHING..you could walk to the waterfront/pikes market/ferries..but we just walked outside and flagged a cab in front of the convention center next door..costs $5. the unit itself is very nice and very comfortable. view from the roof is amazing. I cant recommend it enough, also while you are there, there's a Tapas restaurant right on the corner of Boran and Pike (less than half a block away) called TANGO, it has THE BEST dessert I have ever eaten (THE EL DIABLO)...do yourself a favor and stay in this unit and eat that dessert every night!!!!"

828298,4925757,2013-06-02,5291029,Qiyao,Great apartment! Clean and comfortable to live in. Very convenient check-in check-out process. Close to city center and various stores.
828298,5373847,2013-06-26,6747518,Timothy,"Great place and very close to pike market and the space needle. Darik was an amazing host and very helpful. The place is just as described. When i come back to seattle, this is the place i will be booking (website hidden): I booked this place one night before my flight and Darik was fast on his response and made sure i had a place to stay! "
828298,5690154,2013-07-12,5638921,Matthew,"A great location! Very handy if you are attending anything at the Washington State Convention Centre but central to everything.

The staff who greeted us were very helpful and friendly. The accommodation was clean and very well set up. Lots of technology available in the condo to keep you entertained."
828298,11715202,2014-04-13,12869268,Lee,Great space and location especially if you are looking for easy access to the convention center. 
828298,12326956,2014-04-29,174634,Teresa,"Our entire stay was wonderfully managed so we knew what to do every step of the way. The hosts provided very thorough communication before our trip, which made arrival a breeze. Alan met us at the condo for check-in, showed us around, and told us a little about the city. 

The condo itself was clean, comfortable, and exactly as represented.  Our group was in town for a coffee conference at the Washington State Convention Center, which was basically right across the street.  There could be no better location!  We had 5 people staying, which worked out fine. The only difficulty was that there were only two keys, but we worked it out.  

I would definitely recommend this place for convention goers, or even for a family visiting Seattle that wants a good central homebase."
828298,20194894,2014-09-25,20454308,George,"ideal place to stay for visiting the overly priced city of Seattle. Walking distance to downtown, Pike Place, underground bus station, underground light rail to air port and monorail. It is an older building, but the inside of the condo is great and clean. the master bed is very comfortable, bathroom very clean, whole place is very clean. the second room beds are also very comfortable. Very quite and no problems getting hot water. We were allowed earlier than the 4:00pm check-in which was very much appreciated.
"
828298,21197848,2014-10-13,18178270,Winnie,"Nice, modern furnishings. Ample outlets for charging personal devices in every room.

Easy access to the Washington State Convention Center. 10 minute-walk to the local QFC (grocery store chain.)"

828298,50050122,2015-10-08,27951181,Catherine,This apt was fabulous. You can tell that this team is in sync and know how to run a property. The apt was super clean and the person who met me was very nice. The apt is only for Airbnb use so none of the creepy someone lives there vibe

4940379,42118318,2015-08-11,16381819,Steven,"  The host was very helpful and answered all questions about the location and arrival. She also  provided us with a bottle of wine which we enjoyed on the deck in the evenings while soaking up the view of the bat. The home was very clean and accommodating our family of six very well. Has wonderful views of the bay and university of Washington. Very nice neighborhood walking distance to the university and a café.  The home is a short commute to the university, downtown, Safeco Field and other Seattle attractions.  "

The beds and linens were lovely and the home had just about everything you need for a great Seattle visit.  The location is close to the University and downtown and very easy to get to.   
We were visiting Seattle for a family wedding and the home was a perfect ""base"" for the family to meet and Lyft or Uber to wherever we needed to get to.  Our cars were comfortably and safely parked in the 2 spaces provided.  
Wonderful neighborhood for walking!"
4940379,54557378,2015-11-21,4154817,Jeff,"Mimmi's property is super spacious, beautifully decorated, spotless and you can't beat the gorgeous view from the huge window in the upstairs living room and adjoining deck. I could have sat there relaxing and staring at the water the whole time! The neighborhood is also lovely and friendly with the charming Canal Market just down the street (try their breakfast sandwiches!). I couldn't have been happier with my stay, and Mimmi was a gracious host. Extremely responsive  and even checked in over text during my stay to make sure everything was going smoothly or if we needed anything. What a dreamy place to stay!"
4940379,55096678,2015-11-28,2599096,Douglas,Really great house and welcoming host. We spent Thanksgiving week at the house and had plenty of cookware for the family feast. We were rewarded with ever changing views on the waterfront. Great neighborhood central to activities and restaurants. 
4940379,55989917,2015-12-07,26033235,Mollie,"The house was every bit as glorious as the photos. Quiet neighborhood, ( a little street noise in the front, but not a bother) Great view, furnishings, we didn't want to leave! Mimmi was very accommodating with check in, and available. My parents 45 th anniversary was made even better by our great stay! Thank you. "
4940379,57055555,2015-12-21,45687823,Richard,Nice house in Portage Bay. Awesome view and deck. Off street parking. Comfortable accommodations. We traveled at Christmas time and were greeted with a decorated tree. Nice touch! Thank you.
4940379,58316661,2016-01-02,26882483,Joellyn,"Mimmi's home was beautiful (awesome view and attention to detail that made us feel comfortable and welcome), in a nice location and well equipped for our needs. And the place was so clean! Loved having covered parking and I appreciated the helpful book with local markets and info about the house. Mimmi was easy to communicate with (fast to respond and clear with instructions etc) and she reached out just to check in which was so thoughtful. We hope to return in the warmer months!"
7596455,44254449,2015-08-24,21280811,Lea,This apartment and Linda were truly amazing! We found everything we needed and there there is a big home cinema in the living room. A movie rental is only one block away. Linda even made us some popcorn for our movie nights. The cat Alice is one of the coolest cats we've ever seen. It is only a 10minutes ride with the bus and the bus station is only a 3mimutes walk. There is a very delicious burger restaurant right around the corner and some other restauants as well. Thank you so much for hosting us! We highly recommend this place.
7596455,48592330,2015-09-27,23248462,Chris,"Linda was a lovely hostess. The location was great for us. You can't go wrong in the Fremont neighborhood. We had been on the road for a while so having access to a washer and dryer was awesome. The apartment is in a rustic basement. For the price, we expected a bit more."
6629132,35157316,2015-06-15,5694585,Charles,"Dan was a wonderful host. His place was meticulously clean and comfortable and had just about anything you could ask for. The listing was exactly as described, and the location was very convenient. Dan was incredibly generous and was kind enough to pick me up for check-in. He even treated me to a drink and prepared breakfast the first morning.

His cat Orin was very friendly, and the whole experience was very welcoming. He graciously invited me to meet some of his friends and spent some time showing me around the area too. Dan has lived in the Seattle area for many years and was great to talk to about the city. I'd be happy to stay with him again.

6629132,38027372,2015-07-12,36652195,Gail,"Dan made us feel completely welcome and at home.  He really went out of his way to do so.   We were traveling with two kids, 12 and 15.  Dan was so kind to the kids and in no way condescending.  They both expressed to their mom and me that they liked him (the supreme complement from those age groups).  Needless to say, my daughter and I felt the same.  The rooms lived up to our expectations.  The location is great - we walked to downtown and also took the bus to and from Dan's home."
6629132,38210576,2015-07-13,26711976,Danqing,"It was really a nice experience!!! Dan is nice and kind person. He let us stay till 9pm because our flight was 12am at night. The room is awesome, big and comfortable! I would definitely live here if I go to Seattle again!!"

6629132,39823208,2015-07-26,37844040,Travis,"Dan was a great host and his place is very nice and very conveniently located in Queen Anne. It was only a short walk to the Space needle and local restaurants in Queen Anne. While we were there, Dan gave us plenty of recommendations for places to see and where to eat around Seattle. He was awesome and even bought some breakfast items for us in the mornings!   His townhouse has a very cool patio to just hang out on and soak up the great weather in Seattle. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle.

Thanks Dan!

Also, his cat Orin is pretty cool too. "
6629132,39948089,2015-07-27,3148972,Maria,"It was really nice to meet Dan- he made us feel really at home in his place and even provided breakfast and coffee in the AM! The suite is nicer than described, a full downstairs area and epic balcony that felt very private for me and my 3 friends to crash while in town. Oh, and his kitty is amazing! Thanks again!"
6629132,41102218,2015-08-04,36750203,Jasper,"Dan was a fantastic host. He was incredibly welcoming and helpful. In all, a great experience I would do again in a heart beat. "
6629132,41963254,2015-08-10,36078787,Cody,"Dan was a wonderful host. The space was comfortable and clean and he provided us with everything we needed. He was also fine with us coming and going at odd hours during the day and at night, and allowed us to use his kitchen for breakfast or snacks. His back porch was also a great place to eat breakfast or to relax in at night. The location was everything he said it would be. "
6629132,44346267,2015-08-25,10374791,Ana-Lisa,"Dan was a wonderful host, and we enjoyed our stay at his lovely town house in Seattle. The location was fantastic! Walking distance from the Space Needle and Museums as well as several restaurants and cafes. The suite was comfortable, spacious and quiet. Dan was always very responsive and helpful whenever we had questions, and offered some great suggestions about where to go in the city. A+!"
6629132,45314788,2015-09-01,18362772,Jamie,"Dan made us feel very welcome. He greeted me with a glass of wine . He had a basket of snacks for us and bottles of water.  The listing was accurate and the neighborhood was really nice. We had no worries walking aorund at night.  There were a couple of good restaurants in very close walking distance. Dan's cat Oren was a welcoming guy too, very cute and friendly. "
4318709,28759714,2015-03-29,1435214,Saharnaz,"My friend and I stayed in Keith's place for three nights and we truly enjoyed our stay. We were in Seattle for an academic conference and everything in his place was fairly comfy (maybe except the sofa bed), cosy and clean. Keith was very nice and friendly,and even in the last day when the taxi took way too long, and we were about to miss our morning panel, he kindly gave us a ride. I would definitely recommend this play. "
4318709,33610058,2015-05-30,33210892,Katie,"Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood with bars and good places to eat, and great parks! Keith is accommodating and very nice. Hooked us up with an air mattress, breakfast, and suggestions for food and places to go."
4318709,35145849,2015-06-15,34731934,Gavin,"Keith was a wonderful host, who was very accommodating when I ended up being a day late when I missed a connection. I was really blown away, because in some ways staying with Keith was better than staying at a friends place. I really appreciated his suggestions on what to see while I was in Seattle, and the extra touches to make the stay enjoyable. Without him I probably wouldn't have gone to some of the highlight locations of my trip. Keith also seems very willing to help out if you're in a bind, which can be very helpful when you're in an unfamiliar city. We also shared some similar interests, so I really enjoyed conversing with him when we both were at his place at the same time. "
4318709,35512782,2015-06-19,10343105,Layne,Great location. Keith is a generous host. Definitely recommend!
4318709,35624104,2015-06-20,26111584,Joseph,Keith was very Accommodating. This was a great place for the price.
4318709,37126428,2015-07-04,3816686,Ibrahim,"Keith's an awesome host! Unlike other places I've stayed at, Keith was actually around to help you check-in, get acclimated to the area, and answer any questions you might have. The location's excellent, the space was comfortable, and all the amenities I needed where available. I highly recommend staying with Keith."
4318709,37510655,2015-07-07,36463994,Amanda,"Alex and I had a great time staying with Keith. He set up an air mattress for us that is as tall as a regular bed, so it's not like we were sleeping on the floor. He had lots of little touches that made this way better than expected - like water bottles, towels, etc. I had an interview in Seattle during the trip and asked if he had an iron so I could do my shirt, and when we got back that night he had set up the iron and ironing board all ready for us. Great, great host - very accommodating and easy to talk to. Would definitely recommend!"
4318709,37906114,2015-07-11,22418367,Lola,"Keith received me at a really late hour with fruit and water and of course a great bed to sleep on after 12 hours of flying from nyc. His place is clean, quiet, and perfectly located for walking just about anywhere. I walked everywhere I needed to go and Keith was very helpful. Will definitely be back!"
4318709,38081326,2015-07-12,21175736,Lisa,"Keith was very welcoming and helped accommodate my friend and I. The neighbourhood was great, and I had a lovely stay! "
4318709,38329276,2015-07-14,1794926,Gary,Keith was super thoughtful and communicative.  He was flexible with check-in and check-out which really helped us a lot as far as planning.  His place is clean and cozy.  The air mattress is very large (I think it's queen-sized) and is actually very comfortable.  Great location as well!
4318709,38554642,2015-07-16,956427,Oliver,"It was a short stay at Keith's house, but I liked it a lot. The bed was good, even the friendly and fast communication with Keith. WiFi worked very good and the neighbourhood is good."
4318709,38765830,2015-07-18,18600042,Yu,I just had one night in his place but I was really satisfied. His place was spacious and restroom was also clean. And it was close to downtown. His place is much better than it appears in the pictures.

The Pink Bedroom isn't the biggest one, but the bed is very good and the sheets are new and of good quality. The Bathroom looks new. It's nice, clean, fresh and big! The Kitchen is practical and also clean and organized. The host is generous and knows how to make you feel welcome and comfortable. Well organized and ran by good people!"

7902382,51074095,2015-10-17,7224405,Kelly,"Dario's friend/roommate arranged my stay, sent me all the information I would have needed in advance, which was helpful for my late arrival. The room is indeed very small, looks a bit bigger in the picture due to the lens, and was very dirty. The bed was comfortable and sheets clean, but there was dirt, hair etc. all over the floor - it looked like the floor hadn't been cleaned in weeks. The same was the case for the bathroom. Bathroom surfaces were fine, but floor and mat were really disgusting. I would advise anyone turned off by dirty surfaces to avoid this host. "
7902382,51806170,2015-10-24,32419224,Loren,The home is very nice and close in to downtown. New remodel and carpets. Quiet neighborhood and very comfortable.
7902382,52028446,2015-10-25,2688032,Andrew,"The room was exactly as described, and I would stay again. The biggest downside is how long it takes to get into downtown, which they have no control over. Without traffic, it takes about twenty minutes. If that's fine with you, the place is lovely and the price can't be beat."

9016362,53945835,2015-11-14,33651965,Ian,Dereck and his Roommate Were very welcoming and helpful for our trip to Seattle. The apartment is right in Capitol Hill; we walked to a few bars very easily. They were very friendly but also gave us enough space and privacy.
9016362,54569446,2015-11-21,49487064,Todd,"Dereck and his roommate Colby were great. Dereck was quick to respond and kept me informed of what was going on throughout the day. When Dereck had to work he promptly informed me that Colby would be meeting with me to provide me a key and answer any questions I may have.  Colby provided me with basic navigation of Capital Hill, ideas of places to eat, drink and see.  Both of the guys offered their cell phone numbers in case i got lost.  This was my first airbnb experience and so I wasn't quite sure how it all worked. Dereck promptly answered all of my questions and couldn't have been nicer throughout the whole process. The room was as advertised and the whole place was tidy and clean. The views from the apartment are fantastic and the building is close to anything you could possibly want to do on Capital Hill."
9016362,55708060,2015-12-04,15318916,Christian,"Dereck was quick to respond, a really nice guy and so were his two other room mates. They keep a pretty clean house and the room has a beautiful view of Seattle and a nice balcony. It's centrally located and easy to get to. Enjoy your time with Dereck. "
9013441,56317798,2015-12-12,39659650,RaeAnn,"This property was Excellent. We stayed at Brook and Cat's studio for 12 days which was so comfortable.  The furnishings were all new, bed was comfortable and full cable tv and wifi was provided.  Design is simple but they had everything from coat racks to coffee, tea and basic breakfast items.  

This spot would be perfect for single person or a couple looking for both short term or long term stay.  It's a 2 minute walk to the light rail which can take you directly to the Airport (20 mins) or downtown Seattle (15 mins).  You really don't have to rent a car.  If you do, you can also take the light rail from Beacon Hill station or Seattle Airport and pick up a car from Avis/Budget in Georgetown/Sodo Station.  That would avoid the airport taxes/fees on rental cars. If you're planning on catching a football, baseball or sounders game, you can also take the light rail to the Stadiums. 

The neighborhood is really safe.  It has a grocery store a block or 2 away, along with other eateries around the area.    The hosts were very accommodating with check in and check out time. They were available by text and even checked on us during our stay just to make sure the apartment was comfortable.  We would definitely contact Brook & Cat next time we're in Seattle.  

This listing is absolutely PERFECT.  "
9013441,56522964,2015-12-14,13464579,Louis,"Brook and Cat's place is a really charming studio. There is a full kitchen, bed, couch, TV, and all the amenities you need. The layout really utilizes the space well. The studio was stocked with little items that you may have forgotten, and even a few extras. It was also very clean. I'd absolutely recommend this place for a single person or couple. 

The studio is also well located. The Link light rail is super close and will take you to the airport or up into the city in no time. I Uber'd home from Capital Hill one night and it was only $10. Not bad at all. There are some food and coffee options around the place as well.

The hosts were very welcoming. They were flexible about the check in time, and were available by text if I needed them.

Overall a wonderful stay! Thank you!

Centrally located and close to Capitol Hill, the clean and really interesting house gave each in my group of five lots of spaces for working, reading, and relaxing.  If you love to cook and miss preparing your own meals when you're travelling, this kitchen is the answer to your prayers.  We took advantage of chef Karen's artillery of pots, pans, grill, range, and sharp knives to prepare some really memorable dinners from local ingredients purchased at the nearby market. The environmentally-conscious compound is intimate (neighbors close) but private. Karen and her liasons were super accommodating, and if we would have needed anything I know that someone would definitely have been all over it. The place has lots of interesting books and a stereo with CDs and an Ipod hook up, but there isn't a lot of clutter and you don't feel like you're tiptoeing around someone else's stuff. The house is prepared to be a rental house. Karen has also left a box of resources (restaurant recommendations, local amenities, museum and transportation info) for your convenience. Can't recommend enough.  We had a great stay.  "
1273432,6182370,2013-08-02,7388043,John,The house is wonderful with an incredible view of the Seattle skyline.
1273432,6372505,2013-08-10,7118311,Allison,"Very nice, clean space.  Karen was easy to work with.  Some safety concerns with a toddler but otherwise a great stay!"
1273432,16032312,2014-07-20,17508463,Shannon,We spent a week at the Mod Home and it was great! Karen was a great host and very responsive to our questions before we arrived. It's a great space and very green!
1273432,16417496,2014-07-27,5055811,Tony,"I had good time staying there the place was nice, and spacious, kitchen are very professional.  The only thing is floor is very slippery, both me and my husband fell of the steps in the kitchen.  It's not very safe for toddler, will be a nice place for a couple with older kids. 

I'm not very happy about the manager Carol, she was nice at first, then she was very careless, she did not catch the person who left weird mark on their kitchen island, and tried to blame on me, which I noticed the mark since day one. When she emailed me about those marks ( without photos) I was in Vancouver, after I keep asking about the photos she ignored me until the day I left, this made my trip very unpleasant. The owner was reasonable, she in the end did not ask me to pay for any of the damage which did not cause by me, I will be very careful picking places in the future. "
1273432,17447221,2014-08-12,6628893,Thomas,"The home was very much as described. The knives were very sharp. We got used to going up and down the stairs. The location was excelent for us... just a few minutes from the heart of downtown where we wanted to spend some time... also easy access to freeways, etc. to travel elsewhere. The home was very clean. Our experience was a very pleasant one."
1273432,18328597,2014-08-25,18214254,Marshall,"Host and manager were excellent, really interesting place in a great neighborhood."
1273432,37203350,2015-07-05,31317799,靖,it is so amazing! The house is same with picture. Perfect kitchen! Everything is clean and convenient. It is convention to to every place. I will come back again. 
1273432,37830075,2015-07-11,8656507,Jane,"My husband and I stayed in Karen's home with our three grown daughters for three nights. It was, if anything, more beautiful than we had expected - light and open with amazing views from the balconies. We were made very welcome on arrival and it was a real pleasure to stay in a place which is so clearly a real, loved home. We were out too much to take advantage of the kitchen facilities which- from equipment to spices - are excellent. A great place to stay and I would heartily recommend it. "
1273432,38834711,2015-07-19,28751008,Erica,"Karen's home is a great space and is even more beautiful than pictured. It was the perfect place for our stay in Seattle. Every room in the house is colorful, clean, and inviting. The balconies provide amazing views of the city skyline and were the best place to watch the sunset. We really enjoyed the fully stocked kitchen and kid-friendly environment with toys, books, and chalkboard doors. It made my seven year old feel at home. Karen and Carol (the house manager) were very friendly, informative, and responsive to any questions we had. We truly enjoyed our stay."
1273432,39938036,2015-07-27,10214972,Vincent,"Our family enjoyed our stay. We felt right at home instantly. The kitchen is truly a ""cook's kitchen"" and was much appreciated. The neighbors were welcoming. There is an urban flair to thus neighborhood which is just south of Capitol Hill. We would definitely stay again. "
1273432,40653009,2015-08-01,15609789,Zak,"Karen was amazing great communication and very welcoming. Her house is awesome! It was clean, tidy, comfortable and very stylish. The place its self is close enough to town with the plus of being able to escape the hustle."
1273432,45921286,2015-09-07,25151672,Megan,"My parents stayed at this home for 6 weeks during the summer and had an EXCELLENT experience. This home looks exactly as it is listed. Very cool and modern decor. Great location - awesome coffee shop 1 block away, a walkable grocery and drug store, a park across the street, and walkable or easy bus ride to get to/from many major tourist destinations. Amazing kitchen for those who enjoy cooking - and delicious coffee beans to use for those who need their cuppa joe first thing. Terrific views of the city skyline and mountains from 2 balconies. Great for families with school-aged kids - lots of toys to keep the younger ones busy. And so many books to read!

House manager was very kind and easy to contact. Hosts were very generous and checked in via email regularly to ensure that all was well. We appreciated their detailed instructions so that all expectations were clear. Plus, a housecleaner came every week, which was a major plus for us!! 

The home has a unique layout that was excellent for 2 couples - plenty of open spaces for group hangouts, and each party could have their own floor/bedroom/bathroom. Good to be aware that there are 4 flights of stairs to climb from the front door to the master bedroom - my parents and their guests, who are all in good physical shape and aged 60s and 70s, did just fine. Master bathroom is very nice - good washer/dryer.

We would highly recommend this home and host for anyone visiting Seattle for a short- or long-term visit!"
565703,3922569,2013-03-27,5467361,Quynh,"Bright, cheerful, and relaxing! This garden apartment with private entrance is exactly as pictured, offering peace and comfort. Ron truly is a generous and gracious host."
565703,3941883,2013-03-29,4328092,Jody,"My mother and I had a wonderful stay at Ron's apartment. The space is roomy enough for 3 yet has a cozy feel and is light and airy and beautifully decorated--loved all the citrus colors! The kitchen is well-stocked, the heat is easily adjustable in all rooms, and parking is easy. If the weather had been warmer, we would have used the little deck right off our living room! We were able to access Ron's wifi and watch a movie on our computer during our stay. The location is easily accessible to many sightseeing places in Seattle. We hope to come back again!"
565703,3956405,2013-03-30,5644600,Sean,"My wife, my friend and I had a lovely stay at Ron's place.  It was cozy, nicely decorated, and well furnished.  The kitchen was well equipped, and there was an abundance of spare towels, etc.  Suffice it to say, the price was more than fair.
Although we were late for our check-in, Ron was a gracious and accommodating host.  If I should ever need a place to stay in Seattle again, I would love to come back."
565703,4013560,2013-04-02,5604783,Nick,"Staying at the Garden Apartment was awesome. Ron is an excellent host who was very accommodating and helpful about local information. The apartment was beautiful and well-maintained with a great outdoor deck. Location was very close to Seattle, public transit to downtown was easy, but my girlfriend and I chose to walk to the city and surrounding areas everyday. Couldn't beat the experience, I would recommend it to anyone.

-Nick & Halley"
565703,4392007,2013-05-02,3394257,Cable,"A comfortable little apartment in a nice neighborhood. We stayed for a whole month, and could have stayed for another if we had planned ahead a little better. The hosts are great people, too."
565703,4496561,2013-05-08,6018102,Kim,Ron was a wonderful host!! The apartment was exactly as shown. The neighborhood is quiet and only about 10 minutes from all of the downtown Seattle attractions. My husband & I will definitely try to stay there again the next time we go to Seattle. 
565703,4668299,2013-05-19,6280362,Laura,"Ron was communicative and very nice. He came to introduce himself and give us instructions on how to use his radio. The garden apartment is very cute, well maintained, and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!"
565703,4808333,2013-05-27,4467262,Leone,"I had a great week long stay with Ron. He and his partner were so welcoming. One of the more magical things occurred when I first walked into the apartment, Ron had orchestral music playing. While it may sound cheesy, it certainly set the mood for a pleasant stay. Ron had everything I needed for my stay in Seattle. A fully supplied kitchen made it easy for me to make meals at home, saving me some money. In addition, Ron checked in on occasion via text to make sure I had everything I needed and was able to navigate the city okay. Ron's place (and service) was great, I would definitely stay again if I needed to."
565703,4866822,2013-05-29,6202371,Erik,Ron is an excellent and accommodating host. Location is superb and the apartment was nicely furnished. This will be the first place I look for the next time I am in Seattle.
565703,4875788,2013-05-30,5787223,Matt,"This apartment is charming, clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location for exploring downtown Seattle, the university, and the botanical gardens. Adjacent to the living area is a quaint patio with garden beyond, a perfect spot for taking an early breakfast. 

Ron is a gracious and attentive host. We were traveling with a small child and he went out of his way to make the home as safe as possible before our arrival. 

We hope to find our way back to Seattle, and would be happy to stay here once again. Thank you, Ron."
565703,5011306,2013-06-07,5138072,Claire,"We found Ron's garden apartment, though small, quite comfortable, with all the necessary amenities, especially as regards the kitchen pluses.  Ron has many spices and herbs which can be used by guests to make meals more appetizing and also provides staples (such as olive oil) for the cook.    Besides that, washer and dryer as well as iron and ironing board are provided, and a dishwasher makes cleanup simple. 

Ron is a very amiable host,  and responds to guests' requests, even when they have little to do with the hospitality he provides.  I was looking for a thistle (in the wild) but had not found one, and I mentioned it to Ron; the next day he presented us with a plant (an artichoke) which is a member of the thistle family!   There is a private little deck reached by sliding door in the living room; when     
it is not raining, this is a delightful spot to retire to for a cup of coffee or a meal served on the picnic table.  It overlooks one of Ron's gardens and is charming. 

This is a very pleasant place for a couple to stay, with an extra room with twin bed for a third person.   We would recommend it to anyone who can do without television for a while.  

Claire and Bob Katz

"
565703,5059245,2013-06-10,2176204,Michael,"Ron's place was perfect or us.  The first thing we noticed upon arrival was the sizable deck and garden - per the title of the place. It is very private and solely for our use. We took advantage of the long days and the garden furniture with a leisurely sunset dinner outside.The other thing I noticed was the original artwork throughout the place. The paintings were paired with the rooms and colors creating a lively atmosphere. I also appreciated the 2nd BR which allowed me to sleep in a little longer while the kids played. Check in, parking, and loading were easy. Ron gave us tips on the neighborhood and we discovered the Japanese Garden in the nearby Arboretum and Madison Beach park down the road. Plenty of good restaurants, cafes, an bars in walking distance. The locale is near Capital Hill with easy access to fun urban options, but the house is also just far enough from the action to be a respite in the city. "
565703,5131366,2013-06-14,6378787,Cen,Ron was very nice and considerate. And the neighborhood was with great environment and very convenient to facilities.
565703,5169789,2013-06-16,6371556,Timothy,Ron was very kind and welcoming. The apartment is spacious and comforting. Good location with public transportation nearby.
565703,6776884,2013-08-25,5925040,David,"We spent a lovely summer in this apartment. Great, quiet location and easy access to public transit."
565703,6881550,2013-08-28,2165504,Chris,"Amazing, above the call of duty hospitality! The location is great and was able to accommodate our family of 4 comfortably. Would stay again anytime. "
565703,6942925,2013-08-31,8054158,Alex,"Nice quiet neighbourhood, easy street parking and spacious accommodations. Kitchen was well stocked with all you would need to cook. Groceries stores including Trader Joes a quick drive away. Hosts were very accommodating. Beds were a bit soft for my liking but all in all a great spot to crash for the price."
565703,7013040,2013-09-03,3076881,Dorothy,"This was the perfect place for my daughter and I over Labor day weekend to explore Seattle.  Everything was great.  Mike was always available by phone and met us when we arrived.  He was a gracious host and even carried our bags in for us! The apartment is nicely decorated, the bed was super comfortable, the kitchen was well equipped.  We had our evening cocktail out on the sunny deck. The place is very clean and inviting.  We loved the neighborhood.  Ron gave us several ideas for dinner.  We walked to Harvest Vine and had a wonderful evening.  Street parking is safe and convenient.
My daughter and I can't wait for another stay here when we visit Seattle."
565703,7072555,2013-09-05,1182713,Green,"Mike(? sorry!) greeted us kindly and was very thorough in showing us the apt. The garden apt had everything we needed at a very reasonable price... bed, bathroom, kitchen and it was clean & tidy. No television, but that was fine because there was WiFi.Though there was only the two of us staying for the night, it was enough room & convenient location for my family to meet up and relax before their flight out of the city that afternoon. (We were all in Seattle for a wedding and my partner I were staying extra days to explore the city.) Having a little private garden patio made it easy to enjoy the lovely weather (when it was lovely :). Also having a washer/dryer was convenient for drying our travel towels before packing to leave.

We ate a several of the very close local businesses during our stay. A satisfying yogurt/granola breakfasts at the Essential Baking company (around the corner), happy hour early dinner at Jae's Asian Bistro (around the corner), desserts at Belle Epicurean(15 minute stroll), beers at The Attic and a lovely but tad bit pricey dinner at Harvest Vine (around the corner). "
565703,7140281,2013-09-08,7746937,John,It's a nice apartment in a desirable neighborhood. Would definitely stay there again.
565703,7254489,2013-09-13,206203,Amanda,The Garden Apartment is well equipped for cooking and in a central location as well as a fun neighborhood. Ron is a nice host.
565703,7319474,2013-09-15,7305733,David,"Ron was really great and accommodating during our two day stay.  The space was accurate to his description and very comfortable.  Great value considering its location and generous space.  Great bakeries/restaurants/shops just around the corner.  Private garden courtyard was a massive bonus!  The queen bed is quite soft, but we slept very comfortably.

Would look forward to staying again in the future!"
565703,7410381,2013-09-19,916668,Amaury,"Ron was a very hospitable and gentle host. This apartment is located beneath his own, so if any problem occurred, we knew we could easily reach him. This proved to be convenient when we interrupted the internet connection due to our own fault. Ron was downstairs only minutes later to fix the problem.

The apartment is large enough to accommodate four people. Everything was clean when we arrived there. The place is in a quiet neighborhood, but is easily reached by bus, as there are 2 high-frequency bus lines just around the corner on Madison that only take 15 minutes to take you downtown, and even less to get you to Capitol Hill. Washington Park is also really close by, providing a good opportunity for jogging - something that seemed pretty scarce throughout the city.

Having a washer and dryer in the apartment was a big plus to us, as we were on a long road trip.

If we missed anything in this apartment during our stay, it would have been some extra kitchen utensils and a table and chairs to accommodate four people. I would have made it a bit easier to enjoy the use of the otherwise very inviting and practical kitchen."
565703,7551322,2013-09-24,7775808,Hannah,Thanks Ron for your wonderful hospitality! The location was close to public transportation and nearby the arboretum. 
565703,7616237,2013-09-26,8685862,Thomas,"Ron was a kind host. Me and my brothers only stayed for 2 nights, but found it to be a perfect location to get into downtown Seattle (a little less than half an hour). Clean and spacious enough for 4."
565703,7656209,2013-09-28,5133677,Ljubica,"We had a good time in a beautiful, full equipped garden appartment. Ron is a very friendly and helpful host. It is a good place to stay to visit Seattle. 
"
565703,7799088,2013-10-03,3025410,Nils,"Our stay at Ron's Garden Apartment was just plain wonderful! Everything was as described, clean, comfortable and with a garden - very nice for the summer. 
The location is awesome, just a 1min walk to a bus station, 20min to downtown and a Safeway just 5min away. 

I can highly recommend Ron's apt!"
565703,7837922,2013-10-05,659038,Royal,"Ron was a fantastic communicator. The place was clean and comfortable, no disturbances, everything worked, and it was a pretty cool little pad to stay at. Internet access was awesome, so we were very productive both in and out of the apartment, plus there were some good places to walk around and see. Overall it was a great experience."
565703,8091068,2013-10-15,1514030,Mike,Ron's place has everything you need. Would recommend to anyone looking for accommodations in Seattle.
565703,8726960,2013-11-14,1893319,Ireta,Everything was fine.
565703,8783065,2013-11-18,8892084,Candace,"Comfortable & clean. Full kitchen so breakfasts were easy. Nice location, too; near Whole Foods, coop and Safeway.  Ron was available if we needed anything, but he'd thought of everything, so we little.  Would stay there again.  Candy"

565703,8991498,2013-12-01,5362191,Joan,"This was a perfect location for us in a private and quiet neighborhood. Ron was available, helpful, and open to suggestions. It was clean and as described. We will hopefully stay here again."
565703,9274315,2013-12-17,1905668,Thach,"Wow, such a stunning home! this place is a SERIOUS STEAL. It was so much nicer than ever the beautiful pictures portrayed. the hosts were awesome, they showed us around in the beginning and gave us some tips. no AirBnB host has ever done that for me before. they were really flexible, did not nitpick about noise at all. overall, this was the best airbnb experience i've had!"
565703,9321262,2013-12-21,10261971,Amanda,"Rons place has a very well decorated apartment filled with everything you need, including the basic spices for cooking! We stayed there 2 nights. As a family of 3 we used both bedrooms and installed a bed in the living room area. If you are sleeping in the living room or in the main bedroom, I would suggest to wear earplugs if you like to sleep-in in the morning as life noises from upstairs can be disturbing in the early morning. Ron was a great communicator during the whole process. The surrounding area was also very pleasant. "
565703,9372447,2013-12-24,6424976,Eugenia,"Ron's place was a home away from home. We had the whole mini apartment to ourselves. The place was clean and comfortable, the neighborhood was safe. As it is not near the city centre, it does take a while for you to go anywhere. 

Ron is extremely friendly. He specially dropped by to check if everything was going well and if we were facing any issue.

The only issue we faced was the fact that the fire alarm is extremely sensitive as it kept ringing even though we were only boiling pasta. 

Tip: Bear with the cold and leave the door open if you want to cook.  "
565703,9584489,2014-01-03,7776486,Jennie,"We had a delightful time in Seattle and were very comfortable coming back each day to our Garden Apartment.  Ron went to extra lengths to help make our stay enjoyable.  From coffee filters, shampoo, comfortable beds and soft sheets it felt more like home and not a sterile motel room.  Thanks so much Ron!  "
565703,9688710,2014-01-05,2007812,Katherine,"Ron's Garden Apt was a perfect place to stay for our brief visit to Seattle. Situated in a lovely neighbourhood with great restaurants, cafe's / bakeries and so close to the Arboretum. 
The apartment was well appointed, clean and cozy. Beds were super comfortable. We were sorry not to be able to use the deck, but have no doubt it is a wonderful feature when the weather is better.
Ron was very helpful and made sure that we were familiar with the place, was always quick to respond to emails and was a great host. Highly recommend!"
565703,9837554,2014-01-13,10912378,Anthony,I thought this apartment was awesome. It was in the Perfect location in relation to getting to South Lake Union and SeaTac. We took the bus going to both. The apartment had a great little kitchen and two bedrooms. The owners where very accommodating and it was such a steal for the price. I really enjoyed staying there and can't wait to stay there again. Thank you Ron and Mike.   
565703,10032427,2014-01-27,3845077,James,"Ron has a fantastic place in the Maddison Park area of Seattle.  We loved this, what a great area. Try the fresh baked bread from the bakery cafe on the corner of MLK and Maddison, or Cafe Flora just up the road."
565703,10092493,2014-01-30,11073431,Jon,"Very nice and quiet apartment. We were up in Seattle for work so we did not spend a whole lot of time, but the beds were very comfortable, and the neighborhood was quite. Exactly what we were looking for."
565703,10184418,2014-02-04,11561296,Shea,"Beautiful apartment; very open and in a very quiet neighborhood, which makes it ideal for either coming back to after a night out or spending a relaxing day at home.  Conveniently located to bus lines that take you directly downtown, and lots of food options within walking distance.  The hosts were stellar -- they stopped in to provide some basic info about the apartment, gave us advice and help when we asked, but didn't bother us at all."
565703,10425701,2014-02-18,6313251,Jason,We had a great stay! Everything we needed was near the apartment and it was great to stay in a place outside of downtown. The apartment had everything our family of 3 needed.
565703,10786690,2014-03-07,10390927,Micah,"Nestled on the eastern portion of Capitol Hill this apartment is both very comfortable and conveniently located. For myself I found it very easy to get to and from downtown Seattle using the bus stops close to the unit. However, it was just far enough away that I never heard the bus or nearby traffic. The surrounding neighborhood was also very quiet and relaxing.

Ron was an excellent host who communicated promptly and with excellent advise on directions. Besides a quick chat to get to know each other he was very respectful of my privacy. In fact I never heard him upstairs besides a little shuffling of feet and some movement of furniture. The only negative part of the unit was that the garden wasn't green, but what else do you expect during late winter?

The utilities and furnishings were in excellent condition. Further, the queen bed was wonderful. 

It was a relaxing haven in the city to return to after busy days of exploring all Seattle had to offer."
565703,11012690,2014-03-17,2014641,Katy,"We had a lovely time in Seattle. Ron is a wonderful host and we enjoyed staying in his apartment. The fact that we had a place where we could relax with our daughter as well as other family members was a great blessing to us. Thanks, Ron!"
565703,11150718,2014-03-23,12049576,Mitchell,"The apartment was splendid; comfortable and attractive, in a peaceful neighborhood, ideal for 2 singles or 2 couples. And Ron, our host, was simply wonderful, as warm and welcoming a host as you'd wish. This was our first experience of airbnb, and staying at Ron's place has left us delighted with our time in Seattle. (As a long-time Angeleno, however, I must mention that it's almost always worth carrying a jacket in Seattle!)"
565703,11244972,2014-03-26,12296103,Gadi,"Hi 
My wife and my daughter as well as myself enjoyed our stay in Ron and Michael's garden apartment very much. The apartment is well equipped and when we missed something the landlords were quick to supply it. The garden apartment is in a very quite and  nice neighborhood not too far from the center of Seattle. 
Thanks so much for your kind hospitality

565703,12215127,2014-04-26,11569476,Grace,Run，是个很好很热情的人，虽然我的英文不好没有太多交流，但是给我留下了深刻印象，你接待了我的朋友，房间很舒适很干净，还帮我们打印，住所周边环境很好，用餐和超市都不算远，距离市中心比较近，非常感谢Run。      Grace
565703,12453005,2014-05-03,8384503,James,"Our stay in the Garden Apartment was very pleasant. The location was ideal, within a short walk of Madison with shops and restaurants. The apartment was quiet with a well equipped kitchen which allowed us to cook some of our meals. Ron, the owner was onsite and checked in almost every day. We highly recommend this apartment.  "
565703,12813816,2014-05-12,2294045,Dano,"Perfect location.  I used to live nearby, so I know!   Quiet, lots of parking, easy to talk to the village in Madison Valley, or catch a bus to downtown or local Broadway/Capitol Hill bars/restaurants/parks.  The apt was spacious, clean, and very comfortable.  The kitchen was outfitted with a full sized stove, fridge, and microwave so it was easy to cook and save $$ (as well as calories!) from eating out all the time.  Another treat was having a washer/dryer in the unit, especially when staying for several days it comes in handy."
565703,12963202,2014-05-15,7875986,Inka,"This apartment was really cozy and well equipped. Backyard patio was lovely place to enjoy breakfast. Area is near downtown and all services, yet very safe and quiet. Just few hundred meters you can find nice restaurants and grocery stores. Access to Lake Washington is also good especially during the hot spring and summer months. Our host Ron was super friendly and communicating with him was easy and fast. 
"
565703,13238722,2014-05-23,12578141,Erich,"Ron´s garden apartment is a nice place in a safe neighborhood in beautiful Madison Valley. The apartment is well equipped with all the necessities you need. Downtown Seattle can easily be reached by public transport. The location is reasonable priced and I can recommend it anytime.

565703,13401739,2014-05-27,4140348,David,"House is in a very quiet neighborhood and was extremely convenient for going to Seattle Center, food stores, and a nice breakfast bakery 3 blocks away.   If we ever are back in Seattle with just my immediate family (3 persons) we will absolutely use Ron's BnB again.
This BnB is actually just the 1st B - host DOSE NOT PROVIDE BREAKFAST.  There is a very complete kitchen provided.  Also, please note that this really is only for THREE people.  The host provides an air mattress for the 4th but there really is no space to put the mattress that gives that person any privacy - putting it in the living room turned out to be inconvenient for all since we had to walk past it on the way to the only bathroom."
565703,13599835,2014-06-01,11723388,Stefan,It was a great experience.. Ron is a very friendly host. He supported us well. The Appartement is very very clean. The Kirchen is perfect. The terrace is beautiful with the sunshine. Great recommandation and thanks a lot.
565703,13784751,2014-06-04,6222038,Moritz,Ron's apartment was an excellent place to stay with enough room for the for of us. And parking was possible right in front of the apartment!
565703,14024300,2014-06-10,14279921,Angela,Kind and accommodating and I always got a quick response to questions or concerns.  
565703,14154041,2014-06-13,15021233,Ey,"We were quite satisfied with the apartment - its quiet and interesting neighborhood,walking distance to the park, Japanese garden, cafes, and even a nursery. Convenient for attending our niece's graduation at the University of Washington as well as for going to downtown. This apartment has everything a traveler needs. Ron is a very responsible and responsive host.

"
565703,14398865,2014-06-18,5620161,David,Ron was a great host to my friends and I. I met him right when I was checking out and he was very kind to us. He is very easy to communicate with and friendly. I would book again with Ron if I ever come back to Seattle. 
565703,14852457,2014-06-28,2183550,Meg,"Great location, lovely place and exactly as pictured. Thanks for a great stay!"
565703,15035889,2014-07-01,13395867,Ricardo,"Ron was great and his apartment truly felt like a home away from home. The location is so perfect, it is a quick bus ride into the downtown area and an even quicker drive. Ron greeted my friend and I kindly and gave us some great tips on how to get around using the public transit system. I will definitely be on the lookout for his apartment during my next visit to Seattle!"
565703,15566782,2014-07-12,11476796,Laurent,"A very well situated housse. Close from the center, the town, the beach and the supermarket. Very quiet. The apartment is well furnished. Ron has been very friendly with us and helpfull."
565703,15750432,2014-07-15,1181382,Marly,We had a thoroughly delightful stay in this very well situated compact apartment in a quiet neighborhood.   All directions and instructions were clear and we settled in very easily.  Because of the warm weather we could enjoy the use of the little private deck for our meals.  Parking was available right by our door.  Ron was discrete but checked in to see that all was well.   We would stay there again. 
565703,15961457,2014-07-19,16250706,Cynthia,"The Garden Apartment is a ""home away from home.""  The outdoor area made the stay even more enjoyable.  The location is perfect making Seattle exploration easily accessible.  Ron was a gracious and generous host and we greatly appreciate his recommendations and area information.  We would, and have, highly recommended the Garden Apartment to others."
565703,16078853,2014-07-22,14512787,Mathias,"A nice little apartment in a quiet area, but still very close to downtown by car or bus. Definitely a good place to come back to at the end of the day after being out in the city. The amenities are awesome, and include everything I needed. Everything was nice, clean, and well maintained."
565703,17814388,2014-08-18,10937564,Paz,"Hemos estado hospedados en este garden apartamentos 24 días y, si pudiéramos, repetiríamos. Somos españoles y el motivo de nuestro viaje era visitar a nuestro hijo que trabaja en Seattle. Algunos días, él se quedó con nosotros y pudimos comprobar que el apartamento es perfecto para tres personas.
Cuando entramos en la casa, todo estaba preparado para recibirnos: había flores del jardín en los jarrones, música de fondo y una vela encendida.
El anfitrión es un auténtico profesional con mucho interés por tu bienestar.

nous avons été accueilli très chaleureusement, bien que nous ayons averti au dernier moment de l'heure denotre arrivée....
L'appartement ,très cosy, correspondait tout à fait à notre attente.
La localisation dans un endroit calme a été très appréciable après une journée passée  à visiter le centre ville.
Merci pour tout Ron !.

565703,18190452,2014-08-23,10643766,Ora,Ron was a wonderful host. The apartment is in a great location and is clean and cozy. 
565703,18647233,2014-08-30,13156056,Kirsty,"Late arriving at our accommodation so the 'key in the locked box' system was useful.  The local area was nice and it was easy enough to get into central Seattle on the 8 or 11 buses (we also used the 43, which was another block away but seemed more frequent).  The apartment had soft beds and everything that we needed.  Noise from above was an issue one morning but overall we had a good experience and Ron was very helpful."
565703,18875483,2014-09-02,16096346,Aubrey,"Host was extremely accommodating. We went in the wrong direction from the bus stop and instead of merely correcting our course when we called him, Ron came and picked us up. The apartment was well furnished and exactly what we were looking for. A great experience was had!"
565703,19023172,2014-09-05,15830465,Lynn,It was a great experience staying at Ron's Garden Apartment. The site was clean and welcoming. I really appreciated the coffee and coffee maker! The rose was beautiful and made us feel welcomed.
565703,19526184,2014-09-14,5174426,Andre,"Ron was a very nice host. The apartment is very cute and well located, just 3mi from downtown. Wished we would have had more time to explore Seattle. Bring earplugs against the noise from neighbors. Nothing too bad though."
565703,20005153,2014-09-22,17189202,Christine,"I loved this apartment. It was clean, comfortable, and fit the description. There were no surprises! I loved being able to walk to numerous restaurants and was sorry I didn't get to try them all. I did not need to rent a car- it was a quick walk to the bus line. I also had to work remotely a few days while I was there and the apartment, and the neighborhood were quiet. The Wi-Fi was easy to use and the speed was perfect for logging in to the office. I have passed on Ron's info to a number of family members planning to visit Seattle in the near future and told them this would be the perfect place to stay."
565703,20548782,2014-10-01,4366296,Diane,Ron greeted us shortly after we arrived.  We did not talk with him afterward which was okay since we were familiar with the area.  Neighborhood is very nice.  Easy access to buses and several area restaurants.
565703,20720936,2014-10-04,21807823,Eric,"Good place to stay in Seattle. It's sort of like a duplex/triplex in that you get an entire house level to yourself so its very relaxing. Everything was comfortable and clean. There are also some interesting books to read in the  place :) (History of Weapons). 

Location wise, it's close by to a lot of cool bars and pubs and I'm pretty sure it must be in central Seattle or something because every place we went to during our stay was no more than 2-3 miles away (at least all the tourist-y things)."
565703,21048276,2014-10-10,5424241,Keegan,"Just outside of Capitol Hill this apartment is within 5 min. walking of multiple bus stops. Ron met us as we arrived and was very accommodating. Full kitchen, comfortable beds, and a quiet neighborhood -- recommended for 2-3 travelers. "
565703,21233011,2014-10-13,6660110,Vik,"Ron was responsive and helpful in getting us set up in his place. The space is like a home (not hotel), which helped us feel comfortable while staying. We brought our bikes and the location is surrounded by hills, which provided many opportunities for strengthening our legs. Otherwise, a clean and well-functioning space. "
565703,21656683,2014-10-21,20080046,Clebert,"My visit checklist:
Apartment: Perfect (check)
Location: Better than perfect (check)
Host: Pefect and available (check)
Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in a conveinent and cool neighborhood. Don't miss out on the Essential Bakery and Vegan Thai Restaurant around the corner. The bus was a block away and took me wherever I needed to go. Thanks Ron!"
565703,21800549,2014-10-24,12670133,Steve,"Accommodations were wonderful and Ron is an excellent host.  He went way out of his way to make me del welcome.  One night I lost my key and he got up, met me there and let me in.  He was even super friendly about it.  I highly recommend this place!"
565703,21896244,2014-10-26,744914,Nikki,"This apartment is cozy yet spacious. So close to downtown, yet it is in a quiet residential neighborhood. Some great shops, restaurants, and more right around the corner. We wish we could have spent more time there, but were in town for a conference so we were busy early and all day both days."
565703,22145167,2014-10-31,11280776,Dan,Loved our stay at Rons! Great location and more than enough space for us. Cafes and bus stops about 100m away. Would stay here again! 
565703,22297872,2014-11-03,17170720,Robyn,"My mother and grandmother stayed here while visiting me and they loved the apartment. Beautiful unit and easy walk to shopping/restaurants. And although we didn't get to meet Ron in person, he was a great communicator. Overall, I'd love to have family/friends stay here again!"
565703,23240001,2014-11-26,1206265,Kyle,Great location and wonderful host.  We would stay here again because it was so convenient to get around the city and nice to always have a safe place to park night and day.
565703,23538240,2014-12-03,18347638,Lynn,"The garden apartment in Madison Park is comfortable, artistic and in a GREAT location. Madison park and beach as well as the arboretum are in the neighborhood. The apartment is actually better than the pictures! There was good communication around check in with a simple lockbox - and classical music was playing when we arrived - very welcoming! Ron stayed in touch throughout the visit and made sure we had everything we needed. Great Seattle experience!"
565703,23765680,2014-12-09,17969761,Ciara,"Had a wonderful stay at Ron's Garden Apartment. Wonderful location and Ron greeted me and showed me around. Classical music was playing, so welcoming! The kitchen is fully stocked if you need to cook anything. Ron has a great CD collection and also free Wifi and Netflix. The added touch of candles around the apartment make it very cosey and homey. Ample parking and busses close in addition to restaurants  and cafe's. Ron even let me know day of check out not to rush and take my time as no one else was booked in. I would definitely  stay here again!!! I did hear some footsteps and muffled voices overhead one night but it didn't bother me in the slightest. "
565703,24012080,2014-12-16,24514789,Nick,Ron was super attentive and a great host. The apartment was very nice and in a great neighborhood. I would stay there any time! Highly recomended.
565703,24342264,2014-12-26,4363255,Danny,"Staying at the Garden Apartment was great. Check in / check out was super easy, Ron was very attentive (came over within minutes when the Wi-Fi wasn't working), and the apartment had all of the amenities. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
565703,25127140,2015-01-07,22221310,Sharon,"We really enjoyed staying at the garden apartment. It was very cosy and well equipped. Ron was a good host, very quick to respond if we had questions or needed anything. We really enjoyed the location, walking distance to great restaurants, cafés and shops and also close to downtown. We especially enjoyed the arboretum which was also within walking distance and Lake Washington. We will definitely try to book this place again on our next visit to Seattle.  It was a great home away from home. Highly recommend."
565703,25288080,2015-01-11,14105435,Justine,Ron's apartment was perfect for our weekend getaway in Seattle. The location was a quick Uber ride to Capitol Hill and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The apartment was cozy and comfortable for 3 people. Also super clean! 
565703,25506166,2015-01-18,2666280,Sarah,"Ron was great to work with -- prompt in his communication, helpful and friendly. The apartment was great, had everything we needed and comfortable. There's no dining table so we ate in the living room. The location is perfect, tucked away on a quiet street but a 5 minute walk to all the stores and restaurants in Madison Valley and bus lines."
565703,25800224,2015-01-26,874876,Gerry,We had a great stay at Ron's place.  Perfect for small families with two bedrooms and easy parking.  Less than 15 minutes to downtown.  The rooms were clean and comfortable.  Ron made it very easy to check in and out.  I would definitely stay here again and I would also recommend to friends.  
565703,26118049,2015-02-03,6093363,Rob,"Great place in a great neighborhood with wonderful privacy.  Ron's place was clean and spacious, the heaters worked great, and the decor was very welcoming.  I'd definitely stay there again... great deal!"

565703,26830562,2015-02-20,26742011,Daniel,"The Garden Apartment was both a convenient and comfortable staging point for our exploration of Seattle. Highlights include the nearby downtown bus, bakery/cafe, ample street parking, and proximity to Seattle's amazing Arboretum. 

The apartment itself had everything we needed, and was a cozy place to recharge between outings. Check-in/out was very smooth, and Ron was responsive when we contacted him.

The only problem we encountered was a guest upstairs with a particularly noisy morning routine. Ron contacted me later to apologize and let me know he would be more careful in the future, as well as informing upstairs tenants about minimizing morning noise.

Overall, we had a successful trip, and the place was a good fit for our needs."
565703,27363173,2015-03-02,22331623,Claudia,"This space was perfect for our group of three. Good location, responsive and accessible host, just as advertised, no surprises. It had everything that mattered: good location (with easy parking), a warm and clean space with good beds, good linen (including enough towels and good pillows), hot water (a warm bathroom), and a well-equipped kitchen. We were happy here, and we’ll be back.f

565703,28282293,2015-03-21,13359946,Sunyoung,"The suite was spacious and cozy. It was centrally located which was perfect as a starting point. We always had plenty of parking space just beside the house.  The kitchen had some basics such as salt and pepper, olive oil which was appreciated for making breakfast.  Rob responded to texts within 24 hours.  He was kind enough to deliver a package that arrived after we left to a family member's place.  Thanks  Ron!
"
565703,29280207,2015-04-06,27617233,Mary,"I booked Ron's apartment for two employees (brother's) who were visiting from out of town. Everything was as described and Ron provided great information for easy check in from SeaTac to the apartment. The location of the apartment was perfect to downtown and also capitol hill. Apartment was roomy and well stocked and very welcoming. Never had the chance to meet Ron, he was out of town but that was no problem."
565703,29920131,2015-04-14,28446196,Natalia,"Location of the apartment was very good for what I needed, very close to Convention centre which was my main venue for the whole stay. The apartment is located in very quiet and lovely neighbourhood too. The apartment had everything what was needed, iron, ironing board, kettle, pots etc. 
Ron was great host, unfortunatelly didn't get chance to meet him in person but he was really helpful through messages etc and he got his friend to look after things in case I need anything which was very kind of him.
Overall, great apartment, I will come back if I'm in Seattle again.

Nice and bright during the day with windows all around and sliding glass doors to a private yard.  Ron certainly made us feel welcome. He was always available to answer questions and he came by for a nice conversation. The area is fabulous.  We took a long walk on gentle hills through a beautiful residential neighborhood to Lake Washington viewpoint.  A couple of blocks to stores including great coffee place.  It's also a great central place for beginning car drives in all directions."
565703,30285998,2015-04-20,27011360,Caryn,"This was a perfectly cute place for us to stay and suited our needs.  The amenities are all there. Nice location. Would stay here again. There isn't much of an indoor dining area, but that wasn't an issue for us. Thanks"

We really enjoyed the residential feel of the neighbourhood and the great walk to the Arboretum which is very close. Ron himself was the very essence of graciousness and responded to our needs extremely well. As my wife said - he seems to be what people think of when they say a truly sincere and nice person - and very hospitable. it was clear our experience was very important to him.

565703,32087532,2015-05-13,27322052,Layla,"The Garden Apartment was pretty much as described, and provided a cozy place to rest during a challenging workshop.  The art and books were nice touches to add to the cozy feel.  I rented the space with a colleague and we each stayed in our own bedrooms which provided a good separation of noise.  The kitchen space was nicely appointed with a few basics still available from the last renters.  

The neighborhood was within walking distance of grocery, dining, and various attractions, and a great place to be located in the city.

We were met by Ron's Partner Mike as we arrived, serendipitously, as he was attending to the last few preparation tasks.  He showed us around the place, and went out of his way to find an ironing board for my roommate.  Ron was very communicative and friendly and I would definitely recommend it to others!   "

There was a lovely coffee/lunch cafe only a block away.  An added bonus for us was that it was only a few blocks away from our daughter.  Seems to be a pretty nice and quiet neighborhood.
There is some interesting art on the walls that I would have liked to have known more about. 
We would definitely return to the garden apartment."

There are shops and cafes nearby, as well as a Japanese garden in Washington Park that's worth a visit. All in all, a positive experience."
565703,36941622,2015-07-03,23524721,Laurie,"Although we didn't meet Ron in person, our communications via email and text were good, and Ron was friendly and quick to respond.  The apartment was great - just right for me and my two teenagers. Well-equipped with everything you would need.  Ron even left me two cold beers in the fridge, which were greatly appreciated and enjoyed on the lovely patio. Great colors/artwork/decor etc.  Weather was unseasonably hot and we requested a fan, which Ron promptly delivered (thank you Ron!). Apartment had everything we needed for our 4-night stay.  Location was wonderful, 10-15 minutes by car to anywhere."
565703,37486457,2015-07-07,22658631,Greg,"This apartment was the perfect stay while visiting Seattle. It was close to a few good restaurants and cafes, close to the bridge for going to them mountains, down the street from a beautiful trail, and not far from downtown. Ron created a very clean and comfortable environment. We really appreciated his hospitality. He even was hospitable to give his personal recommendations. Very friendly. I would stay here again."
565703,38261776,2015-07-14,31034787,Quinn,"Great place in quiet neighborhood. This two bedroom place worked perfectly for our family of four on our trip to visit friends and family in capitol Hill. 

The place was small but charming. Getting in and out was very easy, Ruth easy parking. Having a full kitchen and dedicated bedrooms was way better than a hotel for us. 

"
565703,38559590,2015-07-16,38103538,Cherie,"Highly recommend Ron's apartment! It's comfortable, clean, in a great location and has everything we needed, including a hair dryer. "
565703,39588104,2015-07-24,3829370,Jeff,Loved it. 
565703,39882948,2015-07-26,7548340,Till,"Just a perfect stay, thanks Ron"
565703,40252562,2015-07-29,13651449,Claire,Ron's apartment was just as described.  He made myself and my co-worker feel at home between our long days of meetings.  The bed was AMAZING.  And the location is prime for getting to various locations both in the city and the suburbs.  The amenities were as described and I would absolutely stay again.  
565703,40481671,2015-07-31,37446246,Hongjie,"It was nice and comfortable to live in the apartment. It was good feeling when entering the room with playing CD music ( Ron played it before my arrival). 

You could feel the artist style from details, such as the painting, the picture and other knick-knacks. All of this made the room comfortable and relaxed. We used the air mattress for the fourth people, it was comfortable.

Overall, it's good place to live in during travel. Thanks Ron!"
565703,40807512,2015-08-02,33612370,Nicole,"Ron made us feel very welcomed and was very prompt in responding to questions/emails/text. Apt is in a GREAT location and he added nice touches like fresh flowers and light music playing upon arrival. The people upstairs were pretty noisy stomping around early mornings (before 7) and late at night (up until about midnight), but the house was very, very quiet besides that. All in all it was a great stay and we would absolutely use Ron again!"
565703,41208837,2015-08-05,33451234,Ryan,"Ron was awesome! He had everything ready when I arrived, the apartment was clean and well taken care of. Music was playing as I entered the building and I felt right at home.

Nice neighborhood with plenty of parking. Close to downtown and almost everything in the Seattle area."
565703,41925115,2015-08-10,30180637,Michael,I felt very welcomed to the apartment.  The soft music upon entrance was a wonderful touch.  The kitchen was well equipped and the temperature was perfect.  Fans kept fresh air moving through the apartment.  The location was also good for exploring Seattle. It was near bus lines that can take you downtown and to the Seattle Center.  Breathe hot yoga was about a 15min walk away and was a perfect activity for my stay in Seattle.  
565703,42660537,2015-08-15,8095302,Jessica,Ron was very welcoming and easy to communicate with both electronically and in person.  The Garden Apartment was just as described and in a very nice part of Seattle for walking and public transportation.  
565703,42904766,2015-08-16,34117771,Bob,"We checked in later than expected. Ron left a couple of lights on for us as well as some background music. Nice touch. The place was spacious, neat, well stocked and well arranged. It was the perfect spot for us."
565703,43053536,2015-08-17,35657531,Ginevra,Everything was as advertised. Great communication. Thank you!
565703,44107882,2015-08-24,31524030,Donald,Perfect place for us; close to friends and Madison is wonderful area for dining and shopping. Accommodations are ample. Ron is very responsive and attentive. 
565703,44459509,2015-08-26,40423735,Brad,The listing was exactly as described.  Ron was a thorough and kind host.
565703,44677724,2015-08-28,36069195,MingChi,Everything is awesome ! We have a really great time in Seattle
565703,45274265,2015-09-01,18141801,Swaminathan,"Ron provided us all the information that we needed to let ourselves in upon arrival.  The apartment is entered from a simple yard abutting the curbside, and we found the apartment to be exactly as described on the inside.  In fact, we found that his Garden Apartment has a lot to offer, and we wish we had stayed longer to appreciate and enjoy all of it.  The Apartment comes with a full kitchen, a patio, a cozy living room, comfortable beds in 2 bedrooms and a good shower.  We found the decorations appealing as well.  Since the apartment is the ground floor of their home, you do hear sounds of people moving about but this did not bother us too much.

While we had a full kitchen at our disposal, we opted to eat dinner at the Harvest Vine and breakfast at the Essential Baking Co. (both superb, and just about 2 blocks away).  

Ron was prompt in answering our questions (such as how to lock up upon departure).  I would recommend this to anyone needing a place for 3 people to stay in the Capitol Hill area.  "
565703,47151481,2015-09-16,36716035,Victoria,"Ron came by to welcome me to the apartment and to make sure I was happy with the workings of the place.  The apt. was clean, well-stocked, and bright and cheery.  The neighborhood is urban residential and very pleasant.  The buses into Seattle are only a few blocks away, so it's very easy to go sight seeing; a car is not necessary.  This was a very good location for me, and the apt. felt very homey."
565703,49205175,2015-10-02,28778900,Erica,"My family is very satisfied with this stay! Ron is super helpful and the apartment is clean and well-located. The neighborhood is quiet and safe. The downtown bus is 5 minute walk away which is very convenient.
Definitely will recommend! "
565703,50721735,2015-10-13,18764260,Bianca,Such a cozy little place! This was my first time using AirBnB and I felt very comfortable staying at Ron's apartment! It was in a cute neighborhood just walking distance from restaurants and the bus stop. It was very clean... he even had music playing for us when we first walked in! Although we never had the pleasure of meeting him he still made sure we were having a pleasant trip one of the 3 days we were there. I definitely recommend staying here :)
565703,51325936,2015-10-19,23301474,Jodi,Great host; great space.
565703,51790965,2015-10-24,20448298,Jeff,"Ron's place was great. Reality matched the photos. Parking was a breeze. Two of my favorite restaurants are just around the corner.  And, the key lock box makes checking in and out super easy."
565703,54036111,2015-11-15,15499436,Kristin,"The apartment is lovely and quiet, just as pictured. I especially enjoyed the living room and was pleased to find a stereo and CDs, as well as an interesting selection of books. The colors and the art are very restful; just what I needed after a months-long period of intense work.

The kitchen was very clean and fully stocked with all of the dishes, utensils and pans I needed. I'd opted not to rent a car during my eight-day stay, and not feeling well my first day there, I had groceries delivered from Central Co-op. It was wonderful to have the option to cook and stay in, snuggled up in one of Ron's colorful handmade afghans.

The apartment is within walking distance of the Arboretum and Japanese Garden; this was one of the reasons I initially selected it. I should note that I was very surprised at the hilliness of the area: If you're a walker, as I am, you'll enjoy the challenge. If not, the bus stop is right there and transit looks easy. I chose to walk or use Uber, which was convenient. Pick-ups were quick: never waited more than 3 minutes at the apartment.

Ron could not have been more accommodating. I arrived a few minutes early and was happy to find the key in the lock box. I'd barely set my bags down when he knocked on the door and welcomed me. 

Hearing that I'd shattered my phone when I stepped off the plane, Ron immediately offered suggestions on where to have it repaired economically. He checked in by message a couple of times during the week to see if I'd been able to get it fixed and to make sure all was well.

My flight out was not until 8 p.m. on Saturday, and Ron graciously offered to let me use his locked shed to store my luggage so that I could enjoy my last day in Seattle without having to worry about lugging anything around in the rain.

I truly hated packing up and leaving my peaceful little oasis. I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a restful, beautiful, comfortable space."
565703,55077635,2015-11-27,49678263,Yunchuan,"The location is easy to access, super quiet, just few mins away from the city center!
Plenty of spaces for parking too!

Ron is a very nice host, he provides us very helpful information and suggestions!"
565703,55257201,2015-11-29,459104,Marley,"The garden apartment was wonderful for our Thanksgiving stay. Perfectly cozy, warm, and perfectly located just off the bus line into downtown! We loved how well stocked the kitchen was for cooking breakfast. Definitely recommending Ron's place to friends who are visiting Seattle!"
565703,56108626,2015-12-09,11163143,Kathleen,"The Garden Apartment is in a good location. The neighborhood is very quiet, the small shops and restaurants nearby are within easy walking distance. On street parking is also easy to find, usually right next to or across the street from the apartment. The apartment itself has electric wall or free standing space heaters which did a good job of keeping things warm. There is also excellent water pressure and plenty of hot water. Ron was easy to communicate with and we had talked by text message during and after the rental process. He very graciously brought us tissues, shampoo, conditioner and soap when we messaged him that these items were not in the apartment. "
565703,56656612,2015-12-16,2067696,Jacinta,"Lovely spot - thanks so much for having us, Ron. We felt very comfortable :)"

565703,58019785,2015-12-31,426939,Christina,My friends and I had a great time staying at Roses garden apartment - it was super close to a bunch of tasty restaurants and quick to get downtown via bus or uber. The place was wonderfully decorated and we felt very relaxed and welcome. 
4349344,22927546,2014-11-17,3894682,Chris,"I had a wonderful stay at the Sweet Retreat. Hasna and her sister, Leila, were extremely communicative and accessible. The apartment was cozy, clean, and comfortable. Location was fantastic! I would highly recommend the Sweet Retreat as a perfect place to stay while in Seattle."
4349344,23220678,2014-11-25,2414691,Annah,"My best friend and I can't be happier with the Sweet Retreat. Both Hasna and Leila are excellent communicators and the most gracious hosts. The apartment is most excellent, the neighbourhood most perfect. Everything you need for the perfect Seattle stay is here. Would love to come back. Thanks, ladies!"
4349344,23391484,2014-11-30,23506563,Roberta,"We were welcomed graciously by Leila.  The apartment was as advertised.  Very comfortable and convenient for visiting with our children who live in the neighborhood.  A great neighborhood with shops and restaurants close by and public transportation to downtown if needed.  We appreciated the parking space, too.  Thank you for your hospitality, Leila and Hasna."
