227636,5381045,2013-06-27,6447573,Eric,"Michael and his wife are fantastic! The place is incredibly nice, and the pictures are 100% what you can expect. Though it is a basement unit, they have taken great care to make it a fully-functioning apartment unit, and we never heard so much as a footstep from the floor above! The hosts are accommodating and welcoming, and clearly respected our space (but were there if we needed anything). I highly, highly recommend staying here!"
227636,5418656,2013-06-29,1523198,Pam,"The apartment was perfect! There were lots of nice little touches -- coffee, creamer, a hair dryer, and more! The apartment gave us lots of room so we didn't feel crowded. Every room was squeaky clean: I was very impressed! The wireless internet was excellent! The owners, who live above, were super helpful if help was needed, and left us alone the rest of the time. We had a little tiny bit of difficulty finding the place the first time, but after that, we discovered that the location is excellent. Easy to get around to and from, with great restaurants close by. I would HIGHLY recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Seattle!!"
227636,5600441,2013-07-08,6024752,Ellen,Michael and his family were the ideal hosts. We felt extremely welcomed and comfortable. Communication was open and easy. I would recommend this vacation rental to any of my friends and family. We fully intend to stay here again if a situation arises where we need a place to stay in Seattle for more than a few days. Great experience!!!!
227636,5693855,2013-07-12,6547763,Andrea,"Great basement suite, large and comfortable, has everything we needed for our 3 night stay. Michael, Jean Louise, and Cash were very friendly and wonderful hosts. A great location and such a positive experience!!"
227636,6018725,2013-07-27,4624449,Ady,"We were a family of three and stayed for 2 weeks.  This is a very convenient and comfortable apartment.  Michael was very helpful and since they were having a flower shop as business and therefore most of the day, there were either Michael or his wife stayed at the gargage.  Therefore we are able to get information or talk to them.  During the stay, our rental car was impounded. That was most likely because we parked too close to the driveway of the neighbor's house.  Parking on the street is always full and it seems to me that his neighbors were not that friendly. Other than that, everything seems perfect to us.  I would recommend it to anyone."
227636,6129578,2013-07-31,2523044,Phil,Great place to stay.  Michael was very accommodating.  Convenient to downtown and very close to the Ballard Locks.
227636,6235077,2013-08-05,5198942,Michael,"We just returned from a wonderful stay in Seattle. Michael and Jean Louise were great hosts -- communication prior to our arrival was easy and prompt, and they were available for questions during our stay, too. They also left a helpful list of restaurants, grocery stores, and local attractions in the apartment, which was great!

The apartment was a perfect size for us (two adults and an infant), and the location is ideal. I would highly recommend this apartment!"
227636,6314023,2013-08-07,4006986,Paris,"Michael and Jean Louise were fantastic hosts. Very pleasant and accommodating. Their space was extremely clean, quaint and cozy. We were fortunate to have some of the most beautiful weather in Seattle and it was nice to sit out in their cute little backyard and soak up the sun.  As per Micheal’s suggestion, we explored the trendy Ballard Ave (10 min walk) with it’s amazing restaurants and bars, and had some of the best oysters we’ve ever had. Check-in and check-out was effortless. We would highly recommend this property for your stay in the Seattle area. "
227636,6483015,2013-08-14,5587157,Lillian,"Very convenient and pleasant place to stay. It was clean, roomy and had everything we needed. Hosts were helpful. The flowers were beautiful. We would stay here again. "
227636,6681127,2013-08-21,5454223,Gary,"> Communication with Michael was very good.  The apartment was much like the photos.  The walk- in closet really helped to keep us organized.  All rooms were good size.  The bed and futon were comfortable.  We did not have a car, so the bus stops close by were great.  It was a nice walk into Ballard.  Some walking routes in the area did not seem as nice, so it's a good idea to be aware ahead of time. Michael and his wife and sweet 5 year old son live above.  We heard them moving around sometimes, mostly in the early morning when their son would wake up, or early evening. This was not a problem for us, but just want to let people know.  Keep in mind, this is a basement apartment, so there are few windows.  A screen on the bedroom window would have been nice so that we could have opened it for air.  The tv remote control needs to be replaced.  There are a few other cosmetic things that could be mentioned, but the price we paid was good, and we felt we got our money's worth.  The washing machine and dryer were a bonus and both worked great.  As mentioned by others, lots of things are provided in the kitchen and bathroom to make your stay easier.  One last thing... if you won't have a car, get a street map of Seattle before you arrive.  We tried and tried, all over the place, to locate one and could not.  The visitor centers we visited did not have them.  GPS will get you wherever you want to go, but we still wanted to see the overview of where we were coming from / traveling to.  Too late we realized the downtown library would probably have had some that we could make copies of.  We've traveled to many large cities, never had this problem and didn't think we had to bring one with us.  Last recommendation for Michael - if guests will not be bringing a car, have street maps for them in the apartment, as well as current bus schedules for the bus stops located nearby.

227636,7032714,2013-09-04,5122204,Minda,"Great location for us during our visit to Seattle while visiting our son who lives in Ballard.  We enjoyed the closeness of grocery stores and good dining. The accommodations are not fancy, but perfectly adequate, clean, and  convenient.  Michael is a welcoming, low key host."
227636,7215566,2013-09-11,5881836,Sarah,"Michael was a great host! He stayed up to meet us as we had a late flight, even though he had said he might just leave the key out so we could let ourselves in. The apartment was lovely and comfortable, the kitchen fully equipped (very helpful since we have a 1-year-old and didn't want to eat out for every meal!), and Michael even let us borrow their pack n play so we didn't have to bring one for our daughter to sleep in. We also had our mother-in-law with us for part of our vacation to help with the baby when we went to a wedding, and Michael did not charge us for having an extra person for part of our stay. He answered all of our questions promptly, his whole family was very friendly, and made our first time using AirBnB a great success!"
227636,7545815,2013-09-24,6049128,Audrey,"We love this apartment - comfortable, secure, clean, convenient, perfect size for 3 adults, great hosts!  The best part is the large & fully equipped kitchen since we love to cook and wanted to eat all the local, in season food available at the Ballard markets and surrounding areas. Another plus is the washer/dryer just for our use, inside the apartment - just like home, and the beautiful flowers we could see everyday in their flower shop.  The street parking can be a little crowded depending on the time you're coming back.  We definitely will stay with the Allen's again!"
227636,7681168,2013-09-29,8858704,Margaret,"Michael and Jean-Louise's apartment was charming, roomy and clean. My husband and were able to walk half a block to the bus and even do some laundry in the apartment. Soap, extra blankets and basic cooking ingredients were provided. There was even a fireplace with a fire starter log and firewood. Overall we very much enjoyed our stay and will remember them if we make it back to Seattle again."
227636,8109921,2013-10-16,6948657,Karen,"We are more than pleased with our stay with Michael and Jean Louise.
They have a well appointed apartment in their home and we enjoyed our stay with them.
We had everything that we needed and we felt very comfortable during our stay with them.
We look forward to staying with them again if they have the time available when we are in Seattle."
227636,8278154,2013-10-23,7219999,Claudia,"The basement apartment was  spotless, albet a little less quiet than i expected. If your a light sleeper and like to sleep in, you can hear noises from above you. If that is NOT a problem for you; the apartment, and privacy is clean, private and comfortable. My host was very kind and amenable. I will be back! "
227636,8385521,2013-10-28,3811127,Amy,"Great location.   Awesome hosts.   Large, comfortable space.   Would definitely stay here again.  "
227636,8778973,2013-11-18,19557,Kirsten,"We had a fantastic stay at this fabulous apartment!!! Communication with Michael & Jean Louise was easy and they were very responsive to any questions we had. The apartment was perfect! It was spotless and looked exactly like the pictures on Airbnb. It had everything we needed and Jean Louse even left us eggs and cream for the morning and a nice bottle of wine for the evening. The location worked well for us and we never had a problem with parking. We highly recommend this Ballard apartment and we will stay here again in the future!!!
Thanks Michael & Jean Louise"
227636,9243657,2013-12-16,7605348,Andrea,"We really enjoyed staying at Michael's place in Ballard. Spacious and comfortable and has everything you'll need for a short or long stay (nice kitchen, washer/dryer, comfortable bed, and pull-out couch). The herbal tea and a bottle of wine were a nice touch that we fully enjoyed. The house is well situated, near good restaurants and access to  the 99 and 5 freeways. We will stay here again."
227636,9323051,2013-12-21,516345,Alicia,"We had a wonderful stay at Michael's apartment. The place was immaculate and the bed super comfy with tons of pillows (just how I like it!). We loved having a full kitchen where we could fix meals, and there's a Trader Joe's just a short drive away. Michael was a very kind and considerate host and recommended some great restaurants. "
227636,9419610,2013-12-28,5445643,Karl,"All the comforts of home, with just about every amenity imagineable!"
227636,10099892,2014-01-31,9535813,Torrey,"My wife and I stayed here for all of January 2014, and have no regrets.  

It is a comfortable basement suite, with a private entrance. The helpful and friendly owners live upstairs. We were able to park on the street, usually very close, sometimes just at the end of the block.

First impressions were excellent: Fresh cupcakes, a bag of locally roasted coffee, a bar of local chocolate, a bottle of wine... We appreciated little touches like the pint beer glass in the freezer. 

The apartment has a comfortable couch, TV with Netflix and cable, reliable WiFi, and a bedroom with a large closet. The private laundry machines worked well. There's a fireplace too.  The kitchen is pretty good, with a large fridge, stove, microwave, coffee maker, and cooking equipment.  We cooked and ate in the apartment all month without serious limitations. The bathroom is also good and the bathtub has water jets.  The bedroom is quiet and dark for sleeping. 

There's not much negative to say... it is a basement suite, and so as you'd expect, during the Seattle winter it can be a bit dark, and can get chilly if it's really cold outside. However, it isn't completely underground. There are windows that you can see out of and allow some direct sunlight in, and some effective heaters.  

The owners upstairs were available to help, although we didn't have many problems. One night Netflix glitched and required a re-login, and they came down and fixed it immediately. Thanks!

The bottom line is this was a comfortable and very practical place to live for a month.  We recommend it.
"
227636,10312397,2014-02-12,11403246,Myles,"I've never used Airbnb. My brother recommended this site. Jean-Louise, Michael and Cash were great hosts. It's hard staying a week in a hotel. This was my own clean, cozy place, to come home to every night. This wonderful family left me coffee, cookies, wine and the list goes on. I will definitely recommend and go back to visit this great family."
227636,10419763,2014-02-18,10769824,Brad,"The single best Airbnb experience we've had. The space was gorgeous, the amenities were fantastic, the owners were extremely friendly and went above and beyond (they run a flower shop and left flowers in the apartment for my girlfriend, since we flew in on Valentine's Day; also, we were running late for a wedding and they were gracious enough to wrap our wedding gift as we got ready)... also, the neighborhood is great. We'd love to stay here again."
227636,10663176,2014-03-02,5878631,Denise,"A very cozy and comfortable apartment!  Everything you need has been provided by the welcoming hosts.  Lovely neighborhood, too.  I would not hesitate to stay here again!"
227636,10864542,2014-03-10,12744347,Elizabeth,"The property was nice and spacious and is in a pleasant location.  It was easy to find, and it was not overly difficult to find parking along the street.  There was plenty of room for my friend and me.  There were beautiful cut flowers throughout the apartment, and Michael was considerate to leave half-and-half, eggs, and coffee for us; he even printed out a list of all of the microbreweries within walking distance, since he knew we were interested in craft beer!  This is a wonderful property, and I would not hesitate to stay here again.  Thanks again!"
227636,11706063,2014-04-13,8341323,Chuck,"Michael, Jean-Louise, and Cash welcomed me warmly. I stayed an entire month, sometimes bringing my 5 month old grandson over to enjoy their backyard in the afternoon and thereby having the opportunity to enjoy Cash and his friends as they played in the yard. Once Cash even rushed into the house to put on a costume for my enjoyment! I felt like part of the family as I discussed plant care with Jean-Louise or watched as she created some floral magic. 
Other reviews will let you in on all the amenities of the apartment, all of which were wonderful. I loved feeling like I was coming home each evening rather than to a rental. Thank you all for being so friendly."
227636,12661076,2014-05-07,7534509,Angela,"Our experience at Michael's space was absolutely amazing! He was very accommodating, helping us arrange transportation to and from the airport, giving us advice on nearby eateries, encouraging us on a business venture we were undertaking while in Seattle, and helping us deal with a luggage malfunction problem on our last night! He was accessible when we needed him but otherwise hands-off, which was perfect. The space is wonderful and peaceful. The bed was so comfortable and the entire apartment was very clean and spacious. We were greeted with fresh flowers all around the apartment, and homemade cupcakes and a bottle of wine in the kitchen. I could not have asked for a more enjoyable stay!"
227636,12832073,2014-05-12,13822160,Gretchen,"Michael and Jean Louise were great hosts. The space was just as advertised and a nice alternative to a hotel. We really appreciated the little touches of the eggs and coffee in the kitchen, the soaps in the bathroom, a bottle of wine, and I love that there was a throw blanket to curl up under on the couch. We were out and about most of our stay, but felt comfortable and safe while there. It was also great to have access to a washer and dryer! Normally over a weekend, I don't worry about that, our 2yr old had a mishap at Molly Moons and it was nice to take care of all of the sticky clothing and blanket right away. Thank you! "
227636,13082685,2014-05-19,14055790,Wesley,"Host was awesome This was our first airbnb experience and I did not expect it to be so perfect. They had everything that we could possibly need: lots of shampoo and conditioner to choose from, eggs, coffee and cream in the fridge, a pack and play for our son, a bottle of wine, and even freshly baked cookies! 

Note for parents: There's a walk-in closet that fits the pack and play perfectly."
227636,13306457,2014-05-25,55361,Cheryl,"Spacious, comfortable, private retreat in a great section of Seattle. Michaels place is exactly as pictured. What you can't see is the hospitality in the form of their graciousness, guidebook, baked goods, fresh cut flowers, organic eggs, coffee, cream and toiletries.  This is a private, spacious, comfortable, safe space to stay.  It's a short, easy drive to every where in Seattle and even Tacoma. Ballard and Fremont are funky, fun areas of Seattle. Very close to the Ballard locks and the best coffee in Seattle - ETG coffee and bakery in Fremont. I highly recommend this place "
227636,13512571,2014-05-29,1345708,Aunny & Shawn,"Mike & Jean Louise's space provides you with all the amenities of staying at a hotel or B&B with a personalized twist with fresh flowers, baked cookies and a bottle of wine. The space is comfortable, their backyard environment is lovely, and they take special care to make sure we have everything you need, including basic toiletries, coffee & tea, and plenty of pillows and blankets. We stayed here for a family vacation during Memorial Day week and it was so generous of them to open their personal space to us considering the holiday. Jean Louise also whipped up the most gorgeous floral arrangement in her studio for a last minute gift for a friend who owns a local restaurant. We would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity and would recommend it highly to all of our friends & family visiting Seattle.    "
227636,13743184,2014-06-03,402045,Galia,"Michael and Jean Louise were really nice hosts, and considerate people. They thought of everything, fresh flowers and plants, earplugs, netflix access in their TV. , neighborhood guide. The apartment looks just like the photos. The beds were very comfortable, even the futon that turns into a bed for a third guest was comfortable. We really enjoyed their place, and would definitely recommend it. "
227636,13862578,2014-06-06,9860208,Jacob,"My parents and I stayed in Michael and his wife's apartment for a couple of nights while in Seattle on a business trip.  Michael and Jay Louise were extremely gracious and hospitable hosts, providing us with complimentary coffee, wine, and various other staples, and advice about the area.  Their downstairs apartment is very nice with and comfortable with everything a traveler could ask for.  The neighborhood is very nice and quiet yet close to many attractions, restaurants and bars.  I would definitely recommend staying with the Allens when visiting Seattle."
227636,14035372,2014-06-10,15246590,Andrew,"My wife and I enjoyed our stay of 4 nights in June.  Michael was great at communicating during the rental process and was there to check us in when we arrived.  The apartment was very comfortable and had everything we needed.  We didn't do any cooking, but did use the fridge and washer/dryer which was a big plus.  The bed was very soft and we slept well after long days of walking around.  My wife also took advantage of the jacuzzi tub to relax.

The apartment is really close to the #28 bus to downtown which was convenient.  It's not right in center of Ballard, but we were still able to walk to check out the Sunday farmer's market, shops, restaurants, and the locks.  We definitely liked the Ballard area.

We didn't have any issues with the rental and would definitely stay again!"
227636,14167726,2014-06-13,15689119,June,"We booked this apartment based on location (we wanted to stay outside of downtown, in one of the neighborhoods) and the numerous great reviews.  It lived up to expectations!  The hosts were friendly and knowledgeable, and gave us our privacy.  Minimal noise heard upstairs from their little boy ;)  The apartment itself, was spotless, with all amenities.  As in prior reviews, the bottle of wine and cookies were fantastic.  We had a car and finding parking on-street was easy.  Right between Ballard and Fremont restaurants, cafes, shops, so a great location, although it's not right outside your door.  

If I had to note any drawbacks (since you can already tell from previous reviews that this is overall a great place to stay), it would be that it IS the basement and that it could be updated more (but you can also tell that from all the photos posted). This is all just personal preference.  Other than that, we had a great experience here!  "
227636,14262618,2014-06-16,3260412,Sarah,"Had a very positive experience with Michael and his family.  I reserved his apartment for my family to stay in for my husband's graduation weekend.  The apartment was lovely and it was in a quiet neighborhood in Frelard.  It was spacious, cheerful and well decorated.  Michael baked cookies for my parents prior to their arrival and left a bottle of wine, which was very kind.  My parents were a bit worried about finding street parking, but it was no problem at all.  The shower and jet tub were wonderful amenities to have in the apartment.  The bed and futon with memory foam cover were very comfortable to sleep on.  However, I would like to note that all of the furniture is low to the ground, which can be difficult to get in and out of for taller individuals.  He also put together a nice book of restaurants/places to visit.  Based on those recommendations, we tried two new restaurants in the Ballard area and had delicious meals.  What a cozy place to stay!"
227636,14443293,2014-06-19,15836844,Greta,"Excellent stay with Michael and family! The apartment was just as pictured/described, impeccably clean, with some very thoughtful amenities (fresh baked cookies, lovely sheets/towels, toiletries) that made the visit feel like home. Highly recommended apartment with great hosts in the best part of Seattle.  Thank you for the hospitality!  "
227636,14814152,2014-06-27,13535138,Catherine,"Michael and his family were a pleasure to stay with!  The apartment was exactly as posted and our hosts exceeded our expectations with all the extra amenities.  We were greeted with homemade chocolate chip cookies, and breakfast staples in the fridge along with excellent coffee and wine.      The apt. was very clean and well appointed for our needs.  Michael offered suggestions for dining out and visiting local breweries. We felt very comfortable and thank Michael and his family for sharing their space with us.  
This apt is in a Ballard neighborhood where parking can be a bit of an issue.  There are restaurants and breweries within walking distance.   "
227636,18226860,2014-08-24,13023082,Jason,"Michael and Jean Louise were both awesome---we can't say enough about how great the space was, how accommodating they were, and how much we would recommend their apartment to others. It was obvious that they both went out of their way to make our stay as comfortable as possible. Everything was perfect!"
227636,18553778,2014-08-28,7284479,Kate,"Michael and Jean Louise were very welcoming and helpful, and we had an enjoyable stay in their basement apartment. The neighborhood was perfect for our needs - quiet yet close to restaurants and representative of the Seattle lifestyle. Overall a very comfortable stay."
227636,18789743,2014-09-01,16153407,Tessa,"Michael was a pleasure from the beginning, he was so responsive whenever we had questions and was proactive in letting us know he would be out of town etc.  He made our check-in process easy as can be, and graciously let us check out very late because we had a late night flight, which was so appreciated.  

The apartment itself is large/clean, the amenities were great (full size bath products, plenty of towels etc.), a washer/dryer, wonderful bathtub (whirlpool).  The bed is comfortable too! The apartment was close to some great places and seemed to be no more than 15 minutes from anything else you'd want to see in Seattle.  Would definitely come back. "
227636,19831923,2014-09-19,20268754,Sarah,"Fresh flowers throughout and homemade baked goods upon our arrival made us feel welcome!  This was a great spot, just as advertised.  We love the Ballard and Fremont neighborhoods, so this was the perfect place to stay to be near our favorite stuff.  The neighborhood was great for walking.  The location felt very safe and secure and the family was friendly while allowing us our privacy.  We never had trouble finding parking near the house.  We would definitely go back!"
227636,20084453,2014-09-23,16513072,Jason,"The apartment has all the comforts of home, and a fabulous location. Mike and Jean Louise are very warm and welcoming, and their son and dog are absolutely precious.  Super yummy baked goods were provided at check in!  I would definitely recommend staying here during your time in Seattle! "
227636,20342490,2014-09-28,19450419,Lewis & Cathy Grieshaber,Our stay was great. Mike and jean Louise were very welcoming and gratious. The apartment had everything We needed and more .The muffins were also a nice touch and very delicious. We would definitely book again. Cathy & Lou
227636,20775041,2014-10-05,7297913,Maxine,"Mike and Jean Louise were fantastic hosts. Check in and check out process was easy. They both were always accessible and prompt with communication before and during our stay. Extra special touches include home-baked muffins, a local bottle of wine, and lovely floral arrangements throughout the unit. 
The space itself is just as pictured. The couch turns into a pullout sleeper with memory foam top mattress available to make it very comfortable. The bath tub has jets in it so you can soak after a long day exploring Seattle. 
The location is super convenient. Need something to do? Mike and Jean Louise have prepared a guide book for you to plan your days out!"
227636,21294008,2014-10-14,1252728,Lindsey & Jeremy,We loved our stay here!  It was so close to everything we wanted to do!  Easy to drive and park or hop a bus!  We were greeted with everything for a delicious breakfast that first day and the wine was a lovely treat after we put our little one to bed!  We will definitely be staying here again!
227636,21600908,2014-10-20,21473557,Michael,"All of the reviews of this place, and these folks are spot on!

Everything I wanted, and nothing I didn't want.

Hospitality Perfected.

I have already booked my next stay."
227636,22208931,2014-11-01,22732245,Joanne,"What a warm and welcoming experience!
What a treat to be greeted after a long cross country journey with a plate of home baked cookies and a bottle of wine!
A cozy and clean home with everything I needed for my weeklong stay in Seattle
The hosts have thought of everything a traveler might need and they made my stay so easy
I was in Seattle to help a ill relative and it was so great to come back to this ""Home away from Home""
I will definitely consider staying there again & highly recommend this cozy and comfortable apt.  "
227636,22530268,2014-11-09,20632161,Thea,"What a wonderful home away from home!  Everything was just as described,  communication with our hosts (Michael and Jean-Louise) was ample and smooth. Such an adorable apartment and we felt so welcomed with the nice little special touches (bottle of wine, fresh cut flowers and homemade cookies). Thank you! Looking forward to staying here again in the future!"
227636,22676015,2014-11-11,18349940,Khanh,My stay was above excellent. The location was close to everything I wanted to see in Seattle. The apartment looked spotless and even had cookies and wine waiting for us. I would recommend this place for anyone who wants to walk around and explore Seattle. 
227636,23319434,2014-11-29,4172714,Mathieu,"Very nice place, great neighborhood, very clean, no complain at all. We recommend this place "
227636,23552779,2014-12-04,23639988,Debbie, When we arrived at the air bnb we were surprised by the home made goodies and bottle of wine that the hosts left for us. 
227636,23649669,2014-12-07,6493093,Kerry,"The place is adorable and the hosts were really nice! Loved the wine (even though we didn't drink it, whoops) and cookies. It was great for a weekend but would work out well for a longer stay too."
227636,23901712,2014-12-14,4018685,Jennifer,"Although I never met Michael in person, he was responsive via messages and I felt I could get in touch with him if need be.  The apartment was large as described with some nice touches including muffins, a bottle of wine, and recommendations for walkable neighborhood spots. Much of the toiletries and soaps were available for use.  Since this is a basement apartment, there was noise from upstairs, but minimal.  The photos represent the apartment well, and it was clean, but could be updated a bit (ceiling tiles were noticeably old and carpet had some stains).  
The neighborhood was a mix of houses and businesses, and some abandoned lots. Being new in the city, not knowing much about it, and the progressive vibe the community gave off, I did not feel comfortable walking around by myself at night.  
Overall the apartment met my needs, and I was able to see Seattle from a local's perspective.  Thanks!"
227636,24232340,2014-12-23,23290163,Kércia,"Mike, Jean Louise e Cash foram acolhedores e receptivos. Mike sempre foi imediato em responder as nossas perguntas e muito prestativo. Chegamos em Seattle para estudar e ficamos na casa deles  enquanto procurávamos uma casa para alugar. Antes mesmo de vir, ele tentou nos ajudar nos colocando em contato com uma imobiliária. A casa é exatamente como está nas fotos, muito aconchegante e confortável, e ela estava especialmente decorada com flores e com uma linda árvore de Natal natural. Muito obrigada por tudo! Pelo vinho, pelos deliciosos biscoitos e pelo dia inesquecível de brincadeira que o Gabriel teve com Cash e suas amigas no quintal... Indicaremos com certeza para nossos amigos que vierem a Seattle! "
227636,24709506,2015-01-02,969361,Laura,"Michael and Jean Louise made every effort to make our stay over the holidays a wonderful one.  The apartment was exactly as described, in a good location, with yummy homemade cookies and a great bottle of wine upon arrival.  Plus beautiful little flower arrangements all over the apartment.  Oh, and the bed is very comfy.  We were traveling with a toddler and converted the walk in closet into his ""room"" and it worked perfectly.

We would definitely stay again on a future trip!"
227636,25992003,2015-02-01,23659246,Thomas,Highly recommended
227636,26369621,2015-02-10,22348499,Hanzhe,My family and I had so much enjoyable experience. They are great host and we would love to stay here more later.
227636,26540009,2015-02-15,20272375,Marta,"Such a wonderful place and great hosts. We felt like home which is so rare when you travel. The apartment was cozy, cute, clean and with so many wonderful amenities we really didn't need anything more. It's very conveniently located close to everything you'd want to do in Seattle...highly recommend it and will stay here again.  "
227636,27110750,2015-02-25,27852082,Mark,"Great place. Just as it was listed, actually even better.  Lots of small touches that made the stay exceptional, whole bean coffee, kitchen supplies, comfy bed, soft linens.  A wonderful location between two fun neighborhoods-- great food, microbreweries (Mike even provided an updates list of those in walking distance) farmers market, unique shops. So much better than a hotel, loved the space to stretch and hang out.  The fresh flowers were a lovely touch!"
227636,27290601,2015-03-01,6989007,Wendy,"The listing description was 100% accurate! Michael left us a wonderful list of breweries in the area, an empty growler, and a very helpful booklet of restaurants and things to do around town. There was also a delicious bottle of Pinot Noir and cream cheese-filled chocolate muffins - yum! We were very please with our choice and would stay there again.

"
227636,27673338,2015-03-09,27472372,Anne,"Michael's place was the perfect place to stay. Not only was it clean, quiet and comfortable, but the location can't be beat. The hospitality was off the chart with fresh flowers in the bedroom, freshly baked cookies, and a guide to local breweries in the area sitting on the kitchen table. I'd highly recommend staying here."
227636,33490961,2015-05-29,12022231,Jakob,"My (long-term) stay at Jean Louise's and Micheal's place has been a consistently great experience. They were helpful whenever I needed anything and always made me feel welcome. The apartment itself was very comfortable and conveniently located, highly recommended!"
227636,34566894,2015-06-09,5759503,Michael,"We had a wonderful stay with Michael at his apartment. First of all the location is killer. We are coffee lovers and slate coffee is a handful of blocks away. You are right between ballard and fremont so you've got lots of amazing bars, restaurants and retail within 5-10 minutes drive. The street was quiet. The place is big as described. Full kitchen and well appointed space. Who doesn't love to be greeted by fresh baked chocolate chip cookies!!!! Such a sweet and thoughtful touch. MIchael  was an extremely knowledgeable and friendly host. Warm genuine welcome for us. It's always nice to be greeted that way. You will not hear these guys at night but if you sleep in you will most likely hear them in the morning as the review states. But it's really just like having an apartment above you and hearing people walking. Did not bother us at all. The space is clean and tasteful. It gets plenty of light. Full tub shower - it was great. It was all very private and very welcoming. We would highly recommend staying here. "
227636,34849872,2015-06-13,98785,Yelena,"Both Michale and Jean Louise made everything possible to make us feel welcomed. They went above and beyond in their hospitality efforts.
The place was good choice for a family of 3 people. You'll find everything you need in the kitchen and bathroom. We even had a chance to enjoy their lovely backyard.
The communication with Mike was awesome - very quick and efficient.  "
227636,35453549,2015-06-19,29504703,Kricket,"We found this apartment to be just as was pictured. Very comfortable, quiet and clean.  We were greeted with a bottle of wine and cookies and made ourselves right at home.  The neighborhood was great. Lots of fun places to eat.  Easy access to public transportation (with easy instructions on finding routes left by our host.)  If we find ourselves headed back to Seattle we would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to you family and friends."
227636,36172597,2015-06-26,29889792,Carrie,Michael and Jean were fantastic hosts. They made us feel welcomed and at home. The apartment is better than pictures and in a very nice neighborhood. I would definitely recommend them to anyone and would go back there next time I visit Seattle. 
227636,37129209,2015-07-05,20385692,Sally,"Great apt - in Seattle's heatwave it was lovely to come home to the cool accommodation. Street parking was good. Convenient to everything - such as shops, restaurants and breweries and a bus stop downtown at the end of the street.  The apt was kitted out with everything you could possibly need and Michael was very responsive from the beginning of our enquiries.  Absolutely fit my criteria of clean, comfortable and convenient.  Thanks for the welcoming wine, cookies and flowers. "
227636,38479697,2015-07-16,25383177,Peter,"We Had a wonderful Time in Seattle at Michael' s Place. The Apartment was spacious and well eqipped. The Location and the neighbourhood Ballard is Great. Getting dowtown by Bus is very easy. Michael and his family are very friendly, Helpful and easy-going. "

There was 3 of us. Here are our collective thoughts. So its like 2 reviews in 1…

F - Great host, waiting for us by the door, he gave us a tour of the basement. Explain everything, left us some local amazing ice-cream in the freezer, a list of local restaurants and breweries around. The master bedroom is dark in the mornings so, if light bothers you in the morning this is perfect. Your own washer and drier is handy, everything is super clean. Super quiet house, no noise from the owners upstairs, the street, planes… Perfect place to rest. Quiet, comfortable & chilly. They have a frosted window on the bathroom, some soft discreet light trimming around the house entrance, to make it easier if you are coming late or leaving early. Nice open kitchen, you can tell they spend money to make this comfortable for guest and is not just a basement… Some board games and Netflix available as well.

M - Michael, greeted us upon arrival to give us the tour. He was even gracious enough to surprise us with a locally made Blueberry Ice Cream, that was out of this world. This lovely basement apartment was actually larger than we anticipated. They pretty much thought of everything one might need while away...and they made it available to you. This place was very centrally located to the areas one would come to Seattle to visit. "
227636,40890155,2015-08-03,1564030,Valerie,"We had a great time. The apartment is downstairs in a leafy and lovely residential neighborhood and about a 10-15 min. Walk to Ballard or Fremont, plus an easy bus ride into downtown. We really enjoyed the location, and Mike and Jean Louise were very friendly and helpful when we had any questions. Very comfortable and spotlessly clean place."
227636,41460164,2015-08-07,22383291,Jen,My husband and I loved our 2 night stay in Michael and Jean Louise's home in the Ballard/Fremont neighborhood.  Their place has everything you need to make you feel right at home! We absolutely loved checking out the local area- many amazing local restaurants and breweries.  Very accessible to nearby city attractions. Thanks you two for such a comfortable stay!!
227636,41922518,2015-08-10,13229224,Darren,"Michael and the family were wonderful hosts and I would absolutely recommend their place to anyone. They were very accommodating, as we had a 3.5 year old and a 1 year old travelling with us. They were so kind enough to even provide a pack and play crib and a baby gate for the stairway :) As for the place itself, it was very clean and well kept. All the common amenities you would have at your own home (kitchen, refrigerator, clean bathroom, etc) would be available to you. That is especially a huge plus if you if are travelling with kids or you simply wanted to stay and eat in.  Their place is in a wonderful community within Ballard, as there are many great breweries within walking distance (No need to Taxi or Uber!) , great places to eat around the area and you are only a very short drive to get to Downtown Seattle. The bus line #28 is literally a two minute walk away if you wanted public transportation to get directly to and from Safeco Field or Century Link Park if you are catching a Mariners game, Seahawks game or any event there. This bus line also gets you to Downtown.  We had a blast and you can bet that on our next trip to Seattle, we plan on reaching out again!!"
227636,42835134,2015-08-16,26224935,Leia,"This place is exactly as described, and the location is hard to beat! It is close to several local breweries, and my favourite espresso bar in the region. Our hosts were very gracious and accommodating as well. If I come back to Seattle, I will definitely book this space again. "
227636,43909222,2015-08-23,30857309,Katie,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and everything went perfect. Although we didn’t get to meet Michael, Jean Louise and the family, (Hey, we were on Vacation and there’s so much to do in Seattle!) the place was just as described, and Michael was extremely helpful each time we did speak. We arrived to freshly baked cookies, a bottle of wine, and an empty growler to use, which we thought was a fantastic idea! Though we were too busy to make use of the full kitchen, it was complete with coffee and pretty much everything one might need to make homemade meals. The bedroom had a large closet for hanging up clothes, as well as an iron for those tough wrinkles. The bed was very comfy and relaxing, and as a huge bonus, we were able to make use of the Jacuzzi tub after a full day hiking Mt. Rainier! We took the bus (Route 28 being so close and convenient) or Lyft while we stayed, and the location was easily accessible no matter where we needed to go. All in all, we don’t have anything negative about our visit, and when we return, (there’s still so much to do in Seattle!) we would definitely stay here again!"
227636,45241302,2015-09-01,20233641,Rita,"Michael and Jean Louise's flat is spacious, clean and provides everything one needs to even spend a prolonged time there. The interior is nicely arranged, pictures, flowers and lots of other items make the flat feel cozy. We felt welcome right from the start and truly enjoyed our stay."
227636,46120793,2015-09-08,33513682,Mary Ann,I arrived very late; all the lights were on; very welcoming.  Warm cookies are a delight. Neighborhood is quiet. Very nice place. It has everything you could want. Couldn't have been happier. 
227636,46643989,2015-09-12,21482342,Andrea,"My mom and I had a great time at Michaels place! The hosts were welcoming and friendly, and left homey touches throughout the space. They also have a handy binder with information about the area and tips about the space. It's obvious they put effort into to creating a warm environment for guests. The space is clean, attractive and comfortable and was perfect for our stay. I would highly recommend this place to others!"
227636,47767308,2015-09-21,794819,Erin,"Michael and Jean Louise's apartment is great! It's warm and inviting. When we arrived, there were fresh cookies in the fridge and a bottle of wine waiting for us. Even though there were 3 of us staying there, it was spacious and comfortable. There is a private entrance to the apartment which made it feel like our own. We did manage to meet Jean Louise and their friendly dog Guinness one day and they were both a pleasure to talk to. The location was great for us, very centrally located to everywhere we went.
Wonderful stay, we would recommend it to anyone looking for an AirBnb in Seattle."
227636,49328606,2015-10-03,13562424,Emily,"Very comfortable, little basement apartment with all the amenities you could want. Mike and Jean Louise were very friendly and welcoming, but respected our privacy.  Felt so good to be back in our old neighborhood and within walking distance of all Ballard has to offer."
227636,54047486,2015-11-15,47800647,Kenny,"Our stay was incredible at Michael's house. We especially enjoyed the wine, homemade cookies, and coffee (Seattle really knows their coffee). 

It was very quiet and peaceful, we would recommend to anyone!"
227636,54264215,2015-11-17,35172728,Nikita,"Michael's place was exactly as described, very clean and with all of the comforts of home. Fresh organic cookie dough, wine, and a log in the fireplace awaited us. 
Michael was very accommodating with our late arrival time and early departure."
227636,54802928,2015-11-23,25656872,Jen,"This space was exactly as listed. The pictures absolutely do it justice...plus it has a whir pool bath! Very cozy, homey and soundproof. In a beautiful part of Seattle between the neighborhoods of Ballard and Fremont, easy access to everything. Wifi excellent, tv excellent, bed super-soft and warm colors all around. Michael met us, gave us a bottle of wine and there were three organic chocolate chip cookie dough patties waiting in the fridge. Really...what a great stay!"
227636,55103853,2015-11-28,23269888,Janet,"Michael is a accomodating host.  The apartment was clean, as described, with room enough for the three of us.  Thoughtful touches included coffee beans w/grinder, cookies dough in the fridge - ready to be baked, a jacuzzi, and a extra foam pad for the living room futon.  Our host was very responsive on any questions.   "
227636,57081985,2015-12-21,12285229,Colin,Michael's place's located in a cute/quite neighborhood. The apartment is very clean and thoughtfully decorated. Really enjoyed the jacuzzi tub and the fire place. Michael was very good with commutation and we came there to some delicious homemade cookies. Will definitely recommend this place to anyone. 
227636,57798474,2015-12-29,41698818,Jingwei,"gonna miss the room in Seattle, which is nice and comfortable. Mike is the best host."
8174626,46340494,2015-09-09,22656316,Rick,"Morteza was a great host.  He was easy to contract and always responded within 10 min to my text.  His place was VERY clean and welcoming.  He is located 1.5 blocks north of the U DUB entrance, so a great location if you there for the university.  His place is located in the heart of university life, which was never an issue and made it easy to access places around the city.  I would definitely stay there again and would recommend it to everyone !!!!

Rick"
8174626,50906630,2015-10-15,46413042,Jennifer,"Morteza was GREAT!! The place was clean, convenient and frankly, cuter than we  had hoped it would be. Morteza worked really hard with me to work out my technical problems as I am challenged that way and this was my first Air BNB experience. He was so patient with all my questions. I was more than pleased. The studio was equipped with all that was promised plus some really appreciated extras like complimentary waters in fridge, wine, and detergent for the laundry should we want to do a load of wash. GREAT HOST! EXCELLENT LOCATION. What more can a traveler ask. :-)"
8174626,52152405,2015-10-26,17738738,Sian,"Morteza was a great host, we never met him but he checked in on us to make sure everything was alright. He provided complimentary wine which was very thoughtful and appreciated. The place was very clean and comfortable. It is located right in the university district so the only negative would be that the streets and alleys have quite a bit of trash around, but the neighbours were not rowdy and there wasn't too much noise (and we were there on a weekend!). Overall a great place to stay, especially if you are in university."
8174626,52545396,2015-10-30,5775807,David,Awesome host. Great location particularly if you have business near the University or students in the University. You're also somewhat close to fraternities and sororities so you can check up on your kids. Very clean and spacious apartment. Dedicated parking space which is nice. Great price particularly if you have an extended stay. Gas range stove and washer dryer. I would go back
8174626,53091842,2015-11-04,10159719,Derrick,"We loved our stay! Very close to lots of great entertainment / restaurants. The studio was well-stocked, clean, private, and comfortable. I would recommend to anyone wishing to visit!"
8174626,53307202,2015-11-07,47663618,Nicole,Morteza was very quick to communicate with us and was a pleasant host. We booked this very last minute and the check in and out processes could not have been smoother. 
8174626,53629483,2015-11-10,46262057,Dane,We had a great time! Morteza was a great host. He checked on us and made sure we were comfortable. 
8174626,54050741,2015-11-15,48086235,Jennifer,"I had a wonderful experience! Morteza periodically checked in to make sure that all was going smoothly, the apartment was clean, and it was very pleasant to wind down after an eventful day with the complimentary sangria. Location is close to UW and quite convenient; would stay again. "
8174626,54201318,2015-11-16,48376152,Amanda,Super kind host. I ended up losing an earring down the sink and he was kind enough to offer to retrieve it before we left town. Very clean place. Comfortable. Located near Greek row and close to campus. Recommend for anyone needing to stay in the area. 
8174626,54401102,2015-11-19,48415233,Dustin,"Great place! Convenient, very comfortable, and clean."
8174626,54676154,2015-11-22,44632388,Chelsea,"The place was very quaint and welcoming. I would stay here again! 
The kitchen was stocked with all utensils and the washer/dryer was a plus! 

The bed was okay. "
8174626,55240963,2015-11-29,47940973,Stacy,"Morteza is a super host!  It is my first experience ever on Airbnb and I'm so happy that she is my host. Everything is nice, she even got wine and coffee there for me. Definitely recommended!"
8174626,56120569,2015-12-09,46297190,Lindsey,"Morteza's property is in a prime location; coffee, food, and bars are all within walking distance. The freeways and various other neighborhoods are also within a 5 minute drive, and if you're up for a walk on s nice day, I recommend walking to the Space Needle from the apartment! It took about an hour and a half, but the view along the Eastlake Ave bridge are lovely and Lake Uniom neighborhoods are s treat to walk through. 
  The property itself had everything we needed, and Morteza even left a bottle of Sangria for us to enjoy on our 5 day stay, as well as coffee. It was also great to have our own parking spot in such a crowded university neighborhood :-) Would stay again!"
8174626,56600631,2015-12-15,32545946,Lua,"Morteza was very easily to reach and welcoming. Place is as described and clean. He had wine, coffee, tea, water for us. There is a reserved parking space which is key for this neighborhood. Overall great stay and would stay again!! "
1043194,6507189,2013-08-15,6252835,Christy,"Grace, the owner, was incredibly accomodating. She gave me a great list of local places to visit and always responded to my inquiries, however small, quickly. The unit was incredibly clean, very well-stocked, and comfortable. I stayed for 31 days and could not imagine better accomodations. Highly recommended!"
1043194,7032456,2013-09-04,5803478,Paul,"This room was perfect for the needs of my group.  A short walk to the convention center and there's even an alternate stair case you can use to get around traffic and avoid all the crowd in the front entrance.

The kitchen was nice to cook breakfast and save some money for all the great restaurants and bars further up Pike.

There's even a small deli/market around the corner up Pike st in case you need to do some shopping.

Grace was an excellent host answering any questions that I had.

Will call again should I decide for a return trip. 

"
1043194,7757449,2013-10-01,8905372,Mark,"Great apartment!! We had an awesome time. Apartment is very clean and comfortable with a fantastic location. Grace is very friendly and made the whole experience very pleasant. Parking was easy and convenient, but is an extra $20/night. Would definitely stay here again!!"
1043194,8071494,2013-10-14,5405224,John,"Grace was very friendly and accommodating. She met us at the door and gave us a very warm greeting and a tour of the apartment and the building. The location was great, right next door to the convention center and the apartment was roomy and comfortable. Grace also accommodated a later departure time for us - much appreciated."
1043194,9768943,2014-01-08,9853716,Lillian,The reservation was canceled 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1043194,10981792,2014-03-16,12034853,Stephen,"The condo was nice, clean, and right close to everything. I was in town for a convention next door at the convention center and it was so nice to be able to walk 5 minutes and be there! Communication was excellent. I'll definitely stay here the next time I'm in Seattle."
1043194,13219074,2014-05-22,751736,Susie,"Apartment is comfortable, clean, and in a great location. Grace was also very responsive and accommodating. I stayed here for 3 weeks for work and I'd definitely recommend it to other travelers! "
1043194,14674377,2014-06-23,4595379,Annie,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1043194,15063360,2014-07-01,6779270,James,"My wife and I had a great experience with Grace. She was wonderful, very helpful, and responsive to any questions we had. The apartment was right downtown and within walking distance to the train that takes you to and from the airport. It was also close to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle was within walking distance. The bed was on the firm side, which was good for me but my wife likes the softer mattress. The couch was also comfortable to sleep on as well. Would stay again if we come back to Seattle."
1043194,16266229,2014-07-24,17132740,Kathleen,"Great apartment! We got in early and Grace was very accommodating with the early check in.  The bed was comfortable with very nice fluffy pillows.  There's a window unit air conditioner in the living room which was very helpful because it was pretty warm the days we were there.  There was also a fan in the bedroom. 
It's about a half mile to Pike Place Market and about a mile and a half to the Space Needle.  The kitchen looked like it had the essentials if you wanted to buy dinner to cook from Pike Place, but we stuck to the restaurants. There are several nearby, and happy hour is definitely the time to go. "
1043194,16889986,2014-08-04,14908591,Brian,"The experience with the host (Grace) was superb. To say that she was merely ""professional"" about our stay would be unfair. In terms of our agreement, Grace was very professional about everything to a T, but also made my wife and I feel that we were her more than paying customers, but her personal guests. 

The listing was exactly as we had hoped for - clean and inviting, lots of natural light (being on the second from the highest floor in the building) and safe. The location was too perfect - a block up from the downtown area, a short downhill walk to Pike Place Market and the rest of the waterfront (where we spent a lot of time), but also even closer to some really great local spots in the Capitol Hill area. While we had expected the ease of enjoying Pike Place Market while staying here, we didn't realize we would be even closer to the rich food scene in Capitol Hill, which ended up being a huge plus for us as we ended up spending a fair amount of our trip in the area. I know that people staying for conferences at the nearby Convention Center have enjoyed this listing, I just want to make it known that this place is in a really central location to most of the major must-sees in Seattle including the Columbia Center's Skyview Observatory, Pike Place Market, the Waterfront, Capitol Hill - all walking distance. If you want to get out to the space needle, the monorail downtown will take you straight there and that's a mere 2 blocks away. 

As for the unit itself, it was nice and clean and we felt very comfortable our entire trip. Clean bedding, towels - pretty much everything you'd expect from a hotel with the comforts of one's own home. Though we didn't use it, the kitchen is fully stocked with pots and pans and plateware and cups - anything you'd need to make yourself at home on days you don't feel like dining out. Though most of the construction in Seattle is without built-in air conditioning, this unit came with a stand-alone AC unit in the living room area which was crucial for cooling off from the otherwise gorgeous summer-time weather.

Overall a great experience, and we'll definitely be looking to return!"
1043194,18495143,2014-08-27,16187247,Nayeli,Rachel was an amazing host. Our flight was delayed and our arrival was after midnight. We updated her and gave her a call when we landed and she guided us to the apt. The apt was beautiful and very clean! The location was perfect. We walked for breakfast everyday to the pike market area. A few minutes north was a really cool area too with bars and restaurants. We will definitely be staying here if we are back in Seattle!
1043194,20140507,2014-09-24,17086449,Rob,Rachel and Grace's place was the ultimate place to stay in Seattle. It was up the road from the  Pike Place Markets making it easy to get around to all local places. The place was beautifully clean and had all the amenities required for an easy stay. Thanks Rachel and Grace for making our time in Seattle a wonderful experience.Kind regards the Hutchinson family
1043194,20613078,2014-10-02,2537028,Jeremy,"Everything was great! Grace was very helpful. Such a perfect basecamp for me with a conference at the Washington Convention Center, and for my wife to explore all the highlights of downtown Seattle. "
1043194,21304122,2014-10-14,2140879,Eric,"The apartment was exactly as described, immaculately clean, with a very comfortable bed in a great location.  It was actually in the perfect place to allow us to split our time between the ultra-hip Capitol Hill neighborhood and downtown (which was our real destination).

Although we did not meet Rachel and Grace in person, their communications with us were always very prompt, clear and friendly.

One notable downside to being anywhere in this neighborhood is that you are within earshot of interstate 5, which can be pretty noisy during the day.  This was, in my and my wife's opinion, a very much a worthy price to pay for being in such a convenient location.

I would definitely consider staying here again."
1043194,22083469,2014-10-29,22442381,Joseph,"The listing was accurate and Rachel & Grace did all we required to make us comfortable.  We had good communication for getting settled in.  The bed was very comfortable and the shower was absolutely wonderful.  The location was perfect with a great skyline view from each window.  A short walk to Pike Market and just about anywhere in downtown.  If you want the convention center, you could not stay in a better location.  We enjoyed our first weekend stay so much that we requested to come back the next weekend after walking to Lake Union and taking a seaplane to San Juan Island."
1043194,28774297,2015-03-30,11726844,Ashlie,"This is the second time I've used Grace's condo, and the second excellent experience. Clean, stocked with helpful items such as shampoo, and very close to our venue! I'll keep coming every year as long as I'm welcome. Thank you for the wonderful accommodations!"
1043194,30384336,2015-04-21,27697535,Stacey,A great place to stay thanks.  I was able to attend a conference at the convention centre while my family explored Seattle.  The apartment was close to everything and had everything we needed for a family of 4.  Hosts were wonderful and welcoming and Seattle put on beautiful weather for us so how can we not come back?!
1043194,34431593,2015-06-08,19903585,Kristin,I recently stayed here for a conference I was attending at the convention center.  It couldn't have been more convenient!  Only a short walk to the convention center as well as all the downtown Seattle attractions. The apartment was very clean and quiet and Grace was a great host. I would definitely stay here again.
1043194,43503330,2015-08-20,36649241,Jennifer,"Had a great time in Seattle. Grace was helpful sending us a list of things to do. Location was excellent. The only small issue we had was it was tough to get ahold of Grace at one point during our stay. Lovely home, if in Seattle, we will be back. "
1043194,45235907,2015-09-01,28694594,Brandon,"The description and pictures were accurate, location was prime for what we wanted. She met us the day of to deliver a second set of keys and was very nice through out the process. "
2217257,12670230,2014-05-07,14477414,Saket,I Stayed at Sean's place when I was moving to Seattle and I needed a place to crash for my initial days. Sean has a great house in a great locality with everything that I needed for me to settle in Seattle. And Sean was too generous to offer me 2 extra days of stay without any extra charge. Which was an icing over the cake.
2217257,13147638,2014-05-20,9813574,Samantha,"My husband and I were visiting Seattle for 5 days and wanted to stay in Capitol Hill. We couldn't have picked a better place to call home for those 5 days. Sean's home was exactly as pictured- clean, bright and full of character! He provided us with info on how to get to his place from the airport and how much each mode of transportation was.  The location was close to many shops, restaurants, bus lines etc. We also loved being able to walk downtown/ to the waterfront within 20-25 minutes. It was nice to come back to a ""home away from home"" rather than some hotel that surely wouldn't have had as many amenities as Sean provided. We would absolutely book a stay with him again. "
2217257,13423677,2014-05-27,11997910,George,"Sean's place was clean and beautiful. Sean was hospitable, friendly, and prompt to respond! I would not hesitate returning back the next time I visit Seattle! "
2217257,13925990,2014-06-08,6986853,Jill,"I had an unusual situation where I was booking Sean's place for my boss. Sean was kind enough to be open to this and work through any kinks. Sean's place was wonderful! Centrally located, clean and beautiful! "
2217257,15586579,2014-07-12,16616145,Karen,"Sean was there to greet me and make me feel very welcome. He was very responsive when I had a question that first evening. His place is spacious and intriguing, very well suited to cooking, which I did not do. The bed was comfy and the neighborhood great. Plenty of places to walk to, including a little grocery next door, restaurants, coffee, etc. I had a great stay and would definitely try to stay there again."
2217257,16208581,2014-07-23,6038812,Sebastian&Christoph,"Sean's apartment is spacious, magnificently furnished and has a very interesting vibe. It's located in a very quiet street on Capitol Hill with some basic catering facilities just nearby and the whole range of dining and entertainment options within 20 minutes walking distance. Communication with Sean was totally easy and he always replied right away. If you are into a stylish place and also like to have a glimpse on somebody's ideosyncratic concept of ""home"", this is the place to go in Seattle. "
2217257,18546831,2014-08-28,15665579,Richard,"Great apartment in a fantastic spot. Sean was kind enough to accept our booking even though it was for company use, eg a couple of us were using it whilst travelling for work. 
Seattle is pretty easy to navigate anyway but the great location made it even simpler.
Sean was there for an easy check in and very responsive if we needed him.
Definitely recommended."
2217257,19221060,2014-09-08,10606382,Greer,"The apartment was very comfortable, eclectic and in a great location. We were able to walk to a ton of great places to eat, drink, and be merry, and when we came back to the apartment in the evening it felt like we were really ""living"" in Seattle not just ""staying"" in Seattle.

Sean was a great host -- super responsive which was helpful especially when we were coordinating the ""check in."" 

The apartment just had a really cool vibe and was a perfect place from which to explore Seattle. I would definitely stay here again!"
2217257,19833575,2014-09-19,20344733,Larry,"I travel extensively, but this was my first AirBnB experience.  Overall, I enjoyed my 10-night stay at the Casbah, though there were some aspect that detracted from overall value.  

The biggest pro is that it's quiet.  The apartment is on the backside of the building, so there is no bordering street noise. The neighboring apartments have quiet residents; over the full 10 nights, I never heard any annoying late-night TV/radio, or early morning clamoring.  

The apartment is well situated - just 4 blocks from the restaurants and shops of Broadway, and a short walk to downtown or other parts of Capitol Hill.  Within one block are a couple of bars/taverns, donut shop, and a convenience store. 

It's clean (with noted exceptions) and well stocked with toiletries. The bed has a firm mattress, quality linens, and is very comfortable.  Hardwood floors throughout (except porcelain tile bathroom and linoleum kitchen floors), with nice area rugs.  Kitchen & dining room are well equipped, including food processor, blenders, French press, cutting boards, cookware, utensils, and more. The furnishings and art are eclectic; not my taste, but it didn't influence my review either way. 

As others noted, Sean was extremely responsive. I had several questions for him both prior to, and after committing to rent, and in all cases, he got back to me immediately.  I had a late scheduled arrival, and late departure, which were easily accommodated.  

On the flip slide, there are some shabby aspects which, for me, made it worth less than $200+/night, relative to some of Seattle's more modestly-priced boutique hotels.  First impression walking into to the building (not the apartment itself) is poor - the carpets in the lobby, hallways, and stairs look like they haven't been cleaned in 20 years. On several occasions, the neighbor across the hall had placed small bags of garbage outside their door (including doggie poop bags).

The apartment itself, despite attention to furnishing & decoration, really needs some touching up.  There are numerous unpatched and unpainted anchor, screw, and nail holes, particularly in the bathroom.  There are vestigial nails/brads sticking out in several walls - some of which caught me as I fumbled in the dark for light switches.  The bathroom has old, cracked, and badly stained porcelain fixtures.  The windows, particularly those in the bedroom and kitchen, are hideously dirty.  The kitchen sink is missing an aerator, so the water stream, even when low, splashes like crazy, and makes cleaning up the dishes an adventure (don't wear good clothes).  The shower loses quite a bit of water pressure when the knob is turned to hot.  The bathroom sink is one of those ancient 2-spigot types.  And the lighting at the dining room table (the only practical place to work) is poor during non-daylight hours.  

So, all-in-all, it was a pleasant stay, and I slept well, but I longed for a better workspace, friendlier plumbing, a fewer distracting elements."
2217257,21234497,2014-10-13,4916570,Emily,"A great place, location, and host! Sean was very responsive and helpful before and throughout the booking. My situation was unique in that I already live here in Seattle but was looking for a bigger place for my parents and sister to stay while visiting. The Casbah ended up being a perfect home away from home where we could all relax, cook, play games and chat until the wee hours of the night. The place is definitely quiet and cozy. We all enjoyed the beautiful world-travelled vibes and couldn't stop staring at the walls. My dad was able to take advantage of the kitchen in which he chopped up some fresh poke for us with tuna from the market! Not something that can be done easily in hotel rooms. We all had a great stay and I was particularly pleased with the Top Pot Donut being just across the street for quick morning coffee and treats."
2217257,22681721,2014-11-11,23338202,Nissa,"What a perfect location. The Casbah immediately made me feel at home. The linens and towels were so fresh, and the extras were fabulous (blankets, pillows, tea, etc.)

It was a very quiet oasis close to Broadway and everywhere I needed to be. 
Thanks to Sean, I had a wonderful stay."
2217257,25602008,2015-01-20,4169400,Traci,"We loved our 4 night stay at the Casbah. This is a great space with interesting & unique artwork. I haven't met Sean personally but I feel that his personality is reflected in the decor of this home. While it does feature antiques it projects a really fun vibe. The sleeping spaces are very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you'd need to cook a gourmet meal. 

The people we met around Capitol Hill were great & super helpful. The Casbah is very well equipped but anything extra you need is available at the little store on the corner of the block. There are some fun bars & restaurants just past the store. We all felt safe walking downtown daily to the ferry or Pike's Place Mkt. We walked a total of 31 miles during the 3 day see explored Seattle. This is a great city, a safe & walkable neighborhood (though we were told to be cautious at 2am if we were out that late) & a really fantastic apartment to call home during your visit. We highly recommend it! Sean is very good with communication & responds promptly. Make this your Seattle home away from home."
2217257,26102127,2015-02-03,12126861,Mark,"If you're looking for a stylish, clean, quiet, and safe retreat just a short walk away from the heart of Capitol Hill, look no further than the Casbah.

The apartment is just as pictured here- full of fun and interesting furnishings and art and brimming with Sean's unique decorating flair.

It's true that the hallways are a bit dirty from leaves that have trickled in from outside but I don't spend much time hanging out in hallways on my vacation so that wasn't an issue for me.

In addition to providing a great place to stay in a great location, Sean personally ensured a smooth visit. Even though he said he would not be able to be there to personally greet us, that was not a problem at all because he arranged for a friend to meet us at the exact time we wanted to arrive. 

We also thought we had locked ourselves out of the apartment one morning and Sean was quick to reply with a helpful hint- turn the key to the left! Sorry about that Sean, we were not feeling or operating at 100% until later that day.

For those that appreciate an adult beverage, Summit Public House is less than a block away and has some pretty good beer on tap. Sun Liquor, which is right next door, makes some killer cocktails. 

There is a convenience store on the same block as the Casbah called Summit Foods Mart for your basic food and beverage needs. 

The QFC a few blocks away on Republican and Harvard (this is the back entrance) has a good selection of food and one of the best beer selections I have seen in any grocery store ever.

Needless to say, the next time we are back in Seattle we know where to stay. Thanks Sean!

2217257,26382110,2015-02-10,5655762,Chase,"My experience at the Casbah was more than fabulous. From the elegant decor to the convenient location, Sean's home was perfect for my visit to Seattle. His home reflects his quirky and refined personality in such a positive way. I would love to have the pleasure of staying here in the future.
Thank you!!"
2217257,26677432,2015-02-17,1645195,Elizabeth,"The Casbah had all the expected Airbnb touches.  Well written instructions, someone to let us in and then left us alone the entire stay.  There were drawers and a closet to put our stuff.  A comfortable bed with good sheets.  Plenty of extra blankets and sheets for an extra sleep space.  A good kitchen and living space with many artistic touches.  The location worked for my business conference.  "
2217257,28575160,2015-03-26,25013829,Jubing,"Excellent! The descriptions are definitely what the Casbah is and we love it much more! Really cozy and cool place. Sean is responsive to our problems and questions.
The apartment has a great location, close to stores, restraunts, and bus stops. Towels and other bath essentials were provided, as well as a kitchen readily available for cooking. Overall, a cool place to stay :)
"
2217257,28810258,2015-03-30,22309098,Brian,"Sean met us at the door and was welcoming!  He walked us through the apartment and gave us the rundown.  The apartment was great!  Perfect location.  Perfect accommodations.  It was a great launching (and landing) pad for our Seattle experience.

"
2217257,29188495,2015-04-05,17940002,Stacy,My boyfriend and I stayed at Sean's apartment which is a beautiful artistic space in a perfect location.  The apartment was exactly as shown in the pictures and I loved sitting on the sofa in the afternoon sun.  Sean was a generous host entrusting us with his personal momentos all around the apartment.  There was extra bedding available to house more than two comfortably.  Right next door there is a convenient market and down the street neighborhood bars and coffee shops that we loved.  
2217257,33102607,2015-05-25,30567216,William,"Sean was great and kept in contact leading up to the trip. We met at the airport, quickly going over the rules of engagement and off I went.

This was my first time in Seattle, and the location was good. There was a lot of walking involved, but nothing I was already expecting. On a few occasions I called car ride service, which will set you back ~$8-12.

The Casbah itself is very charming, reflective of the owner I'm sure. The building is really old though, so if creaks and quiet(er) time at 10ish bothers you, I wouldn't suggest this place. For myself though, I needed something relaxing and quiet. Couldn't ask for anything more from the Casbah."
2217257,34224871,2015-06-06,23955132,Kennan,"Although Sean was out of town during our  stay, he was very prompt responding to our messages and organized everything well.  He arranged for another gentlemen to meet us on our arrival who gave us the keys and showed us around - the apartment is exactly as described and very well kept.  The neighborhood was excellent and we had a great time during our stay, couldn't have asked for more."
2217257,40148236,2015-07-28,12590738,Amy,Sean was a great host - he was flexible with the key drop off when our flight was late. His place is in a great location and has everything you need for an enjoyable trip to Seattle. I would recommend his place to my friends. 
2217257,41247936,2015-08-05,38468302,Zara,"Sean's apartment was lovely, a very cool place to stay in a very cool city. Had everything we needed for our short stay and was in a fantastic location. "
2217257,45291307,2015-09-01,6743008,Brett,"Sean's place was roomier than expected and very artfully decorated. Great location in the heart of Capitol Hill, very close proximity to major attractions (Space Needle is 10 mins away). Sean was very prompt in responding to emails and texts and gave very detailed notes on getting access to the apartment once we got to Seattle. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking to visit."
2217257,46294400,2015-09-09,8825543,Jazmin,"I absolutely loved staying at the Casbah. It was lovely to come ""home"" after a day exploring Seattle instead of going back to a hotel. What I loved about this place even more so was that the style reflected my own personal style. The decor is eclectic, charming and very comforting. Sean supplied everything that we could possibly need. The location is also wonderful. We utilized both the light rail and the bus followed by a short walk to get to the apartment from the airport. This saved us about $40 on a taxi. The bus stop was about three blocks away but we ended up just walking everywhere. We found that we could get downtown in about 20-30 minutes. Also a few blocks away on Broadway St. (?) there are plenty of (website hidden) shops/grocery/etc. Definitely check out Taco Chuki's for some of the best tacos you will ever have. Americana also has a pretty good brunch. I would definitely recommend this apartment and would love to stay again. "
2217257,48689428,2015-09-28,10262008,Kim,"Sean was a great host to us. He was flexible with our check-in time since we were flying in late. The space itself is awesome! It has all the amenities we needed and it's walking distance to a few coffee spots, bars, restaurants and shopping. Communication was a breeze with Sean; I truly wish we could have stayed longer!

Thanks for everything!"
2217257,49800238,2015-10-06,41471924,Melissa,"Sean's apartment was the perfect place to come back to after long days of exploring the city. I felt well-rested and well-accommodated, and am so glad I was able to stay there for my time in Seattle. The house was well-stocked and vibrantly decorated, and so close to Broadway, Pike and Pine. Overall I had an excellent time and would strongly recommend staying at the Casbah!"
2217257,51399692,2015-10-19,39486746,Geoff,"Great place, excellent location. "
7800143,42633672,2015-08-14,41120188,Leonda,"We were simply desperate to find a place for three nights to sleep our entire family.   Our host was so prompt at returning her emails and we were able to secure a reservation in a short period of time.  She was so welcoming and friendly, and made us feel right at home immediately.  
The cupboards and drawers were filled with everything we could possibly need and the beds were comfortable and versatile for our whole family.  The neighborhood was very west Seattle and we were so comfortable with the setting,  even a very friendly outdoor cat that would inspire us to peek under the bushes to see her snoozing in the shade.  Bathrooms were nice, everything was very clean, and a sweet little garden area on the side of the house for sitting outside was a plus.  The location was so easy to get to and from the downtown area or onto the west Seattle bridge to Seattle.  We will definitely use it again."
7800143,42791722,2015-08-15,39774469,Kathy,"We loved staying at Belvidere house! The hood is perfectly close to great groceries and pubs and nice views. We were only 15 to 20 minutes from CenturyLink for hawks game. Liked sharing the house with Nana the outdoor kitty, she was very friendly and lovable. Our host was very helpful on house needs and this lovely home full of everything we needed. Plenty of space, lots of amenities, fast WiFi, clean beds and baths. Backyard is small but very nicely decorated with couch and a small fire pit, (when fires are allowed) and is fairly private with all of the foliage. We had a great time here and are already looking forward to a longer stay next time. Thanks!"
7800143,43711334,2015-08-21,8814674,Gnep,"A very nice house, with a lovely but mewing cat"
7800143,44047861,2015-08-23,28996401,Tracey,"This home was perfect for our family and very comfortable.  The home was stocked with all the necessary cooking supplies to cook meals for our family, a great selection of movies and games. The neighborhood was quiet and neighbors seemed very friendly.  Many places to eat near by and a great little pub and Italian restaurant 6 blocks up from the home. After exploring Alki Beach for the day, we took the water taxi from Alki beach to the Mariners game which took about 10 minutes. It was a great way to go. Kelly was a wonderful host, we will definitely be back! I would recommend this home."
7800143,44980966,2015-08-30,41175641,Erika,"We had an awesome stay at Kelly's place!!!! She made us feel very welcome at her place, the descriptions were very accurate and the neighbourhood is really beautiful! The arrival was very easy because we used a GPS to get there, but still it is not hard to get there. Her place is really comfortable, lots of space and everything that you need for your stay. Kelly left some special details for our daughters, like snacks and cups for them. She was very attentive to any message that we sent her before, during and after our stay. Her place has a very calm vibe that makes you feel really at home. The beach and the water taxi station they are close to her place but they imply quite a long uphill walk, so we suggest going by car if possible.
 My girls didn't want to leave, so you can tell we already look forward for a chance to go back!!! "
7800143,46195303,2015-09-08,16549592,Karen,"The house is spacious, centrally located, and stocked with everything you might need. Kelly is extremely nice and accommodating to our large group. 

Our entire group (including many that never used airbnb before) really enjoyed our stay. 
"
7800143,46980170,2015-09-14,43026356,Tyler,"This house was perfect for my crew's trip to Seattle and Kelly was extremely accommodating. Easy to find, clean, and stocked with some extra goodies. I would definitely rent here again."
7800143,48737246,2015-09-28,17175007,Sharon,"Initially I was prepared for a common house rental but was pleasantly warmed and able to relax into ""Kelly's"" house. Kelly went out of her way to accomodate our 2 1/2 yo. traveler. (All of us, really)The condiments, cooking materials and kitchen were like stepping into your sister's kitchen, ...a little orientation and wala! Dinner! Our needs were met and our trip was improved by staying in the Belvedere House."
7800143,54761297,2015-11-23,48014687,George,"The house was wonderful! It was perfectly located within 15 minutes of SEATAC,  10 min of dwntwn Seattle and Western Seattle has a bunch of great eateries and shops. The house was clean, fresh and we slept great! I highly recommend Kelly and her home to anyone considering a stay in Seattle. The whole transaction was absolutely seamless. When I return next year, this will be the first house I check avail. for our stay! "

Walking distance to all the favorite downtown Seattle spots with a variety of restaurants and bars to indulge.  Parking is a plus but with this prime location, no car is needed.  Most of all, this place was super clean inside and out.  Definitely will visit again!"
4151430,34720935,2015-06-11,2092612,Jonathan,"Great apartment in a brilliant location surrounded by cool bars and restaurants and waking distance from everywhere you will need to go to. The gym and pool are super handy. If you are a runner, head down to the waterfront and head north to the park. Hosts were helpful although the additional forms and info we had to fill out was a little annoying but small complaint"
4151430,37505002,2015-07-07,35956274,Diane,"Our host was excellent.  Very responsive and easy to deal with, met us exactly when promised, very pleasant, courteous, and helpful.  

The apartment was also very nice:  spotless and very comfortable for a family of two parents and two teenagers, in an attractive and very well-located building with three sets of keys and very convenient parking in the building.  

The listing was as expected with one caveat:  the air conditioning does not suffice for the entire apartment, because there is effectively only one working air conditioning unit and it cannot cool the entire apartment.  (There are two air conditioning units in the apartment, but as our host warned us at check-in, if you run both simultaneously, you blow a fuse.)  The lack of air conditioning is usually not a problem in Seattle, but we happened to be there during a heat wave and air conditioning was necessary.   We really liked the apartment otherwise.  "
4151430,46124746,2015-09-08,35038719,Samantha,"This was a perfect location to Bumbershoot 2015. I loved the Belltown area, there were plenty of restaurants and markets nearby as well as the waterfront and museums. The place was very clean and had a great amount of towels, blankets And pillows for our group of 6. I would recommend keeping the windows closed at night as the street can get a little noisy in the weekends. Overall very nice and perfect temporary home. "
2191169,10050577,2014-01-27,11377188,Gregor,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we were extremely pleased  as to how great it was. All the communication with Jordan was very easy and he was very responsive.

The apartment was incredibly located and well stocked. It really is steps from Pike Place and the piers. We had a view over the bay and enjoyed the incredible sunsets.

I would recommend this experience and look forward to our  next trip to Seattle."
2191169,12273420,2014-04-28,2905444,Bob,Spectacular location. Well appointed apartment. Nice building amenities. Within walking distance of the best if downtown Seattle. Hopefully I'll be back to stay again. 
2191169,17418888,2014-08-11,12591421,Lara,"Thanks for an awesome experience! It was like having our own apartment downtown, we could not have had such a uniquely Seattle weekend with our friends from Louisville without you guys. We bought breakfast makings at the U Market and fresh meat and cheese at Pike's Place, stayed out late Sat and had a chill homemade brunch Sun am. I only wish we'd had time to stay longer :) Truly awesome space, great price. Thank you so much!"
2191169,23829864,2014-12-11,23198132,Keith,"We loved the place! Amazing location. Friendly host,  great accommodations.  So easy to see everything we want and the same view as the four seasons hotel directly next door!  Very cool!!!

"
2191169,25279354,2015-01-11,5670552,Margot,"We had a great experience here! The location is right downtown and easily accessible by public transit. The apartment is clean and very comfortable for 5 people. The complex felt safe, and is conveniently located by the piers and down the street from Pike Street Market. Overall, it was a great alternative to staying at a hotel. "

The rooms and bathrooms were both very spacious and you could easily reserve the place for 6 folks with the rollaway bed and couch. The beds were comfortable (not spa-quality) and the sauna/hot tub were so lovely. If you are staying in the colder months and want access to the sauna, be aware that you will have to walk about 5 minutes to another building- which requires going outside. This wasn't a deterrent for us though.

This space was within walking distance of Pike Place Market, Seattle Art Museum, the Show Box, and a short taxi cab from anything downtown. It was amazing! We paid the parking fee for the listing and took cabs everywhere to avoid having to find parking during the busy, Seattle weekend."
2191169,26293141,2015-02-09,5814571,Matthew,"The apartment was clean & well-equipped (except we didn't find a hair dryer), had at least a peek of the waterfront, and was very quiet.  We really enjoyed being so close to Pike Place Market that we could easily wander over to the shops & stands for meals & purchases, and we were close to everything else in downtown Seattle.  The University Ave. light rail stop is just two blocks uphill, so access from the airport is a breeze even without a rental car or taxi, and many bus routes are nearby.  For two couples, this worked out to be an economical stay in a great location."
2191169,26877062,2015-02-21,26881235,Charlene,"This was a fantastic place to be while visiting Seattle! The apartment was spacious, clean, and had everything you needed to feel like you are at home away from home. You really can't beat the location. It is walking distance to Pike's Place, the Big Wheel, Seattle Aquarium, Seattle Art Museum, and 3 or so blocks away from a beautiful shopping mall. From the mall, you can take the monorail (cheap) straight to Seattle Center (one stop away) where you can visit the Space Needle and the EMP Museum, etc (I highly recommend the Nirvana exhibit, making your own music upstairs, and for those Princess Bride and Harry Potter fans, you can see some artifacts from the movies there). There is a market deli downstairs and plenty of great restaurants, literally next door. Parking was included but be mindful if you are renting a car, I swear the parking spots are smaller than those here in San Francisco - giant mini-vans are a bear to park there!"
2191169,28204816,2015-03-20,24384630,Megan,Great location.  Easy access to downtown Seattle.  It was a nice trip and located close to the convention center (we were able to walk to our meetings there).  Thanks! 
2191169,30183133,2015-04-19,23391701,George,Great location. Apartment was clean and comfortable. 
2191169,33587249,2015-05-30,20633257,Eduardo,"The apartment was OK and the check-in check-out as well. But the apartment had little natural light, and the lamps inside were a bit insufficient. "
2191169,38720349,2015-07-18,9058472,Matthew,Perfect location in the heart of downtown. Clean comfortable and plenty of space. This is the second time we stayed here and won't be the last. 
2191169,49387994,2015-10-03,264597,Christian,"Great location, friendly staff and amazing view."
2191169,50189778,2015-10-10,10511918,Julieta,"the neighborhood was the best, the apartment AWESOME; very spacious :)
I will definitely come back!
100% recommended
"
2191169,51435708,2015-10-20,40824202,Maggie,Check-in was easy. The unit was well equipped and clean. Location was perfect. Could walk almost everywhere.
2191169,52172922,2015-10-26,327495,Michael,"This was the perfect apartment for our time in seattle, it was extremely convenient to everything. The apartment itself is recently remodeled and everything was really nice. Has a great view too."
2191169,52980463,2015-11-03,45013504,Judy,My family and I loved this condo unit!  Very spacious and comfortable.  Close to Pike Market and walking distance to all the restaurants and bars.  Highly recommend it and we will definitely come back again.
2191169,56432557,2015-12-13,21232623,Taylor,"Jordan was prompt and specific in his communications. The unit was very clean and well furnished, and perfectly located just a few blocks away from the Market. Would definitely stay here again. "
6436727,33038179,2015-05-24,3191483,Jeremy,"My experience at Alan's place was fantastic. Once booked he was easy to contact about the key exchange and even though our times didn't line up perfectly he went above and beyond to accommodate. The apartment was clean and stocked with everything we needed, aswell as a perfect location for everything we wanted to do over the weekend. I would DEFINETLY stay here again. "
6436727,34337134,2015-06-07,33737195,Amanda,Alan was a fantastic host! He was extremely flexible and accommodating when scheduling how and when to obtain the key as we were coming in from out of town. The location was in walking distance from major attractions and in a great location for restaurants and bars. I would highly recommend this listing for any visits to the Seattle area.
6436727,35036760,2015-06-14,34922819,Marshall,"Alan was a very accommodating and friendly host. He made himself available to pick up the keys (during work hours) and let me know when he was available via phone/text. His place was clean and had the amenities you would want. His apartment was walking distance, or a short drive, from a lot of attractions which was great! I would recommend staying here."
6436727,35737054,2015-06-21,13518811,Brook,"Alan is a very thoughtful host. Upon arrival, we found a welcome note, a bag of coffee (much appreciated!), and a few maps and Seattle guidebooks. Throughout our short stay, Alan made helpful suggestions for restaurants and sights in the area. Alan was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns and was amicable throughout.

The apartment itself was exceedingly tidy and had everything we needed. We enjoyed the vantage point that comes from being on the fifth floor. The outside of the apartment building is not much to look at (typical of multi-family housing of this vintage - we lived in a very similar building in the Bay Area), but the building felt secure and the relative quiet of the neighborhood was a welcome respite from the din of downtown.

Overall, our stay was pleasant and Alan's hospitality outstanding. We would stay there again and recommend Alan's apartment to others. "
6436727,38945140,2015-07-19,807557,Andrew,"Alan's place was in a perfect location for exploring downtown Seattle and the Capital Hill area (bars, restaurants, etc.).  It is located close enough to the main hotel corridors (and all that implies) without being right in the heart of it, allowing you to get a better feel for an actual Seattle neighborhood.  The apartment complex and apartment are on the older side and, like most of Seattle, do not have AC.  So if it is hot, his place will be quite toasty.    

Alan is a laid back and generous host and is very accommodating in your arrival and departure times.  We arrived late and had a late checkout and he let us keep our bags at his place while we explored the city.  Overall, if you are looking for a clean, no frills place to explore Seattle I would recommend Alan's place."
6436727,41161974,2015-08-04,39709926,Josie,"Alan was incredibly friendly and easy to get a hold of. He answered all our questions in a timely manner and was super accommodating in terms of getting the key to us and showing us around. He even left us a bit of food and coffee!

His apartment was tidy, clean, and VERY centrally located. Walking distance to EVERYTHING around town - Capitol Hill, Downtown, the Seattle Center, you name it. Despite being in the middle of everything, the street he lives on is quiet and there is not much noise at night. 

I would definitely recommend Alan's place to anyone looking to stay close to downtown, in a clean, and private apartment.   "
6436727,42617731,2015-08-14,39283205,Breezeaa,"Alan was a great host. The apartment was located well within Seattle and close to downtown. It had a nice balcony and roomy living room, you'll enjoy. "
6436727,43873635,2015-08-22,755590,Kai,"Alan was low key, responsive, easy to work with. The place was exactly as described and super convenient to everywhere I wanted to be. Great value, highly recommended!"
6436727,44867092,2015-08-29,32452399,Alex,"We had a good experience staying at Alan's apartment. It's in a really convenient location for exploring the city - walking distance to Cap Hill, Belltown, and SLU. Alan was helpful and responsive for any questions we had. The space was well-kept and came with useful amenities."
6436727,46085267,2015-09-07,40328015,Matt,"Alan was absolutely great! The place was clean and as described and he went out of his way to provide materials such as maps, guides, and advice on how to make my trip awesome. He was very responsive and I would definitely recommend his apartment for someone else in the future."
6436727,48617135,2015-09-27,44386415,Nick,"The place was great, comfy and relaxing. Alan was a great host and even left hiking books and maps for us. Close to lots of things on Seattle and was easily accessible. All in all a great experience! "
6436727,49524203,2015-10-04,44789762,Maria,"Alan was a great host: very responsive, organized, lowkey, and provided clear instructions. There was also a welcome letter and gift for us the apartment! 
The apartment was clean, simple, with ample hot water for showering; and the patio has a wonderful view of downtown Seattle. The building is located conveniently and is walking distance (or short/cheap drive to many places)."
6436727,54931545,2015-11-25,29679319,Kyle,"Alan is a great host and his place is just as advertised. The apartment is clean, spacious, and centrally located downtown in a nice quiet area. Alan was very hospitable and accommodating, as well as responsive and helpful. Extremely satisfied with my experience. "
6436727,57961322,2015-12-30,46886665,Anthony,"Alan's place was great - clean, great location, and his hospitality making sure we had everything was nice.  Definitely recommend the place."
7332364,48935871,2015-09-29,28188086,Sonia,"This is a great condo!  Amy met us promptly, let us in and gave us a tour.  The condo is very modern, clean, and fabulous location.  "
7974112,44722491,2015-08-28,1197207,Alicia,"I used AirBnB to host a candidate for a job interview I was facilitating - Alan was accommodating and my candidate had a great stay. Thank you, Alan!"
7974112,45195270,2015-08-31,42331152,Hasani,"Neat as a pin, comfortable, quiet, plus wi-fi - exactly what I was looking for.  What more could a tired event vendor want at the end of the day?  

Alan is an accommodating and cordial host, and was very gracious about the fact that I arrived a little sooner than expected.  Alan also has a good sense for details - a spare toothbrush if needed, a flashlight by the bed (because the power had been flickering that day), and fresh fruit and eggs in the fridge.  The bed was ultra-comfy and I slept like a log.  :)

"
7974112,45440641,2015-09-02,39637466,Ford,Alan has a great spot in a nice location. The upstairs was an entire level all to ourselves with another bedroom for extra airbnb guests. Alan was a great guy to talk to and the communication was fast and easy. I would definitely recommend staying here!
7974112,45758250,2015-09-05,21329974,Tyler,"The only thing better than Alan's hospitality is the comfort of the beds he offers. The neighborhood is great, and you're within walking distance to a number of bars, restaurants and coffee shops. I would definitely stay here again. "
7974112,46833393,2015-09-13,43723087,Matthias,Alan was helpful and communicative leading up to and during our stay. He was a wonderful host and the room was just like in the description. I would definitely choose the room again.
7974112,47822966,2015-09-21,16636804,Bhargava,Yes. Alan was really welcoming. I had a really good time. 
7974112,49040539,2015-09-30,8920667,Michael,"Alan was a gracious host. The location was good for me and the accommodations were quite  comfortable  Overall, it was an excellent airbnb."
7974112,50814306,2015-10-14,44873095,David,"It would be hard to imagine a more gracious host. From the moment I arrived at his home Alan made sure that I was comfortable, and knew where everything was in the house, as well the availability of local services, and bus routes to the city should I need them. As it turned out I did use the Rapid Ride, and it is a great service to downtown. Fast and inexpensive. I originally booked for 4 nights, but extended another 2 as I was so comfortable in the location, and with a host who was there, but mostly wasn't visible. It was a truly great experience and should I have the need for such again in Seattle, I will be checking the availability on this residence . Once again Alan, thankyou so much."
7974112,52167888,2015-10-26,43534851,Amin,I loved staying at this place. The house was so clean and had a character. Alan was nice and caring. He helped us with whatever we needed. I think the listing was accurate and it looked just like the pictures. There was free street parking available less than 20 steps from the door.
7974112,52933871,2015-11-02,47587013,Destiny," We rented this room for one night on Halloween as a safe place to stay as opposed to commuting home.  We briefly met Alan as we arrived, he was friendly and accommodating asking if we needed anything. I have nothing bad to say about my experience with Alan. If you stay in this location you should try eating at Bongos, so delicious and within walking distance!"
3751503,16962692,2014-08-04,14996610,Paul,Andy was very friendly and responsive. His apartment was just as listed and the location was great. We found the apartment to be very clean and comfortable and a perfect spot for our weekend in town. There were no problems checking in or out and Andy let us borrow his parking permit so that we could park on the street (definitely make arrangements if you are planning to drive because there is permit parking only in the surrounding neighborhood.) 
3751503,17312900,2014-08-10,14638077,Josh,Andy was a great host. Everything was clean and ready for us to use. This place is very well priced and well located. There are a lot of great restaurants and bars near by. Its also not too bad of a walk downtown.
3751503,17412404,2014-08-11,19452903,Emily,"Short stay but a great experience, super easy. Andy was super friendly and had lots of rad canvas photos on the wall...great photography! The place was clean and exactly what I expected based on what I saw."
3751503,17534161,2014-08-13,12590813,Joshua,"Andy was a great host.  He kept in contact with us very nicely as our trip got closer and stayed in contact during our trip, as needed.  He welcomed us nicely and made sure we were all settled in.  The apartment is a funky space - perfect for a Seattle getaway.  Would definitely stay again.  "
3751503,18133588,2014-08-22,17002418,Erik,"Andy was a great host! He was very friendly and let me know everything I needed to before leaving the apartment for a week. The space is nicely decorated, clean, and feels very cozy. It's a real treat if you enjoy ""nerdy"" stuff such as sci-fi movies or computers as there is a lot of that around. All in all I had a very pleasant stay here and would recommend itto anyone looking for a place in Seattle."
3751503,18431633,2014-08-26,19347425,Zena,"My brother and I stayed here for a long weekend and it worked out really well.  Andy was very welcoming and quick to respond to all emails.  His home was a great place to come back to after a long day sightseeing, and he has a great movie collection!  We didn't have a car during our stay but the location was awesome so we had no problems walking or busing anywhere we needed to go.  Thanks Andy!"
3751503,18511187,2014-08-27,20383447,Stephannie,"Andy was a great host, very personable and friendly right off the bat, and definitely went out of his way to help us out (i.e. let us use the parking pass for a little while longer as we checked out the city :) ). His place is clean and super interesting. Great location for checking out Capital Hill (so many great restaurants and bars right just around the corner) and only a $10 cab ride to downtown or a 20-30min walk. Would recommend! "
3751503,18894358,2014-09-02,11983061,Mike,"Andy was really friendly and helpful. His place was spotless, perfectly sized, and he made sure we had everything we needed. He even checked in with us several times throughout the stay. I would absolutely stay with him again."
3751503,19108115,2014-09-06,20816772,Logan,Andy was very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was clean & extremely convenient to all of the downtown locations we needed to visit during our short 3 day trip.  
3751503,19383701,2014-09-11,3170509,Franz,"Andy was an awesome host. His place was very unique, spacious and clean. I loved the vegetable garden and the location was perfect. Thanks again!"
3751503,19550291,2014-09-14,20592590,Richard,Andy has a very unique and welcoming home...once we arrived he did not hesitate to make us feel at home and gave us the insight and recommendations on where to experience Seattle on localists point of view...his place is in a great neighborhood....clean....safe and just a quick bus ride from downtown....would stay again....Thank you for everything Andy
3751503,19662023,2014-09-15,7240379,Sebastian,"Andy is a great host, and his place was really nice.  Tons of cool art, computer gadgetry, and a sweet home entertainment setup.  The neighborhood was quiet, but it's also just a two minute walk to the nearest bars."
3751503,19989346,2014-09-21,21143109,Annie,"This was the absolute best AirBnB experience I have had yet!  Andy is friendly, welcoming, and his home is a perfect launch pad for visiting Seattle.  Very comfortable, relaxed, and fun.  I will be planning my next visit around when it's available again.  "
3751503,20076141,2014-09-22,21543945,Audra,Andy was a great host ! He was very welcoming. We loved his place and it was a great distance to everything ! Walked downtown very easily! Loved it ! And would reccommend it :)
3751503,20379682,2014-09-28,18017057,Benny,"Andy and his place were both absoloutely awesome! The plants, the massive entertainment system, the huge selection of movies, and the fantastic location were all fantastic. Andy was flexible with check in times, and was great for facilitating anything we needed help with and giving us advice about getting around town. Would absoloutely recommend this place, and will likely be staying here again in the future!"
3751503,20473190,2014-09-29,21235308,Anna,"Andy and his place were AMAZING!  

Andy was so nice and helpful.  We had never been to that part of Seattle before and he recommended some great near by restaurants and bars to check out (you were right about that Unicorn place...so interesting...haha).  

The place was wonderful, I wish we would have stayed more than one night.  Everything was very clean, very welcoming environment! Such a great place to chill and hangout.  

Thank you Andy for a great experience!"
3751503,21262988,2014-10-13,4348489,Larry,"Andy’s apartment was a real treat on our weekend visit to Seattle. A great location, within easy walking distance to restaurants and anything else you could want in Capitol Hill, and a fairly short (if hilly) walk to downtown. We just parked our car and walked everywhere. 

The apartment reflects his unique personality - informal, artistic, geeky and proud of it. It’s a welcoming and comfortable place to spend a few days exploring the city. Glad we stayed here."
3751503,21555316,2014-10-19,8074661,Rob,"Andy's a warm and personable guy, and made it easy to relax into his place.  The apartment has ""personality"" written all over it - his eclectic interests cover every available surface.  The location is fantastic, with plenty of food, cocktail, and entertainment options only a few blocks away - easy for walking. It's also close enough to the city center that a quick drive or cab/bus ride gets you to anything you want. 

Andy provided a street-parking pass, for which there was plenty of space right by the front door.

I'm a borderline insomniac - so when I say that I went unconscious immediately upon hitting the bed, you can ... rest assured... (heh) that it was extremely comfortable.   

Everything went exactly as planned/expected, so I'd absolutely recommend checking this one out, if you like a geeky clutter to keep your interests when you're taking a breather from exploring Seattle!"
3751503,22035192,2014-10-28,9728020,Chris,"Andy's Geeks Paradise is fantastic. Close to a bunch of cafes, restaurants and bars. It has a great feel to it. Fully equipped kitchen and bathroom, a comfy bed, a good couch with a big TV and computer for those rainy Seattle days. "
3751503,22315278,2014-11-03,22177412,Michelle,"Andy and his apartment are super great.  We had an amazing weekend trip to Seattle!  The location of the apartment was great, in walking distance to many restaurants and bars.  The apartment had all the right amenities and a very comfy bed.  We would here again."
3751503,22639386,2014-11-10,4679810,Michael,A+ experience. Andy offered a very warm welcome to his unique abode and gave us great advice on things to do and restaurants/pubs to check out. I strongly recommend his Geeks Paradise to others! It's location is superb. :)
3751503,23279641,2014-11-27,9913949,Zak,"Andy's place was great for a night in Seattle. The neighborhood is conveniently located and has tons of great shops and restaurants sprinkled around.

Although we didn't get a chance to meet Andy, the check in/out process was simple and convenient. The home was full of interesting displays and made for a unique experience. Also, the shower pressure was amazing!! Would definitely recommend this place!"
3751503,34195866,2015-06-06,28312498,Amanda,Andy is a wonderful host with an apartment that is perfect for two people visiting Seattle. His place is in a very convenient location that isn't too far from the popular sights in the area but also is on a quiet street which was nice at night. The bed was super comfortable and it was nice to have a computer accessible for last minute research. I definitely would stay at his place again if we're ever back in town. Thanks again!
3751503,35200381,2015-06-16,8525894,Shalini,"We definitely felt welcomed, especially with Andy being flexible with our  unpredictable arrival time. He gave us all the information we needed, and then left us alone to enjoy our stay. The location was perfect for our needs - within walking distance to Seattle University, restaurants, shops etc but in a quiet and pretty neighborhood. The accommodation was comfortable as well as visually striking and fun!"
3751503,35589897,2015-06-20,9913949,Zak,"This was my second time staying at Andy's place and it was just the same as before. He lives in a neighborhood close to a bustling part of town filled with great shops and restaurants, and is in close proximity to the more touristy parts of town if that's what you're into. His place is just as described in the listing and very comfortable. If you want to spend the night in after a long day of travel, he's even provided well labeled connections for his home theater system so you can pop Netflix up on the TV effortlessly. It's a solid place to stay and my go-to for crashing during trips up North."
3751503,36246547,2015-06-26,25644321,Michael,"Andy is an awesome, laid back host with an incredible place in Seattle. Wouldn't hesitate trying to stay here again if I have the option next time I'm in Seattle. "

I found the place to be very comfortable, cozy and corresponding exactly to what was described online. The bed is very comfortable, so I slept like a baby. Last, but not least, the location is great!! I parked my car when I arrived and I was able to walk everywhere. I really recommend Andy's place and will definitely try to stay there again the next time I visit Seattle."
3751503,38136801,2015-07-13,32649802,Michael,"Thanks Andy. Great apartment and in a perfect location for a week in Seattle. So close to endless bars, stores and cafes. Thanks again and Seattle is such a great city.
Cheers  Michael.

3751503,41100703,2015-08-04,5136929,Amelia & David,"David & I spent 1 week at Andy's place, it was great!  Andy welcomed us with a candid smile & made sure we felt at home.  He is a fantastic host,  who acts promptly when giving feedback. Example,  internet dropped 1 day, he immediately called  provider & got internet issue fixed.   Any future guest can count on being protected by Andy, if help is within his reach, he will do his best.   Andy is a wonderful host. 

Andy's place is cozy, beautiful art all around, a comfy bed and fantastic grill in the patio, where we made a few dinners & just chilled.   1 of our favorite bars is Canon, ~5 blocks away, AMAZING location. Plus, Andy has many good movies, action movies... we spent a whole weekend on his sofa doing nothing else than watching movies, rare for us. It was perfect!  Thank you Andy! :)  "

The Wifi signal was excellent, and that's high on my priority list.  The available driveway parking was also a major plus.  And the drive to the central Seattle area was only about 15 to 20 minutes. 
Bonus: bed was comfortable and there's a nice back porch/yard you can enjoy.  Would I stay there again? Yes. 

"
3772674,18694015,2014-08-30,20482610,Catherine,"A wonderful place to stay. The apartment was clean and quite, very much our own space for the duration of our stay. Our hosts made sure we had everything we needed. We were close to shops and restaurants in the area and just a bus ride away from downtown Seattle."
3772674,18848225,2014-09-01,12884714,Diana,"My Dad and kid brother actually stayed here, and they had a wonderful time! The hosts were polite and responsive, and the apartment itself is very comfortable and clean. My brother didn't want to leave! 

The location is quiet, but quite convenient - a little under a mile to get to Old Ballard and the Locks. 

The hosts also left a $10 card to a local cafe/bakery (Alison's Coastal Cafe & Bakery, about a 15 min walk away) - delicious crepes and friendly staff! 

This place is definitely recommended!"
3772674,18918159,2014-09-02,2897522,Jessica,"Kim and Michael were great, as was the space! We didn't stay long, but felt comfortable, had a great night's sleep, and got some work done with their high speed internet. Oh! And walked to a delish dinner in downtown Ballard. "
3772674,19228531,2014-09-08,20443638,Caroline,"The place was beautiful and in a great location! Kim met with me at the beginning of our stay, and since we didn't have any problems that was the only interaction that we had. The place was very clean, with fresh linens and bath supplies. She offered us the use of her bikes, coupons for a local brunch spot, and our own off street parking spot. She even left us k-cups, creamer, and sugar for coffee! "
3772674,19390402,2014-09-11,19838220,Jason,"Wonderfully appointed, complete basement apartment in a great location, walkable to a revitalized Ballard and the Locks. Kim, Michael and Vivian were perfect hosts, inviting me into their home for dinner, as well as providing a voucher for a local cafe!"
3772674,19546384,2014-09-14,7023331,Danielle,"Kim's suite is immaculate and newly renovated. It's even more lovely than the photos, and the perfect place if you are looking for a quiet, self-contained place to hang your hat in the Ballard hood. NW Market street is minutes away by foot, with a hip Sunday farmer's market and plenty of cafes, bars, and boutiques. For runners and outdoor fans, a loop around nearby Green Lake makes a great workout. Kim has 2 adult bikes for tenant use.
Kim is a warm, friendly host. She & her family live on-site, so do expect some normal coming & going, but this didn't bother me. There is a lovely backyard patio & green space (great for yoga!). Although a few bits & bobs were missing from the suite's inventory of what I needed to be at home, the space is newly being set-up and I believe Kim will have this sorted soon. I would stay here again."
3772674,19807367,2014-09-18,10510340,Megan,"We loved staying with Kim in Ballard! Upon our arrival she greeted us with a thorough tour of the apartment and all relevant info about our stay, including some great tips for local places to visit and a $10 gift card to a local eatery. The apartment itself was perfect for what we needed and while it didn't have a kitchen it was stocked with a hot plate and dishes, a mini fridge and even a casserole dish in the microwave. 

Aside from the place, Ballard is a great neighborhood with several shops and restaurants just a walk away. We would definitely recommend this apartment to others visiting Seattle. 

Thanks Kim!"
3772674,20151911,2014-09-24,1673320,Anthony,"Apartment very clean and listing accurate.  Kim is very helpfull and responsive.  Overall excellent for older guests.  Cozy with all you need.  We were visiting grand children an did not spend much time in unit.  Excellent Ballard location with off street parking; a real plus! Very safe neighborhood with lots of good restaurants and coffee shops close by.

There was water in the fridge and all of the sheets and towels smelled so clean (really nice if you're on a long trip and living out of a bag!) it's in a great neighborhood with a grocery store close and tons of nice places to eat. I would recommend walking to old Ballard ave which is a diagonal side street with hipster shopping and bars galore. Could've spent a whole night just eating and drinking there. Couldn't have asked for a better place!"
3772674,21036694,2014-10-10,10157972,Steven,"Great place to stay. Very roomy, clean, private, and convenient. Hosts were friendly and helpful. Very reasonable for an entire floor of a house with a private entrance. No complaints. Will return."
3772674,21516440,2014-10-19,20611167,Carolyn,We were visiting our daughter who lives nearby. Ballard is a wonderful walking neighborhood with a good variety of restaurants and shops. The local farmers' market was exceptional.

It's a very comfortable apartment to relax and hang out in, and in a cute Ballard neighborhood. Everything was very clean. Kim and her family are wonderful hosts -- they greeted us on arrival to make sure we got in and found everything we needed, and even before we arrived Kim asked if there was anything in particular we would need during out stay (decaf coffee, etc). Overall, really nice space with lots of little touches to make sure you have a pleasant stay. "
3772674,22660738,2014-11-11,22459991,Allison,"We had an amazing stay here. Everything we could have needed to feel at home, from an iron to a keurig. The kitchenette had a microwave, toaster oven, skillet and even a plug in single stove. We were supplied with dishes pots and pans for making meals at home and plenty of coffee for mornings.  Kim's apartment was very close to market street which has many cute cafes and hosts the Sunday Ballard market. It's also very close to Golden Gardens for an afternoon on the beach. She had movies for us to watch and a comfortable sofa. There was lots of drawers and closet space for storing clothes. The porch was lovely, going along with the theme of our entire stay. Thanks Kim!"
3772674,23034989,2014-11-21,3315307,Christina,Kim welcomed me and was hospitable with her greeting. The apt. was just as the pictures showed.  The neighborhood quite and safe and convenient to restaurants and shops.

3772674,23880452,2014-12-13,904944,Amy,"Kim ' s place is much nicer than it appwars. Really it was such a perfect little place, far better than a mid level hotel. Everything is new and we'll thought out."
3772674,24706361,2015-01-02,1241431,Erik,This place was just perfect for us. My fiancée and I came to visit family/friends for the holidays and we're looking for a cozy home base during our stay and that's exactly what we got. Kim was very welcoming and accommodating to our schedule. Would definitely recommend! 
3772674,25266697,2015-01-11,5238925,Wilson,Kim was very kind in accommodating us and walking us through the unit. The property and Ballard were both beautiful and convenient. We would stay again. Thank you Kim!
3772674,25436100,2015-01-16,24169156,David,Our stay was wonderful and proved to be the perfect spot for us. Kim was there to welcome us and see to it that we had everything we needed.  We would not hesitate to book a future stay or recommend her hospitality to anyone!
3772674,26222828,2015-02-07,18428600,Ariana,Kim is a gracious host. The space is very well appointed with more than you'll need. I was there for a week before moving from Seattle. I'll be sure to check this listing first on my trips back! 
3772674,26425195,2015-02-12,26444708,Al,Kim and the apartment were great.  Ballard is a super neighborhood.  We walked to all sorts of great restaurants and went to the Ballard Locks to watch the boats and birds pretty much every day.  It was also very easily accessible to the rest of Seattle.  We also have family in the area and it was a nice place to sit with them and talk for a while.
3772674,26928397,2015-02-22,10389285,Katie,"Kim was a wonderful host. I booked this space for my dad's visit, somewhere where he'd be able to have his own space, but close enough to us as we live locally. The accommodations were very comfortable for him, close to coffee shops he was able to walk to and so on. Kim was very understanding when he lost the KEY to the apartment. He's new to AirBnB, what can I say! I would definitely recommend this space for someone visiting. "
3772674,27275128,2015-03-01,27234462,Andrew,Great location and very kind hosts

3772674,28251516,2015-03-21,25601195,Mimi,"What a perfect place to stay while visiting Seattle.  The apartment was cozy, clean, and in a convenient location.  We couldn't have been more pleased with the accommodations!  Kim was in touch during our stay to make sure that we had everything we needed.  There was nothing missing  and I would highly recommend the Cozy Ballard Apartment to anyone looking for a home away from home, while in Seattle!  "
3772674,28704259,2015-03-29,11165464,Emily,"Kim met us as we arrived and gave us a very informative and warm welcome! We knew where everything was and definitely felt like we could treat the place like home for our stay. The apartment was super clean and all we needed for a comfortable stay. To top it off, the area that the apartment is in is rich with things to do! We went to some of the restaurants and sights that Kim suggests on her page and were not disappointed! "
3772674,29064613,2015-04-03,16992716,Courtney,"My sister and I had a great experience at Kim's place. We were driving into the city and arrived late in the evening, which was no problem. A key was left for us-making the process very easy! The apartment is very cute and clean. It has everything you need for a short visit to Seattle. Although we ate out most meals, it was great to have a kitchen for snacks, drinks etc. 
The location of the apartment is perfect. We were able to walk to explore Ballard as well as hop on the bus to easily get to downtown. I can't think of any negative aspects of our stay at Kim's airbnb! "
3772674,29841156,2015-04-13,4827738,Rick,"Kim was there to greet us when we arrived and showed us everything we needed to know about the lovely and very cozy apartment. 
She went out of her way to make sure we had everything we needed. We had mentioned in passing that we are tea drinkers. The next day Kim had a kettle for us.
The Ballard neighbourhood is spectacular. The apartment is on a peaceful and beautifully leafy street. Yet, only two blocks away is a lively and interesting street of restaurants, cafes and shops.
We really enjoyed Seattle and this delightful home base made it that much more enjoyable."
3772674,30374097,2015-04-21,22838770,Devin,"Great home, beautiful neighborhood.  Plenty of privacy, and easy communication with the host.  Thanks again Kim, our stay was wonderful and would highly recommend this apartment!!!! 5 stars for sure!"

3772674,31817463,2015-05-10,31547022,Billy,"Kim and her family were incredibly friendly and welcoming.  It's always awesome to meet great folks willing to open their home and make sure you have everything you need.  The apartment was very comfortable and clean, with the perfect backyard patio to kick back and relax.  This is a great spot for your trip to Seattle.  If you are concerned about only having 1 bed, the couch makes for a great spot to crash.

We had a late arrival into Seattle, and Kim was very accommodating with having the apartment ready, and making sure we were able to ""check-in"" a bit later than normal.  Thanks again for the random request of a tape measure!

I am on the road over 100 days a year, and can say this place will exceed any travelers needs.  Thanks for a great long weekend and I will definitely spread the word about your apartment.

- Billy"
3772674,32175933,2015-05-15,17172594,Margaret,We had a wonderful time staying in Kim's apartment. Ballard was the perfect jumping off point for exploring Seattle and also feeling part of the neighborhood. Kim was great about communicating everything to us and was responsive to our questions and needs. We would definitely stay here again!

The apartment is thoughtfully layed out and spotless. Perfect for two people. The neighborhood is charming with colorful flowering plants throughout and with short walks to the downtown bus and to numerous restaurants, pubs, eclcectic cafes, and coffee shops. We thoroughly our stay at Kim's apt. Highly recoommend for the perfect stay in Seattle."
3772674,34402702,2015-06-08,27509471,Lori Ann,"Kim's AirBnB was so clean and comfortable, a home away from home.  We brought our one-year-old along on our travels so Kim was thoughtful in providing us a portable crib for him to sleep in.  He especially loved the backyard!  We loved how we had a mini kitchen.  We also loved the location and got the opportunity to visit the amazing Ballard Farmer's Market on Sundays.  We hope to stay here again!"
3772674,34670718,2015-06-10,22571243,Nancy Lynn,"Loved the Cozy Ballard Apartment! Very roomy, clean and Kim is a gracious host!

Thanks Kim!
"
3772674,34929337,2015-06-14,24592273,Kathie,"Kim was a huge help in helping us get out of Seattle traffic!  Our GPs failed us, and Kim was there to help (even though I bothered her at work!).  It was great to know that she was concerned about us!"
3772674,35327095,2015-06-17,34407118,Matthew,Kim's apartment was absolutely perfect for my wife and I's trip to Seattle and our first Airbnb experience. The apartment was just as advertised in the pictures and it was spotless. We had a chance to meet Kim and her wonderful family as they were enjoying the beautiful Seattle weather we had all week! She was an amazing host and provided very helpful tips that helped make our vacation even more enjoyable. The apartment felt very spacious and we had everything we needed. The apartment is only a couple minute walk to a bus stop and a 10-15 minute drive to downtown which made it easy to get around. We would definitely stay with Kim again next time we are in Seattle.  
3772674,35633215,2015-06-21,2647849,Kim,"Kim's little apartment was so cute and perfect for our little family (two adults and a toddler). She even put a pack n' play out for us, which was super helpful, and our daughter had a great time playing in the backyard with the balls and deck chairs. The location was convenient to the heart of downtown Ballard, easy access to the rest of the city. Excellent breakfast at Allison's with the gift card Kim put out (try the bacon waffle sandwich), but plenty of great food within a 5-10 min walk. Also super easy and quick walk to the Ballard Locks, which is always a favorite. "
3772674,36005794,2015-06-24,28407837,Lucy,"Great experience for both of us. Good communication, lovely and warm welcome and very accommodating.

3772674,37296742,2015-07-06,8111349,Steve,"My wife and I visited Seattle for a wedding and some vacation time and thoroughly enjoyed Kim's cozy Ballard apartment. The space is perfect for a couple (us), and well located to make any place in Seattle easily accessible.

We enjoyed walks to dining and parks in this vibrant and neat neighborhood.

Kim is a gracious, comfortable host and the well appointed apartment is thoughtfully stocked with conveniences."
3772674,38979245,2015-07-20,8855332,Nicole,"The apartment is perfect, fully stocked and very clean.
So much thought put into making this space modern, functional, and comfortable. 
Checkin was seamless and even allowed to arrive a little early
Had a great welcoming committee (put a huge smile on my face)
Bikes were available for us to use and worked out great for our tour of Seattle.
The location is perfect, a little bit off the main drag ( good thing)but still close to everything great about the Pacific Northwest. You must have a bonfire at Golden Gardens Beach only about a mile down the street
Designated off street parking was greatly appreciated. 
Kim and the kids were great and very friendly"
3772674,39456292,2015-07-23,719449,Kathy,"I stayed here while visiting my daughter.

Kim has thought of everything to make the place feel welcoming, comfortable and cozy. She is a very welcoming and gracious host and happy to accommodate your needs. The apartment has a separate side entrance and place to park the car which really contributes to the feeling of privacy. I could really go on and on about how wonderful we felt staying here. The location is also very convenient as it a walking distance to restaurants and shops. 
It is clear from the moment you walk in that Kim loves hosting people and takes a lot of pride in doing it. Next time we come to Seattle we hope to stay at this wonderful cozy apartment again. "
3772674,41317838,2015-08-07,28839615,Marcia,"All was perfect for our needs. We enjoyed the apartment, and it was quite comfortable and clean. Really liked the Keurig coffee machine for our morning cup."
3772674,42380052,2015-08-13,1199999,Erik,"Kim is a great host and went out of her way to make sure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed. Apartment was clean, spacious for two and everything had been very well thought out. Location was great and it was nice to have our own parking space. This room would be fine for a quick trip - but really shines with a longer stay. 

The only thing to note is that this is a separate apartment in a larger active family home. It may not be appropriate for all visitors - but it worked great for us and we look forward to staying here again!  "
3772674,43231240,2015-08-18,34684591,Sahra,"We really enjoyed staying at Kim's place! The apartment is perfect for a trip to Seattle, much better than a hotel. Everything was very clean. We didn't have a car, which wasn't a big deal, since there are busses that take you straight downtown. 
Next time we come to Seattle we hope to stay here again!  "
3772674,44283250,2015-08-25,21979276,Diane,"The Ballard apartment was perfect for our trip to visit our kids in Seattle. We loved the location-close to coffee shops, restaurants, and great walking paths. The Sunday farmer's market in Ballard is the best. Thanks Kim and family. "

3772674,47042872,2015-09-15,3906153,New,"I reserved this unit for my parents while they visited us. Here's their report:
We loved staying here. Cozy Ballard Apartment describes this unit perfectly. It was beautifully furnished, and included a bedroom, bath, kitchen, living and dining room. A sliding glass door opened to a cute backyard with Adirondack chairs, expanding the space. The host provided coffee, water, salt/pepper, and bath essentials. She also changed towels mid-stay. It was a cute neighborhood, and we were able to walk to just about anything we wanted: restaurants, grocery store, movie theater, Farmers Market, and of course, coffee shops. Best of all, we were able walk to the hospital to see our newly-born grandson! We plan to return for many more visits with him, and hope to return to this ""Cozy Ballard Apartment."""
3772674,47390931,2015-09-18,41854745,Kyla,"Kim's place was wonderful, so cute and clean and gave me a place to rejuvenate during a busy business trip. I would highly recommend staying here!  "

It was exactly as pictured, very comfortable and a fantastic location. We were able to walk to nearby restaurants and it was an easy drive to downtown. Although we didn't get to meet in person, we were able to communicate via text and she was very accommodating. Thank you so much for everything, Kim!"
3772674,50795677,2015-10-14,5332508,Annie,We loved staying in this cozy studio plus in Ballard! It made traveling for work a lot of fun and was so homey! We're in a hotel now and miss the comfort of this fantastic spot! What an amazing find in a fun neighborhood! 
3772674,53873040,2015-11-14,34406265,Narisa,"I booked this apartment for a month-long stay for my parents and they had a wonderful experience!   Clean, recently built apartment in a great location - would definitely recommend if you are looking for a private rental with separate bedroom. 

-Kim, the host, was friendly and easy to coordinate with early on.  Since I was renting for my parents' visit once my baby arrived, I had a lot of questions.  She was very responsive and also willing to accommodate some shift in dates (e.g. in case our baby arrived early/late and the unit wasn't already booked)

-The apartment is essentially the first/ground floor of a home - it sits behind the garage, and the family lives upstairs.  The family was very quiet and my parents never had any issues (note- they were at my house most days, and back at the rental in evenings)

-Location!  If you are looking to stay in an amazing Seattle neighborhood, you'll have a great experience in Ballard, and this apartment is walking distance to everything.  Within a short walk (about 10 minutes) you'd have access to all of the great restaurants and charming shops in historic downtown Ballard.  You are also in walking distance to the Ballard Locks, one of Seattle's top attractions, and where you can see Salmon migrate in the summer through an underground fish ladder :) "
3772674,54918603,2015-11-25,35569592,Joanne, Kim's place was absolutely perfect the bed was amazing it was so comfortable .  Lots of privacy wonderful hot water for the shower .  Kim also had a bicycle for me to use if I needed it .  I will Certainly stay again !!

3772674,56477830,2015-12-14,25797359,Monica,"Kim's place was perfect! It was walking distance to everything - my brother's house as well as eateries, bus stop, market and the Ballard Locks. The place itself had all the necessities such as a living room and a small kitchen area. There was a small oven so my boyfriend and I were able to heat up some pie that we got from the Ballard Farmer's market! It truly was a little home away from home. We can't wait to go back!"

The neighborhood is conveniently located and the off street parking for 3 cars is a bonus. The yard is a cozy hangout place and the inside is clean and beautifully decorated. They had everything we needed. The beds were comfortable and we all slept well. We definitely recommend the house.

I traveled with my Fiance, and our two dogs, and it was a breeze staying with them.
While we were only there for a short trip (We never got to see them) Liza, was only a text away and even kept me updated about my dogs while we went to dinner! 
Would love to stay with them again!"
8472954,55635799,2015-12-03,7207445,Nancy,My son and his girlfriend stayed at Liza's place for several days.  I booked the place for them but did not stay there myself.  According to them their hosts were very warm and welcoming.
9217150,53418691,2015-11-08,12196008,Cindy,"Michael was really accommodating, especially when I arrival changed by several hours!  His apartment was clean bright and spacious, the bed was amazingly comfortable and having all the coffee shop right below us was wonderful!  
We didn't get a chance to go up to the roof, but we will next time, definitely going to stay with him again!"
9217150,54041783,2015-11-15,2573376,Natalie,Michael's studio was super clean and cozy. My best friend and I just wanted a night away to make dinner and hang out. This place was exactly what we needed. Super comfy couch and the bed is memory foam. 10/10 would cozy again!
9217150,55244284,2015-11-29,46591525,Colin,The apartment was clean and organized. Michael worked with us to arrange key pickup on a holiday that was very convenient. Had a great stay!
421168,1640930,2012-07-06,2259045,Ann,"We were looking for a place that was clean and quiet.  The Wallingford Studio was exactly that, plus very private.  Great location, very walkable.  Plenty of parking.

Samantha and Peter are great hosts.  Very accomodating.

Nice furnishings, lovely garden setting.

"
421168,1697132,2012-07-13,2548816,Clint,"Samantha is a delightful hostess.  She made excellent suggestions in helping us pick some local restaurants and gave us some great tips on the local traffic routes as well.   We were very comfortable in her cottage as it was well kept, quiet, comfortable and relaxing."
421168,1708002,2012-07-14,2886970,Wray,"My wife and I had a very satisfying stay at the Greenwood Studio.  We were warmly greeted by Samantha even as we drove up.  The Studio was just what we though it would bet: clean, private, quite and with the needed amenities.  The garden is beautiful.  The whole experience gave us the needed rest for a busy schedule the next day.  "
421168,1724993,2012-07-16,2767392,Wonda Veronica,Comfortable accommodations and thoughtful owners.  A quiet location close to walkable neighborhood. Will be recommending this location for future visitors for sure!  
421168,1735047,2012-07-17,1339491,Sarah,"This sweet little studio was just prefect for us! We had a wedding in Ballard and needed something nearby. The studio was clean, cozy and inviting. The surrounding backyard garden would be a great spot to hang out and relax. Samantha was great- very promp and detailed in her communication (plus she left us some delicious bannana bread). We'd certainly stay here again and will reccomend it to others! "
421168,1742793,2012-07-18,2389640,Liesel,"Sam's communication before our visit was superb. Clear, detailed, welcoming--writing this I realize how much that enhanced our stay, since I already felt like we were staying with someone we knew. Sam was flexible about check-in, and the studio is sooooo lovely! Pristine, comforting, quiet, elegant--the bed was sooooo comfortable.
The gardens right outside the studio are also beautiful, and a neighbor has a little fountain that accompanies the birds.  The studio is a bit out of town, but I write that only in case that makes someone hesitate-because it was really a quick drive (and its on public transport) into town and it was such a lovely place (with yummy banana bread in the morning! an unexpected treat)  that its worth the little drive.  We would absolutely stay here again the next time we're in town. Thank so much, Sam!"
421168,1753797,2012-07-20,1813209,Pat,"Our stay at Greenwood Studio was a wonderful experience, we were very happy with the studio, it was very clean and the well kept.  Samantha had made fresh banana bread, which was left in our room along with orange juice.  They also had greeted us with directions to Key areana which was very handy.  This is a wonderful place to stay, the hosts were very pleasant and thoughtful, we felt very comfotable and would stay there for sure again."
421168,1797208,2012-07-25,2422721,Lauren,Samantha's Greenwood Studio was absolutely lovely!  A perfect spot for spending our long weekend as we did as much of Seattle as we could!  The gardens made me smile with all the flowers and variety and the studio was bright and clean and beautiful!  Samantha and her husband were perfect hosts and provided any help or information that we needed.  Couldn't have been a more pleasant stay!  
421168,1829983,2012-07-29,1729330,Rita,"Samantha and Peter have a very cute studio, and it was quite comfortable to stay in. Both of them were quite friendly, and communication was a breeze. Samantha greeted us on the morning of our arrival with fresh baked banana bread (which was excellent), and we were pleased to find that there was OJ and cream in the fridge, as well as coffee, tea, a french press and a water boiler in the studio.  

If the weather had been a bit nicer we would have made good use of the the chairs on the front porch, as they also have a beautiful back yard. The neighborhood is quiet, and we here able to sleep very soundly! 

Thanks again to both Samantha and Peter for helping make our stay in Seattle a great one!"

After a fabulous jaunt through the NW and into Canada this was a great way to end our trip.  Easily within reach of all of our destinations in Seattle and great to come back and relax between outings."
421168,2021375,2012-08-18,3045173,Noa,"The Greenwood studio is a lovely space, very comfortable and clean all around including the garden area outside where I took my morning tea with the local cat and squirrel. Samantha is very organized and prompt with getting back with any questions about booking and was extremely helpful and patient especially with various arrival directions and personal anxieties around that :-). Peter was very kind and around to help out with any question I had and the generous offering of banana bread was delicious and was my breakfast the next morning. I would recommend this studio if you're looking for a single or double occupancy in that area. Thank you!   "
421168,2046097,2012-08-20,803340,Gerald,"Great location, everything and everywhere we wanted to go was walking distance"
421168,2210362,2012-09-05,101445,Sharon/Richard,"Very private cottage with gracious hosts in comfortable well groomed back yard in a tidy peaceful neighborhood. New, fresh and clean. Best thing is the quiet and privacy. For us the location was great with easy access to Hwy 99 Aurora in North Seattle which got us everywhere we wanted to go including Green Lake, Fremont, Lake City, Bothell, West Seattle, Key Arena, Downtown, Discovery Park, Ballard Locks, Lake Union Maritime Museum, Seward Park, Pacific Science Center, etc. Very quiet, especially for being so close to Aurora. Best if you don't need to cook at all or get online a lot."
421168,2253575,2012-09-10,3023251,Jennilyn,"We stayed with Samantha in her very charming studio in Greenwood and couldn't have asked for a better hostess or a better place to stay!  We had everything we needed in the studio, the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dreamy, we had delicious coffee and even some cream in the mini fridge as well as some fantastic banana bread upon arrival!  Samantha met us when we arrived and made us feel at home as she showed us the studio and offered advice on places to eat and things to see!  We had parking available for our rental car and were very comfortable for the three nights that we stayed.  We would absolutely stay with Samantha again when we come back to Seattle!!"
421168,2262236,2012-09-11,3086028,Carola,"A very attractive and cozy studio in a lovely residential neighborhood of Seattle.  Studio has obviously been completely remodeled recently, with very nice fixtures, comfortable bed, small refrigerator, TV, French press coffee maker.  Hosts are really nice and provide a scrapbook with nearby restaurants, attractions, information on transit lines, etc.  I chose the studio because of its proximity to a friend.  She drove me around, so I really don't  know what is actually nearby or how how easy it is to get around without a car.  "
421168,2490906,2012-10-02,1452223,Amy,"Samantha's Greenwood studio was a convenient and cozy place to stay for my week visit in Seattle. It was super clean and quiet. I would highly recommend it to anyone.

421168,2651362,2012-10-18,1181923,J & J,"Clean & pleasant MIL.  A bit far north from downtown SEA, but the Greenwood neighborhood has plenty to offer on it's own.  Easy street parking. "

421168,2816399,2012-11-05,1624480,Roz,"This is a really cool space that provides many of the basic comforts a traveller could need- the heating and luxurious shower were especially appreciated. This host realllly know what they're doing, and the effort put in is clearly visible :) Also provided was a stack of some great movies in case we needed to kill some time and a few snacks (Amazing apple muffins?!! and OJ/Ccoffee) in case we felt peckish. I can see it being a great place for a single traveller up to a small family. A cab ride from the studio to right downtown on a Sat night cost roughly $22. "
421168,2872651,2012-11-12,4085630,Jenny J.,"A great place to stay, very private and cosy. Not only french-pressed coffee in the room - but half and half in the fridge! A morning snack too.

Samantha is a lovely host and helpful with recommending places to visit and restaurants to check out. "

421168,3036140,2012-12-06,652326,Angela,My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and were delighted by the little touches that our host put in to it! The place itself is beautiful and exactly what we needed while visiting friends and family. Samantha is great at communicating quickly - I couldn't have asked for a better host! I would recommend this place to anyone and would absolutely stay here again.

I would recommend this to any and everyone and I would wholeheartedly return.
Great hosts, great spot, great experience!"
421168,3665980,2013-03-01,228373,Chris,"I was in Seattle for work and needed a convenient spot for a quick overnight stay. Samantha and Peters' bungalow was perfect. They got back to me quickly and my stay there was comfortable and relaxing. Samantha and Peter have paid real attention to making the bungalow as nice as any hotel, from the fixtures in the bathroom to the granite sink to the mini shampoo bottles. Plus a nice banana bread muffin and orange juice waiting for me when I got there. Very thoughtful. 

The area they live in, Greenwood, is an overlooked neighborhood of Seattle to most out of towners, but with the charming retail district not far away - complete with coffee houses, pubs, and restaurants - it's one of the undiscovered places to relax and really enjoy some of the best that Seattle has to offer. Highly recommended!"
421168,3683822,2013-03-04,3718432,Margot,We enjoyed the cozy and clean greenwood studio and Samantha and her husband were gracious hosts. They left us breakfast for the first morning and the space was very clean and inviting! This was a cozy and economical place to stay and we highly recommend it! 
421168,3819228,2013-03-18,5096393,Lorrie,"The Studio was homey and comfortable, easy to find and quiet.  We were a little confused as to why breakfast--a nice offering of fruit and muffins--was only there for one of our three days.  French press coffee and real half and half was great. Overall, this was a very nice and affordable place to stay."
421168,4160236,2013-04-15,1525001,Sherry,Samantha was very accomodating and we really appreciated that.  We had unusual travel plans and she worked with us. Everything about the place was nice.  The backyard was lovely.  
421168,4365595,2013-04-30,5812053,Kelly & Terri,"Our stay at Greenwood Studio was a very positive experience.  Samantha is very professional in setting up her studio.  She has instructions and rules that are very straight forward and lots of info on local cuisine, activities and sites to see.  Others were right, Samantha does leave real ""half n' half"" in the frig to go with their wonderful coffee.  It was very clean and quiet.  Their yard is beautiful.  We loved the shower.  It was roomy and made of lovely tile.  What a unique little place, we will definitely stay again.  Always, Terri & Kelly West"
421168,4695758,2013-05-20,4996856,Lilu,"Lovely quiet place, very pretty inside. Samantha was a great host. I will stay there again."
421168,4750840,2013-05-23,2886970,Wray,"This is the second time Kate and I enjoyed the stay at Samantha's and Peter's Greenwood Studio private room.  As before, it was perfect.  Quiet, clean, comfortable and with a great shower!  Parking is easy on street.  Direction to it are simple.  For a stay in Seattle it cannot be beat.  We will return!"
421168,4876348,2013-05-30,2600611,Emily,"Samantha was very responsive through email and texts before and during the stay. She was very accommodating when I asked if there was a hair dryer and I had wifi problems. 

Parking is cake, the studio is very cute and the bed very comfy. There's even your own french press and hot water for coffee and tea that I really enjoyed!"
421168,4888318,2013-05-31,1006591,Kathryn,"Our (email hidden) Studio was a true joy!!!  Samantha has thought of every convenience &  all was organized beautifully.  Along with crisp linens, fresh fruit, French coffee press, a clean, sparkling space (it does look like an H&G reno), all our comforts were met.  We hope to return when time permits.  Kathryn/Jim  "
421168,5227229,2013-06-19,4880318,Carla,"The Greenwood Studio was a perfect location for our needs.  This house is located in a very quiet neighborhood,  Overall our stay was good, but it's just the teeniest bit cramped for two people.  This is a PERFECT place for a solo traveler."

The hosts are very welcoming and warm people. I found the beautiful guest book very helpful. It is full of useful information about the different neighborhoods and restaurants and activities. It led me to a great grocery store called PCC nearby which has very good fruits, sandwiches, etc. If we had more time we would have loved to do some of the hikes and other activities they recommend. 
Thanks Samantha and Peter!"
421168,5406622,2013-06-28,849342,Ann Marie,"Our stay at Samantha's house was delightful.  The place is really clean, and charming.  It is also so quiet, you hardly know that you are in the city.  The yard is beautiful and calm.  I would highly recommend this place!"

There were also delicious muffins left on the mini fridge!"
421168,5678699,2013-07-11,4933993,Alyssa,"Samantha and Peter's studio was the perfect home away from home. My husband and I stayed there for three days on vacation in Seattle. Samantha was very prompt in responding to inquires prior to our stay, scheduling an earlier check in time, and post stay - rating us as guests. The studio was even better than described! While we didn't take full advantage of it, the backyard is beautiful! Samantha created a beautiful book with information pertaining to the studio, neighborhoods in Seattle, suggestions for things to do and places to dine. Additionally, there were some extra touches that made our stay even better... homemade muffins and a french press with coffee and half and half. "
421168,5758688,2013-07-15,6321369,Joslyn,"The Greenwood studio was a wonderfully homey place to stay for three days. I loved that there was a French Press and tea kettle for morning beverages. The space was comfortable, clean, and private. "

It was just a short trip to downtown and ended up being pretty centrally located for getting to the ferry in Edmonds.  Sam, you have a wonderful place.  I will say that you are pretty much on your own, I was fine with that.  The only time I saw anyone was when I first arrived.  I didn't have any problems though, and I did have their numbers if I needed anything.  Very nice place to stay."
421168,6029835,2013-07-27,7263401,Merrill,"What a great first air b'n'b experience. Sam was a wonderful hostess, the place was lovely, and in a central location with good parking, nearby bus service, and excellent restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood is convenient for walking or jogging...we always felt safe. The desk library included lots of tips on things to do and places to eat (and bus schedules). The yard was pleasant and quiet for relaxing. The facilities were excellent (tasteful decor, comfy bed, great shower) and there was an added bonus...waking to the sound of the neighbor's fountain bubbling gently. We ran into Sam (literally) at the bus stop downtown and had a wonderful conversation all the way home. Couldn't have asked for a better 3-day experience!"
421168,6077670,2013-07-29,7118278,Christine,"My boyfriend and I stayed hear on our recent trip to Seattle. We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay hear again if we come to Seattle again.

Samantha and Peter were excellent hosts, and we sincerely appreciated the additional thoughtful touches both upon and within the mini-fridge! The space was exactly what we needed, not too big, not too small. It was nice to have a temporary home in a Seattle neighborhood that was more than just a generic hotel. The bus system was very easy to navigate for travel between the studio and downtown. We would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend this location to anyone staying in Seattle."

It suited us perfectly.  The neighborhood was also great and parking was easy!  
Samantha and Peter did a great job with building the studio, and with all of the finishing touches.  I love that everything they put in the studio was 2nd hand and had a story.  The handbook was really helpful, the French press was great, and the muffins were delicious!

421168,7488678,2013-09-22,8419930,Beth,"As my very first AirBnB experience, Greenwood Studio could not have been more perfect! This free-standing studio in the back garden is artfully appointed, spotlessly clean, restfully quiet, and comfortable! It was easy to find, and parking plentiful. I have traveled extensively for business, and always dread the sleeplessness and adjustment of hotel nights – even luxury hotels. I slept fabulously at Greenwood Studio! Samantha was kind enough to stock the mini fridge with fresh cream for the coffee and tea, and provide small snacks to tide me over. How kind! I highly recommend Greenwood Studios and the hospitality of  Samantha Orr. "
421168,7573114,2013-09-24,8800315,Hannah,Great stay. The studio was super clean and cosy. Very much enjoyed our time here. 
421168,7842570,2013-10-05,4393791,Suzie,"We were so impressed at the use of this 200sq. ft. hideaway! The use of space was amazing. Comfortable bed, great shower, all the niceties, including lemon shampoo/conditioner.
Thanks for being grand hosts and providing restaurant information plus directions for our Chelan trip! Would definitely stay again!"
421168,7898245,2013-10-07,8942517,Sj,"There is no fault to be found with the Greenwood Studio. Nothing has been spared in terms of quality, modern construction materials. It was a quiet reprieve, and I enjoyed it's proximity to Green Lake for a morning run. It does not have access to kitchen facilities, which I did realize, but the hosts provided lovely, big muffins and the capacity to make drinks along with a mini-fridge with OJ already inside (that was for me right? ;-) ). It suited me because I know Seattle, and like the residential area, but would be a little out of the way for the common, city-focused tourist or someone without a car. Overall, it was like renting a really cool fort for the night, and i hope to do it again."
421168,11204860,2014-03-24,997725,John And Jan,"Samantha was an excellent communicator, very welcoming and accommodating. The studio is beautifully and tastefully decorated in sage green and rust hues--very relaxing. The location was wonderful, about 15 minutes to downtown Seattle and the same distance to Edmonds, where we were attending a day of Rick Steves travel classes. No need to use the freeway either, so we avoided much traffic and had an easy commute to our southerly and northerly destinations. Strongly recommend Samantha as host and the studio as a great place to stay in the Seattle area."
421168,11383013,2014-03-31,6293862,Olivia,"I love this studio. It's very cozy and the bed was so comfy. It's perfect for our 2 days and 1 night trip to Seattle. Samantha is very nice and she even left muffins for us for the next day. I love how the studio has everything we need, small refrigerator, tv, dvd player, hair dryer, and it's very quiet. 

It's perfect for travelers who travel by cars. The studio is not far at all from N Aurora ave and there's a street parking spot. We will be back here again whenever we need a place to stay in Seattle. I can't recommend the studio + Samantha enough! Thank you!"
421168,11479961,2014-04-04,1559052,Maggie,"Needed a place at the last minute and found Sam's studio to be exactly what we needed: clean, comfortable and economical. Very close to Greenlake and right off of 99 for easy traveling. Good location if you have a rental car.  Communication and coordination was a breeze with Sam. Homemade muffins, coffee and juice provided too! Would definitely recommend the Greenwood studio. Thx for a nice stay!"
421168,11628787,2014-04-09,9521246,Benjamin,"The thing I remember the most about the neighborhood is the quiet. We had a very relaxing time at the studio after enjoying the hustle of the city. The address is easy to find and getting to different parts of the city was a breeze. Street parking was easy as well. The Studio is clean and well appointed, the bed is comfortable, the tiled shower and granite sink are nice. The skylight allowed for nice light in a small space and the internet was fast.  Despite being in the middle of construction of an addition on their house, the gardens and yard were kept in great condition and will soon be even better. Samantha and Peter thought of everything we needed and more. It was a really fantastic airbnb experience."
421168,12569068,2014-05-05,14300628,Madisen,"We had a wonderful stay at the Greenwood studio. The studio is charming, impeccable, and we felt right at home. Samantha was a flexible and gracious host, super easy to get in touch with.  Samantha’s husband was so friendly and showed me around the space. Coffee, juice, and muffins were a lifesaver after a long day of traveling and getting in late the night before. The location was perfect for jumping on some public transit to head downtown, and we were also able to easily navigate around in the car to go check out the greater Seattle area. I would absolutely recommend this studio to anyone, and we would love to return someday. Thank you Samantha ☺"
421168,12648776,2014-05-06,14338591,Gerriane,"We had an impromptu trip to Seattle and needed a place to stay. I sent Sam a message and she was very timely in her response! She answered every question I had and was able to accommodate our request on such short notice! 

Sam's studio is very clean and cute, perfect for 2! She had left muffins and orange juice in the fridge for the next day, and provided us with coffee and tea as well. We will definitely be booking our stay here the next time we are in Seattle! "
421168,12727065,2014-05-09,5610963,Ashley And Sophia,"Samantha was a great host she was  easy to communicate with and even let me check in super early. The studio was just as described and Samantha even had muffins and juice waiting for me, yummy!. The studio was very quite and comfortable and minutes away from the  freeway, so getting downtown was a breeze and parking was easy as there was plenty of street parking right in front of the house. Overall the studio is a great bargain!! "
421168,12912554,2014-05-13,15195134,Elena,"Samantha's cottage was clean, cozy and relaxing and private. The area is very quiet and we got a parking spot right in front of the house. Samantha was very accommodating and even left some delicious muffins, oj and good coffee for us to have in the morning. I really appreciate Samantha's pride of ownership, she is personable and professional and really treats this as a business making sure her guests have a excellent experience. I would definitely stay here again next time we visit Seattle."
421168,13052012,2014-05-18,7679810,Ed,"Samantha and Peter were amazing hosts! Place was comfortable, clean and convenient. Highly recommended to anyone visiting Seattle!"
421168,13120507,2014-05-19,15517621,Sandy,"Samantha's Greenwood Studio was perfect for me and my daughter.  It had everything we could have needed, and it was very clean, cozy, and comfortable!  I highly recommend this space and its host!  I'm sorry we didn't have time to linger in the morning and enjoy the coffee and the garden.  "
421168,13165607,2014-05-20,63815,Ruth,Fabulous location in a great neighborhood.  Cute and cosy...Just what I was looking for after a day in the city.
421168,13255318,2014-05-23,4220882,Vinodhan,"The location of the Greenwood Studio could not have been any better. It is a few minutes away (on foot) from the nearest bus stop, and the bus service there takes you to downtown Seattle in about 30 mins, and if you head in the other direction, it will take you to the transit centre (to see the rest of Seattle). Samantha is a great host and will give you ideas for an itinerary whilst in Seattle, as she had done when my pal and I stayed there. Samantha even makes her own bath soap that we used during our stay, and you will be greeted at the studio by muffins that she bakes too, along with some OJ. I definitely recommend staying at the Greenwood Studio, I wish I had stayed there longer and not spent the rest of my week in Seattle with my friend in a stinky college dorm room -_- "
421168,13371195,2014-05-26,1149493,Jitterbug,"This was the most adorable little cottage ever. I though we were going to actually be in a room that was attached to the rest of the house, but we actually had the cottage all to ourselves as it is a tiny little tucked away one bedroom, single bathroom bungalow. It was cozy, classy, and comfortable. The morning muffin/scones were delicious! Check in was simple and easy and Samantha and her husband were wonderful! Next time I'm in Seattle, I'd love to stay here again."
421168,13493718,2014-05-28,4131654,Brieana,"We truly enjoyed our stay in Samantha's backyard studio. Great use of space and very comfortable for my husband, myself and 4 month old. Very clean, orderly and welcoming. You can tell that they put a lot of care and thought into this space- with the intention of making their guests happy. I highly recommend this space both for its location and comfort. Samantha is a great host and we will definitely stay here again! "
421168,13760327,2014-06-03,9878863,Erika,"We loved Samantha's place. It was even better than we expected, bigger than it looks in the pics. Samantha took care of every detail, leaving us breakfast (muffins and OJ) and even little shampoo and conditioner bottles. She was very helpful giving us information about Seattle, and really nice in general. The place is awesome!"
421168,13924559,2014-06-08,15476748,Geoffrey,"Great backyard private studio, very confortable.
Samantha & Peter put a lot of care : muffin, orange juice, little shampoo & and a awesome scrapbooking guide !"
421168,14124482,2014-06-12,15429635,Sarah,"This was the perfect place for myself and a friend who traveled to Seattle for a few days.  The location was perfect, the studio clean and adorable.   Samantha and Peter's book of local neighborhoods and information was perfect and gave us some great tips about the city.   Samantha was incredibly responsive and helpful pre-trip and made sure we had all the information we needed.   Perfect first time Airbnb experience! "
421168,14198703,2014-06-14,12974408,Justine,"I stayed at Samantha's spot for my first visit to Seattle. She was a very accommodating host. My flight was delayed and we weren't able to get there when we initially planned, but Samantha had no problems with our change in schedule. The studio is neat and clean and just as described/ show in the picture. She left a great guide of the area, and muffins for us to enjoy. I would definitely stay there again if I visit Seattle in the future. "
421168,14253574,2014-06-15,12803918,Mareike,"After two weeks of camping we spend the last night of our trip at Samanthas little studio. We enjoyed our short stay at this pleasant clean and peaceful place in the backyard of her house. Cafés are in walking distance, the bus to the city center stopped right around the corner, so we could easily explore the city on our one (and only) afternoon in Seattle. Unfortunately we couldn´t meet Samantha as we arrived late and had to leave early in the morning - but communication with her ran easily via SMS. "
421168,14400435,2014-06-18,15493895,Erin,"The Greenwood studio was exactly what we were wanting: clean, cozy, and private. The French press coffee maker and snacks left by Sam were a big plus. The location is great too. We were able to walk to several bars, restaurants, and a grocery store all within about a mile.  Green Lake Park isn't too far either. A round trip run from the studio to the park and around the lake is 6 miles. To get to the main sight seeing spots around Seattle just get a car from Uber. We didn't think a rental car was necessary as some other guests have suggested.  

 I will stay here again next time I'm in Seattle and I absolutely recommend it. "
421168,14491640,2014-06-20,5152213,Autumn,"Samantha's place was very clean, cozy and beautiful. The little touches made the stay extra special like the specialty soaps and the amazing guest book she made. She was a very nice host and very professional. I would definitely book with her again. "
421168,14613812,2014-06-23,14902989,Cb,"Samantha and her husband were very pleasant from booking the room to extending our stay, checking us in, and seeing us off. The studio is very clean and modern, perfectly comfortable for a weekend visit. There were banana bread muffins and orange juice provided (both very nice amenities) as well as handmade soap and a complimentary hair dryer. I was pleased with the rental and recommend it to anyone who wants a relaxing place to stay in the big city."
421168,14882003,2014-06-28,16792624,Jason,"totally adorable little studio, gracious hosts that go the extra mile.  would love to stay again."
421168,14933501,2014-06-29,4413334,Eddy,"Greenwood studio was perfect for our stay in Seattle on the way to Olympic national park. It was clean, spacious, close to the freeway and easy to find. Sam was really quick to respond to any message and the muffins and orange juice she left in the mini fridge made a great breakfast the next morning!"
421168,15759276,2014-07-15,15577914,MB & James,"Charming and comfortable. Just as described. Great location. Quiet, clean, and cozy. Samantha is very gracious and friendly. We would stay again!"
421168,15871082,2014-07-17,6453973,Sharon,"The studio was just as expected, very nice and quiet. Samantha's husband met me right on time and showed me the studio. I was only there one night, but had a great night's sleep and a wonderful shower in the morning (did I mention the shower is fantastic?!). I would definitely recommend this spot if you plan to eat out most evenings, as there is no kitchen. It is close to Green Lake which is just lovely this time of year."
421168,15957991,2014-07-19,2696943,Kit,"A great place to get over jetlag! We arrived at Seatac from Paris, took a limo service to the car rental agency on Pine St, and drove up to the cottage, which was even nicer and cuter than I expected. We spent two nights there, and it was so quiet and relaxing and cool to just sit on the deck chairs and take in the Seattle sunshine and listen to the birds in the giant tree next door.  

Everything inside was very clean, especially the shower; the towels were thick and soft, and the tiny fridge was stocked for two days of breakfasts (which included yummy muffins among other things!!) 

Overall a great experience, and my first HAPPY Aribnb experience. "
421168,16086996,2014-07-22,15912675,Valerie,"This studio completely met our expectations. Samantha was very welcoming, and the description and pictures were very true to life - Right down to the muffins others mentioned in their reviews :-) We would definitely stay here again, and recommend Samantha and this neighborhood to others. "
421168,16238167,2014-07-23,17879312,Lauren,"The room itself was great. Spacious, private, clean, cozy. Comfortable bed. Samantha provided French press coffee, OJ, muffins, and tea :) unfortunately we are traveling without a car and the property was pretty far from downtown ($50 taxi- big mistake - taker uber car for half the price!!). Relatively close to Fremont and Ballard which are cool little towns. Avoid taking the bus to/from the property if you can, it gets a little seedy. As far as walkability goes, I'm not sure this is the best location for guests without cars looking for the best/ first time Seattle experience. But it's easy to get to with a taxi or uber car. "
421168,16271989,2014-07-24,16976892,G,The Greenwood studio is clean and neat retreat for a single person or a couple. It is located very close to Seattle downtown. Only around 15mins drive and you're at Pike place market. Samantha is a great host. She is very nice and responsive. Will definitely stay again when in town. 
421168,16323673,2014-07-25,3149986,Lauren,We had a great stay at this Greenwood studio. Samantha was a wonderful host and her muffins were delicious. (: It was a good size for two people and the bed was very comfortable.
421168,16581156,2014-07-29,18023644,Loti,"Samantha was a great host, being especially welcoming when we arrived rather late. She even had some yummy muffins and juice in the fridge for us.  I have difficulty walking and there was easy access through the back gate. The neighborhood was perfect for us, nice, quiet and close to a beautiful  park and some really good food. It provided a nice respite from the busy city. The studio has a wonderful walk-in shower and is very clean and simple. The bed ( a double?) turned out to be a bit small for the two of us, but we made do. We had difficulty with the Internet connection and couldn't get it to work, even though Sam gave us detailed written instructions, our devices never connected. She did warn us Macs needed some special care to hook-up, but we couldn't ever do it. She had some movies we could chose from, so we enjoyed watching a DVD instead. If an Internet connection is vital for your stay, I'm not sure I would recommend the studio, but if you like a clean, private place near lots of great stuff, at a very reasonable rate, this is the place!"
421168,16653050,2014-07-31,1541638,Jason,"Samantha and Peter's place is located in a quiet residential neighborhood.  Buses (Rapid E or #5) to downtown are just a 5 minute walk away.  The place is well appointed, clean, modern and perfect for 1-2 people.  I put my mother up here so that she would have some privacy while she visited us here in Seattle.  She loved it.  Samantha even stocked the place with some juice, freshly baked muffins and ground coffee for the French press.  I would definitely consider putting my family or friends up here again in the future."
421168,16735005,2014-08-01,17923696,Terrill,The place was great. Nice and cosy. The bathroom was beautiful. The house was easy to get to. Not far from downtown or public transportation. 
421168,16802188,2014-08-02,17946978,Rachael,"My husband and I really enjoyed our short stay in the Greenwood Studio. We stayed here for one night during our road trip and enjoyed every minute of it, we wished we could stay longer. I could tell a lot of detail was put into making our stay in the Greenwood Studio enjoyable from the delicious muffins left for us for breakfast, the refreshing bottles of orange juice, materials to make  coffee/tea, the studio guidelines and recommended nearby travel spots listed in a well-crafted scrapbook, homemade soap, comfortable bed, and pleasing/comfortable decor that I want to recreate in my own house. We got to meet Samantha's husband, who was delightful and very helpful and we found our communication prior to and during our trip very helpful with a quick response time.  We highly recommend staying here and really enjoyed being close to and just outside of the hustle and bustle of downtown Seattle."
421168,17070070,2014-08-06,6376133,Sam,"Everything was pleasant and what I expected,  very clean. Samantha was helpful, but respected my privacy. The banana muffins were delicious!"
421168,17124492,2014-08-07,18407516,Lisa,"Cute little back house. Even though our stay was short, our first Airbnb experience was wonderful thanks to Samantha. Place was nice, clean, and just what we were looking for. Definitely recommend this place to friends and family, for a short stay in Seattle!  Thanks Samantha!"
421168,17342194,2014-08-11,15492854,Megan,"Staying at the Greenwood Studio was perfect.  It was close to the city which made it easy to get downtown but just far enough away that it wasn't incredibly crowded.  Parking was easily found on the street.  Sam was great.  She was very kind and gave us great tips for places to eat while in Seattle.  She was flexible and I never had a hard time getting a hold of her.  The studio was the perfect size.  All we needed was a clean and cozy place to sleep with a bathroom and that's exactly what it was.  Sam also stocked the fridge with juice and muffins which was nice to have on the go.  When I make a trip back out to Seattle, I will definitely look at the Greenwood Studio availability."
421168,17506565,2014-08-13,12923793,Don,"Great neighborhood, good communication and easy check-in. Quiet and private. Easy off street parking (great for people with rental cars). I highly recommend this place! Cheers! "
421168,17586662,2014-08-14,19142272,Beth,"My stay at the cabin was short, but perfect for what we needed.  Although we didn't get to meet, Samantha was very responsive, helpful and welcoming. The bed was so comfortable. The shower was beatiful. I didn't get much of a sense of the neighborhood, but I would definitely consider staying in their little cabin on future trips!"
421168,17835713,2014-08-18,6985481,Sara,"Beautiful location, comfortable bed and great facilities (shower, towels, outdoor seating area, etc.).  We also enjoyed the muffins that were left for us and the lockbox was easy to use."
421168,18001967,2014-08-20,16445886,Heinz,"Es war ein sehr nettes Erlebnis. Das Häuschen im Garten war charmant. Es tat gut nach dem trubel in Seattle im ruhigen Garten zu sitzen. Das Zimmer war sauber, im Kühlschrank fand sich Orangensaft und Milch, es gab Muffins und Kaffee, wir fühlten uns sehr gut aufgehoben. Die jungen Gastgeber waren sehr freundlich und es fand sich ein liebevoll aufbereitetes Gästebuch mit nützlichen Tips. Empfehlenswert.
"
421168,18087834,2014-08-21,19794141,Joe,"The Greenwood Studio is really cute and located on a nice quiet street between Greenwood and Aurora. Samantha let me check in early as I had to get ready for a trip downtown to dinner. I chose to ride the bus from Aurora which was really easy. The location was perfect for that, accessible but quiet an very private. Very nice but short stay."
421168,18123439,2014-08-22,244900,Katerina,"Samantha's place was just perfect, the high ceiling make it very light and spacious, the unit was super clean, has everything you need. The neighborhood was quiet and safe. Wonderful, nice hosts. Two thumbs up, highly recommended. "
421168,18184383,2014-08-23,6694771,Ana,"Samantha´s welcome was warm and generous; she even gave us homemade raspberry banana muffins and orange juice. The place is wonderfully cozy, quiet, and has everything you need - you can even sit outside and enjoy the yard. It´s the perfect spot to relax after a busy day of touring beautiful Seattle! Thank you for the lovely stay, we actually wished we´d have booked it for more than just a night. "
421168,18385502,2014-08-25,15060638,Wil,"Samantha was a very friendly host. She made our stay really easy and comfortable. She had a great scrap book that she personally created that has great ideas of restaurants and local locations to visit. The studio was amazing, its like stay in your own quiet apartment. The location was great and just a quick drive to downtown. I know where exactly where to stay next time I go visit Seattle. Thank you Samantha ! "
421168,18478177,2014-08-27,12072201,Julia,"We loved Greenwood studio. So easy to find and get around town. The studio was cosy, and Samantha was a lovely host. The perfect spot for a private getaway."
421168,18554432,2014-08-28,18919990,Halley,"Greenwood studio is a gem. For an affordable price, you get total privacy, quiet, and all the amenities you need on a safe, nice block. Samantha is super awesome. She  gave us extremely helpful suggestions as to what to do in Seattle. She was there to answer any questions but we weren't in each other's hair during our stay. The cleanliness and attention to detail was pro level, and the back garden is a major plus. We rented a car, and found the entire city to be super accessible from there. It was a nice home base. We will definitely come back!"
421168,18874480,2014-09-02,15432050,Laurie,"Cozy, comfy, and a great, quiet location. Really enjoyed sitting outside and watching the hummingbirds while reading a book. Especially liked having a Safeway about a mile away... not to mention the amazing Red Mill Burgers a bit farther down Greenwood Ave (the nearby main street). Samantha was welcoming and makes a mean muffin! The separate building is perfect if you like a little more privacy."
421168,18960337,2014-09-03,4372246,Sree Divya,Samantha was very warm and communicative. The neighborhood was very safe and close to all interesting neighborhoods in Seattle. 
421168,19222866,2014-09-08,12431287,Mariah,"I booked Samantha's studio for my parents when they came to Seattle to help me move, and they had a great stay. Samantha was super nice at check-in, the area of Seattle was perfect for what we needed, and the house was easy to find. They loved that the studio was detached from the residence so they could have their ""own space"". The room itself was very clean with plenty of space and was well decorated. The bathroom also had plenty of space with a big shower. The room had everything they needed, and we would definitely book it again in the future."
421168,19298095,2014-09-09,12435288,Patrick,"I booked Samantha's studio for my parents while they were in town visiting. Samantha made the whole process very smooth and was easy to communicate with. The neighborhood is conveniently located and the studio is very charming and clean. Samantha met us at her house to show us around and even left homemade muffins on the table! My parents said everything they needed in the studio and appreciated how much thought had been put into all of the amenities. Overall, they had a great experience and would definitely recommend Samantha's studio."
421168,19365556,2014-09-11,18549863,Theodor,"Wir haben uns sogleich mit dem kleinen Häuschen angefreundet und 2 Nächte gut geschlafen. Samantha und ihr Mann waren sehr freundlich und zuvorkommend. Sie haben uns auch wertvolle Hilfe und Tipps für den Aufenthalt in Seattle gegeben. Können wir bestens weiterempfehlen.

421168,19425829,2014-09-12,20276108,Gray,We had a great time staying at the studio. Samantha was accommodating to our late arrival time and was available to answer all our questions. The muffins and juice were a plus!
421168,19762513,2014-09-17,11020498,Erin,Just one night but had a lovely stay! The neighborhood is quiet and close to good food. The studio has everything you need and was super clean and organized. Would have loved to stay longer. Highly recommend!
421168,19811247,2014-09-18,1390497,Phil,"Great little bungalow in the back of Samanthas house.  Easy check in, nice, clean, updated space.  If you are looking for a cute little spot to sleep, have coffee, and see the sites this may fit the bill for you."
421168,20242383,2014-09-26,8291395,Keitha,"We were only able to stay at the Greenwood Studio for one quick night, but we thoroughly enjoyed it! The space was really cute and had nice accommodations. Great location. The host left muffins! "
421168,20295963,2014-09-27,42305,Jaynne,"During my two brief encounters with Samantha she was distant and not very ""warm and fuzzy"" as we say.
The studio suite was well-equipped , comfortable and it was nice to have the privacy. It was good to have the rules written out and left on the desk so we did not have to bother the host."
421168,20425494,2014-09-29,15879951,BriAnn,This was our first time using AirBNB. Samantha's place was very comfortable and quiet. It was nice for us to have our own space and be able to come and go whenever we wanted without disturbing anyone. The muffins and orange juice were good too! Great experience!
421168,20633030,2014-10-02,21826373,Patrick,"Samantha and Peter have a great setup.  The studio was an excellent rental experience.  It was clean, quiet, and provided a fantastic sense of privacy.  The directions provided in the studio are direct and easy to follow.   I would definitely stay here again."
421168,20836265,2014-10-06,17348419,Lee Ann,"Description was very accurate.  It is a clean and comfortable little studio in a quiet neighborhood.  It was nice to have a private space where we could come and go without disturbing the hosts.  Communications were quick and easy.  The muffins and juice were a nice treat (I don't drink coffee), the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was wonderful. The only other thing that might be helpful for guests to know is that it takes quite a while for hot water to get to the studio.  (I didn't time it, but maybe 3 minutes.)  I would happily stay here again."
421168,25619281,2015-01-20,26073727,Noelle,"This was our first time using AirBnb and we couldn't be happier with our stay at the Greenwood Studio.  Samantha is a great host -- making the process easy and seamless.  The studio itself is nothing short of amazing!  Cozy and inviting, it was the perfect place to rest after our full days in Seattle.  The pictures are accurate, if anything the space was bigger than what we anticipated.  We can't say enough good things about this place and feel pretty lucky to have chosen it as our first stay.  We will definitely be back!"
421168,26581696,2015-02-15,17922141,Krissa,"Precious little studio in Seattle. I would absolutely stay here again. Great location, lovely neighborhood, wonderful privacy. Samantha had set out lovely little details to make my stay delightful. Thank you for a perfect place to rest!"
421168,27010683,2015-02-23,4996572,Bhavnoor Singh,The place was great and cozy. Its transit accessible and at a convenient location. Samantha is a great host.  
421168,27114258,2015-02-25,19806404,Tree,"Banana muffins?! They were a delicious welcome snack.
This little cabin was terrific. Easy to find, easy to get to and from via public transport, clean and comfy. 
And adorable. And decked with a binder full of local resources. And quiet. 
Thanks for the virtual hospitality - our paths didn't cross but we felt well tended nonetheless."
421168,27664046,2015-03-09,8763519,Elannah,"We had a lovely stay! The cottage was exactly as described: adorable, cozy, clean, modern, comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood and very friendly hosts. The banana muffins, orange juice and french press/ coffee were a lovely touch. Our hosts were very responsive, and readily available, though respectful of our privacy. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
421168,27896556,2015-03-14,28664415,William,"It was a perfect stay here!! Very comfortable. Plus, Samantha gave us banana bread! Very sweet. Will definitely recommend a stay here."
421168,28046804,2015-03-16,4131654,Brieana,"Another great stay at Samantha's little Greenwood Studio. When we come to Seattle for an overnight trip, this is our preferred place to stay. Great neighborhood, cozy studio and wonderful hosts!"
421168,28099143,2015-03-17,27545142,Rene,Samantha had a wonderfully cozy studio that provided us with plenty of options as to what there is to do. Highly recommended!
421168,28280164,2015-03-21,9453387,Colleen,"Samantha's place is private, clean and beautifully furnished. You'll enjoy every moment. Thanks, Samantha for a great place to stay!"
421168,28358915,2015-03-22,6754074,Kathleen,Lovely private cottage with everything you need for a perfect nights rest ! 
421168,28529311,2015-03-25,28315259,Christina,"Although we did not get to meet Samantha in person, my stay in her studio was wonderful. The place was cozy, quiet, and comfortable. She was quick to respond to messages, and very easy to communicate with. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a room near downtown Seattle. "
421168,28802973,2015-03-30,28243095,Rob,"One of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at. The studio was very neat and clean and equipped with almost any amenity you could need. It felt very private from the main house, yet the hosts were prompt and accommodating whenever we needed help with anything. The neighborhood is great, there was always available street parking, and the drive to downtown was always short - even during rush hour! 5/5 WOULD STAY AGAIN #blessed"
421168,29020698,2015-04-02,19662541,Ansuya,"I had a pleasant stay at the Greenwood studio. The studio, as described, is clean , comfortable and private.  I would stay here again."
421168,29300204,2015-04-06,28827609,Hailing,"Me and my best friend had a great stay in this (website hidden) was just like the pictures: clean ,cozy and close to everywhere . Samantha was very kind and thoughtful . "
421168,29526558,2015-04-08,24409591,Mary,Great little private place. Felt safe and snug.
421168,29615764,2015-04-10,28843840,Diana,"This little cottage was very comfortable, with everything we needed. Samantha's homemade muffins were yummy, and along with the French press coffee and orange juice, made a fine breakfast. The yard was very pretty, lots of springtime flowers. We didn't get to explore the neighborhood too much but it was nice; pretty and quiet. Lots of interesting shops and restaurants in the Greenwood area, and the hosts have a notebook of suggestions. They were very hospitable (even though we never met them face-to-face), they were helpful and considerate. Would stay here again. "
421168,29801991,2015-04-12,30712936,Matt,"Everything about this cute little place was as good or better than I expected.  Clean, cozy and comfortable.  The neighborhood was safe and convenient.  The owners were great about communicating.  Very thoughtful and prompt to respond.  Highly recommended!!!"
421168,29942824,2015-04-14,18689159,Elham,"A nice neighborhood and the room was very clean. Samantha left some muffins for breakfast which was nice of her,"
421168,30054834,2015-04-16,2095307,Paige,"We had a great short stay at the Greenwood Studio. We arrived late and tired, so having easy instructions on how to help ourselves into the studio was perfect. Samantha had left us homemade banana muffins, which were our dinner that night and breakfast the next morning. So thoughtful! Samantha was a great communicator the whole stay. The location was great for us and we were surprised how quiet it was given the house's proximity to convenient Aurora Ave. The studio was small but a good size for two of us for a short stay. And at less than $100 a night, it was a bargain in what can be a pricey city. Thanks Orr family!"
421168,30161816,2015-04-18,2893840,Will,"I had a very nice stay at the Greenwood Studio, it was just as described, clean and neat and Samantha was great in communicating with me re the reservation and directions."
421168,30571511,2015-04-24,14238632,Tom,"My Wife and I had an enjoyable stay in Samantha's Greenwood Studio. The space is private, cozy, and welcoming. Samantha and her husband were awesome hosts and responded quickly with any questions we had. The location within Seattle is fantastic, just a short walk down Greenwood gets you close to great restaurants, bars, breweries, and coffee shops. If we end up back in Seattle we will definitely be checking if this studio is available again!"
421168,30624623,2015-04-25,30244586,Deborah,"I enjoyed staying at this cute little cottage - beautifully decorated, quiet, in a nice neighborhood. My bed was so comfy! I didn't actually meet the hostess, Samantha, but she left a muffin and apple as a welcome gift. I would definitely stay there again!"
421168,30742914,2015-04-26,31730976,Tom,"We loved the studio. It is about the size of a regular small hotel room, but it is so private. It is siutated in the host's back yard. The neighborhood is fine and the access is very easy. The studio itself is charming and sweeky clean. It must be brand new or it is very well taken care of. The bed is smaller (a tick down from a queen) but very comfortable. The bath is beautiful with granite and tile. "
421168,30822202,2015-04-27,2063465,Jesse,"Samantha was very polite and responsive on all occasions.  The space was clean, pleasant and priced fairly.  We would love to book again if the need arises."
421168,30999884,2015-04-30,7558619,Megan,"Samantha's airbnb was great! The space was so clean, and comfortable. It's an remodeled/updated space with a nice modern bathroom and a comfy bed and a small little desk and food prep space. Even though it's a bit on the smaller side, the high ceilings and little sky light make the space seem open. I would gladly stay here again on my next trip to Seattle! It's very private, and location-wise super convenient to all the places we went in Seattle. We took the bus into downtown, and it was only a short walk. When we drove around the city, it was also super easy to access everything we needed. It's also walking distance to many things! Samantha has it set up so that you are very much independent. We were able to show up to check in later than planned after a last minute trip to Victoria, and Samantha was totally accommodating. It made our trip down to Seattle stress free!  "
421168,31391072,2015-05-04,21447670,Mario,"The space was great. It has everything one needs for a few day stay in Seattle. Unfortunately, I did not have the opportunity to meet Samantha, but she made everything seamless and easy. I would stay again. "
421168,31613557,2015-05-07,14301609,Diana,"If you are looking for a comfortable homely place to stay, this is your sport!  The studio is a great place to accommodate for one or two people.  It is described just as it is, was super clean, modern, and updated with a very pleasant decor.  

Working with Samantha was very easy by both email and text!  She even baked banana muffins that were left in my room, what a yummy and unexpected treat for breakfast.  I had a very late arrival and just a short stay of one night, it went very smoothly with check in/out with her instructions.  

There was a nice welcome board with my name in chalk that made my experience feel very personal.  The yard was also pleasing with nice landscape!  I was greeted in the morning with chirping birds, frolicking squirrels, and the fresh moist WA air.  

The unit has everything a similar sized hotel would, but has the privacy and charm of a little place like home.  I will definitely consider renting the unit again and highly recommend for any single or couple to stay!  "
421168,31961178,2015-05-12,30143789,Carol,"Our stay at the ""Greenwood studio""  was just what we were looking
for.   The studio is small, cozy and private.  It is situated in Sam and Peter's backyard.   We felt comfortable in the neighborhood and could park right in front of the house making it very easy to come and go while we visited our son in the city.   Sam and Peter and their little guy are a lovely little family.   They exude warmth and kindness.  Our stay was close to our son, comfortable and safe.  It was a quiet place to crash after walking and hiking all day.  "
421168,32153217,2015-05-14,10393605,Allison,Samantha's Greenwood studio was the perfect place to spend an evening.  The studio was lovely and included all of the thoughtful the amenities that make traveling more pleasant.  I would definitely recommend this place to others!
421168,32296804,2015-05-16,972677,Caroline,"Samantha's studio suite was the perfect pit-stop for our road trip. It was modern, clean, comfy and the perfect size for a couple. We only had one day in Seattle but wished we could have stayed longer at the studio. We loved exploring the nearby neighborhoods - Green Lake and Ballard. Highly recommended!"
421168,32364744,2015-05-17,31258133,Dana,"As other reviewers have stated, Samantha's studio is the perfect place to stay while in Portland. The studio is very comfortable and Samantha left nice welcoming touches throughout the space. The welcoming board made me smile and the muffins were perfect after my long journey. She is very detailed in her instructions which is very nice and there wasn't a moment where I was questioning what to do. She is also very prompt with her replies which I appreciated.  In addition, the recommendations she provided were spot on. I wish I could have stayed a few more nights at the studio and was sad to leave. By far the best Airbnb experience I have had and hope to be in town again so I can stay at her lovely place. "
421168,32678101,2015-05-20,7209977,Emmy,We had a great stay at Samantha's place. It is nice little cottage in a beautiful garden! Samantha and her partner werd both very nice people.
421168,32802379,2015-05-21,32025412,Shawn,"This place was really great! One of the best I've stayed at! Such a cozy studio, and the host provides so much friendly amenities to welcome and familiarize you to Seattle. Highly recommend. We'll be back next time we're in Seattle."
421168,32949115,2015-05-23,33437771,Anna,Very private clean room as described. The only thing missing was internet which was important as I just moved my daughter to the Seattle area and we had tons to do.  If that isn't a concern I would highly recommend. 
421168,33256485,2015-05-26,459958,Jeanne,We had a great time at Samantha's Greenwood studio. The garden is gorgeous and very quiet and peaceful. The studio is clean and modern and well arranged.  We spent a lot of time in Ballard and Fremont so it was a great location for those neighborhoods and downtown was a quick ride away too. We'd stay again!
421168,33409502,2015-05-27,32879653,Amber,"We didn't meet Samantha during our overnight stay because her studio is in the backyard and we could just access to it by the door next to her house. The studio was clean and everything was provided, including towels and shampoo. One thing to note is that somehow we couldn't join the wifi network on our phones so during our stayed we could only use our own data to browse Internet. I tried to text Samantha  but she slept early b/c of her little baby. But besides that, everything was wonderful. "
421168,33578475,2015-05-30,29244641,Stephanie,"The Greenwood Studio was exactly as described! It was perfect to come back to after a long day in the city.  The studio is just a couple short blocks away from the bus line into the city, which was very convenient. We really didn't need the wi-fi, but if you plan to rely on it heavily, it is very slow. P.S. My husband now wants a French Press since visiting your place :) Thank you Samantha!"
421168,33910243,2015-06-02,30353277,Bradford,My experience was a positive one. The neighborhood was quiet and nice. Parking is very easy. Samantha provided banana muffins and orange juice in the room upon arrival. I thought this was incredibly nice of her. They were delicious! 
421168,34146710,2015-06-05,6654803,Anna,"The studio was cute and comfortable. I liked that it felt very private despite being in the backyard. We didn't get a chance to meet Samantha, but she was readily accessible via text if we needed something, and little touches like the chalkboard greeting and banana muffins provided in the studio made us feel very welcome. The house manual is full of great information on things to do and places to eat all over Seattle.

We had a wonderful time and would totally stay here again!"
421168,34437189,2015-06-08,8223303,Claire,"Everything was as perfect as the site said it was, right down to the unexpected banana muffins and great orange juice - thanks so much!"
421168,34853777,2015-06-13,13740672,Phil,"The greenwood studio was clean and stocked with snacks and also tea and coffee. Internet and TV were available and the neighborhood was safe and quiet. I didn't interact much as I was out early and in late, but Peter responded immediately when I couldn't get the TV working and also fixed a small blip with the internet. No issues and I will go back if this is available. "
421168,35376068,2015-06-18,27922494,Roger,"The room was small but cosy. Cherries, OJ, granola bars and water were provided. The bath was easy to access with high toilet and low entrance to the shower. The day after arriving we met the owners and their child. Very nice setting in a neighborhood that is safe and comfortable. A queen size bed that was very soft and was easy to sleep in."
421168,35543188,2015-06-20,7807915,Ernie,"Samantha and her husband Peter were very inviting and helpful.  We found their studio very comfortable for our short two day visit to Seattle.  Access to the bus system (E-Line) was two blocks away.  We bused into the heart of Seattle to enjoy ball games, the fish market and downtown.  The cost was only $1 per senior each way.  When we travel to Seattle next time, we will be sure to stay at the Greenwood Studio."
421168,35810504,2015-06-22,3896491,Sarah,Lovely studio in a peaceful neighborhood. Clean and quiet. The process went very smoothly-- Samantha provided thorough instructions. Certainly recommended.
421168,35940414,2015-06-23,6795825,Becky,"Samantha was the perfect host even though I didn't get the chance to meet her in person due to my late arrival and early departure.  She provided me with detailed instructions for how to access to studio, which has a private entrance behind the main house.  Everything that I needed was provided, including a mini fridge and breakfast for the next morning (muffin and fruit).  The neighborhood is cute and parking is super easy.  The only downside is that the temperature inside the studio is extremely warm and humid, and had a faint musty smell.  I would recommend turning the dehumidifier on immediately to cool down the space.  It felt much more comfortable after about an hour or two and the odor was unnoticeable.  The place was very clean and was perfect for my needs.  "
421168,36703872,2015-06-30,34833748,Mistie,Such a great experience.  Both Samantha and her husband (I forgot his name) were home when we arrived and they were both so welcoming.  They had great recommendations for restaurants in their guide book as well as some they gave us.  It was a quiet and peaceful neighborhood just outside of the Fremont neighborhood which was awesome because we went specifically for a show in Fremont.  I will defiantly stay here again next time I visit Seattle.  
421168,36821946,2015-07-01,36173613,Jordan,They were amazing! They left us muffins and some orange juice! The bed was comfy and the neighbourhood felt safe as heck!
421168,36962780,2015-07-03,21602647,Frank,The place was exactly as we expected. Peter and Samantha were very accommodating and kind. I highly recommend their place
421168,37643776,2015-07-09,6820566,Theresa & Stephen,"Sam & Peter's studio was perfect for our stay. We were attending some classes at North Seattle College and were able to walk each day, so didn't require a car. There aren't so many close restaurants or grocery stores, but the neighborhood is close to the bus line and very quiet. Though small, the studio is very clean and the bed is comfortable and shower strong. We met Sam, Peter and Sam's mother briefly and they were all very sweet."
421168,37981769,2015-07-12,22485992,Lisa And Peter,"We booked the Greenwood Studio for a one night stay after camping in the San Juans.  Unfortunately there were ferry issues, so we didn't get to the studio until late at night.  The directions we received got us there easily, and we were greeted with a friendly welcome on the message board as soon as we entered the home.  It was quaint and exactly as listed!  This was our first Air Bnb stay, so we wanted something private vs. a room in a home.  This is a cute little place to stay, and we would definitely go back again.  We didn't get a chance to meet Samantha, but said a quick hello and thank you to Peter as he was doing home renovations.  Peter was friendly and asked about our stay before we had to rush off.  The location was also great for us because we wanted to go to University Village and Paseo's for shopping and yummy sandwiches before heading home."
421168,38101522,2015-07-13,3929212,Jeff,Fantastic. Great place. Decent location. Very private and relaxing. 
421168,38600782,2015-07-17,33437421,Laura,"This was such a perfect place for a little adventure. It was so nice for the price! When we arrived we found there were muffins, granola bars, and orange juice left for us! There was also a sweet sign welcoming us. I would totally return and recommend this room to anyone. "
421168,39491451,2015-07-24,32743297,Melissa,"Samantha and Peter were excellent hosts who made me feel welcome by leaving fresh banana bread, fruit and other snacks for me to enjoy.  I had the opportunity to speak with both Samantha and Peter while I was there, and they were extremely nice!  The neighborhood is safe, and Greenwood is a lovely area of Seattle to explore.  The studio is just a short walk from the shops, coffee shops and a grocery store on Greenwood Ave.  The #5 bus on Greenwood Ave. takes you directly into the city.  The hosts left a booklet filled with suggestions for activities and restaurants.  The studio itself was clean, well-equipped, and had a very comfortable bed.  I enjoyed having coffee outside on the patio in the mornings. Greenwood studio is the perfect place for close couples or those traveling solo."
421168,39615426,2015-07-25,28712663,James,The studio was inviting and clean. Hosts provided muffins and juice for the morning which was appreciated. Great neighborhood that's close to many restaurants and downtown.
421168,40315645,2015-07-30,31917952,Jay,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Greenwood Studio.  Our hosts provided a clean, comfortable and quiet place for us to rest while visiting our son nearby.  We especially relished the muffins, outdoor garden and cozy feel.  If you are looking for a place of respite and solace, this is it!  We give our ""thumbs up"" and would gladly stay a second time.

Jay & Monica Kroft"
421168,40434946,2015-07-31,31346041,Mathew,"Samantha and Peter where great hosts. We arrived to a lovely welcome note on the chalkboard. They also left out coffee, muffins and juice for us.  Very nice people.

The studio itself was well appointed, clean, and very comfortable. Not huge by any means, but just right for two people looking for a nice quite place to stay. It was just perfect. Not far from town at all and just far enough away to feel relaxing. "
421168,41076219,2015-08-04,33466553,Sue,"We felt this was a ""winner"" right from the beginning with our request and exchanging of emails.  Samantha and Peter made us feel very welcome in their private backyard studio apartment. There was a welcome message on a board right as we came in the door.  Homemade fresh muffins, bottled orange juice, granola bars, and apples were awaiting us.  There is a small hotel sized refrigerator in the room that was nice for keeping small things cold.  Wi-fi worked great.  Neighborhood was nice and quiet.  We were able to come and go at all hours and this was perfect.  Would stay here again!"
421168,42831291,2015-08-16,14845313,Deborah,"Samantha and Peter were great hosts. The space was exactly as described and worked well for my needs. 
Thanks, Deb"
421168,43617147,2015-08-21,13416216,Megan,"Greenwood studio was the perfect little place for us! The room was comfortable and exactly as pictured/described. There was juice and muffins left for us, and a cute little welcome sign! Peter was awesome (we didn't have a change to meet Samantha), he gave us suggestions of where to go, and checked in on us every day. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
421168,43960571,2015-08-23,37862827,Amber,"Our stay at the Greenwood Studio was amazing! I was blown away at how beautifully Samantha had the place decorated. It was an exact match to my taste, right down to the Venezia poster on the wall.

The studio was clean, bright, and very spacious. The bed was perfect for my husband and me and the location was walking distance to a local bar that had live music and stiff drinks. 

We would definitely recommend this place to anyone who may be visiting Seattle as it was not only a good deal but also, Peter and Samantha were gracious hosts.

Thanks!"
421168,44536658,2015-08-27,24115340,Wilma,Lovely stay at Greenwood Studio.  Easy parking.   Clear instructions and resource book available.  Friendly greeting from Peter.  Would consider staying again if we went to Seattle.  More than expected.   The Doanes
421168,45255209,2015-09-01,36064852,Diana,"I loved that the place had private access with a code (vs key to lose track of). I was pretty active while there and it was great to not disturb the owners.  There were fresh muffins and orange juice there for me.  It was clean and essentials were provided. Has a tv, refrigerator, coffee, tea, a fan, wife, and even a hair dryer.  I have zero complaints!"
421168,47378126,2015-09-18,30091560,Elise,"Great studio, excellent info provided in folder from the hosts, and everything was as expected.  We would happily stay here again.  There was a small mix up about arrival and Samantha was extremely quick to respond, fixing the situation.  "
421168,48215654,2015-09-24,43537485,Lisa,We had open communication from the very begin. There was quick response with emails. The description of the accommodations was accurate. The neighbor was quite. A pleasant surprise of orange juice and muffins was waiting for us. We will be returning the next time we are in Seattle. :)
421168,49489696,2015-10-04,43717130,Martha,"We did not meet  Samantha and Peter as  our  guests could only  stay for one day, but they were  welcoming and helpful on email  prior to  check in. They made check in  easy.The Studio is  cozy and the back yard is lovely.The neighborhood is convenient and  very  quiet. Parking was available in front of their house. We would love to have other  out of town guests stay with them in the  future."
421168,49976615,2015-10-08,33220935,Shea,"This was a great spot for my husband and I to spend a few days while exploring Seattle. The unit was adorable and very clean. There were muffins, coffee and juice waiting for us to help our first morning get off to a great start. The neighborhood was safe to leave our rental car while we explored public transportation which was very accessible from this location.  We were here during the week so understandably due to the hosts work schedules we didn't have a chance to meet them although we would have liked to. I can't say enough about the space, we will certainly recommend to others. "
421168,50286353,2015-10-11,24589123,Glen,"One of our best Airbnb experiences ever; hosts like Samantha and Peter are why Airbnb works, and why we will never go to hotels again. 
Timely communications,  well appointed, with well thought out and executed written information in the room, plus a fair price, all made this stay a pleasure. 
The cottage itself was perfect for the two of us, with convenient private access, a roomy shower, comfy bed, TV, small fridge and good lighting. We have already booked another stay when we're back in Seattle next week."
421168,51043078,2015-10-17,3178268,Jami,"A great place to stay! Exactly as described, kind communication, great neighborhood. The studio is great for a close couple. Convenient to some really great spots to eat."
421168,51280661,2015-10-19,24589123,Glen,"Second time staying with Samantha and Peter, great stay, hope to return! Greenwood cottage was perfect for our needs. Highly recomnended!"
421168,51565114,2015-10-21,44127983,Brynne,"By the time we got into Seattle we were tired and went straight to bed the Room was exactly as advertised, very clean the restroom was nice the bed was comfortable, they had two muffins on a plate for us to enjoy which we did. They wrote our names on a dry erase board which welcomed us to the room. We only stayed one night but it was perfect, we left early the next day so we didn't have a chance to need our hosts."
421168,52053112,2015-10-26,40958695,Ashley,"Samantha and Peter were born to host Airbnb. Our experience at their house was the definition of what we expected. Very informative, organized, and private. Beautiful neighborhood and the perfect distance from downtown. They provided everything we would need for our stay in Seattle."
421168,52557019,2015-10-30,7293467,Hisham,"Nice clean place, cute too.
We has the door pass code so was convenient (no keys required).

Had coffee/snaknbars/juice  which is a nice touch.

Clean bathroom, lively place.

We used our GPS so no issues arriving at location.

Easy parking and overall a great place to stay at."
421168,53011062,2015-11-03,41088571,Aaron,"Wife and I stayed here for a weekend trip to Seattle. Overall experience was great! Studio is very private, very clean and well organized. We briefly met Peter while we were heading out one morning but didn't have a chance to meet Samantha.

Samantha managed all the communications and did a great job of making us feel welcome while we stayed there. Highly recommend and would stay again."
421168,53600084,2015-11-10,33466553,Sue,"This was our second visit to the Greenwood Studio.  Everything was great, just as it was the first time.  There was a personalized welcome message on the board just inside the door.  The fridge was stocked with juice and there were other snacks.  Very clean and perfect for our needs.  We had a late arrival and were able to come and go freely at all hours.  This studio is just a few blocks from our daughter and her family in the Greenwood area and we are happy to have found this little gem."
421168,53856373,2015-11-13,15906426,Melissa,"The studio was perfect for my trip. It's a minimalist set up, but the bed was very comfortable, pillows were great, and Samantha and Peter had thought of everything I needed. "
421168,54140069,2015-11-16,18339648,Karina,"Samantha and Peter were great from the beginning when I had questions about booking the room. Their consistency in communications was excellent and made my friend and I feel more comfortable. The studio was grea as well. Perfect size for two. It was a chilly weekend when my friend and I visited seattle, but they studio heated up quickly which was great. I would definitely recommend staying here!"
421168,54866442,2015-11-25,21357927,Stephen,"The accommodations were very much as described, comfortable and private.  We arrived rather late on a Saturday evening and had no difficulty finding our way in. Overall, a very nice place to stay, well located for the purpose of the visit, visiting our son in near-=by Greenwood."
421168,55915452,2015-12-07,46982128,Bill & Marilyn,We arrived after dark but everything was set up as described.  The room is neat and clean.  Gold's Gym is 2 blocks away and Starbucks is nearby so the location was excellent for our needs. We liked the privacy and quiet.
421168,56827223,2015-12-18,3079488,Leif,"I unfortunately was unable to meet Samantha and Peter, due to my schedule, but they were quick to contact me and let me know that they were available if I had any questions. A+ people in my book. I will definitely stay here again if I have to do another renovation on my place! "
3385421,16122911,2014-07-22,17303976,Michelle,"The unit was clean and spacious- Ken really made the check-in/check-out process smooth. The condo was comfortable, the amenities were great, and the centralized downtown distance and being right across from the Pike Place Market made it all the more worth it!"
3385421,16672065,2014-07-31,17570690,Ben,"Wonderful experience with Ken's place in Seattle. Getting checked in and out was extremely straightforward, and the location was fantastic. The condo itself was immaculate and well appointed, and I certainly appreciated the fantastic views. Overall a great place and well worth it."
3385421,16786606,2014-08-02,5538655,Justin,"What an incredible place this was!  We had a great time and soaked in the beautiful views - day and night - as much as we could.  The place is luxurious and comfortable.

Each room was spacious, and the bathrooms were immaculate.

An even better place than the story the pictures tell.  Hoping to stay here more often as I continue to visit Seattle."
3385421,17184711,2014-08-08,18499859,Terri,"What a magnificent experience! This was our first trip to Seattle, and now we are completely spoiled. The accommodation descriptions were not accurate, because it is difficult to accurately describe how stunning and comfortable this condo truly is, even with pictures. The location is perfect, and unless you need to travel outside of the city, there is no need for a car. The train from the airport deposits you just a few blocks away. Ken was immediately responsive to any inquiries from beginning to end. Overall, we couldn't be more pleased. Looking forward to a return visit."
3385421,17471812,2014-08-12,13086279,Tom,"Magnificent condo!  Ken is very professional.  The location can not be beat, and the condo is 100% luxury.  You will not be disappointed. 

I agree with other reviews ...it is difficult to accurately describe how nice Ken's condo is with 1 or 2 brief sentences, or even with a few photos.  Everything is high end, and the view from his large balcony is simply amazing. 

I'll definitely stay here for future visits to Seattle."
3385421,17701793,2014-08-16,5467305,Kate,"Our stay at this property was fantastic from top to bottom. This is a great location, the four of us could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The condo is very luxurious. It was great to have dinner (with fish purchased from Pike Place) and look out over the Seattle harbour. Ken was very welcoming and easy to get ahold of if we needed, and he provided us with everything we needed to make our stay an enjoyable one. I would not hesitate to request this property again - but hopefully next time I win the coin toss for the master bedroom!"
3385421,17870201,2014-08-18,19072068,Jeff,ken made me feel at home. the place is clean and beautiful. amazing views. easy communication also
3385421,18331211,2014-08-25,18404787,Peter,"Incredible spot.  So close to all the fun stuff in Seattle, beautiful views and very neicely appointed luxury 2 bdrm. Host was helpful and communicated quickly."
3385421,18908030,2014-09-02,16085996,Trevor & Rose,"The photos and description do not provide this place justice. The view is breathtaking, the accommodations are luxurious, and the location is top notch. Groceries/shops, tourist attractions, and the convention centre are all within a completely reasonable walking distance. You will not find a better place to stay in downtown Seattle, and Ken is an absolute treat to talk with, should you have any questions during your stay."
3385421,28093557,2015-03-17,28436372,Sara,"This place was phenomenal.  Great communication before, during, and after the rental period with both Ken and his assistant.  The place is exactly as represented:  upscale furnishings, nice beds and linens, very nice building and an excellent location.  The pictures of the view almost don't do it justice.  The view and location is absolutely top-notch.  No issues at all.  We would love to return again when we make it back to Seattle."
3385421,28352421,2015-03-22,29054281,Kiran,"We had a fantastic weekend getaway at Ken's Triple Venti! Stunning views, well appointed furnishings with an exceptional master bath, all in the perfect location to explore the best of Seattle. Excellent value as well. Parking is a bit of a pain and quite expensive but it's a just a minor issue. Would be pleased to stay here again and again!"
3385421,28650059,2015-03-28,11508299,Kimberly,"Amazing apartment with stunning views. The bathrooms are gorgeous, the kitchen is great and the building is super nice. We felt like we were living in pure luxury! Thank you Ken for the fabulous home! We were sad to leave. "
3385421,29502504,2015-04-08,27991742,Ryan,As stated in other reviews the condo and location are superb! Condo is well maintained with high end fixtures.! Couldn't ask for a better space!!
3385421,29778512,2015-04-12,10360670,Joshua,This luxury condo is amazing.  It is extremely spacious and upgraded.  And the views are breathtaking.  The location is perfect -- mere steps from Pike Place Market.  A short walk to the Space Needle.  It is hard to imagine a better place to stay in Seattle.  And Ken and his assistant Molly were a pleasure to coordinate with.  Overall wonderful experience.
3385421,30113755,2015-04-17,17637,Christopher,"This is THE place to stay!  The view alone is so breathtaking you wont want to leave the unit.  One block from Pike Market.  A short walk to some of the best restaurants and cocktail bars in the city!

Clean luxury unit with AMAZING views!

Ken is also a call away for anything!  Great host."
3385421,30271397,2015-04-19,17637,Christopher,"Ken is great!  Very Clear communicator - everything was seamless.  The place is amazing: two huge bedrooms, two huge bathrooms, the most spectacular view, amazing location.  Must be one of the best places to stay in Seattle!

THIS HOME IS A MUST!"
3385421,31828793,2015-05-10,15787065,Brad,"Ken's condo is truly a perfect spot that is located within walking distance of many of the popular attractions.  It was really easy to ride the train from the airport to the downtown stop under Macy's and walk two blocks, that was a nice perk!   Condo has terrific views better than pictures can show online and the clean and updated interior made our visit better than we could of expected.  If we return to Seattle again this is the place."
3385421,33428167,2015-05-28,27429365,H.B.,This listing is more than advertised.  There could be no better location in the city.  The condo seemed something out of a television set.  It is a magical convergence of location and setting.  Would love to be able to visit again.
3385421,33906617,2015-06-02,29735965,Doug,"We absolutely loved our Stay at Triple Venti. The place was very clean, well appointed, fantastic views and close to so many things.  We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to others."
3385421,34493439,2015-06-08,8119514,Erin,"The apartment is absolutely stunning. The views cannot be beat and the location is central to everything. With pike market less than a 3-minute walk, you will be able to walk and explore everything. Recommend not bringing a car because parking in the neighborhood is all metered. This is definitely THE BEST spot to book in Seattle. "
3385421,34952765,2015-06-14,14137813,Patrick,Beautiful rental for the weekend.  Location was amazing and close to many of the big attractions in Seattle.  Ken was very hospitable and well organized which made our stay very easy to coordinate.
3385421,35239995,2015-06-16,2610097,Heather,"Everything was super easy and the apartment is as great as it looks in the listing.  The views are amazing, as are all the amenities.  Everything was clean and comfortable.  As a bonus, the Master Bath gave us some critical remodeling ideas for our own home.  "
3385421,36360030,2015-06-28,7633711,Pam,"We stayed at this beautiful apartment for 4 nights and enjoyed it very much.  The apartment itself is well appointed in a perfect location 1 block from Pike Place Market in the middle of downtown so we walked everywhere!  The place is very nice, beautiful furniture, granite counter tops, state of the art lighting system.  Nice TV in the main room and master BR and the master bath was spectacular.  There were two couples and we were attending a conference so the place was a little less than if we had rent ""conference rate"" hotel rooms.  We would sit out at night and just watch the activity in the harbor and soak in the city.  The assistant to oversees the apartment was very helpful, we could get in one day because the door lock is hard to operate and she arrived in minutes.  All of our questions were answered promptly.  Beautiful apartment and feel like a luxurious vacation getaway!"
3385421,36944346,2015-07-03,3000795,Grant And Lauren,"Ken's place is beautiful and exactly as described - luxurious, immaculate and amazing views. The apartment is appointed with everything you could need. The four of us were very comfortable here during our 2-night stay. Many of Seattle's must see places are steps from the building - Pikes Place, Space Needle, Chihuly Museum, great bars, coffee shops, restaurants, etc. Ken is very easy to deal with. The check-in/checkout process was a breeze. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it highly to anyone visiting Seattle."
3385421,37803982,2015-07-10,37373273,Aaron,Arguably the only downside of staying at Ken's beautiful condo is that the view is difficult to top. We were actually underwhelmed by the view from the Space Needle after spending a few days at Triple Venti. It is also the perfect location for exploring the city. Thank you for the opportunity to stay in your home.
3385421,38276537,2015-07-14,33609853,LynnErin,"Ken provided good, clear communication regarding the location and any specific questions we had. He was consistently quick in getting back to us both with booking & answering questions. 

Triple Venti View was outstanding!  The property was as pictured or better. The views were fabulous and the location was perfect for our family of four to explore Seattle. We walked to the market, space needle/Chihuly exhibit, a Mariners' game, shopping and of course great food & coffee. No need for a car!  Thank you for sharing your space--a real bonus for our time in Seattle. "
3385421,38609672,2015-07-17,477170,Lorissa,Best vacation ever.  Ken's place was so cool and amazing.  The view was unbelievable and everything was top notch in the condo.  The area was perfect for exploring Seattle.  Just steps from Pike Place and many great restaurants and bars.  Also near the ferries and rail to get around.  It was very easy to check in and out and I would definitely stay there again.  
3385421,39783354,2015-07-26,35829049,Teresa,"From the first inquiry to our last afternoon in the apartment, Ken was gracious and responsive.  The location of the apartment is amazing.  Each morning, we walked down to the market for crumpets, Ellenos Greek yogurt, and fresh fruit, then we enjoyed it all in the apartment while we took in the amazing view.  During the day, everything we wanted to do or see was within walking distance or within a short Uber ride.  It's hard to imagine a better location or an easier person to work with."
3385421,40927820,2015-08-03,6116089,Rita,"Ken's condo is perfectly located for exploring seattle.  when we finally tore ourselves away from the view, we walked everywhere!
checkin was punctual and easy to coordinate.  the condo is beautifully appointed and morning coffee from our view deck, watching the ferries come and go, is a quintessential seattle experience.
thank you ken for sharing your beautiful home with us!"
3385421,41735539,2015-08-09,12160363,Harshith,"Ken and his assistant Molly did a great job taking care of my party of 4. The apartment was awesome, comfortavle and conveniently located to wherever we needed to go. The view was fantastic and we wish we could stay longer. No complaints."
3385421,43038260,2015-08-17,33404055,Steven And Tat,"We were promptly and warmly welcomed by Ken's lovely assistant Molly . The apartment is perfectly located a block from Pike's Market and all of downtown. Easy walking distance to Pioneer Square, the aquarium and other local attractions. The view you see in Ken's photos is the one you will see from the apartment. Stunning views of the water, the Ferris Wheel and Mt. Rainier in the distance. 
The apartment is large and comfortable and fully furnished and equipped. We felt very much at home and you will too. "
6517594,35957171,2015-06-23,34218735,Jenny,"Jonny did a great job of preparing us for our trip, and then made himself available by phone during our stay to answer questions, etc. He was a great host.

Jonny's apartment was very nice, and in a great location.  We were able to easily walk to restaurants, shops, Pike's Market, and the waterfront.  As a bonus, the roof top terrace at Jonny's building was fabulous.  We decided to cook out on the roof two of the nights we stayed there (they have a public grille available).  The view was spectacular, and there was plenty of seating.

I would highly recommend Jonny's apartment as an option if you are traveling to the Seattle area.

We would definitely stay there on our next trip"
8374102,47929691,2015-09-21,10472617,Monica,Roda had a very easy and efficient self-check in. She responded fast to my questions and helped us to make a reservation the same day. The place was clean and as it looked at the pics. Me and my boyfriend stayed at Rodas for two night and were satisfied with the experience. 
8374102,48619439,2015-09-27,21369825,Chris,"The apartment was in excellent condition, and there were all the amenities I expected. It was very clean, and I was able to use it both as a work space as well as a sleeping space (I was in Seattle on a work trip)."
8374102,49521807,2015-10-04,43455380,Sourish,"Roda's place was in a good location, very clean and spacious apartment. Communication was effective and basic necessities were provided. Thanks for the stay - till next time!"
8374102,49964558,2015-10-07,4457511,Melody,"Roda's description of the apartment was spot on!  Not only was it clean and very centrally located, but I was able to check in late due to work scheduling and my baggage claim debacle.  Otherwise she was extremely quick in her directions and response to my booking.  I literally booked this on wifi on my flight into Sea-Tac and had a confirmation before I landed.  The apartment is just a 5-10 minute walk from the space needle and if your good for a jog you can easily take a nice jog into downtown/pike market.  Or you can take the monorail from the space needle for $4.50 roundtrip! Not bad at all. Overall the place was fully equipped and Roda was a sweetheart in communicating with me.  I would definitely book again next time I'm in town!!  Thank you Roda!"
8374102,57269024,2015-12-23,18849023,Dat,Roda made using airbnb a seamless experience that was very enjoyable. She responds fast and made sure we had everything we need. The location was great and the interior was very modern despite the buildings exterior. Would definitely book this place again if I were to visit Seattle again in the future. 
7860837,55495240,2015-12-01,49348463,Julia,"The Carriage House was the perfect answer to our stay in the Seattle area. It looks exactly as it does in the photos... clean, nicely-appointed and comfortable. What you can't see is how private and quiet it is. To have the use of the fully-furnished kitchen came in very handy for making some Thanksgiving desserts which wouldn't have been entirely successful had Meeka not graciously allowed me the use of one of her rolling pins!

Their home is located adjacent to a Seattle Parks trail and is within a short drive of I-5 with easy on and off access. We didn't have time to take advantage of the local eateries, but some of the reviewed restaurants sounded appealing. A coffee shop is within walking distance. Ballard is a short drive away and has many fun shops and restaurants.

We look forward to staying here again!

"
7860837,56395609,2015-12-13,39172677,Ruoxi,A wonderful house！Meeka is really sweet and nice！
7860837,57252235,2015-12-23,39261992,Alison,"I had a pleasant and relaxing stay at Meeka's one bedroom carriage house.  It was comfortable, clean, nicely decorated and near the Llandover Woods.   I especially appreciated the binder with helpful information and fully stocked kitchen, not to mention Christmas 
Tree and Lebkuchen!"
7860837,58736511,2016-01-03,52723379,Xavi,"Absolutely loved the carriage home. It was clean, well lit, perfect for two, and felt more then welcomed and had all the acomidations needed. They are great hosts and will definitely be staying here many more times when we visit. Again, all I can say is it was perfect and the house was just magnificent. Loved, loved, loved it. You won't find anything better."
7859909,43471362,2015-08-19,41942771,Warren,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7859909,43864624,2015-08-22,41555762,Simon,The host was extremely friendly and the space was very clean and had all the ammenities we needed. It was a good location that was close to all the areas we wanted to visit. My only minor complaint was that the walls were pretty thin so you could hear alot of what was going on in other parts of the building.
7859909,44364042,2015-08-25,1521727,Fabienne,"Nous sommes un couple de quinquas ayant passé trois nuits chez Andrew et Angela. L'appartement est comme sur la photo, moderne et impeccable. Le salon n'a que deux fenêtres-soupirail donc il faut tout le temps la lumière.
Andrew et Angela habitent au-dessus et sont extrêmement disponibles. Ils ont apporté ou acheté ce que nous demandions dans l'heure, la kitchenette étant à l'époque vide. 
Le quartier est très agréable, calme et familial et on peut facilement s'y garer. Le Bay Front est à moins de 15 mn de voiture.
Consulter (website hidden) pour se garer en centre-ville. Il y a des tarifs intéressants le week-end. "
7859909,44730516,2015-08-28,15061139,Kelly,Great little mother-in-law apartment with lovely hosts.  We enjoyed our stay!
7859909,45545011,2015-09-03,1705599,Johnny,"The best night sleep I've had while traveling- this place is private, modern, clean, convenient with great hosts. Great price for the location and I would stay here again!"
7859909,46521334,2015-09-11,29916174,Molly,Super clean spot with a comfy bed to rest your weary bones after hiking around Seattle. Quiet neighborhood with easy access to everything we wanted. Great spot!
7859909,46755002,2015-09-13,3632113,Simon,"Andrew was a great host. Super lovely guy. Getting in was super easy as his wife was there to let us in. 
Really lovely apartment. It really had all the things you needed to just chill after being out all day and sleeping. Nothing fancy but very functional. 
Only negative honestly was the bed was a little hard for our taste and unfortunately if you are a light sleeper and sleep really early you may find it a little noisy as the walls are a bit thin. 
Overall it was a nice place to stay and would consider staying again if we couldn't get something closer to the downtown area (as its a bit of a walk however it's only a $7 uber ride away)"
7859909,46947480,2015-09-14,6130327,Corey,"Our host Andrew was very professional and welcoming. Quick to respond to messages & a clear communicator. Andrew's space was clean, modern & perfect for our stay in Seattle. I'd highly recommend this Airbnb spot... as I'd gladly stay again on my next trip to Seattle. 

It was a 10 minute taxi ride to SafeCo Field, which works very well if you're in town for a Mariners or Seahawks game like we were. 

Thanks! "
7859909,47868020,2015-09-21,21708084,O'Neil,"Andrew's place was amazing! My girlfriend and i are so happy we found it! The space is clean! Modern and everything it advertises! We stayed for 3 nights! And we recommend it! Anybody considering staying here should! It's about 10 minute me drive to downtown, I believe a short walk and a bus ride takes you downtown as well! It's also really close to Capitol Hill! Where you can choose from a bunch of different spots to eat and bars to go to! Although the rental is attached to Andrews actually home, you'll never hear from him unless you want to! It's a very private spot, very quiet, in what seems like a very friendly neighborhood! There's was only one problem with our stay.... 
And that was the fact that we didn't meet Andrews corgi snackerdoodle sooner! He's absolutely the cutest thing! And you'll hear him running around upstairs occasionally! 
We asked Andrew if we could meet
Home and chat for a little and he was extremely friendly! Brought his dog out for us to meet (he was full of energy!) and chatted with us for a little bit and recommended some awesome places for us to go while we were in Seattle! Andrew typically responds in about an hour.. It was great! We will definitely stay again! "
7859909,50347733,2015-10-11,41416355,Liz,"We only stayed one night, but it suited our needs well. Andrew was very nice and great at communicating with us. Their corgi was really cute too. It may be a bit removed from downtown if you're looking for that experience, but we used uber to get to a restaurant for dinner and walked to a great nearby coffee shop in the morning."
7859909,50646226,2015-10-13,43043216,Jill,"Andrew met us with the key to this lovely apartment, and made us feel very welcome.  The townhouse is exactly as advertised, and was very comfortable.  The location was just perfect for us, and we were able to visit a nearby restaurant recommended in the guidebook and drive all over Seattle from a great central site.  I would definitely recommend Andrew's townhouse to anyone looking for a good, safe close-to-everything location."
7859909,51461441,2015-10-20,22609920,Carrie,"Andrew's place was exactly what I was expecting. Clean, comfortable and convenient. Not exactly walking distance to downtown but still only a quick uber ride away. Easy access to and from the airport. Andrew was very welcoming and Snackers (their dog) gave a very enthusiastic hello! Other than the occasional footsteps, I hardly knew they were there! Was a little disappointed there wasn't some kind of coffee maker but in Seattle, there is no shortage of cafes! "
7859909,54139951,2015-11-16,18348384,Timothy,"The ""entire home/apt"" is the lowest floor of what appears to be a three-story condo. Which is completely fine and is quite nice actually except the soundproofing is minimal and you can hear all the footsteps and chatter from above. 

The entire unit could have been cleaner. The bathroom floors had a lot of hair when we first arrived and the place was dusty enough to get my clothes noticeably dirty when placing my clothes down. 

We seriously pondered that if the floors were not cleaned that if the bedsheets and pillow covers were even cleaned before we used them. I will never know for sure, and it bothers me.

They told me there was people checking in the same day I am checking out so I offered to remove the pillow covers and bedsheets and place them on the floor for their convenience but they said I could just leave everything the way it is for the next guests.

The host made me feel welcome, and was very nice. The neighborhood is very nice. "
7859909,56576036,2015-12-14,8679293,Max,Great place! 
368403,7860224,2013-10-06,7570404,Ken,Great space and host! We had a very positive experience using this home for our research and language study. 
368403,9669487,2014-01-05,8219074,Jamie,"My family and I had a very comfortable visit at Bagley Place!  The best things are the big open kitchen and long dining room table.  Very few homes truly have dinner seating for the number of people the house sleeps!  I looked at a lot of houses that slept 8 people, but then had tables and settings for only 6!  This house had room not only for the occupants, but also for me and my children who live locally.

The only caution I would offer is that the bathrooms are rather small (consistent with all Seattle houses of a certain age.)  If you have large or tall family members, they will find the bathrooms a little tight--particularly the upstairs bathroom with its slanted ceiling.  This was hardly a deal breaker though.

It is truly the best outfitted house I've ever stayed in.  Plenty of towels, extra tissues, spices and oil, serving dishes, pots and pans--really everything you could need or want to be comfortable and feel at home.  

My family is hoping to find a time to come back in the summer to more fully enjoy the proximity to Green Lake!"
368403,13928084,2014-06-08,10159885,Sarah,This was an amazing place for my film crew and I to stay during our weeklong filming in Seattle. Trung was gracious and helpful with our needs and made sure we were completely comfortable. Would highly recommend this beautiful property!
368403,20572267,2014-10-01,5491921,Paul,"We had a great stay, everything was just as it was described in the profile. Very clean, tidy and enjoyable!"
368403,44094381,2015-08-24,28995281,Margaret,"We had a wonderful time at this home. The location, near Green Lake, is wonderful. I was really happy when we first arrived and I saw how clean and spacious the house is. The photos on the web page represent the house well but don't fully convey that each bedroom is large and beautifully decorated. We rented the whole house for 12 people and it was perfect as our family gathered to attend a wedding. The patio was lovely and the separate room with billiard table was fun our group. All linens and towels were clean and ample. The kitchen was especially nice with a great stove and fully equipped. We could not have been happier. Would definitely recommend this rental. Thanks Trung."

5686178,29639918,2015-04-10,16528889,Kris,Suzanne was a very good host and made sure I had everything I needed.  The apartment itself is cute and tidy with beautiful views of the beach and sunset.  The neighborhood is great for people watching and there are many restaurants within walking distance.  I enjoyed my stay here and would not hesitate to recommend this room to others.
5686178,33578102,2015-05-30,29894955,Mauro,"Suzanne did an exceptional job of making me feel welcome in her home. The location of this residence is superb, right on the Alki beach minutes from a stretch of beautiful beach restaurants/shops. She provided me with coffee, cream, and various material items that made my stay more comfortable than anticipated. Knowing that it was my first visit to Seattle, she provided a plethora of ideas based on my personal interests, and all her suggestions were spot on!

I would highly recommend and support staying at this location with this host. "
7534398,52177608,2015-10-26,55144,Rachel,"I loved staying in Kelly's adorable apartment with her sweet cats that kept me company. Walking distance to a ton of delicious and fun restaurants and bars, this neigborhood is great and easily accessible from other parts of Seattle. Kelly was a wonderful host - filling the room with an abundance of snacks and amenities and thoughtfully offered helpful advice and directions to get to know the area. "
7534398,52928191,2015-11-02,111799,Kelly,"Kelly was a fantastic host.  She responded to our request within minutes and had great communication leading up to our stay.  We picked her place because it was in the heart of the Ballard neighborhood.  We were just a few blocks away from lovely bars and restaurants.  
The room was just as pictured and even more!  A very comfortable bed with plenty of closet space. Kelly added lots of extras in the room such as snacks, bottled waters, toiletries and a coffee maker. She was friendly and easy to chat with and gave us good directions to all the hot spots down the block. A Five Star experience for a fraction of the price... I'd definitely visit again!"
7534398,54275740,2015-11-17,15980172,Lance,"Kelly was a gracious and wonderful host. Her space was very inviting, and her amenities in the room were truly a step above and beyond. Communication was great, and made the experience as good as it possibly could have been. It was so pleasant to sit down, and share conversation about my trip, and get good ideas of things to do from Kelly. Also, her movie room is really awesome. "
7534398,54492227,2015-11-20,14779664,Annie,The room was cute and cosy and was in a perfect Ballard location. Kelly was very welcoming and friendly and made us feel at home while also giving us space when needed. I would definitely recommend Kelly's place - especially if you like hilarious cats.
7534398,55744529,2015-12-05,12605163,Jacqueline,"Kelly was pretty much the perfect host. And she has pretty much thought of everything. The room (and bed, most importantly) is comfortable, light (it's a corner space with windows on two sides), and I appreciated the desk space, as I was in town to work. But Kelly goes beyond expectations. She has stocked a bottom drawer full of things you might need, from snacks to toiletries, all, it would seem, complimentary. There is an iron and small ironing board in the closet, which was again appreciated. There is tea, coffee, a coffee machine, and even a selection of pens and Seattle postcards. OK, if you don't like cats or sharing the adjacent bathroom, then I can see this Airbnb might not be ideal. For everyone else though, this is a good value, excellently located, and utterly charming place to stay. "
7534398,55956417,2015-12-07,49433388,Erin,"My boyfriend and I considered staying in a hotel for our anniversary weekend, and we both agree that Kelly's place was better than any hotel we could have picked. From the moment she accepted our request to stay (which she did both promptly and kindly) we felt welcome in her home. Her apartment is literally the best apartment we have ever been in. It's charming, beautifully decorated, warm, and bright. Kelly provides more amenities than most hotels, including snacks, coffee, and miscellaneous items like hair ties and deodorant. She also provided maps of Ballard and several books/lists listing local attractions and food. Before our visit, Kelly advised us to bring some warm clothes as her apartment got a little chilly at night, which proved to be good advice. We were never uncomfortable, however, thanks to the space heater and blankets provided in the guest room. We loved hanging out with her two cats Henry (who barely tolerated us) and Harlow (who we seriously considered cat-napping). Her projector is awesome; we watched ""American Hustle"" and ""Sleepless in Seattle"" (obviously!), and we easily could have spent the whole weekend holed up on her couch with her impressive DVD collection. Kelly herself is a wonderful host. She gave us plenty of space and privacy, but was also open to hanging out and talking with us. Playing with her cats and talking about movies with her was one of the highlights of our trip. We were impressed with how she communicated with us before the trip, giving us all the information we needed before we needed it. She responds quickly to messages and texts. The trip was fun, relaxing, and non-stressful. We would rent her guest room again in a heartbeat. Thanks for such an awesome experience, Kelly!"
7534398,56409773,2015-12-13,41090750,Peter,"Kelly was great a great host. She was very welcoming, and her place was clean and comfortable.  Street parking near her place was easy to find and we couldn't have asked to be in a better location.  The house was in walking distance of some great coffee, food and shopping. If we went back to Seattle we know where we'd want to stay! Oh, and the cats were great too!"
7534398,57057120,2015-12-21,39079530,Brittin,"Kelly's home and our bedroom were lovely. Very clean and lots of charm! The bedroom had a variety of amenities like coffee and Seattle-related information. She was home when we got there, but was flexible in leaving a key outside for us since we didn't know when we were arriving. The bedroom can get a little chilly, but two heaters were provided to heat it up! Also, it's in a nice neighborhood and their are restaurants within walking distance. Overall a great experience.  "
1251763,25196468,2015-01-09,9409226,Jessie," This place was just as advertised and the location was fantastic, just a couple of blocks from the convention center where I was attending a conference.  The room was clean and nice and everything about my stay was easy.  The host was also very accommodating of the constraints on my reservation that came from sharing the room with a friend at a different company.  I would stay here again."
9632775,57048694,2015-12-21,49736375,MarSu,This house is really good with full furnished. It has very close distance to super market and university. The house is clean and located within quiet area. I really like the room and I will stay there next time I come.
9679301,57401464,2015-12-25,48551041,Xinyu,"Mozelle is very kind. It is a great experience staying in her place where everything is clean and neat. Also, Her place locates near to most of Seattle scenic spot. Among all Airbnb hosts I have met, she is the best."
9679301,58404060,2016-01-02,51275159,Ashley,"Mozelle is such a sweet and welcoming person it was easy to feel at home. Her place is well decorated, very clean and in a great location easy to find right near the water. I would gladly visit her home again for my travel needs! "
9995551,58213602,2016-01-01,39238605,Bert,Awesome host! The cottage is nice and clean and Jennifer provides everything that we need. Thank you Jennifer. It was a great trip.
4363919,22607606,2014-11-10,21609225,Joe,Very friendly and helpful. Easy instructions. 
4363919,26926142,2015-02-22,22558733,Allen,"Great place, clean and in a great neighborhood - very central to a TON of things in Seattle.  Doug was a great host and, although we didn't get a chance to use all of the amenities (pool, jacuzzi, gym), I was happy that it was an option!"
4363919,32262017,2015-05-16,5818816,Steven,"Sea to Sky was incredibly responsive to questions and concerns. This review is actually for one of their Harbor Steps properties as when confirming the day before, there was apparently some sort of issue and the apt was already occupied. We instead were given a similar 2 bedroom in a beautiful building with a wonderful location. "
4363919,42703989,2015-08-15,31455952,Sarah,"We were really pleased with the size and layout of the apartment which was perfect for us, a group of 5 adults and one child.  There was enough space for us all and the apartment was well equipped and clean with plenty of towels etc. It was also in a great location and the roof terrace overlooking the Puget Sound was great.  A brilliant spot for a few days in the city..."
4363919,50480052,2015-10-12,42954793,Lynda,"This AirBnb looked exactly like the photos, so we weren't disappointed  at all.  My 6 friends who stayed here were very impressed. The place was very clean and almost all the necessities were providing from towels, paper towels, even a little size shampoo and conditioner. The manual was well put together and provided a lot of necessary information. Check out was super easy. I would look into that place for my next Seattle visit. All necessities provided and clean bed, sheets, towels, etc. fast internet. Quick follow up when we called them about key troubles. Very responsive.    It was also very nice that they had a parking spot! (Even if there were strict rules)."
1042022,4408895,2013-05-03,1483158,Megen,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Though we did not spend as much time in the Madison Park area as we expected, we found it to be the perfect place to start and finish our day.  The apartment is well decorated and the thoughtful touches (snacks from Trader Joes & a stack of books for our two year old) were much appreciated.  We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to visit Madison Park or downtown Seattle (so long as you don't mind a good walk to start the day or taking public transportation in the city). "
1042022,4723435,2013-05-21,5680874,Annie,"We really enjoyed our stay at Lene and Johnny's apartment. The apartment was clean and quiet. Super comfortable bed with a supply of warm bedding. There were some fresh fruit and yogurt in the fridge which we really appreciated. Fresh and delicious coffee to grind too... 

The apartment is located in a very quiet and cute neighbourhood, near a few restaurants and two blocks away from public transit. We took the bus to go downtown and it was super easy and short (15 minutes max). There are some great views of the lake nearby which was a plus.

Lene and Johnny were easy to reach and very helpful when needed. I would recommend this apartment to others. Thanks for everything!"
1042022,4847494,2013-05-28,2915002,Nate And Andrea,"We enjoyed our stay in the basement studio.  It was tidy, and the bed was very comfortable.  We appreciated the homemade cookies and snacks provided too. The best part of this place though is the surrounding neighborhood. It's a beautiful area with fun shops, good food, and a nice view of the water a short walk away. "
1042022,4955318,2013-06-03,1455839,Cory,"Cute in-law in a fantastic location. The neighborhood is ridiculously gorgeous, with a small main shopping street (cafe, bakery, restaurants) just blocks away. Also nearby, within a couple blocks are tennis courts, the lakefront with designated swimming area, and homes that warrant a mini-architectural tour around the neighborhood. We had a rental car, but there is also a nearby bus line that goes directly downtown. Johnny was super accommodating regarding check-in, which is always a huge airbnb plus. We did some light cooking, and enjoyed the little snacks and coffee left for us. Madison Park is a gem of a 'hood. Highly recommended. Thanks a bunch!"
1042022,5038028,2013-06-09,6215043,Kathy,"We really enjoyed our trip to Seattle and we LOVED Lene & Johnny's apartment. It's located in a super charming neighborhood with cute shops, great restaurants, and Lake Washington within a few blocks walk. The apartment was clean, comfortable and quiet - and after a long day of wandering around the city, we appreciated the complimentary tea & snacks, & of course the big, comfy bed. Both Lene & Johnny were easy to work with and quick to respond to any & all questions.  If you find yourself needing a place to stay in Seattle, skip the hotel and stay at Lene & Johnny's!!

1042022,5093481,2013-06-11,5956961,Daniela,"You will not regret staying there, awesome flat in a great area.
The neighbourhood is absolutely gorgeous. You should definitely explore the streets nearby.
The  rooms are tidy and clean. You will find everything you need for a pleasant stay.
It is just a 3 minute walk to the bus which takes you directly to Seattle downtown.
Lene and Johnny are very friendly and helpful, we had a great time there and we will come back."
1042022,5260117,2013-06-21,246846,Bob,"We spent 3 nights in this spacious, comfortable unit with everything supplied for our welcome, including tea, coffee, yoghurt etc.
The position is convenient for travel to the town centre by bus and there is a grocery store within walking distance which stocks quality fruit, readymade meals and most other needs. The shopping strip also has a pharmacy and a variety of restaurants.
Our hosts were welcoming yet quiet and attuned to our needs. We highly recommend this unit.
"
1042022,5365424,2013-06-26,6083126,Scott,"The unit is a great little self contained home for our stay for several days in the beautiful area of Madison Park, close to some beautiful shops, the great food at Bings and near a Bus route that can get you into town. Lenny and Johnny were unobtrusive yet helpful, as were travelling with our young daughter.    "
1042022,5407107,2013-06-28,5863254,Kevin,Lene and Johnny's place is perfect. The location is quiet and with easy access to Seattle. Thanks for a great place to stay. 
1042022,5562729,2013-07-06,6705872,Rachel,"We had a great time staying at Johnny and Lene's apartment. It was easy to get downtown on the bus, but nice to come back to a quiet neighborhood at night. The neighborhood seems very safe and I felt totally comfortable walking around at night. Overall, a great experience and I would rent from them if I come back to Seattle again."
1042022,5754053,2013-07-15,5357344,Lacey,"This apartment was a perfect lodging for my husband and I as we honeymooned in Seattle.  The location was indeed awesome, and Lene and Johnny couldn't be more accommodating. The house was well-stocked with many amenities and we felt very at home.  We didn't spend much time cooking for ourselves but the kitchen and dining room space were well suited for a couple.  Although we stayed for only two nights, we could easily have stayed much longer.  Our hosts obviously have a flair for creating comfortable spaces and the neighborhood surrounding their home was very picturesque and quite quiet for a central location.  Johnny and Lene themselves were a pleasure to meet.  We can't recommend this spot enough!"
1042022,5966210,2013-07-24,1511931,Clay,"This home is in a fantastic and quiet neighborhood close to pubs, restaurants, shops, parks, and Lake Washington is right there. It's a bit farther from downtown than some other places, but bus route 11 around the corner will take you right there in 10 minutes. This was easily the best Seattle accommodation I've yet stayed in in Seattle. Spacious, clean, plenty of books, small kitchen and dining area in case you want to eat in, spacious bathroom. The hosts are also extremely friendly and happy to help out in any way they can. I can't think of a single criticism of the entire experience. "
1042022,6178006,2013-08-02,7244275,Sarah,"We had a lovely time staying here.We really enjoyed seeing a slice of neighborhood life in Madison Park. The apartment was very sweetly and thoughtfully decorated and the quality of both the towels and linens was high. These touches, including fresh fruit and snacks waiting for us on arrival, wifi, netflix and books left for our young son to read, made us feel very welcome and comfortable. We really enjoyed it here! The playground across the street was a big hit with our son, too."
1042022,6243285,2013-08-05,6941356,Louisa,"Fantastic stay. The apartment was perfect size for two people/a couple. Everything was incredibly clean. There were ripe fresh plums, a few clif bars, and some water, which was just so lovely, and a life saver when we were in a time crunch and didn't have time for breakfast. We stayed overnight while going to a family wedding in the neighborhood. We definitely hope to stay there again, when we come to visit the same family. We love this neighborhood."
1042022,6456594,2013-08-13,563637,Nova,Lene & Johnny provided a great home away from home.  The location is in a beautiful area with the beach a block away.  They provided all sorts of necessities that we didn't have to buy and or bring.  We rode our motorcycles for our visit and parked them out front on the street with no issues or concerns.  Neighborhood is safe and quiet and wonderful to stroll and see some of the beautiful homes in the area.  Would definitely stay again.
1042022,6542927,2013-08-16,7798677,Emily,"What a fantastic spot!  Walk to park, playground, beach, restaurants, bakeries, coffee shops, grocery store, ice cream - you name it!

Short drive to downtown Seattle and many other neighborhoods and attractions.  

Lene and Johnny were so hospitable and very accommodating -- providing toddler-friendly books/snacks.

We will absolutely recommend this spot to other small families/couples and stay there during our next trip to Seattle."
1042022,6867175,2013-08-28,6144360,Nancy,"For a longish stay I needed a comfortable place to settle in -- and this is it.   The Madison Park neighborhood is m favorite part of Seattle; charming, convenient, walk to groceries and restaurants, safe -- and you are one block from a great public beach on Lake Washington.  The apartment is unusually clean and has everything you need, including some good books.  Hosts totally available as needed and helpful.  This is a great place to stay.   "
1042022,6964553,2013-09-01,1516574,Shunyi,"We stayed at Lene's place for two nights, and it was perfect.  The half basement apartment is self-sufficient and well-equipped.  The rooms were tastefully decorated.  Lene's son gave us good recommendation on where to eat around the neighborhood-- go to Cactus for some yummy Mexican food!  The neighborhood is so beautiful and tranquil, within walking distance to a small beach right on Lake Washington.  We had a car and it took us maybe 10-15 minutes to downtown along Madison Street, and it was a piece of cake!  I highly recommend Lene's place!  Thanks!           "
1042022,7120826,2013-09-07,3180285,Beth,"What a great apartment! The neighborhood is wonderful with shops, restaurants and the waterfront within in easy walking distance, and the apartment itself is comfortable and well-stocked. We would definitely stay here again on our next trip to Seattle."
1042022,8130848,2013-10-17,1277980,Kirsten,"What a perfect place - we enjoyed our holidays at Lene and Johnny's house very much. The apartment is just great - very individual and a relaxing place to stay after walking all day through Seattle (very quiet - night and day). Lene and Johnny have been fantastic hosts, we felt really spoiled. Public transport is easy to reach just the same like supermarket, bakery, bank ...- just a 2 minutes walk. We would definitely love to come back and can just highly recommend this place. "
1042022,8284026,2013-10-23,9298136,Eric,Great clean place. The apartment had everything we needed for our three day stay. The hosts were out of our way but still available for questions and suggestions. Traveling around town was also convenient as the bus stop was only a block away (just a 7 minute ride to downtown). 
1042022,9146481,2013-12-09,10281934,Evan,We had a great stay at Lene and Johnny's place. The apartment is very spacious and was very comfortable. If you want to feel at home stay here. There's plenty of parking and lots to do within walking distance from their house. Highly recommend. 
1042022,10179327,2014-02-04,9302579,Bev,Very nice and comfortable. I will stay there again. The hosts are very helpful. 
1042022,10226455,2014-02-07,2170246,Tamsen,"Very sweet little abode.  Full kitchen with everything needed for meals.  Comfortable bed, lots of hot water for the shower.  Lene was kind enough to accommodate my last minute lodging.

"
1042022,10303668,2014-02-11,10753047,John,"This is a really nice place to stay.  Nicely decorated, cozy, and a great location.  The only down side was noise from upstairs.  I am a light sleeper and go to bed fairly early, so footsteps and whatnot on the floor above kept me up at night.  Not a huge deal, but a bit of a bummer.  Overall, it's a great spot.  Just be aware of the noise issue if you are a light sleeper.  "
1042022,10438742,2014-02-18,11775647,Lindsay,"The quaint and cozy home was so warm and inviting. It was perfect for a weekend getaway. The location was beautiful, very close to Lake Washington and in walking distance to great dining. Lene was so welcoming and made us feel right at home. I highly recommend staying with them! "
1042022,11008744,2014-03-17,4859689,Christian,"We had a great time. Great space, great neighborhood, great hosts. Very clean and comfy. I would recommend to anyone looking to hang out in Seattle!"
1042022,11286047,2014-03-28,12847163,Paul,"I booked the place for my 83yo parents.  The location was great for them; they really enjoyed the short lakeside walks to the shops and restaraunts.  They were also happy with Lene and Johnny's apartment. The bed was comfortable, everything was clean, and they appreciated the little kitchen.  All-in-all, a very pleasant stay for them.  Thanks L&J!  "
1042022,11484715,2014-04-05,11827210,Beth,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at Lene and Johnny's ""Perfect Location"" - which was! One block from our daughter's tiny apartment and 1-2 blocks from fine dining and all sorts of shopping venues. We rented bikes and rode all around Seattle from the neighborhood, felt safe and secure. The basement unit was clean, well furnished, and our hosts left breakfast treats to start our stay. We cooked several meals to share with our daughter. Lene allowed us to use the washer and dryer (we were there a week). We'd stay again any time and recommend this Airbnb to anyone. (By the way, earplugs solve the small amount of upstairs walking noise.)"
1042022,11697706,2014-04-12,13791723,Richard,"I enjoyed my stay at Lene and Johnny's place by Lake Washington.  Great location, easy walkable neighborhood and close to restaurants, a pharmacy, a local grocery store and coffee shops.  The unit is self-contained, comfortable, and has all you need for a short or long stay.  I look forward to staying there again sometime."
1042022,12011556,2014-04-21,13585894,Benjamin,"Fantastic place to stay if you enjoy a quiet neighborhood and space to relax. The amenities are perfect for a several-day stay- a full kitchen, livingroom and good internet access all to yourself.

The neighborhood is a bit far from freeway access so add some time if you need to get anywhere. There are plenty of shops and restaurants just a few blocks away, though, so no need to leave this charming neighborhood if you don't have to!"
1042022,12694284,2014-05-08,14162309,Nicole,I rented Lene and Johnny's house for my parents a couple of weeks ago. They really enjoyed their stay! Lene and Johnny were so thoughtful and the mother in law apartment was cozy and very comfortable. The location was perfect for them and I would highly recommend this place! 
1042022,13013227,2014-05-17,13791723,Richard,"I stayed for the second time at Lene and Johnny's place in Madison Park--great location, nice quiet and private apartment--well set up for a short or long stay.  I would rent there again.  "
1042022,13460480,2014-05-27,1972564,Veronica,"My husband and I loved this cozy, charming apartment in a beautiful, quiet neighborhood. There was more than enough space for us and everything was comfortable, functional, tidy, and stylish. I was unfamiliar with the Madison Park neighborhood and was afraid that it might be inconvenient to get to central locations in Seattle, but it was really no problem at all. Plus there are lots of nice, neighborhood spots within walking distance. Having a kitchen to use was very handy -- especially since it was stocked with delicious chocolate and tea! Thank you, Johnny and Lene!"
1042022,13797568,2014-06-04,4015819,Stephen,"The location is indeed perfect, close to Lake Washington, Arboretum, very pleasant neighbourhood and access to good bus service to get downtown.

Flat is roomy and has been carefully set out to provide everything you will need for your stay, including tea and coffee.  Bed really comfy.

Lene and Jonny, delightful and very helpful

Note Madison Park is at the bottom of a long pretty steep hill best accessed by bus or car."
1042022,14164655,2014-06-13,16150574,Virginia,"The stay was very nice. The hosts were great about sending responses and providing information about their place. Everything was as advertised with nice personal touches. The neighborhood is great, park and water so close and also shopping, restaurants 1-2 blocks away. Would recommend to others!"
1042022,14430728,2014-06-19,5555427,Beth,"
Lene and Johnny were very welcoming and quite responsive to any questions or concerns we had.  The neighborhood around Madison Park is perfect for visitors with lots of shops and great restaurants and coffee shops nearby.  This location is close to the bus line and near a small market also.We used a rental car and had no difficulty parking on the street.   The bed is very comfy, and the neighborhood is safe and quiet. This is a small ""mother-in-law""apartment with a small sitting room, kitchen, and breakfast room.  The separate entrance makes it very convenient to come and go without disturbing the owners.   We would recommend this perfect location to anyone!"
1042022,14634426,2014-06-23,16115226,Steven,"Unfortunately, my wife and I were only there for a short time, and we did not have the pleasure of meeting Lene and Johnny. They were very accommodating and the apartment was just clean and comfy. The neighborhood was great with lots of things to do near by. Drive to downtown was quick and easy as well. We are definitely missing Seattle, great place to visit. Thanks for having us Lene and Johnny!"
1042022,15140272,2014-07-03,15579334,Will,"Great stay in Seattle .... 94 degree day at the Madison Park Beach.
Terrific location.... on street parking .... excellent communication with Johnny & Lene.

Very nice accommodation good bed and kitchen well equipped.

We will be regulars on our annual visits!"
1042022,15326473,2014-07-07,12126861,Mark,Lene and Johnny were great hosts. The apartment was very nicely furnished and perfectly clean. The chocolate left on the counter and beers in the fridge were a really nice touch. Madison Park is quite a picturesque neighborhood with number of good bars and restaurants within a short walk. I'd recommend Bing's for good beers at good prices during happy hour. There is also a grocery store within a block and the access to the beach is also really nice. The neighborhood itself is a little detached from the busier parts of Seattle but the bus stop is very close by and a Lyft/cab to Capitol Hill is only about $10-$15. Would stay again.
1042022,15467128,2014-07-09,6824058,Papia,"I had a quick trip through the area so didn't get the chance to meet Lene and Johnny, but they were accommodating to my schedule and the apartment was just as pictured in a lovely neighborhood in Seattle. "
1042022,15599376,2014-07-12,17349923,Ashley,"Johnny was a very laid back and welcoming host (we did not meet Lene, as we were only there one night).  The space itself was incredible.  Of the three airbnb places we stayed at on our vacation, this was our favorite.  The neighborhood was very quiet, within a block or two from the water.  The space was very cozy but at the same time spacious.  We wished we ended up staying there longer than one night because the place was so comfortable.  We really appreciated the Netflix access on the Wii, perfect for when you've come home for the evening and want to relax.  The coffee grinder was also a very nice touch.    "
1042022,15832037,2014-07-16,16870587,Leila,"The listing description was completely accurate. The apartment was clean, cute, and in a great part of town. It was 2 blocks from Lake Washington. Lene and Johnny were very hospitable and helpful. We visited during 90 degree weather. At our request they brought us a fan at 10:00 pm at night. They went the extra mile in accommodating us and we appreciated it! "
1042022,16037080,2014-07-20,8937264,James,"This was a perfect first experience for me with AirBnb. Lovely, spacious, private and smartly furnished apartment. I went immediately to the beach 2 blocks away at Lake Washington and all went swimmingly from there. Great access to downtown and Capitol Hill, courtesy of the handy 11 bus. Thank you, Lene! "
1042022,16201640,2014-07-23,13856052,Diana,"Everything was as described. The apartment has plenty of room (for 3) and so close to everything. We have a three year old and there was a great play ground 1 block away and lots of restaurants that caters to both parents and children. The apartment was clean, with plenty of towels, sheets and blankets. There was breakfast snacks left for us which I thought was a nice touch and bottled waters for outings. The beach was two blocks away as was a grocery store. The neighborhood is upscale and very safe. We were close to so many things. I highly recommend this place for your next Seattle visit."
1042022,16553000,2014-07-29,15917358,Karen,"A great first experience for us with Airbnb.  The unit was as described in the listing. The place is clean and has everything you need for a few nights stay, the bed was comfortable, and the neighborhood is great.  Lene was very accommodating and helpful.  Our 18 month old daughter loved the park just a block away.  Would definitely return or recommend to a friend."
1042022,16821820,2014-08-03,6639233,Sandra,Lene & Jonny's place was ideal for our 4 day stay in Madison Park. Location was perfect for the beach and easy access to Downtown Seattle by the number 10 bus. Great shops and restaurants all within 2 min stroll. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wishing to stay in Madison Park.
1042022,17001798,2014-08-05,1192978,Melanie,"Awesome place in seattle! The appartement was lovely, clean and cozy! We loved the danish beds! The communication with Lene was very easy and she helped us with our questions! Close to downtown and with a nice neighbourhood!"
1042022,17285883,2014-08-10,17384304,Nick,"While visiting the Seattle area, my mother and I enjoyed our stay in Madison park. The neighbor hood is filled with small, local shops and restaurants. We felt at home staying with Lene and Johnny, we defiantly hope to visit again. "
1042022,18225122,2014-08-24,11691517,Daniel & Faith,"Lene, Johnny & Family were excellent hosts. The apartment was clean and in a fabulous location. Lake Washington, Madison Valley Park greenspace, wonderful restaurants were a 5 min walk from the apartment.  We were able to access a local fitness center and to enjoy long walks in the beautiful neighborhood of Madison Park. We stayed for two weeks and were able to do our laundry and get fresh linens and towels when needed. Our hosts were also very helpful with suggestions about Seattle highlights.We would highly recommend this Airbnb listing. Faith & Danny"
1042022,18450426,2014-08-26,20238985,Trevor,Lene and Johnny were quick to respond to any questions. The location was great with it easy being walking distance to many places to eat by the lake and so close to the bus stop. We had a wonderful time and loved the place. Thanks!
1042022,18621065,2014-08-29,17738334,Janis,"Everything about my stay in Madison Park was wonderful. It really felt like a vacation. Lene & Johnny's apt has more space than I had thought and it is beautifully set up and equipped, with many thoughtful extras. Great bed, lots of thick towels, walk-in clothes closet, good full kitchen and bathroom, nice couch and many books in living room. All especially 
comfortable and convenient! I loved the neighborhood - attractive with shops, restaurants, beach and the lake all truly within two blocks. Feels completely safe and rather European strolling in the evenings. Will be returning often to Seattle to visit family and staying here! Thank you!
"
1042022,19002914,2014-09-04,7345788,Corinna,"Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to meet Lene & Johnny in person. Nevertheless, they made sure that we could check in at the most suitable time for us and provided us with small goods in the fridge (chocolate, water and juice). The apartment is great, the interior is very colorful and artsy, which I liked a lot - it has individuality. One small issue is that we could hear footsteps in the house, since the floor is quite thin. We will still recommend Lene & Johnny's place to friends if they travel to Seattle! :)"

1042022,19525957,2014-09-14,10620267,Trisha,"Lene and Johnny's home is very welcoming!  The house is very well located if you want to enjoy one of the many great neighborhoods in (email hidden)ry walkable and quiet.  They were very kind hosts and left some refreshments for us upon arrival and made themselves available if we had any questions during our stay.  The unit is very spacious and great for a couple or small family.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thanks for a very enjoyable stay.
"
1042022,19743967,2014-09-17,17469256,Jason,"Lene and Johnny were great host. They hosted my parents on their recent visit to Seattle and everything was as advertised. Apt is close to Madison Valley shops and the lake access points there.  

One thing to note on this apt is the ceiling is a little low, so if you're 6'4 and taller take heed and duck in doorways."
1042022,20027296,2014-09-22,9504282,Haddie,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here! The apartment is in a great neighborhood. We walked every morning to the bakery or one of the other restaurants for coffee, and walked back along the lake. We really appreciated all of the little touches in the apartment, the fresh fruit, tea etc. The bed was really comfortable too!"
1042022,20235009,2014-09-26,16576572,Rafael,"We left Lene and Johnny's house just this morning and we already miss it! The location and the neighborhood are perfect. Downtown Seattle is just 20 minutes away by bus. There are restaurants and a great supermarket just around the corner. Lake Washington is just a few blocks away and everything is cosy and quiet near Madison Park.
The house is superclean, cosy, full of little touches making it very warm and stylish. The bed is really comfy, the kitchen well equipped... We didn't turn on the TV but it was there with Netflix and videogames in case we wanted to use it. They live upstairs so you can reach them very easily. They let you be as independent as you like but you know they are there in case you need them and we loved that. We could only meet Lene since Johnny was out of town, and she proved to be an excellent host. We had a car and the fact that we could park it in front of the house was definitely a plus. Honestly, there is nothing bad we can say about our experience. On the contrary, it has been one of the best so far! We will surely come back if we ever return to Seattle. This was PER-FECT. Thanks Lene!"
1042022,20425618,2014-09-29,19919988,Svetlana,Fantastic place to stay if you enjoy a quiet neighborhood and space to relax. My husband and me really enjoyed our stay here! The apartment is in a great neighborhood. The amenities are perfect. All is same as described. Very good internet connection. Free parking place just opposite the front door.
1042022,20900654,2014-10-07,2074144,Julie & George,"My Mom stayed for a few days and absolutely loved it. The location is perfect, right by the lake and very easy walking distance to all the shops and restaurants. The bed was super comfortable, and there was a ton of space in the apartment. Really nicely decorated, clean, lovely touches everywhere. Lene and Johnny were incredibly responsive and helpful at every step of the way. This is the perfect place to stay in Madison Park. She will definitely be back!!"
1042022,21720630,2014-10-22,22186165,Katy,Lene and Johnny's place was perfect for our weeklong trip to Seattle. The neighborhood is nice and quiet and not too far from downtown (we did have a car). They were very accommodating of us changing our check in them when we added a stop that put us a few hours later than we initially thought. The chocolates and apples were the perfect touch to make it feel more like home for the week.  
1042022,23965114,2014-12-15,11691517,Daniel & Faith,"Our second time in 2014 to stay at Johnny & Lene's  listing:  The location is wonderful, the bedding comfortable, &  kitchen & bathroom very clean.  Johnny &  Lene are very welcoming. Both are lovely hosts."
1042022,24276015,2014-12-24,7116921,Meredith,"Lene's house was the perfect getaway for us when we were up in Seattle visiting my brother. Lene was very easy to work with and made sure to be there when we arrived to give us keys. The unit was fully stocked for us. We liked that there were ample towels and little amenities like peppermint chocolate (for Christmas-time). Lene went beyond the call of duty to mail us the two library books we forgot and left there after our stay, which was so appreciated. If you want to be in the Madison Park area, this is really a great private place."
1042022,24465063,2014-12-29,17058239,Vicky,"Lene & Johnny are very nice people! Great place to stay and we enjoyed Seattle.  Convenience location, heater, hot water, provided everything you need! "
1042022,24970398,2015-01-04,10911957,Ann,"We had a very comfortable stay with Lene and Johnny. The bed was great and there was plenty of room to hang out. The location was wonderful - VERY close to the lake, lots of cute shops and restaurants (must try Cactus - thanks for the tip, Johnny!). When we arrived and saw there was only on street parking we were worried, but we never had trouble finding a spot. If there wasn't one right in front of the house, there was one within two houses.  No problem at all. Overall, a very pleasant stay."
1042022,25284666,2015-01-11,25228950,Jessica,"My parents stayed here while visiting me in Seattle. The house is a great location with many shops, restaurants, and parks within walking distance. My parents enjoyed their stay and said the bed was one of the most comfortable they've slept on. I will definitely recommend ths house for any friends who come to Seattle for a vacation. "
1042022,26994966,2015-02-23,26129872,Daryl,"Lene and Johnny's apartment was just as pictured in the photos, simple, clean, quiet and with a very comfortable bed. It felt like my home away from home as I visited my daughter in Seattle. Very nice to have the space for a guest one night and for enjoying evening talks. Great residential neighborhood with Lake Washington a short walk away and a Starbucks and restaurants just around the corner. Bus stop into downtown is also just around the corner. It was my first airbnb experience and I am sold!"
1042022,27303913,2015-03-01,8587692,Diana,"I had a great stay! House was as described, and there were even some goodies (yay for chocolate!) left for me. Really cute and quiet neighborhood with shops including a grocery store, coffee, etc a short walk away, plus a little bit of lakeside beach just a few blocks from the house. I would definitely recommend staying here."

My daughter and I, on university visits, arrived very late from Vancouver and hadn't had a proper dinner. Hosts had humus and carrots and salami and cheese for us. How did she know! We were so relieved and happy!"
1042022,30721290,2015-04-26,31182716,Jan,"The rooms were clean and neat and comfortable.  Lena and Johnny readily answered all our questions, including our son's questions about the oscilloscope used as room decor.  It's a lovely area of Seattle. "
1042022,31239816,2015-05-03,9749840,Tamara,"Lene is a great host, she was very responsive in arranging check-in time, arranging for an extra half day to stay in on Saturday instead of paying a full day fees plus providing directions and any help. Upon arrival Lene was very helpful and welcoming, she even left some fruits and food in the fridge for me which were very handy after a 12-hour flight. The place is very nice and clean and the street is very beautiful and quite. You will occasionally hear some movement from above but its a basement flat after all and wasn't too distracting. I had a slight issue which I reported to Lene and she immediately helped. She even checked on me several times when I was sick. All in all very positive experience. "
1042022,31815445,2015-05-10,528601,Kim,"My husband and I had the incredible pleasure of staying at Lene & Johnny's while we were in Seattle attending our son's college graduation! OMG, we LOVED the apartment! Everything about it was perfect! It was immaculate! And stocked with everything we could possible need! Lene even had fruit, chocolate, bagels, cream cheese and good strong coffee!
The neighborhood was so nice, too! Very quaint and quiet! 
WE HAD A LOVELY TIME!! We will definitely contact Lene & Johnny again when we are planning a trip to Seattle!
Thank you Lene & Johnny!!

1042022,32436068,2015-05-17,6501326,Hubertus,We really enjoyed our stay at Lene's and Johnny's Place. Everything is perfectly arranged and the apartment is perfect if you want to explore Seattle. Nice neighborhood and direct busline to towntown. 
1042022,32913461,2015-05-23,1384420,Kim,"Let's just say that we wish we could have stayed longer.  Lene and Johnny's home and neighborhood is perfect.  I used to live in Seattle, and always wondered what it would be to live in Madison Park, and now I know that if I ever moved back, this area would be were I would want to live.  The apartment was immaculate, and the space was huge for two people.  Very private and it had everything we would need, from a full kitchen, to a nice living room to sit in.  There were even some extras that they left us like yummy crackers, fresh fruit, and Theo's chocolate, plus water in the mini-fridge. Parking was super easy, and not part of the regular Seattle limit/residential parking, and there were some great cafes and restaurants that were just 2 blocks away.  The water is a block away and the area is great for walking.  I highly recommend Lene and Johnny's apartment and we hope that when we come back to Seattle to visit, the apartment is available again.  Thanks so much!"
1042022,33400369,2015-05-27,6093767,Lester,"Lene and Johnny have a great, cozy place to stay in a wonderful location.  Lene was great in answering all of our questions.

1042022,34098931,2015-06-04,1857087,Peter,"Lene and Johnny were great.  Lene was flexible with my arrival time and made me feel very comfortable in the house.  She also had some great suggestions for places to eat, both in the local 'hood and further afield.  Johnny is a real honest-to-goodness Seattlite (rarity!) and as friendly and fun as they come."
1042022,34253603,2015-06-06,34684018,Rachael,"A friend and I wanted to visit the Seattle area, specifically downtown, so we decided to try Airbnb. We booked our stay at Lene and Johnny's place. It was perfect. Not only was Lene the best host by providing some snacks and a clean place, but there space was just like the pictures they provided on the website. We also enjoyed the quiet neighborhood they live in and the close public transportation. Within a block of there place was a bus stop. I would recommend this place to others and will consider staying here again!"
1042022,34947671,2015-06-14,5432839,Alexandra,"The apartment was nice and cosy and just what we had in mind (+extra points for the map of Scandinavia on the wall!). Everything worked perfectly. The neighbourhood was pretty and quiet, the beach was right next to it, free parking was always available, and the closest grocery store was really nice (lots of organic stuff and even tons of things that suited our vegetarian diet). Johnny and Lene (+the kids) were really warm and helpful and gave us lots of ideas on where to go in the city (music events, shops, restaurants and so on). We had a lovely stay and would certainly recommend staying at their apartment. Hope to be back some day!"
1042022,35571760,2015-06-20,26182833,Jenn,"We loved staying at Lene & Johnny's place! The neighborhood was wonderful - easy walking distances to shops, restaurants, and Lake Washington. The space was comfortable and cozy, with plenty of room to spread out. Additionally, they left us snacks including fruit, yogurt, water, and local specialty chocolates -- very much appreciated! As a few others have noted, you can hear people walking on the floors above you in the main house, but honestly we didn't hear them much and it wasn't a problem for us. Finally, Lene & Johnny were responsive and relaxed hosts. We came in late the first night and it wasn't a problem for them at all. I would definitely recommend their place for the comfortable space and great location."

1042022,38638910,2015-07-17,31596299,Christian,"Die Wohnung war sehr schön, sehr nett eingerichtet und mit allem ausgestattet was man in einem Apartment nur erwarten kann. Darüber hinaus standen Getränke und Snacks zur Verfügung. Die Nachbarschaft hat uns außerordentlich gut gefallen, nette Lokale und direkt am Strand von Madison Park am Lake Washington. Die Gastgeber selber versorgten uns mit guten Tipps bezüglich sightseeing in Seattle und taten alles um uns willkommen zu fühlen. Wir können die Wohnung nur wärmstens empfehlen."
1042022,38929954,2015-07-19,38049109,Stephanie,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we loved it!  We had been in a hotel for three days and spent the last two nights at Lene and Johnny's place.  The place is as the pictures show, it's private and very comfortable. We used the kitchen, they left us snacks and instructions on how to use the wi-fi, clean up, etc.  We felt right at home and after being in a hotel that's exactly what we wanted.  The location is fabulous, after a day we felt like locals.  We walked to the beach, went to the grocery store several times, had breakfast and drinks at the local places which were just one street over!  We used the bus line to get back to downtown and would just cab it back.  We would definitely stay here again and hope to one day.  Thanks Lene & Johnny!"
1042022,39434367,2015-07-23,38081835,Peggy,Lene and Johnny were easy to get a hold of and gave me the impression that if we needed anything to call.  When I picked up the keys we had a nice chat.  They gave us our space and were not noisy.  The description and pictures of the place were accurate.  We were very comfortable.  We enjoyed the easy walk to restaurants in a neighborhood that feels safe.  Our stay was very pleasant!
1042022,40093207,2015-07-28,812030,Tara,"The apartment was exactly like the pictures; clean & we had more than enough room. I appreciated that they left directions on how to use the TV (with amazon TV) & just general information about Seattle. A nice treat was the host left us local fruit & chocolate to enjoy when we arrived. 
The neighborhood is quaint & very safe. It was nice having the beach with water access only blocks away, especially since we came from a landlocked state. Bus stop, restaurants, bars & a market all within a few blocks from the house. Friendly host with great advice about the city & San Juan Islands

We would be happy to stay here again in the future.

1042022,41931240,2015-08-10,27789694,Monica,"Lene and Johnny were excellent hosts for my parents who'd never been to Seattle. Their space was perfect, private and in a premiere location to the beach and many local shops and restaurants.  They were all also very hospitable and left chocolate & other snacks in the fridge along with coffee and tea. The space was very clean and they let my mom wash clothes and got them fresh towels. Definitely recommend staying here to others! ;-)"
1042022,42310579,2015-08-12,37116893,Gavin,"Lene and Johnny's place was perfect for a couple of quiet nights. The decor was very comforting, the apartment had everything we could need, parking was easy, and the beach was two blocks away. Oh and there is  a great selection of books for your perusal. We will definitely stay there again next time in Seattle."
1042022,43361749,2015-08-19,2423339,Stuart,"The apartment was cozy, clean, and comfortable.  On-street parking was never a problem.  It is in a great location -- in a very nice, safe neighborhood, a short walk away from a swimming beach on Lake Washington, and very near to public transportation access that can take you all over town.  Also a very short walk to a grocery store and to some very nice restaurants as well.  It couldn't be in a better location.

Lene & Johnny were great hosts.  They left us snacks and chocolates for our arrival, and they were alway available when we needed them - which wasn't very often, but still very appreciated.  

All in all our stay was very nice, and we would definitely consider staying here again."
1042022,44044545,2015-08-23,41473556,Fernando,"Lene & Johnny were great hosts. They were responsive and had everything ready when we arrived. 

Their apartment was clean and cozy. We liked their neighborhood. There are good restaurants nearby, which we discovered using Lene & Johnny's guidebook, and it was really easy to park on the street. 

We highly recommend this listing and would definitely stay with Lene & Johnny again."
1042022,44665287,2015-08-28,38954983,Micah,Neighborhood was very nice and entrance was convenient.  Lene and Johnny were very nice and accommodating. 
1042022,44921323,2015-08-30,6735464,Alice & Rob,"Lene and Johnny were great hosts. Their place was comfortable and they left us chocolate and fruit, which was a thoughtful touch. The place is located in a really awesome neighborhood. We enjoyed swimming in Lake Washington and the easy access to all the restaurants and shops nearby. "
1042022,45974685,2015-09-07,32907912,Inessa,"The listing is very accurate.  The place is clean with a unique artistic touch. Hosts were flexible about our arrival time, responsive, and friendly. I would recommend this place and come back.
Thank you for your hospitality!"
1042022,46616302,2015-09-12,41097950,Scott,"We arrived and were settled in very quickly. Johnny gave us very clear instructions on how to access the unit while he was away, and Lene was helpful in pointing out some local flavor to us.

The place itself was clean, comfortable and welcoming. You can tell they enjoy hosting via Airbnb; the littlr guest book was really cool to flip through. The location was perfect to get downtown with ease. I would wholeheartedly endorse these hosts and their listing for anyone looking to experience Seattle. I will definitely be back."
1042022,47095336,2015-09-15,42936945,Eve Holiday,"I was very pleased with our stay at Lene and Johnny's basement apartment.  The apartment is very nicely decorated, comfortable bedding, and access to Netflix was a plus.  Host was very welcoming and also they provided complimentary water bottles, fruit and cheese.  Nice area to take a stroll and stop at local eateries or go by the lake. "
1042022,47490708,2015-09-19,41005333,Annie,"This really is the perfect location by Lake Washington!  We loved staying the cute apartment.  It is very homey and private.  Special touches included:  plush bath towels, fresh fruit, chocolate, and all kinds of information about the Seattle area.  We had such a nice little vacation, and definitely will plan on staying there again.
Thanks Lene & Johnny!

Annie and Rick "
1042022,48729199,2015-09-28,38659132,Jen,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay at Lene & Johnny's Lake Washington home!  Upon our arrival, they had fresh fruit and chocolate waiting for us which was a sweet little treat after traveling so long.  We appreciated how clean and tidy everything was, all of the natural light in every room, and the variety of cooking spices and teas... it was so nice to not have to shop for those things!  Not to mention the danish-style bed was a little haven.  My husband and I are thinking about switching our own home bedding to what Lene & Johnny provided because it was just SO comfortable, hah!  It got cold while we were there, and the space heater provided ample heat.  And several days I was sick, my husband enjoyed playing video games in bed on the TV!  Their home was filled with all sorts of little surprises like that, that one wouldn't think of needing -- but comes in handy.  Thanks for thinking ahead, Lene & Johnny, and providing such a comfortable space to enjoy Seattle!  

Highly recommend this location!  Walking distance to a plethora of restaurants for brunch or dinner, and the Madison Park Beach which is an incredible view.  "
1042022,49774596,2015-10-06,13750538,Jacky,"Lene & Johnny were great hosts. They were responsive and left goodies for us (my gf & I) to enjoy during our trip. The property itself was in a great location. Right outside of downtown and literally next to Lake Washington. The flat was the perfect size, enough to stretch out but not so big that it felt empty.  I would recommend booking this location if you're going to be in the Seattle area, especially if you'll be renting a car. That way you'll avoid the pricey downtown parking while still being centrally located.    "
1042022,51152479,2015-10-18,10879169,David,"Nice place, great neighborhood (with a tennis court a few doors away!). Lene was very welcoming and showed us around. We weren't around much, so we didn't see much of them. But it was all good. It's a good price for that part of town. "
1042022,52287476,2015-10-27,10196458,Emily,"Lene is a great host and has thought of everything you could need from fresh ground coffee and late night snacks to beach towels and umbrellas - a Seattle staple. It doesn't get a lot of daylight unfortunately but all the more reason to get out and explore the wonderful neighborhood. I never had trouble with parking and enjoyed walking to dinner and biking down to Seward Park. I appreciate the European style which reminded me of some of my stays on the continent earlier this year. Just bring some earplugs if you're sensitive to noise, as you can hear footsteps from the main house above."
1042022,53291534,2015-11-07,9411229,Annabelle,Lene and Johnny's place was wonderful. I'd recommend to anyone looking for a cozy place located outside the bustle of downtown Seattle. Located in a beautiful neighborhood and a few blocks from Lake Washington. Communication was easy and Lene was very helpful. Great place!
7483750,39712218,2015-07-25,39201926,Michelle,"Lars waited us for arrive at 4pm, where we met his two doggies and discussed our plans for the evening. He has a beautiful place and we had a great time discussing Italy. Thanks!"
7483750,40045447,2015-07-27,4673081,Guillaume,"Lars was super nice and friendly. He gave me directions and was always present to help me. The house was easy to find, behind a small vegetation wall. The room was bright and clean and once again our host was great : easy going, eager to please us and smiling."
7483750,40545422,2015-07-31,39873993,Graham,Lars is a great host - very concerned with your happiness and comfort. The space is large and has plenty of room. Very comfortable and usable. The space is exactly as described. The place is in a very quite neighborhood that is close and convenient to many prominent areas with easy access to both the local neighborhood as well as the freeway.  
7483750,40670394,2015-08-01,7657221,Alex,"Lars was ready for me when I got there and was a great host. We also had a nice conversation about sailboats and he was helpful to recommend a book to me, and let me use his copy during my stay. His space was spacious and comfortable. "
7483750,41142524,2015-08-04,12656361,Erin,"The pictures were accurate in displaying this airbnb. For what we paid, it fulfilled our expectations. Lars was a kind host, and gave us the privacy we needed for a weekend getaway. Some things to note was that there were no curtains to the window adjacent to the bed so we were very self conscious at night when the lights were on. As well, the shower and toilet pressure were low, and the place itself was ""rustic"" and slightly older. Furthermore, it was very HOT with only a very small fan to move around the air. All in all, it was a good location for a cheap price. "
7483750,41466092,2015-08-07,35508383,Jie,Lars特别热情好客，易于沟通，由于火车晚点，他还特意去火车站接我们到他家。Lars是个爱护动物和保护环境的实践者。他的家比图片看起来更惬意舒适，空间很大，洗手间就在房间里，厨房里有我们需要的一切，整个房间设施完备方便。社区很安静，房子周围都是树木，每天早上看到窗前的绿意，还有蜂鸟、小猫，真是很可爱。lars家的两条狗很友善，每天我们做饭的时候他们都不愿意离开厨房。Lars家距离公交车站需要走十来分钟，一英里左右有wholefoods，咖啡馆，书店。总之，在Lars家住很舒适惬意，我强力推荐喜欢安静社区的朋友们住他家。
7483750,41680293,2015-08-08,8535671,Shawn,The listing is exactly as described.  Very quiet neighborhood and the host is very accommodating.  It was very nice having a separate entrance to the room from outside so we could leave early in the morning and not have to worry about waking anyone up.  The only down side is the front of the house looks a bit like a jungle (lots of trees) so you can't really see the house from the street.  However the host did meet us in the street upon arriving to make it easier.  
7483750,42742267,2015-08-15,17051413,Tanya,"Lars place was quite spacious with a wonderful large bath and many windows and in a great location. It is located close to the city yet tucked away in a nice and safe residential area with many trees.  Lars was very welcoming and kind.  Supposedly Lars has 2 roomates but it felt quite private as we never saw them in passing and Lars was rarely home.  The only things that was an issue for us was that the place was very dusty and had quite a few spiders and spider webs but Lars reassured us that he would be hiring new housekeepers.  The toilet also had issues but I believe he mentioned he replaced that as well.  With that said all else was exactly what we were looking for and I would highly recommend his place to those traveling the Seattle area.  A very reasonable price for what you get!! While in town I did work some late evenings but tried to return to his home very quietly and hoping it did not disturb anyone.  No one woke as far as I knew.  Being hosts in Maui ourselves we wanted to express our gratitude and did so by spoiling Lars with a $30 tip,  we brought him a tiki mug and chocolate covered macadamia nuts from Maui.  Plus we got him 2 chairs for his patio and left him 2 ponchos for guests to utilize when it rains.  We ended up checking out early but for no other reason other than my daughter and her friend flew into town from Chicago to surprise me and we had to get a hotel that would accommodate 4 people.  I was grateful that Lars did not make us feel bad for doing so.  
Thank You Lars for having us in your home!!"
7483750,43582583,2015-08-20,1890955,Kristina,"The room was just as described and Lars as a welcoming host. The room as a private entrance through some beautiful trees and everything you need is within the suite, minus the kitchen which is the first room in the main part of the house. "
7483750,43875624,2015-08-22,1000194,Claire," Lars welcomed us like old friends! We were right at home with the chirping chickadees who also greeted us upon arrival.The  house is a red wood ark with Japanese flavors nestled in a leafy bird sanctuary. Lars immediately steered us
to a lovely exploration of the Fremont area with simple driving directions and a\lovely dinner at Vios A local eatery within walking distance.  The neighborhoodis low key and residential,  about a mile from the University area and Greenwood Park. In the morning  we chatted with Lars for nearly and hour and a half --he
so kindly gave us the fixings for breakfast and the use of his kitchen.  Unusual artwork graces the walls and there are lovely touches like handmade soaps in the bathroom and a shoji screen in the sleeping/ living area. We will definitely
stay in touch with Lars as we connected with him genuinely.  if you are looking for a unique space, with a kind exuberant host this is he place for you."
7483750,44035743,2015-08-23,22736505,Ioana,"Serene neighbourhood, just a short drive away from dt Seattle. The host, Lars, was welcoming and friendly. Showed us around the place and had guidebooks and suggestions on what to visit. 

The airbnb room is just like the photos situated in a quaint, rustic house with lots of nature around. There's a private entrance to the private room and bathroom. We only stayed for one night so we didn't used the kitchen nor laundry facilities. However, they were there. Only downside is that the water pressure in the shower was very, very low. "
7483750,44496787,2015-08-26,40738789,Willem,"We had a great stay in Ravenna! Lars was a lovely host who even picked us up from the bus stop. We came without a car and it was a direct ride from downtown with public transport but a bit slow. The area itself Ravenna/Green Lake was lovely. The house itself was great, maybe even prettier than in the photos, with a beautiful view of the mini forest around it and lots of birds! A great bath, a shelf of nice books to read, herbal teas to drink, a private entrance and quite spacious. Lars was gracious about us coming with 2 kids, we brought our own travels cots and bedclothes for them. We would look forward to staying there again."
7483750,44740817,2015-08-28,7655527,Rachel,The room had a nice feel and was perfect for our night in Seattle. We walked to a great Thai restaurant and icecream store not far from the room. Lars gave us a great recommendation on the neighborhood Greek restaurant/book store and pub. 
7483750,44835675,2015-08-29,10451318,Katie,"We had an exceptional experience.  Lars is a very warm and friendly host, and clearly invested time in making us feel welcome, from leaving tea for our arrival to offering access to his laundry room.  A delight!"
7483750,45292057,2015-09-01,39971088,Yuehui,everything was smooth. i really enjoyed our  little private space while we were in Seattle. Lars was kind and The room was nice too! it has its private entry and is hidden in the trees so that people cant see you from outside. 
7483750,45537250,2015-09-03,5870914,Paul,Lars was so quick to respond to my request and very accommodating to our needs. I reserved from out of town for my son who was in town and Lars contacted him and set up the check in almost immediately. The room was just as advertised and was a great respite from the city while still convenient for everything. Really great price for the quality of the place and the level of service.
7483750,45828747,2015-09-06,2411395,Wendy,"Lars is a happy, go lucky guy and staying at his place was easy and worked out well.  The had character and for our brief stay didn't need to be anything spectacular but it was a nice, quiet respite from the day.  Very private and treed in (like Lars said it would be) so somewhat challenging to find at night but he was easy to get a hold of and even had some light drinks and apples in the room.  Parking was on the street but a nice neighborhood and quiet.  Shower/bath was cute."
7483750,46066422,2015-09-07,3070192,Fellipe,"Lars owns a very nice cottage tucked in behind many trees. It's full of character and charm. Although connected to the main house, it is very quiet and private. Lars was very attentive and courteous and I could highly recommend his spot. "
7483750,46510624,2015-09-11,41037851,Stephen,"The space was exactly as described.  Our first time in Seattle, my wife and I enjoyed staying here in a nice neighborhood experiencing life as a local.  The room was comfortable, we didn't need any a/c and the bathroom was nice and clean.  This was our first Airbnb experience and we will do again.  If ever in Seattle we would certainly consider Lars again.  "
7483750,46833066,2015-09-13,43719893,Nicolee,Wonderful place. Loved the restful rad of the place.  highly recommend
7483750,47230982,2015-09-16,6300429,Nicolas,"Lars is a really nice host, very welcoming, very interested in discussing with his guests. On the arrival in the morning, he showed us everything we needed to know in the house (except which plates, pans, etc. we could use in the kitchen as his flatmate Alla also lives in the house and has her own things). Later in the afternoon, Lars came back and we discussed about history, present politics, life in Seattle and London and Paris, so we had an interesting talk!
The room is really nice and you do feel at home with some tea, mugs, plates etc and a kettle. The bed is comfortable. It doesn’t feel at all like being in a big city given the room is surrounded by trees (and perhaps a spider or two, but mainly birds :-) ).
One downside: the pressure of the shower is really really low, which is a shame because the bathroom is amazingly beautiful.
"
7483750,47449784,2015-09-18,1679377,Justin,Very much enjoyed the room. Lars was a great host!! 
7483750,47584598,2015-09-20,29947019,Cassandra,"Lar's was great. He was attentive, and on-top of all our communication. Although I never met Lar's in person, he made sure we felt welcome. The place was indeed in a small forest on the corner of an urban setting. It was warm, cozy, and a great place to stay. "
7483750,47829664,2015-09-21,418320,Earl,The room is much larger than advertised.  There is plenty of sunlight.  The entrance is secluded but easily accessed.  There is plenty of parking available.  Lars is a great host.  He welcome me warmly and showed me where everything was.  I would not hesitate to stay there again.
7483750,48336840,2015-09-25,44284350,Jose,This is my first time using Airbnb and was excellent. Lars our host welcomed us and gave us a tour of the room and the kitchen.  The house is pretty much a forest! The neighborhood is super quiet and there are excellent restaurants and pubs a few blocks away. Lars is a very pleasant gentleman and made us feel like home. His two dogs are a blast too! The bed was comfy and overall is a very nice area if you need a quiet restful night.
7483750,48921005,2015-09-29,43459799,Pattraphol,My experience staying at Lars' place is amazing! He's so nice and kind. The room looks even better in person than in the photos. I would definitely book the place again in the future.
7483750,49245248,2015-10-02,43459799,Pattraphol,Lars is such a great host! He made us feel really comfortable and right at home. The room looks even better in person. Everything about the place is just great. It's so close to UoW. The view and the trees surrounding the house is incredible. Will definitely come back when we visit Seattle again.
7483750,49692320,2015-10-05,27853760,Shelby,The house and neighborhood were beautiful! This place really is a pleasant little forest gets away in the middle of the city (we saw so many birds and critters just sitting on the porch). Lars was very polite and helpful and we loved our stay! 
7483750,49963996,2015-10-07,45785271,Tasha,Lars was a great host. The place is really great feels like a cottage in the woods but in city. Was very clean and private. Thanks for a great stay.
7483750,52032574,2015-10-25,40294071,Kasper,Very friendly host!
7483750,52463388,2015-10-29,4881884,Colin,"Lars' place was very nice and felt like a home inside a forest, surrounded by trees.  He greeted me that evening to ensure that everything was ok and that I had what I needed.  Communication was great as well.  I liked the private entrance to the room and it had an attached bathroom.  Both were clean and the home was quiet.  Lots of space too!  I would stay again.  Thanks!"
7483750,52635562,2015-10-31,4813701,Markie,"Lars was a very inviting host. he met me at the door and gave me the run down of where everything was. The neighborhood was quiet, it was the perfect wilderness getaway. I will stay here on my next visit! Communication was speedy and concise."
7483750,53030470,2015-11-03,47752713,Tristan,"The neighborhood is very quiet, and has fast access to highways. If you are new to Seattle, Lars has prepared ample resources such as guide books for you as references. The room is well-equipped, and there is a Japanese folding screen to block the french window if you need extra privacy."
7483750,53500673,2015-11-09,13578376,Kris,"Despite the cautions, I had no trouble finding Lar's home.  It is, indeed, surrounded by trees and bird feeders.  The whole neighborhood, which is a lovely residential area, is filled with all kinds of flora.  It is a short walk to cafes, restaurants and a grocery store. The room was as pictured and included coffee/tea provisions, snacks and shampoo.  Lars provided a fan, a heater and a screen for the window.  The bed was very comfortable and the linens are good quality. He was welcoming, cheerful, and efficient. I thought I had locked myself out one night and, he was completely relaxed about it.  I may return to Seattle on occassion and, I will stay at Lar's place again."
7483750,53723938,2015-11-11,47597646,John,"Lars greeted us warmly, the list was accurate, good location to the UW, safe neighborhood."
7483750,54211745,2015-11-16,6662893,Clint,"Lars was very friendly and gave me lots of good ideas to get started, based on what I was interested in.  He was willing to spend the time to get me oriented on the first day, and he didn't bother me after that :)  Exactly what I was looking for.

The place itself was just as advertised.  The bathroom was especially well-crafted and interesting (in a good way).  I would absolutely stay here again."
7483750,54472734,2015-11-20,48275216,Steven,Lars' house was a lovely place to stay. Our interaction was short but he was friendly and kind. He recommended a great place to grab food as we arrived late and hungry. I would definitely stay here again if given the chance. 
7483750,54544280,2015-11-21,40234116,Roberta,"We were welcomed by our sweet host...Lars is very accommodating. The room is clean, comfortable and spacious. We also liked how private the room is. We will be back!"
7483750,54670440,2015-11-22,45249334,Yukun,"Lars was a very nice host and gave us a lot of information about the location in advance so we found the neighborhood exactly. The room is spacious and  cozy, great location and but quiet at night, good for rest. We'll be back again."
7483750,54808484,2015-11-23,4359532,Roseanne,"Lars is a good host, friendly and thoughtful. The cottage is nice and spacious, with pretty wood paneling, a lovely picture window and sweet art. I found the bed a little too firm for my tastes, but enjoyed the big bath tub with it's attractive blue tiling. We couldn't get the little heater working and so were a bit chilly until we warmed up happily in the bath. The location is excellent, with great cafes and restaurants and Third Place Books very close by."
7483750,54950670,2015-11-25,45948997,Tina,Lars was a perfect host! The room is spacious and comfortable! He even provides a microwave and small fridge! iT is a sweet neighborhood and I felt right at home! Lars showed me around the neighborhood and even picked me up when I got lost getting there by public transit. Highly recommend!
7483750,55319222,2015-11-29,25460914,Sabrina,Wonderful place to stay! Lars was very welcoming and very flexible about check in time which was very appreciated because of our late arrival. The room was private and had everything you could need and more. Great location. Would definitely return and strongly recommend! 
7483750,55705340,2015-12-04,50323780,Leighland,"Beautiful space, very comfy and warm. Quiet and peaceful neighbourhood that's still within walking distance of the main university strip. Lars really makes you feel at home and is can tell you anything you want to know about what to see/do in Seattle."
7483750,55814158,2015-12-06,48245720,Kyunghee,"Lars house was great and cozy! I really like his house. While we stayed he help us as much as he can. And it was very helpful.
His dog is very friendly and lovely!
I really want to stay there again.

집은 깨끗하고 조용한편이며 주택가라 아침 산책하기 좋습니다. 아주머니 아저씨가 친절하셔서 최대한도와 주시려고 하시고요. 수압이 좀 약한것과 접근성이 떨어지는게 흠이긴하나 만약 유니버시티 빌리지와 캠퍼스 위주의 여행이라면 좋은 장소입니다."
7483750,55956832,2015-12-07,40234116,Roberta,"As always, Lars was so welcoming! The room was clean and delicious chocolates were sitting on my pillows. I left and item in the room on my first visit a month ago and Lars remembered and brought it to me...I had forgotten. He is an excellent host. "
7483750,56053071,2015-12-08,1797679,Robin,Lars was very kind and helpful when I called a couple of days prior to our arrival with some wrinkles involving our ground transportation.  He gave us detailed directions on how we could find his place using public transportation. The room was warm and inviting with added niceties like a welcome chocolate on our towels and complimentary beverages in a small fridge.   
7483750,56290302,2015-12-11,48895136,Heather,"Lars has a beautiful home in a very private yard. The foliage and wildlife around his place adds a lot of peace to the experience. The bathroom was lovely, the bed was comfortable and clean. We had a great time and a great host!"
7483750,56353044,2015-12-12,48895136,Heather,Lars was a great host. Very positive stay! (:
7483750,56570034,2015-12-14,35213377,Andrea,"Lovely little neighborhood and lovely room! The bathroom was beautiful, thank you for the heater and the hospitality. Would love to stay here again. Thank you!"
7483750,56818576,2015-12-18,3095426,Amer,"Lars's room is wonderful, the pictures don't do it justice.  It's a beautiful tranquil little oasis and a great home base from which to explore Seattle's northern neighborhoods.   The room comes with a mini-fridge, a microwave and a full set of silverware which is really handy for making small lunches.  And the bath is delightfully cute.

The neighborhood is a little tucked away but you're a 15 minute walk from Whole Foods and it's a 10 minute walk from two of Seattle's most-talked about new restaurants which is kind of interesting for such a residential neighborhood.

All in all, a wonderful place.  "
7483750,57126304,2015-12-22,21019876,Katrina,"Best Airbnb I've ever had! Lars' place is the perfect getaway. It's a very nice & quiet neighborhood. My friends & I used Lyft & Uber to get back & forth from downtown -- it was very convenient & not pricey (Tip: if you have a Lyft account & you're vacationing with a friend who doesn't, invite your friend to download the app -- you get a $30 credit after their first ride, & the other person gets FIVE free rides up to $10. That's how we got around for a very cheap price). Overall, Lars' place was very homey. The room was just as described -- very spacious, cute picture window, the bathroom was beautiful, lots of storage. Looking forward to staying here again!"
7483750,57269152,2015-12-23,49219070,Yilin,"nice host, nice room!"
7483750,58008494,2015-12-31,23248635,Gina,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Lars' place.  It is so quiet and peaceful!
Bed is comfortable and hot water in bathroom is immediate!  Lots of closet and drawer space as well.  
As I came to visit family who live close by, I didn't spend any  real time in the room except for sleeping so it was perfect for my needs.
Lars welcomed me and showed me where everything is located.
I'm glad I brought my eye mask since the large picture window has no curtains and 1 shoji screen is not enough -- another one would be useful for more privacy.  
Thank you, Lars!"
7756839,42094591,2015-08-10,40733429,Jose,The airstream was clean and comfortable. Michele is very amicable and attentive and she made sure I had everything I needed. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
7756839,42617451,2015-08-14,32226504,Aleks,"Michele and Denny are amazing hosts. Despite my travel delays Michele was there to help me get settled down and figure my way around. Would definitely recommend trying the eggs, muffins, and the chocolate chip cookies. 

The air streamer is great. Very comfortable and an amazingly unique experience.  Look forward to my next Seattle adventure."
7756839,43162798,2015-08-17,40894910,Robert,"Great hosts, perfect location and the Airstream is super comfortable.  We will be staying here again."
7756839,43848398,2015-08-22,17014603,Virginia,"Michel and Denny were wonderful, attentive hosts. Michele gave me a thorough walk-through of the Airstream and even had a fresh treat waiting when we arrived!  The location is within walking distance of several small eateries and very close to more in both Fremont and Wallingford.  A clean, quiet and comfortable place to stay!  "
7756839,44212473,2015-08-24,40901628,Randi,They made us feel very welcome and we're extremely helpful with anything we needed. Definitely reccomend!!
7756839,44697749,2015-08-28,15194616,William,"Michele and Denny were really great. Easy to set up and get into the Airstream, which was really cool and a fun place to stay. Lots of great restaurants, shops and bars within walking distance...I would highly recommend the Airstream if you are traveling to Seattle."
7756839,46019468,2015-09-07,11548519,Amy,Great experience.  The airstream was cozy and in such a perfect location.  We were able to walk everywhere yet sleep in a quiet neighborhood. Michele and Denny were super sweet and helpful.  This was a great experience.
7756839,47280677,2015-09-17,17014603,Virginia,"This is my second stay at this location.  Michele and Denny are very helpful and welcoming, and easy to reach with any questions about the area or help you may need.  I highly recommend them as hosts!  It is a peaceful location even though it is near convenient bus lines and shops, and the Airstream is cozy even when it is raining."
7756839,48550612,2015-09-27,17014603,Virginia,Always enjoy staying with Michele and Denny as hosts.  They are very helpful and available for questions.  This is definitely a comfortable and convenient summer location!
7756839,51188694,2015-10-18,3077984,Rachel,Michele and Denny were incredible hosts! They made us feel at home and were so accommodating. They had great suggestions for great food and provided a delicious local treat when we arrived. The trailer was darling and had everything we needed. We will definitely be back when we return to Seattle! 
7756839,51669403,2015-10-22,42395583,Jordan,Michele and Denny were excellent hosts! Very accommodating and friendly and they even invited me over for dinner. The Airbus was very comfortable and I could come and go as I please with no issue. I would definitely stay here again. 
7756839,53007190,2015-11-03,46986342,Chris,Our hosts Denny and Michele could not have been any more friendly and accommodating. They are spot on with their airbnb description and the Fremont area is a great place to visit with much culture to absorb. I would recommend any and everyone to stay in this awesome Airstream and great environment. A very clean and kept up property with a nice hang out area and drive way to park in. Never once did we feel uncomfortable or have any complaints what so ever. They have mastered their role as airbnb hosts!
3770248,17601580,2014-08-14,337540,Mislav,"The place was really easy to find and close to bus stations coming from downtown/Capitol Hill. The University town nearby is a nice place to take walks around. The building was really quiet, except of course for the garbage truck each morning, but that was indicated in the listing and I didn't mind much either way. Beds are comfortable, but wifi signal not strong enough for anything more substantial than checking messages. I never met my host in person but she helped me out over intercom whenever I had questions."
3770248,17903015,2014-08-18,19597828,Joy,"The location of this place was great, near UW and lots of shops/cafes/restaurants within walking distance. There's a bus stop right around the corner. I never met Melissa in person, but she was accommodating about early check-in. 

The place was large (w/walk-in closet) and mostly clean and quiet. There was a used/cracked bar of soap in the bathtub and a previous guest's food was still in the fridge. The studio is in the back of the building, facing a parking lot. The garbage truck woke me up around 5:30 am once during my stay. 

If you're looking for a convenient, affordable place to stay near UW, this fits the bill.
"
3770248,28924787,2015-04-01,20486946,Peggy,Melissa was helpful and answered all our questions promptly. The space worked well for our needs.
3770248,42378721,2015-08-13,29221545,Julie,"The location of the apartment is in a prime spot next to the university, which is beautiful and a major landmark in the city. The University District always has a lot going on, which made it a great location in the city for the summer. There were tons of restaurants on the Ave and downtown was just a quick bus ride away. 

In addition, this apartment is located just one or a few blocks away from bus stops that can take you to all the popular neighborhoods within the city, such as Fremont, Capitol Hill, Ballard, East Lake, South Lake Union, Seattle Center, and Pike/Pine.

The apartment itself is clean and well laid out. No repairs needed to be made to the apartment during our three months there. Melissa is responsive to any texts or calls that we had about the apartment. 

The kitchen is small but well equipped for any food that you would want to cook. The beds are also comfortable but be warned that the couch is not comfortable enough for someone to sleep on. The closet is massive and will be able to hold all your clothes for sure as two of us kept all our clothes we needed for three months in it. The bathroom is small but had enough storage space. Shower has good water pressure and we never ran out of hot water like the listing had warned us. The neighbors are also quiet and friendly.

The dump truck mentioned in a previous post is a real concern if you are not a heavy sleeper. It came for us only once a week early in the morning so it wasn't as big of a concern for us but it is loud as the apartment window is directly above the dumpster.

Melissa also helped us get parking spots for our time at the apartment. This was crucial for us because parking is especially difficult and expensive in the city of Seattle. Since we were there for three months, it was very assuring that we had safe, affordable, and accessible spots for the whole time there.

The good stuff. The apartment is very near to the university of washington. It was clean, has adequate parking and melissa was friendly enough. The not so good thing. The apartment needs a television and some minor maintenance. The kitchen tap handle was detached as was the door handle of the bed room. It was a rather old apartment."
8616488,51241097,2015-10-18,3076561,Liz,"Roy was helpful, friendly & responsive. His place was clean & conveniently located to grocery stores, restaurants & was directly on the bus line into downtown."
8616488,52180899,2015-10-26,37707766,Nicole,"Roy was very nice & greeted me with keys to the apartment. He showed me around & after leaving was quick to respond to any of my questions or messages. The apartment was in immaculate condition...super clean in a very modern building!!! Furthermore, the location could not be ANY better. Was a short walk to Capitol Hill & Downtown....sights, shopping, etc. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks Roy!!! :)"
8616488,53527435,2015-11-09,16257653,Jean,"We can not say enough good things about Roy. First, he is a great guy and very knowledgable . We have our best experiences with nice folks. Roy was very accommodating about showing us around, making suggestions, telling us about the building, neighborhood, everything!! Despite being late he waited to welcome us. 

Now for the apartment not only location, location, location but a wonderful place. The photos do not do it justice. Plus it is very, very clean. Book with Roy you will not be disappointed in him , his lovely flat or the neighborhood. Roy is a great host.  ️️️️️ We will be back! Jean, Abby and Sean "
8616488,53773999,2015-11-12,9844022,Lisa,"Roy was a great host and was extremely accommodating. He gave me a thorough tour of the place and made me feel very welcome. The place was spacious, clean, and just as described. The wifi was solid and there was an Apple TV with alot of options to watch. There was also a nice balcony overlooking Cap Hill. Thanks for a great stay!"
8616488,54269498,2015-11-17,47005785,Michael,Roy was welcoming and made arrangements for easily checking in. He also made himself available should any issues arise. The location was great and within walking distance to much of what the city has to offer. The condo is located in a quiet yet central location that is perfect for visitors on business or pleasure. I would recommend this unit to anyone and I would definitely stay here again. 
8616488,54885897,2015-11-25,38516133,Kate,The host was very welcoming and this is an excellent location. The place is quiet and clean.

8616488,55958949,2015-12-07,3869437,Jesus,"Absolutely loved staying in this cute apartment. My partner and I had a great time. It was locally perfectly. Away from tourist areas but close enough to them to enjoy! Capitol Hill is fantastic with all kids of coffee shops, bars, and entertainment. Roy was really friendly and his apartment was immaculate. Would definitely stay again!"
8616488,56435413,2015-12-13,39881022,Joe,In a nut shell...WORST HOST EVER... Don't need to say anymore
8616488,56955045,2015-12-20,45214071,Suzanne,"Clean, convenient, and comfortable!
Roy is very accessible and personable. I asked him to change a few lightbulbs that had gone out and for a hair dryer and he took care of it right away.
I stayed there during my first week of work and it was perfect (I slept well and it was a nice place to come home to and is close to downtown).
Thanks, Roy!!"
8616488,58351887,2016-01-02,6984253,Roxanne,"Roy was a great host! He was there when I arrived and was super helpful and responsive when we had questions. The studio is exactly how he describes it and was the perfect size for the two of us! The building is safe and quiet. Capitol Hill was a great location- walking distance to food, drinks, shops, parks, busses, bars, etc. You don't need a car and there are lots of people around and things to do. We never really needed to leave the neighborhood aside from sight seeing and then renting a car and to drive out to the mountains. Overall great trip and would definitely stay at Roy's spot again if we come back!"
7163934,47838680,2015-09-21,24592862,Cecily,"My husband and I loved staying here. The suite was charming, clean, and very comfortable. The heated floor in the bathroom was a nice touch, and we even had a little private patio out back! Linda and Bob were lovely, and we especially appreciated that they let us check in early so we could drop off our things. We came home pretty late both nights, but the layout of the house made it easy to go in and out without worrying about disturbing anyone. This is also an excellent location, with lots of restaurants and other useful things within walking distance, ample parking, and easy access to bus lines. A great experience overall, and we would recommend it to anyone looking for a  temporary home base in Seattle!"
7163934,48436193,2015-09-26,30049619,Monte,"Linda and Bob were the perfect host, they treat you like family, far above and beyound what I expected. The description of the listing was under exaggerated, the location was very, very clean, with all you need to enjoy your stay"
7163934,51203797,2015-10-18,1928937,Joan,"Linda and Bob have done a beautiful remodel of their in-city suite. It's comfortable, complete, and with the added bonus of a delightful patio. Buses are very handy. Linda and Bob were wonderful hostess and host, providing advice on buses, weekend events, and even cookies!

 "
7163934,53125372,2015-11-05,44628009,Wendy,Linda and Bob were great hosts and this rental is highly recommended.  The space was perfect and beautifully decorated.  The shared entrance was very private and the keypad entry was a nice  feature.  Thank you... I will rent here again on my next visit to Seattle.
7163934,56533838,2015-12-14,19729203,Chris And Darci,"loved my stay here, I was greeted with cookies and very helpful and kind hosts. The house is in a great neighborhood and was clean and comfortable. Highly recommend a stay here."
789229,4009484,2013-04-02,5390583,Ryan,"Trong's space is fantastic. A high ceiling loft with plenty of room and lots of natural light. Great location, especially for anything at Safeco or Centurylink. His home is stylish and well appointed and Trong is a great host. "
789229,4865172,2013-05-29,948978,Kevin,"Trong was an excellent host who was in constant contact before check in, and once we checked in he left us with instructions for things around his apartment, and a full list of restaurants and various attractions around the city.  

He provided clean towels, a comfy aero-bed for the two of us along with the regular bed, a place to hang up clothes, and there was even an iron and steamer that he let me use.  We had four people and his space was huge, we never felt cramped.  

The place was walking distance to many attractions nearby, including Pikes Place, the underground tour, waterfront, and pioneer square.   We even made it out walking to the space needle one day, which surprised us, but you can get there by cab very cheaply.  If you want to make it to a sporting event, the stadiums are literally across the street.  There were two games while we were there and were not bothered, if you aren't interested in sports. "
789229,5159952,2013-06-16,2331001,Ruth,"This loft is very spacious & truly a interior designer's dream! The loft is situated on the third floor of the building with a goods lift. The loft is convenient to the train station and is approx. 3-5 minutes walk from King St station. Walkable to Chinatown, Pioneer Square and the Underground tour. 

If your a soccer or baseball fan... these sporting grounds is literally at your doorstep. We managed to see the Mariners played at the Safeco stadium during our stay and the street was filled with fans & hotdogs stands. 

Trong was a great host. He gave us lots of tips & advices to make our visit enjoyable.

If your a light sleeper, than this loft may not be for you. The window is next to the high way and can get quite noisy at night. But besides that, the loft is very spacious and it is quite hard to find a reasonable priced accommodation with lots of space in the US!"
789229,5274723,2013-06-22,5987435,Kara,"I stayed, with three of my colleagues, for a conference at the conventions centre. We didn't spend much time in the room, but there was lots of room for the four of us. The loft is convenient to the train station, lots of restaurants and city attractions. While at the room we appreciated the wifi and the tv. 
Troung was a great host and gave us helpful advice, tips and suggestions. "
789229,5469126,2013-07-01,6904794,Josh,"The Loft as a truly excellent location to stay! The description says it all. The place just looks fantastic, from the fine furniture (comfy and cool), decorations (monogrammed towel), great layout (very spacious), and  ambience created a luxury feel at an affordable
price! In addition the Loft  was just a few short  minutes from the freeway adding convenience  since  we visited nearly every part of Seattle.
While I stayed, there were two events on the field across the street and we never heard a peep out of it. Trong and his sister were great hosts, they were in contact with us before and after the stay but didn't bother us during. 
A++"
789229,5752837,2013-07-15,1118147,Alejandro,"The loft is located in a very convenient place for us (near the train station and Pioneer Square), but the noise is an issue, both from the highway and construction, nothing that a good pair of ear plugs won't solve. "
789229,6170645,2013-08-02,5538989,Francesco,"Excellent place to stay in Seattle.  Down by the stadiums and walking distance to Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market and many other waterfront attractions Trong's loft is a great value and just a cool place to stay whether you're in town for business or vacation.  "
789229,6436016,2013-08-12,5602226,Markus,"Trong has a beautiful place and very responsive.

I would highly recommend this place!"
789229,7379212,2013-09-17,4833112,Fernando,"If you are attending a sporting event in Seattle, this is a great place to (email hidden) been to a few 49er's vs. Seahawk games and it was really a great experience stepping outside the front door and being at the stadium. Next time I'm visiting, I'll be staying here again. "
789229,7628287,2013-09-27,3016630,Antoinette,"Trong's place was awesome! A beautiful loft close to Pioneer Square and just a few steps away from the light rail (which was super helpful to get to where I needed to be). I felt safe in the apartment and really enjoyed having a little life in his awesome pad for a full week. He's prepared for pretty much every thing (instructions, ear plugs and all)! Much better than being a 'tourist.' "
789229,8906749,2013-11-25,712965,Aiden,"Trong's place is awesome. It's definitely the authentic Pioneer Square experience - old factory type building from another era converted to lofts with a view out to the (always surprisingly aesthetically pleasing) industrial district. 

Trong is also very easy to communicate with and was responsive anytime we had a question."
789229,10433115,2014-02-18,11824393,Dominic,"Trong's place was great. Perfect location right near Pioneer Square and a quick walk to the market. The place itself was beautiful and comfortable. Clean, open, spacious and really nicely furnished. He was very flexible and accommodating with the key pick up. A great place to stay."
789229,11203404,2014-03-24,12927056,Daniel,"Trong's place was awesome. Great location—walking distance to downtown Seattle. It was really well decorated, very spacious and modern. Trong was great. He was ready to meet us when we got there, and saw us off early the day of our flight."
789229,12285077,2014-04-28,13157434,Erin,"My first experience with Airbnb, and it was exactly what I'd hoped for. I wanted to feel like I was ""in"" the city and able to walk everywhere I needed to go. We had a lovely stay at Trong's loft in Pioneer Square. His place is very spacious and nicely decorated with lots of interesting little details. Trong met us at the loft and gave a thorough rundown of everything we needed to know. He left us ear plugs (so thoughtful) which blocked out some of the city noise, but we did still get some midnight serenades from the music studio on the floor above the loft. My parents dropped by while we were staying and my dad enjoyed kicking back in the mid-century recliner and admired the ""wide open spaces"" in the loft. ;) The location was fantastic, though parking was tricky, especially on game days. In retrospect, we could have done just as well with Light Rail and Uber, so skipping the car altogether isn't a bad idea. All in all, a great stay and a very pleasant experience with our host. "
789229,13424596,2014-05-27,2319344,Ella,"Trong was a great host - very responsive with communicating and generous with his apartment - he even offered us some pizza when we arrived!  I love the apartment's decor, and the location was great for exploring Seattle.  Everything was very comfortable, and we especially loved the video projector for watching TV!  Trong provided a list of recommendations for local restaurants and sights, which was very helpful.  If you are a jet-lagged visitor to his apartment like we were, Zeitgeist, home of delicious coffee, is nearby and open from 6am.  Thanks for everything, Trong!"
789229,14232408,2014-06-15,3490215,Sherm,"Trong's place is special in several ways.  It is a 1400 square-foot MAN'S ""man cave"" with a digital light TV projector slamming a gigantic 8x4.5 foot HD picture against the wall.  His leather chairs and couch are polished with pure testosterone.  His unit is directly across the street from Century Link field's south endzone goal line; one block from left field, third-base line entries to Safeco field.  The bed was very comfortable. I was home after the games having a glass of wine before most people were out of the parking lot.  Parking, now there's a an issue on game days.  If you happen to be returning to the apartment around dinnertime when Mariners are playing a night game, you may have an adventure getting back to the building.  The street fills with food vendors and cops limit traffic. Just turn on the charm and tell them where you're staying and they'll let you through but good luck finding a place to park.
His place is about four blocks from the Stadium light rail station and four blocks the other direction to the King Street Amtrak station.

Now this review comes to a bit of a dichotomy.  My wife did not see all the charm I did.  She says:
""The stove top and oven were so greasy I was afraid I'd start a fire if I cooked anything.  The bottoms of the skillets were burned."" (From my perspective, did that matter? We ate out every night.) ""The bathroom sink cracked (repaired but cracked) the faucets were surrounded by rusty gunk.  The shower floor was dirty and had no drain cover."" (Obviously women place higher premiums on some things than men.) She was also worried about the safety of the neighborhood but a friendly cop explained that it really was very safe.

Bottom line: I would stay there again, alone.  No way she would ever go back.

789229,14605769,2014-06-23,3063946,Oliver,Trongs apartment is conveniently located near the King Street station and CenturyLink field. Excellent coffee and restaurants are also just a short stroll away. The apartment itself is an impressive converted warehouse with high ceilings and funky decorating. Check in was simple and our stay was pleasant. The only thing to mention is if you are a light sleeper this may be a problem. The road is right outside and construction taking place. Nothing some earplugs won't fix. Also there is a music studio upstairs that cranked it's music till well into the am every night. 
789229,14869641,2014-06-28,5466851,Kristen,"I did not have the pleasure of meeting Trong, but I did however meet his sister Annie. During my our in Seattle, she was a fantastic host. Even before we arrived to the loft her communication was cordial and she always responded in a timely manner. Trong's loft is right across the street from the CenturyLink Field and was an easy walk to downtown Seattle. A great location to explore the city. We loved his projector TV and the decor of his apartment. Overall, we had a great stay and really enjoyed our time in Seattle."
789229,16561490,2014-07-29,3471131,Liz,"This loft is very comfortable. We were greeted upon arrival by Trong's sister, who was very helpful and gave us all of the information we needed.  We had a great time in Seattle, and the 3 pages of information and recommendations/instructions were extremely helpful! As were the earplugs! 

The building hosts some colorful characters....that said, despite the fact that they  party noisily till about 5 am sometimes, we were so tired from exploring the city that all we needed was a comfortable bed and the aforementioned earplugs, and we were out like lights! 

The beds are very comfortable...

The neighborhood has a reputation...Everyone we met, upon hearing where we were staying, told us to watch ourselves in that area at night. 

We had no issues, however. We did take cabs at night, to be on the safe side...and because bar hopping in heels means you are not going to walk home after about 4 hours out...saw some interesting characters...but had no real issues. 

I would book this studio again!!"

His loft is the PERFECT location right next to Centrylink Field, no better way to enjoy a game.  Walking distance to numerous bars and restaurants in Pioneer Square and just a 20-30 min walk to Pikes Place Market.   We had no issues with noise either.  We would definitely stay here again...so much better than a cramped hotel with no character! "
789229,22374209,2014-11-04,22544983,Brandon,I would highly recommend Trongs Studio apartment . It was really clean and accommodated all of our needs and hope to stay there again in the future . Thumbs up !!
789229,22646442,2014-11-11,19009221,Jason,"Best location I Seattle for a football, baseball or soccer game period!! Loved the location on a boys trip and plan on staying here again with my wife for a football or baseball game. Trongs sister Annie was awesome about getting us settled in, no bad experiences the whole weekend."
789229,23998846,2014-12-16,4226707,Benjamin,Loft was off the hook!! Even tho Niners lost we had a great time! We plan on coming up to Seattle to see more game and would most definitely use Trong's place again.
789229,28941646,2015-04-01,1276855,Matt,"We really enjoyed staying here. The apartment is so spacious, and incredibly conveniently located... close to terrific coffee (obvi), food, and the Mountains-to-Sound Greenway. Would definitely, and enthusiastically return."
789229,29874763,2015-04-13,30175886,Justine,"The stay here was so awesome, the place is great, and is very spacious. Especially for two people, had more than enough room, everything was very comfortable, and all the stuff we wanted to do in the city was very accessible from where we were. It was super cool being right next to both stadiums. I loved our stay here, and would definitely recommend staying here if your ever in the Seattle area. Trong was a great host, and we loved the new TV setup. Biggest TV ive ever seen. Super awesome place, perfect size for me and my boyfriend, and i would love to comeback."
789229,30288410,2015-04-20,27443340,Ruth,"Trong was a wonderful host - met us at the apartment and even went out of his way to secure us a great parking spot on the same block!  The location is PERFECT for games - easy walk to the stadium.  The apartment is a large and pretty cool space, although the road/city noise is a little loud at night.  "
789229,30767506,2015-04-27,27873164,Josh,"Excellent host and excellent location. Very flexible in terms of check in time and use of his space. Highly recommended.  The furniture and cleanliness were top notch.

The loft works best if you're pretty flexible in terms of accommodation - it's one big open space that is perfectly capable of accepting many people or hosting a big event. However, there is little in the way of fixed walls or dividers. It wasn't an issue for us, but if you're looking for a more traditional hotel or house like environment, this probably isn't it."
789229,31089309,2015-05-01,31997601,Cynthia,The reservation was canceled 49 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
789229,33280116,2015-05-26,681128,Deborah,"We caught Trong when he was heading out of town, but we able to meet up with him locally to get keys and do a virtual walk-through.  The loft was great, lots of character and style, and in a convenient location.  Right at the stadiums, if that's your thing, but an easy walk to Pioneer Square, the International District, and mass transport.  We were happy to find a couple non-Starbucks coffee shops close by as well as Intrigue, a newly-opened purveyor of hand-made chocolate goodies.  There was plenty of room to set up the air mattress; I got the bed, which was the comfiest I've slept in since that featherbed in Reykjavik."
789229,35084394,2015-06-15,4728394,Kayla,Our stay was absolutely wonderful!! The loft space is beautiful and felt very homey. It was also very clean and in a location that was very convenient to get around. Checking in was very easy and Trong's sister was able to meet us and accommodate a late arrival and delays! 
789229,36507515,2015-06-29,10177418,Debbie,"The host was out of town, however, he had a very lovely gal greet us and show us around.  The place was accurate as described.  We came for a concert and the location couldn't have been better and since we took the train up there from Portland, it was walking distance from the station.  I highly recommend staying here.  Only downfall was the air conditioning wasn't working but he made large fans available for us which helped!  5 stars to this guy.  We look forward to coming back if its available in the future.  Thanks Trong!"
789229,37449243,2015-07-07,29420765,George,Experience here was great. Didn't expect the weather to get so hot but left a fan in the house to get some air. Very nice and quiet place. 
789229,38989481,2015-07-20,30430573,Mike,This was the perfect place for us. Roomy and funky in a cool neighborhood. This is a fun spot in a bustling active section of Seattle. Trong's description was accurate and helpful. There were no surprises.  We would absolutely stay here again.
789229,40208915,2015-07-29,5506924,Matthew,"The Loft was wonderful!  Easily walkable to the Market, great bars and restaurants, light rail.  Trong left instructions and suggestions for sight seeing which was really helpful. He even left earplugs, which ended up being not needed because the traffic noise was easily blocked out by the fan.  Checking in and getting the keys was seamless and a snap.  I would definitely stay here again, thank you for your hospitality!"
789229,41931288,2015-08-10,31547771,Brian,Trong was a great host that showed us everything we needed to know about his loft and was very informative of it. Me and my group of 5 loved his place everything was even better than expected from the pictures. You really have to be there to experience it. Very spacious enough for even more guests and he was very accomadating having 2 queen size air mattresses for our group. Place was not as hot as the other reviewers stated as he had 2 fans circulating. Noise was not a problem for my group either.
789229,42375976,2015-08-13,28989033,Peter,"It was a pleasure to meet Trong and to stay at his wonderful loft. Trong was very amenable regarding check in and check out times, which really meant a lot to us given our slightly awkward train arrival and departure times. 

Trong's loft is very comfortable and well appointed. We especially liked the soft cotton linens and cozy down comforter on Trong's queen size bed. There's plenty of room to unpack your belongings, stretch out and get comfortable, unlike many hotels in Seattle.

Finally, there is no doubt in our minds that this is THE place to stay if you're going to events at Safeco or CenturyLink fields. It's also very well situated for easy access to the hip and happening Occidental Avenue corridor, the International District, and to Pioneer Square. Because we like to exercise, we thoroughly enjoyed the walk to the retail district and Pike Place Market.

Overall, this was a very positive stay and we thank Trong for his gracious hospitality."
789229,44217061,2015-08-24,36575919,Roman,"I stayed here with my girlfriend and another couple and it was really an ideal place for us. The apartment is beautiful and very spacious (plenty of room for four and the aerobed is pretty comfortable as far as air mattresses go). The location is also great. A quick walk to Pioneer Square, train stations, we had no trouble getting an uber, and the stadiums are spitting distance (it made me wish we had made time to see a game). 

There was a bit of noise from both traffic and the neighbors but Trong did give us a heads up so there were no surprises there. And honestly it wasn't an issue for us, we all slept great. 

Overall Trong was a great host and the place is wonderful. I would definitely stay here again!"
789229,46898001,2015-09-14,703140,Keith,"This is a great space in a great location. It's big, open, and easy to get to. Trong and I coordinated in advance and was there and ready when I showed up. I got a brief tour and he left a cheat sheet with restaurants, etc.

I was initially concerned about the stadium being next door and having a game every day but there were no issues, still easy to get around, etc."
789229,48704241,2015-09-28,39481299,Michael,"Trong was a great host. He showed us around his place the first day and stayed in contact via text for the rest of the trip. 
The loft was fantastic. Trong has a great sense of style. If you are looking to go to a game then this is definitely the place to stay. It's literally across the street from CenturyLink and within walking distance of 2 Link Light Rail stations. 
Trong provided ear plugs but they weren't needed. Either we were too tired to care about the music and traffic or we realized that it is part of the city charm. 
This was an excellent experience from start to finish. "
789229,51424715,2015-10-20,19009221,Jason,"Best place to stay while at a sporting event in Seattle period! Trong made it easy to check in and out, awesome experience"
789229,57159591,2015-12-22,22544983,Brandon,Was our second time staying at Trongs place and it didn't disappoint! Place was clean and accommodating to everything we needed. Thanks Trong for everything! 
872152,11257950,2014-03-27,1424269,David,A gem of a house in an amazing location. Chris and team communicated well and were very responsive the the couple of minor issues that came up. The whole trip went smoothly. Highly recommended.
872152,14208177,2014-06-14,2678122,Navlyn,"Gorgeous house, in a gorgeous neighborhood, it was perfect.  Awesome to have 2 separate and self contained bedroom spaces.  Chris was super easy to work with and responsive.  Would stay here again if he actually has availability (we stayed 2 weeks in a row for work)."
872152,19209577,2014-09-08,19420346,Leigh,"Apartment was beautiful and well furnished.  Great location with lots of restaurants, bars, shops, grocery store nearby.  Host was easy to contact and very accommodating. Thanks for a fantastic stay!"
872152,20946221,2014-10-08,6513037,Kj,"We loved our stay at the Artist Town House.  Everything was as advertised or even better.   It was quiet, comfortable, and a great location.  It is a couple minutes walk to Broadway and many cafes and restaurants.  The kitchen was really well equipped... way beyond our expectations.  The place is really great.  We hope we can return and stay again.  "
872152,22071112,2014-10-29,9602679,Alan,"Great Experience. The condo was as described and worked out perfect for two couples. We loved the location, close to Volunteer park for running, there is a grocery very close and plenty of cool restaurants and bars within walking distance. Checking in and out was very easy. We were a bit confused on the request for taking the garbage out to the street as both containers said recycle.  We would definitely  rent again. "
872152,23100586,2014-11-23,9851031,Tom,"Spent a full 4 weeks at this home and enjoyed every moment. Great location with walking access to everything in Capitol Hill and short walk/uber downtown. The place is super sharp, well accommodated, and Chris and his team are great hosts."
872152,25901131,2015-01-29,22885694,Tracey,The house is super neat and the staff are very friendly and welcoming. My family had a great time staying in the house. High recommended!
872152,29160290,2015-04-05,667728,Juston,"My wife, baby, and I spent a month in the Artist House and really enjoyed it!  It's a large, homey space that's in an area close to plenty of good coffee shops, bars, and restaurants.  The unit is in the back of the 4-unit complex so it's quiet and private.  

The management company that rents the property is professional and has a staff of people who are responsive and friendly.  

Definitely recommend staying here! "
872152,32632058,2015-05-19,2905480,Michael,"This was a great townhouse with a lot of character. It appears to be a fairly new building and is very clean. The location was in beautiful Capitol Hill on a very quiet street but still walking distance to bars and coffee shops. The only complaint would be that parking an SUV in the garage is a little tight, but we were able to find on-street parking just in front of the house. Highly recommended for parties of 4!"
872152,45780809,2015-09-06,7706324,Kristi,"We had an awesome time at the house, which was in a great neighborhood within walking distance of the convention center. The house was exactly as described and just as fantastic as capture in the house pictures. Chris and his staff were nice and responsive during our stay; when we arrived, the power was out because of a huge windstorm that knocked power out to large parts of Seattle and they were quick to respond and the fireplace came in handy too! We loved the house and would stay there again."
6108006,34384669,2015-06-07,13663885,Bill,"This place was the BEST! This spacious unit literally looked out over Lake Washington. Most evenings we sat out on the little deck and watched the boats cruise in and out of the little bay near Seward Park. It's in a quiet upscale neighborhood but fairly close to restaurants and ""city life"". Our host Peach was welcoming and a great communicator and made us feel welcome. The apartment itself was modern and nice. It had been recently remodeled and had everything you would expect in a home away from home. The Park Place Apartment was a real jewel!"
6108006,35399961,2015-06-18,33898863,David,"Peach and Dave were amazing host. They are fun, kind, social, and good people to be around.  The apartment is private just as described with a brand new kitchen. Everything is clean and if I needed something extra they were just a text message away, or a shout from the deck.

The location is in a safe neighborhood and within walking distance (10-15 min) to the Columbia city area where you have food options, coffee shops (visit empire), stores, and even a small movie theater.  Another 5 minute walk from that location will get you to the light rail system, which can take you downtown to pikes market, stadiums, and other attractions. The ride from Columbia city to the last stop was about 20 min.  I did not have a car during my stay but I was able to still enjoy many of settles gems by rail/bus/uber.  I would recommend this location with or without a  car, and for all types of travelers.  

Just in case you were wondering the view is really what you see in the listings. It is so beautiful and peach and dave have created a wonderful environment for air bnb travelers. I was in town for work, and some days I was too drained to chat with them, but the times I did they were super cool. I would just travel to this location to sit on the deck and hang with them :)

This is truly a gem. Peach & Dave have set the bar high for being great host and offering a peaceful rental.  I was only the 2nd renter, and I suspect this rental will become a hot commodity, so take my advice and book, there is no way you’ll be disappointed.
"
6108006,35843148,2015-06-22,34862576,Harry,"Peach and Jack were great hosts. Their newly remodeled home with a gorgeous lake view was the perfect place to relax, and get ready for another day in beautiful Seattle.  A fully-equipped kitchen, large living room, bath and bedroom were perfect, and outside, a great lake view with waiting firepit.
Thank you both for a great visit to Seattle."
6108006,36612169,2015-06-29,27798845,Jacquelyn,Peach and Dave are gracious hosts and the apartment far exceeds the provided description.  Our experience was wonderful.  Can't wait to return.
6108006,38537340,2015-07-16,37171208,John,"This stay at Peach and Dave's apt was wonderful. From the beginning we felt so relaxed to be in this area. We slept so well for the first time in awhile (been on the road). Peach made us feel like old friends. 
Everything in this apt stay was accurate and as good or even better than listed. Really friendly dog. 
The neighborhood is quite nice, great views, walks down to the beach. Thank you. 
"
6108006,39036605,2015-07-20,35819803,Kirsten,"Our experience was completely positive. Peach and her husband Dave kindly made the apartment available to us early on the day we arrived, which was much appreciated since we had flown in from Ohio and had been awake since 3:00 am our time.
The apartment is just as advertised. The furniture and bed are quite comfortable, the bathroom large and well-stocked. The patio overlooking Lake Washington is fabulous - always a cool breeze, and well shaded by a lovely fig tree."
6108006,40241700,2015-07-29,27798845,Jacquelyn,"Exceeded expectations.  Great, as always!"
6108006,40753233,2015-08-02,11429788,Rebecca,Beautiful location. This is the downstairs apartment to the spectacular upstairs home.
6108006,41248776,2015-08-05,5032958,David,"Our stay was simply perfect. The apartment is spacious, clean, comfortable and has everything you need. The view is amazing - we loved just walking out of the door and sitting on the terrace. So quiet and peaceful. We slept well and were totally relaxed after our busy downtown trips.
Peach and Dave are really friendly and helpful, we enjoyed our conversations.
The neighborhood is wonderful quiet and you can easily go for a walk or run around the sea.
Public transportation is doable, but having a car is a lot more convenient.
Highly recommended!"
6108006,41787920,2015-08-09,343983,Holly,We had a very nice stay at Peach's apartment. The setting is quiet and peaceful with a super view and nice outdoor areas. Kitchen is nicely stocked and the bed is comfy. Peach was available if needed but otherwise just let us do our thing. This is a great find!
6108006,42423679,2015-08-13,8266165,Simon,We had a lovely stay at Peach and Dave's place in Seattle. Very welcoming hosts and a lovely location.
6108006,44689342,2015-08-28,37358484,Nisha,"My son and stayed here while we were in Seattle on our way to his University in Canada. I chose the apartment because it is close to my sister. I can honestly say that I have never been happier with a choice I made online. 
The pictures do not do justice to the apartment, it is indeed far more lovely than expected and they do not convey the beauty and peace of the surroundings. The view alone is a balm in itself. 
Peach and Dave were wonderful, considerate hosts who went out of their way to accommodate my son and I, providing us with a very comfortable additional bed for him.  In fact everything they provided was of excellent quality down to the dish soap. The groceries Peach provided on my request were perfect and what I would have chosen myself. Quite a rare occurrence. 
We even had a great liming partner periodically when their very sweet dog Skye would visit. 
All in all it was a great experience and one I would repeat in a heartbeat. I cannot recommend it enough. "
6108006,45151841,2015-08-31,22843891,Thai-Ngan,"Peach was very responsive to my emails and questions and the place is just as described when we arrived. The unit is a very bottom (basement floor) to a big house, but we had our own private entrance through the garden with our own deck that overlooks the lake just like what you see in the photo (I think some strung lights would make the deck even more wonderful!) It was very nice to come back to that view after a day of exploring sipping a glass of wine. Since the unit was below the house, footsteps/noise above echoed down, but it was to be expected with the layout of the house. 

The neighborhood was quiet with a lot of street parking and Peach was there to greet us and pleasantly showed us around, but gave us complete privacy otherwise. A great find. "
6108006,45431470,2015-09-02,37358484,Nisha,I returned to the Park Place apartment for another much shorter stay after accompanying my son to University. It was like returning to a little oasis of peace with the gorgeous view and caring friendliness of my hosts Peach and Dave.  I enjoyed it very much and left feeling refreshed and invigorated for my long trip home. I would return gladly any time and recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone!
6108006,46744002,2015-09-13,40772174,Barbara,"This apartment was perfect for our week long visit in Seattle!!!  It's centrally located, peaceful and tranquil, private, convenient to downtown, the airport, groceries, etc.  Peach and Dave were gracious hosts and even allowed us to borrow some lawn chairs for a concert where we had lawn seats!!!  

We spent every day seeing the tourist sites and exploring the great outdoors - whale watching, Mount Rainier, Cascade Loop, waterfront, harbor cruise, aquarium, Space Needle, Chihuly museum, EMP, wineries, casinos, Chittendam locks, fish ladders, live music, open mics, concerts and the Fremont troll.  So many amazing sites to see and this apartment was a great home base!!!"
6108006,47429360,2015-09-18,364570,Vasili,"Peach was a very personable and caring host and this was a great little apartment. I had to commute to Bellevue daily and I-90 access was very easy. Capitol hill was also very easy to access. I made good use of Seward park and lake Washington being minutes away, it was a perfect spot for running and swimming in the early hours of the morning before heading out to work. My sleep schedule was about the same as the hosts' so light noises coming from morning activity in the house upstairs did not bother me."
6108006,48809137,2015-09-28,22387204,Cisco,Peach and Dave's place is great! I rented the apartment for my mother and sister who were traveling to visit from Colorado and they loved every minute of their stay. The views from the outdoor patio are amazing. Lake Washington and Seward Park are only a couple blocks away! The apartment is on a very quiet street and the surrounding neighborhood is great! Very up and coming with some great new restaurants and bars very close. I will definitely be using Peach again when we have family traveling this way. 
6108006,49509753,2015-10-04,44377591,Paul,"Peach has a lovely home with a picturesque overlook of Seward Park. She made me feel very welcome in the apartment and her advert accurately describes the unit's features. There was a very helpful folder inside the house that clearly defined the various house rules and policies, as well as informed of various local facilities such as local hospitals, fire departments, police, grocery, recreation, etc. My visit was in October/2015 and it was a touch cold in general inside the apartment for my girlfriend, but the provided space heater and available extra blankets did the trick for us. The neighborhood near the home and surrounding waterfront is nice and quiet, however more toward the center of Columbia City it gets a bit more urban/run down. Not a ton to do in this area anyway, but there are some good eats! On that note, I had rented a car and found that just about any part of the furthest reaches of all of Seattle was about 15-30 minute drive at most. Downtown is 10-20 mins tops. All in all a very pleasant, private, and streamlined experience. I would recommend! "
6108006,50212660,2015-10-10,19010662,Alexander,"Peach was very friendly and welcoming. The view was amazing and the apartment is super comfortable and cozy. The neighborhood is safe, quiet, and located next to the scenic Seward Park."
6108006,52320283,2015-10-28,42939176,Nicole,"Peach has a lovely home.  She and her family were very welcoming and I felt completely comfortable.  The view of Lake Washington was amazing .  Her listing accurately describes the units features there was a welcome packet that very clearly laid out the house rules.  The full functioning kitchen was awesome.  I mostly commuted to and from work each day so I didn't get a ton of time to explore the area.  However, lovely Seward Park was in walking distance and I thoroughly enjoyed spending time there.  I would definitely recommend to all and would love to stay at Park Place again when I am back in the are.  Thanks Peach. "
6108006,53925219,2015-11-14,31897747,Nicolas,"Our stay was just the most wonderful we ever had at an AirBnb place ! Everything was fabulous from before arrival to after ! You made it the perfect experience for our travel. 

The view from the appartment is incredible and exactly as pictured on AirBnb: lake + trees. The location is nice and very close to downtown Seattle. Plus, the area sounds very safe. 

Peach prepared a crib for our newborn twins before our late night arrival, which was just absolutely awesome. 

We definitely recomend your home for a short or a long stay, we will also certainly come back ! Thank You ! "
2215336,16111884,2014-07-22,16942779,Liz,"Everything was great. The house was really nice and in a very cute neighborhood. Coordinating/check-in/etc. was all very smooth and easy. I didn't get to meet Kelly, but our friends (that stayed there) did and said that she was really nice and friendly. Thanks!"
2215336,34193156,2015-06-06,5591495,Rachel,"We had a great stay!
 My family stayed at Kelly's place for a month while awaiting our furniture after a long distance move.  
The apartment was the perfect space for us.  We were able to relax and feel at home. The apartment was very well appointed, and has a great open concept space.  

We loved being right near the lake and close to coffee shops and restaurants in Tangletown, Greenlake, and Wallingford.  

We'd definitely recommend this apartment."
2215336,35217055,2015-06-16,27903620,Sing,Kelly was such a great host. She accommodated our needs. The unit is very nice and sizable. It is literally one block away from Green Lake! I highly recommend others to stay in Kelly's unit. 
2215336,52085083,2015-10-26,44359871,Kelsey,"We had the loveliest time at this beautiful Greenlake escape! The family was wonderful, welcoming and accommodating. Apartment had everything we could need in 5 weeks and then some, very comfortable and modern. Just steps away from the lake and playground, we were there all the time! Great food and shops close by. Can't say enough how great this stay was."
5500398,29010535,2015-04-02,29531089,Ming,I have stayed there for 11 days and the apartment is really nice. Xinwei and her husband are very warm and considerate. I will definitely recommend this to my friends who are going to visit me in Seattle. 
5500398,30478089,2015-04-22,10132034,Ramani,"Xinwei and her husband couldn't have been nicer people! The space is exactly as shown--modern, open, and filled with light from the double doors to the garden.  For someone like me who is used to living way up in the sky in city apartments, the garden was like having access to your own personal mini-park; I simply loved it.  And it's located just a short walk from RapidRide bus service to downtown.  I wanted to extend my stay, but they were booked up; I liked it that much. Thank you Xinwei!"
5500398,32437521,2015-05-17,27017638,Andrew,"We had an overall good experience staying at Xinwei's place. It was very nice and clean, comfortable bed, and we loved having our own private bathroom and backyard! The code lock on the door made it easy to come and go as we pleased. It was just what we needed. Thanks Xinwei!"
5500398,33847745,2015-06-01,33505982,Chris,the listing was accurate and generally quiet and peaceful
5500398,34091181,2015-06-04,8467378,Mona,"Xinwei bedroom was the best airbnb we have ever had. Private bedroom with a private bath and beautiful garden. Me and my husband were lucky to find this place. It was exactly what we wanted. If you are looking for a comfortable place to stay in Seattle, Xinwei house is the one for you.
Thank you for everything "
5500398,34780357,2015-06-12,7170065,Bob,"Excellent location for our needs of visiting relatives in the area. Accommodations were clean, quiet and simple with main criteria as a comfortable place to stay. Thank you to Xinfei & Chufun and congratulations for the newborn. "
5500398,34912970,2015-06-13,11076939,Allanah,"Xinwei was very responsive and accommodating (even though she was at home with her newborn!) She gave my boyfriend & I several great recommendations for coffee & restaurants, but left us to our own devices once we were settled. 
The space was neat, clean, well-lit and quiet. The patio garden was lovely and well-kept, perfect for a post-flight lunch from Tropicos Breeze, a central-american restaurant right across the street! Though the room is not directly within the most infamous Seattle neighborhoods, it's right off Aurora Avenue which is a major thoroughfare and a quick trip to anywhere in town by car. (I had a rental, so I can't speak for the public transit, but I did notice several bus stops along Aurora as well.)
Overall, a great room, great host and great price!"
5500398,35110093,2015-06-15,1733490,Colene,"My experience dealing with Xinwei was very smooth from our initial conversation to checking in. We had a bit of trouble finding the townhouse as we arrived at night and didn't realize you needed to go into the complex (down the driveway) to reach their place. Thankfully, she sent her husband to get us from the street. 

The room is exactly as pictured and the ensuite bathroom is very convenient. A couple nice extra touches to the room with the addition of the fridge and microwave. For light sleepers, there is some noise transfer, and we did hear voices and steps from upstairs."
5500398,35488925,2015-06-19,24600279,Shilpa,"We had a wonderful experience! We were moving to Seattle and used their place as a stop while we looked for apartments in the city and it was perfect.  It was close to the downtown area, had parking available outside the room had enough place for our 4 big bags. Thanks for opening your house to us. We were using air bnb for the first time and were slightly hesitant but it was a very good experience overall!"
5500398,36034889,2015-06-24,14764149,Betty,"Xinwei is a very thoughtful, kind host.  She was very prompt to answer all my questions and was very flexible working with my arrival and departure.  Her home is very clean, modern and was very convenient.  The bed was very comfortable.  Everything was as she describes in her listing, plus many extras.  I enjoyed my stay, would definitely return and highly recommend her home.  "
5500398,36536281,2015-06-29,26996110,Aileen(phone number hidden),Best experience I have ever had! The room is exactly what it showed in the picture. Very Comfortable!
5500398,37001954,2015-07-03,18768219,Liang,Wonderful experience! Xinwei and her husband are very nice and friendly.  The room was exactly as pictured and the ensuite bathroom was very convenient. The space was clean and quiet. The patio garden was lovely and well-kept. Thank you Xinwei!
5500398,37600073,2015-07-08,36001389,Payam,"We had a very pleasant stay.  Very nice and private room: you almost have your own private entrance.  Great location too.  Very close to one of the major arterial roads in Seattle, yet nice and quiet.  There is free street parking but if you arrive late at night don't expect to find a spot  right in front of the place, more like half a block away, but that's typical of Seattle.  We stayed during a hot week in the summer, but it was cool and comfortable at night with window open.  If you are sensitive to light in the morning: curtain will not block light, but that's pretty typical of airbnb listings."
5500398,37876137,2015-07-11,16138012,Michael,"We greatly enjoyed our stay--great proximity to the places we wanted to visit.  We were able to check in and leave pretty much when we wanted, and we greatly appreciated that freedom and flexibility."
5500398,38513341,2015-07-16,1013057,Jamielee,"Our stay at Xinwei's was very pleasant. The room looks exactly like the photos and was quite clean. 

We had some trouble 1) finding the place and 2) contacting Xinwei when we arrived. Let me address #1 first--make sure the address you're going to is specifically Northwest, not just North. We ended up going to the identical address, only North, not Northwest. Our Google Maps defaulted to North when I typed the address in.

As for #2, Xinwei was very easy to communicate with up until we arrived. I texted her that we were on our way to her place and would arrive in 20 minutes. She texted back right away and acknowledged. When we arrived (at the wrong place!), I called/texted but she didn't respond. We rang the doorbell but it didn't seem like anyone was home (again, we were at the wrong place). We waited for around 30 minutes and I ended up calling Airbnb. They emailed Xinwei and she gave me a call shortly after, apologizing as she hadn't heard her phone ring. 

They have a baby, and apparently she was feeding the baby and neglected to check her phone. Obviously I was frustrated in the beginning but understood when I found out it was because of her baby. 

Overall I had a good stay, it was just rough in the beginning."
5500398,38737990,2015-07-18,35218958,Barbara,"Our hosts met us at the door and welcomed us graciously, helping us with our luggage and directing us to a small, comfortable private room  opening out into a fenced garden.  The en-suite bathroom was clean and, like everything, was generously supplied.  Although we didn't again meet them, we often texted with timing issues and requests that were met with the same generosity and graciousness.  They lived in an apartment, upstairs from our quite private room.  The apartment complex was not far from a major road, but was nevertheless quiet.  We couldn't recommend Xinwei and their BnB  highly enough."
5500398,39049705,2015-07-20,6470853,Megan,"We had a great experience staying here. Xinwei was very easy to communicate with, and the reservation and check-in processes went smoothly. The room is just as lovely and cozy as it looks in the photos, and it was well-kept and very clean. Because it is the only room on the first floor of the townhouse it was very private and quiet, and it was so nice to have a private en suite bathroom. The townhouse is located near a major thoroughfare, so it was easy and quick to travel to other places in the city by car. Highly recommended!"
5500398,39507528,2015-07-24,35218958,Barbara,Xinwei is wonderful in every way. Please check my other review which will give you the details.
5500398,40117609,2015-07-28,36166779,Shannon,I had a great time staying at Xinwei's home.  The room was clean and cozy just like the pictures.  It was really nice having a private bathroom and I really enjoyed the garden!
5500398,40647523,2015-08-01,19531015,Dan,Very comfortable room with private bathroom and a private patio/garden.  Everything about our stay was great.  Location is close to Ballard and Capitol Hill (both very cool neighborhoods).  Xinwei was very pleasant and easy to get in touch with.  Highly recommend this stay.
5500398,41076188,2015-08-04,13712988,Julie,"The host and her husband always greeted us with a smile.  She was made certain we knew how to get in and out of the house.  
Having private access to the garden was definitely nice because we could keep the door open to let in cool air at night. 
It's hard to judge the size of the room from the picture, but it was a bit smaller than we were expecting."
5500398,42139123,2015-08-11,35913060,Amy,"Xinwei and Chunfu were very easy to get in touch with and made us feel very welcome. Great location, not too far from everything and parking was never a problem. Room was as described and very clean and comfortable.  Being on the first floor of a townhouse, it was almost like having private entry. We only saw them one time outside of the check-in but they made sure we had everything we needed."
5500398,43150702,2015-08-17,40634905,Dan,"The experience was perfect. The hosts met us when we showed up and we had a private place where we didn't have to go through their space to get to it. They lived upstairs while we had a nice room downstairs. Bed was incredibly comfy. I was shocked, I'm very particular about my beds. "
5500398,45299172,2015-09-01,436604,Regina Jue,"Xinwei was a lovely host. Very nice, responsive with communication and flexible. Her home is very nice as well. The room we stayed at looked brand new! It was clean, organized and had a great functioning bathroom. It was also very peaceful. We had everything we needed as if we were at a hotel. The area is close by some great neighborhoods in Seattle as well as downtown where the touristic attractions are."
1520593,7702141,2013-09-30,6724040,Andrew,"This is a very clean and enjoyable stay. Just a minute away from public transportation and local eateries. 

This house allows for an effortless and self-sufficient check-in process and any questions/answers are just a text away with their house captain.

Would stay again. Thank you Io House."
1520593,8359073,2013-10-27,576397,Laurie,"The house is set-up for medium-length stays by nerds working on projects or with local incubators: if this is you, it'll work great, as it's close to the tech companies and the house is full of nerds :-)

I was a tourist, and for me the location is absolutely great -- there's great food and nightlife in Capitol Hill, and downtown was a 30-minute downhill stroll (I caught cabs back!). 

One caveat: if you're particularly picky about cleanliness, keep in mind that this is a house where several 20-something straight males share a kitchen and a bathroom."
1520593,8929719,2013-11-26,9071390,Marije,"Great house with great people. Everyone was very friendly and there were more than enough spots to do some coding. The only downside of the house was its cleanness, which was not really good."
1520593,18228902,2014-08-24,14005812,Corinne,"For the first 2 months I was there, there weren't any cleaning people like the listing said... so the place was really dirty. It was a warmer summer than usual and the kitchen had a constant SWARM of fruit flies, making it pretty much unusable. Finally the fruit flies got so bad that they finally got a cleaning lady to come once a week, which helped. There was nothing in the backyard (no benches or table like the photo) so that made it hard to enjoy. And there were barely ever any ""demo nights"" or anything like that. So the listing was inaccurate in many ways when I saw it.

I liked the other people that lived there. I liked Matt, the house manager. The location is AMAZING. But for the price I paid, it was barely worth it. It's probably a lot better in the fall/winter. I would try to find somewhere else in the summer. "
1520593,25128288,2015-01-07,11802872,Andrew,"Was welcomed with a tour of the house on arrival. My Room was quite nice with a wardrobe, comfy bed, shelves and bedside table. 

The house is kept quite clean. The house facilities are all very useable with a large dryer + washing machine and a reasonable kitchen (however I ate most nights). The internet is of a very high quality. Occasionally would drop out but only for a couple of seconds.

There is plenty of desk space available to work at. 

I had very little contact with other house guests for the most part but they all seem nice. They didn't make much noise so it's a good environment to work in."
1520593,28953042,2015-04-01,29047883,Daniel,"Pros:
The house captain, Aaron, was very nice and welcoming. The location was excellent – very close to everything I could've needed. High-speed Internet was decent. The house was reasonably clean and the bed was surprisingly comfortable.

Cons:
The house is ancient. The floor was SO squeaky, I felt guilty for (I can only assume) waking everyone up just to get out of bed to use the bathroom. It was mentioned to me that the house is being leased, so they can't make changes, however, the electrical seemed questionable; I was instructed which breaker switches to turn back on in the basement in case the circuit got overloaded. And for the price, a pull-string closet light was a bit ridiculous. Also, no locks on bedroom doors, so nowhere to securely store valuables."
1520593,41718102,2015-08-09,15106381,Rachel,"I had an amazing time staying in the IO House for 3 months. The location is great, just a block away from Broadway with tons of coffee shops, thrift stores, and a 24-hour grocery store. Even though there are lots of people in the house, I found it to always be very quiet at night and in the morning. All of my housemates were interesting and friendly, and I spending time with them quickly became my favourite thing to do in my free time. I can't wait to go back."
1520593,42442687,2015-08-13,39373658,Jake,This place is the best. Andrew gave all of the info I needed and everyone was incredibly friendly. The whole experience was a blast and I recommend anyone traveling through the area who wants to stay with like minded hackers to sign up for this one.
1520593,42756536,2015-08-15,8032901,Nadia,The host was nice. He understood why we could not stay at his place. It is just not an enviroent suitable for females. 
1520593,45678666,2015-09-05,1276765,Shamoni,"The Io House has a great location, in the heart of trendy capitol hill great food/drinks and volunteer park. The other people living in the house were very friendly and nice. While I was there professional cleaning services came and did a thorough and much needed job of cleaning the kitchen, bathrooms and living area. The room I was in, which was the larger private one on the second floor, was completely bare bones and quite frankly depressing in appearance, a bed, a rickety tiny desk and a folding chair. Overall, I would say my experience was positive.  "
7735282,55599289,2015-12-02,49869653,Landon,"James was a great host, very helpful and kind. The location was ideal, minutes from pike place and the room was very clean and welcoming. Highly recommended if you're looking to stay in the downtown Seattle area!"
7735282,55875525,2015-12-06,47082714,Benz,"James was very attentive! He made sure that I had everything I needed during my stay. He even offered to go out for a drink with his friends! The location of the apartment is unbeatable. Restaurants, grocery stores, bars, gym, you name it; everything is in the neighborhood. The place itself is exactly what is shown in the pictures.  The bed was very comfortable, and I enjoyed using the little yet accommodating kitchen."
7735282,56013890,2015-12-07,50557661,Hisham,James was an excellent host. The listing was prepared and in excellent condition. Clear instructions on how to check in as well as great tips on things to do within walking distance. Would definitely stay with him again.
7735282,56168487,2015-12-09,5245115,Yudi,"We had a great time at this place, very convenient, clean and beautiful, everything is even better than I imagined from the pictures! James is super friendly and humorous, I definitely would stay here again!"
7735282,56352468,2015-12-12,50853464,Erik,"James was an amazing host. He provided great information on things to do, places to eat and sights to see. The space was just as described and was very comfortable, and located in a very happening part of town. Lots of restaurants, coffee houses, and night life within walking distance. I would definitely stay in one of James places again."
7735282,56648321,2015-12-15,15388967,Cary,"I had a great stay at James's apartment which was warm and inviting having arrived during a cold, rainy day.  It was clean and comfortable with a great eclectic style and a very comfortable bed.  The apartment is in a neighborhood which felt homey and local, though a short walk from downtown and major sites in Seattle.  A big plus is if you want to go to a bite to eat or get some coffee, there are many choices a short walk away.  Though I didn't get to meet James, he was very responsive in communications and provided great service through self check-in and out as well as provided great advice on local eats, transport, etc.  Overall, it was a great place to stay that I'd book next time if work takes me to Seattle again."
7735282,57320748,2015-12-24,35377787,Francis,"James was an outstanding airbnb host, his place was very nice and clean and was one of the better airbnb places I have stayed at. It is located in a prime location in Seattle, with a lot of nice cafes and bars nearby. James was also very accommodating and helpful whenever we had any questions to ask him about the place/the city of Seattle."
7735282,57839135,2015-12-29,51954207,Brandon,"James, was very responsive in answering questions.  He kept in constant contact with me and offered me guidance on how to get to the apartment from the airport.  Additionally, James recommended restaurants that would be open when I got there...which was difficult since I came in late at night and it was christmas eve.  That was very much appreciated.

Overall, James was available immediately and answered all questions promptly.  Additionally, the apartment is in a great location and within walking distance to anything a tourist would want."
7735282,58612561,2016-01-03,8378525,Danielle,"We had a wonderful stay at James' apartment in Capitol Hill.  It's a cosy and well-appointed studio with all the amenities we needed.  James was incredibly helpful and friendly, offering us great suggestions of local bars and restaurants - all of which are only a short walk from the apartment. 3 nights wasn't long enough!
Thanks again James!"
5031285,31384756,2015-05-04,29562539,Tim,"It was a beautiful experience! The room was at the right temperature, the rice & miso soup breakfast was excellent, the bed was comfortable, and the Temple manager was very helpful!"
5031285,31564592,2015-05-06,22822722,Sydney,"Made last minute plans to stay here right before flying out to Seattle and it was absolutely lovely. They were very accommodating with our late arrival. The place was very clean and I had a comfortable night of sleep. 

The two people who we met while we were there were very kind and were able to guide us in the right direction when we asked where we might find groceries. 

The breakfast of miso soup, rice, and tea was honestly awesome. Those are already things I love and I thought it was very kind of them to prepare them for us."
5031285,31836670,2015-05-10,6418296,Peter,"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Seattle these last four days, in large part thanks to the highly positive experience I had with this location and its host, Mike. First off, the International District is phenomenal. Like any good urban Asian-American neighborhood, good food is plentiful and accessible. On top of that, the location is less than a half block away from the Light Rail (very easy airport access), as well as walking distance from many major Seattle locations and bus routes. Beyond that however, the place itself is unpretentious and homey, and Mike [the host] shares those same values. Do expect to wake up early each morning with miso, rice, and fruit or vegetable (this worked out very well for my schedule). On Wednesdays and Sundays they hold services, which I recommend you stick around for at least one of. The community of people brought together is diverse, authentic and open. It's not the Ritz, but that's not the point. Staying with Mike at Choeizan Enkyoji Temple was an ideal first taste of Seattle."
5031285,32273253,2015-05-16,32197080,Pat,we really appreciated how close this place was to the light rail. we were able to take the light rail straight from the airport to the temple and it was one block away. there were tons of restaurants nearby.  The Seattle lookout tower was within walking distance. Everything was so close by we didn't have to rent a car. Mike was extremely helpful and hospitable. we never went with out tea and we had a simple breakfast available. It's a great place to stay for people on a budget. highly recommend it.
5031285,33006208,2015-05-24,10060899,Kelby,Great find - clean and comfortable. Felt very welcome and got good advice on getting around. Literally half a block from the light rail/bus system. 
5031285,33453023,2015-05-28,13237720,Elina,"Very friendly hosts. The location was great, right in the international district."
5031285,33737256,2015-05-31,18869132,Sophie,"We've never been to Seattle before. We took the light trail from the airport and got off at the International District station. Mike, the temple manger greeted us downstairs. Every morning we had breakfast - miso soup with rice - cooked by Mike. He also made the bed for us before we came back at night. He helped us a lot during our stay!

It was kinda not convenient because there is no shower and wi-fi. But considering the price and the location, it is worthy. Most importantly, Mike made our stay such a wonderful experience."
5031285,33890048,2015-06-01,34671327,Ben,"Great place, very comfortable and clean. Mike is a very welcoming host who makes you feel right at home in the space. The location of the place was very close to the train station and walking distance to the downtown area. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
5031285,34135199,2015-06-05,17699861,Kiwon(Sleepy),"Need a little more explain for understanding of facilities.
Very convinient place for public transportation"
5031285,34393405,2015-06-07,35146013,Omar,"We decided to head to Seattle from Portland for the weekend, and booked a couple of beds here on very short notice. Still, Mike managed to make it work. The place is right next door to the train station, and not a very far walk from the heart of downtown. Neighbourhood is a little rough, but nothing crazy. Great find for the price, and a truly interesting place to hang out in."
5031285,34579585,2015-06-09,9270453,Ryan,"Great place, very clean and very well located close to the train station and downtown. The host (Mike) made me feel very welcome and recommended good and cheap places to eat close by. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent stay at low price close to downtown Seattle!"
5031285,34748316,2015-06-11,8324446,Michael,"Michael was a very kind host - responsive to messages, providing directions and tips, and making sure it was a comfortable overnight stay.  I follow a daily meditation practice, and it was wonderful to be able to practice in the space prior to departure.  With gassho.. :)"
5031285,35387928,2015-06-18,1611576,Trey,"Had a good visit with Gabriel and then Mike at the temple. Just as advertised, and in a great location. Glad to help the temple out and happy to have a comfortable, clean space to stay in."
5031285,35517825,2015-06-19,4581499,Mike,"I stayed over at the Temple one night. The fellow (Mike) was available to get me set with the Keys and explain the few rules. 
We had a nice visit and i left for the day/eve. 
I came back to find my single cot setup with new clean linens.
Very comfortable memory type foam.
The wake up call is early. But that is explained at time of booking.
Mike prepared Rice soup, it was a great breakfast 
Toi;let facility good. Would be nice if there was a shower.
The location known as The International Village is very chill. 
I enjoyed a coffee and snack at the cafe below. The owner Tony nice man.."
5031285,35610607,2015-06-20,33833545,Michael,"Great place to stay, only downside was no shower. Surrounded by good restaurants to choose from, convenience store right next door. Rice and miso soup for breakfast was a great way to start the day. Definitely will try to get this place if I come back."
5031285,35847744,2015-06-22,35004199,Octavio Gerardo,"It was a great experience!!!! Mike and Gabriel were very kind and helpful, they gave me clear instructions to go around the city. The room was nice, the bed was comfortable, and the breakfast each morning was delicious. I loved Mike's Miso soup!!!!
Definitely I will come back whenever I have the chance."
5031285,36096593,2015-06-25,32003640,Susan,"Mike was incredibly kind when a friend and I stayed here-- from being accommodating when we notified him that we'd be arriving late due to a delayed flight, to preparing a breakfast of white rice and miso soup for guests every morning. The place was very hospitable, with a luggage storage room, soft cots, two bathrooms (no showers), and a cat, all located in the temple space. The location was close to public transportation. Great and unique experience overall!"
5031285,36228464,2015-06-26,35975485,Alison,"Mike was very nice and welcoming. He was very accommodating and willing to work around our schedules. The temple is an open space, but the beds are comfortable and the room is air-conditioned.  The service in the mornings is interesting and I would highly recommend staying for it if you can. One word of warning though: the temple has a cat, so those with severe allergies might want to look elsewhere.  Overall, this was a great place to stay and very conveniently located."
5031285,36422644,2015-06-28,34769177,Cassie,"Once one of the hosts came to the door, he was very friendly, showed us around a bit, and found the key for our use. The listing was accurate, we stayed on beds in the main temple space and cleared things away in the morning for service. The neighborhood was alright, but definitely not a place to walk around alone."
5031285,36904291,2015-07-02,36049567,Kristin,"The Choeizan temple was much as described.  The bed was a cot set up in the main temple space, which did include a privacy screen.  Additionally this bed, though a cot, was extremely comfortable and seemed to he made of memory foam.  

Mike was kind and very helpful! He let me know about different things in the area, and gave me some pamphlets about Seattle.  He even recommended places to eat in the neighborhood.  When he found out I would be taking the bus to get to where I needed to he the next day he called the transportation center for me and found out which busses would get me there.  
The WiFi connection in the temple was strong, and the quiet space allowed me to get work done.  It is a simple and beautiful temple.  I was even allowed to join in on meditation when I asked, and was invited to tea after.  

Bottom line? Great space, great people.  For the cost they really go above and beyond- even if the accommodation is shared, and the bathroom facilities do not have showers.  They more than cover basic needs and are gracious and welcoming hosts."
5031285,37026291,2015-07-03,34067066,Seed,"It was wonderful experience, the host is nice and helpful, wait for me at night,open door for me at midnight, thanks so much"
5031285,37102725,2015-07-04,29449408,Brian,"I ended up canceling my reservation because I would not be in until very late. However, I stopped by the next morning to participate in the service and Mike was very welcoming when I arrived. The community space where i would have stayed was clean and fresh. I would absolutely stay there in the future."
5031285,37226471,2015-07-05,21255788,Sand,"Simple, quiet, and clean accommodation. Great for short stays in Seattle! Thank you for the delicious breakfast. "
5031285,37397015,2015-07-06,3820052,Lindsay,Mike was very nice and friendly. It was exactly what I expected. He was very accommodating. The temple was in a cool brick building in a very unique part of Seattle I'd never been to before. My friend and I actually never stayed the night because we were out so late but I was happy to know my stuff was safe at the temple and it was a nice place to come back to in the morning.
5031285,37821277,2015-07-10,18354866,Michael,"Both Mike and Gabriel were very accommodating and friendly when I arrived to check in. We shared a conversation where Mike made a few recommendations for lunch and places to see, all of which I enjoyed very much. The temple was a peaceful place to fall asleep with soft city noise. I enjoyed a morning service led by Gabriel and hot tea before going on my way. Thank you for the wonderful stay!"
5031285,37903132,2015-07-11,23571699,Tim,The host was very nice. I definitely recommend this place for a good night's sleep.  
5031285,38450879,2015-07-15,14838505,Penglu,"Sorry for late. Best host ever, I love the breakfast they provided in every morning. Also, there are tons of travel information you can use, never feel boring."
5031285,38749719,2015-07-18,21710466,Kai,"My stay here is a unique experience, mike and fred r all very nice people helping me all they can. The traffic is very good and there r loz of good places to have meal. but no shower is a big difficult and too many homeless people on the street. i dont dare to come back too late in the night."
5031285,39058704,2015-07-20,36000978,Gabriel,"Great shared space located in the heart of Chinatown and extremely close to transportation. We we were warmly welcomed by our host Mike who provided everything we needed including advice on where to eat and what to see around the city. Overall, we had an amazing experience staying at the temple. 

A word of warning for people planning to drive here, parking in this area is particularly difficult and expensive. Street parking is available for free from 8pm-8am but you will most likely find yourself paying anywhere from $10-20 for parking the rest of the day.

5031285,39257733,2015-07-21,1691010,Johanna,"Mike was waiting for us at the entrance, was very nice and helpful,
"
5031285,39354069,2015-07-22,5047144,Bernhard,It was a quite interesting and pleasant experience to spend the night in the Buddhist temple. Our host Mike made us feel very welcome and helped us with valuable recommendations regarding the city. The description of the accommodation is accurate and we had a good night's sleep.
5031285,39433341,2015-07-23,21193046,Karen,It was a wonderful experience to be at the Buddhist Temple.  We had the entire main temple to ourselves for the night.  It was very safe. Choeizan allowed us to use his cell phone as we did not have one. He also offered his computer.  He was very kind and generous.
5031285,39556038,2015-07-24,9787163,Ryan,"Host: the caretaker of the temple was conscientious, prompt in correspondence, and knowledgeable about the area.

Lodging: simple as billed. Bedding and temperature control allowed a good night's sleep. I was the lone guest which was unexpected privacy.

Other: close in location, good transit access, in house cat kept to himself/herself (did not check underneath), unfortunately I missed the miso breakfast and Buddhist service. Indoor  bicycle storage."
5031285,40257583,2015-07-29,5041448,Sara,"Staying at the Choeizan Enkyoji Temple was definitely a worthwhile experience. It is located in the International District, and could not be more convenient for transportation. It’s perfect for taking the Link Line in from the airport, has easy access to TONS of bus lines, and is less than a block away from the Amtrak station. 
Mike was a great host. He has tons of knowledge of local eateries and places to go. Plus he’s just an interesting guy to talk to. And a great cook. The Japanese style breakfast was delicious! 
Although the temple is not in a traditional space, it has a lovely and peaceful feel to it. The bed was super comfortable, and it was fun to try to spot Hanako the cat wandering about. Overall, a great experience in every way. Highly recommended. "
5031285,40378011,2015-07-30,33401596,Luke,"I coordinated my arrival at the Temple with Mike, who was very flexible and prompt with his replies.  I arrived at the appointed hour, and he welcomed me into the space.  We chatted for a bit and then each went our separate ways to konk out.  I slept in a cot in the central temple space with screens to either side for privacy.  While not exactly a conventional AirBnB scenario, it worked out great for me to get a solid night's sleep after a day wandering Seattle. Facilities are clean, neighborhood is interesting and reasonably accessible."
5031285,40550252,2015-07-31,3573350,Stefan,The temple is a very nice quiet place to stay for a couple nights. The price is just right and it is located right beside the Chinatown station. It's very easy to get here from airport. Choeizan is quick to reply and actually saved me last minute when I needed a place to stay. I booked in the airport and was accepted the next 2 minutes. There is service every morning at 8am so that shouldn't be a problem for early risers. Choeizan is really helpful and has great suggestions for food nearby. 
5031285,40647515,2015-08-01,1605079,JoJo,"Choeizan was a wonderful host, and you couldn't ask for a better place with character and location as this one! If you're the type of person who doesn't mind traveling light, the Main Temple Hondo is great spot. Even though it's 2 blocks away from Seattle's main transportation hub, it was surprisingly quiet inside. It's also located right in the middle of Seattle's International District and blocks from the Pioneer Square art studios."
5031285,40788716,2015-08-02,37791339,Amy,"Wonderful! Location is very close to the light rail and bus stops, in addition to cool restaurants and all the ""tourist attractions."" The  caretaker, Mike is super friendly and was very kind to help me figure out some logistical issues with my trip (he had maps of Seattle, bus routes and schedules and of course the Internet.) Highly recommend this airbnb for anyone looking for a budget friendly basic place to crash with great vibe and good people! "
5031285,40991531,2015-08-03,17131608,Matthew,We really enjoyed staying here. Very friendly host and really easy to get to.
5031285,41968343,2015-08-10,36488359,Xu,its pretty cool. Host is very nice. And it will be better if I can take showers in there.XD
5031285,42267072,2015-08-12,1572773,Yuko,"great location, convenient from or to anywhere. felt relaxed with hot green tea. they were so helpful. the folding bed and linens were clean and it was silent enough to sleep even share the floor by 2-3 people (divided by screen). i am safely traveling Alaska. thank you!"
5031285,42437564,2015-08-13,39057091,Tani,"Mike was always very prompt in his responses and he was very friendly and helpful when we arrived.  The listing was just as described as was the neighborhood.  It was definitely a different experience for me but one that I was glad to have, nonetheless.  The resident cat is very cute and friendly.  Staying here really humbled me and I was enormously grateful for it.  "
5031285,42555993,2015-08-14,26973007,Deng,"I had a brilliant time during my stay in Japanese Buddhism temple. The host was very nice and happy to provide all tour information I needed. It's location is perfect, right in the middle of International District; Chinatown and Pioneer Square are all in walking distance and it only takes you probably 5 minutes. "
5031285,43680978,2015-08-21,1521752,Eri,"Mike was super prompt communicator, considerate, and friendly host. The area was super convenient and interesting. I totally missed the description that the place has no shower but I ended up finding a massage spa with a shower so it was perfect! It was simple but just perfect place for a touring around Seattle! Thank you for a great accommodation! "
5031285,43941773,2015-08-23,31216226,James,Great spot very welcoming... Something different and a great experience... Right by the train and safeco field was a plus.... Also very comfy beds ! 
5031285,44318489,2015-08-25,17071767,Kelly,Our Hosts were very welcoming. gave suggestions and directions. The cots we slept on were really comfy cots. it is also very close to lots of public transit. Good visit.
5031285,44647929,2015-08-28,3568323,Chason,"The temple was a great place to stay! Everyone there was very welcoming and I got a great positive vibe from the space. Just a note, the temple is on the second floor of a building in Chinatown. It can be a little difficult to find but just look for the signs in the windows."
5031285,45123728,2015-08-31,19001240,Jesse,"A very pleasant introduction to Nichiren Buddism. It was a great place to hang your hat during the evening. The green tea and miso in the morning was also a nice touch. Thank you to Gabriel, Michael and Kanjin for being the light to those lost in darkness. I will be attending  the Sunday services regularly.  

NAMU MYOHO RENGE KYO!"
5031285,45429983,2015-09-02,33121658,Terence,"Mike is an awesome host who's very knowledgable about the city. He responds really quickly and is very accommodating. Location is great, just across the street from a bus/train station, but not the most welcoming area outside late at night. 

This place is perfect if you're just looking for a place to get some shut eye. Like the description mentions, there are no showers, but the cots are comfy. The only problem is that one of the lights near the entrance does not turn off for safety purposes and are only shielded by paper (shoji) screens, so if you need darkness to sleep, I suggest bringing an eye/sleep mask. Sadly, I was not able to stay for the service and breakfast. Finally, there's a very friendly cat in the temple.

Like I said earlier, I would definitely recommend this place if you are just looking for a place to get some sleep."
5031285,45528190,2015-09-03,16904938,Nicholas,Great place to stay! Host was flexible with my schedule. He recommended a great restaurant in the neighborhood. Would stay here again. 
5031285,45953162,2015-09-07,37961761,Kenshiro,"I and my friend of mine stayed 5 days because of studying abroad in Seattle.We do not know about Seattle at all,but Michael told us so many kind of things!Michael was very good person and we love him!!We want to visit Choeizan Enkyoji again and meet him again.Thanks a lot!!"
5031285,46220141,2015-09-08,42858290,Michael,"Mike was an excellent, friendly host who was happy to chat. Before I even asked he messaged me about how to use the rail to get from the airport. He suggested great restaurants and sites in the area. Location is excellent, within walking distance of Safeco Field and several other points of interest.
I was able to watch the morning service, performed by Gabriel. My only regret is not being able to see the full Sunday service.
The cot was comfortable and everything was clean. Soup and rice for breakfast was also good. I would recommend trying this place out for at least a night if you're in Seattle. It's a neat experience and a good one to try for my first airbnb."
5031285,46360279,2015-09-09,9796404,Almarose,"Great stay :-) host is hospitable,  communicative and flexible."
5031285,46535554,2015-09-11,43006828,Cody,"Great location for a travelling vacation.  Close to subway, ferry, and bus station.  You can seriously get anywhere in Seattle from here."
5031285,46658040,2015-09-12,8069999,Ben,"Great experience. Mark was respectful and worked with my schedule. He offered advice and was helpful, even after hours. This is a unique and beautiful place in Seattle. "
5031285,47235996,2015-09-16,7869905,Lu,"i stay in mike's place one night. a very special and pleasant experience for me. 
everything is as described. but i get lot more than a simple stay. where you can observe a typlical american buddist temple. and when i talk with mike, he give many good suggestion of seattle. he is very kind and helpful. and actually i sleep there quite well. amasing place. "
5031285,47836775,2015-09-21,6867363,Quynh,"Listing description is accurate. Friendly, welcoming host, convenient location right next to a Link station. Early morning temple services do mean the cot/bedding has to be put away before 8am. Best as a minimal place to crash at the end of the night. "
5031285,48136533,2015-09-23,41582007,小凡,"It is s totally different experience. Good location, nice breakfast, I am glad to sleep here."
5031285,48834630,2015-09-28,1582472,Michael,"The Temple was welcoming and decent. Mike was a helpful caretaker and was receptive to letting me into the building when needed. I was eventually given keys, which made my stay easier. I'd recommend having the keys given by the host upon the guests arrival. I was not offered any breakfast, contrary to the advertisement, and wake up time was strictly 8:00 am regardless of the temple worship schedule (the second morning I was there, there was no morning service but I was still woken up at 8:00 am, which was confusing). The temple is clean, including the bathrooms, but keep in mind there are no showers (as advertised).
The accommodations are very basic, as advertised (I think). I would also add that the guest is basically expected to not be on premises during the day. So, if you are staying multiple nights, don't expect to spend any time there other than overnight. There is space to store luggage and personal items.
The neighborhood is conveniently close to the light rail. So, if you're flying into the Seattle-Tacoma airport, you can get a ticket for $3 to the International District and walk about a half a block, and you're right there (it takes about 30 minutes). The neighborhood itself leaves a lot to be desired, but it seems relatively safe."
5031285,48991744,2015-09-30,15420330,Martin,"De accomodatie voldeed aan de beschrijvingen. We voelden ons er redelijk op ons gemak, hoewel we niet echt veel contact kregen met de verhuurders. De airco stond veel te hard te blazen, maar we hadden geen idee of we die konden veranderen. 
De kamer is wel ideaal dicht bij het centrum en het station gelegen. Voor de prijs is het een prima plek om te zijn voor een nacht. "
5031285,49705451,2015-10-05,44981032,Yue,"The experience is out of my expectation.   Quite and clean.Great location. Easy to find food and transportation.  Everyone is helpful and friendly. I mean all the Mikes(^_^) if you have a chance to meet them.  The cat ""Hanako"" is shy but you will have a chance to pet her if she is waiting for food. 
I attended Sunday morning service and then stay till the afternoon. If you have a chance , I highly recommend you to stay and talked with people there. As Sensei said , every conversation could be a practice for enlightenment.  I am grateful to have the chance to stay there for two nights and hope I could visit again. "
5031285,51420451,2015-10-19,46785674,Eric,Mike was a great host and had everything ready for me even though I arrived a little late.  The accommodations were as described and it was an excellent experience.  I would definitely go back and may just to experience a Sunday service.  
5031285,53890605,2015-11-14,35403068,Nathan,Great experience would stay here again   
5031285,54553384,2015-11-21,38303986,Andrew,"It was a welcoming environment and located very close (less than 3 min walk) to trains (including the one to/from the airport), buses, and Pronto, the city's bike share program. Very walkable to the stadiums and the great revitalized neighborhood, Pioneers Square. There were a few homeless folks hanging on the block, but they were not aggressive or an issue at all - just something to be aware of coming back late at night. Host was pleasant and helpful and I could come and go as I pleased, but I ended up only came back for sleeping. "
5031285,54966193,2015-11-25,19078070,Jeff,"Mike was very welcoming.  He had some suggestions about touristy things I could do.  When I got back he had my cot set up, and I had a great night's sleep.  I had to leave early in the morning and Mike got up to make sure I didn't oversleep. 

The temple is at the intersection of two major thoroughfares, but is not in a noisy neighborhood and I did not hear any street noise inside the tunnel.

The temple is on the edge of Chinatown.  Mike recommended a place for a dim sum breakfast, which was excellent.  The temple is one block from a Seattle Central Link station (which is about 40 minutes from the airport), and two blocks from the Seattle Amtrak station. I took the Amtrak Cascade from Seattle to Vancouver, and enjoyed it immensely.  "
5031285,55087897,2015-11-27,444903,Gene,"The listing was accurate.  The temple is pretty much across the street from the light rail station, which made commuting extremely quick.  Mike, the host, was accommodating.  There was a scent of incense in the room, which I liked.  I was the only guest, so I enjoyed the privacy.  There was no service in the morning, which was a bit disappointing."
2263643,14257948,2014-06-15,14951516,SaraEllen,Friendly host and great location! Parking was a cinch.
2263643,15235411,2014-07-05,15613715,Eva,"Tessa was very friendly and thoughtful, trying to help me in anyway she could and making me feel very welcome in Seattle. She respects your privacy, but we also had good chats and fun together. The room and the shared bathroom were clean and her place is in a quiet and nice neighborhood. The bus stops are really close."
2263643,16386274,2014-07-26,1253808,Abbie,"Tessa was very communicative and flexible -- I booked the room the same afternoon I wanted to check in! She generously asked what I might want for breakfast, and met me outside when I arrived. Her place is right next to a huge, tree-filled park with a lighthouse and a little beach, and it's a nice place to run (or take a walk), if a bit hilly. The bus that goes downtown also comes right in front of the building, and it's a straight shot (no transfers). If you have a car, parking is pretty easy around her place. 

The photos in the ad are accurate. Tessa is a great host -- happy to chat if you want to chat, but also happy to let you do your own thing. 

Thanks again, Tessa! "
2263643,16593183,2014-07-29,5722284,Lauren,"Tessa was wonderful!  I got a bit lost in the maze that is Seattle, but when I finally made it to Tessa's place I was greeted with a cup of tea and a very clean and cozy room.  Tessa was a pleasure to chat with and I even got to see her amazing patio garden.  If you're driving, parking is a cinch, and the neighborhood is lovely. Thanks Tessa!"
2263643,17079550,2014-08-06,8548234,Patty,"I really enjoyed Staying with Tessa. She is the perfect host, very caring and always concerned if I needed anything during my stay. The room was very big for my standard and had all I needed. There was enough space to leave my backpack and even a table to work on my computer. Tessa""s place is clean and convenient. There are several busses which stop one block away so it is a very short walk home. The area is very safe and I felt comfortable anytime of the day. Its about a 20-30 bus ride to the center of Seattle but there are nice neighborhoods close by to explore.
I would stay with Tessa anytime again as she makes you feel like home and it is  very easy to get along with her. I enjoyed our chats and hope to stay with you next time in Seattle :).

"
2263643,17316850,2014-08-10,19346183,Amy,"I was nervous about utilizing a service like airbnb, but Tessa was a perfect host!  The room is just as described and very tidy and clean.  Tessa was always available and quick to respond to my messages; she was very laid back, helpful with suggestions and super sweet- she even offered to make me breakfast and take me to the weekend neighborhood market with her!  She lives in a lovely neighborhood right outside of Discovery Park for those looking to take quiet strolls and explore the beauty of the area.  Getting to downtown Seattle was very convenient; I had rented a car and it was about a 15 minute drive or so.  There is also a bus stop RIGHT in front of her apartment in case you don't rent a car (which I wish I hadn't!) and there were plenty of local markets, restaurants, etc. within 10 minutes away.  All in all, a lovely host, a lovely, great location, and a fabulous stay!"
2263643,17419255,2014-08-11,14253550,Emily,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2263643,17727945,2014-08-16,12008309,Daniel,My host was nice all the time. She made me feel very welcome and happy to be there. The description of the room is perfect. A very nice experience. Tessa and the apartment are great!
2263643,18159709,2014-08-22,9448329,Dena,I needed a last minute place to stay for the night and Tessa responded right away. I also needed to drop my bags off before an event; unfortunately she was away and unable to allow me to bring my bags by. This was understandable as my request was only an hour or two in advance. I was able to stay with a friend elsewhere and she allowed me to cancel my reservation. 
2263643,18381393,2014-08-25,20314779,Lynn,"I had a very nice stay at Tessa's! When I arrived, she met me outside the building so I knew I was in the right place. She offered tea and then gave me my space to settle in. I was up early and home late each day. The building and neighborhood is quiet and felt safe. I would text Tessa when I was on my way back each night to make sure she was looking out for me. There was plenty of street parking. It's a small apartment and Tessa sleeps just in the next room, so I was careful to be quiet in the morning. I would not hesitate to stay there again."
2263643,18915638,2014-09-02,421758,Grant,Quiet bedroom on third floor of a complex. Make sure you get full address or last name when booking accepted or you will have no idea who to buzz! Bus service is direct to Seattle Centre but ends quite early at night. It's a $20 taxi from downtown otherwise. Tessa is friendly and flexible about coming and going hours.
2263643,19060120,2014-09-05,15862932,Karen,I had a very nice time at Tessa place it was clean and homie . I was waiting for my Apartment to become avaliable and she was able to let me stay for 3 nights I got to spend time seeing the magnolia where her apartment/ airbnb is the Discovery park is right by her so I was able to walk in the park in the evening after work. I enjoyed tea with her and and chated one evening it was every nice. She also opened up her Kitchen for me to make Coffee in the morning and I was able to keep things in her Frig. She does a lot of home cooking but she always had room for my stuff and for me to make things to eat...
2263643,19579009,2014-09-14,5091043,Eva,The place is very nice. Pretty closed to the discovery park which is gorgeous during summer. But a little bit far away from downtown. 
2263643,21109411,2014-10-11,5356219,Star,"very nice host, I have one more water bottle friend now:) The place get me know more about local Seattlties other than downtown and Starbucks."
2263643,21646936,2014-10-20,12849878,Victoria,Tessa is a very friendly and welcoming host. Her apartment is in a quiet area right by Discovery Park and a great grocery store! Nice stay.
2263643,23090090,2014-11-22,23197067,Jason & Crys,"Tessa was a great host, and was able to accomodate us at short notice.  The room was quiet, and near Discovery park. Simple room, and a shared bath and kitchen. Street parking was adequate. 3rd floor condo, FYI."
2263643,24691658,2015-01-01,25263287,Kenneth,"First things first. As a first time guest at an airbnb, I couldn't be more happier to have stayed at Tessa's place. The room, and the entire apartment was lovely. She made me feel very welcome, and any questions I had, she had an answer for. She was super nice. And that was great, because it was also my first time in America, so it was a little overwhelming coming to Seattle in the first place.

As for the neighbourhood, it seems like a great place to live. It was very clean, and I felt safe there. There was a nice little convenience store some five minutes up the street, and it was a great place to grab some food or any other items one would need.

A thing worth mentioning, the bus transportation was great. It leaves often, but the last bus from downtown to Magnolia leaves 10.30pm. So if you like to stay out after that, be prepared to grab a cab or a uber or something like that.

I can definitely recommend staying at Tessa's if your looking for a comfortable and a nice friendly stay in Seattle.

Thank you, Tessa :)"
2263643,33042080,2015-05-24,33704550,David,Staying with Tessa was a pleasure! The small suburb of Magnolia is locally situated in relation to many key locations in Seattle and is beautiful in terms of the scenery. I thoroughly enjoyed riding the 33 into Queen Anne each day due to the very scenic route.  Tessa made me tea upon arrival and explained the lay of the land to me.  She is a fantastic host and I would definitely recommend considering a stay with Tessa should you be traveling to beautiful Em City!
