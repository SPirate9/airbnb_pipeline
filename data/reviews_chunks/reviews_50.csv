4009295,37959704,2015-07-12,1093237,Allison,"The experience was as expected. Eve was responsive, but we really didn't have any needs beyond check-in and checking out.  The location and price are fantastic.  The building is a little run down, but they keep the apartment clean (although did have a musty smell to it) and you can't beat the location.  All in all, if I had friends or family staying in the area that needed an affordable option, I would recommend this place.  "
4009295,38447567,2015-07-15,1200957,Ben,"Eve was great - I needed to show up well before the published check in time and they were very accommodating. Very quick and professional handoff. The place was exactly as advertised. Very nice and pretty roomy for a 1 bdrm. The location is pretty quiet considering it's on Capitol Hill. Enjoyed my stay and I'd stay in this one again.
Note for summer months - no A/C but it stayed very cool w/ fans etc."
4009295,38709864,2015-07-18,32652746,Matthias,"We had a great time in Seattle,  Eve was very helpful and reliable and we can highly recommend her place. There was good quality and plenty of towels, the place was spotlessly clean, spacious and has a huge TV.  The location is in easy walking distance to restaurants and shops and not far from downtown. Can't really add anything more, thanks Eve and Michael"
4009295,39528536,2015-07-24,25912733,Clare,"Comfortable, quiet apartment in convenient location. Great restaurants and coffee in easy walking distance. Eve was a pleasure to deal with."
4009295,39916124,2015-07-27,11180647,Brittany,"working in hotels for 10 years, i am very picky and expect a 5 star experience whereever i stay... and this was just that! clean, modern, organized and a great location. we were able to check in early and eve was there via text to answer any questions i had. very personable.  the only thing i would change is the pillows, but a girl can be too picky! it was a great escape from a crazy week in the city. "
4009295,40478098,2015-07-31,37257364,Matthew,"Top notch from beginning to end. Eve was responsive to all my questions, the apartment was exactly as described and listed. She even helped with near by dinner and drinks suggestions. Great area with tons of nightlife. Would 100% Stay again!"
4009295,40823014,2015-08-02,9426245,Michelle,"Eve was very responsive and quickly answered any questions we had leading up to our reservation. Addison checked us in and it couldn't have been any easier. Thanks Addison! The apartment had all the amenities we needed - hair dryer, iron/ironing board. "
4009295,42574043,2015-08-14,615094,Marcus,"Pros:
- Great check-in/checkout process and quick communication throughout the trip.
- Location is awesome, close to many cafes, restaurants, and bars.  15 minute walk to downtown.
- Place was clean and accurate to the pictures.

Cons:
- I imagine this is a one-time thing, but building manager came to show the apartment to prospective renters while we we were there without us being aware beforehand.  I think Morgan forgot to mention this, but it should have been shared as/when we booked the airbnb that someone might have to enter.
- There is a slight musty smell.
- The internet can be slow, I think the bandwidth is too little."
4009295,45948725,2015-09-07,34944010,Brendan,"Daniela was not my host, I was originally booked by Eve, who then transferred me to Morgan, then later a woman named Miranda, all of whom worked for Michael, whom I never met, yet rents multiple properties in Seattle and rents them on AirBnB. I was asked to move from this place with one week left in my stay, on my only day off from work (I was in Seattle for business and work 6 days a week). After a back and forth about picking new places, transportation, etc, I was moved to an apartment 1.3 miles away.
My second day in the new place a building manager came by for an insurance inspection, then returned a few minutes later to interrogate me. I was told to tell them that I was a friend of Michael's, yet another manager came up, insisting that I give my name and phone number because they had caught Michael renting to people on AirBnB before, which was apparently a violation of his lease. 
It was an incredibly unpleasant experience that I informed Miranda of (the third official host I had dealt with for a three week stay), who simply told me she would inform Michael, neither of which contacted me.
I recommend avoiding this conglomerate of unofficial corporate apartment renters who claim to own over sixty places in the Seattle area. Sure, the apartments were clean, tastefully furnished, and had the listed amenities, but they are cleaned by a professional cleaning crew after each stay and do not seem to be frequently checked on by the hosts, judging by the amount of cardboard boxes, random items, and various other belongings left behind in the closets and drawers."
258571,756506,2011-11-30,1430720,Sylvia,"The apartment was exactly what we had expected - a nice little apartment right in the heart of Capitol Hill, just off Broadway.  Nick was prompt and very friendly, reachable even when I got stuck in traffic and couldn't make the agreed check-in time.  The apartment was clean and quiet.  I would certainly stay here again.  One thing to remember: there is only free, two-hour parking (8am-7pm, unrestricted after that) in that area due to its proximity to downtown, so if you've got a car, be prepared to move it around.  I was always able to find parking within a block of the apartment."
258571,765798,2011-12-05,1028336,Lucy,"Great host, comfy, clean room with all you need in the most buzzing part of Seattle.  "
258571,777606,2011-12-11,995157,Holly,"Nick is super sweet and nice! His place was so convenient and GREAT value for money! We really enjoyed our stay here.. Smack bang in Capitol Hill, which was a great place to be in Seattle.. Walking distance to to cool bars, Downtown, the fish market, Belltown (another cool area, try Shorty's a pinball bar and go to Roq La Rue Gallery) and Broadway which has a lot of cheaper food places. We went out for a curry to Annapurna on Broadway which had great atmosphere, service, food & wine! Nick lent us a copy of Seattle Lonely Planet and a map and was really helpful through our whole trip. If your into amazing art books, comics and records, check out Fantagraphics Books and Georgetown Records in Georgetown (South Seattle art district), well worth the bus ride/drive from Nick's. Overall Nick's place was perfect for us, there were 3 of us staying for a few days and even though it was very cold in Seattle the apartment warmed up super quick. All the appliances are brand new, it was comfortable and Nick is great!"
258571,788300,2011-12-16,1440565,Leslie,"Nick was a fabulous host and his apartment is just as great. It's in an ideal location and well-equipped with anything you might need during a short stay. Nick was very communicative and gracious enough to transport me to and from the light rail upon my arrival and departure, and went the extra mile by leaving me maps, recommendations, and even printed out a bus route based on where I'd told him I planned on going. "
258571,796008,2011-12-20,288962,Franziska,I really enjoyed staying at Nick's place. It's within walking distance of all things that might be of interest and not even far from the station that takes you to the airport. I particularily liked that there was organic tea and coffee available in the apartment. Nick's also a really nice guy and was easy to get in touch with anytime.
258571,803874,2011-12-24,1480421,Rachel,"We had a fantastic stay in Seattle at Nick's apartment. Nick went out of his way to accommodate us and make us feel welcome--even going so far as to pick us up and drop us off at the train station, help us orient ourselves in the city/neighbourhood and accommodate our confusing travel schedule. Nick is a great host, and we will definitely stay here again next time we're in Seattle!
The apartment itself is exactly as advertised. It's cozy and fully equipped. There's a powerful space heater for when it gets chilly, and guide books, maps of the city, even a tv with lots of dvds. The bed is very comfortable. The place is surprisingly quiet... we slept really soundly here. 
The neighbourhood is fantastic: there are all the bars, restaurants and cafes you could ever want around the corner or within short walking distance. It's a funky, pedestrian-friendly area, still within walking distance from downtown and Pike Place market. 
Overall, incredibly good value and highly recommended!!"
258571,813614,2011-12-29,100900,Matthew,"The apartment was clean and really nice.  Comfortable and plenty of room.  All the rooms were in order.  Nick was very accommodating, met me at the apartment the night I got in.  He also helped me out the following morning when I couldn't understand how to open the front door of the building.

Highly recommended.  A nice place in a great location.

Also, while he says that there's no WIFI in the apartment, if you put your laptop on top of the TV stand by the door you can usually get WIFI from upstairs."
258571,856530,2012-01-11,1423032,Bob,"Great location. Shopping, restaurants, grocery store, coffee shops,  everything nearby. Sweet little place. small but comfortable and well furnished. Safe and secure.  Excellent value. Beautiful city.  The parking does suck but that's my fault for driving there. You don't need a car. We walked everywhere to everything. Charming host. Nick is a great guy who left us alone but did check in to see if we needed anything and was always available for any information we needed about the apartment, the area, or the city.  I'll be going back for sure.  "
258571,870790,2012-01-18,1574760,Ryan,"Nick was very accommodating and the space was wonderful. Great location. He was readily available if I needed anything- but I didn't. Would definitely recommend staying with him in his great place!

"
258571,872894,2012-01-20,1373394,Jeff And Kati,"Nick was great.  We were trapped in Seattle by the snow and ice and Nick went out of his way to make sure we had what we needed.  Apartment was cute and exactly what we needed for our stay in Seattle. Nick is easy going and takes good care of the apartment and his guests.  We hope to stay there again in the future.  The coffee and organic products were nice touches and show that Nick pays attention.  The location on Capital Hill was perfect, close to lots of great shops and restaurants and Virginia Mason Hospital.  "
258571,902113,2012-02-05,1519952,Leslie,"Nick is awesome!  We couldn't have asked for a better host.  He was very friendly and quick to offer advice on places to visit and where to eat.  He checked in on us every couple of days to make sure everything was going ok and was readily available regardless of our needs or questions. We got really lucky to have a host as generous as him being that it was our first venture with AirBnB. We would definitely, without a doubt, recommend Nick to anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks Nick!!!!"
258571,908555,2012-02-07,1689228,Rob,Nick was awesome-- very helpful and accommodating. This was our first experience on AirBnB and I'm definitely a convert. Thanks!
258571,917593,2012-02-13,743583,Thao,"Nick does his best to provide the things you would need for a comfortable stay (clean sheets, towels, plates, wifi!!). My husband wanted to make dungeness crab (bought from international district uwajimaya) and Nick was nice enough to let us borrow his big pot to cook them in. The apartment is in a convenient location and we ended up walking/taking the bus everywhere. Nick was kind enough to give us directions to his place using the bus. He was a pretty accommodating host. Overall, it is the best value in Seattle!"
258571,927239,2012-02-17,1691730,Holly,. the location is great. nick is really attentive and helpful - a great host.
258571,960362,2012-02-29,1452338,Michael,"I never met Nick, as he was out of town, but he was in very close contact with me over email/phone so I never felt neglected.  He seems like a very nice guy and I look forward to meeting him someday.  

The place is great!  The location alone is straight BRILLIANT.  The neighborhood around is very hip, great to hang out in, and for business people working downtown it is a short walk over the highway (very easy)  into the highrise area.  I was working at the Paramount Theater for the week and it was about a 7 minute walk for me.  Couldn't have been better.  The apartment is really wonderful.  Even though its at the back of the building and the giant living room windows look out onto an odd stone alley, the alley is clean and there is something very zen about the view from the living room.  Great for writers/creative types.  I got a lot of work done.  The living room is large and has a desk and a small table for meals.  Kitchen is all you could need and all cooking supplies/utensils provided.  He even provided coffee/tea.  Bed is large and comfortable but takes up most of the bedroom.  Very comfortable linens/comforter.  Shower- pressure is good and water is hot! Nick provides a large space heater to supplement wall heating units.  Windows in living room do have a small draft but visiting in February I had no trouble staying warm.  Could see apartment having a nice cross breeze in the summer. 

I would definitely stay here again.

All around great apartment in an awesome location, with an attentive host!
"
258571,968988,2012-03-04,1446103,Maggie,Great location and Nick was a great communicator throughout the experience. The apartment had everything I needed to do some cooking and feel at home. Great location for Downtown meetings and Cap Hill fun.
258571,980102,2012-03-07,1558840,Anneka,"Great apartment in a great neighborhood!  In walking distance to pretty much everywhere (plus if you're going toward anything touristy, it's downhill).  We had a really lovely time.  Thanks Nick!"
258571,1002845,2012-03-15,500912,Gregory,"First the positives - the apartment is in a terrific spot on Capitol Hill.  Could not have been better for walking the city.  Secondly Nick is super responsive and helpful. 

The down side.  The apartment is cold and dark (although not damp).  The bathroom and to a lesser extent the kitchen needed a good scrubbing - it was dirty.  The bed seemed to be broken and was uncomfortable.    

The neighbor above would clatter around in hard soled shoes at 3am while the next door neighbor had loud 4am parties 2 of the 4 nights we were there (obviously not the host's fault).

The price seems a bargain, but you really do get what you pay for.  Would not stay again, despit the positives."
258571,1026624,2012-03-21,1488786,Justin,"Great little apartment - the perfect place for going downtown and catching all the sights - we walked everywhere (maybe a 10-15minute walk to the famous pike place market) - Nick constantly checked with us to make sure we had everything we needed, and was quick with recommendations for the area, including bus schedules etc.  A quick tidbit - take the light rail from the airport to the last stop (Westlake) - you'll be about 10 blocks from the place and will save yourself about 30 dollars in cab fair."
258571,1057414,2012-03-29,1522949,Jackie,"Great location, easy walk to Pike Place Market and the Space Needle. Neighbors can be loud at night, but it's a great place to stay and meets your needs. The host is very friendly and accommodating, always willing to help with any problems or questions."
258571,1081408,2012-04-04,1603739,Phil,"I'd recommend anyone looking to enhance their stay in Seattle book Nick's apartment; it's within walking distance of most anything in downtown, and sports one of the most comfortable beds upon which I've been able to sleep while on vacation. And Nick, Nick was a superb host! Responsive to our communication, helpful, kind, and efficient, it's impossible for me to say too many good things about him."
258571,1090992,2012-04-06,499785,Raul,"Nick was an outstanding host -- welcoming, accommodating, and easy to communicate with. His place is an excelnt value in a fantastic location. A great overall experience!"
258571,1101104,2012-04-09,1676293,Elise,"Nick was an outstanding host who went out of his way to be accommodating to our requests during and prior to the trip. Check-in and out was flexible and easy. The apartment was very comfortable and the location was amazing and perfect for our needs during this stay. The provided tea and snacks was very much appreciated, we definitely drank a lot of tea! "
258571,1128303,2012-04-14,1650559,SarahBella,"We really enjoyed our stay at Nick's apartment. Nick is the perfect host - we didn't get a chance to meet him but he was a great communicator and made sure we had everything we needed. Cute apartment in a brilliant location. Super comfy bed too! Thanks, Nick."
258571,1138906,2012-04-16,2051190,Murat,"Nick was a great host. He helped with issues beyond his control in a timely manner. He has also been flexible with arrival/departure making it a no hassle stay.

The apartment is also nice and in an excellent location next to great restaurants, bars just in walking distance. It comes with anything you need.

I would definitely consider staying here in the future! "
258571,1155847,2012-04-20,2045410,Tesla,"Nick was a fantastic host, very warm and accommodating. I felt like I could contact him for any issues, though we didn't run into any hiccups. The apartment was lovely, filled with nice touches like the DVD collection and all the utensils and cookware that we needed. Comfortable bed. We actually found two burned CDs in the stereo that are all-time favourite albums of mine, which was a nice surprise! The location was perfect: only a short walk to the waterfront, really close to a grocery store and a stone's throw from Bauhaus, (coffee shop) where we spent quite a bit of time. Coming from Vancouver, it was perfect that the apartment was right off the freeway, and parking wasn't that big of an ordeal at all.

I can't wait to come back and stay here again!"
258571,1176968,2012-04-25,1027085,Casey + Eli,"Nick was a fantastic host in every way - prompt with responses, super nice, and provided all necessary information on Seattle and the apartment (wifi password, emergency call numbers, how to wrangle the remotes for the television and DVD players - the works). The apartment is in a great location - close proximity to Capitol Hill goodies and walkable to downtown. My parents had a blast and really enjoyed having a central place to crash that was more than just a bedroom. Views aren't necessary when you have a comfy bed and access to an amazing city, so the first floor location feels cozy at night and is quieter than we expected. Cheers all around."
258571,1186306,2012-04-26,265099,Emily,"This apartment had everything we needed for a 1 night stay and in a great location, walking distance to everything in Capitol Hill and right near the freeway. Parking wasn't even too bad. Nick was friendly and even was able to let us check in early. "
258571,1202023,2012-04-30,2040037,Christine,"Albeit our stay at Nick's was short, Nick was attentive and a sweet host.

He provided great feedback on tourist spots (Columbia Tower, Bruce Lee's cemetery, etc.).  Nick went out of his way to find us directions and bus numbers to specific spots.  Most of all, my boyfriend and I are big foodies, so we were delighted when Nick suggested a few restaurants.

The 1 bedroom apartment is in Capitol Hill which is relatively close to Downtown and central to a lot of delicious eateries.  We had no trouble finding the apartment and was able to travel freely just by catching a bus a block away or walking.
"
258571,1224130,2012-05-03,32597,Kathryn,My wife's parents and brother stayed here while visiting Seattle. It was a very last minute request and Nick was very quick to respond. He made the rental process super easy and was very accomodating. The apartment was a little on the small side - so probably better for just 2 people - but it was clean and in a great neighborhood. Thanks Nick!
258571,1233609,2012-05-06,281158,Ying,"We had a nice, 3-night stay in Nick's apartment.  The place is located within easy walking distance to the waterfront.  The host was very responsive and checked up on us to make sure we had everything we needed. Recommend."
258571,1250281,2012-05-08,654369,Mark,Great place! Super clean and convenient. I was able to walk just about everywhere I wanted to go :).
258571,1257522,2012-05-10,2020386,Anjali,"Fantastic location! Easy walk to restaurants, bars, waterfront, etc. Close to Amtrak station. Nick was wonderful, he accommodated us, and was really friendly. Would love to be back"
258571,1282932,2012-05-15,858086,Vaughan,"I stayed at Nick's  during my daughter's graduation. Great location on Capitol Hill with all it has to offer, and a 10 minute walk to the downtown area.  Nick is a great host, friendly and responsive to your requests. Nick offers good value for the money and I would stay there again."
258571,1297271,2012-05-17,325772,Justin And Jessica,Nick accommodated us at the last minute as we had an unexpected layover in Seattle.  The Apartment is a great value and is in a very accessible are of Capitol Hill.  Close to several bars and restaurants.
258571,1308543,2012-05-20,271157,Melissa,Great place and price. The location is great and Nick is very nice and helpfull. Highly reccommended!
258571,1324638,2012-05-21,2408886,Nala,Nick was very helpful and made every effort to communicate and to be sure I was comfortable. It's a nice place in a part of Seattle that I really appreciate. I would not hesitate to stay again.
258571,1334233,2012-05-23,732864,Christopher,We had a great stay. Nick was a great host and the place was perfect. Great location and sweet DVD collection.
258571,1343621,2012-05-24,2424827,Tommy,"Nick was great to work with and the accommodations perfect for a getaway to Seattle.  Located near all the great places in Capital Hill and in easy walking distance to downtown, this location was EASY to get to and ample street parking.

Comfortable, clean and quiet the apartment had just about everything you could ask for.  Nick even provided an extra sleeping bag for our 3rd friend to sleep on the couch. Would definitely stay again."
258571,1361187,2012-05-28,1108426,Alison,"The apartment was clean and comfortable, and you absolutely cannot beat the location! There's tons of places to check out in the neighborhood (including a grocery store & drug store), and it's easy to walk downtown and to all kinds of interesting places around Seattle. As he says, Nick is just upstairs and while I didn't need assistance with anything during my stay, he did check in with me and I was confident that he'd be on top of it if I ran into any problems or had any questions. I'd stay here again!"
258571,1404980,2012-06-03,1907058,Jennifer,Nicks place was perfect! It was in a fun area with everything you could ask for within walking distance. We were visiting friends so we didn't get to explore as much of Capital Hill as I wanted to. The apartment is wonderful and has all the amenities you would need. The bed is super comfortable as others have stated. Nick was very attentive and a wonderful host. We will definitely be staying here again when we come back to town.  
258571,1427744,2012-06-06,2360828,Daniel,"I'm a photographer, weddings mainly, then portraits and people.
For all of these types of photography, from time to time, travel is needed.
When travel is needed, then you can simply put me down as an ECSTATIC photographer! Love that more than anything.
Running, exploring, and meeting all kinds of new people and trying as much of the food as I can get my hands on.

Nick's place makes it simple for all of those things. Easy to get to from the train or bus, close to really great coffee shops, and not typical restaurants. 
Nick is there and always ready for a suggestion for you to try something or available if there's any kind of problem. HUGE comfortable real bed, and it's so quiet you wouldn't believe it.  Next trip out to Seattle, I'm definitely contacting Nick first thing."
258571,1471696,2012-06-12,2004645,Xaviera,"Nick is an excellent host and has a great place centrally located on Capitol Hill.  A 2 minute walk to The Pine Box, Bauhaus Coffee, Little Woody's, Baltic Room, Saley, Knee High Stocking Company, and Living Room.  Can't beat that!  The wifi was solid and the bed was comfy.  What more can you ask for!"
258571,1472266,2012-06-13,1413310,Lea Ana,"We enjoyed our stay in Nick's apartment in Capitol Hill. Nick is a very good host and was very helpful and accommodating. The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance to the market and many shops and restaurants. "
258571,1485226,2012-06-15,2340043,Soma,The location cannot be better. Everything was almost walking distance. Nick was very polite and helpful. We didn't need any help but he was eager to help us. It's not a fancy hotel but it was absolutely fine for us. The price was unbeatable for the location.
258571,1518538,2012-06-19,2539404,Evan,"Nick was very willing to be flexible with our schedule, and make the visit fit within our travel plans, which we really appreciated. He offered to hold on to our bags while we explored the city, and made every accommodation possible for us. 
The apartment was clean, well furnished and more than enough for what we needed. Also, the sheets were really soft, which was great too! "
258571,1618806,2012-07-03,1546985,Melissa,"Our stay in Seattle was well worth the money and flying thanks to Nick's hospitality.  Although we weren't able to meet him in person, we were still able to keep in touch with him through messaging and e-mail.  His apartment was very cozy, tidy, and space efficient since it was only the two of us staying there.  It's a good thing Nick provides cups, plates, bowls, pots and pans,  or we wouldn't have been able to cook the seafood bought at Pike Place Market.  The apartment is conveniently found close to Pine St. which is basically the street we frequented everyday.  Westlake Shopping Center, Pike Place Market, and the Seattle Center were all accessible from the apartment through walking down Pine St., monorail, bus, and light rail.  There is also a small grocery mart around the corner just in case you need to buy snacks or ingredients to cook with.  Make sure you visit Saley's Crepes around the corner if you do decide to stay here!

-Melissa and Rosie"
258571,1647834,2012-07-07,2098595,Sam,A great place to stay. The apartment is not luxury accommodation but it is cheap and very well located within walking distance to some of the best parts of Seattle. Nick was great too!
258571,1766767,2012-07-22,1671121,Jamie,"Great place, great location, great host. Wish we hadn't had a rental car from the rest out our adventure but parking was easy enough. Nick made some great suggestions for things to do - even texted to let us know that Will Ferrell and Zach Galifianakis were at the Pike Place Market. "
258571,1808126,2012-07-26,254098,Brian,The apartment was great and Nick was super nice. I wish we had more time in Seattle since we only had a day. Nick helped us pick out some sights to see. Everything meet my expectations and I would recommend staying there. 
258571,1838406,2012-07-30,2745393,Sherwin,My first time using airbnb and it was a excellent experience. Nick met me at his apt to give the keys. He has guidebooks/maps and wifi ready to go. Kitchenette and living room with sofa let's you have 2-3 friends over comfortably. Bedroom is good size with dresser with bathroom connected to the bedroom. Great stay and I would recommend since it is walkable in 10-15 mins to downtown. easy to get to freeway also.
258571,1848113,2012-07-31,1583710,Danielle,My husband stayed a night at Nick's apartment and said it was perfect. It had everything he needed and was conveniently located to get back to the airport. Nick was easy to get in touch with and very flexible. I'm so glad we got a chance to meet him. 
258571,1867073,2012-08-02,2173484,Gemma,"Stayed to two nights in Nick's apartment. Nick was a great host, very friendly and easy to communicate with. Apartment was tidy and had everything we needed. This is a great location and we will definitely stay there again."
258571,1899125,2012-08-06,2383541,Matt,This place is very comfortable and in a great location! It was easy to walk downtown or get a bus elsewhere.  Nick was great about staying in touch and being available for anything that was needed.  
258571,1923821,2012-08-08,2557186,Sharat,"Nick and the apartment were great! The location is fantastic - right off Pine and Pike and near many great restaurants and bars. The apartment itself had all the essentials, including a small but functional kitchen. 

There where two small issues; the apartment is right off a busy street so there is a little road noise and the bed is softer than I prefer.  But the first should be expected due to the amazing location and some people really like soft beds.

But for the price, this place is unbeatable and Nick was super flexible and great!"
258571,1948965,2012-08-11,2809959,Katy,"Nick was a very delightful host. Knowing we were driving into town from Portland, he was flexible with our check in time. When we arrived he greeted us warmly, provided walking directions to downtown (extremely walkable!) and recommendations for nightlife (asking what vibe we were looking for). 

The location, apartment, and host will not disappoint. You will surely enjoy your stay, as we did! One note of caution (which Nick was very forthcoming and helpful with) - parking is a bit tricky. Other than that, it was a great experience."
258571,1981107,2012-08-14,2516169,Grace,The apartment was as advertised and very convenient to downtown Seattle. The building was quiet and there were lots of great little places to check out nearby. Nick was helpful and checked in to make sure everything was going well during my stay.
258571,2002811,2012-08-16,2978219,Virginia,"The place was just as expected and advertised. No, this is not a fancy condo or hotel with valet service, but it gave us what we needed - a place to stay and rest after a week-long non-stop trip from Austin to Seattle to Vancouver to Squamish that included running a half marathon and climbing! Nick was very courteous and helpful. The location is great with wonderful places to eat and drink right around the corner (the crepes place is outstanding). It is right next to the interstate but noise was not an issue for me."
258571,2023352,2012-08-18,3114548,Luana,"Nick's place was perfect. The location is insanely central. Easy easy walking distance from some of my favorite spots on Capitol Hill: Bar Ferd'nand, Taylor Shellfish, and a new fave The Pine Box (three doors down from Nick's apartment). The apartment was clean, private, a perfect home away from home. Nick was super helpful with check-in. I texted and  he met me at the door. So simple! I will definitely stay again."
258571,2062957,2012-08-22,2484767,Kellie,"This apartment is in a great location; really cute neighborhood with lots of dining options/laid back vibe and in close walking distance to anything downtown.

In addition, Nick was a really great host and checked in to make sure we had everything we needed / made sure our stay was comfortable."
258571,2130687,2012-08-28,2423869,John,"Nick's place was great! It was very clean and comfortable, and located within easy walking distance of the Capital Hill bar scene. I would definitely stay here again."
258571,2147884,2012-08-30,3391138,Elisa,Just as advertised! This was a sweet place in a great location and Nick was super nice.
258571,2175951,2012-09-03,1723382,Kelly,"Awesome location, within walking distance to EVERYTHING!  Nick is really accommodating.  This apartment is definitely best suited for only two people as the listing states.  We tried to squeeze a third person in on the couch (Nick doesn't charge extra for this) and it didn't work out too well as the place is pretty small.   My only complaint and reason for rating this apartment three stars is that it needs to be thoroughly cleaned.  The bathroom was very dirty with dust and hair in the tub and on the floor.   That being said, this is a good value for what you pay!  "
258571,2204923,2012-09-05,1618680,Jamie,"Nick was an excellent host! Although he was away for the weekend, the key exchange went perfectly, and he left lots of detailed information for us on how to get around and what amenities are in the area. The place was perfect for what we needed, and was very close walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and bars in Capitol Hill. We will definitely be staying again!"
258571,2247024,2012-09-10,1875105,Sven,"Conveniently located between downtown and the heart of Capitol Hill (5-10 mins walking distance each). 

The appartment was spacious but a bit more on the simple side. Don't expect anything fancy. But for the price it is just a great deal!!! Especially considering the loaction. Safe and friendly environment with tons of stores an cafés / restaurants just round the corner.

Unfortunately the fridge did not work during our three days stay, which was a bit of a let-down. Though I communicated that to Elena (Nick was not there during our stay), nothing really happened. But I'll guess, this will be taken care of by now."
258571,2273995,2012-09-14,2066727,Val,Very convenient location for most things. Easy access from the airport by public transport.
258571,2330674,2012-09-18,1821633,Ana,"The apartment is great, it has everything you need, it's very comfy and really affordable. It's located in a great neighborhood and it's also close to downtown, plus there are plenty of public transit options around. Nick is always ready to answer any questions, he's also very friendly and helpful. I would definitely like to stay there next time I'm in town."
258571,2388553,2012-09-24,2397943,Chuei Yee,"It was a cosy apartment in a very strategic location. Walking to downtown is no problem. The surrounding area is pretty safe during the night. There are quite a number of good cafes, hang-out place, eateries within walking distance. The Wi-fi was fast. Nick is very helpful in providing information & suggestions on where to go, places of interest and how to get there.Thumbs up.  He is also very accomodating with our much earlier check-in. He tried to assist us whenever possible and frequently check with us if everything was ok. "
258571,2433284,2012-09-27,3279841,Jackson&Kteile,Nick communicates very well and he even recommended some local restaurants.  Went out of his way to make sure I had everything I needed.  Took a tour of the apartment but actually ended up staying with a friend.  The apartment is perfect for anyone looking for a reasonable place to stay in downtown Seattle!
258571,2442704,2012-09-29,2500571,Melanie,This apartment is in a really great location and is easy to get to by public transport.  There are lots of nice bars and places to eat just a short walk away and it's very easy to walk into downtown - we walked to Pike Place within 20 minutes.  The apartment is in a quiet block and was very well equipped.  We didn't use the kitchen as we ate out but there was everything you would need to cook if you wanted to eat in. Nick was really helpful and friendly in his communications and although we didn't get to meet I felt that he would have given any help or information if I needed it.  If you want a good location and good value then this apartment is the perfect place.
258571,2482320,2012-10-02,2960123,James,"This place was awesome! It was close to airport transit, in a great neighborhood and very comfortable. Nick was an excellent host-- prompt on all my inquiries and very accommodating. "
258571,2555889,2012-10-09,2625314,Ryan,Great location. Nick was very friendly and helpful! Thanks again!
258571,2581319,2012-10-11,2485430,Harold,"The apartment was clean, cozy, well-stocked, and most importantly, very close to the downtown area! Nick was extremely accommodating. I will definitely recommend anyone coming to Seattle to check out his place! "
258571,2612837,2012-10-15,699054,Corin,"Great location in Capital Hill. An easy walk to coffee shops and downtown. Apartment is cozy and clean. Only difficult part is finding parking, but that's a given for the area. Overall, had a wonderful time. Nick is very flexible and was a great host. Thanks!"
258571,2646756,2012-10-18,1963696,Amy,"Great apartment in Seattle, close and convenient to everything. A fabulous Italian restaurant just up the street. Nick was a very accommodating host and gave us great advice on what to see and do. Would definitely stay there again on future trips to Seattle."
258571,2664869,2012-10-20,3345525,Robert,"I can't say enough good things about nick.  He was quick to respond to every communication, incredibly accommodating, and the apartment was exactly what we needed.  The place was clean and comfortable, and the location is ideal for those wanting to get around on foot, and Bauhaus Coffee (where you can get a cuppa and a Top Pot donut) is at the end of the block! "
258571,2714574,2012-10-25,627641,Matthias,"Nice apartment in a very good location. Close to downtown (10 minute walk) and a lot of great coffee shops, bars, restaurants are nearby. The place is quiet and clean. Good wi-fi. Nick is a perfect host, very accommodating, always helpful and usually replies to every question within minutes. I would definitely stay there again next time."
258571,2744334,2012-10-29,3312228,Corey,I stayed in Seattle at at the apartment in October. The apartment was clean and exactly what I was looking for. Nick was very friendly and helpful. He left travel guides in the apartment for reference and was always available with any questions or concerns. I highly recommend staying at this apartment if you are hoping to stay in Seattle for an affordable price in a great location. I was able to walk to the Space Needle as well as to Pike Place and the Paramount with ease.
258571,2783170,2012-11-01,3303060,Abo,"Clean and wonderful place to stay! Very close to the All the great places in Capitol hill which is a cozy area comparing to downtown Seattle. Just love it! Though we are not able to meet Nick in person, his clear instruction makes the stay non sweat at all!"
258571,2901472,2012-11-17,2804159,Ville,"The place was perfectly located for me and Nick was very helpful. I can truly recommend his place. Next time I'm in Seattle, I will first check if his place is available."
258571,2911082,2012-11-18,4145201,Brian,Nick was a great host.  The apartment was just as described. Great location for a quick overnight trip to Seattle.  Thanks Nick!
258571,2956223,2012-11-25,1887366,Merle,"Nick's place was perfect for our needs. We wanted a place that was walking distance to the center of the city, near public transport, and in a neighborhood with a grocery store and coffee shops. We came to visit our daughter who was in college in Seattle, so having a couch where she could spend the night when she wanted to enabled us to spend a lot more time with her. Nick was prompt and reliable. Only one drawback: the bed was on the soft side for us. "
258571,2992322,2012-11-29,425831,Lydia,"The apartment was conveniently located, walking distance to downtown. Close to all the greatness of the Capitol Hill area.  Apartment was clean and as advertised. Nick was so incredibly helpful and attentive. Rock star host. "
258571,3046679,2012-12-08,353160,Valentina,Nick was quick to respond to the booking request. He left the keys in a lock box and clear instructions on how to get them and get to the unit. He came to greet us and to say goodbye and even hooked me up with laundry detergent! would totally stay there again. 
258571,3109851,2012-12-17,4386940,Christian,"Stayed here for a weekend and the experience went pretty well. Nick was very nice and the communication before/during/after the stay was great. The place itself isn't too fancy but it was good for what was charged and for the convenient location directly in downtown Seattle. Everything was clean for the most part and the place was quiet/warm enough during our stay (December). We booked on very short notice and Nick was more than happy to have us right away which was perfect. Parking is very hard to find (as it is in most of downtown Seattle) so be prepared to either spend a bit of time looking for street parking or paying for a parking lot/garage. Checking in and out went very smoothly and we were even allowed to stay a little later than usual since nobody was booked for the day we were checking out. Nick is a fantastic host! 

if you are looking for an inexpensive stay on short notice in Seattle, I would definitely recommend staying here. Thanks again Nick!"
258571,3123852,2012-12-20,332449,Joanna,Nick was very accommodating and very friendly. The location of the place is amazing. A mere block away from Melrose Market where you can eat at Sitka & Spruce and Taylor Shellfish Co. Victrola Coffee is a block further away. I enjoyed my stay here!
258571,3161894,2012-12-27,3729722,Francisco,"Location is fantastic; right in the middle of Capitol Hill, and within walking distance of Downtown Seattle.  Living room is spacious, kitchen is convenient, bed is comfortable, and Nick (the host) is very helpful.
"
258571,3264071,2013-01-04,1103161,Natalia,The apartment is quiet and convenient. We stayed a week in Nick's apartment without a car but it wasn't difficult to walk or to find a bus to take wherever we needed to go. Nick was out of town during our stay but was still attentive through email. Checking in and out was easy.
258571,3355771,2013-01-15,1193032,Peter,"My friend and I only stayed in Seattle for one night (a mistake) on our way to Portland. Although we never met Nick, his place was easy to find, close to everything and in such a beautiful neighbourhood. Would definitely take advantage of it again. "
258571,3393315,2013-01-22,4239507,Kemi,"We stayed at the apartment for a three day weekend and had a lovely time on our trip. The apartment is in a fantastic location. Victrola around the corner, lots of great restaurants along Pine and Pike. We walked everywhere and all the sights we wanted to see were within walking distance from the apartment. It was also really nice to have wifi and Roku at the apartment. Nick was also super great around communication. "
258571,3435326,2013-01-29,1347018,John,"Great location and privacy.  Great communication with Nick throughout planning and travel.  Checkin and checkout quite easy.  Very comfortable and convenient accommodations, just as described.  A great part of a very fun visit to Seattle--highly recommend it!"
258571,3449449,2013-01-31,426438,Jason,"Fantastic experience, Nick was very hospitable and the apartment was in a central location, easy to walk to downtown! Would definitely stay here again!"
258571,3470649,2013-02-04,4523688,Luc,"All as described. Nick was excelleent in communicating and answering questions. Appartment was perfct for our stay; c;lose to restaurants, grocery and bus.  Some stuff in the pantry was appreciated :coffee, team peanut butter... made life easier.  Parking is a problem but can  be managed creatively. Nick mailed stuff we forgot..much apapreciated.. did not even want us to reimburse for postage.. Will be there again when visitng Sattle"
258571,3718266,2013-03-07,4648802,Duncan,Good location and value for money. 
258571,3793872,2013-03-15,5370916,Bradley,"I was so grateful that Nick could accommodate me on short notice!   
...HE'S MY FIRST!  ... First AirBnB host!
  And Nichole was a welcoming beauty to my first time to Seattle! Wish I could have stayed longer 
Thanks guys!  "
258571,3814587,2013-03-18,4643021,Bruce,"I had a great experience at Melrose Court Apartment. The place was nice, clean, and well-kept, but the best thing about it was the location. It was centrally located in Capitol Hill within walking distance to Downtown and very close to public transportation routes for adventures a bit further out. The host was professional, communicative, and accommodating. I would recommend Nick and Melrose Court Apartment to my friends and family. "
258571,3905637,2013-03-26,3502020,Sarah,"I highly recommend staying here to anyone.  The apartment was clean and cozy and in a great location.  If you want to be able to walk to anything, this is the place.  Nick and Nicole were both very responsive to all of my emails and phone calls.  We were able to find and get into the apartment with no problem.  Since we arrived rather late at night, a lockbox containing the keys was left outside the building and we were given the code to open it.  Using this as a check-in process couldn't have been easier.  We loved having a kitchen and being able to cook our own breakfasts - saved us a bunch over the course of a week.  

We very likely will be back in Seattle soon and I will almost definitely stay here again.  Thanks guys!"
258571,3937771,2013-03-29,4805501,Dave,"It's good value and a great location (we walked everywhere) and the host was very helpful in allowing us to check in early, but the place was not clean (perhaps this was due to our early check in, though much of the dirt had been there for some time). I suppose you get what you pay for!"
258571,3954910,2013-03-30,2999267,Andre,"Had a great stay!
Good location close to everything on Capitol Hill."
258571,3976145,2013-04-01,4214148,Justin,Very nicely located and super easy to checkin and use the apt. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle! 
258571,4044316,2013-04-05,4901346,Barbara,"Our stay in Nick's unit in Seattle was great.  The unit was pretty good, position excellent.  Nick was very obliging when we wanted to move in one day earlier than we had booked. Nicole was very helpful with information and trouble-shooting.  One downside, however, was that i found the unit not clean enough.  It needed a good scrub around the edges, surfaces, blinds and bed valance and carpet. We liked the TV subscription service, much better than usual cable. "
258571,4068884,2013-04-07,3861254,Fern,"This apartment was well-thought out and in a perfect location. We wanted to stay longer after only being there one night. Nicole was so nice, and we will probably be back! "
258571,4098417,2013-04-09,1157811,Justin,"Nick (and his friend Nicole) run a well oiled AirBnB Machine.  Everything was ready to go and setup.  For the price, his Melrose Court apartments can't be beat.  They aren't anything fancy, but for the location and cost, it's great.  Free Wifi is a plus. Parking in the area is tough as Nick mentions, so be warned if you do have a car.  "
258571,4182450,2013-04-16,5407045,David,Really Easy to work with.  Great Location between Capital Hill and Downtown.
258571,4242976,2013-04-22,1350614,Scott,"Great location! Sandwiched between the hip and locally flavoured Capitol Hill, and the downtown core, you can see a lot of seattle from here. Check-in was smooth even though we were terribly inaccurate with our arrival time. Nicole (who helps Nick) was friendly and warm. 
Kitchen has basic amenities that should allow you to make your own breakfasts or snack and thus avoid at least a few expensive meals out.
The apartment itself is pretty cold so bring slippers and sweaters.  The bed is extremely noisy with even the slightest movement so light sleepers beware. 
We have stayed in a few Airbnb accommodations in the last year and in general this place was not as clean as we have come to expect from Airbnb. Some maintenance issues and a degree of run-downness likely due to the building age and quality (outside of Nick's hands) may have contributed to this perception, though some of these problems should be easy fixes (such as some general cleanliness, fixing the bed and shower head).
For international travellers, take note that there is no landline phone, so you will not be able to call taxis or have them call you unless you have some cell phone arrangement worked out. We were not aware of any method to have guests or taxi drivers buzz the apartment from outside either, so plan accordingly.

To summarize, this is an affordable place that gets the job done if you plan to spend most of your time out. It is a great location, but it is not an immensely comfortable place, so you will be keen to get out and explore. 
"
258571,4297646,2013-04-25,2884657,Frédéric,"Nick's apartment has a really great location just at the bottom of the great neighbourhood of Capitol Hill and really near from Downtown.
We did everything by walk.
I recommend this apartment for 2 people only. 
We were 3 people, and the couch for the third person wasn't so good."
258571,4341982,2013-04-29,757274,Joy,Location Location Location. There are so many good bars and good eats in walking distance. A 5 dollar cab ride to Pike Place Market!  Nicole was a very lovely host and very accommodating! Would definitely stay with them again! Thanks so much!
258571,4463929,2013-05-06,395877,Adit,"This was my first airbnb stay and I was very pleasantly surprised. As many reviews already say, Nicole and Nick run a really smooth operation. Everything was ready when I got there -- Nicole was even available for an early check-in -- and the place was as described.

The location is really solid -- close to lots of coffee shops, right near some fun spots close to downtown, and walking distance to anywhere in the city. As some of the reviews already have stated the place is small and is more like a bachelor pad, but it certainly does the trick and you can't be the price and location.

Nick was super responsive prior to the trip in helping me coordinate my stay and Nicole was very accessible and I would highly recommend them to anyone who's considering renting this place."
258571,4490594,2013-05-08,5348674,Wendy,"I stayed here for 2 nights and found it clean, comfortable and location fantastic. Nicole was fantastic in meeting us for an early check in that I requested. Fantastc value for money for afew days exploring Seattle."
258571,4549294,2013-05-12,5678600,Nicole,"was a perfect place to call home while I looked for apartments around capitol hill and south lake union. great location, cozy, clean, and comfortable. "
258571,4614139,2013-05-15,4992284,Kathy,"This Capitol Hill apartment is very close to a number of great restaurants and cute neighborhood shops.  However, it's not the most scenic location - there are quite a few homeless people around the neighborhood and some not-so-cute bars.  

The apartment itself is fairly spacious.  Here are the few problems we noticed:  the couch is very old and threadbare, there was no handtowel in the bathroom (only papertowels in the kitchen), there was no potholder in the kitchen.  "
258571,4631968,2013-05-16,6299085,Carl,"Great location.  Private apartment with 1 bed and 1 bath.  The complex and apartment were a little old and worn, but clean and in a great area.  Host reaction was immediate and communication was great.  If you're just looking for a place to crash then this is a great place, but if your looking for comfort and lounging around then try something else."
258571,4661028,2013-05-19,4328342,Hannah,"This place is great, nick and Nicole is a fantastic host and very helpful. The place is at a good location near bars n pubs n restaurant, good for a quick get away definately recommend it. "
258571,4702803,2013-05-21,1725940,Jill,Nick was a great host. The apartment was perfect for our short stay and in a great location.
258571,4757821,2013-05-24,5660162,Joy,"The good bit is the flat is very clean and in a convenient location to walk everywhere. But the building and the flat are shabby. Flat is gloomy as there is a high wall only feet from the windows. Wouldn't take much to bring it up to scratch - matching china, matching towels, a hand towel and drying up (website hidden) was hopeless but we watched a couple of good DVDs. Flat is quiet and laundry was good. Dealings with Nicole also good."
258571,4790119,2013-05-26,3627113,Maria,"Great location and Nick's manager Nicole was a delight - flexible about early check-in and incredibly helpful.  In terms of  the  lodging itself, the bathroom mat and sofa could use a little freshening up, Nothing the average grad student couldn't deal with. Otherwise the place was clean, safe and conveniently located.  I would happily stay here again."
258571,4872495,2013-05-30,5081096,Kath,"The apartment was all we needed. Really easy access to downtown Seattle (walking distance), great to have basics supplied to make life easier, surprisingly little traffic noise. A great place to stay when visiting Seattle"
258571,5006953,2013-06-07,4608552,Peter And Murat,"We were in Seattle for a week after a great week in Vancouver- we arrived early and Nicole did everything she could to prepare apartment on time in order to make it work for us. Apartment was clean and not cluttered. It is amazingly located for Capitol Hill and downtown. Pine and Pike are lovely areas to sit and drink coffee and people watch. There is a supermarket (QFC) on Broadway (few blocks away) and a convenience store around the corner (City).
The apartment is as it looks in the photos. Fully equipped kitchen and a very comfortable bed. There is high speed wifi that works, and IPTV with netflix etc. This is a ground floor apartment, facing a large concrete wall so if you're looking for an amazing view from your place this isn't for you (they don't claim to have one from the description). The laundry room downstairs is ideal with washer and dryers.

We would happily stay here again. A great stay. Thanks!"
258571,5023639,2013-06-08,251093,Jeff,I was in town for a web convention and wanted to stay in an area that I could get around easily since I did not rent a car. Nick's place totally worked! I had a great time and would stay there again!
258571,5100930,2013-06-12,6146359,Michael,"I did not meet Nicole in person, but the instructions that she left allow me to put my luggage in storage before I checked into later on in the afternoon.  Thanks!

The place itself worked out fine.  I found myself not needing all the space or amenities, mainly because I was out exploring and visiting restaurants  / watering holes right around the corner.  Maybe if I would have stayed a couple more days, I would use more of the space.

I was a bit concerned that it was near the freeway, but it was not an issue.  No street noise at all.  The location was the biggest selling point for me.

Overall this was my first airbnb experience and I was happy with the experience.

258571,5506837,2013-07-03,5600343,Ibby,"We had a great experience in large part due to Nicole. Our flight was delayed, but she made sure to be there to greet us, and she was always pleasant. She was quick to respond to our requests, such as needing hand towels and wash cloths, a rubber mat for the shower and installing a converter box so that we could watch local television channels.  
The apartment was convenient to EVERYTHING, such as cafes restaurants, bars and stores, as well as Queen Anne and Downtown. I highly recommend staying in Capitol Hill. We walked everywhere or took a short bus ride. 
As for some suggestions: The sofa is quite worn out, and could use a replacement. The apartment could use a deep cleaning. On the surface it was fine, but then we noticed cobwebs and dusty areas below the surfaces. The bathroom could use a nightlight. The bedroom/bathroom area is a tight squeeze, so we sometimes bumped into the nightstand. A small light would help to avoid disturbing the person you're sleeping with. Yes, it's true, the bed is very noisy and will keep you awake. Any slight movement creates noise. We made sure to wear ear plugs the remainder of the week, and we slept much better. 
The apartment is surrounded by concrete walls, thus reducing the amount of natural light coming in. However, during the heatwave that occurred during our visit, this came in handy, as the apartment was always cool and comfortable. 
We will definitely stay in Capitol Hill again. Perhaps the same apartment. My only slight hesitancy is wanting more natural light in the apartment, but I noticed that there are two other apartments in the same building on higher floors that offer more light. I will check those out the next time we come up. 
Thanks Nicole for being such a great manager. We really appreciated your pleasant attitude and quick response."
258571,5556719,2013-07-06,5716801,Jemma,"This apartment was a convenient place to stay in Seattle, within walking distance of lots of attractions (definitely check out Bauhaus Coffee and Homegrown in the Melrose Market for breakfast!). It was definitely not the nicest place we stayed on our vacation, but the bed was comfortable. My biggest complaint would be the apartment smelled musty and the dark colors made it feel like staying in a cave. We didn't end up using the kitchen or living room much, because we spent our days out exploring. It was a decent place to come back to, to sleep. The photos are accurate, though I thought it would be a little bigger. Nicole was accommodating and helpful. "
258571,5614638,2013-07-08,4754025,Natasha,It was perfectly fine for the price. I would stay here if you are looking for something very low maintenance and affordable. 
258571,5683838,2013-07-11,2505436,Brian & Eva,"You can't beat the location: right in the heart of Capitol Hill, and steps away from great bars, cafes and shops. Pretty spacious place, though not a lot of natural light, but it has everything you need plus some extras, like a TV with plenty of DVDs, playing cards and local maps/travel books. The bed was a bit squeaky; also important to note the bedroom doesn't have a door. Overall, I'd recommend this place for people looking more for a place to sleep, less to hang out. Nick and Nicole were very communicative, friendly and accommodating with our checkout time. "
258571,5822617,2013-07-18,4976550,Karen,Husband and I were looking for an apartment on Capitol Hill near are daughter. This was the perfect place! Right down the street. Nicole was unavailable in person but was in constant contact via text and email. The place was very quaint and comfortable. Great people living there also. Always willing to give you information as to places to see. Amazingly quiet for location. The apartment was perfect for 2 people. First time we used AirBnb and we weren't sure what we would find. Thank you again Nicole and Nick for making our first experience with AirBnb a delightful one. Apt 107 Melrose Court Apartments. 
258571,5853464,2013-07-19,2112162,Angela & Scott,"Nick and Nicole were great hosts, we did not get the chance to meet them but check in/check out went smoothly and they made sure we got in with no problems. The apartment is located in the perfect spot, great restaurants and shopping is within walking distance. While we were only in town for a night it was perfect for crashing after a long day of exploring. If you like sushi we highly recommend trying Shiros, best sushi we have ever eaten."
258571,6139611,2013-07-31,7636163,Megan,Comfortable stay in a great location.
258571,6173433,2013-08-02,6687332,Tim,"Excellent apartment, fantastic location to explore Capitol Hill, and only 15 mins walk from downtown. "
258571,6458824,2013-08-13,2801185,Jen,"LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION! The Melrose Court is located in the base of Capitol Hill.  Many great places within effortless walking distance:  the Pie Bar (around the corner), the Pine  Box, one block away.  A couple blocks away: Bauhouse Coffee, Melrose Market, Wall of Sound record store, Oaxacan food, Baltic Room. An easy downhill 15-20 minute walk to Pike Place Public Market.

Nicole was a good host.  Check in and check out was easy and she responded to questions promptly before and during the stay.

The apartment is cozy and quiet, despite being in a busy area. The furniture and decor are simple and unpretentious.  It has a feeling of being the home of a busy college student. If sleek is important to you, this place might not be a good fit for you, but it is comfortable and in an excellent location.

The apartment is not spotless clean but it's clean enough - for instance, there was some food in the fridge from the prior tenants.  Again, it was perfect for us, just giving a few tips for those with other expectations.

If you are interested in exploring Seattle by foot and transit (which are the best ways to see the city), I definitely recommend staying at the Melrose Court for your next Seattle visit!"
258571,6553818,2013-08-17,4631042,Tomoyuki,"Nick was a wonderful host. Cozy bedroom, clean bathroom, good price and perfect location. I enjoyed a vacation in Seattle. I would like to stay at his house again. Many thanks."
258571,6624591,2013-08-19,2714512,Kiran,"Great price if you plan on being out and about!

Accommodations are perfect for the road-warrior type. 

 I rented a car while I was in town for a wedding and there is a parking lot located 1 block north of the complex.  It is reasonably priced if you don't plan on returning your car multiple times a day.  

Public transport is readily available as well. "
258571,7032620,2013-09-04,5921904,Tim,Nichole was absolutely wonderful! She was more than accommodating. Our week long stay was enriched greatly by her hospitality. 
258571,7099060,2013-09-06,5106148,Judith,"Dies war das bisher teuerste Airbnb und es war das schlechteste. Niemand war dar. Per Zufall kam ein junger Mann, der den Code wusste und uns einliess. Es stank nach Fisch und war insgesamt ein dunkles Loch trotz Wohnzimmer und Küche. Das Wifi funktionierte nicht. Auf meine telefonische Nachfrage (Combox) wurde gar nicht eingegangen. Ich erhielt zwar ein Mail mit den Anweisungen zum Checking Out, konnte es aber mangels Internet nicht lesen."
258571,7158051,2013-09-09,6667730,Kieron,Great location-only ten mins walk to seattle centre but our fave bars and cafes were actually a block away. brilliant kraft beer pub right there. Everything we needed in apartment and comfortable enough. Low prices considering proximity to city centre. 
258571,7364086,2013-09-17,6675588,Daniel,"Nicole was very flexible and helpful. Apartment is ok, but pretty noisy. We stayed here with a young child and at times didn't feel extremely safe. However, I spoke to locals and they assured me the neighbourhood was fine. Very close to awesome coffee, food and shopping. "
258571,7432016,2013-09-20,5107849,Amanda,"Comfortable apartment, not too far away from the city centre. Surrounded by some pretty cool bars and restaurants in nearby Capitol Hill.  Just don't expect a luxury stay and you won't go far wrong. "
258571,7550569,2013-09-24,679887,Jillane,"Great place in a great location!! Would stay there again!! Would have liked an extra blanket, but I didn't ask for one so not his fault......
"
258571,7689291,2013-09-30,6217561,Bryan,"The perfect location! We walked all around beautiful Seattle and never had to take the bus or a taxi. The apartment is...homely. Totally fine for a few day visit, but not somewhere I'd like to live. Regardless, we were very happy with our stay here. Nicole was very friendly and helpful and made sure our experience was a good one. "
258571,7805359,2013-10-03,6570750,Karyna,"Great location, luckily I found parking super close but it made it stressful worrying about a ticket.  The view from the windows is a little depressing but we only stayed one night so I wasn't too worried. "
258571,7940998,2013-10-09,803377,Christian,"Nick's place was very centrally located to downtown. It was clean, neat and comfortable. During our stay we needed some extra blankets and our host was there immediately to help us out, as well as with issues connecting to the wi-fi. We were properly warned about how hard the parking situation is especially on weekends. The host was very explicit about this during the time of the reservation. All in all, a great place to stay and a great host. "
258571,7987602,2013-10-11,9042531,Zachary,The place was really nice and clean..Better than the pix! Thank you!
258571,8017103,2013-10-13,2631676,Jonathan,It was great! 
258571,8111741,2013-10-16,640981,Michelle,"Nicole and her fiancé were super nice and they did nothing wrong...as far as the apartment review here it is:
-great location, close to downtown, you can walk anywhere, but as far as Capitol Hill it truly was the rudest place I've ever been. The people totally sucked...google ""Seattle freeze"" it's a thing.
-I wanted some light in this dim lighted apartment and the blinds are all broken so you can't really open them. When you do the view is seriously depressing. 
-the apartment was freezing cold, I turned on the heaters and it didn't make the slightest difference I was shivering in my sleep
-I'm pretty sure the sheets weren't clean which is the worst, we both slept in our clothes every night
-the bed in insanely uncomfortable, bring your own pillow cuz the ones there provide zero support. 

. It's an affordable apartment in a good location but certainly not luxurious by any means. Didn't think it would be but I was at least hoping the bed would be clean and not rock hard...."
258571,8145834,2013-10-17,9406889,Nishanth,I needed a place to stay for one night for a concert at the Paramount Theater. Nick's apartment was perfectly located for my needs. The apartment was very clean and Nick was very accomodating!
258571,8203160,2013-10-20,6903010,Harri,The location is excellent and the apartment provides all the things you look for in a safe shelter.
258571,8245699,2013-10-21,9491966,Matt,Easy checkin. Nice location near downtown.  Great price for the location. The apartment was clean and the bed and pillows were comfortable. We liked that the listing was pet free due to my wife's allergies. Parking did take a bit of time at night but in the end we ended up just a few blocks away. This is a basement apartment so the view is of two cement walls but we only used the location to sleep so it didn't affect our stay which was only for one night.
258571,8311368,2013-10-25,8804378,Jet,Location was great in Capitol Hill.  Nicole was very responsive and helpful.  The apartment was clean and everything worked.  An iron was provided upon request.  No complaints.  Definitely a better deal than hotels and other airbnb offerings.
258571,8365265,2013-10-28,4478141,Cynthia,"Convenient, comfortable and easy. Thanks!"
258571,8503718,2013-11-03,6048518,Mari,"We never met Nick, Nicole was the one who took care of logistics, we never met her either but we received clrear easy instructions on how to find the keys to the apartment. Look no further, THIS is the best location. I loved Capitol Hill, everything is within walking distance. Having an apartment to ourselves with everything we needed was awesome. This place is the best!!!"
258571,8762908,2013-11-16,9210888,Candice,Great location. 
258571,9039945,2013-12-02,2075583,Samuel,Cheap and cheerful apartment. Friendly and responsive host. 
258571,9316656,2013-12-21,4261839,Jason,"Apartment was very accommodating and was fine for my three week stay. It was comfortable, and close to a lot of places of interest. Capital Hill is a cool neighborhood with many dining and drinking establishments to choose from. The apartment was also a close walk to downtown and South Lake Union. It was a bit cold, but I did stay during the winter and during a not so normal cold stretch. The extra space heater definitely helped. Nicole answered all of my questions quickly during my stay, and even brought me an iron quickly after I requested it. The roku also was nice, as I got to catch up on some shows on netflix. Would definitely stay again."
258571,9355966,2013-12-23,2642427,Andrew,Nick and Nicole were great hosts! Very accessible and left great instructions.
258571,9495516,2013-12-31,6075364,ErinBlythe,"The location could not be more perfect! Small, but perfectly situated in Capitol Hill. "
258571,9680494,2014-01-05,5724149,Abigail,"Nicks apartment was wonderfully located-it was not only easy to walk to tons of bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill, but also downtown and the waterfront , and if you have a car it is situated right off a highway.

The place was suitable, but I would recommend it for two only.  We had three and it was a bit small for that number of guests, and one had to sleep on a couch.  Also, the bedroom lacks a door which made changing and privacy tough.  Also, make sure to Bring towels as not much was provided.

In all, good value and great location , but a bit dirty and the photos make it seem nicer, brighter and larger than the apartment really is.

Also- nick was a very communicative host and returned my messages and let me check in early- a great accommodator!"
258571,9982840,2014-01-23,2548970,Francisco,"Me and my gf booked Nick's place for a week months before our trip. The apartment looked nice, had good reviews, and wasn't too pricey. 

When we arrived at the airport we took the light rail to Seattle and were allowed to check in early, which was great. Once in the apartment, our first thought was it looked better in the pictures. The apartment needed some cleaning. There was quite a bit of dust built up on most of the appliances and when we checked the bed there were a few hairs on the sheets, so we decided to wash them before sleeping on the bed. When we checked out we tried to leave it clean. We wiped many of the surfaces and even threw away a few things that were expired. 

Setting that aside, the place was pretty comfortable and it had everything we needed. The location was probably the best thing about the apartment, close to downtown, Pikes Place Market, and Capital Hill. Nick also allowed us to check out late, another great thing because our flight was in the afternoon. 

The apartment has lots of potential just needs a bit of work. I would recommend staying a few days but I would probably not recommend staying a week.  "
258571,10126940,2014-02-01,9428556,Samuel,"Clean space, on the darker and older side, and the bed is very noisy but overall it was perfect for the price and you cannot beat the location."
258571,10157197,2014-02-03,4930142,Shauna,Great location. Easy check in and out. Modest accommodations but quite nice for the price.
258571,10244249,2014-02-09,10594482,Robert,Nick was quick to get back to us when we had questions.
258571,10309916,2014-02-12,10954395,Amine,"Just what my girlfriend and I needed, an affordable pad in a great part of the city. We had very few parking issues after switching rentals to a Fiat. Tricky keeping the apartment warm in the middle of winter, but we survived, otherwise we were lucky to find you. Thanks Nick/Nicole!"
258571,10357982,2014-02-15,2520325,Nina,Nicole was really friendly and welcoming. The location of the apartment is awesome; it's very close to downtown but close enough to Pike/Pine and Broadway for some good food and drinks. I recommend this place!
258571,10494255,2014-02-22,11111083,Karan,"A perfectly pleasant apartment at the base of Capitol Hill in Seattle. Very convenient for access to the convention center and downtown Seattle and near a lot of great places to eat in the Capitol Hill area. The apartment is well-suited for two people and well stocked with the basic cooking essentials making it easier for people who don't want to eat out all the time. While I didn't actually meet Nick or Nicole (the onsite manager), they were very quick to respond over email and we were able to coordinate key pickups and dropoffs with no trouble. I'd certainly stay here again if I were to come back to Seattle!"
258571,10532910,2014-02-24,11154310,Nicole,Stay was great. Apartment was clean and close to the Capital Hill scene!
258571,10673815,2014-03-03,497898,Kevin,"For the location, it's hard to beat the price and convenience of this spot. Just a couple blocks from downtown with tons of great cafes and restaurants within easy walking distance. Nicole was quick to address my needs including arriving early. Any issues I had with the property are fairly minor."
258571,10853375,2014-03-10,9795584,Robert,"
This was my first time using airbnb and my experience at Nick's apartment exceeded my expectation. I felt at home from the minute I stepped inside this cute and cozy place. Nicole (Nick was out of town at the time) was very helpful and she made sure that we had a pleasant stay. I stayed with a good friend of mine from Vancouver and we were both amazed how convenient this place is to everything. I would definitely book one of these apartments again when I visit Seattle in the future. "
258571,10955026,2014-03-15,11134485,Karen,"Melrose Court was convenient, quiet, and well equipped. The clean rooms were ample for 2, the bed was comfortable and great coffee was just around the corner. I plan on staying here the next time I come back to Portland!"
258571,11055002,2014-03-18,12386098,Misty,"My friend and I stayed in Seattle for three nights and thought this place was stellar. It had plenty of space for the two of us, and the location is hard to beat. Cool, trendy bars nearby and a reasonable walk down to the market were musts for us. The next time I visit Seattle I intend to stay here again. "
258571,11168550,2014-03-24,592650,Niels,"Spatious apartment in a very convenient location, only a few minutes from Downtown and close to a lot of great coffeeshops (Bauhaus) and bars. The apartment was clean, and there is also a well-equipped kitchen. Key exchange through lockbox. The apartment doesn't have much daylight but that wasn't really a problem as I was out most of the day. "
258571,11269285,2014-03-27,13079238,Leslie,We really enjoyed our stay. There were a few issues at check in due to the cleaning service but Nicole was responsive and had a place for us to store our bags until the room was ready. Nick even called that evening to make sure everything worked out. Perfect location to downtown. Walking distance to everything. It was nice to have a quiet place to come home to after a day of touring. Thanks for the great hospitality! 
258571,11390499,2014-04-01,6920608,Laura,"Check in was easy. Allowed us to drop our bags as we arrived early. Good location, close to everything and walkable if you're willing. If not, transport is close as well. Unsure as to how often the bedding is changed, noticed a few worrying stains and found a pair of socks tucked between the mattress and bed frame. In saying that, I would still recommend this place for the price and location."
258571,11591116,2014-04-08,12730227,Patrick,My first experience using airbnb and it was great. I recommend this location to everyone.
258571,11631465,2014-04-09,7787489,Erik,"This was my 2 friends and my own first experience with Airbnb, and it was a great first impression.  The apartment was a bit small for 3 people and the couch wasn't the comfiest, but the overall experience was awesome.  Smooth key pick up & drop and a great location. Thanks!"
258571,11718490,2014-04-13,13169607,Marc,"I stayed in Melrose Court #107 during a recent trip to Seattle for a business conference. Very happy with my decision. The location of the apartment can't be beat. It's a 5 minute walk from downtown (and the convention center) and a 5 minute walk in the opposite direction from Capitol Hill, which is filled with countless restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and even live music clubs and a great record store (EM).

The apartment was properly priced, had a nice size living room and a small kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. The apartment was quiet and came with Netflix on the TV and a comfortable bed. There was a giant dresser and a closet with hangers. Nicole was available, real nice and very helpful whenever needed.  

Not sure what else to say. This was my first Air bnb experience. I'd for sure do Air bnb again and would also stay in this apartment again on a future Seattle trip. "
258571,11813020,2014-04-15,13322974,Robert,"Place was great, small things like coffee Mahoney not working and the check in was late, but the place was nice and was a great location."
258571,11992044,2014-04-21,7309102,Gregory,"This apartment was clean, and in an awesome location. There were tons of great places to eat right around the corner. They were even awesome enough to provide a little guide book on the awesome things to do in the area!"
258571,12184271,2014-04-25,3266851,Ploy,"Checking in was easy. There are free parking spaces near the apartment which you have to move every 2 hrs in daytime or you can park at public parking nearby. The place is nice, a bit too small for 3 ppl. Everything works well. The heater was broke and Nicole brought us a new one on the next day. Walkable distance to Pike Place market and it is not far from bus stop."
258571,12503612,2014-05-04,6818593,Tianxing,The host is very responsive and helpful. The location of the place is ideal. Walking distance to a lot of the tourist sites in Seattle. Highly recommend.
258571,12626610,2014-05-06,3334267,Matt,The location was great and check-in was a breeze.  Parking is a bit tight but there is plenty of public transport in the area.  A great value for our weekend in Seattle.
258571,12777001,2014-05-11,12398029,Mélissa,"We stayed in Seattle 5days. 
We really enjoyed stay at Nick's appartment. 

Melrose avenue is à gréât location.. You Can do everything by foot. Also it´s à good place for going out the Night : dîner and pub. 

The appartment was so clean, quiet and nicely fitted out. 

Also, information gave by Nick for findinig the place were perfect ! We found it very easely ! 

Thank you so much ! 
"
258571,12866566,2014-05-12,15107553,Allie,"Nick was very helpful and informative about his place in Seattle. I had no trouble finding or accessing the keys to the apartment. The apartment was in a great location, really close to the Paramount theater and a ton of restaurants and bars. "
258571,12946231,2014-05-15,12853272,Chantal,"""Nick's apartment is very well situated, a 5-10 min walk from Capitol Hill and 15-20 min walk from Pike Place Market and Seattle Centre, all places which we have enjoyed visiting. Convention Place is only a 5 min walk as well, and is a major interchange for buses which made it perfect to visit places like the The Northgate Mall (where there is a great Seafood and Sushi buffet restaurant - Bluefin buffet) and the University of Washington. Visiting for 2 days from France and UK, Seattle was our third city break after Toronto and Vancouver where we stayed in modern high-rise apartments with stunning views which greatly enhanced our trips, but the equivalent in Seattle would have proven a lot more expensive, so we chose Melrose Court for its great all-round location. The description and photos on the Airbnb site are accurate, there's plenty of room for 2-3 people (large lounge and fair size bedroom), tv with Netflix, lots of guides and maps for Seattle, not much of a view from the windows unfortunately which have to be left open during part of the day preferably to avoid damp, and Nicole is quick to respond to any queries. All in all a good stay.
"
258571,13045390,2014-05-18,4265352,Brandon,"Location, location, location.   This place has an excellent location.  It is within walking distance to all the cool tourist spots.  The neighborhood around the apartment has lots of cool bars and restaurants to check out.  Plus you can't find a place even close to this price anywhere near the city.   But this is just an apartment.  No frills room but has everything you could need besides a microwave.  This place gave us a good preview of what it would be like to live downtown.   I would definitely recommend this place.  "
258571,13128528,2014-05-20,11050658,Susan,"Everything was good except the couch. It looked to be very old and rough. Almost like it had been in the rain for days on end. Neither one of us wanted to sit on it or even put our luggage on it. Also, the fan in the living room must've had been burnt because it was black and one of the prongs were missing.
Overall though, it was a decent place to stay. "
258571,13227891,2014-05-22,5337899,Darwish,"Great Neighborhood. Clean and simple place. Worth with you pay for it. 

Simple checkin and checkout process. "
258571,14157270,2014-06-13,10394930,Li,"Nick provides plenty of information to his guests---where to eat and play in Seattle. His information is very helpful for tourists and visitors. The apartment is very clean and neat, just as is described. The neighbourhood is very quiet and close to bus and subway stations."
258571,14196654,2014-06-14,8962688,Linda,"Nicole was responsive prior to our arrival. Very good directions were given to the apartment and to accessing the lock box for the key. 

The apartment is in need of a deep cleaning. The bed is very soft. There were no bugs in the apartment."
258571,14542067,2014-06-21,14252457,Nick,Great and very clean space in a perfect location!  
258571,14680920,2014-06-24,2467508,David,"Great communication throughout and thorough instructions about arrival/departure. 
The apartment itself was lovely: exactly as described in walking distance of downtown with all the facilities anyone could need (living room with sofa, TV etc, fully kitted out kitchen, nice bedroom and bathroom).
Haven't got a bad thing to say about it, thank you Nick and Nicole - A* AirBnBers!"
258571,15181154,2014-07-04,11724021,Faruk,It was a very positive experience. Easy check in check out process. Nicole is very courteous. Everything as promised! Clean comfortable apartment. Also the apartment is in a great neighborhood. Nicole leaves list of recommended places to eat. Everything I tried was spot on! Highly recommended to stay here 
258571,15443410,2014-07-09,13072271,Sara,This place was just enough space for our visit! Close to everything we did including walking to pike place market and the space needle! Also Nicole was very helpful and attentive! 
258571,15592047,2014-07-12,16836803,Elea,"The apartment was great, located in a cool neighbourhood and only a 15 minute walk to Pike Place Market. The apartment was clean and had everything I needed. I didn't meet Nick or Nicole during my stay but I had no problems while I was there. "
258571,15674821,2014-07-14,2163024,Jennifer,"We really enjoyed staying at Nick's apt. The location was great and within walking distance to lots of the fun stuff we wanted to do. Nicole is extremely friendly and attentive, and her fast responses were extremely helpful. Check-in/out was easy as well."
258571,15915877,2014-07-18,847242,Brandon,"Great place! Great location, easy to check in and out. Close to everything. Would recommend."
258571,16297323,2014-07-25,12454883,William,"Easy to find and quick to settle in. The apartment is well kitted out with things you need for a short stay in Seattle. The location is ideal for neat local spots like Melrose market or walking up the Pine-Pike corridor. Equally you can walk straight down to the waterfront without breaking a sweat. 
The information provided is more than ample for what we needed and served as a good reference guide and gave us some ideas."
258571,16575351,2014-07-29,15116751,Samantha,"Nick was so organized and had very easy-to-follow instructions on how to check into the apartment.  If you're checking in later in the evenings, this is a great choice for the key is in a lock box out front rather than meeting someone for a key.  Bed was extremely comfortable and the apartment very clean. I lived that there was a binder full of great restaurants to visit nearby.  Parking was a little tricky for it's all street parking, but we didn't have an issue finding a spot. A close walk to Capitol Hill and other popular areas. It is near the highway, but surprisingly quiet for the window faces the courtyard and not the street, so a great place for light sleepers.  All in all very satisfied - Thanks Nick!"
258571,16625409,2014-07-30,17427577,Jaiwon(Chris),"Good location near downtown freely in and out . Lots of utilities in kitchen.  floor and bed cover clean condition is so so. 
Good for more than 3people."
258571,16893478,2014-08-04,279046,Keith,"I stayed here in late July/early August.  I had to arrive earlier than the listed check-in time to drop off my luggage, and Nicole was very helpful and understanding, allowing me to store my luggage until check-in.  The neighborhood is perfectly located, and the apartment was clean and well-furnished.  Because this was a business trip, I ended up staying in on most nights and found the kitchen to be very useful.  On the couple of nights I did go out, I found several great restaurants in the area.  Overall, this is a wonderful place to stay and I would definitely go back!"
258571,17156613,2014-08-08,17161294,Nils,"Völlig reibungsloser Ablauf. Nick hat uns im Vorfeld bestens informiert, so dass wir alles problemlos gefunden haben und es uns direkt bequem machen konnten. Die Wohnung ist einfach aber vollkommen ausreichend für unseren kurzen Besuch in Seattle. Durch die zentrale Lage waren die wichtigsten Sehenswürdigkeiten für uns fußläufig zu erreichen. In der direkten Nachbarschaft gibt es reichlich coole Restaurants und Bars."
258571,17432153,2014-08-12,14194030,Meredith,"The Good: Nicole was communicative and clear, which we appreciated.    We had some issues with the Wifi and she got right back to me to sort it out.  The location was great for brewpubs and restaurants, but a long walk to the ""touristy"" stuff down by the water.  This was fine - we enjoyed staying in a cool, local-populated neighborhood.  Don't be fooled - it's safe at night!
The Bad: I have to be honest about the apartment, though, and say that it was not pleasant.  The smell of mold or just mustiness hit us when we entered, and it didn't really improve even with the windows open.  I am by no means a ""clean freak,"" but the apartment felt dingy.  There was hair in the tub, the floor was dusty, and the comforter felt dirty as well.  The couch is chewed up and should be retired.  There was no laundry detergent under the sink, so we bought some AND paid for the washer/dryer in the basement.  It was not entirely clear that we would have to pay for it in the listing.  "
258571,18144361,2014-08-22,9587115,Carlin,"Nick's place was simple and cozy and we had a good time staying at his place. The listing is accurate and the place is in a good location close by to any number of things in walking distance. I'd note that the bathroom is a little small and for some reason the wifi password wouldn't seem to work for my phone, but we weren't in the apartment long enough for that to be a problem so we didn't bother Nick about it. Sadly didn't get to actually meet Nick, but thanks a lot for letting us stay!"
258571,18467633,2014-08-27,15216240,Mallory,"This was a wonderful place to stay in Seattle.  The location is fantastic, just minutes away from the Melrose Market area, Pike Place market, lots of shopping and fantastic food.  The apartment had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.  The host was very responsive before and during my stay, which put me at ease.  The host even put together a binder with recommended restaurants nearby and information about the listing.  Despite being in a busy area, it was very quiet.  If you are looking to experience Seattle like a local would, this is the place to stay!"
258571,18872532,2014-09-02,14595666,Daniel,"Nick and Nicole were in constant communication about the listing from the time we booked.  They answered any questions we had and were responsive.  The apartment was more than adequate for the stay and was clean and comfortable.

If you are going to Seattle and want a cheap but great place close to almost everything, look no further."
258571,19314927,2014-09-10,7859476,Ruben,"The place was exactly as listed, super convenient to everything!"
258571,19439486,2014-09-12,3599973,Greg,"Nick's apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures. There's nothing fancy about this place, but it's an excellent home away from home. Kitchen, pantry, bathroom were all stocked with items that you would want in your own home. Communication and getting in to the apartment were a breeze. 

Location is really the best part. Capital Hill is an awesome neighborhood and Nick's place happens to be directly in between two of my favorite places in Seattle (Pine Box, which is a beer bar in an old mortuary) and Pie Bar. I would definitely stay here again. "
258571,19523241,2014-09-14,17993862,Edwin,"Nick's place is cool, I could have the whole department during my stay.
The place is big and comfortable. The location is good too, most of the famous spots are in walking distance. 
Nicole provided me the clear information for checking-in. Everything was smooth and easy."
258571,19671666,2014-09-16,1718272,Tiffany,"Great experience with the hosts, who are responsive and informative. The apt itself is comfortable enough but could use an upgrade of furnishings which would help make the overall place more pleasant. I couldn't help but think the couch came from a dumpster dive. It worked for us for 2 nights but if you spend a lot of time in apt or for a longer stay I'd opt for another place that meets your needs. Our biggest concern was location which is awesome. Windows look out to concrete wall a few yards away. Bathroom access is through the bedroom. No bedroom door. Makeshift closet for clothes (next to water heater)."
258571,20494200,2014-09-30,17374459,Julia,Arrived mid evening and there was a bit of confusion with keys.the last occupant seem to have mis laid the keys luckily we were able to get the spare set which is good as the actual keys never turned up again.the apartment was big and very spacious. There was Netflix on the TV which was perfect if you were wanting an early night and had good film choices. The bed was really comfy too! Neighbours seemed really nice also and the location was perfect for us as Capitol Hill was the area we wanted to be in the most!i love Seattle and would come back for sure!cheers
258571,20820142,2014-10-06,1635950,David,"Everything was set up as described. Photos are very accurate. The apt is in a great area for walking, too."
258571,21463048,2014-10-18,831910,Eric,"Nick and Nicole were great!  Excellent communication and getting into the apartment was super easy with the lockbox.  The apartment is a great size and located in a fun area of Seattle with many bars and restaurants near by. The walk to downtown and to Pike's market was short, about 10-15 minutes and there were plenty of bus routes near by.  The apartment was stocked with everything one would need; dishes, coffee, silverware, towels and even an iron!  I would recommend Nick's apartment for you next trip to Seattle. "
258571,21598994,2014-10-20,10334168,Trish,"The location of this apartment is fantastic. It's so easy to walk downtown or hang out in the cap hill area. Communication about checking in and out was really easy. The apartment was quiet and clean. The only downside is the quality of the furniture and amenities. I had a good idea of what it was going to be like based on the other reviews, but there could definitely be some updating. "
258571,21830954,2014-10-25,21224199,Ilia,"Wohnung entsprach den Erwartungen. Instruktionen zur Schlüsselübergabe usw. waren hinreichend. Nachbarschaft war gut, sicher, in Fußnähe zum Zentrum.
"
258571,21928079,2014-10-26,22822068,Chris,The apartment was exactly like the pictures.  Older apartment but clean.  Easy process to check in and out.  Very helpful brochures and maps on the desk.  For people staying multiple nights the netflix account helps a lot.  Parking is very limited in the area but not hard to find.  Overall and good stay and would consider if I'm ever in Seattle.
258571,22508523,2014-11-08,22166669,Nikolas,Place looked exactly like the photo. Good area next to a lot of bars and where its easy to see the area!
258571,22716698,2014-11-12,23221353,Daniel,Extremely close to everything being in cap hill and only ten minute walk to pike place. Loved the location and price. 
258571,23267482,2014-11-27,1887366,Merle,"This was the second time that we have stayed at Nick's place. Once again, it was clean and comfortable. However, communication was difficult.  Checking in and checking out were a problem because of lack of access to keys to the storage unit and the apartment and because of lack of response from Nicole. As a result, we had to make our own arrangements with the previous guest, the subsequent guests, and the cleaning lady -- all of which succeeded, more by luck than by planning.

258571,24300341,2014-12-25,5137236,Courtney,Nick's place was great! He provided everything we needed to know on the front end. The apartment is represented very accurately by the pictures and it is a clean and comfortable place. The location is the best part about it. We could walk to places in Capitol hill and downtown really easily. I would definitly recommend this place.
258571,24561988,2014-12-30,20330290,Khanh,As described. 
258571,24856935,2015-01-03,23089024,Randy,"The place is just like the pictures. It was a little cold at first, but after leaving the heater on the temperature was good. It was the end of December, so it's understandable."
258571,25307741,2015-01-12,22478474,Joe,"Nick's place was exactly what I needed in terms of affordability, and proximity to downtown Seattle where I was attending a week-long conference. The bedroom and bathroom were very clean and well taken care of. Furthermore, the location is fantastic for someone who wants to explore the city. It's about nine blocks from Pike Market, and a multitude of retail stores, venders, bars, restaurants, and more. It's literally two buildings away from the Pine Box, perhaps my new favorite bar, and about a block away from the Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room--It's like Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, but for coffee. I would definitely stay here again."
258571,25415531,2015-01-15,11039561,Kyle,"Apartment was pretty much as advertised.  It was clean, close to downtown, and met my needs while I was in Seattle.  It was great to have save a few bucks by using the kitchen too.  There were a few minor inconveniences that came up, but nothing major and the manager of the space was very quick to respond to emails."
258571,25598340,2015-01-20,24669875,Phoebe,Great neighborhood and a very comfortable place. Thanks Nick and Nicole!
258571,26099455,2015-02-03,9218,Miles,We had a great time staying at nicks place.  The location was perfect for our needs!  Thanks for hosting us!
258571,26225647,2015-02-07,4480393,Mirage,"Great location and great little apartment, within easy reach (not more than 10 minutes by foot) of Seattle downtown, convention center and Seattle transit center. Also very easy to get to from I5. There is a decent grocery store just one block away and lots of Capitol hill cafes around. Parking wasn't a big problem (in PM, though), we were able to park either right in front or across the street.

Apartment is on the ground floor, but feels more like basement, as the windows are looking at supporting walls of the adjacent building. Clean and quiet. Decently furnished and with a small kitchen, missing only a microwave. There were basic supplies in the kitchen, like cooking oil and spices, to get you started cooking.

Best for two people, as the third would really struggle on the couch. The bathroom is very small, but in good working order."
258571,26427127,2015-02-12,26693008,Minnie,"TL; DR - if you are a germaphobe or have a strong sense of smell - look elsewhere.  Otherwise, great location.  I was able to walk everywhere and saw most Seattle attractions and eateries this way.  Within the neighborhood, there are very good restaurants and bars.  Pike Place about 10 blocks away.  Nicole, the apartment manager, was easy to get a hold of via the website.  The key access was easy, since it is stored in a keybox near the entrance.  

Like other reviewers mentioned, what you see is what you get.  Just imagine these pictures with less brightness (The windows look out into a high cement wall, so not much light - but it is Seattle anyway).  During the time of booking this place, I thought it was a good price for 4 nights and we won't spend much time at the apartment anyway.  After staying there the first night, I wish I spent a little more for an updated airbnb or a hotel.  What isn't pictured and what I didn't account for, was the smell.  Look at that couch and just think about what that couch should/would smell like.  There was an overall mildew/moldy smell that perhaps came from the lack of air circulation and piled wet leaves right outside the windows.  Nonetheless, it was this smell alone that made my stay uncomfortable.  I had to go out and buy some air fresheners, but that was only a temporary fix.  The bed was really squishy, the bed frame very squeaky.  If you are used to a firm mattress, this bed might be a problem for you.  The pillows were really stained and yellow.  I was so happy I brought a thick sheet so I was able to cover them.  I think there was an old blood stain on one of the blankets.  I tried my best to just sleep with a sheet.   The bathroom, and most importantly the bathtub, seemed clean.  There was just that mildewy smell we couldn't escape.  We didn't use the kitchen, but there was a leak that would come out of the counter area.  I think a previous reviewer said it came from the shower.  "
258571,26738186,2015-02-18,19871420,Leticia,Convenient location. House is just as pictured. 
258571,27649847,2015-03-09,25762400,Loradane,"Apartment was as described. Only concern is that the bed was really squeaky, but overall the apartment was clean. Roku box was a great addition and location was perfect since it is pretty close to downtown and has several bars and restaurants in the area. "
258571,27820971,2015-03-12,3170509,Franz,"Great and efficient host, place was exactly as described. This is my second stay and would stay again!"
258571,28080478,2015-03-17,6705641,Corinne,"Nick's apartment was absolutely wonderful!  My friend and I stayed for 5 nights while on a bestie trip to Seattle.  She took the bed while I took the couch, and we were both very comfortable.  Having a kitchen was super helpful, and the apartment itself was close to a lot of cool bars and shops.  I would definitely recommend this place.  Bonus:  There's an arcade bar right on the corner."
258571,28305404,2015-03-22,26274235,Adam,"*Easy to get the keys for the apt.
*Easy walk into Pike and Pine and the Westlake hub for airport links.
*Capitol hill, for me, turned out to be my preferred choice for an evening out. The area had a good vibe, some interesting people, some history (a few metres up the street is where Bruce Lee had his funeral) and plenty of options for food, breweries and coffee.
*The apt would be a tight squeeze for 2 people, but there is no reason, other than to sleep, to spend time in the apt when you are in Seattle. Get out and explore."
258571,28576661,2015-03-26,22406245,Libby,"Great place, great location, great host! Exactly what we were looking for."
258571,28636867,2015-03-27,29687562,Jon,Everything was as described by all other positive reviews. The apartment was clean and checking in was a smooth process. I recommend this place to anyone traveling through Seattle. 
258571,29156897,2015-04-05,17179556,Rachel,"I never met Nicole or Nick, but the check-in and check-out process went smoothly. Nicole was usually prompt to return my messages, and allowed us to use the storage locker for our luggage after we checked out while waiting for our flight. Since it's a garden apartment, there was very little natural light, and a musty/mildew smell despite air fresheners and multiple dehumidifiers. The bed was very soft and squeaky, but comfortable. If you leave the bedroom window open, there is a considerable amount of traffic noise. The furnishings in this apartment could use some updating, but the neighborhood is absolutely fantastic. Lots of restaurants and nightlife, and a short walk to downtown. If you are looking for a budget stay in a vibrant neighborhood, this is the place."
258571,29552854,2015-04-09,2718153,James,"I found this to be a delightful location. Central to both The downtown and capital hill sections of the city. There is a lot of interesting night life in the area. 

As for the apartment, it was a clean and very cozy place. It's an ideal place for a couple, or just a lone adventurer. Check in/out was easy and well managed. 

I would highly recommend this location to anyone headed to Seattle. "
258571,29824731,2015-04-13,27295773,Adam,"I adored this awesome little apartment in Capitol Hill. It has everything you could ever want from an airbnb: location, space and value. 

I could have literally went to Seattle and scouted the city, and still not come up with a better location than this spot. It is walking distance to everything. The neighborhood is filled with the best coffee shops in the world, amazing food and fantastic drink. 

The space itself was really nice too. I mean, just look at the pictures! It is as advertised. Excellent storage as well; the provided bureau is enough for 2 people. Also, it is stocked with tons of personal use items you may have forgotten: everything from tylenol to shampoo to spices in the kitchen. The alka-seltzer was a particularly nice touch after a long nite of drinking in all the awesome NEARBY AMAZING BARS. 

Communication was super easy: in and out without a problem. Nicole left a detailed sheet of paper. 

Overall, this is an amazing spot and I give it the highest recommendation possible. "
258571,30259717,2015-04-19,6263165,Akhil,Listing description was fairly accurate. 
258571,30443382,2015-04-22,27107587,Hilary,"While I would not choose to live here personally, as far as a place to crash while you're in town, it's awesome. The location is perfect - you're right between downtown and Capitol Hill, and it's really walkable! I loved my vacation to Seattle, and honestly, this place was a part of it. I got a feel for the neighborhoods, too, and I felt safe at this place. This apartment did everything we (my friend and I) needed while we were in town for a conference: place to sleep, shower, get ready, put leftovers, etc. We were mostly out and about, minus sleeping, so we didn't chill there too much. Overall good, but nothin' too fancy."
258571,30586734,2015-04-24,514063,Timm,Great experience. Just as described. The place was easy to walk to where I needed to go and felt safe. Nicole was super attentive as things came up. Thanks! 
258571,30924351,2015-04-29,26948672,Susie,"Our experience was pretty good. Location was perfect and the room had all the basics and more. The room was a lot older than we initially expected, but it wasn't really a problem for us. Only thing that was difficult was parking. We had rented a car and finding parking was a bit of a hassle. We would eventually find a street parking spot, but usually not before driving around a bit. 

Also we couldn't find an outlet in the bathroom, so we had to dry/straighten/curl our hair in the living room using our laptop camera as a mirror. It wasn't a big problem for us, but just be prepared. "
258571,31935553,2015-05-12,1952188,Jay,"Perfect location! Simple, clear instructions, great communication. A smooth and easy stay! Hope to come back some day. Thanks!"
258571,32174165,2015-05-15,25477084,Ben,The host is very well organized and is quick to reply to emails. The location of this flat is amazing. This flat is within 30 secs of great pubs and restaurants. There is plenty of buses only minutes walk away. The flat is cosy but has everything you need. We would stay here again without question. 
258571,32411125,2015-05-17,11022858,Ian,"The apartment was a nice private space in a fantastic location for walking to Downtown and in Capitol Hill, although parking got tricky. Checking in and out and communicating with the hosts went very smoothly, would recommend if you want to be staying in a vibrant part of town!"
258571,32940955,2015-05-23,869562,Matthew,Great location. Easy check in/out. Don't plan on spending too much time indoors.
258571,33503942,2015-05-29,24967881,Abhinav,My parents had a great time staying at Nick's house in capitol hill. Nicole is a great host and is very welcoming. The house had all essentials and I will recommend this place for any future visitors!
258571,34041960,2015-06-03,18099255,Candice,"Nicole gave us very thorough information, as we were checking in after a late flight. The apartment is clean and convenient to the highway. Some items in the apartment need upgrading (broken blinds, old shower curtain). Very close to restaurants, bars and coffee shops. Parking was easy late at night but that might have been lucky."
258571,34420972,2015-06-08,12058393,Patrick,"Has all the basic amenities, easy access in and out of building, quiet, and has the best location in the city!!! The neighborhood is bustling with things to do, downtown is close by, and public transit is close by. Also Nicole is very explicit in her instructions and timely in her response."
258571,35433128,2015-06-18,21063998,Berk,We had a great time in Seattle thanks to Nicks cozy apartment. The apartment access is super easy and it is located in a great spot. The apartment has all the amenities you might need + internet! Parking was indeed a little tricky but it is not that hard to find spots in the surrounding streets. 
258571,35647405,2015-06-21,2213218,Kelly,"Overall, a decent place to stay in Seattle if you don't plan on spending too much time indoors. Close to many entertainment options, which was very convenient. Major downtown must-sees were generally between 25-35 minutes walking. 

Pros: All instructions provided by Nicole were great. Easy to get in the building complex with the provided instructions. Relatively convenient location and amenities provided. 
Cons: With three people, it was a bit tight. Wi-fi connection was a bit finnicky and slow. The apartment complex itself is a bit older, and this can be felt throughout the building, with some muskiness. "
258571,36097709,2015-06-25,12236952,Arelda,Great location!
258571,36389112,2015-06-28,14103060,Christopher,"Very satisfied with my stay in Capitol
Hill, this location is great. Was able to walk to Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, the art museum and Space Needle. The apartment provided plenty of space for me, and my only complaint would be that the mattress is very worn/saggy and needs to be replaced. Other than that, I was very happy with my stay and would stay here again. "
258571,36763869,2015-07-01,11277369,Katherine,"The location in Capitol Hill was great. It was a convenient to many restaurants, shops and bars. Checking in and out was easy and Nicole was very easy to reach. A few downsides were the lack of an outlet in the restroom and while the couch was comfortable but seemed dirty. It is a safe area despite the outward appearance. Much more suggested for 1-2 guests than 3. Overall a fine experience. 
"
258571,37292288,2015-07-06,7661125,Tiney,"This property is in a great location that's walking distance from many unique bars and restaurants. We actually acquired a favorite while we were there -- Six Arms, try it! It's also a hotspot for Uber pickups, since it's right by the highway. The apartment itself was tidy and even though there was a heat wave and no A/C, it was kept cool by being on the bottom floor and the host provided several fans to chill the space. The kitchen is pretty minimal (no microwave). But if you're traveling with a party of 3, you'll fit no problem. The host was also very responsive and happy to provide anything we needed. "
258571,37845285,2015-07-11,31512581,Ysett,"Wir sind 5 Nächte geblieben. Und es ist eine Apartment ausreichten für 2 Leute. Es hatte alles man man so braucht. Die Einrichtung Entspricht genau den Bildern (wirkte aber im Original dunkler und ein bisschen kleiner, aber sonst stimmt es)

Gut: die Lage ist unschlagbar. Wir konnten alles zu Fuß erreichen was wir brauchten. Die Wegbeschreibung von Flughafen war super einfach, und die Zeitangabe kommt gut hin. Und das Ein- und Aus-Checken war problemlos und Funktionierte über ein Schlüsselkasten vor der Eingangstür. Die Küche war mit alles Ausgestattet was man braucht. In der Direkten Umgebung waren viele Möglichkeiten zum Ausgehen, Soweit Interesse dazu da ist. Aber mann kann auch gut einen Gemütlichen Abend vor dem Fernseher auf der Couch machen. Und sollte man was vergessen haben, findet man im Badezimmerschrank und Küchenschrank lauter Reste die man auf brauchen kann. Und im großen und ganzen war das Apartment Sauber.

Neutral:  Das Gebäude an sich merklich in die Jahre gekommen. Mann findet überall kleine Macken, aber das ist eher eine Schönheitssache. Eine schöne Aussicht ist nicht zu erwarten. Mann sieht eine Wand und 6 vergessen Bälle + 1 Frisbee rumliegen :), aber dafür schaut auch keiner rein und man kann ungestört lüften. 
Die Kommikation mit Nicole war auch okay. Die Größe vom Bad ist ausreichend.
 
Schlecht: Das Bett knartscht war wirklich sehr laut. Für Leute mit einen leichten Schlaf nicht geeignet. Jedes mal wenn sich einer gedreht hat, hat man den anderen mit geweckt. (was schlecht ist für 2 Leute die nicht die gleiche Aufsteh-/Schlafenszeit haben) 
Und die Dusche ist gewöhnungsbedürftig.
Das mit der Internetverbindung hat nicht so gut geklappt. Es hat am Anfang eine weile gedauert bis wir mit den Handy's drin war. Und nicht alle Geräte konnten sich erfolgreich verbinden. 
Und Mann kann nicht kochen ohne den Rauch/Brandmelder vorher Lahm zu legen! Er reagierte sogar als wir nur den Toaster verwendet haben. Und ich habs nicht ganz verstanden wie man ihn wieder richtig einschaltet.   


Im großen und ganzen kann man sagen, das Apartment hat vor und Nachteile. Es muss jeder selber abwiegen. Wir würden wiederkommen. Vielleicht ein anderes Apartment (das mit dem Bett hat uns wirklich gestört).  Aber sonst haben wir unseren Aufenthalt genossen. "
258571,38122605,2015-07-13,32994400,Letty,"I was given the wrong lockbox code for the storage unit, which caused some confusion, but after 10 or so minutes, Nicole was able to buzz me in. The bed also was very uncomfortable, but other than those two things, they stay was good. Great location and clean."
258571,38489068,2015-07-16,31624721,Christine,"Really enjoyed the location and found lots of great restaurants in Capitol Hill within minutes of this place. We arrived by Boltbus which stops by the train station, right at one end of the bus tunnel. It was easy to just catch any bus to the other end of the tunnel and then walk a couple minutes to the apartment. Nicole was very communicative and the lockbox system was so simple. The apartment itself is older and basic so don't expect luxury.  However due to the price and location we would stay here again. We recommend Pike Street Fish Fry for lunch; Pine Box, Elysium, and Six Arms for drinks or dinner; and for dessert - Molly Moon's and Pie Bar."
258571,38743640,2015-07-18,36300710,Mark,"Well...the location is 5 stars. Located near all the best Seattle has to offer.  That being said, the apartment itself is extremely outdated.  On your way up to the door you'll see tons of spiderwebs and dust. First step in the door you will smell mold. Dehumidifiers all around the apartment.  Popcorn ceilings and hot water that lasts about 5 minutes. Advertised a couple items that were not operable. Wifi didn't work, refrigerator did not work. (Brought leftovers home that went to waste. ) We found a bug in the bathroom as well. Place was neat but I felt like we were overcharged for what we received. Did the location make our stay worth it?...yes. Would we stay here again.? Most likely not. We're pretty easy to please, but this was a bit too much. Hate to right a bad review but I would have liked to know this beforehand given the price.  Host was very nice though! "
258571,39007872,2015-07-20,4824675,Tony,"The listing and itinerary was really clear. I didn't spend too much time in the apartment, but the bed was very comfy and the area was ideal, the biggest plus for me. It's nice to be within walking distance to so many restaurants and the downtown tunnel corridor for public transit options. I'd stay here again if I were in Seattle."
258571,39251982,2015-07-21,38702551,Nash,"Great location, clean apartment, simple entry process. Parking is a bit of a hassle, but we got a good night of sleep and were within walking distance of several bars and restaurants."
258571,39913553,2015-07-27,19641939,Eimear,"This accommodation was easily accessible and we arrived to a spotlessly clean apartment. Great for what we needed, something basic and comfortable to leave our bags and rest our heads each night! There is lots of parking close by which is very convenient. Neighbourhood was great, bars, restaurants and coffee shops all nearby and a short stroll down to pike place market."
258571,40154780,2015-07-28,33266981,Page,"Location location! This apartment was exactly what I expected. Has everything you need without any extras. Very affordable in a prime location. The property was clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay here again. Thanks, Nick!"
258571,40347004,2015-07-30,36745342,Dublin,The apartment was very cozy and fit our needs perfectly. Great neighborhood with easy access in and out. Only hard part was parking. We had to search and search to find a place that allowed us to park overnight and not have to renew at 7am.
258571,40503048,2015-07-31,1841111,Jeffrey,"Nice place, close to capital hill"
258571,40899813,2015-08-03,1623756,Jeff,"Nothing fancy but perfectly serviceable apartment, great value for money in the heart of capitol hill. 

Light sleepers beware: very, very creaky bed."
258571,41924479,2015-08-10,30124799,Chris,The price for the place was cheap and affordable. The listing and itinerary was clear and concise which helped a lot with getting access to the apartment and parking. The apartment was cozy and was at a great location. You have access to variety of restaurants on Capitol Hills and not too far from the Seattle Conventional Center. There are a lot of Edward Norton movies but not a lot if you love Edward Norton movies. 
258571,45238024,2015-09-01,30233816,Skyler,This place was in such a great location and was a great price. It was more or less exactly what I expected from an apartment in seattle. I would highly recommend it if you need a place for a few nights. It's cozy and has a fridge and stove for preparing food and snacks. 
258571,46617818,2015-09-12,37847195,Kelly,"Nicks place is in a great location, and is walkable from the Westlake light rail downtown. There is a courtesy kit with shampoo, conditioner, etc. and a hairdryer. If you don't see the electrical switch in the bathroom, look up! It's in the light fixture.  Very comfy spot. Only negative - the bed is very creaky. If you're a light sleeper, and you're with a partner that turns a lot, this could be a problem. Other than that, it's a great spot!!"
258571,46883890,2015-09-14,38088065,Jenni,"First off, an honest review of the actual apartment. This place could use some updating. The apartment complex itself is pretty quiet, no loud neighbors, which was nice. The room is down a semi creepy hallway next to a storage unit where we were able to keep our stuff when we first arrived (Read on later for storage unit use.) The apartment is small, but two people fit pretty comfortably. There is a faint musty smell, but that disappears pretty quickly if you open some windows and turn on the fans that are provided. The couch is old but comfortable, however I would not suggest that you use this as a sleeping option. There is a queen sized bed that is actually quite comfy, but was so creaky that we would wake each other up sometimes if we rolled over in our sleep. The bathroom was about as basic as it gets and I had two complaints: 1. There were no outlets in there and no other mirrors anywhere in the apartment which made doing our hair a little bit trickier. 2. No water pressure in the shower and anyone over 5’8” is going to need to do some bending to get underneath the shower head. We barely touched the kitchen, so I really can’t say how conducive this place would be for cooking. Oh and one more thing, the outlets in this place SUCK! They plugs literally just fall out of the wall and then hours later you realized your stuff hasn’t even been charging. Luckily there are some power strips scattered throughout the apartment so I suggest you find a reliable socket and plug everything into that. Overall, the apartment was not the most pleasant looking place I have ever stayed, and the view out the window was of a beautiful concrete wall with a swastika etched into it, BUT, it worked for our two day weekend trip and very minimal time actual spent in the apartment. This apartment’s saving grace is its location. Capitol Hill is awesome. It seems to be very up and coming and full of yummy restaurants, coffee shops, and the most amazing Starbucks I have ever been to (Starbucks Reserve, check it out.) The apartment is about a 25 minute walk to the Space Needle area and a 15 minute walk to downtown and Pike’s Market. The location really could not be better. Review of our host, Nick and the Pillow company. There is plenty of communication sent out before the trip giving out all of the information about the apartment and how to access it. This is much appreciated and made it very easy to find the apartment and get the keys. We did end up having some troubles with finding some keys at the end of our trip, but we were able to directly contact Nick and he was as nice and helpful as could be. He was immediately concerned with our situation and quickly offered to drive to the apartment..."
258571,47176621,2015-09-16,1688913,Andrew,"I had a mixed experience staying at Nick's apartment.  On the plus side, I found the check-in process to be smooth, the apartment was conveniently located near public transportation, and the surrounding Capitol Hill Neighborhood was charming.

In terms of drawbacks, the apartment isn't very inviting.  There is very little natural light, none of the electronics seemed to work (i.e., television, wi-fi), and I couldn't find a thermostat to regulate the temperature.  In retrospect, for the price I paid, I think other options in the same area of Seattle may have been a better fit.

Furthermore, I actually never communicated with Nick.  The property is managed by a third-party (at one point it was an individual then it switched to an independent company named Pillow). Although  I found both property managers to be amicable and responsive, it seemed to take away from the benefit of staying in another person's home.  That is, I think this style of management also contributed to the lack of ""creature comforts"" in the apartment.  For instance, I imagine if someone regularly lived in the apartment, there would be an ironing board and easier means of regulating the water temperature in the shower.

All that to say, this apartment wasn't my best, nor my worst, experience using AirBnB.  If you're primarily looking for a place to lay your head, find the price to be reasonable, and don't mind staying in an apartment managed by a third-party, then this could be a really good fit for you.  If you prefer to cook a few meals at home while traveling and enjoy having natural light where you stay, then you might consider looking elsewhere."
258571,47689074,2015-09-21,7796455,Ivan,It was great! The apartment is located in a nice area. We really liked it!
258571,47961425,2015-09-22,9694394,Zheng,"Nick has signed up with (website hidden) to maintain his apartment, who are very quick to respond at most hours of day. The apartment is very conveniently located to some trendy eateries nearby, as well as reasonable walking distance to the Space needle.
The apartment itself has all the necessary facilities for a comfortable stay, along with a decent size bathroom.

The only downside I'd say is the overnight parking, if you want to park there's a high change of driving around for an hour before a spot opens up. It's probably worth paying for a garage spot."
258571,48866565,2015-09-29,34293015,Jessica,"The location of this space was perfect! It was within walking distance of many of the places we wanted to go and we rarely had to uber. The host provided instructions in a timely manner and someone even stopped by to make sure we had checked in ok. The apartment is a good size for two people; I would not recommend that anyone sleep on the couch. Like other residents have stated, just be sure to open the windows during the day (if it's not raining) to air it out, the bed is creaky, the shower is small and there are not outlets in the bathroom - you have to do your hair in the kitchen! Because we spent most of our time exploring, we just used the space to sleep and get ready and for that it was perfect! "
258571,49766664,2015-10-06,15678008,Emmanuel,"El apartamento está situado en una zona muy cerca de downtown y hay varias estaciones de Pronto (sistema de alquiler de bicicletas públicas) que te permiten moverte fácilmente por la ciudad.
El barrio tiene muchos restaurantes y es bastante tranquilo. La pasamos muy bien con mis esposa. "
258571,50880979,2015-10-15,11241488,Natasha,"Terrific neighborhood--apt is right in the middle of Capitol Hill's many restaurants and bars. This is a great crash pad for those used to urban living. Nothing fancy, but totally adequate. It was clean overall, but dusty in areas--couch was old & worn, and I couldn't reach the outlet next to the bed (lamp was plugged in but stereo/alarm was unplugged). I would stay again. Nick & Pillow service were communicative & responsive. Note: parking is very difficult in this area. I don't recommend if you have a car."
258571,51112993,2015-10-18,4565135,Steven,"The apartment is clean and presents as advertised. The location is quite convenient to downtown Seattle. The company which manages the property was supposed to provide the code with instructions to get into the property 2 days prior to our arrival, which they didn't. I had to call them from the airport. They responded promptly. However, outside the building there were 6 lock boxes and we had to fumble in the dark to figure out which lock box was the right one. Otherwise the stay went smoothly."
258571,51610668,2015-10-22,1017499,Monte,My wife and I absolutely loved staying at Nick's place in Seattle! It's located in a cool urban neighborhood and is a very quick walk or Uber ride to all of the city's popular attractions. We felt the apartment was very safe & secure and had no concerns about safety. The apartment itself was very clean and nicely furnished. Clean linens and towels were provided. The check in/out procedure with Pillow also went very smoothly with no problems. We will definitely look to stay here again if we return to visit Seattle. 
258571,52380830,2015-10-28,43953198,Stacey,"I absolutely loved this apartment! It was convenient to everything that I needed and wanted to do while in Seattle. It is a place that I have already looked at booking again. The bed is amazingly comfortable as is the sofa. The building is very quiet with a nice courtyard and I appreciated the fact that there was salt, pepper, spices, etc, on hand if we wanted to cook. The space was very clean and it felt like my own apartment. The only thing I wish it would have had was washcloths, but I can bring my own to stay there again. Thank you, Nick, for having me!"

7390195,40160792,2015-07-28,3150034,Jennifer,"Even though I didn't get a chance to meet with Kenny, he was an awesome host! I met his roommate, Jon, and he was very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean and tidy, and the bed was incredibly comfy. There is a great view of downtown from his balcony. tHe provided plenty of toiletries, towels, and amenities during my stay. Since it was my first time in Seattle, he compiled a list of the best things to do/see/eat within and outside of the city. The neighborhood was safe and convenient to all of the great things Seattle has to offer. I would highly recommend staying at Kenny's :)"
7390195,41004592,2015-08-03,39192197,Karen,"Had a really pleasant first AirBnB experience! Even though Kenny was out of town, he kept in contact through text and left a print out of suggested places (we went to Brave Horse Tavern and it was great!). Location is great; the bus stops are really convenient. Thanks, Kenny! "
7390195,41666774,2015-08-08,38914948,Mollie And James,"Both hosts were extremely accommodating and friendly. They responded quickly to any enquiries we had. 
The bedroom was a good size with the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in. The view was brilliant from the flat and we loved walking around the surrounding areas. The bus stop was close-by so getting into downtown Seattle was cheap and a short journey. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone."
7390195,42048956,2015-08-10,39766979,Trevor,"This was my first time using Airbnb and the experience was awesome! Kenny was a really great host and super accommodating. My buddy also needed a place to stay last minute and Kenny was totally cool with that. We ended up hanging out with Kenny for a while playing guitars and sitting out on the back deck. I was in town for a wedding and places were really hard to find but this ended up being perfect. Pleanty of parking on the road, safe neighborhood, easy to find and like the listing says a really great view. I'd definitely stay here again!"
7390195,42473640,2015-08-13,2949003,Eric,"Kenny was super awesome! When I arrived,  he was very welcoming   and had the room all set and everything was nice and clean. There was a basket with all the things I needed and extra goodies as well. He continually was making sure everything was in order."
7390195,42800145,2015-08-15,41160687,Becca,"The listing description and pictures are very Accurate. My friend katie and I flew from CT to WA and our 2am arrival was no problem for Kenny. He simply left the key in a locked box for us. When we walked in he had a great welcome basket with plenty of towels and a typed packet full of ideas and his favorite spots around seattle. The bed? Out of this world.  More comfortable than my own. I wish I could go back! Although I didn't have the chance to meet Kenny he kept in touch and we tried to meet up a couple of Times but it didn't work, he was more than a helpful host! ""Roommate John"" was home and we were able to go out with him one night. He was a really nice guy and showed us around to some great bars. Definetly a highlight of our trip. If im ever in seattle again I will for sure be back to Kennys!"
7390195,45206687,2015-08-31,12323718,Beth,"Kenny is very nice and very easy to communicate with. We had a long crazy schedule, so we didn't get to meet him, but we were fully informed.
The apartment is so wonderfully located between Ballard and Belltown. We were able to access everything quickly. The neighborhood is super nice and the view spectacular, even more so than his photo. The apartment is basic and clean. Our friends stayed at a mediocre hotel for $300 so we felt like we got a good deal. The bed was so comfortable! I mean really comfortable. "
7390195,45360751,2015-09-01,22043506,Claire,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7390195,46669956,2015-09-12,43536753,Tracy And Brent,Great location. We did not get to meet Kenny but roommate Jon was very friendly and helpful. Room was just as described. Bed was super comfortable. Would definitely recommend and we will definitely book again if we are back in Seattle. You can't go wrong with this one. Thank you so much Kenny. It was a pleasure. 
6545246,45307387,2015-09-01,4308645,Drew,There is a pretty nice welcoming community of people staying here. It is a hostel-esque level of accommodations -- you sleep in tight quarters with other travelers & you make your own bed. Pretty good location. The cancellation policy is very strict: I found a real apartment earlier than expected so my room sat empty for over a week.
8310398,46687696,2015-09-12,10577246,Sarah,I contacted James at the last minute to book a room in Seattle. He was extremely responsive and flexible with my late pick up of the keys. A 5 minute walk away from the cafes and restaurants.  3 minute walk away from the Ballard locks.  Extremely convenient location and the room was very clean.  
8310398,46848103,2015-09-13,43908010,Julia,"This was our first air bnb experience and it was great. James was a wonderful host and our room was perfect for what we wanted. It was within walking distance to the heart of Ballard, so we didn't even have to drive to enjoy a variety of great restaurants and nightlife. The room itself was spotless, the bed comfy and the special touches (plush towels, coffee, bottled water) made us feel at home. Overall, we would recommend James' place to anyone! "
8310398,48039612,2015-09-22,43976392,Jaclyn,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying at James' place. We stayed for 9 days and got a good feel for Ballard. This is an awesome location- super walkable to Ballard's downtown area, bus stops, and the Ballard Locks. Very convenient. Easy parking if you have a car, if not you can easily bus/walk/uber. James was great, very friendly, while also giving us our space and kept the apartment clean. We had the unit to ourselves for most of our stay and did share for a few days (it's a 2 bedroom- 1 bathroom). We had great roommates and sharing the place was easy. I would highly recommend booking a stay, you'll love it!"
8310398,48355187,2015-09-25,289238,Kelsie,"Perfect location for easy access to Old Town Ballard (with super-easy access to buses headed to downtown Seattle), great little place in a quiet neighborhood. James was a fantastic host and made sure we felt comfortable whilst giving us plenty of space and privacy to do our own thing. If you want to see Seattle and stay somewhere that is affordable but offers an authentic experience (awesome coffee shops, restaurants, boutiques), James's place in Ballard is perfect. Thanks again, James!"
8310398,48488894,2015-09-26,44971975,Jeff,"James has a great place within walking distance to Old Ballard restaurants, nightlife, and shopping. Very close to bus transit as well. I only had the pleasure of staying with James for one night, but he was flexible with my late arrival time and very welcoming. The room was very clean and as advertised - I would definitely recommend a stay here if you're looking for a home base to explore Seattle from. Thanks!"
8310398,48598577,2015-09-27,43950972,Alura,"James was awesome.  Met us at a convenient time, welcomed us and gave us a tour.  The house was great and the room was clean and comfortable. The location is quiet and safe, and only a few minutes walk away from lots of bars and restaurants, as well as the locks. Street/driveway parking was free and accessible. Transit to downtown Seattle was easy and only took around 45 minutes.  Staying here was a great decision.  Thanks, James!"
8310398,48856365,2015-09-28,44596180,Merridith,Bright cozy room. Nice condo in a nice area. 10 minute walk down to restaurants. James was very pleasant and accommodating. Great communication. Shared bathroom if other room is rented out.
8310398,49538386,2015-10-04,289238,Kelsie,This was our second time staying at James's place in Ballard (this time for three nights before flying home) and it was perfect again!
8310398,50033322,2015-10-08,6787024,Bianca,"Everything was just perfect! Quiet neighbourhood, really nice bars and restaurants 10 minutes away, bus connections to downtown, and a beautiful double room in a house that has two bed rooms in total. Thank you, James! "
8310398,50156742,2015-10-09,35035400,Joseph,"James accommodated my grandma with very little notice, very nice room and bed, clean, crisp, nice attention to detail, bathroom was clean and fresh, nice kitchen. Overall 10/10. Only sad part is we could only get it for one day."
8310398,50217491,2015-10-10,4549349,Erica,"     We highly recommend you stay at James's place when visiting the Ballard area. James's house is perfectly located short walking distance to the amazing restaurants & shops in the area. 
    The listing was exactly as described, very clean & quiet. All the amenities were perfect for our stay. The bed was super comfortable n cozy. James was there to greet us & suggest some great restaurants to try in the area (which we did). 
   Next time we come to the Seattle area, we will be looking up Jame's listing again. The Ballard area has so much to offer, I wish we were there for longer.

8310398,50597005,2015-10-12,5609990,Samuel,"James was waiting for us in person when we arrived and gave us a quick welcome and overview of the place, the neighborhood. The place is small, two-floor, two-bedroom 1-bath - basic but clean and comfortable and it was nice to have access to kitchen with fridge. Both bedrooms are for airbnb guests - we had company first night and alone the second night. We were in the Queen room and the bed was comfy. The best part is the location - right in Ballard close to the bike/running trail, locks, all the neighborhood spots. You can follow the trail about 1.5 miles to Golden Gardens Park which has a nice beach."

It is located close to train tracks. The trains start running early in the morning. Also, this is a rental for ONE of TWO bedrooms that are very close together and share a bathroom. The bedroom doors do not have seperate locks. None of this was a problem for me and the people I shared the house with were very pleasant. "
8310398,51877739,2015-10-24,703054,Heather-Nicole,"Easy, last minute rental in great location and clean, comfortable place. Plenty of parking on the street. We enjoyed being able to walk to several breweries but did take a bus back. Thanks for a great stay. "
8310398,53309745,2015-11-07,23354032,Emily,"James answered any questions we had quickly and seemed genuinely happy to answer them. James was a great host and took time to show us around the place before we settled in. He was welcoming and energetic! The place was clean, cute and comfy. We would definitely stay there again. The place was a quick walk to our favourite dessert place and other bars and social spots. "
8310398,53891305,2015-11-14,14063039,Kristin,"Nice comfortable bed and room was quiet.  One block away from Fish Locks and restaurants.  I was only in the room to sleep, but it suited my purposes."
8310398,53980745,2015-11-15,38565332,Janet,Really enjoy staying at James' b-n-b. It's comfortable and James is so conscientious. Terrific location and an easy trip from the airport. I'll be returning again.

Though we didn't interact much since my husband and I had a pretty busy schedule while in Seattle, we definitely felt welcome. "
7791010,43860677,2015-08-22,26591412,Casey,"We had a great time staying at Chad's place. He connected with me ahead of time to give me the code to get in the front door, which was good since we arrived late. He had left a personalized welcome and the bed was super comfortable. It was really nice having the downstairs to ourselves so we didn't feel like we were disrupting him. We ran into him the next day on our way out and let him know what a great stay we had. "
7791010,44233681,2015-08-24,26757892,Jason,Chad was an awesome host! My girlfriend and I came to Seattle for a Mariners game. Upon arrival Chad had a welcome notebook for us which we found to be a very nice touch. He was welcoming and very personable. The room was clean and even included water and snacks (which we enjoyed). The bathroom had all different types of toiletries (sundries) for us to use down to the little things like Q tips and different types of cologne. Chad helped us with local places to eat and venues to check out in the neighbourhood. I would strongly recommend Chad's place to anyone looking to stay in Seattle and look forward to staying at his place the next time we are in town. Thanks again Chad!
7791010,45451556,2015-09-02,38723528,Megan,"Chad and his listing were great!  He does everything he can to make sure that you feel comfortable from the start.  He's available if you need anything (thank you for letting us do laundry!), but he also respects your privacy and makes it as easy as possible for you to be independent.  He provide toiletries if you need, as well as complimentary snacks!  I would book this place again!  Clean, welcoming, private, great!"
7791010,46180006,2015-09-08,3026190,Alex,"Chad made us feel really welcomed.  The room was as described, and we really enjoyed our stay.  The area offers a lot of option for food, and amenities.  We missed Chad when we first arrived, but he was gracious enough to drop us off at our cruise departure.  This is a an affordable option for those seeking to visit Seattle."
7791010,47098592,2015-09-15,42896330,Katerina,Very friendly and pleasant stay with respected privacy. We loved how he is prepared for guests and everything is easy to follow. :)
7791010,47235118,2015-09-16,14323264,Peter,"Chad was prompt and efficient in his communication; the place is clean and cosy, conveniently located next to a downtown bus, plus a 24-hr store. Great value!"
7791010,47857861,2015-09-21,22580371,Brittany,"Chad was an amazing host! The location is extremely quiet/quaint with many shops/restaurants within walking distance. We were planning to take public transit to Alki Beach but Chad was kind enough to offer to drive us. The room is small but perfect for what we needed (a clean quiet space to sleep after a long day of traveling/exploration). When taking a hot shower, turn the fan on! I didn't think of that and set off the smoke detector (sorry)! Thanks for being a great host Chad :)!"
7791010,48484060,2015-09-26,6188181,Jenna,"Chad's place was perfectly comfortable and he made it easy for us to have a flexible (late evening) check/in! Lots of sundries and toiletries available, a warm welcome note, and even snacks and waters left in the room. I didn't get a chance to meet him in person, but had a wonderful experience staying in his home!"
7791010,48652434,2015-09-27,10338504,Julie,"Chad was very nice and accommodating. The room was clean and comfortable. There was parking right out front (not always the case in Seattle). Overall, we enjoyed our stay and would return:)"
7791010,49032007,2015-09-30,37986470,Ömer Han,Chad is a really nice host. We had a perfect stay at Seattle by staying at his home. The room and the bathroom was really clean. He helped us in every kind he can and we can highly recommend to stay at his place. 
7791010,49392844,2015-10-03,3077321,Phoebe,We arrived fairly late because my baby messed up the map. Chad still gave us a warmly welcome. The place is very close to Seatle downtown which saved us a lot of time to reach downtown. A spare cot set saved my life after two sleepless night with my baby in the same bed. All essentials are at high quality. Neighbourhood is quite and peaceful. Definitely will book again if next time visit Seattle.
7791010,49566942,2015-10-04,45472275,Seoho,"Chad made us so comfortable that he prepared all we needed and was flexible about check-in time. Thanks for letting us in at night! Place was clean and neat as described. Neighbor was safe and quiet, and it took only 20 minutes from downtown!
His cat is so lovely. "
7791010,50717066,2015-10-13,12739444,Richard,"Chad made us welcome and provided a clean, quiey, comfortable room and was very accommodating about our late arrival."
7791010,50810438,2015-10-14,10429632,C R,"Chad was very welcoming, and made sure we were familiar with getting in and out of the room.  Lots of things to do in this area, and a lot are within walking distance.  The room is not very large, but comfortable, and you have your own bath, although you need to step out of the room into the bathroom. Those are the only 2 rooms on that floor, so there is still a lot of privacy.  We were already meeting friends during our stay, but Chad can provide a wealth of information on the area."
7791010,51167423,2015-10-18,35137,Chelsea,"Chad was a great host.  We felt very welcomed and appreciated the snacks!  The neighborhood is great and we felt comfortable walking around at night.  Thanks again Chad, we would definitely book again!"
7791010,51578258,2015-10-21,46332844,Shannon,"Pleasant, very clean space, well stocked with amenities. Room is small but the bedroom/bathroom area is convenient and private. Neighborhood was not actually very loud, and the house is close to several stores good for grabbing food or last-minute items and public transportation to downtown. We only met Chad briefly but he was friendly and very communicative beforehand."
7791010,52852249,2015-11-02,15745466,Joseph,"Chads townhouse is warm, cozy, and inviting with two lovely cats that peek at you (but will generally leave you alone). Chad took time before work at 10:00 AM (while in his swat team Halloween costume) to greet and open the door for us. We really appreciated the water and snacks he left in the room, and would definitely consider returning!"
7791010,53037765,2015-11-03,43403768,Hsing,Nice clean place. Great host. Quiet neighborhood. Super easy and smooth check in and out. Will stay again if next time we're in Seattle.
7791010,54335634,2015-11-18,21095603,Jehnean,"Chad is the best host ever! He might ruin all future hosts for you. ;) 

From day one, he offered to pick us up when we arrived in town. He made great recommendations for things to see and do while in town. He even let us do some laundry! We've been traveling for a couple weeks so it was great to have clean clothes without having to walk to a laundromat! He left snacks and drinks and plenty us useful info on how to use items in our part of the house. 

The room is on a separate floor from the rest of the house so you'll feel like you have a nice little space of your own. The space was really clean. Chad also had two great little kitties that liked to peek from the stairs and get pets (if you want to be friendly with them.) 

Staying with Chad was a great experience and I highly recommend visiting with him! "
7791010,54965044,2015-11-25,29810241,Bryson,Very convenient location. Chad provided extra amenities and very warm cozy home. Recommended for anyone headed to Seattle.   
7791010,55597908,2015-12-02,18041134,Michael,Chad was an excellent host and was very friendly and gave good tips on what do around the city. His place was very cozy and comfortable and provide everything we needed. Excellent location close to the bus line that goes downtown. Check in and out was very smooth and easy. Highly recommended for those visiting Seattle!
7791010,56159135,2015-12-09,37340493,Jascha,Very nice room in a nice area of Seattle. Lots of great places in walkable distance. Chad had great recommendations for coffee and pastries which made our stay even more enjoyable. The cats were super cute and made us feel home. We would definetily stay there again!
7791010,56627581,2015-12-15,36315002,Justine,"Chad was an amazing host! Very helpful and informative the entire time. My sister and I were very well accommodated. The room was nice and cozy, convenient heater vent, and a comfy blanket-heavy bed great for this Seattle weather. We had our own bathroom and the first floor to ourselves. The spot is VERY CONVENIENT. We were really in a great spot. So close to the city and all the other landmarks we wanted to visit. The 24 hour QFC store was also a great plus. Parking was right in front of the house. Chad was even gracious enough to let us stay several hours after checkout because our flight was later in the day. Very sweet! Overall, such a wonderful experience. Made our first time trip to Seattle super memorable. Thank you so much Chad! "
7791010,56894564,2015-12-19,49481295,Joshua,Chad was an awesome host.  The room and the bathroom were tremendously clean and private. He did everything that he could to make us feel welcome and at home and we will definitely be coming back next time we're in Seattle. I really appreciate everything and he even allowed us to book an extra night on very short notice.  Thanks!
7791010,57109369,2015-12-21,4669248,Lucas,This was my second time staying at Chad's.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable place to stay at a reasonable price! 
7791010,57153330,2015-12-22,33407476,Connie,"Chad was great at communicating with me before my stay! 
Great private area on the first floor. Comfortable bed and private clean bathroom! 
Will definitely stay again. There is even a parking spot if you brought a car :)"
6823837,35736845,2015-06-21,10919715,Justin,"Everything was great. Accessing the apartment was perfect. We spent our full beautiful sunny day in downtown Seattle and didn't go to the home until about 11:30 pm. Getting there and parking was a cinch, and getting in was as easy as a four digit code. Definitely recommend this neat and well furnished spot. "
6823837,36593958,2015-06-29,35486115,Linda,"We stayed in the lower level of Patrick's fantastic home in West Seattle. The space was perfect for my family of 5. It was decorated beautifully, not overdone. The kitchen and bathroom had all the items stocked there that we would ever need. It was bright, airy, and so clean and new feeling. We loved the quiet neighborhood, and had access to all parts of Seattle easily. We met Patrick's assistant, Winda, who was extremely nice and so helpful. We want to stay here whenever we visit our daughter who will soon be living in Seattle. What a fabulous place!"
6823837,37496396,2015-07-07,16813827,Angela,"This place was perfect for the 4 of us. Parking was good with no trouble and such a close commute to Seattle and surrounding areas. When we arrived we were given a brand new coffee maker and patio table and chairs, which was perfect as we spent a lot of time in the backyard enjoying the beautiful weather. The neighbors are friendly and it is very comfortable. I love how it is decorated and we all felt very much at home. We had the best time and loved every minute of it.  Lovely neighborhood with grocery shopping close by. 
Thank you for being a great host and for letting us visit. We look forward to coming back.  "
6823837,39186328,2015-07-21,14058905,Chris,"The neighborhood was quiet, but it was difficult to park on the street so we used the alley parking. For renters of the basement, you can hear the footsteps of the upstairs renters, if that bothers you. If there are young children above, it's worse."
6823837,40930203,2015-08-03,15103967,Jackson,"My friends and I (a group of five) stayed at Patrick's cottage and enjoyed it immensely.

The cottage is in West Seattle, a convenient and beautiful neighbourhood with great stores and beaches. There is a Thai restaurant literally steps away that serves great, affordable food.

Seattle was extremely hot this summer and I must say the cottage managed to stay cool throughout the day. We stayed in the downstairs half so the sun couldn't get in. The cottage also had fans and mosquito nets which I really appreciated because I can't stand the heat or mosquitoes.

Everything inside looked new and clean. Everything was comfortable. There was a TV with Netflix as well which was great. Everything we needed (supplies, kitchen tools, etc.) was available.

Patrick was responsive and flexible. We would definitely stay here again."
6823837,41960334,2015-08-10,12337979,Fabienne,"Patrick's cottage was a breeze to check into, nestled in a really quaint neighborhood, close to freeway access.  The cottage had modern decor and adequate space for our 5 guests.  The welcome letter provided via email prior to our stay gave really easy instructions on the  fold out couch, internet and netflix access.  The shared back yard was very quiet, leaving us to wind down in the evenings.  Overall we had a great trip to Seattle! "
6823837,44304887,2015-08-25,3711361,Andrea,"Fun and bright cottage/apartment in West Seattle. Lots of room for our whole group, great kitchen facilities, easy to park outside, and easy transit access to downtown and to the Alki beach area. Only downside was it got a bit ""AirBnb 2.0"", by which I mean never seeing your host, only communicating with a 3rd party and then having a cleaning service come over (hours before check out time), kind of like a hotel. I usually prefer places with a bit more of a personal touch. However, we really did have a great time, so I totally recommend Patrick's place!"
6823837,45469468,2015-09-03,34867502,Robert,"Pictures do the place perfect justice. Well maintained, plenty of beds, nice little back yard area to relax in. Area seemed fine with a Starbucks within walking distance, and some great BBQ around the corner. Biggest plus for our stay was being ~5 minutes from a rapid transit bus. Able to get downtown in about 20 minutes was fantastic."
6823837,46277868,2015-09-09,11338465,Cheri,"We loved Seattle! Thanks to Patrick for letting us stay here. The neighborhood was safe, clean, and somewhere I would enjoy living. Since the apartment was on the lower level, we sometimes heard the upstairs neighbors walking in what seemed to be shoes made of bowling balls. But that is to be expected and certainly not his fault. At times it smelled a little musty, but was not too off-putting. The location is near great local eateries (try the Thai place. Yum.) and bus stop that was helped us jump right into the action without much difficulty. We used Uber when returning home late at night because it was faster after long days of sightseeing. West Seattle provides a free shuttle that took us around that beautiful part of the city, including Alki beach. It was a picture postcard beautiful day on the beach. I would definitely go to Seattle again, as well as stay at this location again."
6823837,46522606,2015-09-11,19478552,Dawen/Ami,This place was perfect for us - one couple and two friends (male and female) - having two bedroom and one big sofa bed in the living room. The apartment was so clean and well-decorated. It was only 15-20 mins from downtown and street parking was easy to find! The management was very helpful when we called as well. We would recommend this place to anyone!
6823837,47969964,2015-09-22,6883785,Brenna,"We had a great stay in Patrick's 2 bedroom apartment!  It was exactly as pictured/described and the place was very clean upon our arrival.  Check-in and check-out were both super easy as well.  The location was perfect for us--downtown is super accessible via car and (if you don't mind hills) West Seattle's own commercial district (""the Junction"") is a pretty easy walk.  Trader Joe's is also right there.  It is a basement apartment, so if you need lots of light or don't like hearing people above you (we heard them only a bit), it might not be for you.  Overall, though, we enjoyed our stay and would definitely come back here again!"
6823837,48718683,2015-09-28,41006065,Rachel,First Air bnb experience and very impressed with this place. Fit 5 comfortably. Very clean and in a great location to see Seattle. Local bars are walking distance and we had a great time. 
6823837,49881538,2015-10-07,38003988,Ken,"This was a great place to stay and fairly close to town. I wouldn't call it walking distance but it was a very short drive. 

We never met Patrick but had to call his assistant as the WIFI wasn't working and she had it fixed immediately!

There was everything we needed in the house. We picked up some groceries and it was great. 

I would definitely stay there again. Thanks very much! "
6823837,50484732,2015-10-12,1158592,Cindy,"Convenient West Seattle location, easy to find and walking distance to restaurants, coffee, and Trader Joe's.  Also, quick and easy access to downtown Seattle and all it has to offer.Communication with Patrick was very easy, as was the check-in/check out process.  It was a small space for four adults, but the beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet.  "
8866960,52174135,2015-10-26,2748381,Anne-Sophie,"Kelsey was a really thoughtful host, leaving nice little details such as delicious snacks and a cute welcome note to her private room. This is a great location with free parking 24/7 (bonus!) that's close to downtown and easily accessible. Her house mates were also thoughtful and nice. There's a comfy single bed, a cozy private shower/bathroom -- worked great for my solo weekend work trip to Seattle! Kelsey is also very responsive and easy to communicate with."
8866960,57109730,2015-12-21,24680159,Zoey,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
8866960,57155869,2015-12-22,16643806,Rachel,"Great place for young folks to enjoy a stay in Seattle. Close enough to get to the main hub of the city, yet not too close, so you have some breathing room away from the business of the city."
6865200,46413898,2015-09-10,24634970,Adrianne,"Aaron was very through in providing information about his apartment well in advance of our arrival. He checked in with us a couple days before to welcome us to Seattle and make sure everything was good to go. During our stay he responded to questions in a timely manner. 
The apartment was clean and was located in the super cute and hot Capitol Hill area. Great restaurants and drinks were only a couple blocks away. 
The one gripe is that the floors are creaky and we could hear the neighbors walking around and even hear their cell phone vibrating. If I brought ear plugs I would of slept a little better. "
6865200,46909242,2015-09-14,40534493,Christopher,"My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying at Aaron's place in Seattle.  First off, his place is in an excellent location.  It is close to downtown, and the neighborhood offers many great restaurants and places to go out.  We did not need to use a car during our weekend visit, and everything we wanted to see was easy to get to.  We ended up renting bikes to use for the weeking (company= peddle anywhere) and that worked out extremely well.  Aaron's place has character and he keeps it relatively clean.  It was a very comfortable home base.  We had plenty of space for all of our stuff, and he had everything laid out for us, and we were welcome to use any household items if we wished- it truly was like visiting a friend in the city.  He provided information and suggestions about the city, fresh towels and linens, washer detergent and dryer sheets... all the details which make staying somewhere enjoyable.  His directions for arrival, stay and departure were clear and easy to follow.  He was easy to contact (I spoke with before visitng and during my stay).  When considering location, price and the integrity/vibe of the host, I would say that I was more than satsified with my stay in Seattle and would definitely recommend staying here."
6865200,47704481,2015-09-21,40542938,Jonathan,"Aaron's place was very neatly out together and in a convenient location in Cap Hill. Checking in and out were both very easy with the directions provided. While Aaron's place was organized and everything was put away it was still not the cleanest place, particularly the bathroom. Hopefully this will be given extra attention the next time it's used for Airbnb!"
6865200,47988583,2015-09-22,40834096,Laura,"It was a nice apartment in a great area of Seattle. Very walkable neighborhood. Host was very fast at responding, and was friendly. Apartment was tidy but could have been a bit cleaner. Overall, I would stay again. Good value. "
6865200,48198415,2015-09-24,36046120,Michelle,"I could not stay here. The building (which is an enclosed apartment building) reeks of mildew/mold and other cat-like odors. This is most likely due to the heavily (can't emphasize enough) stained carpet in all of the hallways and stairwells. It hit me like a ton of bricks when I walked in. I gave it the benefit of the doubt and went up to the apartment but the smell was still too strong. I am allergic to mold/mildew and it was making very difficult to breathe. I understand that this is not the host's fault, necessarily, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that the building was pretty dank (not just ""old""). However, even if I had stayed and not had to pay $250 /night to stay in a hotel instead, I still would not have been very comfortable staying here. While it was tidy, it was not very clean. The bathtub had smudges that I was not prepared to risk bathing in and there was a noticeable amount of hair on the bathroom sink. I didn't spend more than five minutes in the home so I can't give more details than that. I have not been offered a refund either. "
692671,2414003,2012-09-25,3568404,Maria,"Husband and I were traveling for a wedding. We wanted more then the typical Hotel experience. We were thrilled to find the Airnb site and to connect with our host, Susan. It was a comfortable home with all the comforts you could need for a 6 days stay in Seattle. The home comes with 2 cats that we were absolutely fine with feeding or playing with, when they were present. they stay out doors almost all the time. Best part of the home- the veiw and the absolute sun light that poors in :)) Gorgeous. If we had to say there was a worst part... I guess it would be the lack of some curtains to allow for privacy and to block veiws from to of neighbors. Host was very helpful and available for questions. We even extended our stay which was accommodated and very much appreciated. We would love to book with Airnb and this host again."
692671,2625464,2012-10-15,3823425,Jane,This was the perfect place to spend a quiet weekend in Seattle. The apartment was charming  and spacious wuth everything I needed. Ballard was a fun neighborhood to explore with plenty of shops and places to eat. I highly recommend staying at Susan's apartment.
692671,2782661,2012-11-01,3991644,Katherine,"This is a very warm and cozy 2nd floor apartment with lots of windows, light and a good view.  I would stay here again."
692671,3078052,2012-12-12,4158497,Sam,"If you like old craftsman style architecture with beautiful yellow-orange natural douglas-fir floors and brass fixtures on faucets and good views and a super quiet city street and a cool hip neighborhood nearby....well, look no further.  We loved staying in the Ballard apartment of Susan's.  And we loved Ballard....try not to miss the market on Sunday.  We went to one restaurant twice...the ""Walrus and the Carpenter"".  If you like oysters, it's amazing...AMAZING.  

The apartment was very clean.  It's up a flight of stairs, so keep that in mind."
692671,3475201,2013-02-04,2394693,Kris,"Susan is an excellent host and communicator, the apartment was super clean, inviting and relaxing, filled with good energy. Susan was flexible with our arrival time. I hope to stay here again."
692671,3574552,2013-02-18,4997392,Calvin,"Great Location and a amazing view. We stayed two nights and had so much more to explore within walking distance.   Its close to Zoo, theatre, and great food/drinks.    Susan is helpful and very easy to get in contact with.  I would recommend this apartment to anyone who wants to have a memorable time."
692671,4009586,2013-04-02,5490812,P.,We had a pleasant stay in the Sun Drenched Ballard Apartment and we were fortunate to have a sunny Easter weekend in Seattle.  It was within walking distance from family and it provided what we were looking for in a guest house.
692671,4202343,2013-04-18,4900084,Janet,"We had a wonderful relaxing stay at Susan's attic apartment with the view.  Bed was comfortable, bathroom was roomy, and kitchen was great for cooking.  Everything about the apartment was as promised.  And we loved being able to walk wherever we wanted to go in Ballard."
692671,4493831,2013-05-08,5777211,Lori,Great apartment with a beautiful view. Home very clean and organized. Susan was a wonderful host. Only got to say hi to the cats. Had baked goods and fresh flowers as a welcome!. Home is very centrally located and easy to find and in a desirable neighborhood. Would definitely stay here again.  
692671,5056952,2013-06-10,1007722,Kaveh,"We really enjoyed staying at Susan's place. The location is convenient for scooting around in the city by car, and the apartment itself is gorgeous: homey, cozy, and inviting. Susan was an excellent, generous host. We would definitely stay in this apartment again."
692671,5636388,2013-07-09,5944131,Kelsey,"Susan's apartment is beautiful, clean, and comfortable. There is a beautiful view from whichever window you're looking out of. It's on a nice, quiet, residential street. My boyfriend and I were doing Seattle by foot and by bus, and it was definitely a bit of a trek to get to grocery stores, commercial areas, and a couple of the bus stops, but if you have a car, it'd be a really perfect location. Thus, if I were doing Seattle by car, I certainly would stay again at Susan's place. If I were attempting to get around by foot and bus again, I might pay the extra money to stay somewhere a little closer to areas of interest."
692671,5841374,2013-07-19,5709602,Peggy,Great sunny place! Love the view of the Olympic mountains. The flat felt very homey and everything needed was there. Susan was quick to respond to questions and very welcoming. Was quiet and not far from the bus stop. Parked on the street without a problem. Knew the cats lived there but only saw them outside. Very much enjoyed our stay!
692671,6309863,2013-08-07,12399,Andrew,"Great place in a neighborhood that is both easily accessible by public transportation (we were without a car), yet also far away from the tourists to get a feel for what might constitute the ""real"" Seattle. As others have noted, the views of the mountains and sunset are spectacular. Great overall experience."
692671,7066994,2013-09-05,6222912,Lauren,"Susan's apartment was very clean and located in a terrific area. Plan to do a lot of walking if you are without a car, however it is close to many bus stops and if you are willing to walk a mile, it is within range of many restaurants, bars and shops. Great location to see more to Seattle than the typical tourist spots!"
692671,7703196,2013-09-30,8364728,Kelly,"Susan's place is beautiful and clean and her design for this space is sophisticated and whimsical, it's like walking into an Apartment Therapy tour. We had a car but did not need it to visit all the great breweries and restaurants in the Ballard/Fremont area. Street parking is easy and you probably won't see her cats. I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
692671,8234745,2013-10-21,8879425,Sandy,"Susan's place was beautiful, clean and perfectly located.  Will will definitely stay here next time we are in Seattle."
692671,8368920,2013-10-28,8589086,Jane,We had a perfect stay! The apartment was clean and so (website hidden) really fussy about places being quiet and this was perfectly peaceful. Excellent value for money and location. Thank you Susan! 
692671,10263098,2014-02-10,10636987,Nancy,"If you are a fan of early 1900's architecture, you will love this apartment!  This is the top floor of an old home with wood floors and large, wood-frame windows.  The west-facing windows offer beautiful view of the Olympics.  The bathroom has the original claw foot tub and charming old sink.  Kitchen is well organized for cooking.  We found the bed very comfortable and really appreciated how quiet the place was.  This charming apartment has a lot of character, and we really enjoyed our stay!

692671,10696648,2014-03-03,11830887,Lea,"Very nice place-- just as cozy and comfortable as it appears in the photos. On a clear day, the living room has views of the snow-capped Olympic Mountains! Susan was very friendly and helpful with giving us ideas of things to do around Ballard."
692671,11356849,2014-03-31,12459657,Philip & Lavonne,"Everything was as advertised, from the sun (when it was out) to the shy cat."
692671,13092226,2014-05-19,12487517,Kathryn,"Had a nice 1- night stay.  Susan thoughtfully bought us yummy pastries for the morning.  Quiet location in a desirable location.  Bed was quite comfortable.  Cats were shy, and (with treats) played a bit.  "
692671,13219084,2014-05-22,14724598,Sharon,"We were very comfortable and felt like being home.  Susan was very accomodating and the apartment was large, bright and cheery.  Many windows and views.  Also enjoyed some of the books available for browsing.  Had an evening card game with friends using the abundant furnishings provided.  Definitely would stay here again."
692671,13751851,2014-06-03,5593203,Christine,"We really enjoyed our stay at Susan's place for 3 nights at the end of May.  It is certainly sun-drenched, very comfortable, and clean. Great views over the city towards the mountains.  The cats were around in the yard, but didn't visit the apartment while we were there.  We have stayed in Ballard before and find that it is a fun neighbourhood to explore (the Sunday market is not to be missed!), and very accessible to downtown too.  We will definitely stay here again!"
692671,13858973,2014-06-06,15743136,Darren,"Susan’s place was beautiful, clean, and private. The natural lighting was pleasant with amazing views from all windows. The area was quiet with easy access to lots of things (including Slate coffee bar, just a couple blocks away). We caught a few rare glimpses of the cats outside but never had the pleasure of meeting them in the apartment. We had a fantastic time here, and we’d most definitely come back. "
692671,13987221,2014-06-09,6281806,Carolyn,"Susan's place was perfect, and yes, it was sun drenched. My mother and I enjoyed her apartment and was not only a great base to explore Seattle but also spend the morning sipping coffee and eating a tasty croissant. I would definitely look to stay again on another trip to Seattle. Thanks Susan!"
692671,14293580,2014-06-16,15575505,Kiela,"We loved our stay at Susan's apartment. It was spacious, full of natural light, comfortable, and located in a great part of town. We felt right at home there and had a much more pleasant stay than we ever could have at a hotel. The cats said hello but kept to themselves the majority of the time. Overall, a great experience. Thanks!"
692671,14693140,2014-06-24,1610115,Helen,Loved this space! It is a charming old house in a lovely neighborhood - we absolutely loved it! Great value too. Susan left us fresh pastries from a local bakery & let us drink her coffee. I absolutely recommend her & this place! 
692671,14821161,2014-06-27,15226679,Jan,"I stayed 3 nights at Susan's place. It was perfect, cozy, clean, conveniently located for me and absolutely comfortable and enjoyable. Susan is great and communication was a+++. All I can say I will never book a hotel in Seattle again if I can rent this place instead."
692671,16247334,2014-07-24,15028173,Sally,Susan was most welcoming & graciously ran out to get fresh pastries our first morning! We had a nice chat when we arrived. The apartment was charming.  We loved the view to the Olympics and Ballard.  We only saw the kitty once--she is a bit shy and stayed outside with her friends.
692671,16898645,2014-08-04,16396983,Heather,"The apartment was gorgeous and so clean. Susan left pastries for us when we arrived. She was extremely flexible and accommodating of our schedule, and was always available by phone.  Any issues were addressed extremely quickly.  We would come back home for the day and the garbage would be gone and necessities refilled. It was excellent. 

I would use this apartment again on a return trip to Seattle and recommend to anyone.  Thanks Susan!"
692671,17674439,2014-08-16,5587157,Lillian,We enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  It is a great area and close to Ballard. The view was wonderful. The apartment was clean and we loved the artwork. Thank you for the sweet rolls during our stay. The bed was very comfortable. Everything was as described on line. 
692671,18408409,2014-08-26,17052225,Sarah,"The apartment was clean, well maintained, and a home away from home. Upstairs of an older home-awesome claw foot tub, creaky floors, and character abound. Very cute! Susan was just lovely and very accommodating. An artesian pastry/French press coffee for  my first breakfast morning - Yum! There was even some trouble with a running toilet, which she attended to very quickly. She does come by the house daily (?) to feed the cats and such, but our paths did not cross and I did not feel awkward leaving my things about.  House is sort of between Ballard and Fremont and I was able to access both areas easily. The house is up off the road, driveway is steep and there are steps to reach the porch and steps to reach the apartment. The house is at the base of a very steep hill but I was able to get around using the bus stop at the base of the hill ( rte 28 : 2-3 blocks away) instead of heading up. My knees may not be happy with me saying so, but I would stay at Susan's again when visiting Seattle. A fantastic stay!!! "
692671,18794691,2014-09-01,10665220,Alison,"The apartment was great! It was clean, comfortable and it had great décor that made it very memorable for our visit to Seattle.

Susan provided us with a delicious danish on our first morning and she was very pleasant and helpful with all of the instructions and information that we needed. We would certainly recommend staying in this apartment."
692671,19289328,2014-09-09,12696654,Ana,"We really enjoyed our stay at Susan's place.  Very cozy and comfortable.  Lovely light, big windows with views.  Clean, well-decorated and very user-friendly.  An easy 15 minute walk to ""downtown"" Ballard, and a 25 minute walk to central Fremont.  Susan met us when we got there and was very attentive and responsive throughout our stay.  I would highly recommend it for anyone looking to stay in the Ballard area."
692671,19593288,2014-09-15,16970164,Patrick,Location and place were great.  Would definitely stay again if I'm back in town.
692671,20103522,2014-09-23,20581885,Kelli,"This was my first experience with airbnb and I have to say, I am now a fan!  Susan, thank you so much for making this such a great trip.  Susan was friendly and responsive to my texts or calls if I needed anything. Her home was beautiful and the location was fabulous!"
692671,20427368,2014-09-29,20080042,Loretta,Susan and her place were great!  Susan went above and beyond to make sure everything went smoothly on our trip and we were happy.  The apartment was amazing... even better than the pictures portray.  The whole experience made our trip to Seattle great.   Would highly recommend
692671,22658884,2014-11-11,17651927,David,Susan contacted us ahead of time with suggestions about activities and to make sure we were all set with picking up the key. The apartment was as advertised and perfect for our needs. We appreciated the baked goods and would return if we visit Seattle again.
692671,26709486,2015-02-17,19001485,Robert,Good experience here.  
692671,27026820,2015-02-23,7399864,Jill,"Thank you Susan! The apartment was lovely. And sun drenched indeed! 
Thank you for the wonderful hospitality. I will definitely try to stay again when I'm back in Seattle."
692671,27358714,2015-03-02,8874105,Kevin,"A great place for a stay in Seattle and truly sun drenched, Susan was a great host. Her place was above us and she checked in on us to make sure everything was okay and gave us plenty of privacy. A lovely slice of cake, all the tea you could want, and a warm comfortable place In a quiet part of town.  We found it easier to cab, uber everywhere which was fine to us. Average about 10-13 bucks downtown. Would definitely recommend this for anybody looking to stay in Seattle that is not a crazy late night partier. 

"
692671,27666672,2015-03-09,22686119,Ron & Dawn,"We live 30 miles south of Seattle, but because we had a weekend conference to attend, decided not to make a long traffic filled commute home each morning and eve so instead stay close to where the conference was being held.
This is what brought us to Diana charming Ballard home. 
And that it was. 
It had all the Character we love about Ballard and is close to everything we possibly wanted, good restaurants, a large grocery store and the quirky wonderfulness that truly makes Freemont the center of the universe. 

Susan was a lovely host and so accomidating to our every need. 
The bed was incredibly comfortable and we got a very good night sleep as a result of it. 

Our stay say a pleasure!"
692671,32572370,2015-05-19,2809519,Maria,"My sister and i stayed at Susan's for one night and we absolutely loved it. She was very easy to get in touch with and answered all questions. The pictures don't do justiois on how beautiful her home and Surrounding area of her home is. It's full of character, charm and peraonality. The bed is so comfortable i wish i had one of those at home :) you can easily walk to Fermont neighborhood where there are lots of places to eat and drink and a few tourist attractions! If tou travrlling on the weekend you must attend the fermont sunday farmera market! "
692671,33275023,2015-05-26,10386523,Emily,"Bright, airy, and full of character. This charming apartment sits on a steep hillside nestled in between the trendy neighborhoods of Ballard and Fremont. It is a bit of a hike to either ""main drag"" from the apartment - but pleasant when you're in the mood for a long, hilly walk. Very cute brewery just down the street, too. We had a lovely experience and thoroughly enjoyed the little treats left by our host (not to mention the Netflix!).

Note the cat presence is pretty palpable - if you're not a feline-enthusiast, be aware."
692671,35199017,2015-06-16,23418053,Jamie,"This was my first time to Seattle and my stay at Susan's made it absolutely excellent! The apartment was exactly as described - sun drenched and charming! Very close to great restaurants and bars in both Ballard and Fremont. Susan was super accommodating with our arrival and departure times and also provided some excellent zucchini bread :) Thanks for an amazing stay in your home, Susan! "
692671,35830677,2015-06-22,34245615,Matt,"Had a great stay, in a great location. Susan's place is very cute, and the banana bread she left for us was great!"
692671,41951166,2015-08-10,11054462,Matthew,"Great home, great host! Thanks so much!"
692671,47075000,2015-09-15,31984169,Kourtnee,We really enjoyed the apartment and it was in a great part of town.  Very peaceful and great view of the Olympics from the large windows.  Would stay here again!
692671,48168913,2015-09-24,5232258,Steph & Will,"Susan made us feel very welcome.  It was lovely to arrive to a well-stocked fridge with tea, coffee, milk and a homemade cake.  She was very helpful whilst we were there, showing us how to use the washing machine and generally being on hand (while still letting us have the space to enjoy our holiday!).

The flat was just as described, with a great view (out to the mountains on a clear day), incredible light at sunset, and the opportunity occasionally to pet the cat."
692671,49675306,2015-10-05,14975172,Kelly,"Susan was the absolute best host! Her place will for sure give you that home away from home feeling. The apartment was clean, cozy, beautifully decorated, in a wonderful location and came fully equipped with board games, wifi, free parking, an activities binder for the city and best of all, friendly cats! 

Communication was also wonderful. Susan made sure we made it in safely and always checked in to make sure our needs were being met, even while she was out of town.  

With a friendly host and a beautiful apartment, I would stay here again in a heart beat and would certainly recommend it to others. Thank you Susan for opening up your home to us!"
8517235,54751128,2015-11-23,18600113,Liz,"Kevin's apartment is located in a very convenient area for walking around downtown! Just a few blocks to Pike Place, Link Transit, and tons of shopping, restaurants and bars all around. The apartment was very clean, and he even had a bottle of wine set out for us to enjoy!  I'd definitely recommend staying in this apartment, especially if you will be walking around town. "
9201292,53314151,2015-11-07,16594344,Nedah,This was a second booking after the host from my first was MIA.  This is a corporate housing company which ended up being kind of interesting but they were hugely helpful given the situation I was dealing with.  More than I would have wanted to spend but the time crunch left me little option as I was booking for a place to check into immediately. 
9201292,53565003,2015-11-09,20540970,Nona,"The apartment was beautiful. It has a great location being right between Pike and Pine. There are 100s of restaurants and shops within walking distance. The apartment actually felt more like a cozy hotel than staying in someone's apartment. If you aren't planning on travelling too far, I'd recommend not having a car as parking was extremely difficult since it is a very popular area. It's only 2 blocks from the light rail that comes directly from the airport and lots of bus routes."
803902,5200976,2013-06-17,6445312,Lynn (Picture Is Daughter),"This is a delightful stay.  The townhouse itself is charming and airy.  The location is close to downtown but with a wonderful beach vibe.  I recommend enthusiastically
Wonderful choice


"
803902,6306711,2013-08-07,7111204,Janae,"We stayed at Sue, Joe and Brody's lovely house and it was a wonderful experience.  The home fit our needs perfectly since we were traveling with my two year old son and our friends and their two slightly older boys.  It was extremely baby/kid friendly which was important for us.  The house was clean and well-maintained.  The neighborhood was cute and quaint and the house was only blocks from the beach.  Sue was very prompt about getting back to me which I appreciated.  Overall this was a wonderful house and we're glad we found it.  I would recommend this for anyone looking for a place to stay in Seattle!"
803902,6458568,2013-08-13,6664250,Canny,"Dear Sue, Thank you for being such a wonderful host. You were very honest, warm and responsive to our enquiries and your written instructions were clear and helpful. When we entered your house, the first impression we had were the coziness, comfort and warmth. We felt at home right away. Everything looks new, clean and lovingly kept. The ground floor bedroom and sheets were nice & clean. We moved up the stairs and the carpet felt nice, thick and warm under our feet. As we came to the second floor, we were blown away by the beautiful sights we saw. To our left was the kitchen. It was simply beautiful. We can see the counter, the oven, the stove, the fridge and utensils were all carefully & lovingly selected and they were not cheap and of good qualities. We saw the spices and herbs in the cabinets and these just told us of the pride and joy you had in preparing meals for your family. To our right was the dining room. The table was long and perfect for a family of 6 or just simply to entertain friends. We spent most of our evening sitting around the dining table, chatting and enjoying our quality family time. Moving further in, the living room was lovely and cosy with a sofa and TV. As we moved to the third floor, we saw two bedrooms. As was the case with the ground floor bedroom, they were nice and comfortable with clean sheets. The bonus was the baby cot, the safety gate on the stairs and the safety latch on the drawers. They were perfect for family with little ones and in our case, my two year old niece. The bathroom was neat and clean with extra towels provided. It was great that we were able to use the washer and dryer. Outside of the house, the garden was lovely with wooden deck chairs that were just inviting us to sit down and enjoy the summer sun, which I happily did. Your location was fantastic as well with Alki Beach a block away with all the restaurants, cafés and of course the beach. You asked us what areas we thought needed improvement. The only slight improvements we would like to suggest were the house number at your gate and a front pouch light with sensor. The gate did not state your house number. Instead, it stated your neighbor’s. It was confusing and we were in real fear of trying to enter the wrong house and getting shot in the process. This was compounded by the fact that our flights arrived late in the evening and it was dark and quiet by the time we reached your house. The front pouch light with sensor will help in opening the front doors. We had to use our handphone light to see where to open the door as it was really dark. Overall, your house conveyed a sense of peace, warmth and tranquility. I couldn’t think..."
803902,17341980,2014-08-11,15387194,Christopher,"The townhouse is a sweet and tidy home just over a block from Alki beach.  The neighborhood is full of kids and very friendly local residents.  The kitchen is highly functional, and the entire home was neat and clean and very well organized.  We were there three nights over a long weekend and it suited us perfectly.  "
803902,18000267,2014-08-20,6537181,Annie,"We had a wonderful stay in Sue and family's lovely home. The house is set up perfectly for those traveling with young kids! We enjoyed exploring the neighborhood and loved the relaxed beach vibe. It was easy getting into the city center area, and nice to come home to the quiet neighborhood at the end of a long day sightseeing."
803902,24570121,2014-12-30,23920602,Matt,"Great House! Less than a two-block walk to the beach and restaurants.  Kitchen is fully equipped.   Would recommend to friends staying in the area.

We had a booking fall through day-of on Christmas Eve and Sue was able to get the place ready for us very quickly!  She's very responsive."
803902,44292755,2015-08-25,35019794,Robert,"The house was great! It was extremely kid friendly, clean and quiet. The crib was set-up and clean and our daughter Loved all of the books and toys there were to play with. We even used the beach cruisers and took her on her very first bike ride! We had a great time and would highly recommend this house; we'll probably make this a regular house as we travel to Seattle often."
7454026,39872820,2015-07-26,1691818,Kevin,"The penthouse is really amazing. Susan and Joseph were very available to answer questions and field requests, and they were quick to offer alternatives and work with me when a booking roadblock presented itself. The rooftop offers the best views I've ever seen in Seattle. I hosted a dinner party in this space and I couldn't think of a better location. I would very highly recommend this penthouse to anybody looking for a place to host a small party or otherwise enjoy a fantastic night away."
7454026,40173502,2015-07-28,4692935,Polina,"Our group of friends with 2 toddlers stayed at the Penthouse at the end of July. Joseph and Susan were absolutely amazing hosts. They greeted us with thorough instructions, a tour around the penthouse and a bottle of wine. They were friendly and accommodating. Our communicating was easy and very prompt. The Penthouse is beautiful and spacious and the views from the rooftop deck are to die for. Overall, I would highly recommend to stay here!"
7454026,40677306,2015-08-01,37438851,Sumant,"I have only two words for this place: AWESOME, AMAZING. My family and I stayed there late July and were awestruck by the views and the spaciousness of the penthouse. Joseph and Susan went out of their way to keep us informed before our visit and made us feel welcome when we got there. I don't believe there is  a better location in all of Seattle which has both water views and downtown views at the same time. The floor to ceiling windows will give you an unobstructed view of downtown Seattle. We will be staying here every time we visit Seattle going forward."
7454026,41012366,2015-08-03,33057712,Roman,"Even more amazing than the pictures give it credit for. The towering windows and the spacious great room make it a must for anyone wanting to take in views of the city both day and night. A great romantic getaway.

The highlight was sitting out on the roof top deck on this summer night sharing a bottle of wine and staying up until the early hours of the morning under blankets enjoying the crisp night air and watching the boats cross the Puget Sound under moonlight.

One of the days we hopped on the water taxi and within 15 minutes were in downtown Seattle.

The hosts were wonderful. They brought my girlfriend's favorite flowers freshly cut from the market. The private parking is a great bonus too.

Everything went extremely well. We would stay again without hesitation and have already recommended it to a few friends. This place is a gem even for locals."
7454026,43309159,2015-08-18,40810993,Rick,This property is very nice and the location is great! Hope to rent again soon
7454026,44348250,2015-08-25,12681714,Alan,"The views are spectacular, of course. The premises are spotlessly clean and neat. It is a perfect location. And the hosts are kind, honest and real. What more could one ask?"
7454026,45212851,2015-08-31,42621260,Jim,"Great location, great view and awesome rooftop deck. With bike rentals and the water taxi right across the street we never even took the car out of the garage. Found a coffee shop right down the street, which is a must for us. We would stay here again. The only gotcha on this one is that for those folks with kids that worry about security there is not a lock on the elevator so folks that have access to the building can access the Penthouse. I know Joseph is working on this so should not be a long term problem."
7221204,40009696,2015-07-27,9383592,Emma,"Jackie, Hoa and the boys were very inviting and made us feel immediately welcome! The room is beautiful and has everything you need for your stay (and more!) A delicious breakfast is provided- pastries from 'larsons' were amazing!Jackie gave us access to their private beach which you can walk along when the tide is out- lovely! Ballard is a 5 minute drive and has loads of cool places to eat and drink! Jackie and Hoa were very helpful and gave us lifts into Seattle on both days-I would definitely recommend having a car to get around, or using 'uber' which works out cheap! A great stay!"
7221204,40802888,2015-08-02,8648979,Sharon,"Jackie was very enthusiastic and went out of her way to ensure I had the best possible experience. She gave me a key so I could use the beach, gave me a fan since it was in the 90's during the day, poured me a glass of wine the night I arrived, then let me do a load of laundry. She was also just a very likeable person. "
7221204,44252250,2015-08-24,17412708,Carissa,"Jackie and Hoa's little retreat on the water was just what we needed. The bed was cozy, Jackie had the fridge stocked when we arrived late Friday night with water, beer, yogurt, granola, fresh raspberries, almond milk, etc.! It was such a warm welcome. 

Great location, soon close to Ballard for restaurants, shopping, walking along the beach. On Sunday, we opened up the french doors and read in bed til early afternoon and it was so peaceful. Jackie brought us pastries from a local french bakery down the way and they were such a treat. On Saturday night, we wanted to have a fire so Hoa set us up with the campfire and chairs, wine glasses - even offered to pour us some wine. Their two boys are the absolute cutest. 

We really enjoyed our time here and when we wanted to chat, Jackie and Hoa where totally there to accommodate but for the most part we just did our own thing. Really lovely host, would definitely stay again."
7221204,45580215,2015-09-04,20836410,Doreen,"Our stay at Jackie's was by far the best compared to other hotels we stayed in the area. Jackie was a great host by being attentive, asking if we needed anything, so that our stay would be comfortable, and she was easily available if we did. The room was beautiful, clean, and comfortable. The entire ambiance (indoor & outdoor) was peaceful & tranquil. We unexpectedly received so much for so little. Our refrigerator was stocked with water & other treats, and on one morning Jackie surprised us with a delicious breakfast from the bakery &  fresh fruits. Yum! It was a welcoming stay & we will definitely stay there again on our future visit to Seattle."
7221204,46193919,2015-09-08,20483954,Aaron,"This was my first Airbnb and it was just spectacular. Hao and Jackie are excellent hosts, the beach view is wonderful, and the room is cozy and personable. Very accessible to Ballard (a superb spot for food and drinks). Easy to make it downtown. Overall a 10/10 experience."
7221204,46664553,2015-09-12,4659124,Lorinda,A beautiful room and very welcoming. Great bed ( and I'm picky). Jackie's description is very accurate. Wonderful pastries and yogurt in the am and a nice walk on the beach. She goes the extra mile to make sure you're comfortable and well cared for ! Also great recommendations for town dining much appreciated for our anniversary dinner! I would love to come back! 
7221204,47103349,2015-09-15,41668152,Christiane,The room was very comfortable and neat. Jackie was a very welcoming host and even left a snack for us in the fridge! The neighborhood was beautiful and quiet.
7221204,47851451,2015-09-21,33894826,Pete,"This room was a delightful work and rest spot a few minute walk from a private beach on the Sound.  The little fridge and coffee maker were perfect for my stay and Jackie provided additional breakfast ""treats"" during my stay with the Thai's.  Although I met the kids and the little dog, tranquility and productivity were my watchwords here!"
7221204,48019987,2015-09-22,43131970,Heidi,We are From the area and our usual places to crash were unavailable  we wanted something more homey and in the neighborhoods we visit the most. This place delivered. Jackie the host was gracious I letting us play in the back yard and on the beach. It was perfect for my daughter. 
7221204,49860910,2015-10-06,45577302,James,"I had a wonderful stay in this beautiful seaside neighbourhood.  The room was clean, comfortable and just as lovely as it looks in the photos! It really has everything you need and is extremely convenient. Jackie is a charming host and left lots of helpful information in the room as well as fresh fruit and delicious things for breakfast. For me, the best bits were going down to the beach in the morning for a walk and having Ballard just down the road for shopping and eating.  There was a great farmers' market there on Sunday morning too! "
7221204,51383485,2015-10-19,46164143,John,Nice room with private bathroom. Access to the private beach was very nice. The fridge was stocked with food and drinks. This was our first Airbnb experience and we couldn't have asked for a better place!

The listing was as described and their Ballard Neighbourhood was very quiet, peaceful with plenty of parking and very close to all the amenities. We enjoyed our stay very much. "
1198799,29538015,2015-04-08,17366785,Debra,Javier & Yeon were great hosts!  They live in a beautiful neighborhood and their home is very clean and has a warm atmosphere.  They were very friendly and left cookies and fruit in the room for me.  I felt very welcome and I'd definitely go back again.
1198799,29593016,2015-04-09,3351153,Scott,"I had a great time exploring Ballard, which quickly became my favorite neighborhood after visiting Seattle for a few days.  The location was perfectly situated around restaurants and fun bars.  Javier was very helpful with suggestions on where to hang out and walk around.  The room also came equipped with everything I needed for the night.  I'll be back, for sure!"
1198799,29770577,2015-04-12,29880756,Adam,Javier and Yeon were extremely gracious hosts. Our plane came in late but they still let us in at 1 am when we finally arrived. The room and bathroom were spotless and the bed comfortable. The location is very walkable to the Ballard area. Overall it was great. 
1198799,30657300,2015-04-25,8734754,Margaret,The title says it all! Very friendly and peaceful place to stay! I booked at the last minute and Javier & Yeon were very accommodating! ( I even got yummy fresh strawberries!!) The room was spotless and very comfortable! I had immediate access to the bathroom without having to interrupt the hosts. The location is great with everything you need within a few blocks. Highly recommend Javier & Yeon's room! Thank you!
1198799,31112479,2015-05-02,29676379,Jack,"Javier and Yeon were incredibly welcoming and I greatly enjoyed staying with them. Their place is perfectly located in Ballard, an easy walk from the restaurants and shops on Market Street, and an easy drive from the rest of Seattle. I'd highly recommend it!"
1198799,31685378,2015-05-08,8734754,Margaret,Even better the second time around! Javier and Yeon were very pleasant and accommodating! Thanks again!
1198799,32220881,2015-05-15,33202589,Celeste,"Wow! I don't even know where to begin. This was my first airbnb experience and I don't think it could have been better! Javier and Yeon were absolutely wonderful hosts - they were flexible, generous, and made us feel right at home. 

It was wonderful not only to share their beautiful clean space, but also have dynamic conversation and a delicious home cooked meal together. They had great suggestions for what to do in the neighborhood and beyond and we weren't disappointed when we took up on a few of their suggestions. Slate coffee is amazing!

I will definitely be staying here next time I visit the Seattle area and recommend this place for anyone who wants to stay somewhere that feels just like home. 

Thank you Javier and Yeon! "
1198799,32348543,2015-05-17,17690681,Helen,"Javier & Yeon are absolutely wonderful hosts! My friend and I stayed here this past weekend in Seattle and it was an extremely comfortable stay. Not only were Javier & Yeon accommodating with our arrival time being before check in but they were also very helpful with many wonderful suggestions. When we arrived to the house, it was exactly as pictured and everything was so clean.

The Ballard area is so great- filled with a big variety of coffee shops, bars, and restaurants you can't go wrong! We took public transportation for the majority of our trip so having the D line bus stop so close to the house was a huge plus! 

Javier & Yeon were very easy to communicate with, generous with their help, and even prepared fruit and delicious pastries for us! Needless to say, we are grateful to have stayed in this very friendly place in Ballard. 
"
1198799,43743214,2015-08-22,26923658,Brent,"Javier and Yeon were both extremely nice, generous, and thoughtful. I had an extended stay at ""A Friendly Place In Ballard"" and I absolutely loved it. The townhome is very close to many restaurants, stores, and breweries.

I would highly recommend this place. The room is comfortable, spotless, and you really couldn't ask for two nicer people to host your stay. You won't regret your stay in Ballard!"
1198799,44118221,2015-08-24,12069686,Yuki,Javier & Yeon were excellent host! The room was exactly the same as described on Airbnb page. It was even better!! They kindly invited us to a dinner and we had great time. The neighborhood was quiet and beautiful. Thank you for the great time. 
1198799,44544781,2015-08-27,38284981,Samantha,We had a great stay. The rooms and apartment were just as depicted in the description and photos. It was very clean. They were very accommodating and quick to respond to our needs. Parking was very easy on the street. Thanks for a lovely stay; we look forward to visiting Seattle again!
1198799,45096919,2015-08-31,5479511,Wendy,"Javier and Yeon were the perfect hosts.  Great insight to the neighborhood and things to do, generous with their time, yet respectful of my time and space.  This is a great location, and I couldn't recommend it more!"
1198799,47031793,2015-09-15,32508978,Johnny,"It was very nice to stay at Javier and Yeons in Seattle. 
The place is nice and clean and the hosts are nice and helpful.
We will recommend this place.

Best regards Johnny Bastiansen"
1198799,47419971,2015-09-18,43805720,Anna,This was a great place to stay. Javier an Yeon were lovely hosts and I had a great night's sleep.
1198799,48694212,2015-09-28,363945,Sarah,"Staying with Javier and Yeon was a joy. They were so friendly and made me feel right at home. Everything was as described, clean and in a great location. Javier and Yeon were also really helpful with suggestions of things to do in the neighborhood. I would highly recommend staying here! Thanks Javier and Yeon!"
1198799,55084246,2015-11-27,22100044,Rebecca,"Our family member got snowed in and never made it to Seattle so we never used ""A Friendly Place in Ballard"".  The hosts were inviting, accommodating and in frequent contact with us.  Sorry that we missed the opportunity to stay there but will keep it in mind for next time!"
1198799,55958803,2015-12-07,49509274,Rita,"Javier and Yeon are the sweetest and most accommodating people you will meet.  The neighborhood is wonderful and literally a minute or two to downtown Ballard where there are shops and restaurants.  The home is clean, warm and welcoming.  When my plans changed they were gracious and understanding.   "
1198799,58232398,2016-01-01,52203319,Chang,"It's very lucky for me to spent several days with Javier and Yeon in their lovely  home first time using Airbnb.  They are both very kind and considerate, giving us great recommendations of where to eat or enjoy coffee. And their home locates in a terrific location for visitors who don't have a car, which is less than five minutes to Dline station heading to Seattle downtown.  

Since we have a tight schedule visiting Seattle this time,  there's not much time spending quality time with them but we still had great time chatting with Airbnb App. 

Next time I visit Seattle, I will definitely choose Javier and Yeon 's home."
3200646,15293983,2014-07-06,16971481,Ben,"What a fun place to stay!  I was the first occupant of the Spruce Goose, and I give it two thumbs up!  Jean-Marc's craftsmanship is top notch and the charm of both wagons is awesome.  The common area was unexpected and really made the place great to stay.  There is a couch, DVD collection, Keurig machine, water cooler, refrigerator, and a nice clean/full bathroom complete with fresh towels for each occupant in the closet.  Jean-Marc and Maggie were very friendly.  I'm looking forward to staying here some time down the road."
3200646,15437057,2014-07-08,6904797,Maria,"This is a good place to stay.  They are great hosts, it is run like a country inn.  There is a dull whoosh from the street below.  There is also the occasional waft from the nearby dispensary.  Inside the house is cool, so you can hang out there if the wagon isn't where want you be all the time. I would recommend this place, it is a bargain too."
3200646,15518207,2014-07-10,16663309,Mary,"The Spruce Caboose was as advertised. It was small but very comfortable. The fans was appreciated as it as about 90 degrees outside, but it didn't get too hot inside.The open space available to the guests was very nice and spacious. Towels were provided in the bathroom, and were nice and fluffy. The location was solid, with a D line bus to downtown or Ballard about 100 feet away from the house. My husband and I felt very welcome, and we enjoyed our stayed. We would not hesitate to stay with Jean-Marc again in the future."
3200646,15652185,2014-07-13,447674,Vanessa,This place was amazing. Jean-Marc is unbelievably nice and accommodating. I would highly recommend staying here.
3200646,15839815,2014-07-16,16833771,George,We really enjoyed staying in the Spruce Kaboose. It's very well made and the bed is roomier than it looks. It's in a great location; close to downtown. The hosts were very friendly and professional. We'd definitely stay there again.
3200646,15982138,2014-07-19,16580714,Marci,This place was adorable. The craftsmanship on the Spruce Kaboose was incredible and the quite spot was peaceful and restful. I felt quite comfortable the duration of my stay and Jean-Marc and Maggie made me feel right at home.
3200646,16133669,2014-07-22,17313350,Dan,"The Spruce Caboose Micro gypsy wagon is exactly as pictured! Very comfortable bed, plenty of room for two to sleep.  The common area is accessible any time, and had just what we needed. 5 minute easy access to downtown Seattle, easy to come and go, this place was great!"
3200646,16266249,2014-07-24,10895238,Eva & Robert,"That was again one of our very positive airbnb experiences. We enjoyed our cute, cosy Gypsy Wagon. Of course it is tiny, but the queen size bed was easily big enough for us and there is enough storage room under the bed. Also the common guest area in the host's house was nice and spacious and we spent quite some time there, using the good wifi for planning our further trip. During our stay, we shared the common area with 4 other guests, which was not a problem at all, it was nice chatting with them. There is free coffee in the common area. And another positive fact: the bus line D to the centre stops just across the street. "
3200646,16425408,2014-07-27,4356300,Edward And Amelie,"Jay has a warm handshake and a soft, big voice.  His is a personality that fits the cozy warmth of the wooden caravans he's built in their backyard.  We (Ed and Amelie)  occupied the Spruce Caboose for three nights.  I was initially concerned about being so close to busy 15th, but there was no problem with noise.  The caboose is also water-tight and well-ventilated, both necessities in the unpredictable Seattle summer climate.  There was also protected WiFi from the wagon. The shared bathroom and living area inside the house operated very smoothly, like the cleanest, quietest hostel I've ever seen.  We'd wake up to golden sunshine filtering in through the stained glass windows, roll off the bunk, walk across the lawn, and say ""hello"" to the adorably shaggy-eared rabbit in the hutch by the garden.  Going inside the Dutch backdoor, we'd wait no longer than a polite 15 minutes (but usually not at all) for the shower, enjoying a coffee or tea in the swinging chair in the backyard.  Loads of clean towels, color-coded by caravan, were stacked daily in the bathroom cabinet, and on the wall were drying hooks a-plenty.  Staying at Jay and Maggie's place felt like staying at the castle of West Wheeler."
3200646,16629622,2014-07-30,17984061,Kevin,Cute place.  Easy access to downtown and Ballard. Take the D bus up to the locks. Nice little trip.
3200646,17122607,2014-08-07,1579848,Lupita,"My sister and I stayed in the Spruce Caboose. We enjoyed staying in such a clean and beautiful space, with amazing and helpful hosts. The Spruce Caboose was made beautifully, every inch beautifully and carefully crafted. The wagon was spotless, with just the right amount of space to have a good nights sleep, a fan, heater and plenty of space for our luggage.  The shared space included everything we needed a sitting area and a dinning table, plus a microwave, fridge and many clean towels, and free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate:). There are soooo many more positives to Jean-Marc and Maggie's place, we were already expecting a clean adorable place but upon arrival their place exceeded our expectations.  I highly recommend to anybody traveling to Seattle:)
"
3200646,17230976,2014-08-09,18456052,Margy,"Our overall experience was amazing.  It was myself and my boyfriend in the Spruce Caboose, which was really nice.  We loved Jean-Marc (J) and his family.  He has a perfect layout, if you want to interact with him you are more than welcome; otherwise he will leave you to enjoy yourself.   If your in Seattle and you need to know anything about the local setting, make sure and ask J first; he wont misguide you.  The neighborhood is nice and you feel safe.  There is a garden , bunny, and chickens, and dogs in the backyard, but they have their own space away from the guests.  We actually loved having them around.  J created and built all of the units himself with amazing craftsmanship.   You have access to the internet, he provides all the basics in the common area and gives his suggestions for places to eat and see.   The common area has coffee, cups, fresh towels (labeled per unit), small fridge, microwave, blow dryer, plenty of mirrors and places to get ready.   There are outlets in the units as well.  J has heaters and fans for all the units to keep it comfortable.  The location is great for seeing Seattle.  J is a very free and come as you are person, you always feel welcome and you never feel like your invading his personal space.    This was a highlight of our trip and will be back."
3200646,17517132,2014-08-13,17924138,Ettie,"We absolutely loved our time in the gypsy wagons! There were two of us, and we had plenty of room. The common room was great and was always stocked with coffee, tea, water and tons of great movie options. jay and Maggie were great hosts. They give us a great dinner suggestion when we arrived and even had a list of nearby attractions. The d line bus stops right in front of their place, so it's an easy 15 minute bus ride to downtown seattle. I can't say enough great things about this lodging setup! Just great! "
3200646,18067566,2014-08-21,18060217,David,"Jay was very friendly and helpful upon our arrival.  The Spruce Caboose was just what we expected and served us well.  WiFi worked almost all the time, coffee was provided, and we were left alone.  Other guests were nice, though with 6 guests on property, there was competition for bathroom time.  The bed was comfortable, but the neighborhood is next to a noisy rail yard and a neighbor began hammering and using power tools at 6:40 am."
3200646,18192778,2014-08-23,3105614,Chris,"Jean-Marc was a great host.  Responded to messages immediately and welcomed me upon my arrival.  He pointed me in the right direction to grab a beer and a good meal in Magnolia. This is a unique place.  Sort of like camping, but nothing to set up.  His garden backyard is like a storybook garden with these handcrafted sleeper units.  Place was booked, but I never saw anyone else there, as I was coming and going.  Shared space bathroom/kitchenette, living space were more than adequate and I would have used more had I not had a full schedule.  Loved the chickens and the rabbit.. Just a great unique experience you won't find anywhere. "
3200646,18341485,2014-08-25,19263274,Kelsey,We had a great stay here. It was very comfortable and welcoming. Having pillows and towels on site was nice. It was very convenient to get to downtown from this location. I would definitely stay here again.
3200646,18568783,2014-08-28,2253532,Jeff,"This was my second time here, the last time my wife and I stayed in the Tiny Cabin. I like this place, quiet, convenient and well appointed. Both the cabin and the Spruce Caboose are nice and cozy."
3200646,18840844,2014-09-01,5213075,Alan,The Spruce Kabose was as described and our stay was (website hidden) was a great host and accommodating. No problems at all. The D bus in extremely convenient and makes the house central to most things in Seattle.
3200646,18957218,2014-09-03,18954027,Joseph,"Host was very welcoming yet not overbearing. You can come and go as you like. Everything was as described. The animals in the backyard were very cute, and the area is between a main road and an upscale, hilly neighborhood.

I walked the entire time I was in Seattle, and this was around 20-30 minutes from the Space Needle and 50-60 minutes from Pike Place Market. The entire walk is pretty nice, and there are lots of nice places to eat and drink at in the Queen Anne neighborhood (mostly south and east of the place).

I'm about 6' and the Spruce Caboose was more than enough for me. There's a heater and a fan to keep you comfortable, and there's also ample space below the bed to store your stuff. Would definitely stay again."
3200646,20024131,2014-09-22,8678934,Andrea,"We stayed in the micro wagon. Jean-Marc was really quick to respond to messages, and was nice despite us waking him up Sunday morning when we locked the keys in the Wagon. The Wagon we stayed in was very small, but we didn't mind that part. I am 5'7"" and the bed was just long enough. Very interesting set up there. The house is not in the most attractive part of town, but right next to a bus that takes you downtown in 10-15 minutes, as well as a set of fun staircases to take you up/east into Queen Anne (if you like that type of thing). Only issue was there is 1 bathroom that many people were sharing, so more often than not you would have wait during high use times like in the morning. For the price it was great. "
3200646,22334063,2014-11-03,4232595,Jon,"Jean-Marc and Maggie are incredible hosts who have built something truly special in a quiet corner of Queen Anne. 
They're available to address an issue if you have one but are never overbearing. 
Stay in a gypsy caravan the next time you come to Seattle it's an awesome experience. "
3200646,22438986,2014-11-06,18939297,Sarah,"Great Location! Took advantage of The Whole Foods Store down the block a lot while we were there. Very convenient for transportation as well. I really loved staying in the Micro Gypsy Wagon with my infant. It was nice and cozy. Also the mattress is VERY firm...if you like that.
Wonderful craftsmanship! Would definitely stay there again. The Host was very friendly and accommodating the whole time. Staying here made our trip to Seattle a very special experience!"
3200646,22672121,2014-11-11,13711364,Nicole,"J's wagons are fantastic! They're wonderfully crafted and very cozy. They're in a convenient location for touring around different parts of Seattle (Ballard, Freemont, downtonwn, etc) and not far from a nice bike trail. There's a whole foods right across the street, and a coffee shop not to far away. J was very welcoming: he gave us a brief tour and made sure we had all the information we needed, and then gave us our space.
We would most certainly stay here again!"
3200646,23188754,2014-11-24,15168493,Reza,"Really cool, camping in the cabin right in the city. Great location. Jean-Marc friendly and helpful. Quiet, clean and safe. Cabin may be small for bigger people though. Thank you JM!"
3200646,23337675,2014-11-29,6246109,Steve & Anne,"J and family were wonderful hosts. Warm, open to requests, and very engaging when I arrived. Once I was sorted they left me to my own devices and had a wonderful 4 days in the wagon.

During this time it was cold, windy, and storming rain. The wagon stayed warm and dry, and the sounds of wind and rain were incredibly soothing each night. I slept better than I have in a long time.

They aren't kidding about the size. I'm 5'4"" and was not at all cramped, but I can totally see how someone over 5'10"" or so would have some trouble. The bigger wagon next to it would be good for that.

The shared bathroom was clean, warm, and comfortable.

This place is an adventure. I recommend it. And I'll be back next time I'm in Seattle!"
3200646,23767147,2014-12-09,24175083,Tiffany,Everything I expected was as is and even better! The craftsmanship that was put into the wagon was amazing and was the most unique and adorable living arrangement that I have experienced. The wagon ended up being the perfect size to share for two and the height of it never bothered us (we're 5'8). The wagon actually ended up to be one of our favorite parts of our trip to Seattle and we even found ourselves retrieving home early a few nights to cozy up in it. Sharing a bathroom was never an issue and we hardly ever ran into other renters. As for the neighborhood it was extremely close to Ballard and only a cheap ($5-10) uber ride away from everything else
3200646,24052917,2014-12-18,19359309,Jennifer,"Wagon was great and super cozy. Location was good. Construction next door was not awesome, but couldn't be helped. "
3200646,24206305,2014-12-22,1791332,Franza & Aloysius,"The micro cabin is the cutest cool place we have stayed so far! It's abt 30min bus ride away from downtown, tucked in a quiet residential neighborhood. Though small, it comes with a electric heater (coz it's winter now) and has ports for us to charge our phones/iPad. The bathroom is in the main house building and has basic shower facilities (good to have flip flops). Overall, it was a fun experience camping in this little cabin ;) "
3200646,24286249,2014-12-24,24899996,Jenifer,"J. was a great host, came out to meet us as we walked up. He answered all our questions about his business, very friendly and approachable. He showed us to our wagon and had kindly supplied us each with a towel to borrow. 
The neighborhood is in a good location. It was a quick drive downtown. 
The wagon was beautifully built. Everything was perfectly clean, and there was a lot of space to store all of our things. J. put a space heater inside that does a more than adequate job of keeping things cozy in the December chill, and the small fan - when placed under the bed - does the trick of circulating the cool and hot air to keep things just right. "
3200646,24725031,2015-01-02,20710905,Jacquie,We enjoyed our stay in the Gypsy Wagon. Jean-Marc was very helpful.  The wagon was cozy and ideally located for our stay.
3200646,24969100,2015-01-04,21243223,Amy,We didn't actually get to meet Jean-Marc but there was a binder of useful information. The wagon was really cute and cozy. It's great that there was a fan and a heater. We're impressed that it was handmade! It was really convenient to get downtown with transit.
3200646,25441289,2015-01-16,24459078,Yuan,We stayed in the smallest wagon and really enjoyed the stay. The wagon was cute and unique in an urban setting. Jean-Marc and family were very friendly. Everything was super clean especially the shared bathroom which we really appreciate. The wagon was warm in the winter so no worries about that. It is also well located with a direct bus line right in front of home that takes you to most of the touristy areas in 15 minutes. I would recommend choosing to stay here.
3200646,26706764,2015-02-17,19591070,Natalie,"My stay at the Gypsy wagon was great! I stayed there for 4 days 3 nights and had no problems. The area is small, as listed, but for the price, it's totally worth it! The location was perfect and was located around all the main attractions in Seattle. I had a car, so I don't know much about the bus line, but it was about 15 minute driving distance to where we wanted to visit! Safe neighborhood, the hosts were very organized with how they set up their homes for the guests. "
3200646,26888555,2015-02-21,27602068,Diana,"We stayed in the Micro for 2 nights and had a great experience. John-Marc was very friendly and greeted us upon check-in. We were only traveling by bus and the D line was great for getting downtown both days to sightsee. There you can connect to the bus station to see other parts of town. We also did some exploring in Queen Anne and ate some great food plus visited Kerry Park. If you're contemplating staying, do it!! Awesome experience that you won't forget!"
3200646,27342010,2015-03-02,2235730,Jacob,"This was the second time I stayed here and both times have been great. It was close to cafes and the bus stop, which was very convenient. I would definitely stay here again. "
3200646,27677200,2015-03-09,26620206,Gi,My host was very sweet. I only met Jean-Marc once but he was very helpful. Such a cool setup in their backyard!
3200646,28323741,2015-03-22,8093595,Jessica,This is a very unique experience! The place was very cozy~ I highly recommend it! 
3200646,28507964,2015-03-24,29653279,Claudius,"Jean Marc was extremely friendly and inviting, so was his family. I instantly felt welcome. After we got to know each other he advised me on things to do and see in Seattle. Each recommendation was spot on. His property is beautiful, cozy, and well kept. The rooms i.e. gypsy wagons are works of art. I believe one of them has won an award. They we're clean and comfortable. I recommend this air b&b to anyone that is looking to stay in Seattle, as it's location is also very accessible to Seattle's downtown. Thanks to Jean Marc and his family for a wonderful stay! "
3200646,28999511,2015-04-02,24740172,Amanda,We loved staying in this teeny house! The sound of the rain falling on the roof & waking up to birds in the morning felt very peaceful. Everything was very clean & adorable.
3200646,29684860,2015-04-11,29413469,Joe,"Jean-Marc and Maggie are good hosts and sweet people. The wagon is cool and a nice little place to stay, and in beautiful surroundings. We were very happy with our experience. "
3200646,29849634,2015-04-13,28414832,Katherine,"I didn't meet Jean-Marc beyond waving through a window, but I was able to chat briefly with his wife upon arrival.  The wagon is a lovely handcrafted piece of art.  The super comfy bed and heater made my rainy, chilly arrival much appreciated.  I spent my Seattle visit relying on transit and having the D bus a stone's throw away was fantastic.  I definitely recommend them and would happily book again if my travels found me in the city again."
3200646,30390612,2015-04-21,28652931,Travis,Pretty rad place. Chill hosts. Excellent and convenient location. Definitely recommend and will be staying there again!
3200646,30624584,2015-04-25,4318368,Kath,Staying with J was wonderful! Exactly the experience we were looking for. Very laid back and so convenient with the bus line into the city. Having a whole foods nearby was helpful as well. Thanks so much and we would definitely come back!!
3200646,30959609,2015-04-29,12361167,Rebecca,"We loved the Micro gypsy wagon and hope to stay again in the future!  Jean-Marc is an impressive craftsman, we enjoyed the details.  Waking up to softly clucking chickens and bunnies was magical."
3200646,31742270,2015-05-09,5084137,Sean,"The gypsy wagon was an awesome place to stay in Seattle. It was very cozy and comfortable, and it was ideally located. Jean-Marc was a friendly and considerate host and I would definitely recommend staying here!"
3200646,33916097,2015-06-02,3099886,Isabelle,"Amazing stay as always, JM and Maggie are such nice host. Very comfy tiny caby, we loved it, it was perfect. Nice new bathroom also. Cant wait to try the new room on the top in the attic, such à nice View. "
3200646,34171210,2015-06-05,6866789,Chris,"This was an amazing experience.  I came off of a long ship contract and wanted to spend a few days in Seattle to see friends.  Everyone I know there lives downtown, so this locations was perfect.  Everything was a quick bus ride or Uber trip away, and I had an absolute blast.  Jean-Marc welcomed me upon arrival and was quick to answer any questions I had.  I felt at home there immediately.  The Micro Gypsy Wagon was adorable.  It was outfitted with comfortable sheets and clean towels, and there was tons of storage under the bed for my large amount of luggage and gear.

The animals onsite are really cute and brightened my day, and the overall energy of the place is warm and friendly.  I felt comfortable and welcome for my entire stay."
3200646,34479804,2015-06-08,10637727,Zhao,"The experience is overall (website hidden) is friendly, he welcoms us upon our late arrival, and helps us with wifi connection problems promptly. The location is convenient, not so far away from DT. As a light sleeper, my complaints would be the environment noise of traffic and the wood-like smell of the wagon. "
3200646,34991857,2015-06-14,33924200,Terry,Was a really enjoyable stay... hosts are friendly and nice people and the tiny house was immaculate. Sleeping with the cool Pacific breeze gently blowing through the open window and split front door was devine. Wishing I could have stayed more than six days.
3200646,35480142,2015-06-19,6970681,Christine,"This place is way awesome. My boyfriend and I couldn't have asked for a better setup and nicer people to facilitate it. Jean Marc and his family are very accommodating, they answered all of our questions and gave us great suggestions on where to go and places to eat. They leave you alone for the most part, but are easy to contact if you need them. Jean Marc has built three beautiful standalone ""cabin/wagons"". They are all unique and beautifully crafted. We just happened to have the smallest of the three, although my 6'2 boyfriend could not stand up inside of it we did not mind one bit. If you are new to seattle and are mostly there to see the sights, these tiny wagons are perfect simply because you are mostly in them to sleep. I especially loved that each one has numerous windows (we kept them open most of the time, the weather was so nice). If we ever come back to seattle we will definitely hit up Jean Marc again. He's currently working on another room, and I can't wait to see the finished product! Thank you Jean Marc!"
3200646,35833512,2015-06-22,10999218,Stephanie,"Pros: the host family allowed us to get our stuff in earlier than stated ""check-in""; the location is very close to a bus stop; an electric plug on both sides of the bed

Cons: to say it's for 2 people is a stretch. If it's a couple, then sleeping quarters are not as bad. There's a space smaller than the porch inside before you hit the bed. And that's about it. 

Most people I know define ""near downtown"" as a 10 minute walk. If we were to walk, it was almost an hour. It was 1/2 hour by bus. 

We never saw the hosts, or spoke to them. That's fine, but when we arrived, we didn't know for sure which unit we were to be in (there are 3 in the yard). I tried to ask, but never got a response. I hope we were in the correct one...

Basically this place is an over-priced hostel. If you are fine with hostel-type living, then this is the place for you.

We both thought it was going to be a fun adventure to stay here, but for the price, extremely cramped quarters, sharing of the bathroom (a glorified bath house), we wished we'd looked elsewhere. "
3200646,36133231,2015-06-25,7261821,David,"Wonderful host, communicated well, clean and comfortable magic gypsy wagon to stay in. Convenient location would definitely stay here again!"
3200646,36325381,2015-06-27,35919776,Yutaro,"Convenient location and Friendly host. clean and very comfortable gypsy wagon to stay in. i got fantastic memory with my girlfriend. I want stay again.
"
3200646,36573350,2015-06-29,7872888,Sachi,"The gypsy wagon was great!  Yes, it was small, but beautiful and had everything we needed.  Guest instructions were clear for check in/out and bathroom so there weren't any issues sharing the space with other guests.  Would highly recommend it!"
3200646,37359294,2015-07-06,28367360,Nora,"Jean-Marc was a great host! My friend and I didn't have set-in-stone plans for our trip and he helped give us directions and suggestions. The house is super easy to find from the d-line so if you don't have a car, this place is PERFECT,"
3200646,37771703,2015-07-10,35739216,Leslie,"Lovely stay! Like camping in the city. I miss the bunnies already.

What really impressed me was how Jean-Marc and his wife went out of their way to make sure I'd be comfortable. I wrote Jean-Marc a week before our stay asking if they might provide an extra pillow or two as I'm 6 months pregnant and they actually went out and bought a brand new body pillow for me to use, just like the one I have at home. When you're pregnant it makes a big difference in how well you sleep. They accompanied it with a thoughtful note too.  I really appreciated the gesture - made me feel very welcome. We chatted with them on the first night, otherwise we didn't have any contact.

The micro gypsy wagon is the smallest of their accommodations. It's a tight squeeze for a couple but very cozy. It is a bit like staying in a tent in terms of how much room you have, but much more comfortable. There were two outlets (four plugs altogether) so no competition over charging phones, etc.

I was worried that we'd be sweltering hot at night without AC in the Seattle heat wave, but it turned out not to be an issue at all. We didn't even use the fan. It actually got chilly at night and we used the comforter. You can open the windows for a nice cross breeze. 

The shared bathroom is basic but very clean and well-ventilated. The shower had instant hot water with good pressure. Everywhere it's obvious Jean-Marc is an excellent builder and handyman.  From the wagon you walk across the back yard to get to the bathroom, petting the bunnies on the way. We never experienced a wait for the bathroom.

It's about 20-25 minutes to downtown from their house. Not a super short distance but the trip is easy and direct. You can see their house from the bus stop.  It's located in between a residential area and a main road/light industrial area, so if you're hoping to just stroll around the neighborhood looking to grab a bite within walking distance you're not going to find it. There is a Whole Foods a stop or two away, or you can hop on the bus for a 10 minute ride up to Ballard, where there are lots of good options.

We left early morning to catch a train and Uber arrived to pick us up in 4 minutes at 6:30am.

If you're a couple with a kid I'd recommend the little cabin or their rooftop room. Great to get a little taste of urban homesteading."
3200646,38634085,2015-07-17,36277426,Hailey,"I had a lovely stay in the micro gypsy wagon. Jean-Marc was very accommodating and came out to get us when we arrived. The bunnies were so snuggly and I enjoyed chatting with the other travelers. I felt like I was camping, which I love! I'm looking forward to coming back in October with my mom for her birthday."
3200646,39028142,2015-07-20,12799554,Ellie,"Just back from a wonderful 2 night stay in the Micro Gypsy Wagon. Incredible little space, very airy and cool despite the scorching Seattle weather over the weekend. Convenient location, lovely accommodation and property. Between the gardens, the details in the campers, and the chickens and rabbits on the grounds, you can see that the home is a true labour of love for Jean-Marc and Maggie. "
3200646,39352359,2015-07-22,21732634,John,"Such a retreat for my business trip! It felt like an escape, while being so convenient to the city. The wagon was just a bed, but I'm usually out for much of the day/evening. It was warm, but there's a fan and it cools off for nice sleeping temp. I'm just about 6' tall, and the ceiling is right there, but no problem stretching out in bed. Awesome experience!"
3200646,39527808,2015-07-24,36961538,Marianne,Great first airbnb experience! The wagon was comfortable and a nice quiet area to rest after a day of wandering around the city nearby. I didn't have any problems sharing the space with the other guests and it was awesome having the animals around :) Would definitely stay here again!
3200646,39938451,2015-07-27,33317339,Parth,It was awesome staying in the wagon. One of a kind experience.
3200646,40257539,2015-07-29,15831749,Kristin,We felt very welcomed upon our arrival. The Micro Gypsy Wagon was adorable and the bed very comfortable. 
3200646,40503782,2015-07-31,32311221,Jeff,Really fun. Is basically just a bed and a lamp but is the coolest bed and lamp. Chickens made no noise in the morning (Whew!) And host was awesome.
3200646,41947438,2015-08-10,34368273,Behdad,"Pretty cute place, it seems small but it's even enough for two people.

I believe I met Jean and he was such a nice guy. Would definitely recommend this place and this host."
3200646,42354043,2015-08-12,40806502,Dan,The wagon was in great condition. Great to get in and go to bed. There is an electric outlet which is nice. And a fan that kept the temperature about right. Bathroom/shower was nice and clean. We did find parking on the street. I love the concept and wish there were more of these around.
3200646,42559481,2015-08-14,38247315,Grace,"We absolutely loved the Micro Wagon! It was such a fun experience to stay in, and we appreciated the towels, fan, and guide book to restaurants around. The yard was quiet and the other b&b-ers were friendly. "
3200646,42912987,2015-08-16,38501870,Crystal,"I had an absolutely amazing stay. The location was central to the D-line bus which takes you essentially anywhere you need to go, or at least near another bus that can take you to it. 
There's a space under the bed (The ""under-the-bed dungeon"") You can keep anything you can keep anything you want under there, backpacks, snacks, clothes, whatever you're bringing along :) The bathroom is shared, but kept very tidy and you get two fresh towels. There's a whole garden and a wall of blackberries that stretches around the back. There's sort of a rustic feeling to the whole place, and a tranquil quiet inside of the wagon. This is a small paradise, even if you're only staying for a night or two."
3200646,43416222,2015-08-19,39312349,Amy,"My stay in the Micro Gypsy Wagon was lovely. It was evident how much love and hard work was put into building the wagon.
Finding the place was no problem and checking in was easy. Our communication back and forth was great through messaging, and though we only crossed paths once, JM and Maggie were very sweet. They also provided a list of recommended places to see and help with transportation that was much appreciated, since I didn't have a vehicle.   
The wagon itself was small, but had plenty of room for my bags and me. The bed was very comfortable and everything was clean, including the shared bathroom which is just a few steps from the wagon. 
The weather during my stay was perfect in the upper 70's and sunny during the day and at night with the windows open and the fan helping it was nice and cool.
I had a a friend who lives in Seattle so getting around was easy for me, but if you don't have a way of transportation the bus is right across the street. Otherwise you have to be willing to put in a good bit of walking to reach many places other than the Wholefoods. Which wasn't a bad thing since the traffic wasn't bad, but just something to be prepared for.
Both nights were fantastic and restful, and checking out was easy.
All in all I enjoyed my stay in the Micro Wagon, I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
3200646,44153648,2015-08-24,21929531,Chris,Great little cottage. Was just the right size for a solo traveler. Came with fresh towels! The backyard area was also quite cute. 
3200646,45096258,2015-08-31,37572536,Dayna,This place was great! Tons of character and everything was clearly laid out. Very close access to the D line and a whole foods which was great. I would definitely consider staying here again if I'm in Seattle :) 
3200646,45441426,2015-09-02,8146976,Rosanna,"Jean-Marc welcomed us very nicely and showed us around the property. Our stay in the micro wagon was pleasant and cozy, everything was clean and taken care of and I'd go back in a heartbeat!"
3200646,46149235,2015-09-08,279223,David,"We absolutely loved staying here. Jean-Marc was very friendly and accommodating when we arrived. We loved being able to pet the bunnies everyday and feed the chickens! The bed was comfortable and a great option for a place to stay in Seattle if you are looking to save a few bucks and up for a little adventure sleeping. We would recommend bringing some shoes for the shower - it rained while we were there and made for a muddy trip to and from the bathroom. Overall, a very comfortable, clean and lovely stay. We would recommend their place to any and all!"
3200646,47420158,2015-09-18,43806701,Dave,We had a great time! We didn't see Jean-Marc or family but there was a nice binder of information in the wagon. Had fun feeding the chickens and petting the rabbits. Even though other people were staying there as well we had a good amount of privacy and not too long of a wait for the washrooms. Easy to get everywhere via the D-line and there's a nice walk up an over pass and you can easily get a good view and a nice breakfast from Macrina Bakery. 
3200646,48923257,2015-09-29,2127977,Doris,"Great location, cozy clean and warm cabin.  It is tight as the listing suggests but if all you are doing is crashing after long wonderful days in Seattle, it's perfect.  You cannot get a more Seattle experience than in this backyard with chickens, angora rabbits, handmade sculptures, artsy labels in patch gardens."
3200646,49659458,2015-10-05,43448685,Danielle,My stay at the micro gypsy wagon was amazing!! Everything about the experience was fun and memorable! Great location as well! Bus stop is literally right infront of the house! The area itself is beautiful!! 
3200646,55378783,2015-12-01,41829892,Michelle,It's a really nice place and the transportation is convenient.
3200646,55994738,2015-12-07,13407543,Kamil,"I went here on a personal writing retreat. The gypsy caravan cabin is what drew me to the location. I was happy to see that the yard was no less awesome. There is a garden, a slide, chickens and bunnies! There is also a community garden across the street that I took a walk in. There were not that many stores and shops near by. There is a Whole Foods within walking distance though. The character of the place is really what drew me here."
3200646,57849982,2015-12-29,48099857,Jean-Sébastien,"Super... Jean-Marc est agréable, l'endroit est propre et il y a un super marché pas très loin de chez lui. Quand même près du centre-ville. J'ai pris une marche de 50 minutes et j'y (website hidden) manquez pas Pike market"
3200646,58099490,2015-12-31,32553731,Shannon,"This micro AirBnb was the perfect stay for my short layover. It felt incredibly cozy and warm even when there was frost on the ground. I had a late arrival after dark and getting into the tiny wagon was still incredibly easy. It's a nice bed with storage for all your good underneath. The windows were too cute and opened to allow fresh air in and enjoy a tree house type feel. I felt like it provided everything I needed in terms of privacy. The bathhouse was busy with so many other travelers staying on the property  but I was able to get in each morning for a very brief shower. Shower does have a timer but I was able to get cleaned up. Whole Foods down the street made for an excellent lunch spot. For a traveler that needs nothing more than their book for entertainment and a place to stow their goods, this was a delightful little slice of Seattle. "
3200646,58476904,2016-01-02,46349629,Carl,It's awesome cube.  I have been in there for 2 nice days. 
7922063,43890488,2015-08-22,27891498,Richard,"Jaime was a perfect host. Friendly, accommodating and the blow up mattress was very comfy. 
She's lovely and very easy on the eyes.
Stay with her!"
5719631,38871326,2015-07-19,22061447,Prashanti,"The apartment is in a good location. Really close to walk to the UW campus. The description is accurate. 

It did get a bit hot in the bedroom but Melissa provided me a fan on request.  Everything about the apartment is good except the internet. 

I could not connect to the network mentioned in the house manual. Melissa provided me another network which worked well sometimes and disappeared other times. I later figured out that the wifi signal is okay in the living room and really bad in the bedroom. I don't understand why the router was not in the apartment instead of somewhere else where the tenant cannot reset it.  I had to schlep out to UW campus two times at 5 am just to have internet to work for a deadline.  

Melissa was helpful and prompt in trying to fix the internet situation. However, it was very inconvenient since I had a lot of work to do. "
5719631,39565103,2015-07-24,36571728,Kate,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and Melissa made it easy and comfortable. The listing was accurate. She supplied extra towels and bedding for us when we requested it for our son, and also kindly supplied a fan (without being asked) since it was an unusually hot time in Seattle. She stopped by the next day to double check that we had everything that we needed. We slept very well, since the bed was comfortable. Melissa included little things, like an iron and ironing board, which I wasn't expecting but appreciated.

The location is excellent. An hourly car rental service keeps a car in the parking lot (and more nearby), which we used to take a trip up to the Boeing factory, and frequent buses run downtown within a few blocks of the apartment. Even though this unit isn't in the middle of downtown, we had no problem getting around the city inexpensively. Melissa was a great host, and we enjoyed our stay!"
5719631,41096214,2015-08-04,36204916,Stephen,The place was as advertised. Spacious and comfortable. Melissa was very responsive to our needs. Great location. Very quiet but only a block or two away from restaurants and such. Excellent access to public transportation. Would stay there again. 
3774113,20113350,2014-09-23,20806907,Carlos,"We stayed for 10 days with Sandra, Bob and Grace and was a wonderful experience. The neighbourhood is safe and beautiful, the apartment is cozy, the kitchen is fully equipped, it has a nice and big tv with tons of channels, and a deck with a beautiful view. The most important thing: the place was immaculate upon our arrival. 

Also, our hosts gave us a very warm welcome and good recommendations for touristing and dining in the area since we have never been to Seattle before. The door of his house was literally open most of the time but they were also completely respectful of our privacy.

One last thing: I personally slept in the leather couch that pulls out to a queen size sleeper bed and you can't tell the difference between an actual bed and the couch. It is extremely comfortable. 

I would definitely stay here If/When I go back to Seattle."
3774113,41259624,2015-08-05,2097040,Julian,"This is a wonderful place to stay in Seattle! The host (Sandra) was welcoming, and gave us useful tips for our time in Seattle. We were there as a family (two 6-year-olds and an infant); this place was perfect for us. (Thanks for the bins of toys -- they went over well!) The apartment is brand new and very nice: well-designed, very comfortable, extremely clean, and nice and sunny. The apartment opens onto a private yard. The neighborhood is safe and quiet, and with many amenities within an easy, short drive. The description of this apartment is fully accurate.  We would gladly stay here again! "
3774113,48564507,2015-09-27,36965914,James,Beautiful house and neighborhood.  Very nice hosts that go out of their way to make you feel at home and introduce you to the area.  
3739681,16879173,2014-08-03,5576024,Shelley,"The apartment was in a great location, close to good restaurants and downtown. The neighborhood was very pleasant, with good architecture and plenty of parking. The apartment was quiet and welcoming.  There were plenty of windows, despite the fact that it is a basement apartment.  "
3739681,17480772,2014-08-12,3528358,Jason,"If you're looking to stay in Seattle, talk to Matt! He and his brother were both great hosts. My girlfriend and I stayed here for three nights while in town for a friend's wedding, opting to forego the reserved hotel for something much closer to the venue. Matt's apartment was just what we wanted! The place is cozy but not cramped, offering more space than you'd get from a hotel with just as much privacy.

The surrounding area is charming and very walkable, although it's a bit difficult to get cabs to other areas of the city at off-hours. There is a grocery store and a pharmacy right around the corner, and plenty of bars and restaurants within a few blocks.

We didn't spend much of our weekend in the apartment, preferring to explore the neighborhood when we weren't at the wedding or various rehearsal activities beforehand, but when we did need to take a break and relax in the middle of a busy day, this apartment was just the oasis we needed."
3739681,17968590,2014-08-19,19156125,Martin,"Wallingford is a great place to stay in seattle. If you are plan to stay in seattle, talk to Matt. He is a great host, give good tips for restaurant and bars. The neighborhood was very pleasant."
3739681,18586905,2014-08-28,20032092,Mallory,"Matt's place is in a great neighborhood and within walking distance of plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. It is perfect for a small party, but I wouldn't recommend more than 3-4 people maximum. Also, low ceilings, so if you are over six feet, it may be uncomfortable. Matt was very friendly and inviting. The place was clean and minimalist and great deal for the price. Only about a 10-15 minute drive to Seattle depending on traffic."
3739681,19416172,2014-09-12,19221461,Sandra,"L’appartement est agréable et calme. Il possède un petit jardin privatif. La maison est située dans un quartier résidentiel très tranquille, à une rue de la 45eme avenue ou se trouve un super marché ouvert 24h/24h, et de nombreux restaurants. Le centre-ville de Seattle est atteignable en 20 minutes par bus direct (N°16) dont l’arrêt se trouve également sur la 45eme.
L’hôte, Matthew, est très agréable et discret. Il nous a donné de nombreux conseils sur la région et les activités. 
"
3739681,20108192,2014-09-23,20797073,Mia,"My friend and I flew in for a half marathon but wanted to be able to get a good feeling for the city since it was my first time in Seattle. Matt's place in Wallingford was perfect for many reasons:
1) House and neighborhood was quiet and charming
2) Right around the corner from the town center. Has amazing, coffee, restaurants, shopping, and a couple of fun bars. Wallingford is a laid back, easygoing community, cool community. Loved it!
3) Running distance from Green Lake where we did our shake out run. Beautiful!
4) 5 to 15min drive to other areas: University, Ballard, Queen Anne, Downtown.
5) The basement apartment was exactly what we needed. Super clean and spacious enough for 4 people.
6) Matt is a great host. Gave us pointers on the area and available for questions and requests although we didn't have too many because we had everything we needed from the get go.

Would stay here again at the drop of a hat. Thanks Matt!
"
3739681,21788880,2014-10-24,21335442,Sara,"Matthew was an excellent host. He is an energetic, nice and respectful person. We felt very confortable living close to him. He helped my family and I as much as he could by sharing places to go, allowing us to invite people, giving us a parking card. He is a very flexible person who tried to communicate and understand my family, who don't speak English. I completely recomend it!"
3739681,22676999,2014-11-11,23224496,Margot,"This was our first airbnb experience and it could not have been better.  The apartment was exactly as described and met our expectations.  It was very clean, well-equipped, and comfortable.  While it is a basement apartment, the many windows and light paint make it seem like a first-floor.  We loved it!
Matt was very accommodating, helpful, quick to respond to questions, and very hospitable.  He even provided a parking permit so we did not have to struggle with parking.
Thank you, Matt!"
3739681,28051879,2015-03-16,25697590,Channalyn,"It was a last minute trip to Seattle and it wouldn't be possible if Matt wasn't so flexible to accept my request. When we arrived, Matt greeted us and showed us the space. The place was exactly as posted. The beds are so comfortable - we wanted to lay in it all day. He also offered his bikes for us incase we wanted to go riding and gave recommendations to all his favorite restaurants. The neighborhood is amazing! Close to all public transits and also to QFC and many delicious restaurants and beautiful parks. I would definitely recommend this place!"

3739681,41733040,2015-08-09,30299348,Silas,"Matthew was more than accommodating. We made a reservation months in advance, and everything went smoothly, from check-in to check-out. His place was easy to find, and all the little things like ensuring we had a guest parking permit to park on the street were taken care of."
3739681,54714505,2015-11-23,1813029,Matt,Matt was an amazing host! He graciously met us a couple days before our long term (one month) stay in his basement apartment so we could see the space and give us a run down. During our stay he stayed in great contact about any and everything. We loved getting the chance to get to know him a little better a couple times over drinks. The apartment was perfect for what we needed and in an amazing location right off of the lively 45th St. corridor with plenty of great establishments and bus lines to different neighborhoods and downtown. Overall a fantastic experience!
9508386,57917894,2015-12-30,50001183,Bob,Home was clean and comfortable. Host did a great job with communication and info book. The welcome gift was very appreciated.
7245692,44739342,2015-08-28,27810044,Nana,"We decide our stay in Magdalena's house in a hurry, but this is definitely a very comfortable and convenient place for us to stay in Seattle.

We arrived on 7 pm and Magdalena welcomed us with a soooo amazing bed and a lovely private room. There is a private bathroom for us to use, and Magdalena also let us use her laundry to wash our clothes. There is place for us to parking our car, and this is pretty good in Seattle, for we do not need to wake up in the morning at 8 am to park our car in the street. There is also a lovely garden for you to enjoy your time in Seattle.

Magdalena is so nice! I left my things in the room and Magdalena is so nice to remind me. She also gave us some good advice on the interesting places to go in Seattle. 

And the location is perfect too. It locates just 7 mins to drive to University of Washington. And the neighbourhood is lovely too.

Definitely will come back again if we visit Seattle the second time."
7245692,45194586,2015-08-31,8352114,Amanda,"Magdalena's house was just the get away we needed. The room is quickly accessible from the front door, with a private bathroom and parking out back - which makes it easy to come and go without feeling intrusive. Both her and her cute cat Gideon were very welcoming, and she even gave us some of the best tips for sight-seeing around the city. 

We had no trouble getting downtown as the 66 bus line is just a couple blocks away. We also had a lot of fun exploring the university  district, and some new food places we wouldn't have ordinarily found. The bed was comfy with super soft sheets, and the towels were big and soft too. She's terrific, the house is great, and we'll definitely be looking to come back each time we visit henceforth!"
7245692,45865243,2015-09-06,42526893,Jake,"We were greeted by a family member as the host was out of town. The room and home was clean and organized, the bed spft and comfortable. The home's location was within walking distance of the University of Washington as well as conveniently close to bus trnasportation downtown. Magdalena was prompt to reply to any concerns. 
"
7245692,46035966,2015-09-07,17575526,Sean,This is a great place in a great location! Magdalena was a fantastic host! I highly recommend this listing!
7245692,50930953,2015-10-16,42237549,Paige,"Magdalena graciously welcomed my husband and me into her home for a month while we were looking for a job and apartment in Seattle. She actively helped us have a comfortable experience, from providing new linens, sharing treats in her kitchen, and opening up her fascinating book shelves to us. 

We have two cars and had no trouble parking for the entire month. We also appreciated the spacious, private en suite room with lots of storage.

 Magdalena herself was very kind and interesting - a great source of conversation and inside information about Seattle. We are glad we made the decision to stay with her - plus, the location can't be beat. "
817115,3092729,2012-12-15,4249452,Anne,"This special little getaway is exactly as described: cozy and warm with a sweet artsy touch. Heated up very quickly and stayed warm during a cold week. Well-cared for and very clean, with a very comfortable bed. Perfect for world travelers who value a bright, inviting, unique experience. Outstanding price. Kevin &  Monica are excellent hosts, responsive and responsible and kind. It's great to see a historic design put to good use! Would definitely stay again."
817115,3121317,2012-12-19,4383750,Stuart,"We had a fantastic stay at the Airstream. Since we visited Seattle in the middle of winter, we were concerned about warmth, but the furnace really kicks out heat, the little hot water heater is a workhorse, and the comforter on the bed is amazing. We had no problems with heat, but we were glad that we brought house slippers.

There are 4 cafes, a handful of restaurants, a couple of convenience stores, and a fun little neighborhood tavern in walking distance. Quick bus trip downtown. Kevin and Monica were always responsive to our needs.

Thanks guys,
Stuart, Rachel, Violet, and Lil!"
817115,5617748,2013-07-08,6946638,Susana,My brother and I stayed in the Airstream on our road trip up the PNW and it was great! I was excited to stay in such a classic. You guys did a good job fixing  and putting this thing to good use. Kevin and Monica were great and responsive to our needs. We would stay with them again if ever in Seattle!
817115,5812040,2013-07-17,6987673,Christi,"The Airstream was just as described! We were very comfortable in the unit. Kevin and Monica were great hosts - quick to help us out with questions, etc. It certainly was nice to have our own space during our visit, and the neighborhood was great! Everything we needed was super close."
817115,5857971,2013-07-19,2374860,"Alex, Stephenie & Danny","Communication and hospitality with Kevin and Monica is superb. Even better is their awesome Airstream. This unique spot to stay is humble, self-sufficient and great for travelers looking for a different  more adventurous living space. To make everything better is it's accessibility via public transit!  I'm grateful for the opportunity to have stayed there and would recommend it to the rest of the Airbnb community. "
817115,5921093,2013-07-22,4095331,Mon,"We had a fantastic stay at the airstream.  The place is exactly as described, clean, cozy, in a great neighborhood, and with wonderful welcoming hosts.  There was 3 of us (2 adults and a lively 2 year old) and we found the 170 square feet absolutely adequate and very thoughtfully appointed.  If you're looking for an alternative experience in Seattle, don't hesitate & book it!  "
817115,6045331,2013-07-28,1288434,Jessi,"Great alternative option for a fun place to stay.  Just as described. It was only me but I imagine it could be tight quarters if you aren't very close to your travel mates.  Kevin was super responsive to emails and very hands off yet available if I had needed him.  His great walk through of the RV at arrival covered all I needed to know. The one thing I should mention is their young kiddo was up at 7:30 playing outside which woke me up.  It allowed me to get moving and enjoy the beautiful Seattle weather but if you want to sleep, in shutting the windows would be a good idea.  Would definitely stay again!"
817115,6115481,2013-07-30,6017182,China,"Both Kevin & Monica were excellent hosts.  They were extremely personable (with amazing stories)!  They went out of their way to make sure we had a pleasant stay & were very flexible, especially since we were flying into Seattle at an odd hour.  It was a blast staying in the airstream.  I would recommend it anytime!"
817115,6189828,2013-08-03,5382142,Jessi,This airstream is very quaint.  We had a very comfortable stay.  The area of town was convenient to everything we needed to get to.  Kevin and Monica made sure we had everything we needed and made our stay enjoyable.
817115,6249994,2013-08-05,7274408,Cindy,"The airstream was cozy, clean, and very close to my son's house. Monica and Kevin made it possible for me to arrive late without any problems. Great coffee and crepes around the corner. The air mattress was big enough and comfortable for my teenager. Thanks for the great weekend! I was close to family, while having a place of my own."
817115,6325252,2013-08-08,7230451,Stuart,"Kevin and Monica were fantastic hosts to us, and the airstream couldn't have been more perfect. Despite being so (conveniently) close to the I-5, the backyard is nearly silent at night and we found the bed quite comfortable. Kevin was very helpful and responsive to our needs, and gave great advice on places to eat, cycling routes, and places to check out around the city. Monica was warm and cheery, even surprising us with breakfast tacos one morning! It's a super relaxing and unique place to stay and made our trip so much more memorable.

A few specifics:
-The bathroom and shower are tiny (it is a trailer, after all) but both work perfectly and we had no problems using either.
-The stove works well! Apparently we were the first people to cook full meals in the trailer, and I'm glad we did! Just make sure you flip the ceiling fan to ""out"" and open a window in order to ventilate.
-Internet connection is fast and reliable.
-Between the two of us having showers, cooking meals and washing up, as well as general use, the water tank usually ran out late in the evening. It is super easy to fill, however, and Kevin makes sure it is topped up every morning. Most people probably won't use the whole tank in a day.
-Lastly, if you are a light sleeper who likes to sleep in late you may be woken up by their young child playing in the yard for a while each morning. This didn't bother us in the least, but for those late risers who are disturbed easily by noises this may be something to keep in mind.

All in all, it was a wonderful place to stay that was comfy, relaxing, and unique. We look forward to staying again!"
817115,6488623,2013-08-14,5900558,Becky,"We had a great time at the Artsy Airstream! This was a comfortable, fun, and economical option for our stay in Seattle. Kevin and Monica were so welcoming, from greeting us with PBR & a map of the area, to helping us make change for the bus and recommending a local park, to ensuring we had basics like wi-fi and a full water tank. The bathroom and shower are what you expect in an RV, but totally clean, functional, and sufficient. The bed was sooooo comfy!

We did not have a car for our visit to Seattle. Public transportation is extremely accessible from the airstream (one bus stop half a block away; about four more within the surrounding 3-5 block radius) and the buses run practically all the time. However, it does just take awhile to get anywhere, and it's not really practical to come and go during the day, if you're spending time in the city center. We basically only slept in the Airstream. 

If the location is right for you, would absolutely recommend it!"
817115,6532469,2013-08-16,6396441,Maggie,"Staying with Kevin Monica was great! Their trailer was like home for us campers. The bed was comfortable, space was clean and the location great. Just half a block from bus stop down town and a four block walk to yummy neighborhood treasures.

Kevin and Monica were very welcoming and helpful. A great stay while exploring beautiful Seattle."
817115,6598326,2013-08-18,3250071,Karina,"I enjoyed my stay at the Artsy Airstream Retreat. The location is convenient, there are buses nearby and Kevin & Monica drew me a map with cool places for food & coffee within a 10-minute walk. The Airstream is private and has everything one needs in a well-designed compact space. The bed is comfortable and I slept really well the two nights I was there. Kevin & Monica were very accommodating when my arrival hours changed, and they communicate fast. This was a great and unique experience. "
817115,6681444,2013-08-21,4961606,Twila,What a cute spot they have carved out in maple leaf neighborhood.  Airstream was clean and nicely appointed.  I would definitely stay again.
817115,6748347,2013-08-23,7199702,Poppy,"Our stay here was wonderful! The Airstream was clean and cozy. We now also get to tell people that we stayed in an Airstream. The hosts, Kevin and Monica, were communicative and kind. They provided us with a great little map of the neighborhood and pointed us in the direction of a delicious fish and chips place nearby. Thanks again, guys! "
817115,6891039,2013-08-29,6770150,Ariel,"The artsy Airstream is a snug and lovely place from which to explore Seattle. It's as conveniently located as everyone says and parking was pretty easy even late at night. We used it for a week as a home base for family activities and it was the perfect nest to come back to. 

It's definitely an airstream trailer. Prepare to be close with whomever you are staying with. We found it fine for two adults. One note is that the shower is small - as a stocky 5'11"" it was tight. My smaller partner had no problems. We really appreciated the kitchenette and used it to make our breakfasts and snacks. Also note that the trailer is in a backyard, again as others say - it's respectfully shared space, but definitely not private.

 Kevin and Monica were great hosts and very welcoming. The airstream is clearly a love project and they've worked hard to maintain it. It was clean and tidy and we'll definitely stay again."
817115,7012102,2013-09-03,5445660,Michelle,We loved our stay in the artsy airstream. Everything was exactly what we expected based on the pictures and other reviews. The airstream was surprisingly spacious and very clean. The hosts were very helpful and communicative from the start. The location is perfect. It's a short drive to downtown and there are many cool places to check out within walking distance. The neighborhood was extremely charming and seemed very safe. I would definitely stay again!
817115,7246819,2013-09-13,7700195,Angela,We LOVED the artsy airstream!!!!! Kevin and Monica were great hosts an helped us with anything we needed. It was very easy to get on the public transit and get into the city. Even for these Indiana girls who are used to driving themselves! Thank you for your hospitality and hopefully we'll see you again sometime!
817115,7389624,2013-09-18,5657601,Sascha,We had a great stay at the airstream! It was really cozy and an interesting experience to sleep inside such a classic trailer. It had everything we needed and everything was clean and in great condition. Both Kevin and Monica were really helpful when we needed something and we always felt at home. We can definitely recommend it and would love to stay there again the next time we are in Seattle! :-)
817115,7446918,2013-09-20,8792178,Randy,"Exactly as described in posting.  Very cozy, convenient and perfect location for my brief trip to visit friends.   
My only complaints, and these are just personal, is that it is located on a very busy street and the fact that is located in Kevin and Monica's backyard.  
Other than those, perfect for what I was looking for.

Randy"
817115,7486210,2013-09-22,7038755,Craig And Maureen,Kevin was very helpful is getting us set up.  Parking was easy and we enjoyed our morning walks to the coffee shops.  The neighborhood is quiet and the Airstream was cozy like camping.  The bed is very comfortable.
817115,7602544,2013-09-26,2227806,Emma,"We loved our stay in the airstream. Clever use of space meant we didn't feel at all cramped and little touches, like the fairy lights outside, iPod dock and plenty of lamps and mirrors made a comfortable stay. Heating is great and kept us cosy in some damp weather and surprised the rain wasn't loud on the roof like in some other caravans I've stayed in. Recommend taking the bus into Seattle as is way cheaper than cabs though getting one for around $25 from the centre was useful for our late night arrival with luggage. Great hosts, kept to themselves except when we needed help and very friendly too. "
817115,7647375,2013-09-28,8346622,Gretchen,"The Airstream was the perfect place to rent for my daughter and I.  It was very cozy and had everything we would need in it.  Kevin and Monica were very good hosts, even when I locked us out of the Airstream. :)  Their adorable puppy even welcomed us.  My daughter is going to school in Seattle now and I hope to rent the Airstream on future trips.  I'll be in touch for sure!  Thank you both for everything.  Marissa and Gretchen"
817115,7752589,2013-10-01,2688897,Tracy,"The Airstream was very pleasant to stay in during a recent rainy 2 nights in Seattle.  Though there were some minor leaks, it was cozy and comfortable, and I was overjoyed they let my dog stay there too.  It is well-equipped and nicely furnished.  I thoroughly enjoyed my first Airstream experience!  Kevin and Monica were lovely to deal with, and even helped me when my car was towed......beyond the call of duty!   "
817115,7813604,2013-10-04,3833141,Amy,"Staying in the Airstream was fun, and Kevin was very responsive and helpful with any issues i had. "

The inside was well done--more like a microstudio--with all amenities you could ask for. Even though it was cold outside at night, the heater kept us warm. We would definitely stay here again!"
817115,8167305,2013-10-19,813624,Karoliina,"We had a great stay in this cosy airstream. Perfect for a couple, would definitely stay again if we ever have the opportunity to visit Seattle in the future. Thanks Kevin and Monica."

Thank you!!"
817115,8647909,2013-11-10,9652343,Bekah,"This was the most adorable place I've ever stayed! The bathroom is tiny and the shower is made for children, but the water was hot and had good pressure. Overall, the trailer is fun because it is private and cozy. The bed was really comfortable and I stayed plenty warm for my trip in November. Kevin was really accommodating and a great host. I felt right at home in the little trailer and would definitely stay here again, "

817115,8802028,2013-11-18,9895911,Daniel,"An absolutely lovely time, in a charming Airstream. My only regret is that I was too rushed to meet the hosts, who were almost certainly great people. I wholeheartedly recommend staying here."
817115,8844473,2013-11-21,7864590,Christie,"I arrived during a particularly cold spell, and the airstream was just too cold for me. Kevin and Monica were really understanding, though, and refunded me for the remaining nights. I was overall happy with the experience, since they were so reasonable. "

817115,8991602,2013-12-01,2478887,Gene,"The Airstream was very cute and cozy.  Kevin was a very nice host and gave recommendations for nearby restaurants and cafes.  We were there over Thanksgiving and, although it was chilly outside, after cranking up the heat, it got pretty toasty inside.  We had a rental car and parking was pretty easy right outside or across the street.  If you're not driving, though, the location is a bit of a trek from most of the neighborhoods that you'd want to visit.  I can't comment on public transportation options here.

Kevin warned us that the water heater runs out pretty quickly, so don't plan on taking any long showers -- just hop in and out."
817115,12293998,2014-04-28,7556885,Tim,"I didn't sleep here, but I wish I would have! What a cool space! The reason for my rental is for my upcoming feature comedy ((website hidden)). The airstream was perfect for our purposes and I would recommend it to any Seattle travelers who want a unique North End experience. Also Kevin and Monica are really nice and flexible!"
817115,12919682,2014-05-14,13033778,Paul,"The Airstream Retreat was a great way to experience Seattle. Kevin and Monica could not have been more friendly and helpful. Lots of really nice touches, like banana bread and a tea/coffee making 'kit' to help us over jet lag. And staying in the trailer for a week felt like we were on a road trip but without having to actually go anywhere.

Green Lake/Maple Leaf is a great neighbourhood - lots of friendly and easy to access bars and restaurants, as well the Green Lake which, if you like running like me, is first rate. The tips in the guest book for local places is excellent - follow Kevin and Monica's advice and you won't go wrong.

We would thoroughly recommend this place to stay!"
817115,13767185,2014-06-03,15354071,Sven,"We had such a wonderful time in the Artsy Airstream. It's cozy and comfy.

We were on our honeymoon and Kevin and Monica were very helpful in giving us directions and suggestions on where to go in Seattle! The airstream was very comfortable, and we had more than enough space for the two of us. Kevin showed us all the little things we would have not have known otherwise. Overall we had a very good experience and would definitely stay again if given the opportunity! "
817115,14306094,2014-06-16,458004,Launce,"Kevin was very responsive to my initial query and helpful in providing information about nearby resources.  I arrived late and left early, and they were very nice about accommodating this. 

The Airstream itself is fantastic, well kept, cute, totally unique and overall a terrifically fun and cozy place to spend some time.  The bed was comfortable, and the place stayed warm through a rainy night. 

The neighborhood is nice, and easy to get to local stuff, as well as the University and downtown, either with a car or public transportation. 

Many thanks to the hosts of this wonderful little gem. "
817115,14419760,2014-06-18,15388572,Jim,"Stay here!!!! In fact alter the dates of your trip if you have to.  It is THAT cool.  The hosts have paid attention to every detail of the air bnb process and in the restoration of the artsy airstream.  They are friendly and attentive while totally giving guests privacy. Kevin recommended a great neighborhood called ""Ballard"" to hang out in and we loved it.  Your friends will be jealous when they see your pictures.   "
817115,14738466,2014-06-25,4910994,Douglas,"I chose this place in part because it was near people that I was visiting in the area, and I wanted a place of my own to stay.  Cute and cozy Airstream.  Comfortable bed.  Kevin and Monica were gracious and accommodating hosts.  Monica left some wonderful home-made bread for me one morning -- much appreciated!  Overall, a very pleasant experience."

Kevin and Monica were extremely helpful from start to finish with our stay at their fantastic airstream. It's a perfect location and they provided several great places to visit within walking distance of their place. 

I'd absolutely recommend that anyone stay here if you get the chance, you'll always remember it!

hard to say much about our guest since they weren't there.  But they let us everything we needed for our stay in the airstream ( informations,  maps,  advices ) 
about the airstream it was really nice, clean and cosy
Good experience for us :)"
817115,15333571,2014-07-07,16312101,Eileen,"My husband and I had a great time at the artsy airstream! I love all the colorfulness added both inside and out, it's such an adorable area. The airstream had everything we could need including a very helpful guide to the neighborhood, we couldn't have asked for a more peaceful place. Sean and Tebow definitely gave some added charm to our stay, as they weren't shy to come say hi and they're both so cute! Thank you for the wonderful experience, I look forward to the next trip we take and would definitely stay again!"

Monica even offered us some of her delicious self-made chocolate cake. Thanks for that!
We can highly recommend staying at the Airstream in Seattle."
817115,15693595,2014-07-14,8200697,Kat,What a great way to stay in Seattle! This airstream B&B was a unique and comfortable refurbished hideaway which was close enough to downtown but secluded enough to get the quiet camping appeal one would expect in an rv. Highly recommended for a once in a lifetime experience! 
817115,15879090,2014-07-17,6847676,Ashley,"Kevin and Monica weren't in town when we were there, but left a generous amount of information in the form of maps and recommendations. The airstream was clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable - to the point I didn't want to get out of bed some mornings! The location was really great - just a 10-15 minute drive to downtown Seattle. The digs are exactly what you'd expect from a camper/RV - if you are a taller person (like me) you might bump your head a few times. Overall, our stay was perfect for what we needed."
817115,16205577,2014-07-23,15837570,Michael,"Kevin and Monica had a very nice welcome package all laid out for me and my girlfriend when we arrived.  They gave us our space, but were always available  if we had any questions.  At one point the router needed a reset, and Kevin was quick to reset it.  The Airstream itself is very cozy and really has all the modern conveniences.  I was impressed to find a stove and minifridge.  The warm water showers were amazing.  The bed was super comfortable.  It really was an extremely pleasant experience.  If I had to mention one negative it would be that when I left the airstream one morning there was animal waste besides the walkway in their backyard.  But it was cleaned up before I got back, so this is actually kind of a positive. Nice neighborhood and great to weather during the summer."
817115,16376327,2014-07-26,1416377,Katherine,"We had a great stay at the Artsy Airstream! We didn't end up meeting Kevin and Monica, but check-in/out was easy, and we had everything we needed to be comfortable. They were very easy to communicate with prior to our stay. 

Parking nearby was easy, as was getting to public transit. The electric (?) heaters kept us warm on chilly nights. The shower was humorously small, but functional once I got used to it. The bed was comfy. Everything was very clean. It was nice to have a bit of privacy/space. Overall, the airstream was very cute. I would recommend staying here - particularly if you want to try something a little different!"
817115,16472063,2014-07-28,4143338,Jolene,The host was right there when he said he would be and the place was just as it appears.  We loved it !  
817115,16623226,2014-07-30,2253492,Linda,"The Airstream was a great place to stay while in Seattle for a festival. Comfy sleeping, easy to prepare food there and enjoyed the cute enclosed patio area outside. Everything we needed. "
817115,16762949,2014-08-02,4746922,Carl And Barbara,"We stayed three nights in the Artsy Airstream Retreat [AAR] while we visited with family who lived five minutes away. We didn't spend much time in the AAR except to sleep and have breakfast. The weather was hot and dry and the combination of the canopy and A/C did keep it cool enough. We never tried the heat, even though early mornings were a bit chilly. The driveway is steep and, when their cars are in it, a  bit narrow to drag suitcases up. Over the years, we have traveled in campers ranging from a homemade VW bus conversion to a 30 foot Winnebago.
Kevin and Monica have done a great job of tricking out the Airstream so there is ample hot water and lots of light. You have to use a lighter to ignite the stove burners, but they work fine. The fridge is very small. The space is very well used and we kept finding useful implements and interesting books and things as we poked around. The bed is comfortable, though a bit awkward if the inside person has to get up during the night. The shower works fine but is cramped for a tall or large person.
We did find the liability release over the top and off-putting. It may well be unenforceable, and it is clear that Kevin and Monica have done their best to make the trailer safe and comfortable.  I mentioned this to Kevin as we left.  
Once we figured out some routines, we were pretty comfortable and think the AAR is a great value in Seattle."
817115,17158284,2014-08-08,7189470,Elisabeth,The Airstream trailer was just as described. Monica and Kevin were friendly and professional.
817115,17437089,2014-08-12,15765771,Vicky,"We really loved the Artsy Airstream Retreat! It was everything and more that the photos portrayed. Very comfortable - and I loved the lumberjack pillowcases - (you just have to see them for yourself!)

Thanks, Kevin, for a very comfortable stay. We will definitely like to stay again if we are in the area."
817115,17593992,2014-08-14,921140,Meade,"I stayed at the Artsy Air stream while on a work trip to Seattle.  It was perfect for me.  Super cozy and clean.  I wasn't too sure when I would be arriving or leaving because of work, but they were very flexible with checking in and out, which I greatly appreciated.  Kevin showed me around the air stream and made sure I knew where everything was.  The neighborhood was very peaceful and Green Lake was just about a mile away.  I ran around the lake both nights I stayed and it was a beautiful 3 mile loop.  I recommend checking out the lake if you stay here.  Two thumbs up!"
817115,17827616,2014-08-18,15857307,Michelle,"My husband and I loved our stay in the Airstream!  We tended to be out most of the day, sightseeing in Seattle, and most of our time in the Airstream was either in the morning or nighttime.  The bed was very comfy and easy to fold up for more space and unfold when it was time to sleep.  The shower was tiny, but perfect for anyone who regularly uses a shower chair (my husband uses one generally, and it would be tough to stand in the tiny shower, so this worked out perfectly for us).  The neighborhood was pretty calm and quiet, although we weren't around much in the day.  Easy walk to several different bus stops and easy to go to and from where we wanted to go. The only thing I would have liked differently was a little more space to unpack- we stayed here the first 3 days of a larger trip, and so I had more than what I needed for the nights we stayed.  There was a bench we were able to use that did allow for some unpacking.  For someone who is staying only a night or two or just doesn't bring a lot of stuff this is likely not an issue."
817115,18468845,2014-08-27,15466958,Susie Q,"The airstream was nice and cosy, very space efficient and a very comfortable bed. loved being able to listen to my old tapes and cook in the little kitchen. public transport was easily accessible."
817115,18625311,2014-08-29,2239622,Stephen,"Kevin was an excellent host.
The airstream is clean and the bed was very comfortable. Nice neighborhood close up shops. Be prepared for a small shower, it is an Airstream so that comes with the territory. 
 All around a unique and fun experience! 
"
817115,18800106,2014-09-01,2453631,Andy,"The place was great and so was Kevin+Monica's hospitality. This was my 2nd time renting an Airstream this year (the other was in Austin) and both were fun experiences. 

Kevin+Monica have on-demand hot water in theirs, which makes for a much more enjoyable shower (the Airstream's tank seems to be about 2 cups worth of hot water otherwise!)

The place was in great shape and Kevin greeted us and gave us a nice tour. The heaters kept us warm at night (my wife is ALWAYS cold) and we were just fine in the chilly evenings. 

The location is really nice - it's 5-10 mins from so many great restaurants (and many are probably walking distance although we had a car). Quiet neighborhood and close to the freeway - so easy to get downtown, out of town (we headed to Snoqualmie Falls one day) and all around the college and Green Lake areas."
817115,19264821,2014-09-09,17217377,Tonya,"The hosts were great, graciously helped us with the internet connection and an overview of the neighborhood. The airstream was tidy and instructions clear. We enjoyed our stay!"
817115,19675006,2014-09-16,6744790,Paige,"The Artsy Airstream was great and exactly what we were expecting from what we are read in the description prior to booking. Welcoming and comfortable. Perfect for two, three people is doable but would have been too cramped for my liking. The location and neighborhood was really nice. Kevin and Monica provided a good map and list of local places in the neighborhood to check out. We were within walking distance to a nice park/lake area, coffee shops, a great pizza place, and a few local watering holes. The airstream proved to be the perfect home base for our stay in the Seattle area. "
817115,19827438,2014-09-19,16953899,Sarah,"Kevin and Monica were great hosts, and were very responsive to all our questions. They were also very gracious and accommodating with a couple of shifting schedule needs that came up. The location was perfect for catching transport to other parts of the city. The space itself is cozy, fun and  has everything you need - plus it's way cool to get to stay in a vintage Airstream! A unique retreat that I would surely recommend to others traveling to Seattle."
817115,20151515,2014-09-24,20481661,Magali,"Kevin and Monica's AirStream totally fits to our needs : a separate entrance, for coming back late without disturbing the guests, and a very comfortable bed, perfect for recovering after a day of hiking !
The shower has also been well-reasonned by Kevin and Monica, with an extra stool inside to wash yourself without getting back pain (low ceiling). The interior was clean and we enjoyed the small supply of coffee, that helped us out the last morning, when our own package proved empty.
Many journals about Seattle and surroundings are made available, as well as some classic board games. There is also a very fun ""hand-made"" map by Kevin and Monica on shops and restaurants nearby. The ""sound-sytem"" by radio-cassette is very original, although we have not tested ! WiFi also worked well.
The overall atmosphere is very cozy, with the small sofa and cushions... In short, a nice cozy little nest inside, and outside very comfortable with the small garden table, the candles, the fairy lights, and the paintings hung on the fence ! All in all, a very pleasant stay!"
817115,20270841,2014-09-26,3125522,Sean,"Kevin and Monica's Airstream was unique, comfy, clean, and everything we'd hoped it would be! We will most definitely be looking them up the next time we find ourselves in Seattle. Can't say enough great things about our stay!"
817115,20346328,2014-09-28,14803596,Domenica,"I got in at 7 pm couldn't really find the house, but once I got there Kevin was really helpful.
I wasn't really there (in an out) but when I was it was nice :) the shower is pretty small so that was a surprise (you have to sit to take a shower). All in all a good experience, LOVED the coffee Kevin suggested ( only 3 blks away)."
817115,21034542,2014-10-10,14945730,Amber,"When we first arrived Monica and Shawn were there to greet us and make us feel welcome. A couple days later we met Kevin who asked us how the stay was going, and if we were comfortable. Everyone was so welcoming and friendly.
 I immediately loved the area and the adorable artsy airstream. The area worked out perfect for us to get around by bus, and the airstream was cozy, warm and well decorated. We would definitely stay there again! "
817115,21221322,2014-10-13,10546341,Joshua,"This place is in a great neighborhood, Maple Leaf, midway between Northgate Mall and Green Lake.  Lots of little places to go, great bike riding (bikes supplied), easy access to city or to the Sound.  Kevin and Monica couldn't make me feel more welcome, lot of fun to stay here, can't wait to return.  Hit the grocery store, there's a small kitchen, great savings for do it yourselfers.  Easy to find, right off I-5 between NE 1st Av and NE 5th Av."
817115,21629523,2014-10-20,21598853,Holly,"Kevin and Monica were quick to respond to my reservation, and the instructions were very straightforward. The trailer is cozy, but not cramped, and the bed is extremely comfortable.  The trailer is outfitted with linens, coffee and basic kitchen condiments.

I had a car, and found the neighborhood to be conveniently located. My only suggestion - the address is difficult to find after dark (on a street with minimal lighting), it would be useful to have a light/address visible from the street. 

All in all, a great place to use as a home base while in Seattle. Highly recommended!"
817115,21860525,2014-10-25,3336306,Scott,Loved the airstream! Totally unique retro space and great fun to stay in. The bed was super comfortable and the built-in tape deck was awesome. A perfect launching pad for a stay in Seattle. Kevin and Monica were great hosts - highly recommended! 
817115,22194415,2014-11-01,15057788,Kalinda,The airstream was great! Monica and Kevin left great suggestions of places to see and things to do. The bed was very comfortable. The inside is cozy and adorable. Loved the cassette tapes you could play as well :)
817115,22449950,2014-11-06,23124217,Eric,"Kevin and Monica's ""Artsy Airstream"" is lovely and surprisingly spacious, tucked in its own special nook they have constructed for their guests' privacy. The space was immaculately clean, and very comfy. Kevin, with whom I generally communicated, was extremely attentive and extraordinarily quick with all his responses. In short, both the hosts and the space were perfect!"
817115,22944875,2014-11-18,20792608,Gildas,"Une très bonne adresse !! Très facile d'accès depuis l'aéroport, a 30 minutes du centre ville en bus. Le quartier es calme, a proximité du parc de Green Lake, et les hôtes sont disponible et discret ! Je le recommande vivement a tout veux qui souhaite visiter Seattle en ayant un petit coin de paix ! 
L airstream est chaud et étonnement spacieux, très bien agencer avec tout ce qui es nécessaire !
Merci Kevin et Monica !! ( et oui c est en français, haha !!)"
817115,23219292,2014-11-25,22822321,Jin Wei,"The room is so beautiful, and Kevin is very nice. I love the room so much that nearly want to take it to home. I think everyone will have a very nice trip when u choose to live here."
817115,23363535,2014-11-30,3451798,Momoko,"Such a cute little Airstream! If you've ever wanted to stay in one of these, definitely give it a try. Kevin and Monica made sure the place was spic and span prior to us arriving. 

The only caveat for us was the unseasonably cold weather - Kevin and Monica warned us well ahead of time that it'd be the trailer's first official run in winter, and made sure the heaters were on full blast and the place was toasty prior to our arrival. So we were warm and cozy the whole night through, but the pipes unfortunately had frozen when we woke up then next morning. 

In general, lovely! Couldn't imagine more darling, retro accommodations for spring/summer/fall. Winter? Def doable, but you may want to opt for a house if it looks like the temp is going to drop well below zero. 
"
817115,23663352,2014-12-07,24346668,Josh,The airstream worked out fantastic for the weekend! It was cozy and in a nice quiet neighborhood. I would definitely book again if I return to seattle
817115,23996961,2014-12-16,23314341,Laura,"The Airstream trailer was just as described by Kevin and Monica.  It is definitely small, but we found it comfortable (my partner is 6'2"" and neither of us are slender).  The floor was chilly, but the trailer was otherwise cozy and warm.  The bed was comfy, and the kitchen was fully usable.  The shower is small, although it is set up for sitting in, and the water pressure is (not surprisingly) low.  Don't plan on washing your long, thick hair :-)  

We didn't see much of Kevin and Monica, but they offered us a friendly welcome and I would have felt comfortable contacting them if we had needed anything.  

We would definitely stay again if we had business in Seattle"
817115,24094028,2014-12-19,24807970,Ellen,"What a cozy little retreat!  The bed is super comfortable.  It rained most of the two nights that I stayed in the Airstream and I did not want to leave this great little nest!  The heaters definitely kept the chill away and Kevin was kind enough to remind me to bring thick socks or slippers - the floor is cold on bare feet!  I would recommend this  retreat to anybody wanting a small, convenient, and perfectly priced place to stay in the Seattle area."
817115,24151072,2014-12-21,18007624,Barbara,I have always been curious about Airstreams so staying in Kevin & Monica's made a weekend stay in Seattle an affordable adventure. I'm tall so I was worried about showering in the tiny stall but they have outfitted it with a stool to sit on so it was perfectly fine. The bed was very comfortable for two large adults and cozy!
817115,24337620,2014-12-26,2330676,Sally,"Thank you Kevin and Monica for an enjoyable trip to Seattle.  Your airstream was cozy and warm and perfect for my first Christmas in Seattle with my daughter.  Everything worked as the instructions said, great queen size bed was perfect, and the heaters kept the place nice a warm!  Will be happy to visit again next time I'm visiting my daughter."
817115,24445390,2014-12-28,14892992,Sophia,"A unique experience! The airsteam was small but cozy with the electric heaters. If you're looking for a rustic yet still urban experience, this is the place. The location was about a 10-15 minute walk away from a central bus hub, which would then take you easily downtown. We never got the chance to meet Kevin and Monica, but they were very easy to communicate with through e-mail and text, and tried their best to accommodate us."
817115,25369400,2015-01-13,11429036,Brooke,"Kevin & Monica left thorough instructions for everything in the Airstream and seemed very approachable if I had questions. The space is comfortable, private and clean, and the heaters are very effective. The shower is a bit challenging to use--you have to use the stool or stoop over. The location is close to shops and restaurants in Maple Leaf, and walkable to Greenlake. Overall a very good deal and a fun experience. "
817115,25509267,2015-01-18,25343107,Lynn,"Our Airstream stay was great.  We had everything we needed, including coffee. Kevin and Monica left a packet of info about Seattle and their neighborhood  which was extremely helpful.  The Airstream was clean, comfortable, and warm.  The location was great, public transportation was close by and easily accessible.  I would definitely stay here again.
 "
817115,25736263,2015-01-25,21332042,Jo,"The Airstream is very charming. The hosts seems to have thought of everything including nearby restaurant information, bus information and local attractions. I enjoyed not having a television and having a radio instead. My favorite Seattle station, KEXP, came in loud and clear. The hosts left shampoo and soap. There is a full kitchen with all of the needed utensils. My only possible advice to future visitors is that you should bring a small hairdryer if you have long hair. The neighborhood was very nice and safe. I was alone and did not feel uncomfortable at any point during the stay or when catching the bus downtown early in the am.

If you dislike hotels and prefer hostels or vintage hotels, this is the perfect place for you too. It is a very charming and comfortable place to stay in Seattle."
817115,25905706,2015-01-29,14624845,New,We loved our stay in the Airstream. We had all the privacy we could have asked for. During our stay we didn't have any questions or need anything special but we knew that our hosts were close by and could be easily contacted in case we had a request. The neighborhood was great for being able to check out different parts of Seattle by car. 
817115,26032957,2015-02-01,8368522,Sarah,"Loved the Artsy Airstream! It gave me the solitude I was looking for and had all the amenities I required! The Airstream is fun and artsy, but also tiny and sweetly rustic. Plenty of heat and hot water for a nice long shower after a long day. I would absolutely stay there again! Thank you!"
817115,26192379,2015-02-06,602636,Christina,"Kevin and Monica's airstream retreat was super cute and just like described - cozy, convenient and perfect for a unique stay in Seattle! The neighborhood was very nice - it was great to stay in a part of Seattle that I probably would not have visited otherwise, and though it rained a lot during my stay, I had no problem walking to where I need to go, getting around and checking out the neighborhood per their recommendations as well as others. Thanks again, Monica and Kevin!"
817115,26271711,2015-02-08,26769031,Dan,"The Airstream was full of charming details. It was clean, smelled fine, and the bed in particular was more comfortable than we even dared to hope. There were useful books, maps, and brochures. Kevin, Monica, Sean, and Tebow were nice, and went out of their way to accommodate us in the first place. We didn't see a lot of each other, but it was fine. Recommended!"
817115,26548114,2015-02-15,25199431,Lisa,"The airstream was such a unique and cozy experience! Monica and Kevin did a great job refurbishing and decorating this mini-home. Although we didn't see our hosts often, they gave us ample privacy and autonomy... We appreciated that! "
817115,26819784,2015-02-20,24305701,Meg,"This b&b was a great escape after a long day in the hustle and bustle of Seattle. Great location and very quiet. For a small space, we were able to comfortably fit 3 people very well. Kevin and Monica provided us with plenty of blankets and utilities to make our stay as pleasant as possible. They also were kind enough to leave the lights on and airstream open for our very late arrival. We didn't get a chance to personally meet them, but our stay in Seattle couldn't have been better!"
817115,26943858,2015-02-22,27375274,Shana,"Adorable fixed up Airstream trailer in the Mapleleaf neighborhood. Not much to do within walking distance but centrally located and only about 15-20 minutes from Ballard/Fremont or Belltown. Comfortable bedding and included everything you needed to make a quick snack (we didn't try to use the burners).  Lovely place to stay at a very affordable price.  The only slight downside is that their adorable son gets up pretty early (for vacationers) and likes to play outside, loudly.  I thought it was part of the charm of staying in/near someone's home, but could be a bit much for those who are really trying to get away from it all (or like to stay out super late).  We would absolutely stay here again for our next trip to Seattle."
817115,27341277,2015-03-02,20495841,Shannon,"We had a great time in the Airstream! We were in Seattle visiting the city because we are considering moving there and the airstream was so cute and a great atmosphere for our trip of exploration! Kevin and Monica were great hosts even though we didn't get a chance to spend much time with them. They provided some great restaurant recommendations and other information about the surrounding areas in the neighborhood. We had everything we needed in the airstream, it was warm and cozy and perfect for the two of us. We would definitely love to stay again when we come back to visit Seattle again!"
817115,28162375,2015-03-19,4646353,Chris,"Cozy, bright, and had everything we needed.  We had a blast riding the bus and biking around the city.  "
817115,28645890,2015-03-28,2179644,Hannah,"Kevin and Monica's space was great for our stay in Seattle. We utilized the kitchen a lot, which was awesome because we went clamming while in Seattle. We had a car but noticed the bus stop was very close by. 

Kevin and Monica were super easy to get in contact with.

I felt safe taking walks in the neighborhood, both at night and day. We would love to stay here again when back in town."
817115,28975268,2015-04-01,26876087,Ken,"The neighborhood traffic is fairly quiet at night. I liked the location which is close to the mall, the community college, green lake, and downtown. The airstream was funky and seemed adequate with the basics of a place to eat and sleep. "
817115,30704762,2015-04-26,20613361,Ben,"Kevin and Monica were out of town during my visit, but that was no problem because of complete and accurate communication. The Airstream  served my needs as a basic place to stay during my weekend in Seattle. It isn't fancy and it's old, but it's clean and serviceable. The ceiling's too low in the shower for me to fully stand up, but I found it useable. The location is great for access to the Green Lake area and to the Aikido dojo where I trained. It's on a somewhat busy street, so there was some car noise, but not a lot, and there's beautiful walking on quieter streets nearby. "
817115,31586165,2015-05-07,30239783,John,"A lovely little trailer in a peaceful neighborhood, Kevin and Monica were hospitable yet non intrusive.  The trailer itself was exactly what we were looking for, complete with a tape deck (!!!) and some tapes to listen to, including one of my faves Paul Simon.  Would highly recommend to anyone visiting Seattle, easy access to downtown yet far enough removed with plenty of privacy.    "
817115,31756041,2015-05-09,23116126,April,"Kevin was very kind and helpful, thank you Kevin!"
817115,32026899,2015-05-12,17928953,Dave,"Had a great stay in the Airstream.  Kevin was a generous host and provided me with some great sightseeing spots around the city.  Even let me borrow a bike to cruise around in.  The cabin was clean and provided privacy and comfort.  If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle that's centrally located to the popular attractions, this is it."
817115,32068321,2015-05-13,26370126,Melissa,We felt welcome and the neighborhood was lovely.
817115,32280382,2015-05-16,22766529,Kevin,"Airstream was ready and cleaned when I arrived.  No hassle check in!  This was my first stay in an Airstream, and I had a very pleasant experience.  Hot water with privacy, clean and comfortable sleeping quarters.  Met host shortly and was very welcoming.  I would I highly recommend.  "
817115,32684712,2015-05-20,14482168,Jaci,"The Artsy Airstream was exactly what we needed for our trip. It was small and cozy, but more importantly, it was super close to the local bus stops which allowed for my best friend and I to get to see as much as possible in the few days we were in Seattle! Kevin and Monica were great in providing us with the information that we needed and although their son played in the backyards in the morning, it was fun to hear the laughter of a child. (And was extra incentive to get going on our daily excursions). I would most definitely stay there agin if I was ever back in the area!! Thanks Kevin and Monica!!!"
817115,33067037,2015-05-25,11271527,Florent,"Très bon séjour dans cette Airstream, elle est très bien aménagée et il y a tout ce qu'il faut pour passer un agréable séjour.."
817115,45652259,2015-09-05,30153895,Simon,The Airstream is a really unique place. We loved it! Everything worked well and we had a great time staying there. Access to downtown is pretty and inexpensive as well.
817115,46011488,2015-09-07,32964735,Rebecca,"Kevin and Monica gave good detail on what to expect and where to go. The bed was comfortable. I wasn't expecting that and I was pleasantly surprised. The shower was a bit of a challenge, size wise, but not a hindrance. The neighborhood is nice with a lovely coffee place on Roosevelt. Just a few blocks away. ( The Blue Saucer ) "
817115,46385760,2015-09-10,20489471,Marilyn,"The airstream was so quaint and Kevin and Monica were such nice hosts! If you need a place to stay in Seattle that's centrally located this is your spot, we had no problems navigating our way through the public transit system from the airstream. The bus stop was usually down the street! The fact that you get to stay in such a unique spot is just a bonus :)"
817115,46838670,2015-09-13,38196063,Akua,"We had a great time in the cute and cozy airstream. There was enough space for the two of us and the bed was very comfortable. The books and tour guides were helpful and the coffee and tea an appreciated touch. The shower was also nice and hot :)The neighborhood is cute, convenient and has good parking. It was a delightful experience. Thx"
817115,48508955,2015-09-27,23817839,Ko Hsuan,This airbnb was actually bigger than i thought. It was very cozy and nice and close to UW. The hosts were really friendly and helpful. Recommended! 
817115,49896283,2015-10-07,28009331,Jenn,"Kevin and Monica have a lovely airstream and it is the perfect way to experience Seattle while staying an easy bus ride away from the heart of the city.  The airstream was very tidy on my arrival.  Monica and Kevin were welcoming and accessible, while allowing me my privacy, as I was using the trip in part as a writing retreat.  The shower is small, which was ok for me, as I am only 5'3"", but would require some adjusting to for someone larger.  The kitchen was perfect for an extended stay, of 9 days.  The airstream has a bit of an antiquish smell to it, but it is indeed a concerted, authentic, airstream, so it is to be expected.  I would recommend for anyone wanting a peaceful stay in Seattle to check out Kevin and Monica's artsy retreat!"
817115,51130580,2015-10-18,16500297,Matt,"Kevin and Monica are awesome, and the airstream is just as described. Private fence around it with a nice sitting area outside. Very comfortable bed! Great proximity to jump on I5 and get downtown if you have a car. Yes, it is still an airstream so it's tighter than a hotel room, but its also hundreds of dollars cheaper than a hotel. Would stay again in a heartbeat! "
817115,52966203,2015-11-03,19881148,Tina,Monica and Kevin's Airstream is a really nice place to stay in Seattle. The neighbourhood is friendly and parking on the street is absolutely no problem. Also the public transfer is only a few minutes walk away. Even in the colder days the Airstream is totally cozy and you don't miss a thing. We really enjoyed playing the old music tapes! Monica and Kevin were great hosts and always available for questions and recommodations.
817115,53169697,2015-11-06,36981893,Lizzie,It was a terrific choice we made to stay at the Artsy Airstream. It is like having your own home right there in Seattle. Everything you need is there and Kevin and Monica have it set up so you are independent and welcomed. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for accommodations in Seattle.
817115,53384746,2015-11-08,44039870,Hannah,"I really enjoyed staying int the funky yet practical airstream.  The bed was super comfortable, the heaters were great, and I loved how close it was to UW.  I'd stay there again in a heartbeat.  You can't beat the price!!  The hosts were wonderful and made me feel welcome.  The one drawback was that the internet wifi did not have enough signal to extend to the airstream but I'm sure that they will fix that.

Hannah"
817115,53629029,2015-11-10,36981893,Lizzie,We returned to the Airstream after a 3 day trip and it was just as wonderful as when we left it. We'll be back!
817115,53892324,2015-11-14,46239606,Marjorie,"We had no problem corresponding in advance with Kevin and Monica in advance, and everything was ready for us upon arrival, as described. We stayed for a few days and took transit or Uber into the city each day. "
817115,54250543,2015-11-17,7070652,Stephanie,"This quaint 60s Airstream trailer is in a quiet neighborhood, with easy access to shopping, the freeway, the University of Washington, Green Lake, and other local amenities--including the nearby Cloud Nine coffeehouse. The weather in Seattle during our November trip was HORRIBLE (cold and rainy, cold, rainy), but we were warm and snug in the Airstream. If you want a more bohemian or unusual airbnb experience than the standard studio or guest bedroom, I highly recommend this experience, especially for the price. It is ""cozy"" for two people, but fun. The shower is hobbit-sized but completely functional and the water was hot. The bed is great! "
817115,54650416,2015-11-22,18595717,Nikko,"I'm really glad that I booked Kevin and Monica's airstream. Their instructions were very easy to follow, and the unit had everything I needed: a stove top, water heater, heating, wifi (spotty for phones, but my computer worked perfectly fine).

Easy access to I-5, and the drive to downtown took no more than 12 minutes for me. 
"
817115,55809884,2015-12-06,1338990,Lisa,Listing as advertised -- an artsy airstream. Nothing fancy but fit my expectations exactly. It was cozy and fun for the kids and added another chapter to my adventures on Airbnb. 
817115,56598912,2015-12-15,25131893,Carolann,"We arrived late to the Airstream on the first day of our trip, but Kevin and Monica were wonderful and had everything ready for us. It was a perfect stay and it was great to have a comfortable bed to sleep on at the end of a long day of walking. Thank you!"
817115,56925958,2015-12-20,15386950,Seth,"Staying at Monica and Kevin's Airstream was great! It was cozy and really convenient for everything we needed to do in Seattle. I didn't get to meet them, but everything was where they said it would be and the neighborhood info. they left was very helpful. Would stay again!"
6482409,34391111,2015-06-07,1866593,Romy,"I found myself needing to find a place at the last minute while visiting friends in Seattle, and landed at the Tiny House. It was perfect -- as compact and cozy and clean as you might expect and very pleasant on a summer weekend. The yard was also really nice. 

I did not get to meet Akiko, but Matt was very friendly and accommodating. 

It was a beautiful stay. I would return anytime."
6482409,34615622,2015-06-09,25014134,Sam,Both Akiko and Matt were polite and very welcoming.  Tiny House was exactly as listed.  Perfect for two or small families.  Upstairs bedrooms were cozy and well ventilated to the outside cool air.  We had some trouble connecting to the internet but overall it was a unique and wonderful experience!
6482409,35021624,2015-06-14,9210748,Roland,"Akiko and Matt promptly replied to our inquiry.  The Tiny House is amazing.  It's located in Matt's deep back yard, with chairs and a fire grill in front for outdoor comfort. The T House is small but complete.  Two loft beds upstairs and a 6 foot couch downstairs gives u 3 options for sleeping.  Plenty of kitchen utensils are available, and coffee too.
M & A were super friendly and spent time with us, trading adventure tales. 
We will be coming back!"
6482409,35844649,2015-06-22,2373094,Ernest,"This is such a lovely little space, but don't let the little scare you.  It had everything we needed and was super comfortable. Great hosts and very convenient location."
6482409,36156826,2015-06-25,18112342,Ben,I had a great time staying here. The place was as described and had everything I needed. I only wish I could have spent more time there! Thanks! 
6482409,36431791,2015-06-28,29827547,Noah,"Matt and Akiko's tiny house is super nice and very well appointed. The tiny house has everything you need to enjoy a great stay and was a very cool experience. Transportation is near (lightrail is 10 minute walk, bus is closer) as is a Safeway. For the time being, the lightrail only goes between downtown and the airport. I believe near future plans (2016) have it extending to Cap Hill and the University.

Be sure to check out Seward Park (great trails for hiking, running and biking) and Columbia City as both are pretty close and nice.

Matt and Akiko were extremely attentive and welcoming -- I honestly wish we had more time to hang out.

It is worth noting that the neighborhood around to tiny house appears to be in transition. Having said that, we never felt unsafe.

All in all, the tiny house is a place we will look visit again in the future."
6482409,36928332,2015-07-02,7720853,Emily,"My dad and I had such a great time staying in Matt and Akiko's tiny house. It is small but the layout is great and it is equipped with everything you'll need to feel at home. The beds were comfortable, the shower was awesome and it's in a great setting tucked away in their backyard. Other perks are the free and unrestricted street parking, walkable distance to the train, grocery and some yummy restaurants. They left lots of helpful information for travelers and Matt was also very accessible when we had questions. If you are at all interested in tiny houses, engage Matt in a conversation about his experience building this one.  "
6482409,37092790,2015-07-04,2715390,Mary,"Matt and Akiko's tiny house was perfect for me and my husband. It had everything we could possibly need. It felt surprisingly spacious and is extremely well designed and equipped. The attention to detail in the home is extraordinary. We loved every minute of it! 

The tiny house is a quick Uber ride to downtown and about a 20 minute train ride. The train/bus is conveniently located about a 10 minute walk from the house. There is also a supermarket which came in handy. It's also a quick Uber ride from the airport and Amtrak train station.

This is definitely the place to stay if you want a relaxing, quite retreat with easy access to the hustle and bustle of the city. "
6482409,37540126,2015-07-07,37569261,Joel,"We had a great time visiting the tiny house! The house was new, clean, and functional. Two lofts, WIFI, Apple TV, a composting toilet (don't be scared!), even a full sized shower! The appliances were nice and new. The house is conveniently located near the light rail station. It took us probably a half hour or so to get to Pioneer Square on the train. It was a really cool way to explore the city and get familiar with areas I'd never been to. I'd definitely recommend this tiny house to people wanting to visit Seattle or anyone looking to try out the tiny house lifestyle. Matt was a great and helpful host! We had an awesome time!"
6482409,37767597,2015-07-10,5347881,Roberta,"I could not have asked for better hosts or a better experience. The tiny house was very spacious, even with 2 people. Matt and Akiko thought of everything when building this house so every comfort you want or need is provided. The house was definitely part of my Seattle adventure and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. So many different types of restaurants to try nearby and access to downtown was very easy. Akiko and Matt were very gracious hosts and I truly enjoyed their company."
6482409,38155309,2015-07-13,35603909,Carly,"If you are looking for somewhere to stay in Seattle where you can minimise your environmental footprint while not sacrificing on comfort, then the Tiny House is for you!  From the moment we walked in, we got a sense for the time, effort and care that Matt and Akiko have put into designing, building and fitting out the house.  It has everything required for a great stay.  The loft-style beds look out over the trees where we saw squirrels running about - it's just like being in a treehouse!

PS - if you're a foodie, the house is located in an area with a multitude of great Vietnamese restaurants.  Don't leave without getting a vietnamese roll.  We also ate twice at the Rainier BBQ - visited by Anthony Bourdain and recommended by Akiko and Matt in the Tiny House book.  Plenty of other suggestions are provided - a thoughtful touch!"
6482409,38425564,2015-07-15,12675603,Wendy,Loved staying at the tiny house! Matt and Akiko were gracious hosts and the house was a unique way to experience Seattle. Light rail is very close and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly. I highly recommend staying here. You won't regret it!
6482409,39035204,2015-07-20,34212853,Mary,"What a charming place this Tiny House is! Clean, compact, such an efficient use of space, and perfect for the two of us. My daughter and I especially loved the two cozy lofts, where we slept hard after wonderful days exploring the Seattle area and Mt. Rainier National Park. We used the nearby light rail to get to and from the city easily. This airbnb worked great for us! 

--Mary and Emma"
6482409,39423736,2015-07-23,37496742,Laura,The Seattle Tiny house was a great place to stay while visiting Seattle. Matt and Akiko welcomed us upon our arrival and answered any questions we had. The brochures and informational folder they left were also very helpful to make the best out of our trip.  
6482409,40145852,2015-07-28,35144544,Anja,"The tiny house was great, such a lovely place! It turned out to be very spacious even for 3 people. Cleverly constructed and fun to explore.
When we arrived Matt was there to welcome us. The house was very clean and tidy. Basic amenities were provided. On the table you'll find several guides and a guest info book compiled by the hosts. It gives you a nice overview of the area and it's restaurants. We went to 2 of them and both were worth recommending. 
For us the tiny house was part of the perfect Seattle trip. It is something we will always remember. 
"
6482409,40635850,2015-08-01,37942351,Christian,"We absolutely loved our stay at Akiko and Matt's Tiny House!  Even with record highs, we slept comfortably.  Akiko and Matt are very welcoming and helpful.  We didn't get a chance to really get to know them as we were constantly on the go, but if we ever make it back to Seattle, we will definitely consider staying here again and hopefully have a chance to hang out a little.

Thanks again!"
6482409,40935714,2015-08-03,31087819,Alayna,"Fantastic hosts, unique accommodations, great experience. Matt and Akiko went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic. Great communication before and during our stay - including letting us know about some big events happening during our visit. Really impressed. The Tiny House is such a fun experience. Small space, but that's the point! Highly recommended. "
6482409,41279940,2015-08-05,26220909,Fujie,"Akiko and Matt are very friendly and they provided every detail to make my stay comfortable. My flight arrived after midnight, their self checking-in process was super easy and intuitive. Inside of the tiny house it was quite a great experience. It's beyond your normal understanding of ""minimum living"". The house rules are explained in details in a folder on the table. You can find every helpful information in there, very well written. Everything I need to know is explained. The house is great and didn't even feel crowded or tiny. I highly recommend Akiko and Matt's place. "
6482409,41359239,2015-08-07,380784,Ruth,"Matt and Akiko were wonderful hosts who greeted us cheerfully from the main house. Matt came down and unlocked the door for us and gave us a little insight on his tiny house, that he built himself.  The neighborhood was easy to navigate, very walkable, and had fruit trees dotting the yards. The tiny house was impeccable, smartly set up, and had everything our family of three needed.  I would absolutely recommend these wonderful hosts and their special house."
6482409,43372465,2015-08-19,12179723,Tim,"Matt and Akiko were among the most hospitable AirBnB hosts I've met, helpful in practical ways and welcoming in the sense of inviting us to dinner with them. The neighborhood is fascinating, full of New American as well as traditional Seattlites, and between the Tiny House and the light rail station are two wonderful blackberry bushes waiting to be picked!"
6482409,43708096,2015-08-21,41439496,James,"First of all, Matt and Akiko were great hosts! Upon our arrival, Matt greeted us, unlocked the door and showed us around the house. The house IS tiny, but spacious enough to fit all of our belongings when tucked away in the closet spaces. The house was clean and neat, furnished with comfortable beds, couch, silverware, kitchenware, towels, television, internet and so forth. The compost toilet was an interesting experience since we’ve never used one before, but it doesn’t take long to get used to. It also didn’t cause us any problems. Other than that, our stay was pleasant and would definitely recommend to adventurous travelers. Well decorated, cozy and modern feel to the place. We really enjoyed the experience of living in a tiny house!"
6482409,43928692,2015-08-23,33785552,Jordan,Such a great experience!!!
6482409,44376949,2015-08-25,143155,Griffin,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Matt & Akiko's tiny house. A really cool concept, implemented nicely. Despite its size, the house has just about everything you'd need to live in it long term! We were there for a couple days after a long week of camping at Olympic & Rainier, so it was a wonderful return back into urban life. Didn't run into Akiko while we were there, but I talked to Matt a bit and he was very friendly. Overall a great experience!"
6482409,44939467,2015-08-30,35655772,Twesh,The tiny house was great! We were a group of 3 guys who travel for a living and were meeting up in Seattle for a guys trip. The house made our trip incredible. We didn't have any issues. The composting toilet took a minute to understand and get accustomed to but I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. The toilet did not smell! They have a nice TV in the house and has an Apple TV hooked up to it but we didn't watch any TV. The hosts were friendly and very accommodating!
6482409,45447751,2015-09-02,1161210,Josh,"Absolutely loved staying at the tiny house. Makes me doubt ever staying in a hotel room again. We only saw Matt a couple times and he was delightful to talk to. The space was very clean and cleverly designed. If I'm ever in Seattle again I only hope this place is available again. Their tiny house handbook was very helpful and gave us some great local suggestions. Thank you so much for everything.

Joshua"
6482409,45670933,2015-09-05,36678106,Jim,"Made the reservation after reading other reviews.  Matt and Akiko were great with communication and really helped seal the deal.  I came into town for a game and this house is a 10 minute walk from the light rail.  The Tiny House isn't really all that tiny if you're not spending you're entire time there.  My 24yo daughter and I aren't small folks and we had plenty of space.  Everything worked and was SPOTLESS!  Much has been said already regarding the eco-toilet.   Its absolutely no big deal.  Finally, Matt was on the spot with local recommendations for food, etc.  Enjoy!"
6482409,46172228,2015-09-08,40968540,Xuying,"Though the house is very tiny, everything is provided by the host. It's very quiet. The host is very nice and thoughtful."
6482409,46564737,2015-09-11,13568172,Haley,"We absolutely loved our stay at the Seattle Tiny House. The house was very charming, clean and private and the description of the space was accurate. The parking was easy, and the yard was lovely and on a very nice, well kept property. I met Matt at the end our stay and he was very nice and welcoming. We would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for a very nice, cozy place to stay in the Seattle area. "
6482409,46904130,2015-09-14,39736653,Griffin,"Matt may not seem like the quintessential homebuilder type, but he has put together one sharp, tiny house nonetheless. If you're even entertaining the idea of super-downsizing your own home this is the ultimate proving ground because this place is as good as tiny gets.

We loved having private access to the place and since our entire trip was public transit based the location couldn't have been better. An easy walk to bus lines and the extraordinarily convenient light rail made our trip!"
6482409,48359553,2015-09-25,1159657,Daniel,"Cute and clean tiny home, with friendly hosts. Neighborhood is quiet. Despite previous reviewers I would say the area is safe, just older. Train station is with a 5-10 minute walk through a residential neighborhood.

Would definitely recommend!"
6482409,48701991,2015-09-28,30546859,Martha,My husband and I recently stayed here and it was fantastic. The tiny home was so quaint and Matt & Akiko were so welcoming. Would definitely stay here again if given the chance. 
6482409,50051954,2015-10-08,38598762,Lee,I had such an enjoyable stay in the Tiny House. Matt is a great host and did everything he could to make the stay great. If you've never stayed in a tiny house you owe it to yourself to experience what tiny living is all about. And this is a fun spot to try. And the composting toilet is very easy. Will be staying here again. 
6482409,50227106,2015-10-10,45390289,Aaron,"Our stay at the Tiny House was terrific.  The location is convenient to the airport and some attractive retail is found both near at hand and on the short trip to downtown.  Accurately described- tiny, but comfortable and functional. The Tiny House is aesthetically satisfying through minimal and tasteful appointments.  This space works. 
We had three adults (one a teenager) so the quarters were close, but totally possible and easily achieved.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay again.
Our stay was brief and totally scheduled so we only crossed paths with Matt once and unfortunately time didn't allow for extended conversation.  Matt and Akiko's property is lovely; the neighborhood is appears to be on the rise in popularity - blocks and blocks of quiet residential bordered by some mixed commercial on main corridors at a a reasonable distance. A great place to stay in a convenient and quiet city neighborhood.  Oh and this property is minutes away from Seward Park, an Olmstead Brothers designed forested park on a hilly promontory that extends into Lake Washington with views of Mercer Island, cityscape, and if sufficiently clear, Mount Rainier. "
6482409,50602938,2015-10-12,41664985,Rachael,"The tiny house is amazing. Perfectly designed for the amount of space and very comfortable. Matt was a great host although we kept to ourselves while there. 10/10 would stay there again. Thanks Matt and Akiko, I would exclusively use air b&b if every place was like this. "
6482409,51038886,2015-10-17,30068495,Stephanie,"We had learned about tiny houses on tv and were excited to stay in one in our trip to Seattle. This tiny house is pretty on the outside and very nicely designed on the inside. My husband, baby and I stayed at the house and we didn't feel crowded. With the two lofts, there was plenty of space. Having the tv available with HBOGo was a plus since the baby had an early bedtime. 

It was really convenient to get to downtown Seattle since the light rail was about a 10-15 minute walk. The ride to downtown was about 20 mins. We tried driving to downtown but with traffic and paying for parking, the light rail is the way to go. "
6482409,53531966,2015-11-09,4396772,Alex,"Having done quite a bit of reading about tiny house living, we were excited to see a tiny house accommodation on Airbnb.  The space is small as the name indicates, but had everything we needed for a long weekend trip and it was a great experience!  Burner stove, comfortable bed, quiet neighborhood, warm shower and close to Light Rail.  The walk from Othello Light Rail is 10 minutes and the trains come frequently.  The composting toilet is true to it's description and has no odor.  Matt and Akiko were very accommodating and letting us keep our luggage in their garage while we explored the city our last day. It was a treat to be able to experience a tiny space!"
6482409,54010511,2015-11-15,16400116,Jason,The home was clean and offered all the amenities we needed (specifically a warm shower and comfy beds for weary travelers). Very easy access to the rail - just a 5 minute stroll. Matt also gave timely and easy correspondence on any inquiries we had. 
6482409,54906002,2015-11-25,44104109,Brooke,Staying at the tiny house was a new experience. It provided everything we needed and was very cozy. Matt and Akiko were very nice and attentive! 
6482409,55392916,2015-12-01,46316424,Jocelyn,"The tiny house is tiny, as described, but a cute experience. The house is designed with a nice radiant heat system where it kept the floors heated, but I didn't really feel it warm up the whole house as I was expecting. On my last night, I actually bumped into Akiko and mentioned that it was a little cold but nothing I couldn't handle. Matt heard and was super nice to bring over a space heater for me. He also told me a bit about how he designed this house over the past year. Akiko and Matt were so sweet. "
4831200,24776177,2015-01-02,13935468,Devin,"My wife and I had a great time staying at Chad's apartment. The neighborhood is absolutely perfect, with all of Capitol Hill's shopping, restaurants, and bars within walking distance and easy access to public transportation to explore rest of the city. We enjoyed the apartment's unique interior, which is comfortable as well as stylish. Chad was a welcoming and accommodating host. Check in/out was easy as can be. We would definitely stay here again on future trips to Seattle. "
4831200,26108717,2015-02-03,4440888,Daniela,"I can't say enough about Chad and his amazing studio apartment. Even before our arrival, Chad was super helpful and communicative. Upon our arrival, there was a bottle of wine and a bag of delicious Stumptown coffee waiting for us. The place was clean, neat, and welcoming, with an impressive window view and stylish decor.  The building itself is in a perfect location, surrounded by restaurants and bars. However, it's important to mention that the actual street is quiet and peaceful. There are also lots of Car2Go cars parked nearby, which is helpful if you'd prefer to navigate the city by car. All in all, it was a great visit. We would definitely stay at Chad's again! "
4831200,26689533,2015-02-17,4608744,Kim,The studio was very welcoming and explanation cards made sense. Everything was clean and neat and I felt at ease upon arrival. The studio is in a super convenient location and it was easy to access the rest of the Hill and downtown. Having a QFC and lots of coffee options nearby is fantastic. 
4831200,28403149,2015-03-23,10746351,Brooke,"Chad was amazing! Very friendly, always responsive, and full of tips on tasty things to try around the city. He even left some Stumptown coffee with a french press, cold bottles of water, and a bottle of our favorite type of wine! The place was super clean and had a great funky feel."
4271174,32721630,2015-05-20,298469,Tonia,"Blanca and Cody were absolute legends! In our 3 night stay we hung out for a couple of hours on two occasions and had a great time swapping stories. They know a lot of cool stuff and all the right places you should check out when staying in Seattle - not to mention other places for roadtripping through the states. These guys are super accommodating, friendly and make you feel at home in their place - they even made me some tea when I was feeling sick. 

Their place is awesome, super clean, ridiculously comfy (that couch) has heaps of character and if you're into mid century furniture or design then totally up your alley. One of the nights was pretty cold during our stay and when we returned home the heater was already going for us which made the room perfect to sleep. 

Location wise this spot is great. It seemed central to everything with most trips in the car only lasting 10 or so minutes.  Parking was also easy in the street. 

Cannot recommend this place enough, they've set the standard for airbnb hosts pretty damn high. "
4271174,33158022,2015-05-25,7942651,Elyssa,"Blanca was an amazing host! We had a late night arrival and Blanca was very accommodating and stayed up late to welcome us even though she had work in the morning. 

Overall we had a wonderful experience. First, the place was even more beautiful and stylish in person and less than 15 minutes from everything in Seattle. Second, Blanca prepared a map of local places for us to explore since we had never been to Seattle before. Finally and most importantly, Blanca made us feel right at home like we were staying with family. 

I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this place for anyone visiting Seattle. "

4271174,34734538,2015-06-11,947232,Cindy,"Blanca was enthusiastic and warm from her first message! Her space was very cozy and comfortable. Loved the clean, mid-century vibe, was very peaceful and there were lots of amenities--TV, kitchenette area. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet. Great hosts!"
4271174,34897860,2015-06-13,34597382,Rose,"Blanca and Cody were fantastic hosts and our stay with then contributed to our overall experience in Seattle, which we loved! We arrived to a glass of wine from Blanca and warm cookies from Cody and chatted as the sun went down about life in our respective cities, while they offered recommendations of neighbourhoods and places to check out during our time in Seattle. From fine dining, to thrift store shopping, they really had it covered and their suggestions were a hit every time, with lots of hidden gems for us to enjoy and feel like locals. 

The place is simple, clean and stylish, with a cozy sectional couch and outdoor seating as well. We kept things on budget eating breakfast there in the morning and winding down the day with wine and cheese at night. The set up was perfect for what we needed. The location is great for someone with a car, with nothing more then 20 minutes away. Street parking was never a problem.

Having visited Seattle once before, this trip transformed my impression of what the city has to offer and trying to determine how, as a Canadian, I could possibly live there some day! Thanks Blanca and Cody!

4271174,35357301,2015-06-17,4200025,Jesse,very welcoming. Nice quiet spot.
4271174,35498900,2015-06-19,34994480,Megan,"Blanca and Cody were amazing!  Their place was comfortable and had everything we could need, including little touches like cotton balls and dish soap.  That couch was to die for, and the neighborhood is amazing and seconds away from an overlook of the entire city and Mt. Rainier.  They could not have been more inviting and friendly-- Blanca even helped us plan our camping trip to Mr. Rainier and the surrounding areas, and Cody brought home amazing freshly baked cookies for us.  We really got spoiled!  We would highly recommend them to anyone and hope to stop back soon!"
4271174,35952915,2015-06-23,34672073,Paul,"Blanca and Cody were fantastic hosts and incredibly kind and considerate.  Both made sure I was as comfortable as possible and had everything I needed for my stay (heater, wifi, tv, etc).  They even offered me access to their Netflix!  The room itself is cozy, and much, much larger than I expected.  The location is mere minutes from Discovery Park, Ballard, Fremont, and Downtown Seattle, making it really centralized to various points of interest around the city.  I highly recommend this Airbnb for the company of two wonderful people, and for the super spacious, and super cool room.  Thanks so much Blanca and Cody for being part of a great Seattle experience!!"
4271174,38001953,2015-07-12,35478158,Emily,"Blanca was very welcoming when we arrived. She showed us the home, and had everything ready for our arrival. Her home was adorable and the space was exactly as described, and included everything we could possible need - extra blankets, extra pillows, Netflix, wi-fi, cotton balls, paper towels, etc.  She was very accommodating with the shared bathroom, letting us know what her schedule would/could be in order for everyone to have fair access.  The neighborhood was beautiful and quite, with a great view.
Though we had plans every day, Blanca was very understanding and more than willing to share information about where to eat, where to go, what to do, etc.,  as needed.  "
4271174,38634257,2015-07-17,6478601,Rene,"Very helpful host and partner. Really making it us convenient and feeling us at home. Helped out with EU A/C power adapter we forgot.

The room with separated entrance is in basement and cool. Neighborhood is fine / safe. Travel with public transport from Airport (Light Rail) and furtheron from City to this Airbnb could be done by Bus 33 (direct stop at counter of street) or Bus 19 or 24 (few blocks a way, but duable by foot even with luagges."
4271174,38684687,2015-07-17,2223731,Kent,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

The room was greatly arranged with separate entrence."
4271174,39688246,2015-07-25,1571862,Danielle,"The space is cute, clean, and as pictured, although pretty small.  There is a separate entrance which is convenient.  The bathroom is upstairs in the shared space and across from the bedroom, which made me feel a little intrusive as the house is small.  Blanca was friendly and helpful.  The location is nice, however there's not much food nearby.  The bus to downtown was on time when it chose to show up.  My only complaint is that they could have been a little more accommodating with picking up the key as my plan changed slightly when I arrived into town.  "
4271174,39780720,2015-07-26,22736916,Melissa,"What a beautiful and kind couple to cross paths with! They were extremely accommodating with my check-in time due to Seattle traffic. Their home is lovely with a cozy, eclectic touch. It's also in a perfect location - I was within a few miles of my friend's wedding celebration and great coffee! "
4271174,41387852,2015-08-07,36704420,Felix,"Blanca and Cody very welcomed us in their home. We really enjoyed staying there.

I didn't realize the bathroom and shower is upstairs, but that's probably from me not reading the description, but it was super easy to use and not a big deal.  Blanca was as nice and helpful as can be.  Would stay here again when I'm in Seattle. "
4271174,47789194,2015-09-21,33327914,Jeri,Blanca and Cody are awesome hosts completely laid back and very hospitable. Great location just a short drive to most local sites. I would stay here again.

It was great to be situated in a quiet suburb away from the city centre. Thanks to both of you for your kindness and help. 
Jane and Ian"

She helped me find interesting venues nearby and she was super friendly and interesting.

Will stay again!"
4271174,48810220,2015-09-28,396372,Kay,"I loved my stay at Blanca's and Cody's place. First of all, it is breathtakingly pretty, thoughtfully furnished and decorated, even cuter than in the pictures. 
Second I had an amazing time: Smooth communication and check in, night out with what felt like longtime friends including dancing to grease and hot chocolate on the sunny porch the next morning. 
Thanks so much and hope to see you soon! "
4271174,49703101,2015-10-05,15428197,Julie,"Blanca was great and made us feel very welcome. I would definitely stay here again when I come back to Seattle. There house was very clean and the private entrance was great. When we needed to use the bathroom upstairs, it was always available.

They had a great view of the city from their street too.

Definitely a great spot!"
8276416,46461254,2015-09-10,38041512,Jeff,"Jay met us as soon as we arrived. He & Amelia were very welcoming and so hospitable. The view from the rooftop was incredible, and the apartment was exactly as portrayed on the app. We had all the amenities we could want, plus some. Overall, we could not have asked for a better first Air BnB experience. This couple is so friendly and gave us so many great tips. We would highly recommended staying with Jay & Amelia. They go above and beyond to make you comfortable. "
8276416,47137558,2015-09-15,17075759,Breelyn,"Amelia and Jay were great! We needed a last minute place to stay after the mariners game. They made us feel welcome and the pictures/description they have of their place is on point! The place is clean, cute, cozy and welcoming. Wish we could have stayed longer. I would definitely recommend them:) "
8276416,51734317,2015-10-24,40430544,Zachary,Amelia and Jay are great hosts.  I was with them for a longer-term stay and they did everything to make me feel at home.  Plenty of privacy + separate bath in this apt.  Never had any issues with hosts or the complex.  The location is great as you are close to everything in West Seattle and not too far from downtown (try the scenic water taxi).  I highly recommend staying here. 
8276416,53428516,2015-11-08,1977914,Danny,The stay was wonderful. Perfect. Jay and Amelia were super sweet and attentive. And the room and the place was just super comfortable and everything to make the stay feel like home.
8276416,53681878,2015-11-11,23432287,Jeannie,"Amelia and Jay were wonderful hosts. So friendly and helpful. They were easily accessible by email or messaging.   Their location can't be beat, so close to downtown and a very quiet, safe neighborhood. The underground parking was fantastic. They were there if you needed anything, otherwise they just left you be. Would definitely stay there again. Thank you so much!"
8276416,54131570,2015-11-16,46505566,Jennifer,So amazing. Nicest couple and completely accommodating. Can't wait to come back and really sad to leave. House and amenities are great especially the mini fitness room. Very clean and modern as well.
8276416,55369544,2015-12-01,22624913,Denise,"Jay & Amelia are the most gracious hosts.  Although you share their home with them, you really feel like you have your own private space.  The bed is very comfortable & your bathroom is right next to your room.  They are very engaging & welcoming while giving you privacy.  Would stay with them again in a heartbeat!  Lucy & I thank you. "
8276416,55903810,2015-12-07,34921981,Staci,Awesome location and space. Amelia and Jay were great hosts allowing us our privacy but helping with whatever we needed. The guidebook was a huge help as this was my friend and my first trip to Seattle!
8276416,56582727,2015-12-14,50594927,Travis,"This was the best place I've ever stayed. The price was perfect. The vibe was so chill and welcoming. Almost like a shared living space,  but you get your privacy and undisturbed rest unlike a hostel,  it was super clean, had the best natural munchie foods in my room. Tea, coffee, all the amenities you could want. Wifi was fast. They were so personable and now that I've stayed at their AIRBNB I can say we are friends. The best experience I've had, hands down. Thanks for all the help. You guys are the best!"
8276416,57182199,2015-12-22,50818333,Jiaming,Fantastic！This is one of the best places I've ever stayed. It's very comfortable and quiet. Also Jay was very friendly and easy to get along with. He helped me a lot with my trip in Seattle and was very patient.I recommend this apartment.
7697340,43172005,2015-08-17,5733285,Praful,"We were the first guests for this wonderful place with a fantastic host.  Lovely new modern house in East Lake.  Patio on the roof has gorgeous views of the lake and Seattle skyline.  The house is very tastefully furnished with all the modern touches.  Ruby is an absolutely fantastic host.   Ruby provided very detailed and helpful information of the house and the area, and was very responsive when we had questions. Would highly recommend to my friends. Thanks Ruby."
7697340,48901213,2015-09-29,12144753,Lauryn,"12 hours before our arrival our host tried cancelling our reservation and told us there were sewer problems. When we arrived it was dirty, hair all over the master bath and bedroom, dishes still in dishwasher, laundry in machine, no room for food of our own. She told us there would be 3 bikes and there was none. She told us the neighbors that shared the deck knew she rented her property but they had no idea. After we left she has continued to harass us about the sewer problem saying this is our fault. Due to the way she treated us throughout our stay, we would never reccomend this property to anyone.  She had no respect for us as guests and has given us no reason to ever use this website again. "
3434459,40681582,2015-08-01,28562330,Taylor,"To start off Ourania was fantastic! She was so welcoming and made you feel right at home. Her home was adorable and the room looked exactly like it did in the pictures. The pictures almost didn't do justice for how nice the rest of her home was. 

My favorite part of staying here would have to be the great conversation that we had! She was kind enough to make coffee every morning which gave us about 30 minutes to just sit around and talk! She is full of interesting stories from her travels and great advice! 

Overall my experience in her home was great and if need be, I would stay with her again in a heart beat! Thanks for the great hospitality! "
3434459,41483664,2015-08-07,39656673,Jocagraca,The location was the best since I was taking a course at UW. She gave me great orientation about the buses that I had to take.
3434459,42190756,2015-08-11,33847599,Anne,"Ourania is a gracious, receptive, kind host. She was very responsive to my needs; for example, she helped me navigate Seattle's public transportation system via email before I even arrived. Her house is lovely and comfortable and convenient to the university, and looks like it belongs in House Beautiful. The neighborhood is safe and I should know, as I walked there multiple nights after 11pm. All in all, a great experience with an accommodating, friendly host. "
3434459,45842726,2015-09-06,6366120,Devon,"Very clean, great location. Ourania was very nice and accommodating, even with my oversized luggage which was a pain in the ass for all. Felt at home, and would recommend."
3434459,47515299,2015-09-19,6457901,Carey,"Ourania was very accommodating to my unpredictable arrival time. When I arrived, she was home to orient me to the house. Her older home was not only beautiful but it was also immaculate. 

Although the bedroom is small, the bed is comfortable and the sheets were luxurious. The closet and bureau drawers had ample room to stow my belongings during my stay. The two guest rooms share a wall, and, because noises travels, I was appreciative that the other guest didn’t snore. The shared modern bathroom is convenient to the bedrooms. It is spacious, features thoughtful details, and as immaculate as the rest of the house. Ourania helps guests set designated shower time to get everyone in the household gracefully through morning preparations.

Ourania’s older cat Diva learned that I had a welcoming lap and adopted me quickly, following me upstairs to my bedroom. One has to be quick to shut the bedroom door, as the house rule is “no cats in the bedrooms”. Good rule. 

 Ourania is not only kind, but she is also generous. She clearly wants to make her guests comfortable. She installed a night light in the bathroom for guests that have need of the bathroom at night. She loaned me an umbrella and procured a lightweight blanket for my comfort because the weather was unpredictable. 

I wish I had had more time to visit with Ourania. Next time!

4311078,47618461,2015-09-21,31741459,Mary,"We were in Seattle for our son's wedding and the house was perfect for us.  There were 6 adults and 2 children and we had plenty of room.  The house  had a warm, cozy feeling and we felt right at home.  So much better than hotel rooms!  The house was convenient to the wedding venue and we loved the ability to walk around the lovely neighborhood, and to the University.  "
4311078,54960434,2015-11-25,49574964,Matthew,Great house in a neighborhood filled with beautiful old craftsman style homes.  The fire place and heated floors in the bathroom were a great touch for a cold Seattle week.  Loved the kitchen as well.  Would stay again!
2071305,14568233,2014-06-22,15769563,Donna,"Cheryl was an excellent host for a wonderful visit to Seattle. The condo is clean, convenient, cozy and comfortable. I would definitely stay there again."
2071305,15911981,2014-07-18,15690939,Thiago,"Cheryl is an excellent host and a terrific cook.  She knows many tips about Seattle and is very helpful (These characteristics are essential for foreigners that are not fluent in English like me). We did many things together, such as going to restaurants, hiking in parks in Seattle, and buying food from regional producers in fairs. Additionally, the apartment is very clean and matches exactly with the description. The condo is in a friendly neighborhood, which is very close to a shopping mall and close to a bus terminal. It is very easy to catch buses for different parts of the city, including the University of Washington. I spent 30 great days in her home and I strongly recommend the place."
2071305,16844252,2014-08-03,11238947,Helen,"Cheryl is a great host. She is kind, well-travelled, and knowledeable about Seattle and surrounding areas. We had some fun / interesting conversation whenever our paths crossed, although it was sparse as we were both pretty busy. My room was very quiet, clean and comfortable. I had restful sleeps on the single bed with enough breeze from the window to keep me cool at night. There was a convenient desk in the room where  I accessed wi-fi and used my computer.  The kitchen was well -organised with labels that helped to navigate, plus it was immaculate which made it easy to clean up after yourself. The bathroom was also well - maintained. The living room was small but super quaint and cozy,  and I spent one night flipping through netflix and watching a movie with Babette the adorable cat, on my lap. I was tempted to work out on the row machine, but found other things to do! I was also able to take a dip in the pool on a very hot evening, which was calm and cooling - a delightful perk! There are a handful of tasty restaurants within walking distance as well as a convenient grocery store, drug store and giant shopping mall. The transit is simple and easy to use to get from the condo to downtown, or to and from the airport for that matter. I was really happy and  relieved to have found this place, as I was taking an intensive workshop for two weeks about a 20 minute bicycle from the condo, and needed a restful haven to come home to every night. It's a gem. "
2071305,18258648,2014-08-24,18815791,Anthony,"Having never been to Seattle and moving to Seattle,  staying with Cheryl really helped. Great location ( near bus terminal and highway), great apartment complex, and great host.  Cheryl knows Seattle, has many guides and lots of advice, and invites you to join her on hikes to Mt Rainier.   "
2071305,21040922,2014-10-10,20748544,Chao,"This is my first time been to America and lived in an American family. Cheryl,her son and the cat gave me a really tidy, quiet and cozy home.Just like living in my own home.Cheryl is kind and offers me lots of help. This flat has a perfect location which is quite near a mall and bus transit center. I'm glad to share her home during these 20 days in Seattle. I will come here next time!"
2071305,22579712,2014-11-10,20360889,Tiago,"Cheryl é uma excelente anfitriã. Sua residência está localizada em um bairro com inúmeros serviços e com fácil acesso de ônibus, sobretudo para quem vai à Universidade de Washington. O ambiente é muito confortável, limpo e tranquilo. Tanto ela, quanto seu filho, foram sempre educados e prestativos. Recomendo sem nenhuma dúvida.

Cheryl and her son are a great hosts. Her place is very clean and is located in an excellent neighborhood with easy access to UW. I felt very comfortable there and truly recommend."
2071305,27207868,2015-02-28,22651227,Petronio,"Cheryl and her son were extremely welcoming and helpful, and their cat was very friendly. Their condo was very clean and comfortable, and the kitchen was well labeled. The location was also exceptional with very short walking distance to the grocery store and the library (and attached bus stop), as well as various restaurants and the mall.

My stay with them was extremely pleasant, despite my early schedule, and I had no issues while I was there for a month."
2071305,41324353,2015-08-07,17873593,Allison,"Wow, what an amazing stay in Northgate! Cheryl went above and beyond her hosting duties and made me feel welcomed throughout my stay. I lived here for more than two months and am without any complaints. It was a great way to experience everything Seattle has to offer. Thanks for everything Cheryl!"
2071305,45273418,2015-09-01,21813605,Jessie,"I am so happy to have found this place beautiful room to stay in during my transition to Seattle. I was traveling by myself and would be in Seattle for 3 weeks before my family arrived and we moved into our new home. Cheryl was incredibly accommodating, straight forward and a wonderful host. I was happy to spend most of my evenings alone in my room or out, but it was nice to have a dinner companion or someone to chat with every once in awhile! 

The room was very nice. There was a closet which surprisingly fit all of my clothing from 3 suitcases(!), plus a desk, a chair in the corner and a twin size bed. It was a little warm a few nights, but there was a fan for me to use and I found with an open window the temperature was perfect. 

I wasn't much of a cook, but Cheryl had a wonderful kitchen with nearly every appliance and utensil you could need. There were many restaurants and a grocery store within walking distance. I did have a car there and I never had trouble finding street parking right out front. I also experimented taking the bus downtown for work. It was a quick walk and then a smooth 10 minute bus ride to get downtown. Nice and Easy! I would definitely recommend Cheryl and staying at her condo for anyone in need of a nice, quiet space! "
2071305,48511856,2015-09-27,15358006,Tracy,"I enjoyed staying in Cheryl's home during my first month in Seattle.  Cheryl, Evan, and Babette were very welcoming and made me feel right at home. The location of her home is so convenient and is in a safe neighborhood' It is within walking distance to Northgate Mall, Target, QFC, and Thornton Place movie theater. It is also about a 5-10 minute walk to the bus stops and the Northgate Transit Center. Cheryl also had a spare bike to use, which I took advantage of and took it to to the bike trails by the lakes.  If you need a place to stay for a couple weeks in Seattle, I highly recommend staying here!"
2071305,55711445,2015-12-05,35801124,Leticia,"I loved my first month in Seattle and I'm sure that staying here and having Cheryl as host was the main responsible for that.
The condo unit is great and the bedroom is really nice. Cheryl and Evan are very welcoming, I felt right at home. They both are great in making you feel confortable in whatever you want to do, if you want to stay on your own or chat/share a meal with.  Cheryl is also very helpful and always has great tips for things to do, places to eat, etc.
Their condo is on a perfect location, close to everything - grocery store, mall, restaurants - and you can have easy access to everywhere with bus stops around the corner and the Transit Center (5-10 min walk).
I feel really lucky that I have found this beautiful place and met such nice people. 
I definitely recommend staying here and having Cheryl as a host. She takes care of everything to guarantee the traveling experience that every airbnb could ask for."
5620306,49532063,2015-10-04,7299194,Manoj,"Staying at this airbnb accommodation has been one of my best experiences so far. The place is as described on the site, perhaps better than that. With tons of natural light and view of Mt. Rainier from the bedroom, it certainly is a premium accommodation. I stayed here for one week and worked from home. And its just been terrific. 

Muna is a fabulous host. She made me feel welcomed to the place. She made sure that I was comfortable with everything, and gave me my privacy, whenever I wanted it. She was very courteous, caring and communicative throughout my stay. 

Overall, I had a great stay and I will certainly consider staying here again, whenever chance permits me next."
5620306,56442663,2015-12-13,50621059,Kathleen,"We enjoyed our time @ Muna's pad.  She is a gracious hostess & a warm individual.  The accomadations were lovely, just like the pic!  Muna's place is located in the heart of Ballard and only a few blocks away from our son, so it was perfect for us!  The coffee was wonderful & the elevator made the 3rd floor a breeze to get to with our overpacked bags!  Enjoy your time with her, she is a delight!"
6741526,38533115,2015-07-16,36956983,Kaselehlia,"We really enjoyed staying at this house for a few nights!  The multiple bedrooms served our family perfectly and we enjoyed the location as a jumping off place for greater Seattle activities.  Since we were a family group, we enjoyed the location walkable distance to the Matthews Beach Park too.  We also found the price to be respectable for the size of the house and comparable to other airbnb listings at the time.  The French/European decor was fun too!"
6741526,38872864,2015-07-19,16340614,Andrew,The house was great. I a really nice spot just a very short walk from lake front park right across the very quiet road. Great kitchen and living area and plenty of space in bedrooms and downstairs games room. We were a family of five so all kids had a room to themselves. Close to bike path and driving distance to university shops. Highly recommend it
6741526,40225175,2015-07-29,33900962,Tom,"The house was amazing.  We only wish we could have stayed longer.  Super close to Matthews Beach.  House had top notch appliances.
I would definitely stay there again.
"
6741526,41364340,2015-08-07,6715205,Hoan,"We had a wonderful family vacation in Seattle, and this place was just great. We had kids of all ages (18months-12years), and never once did anyone ask to turn on a TV. The house was nice and clean. There were many board games, books and toys to keep the kids entertained. The house is steps away from Matthew's Beach, where there is an incredible jogging/cycling trail, a great shaded playground and a beach with a whole crew of lifeguards on duty. "
6741526,43058207,2015-08-17,31113645,Peggy,"Bob was very responsive and accommodating.  We loved the house.  It accommodated well our group of 7.  LOVE the kitchen!  Everyone enjoyed being a short walk from the lake.  I rarely bring my whole family to Seattle, but if I ever do again, we would definitely want to stay here again."
6741526,43567299,2015-08-20,32770626,Jessica,"We had a great time in this spacious and well equipped home!  The beach and park are across the street!  This is a great place to stay for families looking to retreat and be together!  
"
6741526,45261631,2015-09-01,37261130,LaJuan,"Our family loved the house.  The neighborhood was quite and the neighbors very friendly.   You should show the lovely park just a few minutes walk on the website.  
The fact that you supplied a computer and wifi was great.  If we come back to Seattle we will try to rent this place again."
6741526,46309740,2015-09-09,41643660,Abiy,"The description was accurate, the house manager Ann was great. We had a good time in Seattle. The middle section of the house was our favorite place. The location of the house - beautiful trail, walking distance to the beach makes our vacation memorable.  "
6741526,47190308,2015-09-16,12427183,Lucy,"It was a wonderful stay at Bob's spacious and comfortable home. There were more amenities than I expected including the exercise machines, the stacks of board games and a large living area for my family to gather. The house was also just 2 min away from the small beach next to Lake Washington and it really added to our stay here. As well, Bob responded promptly to all my questions and he also left us a nice treat to start the weekend. Although the house was a little further from the busy areas of Seattle, it was still a great gem for my family."
6741526,49820960,2015-10-06,9869998,Alex,"This was the easiest, simplest, and dare I say most enjoyable Airbnb experience I've ever had. We didn't get to meet Bob or the Rathbone family, but their home was in immaculate condition and exactly what we had expected and hoped for. Between the dreamy kitchen, the open floor plan, the pinball, workout machines, board games, canoe, and spectacular location next to Mathews Beach Park, it was the ideal location for our family gathering. Thanks!!!"
6741526,50530613,2015-10-12,45003699,Shelly,Overall we had an amazing time at the place we stayed in. Bob was quick in responding to any questions I had. It's a spacious house with a lot of amenities in the house to use. Quiet area with privacy. 
6741526,56871016,2015-12-19,3453511,Michael,House was great. Checkin was super easy. Everything went smoothly. Bonus points: someone in our group left her watch and Bob wrote and offered to mail it back to us. Very kind!
8253456,47338988,2015-09-17,5199986,Peter,"Hanna's place is very neat and comfortable. Great place to relax in between adventures! It is amidst many great restaurants and bars, and close to pike place, the space needle and the link to the airport! Hanna was very friendly and accommodating, would for sure stay here again! "
8253456,47849233,2015-09-21,41006426,Joshua,"Hannah's place is perfectly located in a safe part of town. The building is next door to a mini grocery store, but also within walking distance to several bars and restaurants. Netflix and Amazon TV were a plus and the extra toiletries came in handy as well. I would highly recommend staying at her place. "
8253456,47941342,2015-09-21,41541813,Javi,Great location and quite spacious. All very clean (and new :P). Hanna was very welcoming
8253456,48144903,2015-09-23,2632840,Ann,"Hanna was very friendly, prompt and communicative.  Was there to welcome me and the apartment was very clean and welcoming!  Will stay again next time in SEA."
8253456,48599829,2015-09-27,43979688,Lei,"Spacious, clean, quiet and close to everything!  Hanna is a wonderful host!"
8253456,49262640,2015-10-02,44434961,Mengting,"I have an excellent experience in Seattle,  wonderful and clean room, beautiful view to the bay, convenient to every main point of interest in Seattle, nice landlord. I really have a great time there and will for sure recommendat my friends if they were there."
8253456,49561012,2015-10-04,18846826,Laura,"The host was very accommodating! Hanna coordinated with a friend to show us around and drop off the keys which was very smooth and simple.  Both very friendly and welcoming! The location was great, quick walking distance to the downtown touristy areas including Pike Market and the sports arenas.  The apartment itself very roomy and minimal. We really enjoyed it!"
8253456,51163310,2015-10-18,43632420,Taylor,"Had a great stay!  We only really used the apartment for sleeping and showering, but it was nice to have an actual living space rather than some hotel room.  Both beds were comfortable, there were clean sheets waiting for us when we arrived.

Location is choice.  Excellent walking distance to Pike Place and the Space Needle, as well as Capital Hill and the walk to CenturyLink wasn't too bad either.  Would definitely stay again!"
8253456,51806570,2015-10-24,24934693,Danny,One my best AirBnB Experiences. Hanna is an awesome and caring host.
8253456,55419705,2015-12-01,42030214,Katt,Thank you for a really easy transaction for our visitors!  It's always difficult when you can't be in the same place as your travelers and Hanna made it easy.  Thanks again for everything!
9217446,53649853,2015-11-10,4864623,Phoebe,"It was such a wonderful time at Kelly's place. It was situated close to the light rail station(abt 10 mins walk on flat road, no uphill thankfully!) and in a safe and quaint neighborhood. The light rail takes you to downtown in abt 20 mins. So her place is really convenient!

Her house is so beautiful and it's really what she describes in her listing. It helps a lot that her room has heater esp during the cold weather.

Kelly has been such a friendly and awesome host! She was prompt to answer all my qns and she was sincere in helping me in everything I needed help in. She even gave me a ride to downtown as she was heading to church nearby. She's very thoughtful and generous, even prepared lots of snacks to welcome me. 

Thanks so much for your kind hospitality, Kelly! Lucky cat was such a sweetheart too. Will definitely love to stay with you when I visit Seattle again. :)"
9217446,54820249,2015-11-23,25138655,Jennielyn,"Everything was just as described. It was simple and comfortable, which was all I needed. The area is great-- close to all the main bus stops and just a short ride away from downtown Seattle. Didn't have a chance to meet the host until my last day but she is so well organized and set-up it was a very smooth experience. I would definitely stay here again, and can recommend it to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
9217446,55156607,2015-11-28,28469860,Julia,"My brother and I stayed with Kelly during the Thanksgiving holiday and she was wonderful! She offered us coffee in the morning and chatted with us a bit before we all headed our separate direction. We had our own rental car so we didn't use public transit, but Kelly's home is located near the downtown area and isn't hard to get to at all. If you're looking for a quiet neighborhood with a hospitable host, Kelly is the way to go! I would definitely recommend her. "
9217446,56793841,2015-12-18,4001957,Daniel,"Staying at Kellys place was great. The location is in a very quiet and calm neighbourhood only 7-10 minutes from the tram station. Communication with Kelly was easy and very fast. The room is small, but very functional. She has laid out some maps and restaurant menus from near by attractions. Her cat was very peaceful and quiet."
6824408,39038121,2015-07-20,11364675,Mark,"We had a great time at Greg's house! Very peaceful, relaxing house. Easy place for the whole family to hang out, make meals together and enjoy being together.
"
6824408,45270971,2015-09-01,38503082,Wei,"Greg has a great place in the heart of Seattle. We stayed there for a conference, and had an absolutely wonderful stay. it's a quick 5 minute Uber ride to the convention center downtown, and walking distance from some great coffee places. 

We had a package delivered to the house while we were away, and Greg took care of the package and made sure we got it.

Overall a great experience, and Greg is an awesome host!"
6824408,46081548,2015-09-07,43140187,Antonia,"Greg was easy to get in contact with and was very welcoming! The house description was accurate, if not better. We had no troubles with neighbours and overall had a great stay. "
3251016,15590042,2014-07-12,6923896,David,We had a wonderful time in Seattle and enjoyed our stay at Desirée's bungalow in Alki. The bungalow is tastefully furnished and has everything we needed. The beds are very comfortable. The backyard with grill and firepit is simply great. Desirée is a great host and provided us with lots of very useful information. We definitely recommend the location to everyone visiting Seattle and wanting to stay at a quiet place. 
3251016,16099077,2014-07-22,15696252,J. Michael,"Desiree was a lovely and attentive host. Even before arriving, she sent a great description of the area. Upon arrival, she met us at the front door of the newly renovated bungalow and showed us all the features of the house; it was lovely--well furnished and immaculate.  Alki Beach is laid back with many restaurants within walking distance. Our family of five fit perfectly and we enjoyed the backyard's deck and fire pit.  Even the neighbors were friendly--the lady owning the house next door gave us a bag of freshly picked lettuce from her garden!  Thank you, Desiree!"
3251016,16351864,2014-07-26,15077527,Odile,"For our first time in Seattle the location of this house was perfect, close to the restaurants, the beach, water taxi to go downtown. And remote enough to be quiet. 
And Inside it is so well equiped ! comfortable mattress, sofa, full kitchen, And badminton outside for our daugthers...
Desiree and Mikiah make you feel rigth at home, full of attentions."
3251016,18541146,2014-08-28,13745665,Christina,"We had a very nice stay in the Alki Beach Bungalow.  Great location to restaurants and bars as well as public transportation to get into the city.  The bungalow was equipped with everything we needed to feel at home, with a lovely deck and garden to enjoy.  We will definitely stay at the bungalow again when back in Seattle to visit.  Thanks for the hospitality, Desiree!"
3251016,20429864,2014-09-29,20222224,Anna,"We loved our stay at Alki beach and only wish we could have stayed longer!  Desiree looked after every detail! The house is very cozy...complete with User Guide and the location is perfect! An easy walk to the beach and good restaurants, Dart service and water taxi to downtown.  Would definitely stay here again!"
3251016,25403049,2015-01-14,25688412,David,The reservation was canceled 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3251016,41571223,2015-08-08,5877471,Julie,Desiree was very helpful and even stopped by to be sure we had everything we needed. She was very kine. The house is a  fun place to stay near the Alki Beach action. 
3251016,45926068,2015-09-07,2105064,Leila,Our family of four had a wonderful stay at the Alki bungalow.  The house was well equipped with everything we needed including beach chairs and towels.  Everything was very clean.  The beds were comfortable and the neighborhood was quiet and within walking distance to many of the Alki attractions and restaurants.  We very much enjoyed walking the waterfront both in the day and night hours and felt very safe.  We would not hesitate to stay there in the future!  
4111137,25505952,2015-01-18,24950394,帆,"Very good location and Eula is very welcoming. Our check in time is very late cause the flight, at mid night, and she still wait for us to make sure everything is good. It's a very good experience, though is only two days. Hope to have chance see you next time. :)"
4111137,42627264,2015-08-14,10894088,Carolyn,"Eula was very flexible about our arrival time. Apartment was clean but more on the ""lived in"" end of the scale. (Not a criticism, but people have varying preferences about this.). Bathroom was in very good condition, newly remodeled, bed was comfortable to sleep in and there were a variety of types of pillows. The place had a nice vibe and we were very satisfied with our choice."
4111137,43423209,2015-08-19,2034270,Rachael,"Great little place! I didn't meet Eula, but everything was easy and as described. We loved the neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again!"
4111137,44342530,2015-08-25,40442912,Leah,"We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was comfortable and Eula was great in letting us know everything we needed to in advance, and for leaving everything prepared for us. Also, the neighbourhood is awesome --- it's a beautiful area and it's easy to get around via public transit.  "
4111137,48613551,2015-09-27,824483,Jon,"Best air bnb ever, great location, even better hostess"
4111137,49458706,2015-10-04,22664344,Rebecca,Eula's apartment was great! Located in a cute residential neighborhood with all the amenities you might need. A great stay!
4111137,50667212,2015-10-13,5327684,Aurélia,"L'hôte (Eula) a été dès la réservation très prévenante. Elle a tout fait pour faciliter notre arrivée, notre avion arrivait bien avant l'heure de check-in, elle nous a quand même laissé les clés afin que l'on puisse déposer nos valises. Tout au long de notre séjour, Eula a eu pleins d'attentions pour notre fille et pour nous. Et elle nous a dépanné à plusieurs reprises. En bref, elle a tout fait pour que notre séjour soit agréable. L'appartement se trouve dans un quartier résidentiel, calme, à côté d'un supermarché et des lignes de bus en direction de Downtown.  L'appartement dispose d'une terrasse super agréable pour prendre son café le matin et en face se trouve un playground pour enfants."
4111137,51445426,2015-10-20,42938684,Kalvin,Did not meet Eula but she communicated well and answered all questions we had.  Apartment was as described and pictured and we had no issues.
4111137,51783186,2015-10-24,536748,Rachelle,"Eula was an incredible host. The mother-in-law suite is perfect for a pair or flying solo - it has everything you need. Plus the fun tchotchkes and inspirational quotes all over the home will make you feel right at home. There are lots of really fun places right in the neighborhood - ask Eula for any tips, she knows it all!!"
4111137,52242121,2015-10-27,8538664,Vasy,"The place is a real gem. Easily fits a couple with comfort. Very cozy! We enjoyed one of the rainy nights just staying in,cozying up and watching TV:) 
It's clean, has everything you need and had a very nice little deck. The area around the building is very lush with trees and plants, and has a small park right there- very quiet, I really had a great night sleep there:)
Eula was very responsive and helpful, even though we haven't had a chance to meet. 
I really enjoyed little notes scattered all around the apartment- really made me smile:) definitely will stay again if it's available in a future. And yes, I would recommend it to anyone."
4111137,54261728,2015-11-17,47285366,Paul Robert,"Eula was set and ready for us.  Great neighborhood and parking was a breeze.  Everything was clear for us, the apartment was comfortable, even the sleeper sofa was good.  We'll have to hit it again when the sun is shining to enjoy the park and the deck."
4111137,54937078,2015-11-25,48985680,Alin,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. The apartment was very clean and had everything we needed. The location was also very well, we could either walk downtown or take a bus. Thank you, Eula!!"
4111137,56806693,2015-12-18,5042137,Virginia,"Eula's place was great - perfect location and a laid-back, friendly space. There was plenty of street parking, and the apartment is nice and spacey. We had three of us staying, so two slept in the bedroom and the couch folds out to a giant bed which one of us slept in. There's a giant TV connected to Netflix and Amazon Prime which we made good use of. The space is really well heated, and there's a cute veranda. We met Eula once in person, but before that she gave us heaps of great recommendations for things to do in Seattle, including all the best food at Pike Place markets. She made us feel very welcome, she's a fantastic host. The only (potential) con about the place is the heating system brings in the air from surrounding apartments, including the smell of pot. I don't mind it at all, but one of us is a little sensitive to smells and didn't enjoy it too much. Location was fantastic - super close to supermarkets and everything else you need, including a bus downtown, and some nice coffee shops etc."
4111137,57165566,2015-12-22,6839555,Katie,"I really liked this place!  It was in a great neighborhood with great eats not far away.  Eula and Marvin were very wonderful when we got to meet them. I would stay here again!
"
4111137,58275558,2016-01-02,11463861,Katherine,"We visited during the holidays but we found the place very comfortable and homey! I stayed with three other friends, and we had plenty of space to rest. 

The balcony added a nice touch!"
175576,388235,2011-07-21,111078,Taberah Joy,"Ray accommodated me at the very last moment and I am so very grateful.  Ray and Eileen's house is beautiful and Ray has done much of the work himself.  The basement apartment is not as grand as the rest of the house but it is quite sufficient.  

Queen Anne is a lovely neighborhood.  A long walk or 20 minute bus ride to downtown.  It's very close to Fremont.  (Also Ballard though I did not make it there during my short stay.)  I only stayed one night on very short notice.  Because I was their first guest and they were in the process of setting everything up, they even offered me dinner.  "
175576,392082,2011-07-23,107738,Sean,"Best airbnb experience yet.  In all the big things, they delivered (and then some). Great shower, provided a whole bunch of amenities, and peace and quiet.  It was easy to find the place, the location wasn't far off the beaten path, and the internet was blazing fast.  But they provided a whole bunch of tiny little extras that made the place so over-the-top worthwhile.  Chocolate bars in the morning (!!), a small breakfast in a basket .. i dunno, this place was super cool. 

Ray, the host, was interesting, but also totally non-intrusive.  He let me do my thing, was totally accommodating, and even let me stay a little bit longer on my last day as I was putting out fires at work.  

If I had to stay in Seattle again, I would stay here.  Don't hesitate to book."
175576,397010,2011-07-25,837164,Brian,"Staying with Ray and Eileen was perfect for my weekend in Seattle. The apartment is very clean and had everything I needed for comfort and convenience. The home is quiet and has no pets. My hosts could not have been more friendly or helpful. I also enjoyed the Queen Anne neighborhood: lovely homes and yards, lots of restaurants and two grocery stores nearby. I would be very happy to stay here again."
175576,405152,2011-07-29,82441,Eric,"This quaint rental is in an amazing neighborhood. Food, drink, banks, spas, views...Queen Anne has it all. Everything is as represented. The communication was great and there are thoughtful little touches throughout. Not a hotel feel....more like you are staying with helpful relatives. Thanks so much to R & E!"
175576,407838,2011-07-30,880833,Corey,Ray wasn't there but sent me an email.  I got in after meeting up with folks at pubs and crashed out immediately.  I was delighted that they had free wifi available and the space was more than enough for a couple.  
175576,425012,2011-08-06,912564,Steve And Michael,"We had an excellent AirBnB experience at Ray's place. The space is quite comfortable and cozy with a separate bedroom and nice little kitchen. Ray is a very friendly host - he oftered excellent suggestions for restaurants and things to do.

We thought the location was terrific - right in the middle of the Queen Anne neighborhood, close to lots of shops and restaurants. We recommend breakfast at the Portlandia - just a few blocks away. Ray can give directions.

Also, Ray's place is almost walking distance to the wonderful Fremont district with the famous bridge troll, Lenin's statue, town rocket etc. If you have not visited Fremont, do not miss it.

All in all, we heartily recommend Ray's place."
175576,439348,2011-08-12,843616,Soraya,"Great place to stay in a very nice area,. It's quite a big apartment with everything you need. The hosts are very friendly and helpful in any way they can. Would surely come back and stay with them!"
175576,458724,2011-08-19,850631,Mary,"I loved my stay in this charming and comfortable one bedroom apartment.   SO much better than staying in an unmemorable hotel.   It is located in a charming victorian style home in a great older neighborhood called Queen Anne.  The location is so convenient to downtown Seattle that I actually walked to all the sights. Many interesting shops and restaurants just a couple of blocks away, even my old standby Trader Joes.   Ray and Eileen are really neat people and were so attentive to making my stay comfortable....even left a basket of snacks, coffee/tea and a glass of OJ and milk in the fridge as a welcome.    The apartment has a private entrance and is nicely furnished (including antiques) and has everything you need including full kitchen, a great big dining area, living room, cable tv, bedroom, bathroom with shower.  Bed so comfortable and place so quiet I slept like a rock.  Fast wireless internet and even an eliptical if so inclined.  Washer/dryer available for use.   Will be my first choice next time I'm in Seattle.  Don't hesitate to book this place, you won't regret!  Thanks again, Ray and Eileen."
175576,471079,2011-08-23,986498,Frank,"Ray was really friendly and welcoming. The place offered a lot of privacy, comfort and space. "
175576,472667,2011-08-24,937135,Karin,"We loved our stay at the Apt Suite on Queen Anne Hill.   Would have loved to have had more time to explore the neighborhood and chat with Ray and Eileen.   My daughter and I stayed one night.  We arrived early evening.  Ray greeted up right away, showed us around, and recommended an excellent Italian place to eat.  The food was delicious. The apt suite was very comfy and cozy, clean, etc.  We had to leave early the next morning to catch the Victoria Clipper to Victoria BC.  It was an easy 5 min drive.  Ray even printed us some maps. Would stay here again if we are in the area.  Thanks Ray and Eileen!

"
175576,489376,2011-08-30,1000291,Steve,"We stayed at Ray and Ilene's lovely home in Queen Anne for a night after traveling around OR and WA. We were looking for a private place to stay in a cool neighborhood with a genuine Seattle feel -- and Ray and Ilene's place had it all. And, as an added bonus, they are such a friendly couple that you'll instantly feel right at home. "
175576,491343,2011-08-31,443834,Mark,"We wish we could have stayed here for more than one night. It was really nice to have a whole suite to ourselves, and Ray was extremely nice and accommodating. They really run the place like a B&B, with little brochures and maps  of the area. Their location isn't right downtown, but you could walk it in 30-45 minutes. The Queen Anne Hill area is very nice and quiet with plenty of places to eat nearby.  We had a great stay!"
175576,492784,2011-09-01,35137,Chelsea,"Wonderful host and perfect location!  Ray recommended a pasta place for dinner and a diner the next morning for breakfast, they were both delicious and a block away.  
The apartment was nice and cozy and there were lots of little amenities that we appreciated, milk for our coffee, coffee, tea, snacks.  He really went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable!
Parking was free with a zone guest pass which was very appreciated!
Will definitely stay again!
"
175576,562067,2011-09-24,940683,Lynn And Lori,"We really enjoyed staying at Ray and Eileens basement apartment.  We felt at home with them immediately.  They were available to help answer any questions we had and their apartment was VERY comfortable and QUIET, as well as private.
"
175576,611543,2011-10-09,1128561,William,"Ray has put a lot of effort into making the place super convenient and comfortable, and it sure shows.  Pre-arrival communication and getting there were a breeze, as was connecting to the internet.  A great assortment of travel guides was crowned by a home-made map of local restaurants and stores.  Ray and Eileen were available to answer any questions or take care of a need, but at the same time, they gave us plenty of privacy.  The whole experience felt like a home away from home.  In fact, I'm kind of missing that delightful mattress right now..."
175576,645463,2011-10-19,1155451,Lee,Ray & Eileen are enthusiastic & welcoming hosts & were quick to help us whenever we needed anything. It's a cozy and quiet basement apartment.  A great location--close to bus stops where we could get routes all over the  Seattle area & suburbs. We also enjoyed some of the delicious neighborhood dining spots.
175576,657871,2011-10-24,1132444,Katie,Ray and Eileen were wonderful hosts.  The apartment was immaculate and cozy with many personal touches that were very nice.  We appreciated all of the literature on things to do in Seattle and in the Queen Anne neighborhood.  The house is located two blocks from a bus stop to take you downtown--we didn't use our car all weekend.  We enjoyed coming home to a warm apartment after a day of exploring instead of an anonymous hotel.  We will certainly stay here during our next visit to Seattle!
175576,698379,2011-11-07,377161,Tammy,"Ray and Eileen are a wonderful, engaging couple.  They kindly provided local maps and a guest parking pass.  The apartment is nicely stocked with everything needed to make you comfortable.  Great location for visiting SPU."
175576,710390,2011-11-11,1274715,Adam,"First off, fantastic hosts. You could not ask for friendlier or helpful people than Ray and Eileen.
The place is awesome. Spacious, clean, warm, with everything you could need. In a great area close to transport and shops, and about a half hour walk into town. Very scenic.
Could not ask for more. and I would not hesitate to recommend this place...
Brilliant!"
175576,719491,2011-11-14,1383394,Melody,"All the good reviews are true! It was a great location, clean, looked as presented on-line. Ray was great, very informative,helpful, and kind. It was a terrible Nov. weather weekend but we still had a fabulous time! Although the bus times varied which is not great in bad weather, it was very nice to park the car and get around without it. We will return next summer to see more of Seattle and will try to stay at Ray's again!"
175576,730668,2011-11-19,308807,Nancy,"This was perfect for my husband and me on a ""Work Trip"" overnight in Seattle - Ray and Eileen were warm and welcoming and their suite was nicely equipped and very comfortable for us to have a quiet evening ""at home"".  The location is perfect for anything around Seattle and Ray was a great host."
175576,768982,2011-12-06,1460051,Andrew,"This basement appartment was perfect as a home away from home for my girlfriend and I when we visited Seattle for the first time. It is just as described. We found it to be clean, tidy and comfortable. We hit gold when it came to the neighbourhood. It's located in a quiet leafy street that backs on to many cool restaurants, cafes and shops. Ray was the perfect host and eventhough he lives up above, the appartment below is very private. Ray gave us great advice about where to eat and bus services. I hope to stay again."
175576,814898,2011-12-30,341248,Laura,"Had a wonderful stay with Ray and Eileen over Christmas. They even provided a small Christmas tree and holiday decorations to make our stay so special! The apartment is very comfortable, with a full kitchen, cozy living area, and the most comfortable bed. It is in a convenient, pretty, quiet and safe neighborhood. Hope to stay there again when I travel to Seattle! "
175576,819267,2011-12-31,1546958,Esther,We could not have asked for a better first airbnb experience. Ray is the epitome of a welcoming host. It is clear that he loves hosting people and is constantly improving the apartment. We loved exploring Queen Anne and even walked from the apartment to the public market. The best part about our stay was being able to park on Ray's street. This really saved us a fortune as parking can be expensive and hard to come by in Seattle. Thank you Ray for welcoming us to the airbnb community! 
175576,825245,2012-01-02,1089492,Maro,"Very friendly hosts, the suite was great! Very comfortable bed. With three rooms, there's space to just relax if you want to. The hosts are well organized, with maps and guides for the neighborhood. The neighborhood itself is charming, with restaurants and all the shops you could want. Be sure to check out the overlook! "
175576,849955,2012-01-08,1510281,Pablo,"Beautiful little basement unit. Ray and Eileen are super friendly, helpful, and cool. Amazing neighborhood with great restaurants, very easy to get downtown (10 minutes by bus). If I went back to Seattle I would not even look for other places, I would just get in touch with Ray."
175576,946914,2012-02-24,1781131,Rob,"Quick stay in Seattle on business & leisure.  This was my first time using AirBnB so I was a bit nervous but it was a great experience.
Ray responded very quickly to my booking inquiry (I was already in the city) and met me to let me in.
Ray was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The guest suite is very comfortable and has all amenities as listed.  
I felt as welcome as a friend visiting from out of town and would definitely recommend the guest suite. 
It's a fairly long walk from Pike Place & Belltown but very convenient to a great strip of N. Queen Ave.  Definitely try the 5-point diner (i think that was it) for great breakfast and El Diablo Coffee Co."
175576,1054094,2012-03-27,1995315,Jean,Our host were so fantastic. They met us as we came in at a late on a Sunday night. They have so much information to make your stay in their lovely guest suite a great experience. I would love to stay there again soon!
175576,1078878,2012-04-03,924136,Ila And Fred,"Wonderful hosts, wonderful location, cozy private apartment with all the amenities you could ask for.  I would gladly stay again if I visit Seattle!"
175576,1120095,2012-04-12,2032402,Sue,"We are newbies to airbnb and this is the first place we stayed in using this site.  It was great - Ray is a great host.  He is affable, problem-solving, kind and thoughtful.  There was milk and non-dairy in the refrigerator for coffee, a can of coffee and coffee pot for our morning fix and the kitchen was fully stocked with dishes/pots/pans.

The TV was hooked up to cable and there were comfortable chairs and a daybed to sit on to watch TV or read the paper.  A buffet held copies of Seattle magazine, the round dining table had visitors guides, lists of favorite places and other information Ray and his wife had left for a guest's use.

It was a bit daunting for me to go up the narrow concrete steps at the front of this lovely home (Ray is installing a handrail), so he kindly offered us his garage door key so we could enter through the alley behind the house.  I never did use it - I figured it was good exercise to go up those front steps.

The bathroom is tiny but adequate - we spent little time in this little apartment - but it was so nice to come home to a warm, cozy place with its own side entrance and caring hosts."
175576,1162851,2012-04-22,1839180,Holly,"Highly recommend! This was a lovely stay. It is in a finished basement, but the way houses seem to work in this neighborhood, it doesn't feel basement-y. Ray is so nice and very helpful. We had a little trouble with our rental car, so he gave us a ride back to the airport to pick up another one. He also provided some milk in the apartment refrigerator for our first morning. The apartment itself is comfy. The only downside might be that the bathroom is on the small side. Pretty much all items are provided, even if not listed in the description (i.e., a hair dryer.) Parking is on the street, but it wasn't hard to find a spot. The neighborhood has some great restaurants/bars within 2-3 blocks. A color-coded map of nearby places is provided by Ray. Separate controls for the heater are available in the rental space. I assume it is the same for AC. Before leaving, all we had to do was clean up the kitchen and its items. No towel or sheet laundry necessary by the visitors."
175576,1182604,2012-04-25,2179224,Steffen,"Really nice there! 
Seperate entrance
kind host
everything was cleane
Perfect location for vacation"
175576,1230378,2012-05-05,1846376,Chieko,"Very cozy, quiet suite in a great location. Easy access to everything we wanted. We were welcomed with a quick rundown of the area and the suite. Ray made himself available to answer our questions and was very helpful in letting us know about how to get places or to recommend restaurants, etc. We would check to see if Ray and Eileen first before we stayed anywhere else in Seattle in the future."
175576,1241918,2012-05-07,1228038,Dana,"I recently stayed in the Guest Suite for one weekend night during a short trip to Seattle.  This was a very pleasant experience.  The location was perfect and I had a solid night of peaceful sleep.  I loved the amenities, everything so convenient and thoughtful.   There is even a Trader Joe grocer 3 blocks away.  Ray and Ilene were great!  Ray even brought down a tea kettle for me when he heard I enjoyed tea over coffee.  Ilene was very kind to take some time to chat while she was doing some gardening.  I felt right at home even though I was here just a short while.  I would definitely stay here again.   "
175576,1248579,2012-05-08,515348,Sunni,"My husband and I needed a place to stay for just one night that was close to downtown Seattle. Ray's charming basement apartment was a perfect choice!  It was cozy, comfortable and convenient to downtown and nearby restaurants within walking distance.  In a charming, quiet neighborhood with many other historic homes, and a park just a half a block away, it was very nice  place to relax.. Plus, like others have mentioned, the bed was wonderful!  Ray and his wife were very charming and hospitable, and I would highly recommend their Airbnb to anyone needing a place to stay in Seattle!"
175576,1285239,2012-05-15,2121083,Laura,"We had a great stay! Suite was quiet, cozy and spacious, and I can't forget to mention that the bed was super comfy. Ray and Eileen were super friendly. Location was fantastic to get to Seattle Center and there was lots of small shops and restaurants around the corner. Oh, and for families a great park and playground is located at the end of the street. Thanks for having us!"
175576,1304238,2012-05-19,1168466,Anthony,"We had a great time at Ray's home. The private apartment is seriously amazing. It has everything you will need on a vacation and more. It blew us away how much space we had. You never have a kitchen, dining room, and a living room when you stay at a hotel. Ray was so helpful not only in person but the apartment is full of maps, guides, suggestions etc. (all designed by Ray himself!) It was only a 10 minute drive to all the famous attractions, or if you wanted to stay in the area, Queen Anne has a lot of good restaurants as well. The bus stop is also just a 2 minute walk away if you don't want to deal with the downtown traffic. Staying here is a must if you are visiting Seattle.  "
175576,1334139,2012-05-23,92561,Janeen,"Location, location, location!!!  My daughter and I had a wonderful four-day stay with Ray and Eileen. They are the perfect hosts; informative and helpful without being intrusive.  Ray has all the information you will need to guide you from the apartment to the Queen Anne neighborhood and beyond.  The neighborhood begins one block from the apartment and is very walkable, with everything you need.  The bus line is very close and takes you straight into downtown, within minutes, for all the major site seeing.  The apartment is very cozy, with a full apt. size kitchen, very nice bathroom, and a separate bedroom with a very nice bed.  Should you need it, the couch in the living room make a wonderful bed!  If you have a broken suitcase, Ray can probably fix it!  Wonderful people and a wonderful place to stay!!!"
175576,1399104,2012-06-02,1698192,Bodo,"We had a wonderful time in Rays&Eileens lovely and cosy Queen Anne Hill Apartment. Seattle Center is just in walking distance and nearby Kerry park gives us a spectacular view of Seattle skyline.
We enjoyed 50th anniversary of the 1962 Seattle World’s
fair celebrations, like Northwest Folklife Festival and much more.
We love Seattle!


"
175576,1473463,2012-06-13,2216345,Philip,"This apartment was in a awesome location near many great restaurants on Queen Ann Blvd. and other streets.  Also the space was great and provided us with plenty of room feeling like a second home. The host, Ray,  gave us some great information on the bus routes which we used to make trips downtown to avoid parking hassles. I would stay here again on a return trip and also recommended it to our Seattle relatives for their out of town guests."
175576,1522092,2012-06-20,1961268,Karen,"Ray and Eileen were amazing hosts!  The apartment was very cozy, clean and comfortable.  We felt right at home.  I would definitely recommend booking a stay here.  It was so nice to get the neighborhood feel of staying in an actual residence.  There are plenty of restaurants a grocery store and pubs within walking distance.  We had a great time!"
175576,1547629,2012-06-24,2205831,Katy,"Comfortable beds, warm and cozy in the Seattle rain. Close walk to eats and drinks and the Seattle Center. Friendly hosts!"
175576,1701347,2012-07-13,2907791,Jake,"Ray and Eileen were great.  When I arrived, Ray was sitting on the front porch and welcomed me with a great smile and some even better conversation.  The space was just as they explained in the description. 

It's in a wonderful neighborhood with some extremely good food just a couple of blocks away.  I'd recommend eating at How to Cook a Wolf.  

I would recommend this spot to anyone who is staying in Queen Anne."
175576,1745171,2012-07-19,2194759,Michelle,"We had a wonderful stay in Seattle. Ray and Eileen are the perfect hosts - very friendly and always happy to stop and chat and help out with queries (Ray has a keen eye for the weather). The Guest Suite is located in the smart neighbourhood of Queen Anne and is only a two-minute walk to lots of restaurants, bars and shops. It is well connected to downtown with several bus routes and it's just a 30 minute walk to the Space Needle. The Guest Suite is super cosy and had everything we needed, including a whole host of maps, bus timetables and up-to-date guides on Seattle, which was great for exploring the city. We would love to come back and would highly recommend Ray and Eileen's Guest Suite to anyone wishing to visit Seattle."
175576,1925849,2012-08-08,2101197,Liam,"Great place to stay. Very private, close to some great eating and drinking spots. The Cab to the space needle cost $6. Didn't get to meet Eileen as we only stayed one night but Ray was a very welcoming and happy guy. We were very happy with our stay."
175576,2071671,2012-08-23,2575236,Shelley,"We had a great time and appreciated all the helpful information Ray provided. He was very friendly and answered all our questions, and was always available if we needed anything. The apartment is cozy and has everything you need - small kitchen, bathroom, washer/dryer use, etc. It was just the two of us staying there, so it was just about perfect size. Also, we loved the location being so close to Trader Joe's and the bus stop and Queen Ann Ave!!! This definitely made it 5 stars for us, as we weren't home that much and did not have a car; being close to everything was great. 
The apartment is a basement apartment but it did not feel super dark or anything...and, It was especially great on hot summer days as the apt stayed nice and cool. They also have a lovely yard with chairs so we were able to relax outside if we wanted to enjoy the sunshine.
We really enjoyed our stay and will definitely stay here again if we're back in the area! "
175576,2138717,2012-08-29,585981,Howie,"My son, his friend and I just stayed at Ray and Eileen's place this week.
It was terrific. Ray was very helpful in getting us set up and the Queen Ann location was terrific. It's a great deal for the price. It's a basement apartment so natural light is a bit scarce but heck, it's Seattle.
I would definately use this place again."
175576,2204933,2012-09-05,2430470,Joshua,"Confortable space, great location, accomidating and fabulous hosts!"
175576,2271322,2012-09-12,1946015,Laura,"Ray and Eileen were friendly, thoughtful and helpful hosts. Their home is very convenient to public transportation, and in a quiet and beautiful neighborhood. We walked to and from the grocery store, and to a really fun restaurant with great food. My husband and I were in town for a family wedding and we were out late several nights of our stay--they kept the lights on for us--so nice. There was lots of tourism information provided in our room, and wifi as well. This was our first time to use airbnb, and it couldn't have gone more perfectly. I would recommend Ray and Eileen's place to anyone wanting a lovely place to stay in Seattle! "
175576,2372027,2012-09-22,3402800,Scott,"Gracious hosts, tidy and comfortable apartment.  This is a winner.  "
175576,2407521,2012-09-25,236586,Monika,"The apartment was very cosy and clean, located in a great neighborhood, and only 15 bus minutes away from downtown.
Ray and Eileen were very welcoming and helpful hosts. Honestly, you won't need Yelp or Google - just ask Ray :) 
I really enjoyed my long weekend in Seattle and would definitely stay here again! "
175576,2449000,2012-09-29,751130,Meg,"Ray and Eileen were great hosts for a weary, working traveler. The apartment is cozy and convenient, and I would definitely stay again!
Thank you so much!

175576,2484425,2012-10-02,1981155,Sven,"I can highly recommend staying with Ray & Eileen. The apartment is very nice and we enjoyed staying there for our weekend trip to Seattle. The location is good, close to the wonderful Kerry Park which offers a wonderful view over the city. I cannot think of anything to complain about and  would like to thank Ray & Eileen for the friendly hospitality."
175576,2570424,2012-10-10,2969309,Jan,"Great location in Queen Ann neighborhood, clean,  reasonably priced and terrific hosts."
175576,2606332,2012-10-14,2842371,Rachel,Excellent Hosts with fantastic attention to detail.  From the moment we arrived we were welcomed into their home.  Ray provided insightful information about the community and neighborhood and offered resourceful direction that made our stay amazing.
175576,2622729,2012-10-15,3766922,Jon,"Had a great stay with Ray and Eileen.  It was like staying at a relative's house who happen to have a finished apartment in the basement.  Ray was very engaging and was more than willing to help out wherever he could.

About the apartment, there is a small kitchenette along with a living room with a sofa and table with chairs.  Then there is the bedroom with a comfy bed and nice pillows.  

Everything you could ask for at a fraction of the price of a Seattle hotel!"
175576,2715488,2012-10-25,2343011,Rilla,"Had a lovely time staying with Ray & Eileen in their Queen Anne suite. The maps, info and special touches made our stay so memorable and the location was great. Although the weather was cold and rainy, we always knew we had somewhere warm and cozy to come home to. Thank you for your excellent hospitality, we hope to stay with you next time we are in Seattle!"
175576,2763099,2012-10-30,3720815,Cori,"We definitely enjoyed our stay in this cozy basement suite in a popular neighborhood.  It is a cool old Victorian that Ray estimated to be built around 1904.  It had convenient access to the bus system (super easy to use) and it is not far from the main downtown area (Space Needle, Fish Market, etc.) and easy launching off point for other neighborhoods such as Fremont and Ballard.  Both the immediate and surrounding Seattle area are walkable - we walked to downtown one day.  A block away is Queen Anne Avenue, which had a ton of cute shops and restaurants if you are looking to stay closer to home base.  Ray and Eileen were friendly and helpful, but were not intrusive.  I felt quite safe and secure with both our hosts and the area.  The apartment itself is comfortable and has all the amenities you would potentially need.  The kitchen is fully stocked, so if you were planning to stay for a longer time and wanted to be frugal and eat in, this would be the perfect place.  There is a Safeway and Trader's Joe within walking distance.  They provide a ton of information, including maps, magazines, and brochures to use as resources about the region.  We chose this option because of the location, the past reviews, and because we wanted to experience a real neighborhood instead of a boring hotel in a touristy area.  It did not disappoint and was probably less expensive.  Also, we had a last minute flight cancellation, and our hosts were gracious and flexible in helping accommodate us last minute for one additional night."
175576,2852913,2012-11-10,1873639,Carey,"Seamless directions, huge space, easy to go to and from. Wish we stayed longer!"
175576,2860079,2012-11-11,1383394,Melody,"This was our second time to stay at Ray and Eileen's! It was so good the first time we had to come back, and I am sure we will be back again the next time we want to visit Seattle! The suite is perfect and has new frying pans in the kitchen that we really appreciated using :> Ray and Eileen are fabulous hosts and always supply us with great bits of info. to help make our stay even better. Thanks again!"
175576,2980363,2012-11-27,2656923,Will,"Ray and Eileen were warm and welcoming hosts. The apartment was clean, spacious and quiet, the perfect place to retire to after running around town. The location was ideal, close to many great restaurants and walking distance to downtown. Would recommend it to anyone in a heartbeat. "
175576,3151090,2012-12-24,814057,Linda,"Ray and Eileen were friendly, welcoming hosts for a short trip to Seattle before Christmas. The location is great, close to downtown and bus routes that head everywhere, as well as all of the great shopping and food options on top of QA hill. The guest suite is such a nice retreat to come back to after exploring the city! "
175576,3183182,2012-12-29,21854,Holly,"I recently met a man in Vancouver and we decided to spend Christmas together in Seattle since I live in California and he had only a few days off. We walked into the apartment and it was so cutely decorated for Christmas I actually got a little choked up since many of the decorations were the same as my grandmothers who I recently lost. Ray and Eileen were so lovely and extremely organized, they made themselves available to us for anything we might need and had the apartment stocked with local info and tips on things to do and see! The apartment is close to everything and we got a parking pass for our car so we didn't have to worry about getting tickets. The apartment has everything you need and a separate entrance from the main house so you feel very independent. This is my first AirBnB rental and I am super  thrilled with our experience. "
175576,3650240,2013-02-27,4881651,Sarah Kiomi,"We really enjoyed our stay at Ray & Eileen's cozy suite. The location can not be beat! They're within walking distance to great little restaurants on The Ave, Kerry Park, the Space Needle, downtown shopping and even a Trader Joe's! (Be aware of the gigantic hill you will have to walk up if you do decide to walk home!) The bus routes are also very convenient and close by. Ray was so friendly and full of information about the city and their home. As everyone else had mentioned, the bed is SO comfortable! It was hard not to sleep in (especially with the cool weather and rain)! We would definitely stay here again!"
175576,4143536,2013-04-13,308807,Nancy,My daughter and I had a perfect 2-day stay while apartment hunting for her move to Seattle in June.  It was a great location and we enjoyed the easy access to Queen Ann Ave. as well as to comfort and convenience in the apt.  Ray and Eileen were great and it was nice to see them again.  This was a repeat stay!
175576,4218243,2013-04-19,2592419,Margo,Ray and Eileen were just wonderful hosts to my stay at their BnB.  Their place was so nice and clean and comfortable.

175576,4266725,2013-04-23,2294935,Nancy,"Ray and Eileen provided all we needed to make a non-extraordinary visit to Seattle restful. Ray was affable and eager to give help when needed.  Queen Anne Hill is such a beautiful location, and their home is so close to Trader Joe's, Caffe Fiore, Top Pot, a park, and bus stops, you couldn't ask for much more.  There is always open space for parking on the street and they loaned us their zone parking permit while we were there.  They are great hosts!"

older building room was clean private basement aparmemt . 
its designed in bed and breakfast style  im more of a modern man myself . but all in all it did the job . a little north of downtown and kinda pricey  . but i reccomend if you have a family or friend who want to stay with you.  hope this was helpful thanks ."

Only warning to future guests is that, if you turn on the heater, there might be a repetitive clicking noise every few seconds once it reaches the temperature you set -- I'd recommend using extra blankets instead! Otherwise a very wonderful stay. :)"
175576,5259921,2013-06-21,3466791,Pamela,Ray and Eileen were great hosts! The basement apartment was incredibly clean and comfortable. Queen Anne is a great neighbourhood and we particularly loved Ray's recommendation of the 5 spot cafe for brunch! Thanks again for a great stay in Seattle.

A short bus ride to downtown, across the street from a great park and one block over from tons of restaurants and shops. The apartment was clean and homey. Ray and Eileen were friendly and helpful. It was nice having a kitchenette and with Trader Joe's just down the street it was perfect.  It was our first time using airbnb and we will definitely use the site again! "
175576,5644402,2013-07-09,6930777,J Douglas,"Nice basement appartment, close to all downtown.  Hosts gave us plenty of advice about restaurants and things to do.  Was the perfect place to stay in Seattle.  "
175576,5714981,2013-07-13,1434214,Shelley,"Ray and Eileen's place in Queen Anne is lovely. Ray was a great host, he had a lot of information on sights and attractions in Seattle, he had even done a street map of local restaurants in their area! It is really easy to catch the bus which takes you right into the city/to attractions. It is also a great walk down the hill to the Space Needle. The place was clean, neat and tidy and very private. You must try the  chocolate from chocolopolis in Queen Anne Ave it is to die for!!!! Thank you for a wonderful stay Ray and Eileen"
175576,5802011,2013-07-16,2191564,Rory,"We booked an overnight last minute. Ray was super quick to respond, and very helpful. The apartment had everything we needed. The best part is the neighborhood. One block from the main strip, we had access to many restaurants, grocery and beautiful parks. We will be staying here next time we make a trip to Seattle. "
175576,5842009,2013-07-19,4729721,Karin,"My daughter and I spent three nights in Ray and Eileen's basement suite. Ray was a great host, he even prepared a street map of local restaurants in the Queen Anne's area. There were also a lot of information on sights and attractions in Seattle, Bus timetable and a maps of Seattle. From the near Kerry Park we enjoyed a great panoramic view of Seattle and it was also a great walk down the hill to the Space Needle. The place was clean and very comfortable.
"
175576,5964004,2013-07-24,6326174,Linda,"Great location in beautiful Queen Anne and close to many good restaurants and markets. The apt. is a bit crowded with furnishings and knick-knacks and noise from the upstairs (conversations and TV) are easily heard. The hosts were very welcoming and helpful, though, and the price is very reasonable. We greatly enjoyed our stay."

We really enjoyed out stay with Ray and Eileen. They were there if you needed them but gave you privacy also. The apartment was homey, comfortable and clean. We were very close to where our daughter lived and that was great. Queen Anne is a  beautiful area to stay in when visiting Seattle It gives you that small neighborhood feel with still being close to the downtown, Lots of restaurants and  the bus station is very near. We would definitely stay with them again when visiting Seattle. "
175576,6198654,2013-08-03,7293055,Leesa,"As a first time airbnb user, I booked this suite for my daughter and two friends for a night prior to their stay at SPU.  The location of this suite was perfect...less than 5 minutes to the university.  Communication with Ray was very prompt and helpful - he also made a point of being home to personally welcome them upon arrival.  The suite itself was easily accessed, charming, very clean, quiet, and comfortable.  The wifi was appreciated. Due to some vehicle issues, a wrench was needed and Ray accommodated their request immediately.   We would not hesitate to book again if needing a place to stay in Seattle."
175576,6609215,2013-08-19,4393292,Marnie,Our stay was quite comfortable and very quiet.  All amenities were provided us.
175576,6725549,2013-08-22,8260766,Michelle,"Ray and Eileen hosted my parents who came from Portland. 
From the moment I requested a reservation, their responsiveness was quick, welcoming and helpful. 
The apartment was located in one of my favorite neighborhoods in Seattle and we were able to walk to our restaurant choice easily. 
I will definitely call on these wonderful Seattleites to host visiting family and friends in the future!"
175576,6741022,2013-08-23,7634167,Martha,Ray and Eileen were great hosts! The place was not only clean but very thoughtfully decorated and accoutered. Thanks so much!

Ray & Eilee were very nice and friendly, they recommended us some good restaurants and hiking trails, we really enjoyed it and we definitely, recommend this place."
175576,7113736,2013-09-07,871506,Stephen,"Great apartment in an older established quiet neighborhood within walking distance to the beautiful Queen Ann Restaurant’s and shops and less than half of what you would pay for a downtown hotel.   They provided maps and information on all the attractions in the area and gave us recommendations of places to eat based on our interests.  We stayed here for one night before our Alaska cruise, and would not hesitate to stay here longer if we were in the Seattle area again."
175576,7152205,2013-09-08,8651818,Emily,"We travelled from Portland to Seattle just for one night, and this beautiful basement apartment suite was the perfect place to stay! A true home away from home - a comfortable bedroom with closet space, television, living room, magazines, dining area, full kitchen, restroom, plus information about exploring Seattle, Queen Anne, etc. Wish we had stayed longer!"
175576,7790331,2013-10-03,7723732,Polly,"Ray and Eileen's place is in a great location in Queen Anne-nice, quiet neighborhood in close proximity to all the shops and restaurants. Parking was always available right in front of the house. There is an entrance on the side of the house to the private apartment. Eileen responded quickly to my initial inquiry for the booking and Ray was there to greet us at check in. They provided lots of information about the area. Altogether, a great stay!

175576,7899241,2013-10-07,474203,Lori,"Great location. Great hosts. Comfortable apartment with all the amenities needed to enjoy your Seattle vacation. Ray is a great communicator and very accommodating. Thanks for the local papers, bus passes, and setting up the ironing board on short notice. My work trip turned into a mini-vacation. I enjoyed morning walks throughout Queen Anne Hill and easy access to great coffee and public transportation. I definitely recommend this location!"
175576,8206695,2013-10-21,1364407,Noreen,"First of all Ray and Eileen are very nice.  We needed a place that was close to my sons home and this location was perfect.  We could walk to his house, and it is close to the bus stop so we used the bus from time to time to go farther than walking distance. We ate at different restaurants right there on Queen Anne which is within walking distance and did some shopping at Trader Joes. I had a wonderful apple fritter at Top Pot and  shopped in the little shops in the area. Everything you need is right here.  We walked to Kerry Park, and sat on the bench looking at the fabulous skyline. The neighborhood is safe and lovely.  The apartment was the perfect size for both of us and I called it my home away from home.  Ray and Eileen were there if we needed something, but they gave us our privacy.  A plus is the washer and dryer we could use. I hope to come back and stay here again next year!  Thank you for providing a safe and nice place to stay."
175576,8350235,2013-10-27,6956937,Kristen,"Ray and Eileen's place looks exactly like the pictures, and they were great hosts. When we arrived Ray and Eileen talked to us for about a good half hour about things to do in the area, and which buses for us to take for things that were outside of walking distance. You can tell they've lived in Seattle for a long time because they had tons of suggestions for us. He also had a map of all restaurants, cafes, and grocery stores in the area. He assured us if we needed anything that we could just knock on the door, and ask any questions, which was nice for us because it was our first time to Seattle. Last, but definitely not least, they had a small basket of granola bars and tea for us to snack on! All in all they were great hosts, and I would definitely stay at their place again!"
175576,8513194,2013-11-03,2192726,Dorian,"Warm and friendly host and very comfortable, clean accommodation.  "
175576,8870090,2013-11-23,3402800,Scott,Wonderfully hosts!  Comfortable apartment with a great location.   I slept the best in weeks in the bed.  This was my second stay and I will return.

175576,9420803,2013-12-28,9111652,Jordan,This was a wonderful place to spend the holidays!  A perfect home away from home!
175576,12258631,2014-04-27,13893491,Timothy,"You've found your next spot. You can stop looking. 
Since Ray and Eileen are the most modest people I've ever met, I'll have to brag for them.
You don't need a car for anything. The location is prime. From the time I got off the plane to the moment I layed in the guest suite bed, I didn't have to walk more than 3 minutes. Whatever is too far to walk to (or if you dont wanna walk at all) Seattle public transit has you covered. Lightrail, bus, water taxi, monorail...etc. I walked to the Space Needle in 20 minutes since it was beautiful outside. You can take the bus and get there in. Kerry Park is 4 blocks away and has an amazing view of Seattle. 
Ray paraglides and has some amazing pictures and stories he'll share with you if you ask(theres a picture of him paragliding over Queen Anne Hill in the living room that's pretty cool). They let me check in early and check out late without batting an eye. Sweetest couple in Seattle if you ask me. They had me laughing throught our conversations. They truly go above and beyond without meaning to. They are genuinely caring people. I'm glad I picked to stay with them. They are great people to have met, and I can't wait to see them again. 
The suite is perfect. It has a private entrance so you can come and go as you please without having to worry about waking anyone up. It's basically an apartment all to yourself. I can't say enough good things about my time with Ray&Eileen."
175576,12445760,2014-05-02,13583697,Dave,Great host. Nice well kept basement apartment. Appreciate the free parking. 
175576,12883211,2014-05-13,5408155,Stephanie,"Ray and Eileen were very warm and helpful. They treated us like family. The apartment was like home, comfortable and well appointed. The neighborhood was quiet, tree-lined and filled with flowers. The location was very convenient to the shops on Queen Anne Ave."
175576,13176345,2014-05-21,1364407,Noreen,"This was the second time we stayed at this apartment on Queen Anne Hill.  This is such a nice place, and we feel at home here.  The apartment has everything you need to have a comfortable and safe place to stay.  We stayed there a week and loved it.  You have your own private entrance, a kitchen, a comfy bed, and all the comforts of home.  Queen Anne Hill is a beautiful place, and we were within walking distance to great food, shops and grocery stores, but most important for us, we were withing walking distance to my sons home.  Ray and Eileen are such nice people and they give you privacy and yet, they are there to help with anything you need.  I love staying in their little apartment and would stay there next time I am in Seattle.  Thank you Ray and Eileen for providing such a nice place for all who visit your wonderful city.  I look forward to seeing you again."
175576,13295731,2014-05-24,13243357,Wendy,"Ray, Eileen, and their place were perfect for our first airbnb experience, as well as our first trip to Seattle - their home is lovely, the suite cozy, and the location can't be beat! We were out and about most of the time so we didn't get to see much of them, but Ray gave us a thorough tour of the place upon check-in. I liked that we had our own separate entrance and privacy, but Ray and Eileen made sure to reiterate that they were just a knock away if we had any questions or needed anything. Everything was just as expected and we were quite comfortable during our stay - we would definitely stay here again. "
175576,13406703,2014-05-27,1705631,Kathleen,"We chose this airbnb because of the neighborhood and its proximity to downtown and Seattle Center. So the location was great. The apartment was darker than we expected, even when it was sunny. "
175576,13780633,2014-06-04,12551382,Sandy,"Seattle is a beautiful city:    we stayed here for four days after our cruise :  we noted  that some people on the cruise just flew in and out = we decided to fly in two days before cruise, and stay for four days after - and certainly not sorry.  We saw and did so much - and loved Seattle.    Great views, especially from Kerry Park, and the top of Columbia building - much higher than the Space Needle.  Sorry to leave the city.

Lovely area - very convenient to public transport: the area of the private apartment is perfect: close to bus routes, and very easy to find one's way around. Very quite, comfortable and clean indeed, and ideal for those not always wishing to stay in a hotel. Ray and Eileen very friendly and helpful, unfortunately we did not get to chat a lot, as we were out most of the time ! Would recommend and hopefully if we visit Seattle again we would stay there. Thank you   "
175576,13882874,2014-06-07,12845980,Patrick,"Had a wonderful time at Ray and Eileen's. They are sweet people with great recommendations a live 5 blocks from the best view in the city.

175576,14019756,2014-06-10,12962496,Deborah,Ray and Eileen were super nice and very accommodating. The apartment is in an amazing neighborhood. We would definitely stay here again when in Seattle. It is a nice central location with lots to do within walking distance.

It is also located near the shops, restaurants, and public transportation.  Ray and Eileen also gave great suggestions for restaurants and getting around the area.

Quiet, beautiful and just a quick bus ride away from all must see spots in the city. We will definetely stay here again when we come back to Seattle."
175576,16880863,2014-08-04,11188733,Michael,"The apartment was clean, cute, comfortable, quiet, and convenient. Ray quickly responded to my pre-stay inquiries and was super easy to work with both before and after I arrived. He and Eileen were the kind of hosts you hope for: friendly, approachable, helpful, and respectful of their guests' privacy. The neighborhood is charming, their house is welcoming, and my experience staying with them was very pleasant. I particularly liked that I had a suite of rooms with a private entrance, and that once Ray had welcomed me in and shown me around, he left me be to do my own thing. I would absolutely request to stay here again the next time I go to Seattle."
175576,17043233,2014-08-06,6370523,Tinka,We had a very nice stay with Ray and Eileen. The house is located on Seattle's hills in a very nice neighbourhood.

175576,22027734,2014-10-28,18456739,Gretchen,"Perfectly wonderful stay.  Ray was so kind to show us everything we needed to know.  We weren't around much as we were out seeing the city with our daughter but it was a cozy spot to return to. Slept great!  The location could not have been more perfect! Breakfast at Le Reve Bakery, walking to Kerry Park, and dinner at Mezcaleria Oaxaca...and I thought good Mexican food was only in California! It was a great weekend. Thank you!"

A couple of friends and I came for a relaxing weekend in Seattle and it was super convenient to just hop on the bus and spend the day downtown, then ride the bus back and catch a fun dinner at one of the restaurants in the neighborhood. Trader Joe's was just down the street, so that was handy. Ray and Eileen were so friendly and accommodating, we would definitely stay here again. "

I entered a clean homey apartment complete with a mini tree and holiday display on their lovely sideboard that delighted and made it feel like Christmas when I was far from home! They also left us cookies and a little welcoming gift! Aww! So sweet and kind! XOXO!

After a quick run through of the suite and its amenities we were left to ourselves to enjoy our stay. They were very kind and accommodating! They let us know if we needed anything they were just upstairs and a knock away.

The apartment was so centrally located, it was fantastic! They left us with a parking pass that made parking seamless! The apartment was clean and cozy! Both Ray and Eileen were amazing host's! If your in Seattle I highly recommend you staying at there. You will not be disappointed! Great space, great people, great value! Book now! Thanks again Ray and Eileen! "
175576,30341577,2015-04-20,3022481,Brit,"Ray & Eileen were very welcoming hosts. The basement apartment was clean and cozy, with plenty of space. The Queen Anne Hill neighborhood was also quite charming and ideally located between Ballard and Fremont on the one hand and Capitol Hill and downtown on the other. We would definitely recommend staying there! "
175576,30542880,2015-04-24,24793063,Lena,Unser Aufenthalt bei Ray und Eileen war wirklich perfekt. Wir wurden sehr freundlich von Ray begrüßt und er hat uns alles gezeigt. Das Apartment ist super gemütlich und bietet alles was man braucht. Das Bett ist sehr bequem und die Küche ist gut ausgestattet. Wir haben uns sofort wohl gefühlt. Die Lage von dem Haus ist einfach traumhaft. Die Gegend ist wunderschön und du bist innerhalb 10 Minuten im Zentrum von Seattle mit dem Auto. Der Bus fährt auch gleich vor der Tür aber wir hatten ein Auto deswegen haben wir die öffentlichen Verkehrsmittel nicht gebraucht. Wir können diese Unterkunft wärmstens empfehlen und kommen definitiv wieder!!
175576,30891000,2015-04-28,172602,Philip,"A charming apartment in a beautiful section of Seattle. Cheerful, welcoming hosts. I chose this place to be close to my son, who lives in the Queen Anne section of Seattle, and this was perfect. Since I was with my son much of the time, I only saw my hosts at check-in and check-out, but they were exceedingly nice. I would happily stay here again."
175576,31427807,2015-05-05,27334311,Michelle,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and what a great experience! Ray and Eileen were excellent hosts. Before arriving, the answered any questions we had about the neighborhood and getting around, and provided a map with directions to get to their home. Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and shown to our apartment. There were many different materials for us to review if we wanted (Seattle information, tours, maps etc), as well as a home-made map of the immediate neighborhood with restaurant recommendations which was awesome! The apartment is exactly as described, cozy, clean and there are already clean towels, shampoo/conditioner, soaps and hair dryer so you don't need to drag that along! Ray and Eileen respected our privacy, but were just a knock away if we needed anything, at which point they enthusiastically came running! Perfect hosts.

We absolutely fell in love with the Queen Anne neighborhood. It was gorgeous, quiet, quaint and walking distance to all the sites. We walked downtown and to Belltown almost daily, and only rented a car because we wanted to drive up to Vancouver."

175576,32855253,2015-05-22,32663453,Bryan,"We felt very welcomed, it was a fun experience. We kinda felt like there were a lit of nitpicky rules to follow and so we didn't feel completely comfortable because we always thought we forget something silly to do. We also tried very hard to put everything back in it place that we might have moved inadvertently. 
The neighborhood was upscale and very nice. Unfortunately, due to our own negligence, our car was rummaged through during the night so as with anywhere, there is crime.
All in all, it was a good experience.

175576,33228401,2015-05-26,27275459,Johnny,The hosts were great and friendly and helpful.  First time in Seattle and first time using airbnb.  Great experience and the location was perfect and only a couple of blocks from the bus routes.  We walked to Kerry Park twice and loved the neighborhood.  Always had parking available in front of the house.  Washer and dryer helped since we were in town for 5 days.   I highly recommend the location to others coming into the Queen Anne area.
175576,33793066,2015-06-01,28293064,Alexandra,"Eileen & Ray were friendly and very helpful. They kindly walked us through the apartment to make sure we knew where everything was and made sure we had the parking pass for our car. Street parking was very easy. Accommodations were perfect, and as described. The Queen Anne neighborhood is great - plenty of restaurants and grocery stores just a block away. We enjoyed looking over downtown Seattle from Kerry Park, and walking down the hill to Seattle Center. The bus line was easily accessible when we didn't feel like walking back up the hill! "
175576,33981253,2015-06-03,10336768,Matt,"We would highly suggest renting this very cute downstairs apartment from Ray and Eileen. The location is excellent with multiple buses that get you downtown within 15 minutes, and nearby shops and a Safeway. The breakfast at nearby Queen Anne Cafe is not be missed!

Ray and Eileen were also excellent hosts who were so friendly and welcoming. They left much information in the apartment about things to do in Seattle as well as beverages in the fridge. The bed is supper comfortable too. 

Make sure you book this place if you are coming to Seattle. Look no further!"
175576,34244654,2015-06-06,14729063,Aaron,"Staying at Ray and Eileen's Queen Anne rental apartment was fantastic.  It was wonderfully spacious, very well appointed, and they had everything so well laid out that we had no problem feeling immediately comfortable.  We happened to arrive in the middle of the night, but were able to enter the property without issue; they truly have gone to great lengths to accommodate their guests.  The rental location was superb with easy, easy walking access to stores and restaurants.  If you want your own spacious place to stay in a beautiful neighborhood in Seattle, this place can't be beat."
175576,34414741,2015-06-08,13969303,Eric,Ray and Eileen were very good hosts they gave us a very good feel for Seattle. They were very helpful and they were friendly
175576,34762283,2015-06-12,22827995,Patricia,"Ray met us on arrival, was extremely friendly, and gave us lots of assistance/useful information. The neighbourhood was safe and convenient, and the listing was as described. The suite had everything we needed, and we were able to prepare some meals there as well as relax. A most enjoyable stay."
175576,35071200,2015-06-15,5502805,Linda,We had a great stay at Ray and Eileen's private apartment on Queen Anne. They are very friendly and welcoming hosts. The location is excellent and the apartment includes everything you need for a comfortable stay.
175576,35540366,2015-06-20,7504220,Karen,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Loved the apartment...cozy and clean.  LOVED the location...one block to Queen Anne Avenue with lots of good restaurants.  Walked down to Seattle Center (Space Needle) and also to Pikes Market...but it is also close to a bus line if you don't want to walk back up the hill.  Ray & Eileen were wonderful hosts...very friendly.  We will definitely stay here again when in Seattle.
175576,35785168,2015-06-22,2234408,Mike,Ray made us feel very welcomed when we arrived.  The apartment is just as described.  It was very clean and all ready to go for us when we got there.  It is in a great location.  Easy to walk to coffee shops and restaurants.
175576,36069778,2015-06-24,6690437,Marco,"What a great place! Ray met us with a warm smile and showed us the place. Everything you need is here. Even a fridge with waters, beer and some juice. Queen Anne area is a great part of Seattle. Not far from downtown or any other spot in Seattle. We wish we could have stayed longer! Thank you Ray and Eileen! "
175576,36736528,2015-06-30,35519105,Uwe,"Wir hatten eine wundervolle Zeit bei Ray und Eileen! Beide haben uns herzlich begrüßt und Ray gab viele gute Tipps für einen Tag in Seattle. Wir haben vorher eine sehr gute Anfahrtsbeschreibung erhalten und es gab sogar kostenlos gekühlte Getränke im Kühlschrank. Nach einer langen Anreise ein Traum. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr ruhig, sicher und bietet viele tolle Pubs und Restaurants, die wir selbst ausprobiert haben. Auf Tipp von Ray und Eileen sind wir ins Alehouse - wieder ein sehr guter Tipp. Nicht weit (circa 10 Minuten) liegt der Kerry Park mit einer wahnsinnigen Sicht auf Seattle und der Space Needle! Mit dem Bus ist man in circa 15 Minuten in der Stadt. Die Wohnung ist wie beschrieben - sehr gemütlich mit allem, was man braucht. Alles in allem eine sehr empfehlenswerte Unterkunft. Wir würden sofort wieder buchen. "
175576,36951953,2015-07-03,31549267,Nathan,"Their house was so beautiful!  It was also in a wonderful area of the city.  It was close to many of the tourist attractions we wanted to see and also far enough away to feel like you were getting away.  Both Ray and Eileen were so very kind and fun to talk to.  The place was clean, well maintained, and easy to understand.  Such a wonderful place to spend a vacation!"
175576,37551821,2015-07-08,193753,Naomi,"Wonderful stay! Listing was 100% accurate, tons of informational materials about the neighborhood and Seattle were provided, easy to park in the neighborhood, snacks and light refreshments included for us, and a lovely patio area to sit out on during the evenings. Ray and Eileen made us feel right at home. Hope to stay again in the future!  "
175576,37838734,2015-07-11,26730137,Edith,"We stayed at Ray and Eileens place for two days, when we arrived in Seattle after our flight from Amsterdam, to start our Summer holiday. What a warm welcome we received! The house is nice , cosy and comfortabel. The only thing we missed was some direct sunlight; the reason we could use some was the jetlag we had to manage. The more than lovely patio in front of their house completely made up for this. Queen Ann Hill is a very good neighbourhood to stay, especially the lookout point at Kerry Park which gives a marvellous view over Downtown Seattle and the harbour. Thank you so much for the pleasant stay!"
175576,38101213,2015-07-13,29274500,Michelle,"The location of this property can't be beat.  Located on Queen Anne Hill, it is within walking distance of a gorgeous view, restaurants and shopping.

The hosts have spent a lot of time providing information to their guests, including a map of the area and lots of guides on the Seattle area which is great.  They met with us personally upon arrival and were very welcoming and were available for questions during our stay, if we needed anything.

This is a basement unit.   It is a little funky, especially the bathroom.  But, there's a lot of room to spread out, and there is also a laundry room available for use.

As another guest mentioned in a review there are a lot of instructions left around the apartment which made me worried that if I didn't follow the instructions I would receive negative feedback--so I really tried to respect their wishes.  

Also, not the hosts' fault, there is a dog next door that lives near the bedroom window which disturbed us both mornings during our stay and one afternoon.  

All in all, it's a clean, albeit funky, place to stay in an awesome neighborhood.  "
