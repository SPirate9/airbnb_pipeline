The house was fantastic, and Heather was always very communicative. She had a prepared PDF with everything we needed to know about the house, and it was also prepped very well prior to our arrival.

I guess during a prior visit the soap dish fell off the wall in one of the showers, Heather made sure it got fixed and that her handyman coordinated with us.

Overall, it was a great experience, great house and location, and Heather was a wonderful host."
1747184,16750167,2014-08-01,18871051,Kelley,"Our hosts and the space was absolutely phenomenal! Heather made the process so easily -- she was exceptionally responsive to us as we booked and very proactive in ensuring our stay would be awesome. And, it was! 

Beautiful views, close to stores and restaurants, and lovely accommodations. I would highly recommend!"
1747184,16969362,2014-08-05,11872991,Nona,"Great place for a big group!  Our group really enjoyed the amazing views and lovely accommodations! No a/c, which is probably not usually a problem, but was noticeable in August on the third floor.  Hosts are friendly and accommodating!"
1747184,17429991,2014-08-12,9671858,Doru,"The place is amazing. The view, location and house are just awesome. We loved the place and we definitely use it again in the future. Heather took the time to interact with us and give us all the instructions necessary to have a great vacation."
1747184,17609169,2014-08-15,12297562,Emily,This house was great! The views were absolutely stunning and the accommodations were wonderful. Our group was able to easily get around the Seattle area and see downtown as well as come back and cook dinner. 
1747184,17993373,2014-08-20,359438,Debbi,"I rented the Kelley's home while I was in Seattle for my daughter's wedding.  It was a great decision.  The home is fully equipped and was able to accommodate our group of 8  family and friends.  The house was clean, beds were comfortable and there were sufficient towels.  We were also able to do laundry. Having 2 living areas worked out well.  The location was perfect for us - on the west side of the 520 bridge. Getting downtown was relatively easy as well being able to hit some of the neighborhoods on the west side.  There is a great shopping district close by with a supermarket. The view is incredible from the top level and we enjoyed our wine while looking at the skyline over Lake Union.  Communication was good and we had no problem getting into the home on arrival day.  Our only complaint was having to leave."
1747184,18529798,2014-08-28,13056830,Inbar,"Amazing house, amazing location, amazing hosts.
Highly recommended..."
1747184,18779965,2014-09-01,5380118,Ralph,"Heather and Mike have a lovely home. We rented the complete house, with 5 bedrooms and 3 bathrooms, for our three generation family over a 4-day Labor Day weekend. Their home is extremely comfortable, clean, it has excellent beds, 1.5 kitchens, and the bathrooms are well-kept. From the upper floor, there is a wonderful view of north end of Union Lake.  We highly recommend the house, or a portion (if that is available). Heather and Mike were easy to communicate with, informative, and flexible on some access needs we had. "
1747184,24136457,2014-12-21,3156246,Sarah,"Great place! So comfy for kids and adults. Heather was so accommodating, fits 10 comfortably. The views were spectacular. And the toys for kids were a huge hit. Thanks so much for a wonderful weekend! "
1747184,24414806,2014-12-28,791302,June,"What a perfect house for a large group with kids. Heather immediately reached out to us and warmly extended her house. We had fresh towels neatly laid out on our beds. The views were amazing, the rooms were spacious, and the reference book was so detailed. The toys and books were an added plus for the kids. Thank you so much for letting us stay at your amazing house."
1747184,33140575,2015-05-25,32383810,Suresh,"The host are very welcoming. They are very friendly and gave all the information about the house. There were plenty of amenities and home had an excellent ambience. This is an excellent place to stay. We had a mix of elders and kids. All of them in our group enoyed the stay. The house has an awesome view of the waterfront. Very clean and neat with lot of linens. Host Heather and Mike were very kind in following with us if we had any needs for our stay. We wish good luck for Heather, Mike and Eleni Kelly."
1747184,41571375,2015-08-08,26199107,Robert,"Overall, I would give this property a 4-star rating.  The hosts were very courteous and thoughtful.  When our large group arrived, there was fruit, coffee, and wine on the counter to greet us.  The property has great views - and we especially liked the outside deck on the third (top) floor.  Our large group spent many an hour talking and enjoying the evening on that deck.  The location is perfect (close to quality shops and restaurants.

The downside of the property were: 1. the living rooms and deck did not have comfortable furniture; 2. the beds in the various bedrooms were not consistent and some were uncomfortable; and 3. you could not open the windows (it was an uncommonly hot time in Seattle - although the hosts permitted us to remove a window which provided relief).  However, I understand the reasoning for the windows not opening (they are low to the floor - and there is a correct concern of the hosts that there could be an accident if left open).

Overall, I really liked the hosts and they were eager to please.  The house is great for large family reunions.  While the house is not modern, and the furniture is not all that comfortable, it was a great experience for our family reunion."
1747184,42894111,2015-08-16,38356216,Ryan,"We had a large group rent this wonderful house for the weekend. The host was awesome and kept great communication throughout the process. Instructions for the place and other things to know were well laid out before hand and she even left a binder with all the info we would need during our stay. The house was comfortable and nobody had any trouble feeling at home for the weekend. The location and views were better than expected!

Overall a great experience and a great weekend!"
1747184,44141219,2015-08-24,4712798,Annie,"What an amazing experience! The house is everything as it's described, but they could do no justice for that view! It's a great location for taking in all parts of the city, but you won't want to leave that upstairs. We were very comfortable and everyone had plenty of their own space. Mike was super helpful in getting the projector working, and even brought over his laptop from work so our kids could watch a movie. I will look for any opportunity to stay here again. "
1747184,44931934,2015-08-30,2285348,Kevin,This was truly an amazing home with a spectacular view of Seattle. Everything was comfortable and convenient. It was the perfect place to stay and we couldn't be happier with our generous hosts.
1747184,45952756,2015-09-07,638520,LaiYee Lori,"This house was perfect for hosting a large group of my friends. It was spacious, had a great view, and was in a convenient location. Heather was very communicative and accommodating. I highly recommend it."
1747184,46525874,2015-09-11,1307193,Peter,Me and my colleagues had a fantastic stay. All the bedrooms were comfortable. The terrace on the top floor was great for late night and early morning chilling. Wifi was fast. Host was super welcoming. All around a great experience.
1747184,46928730,2015-09-14,41739483,Linda,"Heather, Mike and Eleni's place was the perfect fit for our family.  We were welcomed with a bottle of wine and chocolate.  The kitchen was well equipped for cooking, the beds were comfortable and the upstairs views were amazing.  The location is easy to get to off the freeway and easy access to downtown.  For a larger group it is perfect with the three levels and six bedrooms.  We were very happy and comfortable here.  We would definitely recommend a stay here."
5127136,30226772,2015-04-19,1522662,Samir,Lacey really made us feel welcome.  She gave us a nice tour on arrival and even loaned us baby gear to make it easier to take care of our little ones during our stay.  Great experience!
5127136,31470264,2015-05-05,30208033,Heather,"Lacey was the perfect host!! Well stocked essentials- ( thank you for having coffee stocked!)the place was amazing- perfect for our mini Seattle trip- the townhouse was perfect for our party of four. It is very well kept, very clean and quiet. Thank you Lacey for one of the best Air BnB experiences. "
5127136,31968345,2015-05-12,29651545,Jiateng,so good!
5127136,32273407,2015-05-16,28722982,Kolby,"Lacey was wonderful. She met us at her townhome as we arrived and made us feel very welcome. The home was great, just as described. Lacey was always a text away. I highly recommend booking this if visiting Seattle!"
5127136,32579392,2015-05-19,8519421,Marlee,This is a beautiful space and Lacey was SO accommodating and SO kind and SO helpful. Communication was perfect. She met us at the house when we arrived to give us the keys and show us around and it was great to meet her! The space itself is perfect: clean and well situated and a very cozy home base in a great area of Seattle.  We will definitely try to stay at Lacey's Greenwood Oasis again next time we are in town.  
5127136,32984031,2015-05-24,26304088,Ziyi,"Romantic style house, nice kitchen and bedrooms, quiet neighborhood. This is really a wonderful place for our 5 days stay. Our host Lacey keeps the rooms very clean and gave us enough privacy. I will definitely choose to stay here again next time."
5127136,33924759,2015-06-02,32006809,Timothy,"The house was great! We had a group of 6 people and had plenty of space. The area has plenty of amenities within walking distance. Groceries are two blocks away, an amazing beer bar is on the same block, and there is plenty of food nearby. 

For those driving around the city the location was close enough to allow relatively easy access to downtown and other tourist spots. 

Lacey made a point to contact us before the trip and was around to meet us when we arrived.  She was very friendly and helpful.

We had a great time and would definitely stay at this place again."
5127136,34334802,2015-06-07,33637039,Gunn,"Vår aller første Airbnb bestilling var en stor suksess. Fem glade bereiste personer forlot huset i Greenwood, Seattle etter 4 dagers opphold. Velutstyrt hjem med alt vi trengte, hyggelig nabolag, og lett å parkere i gatene rundt. Anbefales på det varmeste. Gode beskrivelser og tett dialog online med vertskapet.  Takk Lacey!"
5127136,34951219,2015-06-14,16767993,Kurt,"We had a wonderful stay at Lacey's house. The accommodations were perfect - clean, spacious, comfortable and decorated by a designer. Very unpretentious hip. Communication was great and Lacey was there for every need. Highly recommended!!!!"
5127136,35455089,2015-06-19,28350761,Latrice,"Lacey's Townhome is fantastic!  It was very clean and spacious and there was 5 adults in our party so that says a lot.  I really appreciated how Lacey thought ahead on many different aspects.  From extra bedding to toiletries to cooking essentials, she had all the basics covered.  If I was ever in the area again, I would stay here.  It tended to get a bit warm upstairs during the night but a simple fan would solve the issue.  Other than that, I had a great stay.  Thanks a bunch, Lacey!"
5127136,35680764,2015-06-21,31252579,Lisa,"This house was wonderful!  It was spacious, decorated very nicely and the kitchen is awesome!  It is walking distance to excellent restaurants and stores. Chuck's hop shop has an incredible variety of beer and ice cream and we noticed it had food trucks there on the weekend evenings.  Lacey was super helpful and always available!  We hope  we can make it back to this gem in Seattle someday soon!"
5127136,36208567,2015-06-26,7968327,Ryan,Lacey and Colt were incredible.  They were hospitable and helpful for guests who were unfamiliar with the area.  They made sure to make accommodations for anything we might need.  A great experience overall with hosts who go above and beyond!
5127136,36382057,2015-06-28,29475256,Larissa,"This cute townhome was even better then we expected!  The host, Lacey, left us small welcome gift and everything was so clean.  A few days prior to our arrival we got a detailed message from Lacey with very clear and concise direction and instructions on finding the house, accessing the keys, using the wifi, and much more.  She made herself very available to us throughout our stay if we needed her!

Great place and we would definitely stay here again!"
5127136,36682931,2015-06-30,20043942,Simon,"It is our first experience with Airbnb and definitely positive one. Host is very responsive. The check-in & check-out process go smoothly. The house is identical to the pictures. It’s clean, homey, comfortable, bright & convenient. My kids love to read the classic children and other books. Finding parking on the street isn’t a problem for us. Overall, we are very satisfied with the stay.   "
5127136,36900616,2015-07-02,28777761,Retha,"Lacey was very informative on the townhouse location, which was helpful. Cute house. Thanks for a great alternative to a hotel."
5127136,37310255,2015-07-06,26449014,Jicheng,"Lacey is very caring host. She prepared her house very well. Her guide to the house is very clear and surrounding is quiet and convenient. Especially ,the bed is very soft ,comfortable. Thanks ,Lacey ."
5127136,37865455,2015-07-11,6500190,Edward,"We had a great time at Lacey's place. The house was clean and comfortable and gave us plenty of room.  Good location, close to UW and not a bad commute to downtown."
5127136,38260679,2015-07-14,30812386,Astrid,"Lacey is a wonderful host! She greeted us the second we got there and showed us the townhouse and gave us information concerning the neighborhood and the city in general. Great person! Highly recommend renting from her, shes awesome! "
5127136,38587848,2015-07-17,7092942,Karen,"Lacey had thought of every touch, from mints on our pillow to other little surprises. The townhome was lovely and clean - there was ample space for everyone. We loved Lacey's townhome!"
5127136,39377841,2015-07-23,3160235,Andrea,"Lacey's place is the ideal airbnb experience. This house is homey and conveniently located in a cute neighbourhood. Checkin/out was easy and Lacey & Co. (her kids) were a calm welcome after a long flight. Lacey gives the impression that she cares about her home/guests which sets this place apart from often 'hostel-style' experience that invade airbnb listings. 

Around the corner was Chuck's a local beer place with a different food truck for every meal - which was taken advantage of nearly everyday. 

Recommended."
5127136,39629288,2015-07-25,34778420,Stephanie,"Absolutely wonderful time at Lacey's beautiful Greenwood home. This neighborhood is hip and has tons of places to walk to within just a few minutes. We have two kids, ages 3 and 7 months, and Lacey went out of her way to make sure we had access to toys, high chair, potty training seat, and more. 

The beds were very comfortable, the bathrooms and kitchen well-equipped, and the space was so welcoming and clean. We can't say enough nice things about this rental! There was even a parade on our second day that went right past the house--my son loved it! 

To top it all off, Lacey left us a growler and a gift card to fill at the local beer spot. We would absolutely recommend staying in this beautiful home. We look forward to coming back. "
5127136,40892040,2015-08-03,30234548,Dave,"Lacey provided a very comfortable and clean house to stay in.  She also provided information about her house if you needed to trouble shoot some things.  There was nothing major and honestly every house has its own quirks.  (ie if a electric plug trips where to reset it)
She inquired about us and our needs then took the extra steps to make our stay very comfortable.
We have family that have moved into the area and would stay here again in the future.  Yes we would give Lacey a strong A+.
Dave  "
5127136,41221246,2015-08-05,36072635,Meaghan,"Lacey was extremely welcoming. The townhome was perfect for our needs and was incredibly spacious and homey. It would be a perfect rental if you have children as the home was child-proof and had many kids movies, books, etc. We did not have children with us, but it was still perfect for our stay. Great location, and very welcoming host. Couldn't ask for more!"
5127136,41378981,2015-08-07,14776563,Sarah,"We had an amazing stay at Lacey's townhouse. Lacey was a great communicator and liaised with us 48 hours before we arrived. The townhouse was spottlesley clean, large and in a great neighbourhood area which really gave us a taste of the real 'Seatlle'. Lacy was so accomodating, allowing us to check out a little later, she also provided great tips for the local area which was fantastic. I would highly recommend Laceys townhouse to anyone who is looking for a neighbourhood suburb stay in a great, well located, clean and family orientated space. Thanks Lacey ... 5 + stars ! "
5127136,42051451,2015-08-10,177206,Polly,"My husband had a reunion weekend with his friends and they rented this townhome. Lacey welcomed them with local beers. The location was ideal with many restaurants and bars in walking distance.  There was plenty of room for the guys to spread out and they each had a place to sleep. The only complaint they had was that the garbage can/recycling was already pretty full when they got there, so it was overflowing by the time they left. All in all, they enjoyed there stay and would  highly recommend Lacey's townhome for a comfortable stay. "
5127136,42395530,2015-08-13,16182126,Jia,It was a lovely house. There were enough rooms and beds to make all six of us comfortable including two small kids. The community is quiet and location is convenient. Parking was not a problem on a nearby street. I would definitely stay here again when I'm back to Seattle next time. 
5127136,43031392,2015-08-17,30940450,Pamela,We had a fabulous time and your place was very accommodating  it was only 3 miles from my daughter we bought too much food as usual. But we left it for the next group I'm sorry we didn't get to meet. Thanks for all your help seattle is great. I'll be there again next year 
5127136,43381045,2015-08-19,30121537,Oriane,"Lacey est une hôte très agréable et vraiment accessible. La maison est sublime et tout le confort est la !
Le quartier est très calme."
5127136,43759708,2015-08-22,11528526,David,"Very easy to stay here. Lacey met us when we arrived, gave a tour. They place was great for 5 adults, & we saw a lot of evidence it would be good for kids too. For us it was location --- Chuck's Hop Shop is right around the corner! Fred Meyer is close by, not to mention our daughter lives in the neighborhood. It was all good."
5127136,45057938,2015-08-31,14052762,Tamara,We stayed in Lacey's Townhome for over a week when we were in Seattle for our son's wedding.  Everything was as advertised.  It was clean and neat and the pictures are accurate.  Beds were comfortable.  We were a bit concerned that there was no assigned parking but had no trouble finding close spaces for our car.  A couple time we took buses to downtown and the bus stop was close.  We walked to Fred Meyer for groceries and to local restaurants when we wanted to eat out.  Stacia's Pizza was very good for take-out.  It was a great trip and we had no problems.
5127136,45475130,2015-09-03,5423031,Ellen,Lacey went above & beyond in making us feel welcome in Seattle!  The property was wonderful and the neighborhood was very cool and well-situated.  Strongly recommended.
5127136,46366907,2015-09-10,31425016,Colleen,"Lacey made us feel very welcome. She reached out to us before our stay to make sure we had all the details about the house's location and neighborhood. During our stay, Lacey reached out again to make sure everything was comfortable. The house is well setup and in a great area.

The house sits close to a great beer shop that has a different food truck every night, too. Huge bonus for those who want to relax without needing to go too far.

Lacey is diligent about making her home comfortable for guests and communicates quickly about any issues or concerns, no matter how small. She made sure we had a very pleasant stay."
5127136,47655330,2015-09-21,37686088,James," We were very happy with the accommodation. When we asked our other family members who stayed with us all said it is five star and would stay again if in the Seattle area. 
We appreciated the welcome gift of a growler from an adjacent craft  beer store. It is a lovely suite with all the amenities one could ask for. Thanks to Lacey and family for allowing us to stay there.
James and Nancy Wigglesworth"
5127136,47887647,2015-09-21,17552524,Dane,What a great spot in a great neighborhood. We were in town to see friends and celebrate an engagement and Lacey's place was so conveniently located and fun. I loved that there was a great craft brew shop right around the corner and fantastic food trucks around the block throughout the weekend. 
5127136,49097011,2015-10-01,11124579,Erin,We loved this accommodation! Conveniently located north of downtown in Greenwood. We were within 20 minutes of everything we wanted to go to! Lacey was responsive and had a beautiful home. Will definitely be back!
5127136,49596018,2015-10-05,37060694,Janie,"The townhouse was perfect for us.  We were in Seattle for a family wedding reception.  The rental allowed us to sleep two families, cook and prepare for the reception dinner, and have space to sit and visit with various family members that popped by.  There was ample room to allow for individual privacy when needed.   It was a much better choice than renting two motel rooms!
Lacey's photographs accurately detail the townhouse rooms and living space.  She and her husband were most-helpful and gracious when I needed questions answered (at 9 p.m.) the first night we arrived."
5127136,50660064,2015-10-13,5737439,Eric & Traci,"The townhouse is just as pictured. Ample space for a family or multiple couples. The location was perfect for us. We were looking to see more of Seattle than downtown so this was a great fit. Golden Gate Park is just down the street, sandy beaches, sail boats, and a wonderful park for kids. Many places are walking distance for those looking for food or nightlife. The Yard, Prost, and some excellent coffee shops are just down the way. Easy drive to inner city if you want to go to the Space Needle, or Pikes Place. highly recommend."
5127136,51158251,2015-10-18,2054333,Brian,"Beautiful townhome in a great little neighborhood. Walkable to a bunch of coffee places, bars, restaurants and cool shopping. Easy street parking for cars. Great highway accessibility. Lacey left great instructions for how to care for the property and interesting places in the neighborhood. 

Pro tip for people outside the PacNW: the Fred Meyer down the street is more Target than Safeway, so if you forget to pack anything you can probably buy it there. "
5127136,51568210,2015-10-21,1304346,Paul,"Lacey's place was very easy to find and also very well maintained! Its also located in a really nice neighborhood with good eateries within walking distance. Traffic to the highway is sometimes pretty bad, but nothing that caused too much delay. Would definitely live here again!"
5127136,52821254,2015-11-02,5672164,Susie,"We have just gotten back from our trip to Rainy but Beautiful Seattle!!
It was such an amazing trip! We absolutely LOVED staying at Lacey's Gorgeous Townhouse. Everything is just as advertised. It was perfect for our group of 5. The neighborhood is cute and quiet. Only thing that we had a problem with was having to park a few blocks away since there is no parking on the premises but, It was quite lovely walking around and getting to know the neighborhood. Just remember to pack an umbrella. It is very close to every cool Tourists point, about 20 min from downtown 30 minutes from the airport and 15 to Ballard street.  Be aware that there is a few restaurants around the neighborhood but they do close up by 11pm so if you're looking for some action go over to Ballard Street very cool bars and restaurants. 
We didn't get to meet Lacey unfortunately but, she was available via email and leaves a pamphlet in her home with recommendations of where to eat and visit. We did do the underground tour which I highly recommend. In closing we had a fantastic time and would most definitely return to Greenwood and The townhouse. Thank you Lacey..."
5127136,55342409,2015-12-01,19707533,Jessie,"Lacey's place is cozy and in a great location. We enjoyed our stay and were glad that this place worked out for all 5 of us.
There's street parking one block away. We didn't have any problem finding a parking spot, but make sure you unload by the townhouse if you happen to have a lot of stuff with you.
There was only one load of dishwasher detergent left at the townhome when we were there, but it wasn't a big deal for us we just hand washed the dishes. 
It was very easy to communicate with Lacey even when she was out of the country!"
5127136,56638166,2015-12-15,2497839,Valerie,"This is a really good place in Greenwood. Within walking distance of a large grocery store, restaurants, coffee. Condo is large and clean. We really enjoyed our stay!  Owner is very accommodating and quick to respond. "
5127136,57759338,2015-12-29,5620402,Paige,"Lacey welcomed us with a gift certificate to the bottle shop below. She also had tons of baby stuff -pack-n-play, high chair, toys, books, potty seat, etc. It was so awesome to have the gear all there. 

This house would be awesome for a big group. She is so accommodating and there are plenty of beds.

Greenwood neighborhood keeps getting cooler and cooler. It's also very well connected with bus lines and close to freeways.

This house would be a little tricky for those with mobility issues as there are lots of stairs and you have to park about a block away. It is no problem to drop someone off in the alley in the back of the house as we did my Grandmother when she came to visit. You can also park close to load and unload. But, there will be walking involved with the driver.   "
2737012,13929363,2014-06-08,8614940,Rachael,"The Garden Studio was amazing: private, clean, super cute, and affordable. I definitely recommend staying with Bethanie and Corey - they were thoughtful, great hosts. The room was private, with a great ensuite bathroom and small kitchenette. "
2737012,14128262,2014-06-12,1877314,Victor,"This place was very chill and the perfect size, the owners were very cool and even suggested some cool trails to hike out in Mount Rainier. They put a lot of cool items that are a must when traveling a lot of thought went into making you feel welcome. I really enjoyed staying here! "
2737012,14297939,2014-06-16,15808449,Margie,"Bethanie and Cory have put a tremendous amount of thoughtfulness to this awesome studio. The place was spotlessly clean, very private, and nicely appointed.  They have included all the comforts provided at a 5 star hotel for a very affordable price.  I would recommend it to anyone and will absolutely stay here again on my next visit to Seattle.  Loved it!"
2737012,14419830,2014-06-18,8822986,Peter,"I had a short but excellent stay.  The space is nice, clean, cozy, with simple instructions and little luxuries you don't expect.  Would definitely stay here again."
2737012,14919702,2014-06-29,6741822,Deborah,Super cozy & relaxing studio. Bethanie was a very great hostess. Neighborhood is very quiet & pretty. Completely enjoyed my stay!
2737012,15151647,2014-07-03,16183728,Zack,"While we never met Corey & Bethanie, their place was perfect. They respected our space while did make themselves available for anything we needed. They place is just as advertised- very cozy and cute. It made for a very sweet stay. Corey and Bethanie really put in some thought and care while setting up this studio. I would absolutely recommend staying here. Note: if you plan on going into the city often, a car will be useful. 
"
2737012,15223209,2014-07-05,8918433,Kendra,"Great stay!  Cute, cozy and comfortable!  Loved the little patio!  Thanks!  "
2737012,15453108,2014-07-09,15743694,Maurice,"The accommodation was exactly as pictured.  I think Bethanie short-sold the wonderful location as it became a joke to us that every time we punched any destination into the GPS it told us it was only 15 minutes away.  How much more convenient can you get?  

We liked how she chose to decorate the place with interesting textures and features -- even a series of doorknobs repurposed as a towel rack.  "
2737012,15592821,2014-07-12,17107403,Timothy,"Great place!  Extremely clean and comfortable and well kept with a lovely garden in a quiet neighborhood.  Our hosts were communicative through text and email but we had total privacy.  Man, the bed was really comfortable.  Will stay here again when we are in the area.
TIM "
2737012,15633816,2014-07-13,16017156,Patrick,What gracious hosts: They contacted us in advance and made sure we knew all we needed to know. The place is very cozy and so clean. The bed may be one of the most comfortable beds in the world!  We highly recommend this place for nestling in West Seattle and as a hub for day trips to the Emerald City.
2737012,15690179,2014-07-14,14822801,Chris,We stayed at Corey & Bethanie's place for two separate nights either side of a trip to the Olympic National Park region. This was easily the nicest accommodation for our entire 3 week US trip! The space is beautiful and has everything you could want and more provided. Bethanie has done an amazing job providing all the relevant information about the space and plenty of local recommendations for restaurants and cafés. The comforts of a hotel with the familiar feel of home. Definitely a winner!
2737012,15877791,2014-07-17,8235033,Aram,"Amazing, cozy, quiet and clean studio. Had such a terrific time. 
Thank you very much.!!! "
2737012,16106530,2014-07-22,15431579,Monica,A great and very efficient space that's private and very well maintained. 
2737012,16556060,2014-07-29,16399259,Travis,We had a great stay. The unit was well stocked and having the bus line nearby was really convenient.
2737012,16713309,2014-08-01,15694034,Vanessa,"The room was quaint and perfect. Just as pictured online.  We only stayed one night, used code to enter and didn't have any interaction with the hosts at all. The room was clean and had all the necessities. I would stay here again and recommend it to others."
2737012,17381322,2014-08-11,1606628,Gemma,"This cozy and very comfortable suite was PERFECT after a long day driving. We only spent one night here but would definitely come back (the bed was so comfy!) Communicating with Bethanie was easy and they seemed really easy going. It was a little hard to get an idea of the area as we arrived late at night but it was pretty direct by car from downtown, and was quiet. Thanks for a great stay!"
2737012,17561537,2014-08-14,9389405,Carol And Tom,"Yes the listing was accurate and the hosts were always helpful with our requests for directions, at any given time.
This is a lovely apt with anything you would need for comfort and then some. Bethanie even supplied nice shampoo, shower gel, lotion and sunscreen!  which we needed.
Other conveniences like an iron and ironing board, should you choose to take the time to use them, are supplied as well.
We found the West Seattle neighborhood streets a bit challenging to navigate, but again Bethanie and Cory were helpful with directing us around even though we never met them in person due to their work schedules.  It is a good location if like us you choose not to stay downtown where you will pay higher prices and have a car that needs ti be parked....there is no free parking.
The cozy garden was a nice retreat from all that."
2737012,17839220,2014-08-18,17333017,Michael,"Corey and Bethanie's ""Cozy, Garden Studio in West Seattle"" was exactly as described including the other positive reviews provided on airbnb.  It was a quiet, private place to spend the weekend.  My wife and I appreciated the colorful, artistic interior and exterior decor as well as the extra efforts made to provide higher quality amenities (toiletries, teas, etc) and ease in recycling. While we didn't get to meet Corey and Bethanie, they were readily available by phone/text to answer any questions we had about the surrounding area (local restaurants for example).  The price per night was very reasonable and we will likely stay here again in the future.  Thanks to Corey and Bethanie!"
2737012,18176943,2014-08-23,17529553,Erin,"Our stay was perfect! The room was so lovely... and the bed was super comfy! The area is quiet and peaceful, and just walking distance to a bus stop. The room had everything a traveler might need, including transit information, a walking map and coffee! "
2737012,18476110,2014-08-27,2672591,Emma,"My partner and I enjoyed our stay in this great place in a tranquil part of Seattle. We were only there for one night, but we were impressed with the amenities available (kitchenette, wifi, television, games...). We did not meet the hosts, however everything was well explained with a small manual on arrival and I was easily able to contact them by e-mail if need be. "
2737012,18667777,2014-08-30,19061367,Jennifer,"The studio was very cute and private, exactly as promised and even more fun and funky than we'd imagined. It was the perfect place for us to land for the afternoon and evening of a friend's wedding nearby.  Neighbors are pretty close, but we would pick this place over a hotel any day. Corey and Bethanie were also very kind about offering an early check-in for us."
2737012,18941019,2014-09-03,11067352,Rebecca,"Be thanks and Corey's studio apartment was very comfortable and clean when we arrived. All of the essentials were provided for my friend and I and we enjoyed the quiet neighborhood. Their home is about a 10 minute drive from Sea-Tac and about 20-25 from Downtown Seattle. They are less than a mile away from White Center and the small downtown strip with restaurants and pubs. Although the parking was a little tricky for our mid-size vehicle, we enjoyed all other aspects of our stay.
Thank you Corey and Bethanie for your hospitality and opening your home to us. "

2737012,20216507,2014-09-25,21577027,Morgan,"Corey and Bethanie's place was great! It was comfortable, private, and the perfect size for us. It was our #1 pick for places we stayed at during our trip on the West Coast. "

2737012,20497077,2014-09-30,18355702,Pablo,Corey and Bethanie are one of the main reasons we had a great experience in Seattle. So welcoming. So convenient. It was perfect. I will Definitely book again!
2737012,20609256,2014-10-02,6904782,Sarah,"Bethanie and Corey's cute little studio apartment was perfect for our stay. It was well-appointed, nicely decorated, and spotlessly clean. They made it easy to check in, and their directions were very helpful.  We really appreciated the kitchenette because it allowed us to make a quick breakfast and brew coffee for the road before heading to an early morning flight at SeaTac. The neighborhood seemed safe and wasn't too far from the Fauntleroy area where we had dinner. Would definitely stay there again if the need arose."
2737012,20828000,2014-10-06,20245084,Jay,"If you're looking for a cozy place to stay in West Seattle, this should be your first stop! Our hosts provided us with great amenities and a wonderful clean room stocked with shampoos, conditioners and all sorts of cleaning products, AND they have the most comfortable bed and the most relaxing shower head!"
2737012,20970826,2014-10-08,4004325,Aubrey,"I had a wonderful experience staying in this space. Everything was neat and as expected. Though I didn't meet Bethanie, she let me know all the information I needed ahead of time. This space was very relaxing. I would definitely stay here again."
2737012,21087016,2014-10-11,19315091,Sophia,Corey and Bethanie have a welcoming entrance to their studio and charming interior. We were very comfortable during our 2-night stay and we enjoyed venturing around the neighborhood for breakfast in our rental car. We had a restful stay before driving up to Vancouver and we will miss waking up to the morning dew.
2737012,21770033,2014-10-23,1286876,Randi,"It was perfect! When we got their I was feeling sick and just wanted to see no one, take a bath, and go to bed. And thats exactly what I got. The easy access into the place was nice yet safe. The bed was so comfy! everything their that I needed. Very impressed. "
2737012,22066386,2014-10-29,817405,Teresa,"I didn't meet Corey or Bethanie in person, just talked with Bethanie on the phone. This was such a great spot for me to base myself out of for the 5 days I was in Seattle for work.  It was the perfect size and location and I discovered a new favourite restaurant in Georgetown (yesssss!).  

I had to park a couple of blocks away (which was just fine for me) because I couldn't maneuver my van in the ally. The hill was too steep, with loose rocks...and i couldn't turn around. I think that it would be fine for cars.

I look forward to staying here again!  Very cozy :)"
2737012,22292154,2014-11-03,13361117,Bettina,"We really enjoyed our stay in this cottage.  The room was tastefully decorated and the bed was comfortable. They provided some nice touches such as a kitchenette with coffee and granola bars, towels, shampoo, conditioner and body wash in the bathroom.  The bathroom was also very spacious!  We have a lot of friends in the West Seattle area all with in blocks of this place so it was easy to walk to their homes and I would definitely come back here again."
2737012,22366293,2014-11-04,21974045,Zak,"The space was very cozy and welcoming, everything we needed to know about the space was in the description of the ad, and also written on a sheet of paper on the table inside.  
The listing was totally accurate, the neighborhood is nice, quiet, and comfortable."
2737012,22613393,2014-11-10,2845558,Mele,The studio was very nice and had a super comfortable bed -- it was a great place to get a good night's sleep after a long day. The provided coffee-making supplies will also help you start your day right. An excellent deal for a good base in West/South Seattle.
2737012,22761524,2014-11-14,1091276,Xin,"My partner David and I enjoyed staying at Bethanie & Corey's garden studio. Their home was close to the airport which was convenient. After a long flight, their comfortable bed and warm place was exactly what we needed. We didn't meet the hosts in person, but Bethanie kept in contact with me, made sure we got the key codes, and let us park in their driveway. Inside, they also provided directions and instructions for everything we needed. The small kitchen bar had a coffee pot and kettle so we could make drinks and relax. The bathroom was also very spacious and had a hair dryer. I would definitely stay here again, it was a great deal! Thank you!"
2737012,22958914,2014-11-18,7808014,Katie,Had a great time at Corey and Bethanies! Perfect taking off point to explore Seattle and the parks around the city :)

There is not much I could say, because everything is awesome.
Highly recommend ! 

"
2737012,24004778,2014-12-16,3178442,Eric,"Corey & Bethany's little studio is awesome, clean and comfortable. We stayed 1 night while in town to see a downtown show and it was a quick drive downtown and back again, so the location is awesome not to mention all the cool spots to hang out in in nearby West Seattle & Georgetown. 
Corey & Bethany were very helpful and their communication and accommodation was great. 
We'll definitely stay again!"
2737012,24994094,2015-01-04,817405,Teresa,this is the second time i have stayed here and it is a great location for me - close to work/meetings and it is a quiet place for me to get work done as well!
2737012,25007157,2015-01-05,20776003,Nathan,"This cute little studio was just perfect for us.
We had a late flight in and their preperation ensured that we had quick and easy access into the place. The bed was comfortable, the bathroom and shower fantastic, and the kitchenett had anything we needed. 7/11 for a snack was just down the road.

 Corey and Bethanie were only an email away if we needed them. A definite go to for a night or two in Seattle."
2737012,25178907,2015-01-08,8639630,Travis,"I really wish I would've stayed here during a longer Seattle trip. The space is fantastic, the bed is very comfy, and it's great peace of mind to have a parking spot. I didn't get a chance to meet my hosts, unfortunately, but they were very responsive throughout the whole booking process. All in all, I'd highly recommend staying here!"
2737012,25487017,2015-01-17,26023923,Alexandra,"My boyfriend and I had a great experience at Corey and Bethany's. They put together a really cute getaway in an area of diverse homes. It was a really awesome place to sleep at night but I wouldn't recommend the neighborhood. We spent a lot of time downtown and in other neighborhoods like Queen Anne and Fremont. Driving down the alley to get to the home was a bit difficult in our car, especially considering the rain and mud, but overall, GREAT stay - we felt well taken care of, it was clean and everything was as pictured. Thanks guys!!"
2737012,26050070,2015-02-02,16712067,Jamie,"This place was exactly as promised. It's a nice little space at a great price. We appreciated the little extras like a mini fridge, snacks and drinks (tea/coffee), maps and books, and toiletries. The only difficulty we had was the alley in the back where you park your car, but that is not the host's fault. It's just a very muddy road that's filled with potholes, which made parking out back a little difficult. We liked that there was a nearby bus stop. There is not a lot within immediate walking distance aside from a few convenience stores."
2737012,26101559,2015-02-03,817405,Teresa,"This is the 3rd time i have stayed here!  It really suits my needs and is so affordable.  Last time i accidentally left a necklace in the bathroom and Bethanie saved it and remembered to give it back to me!  (thank you!) 

I have had good sleeps here because the neighbourhood is so quiet!"
2737012,26232896,2015-02-07,25669354,Andrea,Great place to stay! Just what we needed for a night in Seattle. Located in a quiet neighbor with easy access to freeway. Very clean and private with the most comfortable bed. 
2737012,26263596,2015-02-08,26436671,Erin,"We had a great (albeit short) stay at Corey & Bethanie's little studio! They responded quickly to our request to stay and to our questions along the way. The room itself was clean, secure, and comfortably decorated - we felt right at home! The directions for finding it were also very clear, though parking a car in the alley was a little tricky (but the tips for how to get in and out were appreciated). If we are in need of a place in West Seattle again, we'll happily return!"
2737012,26496948,2015-02-14,26797739,Denise,"This studio is very comfortable, clean, functional and well decorated! I'm thoroughly enjoying my stay here and I'll see you again in a few days! Thanks!"

Highly recommended if you need an inexpensive, comfortable stay near Seattle."
2737012,26745816,2015-02-18,26208590,Nick,"Staying at Cory & Bethanie's little garden studio was a personal gem. Had everything we needed and nothing more. Awesome little spot on top of the hill in west seattle and quiet. Their instructions were clear and simple and honestly couldn't of asked for anything better. Perfect, inexpensive stay!"
2737012,27406558,2015-03-03,9965628,Ashley,Really enjoyed the stay at their place and they were amazing hosts with the little amenities they had for us! Definitely too short of a trip! Would love to stay at their place again!

2737012,27674573,2015-03-09,24379547,Rachelle,I love it when airbnb rooms have key pad entries. It makes it so convenient when we are planning a late check in. No need to arrive early and pre-arrange a key pick-up! And the bed at Bethanie and Corey's is just so comfy! 
2737012,27775977,2015-03-11,28409317,Kelli,"WONDERFUL place! Corey and Bethanie were super helpful in giving us directions prior to our visit, corresponded promptly, and made sure our needs were met. The studio itself is amazing. well decorated, well lit, cute, and home-y. Highly recommended!"

2737012,29654428,2015-04-11,8470905,Marissa,We absolutely loved Corey & Bethany's guest house! We arrived late so they left the lights on for us. The bed was super comfortable and we loved having the maps for seattle buses. There were so many little touches that made our stay so much better! We would definitely recommend staying here and when we return to Seattle will definitely be contacting Bethanie & Corey!
2737012,30069160,2015-04-17,23002937,Karen,"I stayed in Corey and Bethanie's suite twice within a very short time.  It was very quiet, comfortable and clean.  They were very responsive when I had questions.  I would stay here again and recommend it."

They clearly put a lot of thought and energy into hosting on a regular basis. Felt like I was staying with friends and was the perfect first impression to Seattle."
2737012,32130918,2015-05-14,3139978,Pauline,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Corey and Bethanie's charming studio. It has everything we need for our stay; great comfortable bed, coffee and tea, free wifi, wonderful bathroom. Even though it is not closed to downtown Seattle, we actually enjoyed being in the 'real' Seattle, commuting in the bus and seeing everyday life of Seattle."
2737012,33239707,2015-05-26,6726186,Cliff,"Great place, very cozy and cute.  Easy parking.  Room is perfect for a couples getaway.  Everything furnished in bathroom, didn't use it but they even leave sunscreen out for you to use.  Has microwave (be careful, it's small but powerful!) and small fridge, coffee maker and kettle for making tea.  No TV, but you didn't come to seattle to stay in and watch TV.  Would definitely stay again!"
2737012,33450738,2015-05-28,7535095,Mick,"This listing is accurate in its description. The garden entry way is very inviting and the interior is cozy. It was clean and comfortable with a list of answers to questions on almost any you might think of. When we arrived they had left an interior light on which was most welcoming. We had complete privacy and spent portions of two evenings sitting and enjoying.
The bed was very comfortable, linens clean and everything that we would need for a stay was thought of. The price was right on this listing and we would recommend it to anyone wanting to stay in this quiet, residential, neighborhood."

2737012,34849992,2015-06-13,29130611,Gabriel,"This is a great little place to stay for 2 people. Very comfortable and quiet. It was great to be able to come ""home"" to this after spending the days out and exploring Seattle. Corey and Bethanie provided everything we might have needed from Seattle travel books to shampoo and other toiletries. They were very informative before our stay which made finding the house and checking in really easy. We would definitely stay here again. "
2737012,35378749,2015-06-18,9225864,Kyle,"Description was very accurate, Corey and Bethanie were wonderful hosts for our needs. My wife, infant son, and I arrived late at night and getting is was no problem since they have a key pad entry. We were there for multiple days/nights and with a rental car, we were able to easily access Seattle and the surrounding neighborhoods. The neighborhood itself was very quiet and peaceful. We slept with the windows open and outside noise was minimal. 

The space seemed larger to us than we had anticipated based off of pictures. Everything was as stated on airbnb or better. We would love to stay here again on future trips to Seattle and I recommend this as a great place for anyone who is looking for a quiet, comfortable, affordable place to stay. "
2737012,35549848,2015-06-20,4718410,Monika,"We loved this space! West Seattle is so cute and fun (Alki Beach and California Avenue, for example, are amazing!), and we enjoyed that we could explore West Seattle and head into the City. The space was well decorated, private, cozy, clean, and super comfortable. Corey and Bethanie were very responsive. We would definitely stay here again. "
2737012,36093728,2015-06-25,31484114,Alexander,"Great place to stay if ever visiting Seattle! The studio is in a quiet neighborhood about 10-15 minutes from downtown. Corey and Bethanie had many amenities for us to use (coffee, fridge, microwave, shampoo, etc.) If we are ever back in Seattle, we will would love to stay there again! "
2737012,36666879,2015-06-30,11395903,Tracey,"The studio is very clean and quiet. It looks better in-person than in pictures. There is a real box spring and mattress than the sofa bed shown in the picture. The bathroom is big and well equipped with everything I needed. It is a very homey cozy inviting studio to relax after a long day of work or sightseeing. 
I didn't meet the host, but they seems to be very considerate and caring. We arrived very late in the evening, and they let the studio light on for us. The second day we came back early evening and notice they move the patio umbrella closer to the French doors to block the sunset light to the room so that the room wont get too hot.  
I enjoyed my stay very much and I would definitely stay there again for my next trip to seattle. "
2737012,37852413,2015-07-11,32778022,Brenda,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 nights and it was wonderful! This was our first trip to Seattle and our hosts Corey and Bethanie were great! We never saw them in person but they were always available thru email/ text. The neighborhood is nice and the location was great.  We had no trouble travelling to downtown Seattle, Ballard, Fremont, Safeco field for a Mariners game and even Vancouver for a day trip. The studio itself is even more beautiful in person, very inviting eclectic décor and everything you need to be comfortable while on vacation (refrigerator, microwave, maps, iron, toiletries etc.) There are also some great places to eat in West Seattle like Marination Mai Kai and Seattle Fish & Co. If you are traveling to Seattle we highly recommend you stay here, you'll love it!!"
2737012,38095134,2015-07-13,13698622,Mario,"The studio was better in person than pictured. I love the privacy and ambiance of the room. Space was more than plentiful and the convenient supply of a mini refrigerator, microwave, and coffee maker made it all the more welcoming. I will definitely return if they will have me back."
2737012,38483362,2015-07-16,13537774,Lily,This was such a beautiful place to stay. It had everything we needed. The location was great and right down the street from a bus stop. We were a little worried about it not having a/c but it was perfect with the windows and french doors being open.
2737012,39160792,2015-07-21,31744186,Tiffany,"This was our first Airbnb experience so we weren't really sure what to expect but Corey & Bethanie were great hosts and the place was lovely! Everything was clean and the extra amenities of plates, silverware, tea, coffee, cups, fridge and more were so nice to have. They also had books and pamphlets for area  information. We got in late at night from a day of traveling and the key pad lock was a bonus so we didn't have to worry about keeping anyone awake to meet us with a key. Another plus was being able to leave our rental car there while we took the bus into the city and didn't have to deal with finding parking downtown. The bus stop was only about a block away. I would definitely recommend their place if you're going to be in the Seattle area. Thanks again!! "
2737012,39910074,2015-07-27,26188350,Chasen,"Really fantastic place in West Seattle. Was cozy, relaxing, and the hosts thought about all the little details to share such as how to find the parking in the back ally and how to avoid the end of the back ally drive way. Had no troubles getting to Seattle we took the 125 bus which drops you off right in downtown and just rode it back to get back home. Found a really fun bar that is a 10 min drive located in West Seattle called Vidiot where you can play free arcade games. Overall would hands down stay here again. "
2737012,40212494,2015-07-29,28119947,Brian,"The owners thought of everything! Really comfortable bed and cozy studio overall. There's even a fan for white noise/cool breeze in the summer months, which we really appreciated. The neighborhood  is cute and quiet (we took a walk for about an hour), with friendly neighbors and pets. We went into Seattle both days of our trip, and felt like the house was 20 minutes from everything! Very convenient if you don't want to stay in the city. We loved it!

There's even a kitty that came to the back door and accepted our loving pats on its adorable head!  

We hope to come back again in the future!
"
2737012,40909869,2015-08-03,23313850,Katie,"Their place was absolutely adorable!  We didn't rent a car, but most places we went was about an $11 uber ride away.  Their space was perfect for what we needed!  The backyard area was great for relaxing in the mornings with coffee.  I would for sure stay their again!"
2737012,41916782,2015-08-10,15493447,Sara,The unit is very clean and the bed is super comfortable!  The location is a little odd but it's very close to a bus stop which we used for most of our trip which was very convenient.  Very simple check in and was able to communicate with host easily.
2737012,43648212,2015-08-21,35043611,Debbie,It was my first time using an airbnb and it was great! If you're looking for a nice quiet place away from the city then this is the place for you! 
2737012,44755019,2015-08-29,31312579,Joyce,"This studio was very spacious and in a nice quiet neighborhood. I enjoyed staying here very much.  The alley entry was a bit of a challenge for my son's vehicle, but it was a short walk for me to meet him at the street. My only challenge was having to reject the entry request of a nice polite cat that would appear at the door, since I'm allergic.  It would have been nice to have a screen door to allow air circulation. Overall I would highly recommend this studio for anyone wishing to stay in the West Seattle area.
 "
2737012,45461573,2015-09-03,31866144,Jan,"Wir kamen relativ spät bei Dunkelheit am Flughafen Seattle an. Aufgrund der guten Wegbeschreibung von Corey und Bethanie konnten wir von dort das Apartment aber gut finden. Das Apartment ist gut gelegen, vom Flughafen sind es nur 10-15 Minuten Fahrtzeit. Man ist mit dem Auto auch schnell Downtown oder am Alki Beach.
Das Apartment an sich war recht klein, aber das hatten wir nach der Beschreibung auch erwartet. Für unseren Kurzaufenthalt in Seattle daher genau richtig. Das Apartment war sauber, es gab ein Bücherregal mit Reiseführern, Kaffee gratis, Internet und einen kleinen privaten Gartenbereich.
Corey und Bethanie haben wir nicht persönlich angetroffen, der Kontakt via Mail oder Telefon war aber jederzeit möglich."
2737012,45922957,2015-09-07,17179505,Kate,"The studio was great, super comfortable bed, large bathroom, good location and private. My husband and I are pretty low key and not the most social when we travel, and our hosts gave us the space we needed. Everything was as described (even the insanely steep and bumpy alley when entering from the wrong direction - oops! haha) I would HIGHLY recommend staying here. "
2737012,46664723,2015-09-12,39181288,James,"Our stay in the studio was great. It was very homey, the internet was stable and fast, and we had a kitchenette to hold snacks and leftovers. They even provided ground coffee to use in the coffee maker! For the budget traveller, the #125 bus is only a couple blocks away and will take you right downtown for $2.50. We did this multiple times, and we didn't have any problems. Highly, highly recommended. "
2737012,48068854,2015-09-23,22038713,Veronika,"This place is awesome. We haven't spent long time at Bethanie and Corey's apartment, but that short vacation was perfect. Very nice neighbourhood, bus is a couple blocks away to downtown. The place is exactly how it looks like on the photos. And Bethani and Corey were always avaliable to respond any questions. We really enjoyed staying there. Would recommend to anyone. Thanks again!"
2737012,48435271,2015-09-26,27756499,Mai,"It was a cute, comfortable & super private room. Less than 1 min drive to the small store, about 20mins from downtown. 
I totally enjoyed staying there. Thank you! "
2737012,48688454,2015-09-28,7899631,Leah,"This place was just perfect for us. We were there for the weekend for a wedding and we're looking for an easy to access, stress-free, low-key place. This was it. Just as described. The alley access is a little rugged but our old Corolla can handle it, anything can."
2737012,49619380,2015-10-05,41330443,Emily,"We absolutely loved our time at Bethanie & Corey's studio in West Seattle. It was just as we expected it to be and Bethanie & Corey were great. While we didn't meet them face-to-face, they were easy to contact about resolving a little issue we had at the studio. They even left us candies and a note as an apology, although one wasn't necessary b/c it wasn't their doing. Regardless, the issue was resolved within hours and all was good. The studio was quiet and serene. Location was great. Proximity to Alki Beach, downtown Seattle and even Ballard was FANTASTIC. As noted, the place is a little tough to find at night if you haven't been there before so I'd suggest arriving before sundown (we did and it was easy to return to later in the dark). We'll definitely be back the next time we return to Seattle! "
2737012,50168677,2015-10-10,39183216,Nicole,What a wonderful stay we had! Anyone looking for an easy stay in Seattle this stay is highly recommend! What a great stay for our first Airbnb experience!  
2737012,50623939,2015-10-13,20990108,Chance,The studio was so cozy! My wife and I enjoyed it very much and as everyone else has mentioned the bed is SO comfortable. We chose to use Uber to get to and from any distant places which was great. They even have an umbrella for you so you can fit in with all the other tourists.  Bethanie and Corey were also accommodating when we needed to check out a little later. I would absolutely recommend this studio to those looking to stay in West Seattle. 
2737012,50963794,2015-10-16,13927794,Anabell,"This is a great, cozy space! It's incredibly accessible and the pictures and description are very accurate. Would recommend this space to anyone looking for a nice place in Seattle.  "
2737012,51554190,2015-10-21,44887981,Anna,"Corey and Bethanie were great hosts! Hardly saw them at all, but they were responsive with any questions I had! Great stay! "
2737012,52242197,2015-10-27,45035211,Nick,"This place was absolutely perfect for us. We were welcomed, after a bit of traveling, by a clean, cozy and warm studio apartment. The location is also great, being in West Seattle. It's very simple to get around, if you have a car, and is very close to the highway if you wish to go to downtown Seattle. I would suggest this place to anyone traveling to Seattle! Thanks so much, Bethanie and Corey."
2737012,52490491,2015-10-30,25332580,Nikki,My boyfriend and I only stayed two nights but the little studio was so comfortable and warm and oh so cozy. It was not too far from downtown and super easy to navigate. We really enjoying our comfy studio. 
2737012,53177336,2015-11-06,43774523,Sarah,"Really helpful directions and instructions. The place was clean and very cute. Thanks, you two, for helping make my folks' stay enjoyable!"
2737012,53749018,2015-11-12,42068807,Blair,"The house rules were very strict here. And after we got back from dinner on our first night, we noticed things had been moved and doors closed that we had left open. Think they came in after we dropped our stuff off. "
2737012,54315907,2015-11-18,45072255,Blake,We loved our stay in the private studio.  The studio is very well kept and perfect for those wanting stay out of the downtown area. I would have no reserves about staying in this cozy little studio again!
2737012,54697506,2015-11-23,38559840,Tyeler,"
The place was spectacular. It was cozy, clean, and close to downtown. Corey and Bethanie provided dishes, coffee, tea, and other amenities, making it feel like you were staying at a friend's house."
2737012,56028321,2015-12-08,17224302,Rachel,"This is feedback I received from my mom, who stayed here with my sister for the weekend: Cozy. Private. Comfortable bed. Outside entrance with small patio. Good for two, but no more. "
696004,2965846,2012-11-26,3817573,Rhonda,"My parents had a wonderful stay at Wendy's.  Not only is the apartment beautiful; it is warm, cozy and sparkling clean.  She has a wonderful gas fireplace that they really appreciated.  You can tell she put everything together with a lot of love.  It is very close to a lot of places which you can access by bus, i.e. downtown Seattle, South Center Shopping Mall and the happening spots in West Seattle.  They would definitely choose to stay there again on their next visit.   "
696004,5405691,2013-06-28,3015336,Mercedes,"Wendy is a great communicator, and listened to my needs and wants. She was present and friendly.  "
696004,5933083,2013-07-22,2408087,James Won Seok,"Wendy's place was a nice cozy and spacious place.  It looks much more cozier in person, the pictures do not justify. I liked how it has a separate keyless passcode entry, so i didnt have to worry about checking in too late and needing to wake up the host (though she did come down to give us a warm welcome anyway!)  Wendy was a great host, the instruction book is a blueprint to everything in the house and she is thorough in explaining all amenities. She'll try her best to meet your needs for the stay if its not already accomplished. "
696004,6089124,2013-07-29,274814,Kathleen,"We thought Wendy's place was quite nice. It gave us the opportunity to explore West Seattle, and still be close to the rest of the city.
She was extremely helpful in every way.Her place is very quiet, and well set up. "
696004,6259261,2013-08-05,6811243,Wei,"Staying with Wendy was amazing! She is a great and very helpful communicator. She was helpful with directions and gave us advice on what bus we should take to downtown Seattle. We had correspondence prior to our arrival and she was detailed and thorough with her answers, it felt like we knew the area already. We arrived after 9:00 pm and she came down to greet us. She is such a happy and enthusiastic person. She immediately made us feel at home. She even went through the trouble of looking up restaurants opened at that time because we had told her we were hungry.

The apartment was gorgeous! Couldn't have asked for something better. Private entrance, own living room, bathroom, and private bedroom. Everything private. It was unbeatable. Best airbnb experience we've had so far! And Wendy knew so much about the architecture of the apartment. Everything was so clean. Wendy really does know how to take care of her tenants. We weren't left wanting in any way. She had everything prepared for us.

It was a very pleasant stay! Thank you Wendy and we hope to see you soon, on our next trip to Seattle (whenever that may be).

Many thanks,

Wei & Daniel"
696004,6401568,2013-08-11,7512985,Suzi,"Wendy's property was in a great location just a 15-minute drive from downtown Seattle.  It was nice to be slightly distanced since it made finding parking a lot easier.  Speaking of which, Wendy allows you to park in her driveway so you don't have to worry about parking on the street.

The unit itself was very clean and Wendy welcomed us with some fresh fruit as well as breakfast muffins and yogurt in the fridge.  The space is private and cozy, nicely renovated.  It's easy to access the unit with your own separate entrance with key code so you don't have to worry about losing a key.

I would recommend this place to someone staying in Seattle, it is much cheaper than the hotels in the city and is conveniently located and clean. "
696004,6501258,2013-08-14,7181910,Gilat,"We had a great stay! Wendy's place is beautiful and welcoming and she was a lovely host. The only downside was the location - very far from the downtown and other attractions. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend staying here!"
696004,7019103,2013-09-03,7916791,Kevin,I had a very nice stay. The apartment was very private and comfortable.
696004,8122986,2013-10-16,9209977,Terri,"We stayed at Wendy""s apartment on a visit to Seattle; West Seattle is a great place to stay, a little away from the hustle and bustle, but not to far away from the city.  Wendy's place is in the southern part of West Seattle, so it's a few minutes from the main part of West Seattle, but very easy to get on main highways.  The apt is very cozy,very beautifully furnished, and very handicapped accessible if that is needed.  Wendy was very helpful in answering questions and making sure we were settled."
696004,12886712,2014-05-13,13355111,Hope,"My mom and I stayed in this delightful apartment together for a week. My mom arrived before I did and Wendy was very helpful in showing her around the apartment. This sweet apartment was more than I expected. High ceilings, lots of windows and very spacious. The apartment is completely private and very quiet. Wendy has outdone herself with the extra touches! A fully stocked kitchen including juice, milk, an assortment of keureg coffee, fruit, pots and pans for cooking. Even aluminum foil and olive oil. The bathroom is large and is also fully stocked with an assortment of shampoo, conditioner, toothpaste and organic hand cream. Why would you stay in a tiny hotel room when you can have an entire apartment? We have family in Seattle and come a couple of times a year and will be staying here again!"
696004,14431758,2014-06-19,14566665,Jim,"We traveled to Seattle recently to visit our son, daughter-in-law and grandson, soon to be 4 years old.  My wife is disabled and we were traveling on a budget.  When Airbnb was first suggested we were a little skeptical, but when we met Wendy, our hearts and minds were so relieved.  She was a marvel. Her apartment was beautiful and had all the amenities listed, plus much more.  Wendy's charm was engulfing from the very first time we met.  The apartment was immaculate, roomy, wonderfully appointed and full of locale advice.  Her hospitality and wisdom of the area would make this the perfect place for any traveler to stay when visiting Seattle.  We felt truly Blessed to have met and stayed with her.  We certainly hope that we may experience her company on a future trip. "
696004,15069673,2014-07-01,16944639,Óðinn,"Wendy was very friendly. We loved staying there. Private entrance and a private apartment with access to free wifi and a washing machine. A few blocks away we could catch the bus to downtown Seattle. The bus ride is about 40 min and just about 20 min by taxi. Taxi fare is about $30.

We would recommend asking Wendy as she knows about hidden pearls in Seattle. Thank you Wendy for our stay."
696004,15325345,2014-07-07,12189613,Yuchien,Wendy is a very responsible person. She replied my message very promptly whenever I have questions. 
696004,15562502,2014-07-11,12116632,Derek,"The accommodations were exactly as described, very private (entire basement area with separate locking door) and spacious. Wendy was very gracious and even went out of her way to print us bus maps to help us navigate from West Seattle to downtown. The area is a little far from downtown if you do not have a car (~30 mins by bus) but this is clearly described in the listing and there are multiple bus options to get to and from Seattle from Wendy's house. Overall I would recommend staying at Wendy's apartment for anyone looking to enjoy the Seattle area."
696004,15699345,2014-07-14,16795027,Anna-Mae,"My partner, her mom and I traveled to Seattle recently to attend a wedding.  The apartment was in a safe neighborhood, with friendly neighbors, conveniently located between downtown and the airport and was way more comfortable than staying at a hotel room.  We didn't have time to try the water taxi from West Seattle to Pier 50, but it seemed like a very nice alternative to driving.  Also, appreciated that Wendy's driveway was big enough for us to park our SUV rental.  Didn't need to worry about finding parking!  In addition, Wendy was very accomodating and allowed us to leave our luggage in the foyer prior to check in.  Lastly, with the keyless coded lock we didn't have to arrange a time to pick up keys.  Since we didn't know our schedule that was definitely a bonus.  Also, nice to not have to bring keys with us or worry about losing keys!"
696004,15894316,2014-07-17,17970263,Eric,"Beautiful place to stay.  Calling this space a basement doesn't do it justice, as it has full length windows and tall ceilings. Great space, great location, great host!"
696004,16020550,2014-07-20,16677223,Mallory,"Wendy was a GREAT host. She was incredibly helpful and welcoming. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and had a lot of extra amenities that made us feel right at home. Thank you Wendy! "
696004,16314577,2014-07-25,17680652,Geraldine,"Wendy was a lifesaver!

We needed a last minute place to stay with our 4 and 2 year old while our floors are getting refinished.  Wendy's 1 bedroom worked out great for us.  

The 1 bedroom slept our 2 children and the apartment was the perfect size to accommodate us all.  While cable tv wasn't offered, the Wi-fi provided allowed us all the streaming content we needed on our iPad to keep our kids busy and occupied.  We had everything we needed during our stay and recommend this apartment for their stay in West Seattle."
696004,16485994,2014-07-28,9198162,Whit,Wendy was an awesome host. Even before we arrived she provided excellent references on where to ride our bikes as well as where to find gluten free food. We ended up riding her favorite ride which had excellent views of Seattle and other waterfronts. The apartment was very cute and clean. The location was very easy access to Seattle too. We will definitely stay with her again.
696004,16732602,2014-08-01,17785030,Daralyn,"The apartment was so large the kitchen efficient, toaster oven, induction stovetop, Miele refrigerator and freezer more then enough lighting throughout. Bath was large with all usual amenities you would find in a hotel, and more. bedroom large bed comfortable neighborhood was quiet and close to stores and restaurants. 

I would definately go back for another stay. Wendy was personable and made you feel really welcome even though she wasn't there her house sitter was helpful and extremely pleasant I give it 10 Stars **********!!!"
696004,16910281,2014-08-04,17367367,Victoria,We had such a great experience in Seattle at Wendy's. She was so kind and communicative prior to our stay. She even asked if there was any baby proofing we needed done for our eight month old! The apartment was so clean and comfortable. Wendy welcomed us when we arrived. It was like staying with an old friend. We highly recommend staying here and will definitely stay again in the future.
696004,17426884,2014-08-12,11701504,Kristi,Wendy's apartment is just as she lists it: beautiful and accessible.  We recently stayed there for almost a week for our daughter's wedding and it suited our purpose to a T.  It is quiet with great ventilation and very close to our daughter's home.  The shower is great!  We loved that the code to get in was a number that was easy for us to remember.  There are a couple of great breakfast places within walking distance. Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful with our extra requests.  We will definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.
696004,17650295,2014-08-15,19411856,Jason,"First off, the space is practical, attractive, clean, and quite roomy for a one bedroom. It is accessible, as advertised, and we also found it to be relatively safe for our one year old son who was just starting to walk. Parking for our vehicle was available in the driveway and we found the location to be convenient to access downtown Seattle, the freeway system, and Sea-Tac Airport. Another plus, we found the keyless entry to the suite to be particularly convenient - the last thing you want to worry about while on vacation is losing a key.

Second, Wendy was a hospitable and helpful host, going so far as to stock the fridge with some basics  and also providing a small snack for us upon arrival.  We didn't have a lot of direct interaction but Wendy was friendly and helpful, and made herself available if we required. 

We didn't get  much chance to explore the neighbourhood but there is a wide variety of restaurants nearby, some within walking distance. 

We would stay here again and would recommend the accomodations to friends without hesitation . "
696004,17978890,2014-08-19,19686819,Royia,"Our stay at Wendy's was perfect! It was our first experience with airbnb and it could not have been better. The house was very comfortable, close to everything, and she had plenty of information on what to do. We didn't see her for the first couple nights, although check in was flawless, and when we did meet her she was a joy to talk to- a human encyclopedia of the area and wildlife! We would definitely recommend her house!! Much better than a hotel room for sure! (And plenty of coffee!!) Thanks Wendy!"
696004,18101337,2014-08-21,20224312,Anna,"We had a great, very comfortable stay! Wendy is very hospitable and so kind.  The apartment is extremely clean and convenient.  All in all a fantastic stay."
696004,18671738,2014-08-30,19437888,Inga,"De foto's  geven een goed beeld van het appartement. De omgeving is rustig en White Center kleurrijk. Voorafgaand aan onze reis gaf Wendy nuttige informatie over gebruik openbaar vervoer. De ontvangst was heel hartelijk en Wendy had gezorgd voor melk, frisdrank, fruit en brood. Koffie en thee waren voorradig en het Keurig-apparaat werkte goed. Fijn dat er (afwas)zeep was en in de keuken basisproducten (suiker, zout, olie, kruiden, boter en wat cereals). Bed en slaapbank comfortabel en het linnengoed fris en schoon. We hebben geen gebruik gemaakt van de gashaard en de tuin. Busrit naar downtown duurt half uur. Bij afscheid kregen we tips mee voor excursies.
"
696004,18865391,2014-09-01,20692236,Briony,"Good place, just the location wasn't perfect and the closest strip of shops was quite run down and shabby...our street was lovely though. The house sitter was lovely and welcoming."
696004,19056263,2014-09-05,20736465,Dennis,"Wow.  What a nice treat!  The MIL apartment is an intelligently remodeled basement in a quiet South Seattle neighborhood. It is private and quite well appointed, with all the creature comforts of home. 

Wendy is a pleasant host,  full of knowledge and recommendations for things to do and places to go. I am happy to recommend her place for anyone passing through or coming to stay."
696004,19428244,2014-09-12,20172921,Hau,"Comfortable, Clean place. Great host, Nice Lady. I do recommend it. 
Thanks, Wendy. "
696004,19983754,2014-09-21,21285933,Elisabeth,"We had a wonderful time at Wendy's place!  There was a separate entrance to the apartment so it felt very private and the area was very quiet.  Wendy had a house manual that described in detail everything we needed to know about the space.  She even left us a bottle of wine and a few pastries to welcome us!

The space was clean, spacious, and very comfortable.  Everything was exactly as described (even better!).  She even has a keurig coffee machine with a variety of coffee K-cups, which was perfect for us as we are definitely coffee addicts!"
696004,21514906,2014-10-19,18766794,Chaila,"Wendy  – studio apt.

My wife and 6 year old daughter stayed at this location for 8 days in October. Everything was as we 

expected it from the airbnb ad. We enjoyed the convenience of being 10 miles from downtown Seattle 

and about the same distance to Sea-Tac but not actually being in the city. It was a great little area to 

come home to at night after a day of sightseeing. Wendy took care of any issues we had, which were 

limited to how to use the heating in the apartment and that was all. 

The only convenience which would have made it a touch nicer would be more TV channels especially for 

local sports. Not that we vacationed to Seattle to watch TV but it would have made catching up on all 

the sports news a little easier. We did have WiFi so logging into NetFlix wasn’t an issue for my family. 

No complaints... would highly recommend to anyone looking at visiting Seattle that doesn’t want to stay 

downtown but rather in a quiet, peaceful neighborhood within close proximity to all attractions. 

4.5 stars"
696004,22703551,2014-11-12,4339654,Philipp,"Wendy was a wonderful host and her place is great - cozy, located in a nice neighborhood and looks exactly as the photos. Hope to visit her again sometime :)"
696004,23344584,2014-11-29,23948715,Matthew,"Wendy's place was great; just as advertised: clean, comfortable and absolutely cozy. It was the perfect spot for my wife, 4-year old daughter and myself for the Thanksgiving holiday. Having a full kitchen and fridge was great - we could just go to the Safeway a few minutes away cook 3 meals a day (we didn't do that...but we could have, and you can if you stay here!). 
When we are back in Seattle, we would absolutely stay here again.

Also, the shower is incredible. 

Also also, Full Tilt Ice Cream Parlor on 16th street: small batch ice cream and pinball - does it get any better than that combination? 

But moving on...it's very easy to navigate all over the city and a breeze to get to and from the airport (we got an Uber in less than 10 minutes when I put in the order at 5:00 AM the morning we left). 

This was our first time using AirBnB and, thanks to the wonderful space our host provided for us, we are definitely true believers now. "
696004,24481814,2014-12-29,24021957,Cindy,"Wendy is absolutely an awesome host. The place she offers to us is exactly like how the picture show, smells good and the lights make the house so warm and so welcome. Thank you Wendy ! "
696004,24896336,2015-01-03,11330969,Luis,"We had a terrífic stay at Wendy's place! The flat looks just like the pictures! It a is a very comfortable place equipped with everything you need! Wendy was very prompt in responding to my requests, she stocked the fridge with food for us! She also has a Keurig machine with lost of K cups for breakfast!  And yes, the SHOWER is awesome! Look no further and stay at Wendy's! 

Thank you for your hospitality Wendy! "
696004,26344637,2015-02-09,17234353,Ivana,"Wendy is an awesome host, she is just incredibly helpful and friendly and a very natural and human person. She makes you feel like you are at home."
696004,32160786,2015-05-15,26747203,Mariya,"The apartment is very nice and very comfortable. It is located in a neat and quiet neighborhood. Everything is true to the photos posted. There's also a beautiful garden in the backyard.  Wendi, the landlord, is a super nice person and always willing to help if needed! It was a pleasure to deal with her.
[23:22:06] Inna Balutina Levien: I would stay there again."
696004,32619341,2015-05-19,6677682,Julie,"Great apartment, clean well set up, easy to drive to area of west Seattle. Worked perfectly for couple, daughter, grandson with a pack n play to sleep in. Wendy was very helpful in recommendations, instruction on using induction stove. Would highly recommend Wendy and her great apartment. "
696004,32912383,2015-05-23,12375502,Kazandra,"As soon as I walked through the doors I felt that ""at home"" vibe and Wendy has the personality to match. She is wonderfully kind and very informative from sights, to districts to even restaurants.  

The kitchen is perfectly sized if you want to do any of your own cooking. The bathroom is an amazing amenity. And the living room is very cozy.

I highly recommend to stay with Wendy for your next trip to Seattle!"
696004,34037665,2015-06-03,9596561,Sandra,Wendy was a great host. We enjoyed staying at her cosy place that offered all  the amenities and is located just a 15 minutes car ride from downtown Seattle.
696004,34255913,2015-06-06,32913250,Kathryn,"This was a nice space, however it is in WEST Seattle. This threw a major kink in our plans, so if you're not local - it's not close to downtown.

Other than location, it's a nice space, albeit a little noisy since it's a downstairs apartment."
696004,34468987,2015-06-08,32221966,Gordon,The apartment matched the listing very well from the beautiful wood floors to the great water pressure from the shower. We felt very much at home immediately once we walked into Wendy's apartment. Everything is nicely done in the apartment and very thoughtful in terms of providing what is needed. The unit is super clean with a nice kitchen fitting the four of us comfortably. 
696004,34752580,2015-06-11,27429113,Jamie,Nice suburban neighborhood with great access to the airport and downtown.  Great little apartment with lots of coffee and everything else to make you feel comfortable.  Highly recommended
696004,34961968,2015-06-14,22327446,Marissa,Wendy was a great host and the directions made it easy to find. We enjoyed out stay very much!
696004,35327676,2015-06-17,34482398,LeAnne,"The apartment was clean and nice.  The shower was awesome.  The bed in the bedroom was very uncomfortable.  We were disappointed with the living room furniture and T.V.  No cable was a bummer.  After a day of touring the city, it would have been nice to relax and watch television on comfortable furniture."
696004,35795769,2015-06-22,31944164,Jill,"Wendy was a fabulous host.  Her accommodations were just what we needed for the four of us (all adults). It is very convenient to downtown Seattle and the SeaTac airport. We had a car,  so not 100% sure on the public transit,  but I am sure Wendy can help with that.  The apartment had a full kitchen and bathroom. We were able to cook some meals at ""home"" and save some money.  We would definitely stay here again,  we felt right at home."
696004,36201966,2015-06-26,32935050,Melissa,"This is a great location, close to lots of great dining sand parks. The apartment is comfortable with great kitchen and bathroom amenities. Wendy is a great host with tons of info that she is happy to share! Thanks Wendy!"
696004,36403096,2015-06-28,18350326,Dana,Our stay at Wendy's was amazing. Her home was cozy and very welcoming. Her house is close to the freeway and just 15-20 minutes from downtown Seattle. We enjoyed the wonderful amenities she provided us and I would definitely stay there again. 
696004,36878696,2015-07-02,7467379,Joy,Wendy welcomed us and showed us around the apt.  She answered our questions about the area and about things to do.  The bed was comfortable and the walk-in shower was very nice.  Wonderful apartment!
696004,37146454,2015-07-05,125578,Jay,"Wendy and her place were AMAZING! It's definitely wheelchair accessible and friendly. We had 2 chairs in there and were able to maneuver perfectly. Wendy was super attentive, and got us everything we needed and then some. I would definitely stay again!"
696004,37488755,2015-07-07,15429510,Stacey,"Wendy was a wonderful host! She was welcoming, knowledgable and accommodating. The apartment was lovely and clean. "
696004,38191477,2015-07-13,36655627,Julie,Well-appointed basement apartment. Very comfortable and very well designed. Wendy was a delight.
696004,38607197,2015-07-17,34318181,Dena,"Wendy was extremely welcoming, she provided an easy to use keyed that was super convenient to use during our stay. She came and introduced herself and asked us if we needed any help with any of the equipment in the apartment and let us know she was available if we had any questions. 

Her guidebook is amazing and thorough! She has a ton of info in it (i.e. places to eat, things to do, manuals for equipment in the apt). She was very inviting and offered up any food that was in the kitchen to us. We were also able to pick blackberries from her front yard, which the kids enjoyed.

The neighborhood isn't the fanciest area but it was safe and affordable and located close to freeways. 

The bed in the bedroom was comfortable and her place is setup so nicely for a rental. The apartment is beautiful and my husband enjoyed the ramp outside so he he didn't have to lug the luggage up and down any stairs. You could hear people walking upstairs at times but it wasn't too loud and didn't wake us up or anything. "
696004,38877514,2015-07-19,16707861,Manuel,"We arrived late and wendy was so kind that she was awake and ready to assist where necessary. We had a pleasant stay and the house is comfy. Its a bit out of town but, with a car, it was fine for us. Defenitely recommended."
696004,39321391,2015-07-22,1588535,Margaret,"Wendy's apartment is comfortable, quiet, and clean.  Its convenient to the city if you have a car or want to jump on a bus.  Wendy is friendly and welcoming.  This beats the high cost hotels in Seattle. "
696004,40106753,2015-07-28,35239037,Jessica,"Although we didn't meet Wendy in person, she made us feel very welcome by sending thoughtful text messages, including offering to change the schedule of her contractors so we could have a quiet experience.  We arrived a bit early and her housesitter and cleaners were accommodating in letting us in early, which was great as we have two small children.  The apartment was exactly what we were looking for: quiet, nice kitchen, easily accessible and convenient location.  A perfect stay for us.  Thank you, Wendy."
696004,40463274,2015-07-31,20377764,Carol,"Enjoyed our stay. Apartment was spacious and comfortable. Great place to come to at the end of the day. Having a kitchen allowed us to have a sensible breakfast each morning before heading out for the day.  Wendy was easy to work with before arriving. We had no issues finding the apartment or a grocery store nearby.  Really enjoyed being out of the city a little. It was not difficult to get anywhere we needed. It's a great area to explore - White Center, Alki, Burien. "
696004,40767255,2015-08-02,36555481,Molly,"Wendy was out of town the day we arrived, but there was someone there to greet us and show us the ropes.  The apartment is so cozy and was perfect for the three of us.  We were attending an event in West Seattle so this was extremely convenient.   
There are plenty of thoughtful details in the apartment and it felt more like a home than a sterile hotel or other accommodations.  We had off-street parking which was comforting in an unfamiliar neighborhood. 
Wendy returned home from her trip on the second day of our stay and came down to check in when we arrived 'home,' and make sure we had everything we needed.   She was responsive before our arrival and explained everything very accurately so we had no issues getting settled in. 
Overall this was a great stay that suited our needs perfectly.  We felt welcome and found everything we needed in this home.  Thank you Wendy!"
696004,41734795,2015-08-09,16917396,Steven,Experience was great. The apartment was well setup and there was food available for cooking. The host did a quick intro of the place which was helpful. 
696004,42296076,2015-08-12,17310187,David,"Wendy was great, she greeted us when we arrived, showed us around the place, gave us some tips for traveling through Seattle and had some food and drinks waiting for us and our family. The place was nice with a great bathroom and great kitchen amenities (e.g. induction stove top). "
696004,42765984,2015-08-15,6191550,Elise,"The place is quiet, clean, and comfortable. It is on the floor level but not underground, and the house is in a garden, so it is light. 
We staid there with our 2 young children, the apartment is big enough, and the sofa was comfortable to sleep on. The apartment is planned to be wheelchair accessible, we do not have a wheelchair but it means that there is enough space in every room and it is practical with young children. The open kitchen is well equipped. You can use the laundry washer and dryer.
The area is calm, individual houses with gardens. This location is great if you want to rest after a day in the (very busy and noisy) city center, less so if you want to go out at night then walk back home. 
You can park your car besides the house. We reached Seattle center by direct bus in slightly more than a half hour (planning our departure hour with google maps), and by car a little faster. 
Wendy was very friendly and helpful at all times. 
I would definitely advise to my friends and family to stay there. Highly recommended."
696004,43232094,2015-08-18,34849841,Giulio,"Our staying was so nice. I was there with my wife and my son of 8. Wendy received us with a warm hello. She is very kind. The house is as shows in the photo, even better. Wendy told us a lot of information and her book of guest (where she inserts every information about house and Seattle) is unbeatable. Never see in my trips. We never forget her and the house. "
696004,44777941,2015-08-29,22582755,Ashley,Wendy home was so comfortable for my family and I while we were in Seattle . The place was stock with towels and extra food she had offered us to use if we liked . Place was quite and very clean with a cozy vibe . She lots of reading material and always offered suggestion if we needed . Our beds were super comfy and clean with everything we could need ( ironing boards and night lights . She had breakfast options and tons of hot drinks for breakfast . 
696004,46325799,2015-09-09,41856799,Claire,"This place was nice and cozy with easy access to downtown Seattle. There was a lot of fun stuff available in the neighborhood as well, although parts of it were rougher than we expected. Overall a great experience though. "
5219336,32421944,2015-05-17,31145379,Jazmin,"I had a great time staying at Mariana's place. It was clean and spacious. The big windows give you a beautiful view and a lot of natural light. There was some wonderful art around the apartment, I loved it. It truly is a beautiful space. Mariana was kind and helpful the whole time. She was easy to get in contact with and was very flexible with the check in/out times. I would definitely stay here again! "
5219336,32668668,2015-05-19,24348931,Julia,"We had a great time staying at Mariana's beautiful apartment. It was clean, bright, and full of artistic touches that made our one night stay full of inspiration and ideas for stories. She was easy and quick to get in touch with and very helpful and lenient in our connecting to get the key. We also loved the plants, her doll collection, the piano, and had dinner out on the balcony -- the weather was perfect and the neighborhood was quiet. Thank you Mariana!"
5219336,33055753,2015-05-24,19135788,Moníca,"It was interesting staying at Mariana's. She obviously takes pride in her apartment, as well as an extensive doll collection. Her place was very clean. We did have a few communication errors, and as she rents out her entire apartment, she had to stop in a few times, which for me wasn't a problem, as I only needed the apartment for sleep and was gone most of my stay. The day I was supposed to arrive, she asked for more time to get the apartment clean, as she had guests checking out same day. I tried to give her the extra time but apparently gave her too much time. I wish she would have communicated that to me as she seemed annoyed about it when I did arrive. "
5219336,33489308,2015-05-28,16032,Steve,The host canceled this reservation 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5219336,35229410,2015-06-16,19198712,Jeffrey,The apartment is charming and is just as listed.  The host welcomed me and I was able to check in pretty early so I could enjoy the rest of the day.  The neighborhood is nice - there are a lot of other apartments in the area.  It's only a block away from a main street that has lots of shops.
5219336,35828788,2015-06-22,7274282,Heng,Mariana was a very welcoming host. She communicated well and tried to make our visit a comfortable and enjoyable time.  She was especially accommodating to our daughter who at the last minute needed to stay with us.  We really appreciated her flexibility.  She was also staying in the same building so we were able to easily contact her.
5219336,36551985,2015-06-29,33931246,Charlie,The place was really nice and clean.  It had a great patio with humming birds and plants.  Plus it was next to a few nice shops and a brewery with great food to help get my day started.
5219336,37080595,2015-07-04,12742403,Kendra,"Mariana's charming apartment was the perfect place to stay during a recent trip to Seattle to attend a wedding. Her apartment is spacious and sunny, full of happy plants and art. Mariana made us feel very welcome, and communication with her was clear and easy. We didn't have time to explore the immediate neighborhood, but we felt very safe and had easy access to the University District from the area. Wish we could've stayed longer!"
5219336,38761484,2015-07-18,13162342,Maxine,"Mariana was very accommodating / flexible to my hectic schedule for check in / out purposes, which I found extremely helpful.  She was kind and always responded promptly.  I was actually very busy during my stay in Seattle, so I didn't spend much time in the rental apart from sleeping.  But the rental is exactly what I expected from the listing and pictures.  "
5219336,39640729,2015-07-25,513244,Geoffrey,"Mariana was quite flexible in arranging time for check-in and check-out, the apt. was very clean, comfortable, quiet and accessible to all needs of travelers to the area of Seattle. All communications were responded to quickly. Mariana had basic staples for breakfast available in the fridge, although we were usually out the door early, and grabbed breakfast nearby. There is a Starbucks about a three-minute walk away, though in Seattle there are many other great local cafe alternatives to the Giant...
The Elliott Bay Brewhouse, only several blocks away, serves enormous portions of unique foods including sandwiches, dips, etc. not to mention a wide selection of local brews. Very friendly servers, too.
"
5219336,50973366,2015-10-16,6387104,Nathan,Great host! Great place!
6222245,42269006,2015-08-12,486835,John,"Compact flat, nicely appointed, small deck, two queen beds (one is couch foldout with air mattress), very comfortable. Easy walk to convention center, light rail, pike market. "
6222245,55294867,2015-11-29,9602512,Ron,"A nice, clean, and modern unit in a perfect location in downtown Seattle. We were visiting Seattle from Portland  for a little sight seeing, and we could easily walk to all the major sights from the unit. After a day of walking around, it was nice to come back to our room for a glass of wine and nice views, and then walk to one of the many nearby restaurants. My daughters also enjoyed a dip in the swimming pool. The only real downside for us (as a family of four) is that the unit was a little cramped for four people. It is a studio with a queen bed and a sofa bed. We actually didn't try the sofa bed as we had brought an airbed with us which worked okay, although the airbed took up most of the floor space in the apartment."
4947002,27695966,2015-03-09,24906168,Jesse,"Place is a mini Oasis, close the Green Lake, the Zoo, easy-easy access to downtown.  I would recommend this to anybody visiting Seattle.

Host is ""just the right amount of friendly"".   Made sure everything went well, was quick to answer any questions, provided insights into the surrounding area."
4947002,28682577,2015-03-28,1452570,Emily,Keith's guest house is fantastic! So cozy and comfy! Keith had yummy cookies to welcome us...what an added treat! Great location! Bongos cuban restaurant is within walking distance - so good! We would love to stay at Keith's place again! 
4947002,30312343,2015-04-20,29484129,Marjean,Our host made us feel welcome by first of all coming to find us when we got lost.  When we met them they were incredibly warm and greeted us with warm hugs like friends and freshly baked cookies were waiting on the table.  The place is very homey and clean and comfortable.
4947002,31785646,2015-05-10,29601184,Alejandro,"Keith was an amazing host, he accommodated us very well. The house was clean, spacious and he left instructions on everything as well as some tourist advise and recommendations. Overall it exceeded my expectations and if i go back to Seattle, I'll make sure to contact Keith again. "
4947002,34167620,2015-06-05,32197838,Tim,Keith was an excellent host. Extremely helpful and open with his home. Perfect little self sustained apartment. Great location next to a lake and plenty of pubs. I would recommend anyone coming to Seattle to say with Keith. 
4947002,34699012,2015-06-11,29975482,Roger,"Host made us feel welcome, listing correct, location safe."
4947002,35041018,2015-06-14,22900114,Kathy,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4947002,41730842,2015-08-09,28312302,Melissa,"Keith was a  wonderful host. The place was spacious, clean and well organized. There was plenty of tips for Seattle newcomers, like myself, that were much appreciated. Wonderful restaurants and a bus into downtown within walking distance (less than 2 minutes even!) I would definitely recommend staying with Keith!  "
4947002,42818057,2015-08-16,28837862,Mindy,"Freshly backed cookies, clean house, lightly stocked refrigerator,  and a personalized note addressed to our family was our welcome to Keith's house.  He also provides brochures,  and a binder with detailed information to help plan your activities while you visit the area."
4947002,45056100,2015-08-31,28315362,Thaedra,"We had a fantastic experience at Keith's place. As a completely separate downstairs apartment, it had absolutely everything we needed. The full-size kitchen was great – I could have cooked a five course meal for my family - but Keith gave us some AMAZING local restaurants to try and there was no need to cook. There was a ton of space and I recommend it for anyone with teenagers. Centrally located to everything you need in Seattle, and Keith and his wife are just fantastic people. Communication (and parking) just outstanding and I recommend with two thumbs up."
4947002,49445523,2015-10-04,27134582,Kelsey,"Keith was a great host! He was easy to get in touch with, the house was very clean, and he left freshly baked cookies.  Keith was very informative and had a binder of information for guests. The house is conveniently located near a variety of restaurants and beautiful Greenlake! "
4947002,50527736,2015-10-12,14387080,Diana,"Keith and Sue were wonderful hosts- they were available but left us our space as we liked. The location was perfect. Walking distance to Phinney Ridge shops and Greenlake, super easy access to the Rapid Ride bus to get downtown. The house was well-appointed. Traveling with 2 kids we appreciated the laundry facilities, extra towels, blankets, etc. We are looking forward to coming back next time we are in town!"
4947002,52327704,2015-10-28,43962692,Debbie,"Keith (and wife Sharon) were great hosts - great communication - pleasant and accommodating.  Home is exactly as described, was clean, bright, well stocked, VERY comfortable beds, FANTASTIC location within easy walking distance to GreenLake, Phinney Ridge, bus stop, easy car parking out front, thoroughly enjoyed our stay.  Our ONLY caveat is that you will be more comfortable staying here if you are not taller than 5'9"".  It is a basement apartment, as he states, but the ceilings are low.  We were both 5'9"" and 6'2"" and had to ""duck"" often."
4947002,54296626,2015-11-17,1801104,Jeanne,"The listing of the flat was spot on--fabulous; perfect for 4. The location was amazing, with great street parking, 1 block to easy downtown bus, a fabulous Cuban restaurant across the street, and cute shops/nice market within easy walk. And the lake! What a fun place to walk and people watch! Keith was very kind, making sure we had umbrellas, and all questions answered.  I can't imagine a better place in Seatle!"
6644760,41684066,2015-08-08,855816,Bill,Marc was in touch as we were arriving and indicated how to get to his place. A very peaceful and quiet neighborhood with plenty of shops and restaurants to s\chose from . He met us on arrival and showed us in . A very comfortable and complete and well furnished apartment with everything. Turned out to be the best choice for us. We both like to cook our own food. And cook we did. Marc gave us easy tips on how to get around. And was always available. I would recommend and certainly return to this perfect spot for Noi and me..He even offered to take me to my meeting at Washington University when the taxi never showed up..
6644760,42710182,2015-08-15,37847316,Nic,"Marc was great.  He was very quick to reply to any emails.  The pictures really are what you get.  What you don't see but that the description says, is how phenomenal the neighborhood is.  A lot of great shops, restaurants, and the lake is super close.  It is also only about a 15 minute drive from all of downtown(Space Needle, Pikes, Etc).  If you are looking for a great setting and a quiet stay this is the spot for you!  "
6644760,47722083,2015-09-21,41410394,Kathy,"Marc was a great host.  He was friendly and responsive, checking on us throughout the visit.  He upgraded us to his brand new Deluxe condo. It was fabulous, clean and well decorated with everything we needed.  This included a full kitchen stocked with every type of dish. pan, and utensil needed for cooking. In the bedroom  the king size bed was very comfortable and on the deck we enjoyed watching the clouds roll by.  We really loved the neighborhood. It was clean, quiet, safe for walking, full of quaint homes that were beautifully landscaped. We walked across the street to the lake and down the block to many fabulous eateries.  We loved the food and service at the Beach House restaurant.  I also appreciated that we had a designated parking spot and that the check-in and check-out was very simple.  We had a great experience and will be returning here next time we are in Seattle.  Would highly recommend. "
6644760,52246811,2015-10-27,14455251,Christine,"I have absolutely no complaints about this great place! The king-sized bed was a wonderful perk. We had everything we needed in a great location while we explored Seattle! It wasn't clear to me in the listing, but yes - you can see the lake from the front window! Even though there was a basement below us, the floors didn't creak at all (felt like we were on the ground floor) and the noise from the upstairs neighbor was extremely minimal and not a problem at all. You can't go wrong staying here!"
6644760,56115450,2015-12-09,45670640,Stewart,"Stayed at the property through November 2015, it is a very nice property in great condition.  Marc was a fantastic host and was always very helpful.  The were several little touches, like iced beer glasses, that made the stay memorable.
I definitely recommend.  "
7667990,46017328,2015-09-07,41675809,David,"Roie, was an excellent host! He responded to all my texts and emails in a very expedient manner. The property was exactly like it was in the listing---very clean, comfortable and cozy with a nice view of the Seattle skyline. The neighborhood was great---plenty of places to eat and hang out. Definitely recommend the property for couples who are looking to have a good time in the Emerald City!"
6215199,35384533,2015-06-18,15769563,Donna,"Ben and his family have a wonderful home in Seattle. It was perfect for our family vacation to celebrate our daughter's graduation from UW. We hosted two family dinners and the house was great for entertaining. Our grandson was delighted with the toys, books, and of course , the trampoline. We visit Seattle every year and the Katt family home is a delightful, comfortable, and convenient place to stay. Ben was always available to answer any of our questions. Definitely hoping to return."
6215199,36401524,2015-06-28,13015945,Lynn,"Ben was a great host and even though he wasn't around physically, he was always available by text and even had a local friend contact us to see if we needed anything.

The listing was very accurate and the neighborhood was nice and quiet. The place was very clean and had great amenities such as a piano and large tv =D I would definitely stay again! "
6215199,37079909,2015-07-04,35563918,Kate,"Ben and house were awesome! Perfect size for our family of 6. Ben even helped accommodate with a pack n play for our baby. He was super responsive to questions and had a very comprehensive manual to make sure we were prepared. The house was bright, clean, updated and perfect for a family. Would absolutely do business with Ben again."
6215199,41590945,2015-08-08,9914048,Alexandra,The neighborhood is not nice and we can't recommend it. We didn't keep any windows open at night because there was a lot of nighttime activities on the street.  The house furnishings are passable.  The host was out of country but was responsive when the internet wasn't working. 
6215199,42681317,2015-08-15,12777216,Jamie,"We had a great time at the house! It had everything we needed for fun. The location was great, the backyard and grill were fun for a relaxing evening. Our little one even found a few toys to play with. I highly recommend this place!"
6215199,43965813,2015-08-23,38630526,Gracie,"The house was clean and comfortable, and the House Manual was very helpful in helping us become acquainted with the house! All appliances worked well, and the beds were comfy. Ben contacted me directly about a wifi issue, which was nice. We loved staying here for the weekend! My friends and I felt instantly at home here and I'd definitely recommend Ben and his home to others!"
6215199,45956766,2015-09-07,13737052,David,"This house was wonderful for my friends and me (a group of 6), and Ben couldn't have been any kinder! We all slept well; the neighborhood was silent, and the beds were very comfortable. 

I would book here again if I were to come back to Seattle!"
174636,459361,2011-08-19,951451,Medora,The host canceled my reservation 4 days before arrival.
174636,461701,2011-08-20,694863,Fay,"5 STARS!!  Awesome hostess and awesome stay!  Michelle responded almost immediately to my booking request and was gracious from the first communication. This was a last minute booking so I was pleasantly surprised. The home is in a very quiet neighborhood with a breathtaking view of the lake. It is located only half a block from the #7 bus which runs all the way to downtown. Very convenient. The rooms were very clean and beautifully decorated. The bathroom and kitchen are wonderfully modern. The house is awesome; like a little sanctuary in the city. Michelle was very hospitable, and made us feel very welcome. A great experience all around! "
174636,480197,2011-08-27,1000967,Richard,"Honestly I'm not good at expression and description. But I have to say Michelle is a really kind, outgoing, and helpful person. She has a big house with beautiful view dinner room. The upstair balcony is best I have seen. Boxing bag, A kind of bed I don't know how to say, and.... Well, too much surprise. It's really good to stay here in Seattle. :)"
174636,486470,2011-08-29,815962,Rick,"Michelle is a wonderful lady, very accommodating and downright cool. Her place is huge with a spectacular view and comfortable bed(s). I highly recommend staying here. "
174636,872996,2012-01-20,1480086,Heidi,"Michelle, you were incredible!  Thank you so much for your kindness and help!!!"
174636,1259968,2012-05-10,2280451,Liza,"Michelle made me feel welcomed in the city of Seattle, WA.  Her house has a beautiful view of the beach, and she provided breakfast.  I was able to enjoy sunrise with my breakfast at her place.  It is a great place for a get away.  "
174636,1435417,2012-06-07,2530750,Mei,Michelle is a very nice host. We had everything we need in her house.
174636,1449873,2012-06-10,554337,Kris,"What can I say - EXCELLENCE everywhere you looked.  The beds were COMFORTABLE, the bathrooms weer opulent, the kitchen was amazing, the view from the top deck - to die for, and Michelle an outstanding host!  If you are in Seattle and don't stay here - you're missing it!  Kris"
174636,1509256,2012-06-18,2536384,Debra,"Michelle is great!  She welcomed us into her extremely beautiful and clean house, with loving arms.  We enjoyed her place so much that we are going back again in a few days."
174636,1877174,2012-08-03,122255,Tamara,"Picture didn't do this place justice! This view is amazing and Michelle is an awesome host! Will definately return, tell all my friends, blog, twitter-you name it. Michelle deserves the praise!"
174636,2042311,2012-08-20,2895294,Rhonie,"This was my first AirBnb experience & Michelle has set the bar extremely high! The photos absolutely do not do this place justice. The view is spectacular, the place immaculately clean and Michelle has absolutely thought of every detail a traveller might need down to the luggage rack in the room. This was absolute luxury travelling and the perfect space to reconnect with folks I haven't seen in a long time. 

She is the ultimate host and made us feel completely at home and at ease in her space. Michelle was always available if we had questions, made great recommendations on places to go in Columbia City and is just absolutely a fabulous and interesting person. I will absolutely stay there when I return to Seattle!"
174636,2183066,2012-09-03,3303294,Theresa,"We had a great time staying with Michelle! She was incredibly welcoming, the house was beautiful and comfortable, and the view from the rooftop deck was amazing! We especially loved baking in the gourmet kitchen and playing with Daisy the puppy."
174636,6384951,2013-08-10,2147326,Serena,My stay was short and sweet. Wish I could have enjoyed the awesome view of the lake. Having a furry bed mate was an extra treat! 
174636,6921189,2013-08-30,8074132,Rene',"Arrived late but was guided in by Marshall, Michelles' assistant. He was polite and a great host. Showed us the house, lovely place, and let us do our own thing. Beautiful Views Everywhere! The house was well kept and had a few extra amenities that made it that much better. Very cool experience, wish we had stayed longer. Next time we will!!"
174636,12264663,2014-04-27,2285223,Elizabeth,I contacted Michelle when the accommodations we had arranged for our friend from Canada had fallen through last minute and we needed a place for her that night. Michelle got back to me right away and was gracious enough to take the very last minute reservation. The house is beautiful and our friend really enjoyed staying with Michelle. Great host and wonderful house. Highly recommended.
174636,13521829,2014-05-29,14763229,Laura,Michelle was a great host! I arrived late on my drive back from Vancouver and was just in time to catch a gorgeous sunset from her roof deck. Her house has great views and custom fixtures throughout. It was the perfect end to my Pacific Northwest trip.
174636,17805931,2014-08-17,2085099,Andreu,"Michelle was such a wonderful host throughout my stay. Everything was ready for me by the time I arrived and was able to quickly settle down. The view from her house was absolutely stunning and I only wished I had more time to spend on her roof deck. Her lil' dog Daisy was so friendly as well. Would highly recommend this!
"
174636,18923746,2014-09-02,438773,Ori,Room was clean and as advertised. Michelle was very hospitable (thank you). Very nice patio on top of house - calm and peaceful.
174636,19246149,2014-09-08,2332570,Wendy,"This was my first Airbnb stay and Michelle was an excellent host. Her responses were quick and our stay was booked with just a week's notice. She greeted us upon arrival and made sure we were comfortable with the accommodations. Descriptions and photos were very accurate. Her home is very clean and well appointed. Beds were comfortable and the room had all you would need. The bathroom is very upscale and spa-like. The view is beautiful and made our stay extra special. It was a hot evening and we needed windows open to be comfortable. There was some neighborhood noise late in the evening (cars, cats, dogs & people) but that is probably expected in an urban area and wouldn't prevent me from staying again. "
174636,28781744,2015-03-30,3587888,Daniel,"I first need to say that I did not stay at Michelle's house, I arranged for my family to stay while they were in town on a short visit. Having said that, I want to say that working with Michelle was very smooth and a completely easy process. Her house is also lovely and my family was well taken care of. They are very interested in staying again, the next time they visit. And they loved the dogs. "
174636,35165107,2015-06-15,11076939,Allanah,"Michelle responded quickly and made our check in and out very easy. She was very kind, thoughtful and hospitable. Her house is absolutely lovely and the roof-top deck is outstanding. 
As it's about 20 minutes south of downtown on I-5, it's a great way to get a taste of a different part of Seattle. "
174636,37825928,2015-07-11,22773686,Ashley,The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
174636,38077111,2015-07-12,37940545,Diane,"Michelle was responsive and accessible, and made settling in quick and easy and comfortable; the space was just as advertised.  Comfortable bed, quiet room, convenient and well appointed bathroom, great deck with lake view.  My first Airbnb experience was terrific.  Michelle has a knack for being both hospitable and giving guests space.  The dogs were great!"
174636,38655548,2015-07-17,18724067,Jolie,"Very good clean house and friendly neighborhood.Michelle is a very nice person.there are lots stuff from the world .I have a very happy day.
很棒的房子，特别和我朋友订的房子相比。干净、自由。房子里都是房主各地旅行带回的纪念品，很是有趣。房东人很好，有求必应。"
174636,40056790,2015-07-27,10349726,Joe,"This is a lovely apartment and I was made to feel very welcome by Michelle, I highly recommend this place."
174636,40291285,2015-07-29,27157283,Talal,clean rooms and really great view
174636,40413253,2015-07-30,1128976,Vanessa,Michelle and her place were lovely. I had a last minute lodging request and she was quick to response and happy to accommodate. 
174636,40989477,2015-08-03,28528101,Francisco,My wife and I stayed for four days at Michelle's and she was a great host to make us feel at home! She was a delight to share the place with and she went beyond our expectations. The location was pretty good to explore the Seattle area and her place suited our needs for a relaxed environment pretty well. We enjoyed the lake views and sunrises from her rooftop.
174636,41269063,2015-08-05,3991799,Cori,Michelle was awesome. Super helpful and super chill. My first time traveling alone and staying in a shared home. It was wonderful. She's rad. 
174636,42324515,2015-08-12,37147601,Weston,"Michelle was very welcoming and had a lot of great ideas about places to visit/things to do.  The listing was accurate as presented and the view from the rooftop really is spectacular!  The neighborhood was safe and quiet.  Her house was within a 10-15 minute drive of downtown Seattle and Bellevue, as well as a close drive to many parks and restaurants."
174636,44386722,2015-08-25,42023787,Jonathan,"As this was my first AirBNB experience, Michelle set the bar high! She was very welcoming and was very flexible. The view was fantastic, and it was a great place for me to put my feet up, read a good book and relax.

I didn't spend a lot of time in the house, I basically was there for the night and a few hours in the morning on the patio. One thing I usually pay particular attention to is a bathroom (in hotels at least), and hers was phenomenal!"
174636,44426864,2015-08-26,6091449,Ana,"I was there for a brief stay, yet I felt welcomed. The cool decoration and laid-back atmosphere was fun. I wish I could have stayed longer. "
4016079,20124144,2014-09-23,21427641,Shengyi,"The house is located in one of the best neighborhoods in the area. The unit was renovated recently with spacious living room and kitchen.  it has its own washer and dryer. Big screen Apple TV is crystal clear with amazing surrounding sound system and many free choices. It seems to me the pictures in Airbnb were not well representing what you actually see.  After a long day, you can just jump into the outdoor Jacuzzi to relax and rest. 

For the best part, it is the host! Kathy is so nice and friendly. She treats all guests as her own real guest. Originally, there were only two beds in two rooms. But Kathy made a special effort to put two beds in each room at our request. She always tries to make guests feel comfortable and have a pleasant stay. She even takes guests, who do not have a car, for shopping. 

I want to thank Kathy to make guests so welcomed and comfortable!
Without question, I definitely recommend this place!"
4016079,22559625,2014-11-09,11713481,David,"This is a beautifully appointed private home with your own entrance. Kathy is a helpful and kind host who leaves special touches for her guests. The apartment is beautiful, comfortable and the windows look out onto a yard with nice trees. Kathy is genuine, compassionate and very welcoming. A great place to retreat after a busy day in Seattle!"
4016079,22999656,2014-11-19,17421340,Anjana,"Despite being a last minute booking, our host Kathy was very generous and provided accurate directions, ensured that the refrigerator and the kitchen had food and drinks for me and my daughter upon arrival that night. The property is located in a wonderful neighborhood, with a peek-a-boo view of the lake Washington and the cascade mountains from the kitchen. 
Generous, clean and comfortable space with two bedrooms, a living room with a fireplace, dining space and a generous fully stocked kitchen. There is exercise equipment, yoga mats etc. for those rainy  days that may keep you from outdoor activity. There is a nice patio and back yard. A separate entrance to your own space. 

The hosts were getting sound proofing materials added to ceiling of this space (the day we left) as they live upstairs and want to ensure a quiet peaceful experience for their guests.

We would definitely stay there again.

Extremely nice host."
4016079,23373012,2014-11-30,22584965,Lanie,"Our stay at the apartment was one of the best ones we've had in rental vacations. The apartment was beautiful. Even though it is a basement, the furnishings and how the place was laid out made it really nice and comfortable. Plus the fireplace and the heated floor in the bathroom made it really warm and cozy. 

Kathy was the best! She is gracious, welcoming and always accessible when you need her. She is just a text message away. She thought of everything that will make your stay  hassle-free and enjoyable. She stocked up the place with snacks, milk, juice and wine for us so we had something to eat after a long, tiring flight especially with 2 toddlers. The place had everything you need so you don't have to worry about laundry detergent, dishwashing liquid, trash bags etc.  She helped us to print our boarding passes  on the day we were leaving. She also gave us good driving directions on how to get out of the neighborhood safely after an overnight snowfall. We couldn't really ask for a better experience. "
4016079,27242035,2015-03-01,28529444,Heidi,The reservation was canceled 103 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4016079,27468292,2015-03-05,22987664,Bianca,"I stayed in this place as part of my transition from the east coast to Seattle. I am so lucky to have found this place! Kathy is the ultimate hostess. She not only made sure the accomodations were comfortable, but she went above and beyond to make sure I felt welcome and had a helping hand when needed. At this point, I would genuinely call her a friend! She made sure the place was constantly stocked with the essentials plus some nice extras like Keurig coffee of my choice.

The accomodations are beautiful. All the fixtures are up to date and pretty high end especially in the kitchen. The bath/shower are fantastic with heated floors as a nice bonus. The fireplace warms up the place and adds up nice atmosphere....though you will be plenty comfortable temperature-wise without the fireplace. I didn't get a chance to use the hot tub, but wish I did.

The neighborhood is quiet and gorgeous with all the huge houses. It's very safe with lovely walks right outside your door. You probably won't walk to town although there is a bus that you can take to get out of the neighborhood. But it is a quick drive to stores including University Village (beautiful outdoor mall), as well as an easy drive to all parts of Seattle. It's best if you're looking for a little get away from the city yet not wanting to be in the suburbs. It's especially perfect for visiting the University. 

All in all, I can't say enough good things about this place. You will love it and want to come back again and again. Staying with Kathy and her family is like staying with friends and family. I highly recommend it! "
4016079,29395667,2015-04-07,25939025,Tracy,We felt very comfortable and welcome!  The location is beautiful. The apartment exceeded our expectations and was well stocked with snacks and other goodies.  Kathy was so gracious and we really enjoyed our stay.  We have two young children and the space was great.  So glad we chose this airbnb instead of a hotel!!!
4016079,34772913,2015-06-12,29801985,Stephanie,"Kathy was a wonderful host and the home even better than the pictures show.  Upon our arrival she greeted us and had stocked the home with cheese, crackers, wine and other items to make us feel welcomed.  I especially loved the candle that was burning when we arrived. Such a lovely fragrance.  Kathy was always available by text for any thing we needed.  My son graduated from the University of Washington while we were staying there and Kathy thoughtfully brought him a card, balloon and lei to celebrate.  What a thoughtful person she is. The comments from other guests are ones I share and are accurate.  This is a wonderful place to stay as you explore all Seattle and the Northwest have to offer."
4016079,36755792,2015-07-01,21522089,Erin,"The apartment is amazing, beautifully furnished and offered plenty of room for us and our two kids. The backyard and hot tub are amazing and offer a lot of additional space.  Kathy was so welcoming and really has thought of everything, she is an amazing host and we felt at home immediately. "
4016079,46160330,2015-09-08,35606111,Erin,"Kathy was a fabulous host! We are a family of 5 with a range of children's ages and we all had a fabulous experience.  It started prior to our arrival when she emailed to check on preferred bed arrangements and dietary restrictions/allergies. She left a range of snacks/meal items that showed she had really thought about our family (just a small example: Annie's bunnies & organic Cheerios for the toddler, cookies & chips for the older kids and cheese, salami & wine for us).  The space was great, well laid-out and had everything we needed to really feel like home. The yard was great for the children and she turned on the hot tub whenever she thought we may want to use it. Although I worried that my children were being loud, Kathy did not seem to mind and may have even appreciated their energy.
Overall it was definitely 5/5."
4016079,49218604,2015-10-02,23443406,Bella,"Kathy was an amazing host. She was so kind and understanding and catered to all of our needs; she helped us get to know the city well and adapt. The house is beautiful! My family was perfectly comfortable in the house for our 2-week stay. It's so cozy, it felt like home. The house was exactly as its shown in the pictures. Kathy stocked up the place for us and we felt like we had everything there. She's such a thoughtful person. I'll miss Kathy and her home."
4016079,51533722,2015-10-21,11191701,Jessica,"Kathy was the consummate host. She's absolutely thought of everything, and makes you feel very welcome in the downstairs apartment in her immaculate, beautiful home. There are little touches throughout the apartment (e.g. a bowl of delicious chocolates, notes to guide you through operating the TV, doggie bags by the outside door) that meant so much to us. After a week in the apartment, I did not want to leave. It felt almost like home. The location was perfect for us, as we were working at the University of Washington. It was a very quick drive up to the amazing Magnuson Park, and close to some great grocery stores. When we went into the heart of the city, it only took about 15 - 20 minutes. The neighborhood is really nice and quiet with beautiful homes. This was the best airbnb experience I've had. The pictures don't do the place justice. The gas fireplace...comfy couch...and amazing dual showerhead... I can't wait to go back. Thank you Kathy!!"
4016079,54501668,2015-11-21,34468582,Jessica,"I could not have asked for a better place to stay! Kathy was a great host from picking me up at the airport, to showing me around the area and taking me to the grocery store, to making sure everything in the apartment was just right!  The apartment is finished and decorated beautifully and located in a great neighborhood in Seattle.  It's just a few blocks from lake Washington and I had great views on my morning walk into children's hospital.  Kathy provides everything you may need during your stay.  She even bought breakfast food for me that was stocked in the apartment on my arrival.  She made sure I knew how to work everything in the apartment and was always available to answer questions.  Overall Kathy is a very kind and thoughtful host and I had a great experience staying at her place.  If I travel back to Seattle I would definitely stay here again."
4016079,55230849,2015-11-29,47073773,Jan,"This was my first Airbnb experience and my host, Kathy, set the bar very high. The apartment is spacious, bright, all new (including a radiant floor in the bathroom) and top line appliances in the kitchen. We were there for Thanksgiving so we were cooking. Oh what fun when you have a well-stocked and efficient work space. Things we forgot to bring she readily let us borrow and things we didn't even think to ask she anticipated (like a leaf for the table) and sent a text telling us where to find it. We also brought our labradoodle. With a fenced yard and access right out the living room, it's very dog friendly- complete with dog treats, bowls and a blanket. If you are not familiar with Seattle, Laurelhurst is an awesome neighborhood on lake Washington very close to U WA. Last but certainly not least, upon our arrival we were greeted with snacks, libations and of course a wide variety of breakfast items that lasted us the week. It was a truly memorable Thanksgiving. I can't wait to visit again soon."
4016079,57464304,2015-12-26,33163852,Jocelyn,"Kathy was the consummate hostess who made us feel more like cherished guests than renters.  She greeted us with the fireplace going, great music playing and a lovely candle burning.  The house is immaculate with every detail accounted for.  She even left wine, snacks and breakfast for us!  The neighborhood is gorgeous and central to everywhere we needed to go. The fenced in backyard was a huge plus for us traveling with a small dog.  We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip back to Seattle. "
3022564,14102049,2014-06-11,2497238,Cody,"My wife and I stayed at Marcus & Lara's for 3 nights and had a fantastic stay at their studio. Marcus was super easy to communicate with and quick to respond. The studio is exactly how the pictures look and is perfect for a travelling couple. The place was super clean and has a very comfortable bed. Parking is right beside the unit. We found the location to be excellent with many restaurants, pubs and coffee shops a block and a half away. It is only about a 10 minute drive into the city or there is a train station only 4 blocks away which takes you right into downtown Seattle. Also a 2 minute drive takes you down to beautiful parks along Lake Washington. We are looking forward to our next stay at their studio the next time we are in Seattle. Thanks again Marcus and Lara!"
3022564,14175636,2014-06-13,6562261,Curtis,"My wife and I were in Seattle the past couple of days and looking for place between the airport and downtown. We found this place and booked right away. Everything was BRAND NEW, clean and we couldn't have asked for a better location. It was a 20 minute light rail north to Sea-Tac and a 30 minute ride downtown. 

There are great restaurants, bars and shopping all around Columbia City and we ended up spending more time in the neighborhood than downtown in Seattle. 

IF I COULD LEAVE 6 STARS I WOULD!"
3022564,14457468,2014-06-19,16831095,Juliane,"My boyfriend and I happened upon this delightful little place at the very last minute... what a find! The room was spotless, the pillows comfortable, the hosts warm and welcoming. Columbia City offered a bevy of lively bars, restaurants, shops, and very friendly locals, all within three blocks; the train to downtown was just a five-minute walk away. We will definitely be back to stay with Marcus and Lara on our next trip to Seattle.  Thanks again for having us!"
3022564,14574947,2014-06-22,15807422,Cynthia,"After staying at the studio, my boyfriend and I didn't want to leave! Not only was it squeaky clean but it was also in such a convenient location. There are great bars and restaurants practically right down the street and the light rail, which took us all over city, was a five-minute walk. Marcus and Lara made our stay in Seattle so comfortable. Thank you, we'll definitely be returning! "
3022564,14710270,2014-06-24,505871,Brandon,The studio is the perfect size. We stayed for two nights and absolutely loved it. Great spot. We would stay again.
3022564,14841663,2014-06-27,3793350,Lizbeth,"Marcus & Lara are great hosts, responded quickly to our inquiries, communication went great before and during our stay.  
The place was impeccable, really well located, 2 blocks away from all the fun that Columbia city has to offer.  I'm glad we found this place for our stay. 
Thanks,
Lizbeth "
3022564,14934113,2014-06-29,16929668,Emily,"Marcus was able to accommodate all of our needs with our stay in columbia city. The house is nicely placed behind the duplex, not attached, everything is private. Just a 15 min drive to downtown. Great place to stay while visiting Seattle."
3022564,15058754,2014-07-01,8834411,Leslie,"Very nice, new place! My parents stayed here on a recent visit. Hosts have thought about little details to make guests comfortable. Wonderful location, near the heart of Columbia City. "
3022564,15336949,2014-07-07,16499032,Clifton,"This was a wonderful place to stay.  Quaint and comfortable.  Marcus (our host) was very accommodating with our requests.  My wife and I happened to visit during the first week of July and the weather was unusually warm for that area.  Since there is no air conditioning, Marcus offered us, and then brought over, a box fan for us to use.  Everything in the apartment was very clean and serviceable.

Be advised that the windows at the top of the front wall catch the morning sun.  I was awoken promptly at 6:30 each morning from the sunshine.  If you want to sleep later you may want to bring a sleeping mask."
3022564,15511752,2014-07-10,2440534,Kelly,"We had a great stay at Marcus & Lara's studio. Even though there were difficulties meeting up at the same time for check-in Marcus was able to talk is through everything. The place was very welcoming and clean, and we appreciated the snacks and beverages available. There were even little chocolates by the bed! A soft place to land after a busy day adventuring.  I do suggest packing a sleeping mask to block out light. All around good experience!"
3022564,15831023,2014-07-16,16789173,Rob,Great place in a really nice neighborhood. We really enjoyed running around the lake and visiting your restaurants. We like your studio. Very clean and great location. Thank you. 
3022564,15926028,2014-07-18,17424291,Cecelia,Marcus was great -- quick responses and always helpful.  He even brought over extra coffee when we needed it.  The studio itself was perfect -- everything designed with comfort and convenience in mind.  We also loved that we were a block away from a really interesting neighborhood with great restaurants and shops and an amazing farmer's market on Wednesday afternoon/evening.  The parking provided in back came in very handy.  This was our first Airbnb and I'm just hoping it doesn't spoil us for future ones.
3022564,16093763,2014-07-22,16247816,Matthew,"Great place that perfectly met our needs.  Marcus was a helpful host who made sure that we knew our way around.  He was easy to get in touch with and quick to answer any question.  The space is very private, clean, well-furnished, and perfect for one or two people who are looking for a space to sleep or have the occasional light meal.  The location is also quite good.  The light rail is a short walk and we really enjoyed the Columbia City neighborhood. "
3022564,16351740,2014-07-26,5285005,Julie,"Marcus met us at the studio when we arrived, showed us the space, and gave us suggestions for food, coffee, and getting around Seattle. The studio was plenty of space for my husband and I, especially since we were spending most of our time out and about in Seattle anyway. It was clean, cute, and cozy. Plus, it's only a short walk to the light rail which took us straight into downtown. We didn't really interact with Marcus or Lara while we stayed, which was fine since we were doing our own thing anyway; and it made it feel like the studio was ""our place."" Overall, we really enjoyed our stay!"
3022564,16558659,2014-07-29,16727418,Justin,"Had a great stay in Seattle, place was clean and well stocked. Area was nice and trendy, easy transit into downtown Seattle as well."
3022564,16719960,2014-08-01,15834679,Harriet,"My boyfriend and I really enjoyed our stay. Contacting Marcus was simple and easy. The studio was nice and private, clean, and well-furnished. The location was great, close to downtown. Friendly and quiet neighbourhood. The light rail was conveniently close by, which made it easier to get to Safeco Field. We we're sad to leave as it was a nice getaway from home. We'll definitely come back soon!"
3022564,16908873,2014-08-04,17267060,Mayah,"The studio was perfect for our stay in Seattle! Affordable, adorable, clean and comfortable! It was nice to have a private space in a quiet area. We never met Marcus due to timing issues, but helped us find the place and we got settled in with no problems. We would definitely stay again! "
3022564,17210871,2014-08-09,287080,Anna,"This studio was the perfect place for our stay in Seattle! The location is fantastic, and the studio is clean, very comfortable, private, and quiet. Lara and Marcus were very communicative and helpful. I can't wait to come back!"

3022564,17630515,2014-08-15,17980258,Lynda,"My sister and I enjoyed this quiet and cozy location. It was clean and had enough space for two people. It was in a really cute and safe neighborhood and walking distance to coffee shops, bakeries, and the light rail. We would definitely stay here again when visiting Seattle. Our host, Marcus was very nice and welcoming. The room had some tourist info brochures and a booklet of restaurant & public transportation information.  I enjoyed my first experience in Seattle!"
3022564,18059431,2014-08-21,16991710,Fabian,Nice and lovely place of a friendly and cool host Marcus. We would definitely come back again! Rebecca + Fabian  
3022564,18527970,2014-08-28,16329772,Anne,"The studio was charming!  Very clean and comfortable.  Great location within walking distance to restaurants, shops, and the Light Rail  in historic Columbia City.  The hosts provide snacks and coffee.  There is plenty of literature on things to do in Seattle.  It is a great place to stay!"
3022564,18654324,2014-08-30,16964318,Alyssa,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in the studio over PAX weekend- it was adorable, comfortable, and convenient! Marcus and Lara are very accommodating and quick to respond- I will definitely remember this place when I think of a location to stay in Seattle. Thank you!"
3022564,18959029,2014-09-03,16397771,Lori,"We had a great night at your cute little place in the city. Worked out perfect for our stay in Seattle, never got to the Chihuly exhibit as the weather decided to change just as we were about to go, so I am sure we will be back. Thanks so much."
3022564,19123179,2014-09-07,4205722,Sonia,Marcus was very friendly and helpful. He answered our questions and was available if we needed anything!
3022564,19593298,2014-09-15,16547566,Kathleen,wonderful  place- wonderful neighborhood-
3022564,19774272,2014-09-18,12776996,Pamela,I called Marcus when I knew our ETA and he arrived the same time as we did.  He showed us how everything worked in the studio and it matched the description exactly.  He spent a great deal of time answering our questions and making suggestions re restaurants etc. and the neighbourhood.
3022564,19887300,2014-09-20,20406757,Melissa,Perfect place in a great location! Very clean and great host. Marcus gave us great information on good food and entertainment. Great first experience using Airbnb and I would recommend this studio highly!
3022564,20006085,2014-09-22,16959489,Peter,"We stayed with Marcus & Lara for 2 nights and it was perfect! Location near the lightrail (4 blocks) and already some nice restaurants close by!

The studio has everything you need, including a lot of info and brochures to check out the city!

We definitely loved it.  Thanks again!"
3022564,20335658,2014-09-28,275429,Mark,Great little place in the perfect little neighborhood of Columbia City. So easy to get around from here and yet comfortably outside the bustle. 
3022564,20508859,2014-09-30,18226787,Brandy,"Great bungalow located just outside the city but with easy access to the lightrail that runs between downtown and the airport. There are a few shops and cafes within a short walk of the bungalow.  Marcus was great host,  quick reply to email and texts and able to accommodate our late arrival.  The space is beautiful and modern."
3022564,20816796,2014-10-06,12618612,Kelsey,The studio was just as described and we had a great stay. Marcus was very accommodating and the check in/check out process could not have been simpler. The studio is about a 10 min walk to the light rail and from the light rail about 20 minutes to downtown. We enjoyed the unique restaurants right down the street from the studio. 
3022564,20996148,2014-10-09,7432732,Chris,"Marcus checked in with us when we arrived to make sure we had everything we needed.  The space was exactly as described- clean and tidy, with nice decor and thoughtful extras like mints on the pillow and a nice selection of single brew coffee.  Really appreciated the handy off street parking, easy access to the light rail and the nice dining options just blocks away on the main drag of Columbia City.  Highly recommended!"
3022564,21578644,2014-10-20,591564,Faith,"My husband and I had a lovely stay. The studio had everything we needed for our 5-day stay. Clean and well organized and great communication w/ our host, Marcus. It was in a terrific location with walking distance to restaurants & coffee shops...and an ice cream parlor/arcade! Perfect if you have a car, w/ a parking spot. Close to public transportation if you don't. Intimate, modern, and quiet. The only thing missing is a kitchen, but who needs that when you have a mini-fridge, microwave, & a street full of eateries?! Great stay & we'd do it again. Thanks for a lovely stay in Seattle!"
3022564,21711174,2014-10-22,19540433,David,"This was a fairly unique situation as I'm actually a local to Seattle and was staying here for a couple of days while some relatives occupied my own apartment. It was a very pleasant stay. Marcus was very hospitable, and ensured that he was available to meet me when I check-in. The studio itself is very new, nicely constructed, and comfortable. The on-site parking space was also a nice bonus. Overall,  very happy with my stay, and my first Airbnb experience!"
3022564,21942347,2014-10-27,12320775,Alyse,"This backyard bungalow was the absolute perfect home for our stay in Seattle. Marcus did a fantastic job of stocking the studio with everything we could possibly need during our stay. Check-in was a breeze and there was everything from a mini kitchen to mints on our bed and even a hair dryer! Having our own parking spot was an amazing perk and right outside our front door. It was only a 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle which was so convenient. It was so nice to wind down in a quiet neighborhood after a long day of site seeing and enjoying city life. In short, we felt so comfortable staying here and we will definitely book again if/when we return to Seattle! "
3022564,22700006,2014-11-12,6091561,Matthew,"This was a great stay, super clean and comfortable! Marcus was very easy to work with and check-in was simple. "
3022564,22840617,2014-11-16,661531,Aude,"Great place to stay in Seattle and explore this nice city. Marcus is very friendly, downtown is really easy to reach, the place is clean, quiet and very comfy but close to many shops, movie theatre, bakery and coffee! Thanks!"
3022564,23432576,2014-12-01,2872198,Michelle,"Marcus' studio was a very comfortable and convenient place to stay, especially if you're looking for a hotel alternative. Easy arrival and departure, excellent location with great coffee and food in walking distance, and a superb host. Thank you Marcus! We hope to be back soon!"
3022564,23622051,2014-12-07,5965741,James,Great little cabin all that you need for a few nights away! Fantastic location close to restaurants and shops and only a light rail tram ride away from the city of Seattle itself.
3022564,24022300,2014-12-17,3976112,Austin,Five stars! My wife and I spent two nights in this studio and it was better than staying at a hotel. The host thought of every detail from coffee to wifi to shampoo in the shower to even a pick up from the light rail station. The location is PERFECT just two blocks from the mains trip with some of Seattle's top rated restaurants and bars. We'll always stay here when we visit Seattle. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
3022564,24096281,2014-12-19,24865283,Nadia,"This was my first Airbnb experience and my friend as well who arrived from Yemen the day we checked in, and I'm HAPPY we spent it here! Marcus checked us in, great and helpful person. 
Backyard bungalow is a 5-star hotel experience. Marcus & Lara thought of everything, there's even a hair dryer!
The studio has everything you can think of, and the location is near everything! I highly recommend this studio, perfect in every way.
Thank you Marcus & Lara =)"
3022564,24137830,2014-12-21,19957355,Pat,"Decided to stay in a different part of Seattle this past weekend, and came across this awesome little place for only $80/night.  Tucked in off the street, it's only a short walk to a great coffee place and lots of interesting restaurants and bars in the down town area on Ranier.  Comfy bed, nice amenities...would highly recommend this place to anyone."
3022564,24357881,2014-12-27,21371595,Austin And Jamie Sue,My boyfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed staying at Marcus and Lara’s studio.  The studio was clean and modern and every detail was provided in a very organized manner.  It was also very private and quiet.  Our favorite aspect of the stay was the neighborhood.  The studio is located in a cute quaint neighborhood and is just up the hill from several little places to grab good coffee and a bite to eat.  There was even a mini theatre if the mood strikes to see a movie.  The neighborhood was also just a short drive to anywhere we visited in Seattle.  Would definitely recommend staying here!    
3022564,24733232,2015-01-02,2197589,Lindsey,Great location and we found the studio was just as described. Wonderfully clean and perfect for our two day stay in Seattle. Marcus was very responsive and helpful. Thanks for a great stay. 
3022564,24986492,2015-01-04,20077468,Cal," Great place with everything you need, was a perfect stay.
 Also love Empire Cafe just down the road."
3022564,25179344,2015-01-08,2209522,Kylie-Ayn,"Marcus was extremely welcoming and helpful in recommending some really interesting local spots. Very easy to get to light rail, so a short trip to downtown Seattle. Decorated beautifully and very comfortable bed!"
3022564,25437006,2015-01-16,24131500,Lewis,"The neighborhood was, as ever, delightful and accomodating with excellent restaurants, a bakery, coffee house and easy access to the light rail to downtown Seattle and the SEATAC.

The studio was very clean, well lighted and private."
3022564,25537854,2015-01-19,22408740,Edward,"This was our first visit to Seattle and we had an amazing experience! Great neighborhood consisting of various coffee shops, bars, restaurants, etc. Only a 15 minute drive from downtown. Great accommodations, we can't wait to come back!  "
3022564,25778270,2015-01-25,24080787,Xin,"It is a nice, clean place. "
3022564,26000517,2015-02-01,19201984,Emmy,Great little studio! Marcus greeted us and gave us a brief rundown of a few things.  Studio was quite comfortable and perfect for our stay.  We were in the neighborhood for an event and found the location to be perfect.  We were able to walk to coffee and dinner and enjoyed exploring the neighborhood.  
3022564,26168467,2015-02-05,26797739,Denise,"I absolutely loved staying here! The location is very convenient to downtown Seattle, yet still feels ""secluded"" with its own structure and private parking off the alley. I will be staying here again in a couple weeks and I genuinely look forward to it!"
3022564,26735588,2015-02-18,22551529,Cynthia,"The rental suite and the location were fantastic. There is a reason the Columbia City neighbourhood has a walkability score of 98%. There are a ton of great restaurants just 2 blocks away on Rainier Ave. Don't miss the Columbia City Bakery, Medusa or the Flying Lion microbrewery just a few blocks to the south. And it's only a 20 minute commute to downtown via the Link Light Rail (so easy to get to). There's even an organic grocery store coming in 3 blocks away in the summer of 2015. And there are a few arts hotspots nearby like The Royal Room and Columbia City Theatre.

The space itself is clean and well appointed. The bed is comfortable. The wifi worked perfectly. The suite even has its own hot water tank so you don't have to worry about competing for hot water. An in suite fridge, microwave, coffee maker and dishes were a great touch. The icing on the cake is the brochure rack of Seattle attractions!

Marcus and Lara are so friendly, helpful and approachable. They met me at the appointed time and then left me undisturbed (unless I needed something) for the 10 days I stayed. It really does feel like a home away from home.

Note, the house beside it is home to renters, so don't ring the doorbell and expect Marcus or Lara to answer. Make arrangements to meet with them ahead of time."
3022564,26874791,2015-02-21,6706221,Chris,This little bungalow was a very enjoyable place to stay during my trip to Seattle. Marcus was a phenomenal host who was very accommodating and helpful at all hours of the day. This was one of my first Airbnb experiences and I could not have been happier. I absolutely recommend this spot to anyone visiting this city! 
3022564,27642765,2015-03-09,3180198,Cat,"This was a wonderful little studio in a great location. We had no problems contacting Marcus, getting checked in, or feeling comfortable in the space. 

Marcus was also able to give us some great recommendations for local eats and drinks :)"
3022564,28136281,2015-03-18,23312482,Liz,"Great location, especially if one is taking public transportation! Hosts were very helpful, quiet neighborhood, perfect for my trip!"
3022564,28248849,2015-03-21,23719381,Michael,"Marcus and Lara were wonderful hosts and provided everything possible to make our stay comfortable. The studio was cozy and modern, and they had HBO on their TV. This is a good place to stay in if you're looking for privacy since its nice and quiet, and next to a street with local restaurants and shops. If you want to go downtown, you can take public transportation that's about a 5-10 minute walk away, and take a bus or light rail (which takes ~40 minutes). Overall, I recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a relaxing and private place to stay at."
3022564,28872049,2015-03-31,26915324,Jolynn,"I absolutely loved this little studio. The area is so cute and quiet and my boyfriend and I felt quite comfortable and at home here. We had several delays on our flight out and Marcus was so understanding and helpful despite the inconvenience. Once we got here, he happily talked us through everything and explained the area. I was a little nervous about using this app as I had never personally used it before but Marcus really made a great impression and I am so happy I chose to stay here. I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting seattle! "
3022564,29099492,2015-04-04,8189725,Mackenzie,This great studio unit was perfect for my girlfriend and I during our short stay in Seattle. Just a few blocks away from the light rail which will take you in the heart of downtown in about 15 minutes. Cute restaurants and shops right down the street in Columbia City. Would definitely recommend and stay here again!
3022564,29855586,2015-04-13,29595535,James,"Marcus met us at the studio, and he was extremely helpful. The studio was better than he and Lara described in the listing and pictures don't it justice. This was our first airbnb experience and it set a high bar for our lodging expectations."
3022564,30285435,2015-04-20,13406657,Ashkan,"Marcus was a great host. He went above and beyond to pick up flowers and champagne for my wife and coordinate a nice surprise for her upon our arrival. He also provided great neighborhood recommendations and places to check out while in Seattle. The place was very nicely remodeled, had everything we needed and more. Very comfortable and much better than a hotel. We got a lovely sense of community staying in Columbia City. Would definitely recommend this studio to anyone visiting Seattle. In walking distance to the light rail or a quick Uber from any part of the city. "
3022564,30654773,2015-04-25,19537611,Christine,Marcus and Lara were such wonderful hosts.  I had contacted them (very) last minute and they welcomed me warmly.  I can't thank them for their hospitality.  The studio is perfect - very thoughtfully planned and in a GREAT location.  Will recommend to friends and family!
3022564,30869902,2015-04-28,24773265,April,"I loved this studio! It was perfect for my first trip to Seattle. Marcus was such a wonderful host, he was very responsive, helpful and very accommodating. This was my first AirBnB experience and it definitely set the bar high for my future lodging expectations. I would definitely recommend this studio, it was very convenient to get to and from downtown being that it was so close to the light rail! I am looking forward to staying here again in the future! "
3022564,31033785,2015-05-01,27019201,Zach,"What a wonderful little place in a great neighborhood!  So many cool little restaurants and bars within walking distance.  Marcus was always just a text or phone call away to answer any questions.  Place was better in person!  Super clean, modern, and very quiet.  Definitely will stay again the next time back in Seattle!"
3022564,31170428,2015-05-03,27320635,James,Very comfortable.  Great place to explore Seattle from.  Great neighborhood to explore.  Great hosts.  We will definitely be back!  
3022564,31708863,2015-05-09,29828298,Katrina,"Great little studio!  The neighbourhood was very quiet and private.  The studio was clean and well maintained.  Marcus was a nice host and when his assistance was needed he was quick to respond.   I would happily stay in the Studio again.
"
3022564,31870904,2015-05-11,25666598,Ben,"What a great stay in Seattle and the studio was perfect for our needs.  It was immaculately kept and exactly like the photos.  Although we only saw them the once Marcus and Lara felt like close friends to deal with, wonderful hosts and a wonderful studio.  Neighborhood is great with some excellent restaurants and bars.  Thank you ! "
3022564,32498332,2015-05-19,26129776,Amanda,"Marcus was a great host! We got in early and he was able to work with our schedule and meet us as soon as possible. We were welcomed with fresh linens, clean towels, a fully stocked keurig and dishes that came in handy. He had a book with things to do, places to eat, pamphlets to look at and made it really easy to decide what to do! The parking was great right in front of the studio. I would highly recommend staying here if you are ever in Seattle! "
3022564,32813947,2015-05-22,26702672,Alex,This was a great first time using AirBNB. Marcus was very nice and provided great recommendations for places to eat. The bungalow was very nice and clean. We were very pleased. 
3022564,33059432,2015-05-25,1312599,Kathy,"This studio was better than described...super clean, comfortable and convenient. The perfect place for us, staying a weekend in Seattle. Access to the lite rail was great, rode to the city center both days, and then took it to the airport very early, with no problem.  Great variety of restaurants in the neighborhood, all within walking distance. We never got to meet our hosts, as we came in early, but got all the info we needed via texts. Marcus checked that we had arrived safely, and to see if we needed anything additional.  Coffee, water and snacks were provided, as well as a ton of travel/tourist info. A great help in deciding what to see and do.  This is a very cool place to stay in Seattle. Would highly recommend."
3022564,33892137,2015-06-02,2162117,Sabine,"The studio was very nice. It was well equipped, clean and cosy.
The neighborhood is nice and quiet and we felt very comfortable.
Checking in was kind of difficult, since Marcus made it quite complicated for us (to text, to get the key-code, to find the driveway to the backyard - or to meet). He wasn't unfriendly, he just gave us very little information - and only little by little.
In the end we didn't meet him at all, but it was alright and we enjoyed being there anyways."
3022564,34187472,2015-06-06,22525271,Matt & Shannon,"The studio was clean, bright, and comfortable. It was the perfect space for the two of us as we came up to Seattle on a long road trip from Austin. We met Marcus upon arriving and he was incredibly nice and helpful, giving us the run down on the space and some tips/recommendations for nearby coffee shops and public transportation for getting around downtown. Information about Seattle along with things to do were also provided in the studio along with detailed instructions on how to do everything, like closing the windows and turning on the TV. They really thought of everything - our stay couldn't have gone more smoothly. The parking space in back made it easy for us to pull in and unload our stuff, and the neighborhood felt very safe and friendly. Overall, the space really made our Seattle trip perfect. We only wish we could have stayed longer, but we know that we'll be back very soon! I would recommend this space to anyone traveling to Seattle. "
3022564,34629859,2015-06-10,26169667,Sarah,We absolutely loved the Columbia City neighborhood and the studio was so close to both the bus (just a block and a half!) and the light rail (a few more blocks!). Definitely recommended for travelers on a budget who still want to see all the sights!
3022564,34932686,2015-06-14,26947054,Jenny,"Marcus was very welcoming from day 1 meeting us at the studio earlier than planned and showed us the space and offered some good insights on some things we wanted to check out while in town. The studio was what we anticipated, clean and cozy. The studio was also located in a great location, easy to get downtown and a great area around the studio in Columbia City to walk to get food and drinks. It was a great first experience with Airbnb and both the stay and hosts! I would recommend staying with Marcus and Laura to anyone checking out Seattle."
3022564,35230437,2015-06-16,33248175,Veronica,"Marcus and Lara were wonderful hosts. They met us upon arrival and gave suggestions on places to go that evening.  One thing they suggested was an event called Beatwalk which was occurring the night we arrived. As we hopped to each restaurant there were local live bands and artists playing.  The locals were out having a good time and it gave us an opportunity to truly experience being part of the community there.  The studio was quiet, secure, and fit our needs.  It was very clean and I enjoyed the decor (especially the keypad entry so I didn't have to worry about losing any keys!).  The studio was just a block away from downtown Columbia City, good restaurants, and Empire coffee were we enjoyed a fabulous latte.  Since we wanted to go into the city there was a short walk to the light rail which took us everywhere we wanted to visit. Overall I would recommend to those who are looking for a home base to move about the city."
3022564,35411776,2015-06-18,34876761,Lyubomir,Great studio in a Great Neighborhood. Marcus is a great host and his studio is the best place to stay in Seattle hands down.

3022564,35762539,2015-06-22,21303460,Farzin,What a fantastic experience. We felt at home in this wonderfully decorated studio. Everything you need is within walking distance and the Hosts only a text away. Great restaurants and bars. We would certainly visit again. Thank you.
3022564,36089327,2015-06-25,30506302,Ben,"We loved the experience at Marcus and Lara's Studio.  Columbia City is a nice neighbor hood and there are great Coffee shops and Restaurants just a few blocks away.  The light Rail is also just a short 4 block walk.

Marcus was very helpful and accommodating, even when we were late arriving to the Studio after issues at the airport.  He walked us through, gave us suggestions on where to go, what to eat, etc.  He was very friendly.

The studio had a nice, comfortable bed, a TV, wifi, bathroom and shower and Keurig for coffee!  

My girlfriend and I would definitely stay again."

Everything that could have been thought of was (website hidden) Listing, local attractions, Frequently Asked Questions, recommendations. They did it all. This Suite felt like it was in a high end hotel Really Really Happy with the stay. "
3022564,39728963,2015-07-26,27756562,Meghan,What a great little hideaway for our trip to Seattle! Marcus and Lara were gracious enough to accommodate us during our stay and their hospitality was top notch. We had a few special requests for things and they were able to provide them for us on short notice. The area is a perfect for lunch and dinner spots and close to the downtown area. Thank you for such a wonderful stay! 
3022564,40312048,2015-07-30,26119453,Oliver,"Marcus was great! He accommodated our late arrival time and then gave us all kinds of suggesting on where to eat and visit during our time in Seattle. He was always really responsive if we had a question. The studio is exactly as it appears on the listing: clean, modern, and comfortable. It is about a ten minute walk to the light rail, and a five minute walk to the bus stop. Columbia city is small but there are some cool places. Mainly the location is good because you can get to downtown easily. We would definitely stay here again!"
3022564,40557875,2015-08-01,20236846,Charley,Marcus was an awesome host.  He gave us awesome suggestions and made us feel right at home. The place was clean and beautiful. The neighborhood is perfect for travelers.   Highly recommend!

3022564,41918572,2015-08-10,6337003,Jorge,"We absolutely loved our stay here! Marcus was very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. The airbnb really is set up like a hotel room but with the charm of being in a cute neighborhood. The space is exactly as shown in the photos, with the added bonus of tourist attraction pamphlets just like you would find in a hotel. We loved walking the neighborhood in the morning to get coffee, pastries, and even a haircut. 
Even though there is plenty of street parking, you do get a dedicated off street parking spot in the alley behind the house to make coming home worry free.  
We would definitely return here again!"
3022564,42507034,2015-08-14,1891098,Angela,Adorable place with everything you could need. Very close to the light rail and even closer to buses. Marcus was a great communicator and an awesome host. Highly recommended.

3022564,47032654,2015-09-15,3341545,Rachel,"Best trip ever!  Marcus was very accommodating and very resourceful. He took the time to answer all of our questions and gave us great recommendations from sites, places to eat, and everything in between.  From a fabulous brunch spot to the local sports watering hole, everything around us had a homely feel, which made us feel right at home.  Our experience with Marcus as well as our time in Seattle made it extremely difficult for us to leave.  When the time comes for our return to this wonderful city, you know who we will be checking in with! "
3022564,47330882,2015-09-17,38598762,Lee,Great experience for my first Airbnb. Really enjoyed the accommodation and the neighborhood. Contact with the hosts was very fast and Marcus attended to the requests I had. Will be booking again next time I am in Seattle.

The studio is located on a very quiet street, yet only one block from trendy Columbia City. There were lots of cafes and restaurants and an incredible supermarket, all 5 minutes walk from the studio. There is also a light rail which was about 3 blocks away. We used it every day to get into the city. The ride took about 15minutes.Very user friendly. 
I would thoroughly recommend this studio for your stay in Seattle. 

"
3022564,49440150,2015-10-04,21209932,Wendy,"This was such a lovely sweet studio! Marcus was super nice, provided as much information as possible, he even helped me find a laundry.

"
3022564,50072426,2015-10-09,11189839,Nami,The studio was wonderful! Perfect location and very neat upon arrival. Marcus and Lara checked in on us a few times to make sure we got into the studio okay. They were 100% on communication and hospitality! 
3022564,50455522,2015-10-12,41465489,Jonathan,"My wife and I had an AMAZING time. We found that the location was perfect walking distance to the train and a 20ish min ride to down town Seattle. The accomidations where clean and well kept, felt right at home. We would def stay again.

Oh and our host were great very accommodating and great line of communication. "
3022564,50864841,2015-10-15,42165798,Jessie,Great studio in a great location. The studio was very well equipped. Marcus and Lara were wonderful and provided a lot of great tips for traveling exploring the city.
3022564,51021173,2015-10-17,41585028,Janice,"This place was exactly as described and as pictured. Marcus was very prompt in communication and Lara met us to give us a welcome tour and explain the door. They had snacks and all sorts of info about Seattle in general and the Columbia City area as well. The train was a bit of a walk but extremely easy to navigate (similar to DART if you've ever ridden Dallas's light rail). It got us down and back. There was also an off-street parking space if we had rented a car. It's a nice quiet neighborhood, very safe seeming. Just a couple blocks away is Rainier street with all sorts of restaurants and a small movie theater. Very lovely place and would definitely stay again if we are in the area!"
3022564,51434505,2015-10-20,29216361,Matt,"Marcus and Lara were great hosts, the home was perfect for our needs and the area was very quaint and quiet.

3022564,51963389,2015-10-25,26432981,Sarah,Wow. What a great place to stay. Quiet and comfortable. Slept so well. The design is lovely and has a calming quality. We really enjoyed the neighborhood shops and restaurants that are super close. Marcus and Lara very welcoming and accommodating. Descriptions of their place are very accurate. Will definitely return. 
3022564,52405520,2015-10-29,1756663,Sarah,"Wonderful area.  So easy to get downtown using the train.  Also easy to reach from Airport and Amtrak so you don't need a car.  Columbia City was very nice.  Geraldine's for breakfast, Columbia City Ale House for lunch and La Medusa for dinner.  We had a beer from Spinnaker which is close but was not open the days we were there.  I would check it out.  Oh and Salted Sea for oyster Happy Hour!  Great location.  Easy walking even though a bit hilly if you aren't used to hills.  Check out CrossFit RE on Rainer (walking distance) to work off good eating.  "
3022564,52618016,2015-10-31,1506188,Kathryn,"We had a great stay in Columbia City, Seattle. The studio was clean, had everything we needed, and was in a great location - great bakeries, coffee shops, and a great food co-op nearby! Marcus was very responsive and check-in and out was a breeze. Thanks for everything! "
3022564,53055853,2015-11-04,7443448,David,I met Marcus as planned. The studio was just as described. The neighborhood was safe and had plenty of places to eat and drink. I went to the movie theatre right around the corner and saw a great first run movie. The light rail was an easy walk and a good alternative to driving into Seatle's waterfront district. Marcus was a patient and knowledgable host. 
3022564,53287055,2015-11-07,16143433,Shanah,"Great place. Great location. Great host, Marcus was full of information and suggestions. Everything was as mentioned in the posting, I hope to return in the future."
3022564,53704549,2015-11-11,17203227,Jeff,"This was our first time in Seattle and definitely not our last! Marcus and Lara's place is a gem and a great find. Location is amazing! It was walking distance to many restaurants, bars, and coffee shops to name a few. Their place was very cozy and filled with endless guides to tour Seattle. Marcus was a great host. He was easy to communicate with and was very helpful in giving us suggestions on places to go and eat. Would definitely come back and rent their place when we return to Seattle. Thanks again! "
3022564,54496624,2015-11-21,7580312,Annie,"We had a great time at the studio. It was super cute, clean, and in a really lovely neighborhood. It was especially convenient for taking public transportation (which is far preferable to driving in Seattle, in our opinion.) Marcus was quick to respond to any questions we had and was a very gracious host. We would definitely stay here again!"
3022564,55194597,2015-11-29,871940,Theresa,"We had a wonderful stay at this lovely Columbia City flat. It was the perfect little micro studio to call our home base on our adventures in the Seattle area. It was very clean, modern, and cozy. Marcus & Lara were also fabulous hosts. They were very communicative and friendly and their instructions were spot on. I highly recommend this AirBnB listing and I would book it again in a heartbeat. 3"

3022564,56669636,2015-12-16,48130868,Arthur,"The stay was wonderful! There were a lot of great places around which our host introduced to us. They also provided further information about Seattle and all of its greatness through books and binders. 
The place was incredibly comfortable and everything worked great. "

3022564,57625364,2015-12-28,8074482,Nick,"The owners did a great job renovating this former detached garage into a self-enclosed studio suite that is on par or better than a standard hotel room. The suite was well-stocked with amenities, including snacks, bottled water, a mini-fridge and a Keurig coffee maker. Check-in was simple thanks to a keypad entry - we didn't even need to coordinate a meeting with the host. The location of the studio is fantastic for visiting Seattle. The immediate Columbia City neighborhood is bustling with a wide variety of restaurants and a great market, and the studio's proximity to the LINK (Seattle's light rail system) makes it super easy to head north into the downtown core or south to Sea-Tac airport (if you flew into town), with trains every 10 mins. We'd definitely stay here again in the future."
1732280,15531496,2014-07-11,5803066,Todd,The condo was very clean and ready for us.  Easy process to get keys and check-in and check-out.  Overall great place and great location.

1732280,28809491,2015-03-30,28594583,Abhishek,The apartment was wonderful and very spacious. The three of us had a  great time there staying over the weekend. It was true to its description and was in the heart of downtown close to all major tourist attractions. Would definitely recommend this place to all.
1732280,35108460,2015-06-15,719203,Erin,"Everything about the rental was great! Management contacted us before to make sure we had all of the check in information. Check in was smooth and easy. The apartment was quite spacious and well-equipped, it had wonderful views of Seattle.  It was walking distance to pike place market and central to so many other wonderful things. We didn't have any problems and we really did love the unit."
5784320,30473861,2015-04-22,25132049,John,The condo was a nice place in a great city!  Jordan did a wonderful job communicating with me and he and his company have done a great job communicating with the folks at the condo who were expecting us.  If I should travel to Seattle again I would most definitely stay here or in another of Jordan's homes.
5784320,31528252,2015-05-06,30246333,Gregory,"Our stay in Seattle was great. The location was central to everything we wanted to do while there, including downtown shopping, Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, and Cornish College of the Arts. The perfect cental location allowed us to walk to most things and even those locations and activities that were up on Capitol Hill were easily accessible by car. The front desk folks in the building were outstanding--super friendly people who went out of their way to help us with some special needs we had as we moved our daughter home for the summer. We used all of the building's amenities, including the library, the lounge, and the really impressive gym. If you want to be downtown this is an ideal way to go."
5784320,36554241,2015-06-29,34054469,Lori,The condo was perfect for my family! We had a great time and the staff downstairs was very helpful!

5784320,39518348,2015-07-24,31619110,Susan,"The location was perfect for our needs. I worked, while my family played.   The apartment/condo was very very clean and well kept. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. The one small issue was that the internet did not work. We called the help line listed in the unit-and he tried-but could not assist. We tried every day-rebooting and other trouble shooting. Not the worse thing-but an inconvenience. "
5784320,41225111,2015-08-05,28274865,Brett,"The condo was very clean, pictures were accurate, very nice community patio that we bbq'd on one evening.  The check in and out process was easy.  We wished they had provided dish towels to hand wash dishes, because there was no dishwasher soap in the unit. It's possible that was simply an oversight this time."
5784320,50224399,2015-10-10,5447304,Paige & Shawn,Amazing apartment with the friendliest front desk staff. The apartment was huge (two bedrooms w/ 2 baths) and spotless. Booking with Jordan was easy and straightforward. Can't wait to stay in one of Jordan's properties again when we are in Seattle! 
5784320,52377615,2015-10-28,47269944,Greg,The unit was exactly as described on the listing and everything worked as expected. Perfect!
5784320,54936914,2015-11-25,49134318,Vy,"We really enjoyed our stay with Stay Alfred in Seattle.  Great location.  Check-in instructions and policies were clear and we were greeted so warmly when we checked in.  Then we go up to a beautiful, clean, and well-appointed 2 bedroom, 2 bath condo just as described.  It was perfect for our family of 5.  There was one little hiccup when we almost ran out of toilet paper (no extra rolls were provided as promised), but I called the very nice customer service rep at 9 pm and it was easily taken care of the next morning.  We had everything we needed to make our stay comfortable.  Overall, we can confidently recommend and look forward to staying here on our next trip to Seattle.  Thank you!"
6078382,34588311,2015-06-09,34795204,Kathryn,"Debby, our host, was extremely responsive and accommodating. She took our last minute reservation and made our weekend in Seattle the most memorable experience. The room was everything she said it would be and then some! We are already planning to schedule more trips and will look no further than this cozy, clean city farmhouse! Thank you Debby and family!!"
6078382,35261527,2015-06-16,7593558,Meredith,"A great experience.  The room is clean and comfy, and the house is charming.  It's true that the bedroom wall doesn't  quite reach the ceiling so sound travels easily but there is still a sense of privacy and we certainly didn't find it to be excessively noisy.  It's just a ten minute walk to the Link train which goes straight to downtown.  

Debby was friendly and helpful and made sure we were comfortable and had what we needed.  

Overall, a great value.  Highly recommended.  "
6078382,35626454,2015-06-20,8880284,Jun,"Debby was very accommodating and flexible, I had some changes in plan and arrive later than originally scheduled. She made sure I was comfortable and had everything I had. She is also generous, great conversationalist, and fun to be around. 

I am very bad with directions, and she stayed with me on the phone so that I could find the house without trouble. "
6078382,35985672,2015-06-23,24089446,Dennis,Debby was an amazing host who made us feel welcome from the start and went out of her way to make our trip to Seattle even better. She gave us tips on where to go and what to do in the city which we would not have known about otherwise. The room was great and the bed very comfy. Location is great as it is a close walk to two train stations and a quick cab ride from downtown. It was a great experience staying with Debby and definitely recommend her place to anyone staying in Seattle.
6078382,37080927,2015-07-04,35430033,Katy,"Debby is a warm and friendly host. She communicated quickly by text if I had any questions. She is quite knowledgeable about the Seattle area and suggested a lot of fun experiences based on our individual desires. The bedroom is simple and organized. Her house is cozy for hanging out in as desired. 

Walking to Columbia City or the light rail is about a 10 minute walk with various routes to take (either through neighborhoods or more of the city).

Her house is set back from the neighborhood and feels secluded. You can hear the low rumble of the train (which I thought was nice!), but sound sensitive people will want to take note. There are earplugs provided.

Great place! I have a new friendship. Thanks Debby!"
6078382,37232686,2015-07-05,7636989,Gary,"We had a nice and quiet overnight stay for our quick trip to Seattle. The location is secluded for being in the city. It is a relaxing, comfortable and peaceful environment. Debby is very nice and very helpful. We would have liked to stay longer and visit with her more than we did. Hotels in Seattle are very expensive and in noisy, busy parts of town. This was a perfect alternative that saved our money and our sanity."
6078382,37490100,2015-07-07,35331554,Kilian Tobias,"The house is in a very accessible neighborhood with a big garden and the air conditioning was nice to beat the heat. As described in the listing, the room is not totally enclosed, but this was not a problem at all. Everything was really clean and Debbie gave us great hints on where to go in Seattle. She and her son are exceptionally friendly and I would love to stay there again."
6078382,42075558,2015-08-10,7387949,Steve & Melody,"Debby was easy to communicate with and very friendly. Her place is close to Columbia City and a quick drive to chinatown or downtown. The only thing I would want to make clear to other guests is that this is not an ideal location for a light sleeper or one who wants to sleep in. The sound from the kitchen carries to the bedroom, so just be prepared for that.  The house and the host are lovely though and the price is right. "
6078382,42476470,2015-08-13,39860353,Sierra,"Debby was fantastic and I really enjoyed staying at the Farm House in the City. I highly recommend Debby's place. Debby made me feel warm and welcome, with lots of information about the area and a spirit willing to help in whatever way possible. "
6078382,43301582,2015-08-18,39194512,Kim,"Staying with Debby was a total delight. She coordinated with us prior to our arrival and gave us clear directions on how to get to her house. The space was lovely and I think she accurately captures her home in her description.

We did not have a car for our time in Seattle and it worked perfectly from Debby's house. She is halfway between two of the light rail stops so it was about ten minute walk to the stop and then a 20 minute ride to downtown. Debbie was great about giving us suggestions for things to do near what we were planning on doing that day.

We would most definitely stay with Debby again."

6078382,44351746,2015-08-25,37910193,Heather,"Her and her son were very sweet and welcoming! Her son thought we were his friend that was coming over at first and got the surprise we were not :) 

Very helpful with the area guidance and offered us plums and water rights when we got there. 

The room was across from the bathroom which made it just like home. They were very courteous with noise as the room was private but not fully enclosed. Air plugs were given if we wanted to use them just in case. 

She got us new sheets and ironed them for us too :) 

Very sweet woman and wonderful neighbor :) "
6078382,44816630,2015-08-29,40733308,Paul,"Debby was an amazing host! Her recommendations for local eateries and attractions we're excellent, and the room was exactly what we needed for our stay. Her house is a 10-15 minute walk to the LINK, which was perfect, as we came in from the airport and went downtown every day. Highly recommended!!!"
6078382,45611254,2015-09-04,34390207,D J,"Debby was a most gracious and welcoming host. She made the particulars for arrival and key access very easy. And, I was welcomed at the door on the first day, and since it was raining Debby offered me a lift to the village area of Columbia City, which I appreciated very much. The room is exactly as described on the AirBnB site, and is quite comfortable and plenty quiet. Though the bath is not private it sure seemed that way as it is right across the hallway. And as advertised, the entire downstairs was accessible throughout my even access to music collection! I would definitely recommend Debby's place as its location is perfect for getting north or south via the light rail, the center of Columbia City is a short walk away."
6078382,46313245,2015-09-09,7270045,Vijayan,"The place was amazing and she was amazing!  She introduced us to the best Vietnamese place, an amazing local breakfast place, the best bagel place and an amazing espresso place very close by!  We are truly indebted. Thanks!"
6078382,46656440,2015-09-12,43263648,Katrina,"From beginning to end, a gracious host! Directions to her house were helpful and clear. Once I'd arrived, Debby sat down with me and gave fantastic recommendations for the city. Accommodations were as described - lovely room with high ceilings. There is some noise in the morning, but nothing crazy, just a bustling house getting ready for the day.  I'd definitely stay again!"
6078382,51376448,2015-10-19,2684418,Ulrich,"Everything about my experience at Debby's Farm House was positive. The room was ready when I arrived and it was clean and comfortable, exceeded my expectations, Debby was welcoming, without being intrusive, her recommendations and advise on where to go and what to do on point. This is the kind of Airbnb experience that makes anyone want to do Airbnb again. I highly recommend staying here. "
8457402,50253249,2015-10-10,28653860,Robby,"Jessica was very welcoming from the beginning. The downstairs bedroom and bathroom allowed for a very relaxed stay. The house was exceptionally clean. Jessica made sure we were well taken care of and she did more then needed to make our stay as pleasant as possible. Overall a great experience and if in the region again, we will be coming back! "
8457402,51252856,2015-10-18,46205417,Adil,"She was infact the best.
I never came across with such a gentle and kind person interms of providing hospitality and being good to the guest."
8457402,54257802,2015-11-17,26126218,Cody,Jessica was a fantastic host! She was incredibly welcoming the second we walked through the door. She has a beautiful home and I think the space listed was undersold! It really exceeded our expectations. My year and a half old came with us and loved playing with Jessica's son. The home is very child friendly and the location is great. Very close to I-5 and many great restaurants. If we ever come back to Seattle we will definitely book with Jessica. 
8457402,55548877,2015-12-01,49503393,Sadia,"Staying with Jessica was an absolute delight! I had the perfect amount of undisturbed privacy as well as the comfort and accommodations of a very beautiful and well kept home. The room peaked my expectations with an unbelievably cozy bed and more than enough space, and the private entrance and bath created the solace of a private getaway! The beautiful quiet view from both up and downstairs, the amazing central location and Jessica's open hearted warmth guarantee I would visit the most appropriately titled ""Private Serenity for Travelers"" again. "
8457402,55887049,2015-12-07,47563105,Naif,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6325685,33195703,2015-05-25,7868076,Marco,"Anna went above and beyond expectations as a host and we had an amazing time in Seattle. She was really generous, kindhearted and an all round fun person to be around.

The neighbourhood is really scenic and peaceful and the place is spacious with a large bed.

Anna was kind enough to drive us around and take us to various locations like food trucks and the mall, as well as the bus station after we checked out. She also treated us to coffee and fruit in the mornings.

This place was the perfect place for us and we had an incredible time!

Thanks so much,
Marco and Charlie"
6325685,33964975,2015-06-02,33985034,Scott,"I loved my stay here w/ Anna! It was my first time using airbnb and I couldn't have had a more wonderful experience. Anna's house is in a great location, lots of things in the area and very easy to get around. There are several bus lines nearby and I could get downtown via bus within 30 minutes. I was also able to get an Uber fairly easy here too, never had to wait more than 10 minutes.

The apartment was super nice and has great natural light for a basement unit. The bed was comfy and I slept great each night! The shower had great water pressure and got warm water quickly. The space was clean and in great condition. Felt right at home!

Anna was a great host, she was there when I needed suggestions on places to go and also just to talk to :) I did my own thing most of my trip but was able to check in with her at various times throughout my stay. Anna is very welcoming and hospitable, if I come back to Seattle and need a place to stay I would definitely stay here again! I highly recommend Anna to anyone looking to stay in Seattle."
6325685,34755142,2015-06-11,15013138,Violet,This was a lovely home with lots of space and nice comfortable  bed with a cool vibe I can't wait to go back again very helpful host
6325685,34825646,2015-06-12,34974421,John,Simple and positive experience staying here with Anna. Good location with easy access to downtown via bus. Studio under Anna's home has all amenities you can possibly need. Anna herself was very sweet and helpful. 
6325685,35235813,2015-06-16,33250196,Tone,"Anna was an excellent host! She is super warm, easy going, and as a Seattle native, very knowledgeable of the city at large. The place was very clean, comfortable, spacious, and private. The neighborhood is central to all parts of Seattle—no more than 15mins away from almost any neighborhood by car. If not mobile, there is a bus line close by that Anna can tell you more about The neighborhood is in walking distance to many restaurants and close to Green Lake where you can either jump in the lake, kayak, play volleyball, walk your pet or simply hang out and relax, among many other things. Just ask Anna! She is very friendly, loves her city, and can make many recommendations. I would definitely stay anywhere Anna is hosting again!"
6325685,35818804,2015-06-22,33169601,Abraham,"Anna is the best host EVER! We will definitely be coming back soon to visit Seattle, she had great recommendations and everything is less than 15 minutes away. Studio is perfect with lots of room and private, couldn't ask for anything else thank you Anna!"
6325685,35959636,2015-06-23,6918757,Dean,We had terrific time in the Greenlake area of Seattle.   Staying at Anna's basement apartment worked perfectly for our needs.  It was a hot weekend and is was a refreshing retreat from the heat.  There was one large bed for my mom and plenty of space in the seating area for me to place my air mattress.  Anna was very helpful in making us feel comfortable.  
6325685,36413726,2015-06-28,33997165,Eric,The basement is a great apartment and was very comfortable for two people. During the 80-90 degree days I was there it stayed nice and cool. 
6325685,36886404,2015-07-02,21916214,Nicola,"We had a fabulous stay in Seattle. Anna's studio was perfect for the two of us with our baby daughter. It was clean and roomy so we could spread our gear out. Anna was generous in providing some basics like bottled water and loads of towels. 
Bars, restaurants and supermarket all within walking distance and we were perfectly positioned to explore Seattle. 
I'd definitely recommend Anna as a host and given the chance we would stay with her again. "
6325685,37171353,2015-07-05,32095959,Vickie,"Anna is a great host. She was very responsive to messages and texts. The location of the house is excellent, within walking distance of restaurants, bars, and grocery stores, and just a quick drive to downtown Seattle.  Anna also lent us a book of nearby hikes.  Street parking is available 22 hours of the day directly in front and nearby for the remainder time. The apartment is very large, with plenty of room to move around, or in my case, open the suitcases on the floor and pull everything out. The bed is a large, comfy king size. 

With the recent heat wave, the basement apt is relatively cool, but I recommend bringing a fan to aid in circulation of the air because it may be stuffy until the sun finally goes down around 10. Checking in and out was a breeze. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for an excellent location for a Seattle experience. "
6325685,37981540,2015-07-12,28368387,Robert,"We had a wonderful week-long stay in Anna’s studio apartment.  The location is fabulous.  It’s a short and very pleasant walk from Anna’s to many restaurants and shops.  The studio itself is nicely laid out and has plenty of room.  There’s a washer, dryer, microwave, refrigerator, hot plate, TV (a Roku stick provides access to Netflix, HuluPlus, etc) and WiFi.  

Anna is a great host.  She’s extremely personable and is knowledgeable about both her neighborhood and Seattle.  We’ve already booked our next stay with Anna!"
6325685,38512230,2015-07-16,35335773,Jess,"Anna is the BEST! Her studio apartment was cozy and inviting, and she made us feel right at home when we arrived. I wish we could have taken the bed with us - so comfy!

If you want to be close to everything, this is the place. The location cannot be beat, period. If I weren't moving to Seattle, I would definitely stay there again!"

6325685,40397821,2015-07-30,5775807,David,"Anna was gracious, communicative and accommodating host as I was a very late arrival after the Mariners game. Clean, large, good value, etc. "
6325685,41462160,2015-08-07,33452601,Erica,Anna's place is perfect. And she was very responsive to texts. I stayed for a business trip and it was just a mile from my office. I'll definitely stay again. 
6325685,41765071,2015-08-09,8278463,Ilho,The house is cozy and relaxation. And the location is perfect. Very close to ballard and fremont. And takes 8~10 Minute to downtown. The host  anna is very comfortable and helpful. She has energy :). Very very thank u anna. We has great vacation in seattle!!
6325685,43245630,2015-08-18,36752399,Karen,"Anna was a welcoming and thoughtful host.

The rental is in a nice residential neighborhood,  but not far from downtown Seattle and other interesting neighborhoods. "
6325685,43525592,2015-08-20,17049627,Ramon,I had such a great time here and Anna was the best host I've encountered on AirBnB! She was so kind and welcoming I felt like I was at home the whole time! She was super knowledgeable on Seattle and everything to do around it she helped make my birthday vacation awesome! And the location is beautiful and perfectly placed for anything you want to do would recommend to anybody and will definitely be staying there again if given the chance! 
6325685,43698823,2015-08-21,26069792,Nels,"Anna is a great host.  She made sure we had everything we needed, was easy to get ahold of, and she was not intrusive.  The apartment was great (super comfortable bed) and it was awesome being able to walk to Green Lake Park.  

I would definitely recommend!"
6325685,44300071,2015-08-25,36354248,Mel,"We were visiting from Italy and stayed for 4 nights. The B&B was in a lovely spot close to Green Lake and close to the Wallingford area. There is a nice selection of restaurants on 45th. Bus service going downtown from Stone and 45th is very easy.  Our host Anna was wonderful, very accommodating and has plenty of suggestions for anyone not familiar with Seattle.  Our basement apartment was perfect, it is fully furnished.  It was a marvelous experience all around and we had a delightful stay. "
6325685,44670500,2015-08-28,39469128,David,What a lovely place to stay! Anna was so accommodating and helpful. The space is clean and easy and very comfy. 
6325685,45116840,2015-08-31,16745765,Ewa,"We had a lovely time at Anna's place - both her and the space are very welcoming. Clean, comfortable, spacious and cute studio and Anna was very accommodating. "
6325685,45337074,2015-09-01,41965981,Bridgette,"Anna was an amazing host! I decided to book her since I am 420 friendly and her place seemed much nicer then hotels twice as much!  Before arriving she made sure to text me and let me know how to access the apartment and was very kind. Gave me and my roommate lots of advice on what to do in the city, which was appreciated since we just were visiting for a little mini vacation. Wish I could've stayed longer, the place itself is beautiful and this will always be where I stay when I come to Seattle from now on! Anna made sure to say hello to us and really felt welcome, as if we were staying with a friend! Anna offered us the place a second night after guests had not been able to make it, which we both thought was very kind of her! She made sure to say good bye to us and let us know we are always welcome. Awesome first Airbnb experience, thanks Anna!"
6325685,46384222,2015-09-10,16525791,Alex,"We were fortunate enough to stay with Anna two nights - both in her private studio downstairs, as well as her guest bedroom in the main house. Both were a great experience! Anna has a lot of great insight on Seattle and the culture in the area. Would definitely come back. "

6325685,48034165,2015-09-22,23874658,Debra,"Loved the accommodations!  Private entrance was a plus and the availability of your own washer/dryer and kitchen and private bathroom really nice.  One caution however, using the search function for three people this place came up but there is only one king size bed.  The furniture (chairs/couch) did not provide any sleeping alternative for a third person.  We would highly recommend this place for a couple.  Parking is convenient and accurately described."
6325685,48385552,2015-09-26,18458774,Nick,"Anna was a very welcoming and knowledgeable host, when we are next in town we would definitely look to stay in the studio again."

We will definitely be back again. -Michael & Megan"
6325685,50976890,2015-10-16,34455452,Anne,"Anna was more than accommodating, she is truly an amazing and giving person. Her home is lovely and inviting.

Thank you so much for everything Anna. Nala her doggie is super calm and sweet too :) "
6325685,51312677,2015-10-19,33068268,Danielle,"This was basically our first Airbnb experience, and it was seamless thanks to Anna. We had been on the road for about 6 days and were beyond need for some relaxation. Anna was very understanding of our late check in, made sure we had everything we needed, and was very helpful in directing us to a great park to walk our dog. The location was super close to everything we needed, and because she had parking in front of the house we were able to park our 19' RV for the entire time we were there. Anna and her doggie are great hosts and we all recommend a Cannacation to anyone!!"
6325685,52008521,2015-10-25,22962618,Juan,"This place was great! Centrally located for ease of access to the city and great food spots. Anna was super nice, welcoming and helpful.

6325685,54825038,2015-11-23,15312155,Shea,Anna was an excellent host. Very welcoming and friendly. Accommodating to our needs. Even helped watch our dog for a bit while we got a bite to eat.  The space has everything you need.  
6325685,55108934,2015-11-28,31490445,Joan,"Anna was most helpful leading up to our visit by prompt acceptance of our reservation request, quick responses to my emails and flexibility in our arrival time. It is great that she lives upstairs. We met Anna the morning after we arrived. She had turned on the fireplace for us ahead of time to warm up the apartment since we had a late arrival and it was very cold outside. The apartment is very clean, inviting; bed very comfortable, linens/towels are cushy. Anna provided shampoo, bath wash which was wonderf¨l because I'd forgotten those things. She has a very chill dog named NaLa who is friendly to both people and other dogs. We had our dog with us and all went very well. The apartment was only 4 minutes from my daughter's home - so convenient for our stay. there is a park two blocks away for dog walking and the neighborhood is the lovely Wallingford area with easy access to the University of Washington and Green Lake areas. I highly recommend Anna's AirBnB."
6325685,55327983,2015-11-29,14481004,Stuart,"Anna's place was a great, relaxing apt in Seattle close to Fremont, Phinney Ridge, Green Lake and the Zoo. If you're visiting Seattle, and don't want to be in the city proper, this is a great place to stay.

The apt itself was clean and had everything we needed, perfect after a long day out in the city, and the huge bed was amayzing!

Thanks Anna!"
6325685,55920786,2015-12-07,46658955,Brian,"Anna was great!  The place was clean, spacious, and within walking distance of several restaurants and bars.  She made us feel very welcome and even gave us some parting gifts.  Would love to have another cannacation when I am back in the area.  "

3977450,21248296,2014-10-13,19476601,Ali,"Carol's place is very low key, convenient an she is a great host.
This was my second time staying there and I would stay there again for sure."
3977450,21628973,2014-10-20,22369240,Skyler,"Carol was very friendly and welcoming. The room was in a basement with it's own entrance, which made me happy I could come and go without bothering anyone. The bed is a raised airbed, but that was fine with me. The room was clean, and the bathroom was clean. Carol offered me coffee and breakfast all three mornings I was there. She really wants your stay to be comfortable and is willing to take advice to make it better."
3977450,22285934,2014-11-02,2079495,Elizabeth,"This was the second time I've stayed with Carol, I came back because she is such an excellent host and the room is very comfortable and clean. Just a note, I had no idea Carol was a  smoker until she told me. You can't smell anything inside her house, and as a non-smoker who is very sensitive to smells I was perfectly fine. I would definitely recommend her place."
3977450,22689964,2014-11-11,16876176,Oris,Carol was a great host. I enjoyed talking about literature and arts and culture.
3977450,22806506,2014-11-15,6671256,Sam,"The Bed-less Budget Basement was perfect for my needs and I very much enjoyed my stay!  For a price not found anywhere else in the city, had all the amenities you need and it was an ideal location to go out and explore Seattle; the house is near the light rail, bus service, and close enough to Pioneer Square and the International District to walk.  

I enjoyed my stay at Carol's!  I suggest this place to anyone looking to visit Seattle!"
3977450,22974497,2014-11-18,1343293,Richard,"Carol's house was comfortable and attractive, a great base for visiting the city.  She was very accomodating and my stay was very pleasant.  And the downstairs room was a great bargain,  thanks Carol"
3977450,23285213,2014-11-27,10281202,Elaine,"Carol is a great host. She is hilarious! I enjoyed staying there! Thank you, Carol! "
3977450,23645000,2014-12-07,23593795,Pham,Carol is a great host. I did arrive late and she was tired but she was still very accommodating. I only needed a place to stay over for the night and this was excellent. I was able to get a good night rest and leave in the morning without much disturbance. The house is in a very hilly area. 
3977450,27031938,2015-02-23,27816934,Jims,"The room was nice and quiet. In the mornings, Carol and I talked for hours. She has quite an intellectual personality. We got along just swell.  

Regarding the smoking: She only smokes outside and is very considerate about it. Regardless, she's a gracious and hospitable host.  THANK YOU, Carol!"
3977450,27381834,2015-03-02,27816934,Jims,"The room is great and is as depicted. Carol has lived in the city most of her life (expect for that time in the Ivy League), so ask about Seattle's history when you hire her as your tour guide. Also, her patio is a nice place to sit and unwind outdoors."
3977450,27747259,2015-03-10,28662025,Yutaka,"I came from Japan and wasn't able to speak what I felt well by English, but she was very generous.

She gave me much informative advice about Seattle and thanks to it, I could have so nice experience in here.
She even voluntarily polished my  English business mail.

Thank you, Carol!"
3977450,27835296,2015-03-13,14755415,Vanessa,"Carol was frienly and nice to support my check-in at late night. The space is very confirmtable for me to stay even it is not a real bed. There is bus transit station and link light rail station within 10 minutes walk distance which is convenient for traveling without having a car. The house is on the hill. If you takes link light rail to this house, it is recommended to get off at Beacon Hill station that will be more easy to move your luggage from station to the house."
3977450,28624362,2015-03-27,29408043,Yiheng,carol is a very nice people who take care if our tourists，I really appreciate her help
3977450,28919615,2015-03-31,30158543,Tomas,"I very much enjoyed staying here. The North Beacon Hill location was ideal for me, as I travel and tend to spend a lot of time in Columbia City, the International district and Beacon hill. It was also far enough away from Capitol Hill and downtown to have a residential feel to it, like a home away from home that was modest and comfortable.

The hospitality of the host was outstanding. Not only was she graceful and accommodating, as I was new to airbnb, but she was also very clear in communicating and was an interesting host to talk to."
3977450,29419762,2015-04-07,3682424,Tim,"Not in downtown; however easy access to public transit. Carol makes all the efforts to make you feel at home, while conducting stimulating conversations (if you chose not to talk to her then its like she is not there). Thank you for the lovely stay!"
3977450,30536502,2015-04-23,27893479,Shawn,I enjoyed chatting with Carol. She made me feel welcome and also made sure that I felt comfortable there. I liked the fact I could park and the backyard was nice to lounge around. Thanks for the breakfast snacks!
3977450,31144472,2015-05-02,7485789,Julian,"Clean, quiet place. If you're ok with Carol's rules, then you should be satisfied."
3977450,31825808,2015-05-10,31732898,Nagarajan,"It will be good place to live for people working near downtown.
No disturbance. She is kind of good person!"
3977450,32131310,2015-05-14,31938054,Cynthia,"Carol is a gracious and kind hostess. I found the listing to be very accurate- it all looks just like the photos, it is close to food options and a short commute to the city, and simple accommodations but all you really need. The toiletry kit was a nice touch, and her list of directions for space use, trash sorting, and internet in the room were helpful. This is probably easier to stay at if you have your own car- I never tried to take public transit from there but it is in a quiet neighborhood. "
3977450,32442686,2015-05-18,33512164,Omar,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3977450,32625708,2015-05-19,33031390,Nam-Ju,"It was a good place to stay. It was not that far from the downtown Seattle if I took Link. She is a very nice person to talk, it was also not that lonely to stay alone :) "
3977450,32860676,2015-05-22,33437378,Douglas,"Great place to stay. Friendly, clean, and good transport links into the city."
3977450,33128341,2015-05-25,14752026,Yvonne,Carol was a friendly host. The location is about 15 minutes walk away from the Light rail or bus station and is not too far from downtown or Seattle center so it's a good place if you don't mind walking or have a car. The place was also neat and clean. I enjoyed my stay and interaction with Carol and the other guest. 
3977450,33600408,2015-05-30,31863140,Johnny,First time using airbnb. I had great experience thanks to Carol and her hospitality. The place had everything I needed and great location close to everything. I will definitely be back when opportunity presents itself. 
3977450,33966723,2015-06-02,14634467,Ron,"Overall, a wonderful AirBnb experience here. If you travel light and like to walk, it is doable to walk to Carol's place from either SoundTransit's Beacon Hill LINK light rail station (further walk, but easier as it goes downhill), or the Mt. Baker LINK station (somewhat shorter walk, but most of it is uphill!). Upon meeting Carol you will appreciate her sense of humor and warm, gregarious nature, as she greets you and explains everything to you and easily clarifies any concerns you have and communicates well with the AirBnb messaging system. You could hang out in her backyard patio and enjoy some long philosophical conversations with her, or drop your things and leave, or be a hermit, it's all up to you. But personally, I got a lot more as I talked with and interacted with her and some of the fellow guests staying around. I learned a lot, was able to easily go downtown via LINK and back, and the aerobed was great."
3977450,34263003,2015-06-06,17656128,Koa,"Great cozy little room with a nice comfy bed and the price was just right as well! The home is a quick walk to the light rail, so you're not far from most areas that you would want to visit.
Carol was a pretty awesome host, one of the straightest shooters i've met and that was refreshing. You knew exactly what she expected from you as a guest and was very kind and helpful. Oh, and she also took me to get donuts. =]"
3977450,34738041,2015-06-11,6911592,Suman,Carol was a gracious host. She is quite knowledgeable about Seattle and getting around. She is conveniently located couple of blocks from the link light rail. I enjoyed my five day stay at her place.
3977450,34989112,2015-06-14,32931609,Yuki,"This place was my first. I will not forget the experience. Because Ms Carol is very kind for me.I'm studying English, my English is not good. But she taught me some English and talking with me long time. I was very relieved. I have stayed the room which was very comfortable. I could sleep very well. I have enjoyed many things, I will never forget walking around the Jefferson park with her. Thank you very much!"
3977450,35121703,2015-06-15,9600303,Tom,"Exactly as described: clean, small, comfortable, convenient location. I would stay here again."
3977450,35430579,2015-06-18,35161537,Manasa,Carol is very welcoming. We had nice little chats. The room was  spacious and clean. The neighborhood is calm and pleasant. I had a great stay.
3977450,35571393,2015-06-20,28341706,Kenneth,Carol was a great host. She offered snacks and beverages in addition to a  nice place at a great value. The room was as described and she even double checked my needs to make sure there were no false expectations. Carol went above and beyond to make sure I was comfortable. Thank you so much!
3977450,35945838,2015-06-23,34151303,Neeraj,"
Carol was really welcoming and shown me the places around as well.

Its the Best option to reside if you are planning to visit Seattle."
3977450,36467066,2015-06-28,36302075,Brian,"Carol was a great host, everything was accurate in the listing. Nice clean place in a convenient location. I would love to stay there again sometime. "

3977450,36630775,2015-06-29,10932145,Sheila,"Carol is exactly what I look for in an Air BnB host. She was very straightforward and the room was exactly as described. When I got to her house she welcomed me inside, gave me a tour, laid out the house rules and then let me do my own thing. I really appreciated how she laid out food for her guests in the morning and that the rooms/bathroom were very clean and tidy.The house is fairly close to downtown if you're driving and the neighborhood was quiet and felt safe. 

All in all, perfect for a one night trip to Seattle. Carol spells out exactly what she offers - no surprises - and she was very responsive when I booked the room. "
3977450,37054226,2015-07-04,32067794,Yuka,"I spent a nice time with Carol and other guests in Seattle!! 
She was very responsible and the room was clean so I could stay very comfortable. 
She often asked me to talk with her even though I'm not good English speaker!

Thank you carol!!"
3977450,37586143,2015-07-08,19359439,ShiJun,"Carol is incredibly nice as a host and will be willing to invite you for a chat at her backyard and also while driving. She is also extremely hospitable and will keep insisting that you grab something off before heading out to explore the city! Will love to chat with here more and she has an amazing spirit about her! She even offered me a ride to the station heading towards the airport. 

Her place is nicely located close to the city and it is just a 5mins walk down to the train station which offers you plenty of options to explore Seattle. Getting there to her place walking down a lot of blocks (steep slopes) mainly going down might be tiring for someone with a huge luggage like me... Using Uber to get to downtown is easy and below 10USD.  The place is air conditioned, however, it is down the basement and some people might feel weird sleeping on the floor and sleeping down in the basement. The experience was a lot more pleasant than what I imagined it to be in the first day. The items provided were good also! It was overall an amazing stay! "
3977450,38544055,2015-07-16,6991925,Pushkar,"I had a wonderful stay at Carol's Beacon Hill pit stop. Carol is a kind, considerate and gracious host. I appreciated my conversations with her. The room was perfect for my needs as I was going to be out all day and I slept soundly at night. The location is very convenient and close to the downtown core. Would not hesitate at all to recommend Carol's house to any prospective Seattle visitor."
3977450,41108102,2015-08-04,36735583,Rachel,"I am very happy with my stay at Carol's home. She was very flexible about my check in and check out times, as I was upfront with her from the beginning. The room itself is cozy with a large closet. I only got to speak briefly with Carol herself, but she was personable and welcoming. Given the chance, I would definitely stay again."
3977450,41412762,2015-08-07,37736087,Danny,"The description is highly accurate and you are advised to read it as it contains most of the information you need. For instance, if you read the listing, you would know which stop to go etc. Otherwise, it is a very convenient and comfortable location. Had a good night's sleep and food is nearby if you are there at night."
3977450,41992367,2015-08-10,38017367,Josh,Carol was a gracious host and the room was fantastic!
3977450,42343314,2015-08-12,22455698,Lizi," Nice room, convenient location and friendly host. I appreciate Carol let me check-in early, and lead me to a closer link station. The picture is as true as you see the room. Small but enough for a single person. This is my first airbnb experience, and it is wonderful. Next time I definitely will chose this room again."

really good host!"

3977450,43158546,2015-08-17,40810692,Carmina,I enjoyed my stay at Carol's airbnb. The whole house and atmosphere was homey and welcoming. Carol responded quickly to my questions and was flexible. The room and adjacent bathroom are clean and homey - just like the pictures. The location was convenient to 2 light rail station stops which are 15 minutes from downtown. I highly recommend this place and would totally would stay there again if I ever need to go to Seattle again! Thanks Carol!
3977450,44370632,2015-08-25,2741751,Mark,"Carol is a great host! She is very good on pre-arrival communication and is available while you are staying to answer any questions. The two items I look for with an Airbnb stay are location and cleanliness. Carol's place is very clean, both the room and the bathroom. Her wall artwork is interesting and eclectic. All in all, it was an excellent stay and I hope to stay there on my next trip to Seattle."
3977450,44475574,2015-08-26,41422033,Bobby,"This was my 1st AirBnB stay and experience. Carol has a very nice place to rest and sleep. Clear rules of the house were displayed, the room was comfortable and clean. I slept well. 

The overall experience was positive, easy to get too, and with easy access to Safeco and Century Link. 

I lost the keys to the house and room after leaving for my event and that was embarrassing and have no idea where it could have been lost! I immediately tried to contact Carol and was not able to speak to her directly that night. 

Next morning, we had a good conversation about the lost keys and we reached a mutual agreement for her to call the lock smith and to get the locks changed. That day! We agree to use the AirBnB process and not sure what it was called for her to get re-reimbursed for getting the locks changed. She gave and estimate of what she paid previously and I agreed.

She had the locks changed that day, I was notified of the bill and I paid promptly via AirBnB. Carol was great during our conversation and if it was not for the fact that I was feeling embarrassed, a great conversation. 

Recommend Carols place for those travelers needing to rest up during transition stop in Seattle or have a sport/event to attend in the area."
3977450,45042772,2015-08-30,41059918,Vicky,Carol is a nice lady if you open your heart with her. She is also pay a lot of attention on quality of life. You will have a comfortable experience here with her and the roommates. 
3977450,45165197,2015-08-31,38995224,Xia,"Totally, Carol is a very nice lady.    She just asked me about where I would go in Seattle and drove me around it.  I appreciate it very much.   Carol is conversable and easy to get along .  I had only spent 1 night here and have learnt a lot of history of Seattle,which  is the last stop .   What a wonderful ending I have in America!"
3977450,45451041,2015-09-02,26275722,Tintu,Carol was an honest straight forward host and she has a good place too. She has  good knowledge of the city and would be happy to share a few tips. The place is well maintained and the location is quite good too. 
3977450,46096024,2015-09-07,20446929,Aaron,"Carol was very helpful and friendly.  The room was exactly as soon/described.  It's a very modest setup, but clean and well maintained.  Perfect for a single body that needs to crash, and had a great time jawboning with Carol and one of her other guests. "
3977450,47418633,2015-09-18,32419224,Loren,"Nice quiet cool room, close into to south Downtown."

3977450,48853918,2015-09-28,42263549,Jacob,"Carol's home is EXACTLY as it is described in the listing. It is by far the cleanest, most organized, smoothest Airbnb experience I've had. Carol was super kind to me. The best part was hanging out on the porch, drinking coffee and trying to solve the worlds problems :) I would highly recommend staying here to anyone."
3977450,48973463,2015-09-29,42263549,Jacob,Great spot. Very clean and organized. Carol is a terrific host!
3977450,49863401,2015-10-06,34306382,Kevin,"Place looked just like the photos. The bed was clean and very comfortable. 
Checking in was easy and nice having own side door to get to the room. 

If you take the Link rail system to the house, it is close by and walkable. But there is a steep hill. "
3977450,52640210,2015-10-31,325845,Sean,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay with Carol.  The Zen Room was clean and comfortable, and located next to a bathroom, which was nice.  The private entrance made it easy for me to come and go as I needed.  I commute to Seattle often for work and so the location near the Mt. Baker Light Rail Station (about a 7-minute walk for me) was convenient for getting downtown to my office.  The Oak pub/restaurant up the hill is a good food/drink option, as is Bar del Corso.  Carol was a kind and gracious host, and I appreciated her hospitality throughout my stay.  Would definitely stay there again.  "
3977450,53427692,2015-11-08,5763451,Chao,"I enjoyed my short 1 night stay at Carol's place! It's very clean, simple and has got everything I need. The private entrance was great as I can get in and out without disturbing the host. It also happens to be quite close to the Museum of Flight which is the #2 attraction in Seattle tripadvisor. Would definitely return!"
3977450,53759534,2015-11-12,30027221,Hui,"It was an awesome experience staying with Carol. The house was very big with pretty rooms and very tidy.

3977450,55412803,2015-12-01,19707419,Joseph,"Carol's place was great! The place is located in a pretty quiet and residential neighborhood.

Clean and equipped. Also walking distance to nearby restaurants and deli. We loved just sitting on the balcony and watching the sunset! 
841274,3921684,2013-03-27,5417958,Jodi,"Loved Goat Hill, and Gucci.  Jill was a wonderful host and the apt was quiet and comfortable.  The atmosphere with the goats and chickens was super.  No noise or odor from them.  It was a wonderful haven in a stressful time.  Jodi "

841274,5366439,2013-06-26,3831738,Shanna,"We enjoyed our stay at Goat Hill very much! It is a gorgeous and  tidy space in a beautiful craftsman style home. There were treats, coffee and fresh eggs waiting for us, since our flight was delayed and we got in very late it was great not to have to run out first thing in the AM. Everything we wanted to see in the city was close to the house and we were downtown to Pikes Market in less than 15 minutes. We had fun drinking out coffee while strolling in the yard and meeting the goats and chickens. Highly recommended. "
841274,5675519,2013-07-11,4699461,Matt,"We very much enjoyed staying with Jill while we were in Seattle. The apartment is very comfortable with a good kitchen and lounge and it was very pleasant sitting out in the garden to eat. The highlight for us were the goats and the hummingbirds, which came to drink from the flowers in the garden. Jill was very helpful and made us fell right at home. We came from SeaTac by light rail and then walked the half mile to Jill's, which was fine. The centre of Seattle is about 15 minutes by bus and there is a lovely park nearby sloping down to the beautiful lake Washington shoreline. Thank you Jill."
841274,5728591,2013-07-14,2260847,Lucas,This place was very comfortable - it had everything we needed and Jill was very nice and always helpful when we needed her.  We would definitely stay here on future trips to the Seattle area.  The area was very nice and quiet as well!
841274,5866205,2013-07-20,6865636,Susanna,"Jill outdid herself with all the finishing touches - fruit bread and cheese in the refrigerator, lots of helpful tips around the apartment, wifi easily accessed, and a back yard to die for. We loved having the chickens and goats around for entertainment. Everything in the whole place was tended to with great care. The bed was the best. It was a great spot to refresh from our long journey, the preparation for which I included here in the definition of LONG. Thanks Jill! If we ever come back to Seattle, you will be number one!"
841274,5990260,2013-07-25,7291241,Karen,Wonderful quiet very nice refuge in the big city.  Very comfortable bed even though I was a little worried about the bunk bed. Only thing I missed was milk for my tea.  Highly recommend it!
841274,6103233,2013-07-30,5635586,Caroline,"We stayed here for four nights. The house looks great and is in a really nice and kids-friendly neighbourhood (with really nice neighbours!). The apartment is on the back of the house on the ground floor and has it's own entrance. It is a really nice place and very complete, with enough space for the four of us. Our 3-year old (and we)  loved the bunk bed. The kitchen was big and we found bread, good cheese and cookies in the fridge. The place has everything you need, i cannot think of a thing we missed. The goats and chickens were very lovely and our kids loved to feed them kiwi-tree-leaves. The little dog Gucci is a sweetheart and he loves to keep you company. It is a short ride into town or to the space needle. Three blocks down there is a communal garden, with a tractor for kids to play on. Lake Washington is within walking distance. We didn't meet the host (we did meet her daughter), but everything was well taken care of. She was very responsive over email. I would highly recommend this place and when we come back to Seattle we will try to stay here again!"
841274,6300984,2013-08-07,5703411,Lana Van,"This was a GREAT place to stay in Seattle. It was in close proximity to most of Seattle's main attractions like the Space Needle, Harbor, and Pike's Market. We had a car rental but there is also a variety of public transportation available in the neighborhood. The living space is gorgeous and very neatly laid out. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who would like to visit Seattle. "
841274,6513823,2013-08-15,7027351,Clint,"Me and my friend had an absolutely great time in Seattle, and Jill's Goat House was one big reason why.  The space was very clean, comfortable, and had many amenities I am not used to having while on a trip.  The house is near the #14 bus line that goes right to downtown Seattle and Pike's Place market.  And there is a quaint feeling to the house.  Jill herself is very sweet and helpful.

This was my first time trying something like this, but this experience has left a very good positive impression in my mind, and I feel her house will add greatly to anyone wanting to experience Seattle.  

Thanks so much Jill, and God Bless!"

841274,6879522,2013-08-28,8069913,David,"Great space, great location, and the goats and chickens were very friendly. We were able to able to arrive late and let ourselves in with a key in a lock box. We had a busy schedule with friends and relatives during our short stay, so we didn't actually connect with Jill until we were on our way out. Jill is very congenial and we highly recommend this to anyone looking for a home away from home in Seattle! "
841274,7277039,2013-09-14,7722953,Stefan,"Jill is an awesome host and the apt is great. Good location, extremly comfortable and with cute goats :) will stay here again if possible :)"
841274,7412954,2013-09-19,2949524,Bj,"A perfect place to stay, close to everything but in your own private sanctuary. Very charming with the goats and chickens, fresh eggs are a nice treat! Very spacious and tasteful inside. We had a great time."
841274,7674759,2013-09-29,8572228,Ellen,"It was a vacation just being in our wonderful abode at Goat Hill. We went for other reasons, but found the stocked refrigerator and comfortable setting enticing and did not want to leave. Jill is readily available and responsive. We want to come back again. It is a great home away from home."
841274,7803640,2013-10-03,6731519,Emelie,"Our stay at Goat Hill was very good! Even though we came on short notice Jill was very helpful and lovely. The apartment is nice, clean and comfortable, and all information you can wish for is neatly collected in a folder. The neighborhood is quiet and lovely, and there is a bus station close by to seattle down town. I can warmly recommend anyone to stay at Goat Hill."
841274,7919148,2013-10-08,8011931,Colleen,"Jill is a great host, her home was very accommodating with all the amenities needed to make us feel at home away from home. I loved her personal touch with the bowl of fruit & some farm fresh eggs. The location was a short walk to a major grocery store & the light rail, great neighborhood. We were so lucky to have 4 days of sun for our stay, we enjoyed the porch & viewing the goats & chickens. We would definitely recommend Jill & Gucci for your hosts."
841274,8004164,2013-10-12,3731128,Andrea,"We loved Goat Hill! Our family (mom, dad, and 3 & 4 year olds) stayed at Jill's place for 4 days. The apartment is conveniently located close to the rail station and bus stops. (Tip: take the #14, much less up hill walking!) We were able to explore downtown Seattle and surrounding neighborhoods (Bellevue, Queen Anne, U District, etc) with great ease and come home in the evening to a comfortable resting place. The fresh snacks in the fridge were a great touch-and a hit with the kids! We loved exploring the backyard- the hens are gorgeous. The added amenities of the stocked kitchenware, laundry, wifi, AppleTV, and composting truly made Jill's place feel like home. "
841274,8897429,2013-11-25,8833625,Michele,"WONDERFUL place to stay in Seattle! The apartment is beautifully furnished and very private. Jill is extremely thoughtful, leaving food in the fridge and is available if you have any needs. I will definitely stay with her again when visiting the city!"
841274,9011279,2013-12-01,10270544,Gina,"We live in the area and decided to put up our family (two adults and a toddler) in an AirBNB instead of a hotel that would have been less convenient.  Despite a last minute reservation request, owner Jill was quite accommodating.  Our family enjoyed the stay writing
""Our stay at the Goat Hill House was very nice and comfortable it was like being at home. The amenities were perfect for our little family."""
841274,9215816,2013-12-14,2160040,Ben,"Our family of 4 including a newborn and a toddler transitioned to a new city from Seattle and Goat HIll House was our 'launchpad'.  Jill was a great hostess, her house is immaculate and cozy, and the neighborhood is quite and centrally located.  We hope Goat Hill is available when we come back to visit our friends in Seattle.  Thanks Jill!"
841274,9584861,2014-01-03,8900323,Sally,"I rented Goat Hill Apt for 10 days for my son's visit from California during the holidays. The apartment is an exceptionally welcoming and comfortable environment and I am very particular about living spaces. It was very clean and modern with all the updated amenities you need, yet it felt very homey and quaint, unlike a hotel suite.  The home is in a very nice, safe area in Seattle. 
I had never rented from Airbnb and didn't quite know how it would be renting a place in someone's home, but Jill was a perfect host and gave us our privacy, which was my only concern in renting a private place. 
I would highly recommend Goat Hill to anyone visiting Seattle. Along with the delightful living space, there's the added enjoyment of visiting and petting the sweet, friendly goats and seeing the chickens.  It truly is a little slice of the country in the midst of the city.
It's a great place and I would most definitely rent it again."
841274,13878859,2014-06-07,14323607,Christopher,"Jill was a delight of a host, and the apartment was even nicer than I expected. It is a beautifully finished space, and the neighborhood is so delightful that I ended up buying a house not far away. What better endorsement can you ask for?"
841274,14157882,2014-06-13,15481745,Anna,Jill was an excellent  host and her place was very comfortable. we all felt right at home. This was our first experience using airbnb and it was definitely a positive one. Jill gave us much privacy yet was always available via phone for any questions or concerns. The apt was very well appointed with appropiate instructions and useful information about the city. Very close to city in a quiet neighborhood within walking distance to a lakeside beach. Would recommend 100%. Thanks again Jill. Oh the goats and hummingbirds added unique character and charm!
841274,14735599,2014-06-25,14381417,Luke,"This was my first time using AirBnb but my brother said that it was the nicest one he's ever seen. It was extremely nice. Jill was very helpful and provided a book of information about the house as well as Seattle bus routes, eating, and other info. Everything that was needed had been provided including plenty of towels and blankets, the fridge even had some necessities in it :) 

Also, the goats are a big plus especially if you have children. Overall it was a very pleasant experience. Worth every penny!"
841274,15048483,2014-07-01,10428713,Aris,"Jill's place is fantastic.  It was very new, clean, and had everything we needed, including wifi, kitchen and laundry.  It was the perfect place to stay for me and my friends as we explored the Seattle area.  We would definately stay there again.

Aris"
841274,15260611,2014-07-06,13366170,Tessa,"Great little back house in a very nice neighborhood. The space was perfect for the two of us plus 4 month old baby. Kitchen is fully equipped and Jill left us some nice fresh fruit and other items upon arrival. Check in was easy.
Free and easy parking right in front of the house. If you don't have a car, be prepared for lots of up and downhill walking! 
The apartment is spacious and clean. Internet is not so fast. But, there are goats and chickens!"
841274,15539730,2014-07-11,1422803,Sarah,"We had a great stay! The sofa bed was the most comfortable I have ever used. The place is thoughtfully taken care of. I highly recommend it.
"
841274,15954630,2014-07-19,15189166,Leah,"Jill made my daughter and I feel very welcomed. She is a very friendly person. The apartment is nice and has a comfortable feel. The goats love to be scratched behind their ears!
"
841274,16773313,2014-08-02,15966761,Jim,"I'm not sure if this already sent.  However, we had an excellent stay.  The apartment is lovely and immaculately clean.  Jill makes you feel comfortable without being at all intrusive.  The location is great for us, since my family lives nearby, but it is close to most of Seattle.  We stayed there with our adult daughter and it was a little tight when her bed was pulled out, but that wasn't really a problem during the day.  We would love to stay there again!"
841274,17429717,2014-08-12,13504329,Katie,"Great location, easy access to downtown by bus or light rail.  The apartment was also very nice, well decorated, clean, and we very much appreciated the fruit and snacks that were waiting for us upon arrival.  The sofa bed was  very comfortable as far as sofa beds go.  We hope to be back someday! "
841274,18179086,2014-08-23,17824234,Daniel,"We had a wonderful stay at Goat Hill House Apt! Jill answered all of our questions and was a wonderful host. Our daughter loved the goats & chickens in the backyard -- it was definitely a fun experience for all of us. The apartment & surrounding neighborhood were quiet & peaceful, and the location was quite convenient to all of the sightseeing around town. "
841274,18361926,2014-08-25,3105614,Chris,"The apartment was everything I expected from the listing.  Quiet place.  Quiet neighborhood.  Jill was very pleasant, we chatted briefly the day I left and shared about the neighborhood, which I found to be a great area for a morning walk.  Great views of the city from the hills, a community garden/park - very nice and relaxing.  And the goats! What can you say? She has goats and chickens! Very unique. "
841274,18536359,2014-08-28,16827886,Adam G.,"Jill made sure we had a very smooth check-in.  She had lots of things in the apartment we are not used to have and which made our lives much easier: there were fresh eggs and fruit, oil, spices, popcorn, tee, coffee, etc.  Unlike at other places, we did not have to rush first night to a local grocery to buy basics, but we could simply eat in.  

Our daughter loved the goats and the chicken in the garden.  The garden itself was great to have - we usually had breakfast outside.

The place was super clean and everything was there what we needed, incl. a well equipped kitchen.  We were also impressed by the selection of books about the area, maps, coupons, etc. which Jill put into the apartment.

The bus downtown was just a 3-minute walk from the house and it was very convenient that we did not need to take our car downtown.  Also, the neighbourhood offered some very nice walks, such as along the shore of Lake Washington."
841274,19195366,2014-09-08,17403098,Laura,"Everything was exactly how it was described in the listing, only better. The host was gracious and helpful. The apartment was very well equipped. The garden with the goats and chickens was lovely and fun. We enjoyed sitting outside in the beautiful back garden watching the hummingbirds. "
841274,19548789,2014-09-14,20538257,Joy,"We really enjoyed our stay at Goat Hill House. Jill was a wonderful host and there were many thoughtful touches that improved our visit - a bowl of fresh fruit and snacks in the fridge, for example. The house (a mother-in-law unit in the back of Jill's home) felt private and was very well maintained. We loved visiting with the goats (so sweet) and the yard is lovely. My techie partner loved the Apple TV setup and the wifi connection was much appreciated. Our only constructive criticisms are minor: 1) The air conditioning was pre-set and always blasting, making for a very chilly house. It would be nice to have more control over the temperature. 2) The pillows on the bed were really limp and should be replaced. Again, these are quibbles - we truly enjoyed the accommodations and would return in a heartbeat. "
841274,20018466,2014-09-22,19581100,Randee,"the house is lovely and cozy; a perfect fit for a course or a small family. it was clean and surprisingly spacious for such a small space. 
the goats were adorable and the chickens were quiet. 
the bed was ridiculously comfortable. 
I was a little bummed about the lack of local TV stations (no football) and the internet connection was spotty at best. 
Other than that, I loved it and am excited to stay here again next time I'm in town. I will definitely recommend it to friends. "
841274,20519477,2014-09-30,10574201,Amber,"The small apartment was pefect for my visit to Seattle.  It's centrally located, within a short drive to freeways and downtown sights.  The full kitchen meant that I didn't have to eat out for every meal.  There was no problem with parking and finding that a washer and dryer were available as well was a great surprise.   "
841274,20869247,2014-10-06,15667649,Jennifer,"Great place. Clean, large, nice yard. Thank you for a great stay!"
841274,21243935,2014-10-13,21944120,Sara,"We had a lovely stay at Goat Hill House!  The apartment was very comfortable & charming.  We had everything we needed, and the house manual had plenty of useful info to help us get around the neighborhood and use the space, including laundry facilities, WiFi, access to Netflix instant, etc. We even found treats in the fridge!  The goats and chickens were friendly & a sweet little addition to our stay.  : )

The neighborhood was pleasant, with some very good restaurants in walking distance, and it was conveniently close to downtown Seattle.

Thanks Jill for a lovely weekend!"
841274,21560945,2014-10-19,3691311,Cece,"Great place, easy access to all of Seattle.  very clean home with all amenities, just what we need.  Thanks!"
841274,21994789,2014-10-27,3942741,Matthew,Great apartment in central location. Everything is as described. The place we exceptionally clean and nicely decorated. Communication with host was excellent. I'd be happy to stay at Jill's apartment next time we'll be visiting Seattle.
841274,22326907,2014-11-03,3379294,Martin,We did enjoy our vacations very much. Jill is offering a very lovely appartment.
841274,22627215,2014-11-10,23229035,Andrew,"The Goat Hill House could not have been more convenient and easy to access as our weekend landing pad while in Seattle.  Whether running around the city, going to the Seahawks game, or hanging out with old friends nearby, we certainly made the right choice and will be signing up for another stay for future trips!  Thanks to Jill for making it all so fluid for us!  "
841274,24578029,2014-12-31,17159140,Stacy,I felt very welcomed and the site was very nice. It was nice to have a place where you had the privacy and conveniences as if you were at home.
841274,25609362,2015-01-20,25664307,Aliya,"I really enjoyed staying at Jill's AirBnb. Everything was just as pictured, and she was available whenever I had any questions. The neighborhood is very residential, and if I were to stay here again I would most likely rent a car. Overall, a very positive experience and I would recommend this AirBnb to others!"
841274,26464094,2015-02-13,25516743,Marsha,"We so enjoyed our visit to Jill's lovely place. From the arrangement of the rooms to the decor, comfort & privacy, everything was absolutely perfect and even exceeded our expectations! We had family visit for dinner one night and appreciated that there was even a booster chair with tray available for our granddaughter, which made our evening so much more enjoyable. The kitchen was very well-equipped.  Jill's attention to detail and thoughtfulness in anticipating her guests needs was evident...there was even a washer and dryer available.  We also enjoyed the goats & were amazed that flowers were growing right outside our window even though it was February.  The neighborhood was quiet & lovely with lots of flowers and ample parking. "
841274,26606456,2015-02-16,26016901,Kristina,Space was vey nice and clean. Like having your own apartment on vacation. Picture doesn't show how spacious the rest of the space is.
841274,28280224,2015-03-21,4564811,Ashley,"Jill was a wonderful host and we loved staying at Goats at Play! It was everything the description said, very clean and a great location. We would definitely stay here again for another visit!"
841274,28825684,2015-03-30,29300966,RunFeng,Jill is a very nice nice host. We're enjoy our holiday in Goat Hill.
841274,30628676,2015-04-25,30307824,Matthew,"We felt very welcome, and had a very comfortable stay.  Our kids loved interacting with the goats, and their were several parks within walking distance.  Jill was very prompt and responsive to any concerns and questions we had."
841274,32053012,2015-05-13,28545769,Catherine,"Great place to stay -- quiet, private, easy.  Nice Seattle neighborhood with pleasant walks and cafes nearby, steep stair walk down to Lake Washington.  Good, functional clean kitchen and access to laundry.  Easy in-and-out via lockbox with a key.  Street parking ample and I felt safe in the neighborhood.  On nice days, very pleasant back yard with chairs, table and umbrella.  "
841274,33583127,2015-05-30,13571449,Gwendolyn,"Wir haben die 16 Tage bei Jill sehr genossen. Die Wohnung war top eingerichtet, hatte eine gute und ruhige Lage, die Busse und die lightrail waren nicht weit und auch ein großer Supermarkt war noch in Laufweite. Jill gab uns nette Tipps und sie war schon vor der Anreise ständig in Kontakt mit uns. Mit unseren Kinder war sie sehr entspannt. Der Kühlschrank war schon mit einigen Dingen für uns bestückt. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen. Danke Jill!"
841274,34474591,2015-06-08,33691422,Katey,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I was not disappointed! My fiancé and I spent a few nights in Jill's apartment and had a truly lovely time. The space is clean, well furnished, and built to suit your every need! Jill was so welcoming and went out of her way to make sure we were situated and comfortable, giving us suggestions for places to go and even stocking our fridge with some snacks. The location was great with ample street parking: downtown Seattle was very accessible by bus, and we got a chance to explore Mt. Baker and even meet the neighbors. The goats made for sweet companions in the morning as we ate our breakfast on the patio. All around, we had a wonderful stay. "
841274,35207120,2015-06-16,607836,Robert & Dawn,"Jill is a wonderful host and her apt is outstanding.  She thought of everything!  This is the best equipped rental we have ever used. It's located near several bus stops and also easy to drive and park.  We felt very comfortable and safe, and had a splendid time here. We will definitely stay here again when we return.  Thanks Jill!"
841274,36505246,2015-06-29,19839263,Rossana,"My first Airbnb experience was lovely.  The apartment was just as described on the listing.  I was delighted to arrived to a bowl of cherries and apples, cheese, crackers and fresh coffee beans after my long trip.  Very sweet walking neighborhood and much more convenient for me than having stayed downtown.  Many ammenities, plenty of towels, music, apple TV, etc, Jill thought of everything!  And, clean, clean, clean!  Loved that!  This darling community is on the Seattle airport flight path, so,  frequent airport noise is something to consider."
841274,37033295,2015-07-04,25371738,Xiaoping,Jill was very willing to help and made us feel welcome. The apartment is well stocked and the goats were a nice bonus for the kids.  The neighborhood is quiet and it is easy to get to downtown Seattle from the apartment. It was a bit cramped for our family of five - two adults and three kids. I think the apartment would be perfect for a smaller family or couple.
841274,38179630,2015-07-13,36518982,Alexander,"We had a wonderful experience at Goat Hill! We were greeted with fresh apples and some snacks which were a kind touch. We had all the amenities that we needed and the space was very clean, organized and well kept. We had access to the pretty backyard and hung out with the goats a bit too. The neighborhood is super nice and my girlfriend even went on a nice evening run feeling completely safe. Jill was easy to talk to and easy to reach. We would love to come back here again, thank you Jill. "
841274,38922032,2015-07-19,29661658,Connie,"Staying at Goat Hill was the highlight of our trip.  Jill has a cozy, clean, and comfortable space there.  The animals were quiet, and SO enjoyable.  I just wish we could have stayed longer! "
841274,39325461,2015-07-22,3374673,Julia,"My friend and me had a very nice stay at Jill's. The place is very spacious and clean and you will have everything you need for your stay. You will basically have a whole apartment for yourself including access to the backyard. The neighborhood is nice and safe. 
The kitchen is well equipped and Jill even left some fruits and jam and eggs in the fridge. We never met Jill but the communication was very easy via email.
I would totally come back and can recommend this place!"
841274,39746222,2015-07-26,1798857,Adam,"Great location. Walkable to the the bus, the light rail, and a grocery store. We never had to use our car after we parked it on the street. Fresh eggs and apples in the fridge was a pleasant surprise.  "
841274,40580609,2015-08-01,16592775,Michael,"Awesome! Went up to Seattle with my teenage boy for some NW fun; (Mariners game , Blue Angel show, rock concert and the EMP) Jill is a great hostess, unit is super clean and really comfortable, the neighborhood is beautiful and real easy to get around, the place comes with full kitchen and even a laundry room, sooooo much better than a hotel. Jill made a quick appearance when we showed up to help us get situated. After that, we had the place to ourselves. The pictures don't do it justice. Jill - you rock! Blue Skies, Michael & Cole"
841274,41925374,2015-08-10,7188653,Justin,"Place is exactly as described and was a welcome change in pace since most of my visit was spent around the space needle and highly touristy places. Felt very homey and had plenty of space for 4 guys, and the goats in the backyard are awesome! 

Would definitely consider staying here again when I come back"
841274,42826923,2015-08-16,31043417,Lauren,"Goat Hill House was and is the perfect place when visiting Seattle. It is situated in a nice area and close to convenience stores and many of the cities major attractions.If you are renting a car it took no more then 10 minutes to to most place. Upon our late arrival Jill left lights on and even some treats in the fridge which were quite yummy. The accommodations were delightful and super clean. We loved waking up each morning and saying ""Hi"" to goats Estelle and Jack-O.We are looking forward to staying here again the next time we are visiting Seattle.We highly recommend staying at Goat Hill House, it feels like a home away from home.
"
841274,43622137,2015-08-21,35165893,Tom,Our stay at Goat Hill House was just as expected. The apartment was very comfortable and well equipped and in a nice quiet safe neighbourhood. Jill left some nice treats for us and my daughter loved the goats (and the hummingbirds). 
841274,44515076,2015-08-27,28540406,Martin,"Wir haben uns im Goat Hill House sehr wohl gefühlt. Jill hat alles wunderbar für uns vorbereitet, wir haben alles gefunden was wir brauchten. Obwohl wir mit zwei Erwachsenen und drei Kindern die Wohnung maximal belegt haben, hatten wir genügend Platz.  Der schöne Garten und die ruhige Umgebung waren ein erholsamer Kontrast zur quirligen Downtown, die mit dem Bus ohne Umsteigen sehr gut erreichbar war. Wenn wir noch einmal nach Seattle kommen, würden wir uns sicher wieder für Jill's Goat Hill House entscheiden."
841274,45654739,2015-09-05,3064514,Kate,"My stay with Jill was smooth, easy, comfortable. In a word: perfect. The practical things: check in, check out, directions, parking, were all clear and I had no problems or snags at all.
The comfort things: beds (even the sofa bed!), bath, linens, the layout of the space itself: also just (email hidden)ything I could ever have needed was already in the apartment.
But here's where Jill made the stay something special: all the little details that she clearly pays so much attention to; the things that made my stay truly a vacation: healthy snacks in the fridge, coffee in the freezer, really well-stocked kitchen all meant I could just relax when I got there, leaving the worries about things like going to the grocery store for another day.
Neighborhood is great, too, with parks and public transit very close by.
Best Airbnb experience I have had, and I highly recommend it!
"
841274,47145661,2015-09-16,3095493,Ayako,"It was my first airbnb experience, and I had really great comfortable stay at Jill's place!
She prepared lots of stuff in the refrigerator, and was always helpful when I needed her help even though I haven't met her in person.
I really love the place and would definitely come back when I'll visit Seattle again :)"
841274,57832881,2015-12-29,2364675,Noah,"The house had everything that we needed. Jill thoughtfully provided all immediate appliances, dinnerwear, utensils and towels. The house is conveniently located in Mt.Baker, close to downtown and the rest of Seattle. It was a pleasure to stay there and would stay there again in the future."
8426827,48625143,2015-09-27,44535684,Edgar,"We had a wonderful stay at the Eva Rose apartment! It was in a wonderful location with the ability to walk to many restaurants, coffee shops and more. It was quiet and had everything we needed. They even had a pack n play for us to use for our 7 month old which was so nice. Jeremy was so welcoming and helpful in suggesting places to try out! They had a bottle of wine waiting for us which was a very nice touch! We were visiting to check out Ballard as a potential place to move to and this was the perfect home base to venture out from and see the area. I highly suggest this rental and we will definitely use it again in the future if we move for family/friends! Fantastic stay!!!Thanks again!
"
8426827,49681795,2015-10-05,24554683,Marjorie,"We had a great girls weekend at Jeremy's and Rachael's place. Jeremy was really responsive to our needs. The location was great...we went for a run jn the neighborhood and enjoyed the local coffee shop,  breakfast, and pizza/bar all within walking distance. The house was closer to the road than we expected, but we were pleased that the unit itself didn't have a lot of road noise. I liked that the unit had a secure exterior gate. The beds were really comfortable too!  Would definitely stay here again. "
8426827,51391687,2015-10-19,45566260,Scott,"Jeremy was the first to respond of 3-inquiries in the Seattle area.  I was initially looking specifically downtown  Seattle location but could not find available dates.

Once Amazing Ballard was booked, Jeremy was quick to confirm stay for the minimum 3-nights.    And Jeremy kept in contact to check up on us to assure we were doing okay.  My wife and daughter equally loved the space and the location...we did not want to leave!

There was some street noise being right on hustling 15th Ave., but the location was a short drive to downtown and the Rapid D-Line stop was just across the street.  We felt safe in the unit with a secured building entrance; electronic codes to the building and unit worked flawlessly...no keys necessary.

The description of the interior space was right on the mark to include hotel like linens, bedding type and kitchen was well stocked.  The décor was stylish; inviting and warm and extremely tidy.

Jeremy's recommendations on where to dine and locale of grocery stores and other services was extremely helpful.  We loved Un Bien a short walk away and the street parking was never a problem on 75th.

I would return to Ballard without hesitation as Jeremy was an A+ host.  I could not have asked for a better 1st Airbnb experience :-) "
6515046,33869756,2015-06-01,34222339,Robyn,"David was a wonderful host. He allowed his guests to come and go as needed and was very kind and welcoming. The neighborhood was convenient and just a few blocks from a nice German Pub, coffee, grocery store and food. It was not that far from Downtown Seattle. "
6515046,34356317,2015-06-07,34235942,Megan,Great stay!  Loved the private bathroom.  Beautiful deck.  I truely enjoyed my stay.  David was welcoming.  Our paths did not cross much since I was out during the days.  Easy parking in front of the building.  I will stay there again if in Seattle.
6515046,34732543,2015-06-11,1467170,Elnar,David is a very hospitable person. He let us to check-in earlier as we had a flight early in the morning. Aparts are situated in the western part of the city. It's nice and calm area and not far from the downtown. I recommend to stay at this beautiful house. The only moment is a weak wi-fi signal.
6515046,35138784,2015-06-15,28208572,Guido,"David was a great, friendly and helpful host. The accommodation was as descriped and just perfect for my stay. I had enough space, a comfortable bed, a tasty breakfast, and also got privacy when required. In addition, the West Seattle area is very safe. Therefore, I would definitively stay here again being back in Seattle and can absolutely recommend this place. Thanks a lot and take care..."
6515046,35824938,2015-06-22,11116084,Lu,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying at David's gorgeously designed penthouse apartment. david was a wonderful host, immediately making us feel at home. Unobtrusive but at all times attentive to our needs. We slept in a spacious room with en-suite bathroom and walk-in shower, but in addition to that we were graciously offered access to David's living room, kitchen and terrace areas.
Staying at David's place was a wonderful experience, one we will repeat whenever we will visit Seattle."
6515046,36414176,2015-06-28,34227283,Pamela,"
Please read previous n following comments. Is there some way we can get part or all of our money back. "
6515046,36821143,2015-07-01,36162241,Cj,"Experience was incredible! The room was perfect, and all accommodations made for a relaxing stay. Enjoyed the come and go as we please abilities, and the property itself was a dream. Thank you again! "
6515046,37177778,2015-07-05,7451996,Carol,"David's place is sleek and comfortable.  The West Seattle location isn't too far from tourist attractions, but is in a quiet neighborhood.  It is a good value for the price, too."
6515046,37694747,2015-07-09,35672145,Andy,"Really nice apartement: a lot of space, nice room and bathroom.  We truely enjoyed our stay. David was welcoming. Easy parking in front of the building possible. Good recommondations for food and places to visit included in the welcome note."
6515046,39391822,2015-07-23,34600689,Paul,Dave was there on our emailed arranged time.  He showed us our accommodations so we did not have any questions from that point.  We let him know what our in & out times would likely be.  Everything worked out just fine.  We liked the separate quarters & the walkin shower.  We would stay there again.
6515046,40917199,2015-08-03,33474235,John,"Perfect for a warm cozy place to come home to after a long day out. David was very accommodating and made sure we had enough (if not extra) for a comfortable stay. Place was beautiful. WiFi was slow when we needed it, which was rarely. Other than that, simple at its finest. *thumbs up*"
6515046,42401895,2015-08-13,35832056,Fiona,"David was a very friendly and accommodating host.  The apartment is spacious and light and clean.  The location is great, easy walk to West Seattle shops and public transport.  Would recommend this apartment to other visitors.
Fiona - Australia"
6515046,43512527,2015-08-20,33524762,Alan,Our stay was great! We had a great time exploring Seattle and coming back to a quiet and awesome room. The private bathroom was awesome. David was helpful and a great host. We loved his place and would definitely stay there again. 
6515046,44146331,2015-08-24,2496133,Nahil,"We had a lovely stay at David's!! Very comfortable and hospitable. I'd recommend staying at David's anytime you visit bc it's cozy, prefect location and very quiet! We loved it "
6515046,44920206,2015-08-30,31036958,Red,"David was very responsive to followups and was a great host. 

If you like a calm environment with very little noise, David's is the place to be. My room had pamphlets for local restaurants and public transportation as well as speakers to plug into my devices if I chose to have music. 

The photos you see are 100% what you will get. It's an absolutely beautiful home and my room had a HUGE walk in closet and very clean bathroom. There is also a large window to let in the beautiful sunset. 

If you are taking public transportation LATE NIGHT (past 12am) just be aware that buses are few and will take longer to pick you up. Some buses that drop you off directly in front of the building also stop running past a certain time (around 2:30-3am)"
6515046,45795882,2015-09-06,11601430,John,David's flat was fabulous. It was very clean and quiet. Any facility that you might need was available. His local picks were upper crust and very close to pretty much anything. Free parking was always available and close. Would definitively stay again !!!
6515046,46318269,2015-09-09,9524398,Iris & Andrew,David's place was super clean and comfortable. He gives you your space but is available by phone whenever you need him. Apartment is beautiful and is just as pictured. Location is close to a lot of restaurants and shops in West Seattle. 
6515046,46915303,2015-09-14,11915167,Chang,"David's place is amazing! This place was very comfortable to live in. His place is situated at a very convenient and safe location. It took us around 15 minutes to drive to Pike's Place, Alki Beach or Capitol Hill. There's also a lot of yummy restaurants/bakeries around the area. I would definitely come back."
6515046,47718183,2015-09-21,40608856,茜,"This is a really good apartment! Nice neigerhood, lots of good restaurants and pubs. David is a good host and keeps his place clean and comfortable. The only thing that bothered us is the wifi in here was really slow and stopped working for a while and we couldn't use the Internet. But if we visit Seattle again we will chioce his home again."
6515046,48195010,2015-09-24,8580598,Carole,"Notre séjour chez David a été très agréable, l'appartement est spacieux, moderne et propre. Le quartier est assez calme et un café pas très loin est très sympa. Plusieurs moyens pour vous rendre dans seattle Dowtown dont le taxi boat qui donne une jolie vue de la ville. Cependant il fait le dire que nous sommes pas au coeur de la ville ce qui peut être un point négatif et ça on ne pouvait pas s'en rendre compte. Nous prenions Uber pour rentrer le soir et nous en avions pour 14/16$ la course, mais honnêtement le soir nous avions la flemme de prendre les transports en commun.
Sinon David est très sympathique et encore une fois l'appartement était très confortable."
6515046,50085391,2015-10-09,31325773,Winnie,Absolutely recommend! Perfect!
6515046,50692100,2015-10-13,5809883,Renee,"We had a wonderful experience at David's place. Communication with David was easy and clear. The room was clean and comfortable and the apartment is well located in lovely West Seattle. We really enjoyed exploring this neighbourhood. However, it's easy to get downtown if need be. There were other travellers staying the second bedroom who were friendly, but we had very little interaction with them. Overall, we had a very positive stay!"
6515046,53492943,2015-11-09,7077535,Celeste,"We absolutely loved Davids place. It was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Would definitely recommend this spot."
6515046,54988892,2015-11-27,45675933,Nancy,"David's place was lovely and very centrally located for my needs.  I would highly recommend his place and would definitely stay here in the future.  The apartment is very quiet and parking was never a problem.  Thank you David for a great experience.
Nancy "
6515046,56645388,2015-12-15,43299041,Hannah,My experience here was very lovely. David is a great host. He gave me privacy while still being attentive to my needs. His modern house is also located in a great area for shopping and food. 
1786923,11332578,2014-03-30,11034607,Zhanpeng,"Melissa is a nice person , her apt is a very convenient place to study or work at UW"
1786923,13275980,2014-05-24,13834104,Scott,"The unit was very comfortable, clean, more spacious than expected, and in a great location. Melissa was a great host and always returned calls or messages in a prompt manner. I will use her again in the future."
1786923,17738326,2014-08-17,12813138,Matthew,"The place was exactly what we needed for the summer. It was small, but big enough for two or three people with the extra bed in the living room. The location in the U district is great with lots of great places to eat nearby and buses nearby for easy access to downtown Seattle."
1786923,18819601,2014-09-01,5422225,Aaron,"The apartment was very convenient for visiting Seattle over the weekend, particularly due to its location. If offered easy access to downtown and was close to some great dining on the water in nearby Fremont, though we didn't have as much time to explore the area around the university as we would have liked. Melissa was also quite accommodating of some minor adjustments to our travel plans, and we were able to reach her quite easily when we needed to make changes."
1786923,28007969,2015-03-16,20171336,David,"The location, for me, was perfect and the price was great too. It's directly behind (east of) the University Inn, so if that's the general area you want to be, this can't be beat for price. Communication with Melissa was good, and she responded promptly on my first day when the internet wasn't working. 

The place was clean and comfortable. It's simple, and I especially appreciated the cleanliness of the bathroom and shower/tub. Overall a great stay, and I was there a month.

A few things to note: 
*If you're staying long term, expect to bring your own basic supplies (toilet paper, soap, shampoo, etc.)
*I did have internet issues for 3 or the 4 weeks I was there (slow speeds and frequent disconnects) but by the last week it was up and running fine, without the aforementioned problems.
*It's a 2nd floor unit, so important to be mindful of neighbors below - I had some DVD workout videos I was going to use, but decided not to because of the potential for floor noise.
*Street parking is available, but availability depends on time of day. Mornings between 6:30-8am, and evenings seemed to be the easiest time for me to find parking, all within a block.
 
Again, my experience was positive, so if you need to be in the area, I'd recommend staying here, especially for extended stays.

1786923,49024674,2015-09-30,25634436,Li,"The apartment is cozy and spacious. Great shower, wonderful bed, nice TV. Its situated at a really good and pretty safe location, with many restaurants and cafes nearby. Internet is slow at first, but it becomes fast after Melissa set up a new modem in the apartment. I have met Melissa several times, and she is very nice and responsible. Highly recommend this apartment!"

Valerie was very gracious and welcoming, she was always available at a moments notice and eager to help out. When I arrived the kitchen was stocked with spices and basic necessities, there were brand new fresh towels and sheets. I would definitely stay here again!

"
4803403,35382018,2015-06-18,25512279,Ed,"Valerie has a lovely, clean, quiet space. We were very comfortable and found more than enough room for two. The location was perfect with easy access to groceries, restaurants etc. Valerie was a perfect host, available yet not at all hovering or intrusive. We recommend this location, space and host to anyone travelling through the Seattle area."
4803403,35931500,2015-06-23,3552675,Barbara,"Host made us feel very welcome.  She was there to meet us and went over things about the house.
The location was perfect for us as we wanted to be close to where our daughter lived.
Host was very honest about the size of the bathroom - it is small !"
4803403,36721874,2015-06-30,351397,Christine,"Val was very responsive, easy to reach and so accommodating to my weird schedule!  She provided extra goodies like fruit, coffee, water bottles which I always appreciate! Everything worked properly and was clean and as advertised. Would stay again!"
4803403,37520282,2015-07-07,36576446,Seema,"Great location and very comfortable apartment.  Valerie is a great host, she took extra effort to make our stay comfortable.  Also, this was our first time visiting Seattle and Valerie provided lot of guidance which was very helpful.  Thank you Valerie."
4803403,42269408,2015-08-12,9652606,Rachel,"Valerie's place was just as described / pictured. It is in a great neighborhood for walking, giving you easy access to Fremont & Wallingford by foot and super close to stops for the #44, 5, & 16 buses. Plus, being in the basement kept it cool during a hot streak! Valerie was nice and easy to communicate with during our 4+ week stay, so I would be happy to stay here again."
4803403,42790932,2015-08-15,40981266,Penelope,"Valerie was gracious and gave me plenty of privacy during my stay in her cozy mother-in-law apartment. It is comfortable, quiet, nicely furnished and centrally located. From there I easily walked to Green Lake, downtown Wallingford and Fremont, and downtown Ballard is only a 5-minute drive. I'll be coming back!"
4803403,43649928,2015-08-21,38125746,Ricardo,"We couldn't ask for anything more from Valerie. She provided all our essential needs and kindly offered her assistance with anything we may have needed.  The bathroom height description was accurate but being 5 foot 10, I had no issues but anyone over 6 feet tall would.  The home was perfectly located from the University district, Downtown Seattle, Ballard and Northgate which made our travel plans easier.  This place was our home away from home.  "
4803403,45801370,2015-09-06,17265163,Derek,"We really enjoyed staying here. The space was very quiet and comfortable. It has a great kitchen and fridge as well a private entrance. It is located on a quiet street but also is in walking distance of a lot of restaurants in Wallingford and Fremont . It was a great spot for exploring Seattle, I definitely would recommend it."

8340819,47019609,2015-09-14,6300429,Nicolas,"We had a really wonderful time at Suzanne’s and Dennis’s home. Suzanne and Dennis are very welcoming hosts. They made us feel right like at home (but better!) from the moment we arrived. The house is very zen, full of light and cozy. The bedroom was very nice, with an amazing spacious shower that make you feel in a natural cascade! All was perfectly clean, we had everything needed (coffee in week-end's mornings, the room has a desk, organic shower products were there too). 
The kitchen had all we needed to cook, and a space in the fridge to keep our food.
Their two dogs are adorable, very quiet. We spent 3 days in Suzanne's home during our house's hunting (we just moved from Fairbanks to Seattle) and it was the best of the four airbnb we booked in Seattle! We (a French couple in their 28-29) highly recommend this airbnb!"
8340819,55253811,2015-11-29,1281090,Marissa,"Suzanne's place is cozy and nice, best part is the rain shower! We stayed in the winter and it was quite warm and comfy. It is kind of near the street, the noise didn't bug me but in case you are a light sleeper."
4031625,19439140,2014-09-12,20814938,Gordon,"Mike and Miranda was truly exceptional hosts! Miranda went over and above in trying help find us accommodations as we book our trip to Seattle on very short notice. Very fast responses and just really wonderful people to work with. 

We absolutely fell in love with the unit. It was very clean, nicely decorated and well furnished. We really felt like home. 

I would not ever stay in a hotel ever again while in Seattle if Miranda and Mike have a place available. "
4031625,20307618,2014-09-27,16020624,Jason,"Miranda was a great host, she made sure I had everything I needed. The apartment was very clean and looked brand new. You are right next to downtown so it's conveniently located. There is a great coffee shop downstairs. I would stay here again."
4031625,20535708,2014-09-30,234523,Karen,"Miranda's correspondence and communication prior to arrival was excellent.  She gave us a very warm welcome (the bottle of champagne was a nice touch!).  She's so enthusiastic about Seattle and gave us a lot of recommendations.

The location is perfect, really easy to get to off the freeway, and very central - we walked pretty much everywhere.  The apartment is super comfortable, impeccably clean and has everything you could wish for in a rental.  

The communal roof terrace is a lovely spot too.  I would absolutely recommend this property!



"
4031625,21165828,2014-10-12,10354036,Ming,Miranda was extremely accommodating with both early checkin and late checkout.  The place is *absolutely* beautiful and was an absolute pleasure to stay at!!!!

4031625,21959331,2014-10-27,2934302,Andrea,"Apartment was exactly as pictured, perhaps a bit bigger kitchen area.
Comfy bed. Great GREAT location if you need to be at the convention center!
Loved our stay and appreciated the accommodation!
"
4031625,22475425,2014-11-07,11012730,Dan,"Mike and Miranda were very helpful getting me access to this wonderful spot.

The apartment is cozy, but more than adequate for a couple of people.  High end finishes complement the immaculate condition of the place.  

It was like it was brand new, and had never been used before.

While it is *near* the convention center, it is a fair walk, maybe 8 minutes.  This was not a big deal for me, and the mild weather in Seattle, aside from some rain, makes it a pleasant stroll.

This was my first time staying at an AirBnB listing, and I hope they are all this good."
4031625,22563619,2014-11-09,316811,Sean,"Miranda is an excellent host. Very informative, accommodating and communicative. The place was just as advertised, clean and well-located. I would highly recommend the place and renting from Miranda."

4031625,28812658,2015-03-30,3057703,Ana,"The apartment is modern, spacious, and near everything.  Eve was amazing! She not only went out of her way to explain to me how to navigate the Downtown area, but also accommodated me for a late check-in. She was very welcoming, and had nice little details that made a world of a difference. She was also very attentive to how everything was going during my stay. I would definitely recommend this apartment.  
"
4031625,29224712,2015-04-05,5036050,Charles,The apartment was as advertised and very close to everything.  Eve was great and even responded quickly when I locked myself out.  Great Deal for a few nights in Seattle.

4031625,33361293,2015-05-27,29193576,Girish,This was a perfect way to experience Seattle. Apartment was in a great location and very well maintained. Our host made checking in and out very easy.
4031625,33958972,2015-06-02,32381763,Kyle,"What an incredible experience! My wife and I had a terrific time in Seattle and a large part of that was due to our hosts Eve and Michael. 

The rental is conveniently located downtown, making our daily excursions a breeze.  It's spotlessly clean, loaded with amenities, very comfortable, and surprisingly quiet being so close to everything. There is even a cafe in the building serving delicious coffees, pastries, and (yes!) bubble teas! 

Eve and Michael provided all of the information we needed upfront - we never needed to bother them with questions. And they went above & beyond by providing us with various local discount codes, which we gratefully took advantage of. There was even a bottle of wine to welcome us. Additionally - our trip happened to be timed with a short heat wave, and our hosts graciously contacted us to ask if we needed a fan. 

If you're going to be in Seattle, you couldn't do any better than to stay here. Terrific place, amazing people - a perfect first AirBnB experience! "
4031625,34424137,2015-06-08,30988107,Evan,"Eve was a fantastic host. She had great communication prior to and throughout my stay in Seattle.

The unit was very clean and comfortable and completely functional for 2 people.  Thanks for a great first airbnb experience."
4031625,38717965,2015-07-18,10392323,Michelle,Eve was a wonderful host! She was more than happy to accommodate our early check in and made our stay really convenient.  The condo was really comfortable and felt like staying in an upscale hotel. The neighborhood is really clean and it's easy to walk everywhere. We can't wait to come back! 
4031625,39107281,2015-07-20,37125414,Avigdor,Perfect Seattle down town apparent. 
4031625,39351310,2015-07-22,38338934,Xinhua,"The location is very good, such so convinced to go anywhere. But there is no air conditioner, I feel like a hut potato.  It is good to open the window "
4031625,39561936,2015-07-24,13014250,Jared,"Eve was a great host.  She was in constant contact with me to ensure that my stay was top notch! 
The Apartment was a dream. I would definitely recommend staying here. There is a great italian restaurant a block away, and it's a 2 minute walk into downtown. "
4031625,39937145,2015-07-27,19957386,Harry,"We had a great stay! Morgan was very helpful and the apartment was very comfortable, clean and conveniently located. Just as advertised, thank you! "
4031625,42888039,2015-08-16,7717841,Eric/Stacey,Perfect location and super clean and quiet apartment. Such a great option for a couple or business trip. 
4031625,46617842,2015-09-12,27188201,Rudy And Val,Very clean and well-maintained apartment with good proximity to Convention Center and downtown. 
4031625,47881439,2015-09-21,34747460,Sophia,It was a very lovely apartment. The host was kind and professional.
4031625,49269178,2015-10-02,5664728,Richard,The host was fantastic and the apartment was stunning. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. 
4031625,49561196,2015-10-04,45408725,Eliza,"This was our first time using air b'n'b, so we were a bit nervous, but it ended up being a great experience. The place was immaculate and just as described. We were able to walk everywhere and it made a great place to come back to at the end of our days spent wandering around Seattle. We had an almost 2 year old with us and felt a little on edge about her making too much noise and bothering the neighbors, but I tend to worry about things like that. Overall, it was a fantastic experience, very helpful hosts (who eased our concerns and gave us some great suggestions of things to do with said almost 2 year old), and great location. Yummy sushi place across the street, coffee shop in the same building and easy walking to everywhere. I would stay here again. "
4031625,56273751,2015-12-11,17518914,Aj,"The apartment was small and comfortable, just what I needed for a work trip. I didn't spend much time there, but appreciated both how easy it was to check in/check out, and the thoughtful bottle of wine the company left for me. 
The apartment was pretty quiet, and has a nice shower, which is an underrated amenity. It's a short walk to Pioneer Square if you're a walker (I am).
Overall, the experience was like staying in a hotel, without the hassle of checking into a hotel. Which is good."
8670484,50717482,2015-10-13,42913310,Nicolas,"Really fun house, I felt very good during my stay, and I met nice and interesting people there."
8670484,51565180,2015-10-21,5657121,Giorge,"This is the perfect house and location to stay in while vacationing in Seattle. The area is beautiful with older mansions, trees, and views that go on forever. The house has breathtaking views itself. Everything about the house and staying here was well explained by the host via convenient emails. There were no details left out and the place was clean and tidy, which made my stay here nice, smooth and easy."
1954452,10130410,2014-02-02,2063601,Mari Beth,"I stayed at Michael and Miranda's condo for 2 months while construction was being done on my home. The condo is very nice and as represented.  They are absolutely wonderful hosts! Very responsive to needs or issues. 
The condo is in a great location! Walkable to everything on Capital Hill and downtown. Great coffee shop in the lobby of the building and a nice exercise room.
Parking was challenging but may change when the construction in the area is completed."
1954452,10636508,2014-03-01,11265857,Andrei,"I was here for an extended stay - so keep that in mind for context.  The location is great - I like Capital Hill more than Fremont or Ballard because it feels like a city.  The apartment is on the quiet side of Broadway - restaurants, shops, etc are right out the door on 12th Ave or a quick walk across the park.  The building seems newly renovated at a decent quality level.  The only negative I experienced was with internet access - it seems pretty unstable building-wide, but there are 10 coffee shops within a few blocks if you need a more reliable connection.  Michael and Miranda were incredibly responsive and pleasant - I highly recommend staying at any of their properties."
1954452,10783096,2014-03-07,4921093,Anita,"Staying at Michael and Miranda's apt. in Capitol Hill was a wonderful experience.  We are an older couple who came to Seattle for medical care for my husband.  We were amazed that M&M offered to pick us up from the airport - and we arrived on a Saturday night, at that!  The apt. is in a perfect location and is exactly as pictured.  The view is lovely, the queen size bed is very comfortable, and the coffee shop downstairs is extremely convenient with good sandwiches.  If you feel like cooking, there is everything you need to prepare simple meals in the kitchenette.  There is a farmer's market right across the park on Sunday mornings for those who like organic foods.  And we enjoyed the proximity of good coffee shops and restaurants like Odd Fellows.  Michael introduced us to the Uber app, which was extremely convenient in obtaining almost instant transportation around Seattle.  M&M are wonderful hosts and we would return in a minute to any of their apts."
1954452,10959168,2014-03-15,8420443,Julie,My friend and I stayed at Michael and Miranda's apt. for 8 days while visiting her son. The apt. was perfect and our host were very helpful and were quick to respond to all of our needs. We will definitely try to stay there on our next visit to Seattle. 
1954452,11258329,2014-03-27,4996060,Claire,"We stayed at Miranda and Michael's apartment for 11 nights while attending a conference in Seattle and had a fantastic experience. The apartment is immaculate and extremely modern, comfortable and with great amenities - it is exactly as pictured. The view is terrific and the location is unbeatable - we loved Capitol Hill! It is a quick walk to the many great bars, restaurants and shops in the area and an easy bus ride - or walk - downtown. We caught the bus all over from stops within just a block of the apartment. Miranda was wonderful to deal with - very friendly and super fast in responding to our queries. I would unhesitatingly recommend this apartment to anyone travelling to Seattle and hope to visit again someday - we didn't want to leave!

"
1954452,12398032,2014-05-01,5846389,Nadja,"My boyfriend and I stayed and Michael and Miranda's place for one month while we searched for an apartment of our own as we were completely new to Seattle - it was the perfect place! The location can't be beat, it's right on the park and walking distance to so many fun bars and restaurants (and walking distance to a great grocery store which came in really handy!). The view from the apartment was great and the rooftop was so perfect with the warmer weather, it's a great spot to hang out and on a clear day you can see the beautiful mountains. Michael and Miranda had everything we needed for our month long stay, all the kitchen basics and towels etc. If we needed anything, Miranda was immediately available to help out. We had a fantastic time and I would highly recommend this apartment for anyone visiting Seattle who wants to be in the middle of the best neighborhood in the city. "
1954452,16417788,2014-07-27,652011,Michael,"Miranda and Mike's apartment is located in a convenient and exciting part of Capitol Hill, walking distance from restaurants, theaters, bars, cafes, grocery stores, etc.   It's a small apartment, but it's comfortable and nicely decorated, and it has beautiful views of downtown Seattle.  It was great having access to a washer and dryer, and we appreciated the bottle of Prosecco that was awaiting us in the refrigerator on our arrival!"
1954452,16782545,2014-08-02,17313053,Lauren,"Great apartment in a great location! The apartment is cozy, but not claustrophobic - very bright and airy with huge windows and fabulous views, and well appointed with just about anything you might need during your stay. It's centrally located, in easy walking distance to just about anywhere we wanted to go, in a fun hip neighborhood that felt very safe, even late in the evening.  Miranda mentioned in an email it had been a hot summer so far, so I requested a fan to help circulate the air, and there was a high-powered little fan waiting for us that kept the apartment at a comfortable temperature despite the heat. Great communication throughout, and getting and dropping off the keys was a breeze (hi Bobby!). I would highly recommend both the apartment and Miranda and Mike as hosts for your stay in Seattle."
1954452,17195052,2014-08-09,11208038,Mark And Sarah,Miranda and Mike provided a great experience for our first time in Seattle. Everything was within walking distance which was ideal for us and the apartment itself was fantastic. Miranda and Mike were always quick to reply to any queries we had and were very accommodating to everything we asked for. We would throughly recommend staying at one if their places while in town. 
1954452,17526344,2014-08-13,18814453,Joan,"This was a very nice apartment convenient to public transit and an easy walk to downtown and Pike Place. The place was clean and spacious and matches the pictures shown. The washer and dryer came in handy when I had to extend my vacation trip to include a work trip. It wasn't air-conditioned, but there is a ceiling fan and a large fan to help cool the place so it wasn't uncomfortable, even when it got to 94 degrees one day. This place appears to be used solely for the purpose of airbnb, so the place felt like a hotel - just for my stuff while I'm there.

Miranda and Mike's friend Bobby met me to give me the keys and to pick up the keys.

This was a very pleasant first stay with airbnb, and based on this experience, I would stay at an airbnb again."
1954452,17778496,2014-08-17,9116315,Kate,"The place was as nice as the pictures depict.  The issue of non-air-conditioning was very much resolved by the fan.; I had no issues with temperature.  The bathroom was not pictured but was very big with an accessible shower stall.  One of the host's friends or cleaning service contacted me to coordinate coming and going and was very nice.  Bauhaus coffee up the street was an awesome place to grab coffee and work in the mornings.  Downtown is quite walk-able from the place.  All in all, I was pleased with the experience."
1954452,18024989,2014-08-20,19316319,Kunyu,"This was our first AirBnB experience, and we couldn't have asked for better!  It looks EXACTLY like it does in the pictures and was the perfect size for a couple -- very reasonably priced, too.  We stayed at the height of summer, and since there's no A/C, the fan was absolutely clutch.  Extremely conveniently located within easy walking distance to touristy sites, the light rail, and other public transportation.  It's also very close to a lot of great restaurants in the Capitol Hill that are just as tasty as places downtown and probably cheaper (I recommend Pie Bar, Marination Station, and if you have a car, definitely go to The Kingfish Cafe!).  The neighborhood is very lively, with plenty of clubs, bars, restaurants, and cafes -- just make sure you don't sleep with the windows open on a Friday or Saturday night.  A Walgreens is just a couple blocks away if you've forgotten something.

I have to give a shoutout to Bobby, the keeper of the keys who went out of his way to accommodate our early check-in and early departure.  He is the nicest guy and always prompt with responding to our texts or calls.

The bottle of champagne left for us was perfect for celebrating our engagement.  When (not if!) we return to Seattle for a visit, we'll definitely look to stay at one of Miranda and Mike's places again.  "
1954452,18187951,2014-08-23,17293502,Danielle,"Staying at Miranda and Mike's place in Capitol Hill was exactly as we expected - great location, impeccably clean, and just enough space for two.  The Pine/Pike Corridor had countless restaurants and bars, and we were able to easily walk into downtown Seattle for tourist activities. The rooftop deck is an amazing place to end the day!

Be aware that this unit does not have AC (perhaps most in Seattle do not?), which would not be a problem most weeks of the year; we happened to arrive on a very hot day, so the place was quite uncomfortable. Once it cooled down that evening, it was fine.

Overall, we would definitely stay here again."
1954452,18422617,2014-08-26,1647416,Jade,"Gorgeous, clean studio. The view was excellent!! Loved how close it was to everything I wanted to do. Miranda was responsive even when I had a dumb question late at night!"
1954452,18627199,2014-08-29,19389199,Lois,"We had a great experience. Our hosts were approachable and responsive to our questions before we arrived and while we were there. The apartment was clean and well kept, the building was quiet, and all instructions for checking in/out, accessing wi-fi, and getting around were easy to follow. It was unseasonably hot the week we stayed, so we appreciated the bottled water in the fridge when we arrived.

The location was ideal--we could catch a bus right outside to just about anywhere around Seattle, but we mostly preferred to walk to the Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill areas. There were at least 5 different local coffee shops within blocks of the apartment, and we sampled all of them! It was an easy trip from SEA-TAC, taking the light rail and then walking to the apartment. (It was mostly uphill with luggage, so some visitors might prefer catching the bus from the light rail station, or using Uber, which our hosts suggested as a cheaper alternative to a taxi.)

The only negative we experienced was the lack of air conditioning during such a hot week. The apartment wasn't advertised as air conditioned, so we weren't expecting it, but staying cool with fans and open windows, especially at night, was a challenge. From what I can tell, any other week of the year, and it wouldn't have been an issue. Our hosts kindly offered a few suggestions for making the most of the air flow we had."
1954452,18810015,2014-09-01,18530065,Kenneth,Good communication to get set up in unit.  Unit as described.  Great location for touring City via walking.  15 minutes to downtown.  Great restaurants and craft beer pubs in the immediate blocks 
1954452,18959159,2014-09-03,20042881,Fiona,"Very cozy studio apartment that comfortably fit 2 people. Nice kitchen amenities although we didn't use it much. The bed was comfortable. Miranda was very easy to work with and it was no problem getting into the apartment or checking out. The neighborhood is fun with lots of restaurants, coffeeshops, and bars within walking distance. Parking is a pain- we couldn't park outside during the day for more than 2 hours at a time, but I think this may be true of most places in Seattle. Overall I had a comfortable stay and I would stay here again. "
1954452,19321191,2014-09-10,18613061,Roger,"This was my first experience renting an airbnb apartment instead of a hotel room and I am extremely happy that I found Miranda and Mike's listing. Communicating with them was an absolute breeze.
The apartment is exactly as pictured in a newly constructed six story building with, I estimate, maybe 100 units. The apartment appears to be used exclusively as an airbnb rental and feels like a deluxe hotel room but with a full kitchen plus in unit washer and dryer. 
The location is fantastic. It is surrounded by tons of restaurants, cafés, bars, clubs and shops in the vibrant neighborhood of Capital Hill. It's about a 15 minute walk to downtown or Pikes Place. It is also located by many bus lines which was convenient since I was visiting without a car. 
The day of my arrival I was contacted by their assistant Bobby and he gave me the key. They were extremely flexible with allowing me to check in two hours early. The next morning Miranda texted me and asked if there was anything I needed, but the apartment exceeded my expectations and was furnished with everything I needed.
Check out was also very smooth. Bobby met me punctually at our arranged time and I was on my way. 
I highly recommend this airbnb unit. Not only is it an affordable alternative to a hotel, this apartment allows you the opportunity to experience Capital Hill and Seattle as a local in a hip, contemporary urban environment in a vibrant and exciting location 
I would not hesitate to rent this unit again and may even plan my next trip to Seattle based on the availability of this unit. "
1954452,19602971,2014-09-15,17194209,Dana,This place was perfect for our stay in Seattle. Everything looks exactly like the pictures. The roof top deck has an amazing view looking towards downtown. You don't even have to go up to see it since the apartment windows have just as good of a view. Perfect walking distance to downtown but you're also close to the night life and fun of Capital Hill. Miranda was sweet enough to call and check in making sure we had everything we needed. Her friend Bobby who checked us in and out was one of the nicest people we met while in the city. 
1954452,19777291,2014-09-18,17380414,Linda,"Miranda was really easy to deal with and even checked up to see if we needed anything.  Her place was lovely and very clean. Location was super... Lots of nice restaurants, bars etc. thanks for a great stay."
1954452,20417618,2014-09-29,18680223,Kim,Miranda was the best hostess you could ever want. The apartment is very clean and the building is very safe.  Miranda was always available via phone or text and would call to check if I needed anything. It was a perfect place to stay in a great location. 
1954452,20646031,2014-10-03,19144170,Jun,房子位置很好，很方便。内部空间紧凑，两个人最好，三人也可以休息。房东很热情。谢谢！
1954452,20902679,2014-10-07,7250529,Luke,"Miranda met us promptly at a coffee shop around the corner when we arrived earlier than expected. She was kind and had some great suggestions for the area. The location of this apartment couldn't have been better. The neighborhood is filled with great local bars, cafes and  restaurants.  My travel buddy and I decided to spend most of our trip around capitol hill and we loved it! I would stay here again in a heart beat! Thanks Miranda for hosting a great place like this!"
1954452,21132692,2014-10-12,17236800,Ailie,"This apartment is located in a great area. I initially considered being closer to Pike Place, but on reflection, I'm so glad that we didn't stay there – it's tourist central and this area is so much nicer with a lovely selection of places to eat and (website hidden) lovers, you will particularly enjoy The Pine Box bar, where a great selection of craft beers are housed in a former mortuary. You'd never guess the history of the building – it's more like an old dance hall. The bar is also perfect stumbling distance for the apartment, so double win!

I can also recommend Terra Plata for high quality food – it was absolutely excellent.

The apartment itself was clean, tidy and the washer and dryer came in useful, particularly after getting caught in the rain!

Miranda was great to deal with and always quick to respond before, during and after our stay. "
1954452,21342728,2014-10-15,7011939,Joe,"Very nice place, great location (Taylor's oysters around the corner is exceptional).

Miranda & Mike were great, easy hosts, as well. 

One thing to note: The floors in this building are very thin, and even ordinary morning movement will bother the downstairs neighbor. He told us his ""dishes were shaking"" and we'd barely been moving around at all. As a result, we were on tiptoes the entire stay. This was especially bad because we'd flown in from Asia and jetlag had us awake at 6:30 AM, so we pretty much didn't move until at least 9:30 and then tiptoed the rest of the day."
1954452,21514327,2014-10-19,1884425,Jeff,"Miranda was great! She was very responsive to all messages and questions we had, made sure to make sure we had anything we needed and made staying in her unit a breeze. Highly recommended!"
1954452,21688444,2014-10-21,11595791,Nadine,"This was a perfect little place to explore all that Seattle has to offer. It was in a centralized location close to many of Seattle's happenings by foot or public transport. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Even though we didn't meet Miranda or Mike in person, they were very nice and frequently checked in with us to make sure that our stay was going well. "
1954452,22061395,2014-10-29,19752129,Ben,"We were very impressed, when we arrived at this stylishly modern apartment, very close to downtown Seattle. Outside the panoramic window was a breathtaking view of the tall buildings and the busy street below. 
We made use of the well equipped kitchen with stove, large refrigerator and dishwasher. It was surprising to discover an added bonus...full sized washer and dryer in the apartment.
Very convenient location...bus to downtown right in front of the building...WONDERFUL RESTAURANTS just down the street. The best oysters in town...first rate Italian restaurant and much much more.
During our stay, we had time to explore other parts of the Capitol Hill district. It's loaded with great restaurants, interesting stores, and coffee shops. We found it refreshing to be located in this vibrant residential neighborhood.
Miranda and Mike were helpful and courteous any time we need to call them. My wife and I agree...we loved staying here and give it a RAVE REVIEW.


"
1954452,22484673,2014-11-08,16487938,Josh,"From the moment I was in Seattle, Miranda made me feel right at home. She met me with keys and showed me around - can't get better than that! 

There is nothing better than having a washing machine and dryer in a Airbnb, so thumbs up! 

The location is just perfect, couldn't have wanted anything better. Right near the Pine Box - you can walk up to Broadway or back down into Downtown (about a 10 minute walk either way). The view from the apartment is fantastic, looking straight out from the 6th floor.

I'd stay here again, no questions asked! "
1954452,23492240,2014-12-02,16278848,Jerry,"This place was absolutely everything I could have wanted. Trendy neighborhood, immaculate, comfy space, quiet building. It was just what the doctor ordered. Ideal for my little writer's retreat. "
1954452,23759794,2014-12-09,5694654,Melinda,"Miranda was great, very accommodating and willing to bend over backwards to make us comfortable. The place is nice, exactly as pictured, great location with a good view of the city. "
1954452,24872823,2015-01-03,541074,Dave,Miranda was a great host and attentive to any needs that arose.  Great location that is very convenient.  Lovely apartment in a new building.
1954452,25183980,2015-01-08,23264547,Jason,"Miranda:

Thanks for a great place.  The location was perfect for me and the amount of space was just right.  It has a great modern feel to the apartment and is within an easy mile walk of DT while also being in the middle of what feels like EVERYTHING.  Thank you for working with me to arrange additional days this month and next as I travel back for work.

"
1954452,25421698,2015-01-15,23264547,Jason,"Once again, a great stay at this property.  I'm a regular traveler to Seattle and Mike and Miranda have a number of properties that they are working with.  They went out of their way to make sure I had accommodations for all of my upcoming travel and made me feel welcome.  This is a great property and their management is spot-on."
1954452,25664447,2015-01-22,23264547,Jason,"Neighborhood is incredibly central with LOTS of local restaurants and bars within VERY easy walking distance.  It's a small one-bedroom space, but perfect for one or two people for a short stay.  "
1954452,25755668,2015-01-25,25593229,Jeannie,Perfect!! My boyfriend and I were in town looking at apartments in Capital Hill and this location was perfectly situated for that. The space was clean and had a gorgeous view. The roof deck was breathtaking and worth every penny and then some. 
1954452,25881580,2015-01-28,23264547,Jason,Once again I love the convenience of this location. The place is perfect for my regular trips. It's clean and well maintained. The hospitality upon arrival was also good. 
1954452,26012957,2015-02-01,26015716,Kim,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a weekend getaway and I couldn't have asked for a better experience! The apartment itself was so clean, and I have extremely high standards. It was also modern and had the best rooftop with a fire pit and city view. We got lucky because the apartment is in the best location. Close enough to walk to Pike Place Market and downtown but also had a very young neighborhood vibe. Super close to very ""foodie"" bars and places. I highly highly recommend.

Miranda was also a great host! Super attentive and accommodating! Check out was at 11 AM but our flight was at 5 PM and she was kind enough to let us keep our stuff in the apartment while we explored on our last day. Definitely a great host experience!"
1954452,26157660,2015-02-05,23264547,Jason,"The welcome was great as always.  What made this visit particularly impressive was that the hosts were incredibly responsive to a somewhat unusual request.  I ended up coming down with the flu during this visit and after a couple of nights of fevers, chills, and night sweats, I needed a fresh set of sheets - something unusual for a 3-night stay.  They were able to stop by before the last night so that I could remake the bad and have a very comfortable last night with my stay.  "
1954452,26280277,2015-02-08,27101804,Rafael,"First off let me start by saying this was the first time I have used airbnb. Miranda was very helpful. I really like her instructions email where she gives you an overview of your stay as well as some important details of the city. Personally i really appreciated this since i had never been to seattle so this really helped (i.e parking info, restaurants, taxis info etc....). The apartment was nothing short of awesome. Very welcoming and clean. We were greeted with a bottle of wine ( awesome) and were constantly asked if we needed anything. I would definitely recommend staying here especially for first timers. Also apartment has an unbelievable view."
1954452,26517314,2015-02-15,22800380,Jp,"What a great experience. Awesome host and an amazing place. So many great restaurants, bars and shopping in the area. Albeit the location is in Capital Hill, downtown is a short walk away. We were visiting Seattle for a concert at The Paramount Theatre which is only a three minute walk! In terms of the accommodations: Very clean. Safe (secured entry and elevator) and quite. We will be back!!

Thanks to Miranda and Wally for the restaurant recommendations and the bottle of wine. We had such a lovely time. "
1954452,27586407,2015-03-08,26951763,Sarah,"The list description was spot on. The apartment was perfect for a weekend getaway and in a really good location. This was my first trip to Seattle so based on other reviews I went with this apartment because it sounded like it was right in the middle of everything; it was! Capitol Hill has a ton of great restaurants and shops, its right next door to the Starbucks Roastery and a very short walk to Pike Place Market! If you're looking for a home away from home while you're visiting Seattle, this is the place! And the roof deck was just the cherry on top. "
1954452,28049170,2015-03-16,28780884,Kaori,"Eve was very welcoming and flexible. She kindly met us earlier than the check in time so we didn't have to carry around big luggage all day. She also gave us insider knowledge around the area including good restaurants, etc. The experience couldn't have been more comfortable and hustle free! Great area, great apartment, and great host. I totally recommend this place! "
1954452,28208197,2015-03-20,26447222,Alyssa,"We stayed in the apartment for 5 days. Overall the experience was great. We found it a little sketchy that we couldn't mention AirBNB to anyone in the building. It made it seem as if there was some under the table business going on. The Apple TV box was missing, but no big. The pictures that are shown on the listing are of an apartment with a different floor plan than the one we stayed in. Otherwise the apartment was clean, nice, and in the heart of everything. It was a safe area as we were two 21 year old girls and never felt in danger. I'd probably stay here again. "
1954452,28445419,2015-03-23,27623789,Andrei,"We had an excellent experience staying here. Would definitely stay here again. The apartment had everything we needed and a great location.

Eve was very helpful. She accommodated our early arrival time and gave us some tips on places to see.

There were even some chocolate and a bottle of wine waiting for us when we got there."
1954452,28592264,2015-03-26,19439753,Jackie,Eve was a great host. Can't recommend this property and host enough. She went way out of her way to make it an awesome trip. Very accommodating!
1954452,28871728,2015-03-31,20417100,Emily,"Great Apartment. Clean, and in a safe building. Good location 3 blocks from the convention center and about 5-10 mins from the monorail and light train. It is on the top of hill but it's Seattle everything is on hill there.  There were a bunch of really nice bars and restaurants near by.  Eve was super nice and meet us at the door and show us were everything was in the apartment. Will book it again if I get a chance to go back to Seattle. "
1954452,29141148,2015-04-04,4484533,James,"Great service from beginning to end. Eve was in contact with me via text and through airbnb tools. Key pick up was very easy and accommodating, and we greeted by a nice gift in the residence. 

this location is *prime*. within walking distance to pike's but still has a great neighborhood feel! also near a couple of great coffee roasters (starbucks and victrola), restaurants, shops, and bars. i would love to stay here on my next trip!"
1954452,29731924,2015-04-12,1186302,Eileen,"This place is a great place to stay, especially if you're going to a conference.  It's a 5 minute walk to the convention center, yet you've got good neighborhoody stuff, great restaurants and bars right outside the door.  Eve was very helpful -- check in was seamless and she gave me great tips on where to find coffee.  The photos are of a slightly different apartment, which was actually better as the bedroom is a separate room from the main space, unlike in the photos.  Everything else - furniture, etc is identical.  The down side of this place is that it's right over the freeway.  The windows are good and thick so the noise is pretty muted, but I did have a hard time sleeping.  This place was the CLEANEST place I've ever stayed.  In that way, it felt like a hotel.  The bed was very comfy. "
1954452,30286781,2015-04-20,21542146,Erik,"Great stay! I was in town for the weeknd,  but arriving early on Friday. Eve was very flexible in letting me in early. The apartment is really nice and well maintained in a safe area. The bottle of wine,  snacks,  and note were a nice and unexpected touch. Great access to downtown and Capital Hill neighborhoods,  with a ton of good bars and restaurants nearby. Public transportation is available nearby (bus),  but its not too far from other modes. Only downside is that the noise from the nearby highway is evident late at night,  but its not so loud that you can't fall asleep. Would definitely stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle."
1954452,30804353,2015-04-27,3508732,Axel,"Host was welcoming and able to accommodate a slightly earlier check-in which really helped out with out schedule.  Lots of things to do nearby. 20 minute walk to Pike's Place market, tons of good bars down Pike and Pine street."
1954452,31207925,2015-05-03,827449,Paul,"Beautiful apartment, and very responsive host!  Thank you!  Highly recommend!"
1954452,31613235,2015-05-07,11462659,Emily,"Great apartment in the PERFECT location! Eve was excellent and extremely easy to communicate with.  She had a very quick response time.  There are great restaurants, bars, grocery stores, coffee shops, etc right next to the apartment.  Everything was in walking distance and easy to get to. Eve also accommodated early check-in for us!  "
1954452,32418596,2015-05-17,26959059,Tarah,Eve and Mike truly take the time to make sure every need is attended to. Excellent communication and extremely accommodating. We will be sure to stay with them again!
1954452,32930132,2015-05-23,3576464,Anne,"We had a lovely stay in Capitol Hill. Eve was a great host, and met us right when we arrived. The location is centrally located and close to many amazing things (across the street from some of the best restaurants in the city, along with great shopping & nightlife options). The space is perfect for a couple, and accommodations were very comfortable. Plus.. Eve had great recommendations for the area and was a lovely host!"
1954452,33599012,2015-05-30,24825776,Antonio,"My experience was simply perfect. Eve was very accommodating for all my needs. The apartment is in perfect state, tidy and clean. A part from a bit of car noise coming from the street there was no noise coming from the other apartments in the building.  The location is perfect to attend a conference in the convention center or any other event downtown and the neighborhood is safe and lively."
1954452,34080267,2015-06-04,21751292,Adem,Very clean and modern apartment in an AMAZING location. Great coffee shops and restaurants on every corner. This place is also less than a mile away from the famous Pike Place Market. Check in and check out were extremely easy. Would definitely stay here again if given the opportunity!! 
1954452,34949583,2015-06-14,10750437,Susan,"Eve was super accommodating, meeting us when we arrived late! She offered a bottle of wine and was off. Location, location, location- well this place has it! View: roof top BBQ's and sunsets, windows overlooking the city ( the city is loud at night) but after the first night I didn't notice. Super chic place with everything you need and nothing you don't. "
1954452,35645272,2015-06-21,11639017,Anne,"Highly recommend!  Eve was very warm and welcoming.  She went out of her way to accommodate us with a couple of special requests (thank you Eve!)  The apartment was beautiful and had everything we needed.  Comfortable, clean and great location in Capitol Hill.  Parking is on the street in a busy commercial area so you have to pay for 2 hours at a time (by phone app) but overnight is free (8pm-8am).  Parking can be a little hard to find but Eve provided some useful tips.  Traffic noise from the streets below is pretty noticeable, esp. with the windows open (summertime), but we used the fan to provide white noise and that worked  fine for us.  Overall a great experience and we recommend this apartment very highly.    "
1954452,36145789,2015-06-25,7900395,Louie,I've been staying at Eve's properties for a while and I really like how she makes you feel welcome in each property.  I'll definitely stay at her properties over any others.
1954452,37571279,2015-07-08,14248537,Jordan,Eve was fantastic to deal with and the apartment is in an awesome location! Eve was able to accommodate a slightly earlier check in time and made everything super simple for us. One thing to note is that it can get a little hot in the apartment during the late afternoon but there is a fan to use. Overall it was a fantastic experience and would definitely stay in one of Eve and Michael's places again when we come back to Seattle. 
1954452,38608262,2015-07-17,31142369,Jackie,"Eve did a great job making me feel welcomed in the Open 1Bed n Cap Hill residence by showing me around the unit, returning the next day will clean pillow cases, and finally, leaving us with a bottle of red wine as a welcome gift. Our host even worked with us on getting an earlier check-in. 

The apartment was clean, beautifully decorated, and near great restaurants and bar within walking distance, and close to the freeways.

The only negative experience we had on Cap Hill was parking! If you're thinking about this unit, don't rent a car! You will spend a lot of time feeding the meter, driving around looking for parking, and worrying about the security of the rental car parked on the streets. 

Otherwise, this was a great place to stay to experience Seattle!
"
1954452,39449871,2015-07-23,16446149,Anja,"Eve is a great host, very accommodating, professional and prompt to respond. I loved her place- great modern, clean apartment in an amazing location. So many restaurants in a walking distance, very close to downtown. Overall would come back!"
1954452,41637524,2015-08-08,37678101,Rebecca,"Our stay in this apartment was absolutely fantastic! It was a perfect location in Seattle. We were walking minutes away from all the shopping, restaurants and pike place market. I loved staying in this area-beautiful views! It had the cutest boutique and restaurant right across the street and the Starbucks Reserve steps away from our front door. The hosts were spectacular and checked in to make sure everything was perfect. I would HIGHLY recommend this property! "
1954452,42523014,2015-08-14,25651037,Daniel,The host is super responsive and ensures you'll have an amazing stay. Very clean apartment with beautiful views.
1954452,43791784,2015-08-22,26429737,Kathleen,"Morgan was a dream to work with!  Very helpful and very accommodating.  This is a great location as it is walking distance to downtown as well as to the heart of Capital Hill. Lots of great clubs and restaurants within an half mile! Plenty of public transportation close by, which we recommend since parking is tricky and pricey.  Being right on I-5 is a plus as well, although it makes for noisy nights. Apartment is immaculate and well appointed. Would highly recommend!"
1954452,45067159,2015-08-31,23464938,Alan,"Overall this was a great listing in a great part of town, more or less everything that we asked/paid for. 

A few small issues did arise during the reservation, when we first arrived the listing had not been cleaned after the previous guest. Morgan took the time to resolve this right away and even left us a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. 

The apartment shown in the pictures is not the listing that we stayed in though we were assured this was an upgraded listing. I was happy with the replacement listing though the previous layout would have been preferable. 

All in all a nice listing for the price, just a few small hiccups along the way. "
1954452,46053291,2015-09-07,42720103,Courtney,"I loved staying here. Miranda, Morgan's friend, met to give me the keys, she was extremely friendly and left a bottle of wine with a card. I thought it was a very nice touch. The location is great, Capitol Hill is a great area, I don't think I had one bad meal and it's a relatively quick walk to anywhere you want to get in the city. I especially loved being right off of Pike Street. The apartment was clean and very comfortable to work and relax in, all the essentials were there (washer, dryer, detergent, coffee/coffee maker, etc) I would definitely stay here again, thank you for hosting us!"
1954452,47427275,2015-09-18,219542,Nisa,"Daniela had a clean, beautiful apartment and left me a bottle of wine on my bed to enjoy. She was very responsive and catered to my last minute request of needing to extend my stay. "
1954452,48754336,2015-09-28,1016036,Emma,"Check-in was one of the easiest ever. The location is perfect if you want to walk to Capitol Hill or Downtown. Also if you want to watch the dogs play in the dog park below -- that was probably the best part. The flat is small, but comfy. The photos don't do it justice -- this particular unit has a better layout than what is shown."
1954452,52939722,2015-11-02,22713093,Jenny,"Daniela was very nice and easy to work with. She kept in contact with us to make sure everything was going well. We loved the unit she gave us (actually different from this listing-it was being worked on). Good location, great views, clean and new. We would definitely come back!"
4868135,24682931,2015-01-01,7469164,Ted,Nice apartment. Next to many stores and restaurant. It is a big apartment that can fit more than six people. It is a good place to stay in Seattle for family. Autumn is nice and helpful. I will choose here again when I travel to Seattle.
4868135,26388974,2015-02-11,18767137,Jihyun,It was so comfort place to fill ordinary suburban air of Seattle. It gave us an easy access on main roads and to other districts. And hosts of the house were very kind and tried their best to take care of foreign family like us.
4868135,27762234,2015-03-11,4019761,Matt,"Autumn was a great host and always responded quickly to any questions we had. The apartment was cozy. It granted perfect access to the Wallingford neighborhood, which has great restaurants, and is in close proximity to the other great neighborhoods of Fremont and Ballard. Would definitely stay again!"
4868135,29034665,2015-04-03,25515598,Renee,"Autumn met us at the apartment. Gave us a quick run through of the area and proceeded to be reachable throughout the week if we needed anything! ( she was also very helpful and quick to respond in our weeks prior to arrival for any questions I had about the location and apartment!)
The apartment was clean and very well furnished! For the cost versus a hotel room, the appt was an obvious choice!! 
Our neighborhood was loaded with great restaurants, cute coffee shops and the best gelato shop ( fainting goat gelato) in town! 
Over all, we will be recommending the apartment ( and any of Autumns other spots) to friends and family traveling to Seattle! We will be back, and when we do- we will use this location again! "
4868135,29611365,2015-04-10,24883084,Angela,The interior is as described. Fabulous designs and feel like a 5 star hotel. The location is convenient  to numerous  restaurants and shops. 
4868135,30069843,2015-04-17,4717006,Emily,"Lovely apartment! Very clean and spacious for our two day stay. The building isn't much to look at from the outside, but the apartment itself is nicely decorated and homey. There was everything we needed -- from shampoo to decaf coffee (and regular)-- plus filters! Very warm welcome from Autumn, who is early very thoughtful about her guests. Great spot! "
4868135,30608274,2015-04-25,28318311,Robert,"This was not only our first time in Seattle, but our first time using Airbnb.  The apartment was immaculate and is just the way it looks in the photos provided.  Autumn greeted us at the apartment and answered all our questions before the trip and when checking us in.  We were in Seattle visiting colleges and doing some sight-seeing.  The apartment was centrally located to everything.  There was five of us in the apartment, but it didn't feel cramped at all.  Many great places to eat within walking distance on 45th.  Coffee, wine and drinks left by Autumn were appreciated by all.  We highly recommend this location and hope to be back again."
4868135,35233582,2015-06-16,15879816,Tracie,"The neighborhood is a great location, conveniently located to great food options. Overall this place met our needs- we were traveling with family and little ones and they needed a place to stretch out, play and watch tv in between sight seeing. The building is dated from the outside but inside the space is nicely decorated - it's a quiet spot with a modern furnishings. The kitchen is fully equipped and they even had coffee for us--- a nice touch. There's a tasty pizza spot close by and it's super close to great shopping in Fremont. Loved the convenient location! "
4868135,45358142,2015-09-01,6550278,Mark,"Autumn's colleague Reuben met us at the apartment even though we were quite late.   I'm sure he would have preferred to be in bed!

In spite of the late hour he took the time to orient us to the apartment and he even gave us some tips on places to see and some coffee shops and restaurants close by.

The apartment itself is great, the photos are accurate to the description, it is a quiet building but close to so much of what Seattle has to offer.  Kitchen is well equipped.  We had our car to get downtown but you could definitely get around fairly well with public transportation as well.  We will be back."
4868135,45847060,2015-09-06,34374075,Marisa,"Autumn greeted us when we arrived and showed us around the apartment. She is extremely hospitable and we felt immediately comfortable with the space and although we did not need any more assistance during our stay it was nice to know Autumn was just a phone call away.

We were in town for a Wedding in Fremont and the location was conveniently located between Wallingford and Fremont. Everything we needed - groceries, coffee shops, a great wine store- was within a five minute drive. 

The space was calm and cozy and the perfect ending to our busy days of wedding activities."
4868135,48873030,2015-09-29,36345971,Aastha,The host was very welcoming and polite. The neighborhood was safe as well.
3263722,16161482,2014-07-22,18006516,Myste,We had a very comfortable stay. 
3263722,16358922,2014-07-26,16718265,Becky,"The house was great for our group of 4 people. It was convenient to have QFC for groceries and some restaurants nearby. It was also pretty quick to get downtown in the morning - I think it took about 20 minutes on average during morning rush hour. 

While the general items provided are minimal (meaning for a group larger than 4 you might have a hard time making dinner with the provided cookware and bedding will be sparse) we were able to make it work well."
3263722,17282549,2014-08-10,16995104,Darren,The house is great and the host is warm and considerate. We have a very nice stay there. 
3263722,18680498,2014-08-30,6913135,Sandy,We had a pleasant stay and it suited our needs. Thank you.
3263722,28883365,2015-03-31,28134352,Jeffrey,"Good experience, would reserve again."
3263722,29030681,2015-04-02,7653961,Joan,The reservation was canceled 54 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7940358,46227104,2015-09-08,5630983,Bas,"We had a wonderful time in Mark's house. It has all you need. We loved the design, the neighborhood and our time in Seattle. Very accessible to downtown, we walked it. The neighborhood is really nice as well. Mark is welcoming, really friendly and responded very quickly to all our requests. Pictures are really accurate. We definitely recommend Mark's house! Great host!"
7563243,40550121,2015-07-31,3139827,Christine,"This was one of the coolest places I've ever stayed! My boyfriend and I sent Ted and Lisa a request to stay in their backyard yurt (essentially a permanent, circular, high-ceiling tent, meant for year-round use, fully furnished with a bathroom and kitchenette) only a few hours before we planned to arrive. They were incredibly accommodating to our last minute request, and staying in the yurt was a blast. It is luxurious (carpet, canopy bed, piano, several power outlets, microwave and mini fridge) while being extremely functionally efficient and green (the discarded sink water fills the toilet bowl). It shares a yard with Lisa and Ted's house and business office, but the space doesn't feel crowded and there are plenty of curtains if you're worried about privacy. You walk around the main house to get to the yurt so you don't have to go through the home, and the yard itself is a lovely garden. You may get woken up by neighborhood noise in the morning if you like to sleep in, as the walls of the yurt are relatively thin, but nothing out of the ordinary. Ted and Lisa were great hosts and I think this place is going to get very popular- it's extremely unique and West Seattle is a fun and convenient place to stay!"
7563243,40702409,2015-08-01,590951,Stephanie,"Ted and Lisa were incredibly kind and accommodating.  We booked their yurt with little notice and a very late night arrival into Seattle, and they communicated immediately, ensured that we had clear directions and that the path to the yurt was well lit.  
The yurt itself is beautiful and private - innovatively arranged with a luxurious bed,  a full bathroom, wardrobe, and small kitchen area, and multiple reading nooks.   It's set back in Ted and Lisa's beautiful garden, beneath an awning of grapevines and beside an outdoor table and chairs among the fruit trees and vegetable beds.  We'd stay again in a heartbeat!"
7563243,41032496,2015-08-03,39865816,Scott David,"We absolutely loved our glamping experience. The yurt was everything we hoped for and more. It was wonderfully outfitted with kitchen, bathroom and couch. It even comes with a piano and assortment of instruments to play. Bed was very comfy. There was great outdoor eating table in the garden. Hosts were wonderful to talk with and had great suggestion for best place for sunset view over Puget Sound. Highly recommended!"
7563243,41285043,2015-08-05,12402978,Ellie,"We loved staying here, and would definitely recommend it to others. Ted and Lisa were very kind and welcoming, and we could tell they are excited to be airbnb hosts. The decor of the place has a magical feel to it, and everything was clean and comfortable. We loved the eco-friendly features, such as the dual-flush toilet. It was easy to come and go, and the location was a great balance of quiet residential neighbourhood while still being within walking distance to cafes, bars/restaurants, and supermarkets. Taking the water taxi was a fun and easy way to get to downtown Seattle. Although we stayed in the summer, it did get a bit chilly in the mornings; the yurt has a fireplace, electric blanket, towel warmer rack, and sauna, but if you get cold easily you will want to bring some cozy jammies and slippers during the cooler months. Overall a great experience! We look forward to staying here again the next time we're in Seattle. "
7563243,41542065,2015-08-07,40417703,Sarah,"Ted and Lisa were incredibly welcoming to us when we arrived. Lisa made us tea and helped us get acclimated to the yurt by giving us the grand tour. 
The property is beautiful and well-represented by the description. The yurt is toward the back of the property and has lots of privacy, and is accessed through a beautiful garden. 
The neighborhood is quiet and feels safe. 

I would definitely stay here again. "
7563243,41867382,2015-08-09,39848466,Patrick,"This was my first time using airbnb and it was wonderful. The host were very friendly and helpful and the accommodations were delightful. It is close to shopping, restaurants and coffee! I will go back (if its available) on my next trip. Thanks again!"
7563243,43200197,2015-08-17,13753072,Kate,"Ted and Lisa were great to work with in arranging a last minute stay. I had guest from out of town who arrived late in the evening and they were able to accommodate our arrival and check-in. They are both very welcoming and warm.

The space was lovely and like our very own Never-Never Land. The beds were incredibly comfortable, the small stove kept us perfectly warm, and the water pressure in the shower was awesome. We were only able to stay the one night but we can't wait to come back and spend more time in this verdant city-escape. My friend was also delighted (with Lisa's permission) to sample the 'yard fruit' which included grapes, plums, and pears. It was a treat."
7563243,43326851,2015-08-18,27265559,Daniel,"Ted & Lisa's space was amazing. Charming, comfortable, unique-- this is a must stay in Seattle. Our only regret was staying for a single night. If you book this place, stay for at least two nights. Everything is as described, the neighborhood is quaint and easy to navigate through and while we didn't get to know each other well Ted and Lisa both struck me as refreshingly kind and friendly. Will definitely be back to visit this yurt. Next time I go I will stay for two nights at least and will talk to Ted and Lisa about scheduling a massage (Ted does professional massages in a business office next door to the yurt. Lisa also does hair in an adjacent office). Safe to say you won't regret booking this space! Thanks Ted and Lisa. "
7563243,43454783,2015-08-19,18516045,Debra,"Ted and Lisa were wonderful! The place is unique and just adorable. Nothing has been left to chance. It was well stocked, thoughtfully decorated and clean. The bed was very comfortable. We slept like babies :-) The neighborhood is convenient to everything. Our host gave us excellent recommendations on where to eat and the restaurants are within easy walking distance. When we left they even gave us a bag of their home grown grapes. YUMMY! We love this place. "
7563243,43598411,2015-08-20,1276458,Hilary,The yurt was a very fun experience.  It had the amenities of a small hotel room but in a unique environment.  I love West Seattle so it was a great area for me to stay.
7563243,44966584,2015-08-30,40739770,Ian,"Staying in a yurt is a unique experience.  It felt like we had entered another world when we came through the door with all the conveniences of home!  We arrived late on Friday, so did not meet Lisa until Saturday morning.  She is so friendly and made us feel immediately welcome.  The location was close to the water taxi for visiting downtown Seattle, and there are lots of places to eat close by.  We even had fresh fruit from the yard! We would love to stay here again!"
7563243,45428063,2015-09-02,4591619,Tim,"How cool! What a peaceful Oasis in this quiet part of town! We went to Salty's on Alki for dinner, one of our favorite views of Downtown Seattle. And the Staff is absolutely Excellent! The Yurt is warm, very clean and the Bed is super comfortable. Lots of Birds chirping in the evening and in the morning, did not hear any city background noise. Lisa runs a  Boutique Salon, Inner Outer Beauty, Wife is already making plans for our next stay!"
7563243,45608334,2015-09-04,29188872,Estelle,"What an amazing place to stay! The yurt was comfortable, roomy and conveniently located. It has everything  you need. :-)   There are many places to explore near by and a nice walk to the water taxi.  We will definitely be staying here again during out next visit to Seattle.  We didn't get to interact very much with Ted and Lisa as we were out exploring early in the morning and returning late at night. They made sure to touch base with us to make sure all was well and we didn't need anything.  A very, very positive experience."
7563243,46622603,2015-09-12,15393758,Anna,"The moment you get off the bridge and drive towards the yurt located in West Seattle, you know you've made the right decision in picking Your overnight destination. The area is lovely, quaint, and there are tons of places within walking distance. The water taxi which takes you directly to Pier 50 near Pikes Place, grocery stores, coffee shops, and little eateries are all within a short walk through densely green neighborhoods. The yurt itself is a perfect oasis, absolutely comfortable and large enough for my SO and I to do some morning yoga stretches on the floor. It was nice to come home to such a pretty place where you're greeted by their two cats, two beehives, and a backyard with grape vines and plants providing natural shade for the yurt. The yurt transports you to another place when you're in it- it feels whimsical and fantasy-esque with all the modern amenities. The hosts are very non-intrusive but they are great to talk with. You can feel the positive energy given off by the two and they are very kind hearted people. If we were to find ourselves in Seattle again, there is no doubt in our minds that we'd stay with Tim and Lisa. Thank you so much for making the yurt one of the most memorable parts of being in Seattle!"
7563243,47417094,2015-09-18,357736,Clare,"The yurt was an amazing experience, unlike any other air bnb! Ted and Lisa are very kind and welcoming and live in a beautiful place. All the amenities you need are available in the yurt plus games and musical instruments. You are a short walk from grocery stores and coffee shops and the water taxi is convenient to get to downtown. Would stay here again for sure! "
7563243,48197394,2015-09-24,25611210,RoseAnna,"The yurt was an enchanting, tranquil sanctuary for our Seattle experience.  The bed was comfortable and the yurt and grounds were a beautiful place to relax after exploring the city.  We highly recommend taking the water taxi, as they suggest.  A unique and easy way to get around.  Ted and Lisa were excellent hosts.  Warm and helpful.  We can't wait to come back!"
7563243,48774313,2015-09-28,12774393,Amalia,"A truly wonderful experience! Lisa and Ted have built a perfect little oasis from which it's easy to access all of Seattle. I stayed for 4 nights, and feel lucky to have come across the listing. Nestled in a magical garden, the yurt is equal parts ethereal and practical-- it's beautifully and uniquely decorated and cozy. It includes a kitchen, a small dining area inside, very comfortable bed, and every single amenity has been carefully considered-- from the heated towel rack by the shower to the copious lighting options, electrical outlets, sound system, and the backyard sauna. Lots of really nice places within walking distance, including Alki Beach. Lisa was flexible about arrival time, and welcomed me upon arrival, with lots of info and recommendations (and a really great cat). The yurt is on a quiet block and provides a nice amount of privacy without feeling too remote. I'll be recommending this place to my friends in L.A.-- it's perfect."
7563243,48973746,2015-09-29,16525073,Sarah,"What a wonderful place to stay, we felt welcome and at peace as soon as we stepped inside your yurt!  You have created such a beautiful, warm, inviting space it was hard for us to leave to venture out on the town.  Thank you so much for opening your space to us, we would love to come stay again!"
7563243,49716294,2015-10-05,45171600,Austin,Ted and Lisa were great. The Yurt had all the comforts you could want and was nicely nestled in a garden. The barrel sauna was nice and relaxing. Would highly recommend!
7563243,50303843,2015-10-11,7430855,Doug,"What a fantastic little oasis. This was just the spot for my wife and I. Everyday we were able to go out and explore all the fun that Seattle could throw at us and every evening, we were able to come back to the yurt and totally decompress. 
The yurt had such a great, eclectic atmosphere, from musical instruments gathered near the entryway to wall art featuring tribal masks, boomerangs, and wooden Chinese swords. It was a cozy, inviting place to rest and on one particularly rainy day, our shelter in the storm for reading, napping, and stretching out near the heater. 
All the amenities exceeded our expectations. The bed, soft, warm, and with plenty of curtains was hard to leave each morning. The shower had great water pressure. The kitchen is tiny but plenty glassware, utensils, and a big enough mini fridge to fit a few groceries. 
The outdoor area is wonderful. The walk to the yurt and the backyard are lush and fragrant. There is a nice outdoor table for having a cup of coffee and a sauna if you want to loosen some knots from a day of walking or hiking.
The neighborhood is pretty quite for a city, though you do get to hear the occasional boat horn. There are some spectacular houses, especially as you walk north toward the point of West Seattle and the water taxi on the east bank gets you to downtown in about 15 minutes. It's also very easy to navigate as you leave the neighborhood, whether you want to head up to other areas in the city or out east to try your hand at hiking, which is breathtaking. 
Our only regret is that we didn't run in to Ted and Lisa as they were on a trip of their own. Maybe we'll catch them if we're ever back in the area!"
7563243,51955870,2015-10-25,3818838,Rae & Travis,Very welcoming hosts and a wonderful yurt! We'd never said in one and loved it! The bed was so comfortable! I wondered if the stove heating would be enough but it was very comfortable in the yurt. Ted and Lisa were both very nice and made us feel comfortable! Convenient to downtown and easy to find parking in front of the house. If we're ever back in the area I hope the yurt will be available! Highly recommend!
7563243,53440349,2015-11-08,2789998,Lizzie,"We had a fabulous time in this yurt, very highly recommended! Lisa was very helpful, showing me how everything works but actually it was all very simple. The yurt is absolutely beautiful and lying in the canopy bed listening to the rain on the roof was unbelievably relaxing. We enjoyed the sauna too, very convenient and easy to use! 

West Seattle is also a great location, not far from alki beach with it's gorgeous views and plenty of places to grab a drink or a bite to eat.

Very highly recommended!"
7563243,54388098,2015-11-19,16400116,Jason,We arrived at midnight and Ted was alert and attentive. A truly mystical place and well worth a winter escape. Best unusual offering in the Seattle area. Cozy and spacious. Uber-able or walk-ably close to local interests.
7563243,57018958,2015-12-21,10152461,Ben,"Three of us stayed in Ted and Lisa's yurt for three nights in December of 2015. We found it to be an extremely unique and memorable airbnb experience. The yurt was very comfortable, warm and cozy. The neighborhood is quiet yet trendy, filled with cool coffee shops, restaurants and yoga studios. We enjoyed our trip to Seattle very much!"
7563243,57271624,2015-12-23,29344215,Tony,Had a great time exploring around west Seattle! This yurt is quite awesome and want for nothing!
6316917,32659324,2015-05-19,21504491,Carlos,I needed a place for my last night in Seattle and Sid came through! His place was a home away from home and convenient to everything in Belltown! He made me feel very welcomed and his response time to my questions was amazing! I will definitely staying here again when I come back! Thanks again man!
6316917,32722677,2015-05-20,16063597,Darryl,"Sid, in one word.....FANTASTIC.  Everything was simple and to the letter.  Very clean and convenient.  Check in and checkout process seamless.  Unit was spot on and as described.  Great location and a super great host.  Will book again in the very near future.  "
6316917,32923908,2015-05-23,12224365,Kyle,"Spectacular location! Check-in went very smoothly and the apartment is new, clean, and minimalist. Sid was always quick to respond to call or text as well. Conveniently between Seattle Center and Pike's place, either is less than a 15 min walk away. Would definitely stay again!"
6316917,33461983,2015-05-28,2326753,Cathy,Sid was so accommodating and helpful and the place was beautiful. Great location too. Within walking distance of so much that we wanted to do. Take advantage of the rooftop if you can. It was a nice ending to our stay to grab some local brews and go up there to watch the sun set over the mountains.
6316917,33848422,2015-06-01,3769572,Jason,Excellent apartment in the heart of Seattle!  Sid was a great host and accommodating to any issues that arose.  We would highly recommend this place to any future travelers.
6316917,35138354,2015-06-15,18020567,Lindsay,Great spot! The place was spotless and perfect for my extended weekend trip. The location couldn't be beat and the apartment had anything I could ask for. Would definitely stay again. Thank you Sid!
6316917,35405891,2015-06-18,3540599,Ian,"Sid was great. Very fast responses to my questions. Place was clean, great location, and good extra amenities like apple TV with Netflix.  Extra pillows and sheets were available.  Sid even let us leave our bags at the place since our flight wasn't till 4.  All in all great experience."
6316917,35564892,2015-06-20,32935387,Nathan,"This apartment was in a wonderful location. Just as advertised it was extremely close to many of the iconic Seattle landmarks. The host was very accomodating, and the apartment was quite comfortable. I would definitely try to stay at this location for any further trips to Seattle. "
6316917,36423013,2015-06-28,34788677,Kierstin,Welcoming us and being flexible. The listing was accurate. 
6316917,37579035,2015-07-08,34872964,Greg,"The apartment is exactly as described. It's a clean, comfortable apartment in a cool newer looking building. The location is great if you want to stay in Belltown. Everything in the area is walkable. There is convenient parking available inside the building. Note: there isn't any A/C, which is common for Seattle, but Sid provides a couple of nice fans which kept the place cool. Only hiccup involved someone else parking on my assigned space - no prob though as Sid immediately responded and got me taken care of within minutes. All in all, we had a fantastic time in a great apartment. Sid was a wonderful host and we will certainly keep him in mind the next time we visit Seattle. "
6316917,37757063,2015-07-10,8655884,Janelle,"Sid was a great host! He responded quickly via e-mail and even text if needed. Instructions were clear and simple. The apartment was exactly as it was described and was very clean, which is a big thing for me. The roof top facility was a great amenity that we wished we took more advantage of. It had a great view, a fire pit, and grill. The neighborhood was hip with plenty of shops and restaurants on the same street as the apartment complex. If you don't mind walking, it's about a 15-20 min walk to Pike's place or a 3 minute drive. We would definitely stay here again. Thank you Sid!"
6316917,38125557,2015-07-13,18765528,Kristin,"Pros:  Location can't be beat.  Walking distance to the Public Market, Space Needle, and all the shopping and restaurants you could ask for. It was a totally adequate living space with all the necessities, and the lobby of the building was very cool (ping pong, arcade games).  It was nice to have a washer and dryer available.  The best part was definitely the beautiful rooftop terrace with gorgeous views of the city and sound.  Good wifi.

Cons:  I'm being slightly harsher in my critique as it was as expensive as the Westin and being run as a business (I'd feel differently if it was someone's home or a steal of a deal), but there were some issues.  The linens smelled very bad and we had to rewash the sheets and towels.  The location is super central, but its also very loud at night, and as there's only one tiny window at the far end of the apartment for cooling, it was either listen to partying all night or endure the stuffy heat (we were there in July during a bit of a heat wave). Sid made fans available though which mercifully helped drown out some noise.  Again, my bar was high as it was being advertised as luxury, but the sheets were as cheap as they come and my back was sore in the morning from the mattress.  "
6316917,38362263,2015-07-14,38284962,Nancy,"Sid was very enthusiastic toward our anticipated arrival.  Superb location in the heart of Belltown and downtown Seattle energy, walking distance to trendy restaurants and night spots.  Condo complex is newer, with a contemporary feel.  Our 4th floor unit was very clean and nicely appointed.  I was pleased that there was not alot of clutter of owner's personal property around as I've seen in other rentals.  I would definitely recommend this condo and would gladly stay here again!    "
6316917,39287000,2015-07-22,25602148,Diana,"This place is in the perfect location! It was exactly as described, clean and convenient. I enjoyed my stay so much in Seattle, I am already looking into planning a second visit. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle, especially couples."
6316917,40910897,2015-08-03,6991372,Viviette,"Location Location (email hidden)e apartment had a great location - central to all of the sights including museums, Space Needle, Pikes Market and downtown shopping. It is surprisingly quiet given the fact that it is in the center of the action. The washer and dryer option was great for our weekly stay!"
6316917,41346748,2015-08-07,31466385,Neal J.,Awesome location and everything we needed to explore Seattle for a few days. Sid was friendly and helpful and accommodating of out schedule when it changed at the last minute.
6316917,42838693,2015-08-16,21789636,Nadia,Great stay here. It was super easy to get into the apartment with Sids instructions. He was available via text to answer any questions I had. The location was awesome- just steps away from bars and restaurants. The apartment was clean and the bed was super comfy. One con was that it didn't have AC but it was only warm one night we were there and we slept comfortably with the fans that were provided. I would definitely recommend this place!
6316917,43243072,2015-08-18,31175865,Kat,"He was available by phone
Great neighborhood but some aggressive panhandling "
6316917,43596832,2015-08-20,24949788,Dean,Place was fine. I wouldn't call it luxurious. No decoration. Poor ventilation. Kinda Spartan.  Good communications and great location. Lot of homeless on streets in area at night. 
6316917,44108789,2015-08-24,24279242,Lesley,"Perfect location, wonderful places to eat. Sid let us drop our luggage off early until our room, he was very easy to communicate  with. The rooftop patio is very relaxing and great view. Would stay again with Sid."
6316917,44497996,2015-08-26,27003177,Stephen,"Sid's apartment is in a great location.  Easy to get to from mass transit.  Centrally located.  Plenty of restaurants & bars nearby.

The apartment was simple, comfortable, & clean.  It had everything I needed. I'd highly recommended it."
6316917,45937798,2015-09-07,32796298,Steven,"Sid was accommodating and always responded to us quickly.  He let us drop our luggage off a little early which was helpful. Check-in went smoothly.
The apartment is centrally located and within walking distance to many areas of interest in the city such as Pikes Place Market, Seattle Center and Pioneer Square. There are lots of restaurants close by as well, including Macrina's Bakery, a great spot for breakfast. However there are lots of homeless people walking around the area.
The apartment is modern, spacious and clean. But we didn't find it especially user friendly. The bedroom is tiny and windowless with the bed and a floor lamp being the only furniture. There are no tables or any other surfaces to put anything on in the room. The closet is large but if you are the type of traveler who likes to unpack there is only room for hanging clothes. And if you want to live out of your suitcase, there is not enough room to lay it down and open it in the bedroom so it has to go in the kitchen/living area--not convenient at all. The addition of shelves in the closet or putting a dresser in the closet as well as a bedside table would be a big improvement. The kitchen is nice with dishes, silverware and some glasses, pots/pans and even a fully stocked spice rack if you want to cook. But there is no microwave, which was the one appliance that we wanted and would seem to be the most useful appliance for travelers. There is one in the lobby lounge but again, not convenient going back and forth. The addition of a small microwave in the kitchen is another suggestion.
One of the nicest features of this place is the rooftop area which has a wonderful view of the water and mountains in the distance as well as plenty of tables/chairs, a fire pit and a grill. If the weather is nice when you are here, I would recommend taking advantage of that area."
6316917,46869303,2015-09-14,34692668,Michele,"SID was a great host.  He was friendly, professional and very helpful in answering any questions I had throughout our stay. The apartment was exactly as described and was in an excellent location.  I would definitely recommend staying here and i would certainly book again if I were in the area.  "
6316917,47468508,2015-09-19,15210844,Zoe,"Sid's apartment was in a great location, tidy, modern and light. Highly recommend for a place stay in the city. "
6316917,47673434,2015-09-21,36825426,Michelle,"Perfect location for a walking experience in downtown Seattle. Apartment was very clean, and looked great!  Sid was great to work with and made our stay easy.  Overall, it was a great respite in a very active city.  I would absolutely book this apartment again!"
6316917,49198674,2015-10-01,2563096,Vivek,"This is a great 4th floor apartment in a nice lively part of town with a grocery store close by as well as a bunch of restaurants. 

I had one small issue with the apartment - the lack of a microwave oven. (The apartment building does have a microwave on the ground floor that is used by all the building residents.) "
6316917,49425789,2015-10-04,17584151,Raffi,Sid is an awesome host with a great condo in Belltown! He was incredibly easy to communicate with and VERY flexible interns of early luggage drop off and holding. I greatly appreciate him being so accommodating and making our stay in Seattle perfect! I will definitely stay with him again and recommend his great home to others who visit. 
6316917,49847554,2015-10-06,20709343,Rosie,"Had a very smooth and relaxing stay at Sid's place! He was very helpful and informative with an earlier check-in so that we could drop our luggage off. The entire process was easy and quick. The apartment was clean and comfortable in a very convenient location in Belltown (but on a nicer street, Belltown can be a bit sketchy in some parts). My boyfriend and I were in town for the Seahawks game (Go Hawks!!) so it was the perfect spot for us to crash for the night. Building was very modern and nice, bed was comfortable, I will probably try and stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle!"
6316917,50172038,2015-10-10,14471821,Bill,"The apartment was really nice. Everything seemed new. Great location. All bedding, towels and kitchen supplies are available. 

Sid was easy to work with. The apartment was just what we were looking for as a place to land while we explored Seattle."
6316917,52147303,2015-10-26,19993212,Yang,Very good stay. Sid was super responsive on the phone or via messaging. 
6316917,52748792,2015-11-01,46430359,William,Check in was seamless and the apartment was fantastic.  The location was perfect.  We had  breakfast at the Buiscuit Bitch.  High Tea at the Edgewater and dinner show at Tula's.  Lots to do.  Lots to enjoy.  Thanks.
6316917,53069824,2015-11-04,27613380,Niki,Sid was a great host! Easy to communicate with and his place is perfect. Such a perfect location!
6316917,53403403,2015-11-08,44082938,Mark,"Sid's home was as advertised - clean, beautiful and the location was spot on. On top of that, Sid was responsive, accommodating and made us feel at home.  I can't stress enough how spectacular the home was!  The rooftop offered amazing views and there was endless above average food options. We were able to walk to the aquarium as well as Pike Place market. Highly recommended!  "
6316917,53848714,2015-11-13,7306521,Matthew,"Had a great time staying at Sid's place, it was an amazing location with a restaurant/brewery on the ground floor and coffee shop around the corner. Sid's place was warm, clean, and welcoming. Thanks!"
6316917,54030787,2015-11-15,47909642,Edward,We had a great experience.  Sid made the process of checking in and out and using the parking space very easy.  Apartment was spotless and modern. The high speed internet was easy to connect to.    Bed was comfortable.  Location in Belltown was easy walking distance to many attractions. Modern exercise room had plenty of equipment.
6411259,34468803,2015-06-08,21384828,Brett,"I arrived late in the night, my host made sure there was adequate light to find the private entrance, and open the door.  The spacious room was so warm and welcoming, and best of all very clean.  There was a large comfortable bed, along with a couch and LCD TV.  The bathroom was large and open as well. I really enjoyed this home and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay.  It was close to Bus route downtown, which only took about 25min.  Beautiful lake within walking distance.  Thank you again for an amazing stay."
6411259,34724542,2015-06-11,33785345,Geert,"Bij aankomst was niemand aanwezig. Via een sms bericht van Airbnb kregen wij een afgebroken bericht, welke een miscommunicatie veroorzaakte.

6411259,35429934,2015-06-18,35649635,Jessie,"Jenna was a fantastically accommodating host! After arriving  much earlier in the day then originally planed  Jenna let us check in and drop our stuff off a few hours early. The space itself was great to, everything was clean and well cared for. The bed was really comfortable, and the shower worked well. Overall one of the best airbnb places since coming to Seattle!
"
6411259,35684971,2015-06-21,33866235,Chris,"The space was very nice and in an excellent location. The room was spacious and comfortable. The house itself was sort of loud, but staying with Jenna was a very positive experience!"
6411259,36031310,2015-06-24,34076435,Erin,Jenna's space was wonderful.  The bed was very comfortable and there was a nice size bathroom.  The E line rapid ride stop was just a couple blocks away and made it easy to get there and back downtown.  Jenna made me feel welcome and was happy to answer any questions!  
6411259,36200972,2015-06-26,34324202,Robin,"Great place with private entry! Jenna makes it very easy to figure out how to get inside and where to park, etc. Perfect place for our one night stay! We walked down to Green Lake, it's in such an awesome location! "
6411259,36691449,2015-06-30,19754914,Ryan,"This place was awesome. They have a great gig going on, private big downstairs, beautiful home, parking was a breeze, and it is right by the Zagat rated Beths Cafe. Thank you for the amazing stay, would definitely recommend. "
6411259,37476940,2015-07-07,34319503,Amy,"I booked this place for my dad, who came to visit for 5 days. The house and neighborhood are adorable. Great location, quiet, and clean. Plenty of street parking and easy access to 99 and other major thoroughfares. The room itself was spacious and well furnished, but lacked some basic necessities (for example, adequate bath towels, soap).  The space has really great potential, but we felt it lacked some of the details for a comfortable stay. Jenna was really nice and very receptive to feedback, which was greatly appreciated.  "
6411259,37791261,2015-07-10,1971395,Sean,"This place felt like a cozy hotel. It's basically a separately basement studio. It was safe, secure, and Jenna was very accommodating. We loved it. "
6411259,39193253,2015-07-21,26309107,Tony,"A wonderful experience was had for a first time visit to Seattle and it was due in large part to this Air BNB. Great neighborhood and easy access to downtown and great local food, coffee and Green Lake! Budget friendly and a super host! "
6411259,39783641,2015-07-26,31783082,Kailey,"Beautiful home, amazing neighbourhood! Super easy to use transit and access the city. We would gladly stay here again! "

The room and bathroom were both big.  The bed was comfy.  the neighborhood was pleasant, and well located.  Few blocks to the #5 bus and other transportation.  Wonderful Green Lake is just down the hill and a fun place to visit."
6411259,41109463,2015-08-04,17020442,Gemma,"My boyfriend and I were super pleased with our stay at Jenna's place. The room was clean and accurate to the pictures. The neighborhood felt really safe and when we met Jenna, she gave us great advice on public transportation, things in the area, and local tourist attractions. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!"
6411259,41487450,2015-08-07,23195005,Kim,We met Jenna as we were going out after we checked in.  She was friendly and made sure we had contact info in case we needed her or had questions.  The location was easy to find and the rooms were large and just as described.  Nice comfortable bed with two pillows for each person and everything was very clean.  We would definitely stay with Jenna again on our trips to Seattle.  
6411259,41773521,2015-08-09,2573668,Kristin,"We had a nice, but busy weekend in Seattle, and enjoyed our stay with Jenna. We were glad to meet our fun and friendly hosts before they left for the weekend. Their neighborhood is lovely and we went for a quick run around Green Lake upon our arrival. Jenna's place was perfect for us as it was within walking distance of our friends who got married that weekend."
6411259,42465556,2015-08-13,10955402,Nina,"We had a great stay at Jenna's. We especially loved the location--quiet, but near lots of great cafes and restaurants, an easy bus ride to downtown, and walking distance to Green Lake. Our paths didn't cross with Jenna during our stay but she was a very responsive host. Overall, a great stay and would definitely stay there again! "
6411259,43641768,2015-08-21,32782995,Violeta,"I really enjoyed my stay here.

The house is quite nice. The room access is outside of the house so you have total independence from the hosts, which is very nice if you come late at night. The entrance is not finished, and it was a bit dirty, but the room and toilet were completely fine. Very homely room with cosy carpet and bed. The bed is one of this super soft mattresses that can be a problem for some people. For me it was the comfiest bed ever and I slept very well, but for my partner wasn't comfortable at all and he had to sleep on the floor sometimes, or he would have terrible back pain.

The neighbourhood was very quiet but with shops and restaurants nearby (including a 24h cafe, which comes handy). It's also just 30min from Downtown and there are frequent buses taking you there (5 and E). Taking into account the prices of staying downtown and the accessibility of this house, I really recommend staying here!

Jenna is also very nice, and, although we didn't see her at all, she made sure we had anything we needed.

Summary: very recommendable staying :-D"
6411259,44438254,2015-08-26,38704845,Gilbert,"Great place to stay, great neighborhood as well. The room and bathroom are quite large and there is easy access to the bus and lots of little restaurants as well! "
6411259,45226872,2015-08-31,17332606,Heather,"Exactly as pictured. Great neighborhood, close to lake, grocery and main access roads. Plenty of street parking. The bed was VERY comfortable.  Nice double headed shower! It is a basement room, so some overhead noises are to be expected. Thanks for being available for our last minute booking. You were a great and responsive host."
6411259,46298749,2015-09-09,40648943,Antoinette,Great little neighborhood with restaurants close by. Jenna was very accommodating. Nice room and area exactly as pictured. 
6411259,46736078,2015-09-13,36364597,Samantha,"We greatly enjoyed our stay at Jenna's home! The suite was very private and cozy and in a great area, close to UW, a beautiful park, and great restaurants.  Highly recommended! "
6411259,47305517,2015-09-17,24399487,Don,Great location in a cute neighborhood and near good restaurants. I liked the fact that guests have their own private entrance.
6411259,48777912,2015-09-28,43824526,Mattie,"I loved living in our cute private suite!! THIS ROOM WAS PERFECT. Exactly as described and pictured! Such a perfect amount of space for my boyfriend and me. The neighborhood is so cute, so much nature around and so many beautiful flowers and trees. It was also in close proximity to everything. I loved everything about staying here. 10/10 would recommend and next time we come back to Seattle if we used air bnb we would totally stay here again. A wonderful experience :) Jenna was a lovely host- we stayed in contact over email/text and she was very helpful and checks in with you and you can let her know if you need anything! "
6411259,51205993,2015-10-18,39261992,Alison,"I loved the neighborhood, which was charming and near Greenlake and Phinney Ridge cafes and shops.   I also appreciated the artistic and thoughtful design/color scheme of the room.  The bed was comfortable and the place was cozy and reasonably clean.  The hostess was friendly and helpful."
6411259,51676358,2015-10-22,46714622,Pamela,"We found this suite to be clean, comfortable and convenient!  It was our first airbnb experience and we will do it again.  Jenna was very responsive to our questions.  We appreciated the private entrance.  It is a very nice home in a nice neighborhood within walking distance of lots of shops and restaurants."
6411259,51981756,2015-10-25,3593103,Kallie,Jenna was a very welcoming host. I particularly appreciated the separate entrance and privacy this place offered.
6411259,52794787,2015-11-01,34590053,Kieran,"Great room! It's super comfortable and the shower has two shower heads! The neighborhood is nice; it's super close to some nice coffee shops and restaurants. We only met Jenna briefly, but she was very friendly and helpful. 10/10"
6411259,53499522,2015-11-09,1010034,Rocio,"I really enjoyed the privacy of this listing. You have your own entrance and bathroom. The neighborhood is great; it has a more residential and homey feeling while still being close to shops and bus lines to downtown. Jenna was very timely with replies, and she helped me out quickly when I had a problem. I really appreciated it! As a single female traveling alone, my main concern is always safety, and I felt very safe in this listing. Lastly, while I didn't travel with a car, there always seemed to be lots of parking on the street available. So that's a plus if you do travel with a car! "
6411259,54171063,2015-11-16,27459,Christopher,"While we didn't end up meeting Jenna we had a fantastic stay! Great home base to explore the city from. The room was comfortable, private and clean. Great neighborhood, too--we walked to brunch twice. Highly recommended! "
6411259,56170188,2015-12-09,48895136,Heather,Jenna and her home were very lovely. I had a clean room and a lot of much appreciated privacy! (:
6411259,56818148,2015-12-18,7485789,Julian,"Nice, clean place. Convenient for late arrivals and a great value."
8942678,55432657,2015-12-01,2431407,Amy,"The house was perfect! We were visiting the area for Thanksgiving with family as well as a bit of sightseeing. Susanna was very accommodating and easy to communicate with, and everything went very smoothly. She even provided a wonderful gift basket (with a bottle of wine and snacks/treats) and toiletries along with a list of suggestions of what to see/eat in the neighborhood. 

As for the house, it was simply incredible! It is a historic Queen Anne home that was even more beautiful in person than the Airbnb photos suggest, and it very comfortably accommodated our group of seven people. In terms of location, the house is steps away from many great Queen Anne Hill restaurants and walking distance from many attractions in Seattle (e.g., Pike Place Market, Seattle Center, downtown Seattle). It is also a short drive/bus ride from Green Lake, the University District, and Capital Hill.

Overall, a fantastic stay!"
7013085,36843239,2015-07-01,11580437,Viwat,it's very nice to stay at dane and alanna's house. everything was perfect  when we walked in to the house. i would  recommend  it to my friends  for sure :)
7013085,37607570,2015-07-08,33011673,Alan,"The home itself was nice and very clean, had everything we needed for a good stay. The host was friendly and made himself available but also let us have our privacy. The neighborhood was very noisy, which made it a bit hard to sleep after 7am.  "
7013085,37800289,2015-07-10,9246920,Josh,"The house is exactly as described, and I would love it in almost any other setting. Unfortunately, it is located in one of the worst neighborhoods in Seattle. I did not research this before booking, so it is my fault. It is one house over from the MLK, so you hear all of that traffic, plus the light rail train. Also, beware in the summer, as there is no air conditioning (again, my fault for not asking), and visiting during a 90+ degree heat wave was miserable. On my first night, I tried to cancel for my second day, but the owners were not flexible and wouldn't give me a refund, so I sweated it out. (they did give me a fan, which helped some) Also, during my last night, there was a drive by shooting two small blocks away. Since I had to have my windows open, I heard all 15 shots, and the cacophony of sirens that soon followed, and lasted well past 2am... Again, great little house, terrible neighborhood."
7013085,38046110,2015-07-12,37270974,Garrett,"The place was great and Dane and Alanna were very helpful. Before we even arrived they were keeping in touch with us and letting us know information about how to get around downtown on the light rail, since we were curious about getting around downtown, and just seem to be very caring people with plenty hospitality. We personally loved all the decorations around the house. It is decorated very fun and open minded with something new and different around every corner.  This place is perfect, because it's not far away from downtown at all, but is at a very discounted price in comparison to the downtown places we looked at. The light rail system is literally a couple minute walk from the house and got us to Safeco field in about 15 minutes without having to pay ridiculous parking prices. The place was very clean and good sized and I did not seem to have any negative issues whatsoever. Also, I am not from the area, but this area, from all we have seen, is far from the bad neighborhood that I had saw someone else post about. Very positive experience and definitely would recommend to anyone wanting to visit Seattle. "
7013085,38185266,2015-07-13,25680406,Jaber & Kalai,"Dane and Alanna hosted us for one night. We have to say that we were positively impressed! 
Communication before during and after our stay was very good. They gave us the house key, left a welcome letter and little notes to help us feel at home. The house was well furnished. Dane and Alanna are very meticulous hosts, they left a lot of useful goodies for clumsy travelers like us ( from extra toothbrushes to popsicles ). The house is spacious, well decorated, clean and organized. We actually spent a fair amount of time looking at all their collectibles.
Dane was kind enough to let us leave our backpacks at home (after we officially left the house ) so we didn't have to drag them around the city. He also offered to bring them to the train station on our way to the airport. 
A previous host mentioned that the house ""is located in one of the worst neighborhoods in Seattle"". We just want to say that the area was very quiet, people were nice to us and we felt safe walking around in the neighborhood (even late at night)."
7013085,38329949,2015-07-14,37360078,Bruce,"Both hosts were there to welcome us and are warm and friendly people. The listing was exactly as described, with slightly quirky, yet comfortable, furnishings. This is a quiet residential neighborhood. I would recommend this highly. My only reservation is not about either our hosts or the home, but about the challenge of finding a restaurant close by that's open on a Monday."
7013085,38557031,2015-07-16,36488564,Ilse,"Dane was an awesome host. We got into Seattle later than thought we would (2 hours later) and he still gave us a tour of the house! We asked if he knew where a store that was open 24 hours near by since we got in so late and he gave us addresses. Always kept in touch to see if we needed anything and he also left travel/tourist brochures on the table. We asked to meet their dog and he is so adorable, he was no problem at all. I would definitely recommend staying here! "
7013085,38756752,2015-07-18,16476693,Kelly,"Great place to stay!  Clean, roomy, complete with full kitchen and washer n dryer. Kid-friendly perks: otter pops in the freezer and Mexican jumping beans. :) Decor is interesting, fun to explore. Hosts were friendly, accommodating, and available. House is close to I-5, the airport, and public transportation.  Recommend!"
7013085,38894073,2015-07-19,35295431,Mandy,"Very special designed house. It's definitely a amazing experience staying here. The host, Dane decorated the house with lots of collections, boys room and girls room are nice. Dane is a super nice host!! The living room and kitchen are so large, you feel like home all the time! Recommended for group of ppl to come!"
7013085,39327401,2015-07-22,34665208,Bradley,"Dane gave us a tour even though we got in pretty late. The house was exactly as described/pictured. A lot of nice touches in the details to make everything feel really homey. We had a very comfortable stay and Dane was always gracious enough to make sure we had what we needed. 

The neighborhood has a lot of really great markets and Ethiopian/Vietnamese restaurants, and is very conveniently located for both downtown and nearby Rainier Ave, home to quite a few lovely restaurants and smaller shops. You have to try Empire Espresso.

I would highly recommend staying here!"
7013085,39563765,2015-07-24,13868200,Chris,"We arrived around 1:30 AM, but Dane was still willing to check us in and show us the place at that time. He was very nice and thoughtful, checking in on us during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed and letting us borrow some things that we had forgotten to bring. The property was as advertised--interestingly decorated and clean! As other reviews stated, the neighborhood isn't the greatest. I wouldn't choose to walk from the light rail station back to the house when it's dark, even if it's a mere 10 minutes, but I was fine doing it anyways. That said, it is a convenient location to the light rail if you're looking for a close place to the airport and an easy way to downtown. Hassle-free stay with everything we needed!"
7013085,39802734,2015-07-26,36973738,Martin,The house and neighbourhood was clean and quite. It was exactly as described. The close proximity to the Light Rail system was an extra bonus....very convenient access to Safeco Field.
7013085,40356567,2015-07-30,28908212,Jeff,"Dane and Alanna's place served our family very well. And they were the perfect kind of host; showed us what we needed to know, then faded out of view. The whole space is bigger than it looks in the photos, which allowed us to entertain additional family guests one evening. And the inclusion of a washer and dryer (with soap and fabric softener) was an unexpected plus, as was the selection of teas and snacks. The bathroom is rather tiny, though certainly functional. For the price and availability, the whole experience was very positive."
7013085,41103091,2015-08-04,24631635,Debb,"I would recommend this affordable, unique space to anyone spending a few days in Seattle!  I met up with my sister and a friend, and both were extremely impressed with this great find!  The space is decorated wonderfully, with interesting conversation pieces that didn't get in the way.  It's close to the airport, downtown, and a quick walk to buses and trains to get around.  And most importantly, it's reasonably priced for Seattle!"
7013085,41632666,2015-08-08,25663637,Tana,Dana was a good host let us check in early.  Checked in with us to see if we needed anything.  House was accurate as the pictures and description showed.
7013085,42290496,2015-08-12,33298374,T.R.,"This is a great place to stay for the night or longer. Dane met us at the appointed time and walked us through the house. A lot of fun items in the house and nice little extras here and there, like a fully stocked washer and dryer. Being on the road for two days, it was nice to be able to do a couple loads while we rested.

VERY close to lightrail. We went downtown for dinner and were there in 20 minutes or so. About a 5-minute walk to the station from the house. Just a superb experience!"
7013085,43250915,2015-08-18,36577835,Kendra,"Despite delays due to traffic, Alana was available to let us in, give us a tour and make sure we had all that we needed. The neighborhood  was nice with public transit just a few blacks away."
7013085,43427143,2015-08-19,25634115,Randy,"""Uncommon Abode...?"" Yes, Uncommon Abode... At first glance, the place is quirky and whimsical. Odd artifact line the walls and occupy the rooms... then, without noticing when it happens, it just does... you just feel at home. Giant octopus tentacles in the shower? No Problem! Mexican Jumping Beans atop a player piano? Why NOT!?! 

My girlfriend and I had come in to Seattle from Portland on a bus (BOLT BUS) and needed to get to the shipyard to pick up our vehicle that had just come to port from Hawaii. ALL through out the day, we dealt with VERY constricting schedules and unforgiving agents from various businesses. Yet through ALL the stresses of the day, Dane was easy to communicate with and this one NON-STRESS part of the trip SAVED the trip! Dane was GREAT! He actually WAITED for us to arrive and didn't seem the slightest bit bothered that we had run a little late. (Truth: he didn't even carry on as if he'd noticed that we were late! Shhh! Don't tell him!)
Thanks, Dane, for being the one part of the trip that was COMPLETELY STRESS FREE!!!"
7013085,44010169,2015-08-23,40240104,Emma,"Dane and Alanna were great hosts. Very easy to communicate with and happy to help with anything you might need. The house was clean and a lot bigger then what the pictures showed. I loved the octopus in bathroom! On site parking was a bonus. Location a bit misleading on the airbnb map, but easy access to down town with the train. Thanks again you two!"
7013085,44655571,2015-08-28,37699987,Donna,"We LOVED staying in this home.  It was spotless, spacious, and quiet.  There's a private driveway for parking, a small front porch and a back deck.  The washer and dryer really came in handy.  Dane was an excellent host and always available if we needed anything.  He supplied all essential cleaning, laundry, and bathroom supplies plus more.  The neighborhood is transitional, but we never felt unsafe.  It's walking distance to the light rail, though we were glad to have a car for grocery shopping and quick errands.  Hope to be back next summer and this property is available again!  Thanks Dane and Alanna!"
7013085,45177798,2015-08-31,30921607,Casey,"The place was a nice place to stay. It is well decorated and with a good since of humor.

There are a few movies to watch and pamphlets to check out for things around town.

It was really close to the Link as well, which was really nice.

Dane was very good at getting back with us, when we reached out to him, and he did everything to help make the stay more pleasurable.

I would stay here again.
"
7013085,45804596,2015-09-06,34921324,Joanne,"For my review, I found it easier for my train of thought to break it down into three categories as follows;

The Booking
While I was researching the area for total of 4 people, this location had a very competitive price point. The photos of the house looked really neat and eclectic. When I read the reviews and started asking questions, I believe Dane was the only person I corresponded with and he was extremely polite, patient and helpful (I asked a LOT of questions). He had told me he was working on some updates in the house and each bedroom would have an AC unit which was great since it was really hot in the weeks prior.

The House
The location of this place is super convenient. While it’s a short drive from the freeway, the location itself is prime because of all its access points. It took us 5 mins to reach the entrance to the 5 South, and about 5-10 min to reach the 5 North. You can walk a block from the house to the light rail also. There is enough parking for 2 cars in the driveway, but what you are renting is the top floor of the house. The house itself is full of fun things to see, and uniquely decorated indeed. Regretfully, we didn’t have a dining table during our stay, so meal times were a little uncomfortable. Dane did tell me later that they were working on that aspect so hopefully there will be one for the next house guest. There was a previous review about the light rail noise, and I will say that if your window is open on the west side of the house, you will hear it from time to time along with the dinging noise it makes to notify vehicles/passengers that a train is approaching. If you are bothered by light noises such as this, sleep in the bedroom whose window faces north. The person who slept in that room said they couldn’t didn’t hear anything from that side. 

The Area
While the house was great and in a convenient location, my personal feelings about the neighborhood was another matter. It seems like the general area is in the process of “redeveloping” and “upgrading”, so to the north of the house are newer builds and to the south of the house, I didn't prefer to go there. If you need to go to a grocery store, I liked the Safeway north of the house on MLK Way (Starbucks inside). Only once out of the 5 nights I was there did a neighbor across the street have a debacle that woke me up a couple times.

Thanks Dane for all your gracious help, and letting us stay in your lovely home."
7013085,46528151,2015-09-11,21538503,Cori,Wonderful place to stay! Alanna is such a sweet person and a wonderful host. The area is safe and lovely but further from the nightlife we were going for. We loved the decor especially...many pictures were taken. I defiantly hope to visit Seattle again soon and would love to stay at the Uncommon Abode again! 
7013085,47008217,2015-09-14,43831905,Kristi,"We got in late on a Sunday and Dane met us at the house to show us around. I was beyond impressed with how clean the house was. They had extra toiletries if we needed them, tea and coffee to use and he suggested a great Indian food restaurant that would deliver to the house. We had just been on a week long camping trip in the San Juan Islands and greatly appreciated the use of a washer and dryer. We did take an Uber to the house because we were getting in so late but were easily able to walk to the light rail the next morning. I would highly recommend staying here if it's available. "
7013085,47392838,2015-09-18,14810932,Sandra,"We just got back from 2 nights at the Uncommon Abode.  The location was perfect, as we had an all day meeting at the Museum of Flight at nearby Boeing Field.  (BTW, the Museum was fabulous!) We've been to Seattle many times, so didn't want to go downtown this trip.  I was surprised to see how close the light rail station was, though.  In response to a couple of earlier reviews: we didn't hear any noise from the light rail, though we slept in the bedroom facing that way.  Also, our bedroom had a window air conditioner, which we didn't need as the days were nice and the evenings cool.  I did enjoy looking at all the memorabilia, and wondering which play it might be connected to.  I am definitely going to have to Google more about the Grimaldis!  Unfortunately, we didn't get to meet our hosts.  They now have a lock box system, so we got our key by inputting the code.  They did nicely call to inquire if we needed anything, though.  Thanks for letting us stay there!"
7013085,47698215,2015-09-21,7598131,Tiamo,"My girlfriends flew in before I did and Dane was great at helping them settled in so super thankful for the extra accommodation on that end. The house had all the basics that we needed and had funky art work and art pieces that were fun to look at. The neighborhood was a quick drive to downtown and capital hill so great for someone who has a rental car. The only downside to our experience is on Saturday night Dane knocked on the door to ask us to be quiet because they were trying to sleep. It was 2am and my girlfriend and I were just talking in the kitchen. We are both loud talkers, I will give you that, but we were never informed that there were quiet hours and it was not like we had music on, or lots of people or were partying, just two girls talking. Overall it was a great experience, just a bummer to feel like our parents were yelling at us as adults on a great weekend getaway. Just wished the expectations were set and clear understanding how much noise carries through the house was expressed."
7013085,48047559,2015-09-22,2605879,Alexander,"Staying at the unconmon abode was an amazing experience, the house is super cool with all kinds of props and decorations and has everything you need including a fully equiped kitchen and laundry facilities. Dane was very welcoming and helpful during our stay. 5/5 would stay here again!"
7013085,48156981,2015-09-23,8630872,Cara,"The flat was as pictured, filled with lovely cinema memorabilia and roomy. It was tidy, clean and had just enough equipment in the kitchen for us to make breakfast. We were a family of four adults and a baby; with the futon mattress in the living room that Dane provided, there was enough space for everyone. We only stayed one night so it was enough for us, anyway. We didn't explore the immediate area so can't say what there was in terms of things to do but there were two Safeways within 5mins driving distance as well as various eateries and conveniences. The neighbourhood was safe during the day but again, we didn't walk around and we didn't spend time in it at night. One thing to note: the flat has busy streets on three sides and it's on the path of planes flying in and out of Seatac. The bedroom at the back of the house has a window air conditioner so sound comes in through the vents. As a result that room is quite noisy for normal-to-light sleepers. Also, there was a misunderstanding about check-in time: as we were in transit that day and didn't get Dane's email that was sent around 11am, we arrived at 3pm but weren't able to get into the suite until 4pm. That part of the booking could have been smoother."
7013085,48771079,2015-09-28,45206719,Erika,The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7013085,48782952,2015-09-28,32145764,Nicole,Great little place! Very close to the light rail. The unit was very clean and the bed were extremely comfy :). Would stay here again!
7013085,49022911,2015-09-30,42163936,Yi,"Dane's house is clean and tidy. And he prepared something we need. We can use the whole kitchen and the laundry. It's convenient. And we can take the link just walk 5mins,to the downtown just 20 mins. Everything is good."
7013085,49781082,2015-10-06,37792186,Valerie,"we felt very welcome, with responses to questions about what to expect and what light rail stop to get off .  neighborhood quiet and a great location between airport and downtown with a grocery store 1 light rail stop away."
7013085,50347534,2015-10-11,15498883,Kaitlyn,"Alanna and Dane were very accommodating and understanding, especially when we ran into some issues with communicating with them when we were running late. They made sure we had all the information we needed and let us know that they were available if we had questions. The house was very clean and close to the light rail station which was really nice. Lots of interesting things to look at in the house! A great place to stay! "
7013085,50966747,2015-10-16,19137047,Andrilita,"We had a great time staying here. Dane was flexible and accommodating with our schedule and the house itself was very entertaining with all of the props and things to look at. The house, bed linens and towels were clean and we felt right at home with all the amenities provided. It was close enough to walk to light rail so we didn't need a car and the neighborhood was pretty quiet. No complaints and we would stay again if ever in the area."
7013085,51597443,2015-10-21,46895774,Michelle,We were very happy with our stay at the uncommon abode. Dane was kind enough to let us check in early so that we could spend the day in Seattle touring around. The house was clean and quiet. 
7013085,52030320,2015-10-25,12331515,Tiffany,"The home was wildly decorated and awesome! It's on the main floor and the homeowners live/rent on the basement, ground level floor. It's a great home for a fun night!"
7013085,52504707,2015-10-30,13575961,Josh,Dale welcomed us at the apartment and gave us a quick tour before letting us get settled in. The unit was bright and airy as well as conveniently located just two blocks from the light rail line.
7013085,53359650,2015-11-08,10917525,Lauren,"The house was very nice!  Dane was kind enough to let us drop off our luggage early our first day so that we didn't have to walk around with it. They provided us with towels, and had many necessities such as shampoo, body wash, etc available for use.  The location was very conveniently located close to the light rail, so it was very easy for us to go back and forth between downtown, albeit a bit long.  A very good experience overall :)"
7013085,54107176,2015-11-16,44625907,Nicole,"Great hosts! The house was clean and had everything we needed..parking, washer, dryer, close to train station,  etc...and had great decor! Dane and Alanna answered all of our questions regarding the house and Seattle promptly and had thoughtful touches throughout the home that made us feel welcome and comfortable. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
7013085,54616281,2015-11-22,12522359,Greg,"Dane and Alanna were really great hosts.  
They helped with some great suggestions on how to spend our weekend to get the most out of Seattle.  
The place is great.  Fun and interesting decor.  
Great location. Easy to access everything we wanted to get to.  
Thank you.  "

7013085,55290264,2015-11-29,27906637,Ish,"The Uncommon Abode was a good stay for us. Didn't see Alanna or Dane except for the quick tour, but that's what I was looking for, so it worked out greatly. The place was homely, a little ways from Downtown Seattle, but wasn't too bad with a car. The place had everything one could possibly need, from full kitchen to washers and dryers, and the rooms themselves had quirks to them. Overall, the stay was good."
7013085,56637749,2015-12-15,50482382,Sam,The host were extremely helpful with their knowledge of Seattle and with the hospitality they gave to us. The listing on the website was extremely accurate and their house was very nice. The location is awesome because of the proximity to the airport and to the light rail. 
7013085,56959698,2015-12-20,50143175,Beth,Just checked out this morning from a weekend stay. We really enjoyed the home. Beds were very comfortable & loved the eclect design. Very fun!!  We were back at the house both evenings to hang out and would have liked another comfy chair in the living room. One couch really didn't work very well for 3 adult women. It also would have been nice to have a small dining table to sit at to eat. Hosts were responsive to our request for a couple more washcloths. We would definitely stay again & highly recommend to our friends. Great value & perfect location for us. Thanks so much. 
7013085,57160443,2015-12-22,37159907,Chloe,"We had a really good time, it was a really nice central area & the light rail is super convenient. We loved the house, it was very cute & cozy. The hosts were also very helpful and informative. "
7013085,57834750,2015-12-29,51414591,경숙,"집안정리가 잘되어있고 인테리어 또한 독특하다
하지만 해골들이 여러개(2개 단지 장식용)있어 오싹한 마음에 침실에서 거실에 나올 수 없었다 
이벤트적인 방문은 환영한다 하지만 어린 아이들과 여행이라면 무서울 각오는 해야한다
"
7013085,58629233,2016-01-03,50416448,鲁平,"Staying in Dane and Alanna's place was a good experience for us. Rooms were clean and decorations are stylish.(My friend didn't like the decorations inside the house, he told me it is a little weird. But I like them.) The house is five minutes' walk from the light rail station, and it will take you to Seattle downtown within 20 minutes."
9075656,52792999,2015-11-01,47561078,Shannon,"Keith was a great host, had everything ready for my arrival, he's very mellow and helpful, has a book in the room on things to do and see in the city, made sure I had everything I needed and knew where things were in the house, checked in with me every day, great communication to get things set up even though I came last minute. The house is old and rustic and being renovated, it's not pristine and beautiful, but the room was clean, bed was super comfortable, shower is hot with lots of pressure, cats are nice, neighborhood is very quiet, heater in the room, space in the frig, big grocery store 1 block away, restaurants and shops within walking distance on the main street, bus line is close. Had a great stay and would do it again if I'm in the city and need a place to stay. "
9075656,53639651,2015-11-10,26059497,Joe & Ruth,"We had a great stay at Keith's place. The house and our room were great and we really liked the neighbourhood. Keith was a friendly and welcoming host- first offering to pick us up from the airport to help with our bags, and generally making our stay very comfortable. Keith provided tea, coffee and baked goods which was really nice. We loved the house and the neighbourhood. There were plenty of amenities in walking distance, and the neighbourhood was pleasant and felt safe. Our room was great with a nice comfortable bed. And it was a joy to meet Keith's two cats. Thanks Keith!"
9075656,55030487,2015-11-27,18220141,Ryan,"Keith was extremely welcoming and accomodating, and dedicated to guest's feedback — during my stay he added a reading lamp over the bed that a previous guest had suggested (much appreciated!).

I'm an avid cyclist and was borrowing a bike during my stay; Keith helped with me storing my bike, and use of the washer/dryer was extremely helpful to dry out after bike commuting through the rainy season!"
9075656,55457944,2015-12-01,32326615,Florence,"Keith was an excellent host and is is very accommodating and friendly. His house is in a quiet neighbourhood with all the amenities included. It is a convenient location, with many shops and restaurants within walking distance in the Rainier area.  Definitely recommend!"
9075656,56542550,2015-12-14,33119827,Maria,Keith was very friendly and approachable and had a lot of good recommendations. Very easy to be around and I still miss the cats Lucy and Walter.
9075656,56945944,2015-12-20,34098716,Mathew,Keith is a very great host. He asked us what else we need when we arrived and got it for us. Kitties are quite cute. He was really nice to take us to the rail station next morning which is really helpful. Very Recommend. 
9075656,57603557,2015-12-27,51832307,Chelsea,"Keith was incredibly accommodating.  He was flexible with arrival times. The room was clean and ready when I arrived. Cats were sweet but not clingy. His shower and bathroom were nice. Keith always offered to give me rides when he could, and was a very sweet host with a friendly disposition and great sense of humor. House is a cool old house in a good location, close to bus lines downtown. :) I highly recommend staying with Keith, and his cats, Lucy and Walter!"
9075656,58110722,2015-12-31,46418143,Mia,"We didn't get to meet Keith, unfortunately--we arrived late and left early--but Lucy the cat was an excellent ambassador and host-by-proxy! The home and neighborhood were very nice, the bedroom heater kept the room warm efficiently, and Keith thoughtfully left out some fruit that we were able to enjoy before we left in the morning. We would happily stay again!"
9075656,58249487,2016-01-01,42078826,Anna,Quiet and comfortable location. Host was very responsive and accommodating to booking on short notice. Cats were cute and friendly :)
9075656,58452855,2016-01-02,34528719,Kimberly,A welcoming room with all the comforts of home. Extra hangers in the closet were a nice touch. 
3673759,16524058,2014-07-28,18565991,Tim,"This place was great! The apartment is in an excellent location and has everything you could possibly need. Comfortable bed, nice layout, TV with Roku, and even a guide on what to check out in the area. Amy was extremely helpful whenever I had any questions and everything went smoothly. If I'm back in Seattle anytime soon this will be my first choice in accommodations. Thanks again Amy!"
3673759,16801598,2014-08-02,305982,Tim,"The apartment is really cute and very clean. The first night I arrived late, so Amy left the keys in a lock box. It was a bit warm that first night, but when I told Amy she quickly brought over a portable air conditioner, which worked great. 

The neighborhood is great, and I would stay there again. "
3673759,16937804,2014-08-04,18662249,Marilyn,"I really enjoyed my one night stay in this apartment. The place is small - I'd recommend it for one person or two people if you were planning on spending most of your visit outside exploring. I walked to Pike Place Market (15 min ) walk and Portage Bay Cafe (15 min in the other direction) and Whole Foods (10 min on the way to Portage Bay). The apt had everything I needed, including Amy's binder of things to do and see around Seattle.

I didn't get to meet Amy, but she did provide SUPER clear instructions on how to get into the place and made it clear that she was available if I needed anything. 

The kitchen had everything you need to cook a meal at home, including my very favorite kitchen tool - an electric tea kettle!"
3673759,17303163,2014-08-10,18491873,Matthew,Amy was very friendly & had all the info I needed in a binder.  The place was very clean & she even provided a few groceries for me.  It was great that she installed an a/c since Seattle can be hot in the summer.  The neighborhood had plenty of great restaurants & was convenient to attractions.
3673759,17466551,2014-08-12,18771483,Scott,"Host was very nice and accommodating. She even bought a huge AC unit which helped on two very hot summer nights in Seattle, which is very rare to have AC in Seattle. This place is in the PERFECT location, 5 minutes to the space needle, pugent sound, and so many restaurants and bars, it was hard to pick one. Parking was also surprisingly easy to find, would come back again."
3673759,17702059,2014-08-16,11841170,Travis,This place was great! Right next to the space needle and a short walk to downtown and pikes market. Very clean inside with everything you may need for your stay including maps and attraction information. Very easy to reach Amy with questions. I would definitely stay here again next time we are in Seattle!
3673759,17862520,2014-08-18,15791908,Rachel,"Amy's condo in Belltown was perfect for our weekend trip to Seattle. The location was the best part-walkable to Pike's market, the Space needle, anywhere downtown. The space was clean and very well laid out. Amy was wonderful in answering any and all questions we had and her response time was very fast. I would highly recommend this place for anyone wanting to explore the heart of Seattle. A couple things-if you love pizza, you have to try Serious Pie. It's a ten minute walk from the condo. Amazing! Also, there is a rooftop community area in the building. Gorgeous views of the city with seating areas and BBQ's. It was the perfect place to sip wine in the evening. "
3673759,18487747,2014-08-27,2014089,Jessica,"This apartment is an awesome location.  We arrived by train and took a quick ($10 with tip) cab to the location.  It was very easy to get in and then we walked everywhere during our vacation including Pikes Place, Space Needle, and even down to Pioneer Square.  It was so great to not have to worry about parking because we were right in the middle of town and could walk everywhere.   

Amy was awesome to work with, she communicated clearly and we had no problems at all.  It was a very enjoyable stay in Seattle"
3673759,18624542,2014-08-29,3814003,Danielle,"Amy was a delightful host. She met us in person the day we arrived, was very accommodating with an earlier arrival time and made a point to make us feel at home. Her place is lovely, central and very comfortable. "
3673759,18730161,2014-08-31,988981,Freya,"Amy made us feel so welcome in her apartment, which was super clean and comfy! The location was awesome - right near the space needle! The view from the rooftop patio at night was really great. There is a secure place to lock your bike, and it's easy to get around to Seattle sights from the apartment.  If you're in Seattle, this is a great place to stay! "
3673759,19137607,2014-09-07,19258380,Jimena,"This was my first airbnb experience, and it was great! I was in town for a wedding, and the apartment was very centrally located, so I could go to any of the wedding events, and still be in a great area to walk around in and explore in my off time.
Amy was very welcoming and communicative, she was very helpful and kept in touch to make sure that we had made it in ok, and that everything was as expected.
I could not have asked for a better experience with airbnb, it was comfortable, easy and cost-efficient. I would definitely stay here again!"
3673759,19605929,2014-09-15,1264420,Evan,"Place was great, everything you need. Great location in the heart of Belltown. Amy was super accommodating.  Would definitely stay again."
