I didn't get to have the pleasure of meeting neither Jaq or Dirk, but they have a very organized system of making ends meet.  Yes, as the pictures show, you will be climbing up and down a ladder into your bed :)  Otherwise, we did not run into any other guests, and had no problem using the shower or bathroom at any given time.  Very quiet otherwise, and a lot of amenities provided for you.  I would love to come stay here again if I ever come visit Seattle again.  Thanks Jaq & Dirk!"
365550,3489069,2013-02-06,987497,Emma,Good place for a short stay in Seattle. The studio is compact but everything in perfect working order.  It's ideally located near the train station and Pike Place market is only a stroll away. 
365550,3507681,2013-02-10,4327925,Bastien,"The place is very nice, clean and close to the bus/metro station. The bathroom is convenient. We got to meet Jaq and she made sure everything was going well for us. She let us put our bags aside after the check out time, before coming back and going to the airport."
365550,3557594,2013-02-16,1764879,Ben,"I asked to make a reservation and was approved in hours. Jaq wrote me a thorough description of the neighborhood and entry to the loft. I texted her a couple times to get recommendations on places to park and eat – she wrote me right back with great suggestions. When I couldn't figure out the key box right away I called Jaq at about nine and she picked right up and walked me through it.

This loft is ideal for a night or two to visit downtown Seattle and the common spaces were really well maintained. Thanks again for a great stay."
365550,3566864,2013-02-18,662446,Andrea,"Great space.  Very convenient to ferries, galleries, great food and more.  Lovely to be in the midst of artists at work as well. Everyone working or staying in the building was absolutely lovely. We had a great time!"
365550,3616775,2013-02-26,4061850,Ankesh,"The art loft is in a great location. We used Car2Go to drive around and there was one just down a block from their location.  It was easy to get in and the place was very quiet.  Dirk and Jaq had great communication, making this possible.  We had all the amenities needed including a blanket, bath towels and hand towels, soap, toothpaste, shampoo, TV with DirectTV, a space heater, plenty of lights, free wifi, ergo chair and desk, and nice couch.  I love the fact that they have a tankless water heater. It means hot water, fast.  We had access to a common fridge and kitchen area.  We will definitely stay here again the next time we are back in Seattle.  Price, location, and proximity to public transportation was very important to us.  We arrived by AmTrak and left by Boltbus. Both are only a few blocks away from this location.  "
365550,3642703,2013-02-26,2074470,Nandan,"Exactly as pictures, this place is extremely pleasant. The bed is wonderful, the skylight sublime, and the whole building was very quiet!"
365550,3719114,2013-03-07,4094451,Mat,I really enjoyed the location. Short walk from Bolt Bus and transit. Located near downtown and in easy walking or bus distance to anywhere.  Enjoyed my stay. Thanks. 
365550,3808102,2013-03-17,2637999,Calvin,"I stayed at D&J's contemporary loft for a short trip in town. It was a nice loft, just as depicted. D&J were great hosts: super easy to communicate with, very friendly and helpful. The loft was very clean and it offered everything you would need. The location was unbeatable, perfectly located within walking distance to everything. I really enjoyed my stay at the loft, and would highly recommend it to anyone staying in Seattle!"
365550,3825099,2013-03-18,500385,Erin,"The space was just as pictured—everything was well-kept and clean. Great location, too (and free parking on Sundays, which was awesome). I would definitely stay here again. "
365550,3855479,2013-03-21,443616,Melinda,Very comfortable and great location.
365550,3870973,2013-03-23,5278959,Jourdan,"Wonderful place to stay! Very clean, gracious hosts, and wonderful location right near the rail station, downtown and the international district."
365550,3914407,2013-03-26,5423746,Angel,"This was such a cool place! 

We had never stayed in an artist's loft before and we really enjoyed it. The room and common areas were bright, clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have a little living area to relax in at night. The location was great, walking distance from everything. All was perfectly set up for when we arrived and the guest book was complete with maps and restaurant recommendations. Jaq was hard at work while we were there, but Matthew ran into her a few times and she was kind and friendly.

We would definitely stay here again. Thanks for everything!"
365550,3959442,2013-03-31,4881286,Ivy,"Dirk&Jaq responded to all our inquiries and concerns in a timely fashion. Check-in and check-out was hassle-free. The location is superb, walking distance from Amtrak station and Link Light Rail to the SeaTac Airport Station, and short walk to buses that will get you to any part of town. Sharing the bathroom wasn't a problem at all, because it's usually unoccupied when we needed it and kept clean at all times. Dirk&Jaq equipped their guest with basic necessities such as hairdryer and shampoo/conditioner. There was also complimentary tea. Thank you for a great first Airbnb experience Dirk&Jaq! "
365550,4014345,2013-04-02,5622608,Claire,"This was our first experience on Airbnb and we will definitely use the service again. Jaq and Dirk's place was an ideal spot to rest our heads during a Seattle getaway. It was conveniently located, clean, quiet, and the hosts were helpful and quick with responses to questions we had prior to our stay. The photos of the unit make it look deceptively roomy - it is very small, and there were no windows so it didn't encourage lounging around. The shared bathroom wasn't an issue and we saw almost no one during our 2 days there. If you are looking for a minimalist, quiet spot to stay this is a great choice. "
365550,4053506,2013-04-06,1815102,Ly,"Dirk & Jaq's place is in a super convenient location.  It's only a couple blocks away from the lightrail, amtrak station and several bus stops.  There are instructions for everything which I really liked.  Checking in/out was easy.  Dirk & Jaq were even kind enough to let us leave our luggage in the kitchen area before the check in time and again after we checked out.  We only stayed a night so we didn't get a chance to meet Dirk & Jaq.  However,  we did bump into a few people who used the studios and they were really friendly."
365550,4211763,2013-04-19,508798,Susan,"Jaq's lofts are clean&adorable. The location was convenient from the train/ bus (email hidden)ke 2 blocks to be exact( King st station)
Walking distance to the Pikes market as well.Aprox. 15 mins.
 They were accomodidating as far as check in which was very nice and we never had any problems as far as shared bathrooms/ shower.
It was a perfect choice for us.Thanks Dirk & Jaq.
"
365550,4299406,2013-04-26,3473470,Paul,"I booked Dirk and Jaq's art loft for my wife during a conference. Here's here review.

The artist loft was a perfect space to stay when attending a conference for work. The space was very clean and the instructions were very clear. I had no trouble getting into the building early to drop off my things before check in which I really appreciated! The space is pretty cozy, but fine for 1-2 people. My sister and I ended up just sharing the bed since it was so cozy, but the couch will also work for shorter people ;) It did take some getting used to using a ladder first thing in the morning! I took part in some of the free tea left for guests but there is plenty to eat within walking distance. Like most of Seattle, you will get a workout walking up to your room, but looks like they have a setup for accessible entrance as well. The bathrooms were plenty big and well stocked - I never had an issue getting in there to shower."
365550,4319444,2013-04-27,5977243,Carolyn,"The accommodations were great! Everything was spotless.Felt like home away from home! Another bonus is that it is only a few minutes walk to the nearby Amtrak station, making our morning connection a snap.

365550,4348169,2013-04-29,382528,Loren,"My hubby and I  fell in love with the loft--it was close to the Safeco and a hop skip away from the sights of downtown. The place was like staying in your own cozy Ikea display room with every accommodation you need and much much more. Like many others before me, I highly recommend staying here."
365550,4385762,2013-05-01,4133073,Emily,"The loft was ideal and in a great location for our needs. Clean room, clean shared area, comfy bed. It's even handicapped accessible to get to the room. "
365550,4425282,2013-05-04,4359633,Deb,"Dirk and Jaq's loft was a sweet little spot for a rest between airplanes and ferries.  An easy walk from the light rail, and through a secure entry up a wide set of stairs, the first thing we noticed was how much light there was in the interior of the building.  The loft was bright and airy with comfortable modern furnishings.  The bedroom is a platform loft built into the middle of the space with a very comfortable bed beneath the large skylight.  We arrived just in time for Art Walk, and visited Dirk in his gallery on the street level of the building.  Dirk was extremely helpful as we wandered off to explore the neighborhood.  Nearby we found good beer in a casual environment, a sweet community garden that seemed to go on forever, and an easy walk to Pike Place and the ferry beyond.  Definitely recommend... it would be fun to stay here again with more time to explore."
365550,4527038,2013-05-11,4012018,Thabo,The place to stay in Seattle! Dirk and Jaq are great hosts - the location is very convenient and the rooms are modern and comfy! 
365550,4560673,2013-05-13,877580,Danyell,"We were lucky enough to find this gem prior to a weeklong Alaskan cruise. This place could not be in a better spot! The kitchen has a great view of the stadiums (all so close) and we were able to go everywhere we needed for very minimal money. If you like Vietnamese/Chinese/Japanese/Greek - you will be in heaven! We had the best Banh Mi of our lives in the neighborhood. We're already missing Seattle and the very comfortable bed! Oh, and the shower is phenomenal! 

Just a note: if you are a light sleeper who likes to get some shut eye later than 8 am, perhaps bring earplugs for the morning. The doors in the lofts are heavy and some shoes have a sound that travels well. "
365550,4677667,2013-05-20,5580903,JiHyun,"Very confortable and tidy space so that it felt like I was at home. All fabric materials; bedding, sofa, towels and bathrobe, were clean and well maintained and we could use branded shampoo/conditioner and body lotion which were prepared by Dirk&Jap with detailed consideration. (even free coffee in the fridge with french-press!). It was one of the most satisfying experiences at Seattle :)"
365550,4720732,2013-05-21,5872006,Ashwin,"Very convenient and comfortable 1-night stay. The place is exactly as described, and the hosts are very nice and easily reachable. I had a little trouble using the keypad lock out front - but that's more me than anything else - but no major problem.

This was my first time in Seattle, and I didn't have too much time to look up neighborhoods and relative costs of staying overnight. But I got the feeling that Pike's Market and surrounding areas are generally pretty pricey to stay in. Dirk and Jaq's space was excellent in this capacity. It was a super convenient location to walk up to the market / waterfront, where I met a friend for the day.

My flight out was not until 9:30pm on the day of my checkout, so I requested ahead of time that I leave my luggage at their place (but not in my room, so as to make it available to others) until around 7pm, and they were accommodating. They said I can leave it in the kitchen area, and while I was at first a little nervous (as any traveler might be), I noticed that others had done the same, and so I thought it was fine, which it was.

Their house rules explained things very clearly, and it's really easy to be on your own while in this place. I heard the occasional sounds from the kitchen and hallway but I pretty much never saw anyone during the short time I was there (Sunday evening / Monday morning).

Mainly due to its location and price, but also due to the comfort, I will definitely look in to this place again next time I am in Seattle.

Thank you, Dirk and Jaq!"
365550,4794721,2013-05-26,6416523,Shelby,This is a great place to stay. Close to the Light Rail and Dirk&Jaq gave excellent directions.  I can imagine the ladder to the bed may be a bit challenging to climb for some.  The hosts were very responsive to all questions and made my stay there easy.  Would definitely book with them again.
365550,4963244,2013-06-04,618444,Daniel,"Nice place to stay, about a 20 minute walk from Pike Place. Helpful hosts, smooth check-in process. Bed is comfortable, room is clean. Enjoyed the stay."
365550,4992585,2013-06-06,1577895,Katelyn,"The loft was comfortable, private, and clean. Jaq and Dirk have a really good system for hosting guests and we'd definitely recommend it!"
365550,5010621,2013-06-07,6347285,Joel,"We only spent one night at the loft but it was great. BTW ""ZEITGEIST"" has very good coffee and breakfast and is just a few blocks away."
365550,5050654,2013-06-10,483789,Chris,"Communicative, accommodating, and easy going! Thanks for making our weekend getaway all the more enjoyable!"
365550,5095607,2013-06-11,251093,Jeff,I was visiting in town for a web developer conference so I wanted to stay in a place that was centrally located. Dirk and Jaq's place worked out well for me. It was very clean and quiet. I would recommend staying there again!
365550,5113271,2013-06-13,5839045,Victor,"Dirk & Jaq's place was perfect for us. We didn't need that much space, wanted somewhere cozy, clean and close to all Seattle's sites and sounds. Everything is thought out for you before and during your stay. You're given a combination for the lock-box that stores your keys outside the building, the bed is like sleeping on clouds and my favorite part .... providing us with umbrellas knowing full well that guests are likely to see some rain! Dirk and Jaq now exactly what their guests need for a pleasant stay and I give two big thumbs up! "
365550,5139225,2013-06-14,6866445,Thuy-Anh,"I had a wonderful stay here! It was a great location, super clean, and comfy. The host was great at communicating with me when I had questions. The check-in process was easy and great because I could come anytime in the evening. I would stay here again. "
365550,5174451,2013-06-17,4878274,Yosef,"Well organized, very clean, good quality bed. Very good location.  The problem is lack of window or opening skylight for fresh air."
365550,5217752,2013-06-18,1987763,Elizabeth,"The loft was fabulous!  Clean, bright room with a very comfortable bed and great linens.  The shared bathroom was not a problem at all.  I actually didn't see anyone else there during my stay.  While the immediate vicinity seemed a little dead, it was a great location for taking light rail in from the airport and walking downtown for work, dining, shopping, etc.  Dirk and Jaq were fabulous hosts...with the detailed guestbook, great communication, little notes in the loft...there was nothing I needed to ask."
365550,5310848,2013-06-24,2072219,Céline,"Great location (nearby the light train and the Stadium) and also nearby lots of interesting downtown Seattle sites! Very easy to find and very accomodating premises. Will recommend and come back any time ! thank you Jak and Dirk! 
Céline and Sylvain :) "
365550,5356975,2013-06-25,4041505,Remy,"Seriously great location, walking distance to great food & shopping & entertainment, and from Union Station you can be whisked to Westlake center or the Airport in no time. The place is kept immaculately clean. Its a shared bathroom but there are 2, so never a problem. Dirk and Jaq are very responsive and even let me drop my luggage off hours before check in. I would certainly use again!"
365550,5379064,2013-06-27,1947855,Liina,"Jaq&Dirk´s place was a great place to stay when visiting Seattle. The room is clean and cosy, the location nice close to e.g. many great Japanese and Korean restaurants. I would recommed this for a saty in Seattle!"
365550,5431432,2013-06-30,6115813,Wanda,"The loft was clean and comfortable for two people and was very well thought out for guests.  The robe and provided shampoo/soap made the shared bathroom and shower very convenient.  The kitchenette came in handy for reheating leftovers and appreciated  the complimentary coffee and teas.  It could get loud when people congregate in the kitchen, but it did not bother my husband and I.  The sky light above the bed did help bring natural light into the room, but I would recommend blindfolds if you plan on sleeping in.  I recommend  this place if you want  to be close to public transportation, ball park, good Asian food.  Walking to the Pike took us about 20-25 minutes. We had the pleasure of meeting Jaq and  to see her art work.  This is a good place to stay at a reasonable price in Seattle.   "
365550,5447556,2013-07-01,1433523,Chrystyna,"Everything was very well organized, very clean and the location is great to visit Seattle and see the sights. Jaq and Dirk were very accommodating when we needed a place to leave our luggage, since we arrived on a very early flight in, and very understanding when we had a 15-minute delay to get our things out due to traffic and a parade in DT Seattle. We were sharing with other artists who are not residents there and that gave a bit a dormitory/hostel feel to the place. The kitchen was a communal kitchen, the bathroom as well which is also in the description. There were notes everywhere about how to use and what to use, what not to do, etc. We chalked this up to the fact that both men and women work and reside there, so we decided that one half left the other half all of these obvious notes about how to use the appliances while not doing this, that or the other thing. It did leave us with the impression that common sense was not as common as the phrase suggests. The only real complaint we have, and it is stated in the description of the place, but we had no idea how affected we would be, is that there is no window, and therefore no natural air circulation. It was also an unusually hot day, and the hosts prepared four fans for us to keep the air going. In this small space, it was pretty loud. We still felt like we were sleeping in a coffin, and both of us had challenges in overcoming the claustrophobia. It's not our favorite airbnb experience in regard to the space. The hosts, on the other hand, are truly kind and are doing their best with the space they have to offer. "
365550,5543392,2013-07-05,980390,Zam,I had a great time at Dirk & Jaq's place. The shared kitchen/bath were very clean and the bedroom was private and comfortable. The location we excellent and a very short walk from the train station. 
365550,5580943,2013-07-07,6486195,Jason,The loft was exactly what I was looking for a short stay in Seattle. It was great to wake up to the bright skylight above the bed. And the location is pretty close to everything in downtown Seattle.
365550,5674095,2013-07-11,729180,Andi,"What a lovely neighborhood and what a lovely little loft! We had a wonderful stay here -- the bed was so comfortable, with a lovely skylight to warm the blanket. The best, though, is the location. There was a tremendous amount to do and see, all within walking distance. And Dirk & Jaq's restaurant & coffee suggestions were the best. We tried several, and were impressed every time. Thanks!"
365550,5703536,2013-07-12,206891,Audrey,"I liked the Loft, nice little space and the fact that it was so easy to get to via rail link. it was just a 2 block walk from the station. The bedding and bed were very comfortable I even tried to find the LABEL of the Mattress so I could purchase one like it. I would stay here and recommend it a friend.and will be back again next year! You will be comfortable here and enjoy the privacy of your own space! Thank you Dirk and Jaq"
365550,5821759,2013-07-18,491029,Jennifer,"Very clean place, never ran into anyone else in the building the entire time we stayed there so it still felt private. Location was good, a little shady a block or two away after dark but close to bus stops so we got around easily. Parking was limited but we managed to grab a spot, otherwise it would have been about $15/night in paid lots which wasn't bad at all. Had a great time in Seattle, thanks again!"
365550,5881411,2013-07-21,5397841,Anneleen,"Perfect first airbnb experience! Dirk and Jaq were very helpful and accommodating. Check-in was a breeze, even when our plane got delayed and we only got to the apartment at 2 in the morning. The studio was clean, cosy and comfortable. Bathroom and kitchen were perfect too. Very convenient location - especially since we were traveling by public transport - within walking distance of most of Seattle's downtown sights. Would definitely stay here again, if we ever happened to be in Seattle again. "
365550,5906645,2013-07-22,359191,Michelle,The apartment was clean and very central.  Dirk and Jaq were extremely helpful and responsive with any questions we had.  Thanks so much for a great stay!
365550,5947298,2013-07-23,6746300,Maggie,"It's a very good location & good design! 
Everything is clean and you get a tv in the room~! 
Easy to check in, check out!"
365550,5970032,2013-07-24,6761523,Alvin,This loft was the perfect place for my short stay in Seattle. The place was very clean and comfortable and it came with a binder of very helpful instructions and suggestions. The location was convenient for seeing tourist attractions. Dirk and Jaq were very helpful and I would definitely stay here again.
365550,6006638,2013-07-26,6876138,Ranjita,"We had a very comfortable stay at the studio. The location was perfect and convenient to public transportation. Jaq and Dirk have thought of all the details that made for a great experience - detailed instructions to access the keys and the apartment, restaurant/cafe/gallery recommendations in the neighborhood, maps, tea/coffee, toiletries and pretty much anything else one might need. "
365550,6103632,2013-07-30,6281970,Nikolaus,"Dirk and Jaq's place was really great.  It was super clean, quiet, and very convenient to everything fun in Seattle.  It's just one block from the light rail so very easy access to downtown and the airport.  I would book again in a heartbeat! "
365550,6127152,2013-07-31,6181657,Anne,"We had a great time at Dirk & Jaq's place. We were only there for one night. But, the location was perfect for us, since we were taking the Light Rail really early in the morning (the station is really close, walking distance). 
The process to get the keys was a bit tedious, but the directions were really clear and we had no problem to get them. The room is really nice and well equiped. 
I would recommend."
365550,6168639,2013-08-02,1409272,Bettye,"Convenient location near Amtrak and even closer to light rail to get to airport. Many Japanese and Chinese eateries as you are on the edge of Chinatown. Friendly hosts and clean space. Room is a bit small with ladder to bed loft...and no window for fresh air (there are fans) but if your're not spending much time inside the room, it's fine and just around the corner from bathroom and kitchen so perfect for guests who just need a comfortable bed!"
365550,6238979,2013-08-05,2403221,Alex,"Dirk & Jaq's place was totally what we needed for a busy weekend in Seattle. It was VERY clean (!), affordable, modern but cute at the same time, very easy to get from downtown, and quick connection from I-5 at the same time, on an 'artsy"" block. We have not had a chance to meet the hosts but there were super helpful via email and also the place was very well set up by them for AirBnB hosting. We loved the skylight above the bed platform. Sharing the kitchen and the bathrooms was not an issue at all as all common areas are maintained very clean and there was only one other loft in the building that had overnight guests. With hosts' advice we were able to find free parking very close to the building for our entire stay (3 nights)! We walked from downtown fairly late at night without any safety issues. We would definitely stay there again."
365550,6293179,2013-08-06,7826407,Tim,"Our stay here was great. Everything was labeled and there were plenty of instructions and information for guests. We only managed to visit one of the hosts recommendations, but it was a great coffee shop. We would definitely recommend staying here. "
365550,6347707,2013-08-09,7251390,Jesse,"Can't say enough how clean, convenient, and easy it was to stay here. It's in a great location (especially for those arriving to Seattle on plane and leaving on train). The hosts were communicative and very friendly making checking in and out a breeze. "
365550,6364730,2013-08-10,6464303,Stephanie,"Unser Aufenhalt in Seattle war leider nur sehr kurz, doch dafür war das Zimmer bei Dirk und Jaq ideal. Von dort aus waren wir schnell im Zentrum und bei der Zugstation, von der aus ein Zug direkt zum Flughafen fährt. Dirk und Jaq waren sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Es war spannend, ein wenig ""Künstlerluft"" zu schnuppern. Wir können dieses Zimmer weiterempfehlen! "
365550,6392800,2013-08-11,974582,Yiwen,"This is a lovely loft and the location is great.
Dirk & Jaq was very helpful. The room is very clean and very comfortable bed. I would definitely stay here again.
"
365550,6414629,2013-08-12,5017761,Scott,Dirk & Jaq went above and beyond in making our 1 night stay exactly what we were looking for.  They allowed us to drop our bags off early and provided everything we needed.  Highly Recommend.
365550,6753189,2013-08-24,1104464,Matthew,"Great place to stay, clean and very well organised! Thanks to both."
365550,6779154,2013-08-25,6110518,Ron,"Clean modern interesting space to be in.
We slept really well in the loft bed and enjoyed all the information left for us to hep us make the most of our stay.
The Japenese restaurant just around the corner WAS terrific !
We would be happy to recommend this spot."
365550,6880640,2013-08-28,6481895,Nathan,"Wonderful place to stay, Dirk was very friendly and gave lots of good tips about things to do in the neighborhood.  Would definitely stay there again."
365550,6925055,2013-08-30,6501002,Phil,"Dirk and Jaq's loft is very modern and well appointed, in a great downtown Seattle location!  We didn't spend too much time in the loft because we were only in Seattle for one night, but wished that we had checked out the authentic sushi around the corner, don't miss it!"
365550,6952745,2013-09-01,5266546,Seana,"FANTASTIC STAY! The place was so clean. Check in / Check out was very easy. Location was excellent. Check out International District when you're there, the food is amazing. We would stay here again in a heartbeat. A+ rating and 5 stars! -Seana & Drew"
365550,7008763,2013-09-03,858068,Amelia,The loft was exactly as the hosts stated. The location was great for walking to pike place area (or taking the light rail). There are quite a few great coffee shops within a ten minute walk from the loft. It was not noisy at all on the Labor Day weekend we stayed. I would stay here again!
365550,7112831,2013-09-07,6700923,Fraser,"As two Brits visiting Seattle for the 1st time contemporary art loft downtown [#2]was the perfect fit. The room was exactly as it appears in the photos, everything was clean and well presented, free Wi-Fi, TV, iPod dock, etc. The communal areas are great too - tea's, coffee, milk, space in the fridge and cupboards along with crockery. The bathrooms are clean, modern, spacious and well-stocked. The building has one other AirB&B room who share the bathroom, and a suite of workspaces for artists who share the communal areas. When we were staying it was quiet - we had almost no idea there were other people around at night, and those we met in the day were very friendly. The entrance to the building is from the street at ground level and there are stairs that lead straight to the loft/communal areas on the 3rd floor. There's one key for the door from the street and another for the room. It feels secure at night and a safe place to leave your stuff in the day.

Both Dirk and Jaq work in the building (in the workspaces and Dirk has a gallery on the ground floor). We only met Dirk. He's very friendly and helpful. There's a book with local recommendations in the loft - along with most people leaving reviews on here, we wholeheartedly recommend Zeitgeist for coffee and breakfast.

The loft is in the International District and easy walking distance from King St and Union Stations. We caught the Light Rail from Seatac airport and you can almost see the building when you leave King St station. Pioneer Square and Downtown are all close by. We walked most places - we got as far as the Space Needle one day and Volunteer Park the next but there is loads of public transport leaving from the train stations.

Overall we would recommend staying here 100%.

"
365550,7165454,2013-09-09,6540562,Aurore,"No surprise everything was as posted! Very detailed information before and during the stay! Dirk and jaq sent a couple of emails with very useful tips about how to get there, check-in and check-out, the neigborhood, good restaurants, tourist spots, Even maps of Seattle on the desk. We got a lovely rooms with the bed on the mezzanine. Easy access by a ladder. The shared bathroom is for the entire floor but we stayed two weekend nights and we never saw anybody. Very quiet place. Convenient location very close to the subway/bus/airport monorail station. Very good price! For sure I will keep that place in my mind for my next trip in the city! "
365550,7244666,2013-09-13,4582644,Jay And Cynthia,"The loft is exactly what Dirk and Jaq advertise: close to King Station (I walked there with 2 rolling suitcases), clean, quiet, great loft bed, desk, shared kitchen and bathrooms. Plenty of public transportation and great restaurants around. You have to like flights of stairs, though. Thank you! 
"
365550,7246205,2013-09-13,7779821,Jose Luis,"The place is great, super clean and organized. I'd just complain about location, at night it does feel a little bit insecure in the streets. I didn't have the chance to meet the hosts, but everything went smoothly and without any problems. Definitively, is a good deal!! "
365550,7285072,2013-09-14,1867926,Nil,"Cozy little room, very clean and suprisingly bright for a room with only a roof window. Would definitely recommend. The loft bed is very cool too."
365550,7306868,2013-09-15,8016293,Elliot,"Nice loftspace! Don't bonk your head while getting out of bed like I did! LOL! No, really...very fun neighborhood close to everything, Good value. Kitchen to use! "
365550,7324554,2013-09-16,2326053,Jim,"While I did not have the opportunity to meet our hosts personally, they were very helpful in assisting us with our needs and required information. The location and the accomadations were interesting and  acceptable. Thank you, Dirk and Jag"
365550,7453992,2013-09-21,274427,Geri,"This is a fun and interesting space in perfect Seattle location. Easy walk to everything. Everything was in perfect order and we (sister and I) enjoyed our stay. Shower was especially nice--big and lots of hot water. Also towels, hairdryer etc. etc. Wouldn't hesitate to stay again when I'm in Seattle."
365550,7485365,2013-09-22,8123357,Liang,"I really love this place. Feel artistic. Galleries nearby, artists around, and a wonderful Japanese restaurant downstairs. Great! "
365550,7576940,2013-09-25,7342669,Ali,"We stayed for 3 nights in the loft.  It was small like they said it was but that was ok! We had a great time, it was clean and very comfortable. The place was centrally located for walking and exploring. Great eats around the area. Art galleries all around.
It was also very easy to get from the airport to the loft as the light rail was just around the corner. I would stay there again and recommend it to anyone. There is a steep climb of stairs to get up so keep that in mind if you have bad knees or such. Other wise it was just great! Thank you Jaq and Dirk."
365550,7608475,2013-09-26,5256499,Thanh,Great 1 night stay. Very convenient location and Dirk and Jaq were always quick to respond. Fully recommend it!
365550,7637998,2013-09-27,2960674,Lauren,"The loft was super cool! Lots of space, every amenity you could need, excellent location in Seattle near delicious Japanese restaurants. Only 15min walk to downtown, less than 5min from light rail from the airport. Managed to meet Dirk as I was heading out. Super nice guy! Will definitely stay again if I'm in Seattle."
365550,7694899,2013-09-30,7720829,David,"Our stay at the Contemporary loft was an enjoyable stay! Everything went smoothly from the beginning to our end of the stay.

The loft was very clean and we were provided with towels, TV, internet, and umbrellas. We were exploring Seattle for most of our trip so we never got to actually meet Jaq or Dirk, but they were very responsive through messages.

If you love asian food, this is the place to stay. It is right down the street from Japan/China town, and a small walk from Little Saigon. If you stay here, make sure you try out Fuji Bakery. You won't be disappointed!"
365550,7764940,2013-10-01,7229425,Nate,"We had a great one-night stay at Dirk and Jaq's loft on Sunday night. The worst part about the experience is that we didn't get to meet them!

We booked just a couple of days in advance and very quickly got a response from Dirk with all the instructions we needed to get into the loft and to enjoy our stay. They've done a lot of work to make sure their guests understand the arrangement in the building and which amenities are available.

The loft itself is small but cozy. The lack of windows was made up for by the skylight above the bed. We were very comfortable and enjoyed waking up to the sound of rain falling on the skylight (typical Seattle). Everything was clean and well arranged. We didn't use them but there were umbrellas, towels, and bath robes in the room. We were impressed to find some Stumptown decaffinated coffee available for Airbnb guests in the freezer.

Dirk and Jaq go the extra mile to make your stay a good one. If we visit Seattle again soon (here's hoping!) we will seriously consider making one of their lofts our home-away-from-home."
365550,7770855,2013-10-02,7913425,Cathy,"The location was so great, just a couple of blocks from the station!  Jaq met us and showed us everything we needed.  The loft was clean and well furnished, and the bed very comfortable!  We would recommend this to others."
365550,7878924,2013-10-07,8481199,Mary,"We loved it!!! It is as simple as that.  It met all our needs. Easy and convenient and clean.  A quiet space in the middle of the city.  My husband and I drove up from Portland found free street parking and had a relaxing and well needed weekend without the kids!  Thanks to Dirk and Jaq for having this great affordable space for people to use.

We will be back and may check out your condo next time

Mary and Mark"
365550,8003685,2013-10-12,8556080,Kai,"This place was a pretty perfect spot for me. They had a great book of recommendations for dinner, laundry, transit access--and the loft was great. Easy to navigate, not too loud, wifi access, washrooms were super clean. Thanks so much! "
365550,8029616,2013-10-13,9020766,Ella,"This place was absolutely awesome and Dirk & Jaq were really helpful.  I was able to text them and they would get back to me super quick, which really helped out a lot.  The place is cozy and located in a really cool spot.  The thing that really helped was the suggestions that they had for places to eat close by. We ended up eating at a tiny sushi spot right downstairs that was incredibly good. All in all, I had a wonderful experience!!!"
365550,8148827,2013-10-18,7388256,Vicken,I loved being in Japan town. If smelled like home.
365550,8215757,2013-10-21,842200,Eric,The hosts Dirk and Jaq where very attentive to our needs and everything was in great shape. The room was in great condition and looks even cooler than the pictures show. There's a nice skylight over the loft area.  Would stay again!
365550,8276838,2013-10-23,119895,John,"The room is clean, comfortable and quiet. Kitchen and bathroom arrangement works well. The entire floor of our room / kitchen and bath appears to have been recently remodeled and everything is in very good working order. We replied on public transportation for our 3 days here and this location was perfect. We purchased ORCA cards (fast pass) that work on all transit options (except the mono rail) and that made traveling very easy.

Dirk and Jaq were fast to respond to any questions we had.

Thank You."
365550,8332651,2013-10-26,9059906,Pete,"Dirk & Jaq's place was great. The location is very well placed for public transport (light rail, bus, amtrak). It's located at the southern edge of downtown. You can easily walk to the waterfront and places like pike place or the seattle center are a bit of a longer walk. Otherwise take a bus or the light rail which are only 1-2 block(s) away. I only ever spoke to Jaq on the phone but I did meet Dirk in the hallway once or twice. They were both very nice, accommodating, helpful and keen to ensure everything was ok. Thanks for having me!"
365550,8508622,2013-11-03,2379892,Russ,"I had a neat, clean room that's just the right size for 1-2 people to hang out--right near International District.  The hosts provide clear help and instructions and are quick to respond to questions and calls for help.

Some neighborhood tips: For groceries, I suggest Uwajimaya, a short walk away.  For treats, try Beard Papa's, inside the Uwajimaya store."
365550,8776477,2013-11-17,1394692,Elizabeth,"The studio space was a great place to relax after a day of walking the entire city. The location couldn't have been better for folks coming up from Portland, as it is two short blocks away from the Bolt Bus station. Walking to all of the tourist sweet spots was a breeze and the international district has a variety of great food options. Loved the space itself; it was clean and quiet. Thanks for a great non-hotel option in a big city! Oh, and the communication was fantastic as everything was outlined and nothing left to question."
365550,8799081,2013-11-18,9835104,Alex,"This was a good, cost-effective place to stay in an unbeatable location in Seattle.  Jaq was very helpful when we desperately called her with a question about Seattle's parking laws.  We would stay here again in a second, thanks Jaq and Dirk!"
365550,8853041,2013-11-21,1015943,Greg,"Great deal for downtown Seattle. Room was nice, comfortable and spacious.  Not a big fan of shared bathrooms but it works in this case. Close by and convenient. I would stay again. Plus Jaq's art studio tour was really cool !"
365550,8894435,2013-11-24,734210,Alfonso,"Simple and efficient. The keys are easy to get, clean place.
Best if you're on a budget."

"
365550,9321246,2013-12-21,7205664,Renee,"It is a great place to stay. Locates inside the international district, where we can easily grab some nice asian foods. The hosts are very nice, and they are very considerate by providing us a guide book with clear rules and traffic tips. Thank you so much for providing us this great place to stay. "
365550,9354316,2013-12-23,1855755,Mary,"Lovely place. Well kept up everything,dirq and jaq helped me extend my stay and accommodate me on short notice.they are great and so is this place"
365550,9393221,2013-12-26,9820272,Valerie,"We were so lucky to have stayed with Dirk and Jaq as our very first Airbnb experience! Their place is very well located, especially if you're craving good Japanese food - there's one great place just beneath their space. Also very well located near the train station and bus stations. They provided everything we could possibly need! Even bathrobes! Also, they are the sweetest people you could possibly imagine and they reply every single email/question incredibly fast. If we were back in Seattle we would definitely stay here again. "
365550,9746492,2014-01-07,9795201,Russell,"Due to the fact we arrived in Seattle late and had to leave early we did not get the opportunity to meet up with Dirk and Jaq which was disappointing.
The Studio was great. Very clean and comfortable. The shared facilities were likewise very clean and convenient.
Due to our very short stay in Seattle we really did not have that much time to explore the City but what we did see has given us incentive to return.
Dirk and Jaqs studio is ideally situated close to the train station and central Seattle.
We would certainly recommend this accommodation to any future guests. "
365550,9856544,2014-01-14,3106687,Jennifer,"Excellent hosts and accommodations!  I'm so glad we had this booking - it helped make our weekend trip sightseeing in Seattle a great, hassle-free time!  

Location and Logistics- awesome, right by the International District (""ID"")/Chinatown stop. Took the Link from the airport and Shuttle Express back (no Super Shuttle in Seattle under $100). Great (mostly Asian) restaurants nearby. 

Quality - the space was great, exactly as it was described in the listing. Clean, well-organized, well-lit. The loft was perfect for those who need a quiet place to recharge.  The actual loft part was pretty nifty, like sleeping in a treehouse.  The ceiling has a big space in the middle, triangle-shaped, so their is a little bit of headroom up there. 

Great, conscientious, experienced hosts - Dirk and Jaq were up troubleshooting before we were one morning when a strong windstorm knocked out some of the power to the building.  Everything you could need (towels, robe, dishes, utensils) was provided and there were clear instructions throughout.

Great AirBnb experience.  I highly recommend this particular listing, great example of an AirBnb."
365550,9973689,2014-01-22,10555837,Kevin,"A great inexpensive place for staying in seattle, lots of art galleries and sights to see with in walking distance. The Host, Dirk and Jaq were great and replied to every question we had promptly."
365550,10002787,2014-01-24,7734320,Jerry,"Cool place, came in late at night via Amtrak, thankfully this place is super close to the train station.  I encountered an awkward situation when we got locked out because this place is just a series of rooms with a communal kitchen and bathroom outside the hallway, kind of like a college dorm.  There were signs reminding us to bring our keys but as you know, stuff happens, and I forgot to bring my keys on my way to the bathroom.  was in my boxers too and had to run down to the street at 11pm to find a stranger kind enough to let me borrow his smartphone.  Thank you waiter at the japanese restaurant across the street!  Got in touch with Jacq who was very gracious and she came to let us back in our room.  Room was nice, perfect for a quick overnight rest like what we did, but perhaps not ideal for longer term stays.  Price was reasonable. "
365550,10069918,2014-01-28,8322565,Eliza,"Dirk and Jaq were helpful and kind, and the loft space was beautiful! Hope to come back and stay again someday!!"
365550,10188838,2014-02-04,211769,Carla,"We were greeted by the owner who welcomed us with a smile and explained where everything was. The loft we stayed in was very clean and had everything we needed for a night in Seattle. There was 1.5 bathroom shared by 2 other rooms. Shared kitchen was nice but we didn't really use it. The bed up in the loft was very comfortable. The only inconvenience I saw was having to go down the ladder and outside the room to go to the bathroom otherwise, the stay was lovely. Downtown was only a 10-minute walk. The place is close to good Japanese restaurants."
365550,10244790,2014-02-09,9294322,Zhuyi,Great place!Great location and great hosts! I will stay here again if I ever come back to Seattle. 
365550,10284826,2014-02-10,6574131,Helen,My stay at eh contemporary loft was great. The facilities were extra clean and the bed really comfortable. The place is located in the heart of the international district (full of amazing restaurants and close to public transports). I will love to come back to Dirk and Jak's location.
365550,10364246,2014-02-16,1148495,Shirley,"Our stay was great.  Location is amazing, close to some really great coffee and busses.  Apartment was impeccably clean and the guide helped us a lot in finding a place to eat.  

Jaq and Dirk checked in on us a few times, getting the keys were no problem at all.  

Great experience.  Thanks for having us in Seattle!"
365550,10440346,2014-02-18,12117653,Rich,"Really great place as well as price for the location. You can easily walk all the way to Pike Place Market from here. Bus stops, trains and most importantly delicious food joints are highly accessible from here as well. Shared bathroom is not an issue at all, plus the loft itself is really cool. Will book again in a heartbeat."
365550,10674286,2014-03-03,5945447,Michelle,Dirk & Jaq have a cute little place - really close to all forms of public transportation. Access to a full refrigerator and microwave were nice - helped to keep costs down. I recommend this for a mobile (lots of stairs first up to room and then up to loft bed) single or couple.
365550,10762783,2014-03-06,11180897,Max,"Stayed for 3 nights while in a conference and Dirk and Jaq were perfect hosts. Quick to respond and helped us with whatever we needed. Unfortunately, we didn't get the chance to meet in person, but they were great to us."
365550,10788870,2014-03-07,12703472,Angeline,"I didn't stay for long - came in late, left early morning - but I had a great sleep in the comfy bed. Clean and close to transit. It was easy to hear noise outside the room from the other guests but they came in and went straight to bed around the same time I did (12 midnight). I was happy with my choice to stay here. - Angeline
"
365550,10805231,2014-03-08,12619123,Joe,"Nice, cozy unit close to the train. It was clean and comfort making are stay enjoyable. Dirk & Jaq were thorough with their instructions and they had everything ready for us - they were very accommodating."
365550,10859153,2014-03-10,12624954,Heather,"Visited Seattle for the very first time and Dirk and Jak's loft is in the best area. Metro and link we're walking distance away. We were in the middle of all the hot spots in Seattle. We didn't get to meet Dirk and Jak but they communicate so well and effectively you never had to meet. Loft was a great size for 2 people and the bed was amazing! I want to buy a bed just like it. 
Highly recommend this place. Would stay there again in a heart beat. 
"
365550,10926637,2014-03-13,6049212,Madeleine,"The contemporary art loft in the International District was conveniently located, just the right size and had all the amenities.

365550,11334500,2014-03-30,13262005,Richard,Perfect place to stay for those interested in being close to the city! As a guest you will actually want to enjoy your time in the room as well. It is so cozy! 
365550,11372141,2014-03-31,1330671,Patricia,"Jaq and Dirk were great hosts and easy to contact.  They always answered emails promptly.  The loft and the washrooms were very clean. The bed, pillows, and towels were all clean and comfortable.  The loft is located in a easy to get around part of the city and parking outside was easily found.  "
365550,11561397,2014-04-07,1874253,Bruce,"Dirk and Jaq were great hosts. They responded super quickly to all my communications and have everything set up so you can stash your bags before/after your stay using key lockboxes. The room and shared bathroom and kitchen are clean and the bed comfy. 

There are some Yelp 4 star Vietnamese restaurants a couple blocks away and their place is near a mass transit hub which made getting around on public transportation easy. "
365550,11628074,2014-04-09,7929621,Andrew,"Very cool place to stay! Comfy bed (although unfortunately I was suffering from food poisoning.. so I didnt get to relax as much as I would've liked to.) Clean place too,  although I would suggest guests bring a pair of flip flops for the shower. Thanks for the stay!"
365550,11676706,2014-04-11,9073481,Chris,"Dirk and Jaq have some quiet, simple, affordable, and comfortable spaces right in the International District just a few blocks from the transit tunnel, Bolt Bus stop and Amtrak, and a short walk from the rest of downtown. I've stayed in one of their spaces twice now, and it's hard to beat. The system for checking in is quick and simple, and all the stuff you need to know is communicated clearly.

This remains my first choice for lodging in Seattle when I travel there for work."
365550,11762607,2014-04-14,10981450,John & Molly,"Dirk and Jaq were very quick to respond to questions, including helping us find parking on the downtown Seattle streets! The place was very clean, the bed was VERY comfortable. The only thing to keep in mind is it really has no windows, so isn't a place you'd want to relax in so much. However you are in downtown Seattle so this really isn't an issue. Great location and great hosts, definitely book!"
365550,11914651,2014-04-19,2014122,Samantha,"Dirk & Jaq's place was comfortable, clean and conveniently located. The check-in process was smooth and easy. All instructions are clearly stated in emails prior to arrival as well as inside a guidebook upon arrival. We did not get a chance to really interact with Dirk or Jaq during our stay, but they were available and accessible whenever we had any questions or concerns. Overall, definitely recommend!"
365550,12008574,2014-04-21,4273974,Kate,Jaq and Dirk were great hosts! They were very easy to communicate with and well organized. The place was conveniently located and walking distance from downtown.

Great location in the International District. Private room, but not private bathroom. Overall pleasant experience, I would stay again."
365550,12794411,2014-05-11,662446,Andrea,Great stay in Seattle. So convenient. I walked to both the light rail and the ferry from the loft. It was my second time staying there and I would gladly stay again and recommend to others.

365550,12945870,2014-05-15,12891952,Andrea,"We had a great time in this loft. The location is pretty good, just a two minute walk to the train station that brings you to the airport or downtown. The bed was extremely comfortable. The only thing that I missed was a window that I could open to let some fresh air in, but with the help of fans it was still ok. 
Dirk was really helpful, it was easy to get the key and it was no problem that we arrived late at night. I would definitely sty here again. "
365550,13046520,2014-05-18,9606453,Elva,Dirk & Jaq create a very welcoming environment for Air bnbers.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed a lot staying at their apartment. We didn't get a chance to meet them but they reply to our questions very quickly. The location is great for people who need to take train or flight. Train station is just 5 minutes walking.
365550,13238153,2014-05-23,7860552,Renee + Morgan,"Jaq and Dirk were incredible hosts! They responded almost instantaneously to my queries and reservation request. If you're going downtown, the space is on a nice street, maybe, a block away from the Link Rail station. The Link is clean, on-time (in all my instances at least), and safe. But back to the room - the space is as it's pictured (enough for 1 to 2 ppl max but thoughtfully laid out) and you get spoiled with a comfy/clean(!) bathrobe, cable (if you stay in for a night) and the skylight over the bed (it's just magical in the morning). The shared bathroom/shower is impeccably clean; and should you forget or forgo your own toiletries Jaq and Dirk have you covered with a wash cloth, body wash, shampoo, conditioner, a blow dryer, etc. If you need something other than the basics, then there is a great grocery store about two blocks away. Their guest/visitor book has some awesome recommendations, and I strongly encourage you to take a visit to the Tsukushinbo Restaurant located next door. That was one of the tastiest meals I've had in a long time! The owner and staff were very welcoming and chatty. I, for the first time, indulged in a bottle of sparkling sake. It was fantastic! 

All in all, if you're the type of person who likes a plush bed, clean bathroom, the opportunity to stray away from the typical downtown staples in hopes of stumbling upon some really fun spots, then I strongly recommend staying here. If you're a super light sleeper and the other unit is occupied, you may hear them saunter (or stomp) their way to the bathroom or come up the stairs, BUT it didn't bother me much at all. It wasn't a steady stream of stomping or anything so it doesn't really warrant a real notation... 

I hope to visit again and when I do I plan on bringing my husband with me because Seattle and the Int'l District are something to be explored. Jaq and Dirk's place and hospitality gets a full thumbs up."
365550,13271138,2014-05-24,12302750,Andrew,"Dirk & Jaq provided just the perfect accommodations for our needs.  We were in and out of Seattle in just one night because we were passing through, and the building probably couldn't have been more convenient to the train station.  Unfortunately due to our specific travel circumstances, we didn't get to meet our hosts, but it is evident that they pay careful attention to detail in regards to meeting the needs of their guests, and maintaining a clean welcoming environment for them.  They kept in touch with us, leading up to our arrival so that they could make sure we had access to the place, even though they couldn't be there."
365550,13404240,2014-05-27,5149916,Jacqueline,"The Artist Loft was exactly as stated in Dirk & Jaq's description.  Never having been to Seattle, we found it easily following their directions and had a great night's sleep in the most comfortable bed ever.  The loft is simple, clean and had everything needed for our stay.  We are a couple in our 60's and the only thing that was a bit iffy were the stairs to the bed inside the apartment, but we knew that from the description given and were not at all surprised, other than our own age catching up with us. Our hosts had detailed instructions on everything we needed and made our stay comfortable. Being within two blocks of the train made transportation anywhere we wanted to go accessible. "
365550,13490019,2014-05-28,15609339,Calvin,"Dirk & Jaq were great hosts! An amazing space in Seattle's International District. It was very easy to find and the entire process (getting the key, finding the location, checking out) was seamless. I would gladly recommend this space to anyone looking for a place to stay in Downtown Seattle!"
365550,13506920,2014-05-29,9095215,Marissa,"The apartment was clean and simple, exactly as shown in the pictures!  Very easy check-in and check-out, and clean bathroom and living space.  Thank you both!"
365550,13671764,2014-06-02,14336044,Randall,The loft was good.  The bed comfortable and my wife and I had a great time in the international district.  We are locals already we used the loft as a chance to steal away for the night and enjoy the downtown evening.  I would use this loft again.  We had a bit of interaction with Jaq and she was great always helpful.  Thank you.
365550,13823912,2014-06-05,14606927,Yoo-Jin,"Jaq and Dirk's studio space was cozy, comfortable and clean. I was in town for a conference and needed a quiet place where I could come and go on my own schedule, and the private studio room in this artists building was perfect for it. It's only a few steps away from public transportation (train and buses). It is totally walkable to downtown area (only a mile away) and I took advantage of the beautiful weather I was lucky to experience in Seattle. I met both Jaq and Dirk and they were friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended!
"
365550,13954338,2014-06-09,13867086,Rachel,"Having Dirk & Jaq's place as my first airbnb experience completely spoiled my standard. Artsy/cozy/quiet accommodation, comfy bed, clean shower, best location for the downtown tour. The check-in & out process was very transparent and systematic. 
Dirk & Jaq were very responsive and generous! They allowed me to leave my luggage out at their kitchen area for an extra few hours even after I checked-out from the room. If it wasn't their kindness I might have missed that last minute tour at Seattle Art museum..   
If you are thinking of fully experiencing the city of Seattle, I highly, highly recommend staying at Dirk & Jaq's art studio!!!!"
365550,14113222,2014-06-12,5885332,Ana,Wonderful stay- very efficient and everything was exactly as described.
365550,14148593,2014-06-13,13560967,Lynda,I have stayed there twice and recommend the lofts. One is a bit larger than the other. 
365550,14438155,2014-06-19,15536404,Claire,"Although I was only able to stay one night, it was amazing. The room was clean and spacious. There were a ton of sticky notes to help me navigate around the building. The constant remeinders of the reservation were a big help. I was able to meet Jaq while she was working in her art studio and she was extememly nice and accomodating. I would definitley stay here in the future. "
365550,14488173,2014-06-20,14863968,Xiao,"Very neat comfortable apartment in the international district. Five minutes walk to the light rail station. Close to lots of good Asian restaurant. Stairs might be a little challenging for big suitcases, but no problem for me."
365550,14525901,2014-06-21,15199128,Solomon,The listing was just as advertising - a wonderful loft in the International District - very close to public transportation and a short walk to anywhere you might want to go in Seattle.
365550,14628811,2014-06-23,15900261,Chris,Cool little loft conveniently located! Would definitely stay here again 
365550,14707918,2014-06-24,133512,Nicholas,"Thanks Dirk and Jaq, everything was really smooth. the place was really well located, clean and comfy. Exactly what I was looking for!"
365550,14741955,2014-06-25,15455724,Travis,"Excellent loft. Everything was very well organized in terms of picking up the keys and checking out. Bed was very comfortable. 

I was very impressed by the cleanliness of the kitchen and bathrooms. 

Location was excellent. We had come to go to a Mariners game and the walk was less than 15 minutes to the park.

If you're looking for a simple place that is located right downtown this is perfect. 

Highly recommended. "
365550,14776399,2014-06-26,1174788,Sabrina,"We just stayed there for one night but it was perfect! Small, clean, got everything you need, close to Downtown&main attractions! But the best-the bed was sooo confortable! Very quiet area as well! The communication with Dirk&Jaq was easy and they even allowed us to let our luggage there before&after ceckin-in/check-out! Very kind-thanks a lot for everything!"
365550,14815725,2014-06-27,960556,Calvin,"I really enjoyed my stay at Dirk and Jaq's place. The property is a quick 5 minute walk from the International District/Chinatown station and check-in was a breeze. The loft was clean as were the bathrooms, and the bed was very comfortable too. I'd recommend this loft to anyone visiting Seattle for a short stay. The price was very affordable and I'd gladly stay again."
365550,14888188,2014-06-28,16971797,Kevin,"Everything was expected and even nicer. This was my first AirBNB experience, and it may have spoiled me a bit. Dirk and Jaq were super responsive, and do a great a job keeping the place clean and inviting. There were very thoughtful post-it notes near the  key drop and in the room, answering any questions that arose. Location wise, it is walkable to Seattle's major attraction, and also 2 min walking to a large public transit center. Overall, I am looking forward to staying here again if I travel to Seattle again."
365550,15075553,2014-07-01,11514057,James,"Great place, clean and easy to get to from multiple transit stations.
Dirk & Jaq provided clear direction and were quick to respond."
365550,15104630,2014-07-02,2974359,Erika,Great location near king station for easy departure to canada in the am. Had what I needed to get to me next destination. Thank you!
365550,15165067,2014-07-03,9137363,Philipp,"This is how Airbnb was meant to be. Fast and friendly communication, centrally located, clean room with all the extras you need. We would stay there again anytime."
365550,15253237,2014-07-06,10983,Lynn,"Very easy communication, directions, and expectations. The loft was cozy (smaller than pictured) but nicely appointed. We loved the skylight above the bed and slept very soundly each night. I thought it was an interesting experience being in an artists' building! We walked everywhere around downtown and the Space Needle. When necessary, we easily found a Car2Go. Parts of this neighborhood felt unsafe at times. I loved the easy access of the Link Rail system, but we came in late at night with lots of bags and I would have taken a taxi from the airport if I had to do it over again."
365550,15404052,2014-07-08,15818079,James,"We had a great time in Seattle and really enjoyed Dirk and Jaq's place! It was exactly as described, clean and ready earlier than expected! Convenient and easy to find, their advice on parking was spot on! We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!"
365550,15577584,2014-07-12,14900034,Chelsea,"My fiancé and I had a spectacular time, thanks in large part to the closeness of the loft to Pike Place. Each morning we got up and walked to Pike or the pier and no matter where we ended up a lyft ride was no more than $9. 
The loft was clean, quiet, and cool with plenty of spare dishes. The bathrooms are kept clean and despite there being other airbnb guests were always available. The room was as pictured and roomie enough for the both of us. Just around the corner is an amazing Pho restaurant and no matter what time of day we left or came in the sushi restaurant in the building next door ALWAYS had a line. "
365550,15626094,2014-07-13,6214251,Dave,Great location.  Easy in and out.  A good experience and just what I was looking for.  Thanks again!
365550,15765372,2014-07-15,3022491,Nick,We had a great time at the loft apartment.   It was a warm weekend but the fans etc. kept things nice and cool.  Nice location for using the train too!  Thanks Dirk & Jaq!
365550,15910105,2014-07-18,15511962,Kate & Lachlan,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here sand would not hesitate to stay here again. The room had everything we needed, was extremely clean and came with detailed instructions with everything we needed to know. Although we did not get a chance to meet Dirk and Jaq, they were always in communication with us to ensure our stay was comfortable. "
365550,16262340,2014-07-24,9559462,Jason,"Great place, very convenient, clean and well equipped. My stay was a quick overnight stopover, and for the price Dirk & Jaq's place was perfect! I appreciated that they had shower products on hand - a small but nice touch!"
365550,16460950,2014-07-28,15198576,Megan,"We throughly enjoyed our stay in Seattle at Dirk and Jaq's artist loft! Although we didn't get a chance to meet Dirk and Jaq, we communicated with each other through the app and they were always pleasant and helpful. I loved how much information they provided us with, it was really nice as it was not only my first time using airbnb, but my first time in Seattle! The artist loft is just as shown in the pictures: simple, minimalist, clean. We appreciated all the extra touches, like the info about the area, food recommendations (zeitgeist cafe!!)and other amenities. It's an especially great place to stay if you are coming by way of Amtrak and are using public transportation- we got along fine by using googlemaps and the help of kind Seattle busdrivers. "
365550,16686411,2014-07-31,5308687,Helen,"This was the perfect solution to arriving late at night in Seattle and finding clean, safe, welcoming accommodation. Access was extremely straightforward, and as it happened Jaq and Dirk were just leaving as I arrived, it was great to meet them and be shown around. However, there are such clear and concise instructions that you would be perfectly OK without. The bed is comfy, internet and TV abundant, kitchen area very clean and well appointed, superb shower, loads of space and aesthetically its a great space to be in, a privilege to see art work on the walls and be in the lovely airy whiteness of the loft. Thank you!"
365550,16708746,2014-08-01,7227879,Kangda,"Jaq and Dirk's place was fantastic! We were able to book pretty early on, and the whole process was seamless. Their place is clean, comfortable, and very convenient. The check-in process was super easy and Jaq/Dirk left instructions on everything! It's a close walk to everything we needed, and they were nice enough to leave a book of the best places to eat and see. "
365550,16768538,2014-08-02,13508392,Matt,"The location, space, and host were all extraordinary! My girlfriend Molly and I initially chose this listing mostly because of the proximity to public transit and and Downtown Seattle. 

We were on our way to my cousins wedding in Vancouver and wanted to maximize our experience by flying into Seattle, exploring the city for the night, and then taking the early morning Amtrack train to Vancouver to see the Puget sound.

This location was PERFECT for our plan. The light rail takes you straight from the Seatac Airport to a station a block away from Dirk and Jaq's place. The King Street Amtrack station is also a block or two from this location, so we literally just woke up and walked across the street and were on our way to Canada!

As for the space, it was very sleek, stylish, modern and luxurious. You get to sleep on this very comfortable loft bed that looks out into a sun roof (with an optional shade if you want to block out the light). The space is very well thought out, with outlets everywhere, and very nice post-it-notes listing instructions for appliances and suggestions for places to eat and see. 

On our way out to walk around downtown and Pike Place (only about 1/2-1 mile away) we ran into Dirk and had a great conversation. He is a wonderful and caring host, and had a million suggestions and stories to share with us. I wish we had more time to stay and see some of his art! (One of his studios is located in the same building). Definitely an amazing experience that we won't forget. We hope to come back soon!"
365550,16998668,2014-08-05,17741359,Matt,"Dirk & Jaq were great. Helpful and pleasant. The room was clean and nice, bed was really comfy."
365550,17092099,2014-08-07,7339246,Joseph,The loft was comfortable and very easy to access. It is located very close to the train station and the key drop box made it easy to come and go as we pleased. 
365550,17162826,2014-08-08,17720797,Rachael,"Although we didn't get to meet Dirk & Jaq on our short trip through Seattle, the whole stay was seamless.  The location was great- walking distance to downtown Pike Place Market. The bed was very comfy.  And most of all,  Dirk & Jaq's pre-checkin instructions and directions helped us find the public transit and avoid a $40 to $50 cab ride."
365550,17283518,2014-08-10,16596015,Xan,"This space is in a great location and an excellent value.  Hosts are fabulous, thoughtful.  Four stars for communication!"
365550,17336333,2014-08-11,5656886,Brandi,Dirk and Jaq are very organized and leave a lot of details for all the guests. We had an easy time to find free parking because of their detailed instructions. The place was clean and had everything we needed. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Great downtown location!
365550,17682478,2014-08-16,14952551,Zihsian,Dirk & Jaq are very nice and friendly. The location is great and convenient.  The room is clean and comfortable. We have a wonderful stay. 
365550,17936660,2014-08-19,9931456,Yan,"It was a very nice stay at Jaqs place! The studio is very close to everywhere we want to go:). And very clean, quiet. The bed is comfortable.  We definitely will come back again. Thank you very much!"
365550,18056575,2014-08-21,2059125,Jay,"This tiny loft room was exactly what we needed for our two nights in Seattle. It's five minutes on foot from the Amtrak station and close to city transit options. Great coffee is also a short walk away!

Jaq greeted us and showed preparedness and attention to detail by giving us quick, clear info on how to handle any conceivable situation. She made our stay seamless and hassle-free."
365550,18164792,2014-08-23,14720515,Julie,"Dirk & Jaq provided very detailed instructions on transportation to/from the loft which really helped us being new to the city coming from the airport.  They also left very detailed recommendations for food, checking in/out, and how to use the space.  Convenient location, unique loft space, and I would recommend to anyone looking for a unique place to stay. "
365550,18307380,2014-08-25,11140407,Valérie,"The apartment is very well located and Dirk & Jak made it very practical (the box with keys at the entrance is just a great idea). The only slight shade of grey is about the natural light, just above the bed, it wakes you up pretty early in the morning. But that's also a good way to avoid wasting time in bed after all :p
Bottom line, I had a great time in Seattle..."
365550,18429498,2014-08-26,19232400,Wei,"房东十分和蔼友善，房子跟房间都很有现代艺术气息，阁楼加天窗很赞！离西雅图沿海的景点都不远~我本人非常喜欢它的设计哦~
Excellent hostess! I met Jaq when I arrived there and she is friendly and nice. I loved the house and the room. It really amazed me! I and my friend could easily get access to different places of interest. The atmosphere of art was attractive. I LOVE it!   "
365550,18523972,2014-08-28,15511846,Reece,"Our stay here was fantastic, my sister and I had a  very relaxing time. Dirk was very accommodating and provided us with great information about some of the nicest places to eat nearby. The accommodation was great and the mattress was incredibly comfortable. Dirk was also kind enough to drop us at the coach station in order for us to catch our greyhound bus. "
365550,18618398,2014-08-29,7975205,Sandra,Very clean and great location for getting around the city. helpful and friendly hosts.
365550,18660490,2014-08-30,13893673,Jonathan,"We enjoyed our stay at D&J’s apartment in Seattle.  Check-in was fast and easy (key box), which allowed us flexibility for a late arrival.  The apartment was clean, and consistent with the description.  Highly recommended for it’s convenience to the train station.  We were able to make our early 7:20am train (Amtrak Cascades to Vancouver) without any problems.  We ran into Dirk and his dog on our way out, and found him very friendly and excited to help us."
365550,18935079,2014-09-03,12274334,Muntana,"Host: Dirk and Jaq are professional, prompt and courteous in all dealings. Top rated Host. Unfortunately, we were so full on that we did not have time to meet them. 

Property: It is as described on the website. The bed is most comfortable and the room and amenities are clean. Bonus - umbrellas and gown are available for guess use - very thoughtful of Dirk and Jaq. However, the room is a bit small with no windows to look out and a fresh coat of paint may give it a fresh lift. 

Neighbourhood: most conveniently located with a stone throw to Chinatown / Japan town (tasty Japanese food around the corner), Union Station (connecting from SeaTac airport direct in 25 mins @2.50 pp) and Amtrack station (for those who need to connect to Cascades / buses to and from Vancouver). It is also within 30 mins walk to Downtown, Waterfront, Pikes Place Market and less to Pioneer Square. Some sections may be a bit hilly to walk though, but that us Seattle in general.  Neighbourhood is largely safe, however do avoid some small sections near Pioneer Square. Plenty of parking either free / at small fees. 

Dirk and Jaq - thank you so much for allowing us to stay at your property. Your place has made our visit to Seattle pleasant and our connection to Vancouver a breeze. 

"
365550,19066823,2014-09-06,2500898,Inga,"On our US roundtrip we stayed for 3 nights in Seattle. From the apartment to seattly city center and the pike place market its only a 10-15 min walk. You can perfectly stay there without a car.

The room and also the bathroom was clean and tidy and we had enough space for all our luggage! 

The room is located in an office space, the atmosphore is not like a home, but that was ok, as we knew that in advance. We nearly never met someone there, also no artists or anyone. 

The japanise restaurant that Jaq recomments was fabulous! Out of 3 nights we stayed there twice. If you have the chance, go there. We would advice you to make a  reservation. But we were lucky ones and got both times a seat without reservation.

All in all i can really recommend the room for a trip to seattle!"
365550,19196158,2014-09-08,17573459,Ross,"Good place, located near a bus station which is very convenient and close to some good restaurants in International District. Clean, with two bathroom, Responsive hosts, and helpful post-it's everywhere."
365550,19668055,2014-09-16,15636451,Nick,Dirk & Jaq were great hosts and the place was exactly as described. Great location with access to transit everywhere. Everything was clean and we never had any issues with the shared spaces. Thanks again for everything!
365550,19731988,2014-09-17,15550342,Ingo,"It's a good place to stay in Seattle. Everything was clean and exactly as described. Especially the sky window.
I really enjoyed the stay at the appartment with lots of helpful post-it's everywhere :)"
365550,19769166,2014-09-18,12135303,Mitchell,The place was very easy to find. The Link was roughly a block away.  The location made it very easy to go to downtown and the airport.
365550,19872690,2014-09-20,17989886,Okki,"My husband and I really enjoyed our stay here. A bit small room but that's all you need. It's very clean, tidy and quiet. I especially like the window on the ceiling. The location is perfect for a short stay in Seattle; easy to get there by public transportation and visit attractions from. 

Dirk and Jaq are good communicators and very responsive. They do know what a traveler wants and needs. In fact, we were quite impressed by their thoughtful consideration in the memos and toiletries. A shard bathroom but no problem to have access to it.

A good option in Seattle indeed! "
365550,20002775,2014-09-22,7673572,Leonora,"I had a wonderful stay at Dirk and Jaq's. I briefly met Jaq on my arrival. Everything was as stated in the description, no surprises, or disappointments. Any questions I had were promptly answered. The area is accessible to public transportation (Link, busses, Amtrak).  I often visit Seattle, and definitely would consider staying at the loft again."
365550,20178380,2014-09-25,13824191,Uwe,"Everything in the communication went well. Had the chance to talk to Dirk. He was very open and friendly and he gave good suggestions. The japanese/chinese neighborhood is easy to get good and not too pricy food. The house is in walking distance to downtown and only 2 min walk from the station. The room itself is exactly as on the pictures but seems to be a little smaller. If other people are noisy you hear it. The shared bathroom was no problem and is spacious. There is camera surveillance on the hallways which made us feel ""viewed"" when not in the rooms. "
365550,20233612,2014-09-26,16789468,David,"My wife and I stayed one night, and we unfortunately did not get a chance to meet Dirk & Jaq in person, but they were responsive via the airbnb app when we had questions.  We had to manage a few different sets of keys while staying here, but the instructions laid out how to do that well.  The space is as shown: clean, with a bed reached by climbing up a ladder.  The location is readily accessible to intercity transportation options by land, sea, and air, as Amtrak's King Street Station is just a couple blocks away, a number of ferries are not much farther, and light rail with a station near the Amtrak depot will take you to SeaTac airport.  Even if you don't meet Dirk & Jaq, they do have a guidebook in the room that includes a lot of suggestions.  The light rail will take you downtown, but you can also pretty easily walk there too, as we did."
365550,20292932,2014-09-27,7568949,Melanie,"This building is conveniently located to the light rail and easy to find. The room was comfortable and great for a short trip to the city. Loved the information packet that they provided with excellent recommendations for nearby restaurants. Cannot stress enough wonderful this location was for us; we were able to walk to Pioneer Park and Pike Place Market! Thanks for the hospitality, Dirk and Jaq!"
365550,20410159,2014-09-29,9232379,Austin,"Dirk and Jaq's place was great for a traveler who is planning on really exploring what Seattle has to offer. Great location near Pioneer Square,  the waterfront, stadiums, link and Amtrak. Everything within the accommodation was as stated within the listing. I would most definitely stay here again if the opportunity was presented.  "
365550,20571187,2014-10-01,2896513,Leeza,"Jaq and Dirk got in touch with me personally as soon as my reservation was confirmed. Their information about the room, the area is clear and thorough and made finding the place and getting in easy for me. Both of them were prompt in responding to my questions, which was great.

The room is clean, pleasant and perfect for one or two people. It is nicely laid out with a living space downstairs and a double bed in the loft area.

If I'm back in Seattle, I'll be back here!"
365550,20597726,2014-10-02,9232379,Austin,"Dirk and Jaq's place was great for a traveler who is planning on really exploring what Seattle has to offer. Great location near Pioneer Square,  the waterfront, stadiums, link and Amtrak. Everything within the accommodation was as stated within the listing. I would most definitely stay here again if the opportunity was presented.  "
365550,20640755,2014-10-03,2477359,Tim,"Very nice room, exactly as described. Bed was amazingly comfortable. Bathrooms were clean.  Room was close to Amtrak, uphill on the way to the room. 

There are a LOT of stairs but I did notice a stairglider motarized chair, didn't check it out.  Nice sushi restaurant, recommended by my hosts, two doors down. Warning, the restaurant is very popular so get there as early as possible.

Highly recommended!!!"
365550,20740725,2014-10-05,18071798,Dinah,"I had a great stay here. It was very clean, comfortable, aesthetically pleasing. I would definitely stay here again. "
365550,20843292,2014-10-06,21031223,Yin,"The studio is almost exactly like photos. The location is central, very convenient. the Host normally response your reply promptly. However I was unlucky, as when I arrived, the air circulation fan was broken. As the description shows, this studio is no open windows, so my staying with stuffy air was horrible. I could not sleep well as there is no fresh air during my staying. So please make sure before you arrive, the air fan is working, as it is the vital part to ensure your comfortable staying. Otherwise, i could imagine you would like it.
Also as part of my experience, if there is something wrong, like in my case, the fan was broken, it is difficult to have a fair solution if you directly contact the host, but airbnb organization is just wonderful. They really support and understand your bad experience and provide fair solution. Excellent team from airbnb."
365550,20905200,2014-10-07,6939563,Serron & Rich,"Communication was entirely by email, but it was clear and was all we needed.  The space is comfortable and closely located by many of Capital hill's attraction.  The bed alone is 5 stars comfortable!"
365550,20985721,2014-10-09,15587240,Pearce,"Really close to the Light Link Rail, and very easy public transit from Sea-Tac airport. Our hosts welcomed us warmly into their studio/gallery space and delightful neighbourhood. The room was exactly as described, and really well laid out for such a cozy space. Super comfortable bed, relaxing couch, great storage for luggage and clothing! You could easily spend a week exploring the local neighbourhood, between the great dim sum breakfasts, afternoons at the pinball museum, or evenings at Seattle's Oldest Sushi Bar right around the corner. Not to mention the Bruce Lee Exhibit (phone number hidden)) exhibit at Wing Luke Museum. Our hosts had these suggestions for local exploring and a lot more. We spent a couple of nights at this location before our convention and would book again."
365550,21138871,2014-10-12,13338396,Emilie,Excellent communication. Perfect location and very nice studio. Thank so much for everything ! :-)
365550,21371142,2014-10-15,22480862,Louise,"We were able to arrange this accommodation in just 24hrs, and received prompt and helpful communication from the hosts. They were also flexible with some special arrangements for us. The room was clean, tidy and functional, everything we needed for a one-night stay in Seattle. There was also a handy guidebook with information about the building as well as the surrounding area, with restaurant tips etc., which made us feel welcome."
365550,21456928,2014-10-18,15246807,Brian,"This place was exactly what we expected from the pictures. Located in the international district we were in the middle of everything. Public transportation was right down the street and we took advantage of the foot massage place around the corner. One hour foot massage for $27!! Would definitely stay here again if I'm ever back in Seattle! 
"
365550,21506342,2014-10-19,17889323,Amanda,Dirk & Jaq's place was perfect for the price. It had everything we needed. It's right by International Station so it's perfect to get to and from Downtown as well as the airport. The best part was that it was right by all these great Japanese restaurants!! We will definitely look into staying here when we visit Seattle again.
365550,21705553,2014-10-22,3364566,Gregory,"We stayed on two different nights within a few days of each other and our previous review is identical for our stay. No complaints, we had a great stay and would stay here again. "
365550,21774629,2014-10-23,8641756,Shannon,"Great Airbnb experience! The directions were spot on and the loft was cute and clean. I appreciated the book with instructions, the complementary umbrellas, and the fact that there was an emergency phone in the hallway. What a great place!!! Highly recommended!!!"
365550,21787190,2014-10-24,21333502,Sarah,Loft was clean and as described.  Check in/out were super easy.  Thanks for a nice night in Seattle.
365550,21828273,2014-10-25,3364566,Gregory,"Our experience was better than expected as Dirk and Jaq accommodated our arrival time, allowed us to leave bags and eventually occupy the room a little ahead of time. The contact was brief but the directions getting keys/access and the information about the room, the area and the city was well organized. The room and bedding were clean, the shower/toilet facility was adequate for the set-up. If you are not used to loft sleeping, the ladder is a little steep. Also, we liked the neighborhood and were able to try two Japanese restaurants nearby, one highly recommended."
365550,21939626,2014-10-27,17783716,Thomas,"For our first time in Seattle, Dirk and Jaq's loft could not be in a more convenient location.  We very much enjoyed our walk to the Ferry Terminal, stopping at Dirk's favorite coffee shop along the way.  There are many restaurants in the vicinity and the ones we tried were very good.  The loft was very comfortable and clean, the photos accurately capture the space.  The bathroom and shower was very well kept as well.  It was fun knowing that we were staying in an art studio.  For a unique and inexpensive stay, Dirk and Jaq's art loft is an excellent choice.  "
365550,22143535,2014-10-31,21327516,Jessica And James,"Jaq made us feel very welcome and provided easy to follow information.  The accommodations were as described and better than we expected.  Accessing the loft was simple.  Dirk and Jaq have thought of many things to make their guests comfortable (coffee, tea, lotion, shampoo, etc.).  The room is very private and we ran into very few people.  It was nice having a secure place to store luggage after check out and the room was even ready early.  The loft is VERY close to the tram and is an easy walk to Pike's Place.  We walked around the neighborhood during the day and at night and felt at ease and safe.  "
365550,22225354,2014-11-02,1143737,Jennifer,Everything was just as Jaq and Dirk had described!  Their loft was very conveniently located near downtown Seattle and very easy to find. We found the accommodations to be lovely and perfect for our stay. 
365550,22367206,2014-11-04,22056453,Chris,"First off , this place , this loft .. Which these people said was "" amazing "" and "" super trendy and cool "" and supposedly was "" amazing location near everything !"" Well please let me just tell you .... They were absolutely right . This place was all of those things and more.... We went to the Seahawks game , which was right up the street ! Went to the best sushi I have ever had , which was right around the corner , and went to all of what Seattle had to over that was cool , which was right up the road .. And most important , I was worried about missing my show ""
The walking dead "" because I was worried they wouldn't have any cable ! No way ! They do ! And I totally watched it with my lady ! Overall this place was simply amazing , it's simple and quaint , but just unbelievably cool ! I am so grateful that I got these days here .... Rain or not , this was one of the best trips I have ever had ! Thank you so much for everything !!"
365550,22507110,2014-11-08,21791805,Christophe,"La chambre est très propre, c'est appréciable. C'est exactement la photo et le petit escalier amène sur une petite mezzanine où il y a un lit double avec une petite hauteur sous plafond. Il n'y a pas de fenêtre mais un petit skydôme. A noter que la cuisine, les toilettes et la salle d'eau sont des parties communes. Le Wifi fonctionne très bien. J'ai pu croiser Dirk et Jaq qui sont très aimable. La chambre est très proche des transports en commun. On peut rejoindre le centre du DownTown a pied en 15 minutes aussi. Idéal pour un petit séjour à seattle"
365550,22519908,2014-11-09,14787619,Lori,"A comfortable, welcoming space in a great location with easy access to all of downtown Seattle. Dirk and Jac were accommodating and helpful."
365550,22590352,2014-11-10,607714,Natnaal,"Dirk & Jaq's place was in a convenient location, and as advertised. I had the chance to meet Jaq when we checked in and she provided us with the necessary info. Room is perfect for two, and it felt like we had the place to ourselves. Would definitely book again. Thanks!"
365550,22665271,2014-11-11,7962944,Zan And Rainbow,The art loft was just as advertised.  A great location and extremely clean and pleasant space.  We never got to meet Dirk and Jaq but they were easy to communicate with and made the process effortless.  Thanks so much!
365550,22728042,2014-11-12,95484,John,"Very clean, no frills but practical. Room was as advertised."
365550,22760211,2014-11-14,9361578,Antonio,"Just as described. Fantastic location near train station. Great food, especially sushi right below the flat, and it was good sushi! Jaq is really helpful and friendly. Zero complaints, my wife and I had a great time. "
365550,23027514,2014-11-20,19186600,Tavinho,Was amazing.. Highly recommend it 
365550,23057891,2014-11-21,9669411,Joel,"Lovely little space in an area close enough to downtown!  Loved the amount of ""green"" in the kitchen area, plants brought the space to life.  Only stayed one night for a quick work trip, but have definitely filed this one as a place to stay on personal trips too."
365550,23097149,2014-11-23,21341293,Kara,"We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this unique accommodation - sort of reminded me of my time in the dorm rooms at the university, which was a hoot and a half :). Dirk and Jaq were available whenever we had any questions and their instructions in our correspondence were clear, detailed, and much appreciated. Had we had a few more nights, we would have loved to explore the unique shops that the lofts was surrounded by and also were noted in their binder of helpful notes. Would definitely love to come back the next chance we have!"
365550,23158902,2014-11-24,1803864,Ceilidh,"Dirk and Jaq were readily available and are very helpful, thoughtful hosts. They have a lovely, unique space that is comfortable, clean, and extremely convenient. If you're in town for a game, it couldn't be better. If not, you're still in a great location to explore the city. Couldn't be happier with our weekend in Seattle, thank you Dirk and Jaq!"
365550,23256360,2014-11-26,2515143,Brandon,"The building is very well located just a couple blocks from King Street station and so it's easy to find.  The arrival process is really simple, as the keys to get into the building and your room are in a lock box at the door.  The building and rooms are clean and quiet and have everything you need available.  I only stayed one night and so didn't get to explore the neighborhood too much, but it's a quick walk over to the waterfront.

I only met Jaq briefly in the morning before I left.  She was super friendly and seems very enthusiastic in her love for the city!

I would definitely stay here again!  Thanks to Jaq and Dirk!"
365550,23321497,2014-11-29,21272536,Fiona,"I have lots good things to say about this place. It was really close to the Link Light Rail station so getting there from the airport was really easy. There are also a good number of bus stops around the area which could bring you to almost anywhere in the city. And because this place was located in International District, I didn't have to worry about not being able to find food during Thanksgiving day. A good number of restaurants were still open despite it being a major holiday.

The room is as described and exactly like what you see in the photos. Nothing fancy but they have everything you possibly need for a comfortable stay. The skylight was a nice little addition. Also, even though the bathroom is shared, it's always kept really clean.

Dirk & Jaq were very good at leaving clear instructions on how to get into the building and so on. I got to meet them briefly and they are a very friendly couple :) 

Would definitely stay here again if I were to visit Seattle in the future. "
365550,23422942,2014-12-01,18014996,Daniel,"Nice little space which makes a good base for a short stay in the city, as ours was. Very close to transit to get downtown, but also with some nice spots nearby such as the very nice Japanese restaurant half a block away.

Well-supplied, clean, and comfortable. Nothing fancy – if you're looking for a base to use minimally while you go out and explore Seattle you couldn't (and probably shouldn't) ask for more. Seattle is very cool too!"
365550,23558644,2014-12-04,24168839,Julie,We loved the skylight above the bed!  Almost like camping under the moon.  Very peaceful room with nice fluffy blankets!  Thank you both!
365550,23630837,2014-12-07,20518698,Jasmine,I had a great stay at Jaq and Dirk's loft. Excellent communication and a clean and cozy space!
365550,23798260,2014-12-10,18562504,Elisa,"The loft is exactly how it's described and I really felt comfortable.  Everything is clean and organized, the bed is very comfortable,  kitchen,  bathroom and shower are also very clean and I felt very much at home. The international district is an ideal place to stay because of the bus stop,  restaurants and the closeness to downtown.  Whenever I need tostay in Seattle I'll try to stay there. Beautiful,  romantic,  central. ... Thanks to Dirk and Jaq for such a nice job!"
365550,23838486,2014-12-12,20287292,Stephen,"Great room in a very convenient location, just 2 blocks from the light rail station, and exactly as I expected from their posted description. I will be staying here again when I travel to Seattle, without execption.

The neighborhood near their building has lots of great eating spots. About 5 blocks away was a delightful place called McCoy's Firehouse.

I really enjoyed seeing Jaq's Art Studio, and listening to her describe her work."
365550,24011876,2014-12-16,23846129,Monica,Convenient and quiet place! Dirk & Jaq made checking in and out so easy! The room is great and cozy. I had a great experience.
365550,24082662,2014-12-19,23821334,Cecilia,"It's lucky to live in this area, lots of great food and easy to go to the attractions. The room is clean, and the bathroom is a public one outside the room with all the necessities. "
365550,24222932,2014-12-23,21968169,Samantha,We loved our time in Seattle and this accommodation was a perfect base for exploring the city. The extra information in the guide book in the room had some excellent tips for local restaurants too!
365550,24262921,2014-12-24,6654442,Tasmin,"The loft is accurately pictured and Dirk & Jaq leave ample instructions about everything, so nothing is unclear. The location is great if you wish to be close to Japan/Chinatown and a major public transport hub is only 2 blocks away. Unexpected extras such as umbrellas and bathrobe were very thoughtful of the hosts. The shared bathroom made it feel a bit like staying at a dorm, but it was very clearly described in the profile. The bathrooms were also incredibly clean. Bed was comfy."
365550,24310369,2014-12-25,8740723,Yi,Dirk and Jaq were great hosts. Their home was very comfortable and clean. Will stay again.
365550,24350723,2014-12-26,18365263,Nickie,Very nice -comfortable bed-easy in and out. Great location for international district/pioneer square/downtown.
365550,24924888,2015-01-04,8117331,John,"We had a great experience.  Dirk & Jaq communicate so well, making us feel confident and comfortable with getting into the room and using the facilities.  Location-wise, the room was perfect for going to see a concert at The Showbox.  The room itself had a cool layout with good lighting and temperature controls.  We enjoyed being in an art studio as well.  We passed by a few artists in the hall who were most cordial.  Slept sound and would stay here again.  Thanks, Dirk & Jaq! "
365550,25124927,2015-01-07,15373357,Alan,"Wonderful location! Though I never ran into Dirk or Jaq during my stay, I really enjoyed my brief night here in Seattle."
365550,25176667,2015-01-08,148408,Adam,"Though I was only passing through Seattle, I really enjoyed staying at Jaq and Dirk's artist's studio. Affordable, clean, and comfortable. Great location in Chinatown, close to both Amtrak and the Link light rail. I didn't meet Dirk or Jaq, but Jaq was very communicative and the many helpful notes around the space made navigating the space easy.  Would definitely stay again! "
365550,25197022,2015-01-09,9354901,Carlos,"Dirk and Jaq were great AirBnB hosts. Though we never actually met give our late arrival and early departure, checking in and out to their beautiful and very clean loft was easy. We enjoyed the skylit bed, simple yet tasteful decor, and very much appreciated the provisions of shampoo and soap. I highly recommend staying with Dirk and Jaq for future AirBnB guests."
365550,25312755,2015-01-12,13377362,Sarah,"Great stay, awesome price, cool space... loved proximity to amtrak station and ease of check-in, thankful for ability to drop off luggage prior to room check-in at 4. Building seems like a nice and generous community of artists. Thanks for opening it up to visitors!"
365550,25372822,2015-01-13,1971222,Cassie,"Jaq was very helpful and let me know before I arrived that she would be available for any questions.  The loft room was very comfortable and super clean.  And the location was great.  Close to the bus stop, the train station, the ferry terminal, downtown, and my friends in the International District.  I will definitely stay here again."
365550,25389732,2015-01-14,1600630,Ashley,"Though I was really looking forward to staying in this artist studio, I ended up staying with a friend in the area unexpectedly. I did end up checking in at 10 am though to take a shower, freshen up, and catch a quick nap, and the place was beautiful! Definitely an oasis in the midst of a busy city. Dirk and Jaq left extensive instructions/helpful hints, so nothing was confusing at all and I was able to quickly find everything I needed. Plus, I had a nice chat with one of the artists when I checked out! Finally, Dirk and Jaq were very communicative a helpful leading up to the stay. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a peaceful place to recuperate at the end of the day, and I'm looking forward to staying here in future trips to Seattle!"
365550,25539430,2015-01-19,23122561,Roger,"Dirk and Jaq's place in Seattle is awesome. The loft space is super cool and unique. More importantly, it is very clean. The location is very good. A block away from the Chinatown/International District station. There are a lot of good restaurants nearby as well. Highly recommended. So thank you Dirk and Jaq!"
365550,25625406,2015-01-20,3492484,Sandy,Dirk and Jaq are excellent Airbnb hosts. They set the high standard for communicating with their guests. Their space is ultra cool! Great location clean and really fun! This is where I am staying when I come back!
365550,25706535,2015-01-24,22584622,Daniel,"Jaq and Dirk were excellent hosts. Being my first time using Airbnb as well as my first visit to Seattle, I was unsure of what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised my the cleanliness of the space, the amenities they provided, and their constant communication. The room was stocked with towels, a bathrobe, Directv, as well as a list of restaurant and sightseeing recommendations that helped me a lot when it came to seeing Seattle.  The kitchen is also fully stocked with coffee, tea, dishes, and silverware. While there were other guests using the other unit, I hardly saw them, making me feel like I had the place all to myself.  Steps away from the stadiums, downtown, and virtually all forms of public transit, Dirk and Jaq's space is the perfect place to stay if you want to see the city. When I'm in Seattle again, I know where I'll be staying. Thanks again, Jaq and Dirk! 
PS: if you love coffee, go to Zeitgesit!!! It's the best I've ever had!!!"
365550,25810786,2015-01-26,18368903,Ashley,Dirk and Jaq's loft was a perfect place to stay for my friend and I who were in Seattle for a three day weekend. The loft itself was very clean and cozy. The bathroom is dormitory style where all residents share as is the kitchen but the facilities are very clean. The location of the residence was very convenient to go to all major neighborhoods and attractions in Seattle as it is 1-2 minutes (1 block down) from the light link rail station. They are very great at responding. Check in and check out times are prompt but they allowed us to leave our luggage in the kitchen area of the residence which was very convenient. Without hesitation I would recommend this place for any single or double travelers staying in Seattle! 
365550,25928722,2015-01-30,22086117,Chen-Wei,"Nice host, and great location!
Will definitely stay in this place again on my next visit!"
365550,25971581,2015-01-31,16051062,Kevin,Great stay again. The location is excellent and the accommodations are great. We will definitely stay at Dirk & Jaq's whenever we are in Seattle. 
365550,26166494,2015-02-05,22572322,Anthony,"Such a cool spot. Dirk & Jaq are so kind and accommodating ! Perfectly located, all the amenities you would need, and great people to boot. Perfect place!"
365550,26246246,2015-02-08,23640593,Danielle,Small but centrally located. Perfect for a weekend getaway 
365550,26339363,2015-02-09,27134550,Jennifer,"Although we were only there for a brief time, I do know we will consider it again when in the area. It was clean and comfortable, providing all you need. It is also quiet which can be very hard to guarantee at large hotels. Try the sushi downstairs at Tsukoshinbo."
365550,26351888,2015-02-10,1355037,Anne,"The apartment is very close to a tramway station from the airport. It's very convenient with lots of restaurants and a big supermarket nearby. And it's also very central in the city.
Everything was clean (bedroom, kitchen, bathroom).
Dirk&Jaq gave us very clear and detailed instructions in order to get to the apartment and there is also a useful guide book inside the bedroom."
365550,26398541,2015-02-11,26648983,Arlene,"The downtown Seattle loft was everything that I expected it to be. It was in a great, central location close to everything downtown. Dirk and Jaq had everything well organized and it was easy to check in and out of the loft. I would definitely stay here again. "
365550,26454929,2015-02-13,5110914,Mapita,"Excelente ubicación en el centro de Seattle. Conocimos todas las atracciones sin necesidad de usar el transporte público. Se encuentra cerca de todo si disfrutas caminar. La habitación es justo como se ve en las imágines, cama cómoda, el único incoveniente fue el ruido que hacen las puertas al cerrarse. Es muy privado, nunca cruzamos con ningún inquilino. Nuestro host siempre respondió pronto y fue accesible a la hora de dejar maletas en el sitio."
365550,26478451,2015-02-14,13832227,Brigette,"This place is just what the pictures depicted, a nice cozy studio space with a comfy bed placed in a loft! It was a great size for 2 to sleep and relax before we went out walking around the wonderful Seattle downtown. Dirk and Jaq left really informative notes all over to help know the space and how everything worked. This is a really great location for those that want to walk around and discover the sites of Seattle."
365550,26592673,2015-02-16,7673572,Leonora,"Third time staying at the loft, and still a charming place to stay. No surprises, everything is as it is described. Clean, comfortable, and central to all if you don't mind walking or taking public transportation. Helpful hosts and prompt communication. This is my go to place. "
365550,26703943,2015-02-17,11330923,Patrick,"Our stay at Dirk and Jaq's loft fit our needs perfectly. Their space was quaint, personal, and in a good location. They were very communicative and hospitable making our stay that much more comfortable. They definitely went above and beyond to be great Airbnb hosts. "
365550,26858403,2015-02-21,18357266,Anja,We had an amazing stay at Dirk's and Jaq's apartment.  It was right around the corner to Chinatown and close to almost everthing. We were walkig to every place we wanted to go and the central metro station is just a few blocks away. The room was great and the common areas really clean. Even if we didn't meet our hosts we got good instructions how to get to and in the house. I absolutely recommend to come here and Seattle is a really nice city. If I will come back one day I'll probably stay here again!
365550,26929199,2015-02-22,26245427,Maria,The loft was very comfortable and just what we needed for our one night stay in Seattle while traveling. The room was clean and the bed and couch were very comfortable. Dirk and Jaq made themselves available in case we needed anything and were very friendly and helpful.
365550,27390378,2015-03-03,11853458,Nikeisha,The place was in a perfect spot for us.  We were able to walk to several differently locations and enjoyed the chinese food in the area.  Very close to public transportation as well. We didn't have any problems with the neighbors/artists that were possibly sharing the unit at the same time.  Very cute space.  Thank you very much.
365550,27465484,2015-03-05,26924015,Donald,"As a first time AirBnB user, I must say that this experience couldn't have been better. Dirk and Jaq are great hosts who knows exactly what they are doing. The room was very unique, but a little cozy. Some basic supplies were provided, including toiletries, extra towels and blankets, and coffee (who couldn't live without caffeine?). It was truly lavishing to have access to all of these essential products.  Dirk and Jaq stayed in touch with me the entire length of the trip, as well as contacted me beforehand to discuss the checking in regimen. The process was so organized, and it was such a smooth operation. I also loved their sticky notes to help new residents with navigating the environment. Honestly a wonderful experience."
365550,27582706,2015-03-08,3062113,Chelsea,"The art loft is exactly how Dirk & Jaq describe it - and I found it to be the perfect place to return after two days exploring Seattle. It was very quiet during the weekend we were there, and found it to be very clean and well taken care of. The fast and detailed communication before and during our stay was much appreciated! "
365550,27852475,2015-03-13,27862491,Judith,"Information was provided down to the last detail.  Our stay was short, 8 :15 pm to 10:15 am the next morning but we had a great night's sleep.  The shared bathrooms, one with a shower and one without, were always available when we needed them.  We really appreciated the opportunity to store our luggage for the day.  The neighborhood concerned us at night so we didn't walk anywhere but we learned to stand near the very popular restaurant next door while waiting for a ride.  "
365550,27932762,2015-03-15,4263716,Nathan,The room is exactly as described. It's clean and cozy. It is a small room with very comfortable bed. Make sure you are aware the bathroom is not in the room. They are very upfront about this and was no issue for us. They provided a clean robe which was nice. This place was excellent in terms of location. Very close to downtown and easy to access both the Belltown and Capitol Hill areas. Checking in and out couldn't have been easier and no interaction is required. They also provide a nice guidebook of the area including maps. This was the perfect place for a short weekend in Seattle. We would gladly stay here again.
365550,28301132,2015-03-22,25643049,Phil Ann,"My best friend and I travel every 4years to a place we have never been. We picked this air
B&B to do something different this time.
We are in our 60s so probably not the average age of the normal traver. Using the entry key system which was a little low for us was hard, but after that, every thing else was
Great. We were up and out by 7:00. Back by
8:30 in the evening. The bathroom was amazing as it was just as clean as mine at home. We did not use the kitchen, but it was nice as well. We showered went to bed and was out again each morning. The doors are industrial and Fire safe. We felt very good there. We would have no problem staying
There again, if they would have us back.
It was very clean, safe,and quiet. I did not see the owners as we were gone most of the time."
365550,28597392,2015-03-27,25283363,Emma,"My experience staying at Dirk & Jaq's loft was amazing. It's a really quaint and low key loft. I love the artsy feel. The bathroom and kitchen were very clean. I really appreciated that they provided all the amenities plus free wifi! I would definitely come back to stay here. Not only is it a great location, but checking in and out was easier than ever. Thanks so much!!!"
365550,29083087,2015-04-03,30308057,Jonathan,"Thanks Dirk & Jaq !!  Our first airbnb experience went perfectly smoothly. Your place was immaculate, the heater had it nice and warm when we arrived, and your pre-check-in information was easy to follow. All in all, excellent. "
365550,29107870,2015-04-04,23404510,Heejeong,We loved our stay in the house! The house was clean and cozy. The hosts were very quick and friendly in responding to my questions and we really loved the location. 
365550,29407174,2015-04-07,6962916,Emma,"Check-in/out was very clear and easy
Loved the great Japanese restaurants very close to the loft
Everything was clean and all the amenities taken care of (soap/shampoo and coffee/tea etc)
The bed was very comfortable

We stayed in the loft closest to the kitchen and bathrooms and could hear the doors opening and closing and people walking in the hallways in the evening and morning so it wasn't as quiet a stay as we'd hoped. 

It was a great location close to the stadiums and walking distance from Pike's. "
365550,29621698,2015-04-10,9283722,Yeekai,"I enjoyed the neighborhood being close to chinatown, salumi, maneki, Elm coffee roasters and Kobe Terrace Park. Checking in was super easy and place was very clean."
365550,30378099,2015-04-21,8354583,Frank,"My girlfriend and I had a wonderful experience staying at Dirk and Jaq's studio loft.  The room was not very big but because of its high ceiling and a bunk bed like structure it felt very spacious and comfortable.  
The loft is conveniently located near the transit station that made getting around very easy .  
Though there were other  tenants working there in the morning we still felt a sense of privacy. 
Thank you Dirk &  Jaq for running a legit operation. We would definitely recommend staying here."
365550,30441965,2015-04-22,7520545,Amy & Chris,"Location was great but I'd look for something a bit more spacious next time and without a ladder to the bedroom. Was very clean, quiet and in a good area. Perfect if you aren't planning on spending much time in your room! "
365550,30501945,2015-04-23,28827244,Robert,"Great space, great location, and great people. Highly recommended. "
365550,30771092,2015-04-27,4411752,Mary,"This was a clean, well thought out living space.  I was able to get a response from Dirk every time I emailed him.  He had little notes all over the space which was very helpful.  It was as if he knew the questions that might be asked and he answered them there.  My knee was acting up while I was on the trip so going down the stairs in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom was a mindful time but do able. The restaurant across the street was fantastic and it was so wonderful to be so close to the transportation.  My only other critique was that my room was on the way to the bathroom and I could hear people walking by my room which woke me up.  But otherwise a great place!  "
365550,31034312,2015-05-01,27336406,Adrienne,"Very detailed instructions! Close, easy walk from train station. Very cozy, comfortable bed!"
365550,31119715,2015-05-02,30515512,Will,Dirk and Jack were outstanding hosts. Everything was extremely comfortable and as stated. We would definitely come back. This was a lovely experience as this was our first time using Airbnb.
365550,31516481,2015-05-06,28878250,Paul,"Room clean and comfortable. Hosts really helpful. Kitchen suitable for breakfasts but not really cooking dinner, but ideal for us as we sampled lots of local restaurants. We had a fantastic stay."
365550,31623390,2015-05-07,8864576,Laney,"I had a great experience, and the key boxes are fantastic for people arriving at odd hours. There were some people in and out of the kitchen and bathrooms (which are next to the room I stayed in) so very light sleepers may want earplugs, etc. Overall a nice, clean space and an easy and straightforward experience. "
365550,32024150,2015-05-12,21962193,Eric,"I never actually got to meet Dirk or Jaq but their space is wonderful. I came to Seattle for a work trip and their loft couldn't have been more perfect. Central location, modern feel, and tremendous upkeep. The directions left above the key holders was a big help as well. Thank you!"
365550,32182990,2015-05-15,22813911,Chuan,Cute place. The hosts were very considerate and helpful during my stay here.
365550,32475862,2015-05-18,14421107,Shauna,"This place was great - and pretty much on par to how Dirk & Jaq describe it. It was very clean, though a little small, perfect for a couple. I wasn't thrilled about the loft as getting up to use the washroom in the middle of the night made it kind of annoying. The place doesn't have any windows which makes it a little stuffy, but theres multiple fans and a vent in there which helps! 
The location was pretty great too - I wish we had more time to actually hang out in the area. We grabbed food at Ping's Dumpling House on our final day, but I read a lot of great places to eat around there that I would've liked to check out! It was easy to get to most parts of the city though - we walked a lot (the weather was nice) or used Uber!
Note, there's not a lot of long-term parking around. Street parking is free at night but only max 2 hours during the day. There were a couple lots nearby that had weekend deals which was nice, but a free parking space would have been awesome.

I'd definitely recommend staying here if you're in Seattle for just a few nights!"
365550,32489363,2015-05-19,19758062,Caroline,The loft had everything we needed.  Of particular importance was proximity to King St station for our early Amtrak departure.  Thanks.
365550,32818411,2015-05-22,29763251,Mingjie,"The place is very cozy, and clean(especially the public area, kitchen and restrooms)! Jaq is a very thoughtful person, leaving several small notes on the wall as if she knew what problems we would come up with! I got to meet Jaq twice, and her dog! ADORABLE! I don't have any negative feeling about this studio. The location is a plus --very convenient!"
365550,32957057,2015-05-24,259189,Andrea,"Dirk was very responsive and was kind enough to write to me to remind me about the trip.  We didn't see Dirk or Jaq but communication was really good.  I really appreciated the guidebook as well.

The location was fantastic.  It was 4 blocks from the train station and about 20 minutes walking from Pike Place Market, and really simple to get there.  We also walked to the Seattle Center.  That was about 40 minutes away on foot.

We went to the Fuji Bakery (2 blocks away) and got some delicious and beautiful pastries.  Thanks for that recommendation.

Guests should know that the only window is the skylight above the bed in the loft and that it's not possible to stand up in the loft.  (The pictures do show this.)  That didn't really bother us though - we're pretty agile."
365550,33249299,2015-05-26,7683792,Nick,"The loft was conveniently located a couple of blocks away from the Seattle light rail station, making the trip from SeaTac very easy. The rooms and bathroom were clean and everything we needed was provided! Dirk and Jaq were very responsive and quick to answer any questions we had about the check in / check out process. They even allowed us to store our bags on our check out day as our plane didn't depart until 10pm. "
365550,33650437,2015-05-31,23218946,Neil,"Friendly hosts, great price, and excellent location. Fantastic position next to King Street Station gave direct access to Pioneer Sq and Downtown, with Capital Hill just a brisk 20 minute walk away. Room was functional, and both room and common parts were always clean and tidy. Very professionally organized, with useful handbook, and very quick response to emails before and during my stay. Enjoyed bumping into artists working in the space, and appreciated being able to leave my luggage at the development at the end of my stay. Would certainly recommend!"

The room was clean and plenty of notes to help us find our way around.
Good location with a short walk to downtown and an even shorter walk to King Street Railway Station for our trip to Vancouver"
365550,34087400,2015-06-04,4327867,Sarah,"Easy check-in and clear communication. Walked just fine from ferry and 2 short blocks walk to rail station. Stayed here one night before early departure from Sea-Tac. Convenient, clean, comfy bed and lots of restaurants to walk to. No windows but skylight above bed was nice and perfect if just need a place to sleep in a great location. Thanks Dirk and Jaq!"
365550,34136658,2015-06-05,32018793,Allen,"The level of communication and instructions provided were outstanding. We were new to staying right in Seattle and the information on transportation from the airport to the ID were so detailed and took a lot of worry out of our experience. When we arrived we were allowed to leave our bags prior to check in which was a huge help as we had friends to catch up with. When we did check in, the instructions left throughout the building were very informative. The facilities and room were very clean and inviting (as described). I would definitely recommend to fellow AIRBNBers. "
365550,34187332,2015-06-06,13903164,Ken,"Jaq met us at the door early on the day of our arrival, and helped us park our things until the room was ready later in the day as planned.  The space was comfortable, quiet, and perfectly located.  "
365550,34271021,2015-06-07,4853670,Monica,"The loft is located in a 2 story warehouse space with multiple private rooms sharing a common kitchen and bathroom. The facilities are quite clean, however it does feel like a bit like a hostel or dormitory as everything in the common space is heavily labeled with instructions on house rules. There is no elevator from the building entrance to the loft, so you do have to prepare to carry all luggage up 2 large flights. In the loft itself, there is a very small seating area with a sofa and small desk. You then take somewhat steep ladder stairs to a floating loft area where there is a full bed located on the floor and a sunlight above, which can be very bright during summer solstice. The location is central, and within a short walking distance to both King Street Station (train) and International Station (light rail). Dirk and Jaq were highly communicative before we arrived, and provided detailed information in regards to the listing."
365550,34628148,2015-06-10,29962049,Justin,"All though I did not meet Dirk in person, Jaq was very cool and welcomed us in with open arms. Everything they outline in their listing is 100% correct. The space is very well kept and the location is amazing for your visit in Seattle. The loft is located in the International District of Seattle and is a 5 minute walk from all major public transportation that you would need to get anywhere in the city. My girlfriend and I were only in the loft to sleep and get ready for our time in the city, but our time spent there was rejuvenating. The bed that is located in the sleeping area of the loft is beyond comfy and the sky light above the bed is really cool! The living area in the loft is perfect for kicking back before your trek into the city. All though the restrooms and kitchen area are communal we felt like we had the entire place to our selves. Overall the place is perfect for the price and I would stay there again in a heartbeat! Oh yeah, Jaq is an amazing artist and don't forget to appreciate her art that she has hanging in the loft. "
365550,34740545,2015-06-11,19272719,James,"Fantastic location, just a short walk from the train station and the harbour front. Lovely apartment and all the space you'd need for a short stay. We arrived quite late in the evening after a long flight so didn't get to meet Dirk, but he had made great recommendations with his favourite coffee shop and the tea martini from the hotel bar nearby!"
365550,34937738,2015-06-14,13842967,David,"We stayed for only 2 nights and the studio was ideal for our visit and only 3 minutes from the Light Rail system. The location is great for getting to the Ferries too, and making the most of Chinatown. The shared facilities were clean and always available. We rarely saw other people who were staying or the artists in the building. We did meet Jaq though, who was very welcoming and we enjoyed hearing about her artwork. Our only concern, and it may have been tiredness after a long flight, the steps up to the mezzanine bed were shallow and in bare feet a little challenging. That said, it wasn't a problem and we enjoyed our first visit to Seattle. Dirk & Jaq responded to our requests promptly and helpfully."
365550,35103156,2015-06-15,32718170,Steven,Didn't run into anyone else there while on a short 1 night stay but the loft was great and the location was superb. 
365550,35285877,2015-06-17,24370152,Tim & Susie,"Everything was ready for us when we arrived, very clean, fans running to keep the place cool and keys available as stated. We didn't meet Dirk and Jaq in person. Location very convenient for centre of Seattle, easy to get to by train from the airport and shops restaurants and railway stations very close by.  "
365550,35450683,2015-06-19,28473721,Gabrielle,Jaq and dirk's loft was perfect for our stay. It was very comfy cozy and we were in walking distance from Safco field! I would gladly stay here again!
365550,35538970,2015-06-20,27340565,Vincent,"The overall experience was great, the loft was clean and Dirk & Jaq provided some great information for restaurants located in the area.  The loft was a short walk from the light rail, and getting there from the airport was  a breeze.  The neighborhood was nice, and it had a lot of great restaurants and cafes within walking distance. I would definitely stay with them again for my next visit to Seattle!"
365550,35649998,2015-06-21,30469958,Julien,"Nice room, accurate description, efficient checkin/checkout system. The neighborhood is convenient and very close to the train coming from the airport."
365550,35873447,2015-06-22,35819237,Theresa,The place was very clean and the host left copious directions for both the private and communal spaces. The location felt secure and both Dirk and Jaq were available via phone or email messaging. I would recommend this space for accommodation in Seattle. 
365550,35925966,2015-06-23,8360410,Elise,The location was perfect for catching an early morning train and also was an easy walk down to the Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market area. The bed was very comfortable and Dirk and Jaq have a great system to accommodate guests. 
365550,36040028,2015-06-24,16504519,Laura,I had a great experience at the art loft downtown. All was as listed and Jaq and Dirk responded quickly and efficiently with any help I needed. The bed was comfy and I was close enough to walk about downtown to find all the things I wanted to do or see. I will stay with them again! Thank you for the nice place to stay!
365550,36083054,2015-06-25,1682807,Quek,Accommodation was as described in the listing located at Chinatown in close proximity to many areas. Great food choices located nearby and host provided a very informative guide on airbnb. Shared shower was v clean and it didn't seem like anyone else was using the pl besides us. 5 mins walk from Intl district station which is also the pickup pt for boltbus to Vancouver. 
365550,36190189,2015-06-26,3476520,Sebastian,Dirk & Jaq were lovely hosts. We enjoyed the loft and the amenities were very clean and welcoming. I would recommend that you follow their guide book and eat at the sushi restaurant they suggested. It is truly a first class place.
365550,36357272,2015-06-28,23708875,Samantha,"The loft was exactly what I was expecting. The description was very on point. The only thing I can think of that was a disappointment would be the AC unit. I was only in the room at night to sleep but when I would be out all day and come back, the room's temperature would be at around 82. Of course, I did visit Seattle during the heat wave so I highly doubt it's typically like that. Other than that I would highly recommend staying here. The location was perfect! 

 Both Dirk, and Jaq are very nice and accommodating people."
365550,36872167,2015-07-02,15566602,Sarah,It was a cute space to spend a couple of nights.  The space is in a great location.   We were able to walk to everything that we wanted to check out in Seattle.  
365550,37144184,2015-07-05,30347492,Sandy,"Cute loft in an art studio. We stayed 4 of July weekend and happened to be there when there was a heat wave!  Beware the loft has no AC!  That was the only uncomfortable thing I can mention.  Other then that, it was perfect for me and my boyfriend.  We were in the heart of china town where there was really good Chinese food. Not too far away from 1 street and the other major downtown venues. "
365550,37448484,2015-07-07,28780379,Matthew,Everything thing was great and Dirk and Jaq were extremely accommodating. Thanks again- Matt and Emily
365550,37653732,2015-07-09,25493949,Jezrel,"Jaq was extremely accommodating and answered all my inquiries in record speed. I was also able to leave my luggage earlier than I checked in. My loft was just lovely, Room 17. She left many notes and information around the room which was great. The room itself didn't have AC but had an exhaust fan to let the cold air from the hallway in, along with two extra fans. Location was excellent, close to everything and great restaurants including a great Japanese place right across the street. Bathrooms were absolutely spotless and had a lot of free amenities so you don't have to worry about brining your own. Overall, a very wonderful experience."

"
365550,38248407,2015-07-14,25387219,Ross,"The flat is in a great spot, being super close to various transport links and close enough for a pleasant walk into the downtown area. 
The flat itself is lovely, the bathrooms are spotless and the bed is very comfortable. 
Would highly recommend and will look to stay again next time I'm in Seattle :)"
365550,38444801,2015-07-15,2107859,Parker,"Dirk and Jaq had enough information on their listing that it wasn't necessary for them to meet me in person.The listing is very accurate in it's description,loft sleeping,very organized and clean,lots of stairs to walk up.There are a number of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.I had dinner at Maneki,an excellent Japanese (website hidden)'s a few minute walk to the Bolt Bus Stop,which was important to me."
365550,38587475,2015-07-17,30327578,Yu Jin,시애틀의 차이나타운 근처에 위치했다. 건물이 있는 길은 스시집들이 즐비해 Japanese 타운 같기도 하다. 공항에서 접근하기는 좋다 트램을 이용해 한번에 올수 있다. 하지만 인적이 드물고 메인역 부근이라 그런지 여성 여행객들에게는 인근 거리를 다니기에 불안한 감이 없지 않았다. 
365550,39180382,2015-07-21,19807643,Nora,"Dirk & Jaq were the perfect hosts - very organized and detail-oriented. Instructions were clear and easy to follow; they were very accommodating about allowing us to store our luggage a few hours before/after our booked stay, which was very convenient. They thought of everything and left helpful notes and instructions in the studio and common areas so there were no grey areas. We enjoyed flipping through the guide book, which had helpful tips about restaurants and sights in the area. The Fuji Bakery is a must! Perfect chocolate croissants and strong espresso :-). We were car-less and enjoyed the great location of the loft studio; we could walk a few blocks to the Uwajimaya market or wander Pioneer Square or trek down to the waterfront/Pike Place Market. And we took the light rail to Sea-Tac, which was a breeze, even with a lot of luggage. The station is literally less than 2 blocks away and very conveniently located. Lastly, we loved the studio itself - everything was IKEA-minimalist and simplistic; clean and tidy and furnished well for our stay. You do need to climb into the loft to sleep, but we loved the layout (esp. the skylight) and felt that it was far superior to any hotel room we'd be able to find in the area and very reasonably priced. Overall, a great find!"
365550,39278940,2015-07-22,33108919,Nicole,All very straight-forward & efficient with notes in the room to explain everything (which was a great help as I only arrived at 10:30 at night). Jaq was always quick to respond to any messages starting from when I booked through to the end of my stay. Great neighborhood where I managed to do the last of my Asian food shopping before heading home and with easy access to Amtrak & the Link to the airport. 
365550,39592555,2015-07-25,1476784,Tim,"Great place. Very clean and centrally located. If you are arriving or leaving by train, it's perfect. It's also surprisingly easy to go north to Fremont or Ballard by bus. The stop is a block away. We didn't meet Dirk or Jaq face to face, but communication was good and everything was explained. We would stay here again. "
365550,39995610,2015-07-27,26167124,Andrew,Our hosts were very communicative and made our check in very easy. The accommodation was exactly as promised. Clean and comfortable. No frills but we probably spent a total of 12 hours in the loft. We came over for a ball game. Great place to stay- we would stay there again without hesitation. Thanks!
365550,40083424,2015-07-28,17251380,Oriol,Place was clean and listing was accurate- but you have to read it all such as the post-it notes all over the house. 
365550,40304927,2015-07-30,14194938,Davida,"Perfect place, perfect description. Couldn't have asked for anything more."
365550,40423356,2015-07-31,1435831,Jen,"We stayed at Dirk & Jaq's art loft a couple of years ago and were happy to return again for a brief stay on our way to Victoria. All was as we'd remembered - very professionally run, with clear instructions for getting in and out and an option to store luggage. The loft is very much as pictured, spotless, and located in Japantown, with some lovely restaurants within a couple of blocks. Great for folks flying in - it's a very simple single ride from the airport and only a few blocks from the closest Seatac train/transit stop. Highly recommend for travelers looking for a good value."
365550,41077015,2015-08-04,19502167,Carissa,"Had such a great time in Vancouver! The apt was in a great location, friendly hosts, allowed us to do laundry and store some food in their pantry. Highly recommend!"
365550,41190020,2015-08-05,1435831,Jen,"Third time staying at this charming, well situated loft. Great base for exploring Seattle and getting around on foot or by public transport. Highly recommend."
365550,41606378,2015-08-08,26119453,Oliver,"My wife and I loved staying here. Dirk and Jaq are so good with communication and never disturbed us. They were also very helpful. Their loft is in an awesome location, surrounded by many ethnic restaurants and some great coffee shops. This sets it apart in my opinion. It is just a few blocks from pioneer square and is extremely easy and safe to walk to anywhere in downtown. It is also just a block or two away from a bus stop that can take you pretty much anywhere. The light rail is close by. The loft is clean, well stocked, comfortable, and just great. We want to come back to Seattle again soon to stay in this loft. It was perfect. We would recommend it to anyone!"
365550,41997789,2015-08-10,29161922,Rhiannon,I felt well taken care of. Everything was as they said it would be. Very clean and comfortable. Loved the lofted bed and that coffee was available to be made. The location is very close to Pioneer square. 
365550,42113947,2015-08-11,13111961,Piotr,"The hosts made us feel welcome and were very easy to communicate with. The room is quite basic (no window, for example), but more than adequate if you're planning on spending your time sightseeing and enjoying all that Seattle has to offer. The bed was very comfy, and the room was clean. The bathroom and the shower were clean and easily accessible."
365550,42656313,2015-08-15,22076461,Christian,"Nice contact but rather Airbnb 'powerseller' than hosts in a traditional Airbnb sense. Also haven't met them personally. Post-its in every potential corner with almost every device: ""Don't do this, don't do that, please make sure,...."". A bit more trust in guests and personal involvement would have been appreciated. 

Room clean but partially already heavily used and relatively small. Location was ok (downtown in walking distance), certainly not the nicest and safest area but probably as good as it can get for this price in comparison to overpriced hotels in Seattle. Good Internet connection."
365550,43483380,2015-08-20,28528574,Eric,"When visiting Seattle, it's really a smart choice to stay in Dirk & Jaq's studio with great price, convenient location, clean room and nice host! 
It's exactly the same as their description. I am definitely willing to live in this studio again during my next trip to Seattle."
365550,43628134,2015-08-21,36212847,Colin,"Host's description was accurate down to the smallest detail, and entry and exit was easy. The space was welcoming and comfortable, and easy to get to from the lightrail and downtown. A+ would recommend."
365550,44090185,2015-08-24,26134312,Guan,"We definitely had the best slumber and woke up fresh daily. The loft was compact but very comfortable. It was very interesting to see little POST IT yellow notes advising house guests on the Dos and Don'ts ... I appreciate it as it really cultivate a communal living space. It was also lovely for the host to ensure there was milk and coffee, bathing products, utensils .... All in the effort to make our stay homey. We really love the tranquility and the superb location. "
365550,45268717,2015-09-01,38167710,Tamara,"This place was perfect for our 2 - day stay!  We loved the location as we could walk to all the shopping and restaurants downtown and in the Intl District. Also light rail to the airport was super convenient-a block away which was perfect for our early flight. The room was clean and efficient, as well as quiet.  The bed was really comfy and fans were strategically placed about the loft to keep air moving. Dirk and Jaq left clear instructions and great  suggestions. We didnt meet but they were great with communication - ready to help if needed.  The shared bathroom was really clean and there was no conflict with use of it.  We were very happy with our stay! Recommended."
365550,45432741,2015-09-02,42430860,Frannie,"Nicely furnished, private, and clean. Would recommend and return to this place. "
365550,45549650,2015-09-04,28762048,Elizabeth,We had a great time! The room was exactly as described and access was very easy. Thank you for the great AirBnB experience.
365550,45922532,2015-09-07,2179536,Nadia,"Only met the host when the television didn't work, easily and quickly solved.  Room met our needs however, though the bed was comfortable,  it is not convenient to climb down and use the bathroom in the hall  during the night.  Convenient to train station and plenty of restaurants around to serve your needs.  Worked out fine.  "
365550,46175089,2015-09-08,41116165,Rommel,"Everything pleasant and clean as described. It was different than some of our other airbnb experiences that were more ""homey"", but the art studio feel added character. The common bathroom was a little inconvenient but manageable for a one night stay. There was a lot of post-its for everything with do's and don'ts, so it was some what excessive and restricting. 

I appreciated the responsiveness from Dirk & Jaq. They provided us with thorough explanations of how to get access to our room and parking instructions. This is good for a one or two night stay."
365550,46467933,2015-09-11,32347012,Dean,"We had a great stay in Seattle, all enhanced by the loft! Only a 2 minute walk from the station (int. district). Everything was made really easy with the use of little labels everywhere, it made clear to us what was ok and what was not in this work environment. The room was great and the mattress outstanding! Would definitely stay here again if we come back! 

p.s don't let the shared bathroom put you off, we never had to wait and it was clean and spacious. "
365550,46714899,2015-09-13,37197298,Alan,"Everything was perfect, such a great location.  We had a wonderful time and we will definitely be returning again!"
365550,46976591,2015-09-14,37534908,Jay,Defintiely a comfy place to stay and very easy to communicate with. Very central to near places you want to go and visit in Seattle.
365550,47048007,2015-09-15,23745366,Pam,Great space and close to everything.  The loft bed was super comfortable.  Met Dirk and Jaq when we left bags before our stay.  Very helpful in giving suggestions nearby.  The space was super clean and comfortable.   If I'm ever back in Seattle will definitely say again. 
365550,47169277,2015-09-16,38849317,Andrew,"Our schedules didn't coincide enough to be able to meet Dirk & Jaq, but we had plentiful email communication before and after our stay and they were accommodating and communicative throughout. The place worked fine for our needs, a bit funky in all the best ways, with a loft, artsy backdrop, shared bathroom (though there are two, both spacious) and heart-of-downtown location. Had a kind of hip European vibe, which we enjoyed quite a bit.

Great location next to the ballpark and a gob of restaurants & bars; 20 minutes or so walk to Pike's Market. It being downtown, parking is a bit tricky, but manageable if you pay attention and have decent city wiles. Wouldn't recommend the elderly or infirm (or severely-under-the-influence) climbing the ladder to the loft, but for all other comers, it's a great spot at a very fair price. We would return!"
365550,47245045,2015-09-17,4761983,Sabine,We only stayed there for one short night. For our stay it was really good! The location is great and it's done up nice! Dirk and Jaq were really lovely hosts!!!
365550,47404902,2015-09-18,19005329,Lily,"The room is clean and quiet right in the downtown area. I met Jaq in the morning when i just arrived, she gave me a lot of info which brought much more convenience for me to explore the city. In general very pleasant stay."
365550,47631091,2015-09-21,32909766,Maria,The listing was accurate as described and we found the location with ease from the airport. We had a great night's stay and enjoyed the morning light from the sky light. The next day we walked easily to Pike Place from the loft. Furthermore parking was easy to find around the loft which worked out in our favor. 
365550,48078305,2015-09-23,9896629,Noel,Had a wonderful (short) trip up to Seattle and Jaq and Dirk's studio was a perfect home base! A 5 minute walk from the light rail which we picked up at the airport and 5 minute uber drive to Capitol Hill and Pike Place. I fell in love with the city and can't wait to return and hopefully stay at Jaq and Dirk's again!
365550,48194633,2015-09-24,28297389,Maggie,"We had a great time saying at Dirk and Jaq's unit.  It was quiet, clean, and pretty close to being as pictured.  There was alot of directions everywhere, which made us nervous.  But, after settling in, we ended up appreciating the guidance.  The location was perfect for getting on the train, and exploring the touristy parts of the city.  Would recommend. "
365550,48684930,2015-09-28,31416631,DIvine,"DIrk and Jaq were very prompt with responding regarding the reservations, questions, and concerns that we had during our stay. Grateful to have stayed at their loft. The location of the loft is in China town and close to the public transportations. It's 15 mins away walk to Pike Place market. The room that we stayed was clean and the bed was comfortable. Although, there were only 2 bathrooms which you have to share with others, so plan accordingly when you start your day. They also have a fridge for everyone to use but you have to label your food so they won't get thrown out. Overall, we had a great stay and loved our location. We fell in love with the city and everything that it had to offer. "
365550,48874750,2015-09-29,38099392,Dominic,"The loft is very accessible to our downtown office (good for me) and Union Station (good for everyone), which means it can be easily reached from the airport via light rail for a couple of dollars.  This also makes it easy to get around the city.  I didn't pay close attention when booking, and only learned upon arrival that the bathroom was common.  Some people are uncomfortable with this, so take note.  However, it was clean and worked out just fine.  The room itself was clean and comfortable.  The bed is in a little loft above the living room.  This is a little awkward so you had better be comfortable climbing the stairs which are more like a ladder.  Again, fine for me.  My only two minor complaints with the room are: 1) There are no windows and no external ventilation.  I would have liked some fresh air.  2) The only lights in the loft are two banks of track lights on the ceiling that light up the entire apartment.  They are great if you are going to perform surgery but maybe a little reading lamp would be more appropriate.  I traded texts with Jaq as I was looking for the iron.  She was quite helpful.  I actually bumped into her in the common area later in the evening and found her to be quite pleasant.  Overall, it was a positive experience and well worth what I paid in comparison to hotel prices.  I will stay there again the next time I make a trip to our Seattle office.  If I recommend it to my associates, I will be sure to have them read my review.  Many of them expect slightly higher-end accommodations.  However, the ones that keep an eye on our budget and don't mind share common areas, will appreciate the recommendation."
365550,48982957,2015-09-30,30759594,Geoff,"It as fortunate that Dirk was at the top of the stairs when we arrived. Firstly I was struggling with my glasses then struggling to find the door code!
We were much earlier than the official booking in time, we had arrived to drop off bags - having arrived by train.
Dirk opened the door for us and showed us in.
Our room wasn't quite ready, but he allowed us to put our bags in, and gave us a set of keys.
We then chatted about all manner of things, both the world in general and Seattle life.
Dirk gave us many recommendations and ideas for our day in Seattle. All very helpful.
Our room was a little two storey affair with a mezzanine floor to sleep on.
Downstairs we had a sofa and television and tables Etc. All very cosy.
The bed was very comfortable (I think the mattress may have been one of those ""Tempur"" type ones. Anyway we slept like logs. On the same landing and outside our door was a shared kitchen with access to a microwave, fridge etc. There were 2 shower / toilet rooms. Both were very clean.
We chose this BnB for its proximity to the railway station (an easy 5-10 min walk away), and the previous reviews. It suited our needs perfectly and we would not hesitate recommending this to any persons seeking accommodation close to the railway station."
365550,49218878,2015-10-02,7184516,Katie,"This was a fantastic Airbnb experience. The apartment is an excellent place to stay. There's a cozy lofted bed, clear instructions for everything, a nice hot shower, and an apartment that feels safe and tidy. Dirk and Jaq are clearly professional hosts. This place has the comfort of a hotel with the warmth of a home. Highly recommended."
365550,49446968,2015-10-04,19164441,Suzi,Very adequate and inexpensive.  Liked the idea of having shampoo and conditioner available.  Good emphasis on cleanliness (post it notes).  Thank you for the french coffee press and ground coffee.
365550,49786461,2015-10-06,41758889,Levi,"I was traveling to Seattle to watch a Seahawks game and I wanted to find an affordable place to stay that was walking distance to the stadium.   The location of this  place is perfect for what I needed; it was close to the stadium and just about 2 blocks from the light rail. Very close to a variety of different restaurants and pubs.
The room was clean and completely adequate for an overnight stay.
The communication from Dirk and Jaq was excellent. They responded quickly to any questions I had and were very clear with the instructions on how and when to check-in."
365550,49950456,2015-10-07,15411768,Gavin,"Ok. Easy to find, simple instructions.  Clean enough, Basic accommodation,  lack of unforced ventilation disconcerting,  a lot of fans to operate."
365550,50647717,2015-10-13,43175455,Johsuan,這是我第一次使用airbnb，有問題的話房東回訊息很快，房子很乾淨，位置也很便利，離火車公車輕軌站走路5分鐘，傢俱廚房應有盡有，並貼心的有許多紙條告訴你設施如何使用，但是房間在二樓要先爬一段樓梯上去，有拿大行李的話較不方便，房子的公共區域還有其他人共用，有時腳步聲有點大，衛浴在房間外面比較麻煩點，其他一切都很不錯。
365550,51116739,2015-10-18,31815236,Carlos,My girlfriend and I loved the loft and the localization is  very good!
365550,52054649,2015-10-26,41328018,Justina,"Dirk and Jaq were wonderful hosts! Facilities were clean, and we felt like it was a very safe, secure location, and the other tenants were respectful and quiet. Studio itself is in an extremely convenient place snuggled in the International District. We loved being able to walk a block to and from the light rail station. It was also close in proximity to many great restaurants, coffee shops, downtown Seattle, and the CenturyLink stadium. We caught a Sounders vs. RSL game and ran into Jaq on the way out, who kindly let us borrow an umbrella because the weather forecast predicted rain. Overall, a lovely experience! Thanks again for letting us stay!"
365550,52231497,2015-10-27,30037045,Sami,"Great, easy to follow instructions, with easy access to the place with the security boxes for keys. The space is exactly as advertised, with good space, flexible environment controls and lots of towels, blankets."
365550,52407860,2015-10-29,41324690,Kyle,"The owners of this room/loft were very nice and provided quick, helpful communication. 

The room itself was not terrible, but it was not what I expected.

First, the walls are dirty. The room could use a good scrubbing. Having dirt and scuff marks on all the lower portion of the walls just makes the room feel dirty. The linens were clean. The floor is particle board and painted gray. All in all, the rooms feels a bit like a hostel—which is not necessarily bad, should that be what you are expecting. We were not.

The most disconcerting part of this experience were the notes. Post-It notes. Paper taped to walls and objects. EVERYWHERE. Seriously. EVERYWHERE. There must have been over 100 notes. Don't do this. Don't do that. Hand written and on everything. It's like that passive aggressive person in the lunch room that has to leave a note on everything. That and a MANUAL of rules for the room.

The last straw was for me when I went to take a shower. There were three different notes IN the shower. One of them a full sheet of PAPER with a laundry list of rules ""Leave curtain open to dry... don't flood the room."" etc. And on a sheet of paper that had obviously been wet many times. I didn't even take a shower.

I wish I would have just spent the extra $40 and got a room at the MAX. Or even a Motel 6. At least there I wouldn't uncomfortable with all the notes. 
"
365550,52512742,2015-10-30,25841792,Jen,"Dirk & Jaq's place was fantastic! We unfortunately didn't get to meet them but their place was a perfect landing ground for us to explore Seattle and they were very helpful when we were booking and answered any questions we had right away. Easy to get to, great location, very clean. Great stay!"
365550,52647097,2015-10-31,28381879,Yajie,"First time Airbnb. Cozy place to sleep. Everything was nice organized and directed. Not fancy but good enough to pass a night. Didn't have the chance to meet owner, such a pity. "
365550,52816319,2015-11-02,35074765,Esthela,"It was the perfect place for my daughter and I to spend a couple of nights during our first visit to Seattle. The entire place was as it was described,very clean even though you share bathrooms and the kitchen is just exactly what you need when traveling. The bed was very comfortable.  The skyline in our room was a plus. Having the options of shampoos, conditioners and body gel was also a nice touch. 

The link light rail was exactly about a block and a half away from the place very convenient and economical way to travel to downtown and to/from the airport. We also use Uber couple times especially at night and the fees were less than $10 from downtown to the place.  There is a mini mart right across the street from the light rail station in case you forget your toothbrush or paste like we did. The restaurants around place are nice and good food.  

Our stay was amazing thanks to Jaq and Dirk for having this amazing place conveniently located at a great price. I would totally recommend this place to all my friends and I will definitely stay with them again! "
365550,53195530,2015-11-06,1262789,Justine,Good location. Walking distance to the King St. station and a short walk to catch the train to the airport. I chose this space specifically for the convenience of being able to walk to places like Pike's Place or public transport to see the Space Needle. 
365550,53762587,2015-11-12,4298037,Alyssa,"Excellent lodgings, conveniently located just a block and a half from the light rail to Sea-Tac airport. Great communication and easy entry and access to everything I needed, in a neat and very clean artists' loft space. Thank you, Dirk and Jaq, for your excellent hospitality. I will stay here again if I'm back in Seattle. Highly recommended."
365550,53812914,2015-11-13,44220664,Samuel,Great hosts! We had no issues! 
365550,53951365,2015-11-15,29001310,Cindy,Location is a block away from the train and aboit 10 min from the center. Clean studio big enough for two. Dirk was responsive to my questions and the neighbors were respectful.
365550,54137037,2015-11-16,23550405,Xueji,"Convenient to many attractions in Seattle. The loft is clean and tidy. Sharing the restroom is also clean, no worry about that! The host is friendly and easy going, nice day living the studio."
365550,54314755,2015-11-18,23550405,Xueji,"Picking up the key in the key box any time after 4:00 pm is convenient . The studio located in downtown area, the Sea Hawk football stadium are very nearby. It cost approximately 15 min driving to Space Needle, Pike Place Market, 40 min to Boeing Headquarter. So it is really suitable for the travelers. Seattle have endless rain in November, that makes us felt a little uncomfortable, however the heating machine warm room quickly, and our host had prepared the umbrella for the guest. I asked for help when there is a throne in my boyfriend finger, Jaq found needle and tweezers for us, she is a kind and easy going lady. Feel free to live in the studio and have nice trip to Seattle."
365550,54420035,2015-11-19,1456230,Bryan,"A perfect stopover point for my last minute business trip! Super super convenient, well run, clean and cozy, and right by the train - definitely bookmarked for future trips. Thanks for having me! "
365550,54958074,2015-11-25,49530065,Alremy,"This is a great place to stay. Though it might not exactly the same as what the pictures seem to be. Anyway, it's warm and comfortable room to stay while you visit Seattle."
365550,55017847,2015-11-27,5190430,Lee Ann,"We had a great stay in Seattle at Dirk and Jaq's loft. Although we didn't have the chance to meet, we were very impressed with the location of this listing and had a comfortable stay. Would recommend this listing to anyone looking to check out Seattle!"
365550,55365285,2015-12-01,32307595,Jessica,"Perfect location - so close to the football stadium! Very clean, cool, simple loft with a great skylight. Dirk and Jaq provided great directions and key pickup was a breeze. Be aware that the bathrooms are shared with others. Overall, a great stay! "
365550,55693633,2015-12-04,114107,Ronald,"Getting the keys was complicated but the directions are quite clear, so pay attention. Be prepared to stoop over and enter key codes down low to the ground. A flashlight would help. Once inside, the space and the bed are comfortable. It has an industrial art-loft aesthetic and it's clean and tidy. "
365550,56272097,2015-12-11,50333531,Brandon,"The hosts were out of town, but they let me know in advance. Directions were clear to get into the loft. It had a great urban vibe. Sharing the kitchen was the only odd part of the place, but there was plenty of places to eat around there. Walls were thin as you could hear everything around us and there was an odd rule of asking you not to store any luggage in your room. Not sure what that was about."
365550,56586302,2015-12-15,36036690,Andrew,"Dirk & Jaq were unable to be there to meet us but there was really good communication by Airbnb messaging and SMS text. The accomodation is small on first impression but more than sufficient, the shared toilet and bathroom is clean and well equipped. The room only has one window, a ceiling skylight which at first was surprising but possibly the reason that the loft is so well insulated from surrounding street traffic noise, being more or less in the centre of the building. For winter it was very warm and in fact sleeping looking at the sky is charming, and the bed is extremely comfortable. It is located in the international district close to the train stations for both Amtrak and the light rail to Seatac airport, and close to some fantastic Japanese food. Walking distance from the waterfront and the aquarium which is a must. Overall we enjoyed our stay in an incredibly convenient location."
365550,56670530,2015-12-16,28849208,Patricia,"We arrived, early, around 1:30 and Dirk was there, preparing the loft for our stay.  We felt instantly welcomed and were able to leave our bags there and go in search of lunch.  Dirk let us know we could come back after 2PM and all would be ready and it was! This was on Dec 15 and I was in Seattle to celebrate my birthday and this was also my first AirBnB experience! And now, all future AirBnB experiences will be based on this - it was that nice of a stay. Well located (right next to the International District and walking distance to Pioneer Square, shopping , etc). There's even a handy notebook filled with dining suggestions, etc. in the loft and we read through it and made mental notes of much of it! Would we stay here again? Yes! "
365550,56884830,2015-12-19,9767614,Carrie,"Great location, easy to get in, quiet and fun loft space. We were close your holiday event and wish we could've stayed longer to enjoy the International District!"
365550,57007713,2015-12-21,42106585,Samantha,"though we didn't get to meet dirk or jam during our stay i must say it was really great! everything was super clear and easy to understand and everything was clean and very nice. There were little instructions in the bathroom and the room we stayed in that were helpful and they even provided shampoos and body washes to use. As well it was in a good location fairly close to everything we wanted to see, about a 20 min walk from the public market. i would highly recommend using this airbnb. "
365550,57331252,2015-12-24,183398,Anna,"Dirk & Jaq's Contemporary Art Loft Downtown Seattle was perfect for a quick stopover in the city—> just 3 blocks from the King Street Train Depot, and a very walkable distance to Pioneer Square, Pike Place Market (no-brainers) and many local, more eclectic gems (cafes, shops, eateries, street graf etc.). The accomms deliver as pictured and advertised, with very detailed notes provided both upon booking as well as posted around the communal space. As a frequent traveler, I appreciated the ease of transaction, the thoroughness of communication, and both the styling and cleanliness of the accommodation itself—thanks Dirk and Jaq! **I'm starring this one for a return visit! 

Traveler's Tip: check out Elm Coffee Roasters and The London Plane just down Main (toward 2nd Ave S). Also: Spur Gastropub delivered upon expectation. Enjoy Seattle, folks!)"

6621924,35529150,2015-06-19,33296047,Lauren,"Tim was a great host. My friend and I made a spontaneous trip to Seattle and were able to stay at Tim's just a few hours after we contacted him. The apartment was quaint and quiet and had a wonderful view. It has all the amenities you need to stay for a few nights. The neighborhood of Fremont was also really nice! Had lots of great restaurants and was only a short bus ride away from Downtown. Although we never had the chance to meet Tim in person, he still made himself available if we had any questions about the apartment or Seattle in general. I would definitely stay here again!"
6621924,36335008,2015-06-27,3370,Andrew,"It's a great little spot. Cute and accessible. Plenty of room for 2 people, well accomodated, and a really short walk to Freemont. "
6621924,36606954,2015-06-29,1131042,Aaron,"Loved our stay at Tim's place!  Clean, great location, and stocked with all the basics (towels, coffee, etc.).  Strong wi-fi signal, which was great because I had to do a couple hours of work remotely.  He even left a couple beers in the fridge for us because we arrived on a particularly hot day.  He also provided a map of fun stuff to do in Fremont (we definitely second that recommendation for Paseo).  Would definitely stay again!"
6621924,37604631,2015-07-08,1234497,Tom,Fantastic flat. Great location. Particularly loved the terrace. Tim was really helpful and gave us lots of great tips. Would love to return
6621924,38183122,2015-07-13,271176,Paulette,"Tim is a very attentive and communicative host! He sent texts and made sure we had what we needed. His place has a great deck at entry that looks out over the city of Fremont. We enjoyed being close to all that Fremont, Ballard Queen Anne and downtown Seattle have to offer. Thank you !"
6621924,38950620,2015-07-19,14418796,Cherisse,"Felt very welcomed at Tim's place in Fremont, from welcome note at the front door to the local beverages in the fridge.  Enjoyed morning coffee each day on the lovely deck.  Tim's listing of favorite eats and drinks were great recommendations.  Location so close to bus line was fantastic for getting downtown on my own.  Tim was very communicative with information for me to find my way to the house and to the bus.  House was just as described... very cute and well stocked with necessities.  Slept well and enjoyed my stay!"
6621924,39197321,2015-07-21,31678420,Joangrace,"This was my first experience using AirBNB and I'm so happy with how it turned out! Tim welcomed my friend and I with a couple of local beers, a bottle of wine and an AWESOME list of best places to check out. The place was great and the location was the BEST!!! Walking distance to Fremont (center of the universe, troll, local art, and lots of restaurants). We stayed here during an uncanny heat wave but Tim was prepared with multiple fans since AC is unheard of in the area (or so we were told by local businesses. =)  

Tim was always available through text or email whenever we had questions. "
6621924,39559698,2015-07-24,38600126,Joseph,Great location. Responsive host. Excellent water pressure. Quiet and pleasant. What else do you need? 
6621924,39810806,2015-07-26,17862150,Rune,"Kleine Wohnung im Haus von Tim. Seperater Zugang von außen.  Könnte mal eine Renovierung vertragen.  Aber sauber. 
Gute Lage in der Nähe zum Lake Washington und div Lokalen. 
Tim war ein super Gastgeber.  Per Mail immer schnell erreichbar.  Auch vor Ort, aber nicht aufdringlich. "
6621924,40140364,2015-07-28,35261115,Ning,"Centre of the world-Fremont! Sunday market is really recommended, walkable! Tim is so kind to prepare the wine and coffee and the Go-to-list, especially the cutest board! Loving the location, quiet enough!"
6621924,40673536,2015-08-01,39450911,Maria,"Tim is a great host. Everything was perfect during my stay in his upper floor apartment. I realy liked that beautiful veranda on the rooftop - nice place to sit with your laptop or to have dinner and so on.
I appreciate his willingness to help in different situations.
And it was a pleasant surprise to find coffee, choclate, and a complementary bottle of wine!
Thank you guys!! "
6621924,41642387,2015-08-08,37968676,Dan,"I can't say a bad word about Amanda - she was helpful, always in touch when needed and she went out of her way to make me feel comfortable!

The place itself isn't super lavish, but has all you need and you get what you see in the pictures. No unpleasant surprises. "
6621924,42294864,2015-08-12,38021209,Arielle,"We had a great time here! The apartment is exactly as described: It's very sparse, but clean, and it has everything you could need for a few days. It was quiet and peaceful. Amanda was great - always available to answer our questions or help us out. We loved the chocolate, fresh plums, and coffee she left for us. And the bikes are a big plus - you can bike (or run!) almost anywhere in the city via the trail that's two minutes from the apartment. We would stay here again!  "
6621924,44192120,2015-08-24,22820855,Ryan,"To be frank, I was very disappointed in the cleanliness of the house. I expected to see equivalent quality to the photos, but instead immediately felt overwhelmed in the lack of hospitality. The hosted loft was ill-prepared, and an apparent lackadaisical thoughtfulness; a stocked but dirty fridge, the ""coffee that Seattle is known for"" was a container of French coffee with maybe two scoops left, empty shampoo bottles, dirty cupboards, and unswept floors. 

The house would have been wonderful to stay at, if it just would have been as advertised."
6621924,44970406,2015-08-30,3464837,Sam,"Me and my girlfriend loved our stay at Tim and Amanda's unit. They were really welcoming, leaving us chocolate, wine and local beer in the fridge. They also provided us with info for public transport options and left bikes out for us to use.

The place itself is comfortable but bare bones, don't expect to be cooking three course dinners here but with so many local dining options it hardly matters. The neighborhood is unbeatable as far as I'm concerned, 10 minute walk to Fremont Coffee Company and dozens of cool bars and restaurants.

I'd highly recommend this place for a couple checking out Fremont, we were thrilled with the experience."
6621924,49486912,2015-10-04,9093488,Jesse,Very quiet and cozy. Having access to a bike was very convenient. 
6621924,50688034,2015-10-13,45159415,Chris,"Tim and Amanda's place was awesome!  Tim was super communicative, very helpful, and a really nice guy.  I definitely plan on coming back.  The white board with the welcoming drawings was fun and quite frankly, welcoming!  The beer in the fridge was also a nice touch!  For me this place was perfect.  Many thanks!"
6621924,52629275,2015-10-31,46644895,Kari,"Tim's place is just as you see it in the photos. It was a little chilly, and the outlets needed to be reset a lot when I plugged things into electricity. But the location is great (and it's quiet) and Tim went out of his way to make my stay great: use of a bike, coffee, chocolate, wine... So welcoming! I would stay there again."
6621924,54162794,2015-11-16,47775014,Richard,"Great location in Fremont. Tim, the great host, made sure I felt at home (chocolates, beer in the fridge, nice welcome message, map of places to visit and see) and even borrowed me a bike.

The place was slightly chilly at night (November, cold and rainy weather), but there were heating units available that helped."
6621924,56609419,2015-12-15,34515820,Shawn,A big thanks to Tim and Amanda for all their help in making our stay wonderful.  This is a great spot! 
2986056,22191686,2014-11-01,21200830,Juan,"The place is great. Brand new, lots of working space a nice kitchen and good people. Bikes are free to borrow, and helmets are provided.
As a hack space it's only starting, but it seems that i'll kick off soon. "
2986056,22805949,2014-11-15,22511035,Francisco,"The house is beautiful and very comfortable, I met great persons there even though summer was over. From the moment of my visit the house was still far from the concept of a ""hackers house"", there are no events and no special effort on achieving techie interaction. So in general I would try the other house next time, I was kinda disappointed on that perspective."
2986056,44299851,2015-08-25,18671240,Joana,I was not the one who lived in the hacker house but my sister. It was a great learning experience for her and it was a stimulating environment. 
2986056,52725257,2015-11-01,36079833,Renee,A comfortable house with friendly and interesting hosts. Would stay again!
7239217,39466847,2015-07-23,350996,Kim,"Jonathan was an extremely gracious host. He was prompt in our inquiries, gave wonderful restaurant and bar suggestions and even brought over an A/C unit incase the place got warm. It's a decent 10-15 min Uber right from the city but quiet if you're looking for a peaceful time. The yard is huge and right next to a terrific park for dogs and children. The bathroom is small, to say the least, but we really appreciated the sulfate-free shampoos. We thought the best part of the location was the cityscape view of Seattle from Alki beach! "
7239217,40656287,2015-08-01,28062575,Peter,"This is an amazing place to stay in Seattle.  I stayed here for a week when moving to Seattle, and it was perfect.  The cottage is very nice and located super close to Alki beach and down town.  It was very clean and the kitchen was stocked with lots of essentials that really helped during the stay (salt, pepper, olive oil).  %100 recommend to anyone."
7239217,41143605,2015-08-04,17014363,Andy,Wonderful little cottage right in between the airport and downtown. Jonathan was more than accommodating when my girlfriend requested some items for the place. It was a record setting heat in Seattle when we went; Jonathan made sure we stayed cool with a fan and portable A/C unit. He was quick to responding to my texts and made sure we were happy. Everything was clean. Great experience! 
7239217,41463273,2015-08-07,38575901,Patrick,"The listing for the Cottage was spot on. I loved everything about the Cottage. It was comfortable, cute and satisfying. It was incredibly easy to settle into the Cottage. All the living areas in the Cottage are comfortable, soft and lush. Jonathan was great at providing me information about the Cottage and Seattle. It was wonderful coming back to a home that was comfortable after a long day out seeing the sights. 
There is so much to see around the Cottage, the neighborhood is very real and cute. There is amazing coffee within a walk or drive. There is a beach that has amazing shops, beaches and food. 
The Cottage is a short drive from downtown and very easy to get to. Parking was no issue. 
The guest book at the Cottage is full of ideas of things to do and see.
If you need help ask Jonathan, he is a great host and offer great suggestions."
7239217,41539402,2015-08-07,764722,Erin,"Adorable cottage. Great space for couples or duos and so dog friendly, which my dog and I really appreciated! Short drive to all the restaurants and cafes in West Seattle. Thanks again for having us!"
7239217,43804312,2015-08-22,12331487,Danielle,"Jonathan's home was a nice space and very clean. The bedroom with the queen bed and fold-out couch were very comfortable. Check-in was easy. Jonathan was very easy to communicate with, friendly, and very quick to respond. We loved having a washer and dryer in the unit! You don't get that with many listing so that was a great amenity. The bathroom was tiny, but if that's not a big deal to you then this is a great place to stay.  Thanks Jonathan!"
7239217,45179439,2015-08-31,22553936,Paola,My friends and I had a great time staying at the cottage. It was really cute. We especially liked the couch that turned into a bed. My friends said it was really comfortable. The place was only about a $15 uber drive from downtown Seattle. West Seattle was beautiful and I would love to visit again. Thanks again for a great stay! 
7239217,45855619,2015-09-06,42230281,Marjolein,"Jonathan reacted promptly on my messages. Check-in and out was very easy. The cottage is cute; the bed is very comfortable and the kitchen well equipped. The bathroom is very small, especially when you are tall.
For our visit the location was perfect, quiet and close to everything, you need however a car or bus for grocery shopping.
The wifi worked very well.
Thank you for your hospitality."
7239217,48078584,2015-09-23,39543803,Ellen,"We enjoyed our stay at the Cottage on the Park.  The location was great; there is a mini mart and a yummy pizza place just a couple blocks away you can walk to.  There are also some cool walking trails behind the cottage too! Jonathan was very welcoming to us and our pets, which was great, because its hard to find a private Airbnb that takes pets.  It is a great place to stay if you want to be close to the city, but far enough from the city where it is quite and peaceful at night.   "
7239217,49573624,2015-10-04,45548270,Beth,Thank you! Thank you! I appreciate your willingness to accommodate our last minute stay. Your cottage was adorable and comfortable. We had everything we needed and appreciate all of the thoughtful details. I will recommend your cottage to others!
7239217,55989809,2015-12-07,680336,Kim,We had such a great time at the cottage! Our dog loved being so close to a park and trails! Jonathan was very responsive and accommodating!
7239217,57885154,2015-12-30,4716190,Timothy,"We loved the cottage! Great location next to a pea-patch and several parks, and a small hike from Camp Long, one of my favorite parks in the city!"
2593176,11208031,2014-03-24,11283634,Lena,"Quite close to Downtown, one can even walk - but a bus station is really close as well. We went down the hill towards Downtown and back up we took the bus ;-)
 The room has everything you need for a City Sightseeing Weekend. 
Paul was very nice and welcoming. 


"
2593176,12306364,2014-04-28,13207432,Jason,"Paul was a terrific host. He made himself available to address all of our questions before and during our stay and was a genuinely nice and friendly person to talk to about the city of Seattle. The location of the home was in a great and vibrant neighborhood and the bus stops to get around elsewhere in the city were just a few blocks away. My friend and I would stay here again, without hesitation."
2593176,13154045,2014-05-20,13829204,Adrienne,Great location. Perfect setup with a ton of privacy. I would definitely stay here again!
2593176,13696974,2014-06-02,15451997,Samantha,"We really enjoyed our stay at Spring Street Center. Fabulous location for such a great price. Paul was available anytime we had questions, which I really appreciated. The space was clean and comfortable. Thank you so much for such a great stay. "
2593176,13973711,2014-06-09,15474853,Allison,"This was a great place to stay.  The neighborhood has plenty of shops, restaurants, and bars, and this house is within a few minutes' walk.  The house itself is well-kept and on a beautiful, quiet block.  We had everything we needed!"
2593176,14212547,2014-06-14,16343726,Gilbert,"Great location in Capitol Hill, convenient, very clean. I'd definitely stay here again."
2593176,14624926,2014-06-23,15690034,Sonya,"Spring Street Center Room 4 was a great experience for me and my husband.  The location was excellent for those visiting Seattle.  The room was clean and relaxing.  There was a place for us to do our laundry which made our stay very convenient.  I would highly recommend this b&b for anyone looking for a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay while visiting Seattle.   "
2593176,15059230,2014-07-01,16066442,Eddie,"Thank you Spring Street Center for housing us this weekend! This was a great location, walkable to great area for restaurants and nightlife. Room was clean. Shared bathrooms were also clean. We didn't have much interaction with other guests or members, but we were out and about most of the time. Did meet Paul, who's a very nice guy. Thank you again for a great stay!"
2593176,15195488,2014-07-04,17135201,Yifan,"Friendly host, clean place. Rooms get hot on a hot summer day."
2593176,15323722,2014-07-07,15721709,Daniel,Great place! Quiet neighborhood and still walkable to bars/restaurants on Pine. Host communication A+. 
2593176,15540188,2014-07-11,16484400,North,"First step that I came into the house I told my friend It's so nice house and very beautiful and then I go upstairs to room it's just a small room but it have everything that make you're comfortable. Paul, host he is the best administrator. He always take care and look for you. I don't meet him but I know he is the really host. "
2593176,15853746,2014-07-16,17960807,Eric,"We had a great time staying at Pauls house. The beds were good and the people were very friendly. Paul even gave us a private tour around some points of interest of Seattle, which was really great."
2593176,16199969,2014-07-23,10334139,Joshua,"Paul was a great host. I met him on the third day of our stay and he's a really cool guy. The room was cozy but had a good amount of storage space. The only things different from the picture were no head or footboards on the beds, no chair (there were plenty downstairs though) and the TV was on a stand instead of shelf. Although there was no cable, there was a roku with Netflix and a DVD player as well as a good selection of books that should satisfy your needs. The house was very clean, plenty of coffee and tea available. The room can be hot at night, but there were several fans in the room. I had no issue using the upstairs shower. The location was great, being right next to the 2 line, we could get to KeyArena easily. Would definitely stay here again."
2593176,16382679,2014-07-26,18588548,Jillian,"Great experience! The house was quiet and clean and the room worked well. As soon as I booked I got a call from Paul to welcome me and give me some recommendations on places to eat which I really appreciated.

Thanks Paul!"
2593176,16475360,2014-07-28,6991416,Cindy,"What a great location!  Several of my friends also traveled to Seattle the same weekend I was there, and I gotta say they were pretty jealous of my location.  Paul walked me thru the check in process step by step via phone when I arrived.  He made me feel at home right away and is very friendly and professional.  If you're looking for an economical and centrally located option, give this place a try!  Plus it's only 2 blocks to one of the best breakfast places in the city, Skillet.  The cinnamon rolls are literally the size of your head."
2593176,16908859,2014-08-04,11355911,Jazzy,It's great place to stay. The room is very cozy. And living room and kitchen are well furnished. Bus stops are within walking distance.
2593176,17521908,2014-08-13,5548571,Chelsea,"This is a good little venue in Seattle; it's close to the 2 and 12 buses which go into downtown; a stone's throw away from the Skillet, which is a great restaurant for any time.

The balcony is amazing, and is one of my favorite features.

This could be fact that four days before we were supposed to come, Paul went on vacation, but we didn't receive any phone calls, any check-ins, or felt very welcomed by the signs around the house. I go to AirBNB for a personal, human connection in where I stay, and I didn't feel that here."
2593176,17713101,2014-08-16,4674983,Patrick,"The place was quiet and clean, and the location was great. "
2593176,17828293,2014-08-18,16220479,Jai,Location is great! There are some really nice areas to eat and wander around within walking distance. The room is simple but comfortable enough. Bring some earplugs just in case you share the place with noisy neighbors. 
2593176,18187569,2014-08-23,17574015,Jan,"Paul made us feel at home and welcomed. We only had a short time to do some sight seeing since we were there to play a tennis tournament; we were at the club all day most days. Paul worked around our schedule and I'm sure we saw more of the city than we ever could on our own or even with a professional tour guide. The house had every amenity we needed, very clean and well stocked with household items.  The neighborhood was safe, parking a little tricky but we managed. House had 4 bedrooms that were rented and even showering and toilet time worked out for everyone. Had it been hot at night it could have been unpleasant since there is no a/c but there were a couple fans we used even at that. I would definitely stay again in the future especially since it was so convenient to the club where we  played."
2593176,18566025,2014-08-28,19305391,Seung-Sub,Very clean room and bathroom. Good neighborhood. Close to downtown (about 7 mins by bus). No breakfast though.
2593176,19042139,2014-09-05,20076246,David,"The location is pretty great. It's nice and quiet and is very close to an awesome brunch spot (skillet diner). It's about a 20 min walk from DT so not too bad. 
The room was nice and clean and there is a Roku with netflix available! Also, the bathroom is kept clean and there are fresh towels available. Paul was friendly and invited us to his wine and cheese party during one of the nights.
Thank you Paul for hosting us in your delightful little place."
2593176,19237098,2014-09-08,9064580,Giovanni,"Place was as posted and I expected to be.
Great deal for Seattle prices, maybe 1 bathroom to share in 4 rooms could be busy in the morning.

But what made the difference was Paul.
Thanks bud, it has been we were best buds!

What a great, funny interesting person!
What a bonus :)

thanks for everything!"
2593176,19441862,2014-09-12,23888,Chloe,Easy stay in a great location. 
2593176,20045384,2014-09-22,8802617,Tod,"Before we arrived Paul suggested we switch rooms to Room 2 for a double bed instead of 2 twins since my girlfriend and I were staying at the house!  Also, Paul allowed us to store our luggage in the downstairs closet since we were arriving before check in!  This was great.  We could then spend the day exploring Seattle without lugging around our bags.  I will definitely stay at Spring Street Center next time I am in Seattle! Thanks Paul!"
2593176,21296420,2014-10-14,21146970,Craig,"My daughter and I enjoyed our stay very much.  The room was as presented on the site: very clean and pleasant.  Wonderful kitchen!  Appreciated the on-site laundry machines which were modern and easy to use.  

The house is near unique shops and cool restaurants.  My daughter especially enjoyed being near a Trader Joes.  Bus lines were easily accessible.  We would definitely come back again!"
2593176,21946002,2014-10-27,1554637,David,Paul was very considerate and helped out when he needed or could. 
2593176,22570762,2014-11-09,23400811,Mike,Very straightforward! Great experience! Just what you need to make your vacation work.
2593176,25110533,2015-01-06,21668286,Bonnie,"Nice stay, first time at a spiritual center"
2593176,25669141,2015-01-22,20769083,Kirstin,"Paul was very welcoming and responsive in our email communications. It was easy to find the house and settle ourselves in. I loved the location, so easy to find good groceries and hot food at Madison Market (food co-op) down the street. And it was remarkably quick to get on and off the freeway, which was very helpful, since I needed to go to a meeting in the Greenlake area for three of my six days visiting Seattle. (Probably important to have a GPS or a copilot using the map app on their smart phone though, the first time figuring which streets to turn on.) 

I appreciated the thick white towels, the clean bathrooms, and overall tidiness. We didn't actually meet Paul during our stay, but had some nice chats with the other two people staying there."
2593176,28102497,2015-03-17,11355911,Jazzy,I booked this for my friends. Great place and great location. They had a great time:)
2593176,28783770,2015-03-30,16008113,Loren,Another great stay at Spring Street. Very reasonably priced. Located a short walk to downtown and surrounded by some of the best food in the city
2593176,29344264,2015-04-06,8309763,Pearl,"My friend and I stood for a week and we loved the house! We shared the two twin bedroom. It had plenty of space for our plethora of luggage. :) Plenty of restaurants, cafés, and grocery stores within walking distance. As well easy access to the bus stops. Although, it was a tad hard at times to find all-day parking it wasn't impossible. The house had four rooms rented out at the time and we never seemed at all crowded. Multiple bathrooms really helped. We had full access to the kitchen and even got a reserved shelf in the fridge. The house was clean and we always felt safe. We would totally recommend it to all and would love to return in the future!! "
2593176,29944194,2015-04-14,18114325,Roel,"The Spring Street Center was at an ideal location, and the facilities were meticulously clean. Though we didn't get to meet Paul, we could tell that the hosts really cared about making their guests feel at home by the excellent state that everything was kept in, and the extra amenities that were provided. An example is the coffee/tea station, access to multiple bathrooms/showers, a kitchen, balcony, and the fact that we were allowed to leave our bags for a few hours after check out. "
2593176,31393594,2015-05-04,25638320,Manuel,Beautiful house and a nice community
2593176,31606805,2015-05-07,3190062,Alfredo,"I enjoyed my stay at the Spring Street Center. I recommend to stay here because it is clean, it is near good restaurants, grocery stores, public transit, etc… In general, it is well located and well maintained from the Airbnb perspective. Also, Paul and Rachel were very responsive in the case that I needed something for example extending my stay for another day. Excellent place to stay when visiting Seattle!

2593176,32580142,2015-05-19,32171631,Angela,"The host was super responsive and the property is exactly as described. Although there were 4 rooms being rented out in the house, the other guests were super respectful. There were no issues sharing the one bathroom upstairs, and I liked the downstairs bathroom too. Location is within walking distance to loads of stuff. Good place. "
2593176,32787353,2015-05-21,32376071,Genesis,"The neighborhood was fun, safe, and close to everything! Super close to Seattle university and many bars and restaurants well still being in a quite neighborhood. Instructions the host left were clear and to the point! Would definitely stay here again! "
2593176,33693825,2015-05-31,27852771,Carol,"I didn't get the opportunity to meet Paul in person but his instructions along with the ones posted throughout the house made it easy to know the rules and what is expected of the guests. There are bathrooms and a kitchen that is shared with the other guests, but I hardly ever saw or heard the other guests. 

The location is easily accessible by public transit but is on a bit of a hill for those who have trouble walking. Paul responded quickly and was set on providing the guests with a positive experience. My father and I definitely had a positive experience at this location.

I would stay here again and recommend this location to others. "
2593176,33946313,2015-06-02,1507287,Bev,"The centre is more like a hostel, with notes in the kitchen charging for coffee or tea, notes in the bathroom telling you to keep it clean, etc.   We never met Paul, our host, during our 2 day stay, although he was quick to respond if we emailed or texted him.  We would have benefitted from having a person at the house, or an information sheet."
2593176,34161574,2015-06-05,34196205,Tingting,"Great hostel experience! the room is clean and well managed. Even though we didn't meet Paul, we still feel welcomed. "
2593176,34543685,2015-06-09,28887969,Raúl,Great location and nice neighborhood. 2 thumbs up. ..
2593176,34737211,2015-06-11,34650285,Ammar,"Very comfortable and clean living space.  Host was very quick to respond and he was very kind and considerate. I very much enjoyed my conversations with him.
The location was very centralized with a lot of good eats nearby. Bus stops are easily accessible for trips farther downtown.
 "
2593176,35116543,2015-06-15,31175562,Jeremy,"We had a great stay! It was fairly easy to get to from the airport and we arrived around 8pm. Check in was easy.

The room was nicely decorated and comfortable for the 2 of us. The restroom was extremely clean and there was soap and towels provided.

Paul was friendly and prompt when responding to the few questions I had during our stay in Seattle. Overall we enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend it. Thanks for having us Paul!"
2593176,35337455,2015-06-17,34930959,Griselda,"This was a great stay. We had a little mishap upon arrival there were two guests already staying in the room I booked, luckily it was sorted out quickly as the guests agreed to move to room 3 and there was no problem. I couldn't reach Paul at the time but I think that was just due to the late check in on our part around 10. I'm sure if we had arrived earlier it would have been sorted out. For the room mishap I think it was just a language barrier miscommunication. Other than that our stay was smooth and great! The place was clean and cool, air conditioner in our room(#4) as well as a nice view. I liked having a key and the area was great. Paul was very kind and sociable. Would not hesitate to book again. "
2593176,35808433,2015-06-22,31935226,Deborah,"Pleasant surprise, the pictures do not do justice for the overall experience. The room was as pictured however it was a pleasant surprise to be fully furnished with a closet that included hangers, two dressers, a full and half sized mirror, a desk accessorized with dry flowers, jewely stand and a lovely little lamp. The room had tons of natural light beaming and was adequately surrounded by trees providing privacy. There is a patio deck off the side on the second level that was perfect for morning breakfast or sun bathing. It was a quiet place even with all the rooms booked. There are clear expectations for the home and it was a peaceful, pleasant, and well maintianted guest house. This was a five star place if you are rating it on ""hostel and lodging"" scale."
2593176,36111141,2015-06-25,545048,Kyle,"Paul had great communication, and the location was a perfect spot to get anywhere in town quickly. "
2593176,38495690,2015-07-16,33163660,Yvonne,My son and I enjoyed our stay very much.  The home was peaceful and pleasant as well as comfortable and clean. Great location which allowed us to explore so much.  Our hosts were very pleasant. I would definitely recommend staying here.
2593176,38841367,2015-07-19,32873617,Mandy,The room was nice and comfortable. We really enjoyed the neighborhood and being able to walk to many good restaurants. It was unusually warm in Seattle while we were there and the fan in the window worked great.
2593176,39383597,2015-07-23,33163660,Yvonne,"My son and I enjoyed our stay so much we came back!  The place was wonderful.  Nice and clean.  Great location!  We walked all over as we explored.  I would highly recommend you visit soon!
"
2593176,39676204,2015-07-25,3359038,Becky,"My mom and I had a nice stay at Spring Street Center. Paul met us at the house to show us around. The room was comfortable, and just in case it is warm, a fan is available. Though there are four bedrooms in the house, we never had a problem getting into a bathroom. The kitchen was clean and had all the necessities. The house is located in a quiet, safe neighborhood. If you are the walking type, you can get to the waterfront without much trouble...almost a straight shot and 30-40 minutes. I would definitely recommend this place to others. Thanks Paul. "
2593176,40335643,2015-07-30,12347704,Caroline,"We love our stay at Paul's and we would definitely recomand this place for visiting Seattle. The house is clean, very quiet and close to downtown. Paul was also very kind and advise us on some activities in the area."
2593176,40751697,2015-08-02,28136461,Lunarosa,The room was fantastic! Paul was very quick to respond and the neighborhood was just as lovely as we imagined. We got to meet Paul briefly and one other guest but for the rest of the time the Spring Street Center was very quiet and empty when we were around. It was absolutely perfect and if I ever come back to Seattle--I hope to book again for sure. 
2593176,43231519,2015-08-18,34023191,Chris,"My brother and I stayed at Spring Street Center for five nights from August 12th-16th. Upon arrival we quickly noticed a stream of noisy airplanes flying over the house. I immediately contacted Paul and asked if the area was under a flight landing path. He said he thought so and that Seattle was 'noisy.' This was rather odd as the neighborhood is described as 'quiet' and no other reviews mentioned airplane noise. Noisy airplane traffic continued throughout the day and night disturbing our sleep. It almost felt like we were lodging next to an airport. We contacted Paul the following morning and he said we were the first guests to comment about plane noise and that there was nothing he could do. He added we'd need to get far from urban centers to be free of industrial noise and suggested earplugs (a jar of earplugs was later provided for guests). We thought about finding alternative accommodations but it was challenging on short notice and we decided to stick it out and hoped things would quiet down. All told, the first three days/nights were very noisy and it was hard to sleep, even with earplugs. Paul said there appeared to be a runway under repair and that some planes were being re-routed to the airport. He invited us to stay again during off-season but since we had paid for a 'quiet' accommodation we asked for a partial refund instead (the last two days/nights were relatively quiet). Although he said he would need time to review the situation we didn't hear back from him. Other than the noise issue, the accommodation was clean and comfortable, as described. The first floor has a quaint funeral home vibe. It's convenient to many fantastic cafes and restaurants and just a 25-min walk to the downtown area. "
2593176,43500267,2015-08-20,2089837,Tamsin,"We had a fantastic stay here! Paul was a warm, hospitable, communicative, and kind host and his property was incredibly clean, cozy, and in a great location. My husband and I slept like a dream every night we were here and it is very clear and apparent that this property is well taken care of and that Paul is proud of it (which he should be!) The price was incredible for the city, it was within walking distance for everything we did for our whole trip, and we had no complaints for our entire stay. Thanks so much Paul for a wonderful experience and we will definitely be back!"
2593176,44292376,2015-08-25,29092487,Anna,The room was fine. It was not walkable to seattle but the busses were great. There was a wedding during my stay but paul informed me that day. During the meditation times (religion) i was not allowed to leave the room wich was a little hard on the sunday because i slept in and missed the time to leave the house. Paul provided everything like shampoo and coffee (1$). I liked my stay it was calm but if you want something close to the city you should find something else.
2593176,44647743,2015-08-28,34884694,Sheena,"My friend and I very much enjoyed our stay! The house was very clean and comfortable and the neighborhood was very nice and easily accessible to public transit. Although, I do suggest spraying some WD 40 on the upstairs door hinges, as they were pretty squeaky throughout the night. Overall, the experience was great :) "
2593176,46147687,2015-09-08,3379857,Samuel,"The house was clean and there were plenty of towels, washcloths,etc. No one was there to greet us, but it isn't a typical ""home"" and no one lives there full-time. The neighborhood was quiet and the location was only one block from our family member who we were there to see.  Overall, a good experience in a convenient location."
2593176,46528315,2015-09-11,24738478,Jeongmin,"He is really nice host. It was my best experience at the air bnb. Good and clean house, nice location, and perfect host!"
2593176,46723518,2015-09-13,5542495,Ericka,"The place was good, clean and quaint w a calming view. It's set on a quiet and safe neighborhood. Parking was hard, but not impossible. Instructions were clear and communication w Paul was no problem.
Toiletries are provided and some extra towels are available if needed. We had no problem w the location as our choice of transpo was to drive. There are four rooms in the house, never had a noise problem nor bathroom issues. The only thing would be the beds as they weren't as comfy and kinda squeaky when you toss and turn but other than that it was a good experience. Thanks, Paul."
2593176,47368081,2015-09-18,39613158,Thomas,"This room was really great. Everything was clean and the the house is in a great district. For great food you never have to walk more than 5 minutes, which was probably the best part of the apartment."
2593176,47704165,2015-09-21,39256825,Ludivine,"We are a short time in Seattle and the house has a very good location.
Room 4 was clean like the house. 
Thanx Paul. 
Ludivine & Jeremy "
2593176,48233937,2015-09-24,8740923,Jon,"I always enjoy staying at the Spring Street Centre.  Paul is quick to reply to questions, and things are always as described.  I look forward to staying here the next time I'm in Seattle."
2593176,50298473,2015-10-11,27374254,Mellissia,"I stayed in room 2 which was immaculate and just as shown in the photo. My stay was for 12 days, so I especially liked being able to use the kitchen facility and having a designated part of the refrigerator for my food items. Paul was great about returning messages and offering any assistance, if needed. I will definitely want to stay here on future trips."
2593176,51832364,2015-10-24,36120485,Gary,"Nice, clean room at fair price. Kitchen available. No breakfast. Several good restaurants in easy walking distance. Parking difficult. "
2593176,53802541,2015-11-12,41502389,Jordi,Thr whole experience was nice. We enjoyed ourselves in Pauls place. We were alone in the house with plenty of space and everything was convient and well explained in the house. However there was an issue with my arriving details and I was left hanging out the house really late in the morning. Be sure that both parties communicate that info well.
2593176,56372504,2015-12-13,45857342,Bonnie,Thank you for a wonderful home-like experience.  We were so happy with the overall accommodations.  It was lovely to warm up a cup of tea at night and relax in the kitchen/dining room area while working on the computer.  The location is ideal for visiting my daughter.  Thank you for your hospitality!
2593176,57934367,2015-12-30,33072245,Yao,"Paul is very friendly and helpful. The room is very comfortable and make us feel at home. environment is quiet and safe, close to university of Seattle and bus station and many sightseeing spots. This house makes our trip perfect!"
5297143,26577349,2015-02-15,2055847,Cara,"Matt was a great host. He was prompt in communicating and his apt is in a very nice part of capitol hill.. I would recommend his apt. to travelers on a budget who would like to be near the center of the city but just far enough away from the commotion.  Cheers, Cara"
5297143,35687447,2015-06-21,6004515,Connie,"Matt gave very good details on locating his apartment (written instruction and photos) and on the check-in process. He answered my emails immediately and was attentive to a couple of questions that arose.

The location is great and and the living room/ dining area in the apartment is spacious. "
5297143,41962921,2015-08-10,33893234,Rob,"Don't stay anywhere else in Seattle!
Matt was a great host and his place is perfect.  My wife and I were in Seattle for 3 days before heading to Vancouver, then on to Whistler.  Matt's apartment in Capitol Hill was very comfortable.  The perfect place to call home.  Right across the street from an amazing park.  A 10 minute bus ride, with a bus stop right out front of the apartment, to all that needs to be seen in Seattle.  Plus a 10 minute walk to the heart of Capitol Hill to enjoy the city's best bars, restaurants, shopping, and sunsets.  Matt's local knowledge had us all dialed in for an amazing 3 day stay. 
We will be back.  Thanks again Matt for your help with an incredible trip!"
5297143,53500545,2015-11-09,27208623,Kate,"Matt was a great host! The apartment looked just like the pictures, Matt sent a great instructional email with pictures attached and made it super easy to find the place even at 10pm at night coming off a flight. The location was perfect- right next to Volunteer park, free parking, close to so many great parks and views and restaurants and bars. We had a great experience with the apartment and would highly recommend it to anyone. "
5297143,55008652,2015-11-27,5556849,Jasmine,"My daughter (age 14) and I had a great time staying at Matt's place. It was very nice, clean and comfortable. We enjoyed the art and photography on the walls. The apartment was lovely. Across the street from where the apartment is is a really beautiful park.

The neighborhood was perfect for us. We walked just a few blocks down to a really cute neighborhood within Capitol Hill, lots of places to eat and shop. We walked down  further and had more restaurant, coffee shop and shopping options. We walked even further and enjoy the walk to Pikes Place Market and enjoyed the other sightseeing that was available in the area. 

I would highly recommend staying here. I completely fell in love with Seattle. Matt was a great host and he was very friendly and helpful. I have nothing but good things to say about my stay. "
430609,25567877,2015-01-19,25752725,Jessica,My friends and I had an amazing time in Seattle! The house was better than the pictures and in a great location! Not too far from the downtown area and in an area with great food choices! 
430609,27621342,2015-03-08,2105090,Seth,perfect stay in seattle:  killer location just a block away from great food like paseo and uneeda burger; amazing new house with new furnishings; fantastic roof deck.  host was responsive to our needs.  would definitely return.
430609,28012318,2015-03-16,27448268,Yang,We self-check-in to the house because we have arrived to Seattle in the midnight. The furniture and exhibitions in the house are awesome with great taste.
430609,29854197,2015-04-13,3718718,Zachary,"What a nice place! In my favorite part of the city (near my favorite cafe Vif!) 

The place was gorgeous, warm, and inviting. Immaculately clean, super modern, and the sunrises from the rooftop deck are stunning.

Great kitchen!! 

Loved the off street parking and it only took 10 minutes to drive to the heart of downtown. Housemates easily got around the city by bus. 

Seth was a great host and checking in was super simple. Thanks, Seth!
"
430609,30465869,2015-04-22,17298841,Chris,"The space was perfect for my group. Wonderful kitchen, and a totally underrated view and location. Roof-top deck had views of Rainier and the Cascades, and amazing restaurants Roux & Paseos located just down the street. Also a funky coffee/wine bar with the smoothest espresso I've ever had.

Definitely a fun space and I'd be down to stay again!"
430609,32177414,2015-05-15,30721993,Victor Zi Hao,The overall stay was good. The location is quite convenient and the condition is clean. Highly recommended.
430609,36371532,2015-06-28,8839140,Kelly,"we had a great stay here. seth was very gracious w/ suggestions on restaurants, neighborhood advice, etc. after a long day exploring the city in 90° weather, we arrived back to the condo to find a new fan for us to use. very thoughtful!  and what an awesome space -- during the warm nights we were there, it was fantastic to spend evenings on the roof deck and watch the sun set over seattle.  highly recommend this space!"
430609,38849591,2015-07-19,34095484,Alex,"We loved the place. Great neighborhood and great house. Very convenient location, within walking distance to nice restaurant and a lovely grocery store. Private parking space is very helpful. "
430609,39740294,2015-07-26,28309819,Rachel,The house was beautiful and in a perfect location for what we needed.. When we arrived we realized there was no iron and one fan was broken but we emailed Seth and he had both an iron and a fan delivered to the house by the next day! He was very prompt in returning any emails we sent and we would definitely recommend him for anyone looking to rent a house 
430609,43439215,2015-08-19,33350058,Brittany,"It's a very nice house for the vacation of the whole family! It's very clean and brand new! My daughters love staying in the house! The owner prepare almost everything you think about it, very convenient! So sure , if we're back to Seattle, it's our first and right choice!"
430609,43892405,2015-08-22,24681814,Larissa,Nice stay. The 3Bedroom are big and clean. The kitchen is good which let the house like home. The house is new and clean. The most important is self check in is most convenient for us. Don't have to follow the time to check in with host. 
430609,46909156,2015-09-14,5139968,Amanda,The house was great.  We had a wonderful time and really enjoyed the rooftop deck.  There was plenty of space and the house very clean and comfortable.  It is within walking distance of a lot of great restaurants.  I would definitely recommend this place.
430609,49531905,2015-10-04,174610,Brian,"What a great house, in a great neighborhood. Great restaurants in walking distance, with easy access to the freeway. Downtown in 5-10 min. Will be back again."
430609,51816753,2015-10-24,16833752,Polly,"Thanks Seth for a fantastic stay at your lovely house. It was exactly as described and the photos provided an excellent idea of what it was actually like inside. I stayed there with 2 colleagues while we were attending meetings in Seattle. The location was really convenient, with lots of restaurants a block away and a short walk down the hill to lovely Fremont. The grocery store 2 blocks away was great also. The house had everything that we needed, well stocked and decorated to a really high standard! A comfortable bed to come back to after a long day working and the lovely roof deck provided a great view to relax on while sipping a cold drink! Will definitely be recommending this place to others, and hopefully use it again in the future. Thanks again for a fabulous stay."
430609,55862553,2015-12-06,29232105,Cameron,"Seth's place is truly fantastic. It's in a great location that was convenient to a lot of Seattle's best attractions. The roof deck was great and has pretty excellent views. I don't think Seth cares for larger groups on the weekend, as it took a bit of convincing that my friends and I weren't going to trash the place (8 of us were coming for the weekend)...but I guess this is understandable (albeit never happened when I've used AirBnB elsewhere). In total, this is a great steal and would definitely stay again. "
430609,56311298,2015-12-12,5927418,Lucy,"Seth communicated well.
We had a wonderful stay, the house was clean and had everything we needed.
It was near many great restaurants and a great coffee shop 2 minutes away."
241016,9172694,2013-12-10,3719771,Melissa,I had a wonderful stay! This location is right on the Rapid Ride D and 32 lines.  I was easily able to go back and forth to the downtown on the D line as well as Fremont area on the 32.  The room was comfortable and warm.  I appreciated the space heater and extra blanket the 2nd night as it was really cold in Seattle.  I had full access to the kitchen which I didn't end up using and the bathroom was next to my room!  Everyone in the house was friendly and it was nice to chat about the area and where I was going.  They gave me great recommendations on bookstores too!  I would definitely stay here again!
241016,28897655,2015-03-31,47628,Ski,"Well represented and charmingly appointed home. Very comfy for settling in reading or daydreaming, but also in a great location for exploring the city. Maija was sweet,  and quick to respond to all communications. I would definitely recommend this home, and would gladly stay here again! "
241016,31247292,2015-05-03,8960530,Emily,"Tucked away in Queen Anne, Maija's home was the perfect getaway for my family and I to spend the weekend. Maija was such a thoughtful host, with impeccable taste and her home was such a peaceful haven after a day of adventuring in Seattle. The location ideal for quick and easy access downtown and to the heart of Ballard. Thanks Maija! Until next time!"
241016,33277282,2015-05-26,64967,Elvis,"Maija had excellent communication, listing was as described, if not better. Very quiet calm area. Plenty of parking. "
241016,33748082,2015-05-31,6676149,Erica N John,Thank you so much for opening your beautiful home to is!!!  We very much so enjoyed our time!  Everything was as described and the view was beautiful!  Thank you for everything and we will for sure be back
241016,34984845,2015-06-14,33571604,Kim,"Maija's home was wonderful - it was a great halfway point for us between Ballard and downtown. It's a bit tricky to find, but Maija's directions made it easy.  The beds were comfortable and we had everything we needed. For the price, it can't be beat! "
241016,38520223,2015-07-16,9605959,Jenn,"Maija's home was lovely! The three of us had room to spread out and enjoyed coffee in the morning and drinks at night in her tranquil garden. We were glad for the French press and kettle. Wish we had made use of the outdoor fireplace, but maybe next time. The location was good, a short walk to Whole Foods. We had a car so didn't use public transit but saw the buses on 15th...seemed like a convenient location for anyone without a car."
241016,40768971,2015-08-02,36587798,Scogmo,"Really cute, nicely laid-out house in an OK neighborhood of mostly apartment buildings. Considering where we wanted to go and the prices and availabilities closer to Downtown, it was a fine location for us. We always felt safe. It was clean, beds were comfy, living room with TV and breakfast nook were inviting. The side ""yard"" wood patio with mature shade plants and futon was great, we spent considerable time out there reading. Parking's a little tough if you come in late; sometimes walked one or two blocks. Host was very accommodating. Chen's take-out is awesome!  We used the central AC and appreciated it! Walked to bus line."
241016,44188471,2015-08-24,26466171,Kathy,"Great Host, great location and great house. "
241016,44960811,2015-08-30,40491126,Derek,"We had a wonderful experience staying at the Scandinavian Queen Anne! The home was beautifully decorated and cared for with lovely charm and ample natural light throughout. The beds were comfortable. The side yard was a real treat! It was the perfect setting for a relaxing evening with outdoor string lights and comfortable seating - lush plants and privacy. The house is a little tricky to find at first, but the neighborhood is close to downtown with street parking nearby. We'd definitely recommend it to others. Maija was so helpful to ensure we had everything we needed. Thanks for a great stay!  "
241016,46769165,2015-09-13,41205938,Courtney,"This was a beautiful home and Maija was a wonderful host - so accommodating, helpful with suggestions and available by text during our stay.  Relaxing in the garden seating area to the side of the house was a trip highlight.  FYI, it's about a $12-$15 cab ride to downtown from the house, but the RapidRide bus is very easy & accessible from here as well.  Thank you Maija for sharing your gorgeous place with us!"
241016,48301241,2015-09-25,7597785,Richard,The house appeared warm and inviting as described. There is a abundance of personality in the decor. The yard appeared lush as it had recently rained. We were soon comfortable and planning our stay in Seattle. The neighborhood was mostly residential but within 2 to 3 miles of most major attractions one visits. We were so comfortable that one or two nights venturing out became difficult. Would love to stay in this house again.
241016,48654126,2015-09-27,2375039,Julia,We stayed for 2 nights at Maija's house and enjoyed it a lot. The house is old but tastefully arranged and decorated. The kitchen is comfortable and well-equipped. The neighborhood is nice an quiet. We enjoyed the beautiful  view from one of the rooms  in the house. Maija was very responsive and gave us clear directions. 
241016,50138530,2015-10-09,1109327,Ken,"Maija was very responsive in her contact with us, and the location of her house was great in terms of access to the rest of Seattle. The house is older as shown, and has lots of charm that way, but things like plugs/outlets are fewer, as you'd expect in a house like that. Being from the droughts of CA right now, loved all the plants/garden, and the view over the golf course. Overall a very nice place to stay at its price point..."
241016,50331795,2015-10-11,43876866,Megan,"What a cute house!  The style and decor was very eclectic yet the place felt very warm and welcoming.  Great central location to get to downtown, Fremont and Ballard neighborhoods.  A great place for the price"
241016,55436965,2015-12-01,29130804,Cindy,"We could not have been happier with our stay! We spent almost as much time hanging out here as we did exploring the city.  The space occupies the top level of an older home, nestled into a hillside.  Consequently there are fabulous views from a large glass sleeping porch. There is no off street parking but we had no problem finding a convenient spot. However, the street is a bit narrow and can only accommodate parking on one side.  

The location of this rental was perfect as well.  It is very convenient to Pike Place Market, Downtown, Seattle Center and the UW campus.  The surrounding neighborhoods also have lots to offer in terms of shopping, bars and restaurants.  In addition, there is a Whole Foods just minutes away that makes it easy to have some meals in.  

This is a really lovely older home with beautiful woodwork and lots of personal style and charm. Our host Maija was thoughtful and responsive in the rental process.  She also gave us great directions, as getting there can be a bit tricky with GPS.  My husband and I stayed here along with our two teenage daughters, and had a such a nice experience.  Highly recommend! 
"
241016,57494494,2015-12-26,30233140,Susie,"we never met Maija, but she was very concise with her directions to the home and how to get in and also how to log on the internet. "
3372535,15834970,2014-07-16,17125324,Nandini,"My very first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been better.  The house is beautiful and very comfortable. Mary thought of everything and thoroughly spoiled us. We reached the house late at night and were greeted with a warm welcome, home made lemonade, freshly baked cookies and other snacks. We woke up every morning to the smell of more freshly baked goodies, a variety of fruit, yogurt etc. Pretty much anything that one might want to eat and the offerings were not limited to breakfast. Mary is a very thoughtful and generous hostess and does everything she can to make the stay as pleasant as possible.  Mary is also very sensitive to the level of interaction her guests desire and gives or holds back accordingly. Everything in the house is well organized and easy to find. Nice big yard with plenty of lounging space. Easy parking in the neighborhood, conveniently accessible public transportation. Good wifi all over the house.
Mary boarded her dogs but we insisted she bring them home. The dogs are big but very sweet and well trained.  We look forward to our next visit to the House of Light."
3372535,16219707,2014-07-23,17134793,Shelby,"My two friends and I stayed here for five days, and we absolutely loved our stay. The beds were so comfortable, and the rooms were larger than I expected. I also enjoyed the surplus of amenities - new towels, cold water bottles, toiletries, and the snack baskets in each room. Finding parking near the location was easy as well. 
Mary was an excellent, thoughtful host; she made sure we felt at home, gave us directions to Seattle's places, and because we always missed breakfast with her, she even made us lunch bags with homemade goods :) Even though we didn't really have the time to use the kitchen or the living room, she had planned out everything in advance, as seen evident in her post-it notes. She was very open minded and we loved all our interaction with her. The dogs were adorable and everyone got along well! And the apples were a plus. 
Despite being my first airbnb reservation, my stay at the House of Light exceeded my expectations. If I were to choose between this place and a hotel room, I would definitely choose here. My friends and I look forward to staying here again in the future, and I would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Mary for your excellent hospitality!"
3372535,17060890,2014-08-06,17435343,Phil (Anastasios),"This was my first airbnb experience and Mary Sanford made it fabulous. We just returned from a five day trip to Seattle.  The ""house of light"" was just as described: a home away from home.  The location is in a quiet and park-like setting area, which provides easy access to downtown and Seattle at large.  Columbia City is easily accessible and has many places to eat and shop.  We rented a car and followed Mary's suggestions for sightseeing and otherwise: outstanding tips and resources!  Overall, we had a great experience. "
3372535,18495261,2014-08-27,2335835,Langtian,We had a great time at Mary's place. It was clean and very large. The ac worked well when we needed it. She has bottled water and some snacks which were great since we arrived late in the night. This has been the best airbnb experience for me! Thanks Mary!
3372535,19033405,2014-09-05,14085929,Yun,"My parents and I really enjoyed the time that we stayed at Mary's place. The location is very convenient for driving. And I also want to say that Mary is a very nice person and advisor!
"
3372535,22411134,2014-11-05,22694418,Gregory,"My wife, daughter and I had a wonderful experience staying at Mary's home in Seattle this past week. We have never used airbnb before, but will certainly consider it again in the future after seeing how well it can work.  We wanted a place south of downtown Seattle and Mary's place was perfect.  Mary bent over backwards to be sure our stay was enjoyable and we had everything we needed for the visit.  The highlights were the wonderful baking she provided every day and the hospitality of her two dogs which we loved.
Thanks for everything Mary, Stretch and Joey!"
3372535,25722443,2015-01-24,24151918,Jeffrey,"This is my second time staying with Mary and her two friendly dogs.  Mary is always a welcoming host.  Upon arriving at her place after a long drive, I was greeted with her freshly made treats and calmness to help wind down for the day.  Mary really goes out of her way to make sure that guests are comfortable and this was true during both stays at her home.  Over the week, she made great meals and generously offered them to me.  We had a great time celebrating the win of the Seattle SeaHawks as well as enjoying the bright and fun home that Mary creates.  Thanks Mary!!"
3372535,26697082,2015-02-17,11542188,Callum,"Mary was a great host. It was more like staying at a bed and breakfast. Baked goods galore. 
I would recommend a visit to Mary in Columbia city. "
3372535,27183285,2015-02-27,24151918,Jeffrey,"Mary's description of the apartment is completely accurate and even better.  This is my third time staying with her and she always exceeds in making sure our guests are having a great time, staying comfortable, and enjoying the space she shares.  She is a very talented host with a whole array of culinary skills and treats that she always shares.  Additionally, the space is always positive, bright, and happy.  Mary's two large dogs are friendly and warm.  They always find ways to amuse themselves and entertain the guests.  "
3372535,27416805,2015-03-03,24151918,Jeffrey,"This stay was an extension of my ""third visit"" to Seattle.  Once again, Mary provides a very comfortable, clean, and bright space that is warm and happy.  She's very attentive to how the guests feel about the space and will do everything to make sure everything goes right.  Mary is definitely a very great host and someone to share insightful conversations with.  She has plenty of information brochures and maps she's collected to give guests ideas of where to go should the rest of the tourist activities in Seattle are completed.   "
3372535,27422828,2015-03-03,22027065,Emilie,The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3372535,31601665,2015-05-07,31661886,Kelly,"Mary was a great host! I stayed here with my boyfriend for our first airbnb experience and she made sure it was awesome. Her home is comfortable, clean, and convenient to the city. Mary gave us tons of tips on places to checkout around Seattle. She also made sure we were never hungry, packing us snacks for our daily excursions and baking all kinds of goodies during our stay. She really bent over backward to make sure we had a great time. "
3372535,32724263,2015-05-20,13477842,Peishi,Mary had been a wonderful host to me and my friend during our stay with her. She gives great recommendations for places to visit and good food in Seattle and even took effort to prepare daily breakfast for us though it's not included. We didn't drive during our stay there but downtown is accessible via public transport - there is a bus stop walking distance from Mary's place that brings you to the link station to downtown. Had lots of fun interacting with Mary and spending time with the 2 dogs too! Definitely a great airbnb experience for a dog-lover!
3372535,34318554,2015-06-07,32725976,Riku,"My girl friend and I had a fun stay in Seattle, Mary was an excellent host.  She welcomed us into her home and allowed us full access to her kitchen. Her location in Rainier Valley was very convenient for public transportation.  It was about an hour bus ride to downtown.  She has two friendly dogs that weren't bothersome at all.  Mary was very accommodating and concerned about the needs of her guests.  She has a beautiful home with lots of neat antiques and the room we stayed in was really nice. Overall we had a comfortable stay. 

-Riku & Alison"
3372535,35953108,2015-06-23,34672629,Jrgoeldner,"Our four-night stay was our first experience using airbnb, and we are happy with the results. Not only was Mary’s room near the lovely Seward Park area of Seattle, but it was also perfect because of its proximity to lovely Lake Washington and our daughter’s home. 

Mary is, as they say, “The hostess with the mostest.” She baked muffins for breakfast and take-away cookes and other nibbles for day snacking. I loved it when she popped popcorn for us as we viewed movies two nights. 

Another time, our daughter had a blast playing and doing a singalong on Mary’s twenties vintage player piano. We soon felt like old friends and will definitely stay again."
3372535,37369037,2015-07-06,36012104,Nolan,Mary is one of the most hospitable people I have ever met. She does her absolute best to care for any and every need you have as well as goes above and beyond to make her home yours. Her dog is unbelievably friendly and her house is in a location that makes it easy to quickly make it in to the city. Mary and her hospitality went so far beyond my expectations. 
3372535,40133089,2015-07-28,7230451,Stuart,"We had a fantastic time staying at Mary's place, and while we didn't have the opportunity to meet Mary herself, Knic went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. We were comfortable and well looked after, and had many great conversations... and thanks for introducing me to the miracle of Aeropress coffee!

The location was quiet and peaceful, but so close to Downtown and other parts of the city. We would love to come back another time!"
3372535,40823074,2015-08-02,19261505,Karim,"My girlfriend and I had a great time and enjoyed out stay. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Mary as she was out of town, but Knic hosted us during out stay and he was awesome. 

Our room was comfortable, clean, and cool (A/C was on because it was HOT in Seattle). We shared the bathroom with another guest and things went smoothly; good space and the water pressure is great. There are lots of random snacks to munch on as well as breakfast items to choose from if you want something light to start the day. To top it off, Mary let us use an outlet to charge our Leaf, which was AWESOME. Woot!"
3372535,41656145,2015-08-08,38514929,Kent,"Mary, and substitute host Knic, were great.  The house was clean and the room was comfortable.  The spot is very close to public transportation so getting into downtown Seattle was easy.  They were also very helpful with information when I needed it.  The neighborhood is hilly - so be prepared for that if you are on foot.  Knic and Mary were great.  They made my Seattle stay very easy and the price was a great value."
3372535,44592084,2015-08-27,28094146,Michael,"Mary hat uns gleich beim Ausladen geholfen und anschließend selbstgebackene Cookies und Getränke angeboten. Die Beschreibung in der Anzeige bezüglich der Räumlichkeiten trifft zu. Das Haus ist sehr farbenfroh, moderne Möbelstücke harmonieren mit phantastischen alten Kirchenbänken im Eingangsbereich. Von den im Juli 2015 angegebenen 2 Hunden gibt es nur noch einen recht alten und gemütlichen Hund.
Das Haus ist außerhalb Seattles in einem Wohngebiet recht ruhig an einem kleinen Hügel gelegen, auch etwas außerhalb des Zentrums vom Stadtteil Columbia. Mary hat aber immer angeboten einen bis zur LightTrain-Station zu fahren oder sogar nach Seattle rein und auch wieder abzuholen. Von der LightTrain-Station Othello ist man in ca. 20-25 Min. in der City (ca. 8-10 Stationen, je nachdem wo man im Zentrum etwas unternehmen möchte).
Mary selbst ist eine warmherzige Person, die gerne mit Menschen mit Kontakt ist, sich Zeit nimmt für Gespräche und die Gäste mit einem Frühstück nach Wunsch, Kuchen, Keksen und auch einem Snackpaket für den Tag versorgt."
3372535,45319423,2015-09-01,41836558,Cam,"When I disembarked the LINK Train which conveniently connected the SEATAC airport with Mary's neighborhood, I could say I was not the most impressed about the environment. For a short moment, I was hoping that my idea of living at Mary's would not be a bad one. That was unnecessary. Opening the door with the warmest, friendliest smile I could see, Mary welcomed me into her cozy little home where I will be spending my next few days in Seattle. Even though Mary had just arrived back from her trip and she still had a lot of stuff unpacked, her place was very decorated and neatly organized for your comfort. Can you imagine walking into a house feeling like it is a 4 stars themed hotel? I felt exactly that way. I had the big guest bedroom where Mary called the Serene room. It did live up to its name, the room was painted with a pleasant looking sky blue color and very well ventilated, making you feel like you are in a haven away from the industrial noise. What's better? There's even a basket of snacks in my room!
Mary is the best host you could ever hope to have for a vacation. Though busy as a college professor, she would always try to make herself available for me and my friend during our stay. She would often bake us goodies in the morning, and tend to whatever it is that we need to ensure that we are having a great time. There was one night I was short on plans, she immediately got down to business, looking for something fun for me and my friend. She promptly introduced us to a great musical downtown, Matilda, and even drove us downtown for it. We had a great time that night and it was all thanks to Mary.
Leaving Mary's place, I was kinda proud of myself for being able to seek her out and choose this place out of many other airbnbs. I dont know how other places would be but if I'm coming to Seattle again, I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
So go ahead if you're planning on staying at Mary. I congratulate you for finding her out and take your time reading my review. You're in good hands!"
3372535,53490376,2015-11-09,32811751,Diletta,"Mary was very welcoming and she made me feel at home. She was very helpful and she tried to make my stay in Seattle easier. She has become a friend. My room was even better than it looks in pictures, very large and comfortable. The kitchen was very clean and functional. The house is located near the center and free way. It's quick and easy drive downtown. I advise everyone to choose this apartment. I will miss Mary and Grace."
3372535,54282212,2015-11-17,266510,Joyce,"Mary's house is about 6 miles south of the center of Seattle in a nice residential neighborhood just south of Columbia City and close to Lake Washington.  We chose the location as it was close to relatives we were visiting.  Mary was very welcoming and reached out to us before our arrival to inquire about our food preferences for breakfast (and snacks).  She found out I am on a gluten-free diet and actually sought out gluten-free food and baked several gluten-free treats.  I was amazed!  
She is friendly, and warm, and outgoing.  We felt right at home.  We also enjoyed her dog.  "
3372535,56690009,2015-12-16,33943919,Yangyu,"We had a long trip (crossed the country) to Seattle and stayed at Mary's place for 10 days. The room is larger than the pic shows, and it is clean, bright, and comfortable! 

On our first day, Mary welcomed us with hot tea, a consideration refreshment on a typical Seattle raining day... It was so nice to see someone caring you after a long trip! During the stay, she provided lots of local travel and events info for us. Mary bakes good stuff. We had at least 5 different flavors cookies and breads. Wow! Yummy yummy! 

For most of the time, I stayed at home. Sometimes I will play with Gracie (Mary's dog). She is a goldendoddle, and she is soooooooo cute! 

We not only had an amazing Airbnb experience at Mary's home, we also got two friends there (Woof woof, Gracie!). What more can you get?"
3372535,57309433,2015-12-24,27665042,Mike,"Mary did all she possibly could to make us feel comfortable. She is very thoughtful and welcoming, providing breakfast of our choice and necessities to keep us from a bad day in Seattle. Being provided with stacks of trip guides around Seattle, she also provided her own recommendations and even asked around for us when we decided to explore outside of Seattle. It wouldn't be as great of an experience without Mary and I would definitely come back for my next trip to Seattle! "
3282000,16146913,2014-07-22,17792931,Brooke,"Rob and Jess were amazing hosts!! We stayed with them for a quick weekend getaway and we couldn't have wished for a more perfect time. Their apartment is looks right over Pike Place and the Ferris wheel with gorgeous views of the Sound. They were so accommodating and made sure we felt right at home with recommendations and a night of sailing. If only we could have stayed longer! Thanks, Rob and Jess!!"
3282000,16367050,2014-07-26,815392,Diego,"Smooth as silk!!. Great location, excellent hosts, lovely pets. The building has a gym and a small pool you can use. I am looking forward to my next stay at Jessica and Rob's place."
3282000,16532647,2014-07-28,8751405,Maria   & Scott,"We had the best time ever!! We came up on the train from LA to a quick uber ride to their condo. We Walked into amazing views from the living room. The location was perfect for us for being without a car. We were right by Pikes market, the pier, lunch cruise, sailboats, aquarium, the mall, the space needle and many restaurants. We got to meet the owners and are planning seeing them again. Next time with us hosting. So we highly recommend this wonderful place for the location, the room and the most important the owners Jessica and Rob. I was on a Airbnb conf. Call last week where they said it's more then just place to stay it's it's the people and the friendship. And we were lucky to meet on the way!"
3282000,16598453,2014-07-29,8751405,Maria   & Scott,We had so much fun we just had to stay an extra night before heading to Victoria. And rob and Jessica were. Welcoming and happy to host us fly by the night guest.
3282000,16793422,2014-08-02,3579152,Martin,"Seattle was warm and sunny, just like the picture of the view, so it was very easy to enjoy the city, the neighborhood and the apartment. Even easier with hosts that are relaxed and caring.
Neighborhood was perfect for me. Close to the waterfront, steps away from the market, couple of grocery stores near by and a short walk to the office downtown.
The view is really phantastic! Could just sit on the couch the whole day and watch the ships cross the water and the Ferris wheel turn."
3282000,17238926,2014-08-09,19068743,Mickael.Alborghetti,"Amazing host and place to stay! In middle of Seattle Rob and Jess are amazing and very helpful! you will feel at home do not hesitated to book. 

Will get back if I can! 

"
3282000,17646847,2014-08-15,8827635,Gordon & Alice,"Alice and I had a perfect three days in Seattle with Rob and Jess. The room and apartment are spacious and comfortable. Great location downtown and stubbing views of Pike Street Market and the waterfront. More importantly, our hosts were amazing. Not intrusive but very kind and anxious to help make our trip better in any way possible. Within an hour of arrival Rob and Jess took us sailing, with a beer in hand and the sun in our face. A great couple. If you don't like them then you're no fun. Ten out of ten.  "
3282000,18267498,2014-08-24,19450220,Igor,"Amazing spot, just a block from the fish market.  View from the living room is superb!  Jessica and Rob are nice and very welcoming."
3282000,18667238,2014-08-30,17215513,Kent,"Jessica and Rob are the perfect couple with the perfect location for your stay in Seattle! They're flexible, accommodating, and full of insights that are sure to enhance your trip.

If you want to be in the thick of Seattle, their location can't be beat. Westlake station is just a few blocks away. Pike's Place is across the street.

We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay or better hosts for our first Airbnb venture. If we're ever back in town, we're hitting them up first!"
3282000,18777050,2014-08-31,17295567,Billy,"Jessica and Rob were wonderful hosts who both stopped to chat with me in the evening, before leaving me to do my own thing.

They also put up with me checking out slightly later than planned, which I am grateful for.

There was only one minor problem. It took me about twenty minutes to retrieve the keys from the concierge, because  a previous staff member had not left a note explaining that Jessica and Rob had given a key to them with instructions. This was not Jessica it Rob's fault, but I still think it's important to mention, as it can be quite stressful when the checkin process does not run smoothly."
3282000,18926275,2014-09-02,20586439,Colleen,"Rob and Jessica's home was very clean, warm and inviting. Their view of Pikes Place and the Sound was spectacular. Centrally located made it easy to experience so much of what Seattle has to offer. I would definitely recommend staying at 11th Heaven and I intend to utilize there space again in the future. "
3282000,19113179,2014-09-06,1164771,Blake,"Jessica and Rob were great hosts.  Although I only stayed for one night, everything was perfect.  Just a short walk from the market and great restaurants / bars, the location is wonderful!  They also have an incredible view.  I highly recommend this place when visiting Seattle!"
3282000,19480623,2014-09-13,5006204,Angelos,"Jessica and Rob were gracious hosts and you can't find a better location. Incredible view for your morning coffee. One block to the marketplace, five blocks to the Convention Center (easy 10 minute walk), and so many restaurants and bars in a 5-6 block radius as well, in addition to touristy stuff if that's what you're in to. Longer walk or short cab to Seattle Center. 

Recommended."
3282000,20125845,2014-09-23,15344130,Blake,"Jessica and Rob were extremely nice and hospitable. Not to mention, the views from their place are unbelievable.  I couldn't imagine staying at a better location with friendlier people in Seattle."
3282000,20677091,2014-10-03,21894371,Kristen,"Jessica & Rob were very courteous, professional and quiet folks.  We did not see much of them although we felt comfortable and welcome.  

The view from their front window was absolutely amazing.  The bathroom was well appointed and towels and bedding were very soft and comfortable.  We did not stay in Seattle long enough to avail ourselves of the building amenities.  The building's concierge staff were all pleasant and helpful.  

Probably the greatest advantage staying here was the location.  Most of downtown Seattle was easily accessible on foot with a trip to the space needle easily accomplished via monorail and somewhat longer return stroll on foot via the Olympic Sculpture Park.  We were able to abandon the car for our 3 day visit.  (Parking was convenient but expensive.)

Jessica and Rob have two pets, both exceptionally well behaved and friendly.  The four-legged tenants were unobtrusive and never underfoot.  As pet owners ourselves, we felt that the occasional visits with their pets only made the trip more comfortable, relaxed and enjoyable.  I would highly recommend Jessica & Rob and their fabulous apartment."
3282000,22630490,2014-11-10,3222044,Ashley,"Jessica and Rob were friendly, welcoming and helpful during our stay, which made our trip that much more enjoyable! 

The private bathroom was wonderful, as we really don't like disturbing people in their living space. 

The views: spectacular. Wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else. 

Jessica and Rob's home was so clean, smelled great, and felt like an actual home, not hotel-like. They had friends over one night, we didn't join but everyone was friendly.

Every stay in Seattle has only shown how beautiful and diverse this city is. I would recommend staying here to anyone! Worth it!!"
3282000,22936544,2014-11-17,10899155,Brian,What a great place. Very convenient and the views were breath taking. Jessica and Rob were very nice and the room was clean and comfortable. 
3282000,23608819,2014-12-06,24040485,Brooke,Excellent! Friendly. Best view in Seattle!! 
3282000,25322810,2015-01-12,22344541,Gautham,"Jessica and Rob (Stella and Lucy too) were perfect hosts. They've one of the most beautiful apartments I've ever seen, and it was a pleasure hanging out with them and their fun friends. Incredibly conveniently located, and they helped make this one of my most memorable work trips."
3282000,28234754,2015-03-20,17041695,Max,A great place with a fantastic view and very welcoming hosts. Staying with Jessica and Rob was a treat! Very clean and the two friendly pets were a bonus.
3282000,28361804,2015-03-22,2635060,Sherlyn,My boyfriend had to travel to Seattle and I booked a place for him and was so jealous I couldn't go. He sent me pictures of Jess and Rob's place and it looked stunning! Their dog Lucy is also so friendly — just like her parents. Thanks for everything Jess and Rob! 
3282000,28626869,2015-03-27,16096156,Sally,"The place has the perfect location for tourists and most of the famous sites are within walking distance. The cat and the puppy are super friendly and adorable! the night view from the living room is amazing esp during sunset. The house has a lovely couple who i think are really nice and easy to approach. They were quick to respond to my questions or help. A lot of good restaurants and cafe near here but the farmers market is always there, so why not just go there? Overall, i loved staying at this place and i would def recommend it to any tourists! :D"
3282000,28791248,2015-03-30,12850619,Jeanette,"Everything was so easy and relaxing at Jessica and Rob's!  The bed was sooooooo comfortable and it was great to have our own bathroom.  The best coffee shop is right around the corner and the public mkt is one block away.  This is a wonderful location to visit all downtown Seattle has to offer. The monorail to Seattle Center is about 2 blocks away and multiple restaurants are within a few blocks.  I could sit all day and just look out at Puget Sound from the living room.  Their condo has the best view of the harbor I have ever seen.  We only saw Jessica & Rob for a few minutes, so felt we had the condo to ourselves.  But any questions we had were answered quickly by leaving them a note. I would not hesitate to reommend this place to anyone.  Thank you Jessica and Rob for a perfect 60th birthday trip with my best friend.

3282000,29813512,2015-04-13,25136297,Hannah,"Jessica and Rob were incredibly friendly and welcoming! Their apartment is everything they described, and even more. The pictures don't do the view justice. Locationally, you are right in the middle of the city and so close to buses, trains, boats or just a brisk walk from most attractions. Unfortunately, we didn't get to take full advantage of the ameneties that building provides, but that was due to our short length of stay.

Would definitely recommend it for future guests to the beautiful city of Seattle!"
3282000,30400766,2015-04-21,9869265,Stephanie,"The setting was perfect for my meeting at the Convention Center, which was about a 6 block walk.  The access to the building was via concierge, and all of the people at the desk were friendly and helpful.  I only met Jessica a few times, and she was also friendly and helpful.  The resident dog and cat were curious and not at all intrusive.  Jessica was gracious when I told her I removed the air freshners from my room and bathroom, as those items are hard for me to assimilate.  If you're going to Seattle and want a hassle-free stay I can recommend.  Also right next to the Market as well as a convenient Target store downstairs."
3282000,30574511,2015-04-24,1837745,Birju,"Jessica and Rob kept me updated on when they'd be able to let us in, and how, making sure to make it possible for us to get the keys in their absence and have a place to keep our bags if we got in early in the day.  Their place is perfectly located, has an amazing view, and two adorable pets, in addition to the two very thoughtful humans that they make."
3282000,34409436,2015-06-08,14614089,Eric,Rob & Jess has been an amazing host! Taking care of our needs and provided us dining options. Would love to book and stay with them again.
3282000,35727752,2015-06-21,31545831,Dominic,The listing was perfect; I would imagine that it would be very hard to find a better view in Seattle.  The place was gorgeous and Marissa was very friendly.  She gave my gf and I some great tips on where to eat and what to see downtown(which is where the condo is centrally located).  The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable.  It was just what we needed after a long flight from the east coast.  I will definitely be looking to re-book with Marissa and Tyler the next time I visit Seattle.  
3282000,36230760,2015-06-26,16212944,Alex,"How do you normally feel when you arrive quite late at night to a place that you have no idea about, considering you are dead tired!?
Well, I expected to have at least some issues!!! But, Marissa and Tyler had everything covered :)
Super nice hosts, niiiiiiice place, cute pets and perfect location. This does not even tell a bit from my experience in ""11th Heaven Pike Place Market"". Marissa & Tyler have an amazing place that is in walking distance to almost everything you would like to see, eat and visit in Seattle. They also have perfect suggestions for you if you wonder what to do in Seattle. Even if you want to visit other cities, ask them :D they might give you precious hints ;) You will find it very easy to talk to them and share experiences of your travels.

I totally recommend this listing with 5 stars ;)"
3282000,38158751,2015-07-13,35791064,Alorah,"I'm so glad I came here for my visit to Seattle, Marissa and Tyler were very welcoming and accommodating, (even though I checked in pretty late) as were their pets who were both very sweet to a stranger in their home. The unit was clean and cozy with a breathtaking view, and the room I stayed in was very comfortable (uugh! that fresh air blowing through the deck door! ^.^). Marissa and Tyler's unit is located very close to everything I had planned to see right away, ( the market is just a skip and a hop down the street, the docks, great restaurants, close to all the buses I needed, and not too far from the space needle where friends were staying). Honestly I would come back here in a heartbeat, I really enjoyed my time there and hope to come back soon. "
3282000,38612531,2015-07-17,35037535,Carol,"
Hosts Marissa and Tyler:  enthusiastic, welcoming, knowledgeable.

Lucy (small doggie) and Stella (beautiful cat):   same can be said of them, (but not the knowledgeable part  :) 

24-hour concierges in lobby very helpful in locating critical places, such as the light rail station and the bus stops.

Location is over the top, with a fabulous view of Puget Sound, only one block from Pike Place Market.

Double bed comfortable, guest room has its own balcony, bath nicely equipped with towels, soaps, shampoo, conditioner.

When I return to Seattle to see all that I missed on this trip, I hope that Marissa and Tyler's home is available to me.
"
3282000,39187595,2015-07-21,26165396,Monica,"I think it was one of the best and smoothest trips I've ever taken with my boyfriend - all thanks to Marissa and Tyler. It was our first time in Seattle, and we had a lot on our to-do list. I cannot emphasize enough on how great the location is. Not only do you get a fantastic view of the city, but it is central and easy to navigate from the airport, to tourist destinations, and everything in between. Marissa gave us great recommendations and instructions for check-in. They are open, considerate, and easy-going, and their pets are very adorable! The concierge is also accommodating and friendly and made our stay hassle-free. This is the only place I will think of whenever I come back to Seattle!"
3282000,39439066,2015-07-23,16010046,Jessica,"The photos of the view really don't do it justice - it is beautiful! The location is perfect, and Marissa is wonderful! She did a great job helping me find a restaurant before a show and telling me a bit about lots of different neighborhoods in Seattle. A great Airbnb experience all around."
3282000,39775096,2015-07-26,35244240,Lisa,Perfect location. Gorgeous view! Very happy.
3282000,41064001,2015-08-04,29897144,Liam,We had so much fun in Seattle! This place had a great location with. Fantastic view! So close to Pike Market and the concierge was so very helpful. We didn't get any Seattle rain 
3282000,47862575,2015-09-21,8194887,Erin,"Jessica & Rob were really great hosts. We had never been to Seattle before and they really helped a lot with directions, specifically for us how to get from the airport to their apartment. They were extremely communicative about everything. The bed was very comfortable, just as described. Jessica & Rob have been hosting for a long time and it is clear to us because you instantly feel comfortable with them in their home. They are one block from the Pike's Market and their view is INCREDBILE! Walking in kind of felt unreal. This was our very actual airbnb experience and we didn't feel hesitant staying with someone and Jess & Rob proved why we shouldn't and why websites like this exist. They were awesome hosts and we appreciate their hospitality. On a side note,  their pets are so cute! With regards to the listing, it really is as described. Great view, great people, comfortable bed, private bathroom, and easy access! Thanks!! "
3282000,48239532,2015-09-24,43515063,Liz,Robert and Jessica were wonderful hosts - very welcoming and helpful.  Can't beat the central location or the amazing view.  Our room and bathroom were very comfortable and private.  Would highly recommend and definitely stay again!  :)
3282000,49633169,2015-10-05,5317566,Sean,Very welcoming. Amazing location. Really friendly hosts.  I would definitely go back.
3282000,50021985,2015-10-08,10977565,Brady,"Great place, friendly hosts and amazing views out the window. Highly recommended. "
3282000,53611294,2015-11-10,33161730,Diego,Great location! Great hosts! Great apartment! I wish everyone in airbnb where like Jess & Rob! They were very helpful in everything! 100% satisfaction
3282000,53907774,2015-11-14,12378355,Will,"I arrived late on a flight from the east coast, but everything went smoothly when I arrived - Jessica and Robert were really accommodating.

The view from the apartment is incredible. I had to take a picture out of the huge windows facing the market even though all I really wanted to do was sleep.

Everything went great with my stay. Perfect airbnb experience."
3282000,54127325,2015-11-16,2364316,Scott,"We had a great time at the Eleventh Heaven listing. Jessica and Robert were very welcoming and allowed us to come and go as we pleased, which made the stay extremely easy and pleasant. The amenities and location were top-notch. I absolutely recommend this listing for any visits to the Seattle area."
3282000,55012539,2015-11-27,17209731,Kenny,"The place is awesome. Very central location, really made our life easier in Seattle. Jess and Rob are awesome hosts. In general, a wonderful stay!"
3282000,55379431,2015-12-01,24641585,Claudia,"Staying at ""11th Heaven"" was the best decision we made on our first visit to Seattle. Jess and Rob were very friendly and hospitable. The place was just as described in the listing. I could not get over the view of the market and the water from the living room. 11th Heaven is in a prime location, so we did not have to travel far to enjoy Seattle. Everything was within walking distance, which made it easy for us to get around. 

Thanks to Rob & Jess for a great time. "
3282000,55923557,2015-12-07,3142346,Kimberley,"My daughter and I throughly enjoyed our two night's stay at Jessica and Rob's apartment.  They were very welcoming, as was their adorable dog Lucy and friendly cat Stella. The apartment location and views were fantastic - you're only a few blocks from most everything in downtown Seattle.  The guest room has a very comfy bed, and is set up with a tv and wifi.  Rob and Jessica made us feel right at home and were available throughout our stay for any questions and advice about sights to check out, getting around the city, etc.  Would be very happy to stay there the next time we visit Seattle.  "
3282000,57016060,2015-12-21,14516815,Carmen,"Robert and Jessica were really friendly, helpful and relaxed hosts. Their apartment is in an ideal location and the new bed is super comfotable! We were impressed with the building facilities (gym, pool, jacuzzi). The gym is bigger than expected, lots of equipment and free weights. The pool & jacuzzi are clean and modern. We highly recommend staying here."
5978216,30477784,2015-04-22,26640766,Nils,We had an excellent time staying with Marlee. She was a very considerate host and helpful with all our needs. She even picked us up when we came in late with the ferry from Victoria. Her house in  West Seattle was a perfect base for us to explore the city and the local area in itself is charming and well worth several days exploration. Also here Marlee was the perfect guide. Thanks again.
5978216,33287821,2015-05-26,31916185,Adam,"As soon as you walk in Marlee makes you feel at home! My flight was delayed coming in and she stayed up until 1:30am to meet me! She makes you feel at home and is very knowledgeable of Seattle and she will help you out finding your way around! The house is very quiet and pleasant to stay for an extended stay! House is very close to major bus lines and walking distance to many stores and restaurants!  The neighborhood is very calm and peaceful, and the front deck has a breathtaking view of the water and mountains! I recommend Marlee's house to anyone looking to stay a night or months! Bed is super comfortable and bedroom is huge! Marlee's the best! "
5978216,34861416,2015-06-13,26643039,Lee,"Marlee was so easygoing that she made us feel like old friends right from the start.  Our stay was very brief, due to a tight schedule, so we're looking forward to staying with her again and hanging out a bit.

With our tight travel schedule, we had some logistical concerns, but Marlee put those to rest and made everything work smoothly.  

The location is handy to both SeaTac International Airport and downtown Seattle.  There is a major bus line just a block from the house and it's a 10-minute ride to Pioneer Square, the stadiums, and the AmTrak King Street Station.

Oh, and the bed!  That wonderful bed!  A short night on that was more restful than a long night on most."
5978216,35461442,2015-06-19,24232673,Steven,"Marlee was a generous and gracious host. More than willing to help out, and very knowledgeable about the Seattle area. We enjoyed her relaxed demeanor and atmosphere."
5978216,35688518,2015-06-21,12546990,Levi,Marlee was a fantastic host. She made my friends and I feel very welcome in her home and was extremely helpful and patient when we arrived later than planned and had difficulty finding the place which was entirely our fault. Our room was well kept and clean!
5978216,35949659,2015-06-23,20283602,Jessica,"Marlee was very flexible with check in time, which helped because we were traveling from Vancouver and did not know how long it would take to cross the border. We thoroughly enjoyed the comfortable king size foam mattress. We didn't need to use the 2nd bed in the room because there was only two of us. The bathroom was conveniently located right next to our bedroom. The views were great as shown in the pictures she posted. She is incredibly kind and accommodating. FYI - The Uber ride to Pike Place was only $16!! "
5978216,36693293,2015-06-30,19008034,Colin,"This is a lovely place with beautiful view. Marlee prepared everything and the key even though we arrived super late that night.  You can see the bay from this place.

I really love this place also because it is close to downtown and airport. "
5978216,38722385,2015-07-18,31916185,Adam,I had an extended stay with Marlee and she could not have made it better! The house was very peaceful with an amazing view! The bed is more comfortable than my own at home! It's a great place and within a short walking distance of major bus lines and stores! I wil come back t Marlee's next time I'm in town. She has a great knowledge of the city if you are new to the area as well!
5978216,39625939,2015-07-25,30873397,冠瑋,"Marlee is a passionate house owner, she gave us a lot of helps. Also she is a great gardener. Hope we have the chance to be her guests again."
5978216,40225826,2015-07-29,34364147,Susanna,"We had just a very short stay at Marlee's place but everything was just as described. We felt comfortable staying in a nicely quite and big room.
"
5978216,40464307,2015-07-31,12136761,Paulina,"I stayed here for 2 nights with my boyfriend and my mom. There was a king and queen bed available, and both were very comfortable! The room is exactly as pictured, so there were no surprises. Marlee explained the bus line and water taxi to us, but since we were traveling with my mom, we chose to drive into downtown Seattle (which is also very convenient, albeit parking may be a pain). There's a back alley to park a car, which was really nice for my mom to avoid climbing stairs to get to the front door. All in all, great stay! Thank you, Marlee :)"
5978216,41935700,2015-08-10,32516413,Nils,"Marlee's home was perfect for our needs, a nice and cosy house with a beadroom with 2 large beds. The location was great, close to several bus stops and restaurants and so on. Marlee was pretty busy at work during the week so we didn't see her that often but when we did she was really nice, would recommend it to someone who want's a cheap place to sleep in seattle."
5978216,42455174,2015-08-13,39812170,诗珩,The host is sooooo nice，and beds are comfortable! And it's also convenience to go everywhere. But not to late to come back. 
5978216,43775210,2015-08-22,24671602,Grazielli,"We were 5 people in her house, everything was really clean and comfortable for us, she is a good person, easygoing and very receptive! 
Thank you for everything."
5978216,44327380,2015-08-25,20024419,Claudia,"Wir (zwei Paare) haben zwei Nächte bei Marlee gewohnt und können es nur weiterempfehlen. Marlee ist eine super Gastgeberin, man fühlt sich rundum willkommen bei ihr! Es gab Obst, Bagel, Kaffee und vieles andere. Sie hat uns viele Tipps und Material für die Stadt gegeben. Die Lage ihres Hauses ist in einer schönen,ruhigen Gegend mit gutem Anschluss um mit Bus in die Innenstadt zu fahren. Das Auto kann bequem vor dem Haus geparkt werden,es war immer was frei. Es gibt eine tolle Terrasse mit Blick aufs Meer. Alles in allem hat es uns sehr gut gefallen!"
5978216,45288359,2015-09-01,14158510,Cathy,"Marlee was a great host! I'm sad to say we didn't get a chance to see her at all for the duration because we were at the Penny Arcade Expo for the majority of the time but she was really helpful when we arrived. We had a late arrival because we were coming from Vancouver and she was very understanding. The parking was excellent and the house is very easy to get to. Its conveniently 15-20 mins away from downtown by car, which is where we headed everyday. I'd recommend Marlee's home to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay!"
5978216,46032377,2015-09-07,41910002,Scott,"Marlee was an exceptional hostess. She was there to greet us at check-in, and showed us around the accommadations. She had a dedicated shelf for AirBnB guests with complimentary snacks and food, and even extra toiletries, should we have forgotten ours! The room was exactly as described, with a very comfortable king bed and a queen air mattress. The bus stop for the ""C"" line was a three minute walk. We had an excellent experience, and would definitely stay with Marlee again!"
5978216,47427891,2015-09-18,6549329,Tina,"Marlee is, by far, my favorite host out of everyone I've ever stayed with on Airbnb. She's got everything you could ever need in terms of supplies, the beds are incredibly comfortable, the views are FANTASTIC, and she's right by a bus line that drops you right in the middle of downtown. She's happy to recommend good shows and places to eat and...well, I could ramble on forever. It was a wonderful place to stay, and if I'm ever back in Seattle I'll happily book her again."
5978216,48108870,2015-09-23,41860060,Sheena,"Marlee is such a great host! My cousin and I were fortunate enough to come across her listing before visiting Seattle for the first time.

Her location is actually amazing. The room is as expected in pictures: one of the beds are memory foam, the other is an air bed, and the bathroom is always very clean (even when it's shared). She's a 7 minute drive from the West Seattle water taxi terminal which gives you an amazing view of downtown. We ubered everywhere which we didn't mind because it's just a smooth 15 minute drive/$18 uber from the heart of downtown. We were even able to walk to Lincoln Park and hike down to the coast. Within 3 days we got to experience the city life and the nature life of West Seattle and Downtown with the ease of having a comfy bed to sleep in at the end of the day (not to mention at a great cost).

We were lucky enough to have the time to get to know Marlee and she's so awesome! She's a fairly busy woman and we were mostly out during the day, but the few conversations we did have with her were very amiable. She made us feel comfortable enough to talk to her if we ever needed anything - she's fun to talk to in general. She really made our first Airbnb/Seattle experience one to remember! I definitely recommend staying with her! "
5978216,50205790,2015-10-10,44437932,Jianghe,"Yeah, It was a wonderful trip and wonderful place.
Quite and friendly.
I love it."
5978216,50662605,2015-10-13,44122258,Marie,"Marlee was a wonderful host. Everything was set out and ready for us when we got there, and even though she was busy, she made it easy to contact her if we needed anything. She was enthusiastic and knew of a lot of cool, fun things we could do while in Seattle. We wish we stayed longer so we could do more! The listing was just as described with gorgeous views of the sound, and the room and beds were very comfy. Thank you so much for having us!"
5978216,51544899,2015-10-21,41971131,冠綺,"
Hi Marlee,

I'm visiting my friends this fall, and a friend of mine recommended me to try Airbnb!
We love your place and think it would be perfect for our stay.

Thank you,
Kuan-Chi
"
5978216,52917647,2015-11-02,21274060,Joey And Faviola,"Marlee was  cool, the house was cool, the neighborhood was cool. It's just a couple blocks from the C line, which runs very late, and is close to downtown. Marlee doesn't always respond right away, but she always does respond. We really enjoyed our stay here."
5978216,54200596,2015-11-16,48604649,Maree,Marlee was very nice and welcoming. My friend and I felt comfortable at her house which is located in a nice neighborhood close to water. We found the place as it was described on the listing. I definitely recommend Marlee's place and would come back. 
5978216,54293431,2015-11-17,7581583,Tracey,"Marlee's place was just what my friend and I needed for our short stay. Perfect location between the city and the airport. Place was clean, memory foam remembered our shapes (haha) and Marlee was an expert on the Seattle music scene! Would recommend her place."
5978216,54650887,2015-11-22,2234440,Scott,"Marlee's place is a laid-back, blues and jazz type of house. Squares need not apply. She is helpful and accommodating. There are two roommates who have rooms upstairs, but in five days I saw nor heard them. The room is cozy and warm which is perfect for the Seattle fall/winter. "
5978216,54828108,2015-11-23,24747654,Rebecca,"Although I never got to meet Marlee in person because off our schedules, she was very helpful and gave clear instructions for when we arrived. This was a great place to stay for our short one night roadtrip to Seattle. The memory foam mattress was very comfortable! The house was quiet so we were able to have a peaceful night. We had a safe place to park the car and the house is a short drive to downtown and the airport! Thank you Marlee for being a great host even when you had a busy schedule!"
5978216,55030872,2015-11-27,47487005,Paola,Marlee was a very kind and gracious host. We stayed for 3 days and were very comfortable at her house. The room was spacious & comfy and we had no problem sleeping. Marlee went out of her way to make us feel at home & even made us delicious frech press coffee. We were sad to leave & will definitely book with her again next time we are in town.
5978216,56035156,2015-12-08,46677552,Elysse,"Amazing wonderful human being. Next time we decide to go to Seattle she will be our one and only choice!

Other notes:
Comfortable room, ample space, magically cozy and spacious home with great views, and super close to the C line and city transportation! Marlee is the best!!!"
5978216,56404477,2015-12-13,18942760,Yi,"very nice experience! Sorry for the late review. Marlee is a very nice person. She prepared a warm and clean room. The bathroom is very roomy and comfortable. And it is quiet! 
I will stay again next time!"
5978216,56607989,2015-12-15,33140933,Elli,Marlee was very welcoming and the room was perfect! Lots of privacy and very clean. The house was very laid back and in a great location to catch the bus to Seattle or explore the cute shops and restaurants in Marlee's area. 
5978216,57295466,2015-12-24,31627900,Taozhang,Great host. Comfortable private room. 
5978216,58222979,2016-01-01,18708107,Jessica,"Marlee's place is cozy and every little things in her house has stories. Marlee is very cool person and very warm hearted.
Her house is very close to a nice convenience store and the bus stop to downtown. The room listed is warm and the queen bed is comfortable."
6436772,35957696,2015-06-23,271454,Katie,Very nice house in a very nice neighborhood.   Everything was easy.
6436772,37674223,2015-07-09,15399210,Greg,"The house was incredible and absolutely perfect for our family!  We really liked the layout of the house and the separation between the living area and the rooms of the house. The neighborhood was awesome!  Very family friendly and quiet. Great bars, eateries, shops etc.. close by.  And of course the beach! Minutes from Alki, which we enjoyed several times.  
 Their communication with us during our stay was A+. Fast, attentive and effective.  
We were very happy with the house and the surroundings. Thanks!"
6066185,33324215,2015-05-26,8118619,Jialiang,"Really nice place to stay, clearly and beautiful. It has everything I need in that place. Great location, I would like to stay again when I visit Seattle next time. "
6066185,34171170,2015-06-05,23667838,Gary,"Cons:
1. At the time of reservation listing said ""free parking on premises"" this is misleading as the only parking available is Zoned 2hour street parking between hours of 7am to 6pm.

2. Initially had no hot water, realized this when I was about to take a shower after a long workout. Pillow management were of no help as I had figured out for myself that the electric water heater was recently installed and needed to be reset. I had to wait a few hours before the water was finally usable.

3. In both of the above instances Pillow showed that, when their services in “rental management” were needed their corrective action in contacting the owner for assistance yield no beneficial results.
Without understanding the management agreement between Owner and Pillow it is hard to say whether Pillow did the most they could to try to resolve the issues.
Although it seems clear though that the only perceivable value Pillow provides is a simple communication buffer between the Owner and the renter, as Pillow’s customer support agents instant reaction/corrective action was to go back to the property owner for assistance.  

4. Garden level unit with front windows right next to the sidewalk so it can be noisy at times 

Pros:
1. Great geographic location
2. Aesthetically pleasing decoration throughout. 
3. Fairly clean"
6066185,34981102,2015-06-14,10608665,Allie,"Positives: This is a beautifully(!) decorated apartment in an excellent location on Capitol Hill. Walkable to all sorts of fabulous restaurants and bars.
Negatives: The bedroom barely fits the mattress and there is little to no air movement in the back of the apartment. On a hot summer day (yes, we have those in Seattle, albeit rarely) it was very warm indeed.

Additionally, this apartment is managed by Pillow Homes. We had an issue with hot water for the shower and it took some time for Pillow to respond to us about it. I even emailed in advance of the stay to check on the issue and was assured that ""it had been resolved"" - when really we need the instructions for how to turn the hot water heater on. I had to communicate with several different guest service representatives as opposed to just one owner of the apartment. In all honesty, I will avoid staying at any Pillow sites in the future, it takes the personal touch of AirBnB out of the equation and there is no communication with the actual ""host."" The Pillow service people might as well be thousands of miles away which takes away one of the best parts of the AirBnB experience, in my opinion. "
6066185,35672468,2015-06-21,29435756,Rachel,"The listing was, for the most part, as described. We really enjoyed staying in this neighborhood. The apartment looks like the photos do [including a ""bedroom"" that seems to be more like a converted closet].

As other guests mentioned, this home is managed by Pillow Homes and they were a NIGHTMARE to deal with. Like the other guests, we also had some issues...and instead of simple and timely resolution with the host, and ""feeling understood,"" we had to go through Pillow, who then tried to contact the host. Pillow sent notice of ""resolved"" issues, which was really just them closing out their tickets; no issues were resolved. We spent too much time dealing with Pillow and, once that didn't work, Airbnb on this vacation.

If everything at the apartment is in order, this is a great place. In the event of a problem...good luck to you."
6066185,35947385,2015-06-23,8998698,Jason,"AJ's place was great! It's located in the middle of Capitol Hill and all of the neighborhoods great restaurants, bars and shops. The place was delightful and clean and although the apt is on the ground floor, I found the street noise unnoticeable. What a great find! I would definitely stay here again.  "
6066185,36969645,2015-07-03,34351738,Kerry,"Clean, comfortable apartment in a nice neighborhood. Convenient to shops, restaurants and grocery stores."
6066185,38340800,2015-07-14,23476248,Alison,"Great location and really stylish room. Everything was clean and organized. Highly recommended, I will definitely stay again.   "
6066185,39925559,2015-07-27,32987968,Steve,"This place is very modern and comfortable. It is very close to many great restaurants and pubs. Would stay here again...
"
6066185,40512130,2015-07-31,989774,Lori,"Simple, good for 1-2 people, I was there by myself.  If you're a couple and not petite, the bed is small.  I am six ft tall and can't imagine sharing the bedroom and bed with another person. If you like being close, go for it. Good location just above Capitol Hill, near a good co-op grocery and a lot of restaurants.  I didn't have a car so the fact that there are several nearby bus routes was fantastic.  I work in Seattle a few times a year and am considering making this my go-to place to stay. The place is well designed, I loved the records on the wall and the record player.  I didn't touch the TV or use anything in the kitchen except the coffee maker.  I use AT&T and couldn't get cell service in the apartment, I had to open the front door to get bars.  Since this apartment uses PillowTalk, all the info is online, including the wifi password, so jot that down somewhere before you get into the apartment."
6066185,42605704,2015-08-14,40496264,Kattie,"The house was just like the photos, it was easy to find when you follow the directions provided. I felt they do a great job of making sure you have what you need. Very clean, and comfortable. "
6066185,43045004,2015-08-17,7479793,Morgan,Neighborhood was great. Host was very responsive and gave us some helpful suggestions on where to store our luggage before check in.
6066185,43582246,2015-08-20,1781518,Raj,"First impressions mean a lot. As we opened the gate, we were greeted with a can of raid insect repellent. This was disconcerting. While we found the overall cleanliness acceptable - esp the bathroom- we discovered why an insect repellent was needed.  There were many crumbs under the sink and surrounding the garbage pail. Luckily, the co-op had natural wipes so we thoroughly cleaned it. 

The location was excellent: walking distance to the an organic grocer (an amazing co-op), Trader Joe’s, an organic juice bar, and to the heart of Capitol Hill’s night life and restaurants.  If you come with a car, parking will run about $20 per day, in a open air parking lot about 3 blocks away.  The downside of this parking lot is that you have to activate it with your app at 6 am, as the night payment only applies till 6 am in the morning.

However, due to the heat, we had to open the windows and were subjected to the street noise (buses, cars and rowdy folks), fumes and dust from living on the ground floor. We had no choice but to leave those windows open. As well, a bedroom fan had to be on constantly, which was unsettling during the sleeping hours.  There is no cross ventilation in this apartment. None of this was not disclosed in advance.  


Be forewarned; At&t service doesn’t work inside the apartment; wifi is fine. Apple tv was a plus. We appreciated the (clean) hardwood floors.

No one meets you to give you the keys.  You must go around the corner to a group of lock boxes with a combination.  If you arrive late, this is very inconvenient.  Also, there was only one set for the two of us - even more inconvenient.

If you come with a car, parking will run about $20 per day, in a open air parking lot about 3 blocks away.

There were 4 bath towels for two of us - plenty - yet no hand towels, wash cloths or hair dryer - essential for travelers.  The kitchen was decent regardless of an  electric stove and teflon cookware.  The main compartment of the frig was clean, the door - holding condiments - was not.

We left one of our keys behind, and contacted the “pillow team”, who were prompt in responding. We found it surprisingly unacceptable that they were going to charge us $15 plus shipping to return it. When we said we could pick it up in-person, we never heard from them.  Chest la vie, it’s just a key!

If a little more attention to detail is given to this rental, we would recommend it."

Home décor was stylish and functional with everything we needed to enjoy our time in Seattle. 
Would stay again!

6066185,48309023,2015-09-25,41769737,赵,"The apartment is sleekly-designed. Kitchen offers everything you need to cook. Convenient location, 30 mins walking to Pike Market and downtown. But parking is not free, you can park outside but you have to change every two hours. there are several public pay parkings around( Diamond)."
6066185,49642837,2015-10-05,13482763,Andrea,The place was great...looked just like the pictures. And it was within walking distance to tons of great places. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking to get a more local feel for Seattle vs. staying in the more touristy downtown areas. 
6066185,52553176,2015-10-30,17833528,Jody,"AJ's place was perfect for my stay in Seattle. Great location! There was everything I could need, the place itself was even better than the photos! Very stylish and quirky! AJ was away whilst I was staying, so I didn't get to meet him, but his friend Tyler was super helpful and very friendly! Easy to communicate and make arrangements with, I would undoubtedly stay again ."
4370312,56465297,2015-12-13,17931956,Cat,Great place good location.  We were there when it was cold and raining but the deck has an amazing view at night. Would love to see it in the summer
4370312,56703221,2015-12-16,51100164,Grant,"Honestly, I'm so tempted to give it a so-so review just I could save it for myself on my next visit- this was truly amazing!  The room, view, and location were fantastic.  Everything-from the shower to the bedroom were immaculate.   The kitchen nook, living room, etc.  Just what we needed for a perfect Seattle stay.  Thanks to Charles and Lauren for the use of the Bus Pass- really wonderful (and interesting) people.  Thanks again!  Just the best."
4370312,56887265,2015-12-19,2001792,Jack & Jo,Bright and open with a wonderfully comfortable bed and an inviting view of Seattle's downtown from the couch where we enjoyed fresh brewed local coffee from the beans Charles supplied in the kitchen along with a fresh supply of half-and-half! A very pleasant overnight on a cool and rainy Seattle stop-over. Charles was gracious & helpful on the phone when we needed to make contact (despite being on his own travel). Would definitely stay there again should our travels return us to Seattle. Be sure to bring your eye mask as the big windows allow plenty of ambient light.
4370312,57332430,2015-12-24,50526343,Adriane,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Charles' cozy craftsman. The place was clean, quiet, and very comfortable! Everything we needed to have a pleasant stay was provided. We were able to cook breakfast in the quaint kitchen most mornings and walked to the amazing restaurants in downtown Madrona for dinner. The neighborhood is cute and quiet and offers a great view of the lake! If you're looking for a nice quiet place to stay that gives easy access to all Seattle had to offer—this is the one! "
8556103,56662007,2015-12-16,7013118,John,The house was excellent and very comfortable. Just what we needed. Our hosts were very anxious to make sure that our every need was met. We had a very enjoyable stay.
8556103,57573906,2015-12-27,7592266,Rebecca,"We stayed at Justin's house over Christmas to visit with our daughter who lives very close by.  Everything was perfect!  Great location, comfortable, cute, and well-equipped house, great communication.  We usually aren't as comfortable staying in someone's primary residence, but Justin and his wife went to great efforts to help us feel like we weren't displacing them from their home.  In fact, I am inspired to emulate some of their organizational and decorating ideas.

The house was cheerily decorated for Christmas.  It was spotless and cozy.  We loved the open plan centered around the fireplace and enjoyed spending Christmas Day there with our daughter and her boyfriend.  We would certainly rent this home again.  We'd love to visit in the summer when the lovely deck could be put to use.

Highest recommendation!"

3849918,36649769,2015-06-30,26252467,Wanda,"We arrived to a wonderfully clean unit and a pretty bouquet of flowers.  The host was helpful about providing some extra supplies since we were there for a longer period of time.  We communicated via text, and the responses were almost instantaneous.  The beds were comfortable, and there were adequate kitchen utensils for meals, etc. The property is in a lovely but hilly neighborhood with a charming mix of modern and older homes."
3849918,37289296,2015-07-06,28925222,James,We found Sunset Splender very neat and clean. The beds were very comfortable including the foldout in the living room. The free wi fi was helpful. The weather in Seattle was quite warm and the host had provided us with extra fans and bottled water in the frigerator. 
3849918,40085938,2015-07-28,18744780,Annie,"The rental property company did their best to add nice furnishings and the apartment had everything we needed to cook, etc. It was tidy upon arrival and access into the apartment was easy.  The parking space provided was great, as was access to different areas of Seattle. The rental property people were quick to answer questions, which was helpful. Water in the fridge was also appreciated. All in all, everything you need is here.

We stay in Seattle every summer, but usually in Ballard or Fremont.  If you are not looking to be in one of the more trendy, hip Seattle neighborhoods, then this place would be a sound choice.  The apartment itself is older, with indoor/outdoor carpeting, older linoleum (the small bit of wood flooring was nice), older window shades, a very small bathroom and an under performing shower. The fluffy  towels provided are adequate if you plan to stay for a shorter amount of time, but otherwise if you stay with four people as we did for a week, then you might have to use the coin operated/shared laundry. The internet did not consistently work.  I found that the pictures on the site made the apartment look newer and bigger than it really is. I would say this is best for two people, but it would be a very tight fit for 6, as we felt it was small with two adults and two children. 
But we tend to look for very modern places to stay in more trendy neighborhoods, so if you are looking for a solid place to stay in the Seattle area and aren't picky about the things I mention, then this would be a good choice."
3849918,40578390,2015-08-01,4510215,Nancy,"
The apartment was clean. The bed and pillows were very comfortable. The bonus was the parking under the apt. structure and the balcony with a nice breeze. There are no houses across the street, just trees. I had a question about the WIFI so I emailed Denise and she immediately got back to me with the answer. The neighborhood is quiet, and there is a park down and across the street from the apt.  You're about 15 minutes from the airport and tourist attractions are not far. The apartment looked like the picture in the posting."
3849918,41732339,2015-08-09,30513199,Denzel,It was an awesome place. Very peaceful and safe. The house had everything we need. Would stay again and I recommend it. 
3849918,42609914,2015-08-14,39093458,Leah,"Sunset Splendor was a great place for my family and I to stay while on vacation in Seattle. When we arrived, I had misplaced the arrival information, and the host was helpful at getting in. The next day they printed the information and left it outside the door before 7:00 am. The home was nicely appointed and there were plenty of dishes and clean towels for our stay of almost a week. It was great to have off-street parking. 
The neighborhood was fine. There was really no dining close by, but a Safeway and and a QFC were within a couple of miles. "
3849918,47864436,2015-09-21,32224113,Jill,"This listing was just as bright, roomy and clean as it looks.  Access was so easy with the door code, garage parking even with a topper on a suv was more than adequate. The views were spectacular as were the colors of fall.  The neighborhood was better than we hoped for and I would stay again and again.  The beds were super comfortable, kitchen was fully equipped with some necessities left by the host.(coffee) And lastly the host was so flexible with an extended day.  Thank you for a  lovely experience."
380950,1554276,2012-06-25,2073741,Sharon,"This rental was not the neighborhood craftsmen charmer we expected as it fronted a very busy city street.  Consequently family sleeping in bedrooms on the main floor of the house had difficulty sleeping because of traffic noise.

The kitchen on the main floor of the house had one electrical outlet.  It has a dishwasher, but the plates in the cupboard are too tall when loaded normally into the bottom of the dishwasher.  Also the house is listed as having room for twelve, as it does, but there were not enough dishes and glassware for twelve.  

The main floor of the house is pleasant and the view is stunning.  However sleeping quarters in the basement are less than pleasant.  One bed was simply a box spring and mattress setting on the floor.  The carpet in the basement was dingy. 

It was great to have internet access and television.  The hot tub was something we did not use.  In fact we turned it off because it had a loud motor running constantly.  "
380950,6528597,2013-08-16,4027090,Micah,My wife and I stayed with friends who were visiting from out of town. Jeanette's place ended up being a great home base for rediscovering Seattle. The place is right off a busy street so be prepared as one room is a little noisy. The grill and hot tub on the deck overlooking Ballard and Freemont easily made up for it! Thanks Jeanette!
380950,7196586,2013-09-10,7728055,Nick,"This was a great house for our reunion. Jeanette was super helpful, would definitely rent again! Nice place."
380950,17992657,2014-08-20,9430912,Mark,"Host was responsive to our questions. House was clean and had everything we needed, accept no toaster.  Would have been goo to know about narrow twisting stairs to the basement, and the downstairs bathroom was quite interesting!
Neighborhood was nice but quite hilly.  Good thing grandma and grandpa in their 80's were unable to come.  The rest of us had a good workout coming and going."
380950,18314165,2014-08-25,2895041,Lakshmi,"Ian and Jeanette were communicative hosts who were very easy to work with. They even let us check in early, which was very nice since we had luggage and groceries that we were eager to store.

Pros: Great location; lovely, sunny deck with great view and a hot tub; Jeanette & Ian are communicative and low-stress hosts.

Cons: Small downstairs unit with an awkward layout - not the best for privacy or luxury atmosphere; issues with water pressure (maybe because we were using the washing machine at the same time?); on a busy street, so the main floor bedrooms were loud.

Overall: I recommend this place for a large group of people on a budget, who did not care about having luxury accommodations. The house is clean, and the main floor is spacious enough to have everyone hang out up there. But, if you're looking for a fancy party pad, this is not it. Jeanette and Ian were great hosts, and very communicative.

380950,19245708,2014-09-08,20814094,Hao-Min,"It is our first time using airbnb and we had great time in this cool house!
They have pretty much everything you will need in a house, just very comfortable! We have total 9 people in this trip, and this house have more than enough place for us to hangout&sleep!
Host are very helpful and friendly! Overall experience are outstanding:)
Will definitely come back again for the next Seattle trip!!!"
380950,37293749,2015-07-06,20126288,Sarah,Ian was great! Very responsive to all of my million and one questions. The house was very clean upon entering and had plenty of resources on things to do in the city. The place was spacious and comfortably fitted all of our friends.  The house is on a steep hill in a quiet neighborhood but close in driving distance to get to everything we needed. The hot tub on the patio that overlooks the city is breathtaking - I could spend hours hanging out there. 
380950,40880360,2015-08-03,2885353,Samantha,"Ian and Jeannette were great hosts. They were very accommodating to my wedding party of 12 people! I didn't stay in the house myself, but everyone in my wedding party said the house was great - clean, exactly as described. Would recommend it for another large party!"
380950,43929297,2015-08-23,35426543,Stephanie,"This house had ample space, fun games to play, and a great patio with amazing views.  We had small children with us, and the one downside is that it was on a pretty busy street.  However, the area is quite nice.  We were even able to walk to the zoo"
380950,45051885,2015-08-31,25640093,Monte,"This home was truly a beautiful home, and was what was described in the listing.
The location of the home, however, left much to be desired.  The street noise was very loud, making it hard to get a good nights sleep.  The stairs to the downstairs were extremely steep and hard to maneuver, if there is someone elderly staying there.
Otherwise it was in a great location, and had plenty of space for our family gathering."
380950,45725743,2015-09-05,18169162,Theresa,"A truly beautiful place. The views on the deck were stunning (both day and night), the house is charming, and the rooms were all comfortable and clean. We were happily surprised to find more sleeping options than expected, given both beds and futons. This is no small thing, since we had a full crew of 10 people. We didn't do much cooking, but the kitchen was spacious enough for several people to be in at a time to set up snacks and mix drinks. It was an excellent place for our out-of-town guests to get to relax and mingle before heading to our wedding the next day. The house is also  close to fun and walkable area of Fremont, which was convenient.

Our hosts were also very accommodating with an early check-in and a later check-out, which was much appreciated!"
380950,46857710,2015-09-14,5870536,Travis,"Everything was as depicted in the pictures.  The place was beautiful and the deck had an amazing view.  The owners even texted me to let me know that the house was ready to check in a couple hours before the listed check in time.  The only thing that was a bit unexpected was the layout of the house.  It almost seemed like the downstairs is one long hallway with bedrooms and a bathroom along the way.  I expected there to be a larger common area with a house that sleeps so many.  Overall though, it fit our needs perfectly."
8684315,51518238,2015-10-20,912581,Summer,"Mike, Paulina and Barksdale (their awesome Goldendoodle) gave us one of our most enjoyable experiences with an AirBNB host. 

We loved the neighborhood as it was conveniently close to just about everything including the Downtown area. The accommodations were immaculate, the bed was comfortable, and it was everything we needed for an overnight stay. Although we weren't expecting it, Mike and Paulina invited us to join them for a delicious home cooked meal.

We ended up spending several hours talking with Mike and Paulina about their work and world travels, and our one year old really enjoyed playing with Barksdale who was surprisingly gentle for being a large, younger dog. 

All in all, we loved it and hope the place is available the next time we visit Seattle! Highly recommended."
8684315,52148345,2015-10-26,28510124,Rebecca,Mike was a fantastic host. He and Paulina made my friend and I feel right at home on my first trip to Seattle. We were warmly greeted by his dog Barksdale who is such a sweetheart. The location is in a great area and a very short uber ride to everything we wanted to see. His house itself is beautiful with photos and artifacts of his travels displayed throughout. Mike had welcomed us with great suggestions on places to go/eat and things to do.  I would definitely recommend him as a host to anyone looking to spend some time in Seattle.
8684315,52652917,2015-10-31,45570153,Xin,"MIke's house is even better than described. The room is clean and comfortable, and the location is absolutely outstanding. We find it even safe to walk at nights. Also Mike is a very nice man, easy and open for communication. We love the house and thank you for giving us such a good Airbnb experience!"
8684315,53077804,2015-11-04,20321671,Jithu,"Mike was a great host! His home was beautiful, and we enjoyed Seattle very much and felt right at home. It was nice to see the pictures and mementos from all the places he's traveled to. My biggest regret was not being able to talk more with Mike about his experiences and travels (and to take him up on his offer of lasagna and wine). The living space was comfortable, and we made sure to take advantage of the bluetooth speaker in the showerhead. We also really appreciated all of the recommendations! (The views from Kerry park were amazing and everyone at Storyville was so warm and welcoming!) We also loved Barksdale. I have a Golden Retriever, so it was very fun to meet a dog with similar mannerisms. Thanks for hosting us!"
8684315,54325290,2015-11-18,2119881,Kerri,"Mike was great. His policy is to live by the ""golden rule"" which he does. We arrived with no one there and let ourselves in. There were a set of clear instructions on our bed with information about the house and the surrounding area. The house is wired really well for sound... including in the shower head! Being that our son happens to live on the same street we are very familiar with Capitol Hill. Mike was away for the weekend but we met up with he and Barksdale when he returned. Barksdale is absolutely adorable and we wanted to play with him all night, but had to go to bed to catch an early flight. Although we were not in Seattle to see Mike, it would have been nice to spend more time getting to know him. He is just the kind of person you want to add to your friends list :)"
8684315,55958692,2015-12-07,48169026,Katey,Mike was awesome! The places was beautiful and he was very inviting. I had dinner with them and helped decorate their tree. An amazing place to stay and really close to a lot of fun places to eat and shop. It's super easy to get around the city from that area as well. Totally recommend staying here!
8684315,56194008,2015-12-10,21023221,Margo,"Enjoyed a great stay at Mike's place. I was made to feel right at home. The townhome is in an excellent location and the room, bed and bathroom were comfortable and well appointed. I would definitely stay here again."
8684315,58022795,2015-12-31,11948036,Mark,"Mike was a very friendly host.  We entered the house using the code Mike gave us, and were quickly greeted by Barksdale the labradoodle!  Barksdale is an extremely friendly and well-behaved dog.  Mike was also very welcoming (although not quite as rambunctious as Barksdale!).  Mike's house is very nice and is on a quiet street with not too much traffic.  The room and bathroom were really nice and very clean and tidy.  I loved the bluetooth built into the shower unit!  I was able to brew up some Early Grey tea for myself in the kitchen for breakfast before we had to leave to catch a flight."
8684315,58556005,2016-01-03,22458644,Susie,"We had the pleasure of meeting Mike, Paulina and, of course, Barksdale, the friendly Golden-Doodle.  The home is lovely and is convenient to coffee shops, restaurants and nice views of the city.  We used UBER to get around which worked great.

We felt very welcome in this home and enjoyed spending time in Seattle.

We would definitely refer this property and are happy to have met both Mike and Paulina."
6780670,35046246,2015-06-14,28466166,Julia,"Talitha's apartment was everything we expected from the photographs and more! It was very neat, tidy and extremely cozy. And her vintage decor and design made it feel like were were in a trendy hotel! Talitha was very warm and friendly and really helpful in sharing with us fun places to check out and great spots to eat. I would definitely stay here again! Especially since it is so close to downtown and within walking distance to the Spaceneedle!"
6780670,35973356,2015-06-23,4780067,Jennifer,"Talitha's vintage apartment was perfect! The apartment itself is clean and comfortable, plus she has a great sense of style. Our arrival time turned out to be later than we expected and she was gracious and flexible. She made sure we had a few snacks and drinks waiting when we first arrived. The location is great and we were able to walk most places or take a 10 minute drive to other locations. 

There is plenty of free parking, though it can be difficult to find a spot. However, we were visiting during the U.S. Open, so the whole city was bit more congested than usual. It wasn't burdensome and can be expected in the city.

We got to spend some time hanging with her before we left and it was great getting to know a bit about her. We would definitely stay with Talitha again!"
6780670,36727217,2015-06-30,7685413,Samantha,"Talitha was so nice! She had fruit waiting for us and was very accommodating when we were running late checking in. The apartment was quaint, comfortable and perfect for our stay."
6780670,39084624,2015-07-20,37683954,Corey,"Talitha was a good communicator. She left us some snacks and fruit. The apartment was in a pretty convenient location, and was nicely decorated. Only complaint was the cleanliness. Was informed that the apartment had been ""professionally cleaned"" but the bedsheets had many hairs on them and the bed didn't have a bottom (fitted) sheet. We ended up buying a cheap set of sheets to use during our stay."
6780670,40983532,2015-08-03,5870863,Kritzi,"Talitha was a great host! She was very nice and accommodating to my special requests. Her apartment is in an ideal location with plenty of restaurants and activities nearby. Inside has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Talitha has an eye for decor, you will notice little details all over the apartment that make it really special. I stayed on a Saturday and had no problem finding free street parking. Overall it was a fun stay, I highly recommend Talitha and her quaint vintage apartment. "
6780670,44239413,2015-08-24,19573387,Fiona,"Talitha's place, more lovely than her photos depict, is a peaceful, thoughtful retreat in the middle of bustling Seattle. It was a great home base for my first Airbnb experience! If you enjoy the charm and character of old buildings and architecture, you will enjoy staying at Talitha's. The air outside was unusually muggy and smoky from forest fires and Talitha was thoughtful enough to provide cold, fresh fruit and water which was so refreshing at the end of the day. Couple things to note: you will definitely hear the neighbors moving about, although infrequently, but if you're not used to apartment living, this may bother you. Also, as a person of tall stature (6 ft.), I found the lower height of the shower-head a bit challenging, however the rest of the apartment is very open, airy and spacious. Nice comfy bed, lovely ambiance and great neighborhood access to restaurants and nightlife. Stay here! "
224763,890126,2012-01-30,1455747,Paul,"The apartment and the building were beautiful and very comfortable. We enjoyed the apartment so much we even stayed in one night to relax and watch a movie! Lori was very friendly and greeted us at the apartment with helpful information on the neighborhood and places to eat. We were in the free zone to ride the metro and close to the waterfront. I would recommend this to anyone visiting Seattle

Paul & Peter"
224763,901539,2012-02-04,1417312,Mahin,As advertised! Great location - really nice restaurants within walking distance. Unit was clean and comfortable.
224763,1438808,2012-06-08,956582,Melissa,"This place was great! It was clean and comfortable. Being close to such a busy street, I thought it would be loud but it wasn't at all. It is located in a great area of downtown. Not in the heart of retail but close (so close you step out the condo entrance and bam! great sushi right there) to so many great restaurants. And not just any restaurants, the ones you'll find in all the brochures and online places that claim these are the places to eat. It was all so good. The place is very close (walking distance) to pier, Pike's Place, downtown shopping and retail and more. It all worked out so perfectly for our stay. I've been to Seattle before but if I go back to Seattle again, this is the place I want to stay. "
224763,1764538,2012-07-21,1172560,Andrew,Great apartment in a fantastic location.  Lori was very accommodating when it came to my changed schedule.
224763,4383955,2013-05-01,5910594,Gaia,"It was great to stay at Nick's apartment. The kitchen was fully stocked, the building had lots of amenities, and it was in a great area close to many restaurants. Checking in and out of the apartment was also really easy. Would definitely stay here again in the future."
224763,5115239,2013-06-13,6135418,Lisa,"Perfect Belltown apartment! We were greeted at check in by Nick's associate, Cynthia, who gave us a tour of the apartment complex. Amenities included parking, gym and pool on site. The unit itself was exactly as described - clean and modern with nice contemporary furnishings - and was stocked with the basic necessities to prepare a nice meal after a short walk to Pike Place Market. 
Unit faced the courtyard, which made for a quiet and calm retreat from the bustle of Belltown. Close to restaurants and bars including Shiro's, a top-rated sushi spot with lines forming before opening. 
Nick was a great host and had the portable crib already assembled when we arrived!  "
224763,9055366,2013-12-03,7467848,Jim,"I highly recommend this property.  You will leave wanting to remodel your own home.  Or move to Seattle.  It's that nice.  Location was perfect for The Market, Restaurants, Space Needle, etc.  The parking spot made my visit so easy.  Autumn is an excellent host.  Efficient.  Great communicator. Easy to work with.  Would stay here again.    "
224763,10888679,2014-03-11,5910594,Gaia,This is the second time we stay at this apartment and it was lovely. It is in a great location near so many restaurants. It also had a very stocked kitchen with everything we needed to cook. Autumn was very communicative and easy to reach. I would definitely stay here again next time!
224763,10990763,2014-03-16,12135096,Margaret,"Autumn was lovely! She met us there with the keys and couldn't have been friendlier or more enthusiastic about showing us the ins and outs of the apartment as well as the area. The apartment was lovely, perfectly located and an easy walk just about any major tourist stop in Seattle. The kitchen was very well equipped, the bed super comfortable, and it even had a pack'n'play and high chair available! The pool and gym were great extras as well. Autumn was available and helped me with all the questions that I had during our stay even giving some great babysitting recommendations! The only things that detracted were not having enough towels and the fact that we couldn't cool the apartment off even though the heat was set down to 50... Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to stay again and Autumn was an excellent host."
224763,12925734,2014-05-14,12625015,Flora,"The apartment is amazing! Even better than it looks in the pictures. Autumn is a great person, very considerate. Everything worked pretty well."
224763,13223385,2014-05-22,7967678,Emily,"Gorgeous apartment!! My boyfriend and I absolutely loved it. It's immaculate and beautiful but still cozy and comfortable. It's very conveniently located, within walking distance (10 min) to Pike's Place, downtown shopping, Seattle Center, and close to bus stops. There were also really great restaurants and bars in the immediate vicinity, not to mention one amazing coffee shop/bakery that we went to every day of our trip. Autumn was an excellent host who met us at check-in, went over all the specifics of the apartment, and in general maintained clear and prompt communication throughout the reservation process and our stay. I would definitely stay here again."
224763,13407351,2014-05-27,869474,Julie,"The Belltown apartment was perfect for my family's stay in Seattle. Autumn was a great host: accommodating when we arrived a little later than anticipated; readily available when we had questions; and knowledgeable about the area's restaurants. She provided us with a pack and play and highchair which we appreciated not having to travel with.  Most of all we liked the fact that the apartment was virtually baby proof and so we did not have to watch our two-year-old constantly, and the fact that it was walking distance from both Seattle Center and Pike Place market/Downtown.

I would definitely stay at Belltown apartment again, thanks Autumn!"
224763,14005887,2014-06-09,1639443,Michael,Autumn responded very quickly which we really appreciated.  She was very organized and let us know that although she would be out of town her associate Denina would meet us to give us keys and show us around the apartment.  The photos are very accurate and the apartment was immaculate with everything there that you might need.  Denina was very thorough and helpful and even told us to call if we needed anything. The location in Belltown is perfect - we didn't have to use the car at all. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Autumn's apartment.
224763,14392581,2014-06-18,14204141,Madeleine,Our stay was a delight.   Autumn made us feel right at home.  The location to be a tourist in Seattle was the perfect choice!   We enjoyed sitting on the balcony looking down at the beautiful courtyard and its fountains while having our morning cup of coffee - hope to be back someday.  Thanks!
224763,16007859,2014-07-20,13500917,Szu-Yu,"The apartment was overall good, the location is great, the neighborhood is very convenient and a lot of good restaurants around. The bed was cozy, high chair and baby cot was a big plus, the kitchen is very well equipped, and the parking included is also a huge advantage. Everything is quite good except the air con. The air-con was a standing one, not built in and quite loud, like in many other condos. The job connecting the tube on the window was a bit crappy, and the tube fell off at our first night. The host did not have time to fix it so we fixed it with some tapes. We stayed for five nights in total, and the first two days were really hot. So it was a little annoying. But from the 3rd day on, the weather had cooled down, and it was not a problem anymore. Besides this little flaw, everything else was good. "
224763,18097938,2014-08-21,4856422,Jeremy,"The space was perfect for me, my wife, and our 2 young children. Our two and four year old children both slept on cots in the bedroom (not provided) although Autumn explained that the sofa does fold out into a bed. Location is superb: easy walking distance to sculpture garden park, Pike Place Market and Seattle's waterfront. The space is modern, clean, and very comfortable, with all traditional cooking utensils, pots and pans, and a tiny washer/dryer.

Our kids were able to nap in the bedroom while my wife an I enjoyed the small deck overlooking the courtyard and the open living room and kitchen.

The parking spot is a huge bonus, but the actual space was just wide enough to fit our Subaru Forester.

Don't miss the opportunity to enjoy a great from Macrina Bakery on the First Avenue side of the building!"
224763,21410123,2014-10-16,14864831,Michael,"It's a small, lovely place with good location for Pike Market and Jazz Alley, etc. and room faces an off street courtyard.  





"
224763,21446964,2014-10-17,21979627,Laurie,"Autumn was a terrific host and the apt was clean and comfortable.  Also great location, very convienient to most tourist attractions."
224763,21704938,2014-10-22,20234553,Donna,"Autumn was great at communicating and replying quickly. The apartment was spotless and had everything we needed in it plus some. Autumn also supplied a portable cot and high chair for our toddler which was really helpful. The facilities in the complex were great - especially the pool for wearing out the toddler when it was extra rainy. A lovely bottle of wine and some soft drink was on ice for our arrival which was a nice touch.

The apartment was in a great location for us. We walked everywhere from here - olympic structure park, pike place market, ferry terminal, science centre and seattle centre etc. There are also some great restaurants and bars within walking distance.

All in all we had a great experience here. My only negative would be that it can get a bit noisy but we were expecting that considering its the city."
224763,22247217,2014-11-02,21613119,Todd,"Autumn was responsive and accommodating from the time of our first inquiry through the check-in process.  She was even able to help us with a rather crazy travel schedule that we had.  The condo was nicely updated, the kitchen well stocked and quiet.  The best feature was its location.  It is 5-6 blocks from the Market, 5-6 blocks from Seattle Center (Chihuly Museum, Key Arena, Space Needle) and a short car ride to other areas like Capitol Hill, Queen Anne, Ballard. The immediate neighborhood in Belltown had our favorite finds - a great bakery/coffee shop (Macrina), Brazilian food and nice happy hour at The Grill from Ipanema and bars like Bathtub Gin.  We would certainly stay at Belltown Court again and it was a pleasure working with Autumn. "
224763,22819237,2014-11-15,21051958,Wayne,"Chilled white wine and flavored waters waiting when you walk in the door. Warm and inviting. Autumn is warm and welcoming. Great location.
Very small place, good for two only, a family would find it too cosy. Great to have parking, but parking space is so cramped, that even driving a Leaf, I managed to scratch the side of my car on the post that intrudes into the already tiny space. Beware!"
224763,25953034,2015-01-31,16302309,Robert,"Location was exactly what I wanted for my explorations of Seattle - While I was willing to rent a vehicle, walking and mass transit was so easy I had no need to seek alternatives. The condo I rented was exactly as pictured and envisioned and hostess, Autumn extremely helpful in explaining the unit/building and elaborating supprot services in the neighborhood - I must also say the unit was clean, safe, quiet and Easy!"
224763,28634311,2015-03-27,14066046,Josette,Autumn was very personable. The place was very nice. Cozy. Especially loved the courtyard garden and fountains. 
224763,34430489,2015-06-08,31543574,Erin,"This condo worked out great for our trip! The location is the perfect walking distance from the Public Market and the Space Needle. It was clean, quiet, has a lovely courtyard, and rooftop deck from which you have nice view of the ocean. There is a yummy bakery in the same building, Macrina Bakery, that was our chosen breakfast spot for all four days of our trip. Delicious pastries. We also visited La Vita Bella the Italian restaurant right out front of the entrance which was yummy and exceptional service! As three females we felt safe and very comfortable in this part of town. One very important note, the condo is much smaller than the pictures convey. It was a good size for three people, but would be a tight squeeze for four. Also, the parking spot in the garage is very convenient as city parking was hard to find, but the spot is VERY small!!! Be warned if you are getting a rental car, get something small as you must park within the white lines or be fined. Overall, would highly recommend this condo, just be aware of the size."
224763,39468927,2015-07-23,13348069,Maryann,"Autumn's place was exactly as described online.  It was in a perfect location, near many bars and restaurants, but also an easy walk to some of the more touristy areas and downtown.  

I travel pretty extensively for work, and staying at Autumn's was nearly like staying at a hotel, rather than an AirBnb.  Furnishing was stylish, the bed was comfortable, and having a full kitchen would be really nice for those staying longer than a day (like me).  

I would definitely stay at this, or any of Autumn's other properties again.  She was very easy to work with, and instructions for my stay very clear.

Thanks for a great overnight work trip in Seattle, Autumn!  "
224763,49608475,2015-10-05,17804210,Andy,"The place was very clean and centrally located. There are bars and restaurants within walking distance. Autumn is a very nice and easy to reach host. Only complaint I had was that the air mattress seemed to deflate every few hours and had to be re-pumped, but Autumn was quick to try to address the issue. Since we discovered it with a day left, I told Autumn not to bother."
224763,54045622,2015-11-15,21139592,Craig,"Autumn, was extremely helpful and a pleasure to meet with. Condo was great, walking distance to everything you need downtown. Would come back and looking forward to it..."
6675927,34594524,2015-06-09,34406186,Mike,"Jon was a great a host. This was my first bnb experience and he made it a great one. The room was super big and clean, the house was perfect lots of things to entertain yourself if you feel like staying in. The location was great close enough to all the restaurants and bars. He was very friendly and made sure I had everything I needed. Thanks again for everything!"
6675927,35153883,2015-06-15,34957187,Brittany,"We had an awesome experience here. The space was accurately described in the listing. When we arrived everything was very clean and Jon had left fresh towels, soap, toothpaste, toothbrushes, and clean bathrobes for us to use. We felt very comfortable during our stay. I would 100% come back for another stay. "
6675927,35591591,2015-06-20,34885541,Jiahang,This is our first time using Airbnb and Jon has made the experience a great one. Jon is a super friendly and helpful host who had given us a lot of info about where to eat and go. The house is gorgeous and super spacious. The host has a great taste of the arrangement and selection of furnitures and decorations which provides us a cozy and comfortable environment. The location is great. It is only half block from Safeway grocery store and only one block from the #11 bus station which takes you directly to downtown Seattle. I would definitely recommend Jon's house to you.
6675927,35852982,2015-06-22,25474817,Monica,"This listing was as described and less than 10 minutes of downtown and Pike's Place. There were lots of restaurants, bars, and stores all around. The neighborhood was safe and specifically his 4 unit residential area, was gated too. 

The home was spacious, very clean, and organized. Jon was super welcoming and messaged me to feel free to the snacks and liquor on the counter. I met him once the night before I left and he was very friendly. 

The master bedroom was so spacious and had a walk in closet for all our stuff to go into. The bed was super comfy. The bathroom was a shared bathroom and was kept very clean. Made sharing a bathroom easy. "
6675927,36323316,2015-06-27,35741464,Andrew,"Jon's house was clean and quiet, located in the best part of town! Easy to get to, and very comfortable! "
6675927,36707206,2015-06-30,22587252,Shelley,"Jon's place is very comfortable, clean and in a great location. The apartment has all the amenities of home (and then some!) and Jon makes you feel very welcomed. I would definitely stay there again. "
6675927,37223551,2015-07-05,9130707,Alicia,"Jon's space was a great place to stay while on vacation in Seattle. We were able to utilize the kitchen for breakfast and such which was of great convenience. Location was great, a block from the supermarket close to things to do in Capitol Hill.

Jon was very responsive when it came to communication. While we didn't see him much, he messaged us as to when air-conditioners were on the way (as it was abnormally hot for Seattle that week) and was quick to answer when I needed a hair dryer.

Definitely a great place to stay if you're looking for a longer stay, such as week."
6675927,37677252,2015-07-09,817507,Mary,"Jon is a fantastic host. His place is clean and well appointed, and he makes certain the kitchen stays stocked with items that guests are welcome to consume. He was very helpful giving directions and recommendations and accomdated our special requests with grace. The house is in a great neighborhood where you can walk to several bars, a grocery store, coffee shops, or hop on a bus that takes you all around town. Highly recommended!"
6675927,37805137,2015-07-10,31392167,Jeremiah,"Great location close to food, shopping and night life. Gracious host and awesome space. Hope I get lucky enough to say with Jon when I visit Seattle again. Made my friends 1st trip to Seattle and my 1st BnB experience really great. "
6675927,38299213,2015-07-14,2941026,Anje,"De verhuurder gaf ons een welkom gevoel. Hij maakte dat wij ons thuis voelden in zijn huis. De omschrijving was accuraat. Je kunt lopen naar Pike place Market, ongeveer een half uur of makkelijk de bus nemen.  Vandaar is veel op loopafstand. Je kunt goed parkeren in de buurt van zijn huis."
6675927,38620714,2015-07-17,28814050,Ziva,"We were immediately greeted and offered refreshments.  Beautiful ambiance, generous with their offerings of comfort.
Kitchen fully stocked for guests, coffee made for the start of each of the three mornings.
Kindly helped me receive my special delivery package: my passport.
Grocery store 1/2 block away.
Busses into town easily available.
We really enjoyed the restaurants nearby, especially The Skillet.
We felt very safe both in the neighborhood as well the city, at large"

6675927,39226559,2015-07-21,38043830,David,"Jon was a fantastic host- extremely friendly, hospitable, clean, and accommodating. He made our stay in Capitol Hill very convenient, affordable, and comfortable. His knowledge of the area is a huge plus, providing maps, books, and personal advice for what to see and do in the area. His place is gorgeous and conveniently located to shopping, public transit, and restaurants. We felt very comfortable staying here, allowing us the option of lounging in his living room watching Netflix after a long, hot day! Jon made our stay memorable and gave us a great first experience with AirBnb! We would definitely stay here again. :-)"
6675927,39357572,2015-07-22,35623810,Prasanth,"Excellent, clean and very comfortable place. Really enjoyed my stay there. This is highly recommended place to stay, in a nice calm Seattle area."
6675927,39559376,2015-07-24,22747489,Surlybasser,"Jon's house was clean and well appointed. It was the perfect place for me to crash after a very taxing week of training. I would go back without hesitation.  Tougo coffee is a about a half mile away, and worth the walk up the hill!"
6675927,39705138,2015-07-25,6623708,Eileen,The stay was very short due to a hectic business schedule. The home was lovely and clean and Jon was very accommodating to a late arrival and very early departure. 
6675927,39952566,2015-07-27,35730555,Keisha-Mae,"I was not welcomed by the host, but his partner was polite. Our host was not in the city for our duration of the stay. I was not impressed with not being able to get into contact with our host especially when we had to call the fire department for a carbon monoxide alarm. I was not impressed by this and did not feel safe. I expected safety and available communication more so if  a host is not going to be present. Later that day after informing Jon's partner, it had come to our attention that Jon had been in communication with his partner, yet this information was not passed on. "
6675927,40649639,2015-08-01,38597079,Benan,"Jon is a great host. He is super helpful, communicate in a very clear and friendly way. He is hospitable and interested in his guests. His Generosity is above and beyond. "

Large screen TV, upscale coffee/tea service, computer all available.  Close to bus line, and walk downtown not unreasonable.  Would definitely use this listing again.  Thanks"
6675927,42233138,2015-08-11,7690746,Jane,"This house is awesome! Great location, very clean and well decorated, and Jon was responsive when I got in touch. It was really nice to have the numeric keypad entry instead of having to keep track of keys. Parking was easy to find. Would definitely stay here again! "
6675927,42325640,2015-08-12,13197435,Kate,"We enjoyed our stay at Jon Shepherd's place.  The room was spacious; the bed was uber comfortable!  There were some nice touches -lovely soap, toothbrush and paste, and these melt-in-your mouth mints (Dilantante, or something like that which we found in a chocolate shop closeby).  

In the morning, we enjoyed coffee, fruit, cereal and conversation with two other guests staying at Jon's.  I would recommend   his place, located in the Capital Hill area."
6675927,42584802,2015-08-14,4872241,Bryan,Jon's home was lovely and in a great location. They were extremely accommodating and made our stay as comfortable as possible. Would definitely stay there again when we pass through Seattle.

6675927,43987617,2015-08-23,2934134,Scott,Jon's place was awesome and Jon was a great host. The location is great. You can walk to many restaurants and transit options. The house is really nice and we enjoyed sharing it with the other guests and Jon. Jon was also very flexible with a later then expected check in due to flight delays.  We would definitely stay here again!
6675927,44661804,2015-08-28,38088819,Bob,"Can't say enough about Jon and Dave. We had the run of the house, refrigerator and liquor cabinet. Felt right at home the minute we walked into the house. Great conversationalists for the short times we saw them. Loved stories of Dave's childhood in the small town Washington mountains. Bed was very comfortable; kitchen facilities adequate, and although we planned on using them, didn't have the opportunity to do so. Great location, especially for food shopping (2 blocks) and free (street) parking. Would definitely stay there again!!"
6675927,44819080,2015-08-29,2796087,Kyle,We had a pleasant stay at jon's place. The room was clean and quiet and Jon was a very friendly host. Would stay there again in the future.

Jon is amazing, he obviously takes this seriously and is available to help whenever needed. I was leaving for the airport later the next day, and it wasn't a problem for my bags to hang out there a while longer. Great to work with someone so accommodating. "
6675927,45984731,2015-09-07,455762,Andrew,"We felt very welcome and comfortable in Jon's house.  He was very generous, making his kitchen and food  available to us.   He even offered us a beer or cocktail on our arrival.  

The house is in a residential neighborhood on a busy street, with ample free street parking near by, and easy access to great shops and restaurants near by.  

I definitely recommend staying here."
6675927,46408224,2015-09-10,40073968,Suiyan,Soooo good! I will choose again when we come to Seattle again!!!
6675927,46955692,2015-09-14,28186872,Jackelyn,"Jon's place was beautiful. I love the hard wood. The place was impeccably clean. 

The neighborhood was cute and quiet but walkable to the bars in capitol hill. I also used the bus to get downtown and it was very easy and cheap. I loved Seattle and am now seriously considering moving there. 

Jon was also incredibly helpful with recommendations of things to do. We never would have known about the grove of the patriarchs at Mount Rainier national park and it was definitely a highlight of my trip. Thanks Jon!"
6675927,48777964,2015-09-28,27241232,Melvin,"Good location, clean & comfy digs. We were in town for 2 days/nights and were looking for someplace to crash at in the evenings. Jon's space was ideal. We arrived late in the evening on the first day, and decided to stay in. Jon was nice enough to offer us wine/spirits while we relaxed. "
6675927,49856086,2015-10-06,2489216,Pashmeen,Jon was a great host ! He made me and my friend feel just at home.. He is extremely knowledgeable of the area and fun things to do.. We had a great time at his place and all the conversations that followed throughout the stay!  
6675927,50154566,2015-10-09,18069072,Candice,"My partner and I decided last minute to spend one more night in Seattle during our PNW trip, and Jon was very quick to respond to our booking request. We got to meet him for a brief amount of time and he was very nice and accommodating. His place is a seriously ideal location - a short walk to a ton of great bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. The spot itself was clean and very welcoming. Thanks Jon! "
6675927,50501439,2015-10-12,31699224,Griffin,Great location near downtown Seattle. Walking distance to Capitol Hill which is a lively and vibrant district of Seattle for nightlife. Jon was very accomodating and welcoming towards me while staying in his home. The room itself was spacious and comfortable.
6675927,50902335,2015-10-15,39334793,Grace,"Jon's place blew our air bnb expectations out of the water ❤ we have never stayed anywhere so great through air bnb, house was safe, easy access and so clean! -- the hosts were a perfect mix of attentive and accomodating, have us plenty of space to do our work but were so friendly.. Wished every experience was this good!"
6675927,51638137,2015-10-22,21491271,Donnita,"This is about my 4th airbnb, and quite possibly the best.  Jon ( and David) we're very personable and helpful.  The home and room we're beautifully decorated and maintained.  The bed was very comfortable.  As hosts they we're very thoughtful and accomodating while maintaining privacy for everyone.  Just an overall great experience!!!"
6675927,51801108,2015-10-24,2262326,Jane,Jon was a great friendly host. The house is cozy and nice. The bedroom is actually bigger than what I initially imagined. It was a very pleasant stay.
6675927,53137694,2015-11-05,10951925,Joan,"Communication with Jon was good and we were made to feel welcomed in his home.  Jon and David were helpful in making suggestions to us since this was our first trip to Seattle. Location was great  - close to the bus or a short walk to restaurants, groceries. Bed was comfortable and tons of closet space for guests."
6675927,53485174,2015-11-09,8014596,Susan,"Jon is a wonderful and welcoming host.  This was the second time we stayed in Jon's lovely home. We hope to stay with him every time we come to Seattle to visit our family.  We love it that Jon provides a clean, comfortable place to relax. It is quiet and cozy. The kitchen is so well stocked and he is very generous about sharing everything. We also love it that there is parking within walking distance. Remember - this is Seattle and parking is often hard to come by. Each bedroom has it's own heat/air control which made for greater comfort.  Thank you, Jon, for another great stay!"
6675927,54251244,2015-11-17,46326260,Roxanne,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was wonderful! My girlfriends and I decided on a weekend getaway to Seattle since we have never been and this place was an excellent home base location for all our tourist and adventure needs. There was construction going on in the street in front of the house, but it was still easily accessible using Lyfts and Ubers. Our flight arrived early and Jon was very accommodating by having our room ready a few hours early as we dropped off our bags and made ourselves comfortable in the living room. The place is very clean and well decorated with more amenities than I could ask for such as an accessible computer, Netflix, and board games. The room itself is spacious with a comfortable bed and large closet. You will be sharing the upstairs bathroom if there is another guest on the other room but there is also a half bathroom downstairs. Jon made us feel welcomed and gave us a good balance of interaction with privacy. The only thing I would warn about is that you can hear movement of other people throughout the house (footsteps upstairs when you are downstairs and vice versa) but if that doesn't bother you then you should be fine! I would definitely recommend!"
6675927,54557161,2015-11-21,4970301,Patti,"This was my second visit to Jon's house.  This time I stayed in the master bedroom. It was very comfortable.  I find the location very convenient and will stay here again.  Thanks, John!
Lonnie (Patti's other half)"
6675927,54897846,2015-11-25,6171523,Rowena,"Jon's place is centrally located and very easy to get around to many places in Seattle which was a plus since we rented a car. Room is as described and bed was extremely comfortable. Did not see Jon too much since my bf and I were out exploring majority of the day but he was very accomodating and responded quickly to any questions we had. Light breakfast (cereal, toast, etc) and coffee/tea were made available to us which was extremely helpful and Jon was very kind and generous to also offer us some beverages. Overall, we had a great time and would recommend Jon's home to anyone visiting Seattle!"
6675927,55509219,2015-12-01,1340403,Kar,Jon was out most of the time but the place was near to everything and we basically walked everywhere! Would definitely consider his place again if I am visiting. 
6675927,56340783,2015-12-12,21607838,Jason,"Great place to hang, Jon and his mate were great hosts and I would be happy to stay again"
6675927,56891306,2015-12-19,13972159,Erin,"Jon offers a very warm, friendly and relaxing home. He is a great host that goes above & beyond and I would definitely stay again. I felt very at home in Jon's house and he made it extra special with all the small touches he adds like filter coffee, light breakfast option of cereal, local books and pamphlets, toothpaste, soap etc.... 
Highly recommend staying with Jon!!"
6675927,57093334,2015-12-21,17531456,Rebecca,"What a great location and an inviting house. When we arrived our host was there to greet us and show us around. I'll admit that my partner and I were rather reclusive and tired during our one night stay but felt invited to enjoy the main rooms if we had wished to.

One more thing, the bed was amazingly comfortable and now I want one."
6675927,57318821,2015-12-24,33470376,木,"用中文描述也许会更多的帮助和我一样的朋友。Jon 的家的地理位置非常不错，在比较市中心的地方，当然整个西雅图并不大。出了家门步行就有快餐店和便利店以及加油站，非常方便。家里的小院和路边都可以免费停车。开车5～10分钟左右可以到附近的植物园，空气非常好，可以在里面散步。
我们住的房间是楼上相对大些的房间，一切都够用，整个房间有两户租户，Jon本人也住在地下室，两个租户分别使用一层和二层两个卫生间以及分享一个浴室。歪果仁在家都是光脚走来走去，如果你不习惯可以自带一双拖鞋。Jon贴心的准备了洗漱用品，包括牙刷牙膏洗发水洗面奶都是很好的品牌，而不是一般汽车旅馆不知道的品牌。Jon的厨房里有咖啡、茶、面包，如果你想方便或者省钱可以直接在家DIY。
非常好的体验。"
6675927,57812387,2015-12-29,2753279,Matt,"Jon's place was so much better than we expected. It was warm, beautiful, and perfect for staying for the holidays. Not only that, but Jon and his friend decided last minute to grab a Christmas tree and decorate, which was perfect for us and made it possible for us to have small Christmas gathering with my girlfriend's family. It gave us a place to put our gifts and filled the house with the smell of Christmas. There were labels on every important item and drawer in the kitchen, which made the space feel surprisingly welcome. We can't even begin to describe how wonderful it was! They clearly enjoy hosting and were  gracious with our needs and requests.

We'll definitely be looking at Jon's unit again for the next time we stay in Seattle!

P.S. My girlfriend loved the decor of the place, and wanted to thank our hosts for the small things like our guest towels, toothpaste & brushes."
5760902,31378026,2015-05-04,31697046,Trevor,"The listing description was accurate.  The location is great, about halfway between the Space Needle and Pike Place Market.  Both are easily walkable in a few minutes and there are other bars and restaurants around, too.  The neighborhood seemed safe enough.  There's a fire station a block away and there are some trash cans in the alley, so it's noisy sometimes.  I still had no trouble sleeping.  We were able to check in by phone, which was really convenient.  There was plenty of toilet paper and other toiletry stuff like shampoo and toothpaste, and if you forgot anything else or need a bag of chips at 11 PM, there is a market directly across the street.  We'd stay here again.  "
5760902,32396908,2015-05-17,795822,Miglena,"We stayed at Jes and Ashley's place over the weekend and loved it. They were very responsive and accommodating prior to and during our stay, and although we didn't get to meet, they made us feel welcomed. The place is a gem, and best of all is the location. It's walking distance from everything you can see downtown and nearby neighborhoods, which was key for our short stay. Don't think twice when you book your next stay in Seattle!"
5760902,33130806,2015-05-25,30881248,Kara,"We had a great stay! Convenient location, 10 min walk to Pikes, 10 min walk to space needle. Owner very friendly and helpful with suggestions for the city life. Seemed Very receptive to feedback. The area was a little rough after 10pm, but honestly We never felt unsafe. Mind your business and everyone minds theirs! Overall an Awesome weekend! "
5760902,33812857,2015-06-01,926219,Smita,"I had a very comfortable stay at Jes and Ashley's place. The location is great and it is easy to walk to most places, including Space Needle, Pike Market and Seattle Art Museum. The apartment is spacious, gets lots of light, has all the essential amenities and is close to some nice cafes and restaurants in Belltown. Jes was always quick and helpful in communicating."
5760902,34321679,2015-06-07,1880951,Samantha,"A friend and I stayed here for a fun weekend after a work event in Gig Harbor earlier in the week. Jesse and Ashley's apartment is comfortable and in a really great location - we loved the Belltown neighborhood and were able to walk to Seattle Center, Pike Place (of course) and lots of delicious neighborhood cafes and bars. Jesse was flexible with checking in/out and gave us thorough and helpful suggestions on where we should go!"
5760902,34868610,2015-06-13,32451230,Jim,"We were met by Jesse outside the apartment for a really easy check in.  He was extremely welcoming and was open to any ideas to improve guests' experience.
The apartment was perfectly located so that we could walk to any of the tourist sites.  Public transit was close including the Link stop about 10 min away.   Belltown is a great neighborhood with lots of places to eat and things to do.
The apartment was clean and functional and had extra bonuses like shampoo, razors, toothbrush etc if you forgot something.  The bed was also very comfortable.
The building was pretty quiet, although people in the back alley could get a bit loud on weekends. 
Overall, this was a nice studio in a great neighborhood for exploring Seattle. Jesse and Ashley were helpful hosts and we would recommend the apartment."
5760902,35302843,2015-06-17,31799214,Tyler,"Our stay was very nice! The room was clean and ready once we got there, full of everything we needed, and check out was a breeze! The room is in a great spot and I would stay there again."
5760902,36018394,2015-06-24,16776621,Alexandra,"Perfect spot to discover the city, close to everything. Nice and easy interaction with Jes."
5760902,36276416,2015-06-27,13545665,Maureen,"Great neighborhood and great host. Was accommodating in meeting us and getting us set up in the apartment, as well as answering questions we had about good locations to eat in the area and transportation.  Easy booking and easy stay!"
5760902,36873479,2015-07-02,26756393,Kathie,"Positive experience. Clean, well represented, simple. If you stay there in the summer, be aware there is no A/C. "
5760902,37158270,2015-07-05,211522,Spencer,"Jes and Ashley were great hosts. Jes met us at the apartment and gave us some great recommendations of places to go during our stay. The apartment was in a perfect location - easy to walk to both Pike's Place and the Space Needle as well as other surrounding districts (Capitol Hill, South Lake Union). We spent a long 4th of July weekend here and it made the trip a great one. The apartment very clean, and was stocked with everything we could possibly need (towels, blankets, cooking utensils, etc). Jes and Ashley communicated consistently, which made our trip stress-free. I wild definitely recommend the place to friends! Thanks Jes & Ashley!"
5760902,37651731,2015-07-09,32393403,Kim,Super convenient location in Seattle. Great no frills place and check in/out was smooth. Would recommend!
5760902,38121258,2015-07-13,17268868,Caroline,Awesome space and great location to all the Seattle attractions. Easy walking distance to Space Needle and Pike Place Market as well as great restaurants. Jes was super helpful with getting us settled in and his place was clean and well stocked. Would stay here again!
5760902,38715240,2015-07-18,33526676,Rachel,"Jesse and Ashley were great hosts. Their apartment was clean and full of all the things we needed to help make our stay great. He showed us a map the first day, which proved helpful the whole time we were there and met us for first day to get us the keys. It was a great size for the three of us and we loved having a kitchen to make meals in. I would recommend this place to anyone!"
5760902,39277834,2015-07-22,28361827,Christiana,Awesome place with close proximity to awesome bars and restaurants. Place was very clean and cozy. Jes was definitely very accommodating in helping us get in and setting up the AC for us.
5760902,39623833,2015-07-25,28168020,Nikki,"Highly recommend!! This apartment was walkable to all the sites in Seattle, but also far enough from all the foot traffic of the Pike Place Market. Jes was extremely accommodating and very helpful. We had a great experience staying in their apartment and would definitely stay here again!"
5760902,39919894,2015-07-27,4894959,Karin,"Jesse met us outside the apartment and gave us an immediate tour of the apartment so we knew where everything was and how to use all the appliances.  The location of the apartment was absolutely perfect which made getting around on foot to the bars and restaurants very easy.  The apartment itself is small yet quaint but we didn't spend much time there so it worked out perfect!  A great home base for resting mid-day.  
Location of this apartment would be a perfect 10 if not for the noise in the back alley at night where the windows are.  
If you are looking for a cute and charming apartment in the city, this is not for you. Feels very much like staying at a college student's apartment.  But if you want easy access to all the city's attractions, this is definitely the place for you!  
"
5760902,41070292,2015-08-04,31151116,Francis,"Very happy with our stay in Seattle.
This apartment was very clean, and had all the right amenities that we needed. I would recommend this little cozy apartment to anyone.
Very close to lots of nice places to visit.

Thanks again for everything.

Cheers

Francis"
5760902,41518332,2015-08-07,20230630,Denzil,"Great location and quiet with a back alley outside so no traffic. We enjoyed not sharing with anyone else. Security was very good and the apartment came fully equipped including access to their Netflix account. I would recommend the apartment to anyone who is looking for relaxation and being central to most things in Seattle. Also great communication, Ryan was responsive immidietly. Do not hesitate to book."
5760902,41588108,2015-08-08,31702106,Jacky,Listing was accurate and place was nice. 
5760902,42844585,2015-08-16,28721785,Brent,"Ryan was really flexible with the check-in time.  He had the apartment cleaned, stocked and ready to go so once we got there we didn't have any issues.  It was a little warm the day we got there so he already had the portable air-conditioner running and it made the room very nice. He was helpful in showing us a map and talking options for dinner.

Great location right in between the Space Needle and Pike's Market, so everything is within walking distance.  A glass-blowing studio (where you can do it yourself) is just out the back door.  Neat!  We were also just a short bus ride away from the stadiums ($2.75 per person peak hours) so we could catch a pre-season football game.

Apartment had good internet access, cable TV and Netflix.

There is parking out front for 2 hours at a time.  It'll get pricey, so plan on parking in a lot.  We chose the Securities building (Macy's is in the same building) parking garage about 4 blocks away at $27 per 24 hours.  It was well lit and easy to get into and out of.  There are a couple cheaper options, but be aware that you might have to plug a meter twice a day.  We just parked our car, picked it up three days later, and paid on the way out with a credit card.

The only downside with the apartment is that I would prefer a slightly better mattress.  It's not bad by any means, but I'd put it in the OK/average range.  My wife and I have a latex mattress at home and there's nothing better than to wake up after sleeping on a good mattress.  No matter where you stay, the mattress is always a craps shoot, so you could say that this one ain't all that bad.

My wife is very picky about where we stay and she was very pleased with this choice.  She certainly has no hesitations about coming back.  It is certainly on our short list for when we come back...I might not even try anywhere else.  It's a great location and will save you some $ over the hotels."
5760902,43376700,2015-08-19,3728446,Suzee,"Ryan meet us to check us in. He was really helpful and gave us loads of great info. to help us enjoy our stay. The apartment is super well located. There are many fun things to do with in walking distance. We had every thing we needed in a clean, efficient space. "
5760902,43678794,2015-08-21,5051346,Aisha Breeze,"Ryan was very accommodating when my husband and I arrived in Seattle late at night. He met us at the apartment, explained all of the amenities and things available to us in the neighborhood, and made it really easy to check in/check out. The apartment was clean, comfortable, well-stocked, and conveniently located. "
5760902,44118183,2015-08-24,35420620,Shawn,"Awesome place to stay, it was an easy walk to all the main areas in seattle. Very comfy and had everything we needed. "
5760902,44911787,2015-08-30,5954029,Owen,"Great studio in the heart of the Belltown neighborhood that is easily walkable to many of the sights to see! Less than 10 minutes to the Space Needle, and about the same in the opposite direction to Pike Place Market.  Good restaurants and coffee shops nearby. 

The studio was exactly as advertised and our host was pleasant and helpful when we checked in.  The apartment windows are on an alley which can get a bit noisy at night, but I was not bothered by it-- the apartment is in an urban space in the center of downtown Seattle after all.  

I would certainly stay here again the next time I visit Seattle."
5760902,45292927,2015-09-01,25933855,Oriana,Great location and a very straightforward check-in. Clean and big enough apartment.
5760902,45980746,2015-09-07,39273534,Madeleine,Ashley and Ryan were great hosts. The place was lovely and well located. Would recommend! 
5760902,46578608,2015-09-12,28649146,Sam,Great location! Check in was seamless and the apartment was as described. The host supplied fresh towels and other supplies. The apartment is clean.

5760902,47265862,2015-09-17,8616211,Roman,"Ryan met us in front of his building and gave us a nice overview of the apartment. It is in a nice location about a 10 minute walk from Pike's Market and about 15 minutes from the Space Needle so good for visitors. The apartment itself was nicely maintained and Ryan definitely puts a lot of thought into what visitors will like. He was one of the most thoughtful Airbnb owners I have come across. The apartment was clean, had the basics and we had no issues with any part of the apartment.

The only gripe we had was that because we arrived on a Tuesday, we could not check in until 5 PM (which is detailed in the description). So be aware that if you are arriving on a Tuesday or Thursday morning, you will have to carry your bags until you can check in."
5760902,47499451,2015-09-19,3165143,Dino,"Ryan was a great host and the apartment was clean and as described. The apartment is in a great location, only 10-15 minute walk to Pike Place Market or the Space Needle."
5760902,48714484,2015-09-28,40508959,Anna,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was great!!! (: 
We absolutely loved the location, it was in walking distance of everything. 
Ryan was great! He met us right outside of the building at check in time. Showed us how to use everything and explained where everything was. 
We really enjoyed our time in Seattle! "
5760902,49131973,2015-10-01,42637892,William,"Ryan was very friendly and helpful right away. He got us into the apartment as soon as possible. Initially there were problems with the t.v. which he soon remedied with a replacement. The apartment was very nice and stocked with plenty of extras that we might have needed. He was quick to respond to us with any question we had. There was plenty of literature about the area in the room including: area maps, bus schedules, local hotspots, etc. He had books, DVDs, packs of cards, and access to Netflix to entertain us later in the day. Overall we had a great experience and overall if we come back to Seattle we would definitely check to see if he is available."
5760902,49341800,2015-10-03,4540310,Arielle,"Our stay here was great! Ryan (Nick?) was at the apartment waiting for us when we arrived from the airport. We took public transit from SeaTac and had a very easy time finding our way. Ryan left a map of the area and guidebooks to help travelers get a feel for the city, and even gave us some personal recommendations for spots nearby. He actually packed up his clothes and personal items and took them with him, so that anything left behind was for the use of guests, making it feel more like we were staying at a guest house than in someone's apartment without them there. Kind of cool. We had an easy walk to Pike's place market and downtown, and used uber to catch (cheap) rides to Ballard and Capitol Hill when we wanted to explore more. We had an easy checkout as well. The only downside was the noise at night. It seemed like there were people making noise in the alley below the window almost all night and morning. My boyfriend and I got a rough first night's sleep. I'm a very light sleeper, and bring ear plugs when I travel because you never know. The second night we found the fan in the closet, and with some white noise had a much better rest. So, knowing the fan is there for a little buffer, I would stay here again if I wanted to be in the downtown area!"
5760902,49797463,2015-10-06,24804881,Fernanda,"Ryan was great, the place was clean and well located and we would stay again! Some folks mentioned in previous reviews about the back alley noise, we didn't hear anything unusual for a city and had a peaceful night. "
5760902,50094752,2015-10-09,43731106,Raquel,"Ryan met us at the door to give us the keys and show us around.  He was very friendly and answered all our questions about the neighborhood.  This was our first AirBnB experience, and we were so comfortable with Ryan we will use AirBnb again!  The location was perfect for walking everywhere we wanted to go.  Restaurants and coffee shops were abundant.  Thanks for the great Seattle experience!"
5760902,50468049,2015-10-12,15347187,Connie,Ryan's apartment was the perfect location. It is located in between the Space Needle and Pike Place Market. Both within walking distance. Ryan met us outside the apartment and gave us a tour of the apartment and provided us with tips and restaurants to go to. The apartment was clean and had extra necessities. I would stay here again if I come back to Seattle.
5760902,51138715,2015-10-18,42943802,Kristina,"My first Airbnb experience. I am really thankful we found this place. Thanks Ashley and Ryan, it was really good.

The place is in an awesome location - really close to Pike Place market and the Space needle, as well as loads of yummy restaurants and right across the street from a pretty cool sports bar if you're in the mood to watch NFL."

5760902,53647315,2015-11-10,47859942,Rachel,"It was a really great experience in Seattle thanks to Ryan's apartment, it was convenient and close to everything. A small grocery store is in front of the building which was helpful when we did not want to go the restaurant. The apartment is comfortable with the necessary equipment, we really enjoyed it and Ryan was welcoming, he explained and showed us everything and answered to our questions. "
5760902,53934175,2015-11-14,4304632,Ana,"The location and price is great! Lovely neighborhood; we walked to Space Needle, Pike Market place, great restaurants with in walking distance also. Our interaction with hosts was minimal, but communication was great. We were able to check in 45 minutes early, as soon as the previous guests left and the place was cleaned up. The place was clean, and we especially liked the attention to details; toothpaste, bandaids, umbrellas, guidebooks, all nice touches. "
5760902,54102417,2015-11-16,43388663,Ross,"This was our first Airbnb experience. We met Ryan who was great. He gave us some helpful tips for the local area. The apartment was clean and met all our needs. It was conveniently located near a lot of Seattle's attractions, bars and restaurants. Would happily stay again with Ashley and Ryan if we return to Seattle. "
5760902,54762284,2015-11-23,47941771,Jennifer,"Our stay here was amazing. My boyfriend and I were in Seattle for four days and the room description was pretty accurate. Ryan's check in was quick, we met up with him infront of the building, he let us in, gave us a tour of the place and he actually gave us advice and told us which places to visit. From the airport, you can take the Link Light Rail for $3 each person which is 30 minutes away from downtown then walk to the apartment, the walk was about 10 minutes. That way is cheaper than taking Uber or Taxi. The apartment is right in middle of the city, so we walked everywhere; Space Needle, Pike Place Market, Pier, Aquarium, Malls, and Outlets. There were so many things we ended up doing! The apartment also comes with kitchen appliances if the guests ever end up wanting to cook, like us. (Salt, Pepper, Oil, Pans, Pots, Knives, etc) So that was also a plus for us. The only little problem we had was the radiator kept making a hissing sound, but like I said, ""little problem"", we basically just got used to it. The bed was very comfortable. The building was also very quiet. There really was no view, but the view wasn't a big deal to us either. Other than that, we would definitely be staying in this building again!"
5760902,55025647,2015-11-27,16831762,Doris,"The location is great,really close to both Pike place market and space needle.The decription of the room is accurate and the landlord is so nice and helped us a lot,providing lots of useful (website hidden) is a wonderful trip to me and my friends,especially for having a tidy and comfortable place to stay. "
5760902,55241187,2015-11-29,22615295,Ahmad,"Ryan thought of everything for us before we could ask for it. Ryan provided towels and access to everything in the house. He took out all personal belongings to make us feel welcome and use the place as if it was our own home.  Everything was the way it was listed and better. The place was nice and cozy and the access to the Roku and Netflix made the stay relaxing. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here, it was a 10/10 experience. The apartment is really close to downtown and the space needle and Pike Place. Great location."
5760902,55757858,2015-12-05,15588395,Josh,"Ryan was very friendly and totally cool with meeting for a late check-in (that was even further delayed than originally planned). The apartment is in an older building, but was exactly as described. Lots of space and well-stocked with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Since it's located in the heart of Belltown, the pedestrian noise outside at late hours was noticeable at times, but personally was never a problem for getting sleep. Overall a great space with easy access to all the popular spots in Seattle."
5760902,56385722,2015-12-13,6637400,Julia,"Our stay at Ryan's place was perfect. The apartment was really nice, clean and its location is great, surrounded by really good restaurants an bars. Ryan is the perfect host. He was really helpfull, gave us some good advice about the area and made sure we had everything we needed. We had a few questions during our stay and he replied almost immediately. I would definitely recommend the place and consider staying here next time I'm in Seattle. Thanks for everything, Ryan!"
5760902,56874022,2015-12-19,50138399,Priscilla,"It was wonderful! The apartment is directly located near all the major places to see in Seattle, such as: the Library, Space Needle Pike Place, etc. The apartment itself was absolutely adorable. Ryan left the basic essentials, so long term stays aren't left too empty handed. It was a great experience for my first Airbnb, and I completely recommend Ryan's studio apartment! "
5760902,57464980,2015-12-26,37390898,Susan,"Ryan is very friendly and he is so nice to meet us very late at night due to our flight was first cancelled and then delayed twice.   The apartment is show as in picture and very clean.  The location is also convenient to get around to everywhere we wants to go.

5760902,57711024,2015-12-28,51365317,Charlie,Excellent host with a great location. Unit was clean and well cared for. Very easy to explore downtown Seattle by walking. Would recommend if you're looking for an affordable place to stay. Jesse provides hot cocoa and necessities just in case you forgot to pack.

6403104,49020273,2015-09-30,24445646,Lucia,Elizabeth and her family were very welcoming. We felt like we were getting more and more attached to them as the days went on. This was the best home for us to stay in for the amount of time we needed. The room was big and clean along with the bathroom that we had as our own space within the house. Liz and her family are very accommodating and love to make their home as comfortable as possible. We loved staying here and we would recommend anyone to stay here as well. 
6403104,53071707,2015-11-04,46591733,Christopher,Simply the best. This place is unbelievable! The hospitality is off the charts. The host family is so welcoming and caring. If you are outgoing and love family this is the place to be. Period!

4910140,26936321,2015-02-22,27005526,TheEbilein,"Auch wenn die Reise nach Amerika ging und ich dort fast ausschließlich englisch gesprochen habe, werde ich diese Bewertung mal aus Bequemlichkeit auf deutsch verfassen und hoffe auf die Leistung des Airbnb-Übersetzers. :)

Ich hatte bereits eine Woche in Seattle verbracht, als ich zu Betsy kam.
Der Kontakt und die Kommunikation vor der Ankunft verlief schnell und reibungslos.
Am Abend meiner Ankunft hat sie mich freundlich empfangen und ich fand sie auch gleich super sympathisch. Das Zimmer ist echt schön und ich habe mich darin sehr wohl gefühlt, wenngleich das Bett etwas kurz ist und ich mit meinen 1,82m etwas Überlänge hatte. Betsy ist eine tolle Gastgeberin, sie hat für mich Platz in der Küche, im Kühlschrank und im Bad vorbereitet, sodass ich alles verstauen konnte. W-Lan/Internet war auch kein Problem. Sie hat mir sogar jeden Morgen Kaffee gekocht, obwohl sie selbst gar keinen trinkt. Das ist Service :-)

Die Lage ist ruhig, aber man kommt mit dem Bus auch schnell nach Downtown, ins Getümmel. Der nächste Supermarkt und die Bushaltestelle sind nur ca. 10-15 Minuten Fußweg entfernt. Es ist also was für jeden der gern etwas Ruhe genießt aber trotzdem auch etwas Unternehmen will.
Der Preis ist für deutsche Verhältnisse recht hoch, da man aber in Amerika sowieso nicht mit europäischen Maßstäben rechnen kann, wie ich lernen musste, denke ich, dass es angemessen ist.

Alles in allem habe Ich meinen Aufenthalt bei Betsy sehr genossen und kann die Unterkunft nur wärmstens weiterempfehlen!

4910140,32736673,2015-05-20,1238588,Allison,The host canceled this reservation 59 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4910140,34264119,2015-06-06,17468680,Kate,Betsy's home is both beautiful and comfortable. She is a thoughtful and delightful hostess. I felt very welcomed during my stay. I would definitely love to stay again!
4910140,40254024,2015-07-29,12431619,Elizabeth,"Betsy made me feel immediately welcome. We had some things in common that made conversation easy.  She offered fresh eggs from her chickens, zucchini from her garden & tea from her Shaklee business (though I wasn't able to partake in the first two). She also made great recommendations on things to do & shared in conversations about my daily exploits.  "
4910140,40651241,2015-08-01,38481871,Christian,"Betsy was a great woman that really did have so much to offer. She was organized and helped me to get settled. She offered a lot of stories and it was fascinating to talk with her. The house was very private and was in a very quiet and beautiful part of town. As far as transportation, it was about a 10 min walk to the bus which lead downtown. I was extremely appreciative and hope I can go back soon. Thanks Betsy and Happy Birthday again!"
4910140,40993140,2015-08-03,4276693,Evan,"I had a very pleasant stay at Betsy's place. Perfect for one person; great sense of privacy, clear communication, etc, everything you'd expect! The house is located on a quiet residential street about a 10-15 minute walk from the main commercial stretch along California Ave (where you can pick up the express C bus to Downtown Seattle), so do plan on walking a little if you don't arrive by car. 
 "
4910140,43393742,2015-08-19,25773326,Ella,"Betsy is an excellent host. She was very welcoming and invited me along on some excursions during my stay. I enjoyed getting to know her when I wasn't out exploring the Seattle.
The area is out of the bustle of the city, which I enjoyed. There is a 10-15 minute walk to a bus that goes directly downtown. I managed to see a lot of the city using only public transport. Don't let the location put you off. 
I would stay with Betsy again without hesitation. "
4910140,44106141,2015-08-24,32785464,Kristen,Betsy was a great host.  Her property is very nice and clean.  I only stayed for one night but I would definitely recommend her accommodations. 
4910140,44850040,2015-08-29,35672187,Sharda,"My stay at Betsy's home was relaxing and provided the quiet I was looking for.  Betsy offer much-welcomed advice on how to get around easily and with little cost.  The back yard of the property is spacious and verdant and offered me time to recharge as I sat surrounded by varieties of trees, plants and flowers.  
The walk from the bus to the house is a bit of a healthy hike up a hill. But the neighborhood in West Seattle is quiet and safe, and has some amazing views.    This is my first time as an Airbnb user and I am glad to report it was overall successful.

Sincerely,
Sharda

4910140,46030425,2015-09-07,16883968,Sage,"Can I just say that I have the best time in Seattle. Betsy is a wonderful host. She is helpful in so may ways, so just ask her! And she definitely makes the best suggestions for 'things to do in Seattle.'  She was a pleasure to talk to. 
In terms of the location, do not be put off by the distance from the house to the bus stop. It is only 10 minutes walking distance. The bus takes you right into downtown which makes your trip planning a lot easier. 
The neighborhood itself is called Alaska Junction. There are many cute shops, restaurants and a 24 hour grocery store within walking distance(by the bus stop).
The room is shown as the picture, cozy and sweet. It is quite spacious. You have a lot room to put your personal belongings. 
I personally enjoyed my stay at Betsy's very much.  "
4910140,46257117,2015-09-08,41777220,Samaneh,Betsy was one of the best hosts I have ever had. She responded to my late request very quickly. She was friendly and warm during my stay and I had amazing time chatting with her.

for single person visiting Washington state for the first time or just to get  away from the noise of the city. There is even a Trader Joe's 
close by. With all that said, the best part of my stay was meeting Betsy. It felt like coming home.........thank you Betsy.  "

The bathroom is shared but was not an issue.  Staying with Betsy was like staying with a friend or relative.  I would stay here again.
4910140,51340144,2015-10-19,922024,Claudia,"This is a very quiet and comfortable room in an otherwise hectic city. The view from the window is of a lovely back garden. The neighborhood is pretty to walk through and the public transportation is convenient and very fast to downtown. Betsy is charming, helpful, and respectful. I felt quite at home. "
4910140,55425938,2015-12-01,47136521,Drew,"As my first Airbnb host, Betsy has really set the bar high. When we first got in contact, she was as responsive as one could be. She is incredibly warm, welcoming and caring. Expect enjoyable conversations and stories too! 

Her house is on a quiet street, perfectly located between Alki Beach, West Seattle Junction and Admiral. It means amazing views and walking routes and also close to shopping, grocery stores, cafes...

The bedroom has plenty of space and lots of character. There's a huge closet, a bureau and a space heater. And is generally very comfortable.

Staying with Betsy has been a wonderful experience that I would absolutely do again!"

Great location too, very quiet and well connected."
3720511,29845099,2015-04-13,21189694,Bryan,"Malory was very friendly and accommodating welcoming my parents and younger sister into her home for my wedding week. The townhouse is stunning and well-equipped and provides easy access to Queen Anne, Fremont, and downtown Seattle. The street parking was the best we've seen! The Zen/Japanese vibe of the house was also very cool. They had a wonderful stay! Thanks so much!"

8474294,51219173,2015-10-18,44631,Bradford,"A beautiful, clean house in a convenient location marred by a bad management company. 

I love AirBnB to death, but this may be the first negative AirBnB review I leave after ... 100+ stays. Which is unfortunate. 

Here's a list of issues:
1. I never spoke with the owners. The house is run by Pillow, a management co. This is a critical part of the AirBnB experience to me -- knowing who you're dealing with and getting their perspective on the community. Also, only the owners know how the house is set up. 
2. The management company, Pillow, is pretty incompetent. I had problems getting my key (the instructions were vague). I called them twice, waiting 15 rings (!) before someone picked up. That person then just repeated the same vague instructions. Unhelpful. 
3. THEY WANTED TO CHARGE ME $25 FOR AN EXTRA PILLOW. And wouldn't give extra blankets. The house is *huge*. Surely there's an extra pillow somewhere? But all the cabinets were locked.  Because of bad pillows, I spent most of Sunday with pretty nasty neck pain. 
4. Never in my entire AirBnB history can I remember someone refusing to let us check out after 11am. 
5. Uncomfortable, cheap linens, thin pillows, and comforters that obviously came from the management co.


I bet the owners are kind people, and the house *is* beautiful. But having an incompetent management company really ruined this. "

649243,2478019,2012-10-01,1667618,John,"Kay was a great host.  Very accommodating to my needs.  Gave great tips on places to eat - which is a big deal for my GF/celiac diet - and great tips on what to see locally: Freemont market, Theo's and the Ballard locks.  Lots to do and see here and your just 15 min bus ride to Seattle.  I was able to take the metro from the airport to within a block of their house.  The house has a calming atmosphere and beautiful kitchen.  I really appreciate them calling me when my suit case was delivered - a day after I arrived. I would stay there again."

The room was clean and quiet, with a very comfortable bed, shelves and a big closet, and a big bathroom next door (the ceiling shower was great).  They have a beautiful kitchen, and Dennis is an experienced espresso maker!  Their house is at the top of a hill, with a lovely view of Salmon Bay.  It was an easy walk from their house to the part of Fremont where I spent most of my time.  I had an unexpected migraine over the weekend, and Kay and Dennis were very solicitous and helpful.  This was my first experience staying with AirBnB hosts, and I enjoyed talking with Kay and Dennis and getting to know them a bit.  I highly recommend their place!"

The bathroom we had access to was incredible and one of the best parts of our trip!  Their home was charming and beautiful. One morning we received an impromptu invite to join Kay and her friends for breakfast, during which we got to wear fantastic hats. Not only that, but on the night we arrived, Kay treated us to homemade sorbet. We truly had a great time, and enjoyed chatting with our hosts about our lives, Seattle, and our hometown of St. Louis. It was conveniently located in Fremont, near the sights but on a quiet street, and close to bus lines. We highly recommend staying here!"

649243,4844080,2013-05-28,2821640,Cj,Kay and Dennis were awesome. Staying at their house is like going on a retreat and being pampered!  The house is as warm and inviting as the company.  Our stay was most enjoyable.  Hope to stay again.
649243,4954245,2013-06-03,4873374,Eric,"Kay's house is in close distance to the many food and entertainment options available in the Fremont neighborhood. Kay offered me food after my late arrival which helped me avoid having to go back out and find something to eat. The room is definitely small and windowless, though I think a dark room brings the best sleep. "
649243,5044349,2013-06-09,4060976,Jess,Kay and her husband were lovely hosts. She even helped me with my luggage. I will definitely stay here again when I come through Seattle.

649243,5534141,2013-07-04,5229025,Tony,"Kay has a beautiful home in Fremont that was very conveniently located to public transportation. During our stay we traveled by bicycle and access to the Burke-Gilman bike trail was only 2 blocks away. If you prefer travel by bus, the bus stop is even closer at just 1 block away. They were very accommodating and allowed access to their garage to store our rental bikes. We never felt uncomfortable coming and going from the house. I loved the fact that the entry points were by number access, this saved us any trouble of losing keys.

The house was fully renovated with very high end materials and the bathroom is TO DIE FOR. Simply gorgeous and very high end.  My fiance and I were discussing copying their design!  I miss the rain shower head.  There are 3 bathrooms and there was never an issue of access. 

Kay and Dennis always had great suggestions as far as navigating the city by bicycle and suggesting places to see along the way to our destination.  They were very friendly and respectable hosts.

Fremont also has some very very very good restaurants within walking distance of Kay's home. Paseo (get the cuban press or carribean sandwich) Best sandwich I've had, craving for it right now. But you can find anything from asian, mexican, italian, to american.

Coming from Florida, where we live in A/C 365 days a year, it was unexpected to find out that most homes and restaurants in the Northwest Pacific do not have a/c. It probably didn't help that we also arrived on one of Seattle's HOTTEST week this year, so the first night took some acclimating. The bedroom is on the subfloor which helps keep things cooler, however there are no windows in the bedroom so we had to rely on a fan to keep cool. Any other week and it probably would have been perfect, but we managed.

Overall, I can highly recommend staying with Kay and Dennis.  For the price, location, and 5-star bathroom its a win-win situation.

649243,5897874,2013-07-21,685137,Lucas,Kay was out of town but her husband Dennis was home. Very sweet guy. I highly recommend a stay with Kay and Dennis. They have a beautiful home in cool part of Seattle close to some of the best restaurants in  town (Paseo!!!). 
649243,6006517,2013-07-26,866977,Alex,"Kay's place was a fantastic accommodation, it made my visit to Seattle's Fremont neighborhood really great. I stayed there a full week while working in town, a quick walk to the neighborhood's busiest blocks, id highly recommend a stay here if you want to get to know all of the local fare."
649243,6119825,2013-07-30,4094271,Carla,"What incredibly welcoming hosts Kay and her husband are! Not only did I have a fabulous experience staying in her home, but I feel really fortunate to have met Kay. She is warm and openhearted and kind and fun to spend time with. I will definitely stay again when I need a place in Seattle. "
649243,6250054,2013-08-05,3818614,Joe,"This place is amazing. The bathroom is like nothing I've ever seen before and Kay and Dennis are great people.  My bedroom was perfect, plenty of closet and shelf space, and a great bed. I'll definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle. "
649243,6307567,2013-08-07,5722284,Lauren,"Kay and her husband were very welcoming and friendly.  The room was perfect for what I needed. It is small, but clean and inviting and there is plenty of space to spread out your things in the closet and bookshelf.  Kay's description of the room tells you all you need to know (it does get warm/stuffy in warmer temps, as there are no windows, but there is a high powered fan that helps quite a bit and the room is otherwise very comfortable).  The house is beautiful, the location is fantastic, and Kay is a wonderful host!"
649243,6328685,2013-08-08,7485937,Curtis,"Kay was great! Very friendly and accommodating, and had good info for exploring Seattle. Location of the house is excellent. Close to transit and cool places in Fremont. And the house itself is nicely finished with a big luxurious bathroom"
649243,6370460,2013-08-10,7241421,Bettina,"Kay's description of the room and the setting was very accurate and straightforward. Without windows the air in the room can become quite thick, but there is a ventilator installed which we didn't turn on because we couldn't sleep with the sound. We didn't have much time to talk to Kay, but Dennis gave us a quick introduction to the facilities when we arrived. The bathroom is really great -just as displayed in the pictures. And the bus stop around the corner brought us easily into the city. We enjoyed Seattle very much and would like to visit again."
649243,6406100,2013-08-11,2104414,Maxime,"We had a great stay at Kay's place, the room was comfortable and the location was fantastic. Indeed, we particularly enjoyed discovering the Fremont neighbourhood which we would probably not have visited if we hadn't stayed there."
649243,6439801,2013-08-12,7825692,Allen,Kay was very welcoming and provided a fantastic place to stay.  Everything was as advertised and she provided excellent communication to make sure I could get settled in at my convenience.
649243,6537454,2013-08-16,7464716,Lauren,"Good: 
Location- super close to all the wonderful spots in Fremont that make it such a fun place to visit.  Beautiful morning walks for coffee and chocolate tours.
The Hosts: Kay is so warm and welcoming; feeding us, giving us suggestions and urging us to try the deep soaking tub after a long day of hiking.  On our first day in Seattle, she recommended we check out the Ballard farmer's market and the Ballard locks- we did both and really enjoyed our afternoon.  
The bathroom: as other reviewers have said, the shared bathroom - with it's soaking tub and fantastic shower- was a treat.
The not-so-good: 
the room is quite warm, as the posting suggests, however we did not realize there was no window for fresh air.  The room was hot during our August visit (maybe not such an issue in cooler months) and the available fan was noisy."
649243,6595828,2013-08-18,1165064,Julia,We had a great stay at Kay and Dennis's! It was our first time in the Fremont area and they had great recommendations for food and getting around in the neighborhood. Their place is conveniently located and very clean! The keyless entry gives you freedom as a guest to come and go as you please. The bathroom was indeed gorgeous-the bedroom small but comfortable. Highly recommended!!
649243,6616404,2013-08-19,4717829,Carly,Kay was wonderful. Very welcoming and accommodating. The bathroom is a treat and the bed is very comfortable. Great location and a beautiful home. 
649243,6714944,2013-08-22,4365823,Michiko,Kay was a very welcoming host. The picture of the bedroom seems smaller than the real room. It was for my sister from Japan and she was worried about the communications with host but Kay and Dennis's hospitality made her comfortable.
649243,7049771,2013-09-04,772707,Molly (& Roberto),"Kay's home was clean and well maintained. As other reviews have mentioned, the bathroom was quite unique and impressive. We enjoyed casual conversations with Kay and Dennis, who are both very interesting. The room was small but cozy and everything we might have needed was provided. We would definitely stay there again. "
649243,7151202,2013-09-08,8619296,Eric,"Our stay at Kay's place was fabulous. What a great location they're situated in. She & her husband were very welcoming and friendly. they even offered us complimentary cereal and home-made cappuccinos on our last morning.

Thank you for making our first airbnb experience wonderful! I wouldn't hesitate to stay again."
649243,7183464,2013-09-09,3394202,Sung,"We were only staying one night but it was very pleasant, clean, and exactly what is advertised. Kay is very welcoming and her place is very nice. Main plus is that bathroom was luxurious, so it was great to come back to after a long day. Her neighborhood is awesome too. 

It was our first Airbnb experience and now we look forward to some more adventures! Thank you Kay! "
649243,7276444,2013-09-14,6439972,Adam,"My stay at Kay's was perfect. I stayed during a work-related trip, so I was mostly in need of a good bed to sleep on. The bed was comfortable and the bathroom exceeded any expectations I could have had. What a cool shower!

Kay and her husband are both very nice too, and I wish I had more time to share with them."
649243,7496847,2013-09-22,1002786,Jason,"We really enjoyed our stay with Kay in the Fremont area. The neighborhood is very nice with tons of nearby restaurants and small shops. Her home is really beautiful and clean, and as many others have pointed out, the bathroom is pretty amazing. Kay was very welcoming and provided us with some helpful suggestions for places and things to check out during our time in Seattle. We really appreciated her hospitality and flexibilty during our stay. Everything was great!"
649243,7592630,2013-09-25,7312233,Celina,"Kay was a really nice host. The house was clean and the bathroom amazing! The room is as described, it doesn't have a window, but there was a fan we could use, which was okay for one night. I would recommend staying at Kay's."
649243,7636621,2013-09-27,8518760,Carl-Christian,"Kay's home is very tidy and nice. The location to downtown is absolutely fine using public transportation or your own car. The neighbourhood is great and quiet. The room we stayed in was small but just perfect if you are here for a stop-by. One has to know that there is no window in the room, which I had to get used to since I prefer to open the window at night. The luxurious bathroom is the right thing to get started into the day or get some frish energy after a long day out in Seattle. Also Kay is very welcoming, giving advices of what to do in Seattle and taking her time for a chat.  "
649243,7819986,2013-10-04,9060633,Kelly,"Kay and her husband were lovely and welcoming! We had a great stay at their beautiful house, we especially loved the bathroom! The room did become a little hot at night so we used the fan provided. The doors are very sound proof so we enjoyed sleeping in in the mornings still!"
649243,7834345,2013-10-05,7448809,Kirk,"Kay's house was very nice and cozy. I just stayed one night but enjoyed it. Loved the location and I woke up very rested.
"
649243,7921532,2013-10-08,8595884,Marla,Kay was very nice and accommodating!
649243,8036466,2013-10-13,9124299,Eric,"Kay and her kind husband, Dennis, were wonderful hosts. The room, although lacking windows, was more comfortable than we had expected--- perfect for the weary traveler in need of restorative sleep! Don't be fooled by the photo staring at 3 blank walls and a bed--- the room is much more comfy than the photo let on. And the shared bathrrom might as well be a spa! In fact, we were pleasantly surprised to see that Kay operates a legit spa in a fully seperated area on the property. The kitchen is awesome, too. Super nice hosts with a beautiful home in a wonderful neighborhood. We would be happy to come back!"
649243,8075885,2013-10-14,9318321,Eddie,"Kay was a very accommodating host and was very helpful in every way possible.  I highly recommend Kay's B&B; it is clean, the washroom lived up to everyone's review, and I would go back again if I need a place very near Seattle downtown."
649243,8530022,2013-11-04,306695,Jennifer,"Hope to stay again at Kay's and appreciated her generosity, ease of being and thoughtful home.
thanks Kay!

649243,8700722,2013-11-12,965623,Irene,Kay is a great host! And the house is beautiful and comfortable!
649243,9457943,2013-12-29,10834068,Jessica,"Our visit to Seattle was graceful and convenient, thanks to Kay and Dennis' personable approach, lovely home and central location. We loved spending a night in what truly felt like a spa! Thank you!"
649243,9486265,2013-12-30,8494149,Sebnem,We wanted to do a weekend escape in Seattle and contacted a few hours before we got there. She responded so quickly and the place was so nice. They were very welcoming and we were very lucky to have them as our host.
649243,9685159,2014-01-05,10473619,Francisco,"Kay and Dennis were both awesome! We had a great stay at their place. Their friends who visited their house for Friday night, game night were also fantastic! 

Great location too, near so many restaurants, bars, attractions, etc.

Can't wait to go back!"
649243,9869604,2014-01-15,2763716,Sandra,"Kay's hospitality and her home were a wonderful complement to my Seattle adventures. The location can't be beat in quirky Fremont, and Kay's home is both peaceful and beautifully appointed. Kay was kind and generous; her attention to detail goes a long way!"
649243,9922856,2014-01-19,4751469,Alex,"Kay has a beautiful house and was a great host! Clean room, fresh towels/sheets, great part of town - exactly what we needed and she responded to our reservation request within the hour. 

A++ would stay again. Thanks Kay!"
649243,10024026,2014-01-26,4806023,Peter,The Greatest thing about this place is the location. A quick short walk to the Fremont district. Lots of neat restaurants and bars to get lost in all day and night. The 40 and 28 buss ar just 1 block away to take you all over Downtown Seattle. The house is wonderful for in and out staying. The morning expresso by your host is probably the best in Seattle. Beeing Seattle that says a lot!
649243,10223581,2014-02-07,965325,Shamash,"I had such a nice time at Kay's place. Such a kind couple. I enjoyed using the cool shower and bath, had lovely fresh coffee in the morning and loved listening to the Buddhist chanting. Book it! :-) "
649243,10273663,2014-02-10,4001471,Alyson,Kay and Dennis were both lovely. The house is warm and cozy the room was perfect for an overnight stay. Very quiet and a very comfy bed. Great location. I would definitely stay with Kay and Dennis again. Thank you so much! :)
649243,10357777,2014-02-15,2400554,Nick,"Staying with Kay was a real pleasure. She is a kind, considerate and very responsive host that knows how to make her guests feel welcome. Also, her location is superb, putting you within minutes of the best that Fremont has to offer! "
649243,10411314,2014-02-17,10296057,Tanya,"Kay and Dennis were such lovely hosts, Dennis made us the best cup of espresso in the morning! The place is super cosy and has a calm and relaxing vibe to it, and oh oh oh amazing bathroom!"
649243,10471653,2014-02-20,12062170,Viktoria,Kay and her husband are really lovely people. We enjoyed the breakfast in the morning. The bathroom was a special highlight for us. We would always back!
649243,12020192,2014-04-21,13930053,Ha,Kay and her husband were wonderful hosts. Her place was very conveniently located and we had a great time. The hot tub and shower was a super nice bonus and definitely rivals a spa experience.
649243,12272918,2014-04-28,12028574,Katie,"We enjoyed our stay with Kay very much. She and Dennis have a beautiful home, located in a really cool neighborhood! Their Japanese -style soaking tub was incredible and a great way to end the day! Thanks Kay for a fabulous weekend--we will be back!
             ---Katie and Chris"
649243,12736417,2014-05-09,13977150,Georgia,"My cousin and I really enjoyed our stay with Kay and Dennis. Their home is lovely, amazing bathroom! They make you feel very welcome and are more than happy to answer any questions. The bed is very comfortable and the room has a big wardrobe to store away luggage.

The area of Fremont is lovely, with everything you need on the doorstep."
649243,12770593,2014-05-10,14337284,Cecilia,"Very friendly hosts, beautiful home and comfortable stay. The room is a very small windowless space but the amazing bathroom and warm 'make yourself at home' attitude makes up for the lack of light. We didn't get to experience the hot tub but the state-of-the-art shower with multiple shower heads, including one in the ceiling, was terrific! "
649243,12993660,2014-05-16,11923034,Markus,"I stayed only one night, but this night was very good and refreshing. Everybody I meet was very friendly and helpful :)"
649243,13098695,2014-05-19,6717614,Lynn,"Kay has a lovely home that was opened up to me. The bed was comfortable, and the bathroom quite spectacular! Her location is also in a very hip district with easy transit access to anywhere. I really enjoyed my stay."
649243,13293776,2014-05-24,15102504,Eric,"Kay was really great. Great place, although rolling up my luggage on the hill up to her house was a task. Walking distance to everything I was looking for... And of course, the bathroom!"
649243,13430688,2014-05-27,2497476,Laura,"My friend and I had a great experience in Kay's house. Her and her husband were very friendly and kind. As described in the profile, they were a short walk to Fremont Ave. Just to let people know, the room was soundproof as we had no idea Kay was chanting in the living room unless we opened the door so if you think you might wake up or be distracted from the chanting, you actually can't hear anything when the door is closed. My friend and I both both slept very deeply in Kay's room. I would highly recommend other people to stay here while in Seattle."
649243,13594041,2014-05-31,14951516,SaraEllen,"Great location with kind hosts. Plus, a good night's sleep in a windowless room is a rare treat in this part of the city, and is very healthy. (Sleeping with too much light is not optimal for one'a health.)"
649243,13695544,2014-06-02,7427990,Bailey,"We really enjoyed our stay with Kay and Dennis. The room was comfortable and cozy, and the bathroom rivaled a spa experience. The location is fantastic, and their yard gorgeous. We just met Dennis on our short stay, and he was very hospitable and kind. We highly recommend this place! "
649243,13899053,2014-06-07,14100034,Bryan,Kay and Dennis were great hosts! They provided breakfast and the best hospitality. The accommodations were excellent.
649243,13975242,2014-06-09,15580609,Alan,"Had a great experience with Kay and her husband. The room was great, exactly like advertised. Loved the neighborhood.  Will definately stay there again next time in Seattle."
649243,14135530,2014-06-12,16354380,Kevin,"Kay and Dennis were great!  They were very welcoming, and had a calm presence.  They provided water and candy in our room, and that little gesture said so much to me.  They were very thoughtful.  We had a great time.  The neighborhood is also really beautiful.  I would highly recommend staying here.  "
649243,14242064,2014-06-15,15830601,Will,We enjoyed our stay with Jay very much. Nothing but a positive experience. She is such a nice person and full of life.  We will definitely stay here when in Seattle. 
649243,14292022,2014-06-16,4232219,Jane,We enjoyed our stay with Kay.  Kay was a lovely and friendly hostess.  Her guest room was quite nice - very clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood was nice and there was ample street parking nearby.  
649243,14420276,2014-06-18,16831769,Jill,"We had a nice stay with Kay and Dennis. The room was quiet and comfortable and, though the bath was shared, it was never a problem and my husband loved the ofuro, the soaking tub. Our first experience with airbnb and we will definitely use it again. Thanks, Kay!"
649243,14542235,2014-06-21,16916526,Lauren,"Wow! What a great innagural Airbnb experience. Kay and Dennis were open and kind hosts.  As seasoned Airbnb travelers they were certainly attuned to what makes a great stay for a weary traveller: cleanliness, a great bed, privacy, flexibility. They respected my schedule and understood  my need for a little solitude at the end of my crazy busy days. 
I would have loved to have visited more with them, but as this was my first Airbnb experience I also wanted to respect their privacy.

This room is windowless, and provided a nice little cocoon for me. What you cannot see in the picture is they have added a great fan which provided the perfect amount of air flow. 
If you are someone who needs a window, this room is probably not for you.

I found waking to Kay's morning ritual of chanting a lovely way to start the day. She does it on the next floor up, so although the sound reaches the room, it is not loud or offense but somehow soothing. Much better than awaking to one's alarm clock. This nice little touch helps make Kay's house a home. Which I appreciate.

I am a seasoned traveller who is sensitive to noise. Therefore it is my responsibility to bring ear plugs in case I need them. I did have to use them a couple of times while music, tv was played for a little while in the evening. I do feel this noise was a natural part of their every day and nothing out of the ordinary. 



Bathroom is shared but I never once ran into anyone. The bathroom is fantastic with soaking tub and fabulous shower. "
649243,14687237,2014-06-24,14513932,Peggy,We had a great experience! The room was clean and the bathroom was to die for. Homemade granola cereal with blueberries one morning! This was our first time booking through AirBnB and it was perfect. Kay was a wonderful hostess with recommendations and answering all our questions. My only teeny tiny complaint is the house is uphill - but then in Seattle - Everything is uphill - so not really a complaint. We loved it. Thank you!!
649243,14796683,2014-06-26,5194183,Younghoo,"I stay there 2days night, I really suprise
About there bathroom. Bathroom is just hotel! You don't be disapoint."
649243,15136183,2014-07-03,5338311,Amber,"The house was beautiful, and clean, and hosts friendly and accommodating. The room, even though windowless provided comfort and privacy needed. I highly recommend the Freemont area when staying in Seattle. Travel all over Seattle is easy through public transportation from the lodging. I highly appreciate Kay allowing us to arrive early for some much needed sleep after traveling. "
649243,15452982,2014-07-09,11611618,Yookyung,"Kay and Dennis were wonderful people.  I was lucky to have Dennis' KILLING espresso.  I was also lucky to get a chance to get a soaking in the amazing bathtub.  I felt Fremont spirit from Kay and Dennis' home.  Since the room is windowless I would recomened only for short stay, the bed was very comforable though.  Thanks for your wonderful hospitality!  And hope you have a nice trip to Istanbul!  "
649243,15562955,2014-07-11,6467317,Mike,"Beautiful, clean and amazing place! Downtown is easily accessible by public transport. Thanks for your great hospitality!!"
649243,15976044,2014-07-19,13110300,Amanda,"Nice house placed in a quiet area. Many nice restaurants are located in a five minute walk. The room is a bit small  and it has no windows, as it is announced in the advert. With the door closed you don't hear anything or have any light in the room, which enables you to have a good sleep! We had a very nice stay :)
"
649243,16063271,2014-07-21,2166045,Mariya,"The place was exactly as in the pictures. The house is gorgeous and very well taken care of, super clean and neat. The room is small and it's a bit sad without windows, but it does well for a few nights stays. It has a closet and hosts were very considerate to leave some water and glasses, as well as some chocolates. The bathroom is spectacular, the kitchen is full of all the possible utensils and ingredients for a delicious breakfast. We got a vip treatment when our host made us delicious coffee in the morning - amazing!

The neighborhood is very nice and quiet. It's walking distance from a few bus stops, Fremont downtown and a great grocery store. "
649243,16366022,2014-07-26,8809534,Donald,"Kay has a beautiful home. Incredibly welcoming and in a neighborhood that has access to all manner of shops and restaurants. It was a wonderful stay and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for some quiet time away, or the occasional business traveler like myself that wants easy access to the city and a departure from the traditional hotel experience. "
649243,16670905,2014-07-31,14766407,Joanna,"My boyfriend and I stayed at Kay's beautiful house for 4 nights. The room is just as it looks in the pictures, except with the addition of a fantastic ceiling fan that feels great to sleep under during the summer. I had the best showers that I've ever had in my life at this place, and one of the most amazing espresso's ever as well. Kay and Dennis were welcoming, friendly, and full of great information. Our schedule was very jam-packed and we were gone almost all day every day, but our interactions with Kay and Dennis were always very warm and inviting. They made us a wonderful breakfast one morning and we had some great conversation. The neighborhood is very easy to access from downtown via public transport, and is home to one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten in my life, Paseo! We got in some great exercise climbing the hills of the neighborhood, but that is not a complaint at all, as we needed it! All in all it was a great experience and I am very grateful to have been introduced and welcomed to Seattle by Kay and Dennis!"
649243,16851304,2014-08-03,271925,Lauren,"Kay is a very kind, sharing person.  When she learned that I was going to the University of Washington, she provided me a bike, a lock, and a helmet.  I didn't end up needing any of it, but I was so happy for the offer.  The room is comfortable, and although it could potentially feel a little stuffy, the overhead fan (with a couple of speeds) keeps it very comfortable.  The bathroom is large and includes a toilet (in it's own ""closet""), a soaking tub, a regular tub, a shower, and a sink.  Very nice.  Everything is clean, clean, clean.  

Kay chants every morning, but it did not bother me at all.  With the bedroom door shut, you can't really hear it.  Plus, it is interesting and soothing.  

Kay owns a spa next door.  I took advantage and hired her for a massage.  She is amazing.  Highly recommended!  

Lighthouse Roasters, a 12-15 minute walk away, is a great place for coffee and a muffin.  As well, I made the hour walk to Wallingford to join a friend for dinner.  VERY safe.  I walked back after 10 and never felt intimidated.  

All in all, this is a wonderful place to stay!"
649243,17308481,2014-08-10,18995129,Gregory,Kay is a lovely host and her house is beautiful.
649243,17443317,2014-08-12,16644352,Tiffany,"The house is really nice and clean, and just as the previous reviews have pointed out, the bathroom is amazing. Kay and Dennis are really friendly and helpful. The only downside is probably the fact that there is no ventilation in the room. That said, however, the room is by no means any less comfortable since there is a ceiling fan that makes up for it. I also like the location of the place -- a nice neighborhood and really close to bus stations that go downtown. Overall, I really enjoy my stay at Kay's place and recommend staying there if you decide to visit Seattle!"
649243,17715859,2014-08-16,19397613,Dominique,Kay and Dennis where so kind and accommodating. There place was very nice and the location was perfect for seeing the sights. There was no window in the bed room but with the fan on it was fine. They suggested sites to see and places to eat. they made our first airbnb experience a great one.
649243,18418499,2014-08-26,18278630,Julie,"Staying with Kay and Dennis was a great experience!  The place was clean and warm, while the hosts were friendly and accommodating, even allowing me to store my luggage until my late night flight.  I would recommend this room to anyone traveling through Seattle looking for no-fuss lodging.  I would definitely stay here if I travel back west!"
649243,18739386,2014-08-31,8262631,Kelsey,"Kay's home was so lovely and perfect for our stay! It is super convenient to explore the great neighborhood of Fremont (and get to other areas in downtown Seattle). The room is cozy, but exactly what we needed after a long day exploring the city. Kay was very warm and accommodating, and her home is beautiful! I'd definitely recommend this listing! "
649243,19160519,2014-09-07,9128013,David,"Kay was a great host who made me feel welcomed right away. The house is beautiful and located in Fremont, just over the bridge and north of downtown. There is a strip of great restaurants to the northwest and southeast of their house, so it is a good home base for exploring this part of Seattle. The room was a little weird for me at first because there are no windows, making it pitch black when the lights are out, but the overhead fan and Kay's hospitality more than make up for it."
649243,20621539,2014-10-02,20640343,Natalie,"Kay and Denis are amazing hosts. They made my stay a great experience from start to end. The house is very comfortable, and the room for guests is actually bigger than it looks in the picture. Kitchen/fridge/appliances all readily available. Bathroom with shower/bath/little jet tub was always available as well, whenever I needed it. The neighborhood is gorgeous, with interesting landscaping and lovely houses, great for a stroll or a jog. Plenty of parking in the street. Will be happy to stay there again, highly recommend to others."
649243,20750555,2014-10-05,16512976,Ana,"Kay was a wonderful host; she was very friendly and gave us some tips on places to go.
The room was very clean and perfect for our needs.
Also, I fell in love with the neighborhood. Fremont has the right amount of kookiness for my taste and is a short bus ride away from downtown and other activities. "
649243,21297139,2014-10-14,18039185,Alvin (Mohammad),"Kay is a wonderful host. We arrived early and she was kind enough to let us in earlier than the check in time. The neighborhood is artsy and amazing, locals call the center of the known universe. I highly recommend Kay's place to travelers (1-2 pax) planning to visit Seattle."
649243,21496091,2014-10-18,12393648,Brian,"Kay and Dennis have a beautiful home in Fremont. There was a bus stop about three minutes away from their house where I could catch a bus for a 15-20 minute ride into downtown. Kay was very prompt in responding to my booking and questions and made the whole process of getting to her place very easy. If you're looking for a very nice, quiet home that is close to the bars and restaurants in Fremont and not far from everything else Seattle has to offer, this place is an excellent choice."
649243,22617847,2014-11-10,8009098,Brenda,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kay & Denis's house. They are a lovely couple that were trying to help me since the very first moment I got into their house. The house, room's  description, and neighborhood description  were very accurate. The house was very well located (one block from the bus stop and 10-15 minutes from downtown by bus). The house is very clean (room, kitchen, bathroom). The neighborhood has a lot of options as far as food, bars, internet cafes, plus an important point ""the bus service"". Kay and Denis were very friendly, they gave me suggestions on places to visit ( I was a single lady) and offered me breakfast. They made me feel I was part of their family. I highly recommend Kay's house to other visitors."
649243,24441799,2014-12-28,24378104,Isabelle,"Kay and Denis are soooooooo wonderful hosts. It was a great experience to us. We spent a great Christmas with them. The room is bigger than we expected. They have all sorts of cooking utensils. The spa is amazing, especially after a day hike, when you turned totally wet and cold in rainy Seattle . They are very friendly and are willing to answer all of our questions  about Seattle. They had a lot of interesting experiences in life and it's nice to get to know them. We'll definitely choose their place again the next time we visit Seattle."
649243,24869321,2015-01-03,899574,Yee Hing,"All good.  I honestly didn't spend much time there at all, but while I was there, I had nothing to complain about.  Clean and cozy and the hosts were really nice.  What more could you ask for?  Really nice shower."
649243,25623349,2015-01-20,26226499,Pam,"Our start was a bit bumpy with a delayed arrival due to a storm however my hosts both were very understanding, gracious and accommodating.  In the morning I was greated with a yummy breakfast, fabulous coffee and stimulating conversation.  It was a joy to experience both of them and their beautiful home.  I would return there
"
649243,26398475,2015-02-11,2070317,Emily,"Kay's place was lovely and welcoming. The room was perfect for our needs, simple and clean. Keyless entry was very nice and made for a lot of ease in coming and going.

Appreciated the smaller touches: water carafe, luggage holder and the robes. Kay was always helpful and friendly whenever we crossed paths. 

Their bathroom is the nicest I've used! Lovely facilities and timing was easy to work out for the house. 

Great location and lots of lovely Fremont business/sights in walking distance! Street parking was easy every time too.

Not at all a surprise, but I forgot that since there were no windows, I never knew what time it was in the morning, so we slept in a few times. :) The walls are a bit thin, so I'd recommend earplugs, but otherwise my brother and I had a lovely time staying at Kay's!"
649243,27820377,2015-03-12,10157853,Corrigan,A beautiful home! Kay was very welcoming and helpful in our exploration of Fremont. The place was as-described and recommended.
649243,28059000,2015-03-16,21614358,Yirong,It's a great experience living here!
649243,28473748,2015-03-24,10642357,Nathan,Such a lovely home in a beautiful and convenient neighborhood.  Kay and Dennis were delightful hosts and very accommodating of our rather irregular schedule.  I have to say the soaking tub and rain shower are definite perks.  Would happily stay here again!
649243,28619225,2015-03-27,1971733,Caroline,"We totally enjoyed staying at Kay and Dennis' house.  We're Airbnb hosts too and had rented out our house and needed a place to stay nearby.  Their house and location were perfect: in Fremont, with a nice bed to sleep in and an awesome bathroom to use.  Kay and Dennis are very generous and warm people and it's nice to know they're neighbors!  We had a great time.  "
649243,29019799,2015-04-02,30013119,Adam,"We really enjoyed our time with Kay in Fremont, we felt very welcome in their beautiful home. The room was quite small as you can see in the pictures but it was perfect for us, it can get a little warm but the ceiling fan kept us cool. Dark and quiet for some deep sleep! The bathroom was amazing, soak tub and a great shower. The location is perfect for Fremont, only a short walk to all the awesome bars and shops. This is our first time using air bnb and we loved it."
649243,29149012,2015-04-04,29280102,Amit,"It was such a pleasure to stay at Kay's place. They are a adorable wonderful couple and their house is just super clean, fitted with state of the art amenities. Kay is just always there to help with anything. Extremely warm and comfortable stay. "
649243,29367203,2015-04-06,2675187,Doug,Kay was extremely welcoming and helpful. Everything was easy and their home was great. They also gave me some great recommendations on places in the area. The location could not have been better. Thanks again for everything!
649243,29992953,2015-04-15,24211958,Yew,"We really enjoy the days in Seattle, and Kay did a great job. They are nice and jovial, and always willing to help. The room is not big but it has everything we need. The location is quiet and beautiful, love it so much!"
649243,30468462,2015-04-22,6883500,Zach,"Kay and Dennis have a lovely home and they were super friendly and welcoming. This was my first visit to the Pacific NW and the room was the perfect size for what I needed. Kay was happy to offer up recommendations and accommodating to my needs. She was even happy to oblige me in tinkering around a bit on her piano. 
Provided the room is the right size for your needs, I fully recommend a stay with Kay and Dennis."
649243,31140000,2015-05-02,8185579,Chris,"ay was a great hostess. She made me feel incredibly welcome and gave detailed instructions about how to get into the house when she was not there. Additionally, she was really flexible, as some of my plans fell through and I needed to add on an additional two days to the front of my stay. Kay is very friendly and gave awesome restaurant suggestions as well as hiking recommendations nearby. Her listing is very accurate, as the room was clean and had enough space, and I had access to the downstairs bathroom, which was great. I would highly recommend staying with Kay. "

She even gave me some interesting reading material, too!  The house is beautiful and very clean.  You can tell that she takes very good care of the place.  Overall, a relaxing place to stay in a great location with lovely people!"
649243,33101693,2015-05-25,1971733,Caroline,We've stayed twice now with Kay and Dennis and they're both a pleasure to see and catch up with!  They are very easy going and so so generous in attitude and otherwise!  It's a delight to stay with them!  
649243,34027599,2015-06-03,33951455,Debra,Great hosts--very accommodating.  The house is beautiful and easy access to bus lines.  The room is small but big closet and a bathroom to die for.
649243,34127469,2015-06-05,22406872,Sid,"Kay and her husband were very friendly and welcoming hosts. He even offered rain clothes when I mentioned I  needed to buy some. The room doesn't  have any windows  as the pictures show, but it was great for a deep sleep. The bathroom is  also spectacular. We'd  stay again."
649243,34778854,2015-06-12,20628770,Joaleen,"Kay was a lovely host and her home is beautiful. The room is nice and dark to catch up on sleep. Unfortunately my trip was cut short, but Kay was very accommodating and even offered to mail home a ring I left behind."
649243,35952532,2015-06-23,34646543,Holly,Our stay with Kay was wonderful! They were so welcoming and helpful. The room was just as described. Kay was even nice enough to lend a hat to me while we took in the Solstice parade! We highly recommend them!
649243,37398315,2015-07-06,9869043,Macarena,"Kay and Dennis were amazing hosts! They were both very welcoming, the house is truly beautiful, and has a great location (and very close access to public transportation). The room/bathroom/kitchen are true to the pictures posted. Thank you Kay! "
649243,37650883,2015-07-09,26131723,Amanda,"Kay and Dennis were wonderful hosts.  We spent most of our time out around the city but when we were at the home Dennis or Kay were kind, helpful, and accommodating.  "
649243,37840483,2015-07-11,11336391,Jessica,"It's a tough call on if the bathroom or the location wins as my favorite thing about Kay's place.  The location is a short walk to everything in Fremont, which is such a great neighborhood - we could have spent our whole trip exploring just this area. Fremont Brewery was our favorite to grab a drink at. It's also a short bus ride to lots of other great neighborhoods. 

The bathroom shower was amazing - I am a sucker for rainfall shower heads. 

The room is definitely small but is really comfortable and cozy. Kay and Dennis made us feel really welcome and gave us some great recommendations. We'd definitely stay here again if we're in the area! "
649243,38297654,2015-07-14,21551891,Abigail,"Kay and Dennis’ place was in a perfect location for us. Fermont is very cool and actually more interesting than the centre of Seattle in many respects…and much less crowded! So easy to get into town if you want though - bus stop just mins down the hill. We even took the bus to the Link Light rail to take us straight to the airport, it was so easy and saved us heaps on a taxi. The room is as billed: small, dark and warm – can get a bit stuffy in there but the ceiling fan dissipates that. The huge wardrobe was great for storing all our luggage too. The bathroom is large and also windowless with a lovely modern shower. Overall, pleasant interaction with them both and we felt at ease in their home.   "
649243,38646073,2015-07-17,13170696,Yooseong,"The entire stay was very pleasant. The location is good, and parking is convenient. The room is a bit small, but if you need more than that, you're not on vacation. :) The large in-wall closet was a nice touch to the small room. Everything is clean and comfortable. The bathroom is wonderful. I really enjoyed the rainfall shower. The chanting sound in the morning is faint and won't bother your morning sleep. "
649243,39058148,2015-07-20,6723225,Raf,Thanks a bunch Kay!!!
649243,40251969,2015-07-29,30599257,Jason,This was my first AirBnB experience and Kay made it incredible. Very friendly and accommodating. The bed and bathroom were great and she is located in an area pretty close to most everything. I would highly recommend staying with Kay if you plan on visiting Seattle. 
649243,40841927,2015-08-02,36463994,Amanda,"Room was exactly as described; very nice, beautiful house with an incredible bathroom. Room gets a little stuffy at night but the ceiling fan helps a ton!"
649243,41932884,2015-08-10,30415590,Grayson,"Thank you so much Kay! It was my first time to Seattle, and first time embarking on a trip of such a grand scale alone. I have to say, Kay and Dennis made me feel as if I was just walking into my own house. The level of comfortableness is incredible, and I'm so happy I was able to spend a week in this lovely house. (Break a leg with your production, Dennis!)"
649243,42452429,2015-08-13,18822866,Sherry,Kay is really nice and the room is sweet.
649243,42809078,2015-08-15,41216602,Jennifer,The host canceled this reservation 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
649243,42931681,2015-08-16,21219471,Jing,"Kay is such a kind person, and her home is so comfortable feeling like home. She has exquisite taste of home deco and other things. It added so many nice experience for our Seattle trip. "
649243,43514121,2015-08-20,16688017,Andrew,"Before staying with Kay, I'd never seen the ""Superhost"" badge on Airbnb before. I see now that Kay completely deserves the title. The place was very clean and allowed full access to the kitchen and its supplies. Kay was very hospitable and gave us great advice on places to visit. Would definitely recommend!"
649243,44009979,2015-08-23,8991834,Szymon,"Our stay was pleasant. The code access to the home made getting in and out convenient. The basement room is as described - small, dark and can get a bit stuffy at night as mentioned by other reviewers; recommended for one person. There are no windows in the room, but the ceiling fan helps some. The bathroom is shared, however it's adjacent to the room and access was not an issue. There was ample street parking which we utilized. Wifi was strong upstairs but weak in the room. The location is in a great neighborhood, close to many bars, restaurants and breweries. Getting downtown is quick; about a 10-min Uber ride. Recommend checking out Fremont Brewery!"
649243,48430599,2015-09-26,43270271,Monique,"This was my first time using AirBnB and I'm happy to say that my experience with Kay as our host in Seattle was amazing. When we arrived at her house, the room was clean and well kept. She even provided some chocolates and a welcome note on the night we arrived. She provided some great recommendations for sights in Seattle, including the Chihuly Glass Museum, which ended up being my favorite spot in the whole the city. All in all, she's a very sweet host  with a beautiful home. "
265901,904858,2012-02-06,653295,Nicole,"Keith and Cherie's place is exactly as the pictures have portrayed it to be. I knew I was going to have a great experience when Keith messaged me to check in it if was okay to book the other room and provided a link to the interested guest, I was only booking the private room and not the floor so this was something he did on his own because he is such a nice guy. I ended up getting the whole floor to myself which was nice. Keith was easy to reach and communicate, whether it was via the messaging system on the site or via his cellphone. Everything I needed was in the room. I was pleasantly surprised by the two terry cloth robes hanging in the bedroom, there was an extra toothbrush in the top drawer in case a guest forgets one. Keith and Cherie thought of everything. There was pots and seasonings available in the kitchen, and if anything wasn't there Keith was only a call a way and he was sure to send someone with it. Even asked if I needed him to grab something when he went to the store. For those days and nights that you do not want to head out there are drinks for purchase from the refrigerator. Keith also runs a party bus and car service so if you need a ride from the airport he is available. Overall I would advise someone coming to Seattle to check out Keith and Cherie's place you are getting more bang for your buck. "
265901,948730,2012-02-26,1626314,Paola,"Keith was a great host. Very helpful and friendly. Room was as pictured, private and clean. Kitchen has everything you need and also has laundry. Its close to public transportation if you dont mind the walk up and down the hill. Safe neighborhood and quiet nights. About 20 mins to downtown Seatlle. Great airbnb experience."
265901,1014843,2012-03-18,1847002,Dee,"The room is clean, quiet and comfy. The house is separated by upper level and lower level. Guest rooms are all in the lower level, so you have your own space. Keith is a really nice guy. He offered to pick me up at the airport. I needed a hair dryer and he bought me one the next day. I assume most people drive here but if you don't have a car, bus stop and light rail are just about 8-10min walk. I recommend this place!"
265901,1032428,2012-03-22,1863575,Ji Young,"Thanks to Keith and Cherie, I could stay at cozy and nice place. They are very friendly and kind, offering a ride to the airport even at 5 am early in the morning. 
Guests are using separated units with Keith and Cherie, but we can still contact them anytime and they responded to whatever we needed.
