One disclaimer, though: I was asked to arrive by 8:30, so people booking should check beforehand whether their schedule is compatible with Tessa's (I kind of wish I had)."
2263643,33618666,2015-05-30,2613332,Rachel,"Tessa's place was great and she was a great, relaxed host, and welcomed us with a comfortable and clean home. The location is good too -- a quick bus ride away from downtown, but quiet and right next to discovery park. "
2263643,33746240,2015-05-31,713762,Heather,"Tessa is a great host. She was very welcoming, accommodating and communicative. The room is exactly as described and the area is quiet, beautiful (near a park) and quite easy to get downtown if you have a car. I don't know if it's challenging with out a car, but for people renting a car it's the perfect location! I enjoyed my time at Tessa's place and the conversations we had. Nice to meet a New Zealander :)  Thanks again!

2263643,33887129,2015-06-01,34547723,Ashley,"Tessa is a great host and wonderful person! Very welcoming and helpful. The room was cozy and clean, and upon my arrival I was greeted with a cup of tea. The bus ride is only 20 minutes to downtown and the place is right next to a beautiful park. Tessa was quick to respond and easy to communicate with. I really enjoyed my stopover in Seattle and highly recommend staying at Tessa's. "
2263643,34086649,2015-06-04,12172888,Aileen,"Staying with Tessa was absolutely wonderful, it's like home away from home. She is incredibly kind and welcoming. I enjoyed our talks, especially about books and Game of Thrones … it was a lot of fun. The room/appartment is exactly as described. The area is nice and quiet and downtown is easy to reach by bus. If I ever come back to Seattle I would book with Tessa again. Thanks for everything.
"
2263643,34743492,2015-06-11,11135024,Vanessa,Tessa was a lovely host and gave a lot of great tips of what to do in the area. Discovery Park was even more gorgeous than I imagined and the bus system near her home was convenient and easy to figure out for an out-of-towner.
2263643,34992207,2015-06-14,33493378,Debby,Tessa was a gracious welcoming hostess. There was plenty of street parking and it was very convenient to Magnolia and Ballard. I would love to stay with her again. 
2263643,35339052,2015-06-17,28883377,Ken,Tessa is a great host and the room was very comfortable. She had the room ready along with a cup of tea. I also enjoyed talking with her when we where both there.  Magnolia is a beautiful area and close to Seattle. I had no problems parking on the street and I left my car there during the day so I could use the bus to get into town.  
2263643,35502185,2015-06-19,2690979,Mrinmay,"Tessa was an amazing host and the place was lovely.

Neighborhood: Very safe and has easy bus connectivity to Downtown. Has a great convenience store about 5-6 minutes walk away.

Apartment: Very cozy and comfortable, and features some interesting pieces of furniture/souvenirs. 

About the host: Very responsive on text and email. Very warm and welcoming. Very accommodating with check in and check out times. We had a great time chatting about food, celebrity chefs and Game of Thrones!

Tips: Have clear dialogue on checkin and check out times with Tessa so that it's smooth for you and her both. Be prepared to take a cab back to her place if it's too late at night (this applies not just for her neighborhood but many places in Seattle in general)."
2263643,35756888,2015-06-21,35595339,Cathy,"I felt welcomed immediately by the host, Tessa. It had been a long day for me so i went to bed early and was on my way early after a very good nights sleep. Thank you, Cathy"
2263643,36463426,2015-06-28,2040596,Jenni,"Tessa was a wonderful host. The location was perfect - quiet, quaint and literally right next to the park. Tessa let us use the kitchen and was very gracious about opening up her home to us. If you are planning a trip to Seattle I recommend this place !!"
2263643,36716625,2015-06-30,8096716,Dane,10/10.  Tessa was great.  Location perfect.  Room clean and comfortable.  Exactly as advertised.
2263643,37010480,2015-07-03,5914991,Pascal,"Thanks very much Tessa for having me :-) You were very welcoming and provided me with a spacious & clean room, I loved the location being within walking distance to the lovely Ballard district (which has lots of great pubs & concert venues) and with the convenient bus stop right in front of your house that'd bring me downtown and back anytime."
2263643,37893554,2015-07-11,16687440,Yoonjung,"It was very good to stay at Tessa's place. Safe and peaceful area! The public bus stop is right in front of her place and it only takes 25-30mins to Downtown. quite convenient. 
Tessa was very welcoming and kind host. Wish I can stay again. "
2263643,38301386,2015-07-14,3431977,Clarissa,"This is a really good location if you're taking public transit but don't want to pay the higher prices closer to downtown. There's a bus stop in front of the apartment with a direct bus that will drop you off three blocks from Pike Place Market downtown. You can also easily walk to Discovery Park or the Chittenden Locks from the apartment. 

I was a bit disappointed with the apartment itself. It was not clear from the description that there is only one bedroom in the apartment, for the guest, and Tessa sleeps in the living room. The kitchen is open to the living room, so if you get up early to make breakfast, you may have to worry about waking her up. The breakfast is included in the price, but it was kind of a strange combination — duck eggs, oatmeal, plums, and apricots. It would have been nice to have something simple like bread or cereal that didn't require cooking. 

The apartment was not very clean. I don't expect perfection at an Airbnb, but there was gunk on the bathroom and kitchen fixtures and it was clear they hadn't been cleaned in a while. On the positive side, the bed was comfortable, it was very quiet at night, and there was plenty of room to unpack."
2263643,38644789,2015-07-17,16443210,Aleks,"Tessa was great. Very friendly, totally hospitable, and the room was just what I needed. She's located in a very nice area, and had plenty of information provided for me. An excellent experience."
2263643,38790397,2015-07-18,37768825,Heidi,"Tessa is a gem!! Very hospitable and welcoming, she offered me a cup of tea as soon as I arrived and we had a nice chat. Thank you for helping me find my way and providing a place to keep my bag during the day while I explored Seattle!"
2263643,39209340,2015-07-21,37180060,Emily,"Tessa was great :)
I felt welcome, she was very helpful with directions and a few activity ideas, and she seemed genuinely excited about the opportunity air bnb gave her to meet people. Her neighborhood is a little far from DT but the bus is literally right outside her apartment plus magnolia is a beautiful neighborhood and you can walk around discovery park. Room was clean, her balcony garden was lovely - I would stay again in a heartbeat."
2263643,39453098,2015-07-23,36067895,T,Tessa is incredibly sweet! Had a wonderful stay with her. 
2263643,42017993,2015-08-10,39092482,John,"Tessa was a great host with a fantastic personality.  After a day of exploring the city, she'd offer me a cup of tea and ask about my day.  The bedroom was very clean and she even included some information about the area.  Her home is located new Discovery Park with offers some pretty amazing sunsets. "
2263643,42351047,2015-08-12,40741983,Deborah,"Tessa was a great host. Very welcoming and generous and happy to provide information about things for tourists to do and how best to get around. Check in was very smooth.  Room was exactly as listing described. It was private, comfortable and safe. Great neighbourhood, with a fantastic park nearby."
2263643,42723212,2015-08-15,6485259,George,"Wonderful stay with Tessa! She was a fantastic host. The room was clean, spacious, and cozy. Tessa was very accommodating, prompt to reply to communication, and so gracious. Thanks!!!"
2263643,43238850,2015-08-18,35903531,Anirban,"Tessa is a wonderful person. She gave me clear info on how I can reach her pace and how I could check in even when she was not there. 
The neighborhood is really quiet, just the way I like it. Tessa really likes conversing with people and making them feel welcome with everything. The room is exactly as mentioned, lots of space, and a really comfy bed, the perfect place to have a great sleep after the whole day's activities. 
Don't expect a hotel room. It is a personal apartment and is as good as a personal space can be and I really felt at home. Tessa even let me keep my bag there after checking out so I could take it later.
Altogether, it was a wonderful experience at Tessa's."
2263643,44659658,2015-08-28,23300796,Sarah,"I had a great time here.  Tessa was very forthcoming with useful information on places to go, buses and such.  
The room was just like the picture, it had a nice comfy bed and the area was very quiet.
There was a bus stop just around 200m away, with direct buses into downtown area, all quite easy to do."
2263643,45541569,2015-09-03,43033612,Frazier,Tessa was very accomadating and great at communicating with me. She was such a pleasant person to be around. I'm very glad I could meet her.
2263643,47882504,2015-09-21,43630215,Basheer,"Tessa treated me with kindness and respect. She is a wonderful person, and I found it very easy to get along with her. I especially enjoyed our conversations while we drank coffee on her lovely veranda.
The location is beautiful in a very calm neighborhood. There is a lot of nature to admire, and the nearby Discovery Park was fantastic. The park is huge with basketball and tennis courts if you're into that. The bus stop right outside the building was also a good way to visit downtown Seattle.
I would recommend visiting Tessa's to my friends should they visit Seattle one day. I genuinely felt sad that I had to leave."
2263643,48148777,2015-09-23,42795006,Miles,"Tessa is a very kind and welcoming host, she's very interesting to talk with, and I met nice other airbnb traveler there. The location is nice for seeing Seattle, and the park one block away is fantastic! great trails, open fields, views of the sound and Mt. Ranier...
the bed's a little on the firm side, but not too bad. Thanks Tessa!"
2263643,48625091,2015-09-27,6246109,Steve & Anne,Tessa was a charming and caring host. As a great fan of the Discovery Park the location was ideal and very convenient.
2263643,48755492,2015-09-28,10567978,Nina,The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2263643,49167305,2015-10-01,16916526,Lauren,"Tessa is a lovely hostess. She is an excellent communicator and flexible.  I highly recommend Tessa's flat for those interested in exploring Magnolia, Queen Anne and Ballard or those who need a quite place to sleep after a busy day downtown working or site seeing.  "
2263643,50104151,2015-10-09,43543634,Ellen,"The listing description was accurate. We were tow female guests and Tessa made us feel welcome right away: she came out of the bldg to guide a way and even help us with our luggage. We were met with fresh flowers from her balcony garden, bottles of water and candy. The neighborhood is a vast Discovery park, a treat for any biker or a hiker. Within just 35 min of walk there is the most western tip of the Seattle shoreline - West Point beach with a lighthouse. Two buses 2-3 times per hour run straight to downtown, just 25 min. It has been a restful and enjoyable stay for us after 10 day road trip. Thank you, Tessa!"
2263643,50375015,2015-10-11,8664028,Rob,Good value & great location for me as it was really only a 5-15 minute drive from anywhere I wanted to go. Bus stop right outside too. Discovery Park (literally right outside the front door) is beautiful and the Locks which are a picturesque 5 minute walk away are definitely worth checking out. Tessa is a warm and welcoming person who made me feel right at home. The bed was a tiny bit short for me but I am 6 foot 4...!  Would stay again!
2263643,50821267,2015-10-14,6265581,Paul,I had a really nice time at Tessa's place. The room is very pleasent and cosy. Located in a nice neighborhood easy to access and very close to the beautiful discovery park. Tessa was a wonderful host very nice considerate and thoughtful  she instantly made me feel at ease.  
2263643,50999663,2015-10-16,6791976,Marius,"Tessa is a wonderful host, I felt welcomed and more at home than ever at her place!"
2263643,54025203,2015-11-15,9236414,Mark,Tessa is a wonderful host. Staying at her BnB was a wonderful experience. It has a warm and positive energy about it with great attention to artistic detail.  The location next to Discovery park is excellent and there is a grocery store a block away and many restaurants south or north 8-10 blks. Its also close to the Ballard locks and waterway with a nice paved path.
2263643,56062863,2015-12-08,9962484,Sherin,Tess was wonderful! 
2263643,56226284,2015-12-10,50613206,Josh,"Tessa has a nice home, in a very convenient location for checking out discovery park or fisherman's terminal. I enjoyed my time there."
2263643,56617896,2015-12-15,36246661,Joshua,I greatly enjoyed my stay at Tessa's.  She was very hospitable and made me feel welcome immediately.

5299060,28155455,2015-03-18,25956292,Em,"Dan was a wonderful host! He was very kind and welcoming, and has the cutest dog! This place was amazing, Dan is a much better host than photographer, the pictures don't do it justice! Will be back again for sure."
5299060,28287890,2015-03-21,19981436,Justin,"This was the perfect place to stay! Dan is a very nice guy that made me feel right at home. He honors your space and privacy. The ""In City- Suite Retreat"" had everything I could possibly want as far as size and amenities, comfort, and accessible free parking. Everything felt new and clean inside. He does compost and recycle which is great. Its quiet spacious and well thought-out. If you need a place in west Seattle or just near the city this is your best bet to make it a stay worth while."
5299060,28820507,2015-03-30,10912391,Elizabeth,"These photos don't do the ""Suite Retreat"" justice-- it's clean, well-equipped for an extended stay, and cuter than it seems in the photos. The neighborhood is convenient to downtown Seattle by public transport; Dan and his partner were helpful and communicative.  Next time I'm in Seattle, I'll come back! "
5299060,29113430,2015-04-04,10363937,Lydie,"Very nice, clean and comfortable place. Dan was available even with our late arrival, he is very prompt with messages and I appreciated it. This place is very well located and this is a big advantage. The proximity of the bus station (litterally few steps) that brings you in less than 30 minutes in downtown is very very convenient.
Definetely, we'll come back to Dan's place."
5299060,29436239,2015-04-07,24389619,Ishwinder Singh,Dan was perfect host and very accommodating. Dan was very prompt with replying to my text messages and phone calls. Made our stay very welcoming and comfortable. The property was very clean and had all the facilities that we needed. Location is 10 minutes bus ride to downtown. I will definitely recommend this place and will definitely come back and stay at Dans place.
5299060,29689266,2015-04-11,17088965,Chris,Staying at Dan's was great. Worked perfectly for our short stay in Seattle. Very clean and quiet with everything we needed. 
5299060,29838478,2015-04-13,4413334,Eddy,"Dan's place was very clean, tidy, quiet, and had a very comfortable bed. We didn't use the kitchen but it had everything we would have needed to make a quick meal. The bathroom was also clean and had some spare toiletries in case we forgot anything. Dan was a great and responsive host who has clearly put a lot of thought and consideration into the renovation and furnishing of the suite. The location is a bit hard to find but otherwise it exceed my expectations. I would definitely stay here again!"
5299060,30059753,2015-04-16,30278505,Sarah,dan was a great and accommodating host! his place is super cute and is in even better than the pictures! very clean and quiet. everything you need! I had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend it.

5299060,30155895,2015-04-18,15533967,Natalie,"We loved our experience at Dan's place! He was super helpful with getting us situated. The space was perfect for 2 people! Dan also gave us great recommendations around west Seattle, one of which was this place called Bakery Nouveau which ended up being one of our favorite places in Seattle! "
5299060,30415936,2015-04-21,3147224,Ky,The suite was a beautiful place and located in very cool neighborhood right by the Downtown area of Seattle. We were able to access everything we needed to with no issues and Dan was able to give us great direction on how to get where we needed to go. This was a great Airbnb experience.
5299060,30536721,2015-04-23,8616434,Katie,"The rental was perfect. It was clean, stocked with necessities, and comfortable. The unit is in a good area close to restaurants and with easy access across the bridge to downtown Seattle. Dan was a fantastic host. He went above and beyond the duties of an Air BnB host when he jump started our car after our battery died! We would definitely stay here again."
5299060,30639781,2015-04-25,1405118,Dave & Silke,"Dan's In-City Suite Retreat was perfect for our quick overnight trip to Seattle.  Comfortable (especially the bed!), very clean, easy access to downtown - just as described!  Dan was a terrific host.  He greeted us on arrival, gave us the quick tour of the apartment, and gave us some good tips - especially about Bakery Nouveau for breakfast the next day - thanks for making it all so easy!"
5299060,30729240,2015-04-26,2609280,Marty,"Dan's place was terrific for me: quiet, cozy, clean, and.....perfect. Dan was not only a gracious host, but also a good sport. I lost the key and was able to help me despite the late hour. I'm very grateful to his generous nature. I hope to return on my next trip to Seattle."
5299060,30949903,2015-04-29,7984415,Anne,Dan was wonderful!!  Thank you for everything!
5299060,31377872,2015-05-04,3800578,Bohyun,Dan's place was really modern and clean. It is located on a ground level with a nice little garden in front. The parking on the street was abundant and easily accessible from the place. Dan has a set up that is very convenient and comfortable. I absolutely enjoyed the stay. 
5299060,31686550,2015-05-08,30833551,Amanda,Dan was a wonderful host and accommodated my one day notice reservation. The space was comfortable and it was so nice to be able to do laundry while traveling. I'd definitely recommend this space!

5299060,33853654,2015-06-01,33792693,Meredith,Dan has a wonderful place and communicated well with my wife and I when we had questions. The apartment was clean and well stocked with lots of directions about how to do things. The neighborhood was great with a nice park near by. There was a bus right next to the apartment that took us downtown Seattle and back. 
5299060,34065038,2015-06-04,31376357,Catherine,"The In-City Suite Retreat was adorable, spotless and very well equipped. It had everything I needed for my stay and more. It was very comfortable, quiet and cozy. It had plenty of space and particularly enjoyed the size of the kitchen.  I got a great welcome from the host and the instructions were perfectly clear. In the early mornings, I took a long walk  through the neighborhood streets and was surprised at the number of wooded green belts, gardens and singing birds just off the 'main street'.  Definitely a good spot to stay if you are a runner. I thought the In-City Suite Retreat was excellent value and I would stay there again. Thanks to the host for such a comfortable stay! PS. The yard in the first photo is now filled in with plants and is lovely. The creeping thyme was in bloom while I was there."
5299060,34159300,2015-06-05,34061919,Steven,"Dan was unable to meet me in person, but provided specific instructions on getting into the place.  The stay itself was great.  Everything worked like it needed to and it was nice and quiet, which is exactly what I needed."
5299060,34263125,2015-06-06,30745826,Michelle,Dan was a fantastic host. Very accommodating by accepting my booking one day before arrival. You have the cutest townhome/cottage to yourself with fully equipped kitchen. The place is super clean and perfect for a couple to explore Seattle like a local. Be sure to enjoy a water taxi off seacrest park into downtown Seattle (pier 50). Great views and inexpensive way to see the city. The pictures of this place do not do it justice. Dan was very organized and called me before arrival to help with directions to his place. Excellent service. Highly recommended. 
5299060,34630164,2015-06-10,17719988,Laura,"Dan's suite retreat was exactly what we were looking for. Cute and well equipped with lots of privacy, I would definitely stay there again. The location was so convenient we saved gas and parking money and were able to take the bus everyday. West Seattle is a treat :)"
5299060,34733133,2015-06-11,22208109,Selena,"The apartment was perfect.  We got in very late and Dan was so accommodating. A sustainability home, which is awesome. He's such a great host. Even took the time out to suggest a bakery for breakfast. Definitely stay here."

5299060,35092856,2015-06-15,6826997,Geoff,"I very much enjoyed my time at Dan's place. He was an extraordinarily responsive and kind host. The apartment is lovely: cozy, clean, and fully-equipped for cooking, lazing, and preparing to explore Seattle. The neighborhood is residential and quiet. There's a coffee shop a block away and easy access (driving or public transportation) to the city center.  Highly recommended!"
5299060,35302178,2015-06-17,31682147,Michael,"Dan was very welcoming and met us to show us around.  The place was extremely well located and comfortable.  All the amenities of home.
Great recommendation for Bakery Nouveau the food was amazing"

5299060,35794511,2015-06-22,6353037,Tegan,This was an excellent place to stay! Dan was very welcoming and nice! The place itself was nice and clean and very comfortable. I would definitely stay there again!

5299060,36102179,2015-06-25,32512730,Julia,"Dan´s kleine Wohnung in Seattle war sehr schön! Eine bessere Unterkunft hätte man nicht finden können. Es war alles da was man benötigt hat und es war sehr sauber! Dan war sehr nett und ein toller Gastgeber. Schade dass wir nicht mehr Zeit hatten, haben aber dennoch  einen super Eindruck von  Seattle bekommen und würden bei unserem nächsten Aufenthalt gerne wieder bei Dan unterkommen! Vielen Dank und viele Grüße, Julia"
5299060,36283774,2015-06-27,9249824,Chris And Hoss,"We had a wonderful stay at Dan's apartment during our stay in Seattle. While we didn't actually get a chance to meet him, he made sure we were able to check-in easily via lockbox. The printed info sheets were great as well. We didn't get a chance to use the kitchen at all with all the great restaurants in Seattle, but it's definitely a bonus to have. While it is a basement apartment, we found it to be surprisingly quiet. We had a rental car to get around Seattle and would recommend it to others. Traffic wasn't really and issue and Dan's apartment was a good base for us to explore the city with the rental."
5299060,36681512,2015-06-30,32444485,Srishti,"Dan was very flexible with our timings and a great host, he also provided great recommnedations for our first time visit to Seattle. Bakery Nouveau was one of the excellent suggestions! The place is clean, cozy and convenient. Highly recommended! :) "
5299060,37158831,2015-07-05,30670884,Brian,Great place to stay in Seattle. Easy to get around on public transit. House was clean and everything was even better than advertised.
5299060,37491387,2015-07-07,6930896,Terri,"We were there only a short time and did not use the recently remodelled, and adequately stocked kitchen (perfect if you like to cook).  The space is small, but very clean and functional with a nice garden that was in bloom for our visit.  The location is an easy drive to downtown (ample street parking).  

All communication with Dan was prompt and direct.  Recommend, especially for a longer stay to take advantage of the kitchen."
5299060,37851197,2015-07-11,30194391,Carly,Dan's place was a great getaway from the busy downtown area. It's off the beaten path but the bus is very reliable and the stop is right outside the door. It was a clean and quiet place to relax and unwind from a busy day. He was very helpful and replied to messages extremely fast and was around if we needed him. When we arrived he was there to greet us and provided us with a long list of things to see and places to eat. Overall it was a great experience and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Thanks Dan!
5299060,38492034,2015-07-16,27668133,Daniel,"Dan, our host, made us feel very welcome upon our arrival. He personally greeted us as we began to make ourselves at home and welcomed us to the city. Not only did we feel that we could have a private time during our vacation but he also made it known that he was open to any interaction and helping us with whatever we needed to improve our stay. He provides a well stocked and well furnished home that gives you all the necessities needed for a successful extended stay. The neighborhood itself had a very nice feel to it and was only one bus ride away from getting to downtown and near Pike's Place Market. Nearby were a few excellent cafes which we enjoyed. I would definitely refer my friends to this stay and would stay again myself."
5299060,39005285,2015-07-20,13361757,Alex,"Dan was a very welcoming host and was super informative about the area; he had many great tips about what was close by the apartment.  The place was very clean and looked exactly like the pictures show. I would definitely come back and stay here - my boyfriend and I loved the place! I would recommend to anyone looking for an apartment to stay in Seattle.  Great location, and only about a 10-15 minute drive to downtown.  Parking was free and easy to find on the street. "
5299060,39266218,2015-07-22,27595776,Krystal,My husband and I stayed here for our stay in Seattle. Dan was welcoming and allowed us our privacy but he was easily reachable for any questions. The suite was comfortable and very clean. It also had most basic necessities in the kitchen and bathroom. Quite and cozy.
5299060,39428914,2015-07-23,37814128,Grace,Me and my friend Chanel had a great experience staying at Dan's place for one night. The place is very clean and had everything you needed including laundry. There's a super cute backyard outside with benches and sometimes you can find bunnies visiting the garden. The location and parking was very convenient and we had our own private separate entrance. Dan was very nice and gave us great suggestions on where to go during our stay. I would highly recommend the place to anyone that's looking for a clean and comfortable place to spend the stay. 
5299060,39588028,2015-07-24,78059,Hillary,"Dan's place was great! Everything we needed, and more! Dan was great about getting back to us quickly about everything. It was very close to downtown and Dan gave us some great recommendations for food. Will definitely try to stay there again!"

5299060,40234090,2015-07-29,36459717,Hunter,"Dan's suite retreat was beyond what I was expecting. My boyfriend and I absolutely enjoyed the space. It was spacious, clean, and private. Dan was quick to respond to any questions I had. This was my first time using Airbnb and he was always helpful with answering any questions I had. My boyfriend and I felt so comfortable in the suite. The suite was equipped with anything you could ever need. Helpful instructions were provided on every appliance. 

The location was absolutely perfect. It was just a short drive to downtown. Even if you won't be visiting downtown, the surrounding area has great shops and restaurants. Also, Alki beach is just a short drive and such a great sight to see.

The suite retreat was fantastic! We hope to stay at the suite retreat every time we visit Seattle! "
5299060,40441580,2015-07-31,6512832,Serena,"We had a great stay at Dan's place. He provided very clear directions and was friendly and responsive to our inquiries.  During our stay, the neighborhood was quiet and peaceful. Conveniently, the location is walking distance to a cute coffee shop -which is a bonus for us- and a relaxing park. We definitely recommend Dan's place for future visitors!"
5299060,40936883,2015-08-03,5858394,Luisa,"My friend and I stayed at Dan's place for three days.
We haven't met Dan personally, but everything was very well organised, he replied very promptly to every message and was very helpful.
His place was just perfect for us, very well kept, clean, and with a lovely garden. It is in a quiet area with very frequent bus connections to downtown. I would definitely recommend staying at the in-city suite retreat.
"
5299060,41934643,2015-08-10,32367698,Tim,"Place was clean, Dan was friendly, was close to the bus routes.  Great experience."
5299060,42381491,2015-08-13,25900849,Robin,Dan was great! Great communication before and during our trip. The space was exactly what we needed and in a good location. I would definitely recommend it.
5299060,42928297,2015-08-16,20955858,Grant,"Dan's place was great! He was a very friendly host and his communication with us was excellent.  The suite was well kept, clean, and comfortable. The neighborhood is a quite area with frequent bus connections within a block of the estate. We definitely recommend this listing for visitors.    "
5299060,43368523,2015-08-19,18121800,Kristin,We enjoyed our stay very much! Comfortable and tidy. Close to pretty much everything we wanted to see in Seattle. 
5299060,48375793,2015-09-26,18121408,Patricia,"My first airbnb experience at Dan's In-City Suite retreat was perfect. I stayed for 5 weeks and never had a problem. Dan offered to make a two hour drive when I thought I had misplaced my key. Fortunately this was not necessary.
The rental is very clean and comfortable, with all the necessities.
Close to all the bus lines and a nice park.
Definitely would give a superior recommendation."
5299060,48885224,2015-09-29,9605550,Julie-Anne,Dan is a helpful and cooperative host. We changed our dates and Dan was quick to accommodate this. The suite is exactly as described and had everything we could wish for even a washing machine and dryer. The neighbourhood felt safe and car was parked on the street. A car is useful in this area and getting to the city centre was easy to get to by parking at Alki Beach and taking the water taxi. No expensive parking fees!! The suite is behind other townhouses and is very quiet. A great place to stay !
5299060,49933919,2015-10-07,45008187,Trevor,"Dan's aptly named In-City Suite Retreat is a lovely, cozy, quiet escape from the city. It is very clean, all technology and other amenities are new and work well, and it even has a charmingly landscaped private outdoor space that reflects the same thoughtfulness as the interior. There were clear instructions for how to use everything, which made settling in simple and efficient. We were very comfortable there and found it a great, private place to rest. At the same time, it is convenient to downtown and has very easy parking. We met Dan as we were leaving; he was super nice, friendly, and professional (as expected given our e-mail interactions and the thoughtfulness of his unit), and we really enjoyed talking with him. Overall, it is a far superior experience to a hotel, and we would highly recommend this listing - and Dan as a host - to anyone."
5299060,50729388,2015-10-13,43007304,Kasi,"Dan's place was awesome!  It was better than we expected and was a perfect retreat in Seattle..  Super close to everything we wanted to do, without the city congestion.  Great value, easily accessible, street parking, couldn't ask for anything more!"
5299060,51452974,2015-10-20,5106332,Aswin,Staying at Dans place was a wonderful experience. The place itself was everything it is advertised to be and more. It is in a quiet neighbourhood and is very clean and thoughtfully stocked with everything a guest might need. It is located conveniently close to bus lines which made trips to downtown super easy.  Dan is a super friendly and accommodating host and I would recommend this listing without any hesitation.
5299060,53930143,2015-11-14,47405776,Sean,Great in-city retreat!  Very private and comfortable accomodations.  Dan was very welcoming and eager to assist in anyway.
5299060,55556399,2015-12-02,34392938,Jerry,"We communicated with Dan numerous times leading up to our trip, as well as upon our arrival. He advised us to make sure everything worked and to call him with any questions.We felt very comfortable contacting him. This property is very lovely and just as described in the listing. It was immaculate and provided everything we could have needed."
2736961,11729114,2014-04-13,14005150,Dawna,"Meredith's garden studio was just what I needed after a long international flight.  The space is incredibly quiet and the bed delightfully comfortable so I got a great night's sleep!  This is a fantastic home-away-from-home.  It has a relaxed atmosphere and is in a peaceful, charming and safe neighborhood and Meredith seemed to genuinely care about my experience. I would recommend staying at this location without reservation.  When I return to Seattle I know I will stay here again!"
2736961,12230267,2014-04-26,14074358,Sarah,Meredith's studio is a perfect place to stay for a couple (or single person) traveling the northwest. We really enjoyed our stay and appreciated the freedom to come and go as we pleased while still having the ability to reach Meredith at any time. She is a lovely host and I would recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle if you have a car so that you can drive into downtown (which was very easy and parking was not a problem)
2736961,12355445,2014-04-29,12478709,Cat,"Meredith was super accomodating. The studio is beautiful, spacious and located at a very lovely part of town. International dist was only 15 min away and downtown was also 15. 

Her studio is fully equipped with games that will keep you entertain. 

Will definitely revisit. "
2736961,12857013,2014-05-12,8409865,Bernard,"Studio tout à fait confortable parfaitement situé en fonction de mes critères.
Tout à fait calme et avec l'essentiel de ce qui est nécessaire, même s'il n'y avait pas de frigo à mon arrivée.
Mais Meredith a rapidement pris en charge ce problème et l'a résolu de manière tout à fait satisfaisante."
2736961,12992575,2014-05-16,854724,Percy,"Meredith was great.  She was easy to communicate with and very timely.  The studio is nicely furnished, clean, and an easy walk to coffee shops and the park.  I travel a lot to the area, and will certainly try to stay here again.  A great find."
2736961,13322979,2014-05-25,4846535,Steve,"We treated our daughter and son-in-law to a night away, and found Meredith's place near Columbia City, south of Seattle. Here's what our daughter had to say about the experience: ""Meredith was super responsive, within minutes by text. The place was just as advertised -- super quiet, access to Netflix, comfortable bed. Loved how it was decorated. There were nice little added touches (rolled towels in bathroom, water in fridge, etc.). Great location, cute neighborhood."""
2736961,13436865,2014-05-27,1273832,Charmaine,"Loved the place!! Super clean, comfy bed, great location for me. Meredith was super accommodating & easy to reach. 
Private entrance & parking right outside the suite. It was a lovely stay! Thx Meredith!"
2736961,14395615,2014-06-18,8962739,Melanie,"Loved this studio!  It was even bigger than I imagined, with a cute walk-in area separating the front door from the apartment.  The room was beautifully decorated and made me feel right at home.  Meredith was wonderful; she checked in periodically to see if I needed anything and was always easily reachable.  There is a mini-fridge, toaster oven, and microwave, making it super convenient to buy a few groceries and eat from home.  I was able to park my rental car literally steps from the studio's door.  Downtown was an easy 20-25 min drive.  On a side note, I'm a musician and this place had great acoustics for practicing ;)  I think it's cool that so many well-known artists have recorded in this studio in the past.  "
2736961,14577200,2014-06-22,6920598,Krista,"We stayed in Meredith's Garden Suite for one night. What a fantastic host she was! The space was impeccable. Lots of thoughtful touches like coffee, tea and popcorn were provided. The neighbourhood was calm and quiet yet well-connected to public transport and major routes.

I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Meredith's Garden Suite to anyone looking for a peaceful stay in Seattle."
2736961,14791720,2014-06-26,16351282,Yvonne,"We greatly enjoyed our time in Meredith's studio. It was very clean, comfortable, and well stocked. My two girls and I loved the location! It is a quiet and cute neighborhood. We walked to Seward Park where we hiked, strolled, and played. We took Uber to downtown. I needed some supplies and walked to the market and coffee. I felt safe and comfortable with my girls. We will definitely be back!"
2736961,15493199,2014-07-10,15567968,Simon,"Prior to arriving at the Garden Studio in Seattle we traveled in Oregon & stayed at the Residence Inn in the Pearl District in downtown  Portland and other places. 

We can say from first hand experience that the Garden Studio offers excellent value by comparison.

Meredith provided excellent instructions to access the garden studio as I arrived when she was working. My spouse came on a late flight from Florida arriving at Sea-Tac airport at 9.30 p.m. 

When we checked in everything was functioning perfectly, the property was clean  and the studio was exactly as described on the airbnb web site. The studio is also very quiet. Meredith provides lots of little extras for her temporary residents which you won’t get in a motel or hotel & we felt very secure being in Columbia City.
We parked our rental car right for free outside the door of the garden studio for the week we stayed. In Portland overnight parking at the Residence Inn cost an extra $32 per night. 

Because the weather was so great during our visit we went to the Mount Rainier National Park twice, we drove around the Olympic peninsula and also ventured as far north as the Canadian border. The studio is an excellent base for either sightseeing in the city or venturing further afield to see the spectacular wonders of Washington state.

We bought groceries twice at the nearby PCC (Puget Sound Community Co-op) & saved by using the kitchen facilities provided at the garden studio."
2736961,15695658,2014-07-14,15944981,Brittany,Great place to stay! Super clean and very cute. We had a great time in Seattle.

Had Netflix, boardgames, some kitchen appliances and popcorn. Meredith was easy to communicate with and texted ahead of my stay to provide any needed detail. City (pikes market, etc)  is a 20-25 min drive. Parking was easy as well. Would recommend. "
2736961,16551787,2014-07-29,15650590,Carolina & Patrick,It was cool to stay in a previous recording studio. It was easy to get to downtown Seattle - although it takes you 40 minutes by bus. The studio is located in a very quiet neighborhood.
2736961,16789897,2014-08-02,1499027,James,"The studio was clean, comfortable and in a great location! The host was extremely responsive and helpful. I travel to Seattle a week a month for business and this is the 3rd different studio I have stayed at in the area...I would reserve this studio again for sure. Really close to Tin Umbrella Coffee, PCC Natural Food grocery, Lake Washington / Seward Park and Columbia City. "
2736961,16984498,2014-08-05,16444581,Benjamin,"Pleasant arrival, and cute studio.  Host was very welcoming.  Would definitely book again.  Even offered to send my wife's phone charger back to us.  Thanks Meredith!"

Meredith was responsive to any questions I had along the way The studio was about a 20 minute drive from the airport and easy to get to. There was plenty of parking and Meredith also gave some nice suggestions of places to check out around the neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again and would recommend the space to others. "
2736961,17825374,2014-08-18,4725285,Shrie,"Meredith's little apartment was cozy and comfortable. The neighborhood was quiet, close to transportation and downtown, and just a great little hood to explore. We loved coming back to visit our old neighborhood in Seattle!"
2736961,18133687,2014-08-22,2134089,Shirl,"Great place, would definitely stay at again for a future trip.  Clean, cozy, and convenient.  The host also gave us great recommendations for our drive up to Canada - thanks!"

Meredith was a great host! She left suggestions about coffee shops, bars, and restaurants to check out in the Columbia City neighborhood; a lot of them are within walking distance. She was also very responsive via text. 

I definitely recommend booking with her when you visit Seattle!

"
2736961,21480229,2014-10-18,21874941,Rochelle,"The accommodations were exactly as pictured and described by the host...even better!
The neighborhood was perfect...it was quiet and only a couple of minutes from where I was working 
I returned late at night and felt very safe
I enjoyed reading about all the musicians who spent time there before it became a place to rent out.
The host spent time on all the important details to make the a place i would for sure return to.
The bed was very comfortable and it was nice to have a TV there as well.
When I first walked in I felt this place was well taken care of.
It was also really nice to have parking right in front!"
2736961,23329524,2014-11-29,2584616,La,Such a lovely stay!  My parents enjoyed their time in this studio very much.  They were so comfortable there that they opted to sleep in and enjoy a peaceful morning there one morning instead of joining the rest of our family for breakfast!  
2736961,23786884,2014-12-10,22756071,Julie,"Super cute studio! It had the ammenities I was looking for. I used to live in Seattle so it was close to a couple of friends that I got to catch up with during my visit. Very clean, nicely decorated an Meredith and Puja were the perfect hosts. "
2736961,25286412,2015-01-11,5053141,Ellis,"We stayed over a weekend.  We both found the bed quite 
comfortable and everything was neat and very clean,
including the bathroom.  The studio is spacious and has
its own entrance.  Due to the timing of our arrival and
departure, we didn't meet with our host, but communications
were straightforward.  We would definitely stay there

Very private as well. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood, just a few blocks from the charming downtown Columbia City (lots of  good food choices here).

Overall, a great trip to Seattle!"
2736961,31598514,2015-05-07,15614756,Angelica,"Meredith's space was Amazing!  Pictures are true to the space, loved that parking is right outside of the unit.  The small touches, providing water, oatmeal, and other snacks helped me get through some grueling writing sessions.  Great location and Meredith provided a list of restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance (breakfast at Geraldine's is everything!)  I didn't get the opportunity to meet Meredith, but she was very responsive to all my email inquires and provided very easy instructions for check-in and out.  Would defiantly go back!"

2736961,33597224,2015-05-30,32157815,Devin,"The studio was just as fantastic in person as it looks on the site! Quaint and secluded, you do not feel like you are staying on someone else's property. Location is great, only a 10-15 minute drive from dowtown! Meredith was a fantastic host! Super helpful and accomadating! Will totally be back!"
2736961,34642363,2015-06-10,8962739,Melanie,"This is my second time staying here, and once again, I loved it!!  It has everything you need - fridge, microwave, toaster oven, kettle, and even a drawer full of snacks.  Lovely decor, very safe (I'm a single 30s girl), and private.  You do need a car, in my opinion - but it's worth it.  Be sure to drive over to Seward Park right down the street.  It's so beautiful and serene, especially on a rare sunny day!"
2736961,35486378,2015-06-19,34082141,Britney,This spot was such a great find! It was quiet and cozy and a great location. Meredith created a welcoming space providing info about the neighborhood and recommendations of fun things to do. We would love to stay there again when we go back to visit Seattle! 
2736961,35773669,2015-06-22,28876267,Amy,"This was our first experience using Airbnb and it was great!  Meredith was very professional and made everything very easy.  The place was pretty much exactly as it looked in the pictures - maybe a bit bigger than it appears.  It was very clean and super comfortable.   Meredith even provides a few snacks and cable TV and Netflix. 

The location was awesome!   We were in town for an event and were able to easily walk to our friend's house.   Despite our limited time, we took advantage of a couple of the nearby restaurants and had a brief walk/run in Seward Park.  We could also drive everywhere we needed to go in about 15 minutes. We also appreciated the parking spot in front of the house.  We would absolutely stay here again!   Thank you Meredith for the use of this awesome space!
"
2736961,36989347,2015-07-03,35760268,Steve,"Columbia City was awesome. It reminded us of our home town without the attitude. The actual room was clean and spacious, all as advertised. 

Meredith was super accommodating, her suggestions for eateries, sight-seeing, etc. all spot on.  She remained accessible and responsive throughout our stay; very comforting. The neighborhood and area were better than expected and we felt very fortunate to have kind of fallen into this property. On-site parking, public transportation, ease of getting to major roads and highways... all a breeze.

The little garden space at the unit was really comforting and pleasant.

My only critique (sorry Meredith!) would be opening windows and/or some kind of A/C in the unit.  I understand it was record highs while we were there, so I understand it's not typically an issue but with day time temps in the mid 90's, we'd have liked to be able to leave some windows open at night to bring in the lovely cool air.  Having said all that, it's still plenty comfortable and I would return. If I get back out that way, this is one of the places I'll look for first."
2736961,37306094,2015-07-06,31814915,Cathy,"Meredith was not home while we were there, but we email several times and she was clearly thinking about us and our comfort.  She left contact information and answered promptly.   She also left information about the area and restaurants, coffee shops, etc.   We definitely have the same taste!  The room is separate from the house, extremely quiet and very tastefully decorated and furnished.  Towels and munchies as well as board games were available for our use.  
Seattle was having unusually hot weather and Meredith was kind enough to provide a fan (I think it is unusual for Seattle homes to have air conditioning because their weather is generally not so very hot.  
We did wish we could open a window or that the door had a screen for more air, but like I said, this was unusually hot weather.
Our only real regret was not getting to meet Meredith in person--she is obviously a friendly and conscientious renter--perhaps next time!

2736961,37867918,2015-07-11,34780698,Ruth Ellen,"Great little studio - interesting space as it was formerly a recording studio. Great location, well appointed, Wifi worked well, very convenient parking, and wonderful neighborhood. I was made to feel very welcome, and Meredith was very responsive."
2736961,38133550,2015-07-13,13386209,David,"Lovely and peaceful stay at Meredith's, as we begin our journey from Seattle to LA. The studio is clean, well-lighted, and hip. Rich and colorful accent walls, a fridge, and piles of books and games make this an ideal place for a short stay. The neighborhood is cool, funky, and fun to walk. The PCC market is stocked with heathly food and a local cafe provides a homey touch. When in the city again, I wouldn't hesitate to reside at Meredith's studio."
2736961,38501373,2015-07-16,34118766,Heidi,"Our stay at the Columbia Garden Studio was a truly lovely experience! Located in a friendly, peaceful neighbourhood we felt relaxed and at ease whilst still close enough to the heart of Seattle. The public transport was easy to reach from the location of the apartment and the locals were more than happy to help us when we were feeling a bit lost!
The studio itself is beautifully finished and was comfortable for our stay. The amenities allowed us to prepare and enjoy the majority of our meals there, allowing us to spare some money on food and splash out a bit more on attractions! 
Meredith was a fantastic host who was more than happy to answer any queries we had. She also ensured that the studio was stocked up with some snacks and a bottle of cold water which was massively appreciated after such a long flight!
Thanks so much for such a lovely time, if we're ever back in Seattle again I'm sure you'll be hearing from us!"
2736961,41746997,2015-08-09,7026400,Sam & Dora,"The studio is very nice with a lot of amenities. Having a mini frig was a nice touch. It is clean and comfortable. One thing that other reviewers mentioned is that we went on an unusually warm weekend, so the room for a bit warm and stuffy. But, there are several fans that we used. We cracked open the doors a bit to let the cooler night air stream through the studio at night. We also used the fan at night to keep the stuff moving. That turned out fine. Overall a good quiet neighborhood that is not too far from anywhere else in Seattle. I would recommend it. The host was very quick to respond to any questions we have."
2736961,42554482,2015-08-14,37872468,Amy,"The Garden Studio is a fantastic little place to stay. It is close to the airport and was perfect for us to stay at after an evening arrival into Seattle, before heading north.  Meredith was extremely flexible about our arrival and the whole thing was very easy.  
The studio itself was perfectly clean and comfortable. There were plenty of towels and coffee for the morning. It is situated in a lovely garden, on a very cute neighborhood.  There is a great coffee place just a few blocks away, easily walkable."
2736961,43226138,2015-08-18,19864689,Felicia,"The studio was definitely a great choice. We were visiting friends and they were only a short drive away and though we were in and out a lot parking was great. There were no privacy issues and the space was beautiful, very well decorated. It's very spacious and relaxing we truly enjoyed our stay. Meredith was a great host even though we didn't get to meet, she leaves the studio set and ready to go with all you need. If our travel brings us back to Seattle we will most definitely want to stay here again."
2736961,44639411,2015-08-28,25376374,Joshua,"Two adults had a wonderful time staying here. The studio is clean and comfortable, the neighborhood is very fun, and Meredith was extremely gracious. We recommend this home to anyone who wants to stay in south Seattle."
2736961,45770051,2015-09-06,8814473,Cindy,"We have nothing but great things to say about this studio. It was just two of us (for a whole week), but there is plenty of room - it is very spacious and private. So many amenities, such as books (novels and travel guides), games, toiletry items, hair dryer, food and drinks, extra linens... We loved the neighborhood. Columbia City is quiet and not too far from the airport and not too far from all the main sights of Seattle. We spent most of the week checking out other areas before we realized that our own neighborhood had a lot to offer too. We found lots of great shops nearby, including a fantastic grocery, PCC, that has all kinds of ""health foods"" (and prepared foods) where we picked up some fruits and milk. The photos for this listing are completely accurate, but the studio seemed even larger in person. We never met Meredith in person, but she was very quick to respond with answers to any of our (numerous!) questions."
2736961,46600022,2015-09-12,38875774,Bill,"Meredith was a good host and always willing to answer our questions.  Her studio was nice, quiet and clean.  It had everything we needed as well as a few extras like snacks and coffee. It was in a quiet neighborhood close to some neighborhood restaurants which we went to for breakfast and dinner.  They were lovely.  It was also not far from Seattle and other places we wanted to see.  Thank you again for your hospitality and we would recommend your place to anyone coming to Seattle.  "
2736961,48179159,2015-09-24,10136187,Xandria,"My mother and I had a great stay at Meredith's place. The space was clean, stocked with essentials (plus some), and the neighborhood was quiet. We felt comfortable and had plenty of privacy. Definitely recommend this cute little studio!"
2736961,57106250,2015-12-21,42860353,Bryon,"Great location, loved the layout. Responsive to msgs and very helpful. Would recommend to friends. "
2736961,57409296,2015-12-25,42860353,Bryon,2nd time staying at this location. Another Great experience again. 
7038750,40021697,2015-07-27,18297142,Laurenthia,"Becky and Len were great hosts. They were super friendly, nice, and accommodating. They were flexible with our check in/out times which was super helpful for us. The house was comfortable and clean. I would be happy to stay with them again. "
7038750,41440143,2015-08-07,10173263,Stanislav,"We contacted Becky and Len as we arrived and let ourselves in as they were out. After playing with their two beautiful kittens, we unpacked. Becky and Len were amazingly friendly and accommodating. They had many recommendations for local restaurants and made us feel at home. The basement was very spacious and warm. Would stay again 100%! "
7038750,42205614,2015-08-11,21632317,Katharina,"We arrived very late at Becky's place, which was not a problem at all. We even got breakfast offered and both, Becky and Len offered us to use the entire house. We felt very welcome at their place. Both were great Hosts and  are awesome people to meet. Would always recommend to stay with them when visiting Seattle. "
9303530,55585099,2015-12-02,19924538,Jesse,"Ren & his wife were gracious and helpful before, during, and after the process.

The location was ideal as it was a reasonable walk to UW Medical Center even with a 4 year old kid... and the walk there across beautiful UW campus was unexpected and fantastic.  The unit is clean and the area felt safe staying with a family.

Advise to all Airbnb renters - communicate with your host.  We had a couple of minor issues that Ren would've resolved immediately had we made him aware. 

We recommend working with Ren if you are looking to stay near UW at a reasonable price."

6426462,39495590,2015-07-24,33315783,Silvia,I enjoy staying in this apartment. Overall the apartment is clean. The owner is very helpful and provide our needs. Hope to stay again next time
6586979,35036691,2015-06-14,33592393,Alan,"Staying at Andy's place was a wonderful experience. Any and Lynn have a beautiful townhome that has brand new everything! Whatever we needed in this three bedroom home was available. This was a Five Star experience. Quiet, friendly neighborhood, that is just minutes from downtown. So the best of both worlds. Two thumbs up!!!"
6586979,35335764,2015-06-17,33066533,Xiaoyang,"Andy and his wife are so nice. The house is great, and the neighborhood is very convenient. Our two families enjoyed the house very much."
6586979,36069240,2015-06-24,25622218,Edward,"Andy and Lynne were exceptional hosts. They have a beautiful spacious home very close to public transport with easy access to the city. The highlight was their guide for their guests, an exceptionally comprehensive listing of activities to see and do in Seattle and surrounds which provided us with a wonderful foundation for a great experience in their lovely city. It is obvious that they are very passionate about their city and take great pride in ensuring their guests are well prepared for a wonderful stay in their home and in Seattle. We highly recommend their property to future guests."
6586979,36237422,2015-06-26,34701916,Wesley,"Andy was an excellent host, always staying in constant communication with me before and during my trip. He was always very attentive to any needs we had.

The house itself is in great condition and was very clean and nicely prepared for our stay. It's in an excellent location and is walking distance to a bunch of great restaurants. 

Thanks Andy for a wonderful experience."
6586979,36563900,2015-06-29,33168930,Josh,"This was our very first experience with airbnb and it turned out to be a great one! We were a larger group and finding a place was near impossible to accommodate all of us and still be close to downtown. Andy's house at everything we needed, enough beds, space and only a quick drive to get to everything we needed downtown.  
He was a great host to us as soon as we arrived,  had a bottle of wine and a great guide to the city waiting for us on the table. The kitchen was stocked with everything we would have needed if we were cooking dinner.
Our first morning there a few of us ran into Andy and he was able to recommend s great spot for brunch and he even went as far to make us a reservation there for us! He was also very accommodating when one of the guests was looking for Tylenol, he gave us some of his from his place as soon as we asked. If all hosts and experiences are as great as this one we will definitely be using airbnb more!  Thanks Andy for a great first impression! "
6586979,39020230,2015-07-20,11557241,Andrew,"Andy's communication before and throughout the stay were by far the best of any AirBnB host I've stayed with. Even from out of town he was  helpful and responsive.

The house itself was beautiful and well situated for all of our needs. Would definitely book again should the need arise."
6586979,39543400,2015-07-24,26162260,Edward,"Great location, really convenient for us to get around. The house is very clean with everything we need in there. Thanks Andy! "
6586979,40104390,2015-07-28,16648434,Youlei,This was the best experience we had via airbnb，the owner really know travaller.’s needs，the community is good place for living，the kitchen is chef’ dream，sanitaryware is Kohler and American Standard，we also have lots of funs with table games in the house. Andy even found a new wallet we left and arranged the delivery，we strongly recommend it to family who want spend a wonderful vocation in Seattle
6586979,41356419,2015-08-07,32385422,Jane,"We couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more at Andy and Lynne's wonderful home away from home!  The house was spacious, clean, nicely decorated, and had all the amenities we needed.  The neighborhood was quiet and residential, and only a few blocks from some excellent restaurants which we went to often during our 10-day visit.  Only a 10-15 minute drive to downtown Seattle, it was conveniently located to many of the city's sites.  Andy and Lynne were excellent hosts and couldn't have been more accommodating and welcoming.  Andy was responsive to my frequent questions and quick to take care of any issues.  With two young children, he was also very understanding when they broke a glass and had a few spills.  My girls thought he was ""the nicest person in Seattle!""  Thank you, Andy and Lynne, for making our visit extremely comfortable and providing us with everything we needed (as those of you who travel with children know how important it is!)"
6586979,41950866,2015-08-10,27504965,Laura,"Andy was a great host! He was extremely helpful and his house was amazing, great location too! My friends and I had a great time staying there!"
6586979,42358468,2015-08-12,38594171,Ludger,"Lynne and Andy were excellent hosts. It was very easy to communicate with them and their detailed manual containing an abundance of information about the house and Seattle was extremely helpful. They were very attentive to our needs. For instance, when our youngest son felt unwell, they helped us out with information about pharmacies and doctors. The house was very spacious with all amenities and also conveniently located regarding shops and restaurants. We found Lynne's and Andy's place also very kids-friendly."
6586979,42719537,2015-08-15,28722420,Jiajie,Andy and his wife are very nice!! And their house is awesome. I like their kitchen.. The kitchen has everything I need!! 
6586979,44802827,2015-08-29,39257316,Laurence,"We thought this was a fantastic property in Seattle. There are absolutely no issues with the house it was perfect for a family of four. The bedding was excellent. The amenities were outstanding all the systems and service worked well. Andy is a superb host friendly and available yet unobtrusive. His guest guide was particularly helpful as where his recommendations. 5 stars all the way would come back here in a heartbeat. Perfect location to enjoy all of the Pacific Northwest. Particularly excellent where the garage parking air conditioning in Seattle which is generally rare and the very well equipped kitchen. 

I have two suggestions for first time traveler's to seattle the first is if you take the ferry to Bainbridge you must park in the town above the ferry you can not park at the ferry itself. The second suggestion is if you go to rattlesnake ridge which is a favorite hiking destination you must obtain a parking / discovery pass in the town near by before you go or you have to park outside the gates."
6586979,45074282,2015-08-31,14062298,Alex,Andy was great and so nice and accommodating. He was very friendly and even left us little welcoming gifts. His place was amazing and we loved the location that was so close fun cafes and restaurants. We enjoyed all the space and the overall view of the entire city was super relaxing to see from his balconies (plural) in the morning.
6586979,46211384,2015-09-08,13232151,Cindy,We had a great time. Wonderful neighbourhood to stay in and host gave us great restaurant recommendations! Thanks!!! 
6586979,47266762,2015-09-17,17687657,E.J.,"The house was perfect for our family trip to help move my cousin into Seattle University. There were 8 of us, 3 adults,  18 year-old, and then 3 kids between 8-12 and all of us fit comfortably. The house has some great views but we also liked the kitchen/family room where we all could hang out and have our various meals. 

The area was also perfect. There were plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, and bars (although we didn't frequent much due to the age of the group). It's very close to the campus, which was key for us, but we also found the campus to be in a very happening area as well. Downtown was only a few minutes away which helped us to hit the tourist spots in our jam packed agenda.

Andy was also a huge help. Being next door, he stopped by a couple of times to make sure everything was going well and if there was anything else he could do for us. He provided a lot of great recommendations for eating and seeing include Duke's which was fantastic and very reasonably priced! He provided an awesome guide book ahead of time and he was very thorough with providing all the information for the house. He was available via text or phone call for any quick questions or just to talk some smack on the Seahawks/Rams football game (we are Rams fans).

We would highly recommend this place and Andy has a host to others who are interested!"
6586979,47745942,2015-09-21,33085465,Steven,Very nice and comfortable place. Andy is an exceptional host. He even helped us pick up a birthday cake for my mom. Andy and his wife Lynn compiled a very thoughtful and detailed guidebook which made our trip very enjoyable. His home is very well located. Many excellent restaurants within 1-2 miles by car. I would recommend staying at Madison Steps if you are visiting Seattle.
6586979,48934781,2015-09-29,44107813,Angie,"We stayed last weekend and the hospitality was first rate.  We came in to an amazing, clean, modern house with a welcome bag and a bottle of wine.  Andy also was kind enough to pick up a birthday cake and have it at the house for our arrival.  He checked in with me periodically just to ensure the stay was going well.  I would definitely recommend anyone staying at this estate and would go back myself."
6586979,50809029,2015-10-14,44941904,Yichen,"This is a comfortable house with a good location.We love surrounding scenery! Andy is an excellent host, he waited us coming and teach us how to use lock！we enjoy stay in his house!"
6586979,51471346,2015-10-20,19783501,Megan,"Andy was a wonderful host.  Not only was he willing to host a group of 10 guys for a bachelor party, when the original property wasn't available, he went above and beyond to make sure everyone had space at a reasonable rate.  The location was great and the place was in great condition.  "
6586979,52881902,2015-11-02,29332948,Grace,"Andy was incredibly responsive and accommodating! He listened to what we needed, checked in on us, and was generally very flexible and amenable. He also wrote a personalized note and left a bottle of wine for us at check in - a lovely touch! Thanks so much for a great stay."
6586979,55406336,2015-12-01,46962040,Jon,"Andy was very responsive from the start.  I think we hit a transition point in the property makeover but even so all was as advertised.  Great neighborhood, easy access to downtown and nice restaurants in walking distance.  Nice welcome package waiting on arrival, very thorough manual on the workings of the property and local attractions provided.  Would recommend this property without reservation.

Thanks Andy for  a great Thanksgiving for our family of 5!"
6586979,56251545,2015-12-11,48598519,Garrett,"Andy was a phenomenal host for myself and my colleagues who had flown in for our company's holiday party. He welcomed us with a nice bottle of wine and bag of goodies. The property was exactly as described, if not better. We will definitely keep him in mind for future stays."
4430233,27962685,2015-03-15,1352959,Seraphina,"William's place was wonderfully located in capitol hill near great parks, coffee, bars, and restaurants. The house was spacious, private, and well-equipped for cooking, etc. I had a very lovely stay."
4430233,34714768,2015-06-11,32530630,Paul,"Quiet and comfortable are my main criteria for selecting a 
rental place. The Seattle Turret House is that and much more.
William, I have heard did the remodel of the house ,the
interior design and he had a big hand in choosing all the furnishings.He did a super job.
After you look at the photos of the apartments at Seattle Turret
House...look at the location map which shows how near it is
to all of Seattle's Attractions. I stayed four nights in June and it
was better than being ""downtown""."
4430233,37449209,2015-07-07,29582568,Eric,"This property is fantastic, especially for families. Having two bedrooms with a nice kitchen, living room, outdoor space, and bathroom is great a family visiting Seattle. The unit was very clean and nice towels were provided.  Driveway parking was well worth the $8/day, although street parking isn't bad. WiFi and DirectTV were included. The cost was comparable to a basic hotel room downtown - amazing value.

The neighborhood is very walk-able with nearby grocery stores, pharmacies, playgrounds, restaurants, coffee shops (of course), and bars. We walked to and from Pike Place Market and other downtown and waterfront sites. There are some hills and it isn't easy with a stroller, but a little exercise is good.

My only need during our stay was help getting the dishwasher started. The owner was traveling but immediately contacted the housekeeper to help us. His service was great - very thorough communications with us before our visit."
4430233,50269405,2015-10-11,5724353,Julie,The listing is absolutely accurate. This is a beautiful home! On street parking was easy to find in the evenings. If you don't plan to be out during the day much you will want to pay for private parking in the driveway.
4105081,21494751,2014-10-18,22354398,Manny,"Richard made us feel at home, helped familiarize us on how to get around, and even invited us out. I would definitely come back for a second visit! Friendly host, lovely home, and not too far from downtown! "
4105081,36297679,2015-06-27,34267629,Al,Richard was inviting and engaging. Great guy. Neighborhood was as he described in his welcome letter.
3317940,17967297,2014-08-19,19387630,Anna,"My fiance and I stayed in Rosie's Roost while in town for a friend's wedding. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we may be spoiled for life. Lisa is the owner and is a wonderful, considerate host. 

The space itself is great - a little mother-in-law suite in a house nestled in one of Seattle's cozy, quiet neighborhood's north of the University. Despite it's being on the ground floor, the kitchen/living room gets great sunlight and opens up onto Lisa's (rather amazing) garden and yard. She's happy to let you sit, chat, and enjoy a coffee among her flowers and vegetables. We loved hanging out with Dorje and the chickens! 

The kitchen has all the essentials to give you the option to stay in for breakfast or swing by one of the local grocery stores if you want to make a meal for yourself. Lisa was so thoughtful and stocked us with basics like coffee, breakfast fixings, and spices (and some fresh garden treats!) that really made us feel at home. Highly recommend the fresh eggs!! It's obvious she's put lots of thought into the kitchen and cabinets -and the whole apartment!- that would have made a longer trip - with more cooking - equally simple, enjoyable, and easy. 

The rest of the apartment is well-designed, updated, and cozy. The bedroom is lovely and quiet and a welcome difference from our last experience in a noisy, downtown hotel. Lisa also gave us great advice and pointers for a day-trip to Mt. Rainier National Park. The neighborhood is great and a quick trip to all sorts of fun Seattle spots! 

Couldn't have asked for a better trip! Rosie's Roost will be our first choice for future Seattle trip!! 

"
3317940,18478742,2014-08-27,17417528,Luc,"We had a very pleasant stay at Rosie's Roost. Lisa is a very welcoming  and attentioned host. The appartment is perfectly located to visit Seattle, close to the university and realy pleasant and convenient. Though thousands miles away from France, we feeled like at home. Many thanks!
 "
3317940,18816158,2014-09-01,17417528,Luc,"We were very pleased to join again Lisa's house after a trip in Nothwest Pacific National Parks, and our second stay was as pleasant as the first one.  We are now sure to have a good address in Seattle: Rosie's Roost! "
3317940,19170560,2014-09-07,1150079,Lucinda,"This place is wonderful! My boyfriend and I had a great time at Rosie's Roost. Lisa was very welcoming-- we got in late and was greeted with a bottle of wine and snacks. The apartment was clean, comfy, and super cozy.

I also LOVED the chickens. They were such a great part of the stay. Although it's not in the center of the city; it was quiet but still had a couple of restaurants nearby. We rented a car while we were in Seattle and there were plenty of parking in her area. I'd definitely stay there again! "
3317940,19547187,2014-09-14,20439635,Brittany,"I had an amazing stay at Rosie's Roost.  Lisa was incredibly helpful and welcoming.  All the pictures posted absolutely do to apartment justice.  It was very clean, the linens and towels were fresh and internet worked well.  Lisa was so sweet and left many special touches that made me feel all the more welcomed.  That being said, she was very respectful of space and privacy and really only had a presence during my stay because I wanted her to... I will absolutely stay here again, it was hard for me to leave... Very easy access to everything in the university district, very close to the Burke bike path as well which brings you just about everywhere you need to be.  Walking distance to a few choice restaurants and very close to local co-op food market.  Bike worked wonderful and put up w my lengthy 20 mile tour of the city.  Can't wait to go back and would recommend it to all my close friends/family.  Thanks Lisa!!"
3317940,19844194,2014-09-19,10662086,Bethia,"Rosie's Roost is situated in a quiet, green neighborhood and the house is set off the road. One is surrounded by gardens and flowers. There is a clutch of chickens on the property as well who remain remarkably quiet. I dined on freshly laid eggs and fresh tomatoes picked from the vine. I truly enjoyed my stay here and wish I could have stayed longer. Lisa is a wonderful host who made me feel very welcome. 
"
3317940,20195877,2014-09-25,1424074,Alison,"This is so far our favorite place we've stayed using AirBnb. Lisa was an excellent host, very detail-oriented and communicative. The apartment was clean and the bed comfortable, we slept better here than at home! We enjoyed starting each morning with delicious fresh eggs (courtesy of the back-yard chickens), toast and local cheese. It was great visiting with Lisa too, she is warm and has an abundance of interesting stories. Overall the suite provided us a lovely safe haven from the bustle of Seattle, and a great place to relax after a day hike. We would absolutely stay here again!"
3317940,20428521,2014-09-29,524384,Rob,"We absolutely loved our stay at Rosie's Roost. First and foremost, Lisa is a wonderful and warm host who made us feel incredibly welcome. When we arrived, there was a lovely fruit and wine basket waiting for us, as well as some fresh eggs from the hens. There was also great local coffee, tea and muesli to have for breakfast. 

We were traveling with our 15-month-old daughter, and she was able to get us a portable crib to use for the weekend. She also had some cute kids books in the apartment waiting for us! Lisa also gave us great advice on things to see and do in the neighborhood as well as greater Seattle. We loved the chickens (and their tasty eggs) too! The neighborhood was great, easy and quick to get to downtown Seattle, but a nice distance away that it felt quieter and more relaxed."
3317940,21353574,2014-10-15,21725691,Dan,"My family just moved to Seattle and we needed a place to act as a home base while we looked for a place to live and while I started work. Lisa made us feel very welcome and the apartment was plenty comfortable enough for us. My two young kids enjoyed very much the chickens as sell as Lisa's very well- behaved dog. It is kind of a basement apartment, but the house is on a hill and the living area gets lots of light so you would never know it. I would be happy to recommend it as a place to stay if any of my friends were visiting the city. "
3317940,22551408,2014-11-09,686367,Wally,We had a delightful stay at Rosie's roost. It is very convenient to the University of Washington area and a short drive to downtown Seattle and has plenty of free on street parking. Lisa made sure we were welcomed with a basket of local goods and fresh farm eggs from her chickens. We would definitely recommend Rosie's roost for those visiting Seattle. 
3317940,23644030,2014-12-07,23698610,Reuben,"Lisa was a great hostess, the whole apartment was beautifully stocked, welcoming and as advertised.  The neighborhood was perfect for walking and we enjoyed ourselves immensely.  There was a cold spell (we're Californians) and we did find the apartment somewhat chilly."
3317940,24541224,2014-12-30,14122286,Susan,"I had such a great stay at Rosie's Roost!! Lisa is a wonderful host with a very comfortable, welcoming home. The sweet chicks were a fun addition to a fabulous few days. I will stay with Lisa each time I visit Seattle. Thanks Lisa!!!"
3317940,25454654,2015-01-16,17575268,Samantha,"Big thanks to Lisa for such a calming and relaxing stay. I was not in Seattle for pleasure or vacation, so it was lovely to have a cozy and charming place to rest and rejuvenate. The location was perfect for my needs, and being able to walk to the U Village and the Metropolitan Market made things easy. Lisa was a warm and welcoming host and I look forward to staying at Rosie's Roost another time."
3317940,26640089,2015-02-16,23698610,Reuben,"We got a personal note from Lisa plus goodies that made our stay more pleasant.  We also got to pet her dog and feed her chickens, all of which made my four month old grandson very smiley as well. "
3317940,27222423,2015-02-28,19647644,Steven,"This place fit us perfectly....clean, well supplied, and on a quiet street. Lisa is super nice and had some great suggestions for hikes and restaurants.  We plan to visit Seattle again and hope Lisa's place will be available when we return."
3317940,28174550,2015-03-19,27960966,Cheryl,"Lisa was a wonderful host, very welcoming. We needed a place near home to stay while damage to our home was completed and Rosie's Roost met the need perfectly. From the welcome basket complete with sweet treats and wine to the fresh eggs from her delightful chickens, the stay was wonderful. The space was perfect for the two of us, cozy and comforting for the time we needed to be out of our house. Thanks so much Lisa! (and, of course, Dorje - you made us feel at home every day)
"
3317940,28740320,2015-03-29,13422970,Katharine,"This listing was completely accurate and a wonderful place to stay! We felt very welcome; the attention given to small details important to travelers is what made this charming apartment a perfect Airbnb. The welcome basket of eggs from the resident hens, bread, cheese, and fruit was enough for a wonderfully delicious and simple breakfast each day of our stay. Within a two-block walk there is also a good local coffee roaster and shop, Ventoux. The location was great, easy parking right out front, and Lisa was a treat. We had complete privacy when we wanted it yet were also able to swap stories with Lisa over dinner at a great pizza restaurant right up the street. We highly recommend staying here and hope to be able to visit again in the future.
"
3317940,29068190,2015-04-03,14801775,Katie,Lisa's place is hands down amazing! This was the last AirBnB stop on our trip and by far the best! I really wish we could have stayed longer. The bed was incredibly comfy and all of her personal little touches and treats were wonderful! I really wish we could have stayed at Lisa's place longer! 
3317940,29494379,2015-04-08,4455517,Amanda,"Staying at Rosie's roost was the perfect place. Lisa was wonderful to communicate with, was very helpful and welcoming, and the property was better than pictures.  We first arrived and were greeted by Dorje, we passed inspection,  and we met Lisa. We chatted for a long time before dropping our bags and walking to dinner that Lisa recommended. The location made it very easy to get to popular sites and other areas. The neighborhood and property were quiet and well taken care of. I even walked around the neighborhood in the evening by myself with no hesitation. Thanks to Lisa and Dorje for taking such good care of us."
3317940,30269643,2015-04-19,1947250,Stefan,"This has to be one of the easiest reviews I ever had to write. We had the most pleasant, comfortable stay, and I can't really suggest anything to improve - we will ask Lisa if she has space for us when we're back in Seattle. If you have never been in the area, the neighborhood is classic residential Seattle, there is a large grocery store with everything only two blocks away, and U Village is a short walk in the other direction. U Zoka, one of Seattle's best coffee shops, is down the hill and as laptop-friendly as they get. There are a number of nice restaurants in the immediate vicinity. And if you are visiting UW you can either walk or take a short bus ride. "
3317940,30651017,2015-04-25,1476131,Steve,"This place is PERFECT. Lisa welcomed us upon our arrival and the welcome continued as we entered this cozy, but spacious daylight basement room. There were fresh eggs as promised, plus granola, fruit, amazingly delicious unhomogenized milk, and a wonderful loaf of bread. Enough that we enjoyed a breakfast of these things all 3 mornings we were there. Location was quite and we felt absolutely safe walking in the beautiful neighborhood. I hope we get future opportunities to stay a Rosie's Roost again."
3317940,32690957,2015-05-20,30553644,Mary Jane,"Lisa has a beautiful home in a lovely neighborhood.  She gave us plenty of information to get in and comfortable.  We were met with a welcoming basket of food suited to our preferences.  All was well-equipped with everything we needed.  Comfortable, quiet, relaxing.  A wonderful garden.  Unfortunately, we did not get to meet Lisa personally because we had to leave early due to an emergency.  We did, however, get to meet the hens and listen to their sweet mummuring.
We are eager to return to Rosie's Roost and relax in this special place.  
"
3317940,33856672,2015-06-01,25177842,Masashi,Lisa is great host in Seattle! She gave me a so nice space and good feel communication. I can recommend for my friends. 
3317940,34646586,2015-06-10,32965253,Keith,"Great place to stay in Seattle! Close to the University district, grocery stores, and great coffee (@ Ventoux.) Rosie's Roost was clean and comfortable- I will most assuredly come back when traveling in the PCNW."
3317940,34782037,2015-06-12,3495843,Bruce & Natalie,"Lisa's lil' roost was just as delightful as described!  Lovely cozy place to call home for a few days!  It's all about the small touches of warm detail, that made me feel so relaxed and comfortable.   Really loved the ""Welcome"" basket left with goodies!  Thank you Lisa!!   "
3317940,35075187,2015-06-15,5692141,Tom,Had a wonderful time in this great neighborhood in Seattle.   Lisa was a great host and provided the essentials including fresh eggs!    Marvelous accommodations.  
3317940,35430070,2015-06-18,35652427,Chris,"We enjoyed Lisa's apartment very much.  It was well-lit, spacious, and comfortable, a welcome refuge from our hectic travels."
3317940,35651957,2015-06-21,30973247,Rebecca,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Rosie's Roost!
Lisa and Dorje were great hosts, helpful and pleasant. We had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We especially enjoyed our welcome basket of wine, cheese, fruit, and bread"
3317940,36511885,2015-06-29,5761461,Sara,"Lisa is one of the most congenial hosts I've experienced through Airbnb.  She makes an excellent ambassador for Seattle and the surrounding region, sharing a bevy of goodies from local producers, even as close as her own backyard chickens.  Our stay was perfect and the listing was very comfortable, but it was the hostess herself who made it so memorable.

As for the apartment, because of the way it is built into a slope, the front room was sunny but the bedroom, further back, stayed dark for a peaceful sleep, even when we went to bed before the sun did.  This did not feel like a basement apartment at all!  Although this is a 1-bedroom apartment, its arrangement--from French doors to separate the bedroom, an extra pull-out countertop space, and Lisa encouraging us to sit outside in the garden--made it feel very spacious.

The location offers convenient access to the freeways and downtown, as well as many great restaurants and lots of interesting shopping.  Within walking distance, there are both a Metropolitan Market and a charming coffee shop, Ventoux Roasters, which offered DELICIOUS coffee.  We partook of both many times.  My 9-year-old daughter was in a camp at the university while I took an art class downtown and I was able to get her to the campus, parked and checking in at her classroom in 20 minutes and then be at the Frye Museum in another 20 minutes.  It was a perfect location!

Thank you, Lisa, for a lovely time and for teaching my daughter a little bit about chickens and compost.  She loved meeting you and your dog Dorje, as did I.

We recommend Lisa's listing wholeheartedly and without reservation and hope to return ourselves in the future."
3317940,37870120,2015-07-11,16779710,Christina,"Lisa is a terrific host. She left a welcome basket filled with tasty goodies - it was a great way to begun our stay at Rosie's Roost. 

Rosie's Roost is a charming place. It is close to amenities, quiet, peaceful, and very cheery. You will definitely want to stay here."
3317940,39043161,2015-07-20,30738597,Midori,"Thank you, Lisa, for welcoming us into your home! We were so lucky to have found Rosie's Roost, and are so thankful for our time there. It was incredibly spacious, well lit, cozy, super relaxing, and conveniently located as well! And on top of all that, Lisa welcomed us generously with eggs and fruits from her own garden. We had an amazing time, and wholeheartedly hope many others come to enjoy this Seattle gem."
3317940,39748566,2015-07-26,5508470,Elizabeth,"Lisa was a wonderful host from the get-go.  She was responsive, informative, kind, and we immediately knew we'd chosen a great place.  We chose the UW district for medical reasons, but I'd choose this rental again just because this is a very special place in a great Seattle neighborhood with a wonderful host, privacy, peach and apple trees, grape vines, varietal veggie plants, fresh eggs from friendly chickens quietly clucking their contentment...we loved it.  And the apartment is serene, well equipped and totally comfortable.  "
3317940,40127388,2015-07-28,6199024,Jessica,"When we arrived, Lisa welcomed us with a basket of goodies with fresh fruits, eggs from her hens and a bottle of wine.  The space is cozy for us - 3 adults and a toddler. Our toddler loved her hens and chicks.  Lisa was a great host and checked in with us.  The only negative feedback was the confusion on the late check out.  We made the reservation at her place as we agreed on a late check-out due to my mom catching a 7pm international flight to London. But on the day of the check-out, as we were heading out for breakfast, Lisa reminded us to check-out on time. That puzzled me. I clarified that we had agreed on late check out time of 4pm but she didn't recalled it. She offered us a check-out time of 1pm as she has other guests checking in that evening. Over our rushed breakfast, I checked our previous correspondence on airbnb and we did agreed upon on the late 4pm check out. I was really upset.  Anyway, there wasn't a point for us to confront further about it. We got back to the apartment and as we were packing, Lisa dropped by and apologized. She was confused on our reservation with another person. She offered for us to stay for another hour or so but it was too late. We were all packed, the toddler was asleep in the car (we had planned for the toddler to take an afternoon nap and for my 70+ year old mom to rest a little in her place with the late check-out time). Lisa was very apologetic and even gave us fresh peaches from her yard when we were leaving.  Her place is a popular accommodation and I think the back-to-back reservations confused her for our situation. "
3317940,40637768,2015-08-01,4943312,Anna,"Thanks Lisa for a lovely stay! 

We were a family of 4, including two small children, and this AirBnB is better suited for 2 people - for example there are only two counter stools, and no high chair (Lisa did mention it in advance, though).

We enjoyed the place a lot - the jenga game, the organic eggs, the fruits, and most importantly - the convenient location. It is ~25 min drive to downtown, and ~15 min drive to the zoo.

The place feels like a farm stay, with the appropriate decor and chickens. Nevertheless - its in a city, walking distance to many useful places.

A minor nit: the bed was a little short for my spouse who is 6 feet tall."
3317940,41199245,2015-08-05,31934463,Kristian,Lisa was an absolutely wonderful host. Rosie's roost was nice and cozy. Our son loved the little chickens and miss Lisa's dog. The entire experience was and welcoming from the very beginning.
3317940,43229472,2015-08-18,9662986,Wilke,It's a very beautiful place! Lisa was also very friendly. Thanks again for the pleasant stay!
3317940,43807793,2015-08-22,39196250,Lisa,"Lisa is  a perfect host.She prepared plenty of bread, fruits, cheeses, eggs,beverages,wine and  travel guides for us.The  house is very quiet &convenient,bus stations to park ,university and dowtown are (website hidden) shop, restaurants, markets are very close. She is a so nice lady, she called a taxi for me even without pay. When I forgot my gift bag in her house, she drove a long distance send it to me immediately. Thank you so much Lisa, give you a big big hug. Hope to live in you lovely house next time."
3317940,44945276,2015-08-30,9940235,Jeffrey,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Rosie's Roost. Lisa left us a basket of goodies with delicious bread, butter and super fresh eggs. Her apartment was very comfortable and contained lots of special touches. The location was perfect for us, because we wanted to bike the Burke Gilman Trail and hike in Discovery Park. Plus, Lisa has great suggestions for dining. We loved Pair Restaurant and Ventoux Roasters on 55th, both easily walkable from Rosie's. We also liked that Rosie's is located in a friendly, quiet neighborhood. "
3317940,47727181,2015-09-21,16563066,Rebecca,Everything was great. A comfortable stay and easy in and out. Appreciate the little goodies and thought put into the stay. Will definitely recommend and hope to be back!
3317940,49168431,2015-10-01,20353980,Ilana,"The place looks exactly like the photos and is very clean. It's cozy, nicely designed, and I was very happy to be there."
3317940,49945018,2015-10-07,13315820,Renee,"Lisa's home was great! Everything we needed for a busy few days in the Seattle area. We spent all day running errands and apartment shopping it was so nice to come back to Lisa's comfy space. It was perfect for two people and super cute! I loved all the rooster and hen art. Lisa gave us a basket of bread, fruit and wine as well as fresh eggs from Rosie. SO nice!"
3317940,50869007,2015-10-15,42639537,Cathleen,Rosie's Roost was indeed a warm and cozy place to stay.  Lisa was an excellent host although we're not able to meet her during our busy stay. We were welcomed with a wonderful food basket and fresh goodies in the fridge.  Thank you Lisa!
3317940,51393111,2015-10-19,7836525,Jean,"Lisa a été très accueillante à notre arrivé, et même avant celle-ci en prenant le temps de converser par téléphone et répondre à nos questions. Son studio est situé dans la partie inférieure de la maison et elle vit au dessus. Très propre, décoré avec gout et fonctionnel. Lisa nous avait prévu une petite corbeille de nourriture/boissons délicieuse."
3317940,52343644,2015-10-28,8473031,Leslie,"Lisa was wonderful.  Her ""Roost"" had everything down to a lovely bottle of wine, fruit, and fresh eggs from her hens.

This was a lovely experience all the way around.  The neighborhood had parking, the apt. was very quiet, and during the day the sun shines in the windows.

Lisa, we had a wonderful time.  I hope to stay in touch!!!!"
3317940,55202489,2015-11-29,14122286,Susan,"Lisa is the consummate host. The welcoming touches are so lovely and just make you feel very much at home. This is my second time staying at Rosie's Roost and certainly won't be my last! A basket of fruit, wine and goodies were on the counter waiting for me to enjoy and the frig was stocked with butter, fresh eggs and cream. Coffee and tea were also  provided. The space is light and airy and so welcoming. I love the natural soaps, shampoos and laundry detergent. Lisa is warm and just the nicest person. My son is a grad student at U of W, so I will be back many, many times!!"
1279660,5743113,2013-07-14,7116081,David,"Grace and Andrew's place is amazing.  It's easily accessible from the street.  Beautiful, clean and cozy.  The sheets, towels, shampoos are better than what you'd find at any hotel - really amazing.  

They provided all the details we needed to get in and out and have a great time in Seattle.  Honestly, though, we really didn't have to leave Fremont: you just couldn't go wrong with any of the restaurants down the street.  Theo chocolate has a roasting facility a few blocks away that does tours!  All in all a wonderful place.  "
1279660,5952263,2013-07-23,1918455,Justin,"What an amazing stay!  Grace and Andrew were so friendly, welcoming and helpful.  The cottage itself is simply adorable. 

You get a free-standing building in front of the main house surrounded by a well-landscaped yard. Its a really beautiful design with very tasteful and modern furnishings that fit perfectly with the traditional elements of the building. The room itself has lots of light with many windows and several sky lights.

You also get a comfy queen-size bed, a small fridge, a tea/coffee machine, a bathroom that is well-appointed with nice toiletries and plush towels.  Wifi is also available. 

In the neighborhood, it is an easy walk to lots of restaurants and bars.  Gasworks park is also certainly in walking distance.

With an experience like this, I can't imagine why anyone would want to stay in a hotel.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat!"
1279660,5976088,2013-07-24,5619824,Adam,"Grace and Andrew provided a wonderful experience. Their place is beautiful, clean, and welcoming. The bed was comfortable and the decor was very nice. They were very helpful in suggesting great local spots for dinner. In the morning there was a card at our door thanking us for our stay and suggesting a great local coffee shop for our morning coffee. I am an avid coffee drinker and I can honestly say it was one of the best lattes I have ever had. Woot."
1279660,6015133,2013-07-26,1017435,Lacy Katherine,"What a fantastic location! The studio was very comfy and sparkling clean. Our hosts couldn't have been kinder or more thoughtful.  Nice and private, simple and  elegant.  Enjoy! "
1279660,6306429,2013-08-07,7352160,James,"My wife and I spent 12 days at Grace and Andrews cottage late July and early August. Cottage was clean, roomy and, comfortable. It was close to downtown Fremont and public transportation( and close to our daughter, but that won't do anyone else any good!)
My wife was concerned there was no TV, I was delighted, so make your own decision.  Not much in the way of closet/ storage space, but hosts just recently moved in to property and may rectify this in the future. We dealt with it just fine  Hosts were very friendly and accommodating, my only concern was we engaged them in conversation too often and would disrupt their day! We felt like we were staying with friends, I would highly recommend them. "
1279660,6594364,2013-08-18,3417366,Arlene,"I had a delightful stay at Grace and Andrew's cottage. I especially liked the proximity to Fremont, restaurants, grocery etc.
The cottage was very comfortable and clean and I would definitely stay there again."
1279660,6871016,2013-08-28,7069686,Sarah,"Grace and Andrew have a wonderful cottage! The cottage is very clean and has a comfortable bed, coffee maker, refrigerator, and bathroom. My mom and I stayed here together for 3 days. Grace and Andrew are extremely welcoming, accommodating, and friendly. We sat outside on their porch and enjoyed the beautiful weather and felt right at home. The location is perfect as well. We were able to walk only a few short blocks to numerous restaurants, bars, grocery stores, shops etc. Also, we were only a 10 minute drive to downtown. It was nice to stay out of the congested area and have our own space but still be within a quick walk and or drive to all of the areas we wanted to visit. I would give Andrew, Grace and their cottage 5 stars, and would recommend it to future travelers! "
1279660,6945889,2013-08-31,477260,Blake,"Grace and Andrew's little cottage was perfect for our overnight in Seattle. It was clean, comfortable, and cool. Andrew was super easy to communicate with, laid back,  and flexible on check in and check out. I would recommend their spot to anyone. "
1279660,7205375,2013-09-10,8365278,Theresa,"Grace and Andrew have a wonderful cottage. We had a great stay, location was perfect for exploring the area and meeting up with some local friends.

1279660,7554673,2013-09-24,4122108,Shanley,"What a perfect oasis with such a convenient location- not too mention wonderful hosts! We only stayed for one night, but wished we had longer to enjoy this location.  I know where we'll be staying next time we're in the area."
1279660,7642955,2013-09-28,7728472,Mary,This little place is cozy and pretty much perfect!  I only wish I would've realized this before I ever arrived for my daughter's wedding-I SO would've had it booked in for a LOT more nights for more of my family!!
1279660,7775766,2013-10-02,8573022,Wajiha,"We had a lovely stay.  Great shower, comfy bed, nice fireplace! Our car was small so we were able to park in the  driveway, which was really convenient!

The location was perfect! Close to major arteries such as Aurora & Westlake and walking distance to many Fremont bars and coffee shops like Ladro and Fremont Coffee House. "
1279660,7823265,2013-10-04,2134525,Anthony,"The studio is just as described and pictured. Located on a relatively quiet block close to all the great bars, restaurants, and cafés in the Fremont neighborhood. Bed was super comfy and the whole place was squeaky clean.

Grace and Andrew were great hosts and totally flexible with our ""check-out"" time and parking is easy. If you want a great stay in Seattle in a neighborhood away from all the tourists, I'd recommend this place."
1279660,7866474,2013-10-06,2409849,Mike,"Clean, comfortable place in a great location with helpful hosts.  It was exactly what we needed during our stay.  You can't beat the Fremont location with its proximity to so many bars and restaurants within walking distance.  The bed was remarkably comfortable and there was a generous supply of towels and washcloths."
1279660,7898761,2013-10-07,3511366,Heather,"Nice, clean and simple little space.  Comfy bed, nice towels and linens. Hosts were very friendly and accommodating, while still giving you your privacy.  Walking distance to center of Fremont."
1279660,8115400,2013-10-16,8679334,Ellen,"We stayed in the cottage a few nights while in town to visit our daughter who lives in the Fremont neighborhood.  The cottage is bright and welcoming (the bed is particularly comfortable).  Very conveniently located - just a few blocks to the neighborhood shops and restaurants.  

We would definitely stay here again!
"
1279660,8234715,2013-10-21,9328404,Zach,"We had a great time staying in Grace and Andrew's cottage, a really comfortable, private space on a quiet street.. but also a perfect location to get anywhere in the city!"
1279660,8340913,2013-10-26,1857087,Peter,"This is a beautiful place to wake up.  Cozy, but open and airy.  Grace and Andrew were responsive and made sure I had everything I needed, including a treat in the mini-fridge and tea for the morning.  The cottage is near enough to the center of Fremont to be walkable, but also far enough off any main street to be quiet.  I would happily recommend staying here."
1279660,8378604,2013-10-28,1275133,Melissa,"The cottage was cozy and in a great location walking distance from Fremont bars and restaurants, and near lots of bus lines if you want to explore Seattle.

Grace and Andrew were responsive before the trip and super accommodating. I would definitely stay again!"
1279660,8529475,2013-11-04,2478272,Alejandra,"I stayed at this lovely place for two nights. Everything was perfect and so very cozy. The location couldn't have been better, there are a lot of dining and shopping options within walking distance. Also, the neighborhood is safe and easy to navigate by foot. It was wonderful to come to a clean, safe, bright, and comfortable place after a full day of exploring the city.  I highly recommend this charming property to anyone. Merci beaucoup!"
1279660,8840718,2013-11-20,9152534,Jarkko,"Wonderful little cottage on such a nice, quiet street. Very private. Great bed and shower. Coffee and tea machine. Parking was easy. Very highly recommend.

1279660,9052121,2013-12-03,9127710,Bonnie,"This is a charming studio with a super comfy bed.  The fireplace keeps the place toasty warm.  Every inch is well  used.  I did wish that there was a closet to hang coats and clothes in.  But everything was so bright and clean that the lack of closet space did not bother us that much.  Our daughter lived within walking distance, so great location for us.  We stopped by the Fremont Brewing Co and had some really good beer.  "
1279660,9214555,2013-12-14,9356844,Matthew,"Andrew and Grace were fantastic hosts. The cabin was warm, cozy and clean, great location and very comfortable. I highly recommend it, and will not hesitate to say there again. "
1279660,9275261,2013-12-17,10425925,Theresa,"The host was very helpful and the room was lovely and very convenient. Only problem was the outdoor steps to get into the room were very difficult to climb, but it wouldn't be for most folks. The notes throughout the room were helpful and gracious! Lovely rooms. "
1279660,9405234,2013-12-27,260296,Michael,"Grace and Andrew were great hosts. The cottage was in a perfect location for us, just 2-1/2 blocks from our Son, Daughter-In-Law and Grandson's home and only an easy pleasant walk to downtown Fremont. The transit system to downtown Seattle and other areas was very convenient. I would recommend Grace and Andrew's cottage.

1279660,9627378,2014-01-03,10869488,Cynthia,The cottage was very clean and tidy.  The bed was very comfortable and I really appreciated the oversized shower.  Parking was easy to find and the surroundings were very peaceful.  The propane stove was a lovely bonus!
1279660,9926227,2014-01-20,271010,Kimberly,LOVE! At first we were worried about staying in a guest house on a shared property (opposed to a private home) but the place was magnificent. It was very private and by far the cleanest airbnb I have stayed in. It is very well decorated and romantic. The little fire place is soooo cute and also keeps it very warm inside. We will definitely stay here again. 
1279660,10005770,2014-01-25,3925139,Justin,They were very accommodating and the place was wonderful.
1279660,10090057,2014-01-30,3516390,Joel,"Simple, but cozy cottage with just the essentials and great access to dining and bars. I found the cottage to be very clean and functional. I really appreciated small touches like the stove heater and skylights. The shower also had plenty if hot water."
1279660,10165180,2014-02-03,10869488,Cynthia,"As in the past, Grace and Andrew's cottage was spotlessly clean, and comfortable.  The propane heater is a fabulous bonus!  Thank you again."
1279660,10241226,2014-02-08,2316057,Jen,Simple and cozy. Minimum amenities but all that's needed for a short stay. Clean and comfortable and lovely neighborhood.
1279660,10375508,2014-02-16,10922712,Ross,A perfect little cottage in a great location. Couldn't be better!
1279660,10551590,2014-02-24,345381,Andrea,"Meeting hosts like Grace & Andrew is one of the reasons why I love airbnb so much. There was a slight mixup in the reservation process (partly my bad, partly airbnb's poor UX, and not the host's fault whatsoever) but they were super accomodating and cool about it. The space itself is really done -- very cozy (LOVED the stove), and they've got great taste in decor. Despite the gloomy, gray weather outside, the cottage was completely filled with light and made for a great retreat from the rain. It was also within walking distance to a lot of great restaurants and bars. Would definitely stay here again!"
1279660,10764278,2014-03-06,8565081,Ej,"Staying at Grace and Andrews' cottage was a clean and comfortable stay.  Our hosts were so thoughtful and set up a few items that were incredibly helpful! Although we did not actually meet the hosts, they were available for questions and frequently checked in to see how our stay was going.  Thanks so much Grace and Andrew for being so accommodating! "
1279660,10854647,2014-03-10,2879336,Mimi,"We 100% loved this cottage!  It is so stylish and well designed along with having an extraordinarily comfortable bed.  The propane stove and skylights make it a particularly cozy spot to come home to.  Couldn't have been better, we'd love to return!"
1279660,11021395,2014-03-17,6185432,Kyle,Amazing hosts and an amazing place. Couldn't recommend it more!
1279660,11363379,2014-03-31,9878761,Lauren,I stayed here with my boyfriend over the weekend and it was great! The room was the perfect size and very comfortable.  The cottage is in a great location and within walking distance from Fremont.  I will definitely stay here again. Thanks for the great place!
1279660,11939283,2014-04-19,4871955,Christian,Great place. Very helpful. 
1279660,12090876,2014-04-22,14020772,Alisa,"this was a great find!  right in the heart of fremont.  it's about the size of a small hotel room -- it's got a bed, chair, and bathroom.  except instead of having to stay in a gross hotel room, you get your own little cottage!  skylights keep it really airy and open.  tons of windows.

it was very clean! i have an eagle eye for dirt and i could not find a SPECK of dirt in this place.

what else...the check in/check out process was really easy.   it's in fremont but it's still super quiet at night.  we were able to easily find parking nearby.  all the other reviewers are right -- the towels are super fluffy and awesome!   

in short, pretty much perfect!"
1279660,12311340,2014-04-28,14439757,Jordan,"We stayed in Andrew and Grace's cottage for a few days and had a great experience. The cottage is in a great part of town, with easy parking and quick access to great attractions around Seattle. The room was very clean, warm and cozy. They were great hosts and hope to see them again one day! "
1279660,12476286,2014-05-03,14766230,Nick,"This place is even better in person than it looks on the site, and the location is great! Great coffee, food, grocery, and views within short walking distance in Fremont. I was able to bike to downtown, Capital Hill, Green Lake, U District, Queen Anne, etc. very easily, and the very friendly hosts even provided bike storage. The bus was also convenient. I will definitely be returning. Way more affordable and better than staying downtown in my opinion. Thanks Grace and Andrew!"
1279660,12755703,2014-05-10,5237762,Emily,"The cottage was adorable and cozy. It was perfect for my business stay in Seattle: quiet, clean, and very close to the center of Fremont."
1279660,12849436,2014-05-12,9373755,Charles,"Grace and Andrew were great hosts!  The little cottage was clean, close to many activities, and private.  Thanks to them for providing such a nice spot in the Middle of the Universe : ) 
Don't forget to hit Fremont Coffee!"
1279660,12938334,2014-05-14,15241060,Sarah,"My husband and I only got to stay in Seattle for the night after arriving late, but even though our stay was very short it was truly the sweetest. The cottage was clean, delightfully decorated, and cozy. Grace & Andrew were so sweet and hospitable, giving us EXCELLENT recommendations for places to eat (Portage Bay was the best breakfast I've ever had). Thank you so much for opening up your cottage to us! "
1279660,13191278,2014-05-21,8167343,Amanda,"The cabin is super cute. It's my favorite kind of Airbnb place- all the comfort of a nice hotel and being able to come or go as needed and without disturbing the hosts, but with the touches of being in a local's home & neighborhood. We were visiting Seattle for work and found it easy to park our car on the street and leave it for the 3 days while we used the bus to get downtown. 

Grace & Andrew were very easy to schedule with and arranging keys. We only talked with them briefly in person, but they seem very nice and helpful. If we weren't there with a specific schedule in mind, I'm sure it would have been fun to talk with them more and get their tips about Seattle. "
1279660,13273988,2014-05-24,10668097,Casey,"Great studio cottage in a great location just north of downtown Seattle. Super clean bathroom, comfortable bed. A great place to rest your head after enjoying such a great city. Just a two block walk from the main drag of Fremont, you are walking distance to great bars, restaurants, shops, cafes, parks, the water and more. There is another strip of great stores and foodie spots on the other end of Fremont, also in walking distance. It was our first time in Seattle, and if we were to do it again, we'd do it the same way! "
1279660,13421652,2014-05-27,14341810,Chelsey,"Grace and Andrew were great to work with and were very friendly and accommodating! Fremont is a vibrant neighborhood, well-connected with transit, and central to other areas of Seattle.  The cottage is very cozy and well decorated, and I highly recommend it!"
1279660,13542818,2014-05-30,1094365,Cesar,"Grace and Andrew were terrific hosts - even though we never met them! They provided top-notch recommendations on sights to see, things to do, and especially on places to eat/drink. Their cozy cottage is situated in the heart of the lovely Fremont neighborhood, which is basically the center of the universe in Seattle. It is comfortable, well-lit (two skylights for natural light), and the bed is some sort of tempurpedic bed because we slept like babies. They provided amenities such as towels, coffee, toiletries, etc. I'd definitely stay here again."
1279660,13959955,2014-06-09,7251578,Josh,"Grace and Andrew's cottage is one of the best places we've stayed at through Airbnb. The location is wonderful, in a quite neighborhood, but a few blocks to some of my favorite Seattle restaurants and bars. My wife and I, however, ended up spending most of the trip relaxing in the cottage. The space is comfortable, warmly decorated and very relaxing. Grace and Andrew were very responsive and nice. We can't wait to return soon. "
1279660,14092180,2014-06-11,11446894,Heidi,My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Grace and Andrew's cottage! We arrived later than we intended to but they were very understanding. The cottage is very cute and clean and located in a nice neighborhood. There are lots of options on coffee and food and they're all within walking distance. It was a great experience!
1279660,14166271,2014-06-13,909580,Samea,The cottage was just as described and SUPER clean!!  The surrounding garden space and neighborhood were wonderful as well!! Highly recommended. You will not be disappointed.  
1279660,14565546,2014-06-22,15649547,Angelo,"Cottage was excellent, as advertised.  Private, conveniently located to explore the Fremont area by bike\foot and the rest of the city by car.  The hosts Grace and Andrew were very attentive, even providing me with an iron and ironing board so I could prep before heading to a conference.  Overall, great experience at a great price."
1279660,14752089,2014-06-25,578331,Brian,"Andrew was an amazing host. Extremely helpful and responsive. The cottage is just as good, if not better than the pictures. Fremont served as a great hub for exploring. We had to ""force ourselves"" to head downtown because so much cool stuff was within walking distance from the cottage. 10/10 would stay again. Oh yeah, the bedding was amazing! :)"
1279660,14860558,2014-06-28,14654736,Rianna,"Our trip was perfect! The cottage was clean, quaint, and full of special touches. Unlimited coffee and tea were much needed after a long flight and much appreciated. The location was great to explore the city and get some of the local flavor. We would highly recommend Redmill burghers and Paseo Subs. Thank you Grace and Andrew!"
1279660,15310838,2014-07-07,14231110,Joshua,"Andrew and Grace were extremely gracious hosts.  The cottage was clean, cute and comfortable.  The location was fantastic and within walking distance to great shops and restaurants in the Fremont area.  Their cafe recommendation was much appreciated as well!"
1279660,15446479,2014-07-09,13887533,Sara,"Wonderful little cottage!  Loved the neighborhood and accessibility to all of Seattle.  You don't even have to leave Fremont if you don't want too, it's such a great area.  Cozy, bright, and nicely decorated accommodations.  Great hosts.  We would definitely stay here again."
1279660,16081134,2014-07-22,15028173,Sally,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the cottage.  It was a great location for walking into town and convenient to buses.  Grace was very welcoming. It was a peaceful retreat with a comfortable bed and natural light (thanks to the skylights!)
1279660,16197329,2014-07-23,4543141,Philipp,We had a beautiful night in the cottage.. We slept very good in the comfotably bed.. There is a very nice seat where we enjoyed the evening.. Thank you for the beatiful stay.
1279660,16301185,2014-07-25,15149375,Alexandra,"This was a great place to stay. Grace and Andrew were responsive hosts and the cottage itself was cute, clean, and well-appointed--there were lots of thoughtful touches throughout. We didn't get to spend as much time exploring the neighborhood as we had originally planned because of rain, but it seemed like a great area and was definitely walkable to several bars/restaurants/coffee shops. I would definitely recommend this place to others looking for a home base to explore Seattle!"
1279660,16472913,2014-07-28,16570517,Emily,"Grace and Andrew couldn't have been more hospitable. Even when we had to arrive an hour earlier than usually requested, they were very accommodating and the guest home was pristine. Grace and Andrew have a very cozy home and provide great recommendations for coffee, food, and brews in the area. I'd highly recommend their guest space to anyone. "
1279660,16718677,2014-08-01,81846,Pat,"The neighborhood was handy and quiet, easy to get to any and all destinations. I ended up staying out later than planned, so I never got to meet Grace and Andrew, but they were gracious and made arrangements for me to get the key. The bed is better than what I have at home and the decor is perfect. I love this room, I plan to book next time I'm in town. "
1279660,17147637,2014-08-08,15581746,Cheryll,"This was our first B&B experience and we were very satisfied with our stay. We slept really well during our stay, which was most important. The cottage was spotless, decor was beautiful, and the amenities were complete. You can tell a lot of care and thought went into making our stay comfortable. Location is excellent! Close to restaurants (Andrew recommended Revel for dinner, and I must say it's one of the best meals we had in Seattle) coffee shops and public transit. We had an awesome stay here and sure others will too. Thank you Grace and Andrew!"
1279660,17207370,2014-08-09,16243153,Amanda,"My husband and I recently returned from our one night stay at the cottage in Fremont. This cottage is very cute and comfortable. The neighborhood is great. We only stayed for one night, but after touring the neighborhood we can't wait to get back. There are so many shops and restaurants nearby that we want to explore!  The cottage worked well for us because we had a car. Street parking was easy to find right in front of the house. Grace and Andrew were great hosts (although we never officially met them due to our very short stay). They provided easy instructions on how to access the house and provided great recommendations for shops, restaurants and cafes nearby. All in all, I would be happy to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. "
1279660,17432333,2014-08-12,14566737,Terrie,The listing was quite close to what we expected.  The cottage was very clean and tidy.  The neighborhood was perfect for our purposes  as it was close to family and close to walk to Starbucks in the morning (probably easy in Seattle!).  The hosts were were quiet so we felt our privacy was respected.  We would stay there again.
1279660,17578059,2014-08-14,18429076,Lauren,"The cottage is adorable, cleanly designed, easy to access, and simply a great place to spend a couple days. All the directions were helpful, there were plenty of amenities and suggestions, and we felt right at home, even though we didn't meet personally with our gracious hosts. Great job on the space. Beautiful and highly recommended. "
1279660,17935865,2014-08-19,15902957,Joe&Jen,"Grace & Andrew were excellent hosts--very prompt with communication and very helpful with suggestions for our time in Seattle. Great recommendations for food in the area, as well as helpful travel tips for getting around Seattle and crossing the Canadian border. Andrew also helped us carry our bags in, an extra nicety. 
The neighborhood is super cool and very safe. Conveniently located for great restaurants and even a chocolate factory nearby! The studio was perfect for relaxing after a day full of adventures. Everything is very clean and orderly. Definitely recommend this place to anyone staying in Seattle."
1279660,17994859,2014-08-20,13384860,Beata,"Cottage was very clean and super cute.  Great amenities with toiletries and coffee set up.  Wonderful location walking distance to all the Fremont attractions.  Grace & Andrew were excellent hosts and super easy to communicate with.  I accidentally left my sunglasses behind, but Andrew was kind enough to call me to let me know so I could pick it up before going out of town.  Thank you for hosting us!"
1279660,18082112,2014-08-21,10089095,Chenlu,"We meet Grace & Andrew briefly after we checked in, so warm & welcoming!
Everything is perfectly designed modern comfortable. Thank you so much!"
1279660,18139255,2014-08-22,2565156,Henry,"Andrew and Grace were super responsive to any questions i had, and other than that we had our own private cottage for a night; perfect! Also, the cottage was well stocked with things that the traveler might need, like q-tips, or a corkscrew. And, if you don't know, Fremont is a great neighborhood for walking, getting drinks, a bite, or a stroll on the trail by the water. "
1279660,18198925,2014-08-23,7864256,Harry,"The cottage was exactly as pictured and described in the listing. It was a very clean, cozy space. My girlfriend and I were only in Seattle for one night getaway so the cottage was perfect as it was close to the city centre. Grace and Andrew were incredibly pleasant to speak with and responsive when we had any questions. We didn't get to explore the surrounding neighbour much, but it seemed safe and quiet. There was also a convenience store (7-11) within a 3 minute walk. "
1279660,18285774,2014-08-24,12934633,Ryan,"The studio cottage in Fremont was perfect for an overnight stay.  The key was very easy to find and entering was no problem.  The room and bathroom were extremely clean and very comfortable...The bed was VERY comfortable.  The location is fantastic--very close walk to all the restaurants, bars in the Fremont neighborhood.  I did not meet my hosts Grace & Andrew, which is fine, as I like my privacy.  I would highly recommend staying at the cottage and look forward to staying again when I'm in Seattle for work or play."
1279660,18398252,2014-08-26,14862233,David,Very convenient and clean cottage.  Friendly and extremely helpful hosts.
1279660,18574981,2014-08-28,8166172,Jeff,"Great place! Cool neighborhood close to all the restaurants, bars and stores. We had everything we needed. The cottage was cozy. There was even a parking space! And a great coffee setup with lots of options."
1279660,18583903,2014-08-28,20131894,Kelsey,"Our stay at Grace and Andrew's was terrific! The cottage had everything we needed for our stay, and street parking was easy to find nearby. Grace and Andrew were quick to respond to any questions we had, and gave us some tips on a great place to eat nearby. We will certainly keep this cottage in mind for future trips to Seattle! Thanks again!"
1279660,18872938,2014-09-02,14904717,Patrick,"This place was great. On a quiet street but so close to the heart of Fremont, which is one of the best places to be in the city. If you need to spend time downtown, you're close to a bus stop that will take you right there.

The room is nice and comfortable, the hosts are very accommodating.

Just a great place to stay. No complaints."
1279660,18981607,2014-09-04,7594483,Melanie,This listing is unique and comfortable. Close to many restaurants. Communication with hosts was easy.
1279660,19137623,2014-09-07,19260465,Matt,"The perfect experience for our Seattle stay. Couldn't ask for a more comfortable spot to call home temporarily. You are two blocks away from the action of Fremont, yet able to peacefully retreat back to a cozy cottage at the end of the day. Looking forward to our return trip!"
1279660,19316713,2014-09-10,17708372,Edwin,"Great stay, friendly and helpful host. Great neighbourhood. "
1279660,19519039,2014-09-14,6002564,Maeve,Had a great time staying at Grace & Andrew's guest house! The place was comfortable and in a fantastic location. We did a lot of walking and enjoyed getting to know Fremont and surrounding neighborhoods. 
1279660,19634325,2014-09-15,20770330,Mark,"We felt welcome arriving to a place described accurately, clean, quiet and the ability to arrive discreetly. We felt trusted even though we hadn't met our hosts and this makes for the ability to relax upon arrival, no formalities required. And when we met outside later during our stay, we felt even more welcome!"
1279660,19727507,2014-09-17,5408773,Ellen,"Our experience in Grace + Andrew's cottage was excellent. The studio was bright, airy, clean and  comfortable and offered a number of great-to-have items/ammenities while traveling. The neighborhood was great. Grace and Andrew were extremely pleasant hosts, and we'd gladly stay a second time if in Seattle again. "
1279660,19937969,2014-09-21,14849704,Ivory,"Wonderful location, great neighborhood, and awesome hosts!
My boyfriend and I stayed here for a few nights- I was attending an orientation at UW and he was sightseeing- and this was the perfect location, with convenient bus routes, bike trails, and tons of things to do in Fremont.  Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Grace, but Andrew was very accommodating and gave us some great tips on things to do in the neighborhood.  The cottage itself is small but welcoming, with plenty of amenities.  Loved the fireplace and the skylights.  Would definitely stay there again next time we're in Seattle!"
1279660,20020356,2014-09-22,19681619,Henrie,"My wife and I stayed at this place only for a night. We would've stayed longer if able. Andrew and Grace were very accommodating. Communication was very great. We met Grace when we first got there, she was very sweet and gave us a few suggestions on places to hike. The area was great, the cottage was awesome - really cozy. My wife couldn't stop talking about every little detail she loved about it. Plus you have your own spot to park in. We just walked to whatever was close by - and there is a lot to do. We would definitely stay here again if we're able to come back to Seattle."
1279660,20148682,2014-09-24,7702426,Kayla,"Andrew was incredibly welcoming, easy to communicate with, and gave us great recommendations. We did not get to meet Grace, but we only stayed one night. They have done an amazing job making a garage-sized room feel spacious, and this is probably the most efficient layout we've seen in our airbnb stays. It is super-cute with unique furniture and thoughtful touches (like night-stands on both sides of the bed and a reading lamp). The bathroom is gorgeous and clean. We also appreciated the small refrigerator, and the coffee maker, but it is worth the walk up the street to the Lighthouse coffee shop. We did not have too much time to explore the area, but it seemed like there was plenty available within walking distance and the neighborhood had a really nice welcoming, comfortable, and safe vibe. We highly recommend staying here!"
1279660,20415312,2014-09-29,5670309,Sarah,"Let me start by saying that this location is fantastic --just a few blocks from downtown Fremont.  Andrew and Grace answered my emails and phone calls right away, so communication was smooth and easy.  They live very close to the center of Fremont, but somehow I always was able to find parking. The inside of the cottage is adorable, especially the bathroom. The skylights and windows let in a lot of light, so even on overcast days there was still a lot of natural light in the cottage.
I booked this cottage as a place for my out-of-town mother to stay during a visit.  She is in her mid-60s,  has suffered a previous fall and doesn't like climbing up or down steep or uneven steps.  There was no mention of steps up from the street in the description.  To get up to the cottage, there are  ~7(?-I never counted) steep steps and the top one was broken. I contacted Andrew about this, and he immediately replied that they are working to fix the step.  (He called it ""slanted"").  There is also not a handrail to hold onto while moving up these steps, so if it is slippery (it rains a lot here) it could be kind of tricky if you lost your balance.  The light right outside of the cottage (gray bubble underneath window in photo) was also burned out during her stay, making it hard for my mother to find the key at night and manage the steps directly into the cottage.  Andrew said that they will fix this also.
For a person younger than her, these details would NOT MATTER AT ALL.  
Overall my mother had a very pleasant stay. I just wanted any older potential guests to have an understanding of what to expect if these details are important to you because they are not in the description. "
1279660,20570146,2014-10-01,2596992,Amanda & Patrick,"I had a wonderful stay in this great little cottage. It's stylishly appointed (love the rug and bed!) and set up with everything you need for a weekend in Seattle. Even though I was in town for work and racing all over for appointments, I still had time to enjoy the neighborhood. Just a short walk to shops and restaurants in Fremont (Book Larder!) and Wallingford (Whale Wins! Westward!) and a quick jog down to the waterfront path. "
1279660,20621115,2014-10-02,18561739,Pierre-Luc,"Very nice guest ! Felt like home... Five stars. Thank you again for your great recommandations ! 
"
1279660,20814224,2014-10-06,14159544,Amanda,"The listing was exactly accurate and we enjoyed a private, quiet experience in the Fremont Cottage. The bed was comfortable, all desired amenities were provided (extra toiletries, Keurig coffee in the morning) and the cottage was nice and clean. It was easy to walk to Fremont and enjoy the restaurants and shops there, and parking was pretty easy too. No complaints, and we'd happily stay again!"
1279660,20921191,2014-10-07,21500809,Michael,Grace and Andrew were wonderful hosts!  The cottage was clean and quiet.  It's location was very walkable.
1279660,20956317,2014-10-08,3516669,Michaeljohn,Grace & Andrews cottage is a great little self contained apartment in what seems like a quiet neighbourhood of Seattle. The room itself super comfy and clean. The hosts are very friendly and helpful. We had a car and it's an easy 10 minute drive to the centre of town. 
1279660,21022514,2014-10-09,19659199,Angela,"We put a last-minute request in to Grace & Andrew to stay at their cottage the day before we wanted to spend the night, and the request was approved immediately, and communication was easy! Their place was easy to find and close enough for a short drive to Pike Place Market! Grace was there when we arrived, she was very cordial and had pre-written some helpful information. The cottage itself was beautiful and spotless! Great use of the space- very comfortable & cozy. There were also some extra toiletries in case needed- I ran out of toothpaste, so that came in handy! I used the Keurig to make coffee in the morning, before heading out. And we were good to go. 5 stars!
"
1279660,21037876,2014-10-10,8784168,Clayton,"It was clean, quiet, and in a great location. Very walkable and close to bars, restaurants, and shops. "
1279660,21115941,2014-10-11,373702,Vivian,"Grace and Andrew's cottage is a lovely place to stay. They accepted our last minute request to due to going to a late concert in downtown. (Our residence is just a ferry ride away.)We would have went for a hotel but are so glad we didn't. It was clean, quiet, cozy, and private. Couldn't have asked for a better place. It had all the amenities you could need.  Great location, the  commute to Seattle that evening and the next morning were quick and convenient. Didn't get to meet Grace, however, Andrew is quite kind and is prompt in responding. Would definitely stay again. "
1279660,21202081,2014-10-13,13462117,Lauren,"Impressions: Cute, intimate space; great modern decorations.  Quick walk to all that Fremont has to offer. We were in town for a wedding so didn't spend much time in the cottage (and didn't have the opportunity to meet the host), but wish we'd brought a JamBoxx or similar for entertainment while getting ready. 
Overall, great spot for an active weekend exploring the city.  "
1279660,21302354,2014-10-14,17268492,Chloe,"Our experience at Grace and Andrew's cottage was absolutely wonderful. We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay during our night in Seattle. We especially loved the warm and cozy feeling that the cottage offered and the care put into the details, like the little fireplace. Thank you, Grace and Andrew! We are very grateful for our time in Seattle."
1279660,21352269,2014-10-15,21619230,Nicole,"My mom and I spent the night here and we loved it! I wish we could've stayed longer!  The cottage was homey,  perfect size, and super cozy. We didn't get to meet Grace or Andrew but they were great hosts!  They answered any questions we had, made restaurant recommendations,  and made sure we had what we needed. Close to restaurants and not far from downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay at the cottage again!"
1279660,21691863,2014-10-21,7305871,Kandis,Andrew was awesome! He was so friendly and had great suggestions. The place was very accommodating and exceeded our expectations. It was very nice and spotless. Will definitely be staying here again on my next trip to Seattle. 
1279660,21763257,2014-10-23,728883,Guillermo,"This cottage was lovely. The sun never came out in Seattle while I was there, yet there was plenty of light in the cottage to satisfy my California spirit. It is located in a quiet street, but it is also walking distance from the Fremont shops and restaurants. The only thing I would warn guests about is that the internet is too slow for Business travelers. "
1279660,21783723,2014-10-24,8303643,Carolyn,"This space is lovely, cozy, and easily accessible.  In a great location. Super cute, loved it!"
1279660,21925540,2014-10-26,11803109,Patrick,I'd like to leave a bad review so no one can find this gem!  Great place and great location! 
1279660,22030503,2014-10-28,3346240,Jinah,"Andrew and Grace were super hospitable and generous! The cottage is well decorated and equipped with lots of useful things (toiletries, maps, coffee, awesome fireplace!). The memory foam mattress is reeeally comfortable, too!

They're just up the hill from a bus stop and delicious thai food and coffee joints, so location is also great.

Andrew and Grace were always easy to reach via phone/text and flexible with bag drop-off before check-in time.

In a nutshell, great hosts, great room!"
1279660,22222573,2014-11-01,2649364,Nancy,Been eyeing this studio and had it on my wish list. It worked out beautifully to be able to stay there last minute. Appreciate Grace's swift reply back. It was just as pictured. The gas stove heater was amazing and we appreciated the onsite parking space.
1279660,22232603,2014-11-02,7427990,Bailey,"Though we never got to meet the hosts, we loved staying in their place! It was extremely clean, cute and comfortable. It was in a great location, and we really enjoyed our stay here."
1279660,22428901,2014-11-06,13506605,Chelsea,The hosts made us feel very welcome and the place was exactly as described in the listing. It was located in a great neighborhood in Seattle and was perfect for first-time visitors. 
1279660,22700826,2014-11-12,6359357,Janet,"The cottage is beautiful, clean, cozy, and comfortable, exactly as described and pictured.  The location was perfect for me, within walking distance to public transportation and Fremont shops and cafes.  I would definitely like to stay there again on my next visit to Seattle.  "
1279660,22747717,2014-11-13,8280892,Glynda,"Grace & Andrew's cottage in Fremont was a peaceful retreat after
a busy day in Seattle.
The location was perfect for walking to 2 excellent restaurants
and enjoying the unique energy that only lives in Fremont.
Grace & Andrew were great hosts, from giving us excellent options for dining, to providing a clean, comfortable, & private spot to enjoy.
The fireplace really adds more than heat, but great ambiance too.
If you come to explore Fremont, you'll LOVE staying here.

"
1279660,22840059,2014-11-16,2021441,Albino,"The cottage was perfect - clean bathroom and a comfy bed. We enjoyed the fire place the most since Seattle was cold during our stay but be careful because it gets the cottage toasty. All A's for the hosts too. Grace left us a surprise bottle of champagne to say congrats on a big life event. She did not have to but it was a kind gesture that shows how awesome these hosts are even in the little details. They were quick to respond to questions and very helpful with suggestions. Do go on the chocolate tour they mention in the guidebook. Location is awesome and close to see the sights in downtown. In short, stay in the cottage and enjoy Seattle."
1279660,22932458,2014-11-17,23622606,Michael W.,"Grace and Andrew's private studio cottage is a wonderful getaway in Fremont, that's well worth the stay.  Very clean and accommodating, with new features-the bathroom is very well done.  The neighborhood is residential, with the typical sounds you would expect on a weekend in the Fall-folks working in their yards, kids playing, and light car traffic, but the evenings were quiet and peaceful.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed our stay and will consider staying again in the future. "
1279660,23037219,2014-11-21,3521188,Heidi,"You really can't beat the location here. So walkable to everything we needed. The place was cozy and the little furnace was absolutely perfect. The bed is cozy, I think it's a foam mattress :) check in was a breeze, thanks for a great stay!"
1279660,23123311,2014-11-23,3286553,Julia,"Beautiful, quiet, sweet, elegant, warm space. Thanks, Grace!! We felt right at home in your tiny house... I wish we could've stayed more than one night! Loved the restaurant recommendation for Brimmer and Heeltap... you were spot on about the delicious food and cocktails ;) I'll definitely stay here the next time I'm in Fremont!"
1279660,23182508,2014-11-24,23675669,Kendra,"Staying in the Private Studio Cottage was a perfect fit for my visit to Seattle. Public transit is easily accessed from this location, not that it is needed with the main area of Fremont so easily accessible. The cottage itself was better than described; it was clean, quiet and inviting. So many cute yet practical touches too, I felt like I was staying in the home of a thoughtful friend. Grace's explanations on how to access the cottage and how to use the amenities that are provided were straightforward yet attentive to detail, which I found to be extremely helpful during my stay. "
1279660,23362515,2014-11-30,1399242,New,"The place was so clean decorated beautifully, and comfort.  the communication was very easy.  the neighborhood was safe, close to every thing.  I highly recommend it."

1279660,23913135,2014-12-14,9453387,Colleen,The cottage was a beautiful respite in the Fremont neighborhood. I highly recommend it and will go back again.
1279660,24024072,2014-12-17,1140764,Didi,Grace's place is absolutely wonderful.  The cabin was clean and had good amenities.  Very convenient location.  It's close to shops and restaurants and 15 minutes drive away from downtown.  Highly recommended.
1279660,24260945,2014-12-24,10103587,Adam,"A lovely place is a great location, especially if you enjoy walking and don't mind a few hills. Everything in Fremont was obviously super close, but we even walked to Ballard while we were here. There are plenty of great restaurants in the area, and we definitely enjoyed being able to walk to Fremont Brewing's Urban Beer Garden. Check in and check out were super easy. We'd definitely love to stay here again!"
1279660,24387395,2014-12-27,14724197,Robert,"In short notice I discovered that I would need a hotel for my holiday trip to see friends at Christmas. I did not want to stay in a hotel at Christmas, so I reached out to Grace regarding her place. My question, ""Is there a tree?""

Grace put a Christmas tree in the warm, tiny home. It was perfect. I had the tree, the little fire and enjoyed a memorable holiday in Seattle.

Grace is organized. She had all of the details written out. Getting the key and parking could not have been easier. 
I location is perfect, close to several bus lines that will take you dowtown in 20 min. (Grace's app recommendation OneBusAway is a great discovery.) Walk down to Revel for some good food.

I would recommend the place and Grace - an easy experience during a hectic holiday time."
1279660,24423186,2014-12-28,1171369,Lincoln,"Great little studio suite right in Freemont. Cool design/decor, king memory-foam, would happily stay again."
1279660,24492192,2014-12-29,13492116,Rachel,"Great location! Quiet place, but only blocks away from a main street with restaurants and bars etc.  Grace was a wonderful host, had great suggestions. Comfortable room with great little electric fire.  Lovely visit. "
1279660,24609703,2014-12-31,2329605,Amy,We had such an amazing time in this perfect Fremont cottage. We were out and about constantly during the day and this location was perfect for getting all around the city. Grace was so gracious and had everything to make our stay wonderful. We especially loved the little gas furnace and the hot apple cider we enjoyed in the morning! Absolutely perfect stay and we can't wait to visit again! 
1279660,24833079,2015-01-03,21500862,Lou,Amazing location in heart of Seattle with great access to everything. Very comfortable and convenient. Great place to stay!

1279660,25342339,2015-01-12,5371648,Neil,"Wonderful studio!  We are Seattleites who needed to be out of our house for some renovations. The studio is clean, quiet, and easy check-in/out.  We choose to stay in the Fremont neighborhood because it is ""the center of the universe)- great restaurants, nightlife, strolling.  While there, we walked up the hill to the Phinney Ridge neighborhood, back to Fremont then over to the nano-breweries in Ballard."
1279660,25445907,2015-01-16,15121499,Kathryn,This was a great place to call home for a few days. Cute and cozy in a wonderful neighborhood. Everything about staying here was easy! Would be amazing in the summer in sure!
1279660,25539969,2015-01-19,20444122,Alyssa,"Grace was a wonderful host and the cottage was perfect. We had an excellent weekend stay in Seattle-it helped that we were so close to most of the areas we wanted to visit. 

Thank you Grace for a convenient and lovely experience! "
1279660,25635901,2015-01-21,4138425,Richard,"The studio cottage was a wonderful retreat for my wife and I when visiting Seattle.  And it is an easy walking distance to Fremont, which is full of shops and restaurants.  Grace is a wonderful host - she made sure we were accommodated according to our schedule and the studio was very well appointed and spotless.  Very warm as a person and a place!"
1279660,25667927,2015-01-22,5782967,Maggie Sue,Super cozy and clean! Grace was very easy to reach and quick to respond if we had questions. This was the perfect little space for us. Great location and a short walk away from all the awesome restaurants/shops in Freemont. The little stove is amazing! 
1279660,25835793,2015-01-26,14815027,Serena,"Grace was very accommodating for a last minute booking which was appreciated. Her space was clean and chic. I happen to be from Seattle, so can attest that Fremont is one of the best neighborhoods to visit, and this location is in easy walking distance to all the ""center of the universe"" activities and sites. The electric fireplace kept it cozy. There was a little fridge but no TV, which was great for the solitude I was looking for."
1279660,25907090,2015-01-29,2640365,Kate,"I had a wonderful stay at Grace's cottage! The room is lovely, very clean, comfortable and stylish.  The neighborhood is fabulous, with great coffeehouses, restaurants and little boutiques. I would stay here again in a heart beat! Thanks Grace!"

1279660,26672722,2015-02-17,17694326,Jill,"My husband and I stayed in Grace's lovely cottage during our trip to Seattle to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We had an absolutely fabulous time! The room was so warm and inviting. The pictures and description were absolutely accurate and we are so glad we stayed there. We absolutely LOVED the neighborhood and found ourselves saying that if we ever moved to Seattle we would definitely want to live in the Fremont district. Her home is within walking distance to some amazing coffee, restaurants and a really fun cider bar. It's also a short car ride to Ballard (our other favorite district) and not too far from the city center and fun tourist attractions (the Fremont Troll, Space Needle, etc.) Grace also provided some awesome recommendations for places to eat knowing I have some food allergies/restrictions. We absolutely loved every second of our time in Seattle and are so glad we chose Grace's cottage to stay in. We will absolutely stay here again the next time we visit! "
1279660,27040083,2015-02-23,5012818,Michael,Just as described clean quite easy and accessible.

1279660,27223910,2015-02-28,5873775,Jennifer,"This is one of the loveliest urban AirBnB listings I've ever stayed in.  Grace was a very accommodating host--especially when it came to negotiating an early arrival time--and has thoughtfully stocked her cabin with everything a traveler might need. The space was clean, safe, and welcoming. I come to Seattle often for work, and I absolutely hope to stay here again. "
1279660,27403863,2015-03-03,14737109,Jean,"Perfect, amazingly beautiful, and Grace is the best host!  Everything you need, including detailed instructions. The cottage is as beautiful inside and out as it looks on the website, and the location is central to everthing!  I can't wait to return!"

1279660,27722988,2015-03-10,5639292,Leslie,"Grace's cottage was the perfect accommodation during our recent trip to Seattle. We had a rental car, and it seemed that everywhere we wanted to go was either walking distance or a 10-15 minute drive away. The cottage itself is so charming and sweet, we felt comfortable and at home during our stay. We didn't actual meet Grace, but getting the key, etc. is made so easy that it's nice as the traveler to have the autonomy to check-in without the hassle. Thanks again Grace, we'd love to stay here on future trips to Seattle!"
1279660,28251972,2015-03-21,28793,Sara,Our stay at Grace's studio cottage was lovely! It was just like the beautiful pictures we saw on AirBnb and we are actually going to go back and stay again before we leave Seattle because we loved it so much! 
1279660,28532013,2015-03-25,21374183,Jenna,The cottage was perfect for our stay in Seattle. Nice neighborhood and a brisk walk down to coffee shops in the mornings and bars at night. My boyfriend gets cold very quickly but the heater in the cottage kept it nice and toasty at night. We would recommend to our friends visiting the area. Thanks Grace! 
1279660,28579705,2015-03-26,20778722,Susan,Grace's cottage worked out perfectly. The location is great and the cottage was just what I expected. I hope to stay there again sometime. 
1279660,28600025,2015-03-27,28793,Sara,"Once again, we had an absolutely lovely stay at Grace's cottage in Fremont. It was very clean, very comfortable for the two of us and just made us feel like we were right at home! Thanks so much, Grace!"

Everything is super clean and she has nice lotion/ shampoo, etc. There isn't much in the way of amenities, like a microwave or eating utensils (it's just a tiny studio), but if you don't need these items, it's perfect. Great location and Grace is very quick to respond to any questions!"

As a romantic evening away from the children it was excellent. Great coffee, restaurants, and bars near by. A great 24 hours in the center of the universe."
1279660,30332744,2015-04-20,7958771,Krisina,"What a great place to stay in Seattle! Grace's cottage was cute, comfortable, and in a great location. The room was nicely decorated and contained all of the amenities we needed for our stay--including a hair dryer, shampoo, conditioner, and a Keurig coffee-maker. The bed was firm but comfy, and a gas fireplace kept the room toasty at night.

For the most part, the cottage felt pretty private, though it is located in the front lawn of Grace's home so we occasionally overheard people walking by or talking outside, including in the morning and late at night. Finally, the location in Fremont was very convenient, allowing us to get to downtown Seattle in a quick 10-15 minute Uber ride and only a short .5 mile run to a great trail along Fremont Cut/Lake Union. Overall, highly recommended."
1279660,30502037,2015-04-23,28843369,Tavi,"Friendly hostess, clean, adorable quiet private cabin. Loved the memory foam bed, great shower. Little refrigerator,  nice bathroom amenities, beautiful views of garden, skylights, parking in driveway. Would definitely stay here again.. a little home away from home. A jewel of a find convenient to everything. "
1279660,30624160,2015-04-25,29760480,Katie,"Grace’s apartment is clean and has all the necessities one needs when away from home.  You can’t beat the location, my husband and I spent the first night walking the area, and checking out all the fantastic restaurants.  My husband and I felt safe at all times, and had no issues with the street parking. "
1279660,31245920,2015-05-03,8689886,Hundley,Wonderful place to stay in a great location in Seattle!
1279660,31774122,2015-05-10,28289062,Celeste,"I had a wonderful relaxing experience! Parking was an awesome bonus and my partner and I enjoyed the privacy. The neighborhood is amazing, and we would definitely love to visit again!"
1279660,32052203,2015-05-13,21693868,Ricky,"We enjoyed staying at Grace's studio cottage in Fremont. It was bright, clean and had everything we needed. The location is amazing and just walking distance from tons of shops and restaurants. Hosts like Grace make airbnb an easy choice. "
1279660,32272734,2015-05-16,8797207,James,"The cottage is off the main drag so it's extremely quiet at night, but it's also close to the bus line so getting to other parts of town is simple. Grace addressed all the main points -- travel from the airport, check-in -- beforehand making the trip rather easy. Her guidebook is also a great place to start when exploring the city."
1279660,32842336,2015-05-22,9581383,Cora,"What a cute spot! The aesthetic of Grace's cabin is really intriguing and comfortable. Everything was neat and clean, and check-in and check-out were super easy. The price of staying in the cabin is very generous.

Grace herself was a super friendly and helpful host. She was very responsive.

Fremont is a really interesting locale to explore (especially the chocolate factory a few blocks away!). The cabin is also very close to trails along the water and the statue of Lenin."
1279660,32961750,2015-05-24,25030550,Chelsea,"Awesomely cute space, perfect homebase for exploring Fremont and Seattle. We had a great time staying with Grace- the space was perfectly set up when we arrived and accommodating of our late arrival time. "
1279660,33572360,2015-05-30,28861509,Julia,"We felt very welcome in this little urban cottage! It appeared just as the listing and photographs described - tidy, cheerful, and tastefully decorated, with cozy touches of ""home"" (simple things like a mini fridge, Keurig coffee maker, and toiletries available for use in the bathroom).

We interacted with Grace a little bit after our arrival - she was very sweet and made sure to let us know that we could contact her if we had any other needs that weren't yet provided for. 

It was the perfect place for our last night in Seattle, and just a quick car ride away from locations in downtown Seattle. 

The only ""negative"" thing I would note is that you are planning on a long stay in the studio cottage, you should note from the description that there is a not a kitchenette area. However, there is the convenience of the mini fridge, which would be great for breakfast foods. And let's be honest - who would want to cook in if they could eat out in Seattle? :)"
1279660,33676508,2015-05-31,13858513,Peter,"Comfortable, clean, private accommodations in a hip and happening neighborhood.  I had an event at the University of Washington.  Both it and downtown are convenient from this location if you have a car.  Thanks to Grace for her attention to the small details that made it a home away from home."
1279660,33904336,2015-06-02,11358010,Lauren,"Our stay at Grace's place was really nice.  It's a great neighborhood, quiet and clean.  Would definitely recommend - thanks!"
1279660,34128869,2015-06-05,27506338,Anna & Tyler,"Grace was a great host. We got into Seattle early in the day and she gave us a place to store our bags so we wouldn't have to carry them around with us all day. She was very accommodating and friendly! The place was clean, quiet, and served all of our purposes. The neighborhood had multiple bus stops and google maps made public transportation very accessible and easy. Between that and Car2Go, my husband and I had no trouble getting around!"
1279660,34624150,2015-06-10,16597532,Greg,Grace made us feel right at home on our very first visit to Seattle. This quaint cottage met all our needs and was centrally located to all our adventures.
1279660,34777653,2015-06-12,79605,Rachel And Graig,"Grace's cottage was the perfect place for our stay.  A quick walk to the main street of Fremont, cosy and cute.   Grace was very friendly and the cottage was a perfect Seattle retreat.  I would love to stay with Grace the next time I'm in Seattle!"
1279660,35449764,2015-06-19,4265916,Felicia,The cottage was really homey and cozy. Grace made things comfortable for us and was quick to reply our messages. The coffee maker was a nice touch :) The cottage was a quick bus ride away from the city. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in the neighborhood - it was really green with blooming flowers everywhere! 
1279660,35773353,2015-06-22,160461,Ted,Great listing and host. The studio was beautifully decorated and very tidy. Grace was a great communicator - responding to questions within a few hours. Plus 100 points for a great mattress! Highly recommended. 
1279660,36039743,2015-06-24,34858967,Tyler,"Our experience was perfect. The cottage was in a great area, super private and clean, and we were able to come and go as we pleased. I highly recommend the cottage for anyone looking for a great place in Seattle. "
1279660,36263661,2015-06-27,28171809,Steven Patrick,It was a wonderful place and the distribution in the Internet was exactly like it was when we arrived. Everything was very nice and we had a good time.
1279660,36411528,2015-06-28,11624989,Anna,Graces place is perfect for a night or two in Freemont! The bed is beyond comfortable and its within walking distance to any Freemont restaurants or shops.  Perfect hotel alternative!  And the parking included is a huge bonus!  Would stay here again for sure!!
1279660,36660578,2015-06-30,16386416,Meghann,"We didn't ever meet Grace but the cottage is exactly as pictured.  Very clean, cozy, and tidy and perfect as a crash pad in this super-walkable, cute neighborhood.  "
1279660,37035150,2015-07-04,2817439,Emily,"Grace's cottage was adorable! We especially loved that it was in Fremont with so much to do in walking distance. Also, the bed was very comfortable and Grace had everything we needed."
1279660,37304663,2015-07-06,25099829,Robert,"This was our first booking through Airbnb and we were very happy with our choice of accommodation. When travelling to the Pacific Northwest you usually worry about rain but it was a very hot weekend and the fan was on when we arrived. The cottage was clean and well appointed from the coffee maker, cream in the fridge to the current bus schedule and selection of books. We enjoyed the Freemont area but regret not bringing our bikes to enjoy the many developed bike trails. We would not hesitate to recommend staying at Grace's cottage for your trip to Seattle.

1279660,37448612,2015-07-07,1635411,Erica,This place was great! It was very cozy and a close walk to many bars and restaurants. Checkin was easy. The key was left for us in a lockbox. It was very clean and well decorated. We would definitely stay here again! 
1279660,37636740,2015-07-09,27333801,Cory,"We loved the cottage!! Very clean and had everything we needed. Great location near breweries, delicious restaurants, and public transportation. We enjoyed walking to many fantastic Fremont establishments. "
1279660,37850691,2015-07-11,936161,Amanda & Ernesto,"Grace's studio in Fremont was the perfect place for my fiancé and I to stay during our trip to Seattle. Can't beat the location, and the space itself was impeccable- clean, cozy, with all necessary amenities included. Highly recommended! "
1279660,38618164,2015-07-17,4624413,Lindsey,"Super cute place, and was exactly as described. Grace left detailed instructions. We would definitely stay here again! "
1279660,38975310,2015-07-20,23738352,Britni,"Loved this place, so cute and comfy.  Would definitely stay here again.  Fremont is a great place to start in exploring Seattle:)"
1279660,39473152,2015-07-24,16458408,Tine,"Great cottage and host! From the very beginning communication with Grace was extremely swift, easy and personal. The cottage itself was nicely decorated, spotless clean and all we could ever wish for. A supply of coffee and tea is provided to start your day, which is a nice touch. The location is prime and we spend most of our time in Seattle in Fremont and Ballard rather than downtown (which however is easy to reach by bus). We met Grace several times and she's a very nice and forthcoming person. We highly recommend this place and hope to be lucky enough to stay here again if we find ourselves in Seattle."
1279660,39743385,2015-07-26,31349099,Rebecca,"My husband and I had a wonderful stay at Grace's cottage. It was super cozy and a great place to relax from the hustle of the big city, yet only minutes away. Lots of great local spots within walking distance. "
1279660,40205524,2015-07-29,31760510,Susan,Our host made us feel very welcome. Having a private studio cottage was a plus. The cottage was immaculate and Molly was very friendly.
1279660,41060183,2015-08-04,11920022,Azalea,"Grace's place was the perfect little getaway that we needed! The location was close to so many things and the Fremont area was the best. Check in and check out was easy, Grace also provided little toiletries that came in handy. We felt safe and enjoyed every day there. We would definitely stay here again! "
1279660,41317410,2015-08-07,1615785,Susan,Easy entry to the property.  Communication before we arrived to make sure we knew where the property was and how to gain entry.  The space was exactly as advertised.  Feels like a very roomy hotel room in a fun neighborhood.  Parking is on the street.  We had no problem finding a parking space.  Only drawback was no air conditioning. We were there on an unusually warm day so the fan - while appreciated -was not quite enough.
1279660,42106586,2015-08-11,27645980,Mark,"This was a great spot for my wife and I, I think she fell in love with the spot as soon as she walked in. Once inside we noticed Grace had left an information sheet on everything we needed to know about staying in the cottage, which was very helpful. The pictures really were spot on as well, in capturing the feel of the cottage. The one thing we were hesitant on was the no A/C component, with us coming from Texas we thought we absolutely needed it. However, this was not the case. We slept great with the windows open and had no issues. Also, the bed being super comfy helped out a lot as well.

As far as the neighborhood, it was pretty nice and we were within walking distance to several coffee shops and restaurants which was a huge plus. Also, we were not far away from other cool areas like Queen Anne and Belltown which were right across the way and very convenient.

The location and cottage were Perfect for our first time in Seattle. We would definitely recommend this charming cottage to anyone looking for a great stay and great experience in Seattle.
"
1279660,42251241,2015-08-12,8595260,Briana,Grace's cottage was perfect. My husband and I really enjoyed the location. We felt right at home and would love to return in the future. What a perfect introduction to Seattle. 
1279660,42512994,2015-08-14,1608058,Erin,"Grace is so sweet
And her air b n b is just perfect !
Terrific style in the place clean cozy charming and in a great location too 

She was helpful with helping us store our luggage and any questions we had and was happy to have us enjoy the premises outside as well 
We will for sure stay again just great !"
1279660,43040907,2015-08-17,34061784,Katharine,"We spent our wedding night in Grace's sweet little cottage. Nice amount of space, beautiful hardwoods and skylights, comfy bed. We walked up to lighthouse coffee in the morning for a great latte (and killer view coming back down the hill). Would absolutely recommend. Thanks Grace!"
1279660,43353816,2015-08-19,5370337,Evelyn,"The cottage was exactly as described and very, very clean. We enjoyed its peace at the end of a long day. The driveway is, as Grace notes, short and narrow, but it was handy to have it. I also enjoyed the lawn chairs provided for a quiet coffee on the patio in the morning."
1279660,43512981,2015-08-20,38091723,Katie,"This was the perfect place! Quaint, peaceful, and close to the city.  We came in late and had no trouble finding the cottage or the key.  Grace has decorated the cottage so thoughtfully and has included anything you might need during your stay. We were surprised at how quiet the neighborhood was- very much appreciated! Would highly recommend this place and we would definitely return! "
1279660,43748513,2015-08-22,7964036,Kathleen,"This guest house was perfect for our trip: clean, warm, welcoming, and in a super fun area!"
1279660,44879888,2015-08-30,25203177,Christina,Graces studio cottage was a cute and quaint little place for us! It's perfect for those who are on the go and barely at their home away from home. It was very clean and the bed was incredibly comfortable. It's in a perfect neighborhood to walk to coffee and shops and restaurants. We'll definitely come back for sure!
1279660,45376855,2015-09-02,592177,Emi,This place is beautiful and in a very fun neighborhood! Grace was a delightful host and a great communicator (with excellent taste in decor). Would definitely stay here again when in Seattle.
1279660,45654607,2015-09-05,31827080,Ashley,"We loved our stay at Graces place! It's just like the pictures and description, clean, cute and close to everything! We felt very safe in the neighborhood.  We really liked the Fremont area and went to Revel for dinner one night and Brouwer's the night before like Grace recommend...very good. Very close to walk to as well. 
Grace was out of town during our stay but made sure we had everything we needed and a contact if we needed anything! It was very easy to communicate with Grace and an easy process overall! 
 She let us park in the driveway right in front of the place and there was street parking also. 
We will be recommending Graces place to friends that might visit and would love to stay again if we are back in he area! :-) thank you Grace 
"
1279660,46112521,2015-09-08,14082046,Alayna,Super cute cabin in a very convenient location. Communication with host was great. Cabin was very clean and cozy. 
1279660,46708266,2015-09-13,26921968,Luis,Amazing place to spend all time that you need in Seattle. 100% Recomended
1279660,47025755,2015-09-15,15485802,Gary,"The place is nice and clean and GREAT location. Directions and instructions for entry clear and simple. 

Three things might frustrate some people: 
1 - The description is not accurate that this is a ""real bed"". There is no mattress. This is futon. (Hard and lumpy). Just in a nice frame. 
2- The place has HUGE skylights with no way to close them off. If you are light sensitive, you will be up at dawn. 
3 - The wifi exists, but the signal is too weak to receive (using an iphone 5) so it keeps dropping. With no TV in the place, this is an issue. Even in the bathroom, closest to the house, could not get 2 bars signal... only outside on their porch. "
1279660,47246634,2015-09-17,35004034,Matthew,Warm and friendly. We loved the space and all the small personal touches. Super cozy!!
1279660,47352358,2015-09-18,15131731,Steven,"Grace made us feel very welcome. The cottage was adorable, very clean, and well organized. The neighborhood was very fun, many food options within walking distance."
1279660,47967815,2015-09-22,3275415,Robert,"Grace was a great host!  Friendly with easy communication.  She made some great recommendations for local food, too.  Fremont is a cool place to stay with easy access to food/shops/bus.

Overall, it's a simple space and exactly as described.  Not huge, but bright, clean, and furnished nicely.  Gas fireplace is a neat bonus."
1279660,48072766,2015-09-23,32186651,Jamie,"Staying at the cottage was one of the best parts of our time in Seattle. The place was exactly as it was listed-- pictures were very accurate, and the room was (surprisingly, pleasantly) spacious. Grace left us a very specific list with directions for how to make ourselves at home at the cottage, as well as book guides for downtown Seattle. The neighborhood is cute and cozy. We loved our time at the cottage!"
1279660,48179591,2015-09-24,28007250,Brittney,"Grace was an excellent host! Very communicative and remembered all of the details we might need during our stay! 

The cottage was AWESOME! We only stayed one night, but I found myself thinking the next day that I wished we were going back there to sleep again rather than my own house. The neighborhood was quiet but right in between my two favorites, Ballard and Fremont! 

I would stay here all the time and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a city getaway. "
1279660,49109292,2015-10-01,18596622,Sarah,Loved this listing. Perfect location for anything in Seattle...10 minutes from basically anything tourist - related. Would love to stay again if we find ourselves back in Seattle.
1279660,49237467,2015-10-02,751594,Brett,"Grace's places is extremely cozy and clean.  It has a Keurig coffee maker, and the bathroom is full of everything you might need.  It's also a very short walk from a fun strip of bars and restaurants in the Fremont neighborhood.  Would definitely stay again."
1279660,49598609,2015-10-05,37914042,Riki,"The cottage was exactly as listed and described - perfectly cute and homey!  Grace was an excellent host; as our first Airbnb experience, she was communicative to make the entire experience a breeze, but had utmost respect for our privacy during our stay. She accommodated our friends that left us a surprise welcome gift and she has FANTASTIC recommendations for local coffee! We couldn't have special-ordered  a better location - quiet neighborhood and walking distance to great Fremont spots!"
1279660,49889153,2015-10-07,19803391,Kathy,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed the peace and solitude of this cottage.  Comfy bed, yummy coffees and a lovely host made for an exceptional trip to Seattle.  Plenty of eateries and coffee shops just a couple of blocks away were a plus.  Would stay here again.  Thank you, Grace, for sharing your cottage with us.  Kathy and Katie"
1279660,50002896,2015-10-08,18069072,Candice,"Grace's cottage was hands down one of the best experiences I've had with air bnb! Her attention to detail is what did it for me, she has everything you could possibly need to make you feel at home. The cottage got warm very quickly during the night when it was colder, and she was very responsive and kept in great contact with me. Her spot was a quick bus ride and an even quicker drive to areas like Capitol Hill and downtown. I will definitely try to stay here next time I'm in Seattle! "
1279660,50099689,2015-10-09,43709115,Shawn,Grace left us a little note when we arrived to describe the ins and outs.  She also texted with us for a bit to confirm our arrival.  The place was spotless and felt very welcoming!  Next time we're in the Fremont area we'll be staying here again!
1279660,50236085,2015-10-10,8993015,Rylan,"Lovely space,  professional and warm host.  Great attention to detail shown in every aspect. 

Fun neighborhood for evening cruising.  

Highly recommended. "
1279660,50627238,2015-10-13,7508470,Chip,"Exactly as described!  We loved the ""urban cottage"".  The neighborhood was great and we did a lot of ""urban hiking"", including walking back to the cottage from downtown (about 3 miles).  We used all public transportation and especially enjoyed a Sunday morning hike at Discovery Park which we reached by bus (32 bus to Dravus and short walk to 33 bus on 22nd street).
We loved the Lighthouse Roasters coffee near the cottage.  Had a great sushi dinner at Chiso a short walk away.  Also enjoyed Pho at Lucky's Pho nearby. 
The cottage itself was clean and comfortable.  We had everything we needed. We had great communication from Grace and easy access in/out without ever meeting her. (Our paths never crossed)  
Definitely recommend a stay. "
1279660,51022614,2015-10-17,19985076,Adam,The cottage was perfect for my stay in Fremont. Very walkable area and a beautiful neighborhood! I got to chat with Grace for a bit and she was super friendly. Highly recommended! 
1279660,51570689,2015-10-21,24977786,Whitney,"This cottage is so cute! It is a great place to rejuvenate after traveling for awhile. I loved the garden that lead us to the cottage.

Highlights:
-Parking
-Fremont is an incredible neighborhood where you can access breweries, great food, eclectic cafes and two arcades;
- The cottage is a great place to rest your head for a bit. It is big enough for two people;
-The host stocked the bathroom with towels, wash clothes, shampoos, soaps and lotions;
-Fantastic lighting including two sky lights.

I recommend this place to all!"

Grace's advice and recommendations in the guidebook really completed our trip, and we would love the chance to visit again.  "

We loved that it was walking distance to almost everything Fremont has to offer. If we ever come back, we will definitely be staying here again! She was also so sweet to answering any questions we might have. Thanks so much! "

1279660,53895594,2015-11-14,16682964,Allison,"Grace's Cottage was perfect! We arrived after 2pm and easily retrieved the key from the lockbox outside the front door. We had a rental car so she allowed us to park in the driveway. Who knew Seattle had such steep hilly roads! The inside of the cottage was exactly as the pictures showed. So cute and cozy! Grace provided us a little welcome note and some good to know things about the cottage. By the way, the location is perfect walking distance to all the bars and restaurants! Fremont is such a neat area.  I honestly wouldn't have wanted to stay anywhere else. We really enjoyed it!"
1279660,54846648,2015-11-25,34785943,Patrick,"Absolutely AMAZING!  This was our first time using Airbnb and had no idea what to expect.  This cottage FAR EXCEEDED our hopes.  The listing was spot on, pics and text.  It was very cute, very cozy, very inviting and the bed was incredibly comfortable.  I usually have difficulty sleeping when I travel but we both slept so soundly.  The neighborhood was quiet and close to everything.  We could walk or take a very short drive to everything we wanted to see and do (Pike Place, Century Link Field, Seattle Center, EMP, Chihuly, etc).  Plus, we visited some of Grace's recommendations as well and found some absolute gems we cant wait to visit again!  And Grace was very proactive in her communication with us.  We will definitely be coming back to this location!"
1279660,55190376,2015-11-29,31654343,David,"Very nice, clean and tidy cottage.  Easy access to Fremont restaurants and shops as well as the #5 bus and other transit.  Would recommend and likely will stay again."

1279660,55669094,2015-12-04,18065547,Olivia,Grace has such a spectacular little cottage! We couldn't have asked for more from our stay. Her space is cozy and beautiful and has the most thoughtful amenities. It's the perfect spot to come home to after a long day out exploring Seattle. Highly recommended!
1279660,55726082,2015-12-05,7700104,Lucy,"Everything was exactly right for my short stay. It's about the size of a hotel room with separate shower/toilet room but it feels like an updated Vermont cottage. Perfect for one or two people. The cottage is detached from the main house so it's very private. It's a very cute and clean space. I especially love the flame heat from the gas stove and the comfortable bed and blankets - all added up to a very cozy sleep. Wifi connection and cell phone reception was great, too. Great Fremont neighborhood location. Parking space was suitable for my economy sized rental car. I hope to stay here again the next time I'm in Seattle."
1279660,56056064,2015-12-08,20859814,Robin,Grace's cottage was perfect!  Just as described the location couldn't be better.  Everything you need within a short walk.  The fireplace was definitely a highlight!

Grace was very communicative over email and phone which was very helpful as I arrived to the cottage later in the evening, but when I did arrive everything was set up and ready for me, cozy as can be!  The cottage is in a great location in Fremont and everything was superb. "
1279660,56275210,2015-12-11,647613,Brad,Great location.
1279660,56498978,2015-12-14,2961958,Marisa And Denise,Grace's place is excellent. It was cozy and the propane heater did the trick. We loved the skylights and the design. The best was comfortable and the provided coffee much appreciated! Thanks Grace! We would definitely stay here again.
1279660,56930562,2015-12-20,10783113,Alex,The cottage was easy to get to and wonderfully cozy! It also happens to be located in my favorite Seattle area.
2418658,10699461,2014-03-03,9387468,Devin,"Rebecca's apartment made for a stylish, comfortable home base during my weekend in Seattle. Check in/out was easy even though I wanted to check in early on Friday. The location could not be better. Downtown and the Convention Center are within walking distance, as are the restaurants, shops, bars, and parks of Capitol Hill. The building is a classic and Rebecca's place is tastefully decorated with vintage art and furniture. I loved coming home here!"
2418658,10870214,2014-03-10,10785456,Amy,"Rebecca's place was great- easily accessible, clean, comfortable, and just an overall awesome place to stay.  Getting keys was easy, Rebecca was nice enough to suggest restaurants in the area, and she was flexible and a clear and friendly communicator.  I would absolutely stay here again and would highly recommend it to others!   "
2418658,11098840,2014-03-20,11789270,Chelsey,"Rebecca's apartment was fantastic! The location was perfect - Starbucks right across the street, a ton of bus routes close by, and lots of restaurants, cafes, and shops less than a five minute walk away. The apartment was the perfect size for 1-2 people and we felt very comfortable there. If you're thinking about watching her cats, do it! They are both very sweet and easy to care for. My boyfriend, who's not a cat person, fell in love with both of them on the first day. Rebecca was a fantastic host too. She always responded immediately to emails and made sure we had everything we needed. I would 100% recommend staying here. Capitol Hill is a great neighborhood and Rebecca's apartment is the perfect place to experience it."
2418658,11192363,2014-03-24,12885190,Jacob,"I spent a long weekend here and it was lovely! Rebecca's place is in a great location to get to all kinds of things, and it's surrounded by tons of fantastic places to eat or grab a drink. Great views out of the windows!"
2418658,11311091,2014-03-29,2342703,Jess,"Rebecca's place is lovely. Very charming, comfortable, and quiet. I wanted to take the pillows home with me. Rebecca was very communicative and friendly. Check in and out were a breeze. Great location. Lots of good food nearby. Be sure to go to Le Bete and the Monday night Mexican dinner at Sitka & Spruce. "
2418658,11619868,2014-04-09,6768898,Julian,"We stayed in Rebecca's place for a week and really loved it there. The location is perfect, with lots of nice cafés and restaurants just around the corner. The apartment is beautifully decorated. I would come back there anytime. "
2418658,11847832,2014-04-16,8167343,Amanda,"Rebecca's apartment is lovely and the night I was there I was treated to a beautiful sunset view. She was super easy to communicate with before and after my trip; and during the time I was there and she was camping she had me in touch with a neighbor who helpful and easy to reach. I chose the ""with cats"" option and recommend it if you'll be missing your own cats while you travel and want the company.  "
2418658,12342968,2014-04-29,2125771,Chris,"Just lovely. Rebecca's place was just what I needed for a vacation in Seattle: comfortable, quiet, super convenient and charming. Rebecca has killer taste and if you find yourself spending an afternoon or evening in (not out of the question on a rainy night), you are in for a treat—the mood of the place is really something. Rebecca herself is sweet natured and communicative. "
2418658,12704935,2014-05-08,6888856,Derrek,"rustic relaxation in a classic apartment building. perfect for chefs, couples, thrift store junkies. lovely. "
2418658,12939699,2014-05-14,12192491,Dan,Rebecca is fast to respond and the place is very charming.  
2418658,13219126,2014-05-22,5419781,Laura,"Rebecca was very welcoming and flexible as I planned my stay with her: she arranged to let me use her neighbor's WiFi and she left plenty of good coffee, tea and fresh 1/2 & 1/2.  We had a little snafu with the keys when I arrived but she was very responsive and the issue was fixed quickly. 

It's a lovely apartment: bright light, very comfortable bed, plenty of hot water. The neighborhood is fabulous: lots of restaurants and coffee shops and it was less than a 10-minute walk down to the convention center. 

I wasn't able to get on the WiFi for most of my stay, and while this was a bummer, Rebecca did everything she could to troubleshoot the issue and she even left me a gift card for Starbucks when I ended up going there to connect (it's right across the street).   "
2418658,13493196,2014-05-28,15740660,Lacey,"My husband and I came to town for a wedding we only stayed one night at Rebecca's but loved it:) the building is absolutely charming I loved all the vintage charm everyone we saw was friendly and welcoming it was the perfect end to our stay in Seattle. We also had the cats stay who's personalities were comical they are very inquisitive loving and personable. We have dogs  and my husband has always said he's not very fond of cats but for one night it would be fine, well they became fast friends and cheep entertainment for me;) stopped in at glos coffee shop for breakfast and it was delicious great shops in the area will have to come stay again with more time to look at them all. "
2418658,13686608,2014-06-02,5138327,Danielle,Rebecca was incredibly easy to coordinate with.  Her apartment is great and just as she describes.  The location is perfect and there are a lot of nice cafes and bars in walking distance.  
2418658,13968056,2014-06-09,15065689,Meagan,"I stayed a total of 3 nights at Rebecca's apartment. I had an early arrival time and a late departure time; she was able to accommodate both. I never met her in person but she left very detailed instructions that were extremely helpful. The apartment has an amazing view of Capitol Hill. It is fairly small but I never once felt cramped, it was very cozy. The apartment building is beautiful as well.

I chose the option to watch her cats and I'm so glad I did. Lonnie and Peanut are the best. They are soo entertaining and friendly. 

This was my first time using airbnb and it could not have gone any better. Thanks Rebecca!"
2418658,14234064,2014-06-15,15197268,Erin,We had a fabulous time in Seattle. Sharing the space with the cats was greatly entertaining and helped us not miss our own as much. The place was as described and Rebecca left straightforward instructions for us and was easy to contact if needed. The building and neighbourhood is fantastic and we were able to walk to most places we wanted to visit.
2418658,14473806,2014-06-20,7095517,Joan,"Rebecca extremely helpful and prompt with replies to questions.    The flat was charming, with good light from the windows, and airy views.    We absolutely loved the neighbourhood - short walk to interesting area and lovely economical places to eat.   Local shops (3 within 2 mins) are great for the basics and friendly people.   We had a great time. "
2418658,14786065,2014-06-26,2443100,Dominik,"Rebecca's apartment is great and it is in a perfect location to explore Seattle. We have never met Rebecca, but she was very quick in responding to our emails during our stay - and even around to bring some stuff to the flat that we needed. Unfortunately, we did not notice before that the flat does not offer Internet, but Starbucks is just around the corner :) We also enjoyed Lonnie and Peanut, Rebecca's two cats, which are very friendly and easy to take care of. During the night, they share the bed with you. We can definitely recommend Rebecca's place when you are about to explore Seattle."
2418658,14894007,2014-06-28,4078629,Ieva,"Perfect location, beautiful vintage furniture and if you like listening to records, you will appreciate the record player and her record collection. Rebecca was quick to respond to our messages and made the check in and out very easy. We stayed for 2 nights and chose to look after the cats that was fun. They both are very affectionate and sweet, however, they did wake us up at 5am every morning asking for food. Apart from that, it was a very pleasant stay. "
2418658,15101032,2014-07-02,15783337,Jennifer,"What a great place! Loved the vintage decor and the cool old features of the building. The neighbourhood was great, lots of good food and some shops close by. Rebecca left a detailed map and suggested some of her favourite places. (I highly recommend coffee and breakfast at Arabica just around the corner- delish!) Also, a fairly quick walk to downtown. 

We opted to have the cats around and totally fell in love with them! Watch out for Peanut's crazy shower-curtain-attacks when you're sitting on the toilet though ;) Lonnie is a big snuggler... I miss him!

Note: Rebecca doesn't have wifi (which is mentioned in her ad, but I overlooked it), but Starbucks is right next door with free wifi. 

I would definitely stay here again, and will recommend it to friends. Thanks Rebecca!!!"

2418658,15417161,2014-07-08,1714423,Mark,Rebecca was always quick to respond and very friendly. She also provides awesome recommendations for the neighborhood. 
2418658,15497251,2014-07-10,2381773,Rachel,"Rebecca's apartment is pure magic - with a lovingly curated vintage vibe within and gorgeous views over Seattle beyond. It was also close to lots of cute restaurants and cafés. Had a great time! Rebecca was super flexible and let us check in earlier too, so massive thanks for that!"
2418658,15768302,2014-07-15,12868304,Kaitlin,"Rebecca was a great host. She left specific details about her cats and how to take care of them (which is an easy job), as well as specific information about her favorite places in the neighborhood (we loved Melrose Market and Stumbling Monk the most!). Capitol Hill is just as she described: progressive, artistic, vibrant. There are a ton of places to eat and have drinks just steps away from her apartment, but we also easily walked downtown to Pikes Market, Pioneer Square, and Belltown. 

If you choose to take care of her cats, they are very sweet cats. They will come sleep with you, even if it is a warm night :) They did wake us up pretty early in the morning to eat, but once they are fed they settle back down. The kitten Peanut, is especially playful, so be ready for an energetic pet!

I recommend Rebecca's apartment, especially if you want to experience life in this very unique neighborhood!"
2418658,15891759,2014-07-17,17820305,Brandi,"A+ ! Great interior vibe, with a great attention to detail in providing a neighborhood map & suggested visits. The kitties do rise early, but they are sweet so it's all good. :) "
2418658,16043832,2014-07-20,7450524,Sarah,"The host was super responsive ahead of time and great about checking in; the apartment was beautifully decorated, and Rebecca had left little instructional notes everywhere. Plus the cats were fun (although quite rambunctious into the late hours, maybe a problem for some) - of course there is also the option not to take care of the cats if this is a concern for you. Overall great stay!"
2418658,16083719,2014-07-22,14365182,Sean,"We were really excited to stay at Rebecca's apartment but ended up going out to Bremerton that evening to stay with some family. Rebecca was quick to respond to messages and was even going to pay us to feed her cats.
Maybe we can stay at her place the next time we pass through Seattle. "
2418658,16145879,2014-07-22,215075,Anastasia,"Rebecca's apartment was in a perfect location . I was able to walk from the downtown light rail right to her door. It was also close to some really great cafes. 
The space itself is nicely designed and feels spacious. The views are lovely as well. 
She was always reachable and was nice enough to be flexible with my check-in time. I will definitely stay here again. "
2418658,16467170,2014-07-28,14180574,Nathanael,"We loved this place! Rebecca had a map of all the best ""local"" spots, ranging from coffee to food to the atmosphere of the local bars. The house was as advertised, great views and exactly what we expected. Will be using this place again on our next adventure. Thank you, Rebecca!"
2418658,16790103,2014-08-02,3372059,Nicole,"Rebecca was very communicative and left specific instructions for how to use everything. The apartment was airy, comfortable, and quiet. The neighborhood had loads of coffee shops, bars, and markets. Tuning into the radio rather than TV and WiFi was actually a nice respite. A good base in the heart of Seattle."
2418658,16964814,2014-08-04,1497847,Christina,"Rebecca was friendly, responsive, and a lovely host. Her apartment's described well in the listing – and is very nice! – and we found the location quite good too. If you're looking for a temporary home in Seattle, I'd recommend her Capitol Hill apartment."
2418658,17050314,2014-08-06,14245049,Paul,"Great location, adorable cats, awesome coffee. Beautiful plants everywhere. Awesome attention to decoration detail. Old building. Cool neighborhood."
2418658,17484234,2014-08-12,1155651,Wei,"This is a very stylish apartment. We love it! Rebecca is a very accommodating host and leave us detailed house instructions/local guide (also very stylish, hand-written with hand-drawn map). Very easy check-in and check-out. The house also has a record player and a good collection of records. Prime location in Capital Hill. "
2418658,17605086,2014-08-14,19805016,Elizabeth,Great location. Vibrant neighborhood on a late Tuesday night. Good value. 
2418658,18071707,2014-08-21,18570499,Claudia,"Rebecca's place was beautifully decorated, very comfortable, and had an amazing view of the city. It was in an ideal location and her hand drawn map with suggestions made our stay in seattle so great. I would love to stay there again!"
2418658,18206303,2014-08-23,8677761,Steve,"We had a nice night in Rebecca's place. It's a fantastic location, and the sixth floor views from up on the hill are very nice. The apartment felt very comfortable, Rebecca was very responsive to communication... it was all good!

We agreed to take care of Rebecca's two cats. They were sweet little guys, but we followed the feeding instructions and it left them very rambunctious. Like, waking us up at 5:30 AM type of rambunctious. We fed them one can of food the evening we arrived (around 6pm) but clearly they weren't satisfied by that. We didn't want to overfeed them, but probably just should have as they quieted right back down when we gave them their second feeding at the crack of dawn. We were able to get back to sleep after that... but consider how much babysitting you want to do if you agreed to help with the cats. They were more of a handful than we were expecting.

Great place and great host though! Thanks again Rebecca for having us!"
2418658,18277682,2014-08-24,19897405,Liisa,Nice apartment in the perfect location for my husband and I on a quick trip. Everything we needed was within walking distance. Rebecca was a great host too. We chose to watch the cats and they were a bonus.
2418658,18596567,2014-08-28,10089256,Gennadiy,"Great neighborhood, beautiful brick building, vintage elevators. Fresh towels, clean sheets and single use toiletries were waiting for us upon arrival. If you choose to take care of the cats - they are very friendly, had no problems with them. There's no wi-fi in the apartment and sadly all neighbors have their wi-fis password protected :) There's a Starbucks across the street with a free wi-fi though."
2418658,19290459,2014-09-09,8961810,Julie,"Rebecca lives in a beautiful building in Capital Hill.  I appreciated how easy she made it to check in - she left lots of handy information about her apartment, parking in the area, and recommendations for restaurants.  "
2418658,19353154,2014-09-10,21017216,Evan,"Rebecca was such a great host! I felt welcome immediately and she left out a little hand drawn map of the areas with points of interest. Her place is clean, beautiful, and the location is very ideal when coming to Seattle. It's exactly as described, very comfortable, and I enjoyed the lack of internet and TV. If you're on vacation and don't need these amenities for work, then I highly recommend her place! Her cats are very sweet (and a little rambunctious) and the record player adds a charm to the stay, giving an old world feeling that I really liked. Thank you for letting me stay at such an awesome place! Next time I'm in Seattle, I will stay here again!"
2418658,19390939,2014-09-11,43660,Gwen,"Rebecca worked hard to make sure the logistics work out perfectly.
The room is perfectly located, and is clean and welcoming. It looks just like in the photo. Rebecca left very useful notes including various shops and restaurants in the area. Leaving spare iPhone charging cables was a great touch. It saved my day, really.
The cats are super sweet, too.

Highly recommended."
2418658,19977914,2014-09-21,21265832,Christine,Super cute apartment in a great neighborhood.  Check in was easy and Rebecca left a fantastic hand drawn map with neighborhood recommendations.  We watched her kitties and they were so much fun-both of them are super sweet and snuggly.  I highly recommend Rebecca's place!
2418658,20062808,2014-09-22,565042,David,"The apartment was as advertised, located centrally within the great Capitol Hill neighborhood. Rebecca was a wonderful host and super responsive leaving very detailed instructions on the apartment and suggestions for the surrounding area. Would happily stay again! :)"
2418658,20106828,2014-09-23,11215628,Lyndsey,"Rebecca was responsive with answering our questions during booking and left a welcome note and a great little map with recommendations of places to check out in the area. She was also generous enough to offer us a discount even though her cats were staying elsewhere since we'd agreed to care for them. Rebecca left sets of clean towels for my husband and I and there was nice shampoo and conditioner in the shower. She also provided creamer for coffee. The decor was artistic and eclectic.

However, our stay wasn't a very pleasant one. The apartment wasn't clean and we felt more like we were crashing at a friends place than paying to stay at a nice apartment that had been prepared for our stay.

Also, I love animals, but be prepared that you can tell that cats live here even if there's not around. Aroma and cat hair on the shelves and sofa give it away. There was a nice scented candle on the table that Rebecca lit before we came back to the apartment which was helpful.

We were also disappointed that the room wasn't ready upon arrival around 7:30pm, even though we'd communicated we were coming in from a long flight from Iceland and given an estimate for our arrival early on when asked. So we got to meet Rebecca and her boyfriend while they were putting on clean sheets. They were extremely nice, but this apartment would need to be taken up a notch before we'd return."
2418658,20220329,2014-09-25,1356945,Anik,"Rebecca's apartment was centrally located and hospitably appointed. She left a series of helpful notes about the apartment and the neighborhood, all in handwriting that has to be seen to be believed."
2418658,20323249,2014-09-27,21652717,Story,What a nice experience. Rebecca' has a wonderfully designed space in a very convenient part of town. I couldn't have been more pleased!
2418658,20440394,2014-09-29,3928848,Sarah Beth,"We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Rebecca's studio.  It's a rad, old building.  The apartment has great light, and cool views.  We loved walking around the neighborhood.  Rebecca was a great host.  I would highly recommend her place!"
2418658,21313247,2014-10-14,21987592,Shannon,"Great little apartment in a really cool little area of town.   Rebecca was an excellent host, her map and local advice were super helpful, and she went above and beyond helping me plan a running route close to home.  We had a little confusion with the key drop off which she handled very well and in a timely manner.  We would definitely stay again.   "
2418658,23207742,2014-11-25,9181077,Huy,"Rebecca was an amazing host.  She was always super responsive, checking in and getting the keys was a breeze and the same goes for checking out.  Her apartment is in an ideal location, you really can't ask for more.  Lots of great coffee shops nearby, places to eat, and bars to hang out after a long day of work/site seeing but its far enough from the main street so her place is very quite.  I would recommend her place to anyone!"
2418658,23333266,2014-11-29,10172739,Michael,"Rebecca was super helpful in our check in and everything went well overall. This apartment is in a classic old Seattle building. We lived in Seattle for years and are very familiar with this kind of property. If you are not familiar I would warn you the building is dated, musty, peeling wallpaper, soiled carpet etc. The apartment itself has simple vintage furniture that has some definite wear and tear. Apartment had some similar old building issues. Broken tile in the bathroom, old windows that don't quite close all the way, etc... For us it was exactly what we were looking for. Location is the greatest, allows pets, and reminded us of our apartment when we lived in Seattle."
2418658,23482913,2014-12-01,3882132,Emre,"We didn't have the chance to meet Rebecca in-person, but she was very sweet and helpful.
The apartment has a prime location and it was cozy. We checked in and out very easily. Rebecca was very flexible for the checkout time which also helped us a lot.
There has been only one thing that we didn't like, which is the cleanness of the apartment on the first day. As Rebecca explained it was the previous guest's dog's hair all around the floor. She came by the next day and cleaned it up, but we already spent one night like that and that's the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5."
2418658,23876883,2014-12-13,19481511,Carissa,"Great location and a really cute apartment, looks exactly as promised with a great view! Rebecca was helpful and flexible with check in/out times, allowed me to stay an extra night when my plans changed. Only wish it had wifi!"
2418658,24013604,2014-12-16,7071950,Emilly,"Rebecca's place was adorable and charming beyond words.  The apartment building is legitimately out of a Wes Anderson film with pink floral wallpaper and a service elevator that'll take you back (before you were likely born.)  Her bed was comfy and she took the extra time to provide us with an assortment of refreshments in the fridge.  I didn't get a chance to meet her in person, but she was very responsive and helpful via text.  When I left behind some belongings, she promptly mailed them back to me.  Location is prime!  There are tons of little stores around the block, great cafes, and bars.  I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks Rebecca!"
2418658,24535152,2014-12-30,1185214,Hana,"Rebecca was very easy to communicate with, she was always a call or text away and answered all our questions promptly. We had no problems with the apartment, it is exactly pictured and what we wanted for our short stay in Seattle. The no wifi wasn't much of an issue either because the Starbucks was literally across the street. Great location, and nice quaint building. Absolutely would recommend and stay again.
"
2418658,25291359,2015-01-11,17784418,Crystal,"Extremely well located apartment with both downtown and Capitol Hill with in minuets walk.  Apartment very clean and tidy, well equipped and Rebecca was always quick to respond to any queries.  would definitely recommend to others and stay again.  "
2418658,25346281,2015-01-12,607636,Steve,"Rebecca made us feel very welcome. She let us into the apartment and showed us around. She left a great hand drawn map of cool spots in the area and was available by cell if we needed anything. The apartment was in a great location and worked great for our short visit.  The few downsides we had were more due to our rushed booking. The apartment didn't have wifi which was a bummer but it didn't hinder our visit too much. We enjoyed the record player instead and all was well.

"
2418658,25448499,2015-01-16,25614256,Scott,"We loved our stay at Rebecca's apartment. It was cozy and felt like home. The pictures give a good idea of what the place looks like. The neighborhood was perfect--lots of interesting bars and restaurants and a close walk to great places in Seattle. Rebecca was attentive and helpful in giving us city pointers. If you are watching her cats, make sure you love cats! "
2418658,25640900,2015-01-21,25804736,Conor,"Rebecca's studio is located in a great location within Capitol Hlil.  The neighbors in the building were super friendly.  The studio itself was a great rustic getaway that provided a perfect launching point to explore the city and its surroundings. We had the pleasure of earning the likes of Peanut and Lonnie Chan, Rebecca's cats, who were full of personality and a nice addition to the studio."
2418658,25764213,2015-01-25,8270296,Andrea,"Our host was fantastic! Rebecca was super attentive and helpful. She ended up going out of town and left us in the care of her friend Grace who was also amazing and super on top of all our communications. They asked if we wanted creamer for coffee which I said yes to but ended up just running out and grabbing coffee every morning. That was so sweet though! Rebecca also made a cute little map with attractions and everything. Also check in and check out were a breeze!

The pictures are very true to what the apartment is. For the price it was a great little landing pad right in the heart of Capital Hill and we enjoyed it! It had all the basics and is surrounded by a lot of great places to eat, shop, and whatnot. We hit up the Starbucks right across the street every morning. There is the BEST breakfast place across the other street (main busy st) from Starbucks too. I wish I could remember the name but it was so good! Check it out if you want an awesome breakfast!

We had the pleasure of having Peanut and Lonnie (the two kitties who live there) stay with us. They were a little crazy the first night with jumping on us a bit while we were sleeping, but by the next night they were totally fine and curled up with us. They are really sweet and Lonnie was such a cuddler. We loved them!

Overall I would stay here again. =)

 "
2418658,25909272,2015-01-29,9497634,Paula,"We had a great time at such a lovely apartment! The cats were nice but they can sometimes wake you up during the night. 
"
2418658,26136662,2015-02-04,26227483,Casey,Rebecca's apartment was perfect and comfortable for my stay in Seattle.  I enjoyed the location and they company of both her cats. Thank you! 
2418658,26314528,2015-02-09,25323192,Mandee,"Rebecca was great at communicating and making sure I had everything I needed. It was the perfect spot for a photoshoot, and loved how the images turned out! Cats were super sweet, I just wish I would have brought a little air freshener due to the litter box. She also warned me of the door knob, and even though I was pretty gentle it did come off. She was very apologetic, and I was totally understanding. "
2418658,26686365,2015-02-17,25221686,Rebecca,"Rebecca's apartment was a wonderful place to spend time at in Seattle. It's perfect if you're there by yourself or with a partner and is exactly as described. Not too big, not too small. The best part is you're within walking distance of everything. Pike Place is a 15-20 minute walk, a Starbucks is around the corner, great restaurants and bars are only a couple blocks away, and when you come back for the night you're in a quiet neighborhood. We only ended up taking a Sidecar twice while we were there! The kitchen is small, but easy to navigate and Rebecca set us up with provisions for coffee and tea, which was wonderful! We ended up having breakfast there everyday and cooking  a full gourmet meal one evening. The building is old and charming and despite being 7 floors is very quiet. And although it is an old building, the shower's water pressure and temperature is great. Plus Rebecca leaves nice shampoo, condition and soap for your stay. It's like a little bed and breakfast. It was a great place to stay while we explored Seattle!"
2418658,26837922,2015-02-20,3120838,Keith,"Rebecca's apt is a great place to stay for a visit to Seattle! Fantastic views, good location to downtown as well as the Capitol Hill bars, shops, and restaurants. Rebecca left a hand-drawn map of her personal faves, which was a nice touch. Her two cats, Lonnie and Peanut, are VERY friendly, so be prepared for some feline love and attention. Rebecca was away when I arrived so she coordinated key pick-up with her friend Grace who was very helpful as well."
2418658,26990872,2015-02-23,7573382,Lorenzo,"Rebecca's place is awesome! Really cool old building in a really nice area with a lot of neat stuff all around, she was very accommodating and her apt was perfect, lots of cool records and great views "
2418658,27226945,2015-02-28,23111778,Bas,"My stat in this very classic American appartement Building was a joy. The location is perfect in the most living area of Seattle, Capitol Hill. It was a convenient place, a bit hard to find parking for my car (although I parked it illegally at the next door Starbucks at night, and wasn't towed away :)) So thanks, good place."
2418658,27536137,2015-03-07,15267216,Nick,"Rebecca's place was excellent, just what we needed for our week in Seattle. Though Capitol Hill is filled with great restaurants, bars, and coffee, it also makes a great base for exploring other parts of the city as well. Moreover, Rebecca helped orient us with a map and lists of her favorite neighborhood spots. The kitchen is huge for a studio apartment and (with Rebecca's cookware) provided ample room for cooking on nights when we didn't feel like dining out."
2418658,27922416,2015-03-15,26123906,Matt,"Rebecca left a personalized note for us based on what she knew of our interests, and a map with different restaurants and stores she recommended within walking distance. She really had everything taken care of in advance, so we didn't need to ask much of her.

The apartment itself has a great view, is well decorated, and is located very close to bus stops that got us anywhere else we wanted to go in Seattle. The apartment building kind of looks like it could be in a Wes Anderson movie.

I really liked the neighborhood (Capitol Hill), too. There happened to be an art gallery walk while we there. There are lots of cool coffee shops and roasteries, bars, and restaurants in the area. There's at least one fringe theater nearby."
2418658,28776433,2015-03-30,2196317,Christopher,"The room and location are fantastic. Brilliant design sense and so peaceful up on the top floor, at the end of a hall. If you are looking for a place to explore capital hill and downtown this is a perfect launching point. I hope we can return."
2418658,28960401,2015-04-01,1451814,Fouad,"Great place, we really enjoyed our stay. The location is also perfect!"
2418658,29212814,2015-04-05,583738,Scott,"Great place. Rebecca was very warm and welcoming. Clear instructions, easy to find, easy to access, and very comfortable & calm  space. Would definitely stay again. "
2418658,30296108,2015-04-20,2608271,Lindsay,"Good location for walking to the sights, and Rebecca is a great host!"
2418658,30878387,2015-04-28,4211457,Khanh,"Rebecca was very responsive and accommodating. I was able to reach her every time we had a question or needed help, prior to and during our stay. She made sure to ask before our arrival if she could do anything to help us feel more welcome, and left us delicious coffee, some cream in the fridge, a really cute map of her favorite spots in the neighborhood, which we loved. Her apartment is really cute, well-situated, really comfortable, and is in a great neighborhood. We ran into intermittent issues with the elevator, but the stairs are not too bad and have got their own skylights!  

Overall I had a really fun weekend, and would definitely stay at Rebecca's again when I return to Seattle. 

"
2418658,31123025,2015-05-02,1499027,James,"The unit was exactly as advertised. Cool vintage furniture, comfortable bed and full bath/kitchen. Perfect location for those wanting to walk downtown/South Lake Union or stay in Capitol Hill. Typically I get units with TV and Internet but it was nice to come back to the studio, unplug and relax. Everything you could ever need is walking distance - great food, coffee, bars, shops etc"
2418658,31313178,2015-05-04,28865542,Bianca,"Rebecca's place is the perfect place to stay to explore Seattle! Right in the heart of Capital Hill, her apartment is exactly as advertised; very quaint and eclectic in decor. We were told that the elevator might have issues from time to time, but we did fine on it the whole weekend. The little notes she left for us upon arrival were a lovely touch, as was the map of her neighborhood. I can't say enough good things about the location of her studio. By the end of our trip, we had a running joke that everything was just a 10 minute walk, because it was so convenient to get everywhere. We did not rent a car and did not have an issue walking all over Capital Hill, First Hill, and even to Downtown. We would definitely stay here again, Thanks Rebecca!"
2418658,32153460,2015-05-14,18492801,Ned,"Super cute, hip old building. Awesome location in the heart of the gentle part of Capitol Hill and an easy walk to all of the crazy busy spots. Comfortable, cozy, clean, and very welcoming place. Rebecca is awesome."
2418658,32528271,2015-05-19,3444224,Nicole,"Rebecca's apartment was perfect for a weekend getaway in Seattle! Easy walking or a short Lyft/Uber to many attractions, tons of restaurants/bars nearby and an adorable space that was exactly as pictured. Rebecca was even kind enough to provide coffee/cream and soap/lotion during our stay. Great place!"
2418658,32877892,2015-05-23,25312207,Kimberly,"Rebecca was super accommodating for my stay. Check in time was flexible, she left a detailed list\map of local spots and the place was so perfect! Beautiful views and adorable space. It was my boyfriend and i and it was exactly what we were looking for in our trip to Seattle!"
2418658,33116342,2015-05-25,30985911,Katie,Rebecca made us feel right at home. Great location.
2418658,33769391,2015-06-01,10011390,Kate,Rebecca was AWESOME! She kept in touch when we needed her and was super fast on the reply. The home was everything the description said. We were very pleased with the place. Great views and an amazing neighborhood.
2418658,34243414,2015-06-06,32374827,Marcelo,"I had a great experience at Rebecca's place! Great location, many restaurants/bars around, super easy to walk to downtown area. The apartment was exactly as the photos on the site and in perfect conditions. Rebecca also provided some great tips on things to do around her place."
2418658,34389796,2015-06-07,2073947,Andy,"Rebecca was there to meet us when we got in and she gave us a very complete tour of the quirky vintage apartment. Everything in this apartment is an antique, and has a very charming appearance. The apartment has a very nice view and on a hot (I know, very unusual for Seattle) day, we got a very nice breeze in the apartment. The lounge chair is SO COMFY! The apartment is furnished with quite a few interesting books which made for great reading. 

Rebecca was very knowledgeable of the area and gave us hand drawn recommendations and maps to guide us in our stay. All her recommendations turned out to be winners! "
2418658,34809031,2015-06-12,1321603,Jordan,"Wonderful!!!!! What a stylish place, clean and furnished beautifully, with a beautiful view and comfortable bed. Fantastic location. The building also has tons of character. Thank you for a super stay, Rebecca! "
2418658,34907918,2015-06-13,34699658,Tony,My stay at Rebecca's was a great one. I fell in love with the apartment! The location is great. Rebecca provides great tips and and a list of her top picks around town. Overall it was an amazing experience!
2418658,35592527,2015-06-20,10058834,Gustavo,"Let me start by saying Rebecca was a great host, kept in contact, left instructions, notes, supplies, etc. 

It should be noted however, that this unit is an a massive, very old apartment building that isn't the cleanest or best smelling place. Additionally, the unit itself was much more run down than I had anticipated. The unit had very strong cat urine scent that was very unpleasant. The lack of wifi is also frustrating, mostly my fault for overlooking that detail before booking, but come on, in 2015 it's not really acceptable to not have wifi when obviously most people will be visiting and have relatively limited resources.

While the location of this building is convenient, for the price there were certainly better options. 

"
2418658,35887774,2015-06-22,4020349,Alex,"Rebecca was great, we ended up meeting in person and she totally made us feel welcome in her home. The location is really central for exploring Capitol Hill and the old building is charming."
2418658,36159600,2015-06-25,36525846,Lindsey,"Rebecca's place is seriously as charming as it looks in pictures! Even though I wasn't able to arrive until late in the evening, Rebecca kept in touch and made sure that her husband was able to meet me, drop off keys, and welcome me into the neighborhood. She also left a great little map that highlighted spots to eat, drink, and have a cup of coffee. I was able to walk downtown easily for work and would love to stay here again next time I'm in Seattle!"
2418658,36338125,2015-06-27,12689201,Sung,"What you see in the picture is exactly what you are getting. It's beautiful, retro place I'd love to rent again next time I'm in town. The neighborhood was great, too. Lots of eateries and bars, and not too far from the ocean."
2418658,36631660,2015-06-29,916956,Jens,"Rebecca made checking in completely painless. The space was cleaned and ready ahead of schedule, and her detailed instructions on how to navigate the building made the otherwise potentially confusing (it's an older building) process simple. Her apartment is cute, clean, stocked with travel necessities, has wonderful views, and is right in the center of Cap Hill, making everything easily accessible. She even left a hand-drawn map with suggestions for local eateries/bars/shops/attractions that the local tourist board should probably just buy from her and sell as a Seattle keepsake. I'd say the only drawback was a lack of a/c, but it's on older building, the windows are large, begging to be opened, and the ceiling fan provided plenty of airflow at night, when a cooler environ really counts. All in all, great place/experience, and Rebecca herself is very friendly/accommodating."
2418658,37113868,2015-07-04,4901305,Susan,"Rebecca's apartment in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle was the perfect location for us. It was within walking distance of terrific coffee shops, bakeries, shops and downtown.
It was so nice after a full day out to come back to such a peaceful home. Rebecca's quick responses during the booking process were also much appreciated.
We would love to stay again!"
2418658,37709319,2015-07-09,1006503,Matt,"Ideally located, great care and attention to detail, a deep embed experience on capitol hill, awesome host!"
2418658,38205210,2015-07-13,7976909,Andrew,"Very fun place in a fun part of town. Rebecca had a hand written note for us when we arrived - the personal touch was nice and very appreciated. Easy to get into her place with her directions. Neighborhood was centrally located in a hip part of town and a great jumping point for a lot of awesome sights and other neighborhoods around town. Would definitely recommend her place! Thanks, Rebecca!"
2418658,38444631,2015-07-15,2763464,Sara,"Rebecca left a ton of information about her neighborhood and how to get around to the rest of Seattle. Capitol Hill is a fun neighborhood that attracts a younger crowd, allowing a sense of knowing Seattle outside the touristy parts.

The walk into the heart of downtown is approximately one mile, and the return trip is mostly uphill. Skip the gym and get your workout hiking back up to this quiet building with historic charm and friendly, helpful neighbors. I feel like I got to experience the city more like a resident than a tourist, which really enhanced my enjoyment."
2418658,38578415,2015-07-17,25518626,Kristen,"Rebecca was great! She was easy to get ahold of, via email or text or phone call. This was my first time with Airbnb, so I had lots of questions.  She knew a lot about the neighborhood, parking and buses being my main concerns.  She asked multiple times if there was anything she could provide to make us more comfortable. I'm from a small town, so being in the middle of Seattle was so different, but really fun. Her apartment is in the best spot! So close to all Seattle's main attractions."
2418658,38801662,2015-07-18,7086859,Brandon,"Rebecca was wonderful to host me with short notice.  She was timely and clear with communication, and a really thoughtful hostess.  Attention to detail is not lost on her and that really made the stay wonderful.  Her welcome note with a map outlining local attractions and necessities was really great.  This apartment is fantastic, an idyllic Seattle style.  I really appreciated the location and the building, it was so close to everything I needed to do in Capitol Hill and downtown.  Parking was easy, I just parked on the street two blocks away on Belmont.  Note:  I saw the review talking about a cat pee smell after I booked, I am not a cat person and allergic so I was concerned but I did not have the same opinion...I noticed nothing of the sort.  I would absolutely stay here again. "
2418658,38939276,2015-07-19,1537592,Ian,"Rebecca's apartment was delightful. We had originally booked for just a night, but ended up extending for two more nights and canceling our other accommodations because we liked the apartment so much. The location was great for exploring Seattle and the sixth floor views were swell too."
2418658,39559396,2015-07-24,6745566,Daniel,"Lovely place, perfect location. Rebecca is incredibly sweet. Everything about it is warm and inviting and real."
2418658,39951700,2015-07-27,17797589,Ben,"Rebecca is fantastic and her place is wonderful. Clean and quaint and exactly what we needed. It is walking distance to almost everything, and we had a lovely time thanks to her recommendations. "
2418658,40945258,2015-08-03,6155965,Boris,"Despite Rebecca's apartment being right in the heart of Capitol Hill, it couldn't be more quite. 
We really loved the beautiful furniture and the view from the living room windows. 
Rebecca made it super easy for us to check in and out, and was very flexible with everything. 
The brick building is really beautiful as we. We really loved our stay and the more than perfect location of the apartment! "
2418658,41929086,2015-08-10,31111424,Matthew,Nice cozy apartment with the basics. Beautiful views of Seattle from the upper floors. Host was very receiving to any questions we had and answered them in a timely manner.
2418658,42146878,2015-08-11,10747797,Will,"The quintessential Airbnb apartment and a very courteous hostess. Rebecca was great in making the check in process seamless and was very thoughtful in how she prepared the apartment for our stay (down to a handwritten welcome note + neighborhood map!) 

The location is great. Stumbling distance (but out of earshot) from some lively bars and restaurants, and a lovely view from the apartment. 

You'll especially love it if you like firms beds.   ;)"
2418658,42447578,2015-08-13,3938946,Anna,Great neighborhood!  Rebecca was easy to contact and very responsive to my texts and emails prior to arrival. The apartment has a beautiful view over Seattle. 
2418658,42618690,2015-08-14,801718,Ivan,Lovely little place. Great location and a wonderful view. She was lovely as well. 
2418658,43096632,2015-08-17,1420302,Kaela,"Rebecca's apartment was a lovely place to stay for a weekend in Seattle. Although it's on the 6th floor, the views and the breeze from the top floor are worth the trek up the stairs! Her nice sense of style shows through in the furniture pieces and apartment decor, making it feel a little more homey and special. The building is old, but everything was very clean - and it had a nice charm. Capitol Hill is a nice spot for easy access to good restaurants. 

Communicating with Rebecca is really easy, and she's a thoughtful host. She left a nice welcome note and had a few neighborhood recommendations to share with us, as well as local coffee and cream. 

The bed is a little firm and uncomfortable if you are picky about your mattress, but I did sleep fairly well with the evening breeze coming in through the window. 

Overall, a good stay! "
2418658,43436798,2015-08-19,4597599,Guille,Rebecca's apartment was really cute and very well located.
2418658,43702830,2015-08-21,13414139,Kayla,Cute apartment- perfect location for getting around the city. Rebecca is super nice and very attentive! Totally recommend her place!
2418658,44980569,2015-08-30,12302382,Jennifer,"Rebecca's place is a real gem! Clean, great location, neat old vibe. She's a great host too. She was very attentive and left great information for us about the apartment and the surrounding area. I would stay here again and recommend you do the same."
2418658,45300420,2015-09-01,7943257,Belinda,"We had a great time at Rebecca's apartment.  The location is conveniently near some of our favorite spots in Capitol Hill, particularly Analog coffee! Her unit doesn't have wifi, if you're anticipating getting some work done, but wasn't a problem for us. Overall, we had a great time and Rebecca was an excellent host! "
2418658,45589193,2015-09-04,15877755,Monica,"Location was great. The room is as pictured. Rebecca was a great host, down to the smallest details - she left a handwritten note with recommendations and gave us access to her delicious teas (along with beer in the fridge). The kitchen table overlooks a beautiful view of Seattle. A warning for those with a car: overnight parking is a problem (as it seems to be all over Seattle)."
2418658,46349096,2015-09-09,5440888,Julia,"We had a very nice experience in Rebecca's home! Very clean and neat with a lot of personality. In fact, we enjoyed staying here more than at the Ace Hotel in Portland! It felt more homey and a much better value! She was very helpful with all of my questions and left a map with a lot detailed suggestions. Location was really nice, central but quite! Parking was kind of a pain as it is in most major cities. Turned out to be not a big deal as we got to see more of the neighborhood that way! "
2418658,46632800,2015-09-12,5997954,Molly,"Rebecca's place is in an awesome location. We LOVED staying here. The space is very big for being a studio and it's so close to restaurants, bars, coffee shops and a short walk to downtown. We would recommend this to anyone who wants to experience the hill and downtown. "
2418658,47072152,2015-09-15,41211058,Corrie,"Rebecca was an excellent host and her apartment was very comfortable. It was located in an ideal spot for my needs. Everything you needed was either provided for you by Rebecca or was easily obtained a short walk away. Rebecca was very responsive throughout my stay, even coming over to the apartment one night after I had locked myself out! I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to friends. "
2418658,47207961,2015-09-16,19339895,Valerie,"Rebecca's apartment was perfect! Just like the pics, clean, and in a great location. Although we didn't meet Rebecca in person, she let us know she was nearby and easy to reach if we needed anything. Next time we are in Seattle we plan to stay there again!"
2418658,47500180,2015-09-19,12361292,Merideth,"Rebecca was a great host - she was very responsive to my inquiries and gave clear instructions on how to get in the building. I think the buzzer to the outer building was broken while I was there, but one of the tenants was kind enough to let me in. 

The apartment is as described and I had a pleasant stay. It has a great view and comfortable places to sit and read or work. Also, as others have mentioned, Rebecca left really nice notes around the apartment to guide you through the stay. I did not notice ahead of time that the apartment doesn't have wifi, and this did affect my trip (I was in Seattle for work), but the Starbucks next to the building is perfectly adequate if you are desperate. 

"
2418658,47719362,2015-09-21,41312798,Hanna,"Our experience at Rebecca's in Capital Hill was great! Her apartment was tidy and was quite accommodating. Rebecca was quick to answer when I had a question. Overall, I'd highly recommend this location as it is close to many businesses, shops and near the heart of the city. We had so much within walking distance! "
2418658,48213152,2015-09-24,43389517,Jasmine,"Rebecca's apartment is really cute, and she has lots of resources about Seattle (including a handwritten map). "
2418658,49613482,2015-10-05,17912104,Christine,Rebecca was an exceptionally kind and welcoming host. She had wonderful communication and even offered some helpful information about the city. Her home had everything I needed for my stay and a beautiful view of the city was an added bonus. I would come stay here a million times over and would definitely recommend Rebecca as a host.
2418658,49955794,2015-10-07,16912599,Robert,"Rebecca's quick responses and communication were helpful since I did book last minute.  Easy come and go and I love the funky neighborhood of Capitol Hill, which is why I have stayed in that area about 7 times.  I walked to the light rail too...piece of cake...I thought it would be far but, only took about 20 minutes...about a half mile.  Nice view and an historical building that is pretty cool.  Well equipped kitchen, though I did not use it.  Starbucks right across the street and other coffee joints to enjoy close by...as well as bars and restaurants."
2418658,50291906,2015-10-11,36202429,Erin,"Rebecca was the ideal host for my trip. Apartment was super spacious for a studio (especially coming from the world of Boston where studios are oftentimes just closets), and the location in Capitol Hill put me close to a number of great restaurants and bars as well as convenient bus lines into Downtown and Seattle Center. Rebecca was also very fast to respond when I had questions- overall would definitely recommend!"
2418658,50478046,2015-10-12,43139240,Lauren,Great little place. Great little neighborhood! Great hostess!

2418658,51451314,2015-10-20,3553406,Ken,"Rebecca makes you feel very welcome at her cute apartment. My girlfriend and I came for an extended weekend and would definitely come back and stay here again.

The location is fantastic. Walking distance to all sorts of fun things in Capitol Hill. But also walking distance from downtown and all the tourist bits.

Glo's across the street serves up a lovely breakfast feast."
2418658,51530293,2015-10-21,7387098,Eliza,The best place to crash in Seattle for a night. Centrally located in Capitol Hill and close to lots of great stuff! Rebecca had new towels and soap ready for us and was very responsive through the stay. Wish I could have stayed longer!
2418658,51705723,2015-10-24,32811504,Rachael,"I loved this cute apartment in a funky neighbourhood with downtown an easy downhill walk away. The building is very charming and full of character - very European feeling. The apartment itself has a few quirks, but Rebecca was on hand to explain everything I needed to know, and was a great host. I really enjoyed listening to music on vinyl. There was no wifi but a Starbucks right across the street where I was able to do some work and send emails. The bed was lovely and firm - just how I like it. All in all a very nice stay."
2418658,52222382,2015-10-27,16749527,Brooke,"This is an amazing apartment in a beautiful location. Rebecca couldn't have been more available or accommodating. As previous guests have mentioned, the bed is quite firm, and my partner did have a tough time sleeping on that particular mattress (it's very nice, but very firm, which we aren't used to). Overall, I wild highly recommend this place for ease of check-in/out, location, cleanliness, host response time, and uniqueness. "
2418658,52691086,2015-11-01,16821014,Dustin,My wife and I had an awesome time staying at Rebecca's. Her place has super great style and is located in an amazing part of Capitol Hill. You can walk to so many awesome parts of Seattle from her front door. She has plenty of amenities in the house that you can use to stay cozy. If we ever return to Seattle this is where we would want to stay again!
2418658,53080243,2015-11-04,73310,Matt,"This is a great space located in the heart of Capital City. There are lots of great restaurants, bars and coffee shops within short walking distance.  Rebecca as always goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. The apartment room is clean and spacious and the apartment building itself is charming with a lot of character. This was the second time staying in Rebecca's place and it won't be the last!"
2418658,53331846,2015-11-08,3254056,Laura,"There are a couple of tricks to this apartment, if they don't come intuitively to you (which they didn't to me, but maybe that's because I'm British!):

1) When opening the front door, turn the key all the way to the right, then keep turning to the right at the same time as pushing open the door.

2) To use the shower, turn on the bath tap then pull the actual end of the bath tap down to make water come out of the shower.

Other than this, the apartment is really nice and Rebecca responded quickly to our questions. The view is great, and if you're looking to stay in a neighbourhood with cool coffee and bars (rather than downtown or somewhere touristy), then this is a great choice. It's got a great feel to it, while still being a short walk to the waterfront and market etc."
2418658,53477871,2015-11-09,11761254,Dennis,Rebecca's place was wonderful and communication with her was a breeze. The space was clean and just as pictured! Definitely recommend Rebecca's home as a quiet retreat for a quick Seattle trip.
2418658,55270713,2015-11-29,49053200,Sascha,"Rebecca’s apartment is adorable and is located in a great neighborhood!  She provided a welcome note that included a hand drawn map of the neighborhood with recommendations for restaurants, bars, coffee, shopping, and parking.  Rebecca was communicative and made sure she was available if needed.  I couldn't have wished for a better first Airbnb experience!"
2418658,55509293,2015-12-01,2173367,Nicole,"Studio was in a good location with easy access to all one might want while staying on Cap Hill. One downside was that the studio was a 6 story walk up, since the elevators weren't working. The views were great though, which made he climb worth it. "
2418658,55750610,2015-12-05,6745566,Daniel,"Lovely place. I am a repeat guest, which should say it all!"
2418658,56638920,2015-12-15,15955720,Bianca,"Pros: 
- Listing looked exactly as it did in the picture. 
- Instructions to access the room were easy to follow. 
Great view from the window of the space needle and downtown.
- The building is right in the middle of capitol hill which has an amazing nightlife pretty much any night of the week. 
- The walk to downtown only takes about 20-25 minutes. Really nice walk!
- Appliances are vintage and fun, no microwave:)

Cons: 
- Unfortunately the elevators werent working so we got quite a bit of exercise in, having to walk to and from the 6th (top) floor. 
- No TV or WiFi for those who need their tech fix. We really didn't mind as we were out most of the day. 
- The closest light rail station is about 1 mile away. Again we don't mind walking but its something to take into consideration if you don't have transportation. 

I would definitely recommend for the value and location! Seattle is a really cool town and has a lot to do. I would just follow up to see if the elevators are back up in case you're traveling heavy or require that accessibility. "
2418658,56812220,2015-12-18,50772471,Josie,This was the perfect place to stay for a little getaway! It had everything we needed without feeling cramped or cluttered. WE loved the fact that there was no tv so that we could really just focus on where we were and what we were doing. It was so quaint and Rebecca had everything perfectly ready for us. We were beyond satisfied with our decision to stay in Rebecca's home.
2418658,57000320,2015-12-20,25037466,Nick,"Rebecca and this space were both great.  Rebecca was helpful and eager to make sure we were well situated.  The space was clean, exactly as depicted, and in a great location.  Highly recommended."
240920,1865083,2012-08-01,2979011,Kaila,Good house in a quiet location with easy going housemates. Easy bus ride into downtown. Close to Greenlake and shops etc in Wallingford. Very happy to recommend it.
240920,2184978,2012-09-03,3300397,Chyanne,"Nathan was an excellent host, and went above an beyond to make sure my stay was great. I really enjoyed talking to his roommates, and exploring Seattle from this location, right off of a main bus route. The room was comfortable, clean, and the house was a cute bungalow in excellent condition. There were two other airbnb guests who stayed in the house when I was there from Germany, and they were really nice to spend time with as well. I recommend this place to others who are looking to explore the city!"
240920,5150677,2013-06-15,2444794,Michael,"Great location near shops and restaurants in a quiet neighborhood. Hosts were helpful with information on local events. There was a small problem with the sink which was fixed other than that, everything was great. Would recommend this place for anyone who wants to check our the Freemont, Wallingford or University district. "
240920,5364428,2013-06-26,6067170,Melissa,Nathan's home is in a quiet and lovely neighborhood. I never felt unsafe walking around at night. Friendly host and housemates. Definitely recommend.
240920,6245773,2013-08-05,3720004,Zachary,"Nathan was a fantastic host. He was friendly, calm, and helpful. The house is very nicely decorated and clean, and it's located in a very hip, quiet, and attractive neighbourhood - transit is close, as is some great food & coffee. Thanks for a great stay!"
240920,6353114,2013-08-09,7683586,Sasha,"Had a fantastic experience here! The house and area were lovely, as was the room. Everyone in the house was incredibly welcoming - could not have asked for better hosts! Would definitely stay here again!"
240920,6441128,2013-08-12,3973627,Krystal,"Although I wasn't able to stay very long, Nathan and his roomate were very helpful, nice and accomodating!  The house and room are gorgeous, and I look forward to contacting them again when I am back in Seattle."
240920,6678336,2013-08-20,7044116,Jake,Nathan has a beautiful house in a great location. I would definitely recommend his house for short or extended stays.
240920,6794693,2013-08-25,8086475,Noriko,"It was a comfortable stay. The residents were so quiet I didn't even know whether they are home or not. I guess they are at home quietly in the evening.

I would stay there again. Thanks Nathan and Patrick."
240920,7044797,2013-09-04,941212,Evelyn,"Nathan and his roommates wonderful. Although I didn't have a chance to meet Nathan in person, the moment you walk into his apartment you get a friendly vibe from a welcome white board with you name on it. Nathan has been great communicating with me back and forth about all the details (even though a lot of my questions are non-sense). I'd recommend his place to anyone who travels to Seattle. Thanks again, Nathan!"
240920,12434644,2014-05-02,13786848,Jack,"Nathan was a courteous host and invited me into his home as a member of the household. It was a clean and comfortable place to stay. Nathan clearly explained how to navigate the home. He was laid back in his expectations of house guests, but also clear about house rules and honest. I had a wonderful time and would definitely recommend this home to someone else!"
240920,37175102,2015-07-05,31473536,Felicitas,"I had a great time staying at the house. It was everything it says it is in the description ! Nathan (and Patrick) is super friendly and layed back - I'm sorry it took us a week to actually meet face to face. I enjoyed the Wallingford neighborhood - it's quiet and there are some nice coffee Shops very close by. Also, Green Lake is just a few minutes away. I recommend this place. If you can, go to one of the events at the Fremont Abbey :-)"
240920,38312207,2015-07-14,34880164,Chelsea,Staying at Nathan's place was one my best AirBnB experiences thus far! He was so welcoming and friendly and made sure we had an excellent time in Seattle. It was also so nice having the balcony in our room and the neighborhood was very walkable. I'd definitely recommend it! :)
240920,38764704,2015-07-18,2359202,Lara,"Lovely Airbnb experience! The house is charming and has a personal character, it's located in a beautiful neighborhood with good transportation to other nice area's such as Ballard, Golden Gardens Beach, Downtown and Capitol Hill. 
Nathan is a wonderful and generous host, he provided us with lots of tips for restaurants, cafes, activities, cultural places in Seattle and continued to do so after we continued our trip south to Portland. He also took us to the beach for paddle boarding and volleyball: highlight of our Seattle experience!
We'll definitely stay with Nathan again next time we visit Seattle.  "
240920,40595971,2015-08-01,8753884,Helen,"Nathan is a terrific host, very friendly and helpful, makes you feel at home. The room was clean and comfortable, great to have a balcony in the treetops, and the shared facilities were also very tidy and well set-up. It's a shared house, so you just take care of yourself, which was exactly what I was looking for. I felt very at home. The location is perfect, in between gorgeous Greenlake and Wallingford, one block from the tangletown shops and no 16 bus. I come to Seattle regularly and hope I get a chance to stay here again! "
5728739,39920443,2015-07-27,14165721,Ryan,"The townhouse was as advertised.  My family and I had a great time in Seattle and the awesome accommodation was seriously a plus. The townhouse was located close to downtown (about a 10 minute drive without traffic) and walking distance to some seriously good eats in the heart of Fremont. The décor was eclectic and the house was very clean. Upon arrival there were clean linens, toiletries, and other goodies provided. I could not have asked for more.

The only tip I would provide future guests is the parking. The entry to the garage and the garage itself is on the small side. So if you're driving a huge SUV or van, you may have issues getting in and out of the garage area. So, if possible rent a compact-mid-size sedan.

Otherwise, great place!"
5728739,46721551,2015-09-13,28316490,Joe,"The host was very accommodating to my family who were visiting from out of town by letting them have early access. It was perfect for them. The really liked the space and separation for the two families to have some time ""away"" from each other. The neighborhood was great for them to walk around and to see some tourist sites. "
5728739,49443911,2015-10-04,10787110,Pamela,My family and I had a wonderful and memorable experience thanks to this cozy home.  The location was perfect and the house was complete with everything we needed.  the house was exactly how it was described. We had an exceptional experience and I'd like to thank Sea to Sky! 
5728739,51323106,2015-10-19,35263365,Jene,"Great location, close to the water, and close to everything we had planed. Plenty of space for 6 people sharing beds. Everything was provided for us (towels, basic toiletries, etc.) even has an in unit washer and dryer for use. A binder was left for us and it answered any questions we had. Nice atmosphere, great outdoor spaces. We had a rental and the unit had a parking spot available. Would recommend to friends."
2966415,12908724,2014-05-13,15168151,Scott,"Nicolas was great and a very responsive host.  He also seemed quite interesting so am sorry that we didn't have more time to get to know him (we were on a tight schedule)...  Re the space, our room and bath were quite clean, the bed comfortable, and we had full access to the kitchen to make coffee.  Nice morning light.  His duplex is on a steep hillside with a long outdoor stairway to reach the entry (no problem for us but  I mention since it might be an issue for some).  The neighborhood is central but quiet.   Restaurants and a bakery/coffee house nearby as was the Arboretum. Overall a nice place to be."
2966415,13019271,2014-05-17,12393648,Brian,"Nicolas has a beautiful place in a quiet neighborhood only about twenty minutes by bus outside of downtown Seattle. I unfortunately didn't get to meet Nicolas during my visit, but he was very helpful in arranging my arrival and making sure I could access my room. The room is quiet and private and has both a private bathroom and closet. I hope to stay with (and finally meet) Nicolas again in the future. "
2966415,13111353,2014-05-19,6683963,Marla,"Great location to walk to restaurants on Madison and Capitol Hill. The room was spotless, as was the rest of the apartment. The only negative is that the bed is a little small for 2 people, perfect for one."
2966415,13290369,2014-05-24,15442131,Julia,"Nice, clean, and quiet house. The house with a long stairway on the hill has a good view. The guestroom and bath were clean. The bed in the guestroom was good to me. But, some basics such as soap, hand towel, hangers or dresser, and etc. were not prepared in the guestroom during my first stay. Nicolas is a nice and kind host. "
2966415,13518460,2014-05-29,15442131,Julia,"My second stay in his house was much better than before since I already have an experience. The guestroom was more prepared with the basics. Nice, clean, and quiet house and guestroom. Nicolas is a nice and kind host. "
2966415,13771560,2014-06-03,7962800,Will,"Staying at Nicolas's was great! The room is comfortable with a queen bed. Nicolas is  vey friendly. The room is right by the door, so can go in and out freely. Would recommend 5/5!"
2966415,14288597,2014-06-16,2784774,Joey,"Everything about this was exactly what I expected and exactly what I wanted. It was a great little guest room in a beautiful house just outside the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Also, parking was plentiful and the accommodations were very clean. (Be warned though that it's about four blocks down an ENORMOUS hill, so if you're unused to walking uphill this may not be the place for you.)"
2966415,14524855,2014-06-21,15950170,Vivien,"Maybe we were just unlucky, but we did not have such a good experience staying with Nicolas. The bathroom hadn't been cleaned after the previous people, although when we met Nicolas he was extremely apologetic and immediately cleaned the bathroom for us. The room is private and whilst that suited us, it would also have been nice to feel more welcome, for example there was no welcome message and interaction with Nicolas was minimal. "
2966415,15176600,2014-07-04,12161590,Diane,"Nicolas's house is clean and comfortable.  It is in a safe neighborhood and close to many shops and bus lines.  There was soap and shampoo available, and two large towels as well. I enjoyed my stay."
2966415,15333343,2014-07-07,12405595,Sylvia,"Nicolas was a kind host in letting my boyfriend and I stay at his place during the holiday weekend while he was away. He even tended to an emergency situation that we were very thankful for. His house is very clean and the room he provides is very private by being on the bottom floor with its own with a bathroom. All the bedding and towels were provided. One small thing to note is that there is quite a long flight of stairs walking up to the home. As for location, it felt as if it were 10-15 mins from everything we went to go sightsee, including downtown, which was perfect for myself, as it was my first time visiting Seattle.  "
2966415,15820428,2014-07-16,6144162,Megan,"Nicolas' place was perfect for our week-long stay in Seattle! The room is away from the rest of the living space and right next to the door so coming and going is very easy. There were towels provided. We were there for a week so we had to get some other necessities like shampoo and conditioner for ourselves but that was to be expected. We didn't get a chance to meet Nicolas but that's fine, we weren't around much anyways.

The location was very good for us; it's a nice, quiet neighborhood and is within walking distance of the Capitol Hill area and about a 10-15 minute car ride to downtown and a number of other areas. Other reviewers mentioned his place is down a very steep hill and that the place is up many stairs, they aren't kidding! You'll get a pretty good workout traversing the area on foot.

Overall our stay at Nicolas' was great and I would recommend it to anyone just looking for a basic private room and bathroom. "
2966415,16506928,2014-07-28,17967963,Aimee,"It was great to stay with Nicolas for four days. He was welcoming and accommodating  to my boyfriend and me. His house is beautiful and not too far from the main attractions. We took a short cab ride to most places. Nicolas allowed us to use the kitchen and living area. Additionally, he addressed any concerns or questions we had. I would definitely stay there again!"
2966415,17095549,2014-08-07,7368057,Ken,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Nicolas' place. It was clean, comfortable and quiet.  Nicolas was also a very friendly host, although we didn't see one another very often due to both of our work and outside activity schedules. But he was nice and also helpful whenever I needed anything. I would highly recommend his place and will hope to stay there again the next time I am in Seattle."
2966415,19100746,2014-09-06,13207954,Marcus,"My stay with Nicolas was great! Private, comfortable, and accommodating. Great location too!"
2966415,19884262,2014-09-20,17406856,Radost,"I didn't get to meet Nicolas, but the room was clean and nice. And the private bathroom and entrance were great. The house is in a quiet neighborhood, but still walking distance from Capitol Hill. Overall, it was a perfect choice for me."
2966415,32226101,2015-05-16,24600302,Sudeeptha,The host canceled this reservation 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2966415,33028401,2015-05-24,32779300,Ryan,Nico provided a quiet and private room w/ bathroom. An excellent environment for my first week of a new job.
2966415,35315393,2015-06-17,1000917,Jason,"Nicolas and Jeanna were perfect hosts for my trip to Seattle.  They communicated clearly and their property was clean and as depicted.  It's a great location in Seattle, central to just about everything.  "
2966415,35724998,2015-06-21,25364880,Ming,"On the whole journey, we didn't see Nicolas and Jeanna. However, when we texted him our request, they can satisfy our needs. But sincerely, the bed is not large enough for 2 girls. The accommodation is good but the location is not perfect if you don't have a car. "
2966415,36198913,2015-06-26,33973867,Daniel,"Everything was perfect; hosts were fine, accommodations were exactly as listed (with the surprise inclusion of a good upright piano!).  Comfortable bed, quiet, slept fine, etc.  Neighborhood is beautiful.  "
2966415,40214683,2015-07-29,17642445,Maja,"The room is nice, compact and very private. The bed is comfortable. I had a longer stay in the room (4 weeks) and Nicolas and Jeanna were very helpful at providing what I needed during my stay. The house is located in a quiet residential area in Seattle, but still in close proximity to supermarkets, bars and restaurants. It is well connected to downtown by few bus lines, but I also liked the picturesque walk through Pike and Pine street. Overall it was a great choice to stay here. "
2966415,45403462,2015-09-02,25321793,Timothy,"The room was perfect for what me and my friend were looking for. It was in a quiet neighborhood, had its own bathroom and felt very private and comfortable. It was also pretty close to downtown. I would definitely stay there again. "
2966415,46212453,2015-09-08,38453914,Nicholas,"Jeanna and Nicolas were lovely and gracious hosts.  I didn't see that much of them but when I did they made sure things were okay and that I had what I needed.

The room itself is very neat and very comfortable.  There was plenty of space for storage and a nice big bathroom.

The location is quite good too.  Close to two different bus routes as well as a night bus.  Even if you miss the bus, it's a short $10 Taxi ride from downtown or a 30-40 minute walk if you're feeling up to it.

I highly recommend this room for anyone planning on visiting Seattle."
2966415,46947665,2015-09-14,4456410,Kate,Great room.  As described.  I was out for most of the days there and didn't get a chance to meet Nicolas and Jeanna in person but they made arrival/departure very convenient.  
2966415,48501123,2015-09-27,14791495,Michael,"This is a lovely room, in a great location.  I came over from the UK for a week-long conference and had a great stay.

There's a good-sized closet for storing bulky luggage and hanging clothes, and the en-suite bathroom is a huge plus for convenience.

The room was clean and comfortable, and with a bonus piano (I don't play, but it made me smile).  It's a quiet location too, you won't have any problem getting a good sleep.

Up the (steep!) hill at E. Madison there are some coffee shops and restaurants, and a Safeway which is handy for any day-to-day stuff you might have forgotten.  There are buses from E. Madison to downtown, and of course Seattle has Uber.  I waited 4 mins max for any booking, it was super-fast.

I recommend this place - I'd stay here again if I was over in Seattle again for a conference.
"
2966415,49746086,2015-10-05,20891463,Jenna,"This place served its purpose. My husband and I wanted a quick weekend in Seattle and all we needed was a bed and a bathroom. It was nice to have a private entrance and get the key out of a lock and not have to wait for the host to let us in. They gave us towels, shampoo, conditioner, and provided water to drink. The place was clean and presentable. Wifi was unstable. "
2966415,51815103,2015-10-24,39347937,Robert,The listing was described accurately.
1652107,8059328,2013-10-14,8750891,Trish,"So warm and cozy!! We rented this amazing cottage-like house for a girls weekend for two nights. The picture's don't do the decor justice-from the paint colors to the touches here and there it's downright adorable. Two of the bedrooms have beds comfy for two people, and the third room has a bunk bed: All the guests raved about the mattresses-even the bunk bed was cozy! Nice linens in all rooms and the bathroom. We were 7 people (It's an extra 40$ per night for each person over 6 staying) and I wouldn't do more than that in the space. 

One bathroom (be advised) but stocked with everything you'll need. The kitchen is large and well appointed: We cooked and stayed in one of the nights-plenty of glassware, silverware and cooking utensils. 

The street this house is cute and seemed safe, the red door is a classic touch and the back yard is small and cute. The neighborhood you drive through to get there might unnerve you a bit-stay strong my friend, once you get there you won't be disappointed.

Speaking of being unnerved: A word on the slasher film style basement. As the door creaked open from the kitchen we all gasped in horror: descending those creepy stairs meant certain death for sure!! Sigh, over-reaction-there's actually a ping pong table down there and also where the laundry is located. 

Internet worked great! Lots of books and a piano in the living room. The dishwasher wasn't really hooked up. Not just not plugged in, but didn't look like it was actually attached to any water sources. Annoying but oh well. The property isn't walkable to much. Downtown is a 35$ cab ride and the airport is about the same. The nearest grocery store of any substance was about a 5 minute drive. 

The host Blair communicated with me quickly and easily throughout the booking, during out stay and afterwards. We'll definitely book it again next time we're in the area. 



"
1652107,8105967,2013-10-15,9317032,Casey,"    Blair was very accommodating and easy to work with. The stay was very clean, spacious, and had ping pong! Would stay here again next time we visit Seattle thanks Blair! "
1652107,8205287,2013-10-20,9473492,Jeff,Excellent.  Very comfortable beds.  A little further outside of downtown then I would have wanted but all in all a great place 
1652107,8679050,2013-11-11,9837072,Shirley,"If you are looking for all the brand new fancy shmancy, this house is NOT for you!! Its quiant, its quircky (roll the dishwasher over and hook it up!!) its FUN (ping pong table), its spacious (my 4 kids played downstairs all weekend), its quiet (I thought the front street was going to be noisy all night, not AT ALL!!) its adorable for its age!! The beds were so soft with down comforters, my kids said they felt like they ""were sleeping in cotton candy""!! I'm not used to furnace heat and we were plenty toasty warm even with hardwood floors. Yes, its a wee bit out of town but we found a place to park by the light rail for free and we rode the light rail downtown for $16 for 6 of us!! First day, we got off the train 3 blocks from the waterfront, the 2nd day, we went to Space Needle via monorail!! We had a great stay!! Blair was VERY fast to respond to any questions we had!! Thanks 
"
1652107,9115154,2013-12-08,2596949,Casey,"I had a group of three stay at Blair's property for a work trip and the place worked out perfect.  I have used airbnb before and found that sometimes it was tough getting the keys to the homes but in this case it was very simple.  Blair had everything that we needed already set up and he emailed us all the directions and house rules days before we got there.

I would definitely stay here again!"
1652107,9736232,2014-01-07,9391466,Lucero,"We truly enjoyed our stay at this home. It was clean, cute and centrally located. The kitchen and bathroom were very well equipped,  and the bedrooms were comfortable. The dishwasher wasn’t plugged in so it was a bit difficult to use. Other than a few logistical issues with the delivery of the keys at our arrival and technical questions about the internet and cable, we were happy at this home."
1652107,10665094,2014-03-02,204816,Megan,"By sheer coincidence, some very good friends and I were all going to be in Seattle over the same weekend. We envisioned a house where we could all stay together, catching up and checking in with one another. When we found Blair's house in the southern part of the city, it was a dream come true! The space was lovely, and comfortably housed 6 people. It was spotlessly clean, and came with all of the extras we needed (including 2 bottles of wine). The house was in prime location for exploring the city (just a quick 10 minute drive to downtown), but also allowed us to spend time with one another without outside distractions. Although we didn't meet in person, Blair was very welcoming, and responded to all of our questions at lightening speed. At the end of our stay, we all agreed that we would stay again. Many thanks for your hospitality, Blair!"
1652107,10844539,2014-03-10,325898,Ty,"This place is easy breazy and full of steezy. Blair wasnt too rapid with the communication---but I'd give him a B. Im super easy in that respect, in fact the less we speak the happier I am. This House is perfect for a group, so easy, so cute, and so DWELL magazine! EASY. The location isn't my dream, but its so cheap who cares if the closest star bucks is 9.3 minutes by car?

Super Chill host, let us check out late. Really easy. Worked great for us."
1652107,10925279,2014-03-13,12131973,Chassea,"Pleasant, quiet neighborhood with a park within walking distance. Comfortable beds and nice backyard. Easy 20 minute commute to downtown. Everything was just as described and perfect for our family. "
1652107,12002641,2014-04-21,13045735,Jing,"The Prime Seattle Craftsman home makes our journey wonderful. The host is easily to be contacted. The location is really convenient. Neighborhood is very nice. Anyway, it's a good place to stay!! "
1652107,13117608,2014-05-19,4217281,Jennifer,"It was great to have a 3 bedroom house for myself and 2 girlfriends on a shopping trip to Seattle. The beds were very comfortable and the duvets were a treat.
The house is in a good location.
It was nice to have the instant book option on this property and Blair was very quick to respond.
Thanks very much
"
1652107,14969375,2014-06-30,2316057,Jen,lovely place to stay that accommodated my whole family. communications were easy and the host was welcoming and flexible with a last minute request.
1652107,15694841,2014-07-14,255399,Yuki,"Super cute house! Well appointed with everything we needed (linens, dishware, even a pizza knife!, good reads, adorable back yard. Easy parking for our large group, easy access to the I-5 for a quick drive into downtown Seattle. Downstairs basement was perfect play area. Thank you!! "
1652107,16293634,2014-07-25,14171840,Kevin,"This home was a wonderful place for my group to reside in for the week of our convention. The kitchen is fully stocked for all types of cooking as well as a ping pong table in the basement for entertainment. The living room has a sofa that can be converted to a bed for extra capacity along with wireless internet and basic television. The neighborhood is quiet and felt quite safe in the evening. 

Overall it has exceeded our expectations and will be in consideration for future  travel needs!"
1652107,16891011,2014-08-04,14779431,雅,We love the house very much and it is nearly downtown. 
1652107,17208267,2014-08-09,16355171,Michelle,"In general we had a nice stay in the house.  There were plenty of clean towels and dishes for us to use.  The beds were fairy comfortable.  The location was convenient although the surrounding area looks a bit rundown.  Parking on the street was very easy.  A few areas need improvement - the kitchen sink doesn't drain well, a doorknob broke, the ventilation cover on the floor was loose, and there a few spiderwebs in the corner.  Overall the house had enough room to accommodate seven of us and the owner provided very clear directions."
1652107,19442818,2014-09-12,20989440,Chris,Great. Quiet neighborhood. Clean house. Close to the city. Very much appreciated.
1652107,21124959,2014-10-12,18619546,Qing,"房东回信很及时
指示详尽准确一"
1652107,21448179,2014-10-17,851427,Walter,"The house was as described. It is an older home with lots of character and charm. 
The beds were so very cozy and the layout worked perfectly for our family of 5. 

The basement is a bit creepy but that can be overlooked when you start playing ping pong. 

We had a great stay.

Thanks

The Cornelius Family"
1652107,22292558,2014-11-03,19480066,Cory,I had a fairly large group of friends that I met up with in Seattle for a 2 night stay over Halloween weekend. Blair's listing said the house could sleep 8 but he was very accommodating in letting my group of 11 use his home. There were two extra carpeted rooms downstairs in the basement in which a few people were perfectly fine sleeping in with an air mattress or sleeping bag. The house provided everything we needed to make our stay comfortable and was only about a 5 minute drive from the freeway which made getting into downtown VERY easy for the activities we had planned for the weekend. The extra fee for having a few more people stay in the house was also more than reasonable. I feel like our overall experience was worth far more than what I pad to rent the house. It was a very good value and I would definitely recommend renting one of his properties in the future.
1652107,23657947,2014-12-07,24160514,Susmita,Blair was very responsive via email and provided detailed easy to follow instructions. Staying at Blair's place was amazing. We had a party of 8 people for a bachelorette party. The house was cozy and comfortable. Highly recommend Blair. Thank you Blair! 
1652107,25815858,2015-01-26,5779523,Nima,I was staying at Blair's place with my family and we had such an amazing time! The place was very clean and comfortable and Blair was perfectly available any time I contacted. I highly recommend this place and Blair is a great host!
1652107,27662591,2015-03-09,26924041,Kelly,We only stayed in the house for one night but it was super cute and very clean and the beds were very comfortable! There was plenty of parking on the street too. Thanks Blair!
1652107,28025555,2015-03-16,28255469,Conghe,"beautiful house, very nice place to stay!"
1652107,28398030,2015-03-23,27506660,Corey,"Right off the freeway, you think you've landed yourself in the heart of an old industrial area, however, a short drive up a hill and you reach an established quiet neighborhood. Perfect location, equidistance between west Seattle, downtown, and the airport! Very convenient for any type of traveler, choose from the abundance of street parking available no matter what time of day/night it is or public transportation right outside the house! House was clean and comfortable for the five of us. Blair responded to all emails within 12 hours. "
1652107,28984734,2015-04-02,12973938,Amber,"Blair's home was quaint and suited our needs better than a hotel would have. The location is conveniently located near the rail system and the mass transit system literally picks up outside the front door. The walk to the rail system however is a steep walk down and feels even steeper on the way back up. Just a short walk away is a lovely park that during the day was pretty quiet but had some questionable people after dark. The neighborhood overall was quiet but we did not feel 100% comfortable in the evenings. The front of the home had sheer curtains so everyone riding the bus or driving by had a glimpse of what was going on inside. The back of the house which butts up to an alley, had no curtains and gave us an uneasy feeling as well. On a positive note the beds and bedding were extremely comfortable but the folding futon for a 7th person was stiff. The kitchen was stocked with plenty of pans, dishes, silverware and cups but lacked in cooking utensils. We were not adequately  my stocked with toilet paper (3 rolls for 7 people for 10 days) but this was a fairly inexpensive but inconvenient purchase for us to make. The neighboring area is pretty rough but can easily be avoided if you drive a bit further for your shopping. For a rental it met our needs for the time in the Seattle area and I would recommend this place in the future. "
1652107,29430174,2015-04-07,28245833,Ginah,"What a wonderful time in Seattle. Blair made it so convenient and provided an amazing place to stay. There were six of us friends who met up in Seattle from Vegas, NYC, California, and Nebraska. we wanted an intimate place where we could stay and spend some time and also had the flexibility for each of us to aig off and do our own things. This was thee perfect place."
1652107,29896132,2015-04-13,2070963,Leticia,"Blair's home was clean, cozy and very comfortable. Definitely family friendly.  Beds and sheets were perfect, kitchen had everything we needed.  It felt really homey, calm, quiet and safe. 
It's just a short drive to downtown Seattle and there is a lovely park right down the street. 
Communication was timely, checking in was a breeze and really this is an amazing value. 
I recommend and will likely be back."
1652107,30884558,2015-04-28,6581363,Jennifer,"Our group of 7 adults and 2 kids had a very comfortable stay at Blair's house. Although we did not get a chance to meet him in person, he answered all questions promptly and was flexible about our changing group size, who was going to check in first, etc. The location was convenient for us because we were mostly attending wedding events to the south of dowtown, and easy access to Sea-Tac was also a plus. Thanks!"
1652107,31464796,2015-05-05,24464339,Lihi,"Great house, great stay! We loved the decor and the common spaces; the backyard was lovely as well! Infractions with Blair were prompt and efficient; I would definitely recommend it. "
1652107,32132118,2015-05-14,22310929,Travis,"The house was great. It was cozy and comfortable. The bedrooms are simple and very clean. The beds are very comfortable and the linens were nice. The TV is newer and had an extra HDMI port, which we plugged into to play games.

The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and seemed safe. It was very convenient to drive into the city while staying out of the worst of the traffic. It's away from the noise of the city but very close to Boeing Field with the sound of airplanes taking off during the day. The gap you drive through to park in the back is a bit tight, so if you have a larger car or van, it may be easier to park on the street in front of the house.

The exchange with Blair was very simple and without any issues. I'd recommend staying here to my friends."
1652107,32908734,2015-05-23,403810,Natasha,Blair's place was extremely perfect for our short stay in between our travels. It had everything we needed and was perfect for a group. Would highly recommend !
1652107,33723031,2015-05-31,33606728,Lourdes, We love the location. The location was quiet and in a nice area. The kitchen was well stock. The beds were comfy. The ping pong table was excellent. The park was walking distance. All rooms were spacious. The backyard was perfect for my dog. Towels were available at all time. Downtown was a short drive. Privacy was one problem in our stay. Adding better curtains to all rooms for more privacy. Especially the kitchen window had no curtain. Neighbors were looking through. Felt a little uneasy. When we arrived the house was not as clean. Also  there were not enough channels on the television. We only had about 20 channels. Overall the house was perfect for us. 
1652107,33808976,2015-06-01,22698292,Dana,"The house was close to Seattle but not in busy downtown, which was awesome. Nice, quiet neighborhood and parking wasn't too hard to find. It had room for all us ladies. Only downside was there was only 1 bathroom."
1652107,36733762,2015-06-30,15609566,Kim,"We had a great experience at this house! We knew the location and were actually looking for something south of downtown, but it's a good spot for anyone visiting Seattle! The house was ""no frills"" compared to some of the places we've stayed on AirBnB (e.g. no breakfast food or supplies beyond utensils and sheets/linens) but everything was clean and as advertised. Blair was responsive and easy to work with! We happened to stay during the heat wave so the house got a bit warm but that's just Seattle when it's in the upper 80's!"
1652107,39622958,2015-07-25,17436886,琳红,I love this small and lovely house. Everything is perfect.there is a road that go to the house is very beautiful。hope next time we can stay here again.
1652107,43523338,2015-08-20,19419929,Mark,The house was great!  There was ample space for my five friends and I.    The beds were comfy.  The neighborhood was nice and quiet.  Downtown Seattle was only 10-15 minutes away.
1652107,45573478,2015-09-04,38910413,孙,The house is clean and nice.
1652107,46138219,2015-09-08,36081417,Zheqi,It was one of our great experience. The house was kept clean before we arrived and we really enjoyed our stay.
1652107,46626856,2015-09-12,8612508,Jon,Super easy check in and check out. Perfect for business or leisure travelers. Really responsive host. Problem with the sink was fixed within an hour. 
1652107,46747572,2015-09-13,41011515,Meredith,"House was very cute! Would definitely recommend staying here, but not in the summer... I didn't realize at the time of booking there was no air conditioning.  However, all of the bedroom windows had screens, so we could at least open them at night to cool off the house. They also had some floor fans, but no ceiling fans. Overall, a good experience. Had lots of fun playing ping pong :)"
1652107,46920463,2015-09-14,32800896,Lauren,We had a wonderful visit and would recommend the place to friends!
1652107,47097643,2015-09-15,6824719,Matt,"The house was great. The sheets, especially, were amazing and earned praise from several family members. The neighborhood was quiet and we had a nice night. It was an easy shot to SeaTac the next morning without much traffic."
1652107,47505372,2015-09-19,41196424,Jun,适合家庭住，特别有两个小朋友的家庭；厨房和洗衣间很方便，床上用品很干净；后院挺不错的！
1652107,47793950,2015-09-21,43177056,Bethany,"The house was great, very clean and spacious the rooms were a good size. Perfect for our stay!"
1652107,48125740,2015-09-23,28518140,Sophie,The house was exactly as depicted in the pictures online at airb&b. The bed was really comfortable and the house was light and airy. I'd definitely come back again! 
1652107,48490370,2015-09-26,2496879,Andjela,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1652107,49341732,2015-10-03,24044339,Amy,Blair was quick to communicate with us and made the check-in process easy. The neighborhood is nice and the house was really cute--perfect for our short visit to Seattle! 
1652107,49598150,2015-10-05,17476524,Ashley,Blair was an awesome host! The house was great and clean as well as all of the linens. He was also very accommodating for everything I needed and answered questions immediately.
1652107,51321674,2015-10-19,21849340,Jackie,The house was very cute and mostly had what we needed. Not much within walking distance. 
1652107,52249964,2015-10-27,26923849,Jisun,"Blair was very accommodating to our every need and request, even an additional evening.  The house was perfectly suited for us and we throughly enjoyed our stay.  Blair was a great host and the house made it even better!"
1652107,53497013,2015-11-09,46219089,Carmelo,The house was great and very comfortable. It is filled with beds and meets all basic needs. The location is near some bars on Rainer S and the Link and buses stop right by the house and make for an easy commute downtown. 
1652107,54525618,2015-11-21,38610907,Burak,"Blair's place is in a good neighborhood, not much to do and see without a car when it is raining but that was because we had a baby and actually the bus stop is right in front of the house :) but I would love to come back in summer again. The place itself is nice, clean, and neat. Really nicely decorated and feels like home. And Blake is fast to respond for your inquiries."
1652107,55367899,2015-12-01,13309118,Holly,"Blair was great at communicating prior to and during our stay.  The house is charming.  Large and clean with comfy beds and in a quiet area.  Well stocked kitchen.  Good wifi connection.  Lots of street parking.
"
1652107,56033858,2015-12-08,18939422,Kelsi,"This cozy house is in a nice quiet neighborhood south of the city. There is a bus stop right out front. We had a car and there was plenty of parking on the street. Blair was quick to respond to questions and since no one was staying the night before or the night after, allowed us an early check-in and a late check-out. The bedrooms were nice and the beds comfortable. The kitchen was great- fully stocked to cook up a meal with our loot from Pike Place Market. Overall a very nice stay!"
1652107,57218328,2015-12-23,70666,Cherilyn,"This was a great place, very comfortable and lots of space. As mentioned the beds were super comfortable. The kitchen was well supplied to make most meals, the only thing we couldn't locate was a can opener. Blair was responsive and helpful. "
5969069,31066813,2015-05-01,6212486,Nigel,"The accommodation was exactly as described, if not more impressive! The area is a beautiful residential neighbourhood, with lots of trees, flowers, etc. It's also a very quiet area.

Adam is a great host. He is fast w/ his responses and provided helpful guidance. Upon my arrival at the location, Adam met me in person and walked me around the apt. 

As mentioned, the accommodation is amazing. Spacious and modern - incl. a large washer and dryer (separate units) that worked very well. The kitchen is also fully equipped with modern equipment and beautiful plates, cutlery, etc. All that you would need was provided for.

There is a large Safeway about 10mins walk away and there are bus stops close by (I mainly used Uber and it was very easy for them to find the location).

The private garden was great to sit out in during the afternoons and enjoy the sun and peace."
5969069,32072838,2015-05-13,27839815,Ali,"Adam's place is amazing. My friend and I had a great time staying there. The space is great and the location was continent and in a good neighborhood. We've already decided that if we ever go back to Seattle, this would be the place to stay!"
5969069,32622904,2015-05-19,25463838,Aaron,I loved the spot it. I thought it was only better in person! Adam was an amazing host and was there to answer any questions I had. Would love to stay there in the future.
5969069,41584797,2015-08-08,26268580,Blair,"This was my first time using Airbnb, and I couldn't be happier having Adam be the host for this first experience. Not only was this place exactly as it looked in pictures, but everything was just as it was described. Adam was kind and always very thoughtful. We didn't get to interact too often, but whenever we did it was always very pleasant. He was also always there through email or text if we ever needed anything. 

The place itself is a great location in a very nice little neighborhood. It's just a few blocks from coffee shops, grocery stores, restaurants and more! Its also a safe neighborhood filled with great neighbors. There is street parking, and it's never an issue finding a spot which was great. The backyard is also a very nice place to just relax and hangout. The only thing to keep in mind is that it is a basement apartment and depending on who is upstairs, the footsteps can be pretty loud and there isn't much you can do about it because its no ones fault! We got used to it over time and Adam did warn about it so it was fully expected and not too bad! Overall though, I absolutely loved the place. I was here for 2 1/2 months during a summer internship and had never been to Seattle before, and I felt right at home. 

So thank you Adam, again, for everything! You made my stay so special."
5969069,56016601,2015-12-08,24979247,Meghan,"Couldn't be happier- neighborhood & apartment were exactly as described if not nicer. ""Fully furnished"" can really be a crap shoot, but this had everything we needed to comfortably settle in and even entertain guests from out of town. Adam was incredibly helpful, giving us awesome recommendations for the area and quickly addressing any small things that came up. "
5969069,57040047,2015-12-21,47557349,Karla,"Adam was very friendly and helpful from the very beginning. He responded in a timely manner to emails which left no questions unanswered at all. Adam contacted me the day before check-in with easy instruction on how to get in as well as internet passwords and other helpful information about the place. We never had the chance to meet Adam in person, but he was such a great host when we had minor questions throughout our trip. He was extremely responsive to text messages and always did his best to accommodate us.

We were traveling with a German shepherd, so it was great that Adam allowed us to stay even with our large dog. The basement apartment was perfect for our one week stay in Seattle. The living room was very spacious with a large TV complete with Netflix. Although we didn't use it much, the kitchen was cute and had any dishes and cutlery you could possibly need. There were 2 bedrooms and a small bathroom with many clean towels available. The pictures show exactly what you will get if you decide to stay at this lovely urban oasis.

Not only was the place perfect, it's location was central to everything. Everywhere we wanted to go was no more than 20 minutes away and there were so many nearby restaurants to try, that we were able to try so many different foods without repeating cuisines. It was great! It sucks that it was cold and rainy during our visit, but we would definitely consider staying here again if we come back to Seattle."
5969069,57876108,2015-12-30,1158137,Jean,"This apartment was FABULOUS! When we arrive the place was spotless and clean, the heat was on and our beds were already made! Adam had all the essentials we needed to get started; toilet paper, paper towels, dish/hand soap, coffee and bottled water. The internet, flat-screen TV and kitchen appliances were easy to use. The private yard was a big plus for our visiting four-legged friends. Although this place is dog friendly there were no signs of previous dogs living here as the place was spotless and it smelled very fresh and clean. Everything was very organized and tidy so we were able to find everything we needed in the kitchen. Adam was quick to respond to any of my questions and was very helpful! We will definitely be booking again for our next stay. FIVE STARS!! "
7807169,45033404,2015-08-30,37680525,Sarah,We didn't get the apartment that had the photos on the listing so a gap on the expectations. The apartment I thought I rented had a view and was larger vs the one we actually got even if it was in the same building.  Great location but I was still disappointed. Also some of the instructions on how to use TV etc could have been helpful.
7807169,53063606,2015-11-04,31815400,Jeremy,"Great place, great view, great price and great location.  I walked to Pike place nearly every day, got on the fwy easily and went for a run along the water 1 block away.   They even left snacks out for guests.   I would love to stay there again.  There was one minor problem and they totally took care of it.  "
7807169,55561241,2015-12-02,38718386,Eliza,"We couldn't have asked for a better location. Almost everything we wanted to see/do was within a mile radius - sightseeing, bars, restaurants. 

The posted pictures aren't of this specific apartment but are a pretty good representation - large windows, contemporary furniture, Pottery Barn color scheme. The balcony faces a public parking lot and does not have an oceanview but you do get a nice view of vintage brick buildings. The beautiful terrace is, however, as pictured and is on the same floor as this apartment. We were here in Nov/Dec so we couldn't enjoy it but next time!

Master bedroom has an en suite bathroom. The large window was nice but anyone needing absolute darkness or minimal street noise should take the other bedroom. The 2nd bedroom had a tv in it which was a nice bonus."
9694921,58079217,2015-12-31,1651755,Katherine,"Great experience staying in this wonderful home!

1) Fantastic location in Westlake - I could get to the 5, any part of downtown Seattle, Fremont, etc within five minutes any direction. Also very close to the big tech presence, took me less than five minutes to head into the office.

2) Neighborhood is friendly, lots of people walking around, especially with dogs.

3) House is gorgeous - usually when I think ""historic"" houses I think of very old, kind of run down homes but this one is anything but - it has all the charm of an older home - beautiful doorways, large rustic kitchen that you see on those house remodelling shows as the ""after"", clawfoot bathtub, etc - and none of the old home-ness. 

4) Hosts were great - available via message whenever I had a question and made us feel very welcome. Left us coffee as a treat.

5) Dog friendly - front yard has decent patch of grass, backyard is closed off (no grass right now in the back). "
7109735,37430158,2015-07-06,13935383,Dominic,"Dons place was nice, comfortable and the view from the deck was perfect. Everything in the listing was accurate. Don made it easy to get inside once we arrived and had great recommendations. I will recommend his condo to friends."
7109735,38217259,2015-07-13,23091271,Christy,"Queen Anne was such a fun place to stay during our trip to Seattle! The whole place was styled very modern yet comfortable. Pictures were a very true representation of the space.

Don recommended some tasty restaurants, all nearby. If I had to choose my favorite, it was The 5 Spot. Yuuumy breakfast and a fun Hawaiian atmosphere! 

We were close to everything, including the space needle and chihuli glass gardens. We absolutely loved our time! "
7109735,39096897,2015-07-20,16750643,Omobola,Don was fantastic in making us feel comfortable and welcome.  Their place is conveniently located in a pretty cool area and their apartment was exactly what was pictured on the website.  I would highly recommend their place!
7109735,41671061,2015-08-08,14746129,Minmin,"Don's apartment is amazing, it's like a dream house for us. Incredibly clean and cozy and has a terrace with a fantastic view. Wish we could have stayed longer."
7109735,46147385,2015-09-08,3913164,Nicholas,"Don's place was great! Beautiful apt, awesome view and perfect location.  Went to Bumbershoot over Labor day and we could walk to the concert along with a bunch of restuarants and bars.  Up the hill is Kerry park and a pretty spectacular view of Seattle dwntn and Space Needle. Definitely will be the first place I look the next time I am in Seattle."
8409949,49179204,2015-10-01,44347328,Kota,It was very clean.Comfortable.
8409949,49747427,2015-10-05,251537,Tessa,"This was a great Airbnb experience.  I didn't have much contact with the host at all, but everything was pleasant.  The neighborhood is a good one, close to beautiful Seward Park and not far from Columbia City, which has an excellent PCC (organic grocery store).  All in all a good experience."
8409949,50147385,2015-10-09,3074964,Jiří,"It was a great time at Darios, really nice room and house in very quiet part of Seattle. Easy to get to with Light rail and Uber from Othello station. "
8409949,50418251,2015-10-11,8554626,Terry Logan,"I've stayed here before and I'll stay here again. Easy communication. Clean, well stocked. Great place to stay!"
8409949,50802367,2015-10-14,6475243,Squinky,"Nice, clean house close to public transit, although you have to walk up a steep hill to get there (it IS Seattle, after all). I didn't actually get to meet Alessandro, but he was quick to respond to messages. Great for travelling on a budget!"
8409949,50995619,2015-10-16,25042709,Cynthia,The room was a nice place to crash for a couple nights. We didn't meet the host but we were greeted when we arrived. They were very accommodating when I requested to arrive a bit early and the room was ready for us very quickly. 
8409949,52279133,2015-10-27,45777310,Jessica,"This was my first Airbnb experience, and it was great! The house was very clean and welcoming with everything you could need, and check in was easy as no keys were involved. Very nice that breakfast is included, and it's not just toast and cereal. I was gone during the days so didn't meet anyone, but Dario and Alessandro were quick to reply to text. Would definitely stay here again."
8409949,52743315,2015-11-01,2152612,Anatoly,"Alessandro was replacing Dario this time, so I could write about him. The place is great, very spacious and welcome to the guests. I especially like the dimmed lights in the corridors helping to navigate during the night. Location was a bit far away from the center, but with the public transport and uber you could easily cone to the city center."
8409949,53272401,2015-11-07,2234440,Scott,Dario's homes are well suited for the traveler. There are common spaces to relax in and complete kitchens at your disposal with breakfast foods available. The bathrooms are clean and include towels and hair and body products. You can arrive with only your clothing and have a very comfortable stay. 
8409949,53520071,2015-11-09,45549036,Susan,"I was lucky I ran into Dario when I check in.  We had a little mix up about where the room was, he was very helpful.  I did not see the host after that.  The house was very clean and breakfast was a treat to have available to make it yourself. Eggs, bacon, bread, yogurt, fresh fruit and more.  Thank you"
8409949,53705363,2015-11-11,36640990,Andrew,Dario was great. The room was perfect and we were left to it. Probable the best Air bnb location I have stayed at.
8409949,53863790,2015-11-13,707398,Colleen,"My first trip to Seattle - Dario's place met my needs very well. Nice house, very clean. Coffee, tea, and snacks were available. Easy 1 mile walk to light rail or other direction to Columbia City strip with some  cute restaurants, coffee, co-op whole foods type grocery. Great find!"
8409949,54156237,2015-11-16,10265823,Qianhui,"Overall is good, but the bed has some noise when I sat on it. I didn't have any breakfast there, however, I saw there are multiple choices of breakfast. The house is a little bit far from rail station if you have to walk. "
8409949,55402824,2015-12-01,32024421,Joel,"He made everything crystal clear with the description provided, both in email and on the listing. Definitely would recommend! "

The room was perfectly fine - bed was kind of what you'd expect and everything was clean. The breakfast options were adequate. My quick overnight stay went by without issue and with its convenient location, I'd definitely consider staying here again.

8409949,57126742,2015-12-22,45045998,Sharissa,Very clean and comfortable living space. House was quite and conveniently located not too far from downtown. Checked in with a woman who appeared to be cleaning the home at the time. 
4808896,24697377,2015-01-01,1297354,Jessica,What a darling house and an even more wonderful host. I can't say enough good things about this entire experience. I loved everything about my stay so much I even inquired about a long term rental on the property. Highly recommended!
4808896,42504376,2015-08-14,22625896,Alicia,Lieschan was a great host to us. She was always there to answer any questions i had even about Broadway plays. The house was just as described and the little side yard was great for our pups. We couldn't have asked for a better host for our summer experience inn Seattle. 
4808896,43401817,2015-08-19,39074538,Annie,"I was staying at Lieschan's place for my job interviews. My interviews were north, easy and south of this place. For that purpose, the location was very convenient for me. Back yard was very nice for my puppy too."

4808896,48670034,2015-09-28,26132527,Jean,The facility was neat and clean and the hot tub was ready for use when we arrived.  There was some food and coffee available for our use and since we arrived late in the evening that was very nice.
4808896,51061068,2015-10-17,32631462,Johanna,"Lovely, well equipped townhouse in a great location!  Lieschan couldn't have been nicer or more helpful. We had a great stay and enjoyed the large side yard and hot tub in the back yard.  "
4808896,55710888,2015-12-05,29240495,Elizabeth,Our time at the Morgan junction townhouse was so special.  A great home for our month here. We liked it so much that were trying to find a permanent home here! Lieschan is such an accommodating host and I'm really glad we ended up at her place.

8036620,57645918,2015-12-28,21337830,Allycea,"My family lives in the area however where hosting Christmas here in Seattle. Being that our place is not set up for that, we found William and Liz's place. My family was greeted with welcome goodies and a well laid out explanation of the rules of the house. 

Liz and William left their beautifully decorated Christmas tree and décor up for my family to enjoy. Which my kiddos truly loved! 

The home was spacious and clean.  The house was a little chilly but there is a fireplace in the living room that kept that space cozy. The kitchen had more than enough room and the master bedroom suite is very luxurious. "
3604931,30775813,2015-04-27,26804768,Matt,We have stayed at this home twice and we really think it is a nice home with nice hosts.  Amy is responsive and it is a really nice home in Seattle.  Thanks again.  Highly recommended
3604931,50432181,2015-10-12,34598798,Cindy,"We chose this house because we needed a special place to celebrate a special occasion, our daughters wedding. It was perfect. We had room for everyone, we could entertain, watch slideshows and movies, sit around the fire, cook delicious meals, and primp for the big day in the spa-like master bathroom. Thanks for helping us create an unforgettable experience. Cindy and Bob"
7335567,41281039,2015-08-05,5786761,Rachael,"We had a great stay at Dan's studio and he even met me downtown to drop the keys to me for convenience. The studio was very clean, and a great neighborhood.. 15 minute walk to all the fun spots in capital hill. "
7335567,42192735,2015-08-11,38789709,Ann,"Dan was flexible , helpful with directions and responsive.  The micro studio fit my needs entirely.  It was spotlessly clean. The neighborhood is great. Walking distance to lots of restaurants, etc.  Short public bus to Pikes Market, Waterfront, Needle etc. Great value"
7335567,42324636,2015-08-12,2203464,Tobias,I was able to meet up with Dan shortly after arriving in Seattle and check in at the studio. The space itself was clean and was pretty much ideal for what I needed for the night I was in Capitol Hill. Dan was friendly and had everything ready for my arrival.
7335567,42746589,2015-08-15,1291355,Paul,"I was in a bind looking for a last minute Airbnb apt to stay at. Dan responded quickly and made the process easy.

7335567,43820720,2015-08-22,39960123,Mark,Dan was out of town. His partner facilitated the key exchange.

7335567,47065961,2015-09-15,31738974,Rylan,Dan was a wonderful host and was very accomodating. We arrived around 11pm but he graciously walked over to deliver the keys. The place a small but it's perfect if all you need is a place to crash. It's located in modern building on a very quiet street.
7335567,47430709,2015-09-18,370979,Brian,"The apartment was just what I look for when traveling. Clean and comfortable, close to downtown and the size is perfect. "
7335567,48949338,2015-09-29,21380150,Eunsong,"the studio has most of what you need. pretty close to the downtown, and i could see the space needle from the room. pharmacy few blocks away. I would definitely visit again when i come to seattle."
7335567,50660956,2015-10-13,44039434,Vahan,"An economic and convenient location in Capitol Hill. Just a place to sleep and shower, so you can spend the rest of your time enjoying Seattle. Dan was accommodating and had the place well kept for our arrival. I would stay here again when I return to Seattle!"
7335567,50988789,2015-10-16,46295357,Samantha,Great location! The place was just as described. I had a rental and parking wasn't always ideal but it wasn't a huge deal for my short stay. Would definitely recommend!
7335567,53120967,2015-11-05,45447693,Blair,Dan was a very welcoming host. We took the bus up from Portland which made us not entirely sure what time we would arrive; he was nice to be flexible with key exchange time. The listing description was accurate. It was small but knew ahead of time it was a micro studio. Great location when wanting to stay in Capitol Hill.
7335567,53467495,2015-11-09,27623335,Nicholas,Modern and clean! Had a great stay in this studio - you can even see the space needle from the window! Dan was a great host and replied in a timely fashion. Would definitely recommend.

The studio was tidy and the beds were fantastically comfortable. The TV also has a wide range of on demand services for any rainy nights in. Dan was easy to contact and very prompt to reply. A fantastic studio in a lovely neighborhood."
4008373,19388172,2014-09-11,6600713,Lisa,"Miranda and Mike were great very helpful hosts. The apartment is lovely, clean, well maintained, with a great location. "
4008373,19798601,2014-09-18,5136929,Amelia & David,"We were welcomed by Bobby, who was extraordinarily caring and really made our check effortless! 
Miranda's and Mike's place is freaking perfect, location, location.  Its views  of downtown are amazing at any time from any part of the apartment. We loved our stay.    I was able to meet Miranda in a surprise visit, she is extra caring and friendly- Thank you for everything Miranda! "
4008373,20114727,2014-09-23,5706092,Paul,"This apartment was just great. It was the perfect size,modern and meticulously clean with a great balcony. The pictures don't do it justice.
Miranda was extremely accommodating, allowing us to check in earlier than usual because of our flight schedule.
The apartment is located only about a 5 minute walk to the central shopping district which was great. You can also catch the monorail here for the Seattle Center. 
Pike Market is less than a ten minute walk and the neighborhood has a couple of great coffee shops and a few excellent restaurants. There's also a small supermarket right around the corner. It's close enough to everything you'd want to do in town but far enough away from the noise and bustle of the tourist areas. Excellent location.
The apartment was very comfortable. Security in the building was outstanding, but that was not really a big concern since the apartment is located in such a nice neighborhood.
Next time we are in Seattle we wouldn't stay anywhere else.
Great apartment, great host. Highly recommended!"
4008373,22751456,2014-11-13,21411092,Zhihao,Miranda and Mike have a fantastic place. They were extremely hospitable and flexible with regards to our schedule and made our stay extremely comfortable. Would highly recommend.

4008373,23825864,2014-12-11,23392577,Derek,Always a pleasure working with Miranda and Mike. The place is top notch. Internet speeds are blazing fast. Which is nice.
4008373,24545564,2014-12-30,3949529,Ellen,"We had a great stay at Miranda's and Mike's place.  The location is fantastic, and the apartment is really modern and nicely furnished.  Our family of 4 was thrilled to call this place our home for the 3 days we spent in Seattle.

Both Miranda and Mike were friendly, responsive, and helpful.  They were truly great hosts, and we would be happy to stay here again."
4008373,25423471,2015-01-15,842525,Karl,"Great apartment, central location. Miranda and Mike are very responsive. We needed to extend the stay at the last minute and the hosts were very accommodating."

4008373,33550983,2015-05-29,1709346,Tracy,"My colleague and I booked Eve & Michael's place for a last minute business trip.  Eve was incredible with follow up once I booked the apartment, asking how she could make it a five star experience and genuinely wanting to make sure I had a perfect stay.  The condo is beautiful with great views, modern 'everything' and all of the accompaniments to make the stay comfortable. It's in a great location with lots of place to walk for restaurants. Parking is totally reasonable on the street or the lot across. It's an easy place to get into- just a simple elevator and you're all set.   I had a couple of questions about how to work things in the place and Eve was right on it within minutes-- the best follow up I've had in an airbnb place to date.  You have all of the elements you need with great towels, bedding and appliances, all new decor and furniture and amazing views.  I always like reading about bed quality on reviews, because airbnb beds are so hit and miss.  The beds are VERY firm almost a bit too much, but SO much better than soggy cheap mattresses!   The bedrooms have modern shades that let a lot of light in, which would be a shame to block with heavy drapes considering their view of the city/water, so if you are light sensitive just bring a sleep mask.  It's worth it to have the light the rest of the time!  Eve also gave great recos on places to order groceries and deliveries.  All in all, a great stay and I would definitely stay again."
4008373,34555284,2015-06-09,15945771,Prat,This is a great Belltown apartment with fabulous view  of the Sound and the Space Needle. Is well furnished with modern amenities. Location is perfect with all key spots like Pike' Place Market and many notable restaurants walkable. We enjoyed our stay. Host was very accommodating and helpful. Apartment was thoughtfully prepared with good instructions. 
4008373,39090063,2015-07-20,16219688,Ying,"We had a great time at the apartment.  It's beautifully decorated and Eve was very responsive and kind.  The apartment is close to all famous places, such as. Pike Place Market, Great Wheel, the Aquarium, Seattle Art Museum etc.  in the afternoon, it's beautiful to see sunset on the sea from the living room window.  There is a king bed in one bedroom and a queen in another.  And, there is even an electric piano!"
4008373,39622710,2015-07-25,33944012,Nancy,Great spot! Perfect for a family of four to enjoy the gems of Seattle. Eve made us feel right at home. 
4008373,40897604,2015-08-03,28257440,Chris,"The condo was in a great location in the Belltown area of Seattle. We loved how close we were to Pike's Place market and lots of high quality dining. 

The ultra modern style of the condo felt very luxurious and it was spacious for the five of us staying there. Keep in mind that there are only two beds and the couch does not pull out for an additional bed so someone has to be willing to sleep on the couch. The condo was also clean and ready to go once we arrived.

Eve was very accommodating and told us that we had access to everything in the condo which worked out great as we made use of their steam iron and kitchen utensils. Further, Eve was very flexible with our check-in time. We had issues with our flights and didn't arrive at the exact time we had originally agreed upon and Eve was completely fine with that and greeted us once we got to the condo.

Overall, it was a great stay and I would recommend this condo and Eve as a host to anyone."
4008373,42266588,2015-08-12,32656773,Bader,very good location 
4008373,45975135,2015-09-07,33073359,Jan,"Location of unit is great! We enjoyed proximity to Pike Place and Seattle Center.  Staying on the cusp of Belltown provides a neighborhood feel and plenty of yummy local restaurants within just a couple blocks.  Unit was exactly as pictured.  Second bedroom is quite small and furniture is squeezed in.  The closet has some problem doors and is located across the hall.  Moving around in the room is challenging.  Loved the outdoor deck, although fire pit was broken.  Female Management of unit changed three times over the course of our booking, stay and departure.  Not quite sure what that is all about.  Did receive good restaurant recommendations from owner Michael. Would love to have had Kleenex provided in the bathrooms and clear directions of where to dispose of trash. (My husband got locked in parking garage.) I'm not really comfortable with directions to not let on to anyone in building that we are using Airbnb.  We paid a premium to stay here and these instructions made us feel we had to sneak around.  "
4008373,49503681,2015-10-04,39669958,Michael,"We had a great stay, and the apartment was beautiful with stunning views.  Daniela was great, and the communication and check in/out process was simple and painless.  Would definitely stay here again on another trip to Seattle."
4008373,53143926,2015-11-05,10042488,Wyatt,"Had a good stay at Daniela's place. The place is as described, and has a great view of the Sound. Arrival and departure were seamless."
4008373,54355966,2015-11-18,4461053,Allen,Amazing view and perfect location in the heart of everything.  
4008373,54749822,2015-11-23,31753991,Darren,"This property was fantastic! The location is PERFECT for all things Seattle and the view from this place is amazing. This property was very clean, quite spacious (we were a party of 4) and came with access to great amenities (roof deck, pool table etc.) The arrival process was super easy, as was the departure. Communicating with the hosts was a breeze, they were quick to reply to all questions and correspondence We will definitely use this property for future visits.  
"
4008373,55251404,2015-11-29,11793011,Michael,"Excellent host, no complaints at all. Very accommodating and welcoming! The apartment is amazing, there was never any concerns with the lobby/doorman, in fact, we hosted a BBQ on the rooftop lounge one night with no issues at all."
4008373,57802443,2015-12-29,16471555,Nirasha,My family and I loved our stay. The accommodations were very clean and modern. Michael was an exceptional host and answered any and all questions we had. He went above and beyond in making sure our 4 year old had a perfect family vacation. Will definitely recommend this place to friends and family. Location was in the heart of it all!
7278583,47079901,2015-09-15,11039556,Charla,"WOW! What a house. I asked myself when I walked in ""is this woman crazy to rent out such a beautiful home?"" We loved this house! It was absolutely perfect for our group of 7. The location could not have been any better for us. Close to downtown by car and walking distance to the ferry but also to the cool area of Alki Beach. There are great supermarkets close by, shops, cafe's ...you name it. You don't even have to go into downtown Seattle if you don't want to. We only went to the space needle, Pike market and Filson. Besides that we enjoyed the neighborhood. Now back to Sharon and her lovely house. It was super clean and organized with directions on how to use the tv's, recycling etc you name it. There is a large den upstairs that is perfect if you have kids. There is a large screen Tv with a DVD player and Sharon has left behind some great DVDs for the kids which we all know is beneficial when you have some time to waste. Besides being clean, amazing location etc the view from our bedroom in the morning was breathtaking. We were lucky and had sun for the most part so to wake up with the sun rising above downtown Seattle was incredible. We were actually sad to leave this place. My husband now wants to move from Italy to Seattle. Enough said. Thank You Sharon for sharing your wonderful house. We really appreciate it. "
7278583,48478624,2015-09-26,44854575,Alfonso,"Sharon's place is great, a perfect location and amazing views! We really recommend this place, either for business travel or leisure, you can't go wrong. Great house for larger groups with an amazing porch to enjoy the evenings.

Sharon made the process extremely easy, I booked 24 hours before arriving and she made it seamless. Quick to respond and send accurate instructions on how to access her property.

Only recommendation would be to revise the cleaning fee since it seems a little high!"
7311407,38245664,2015-07-13,37813097,Lauren,The host canceled this reservation 19 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

7311407,48157120,2015-09-23,44804886,Gabriel,"Emma was polite and responded immediately to a phone call. The apartment was small, but if you're willing to give up laundry service, gym, pool, and other standard hotel amenities, it's certainly a pleasant experience."
7311407,49345216,2015-10-03,5628053,Ryan,"Everything in the apartment was just as described in the listing. Parking was easy, the apartment was nice & clean, all in all had nothing to be disappointed with!"

7311407,51576987,2015-10-21,46291061,Gary,"Only stayed 2 night but the place was perfect down to every last detail (they provide everything and it was high quality! Very easy check in process (but must follow all directions) This was my first trip to Seattle and I had everything (restaurants, travel,bars all with in walking distance! The building is easy access on multiple floors to hot and vibrant activities! We travel a lot and this is in my top 3."
7311407,51707674,2015-10-24,37274208,Tom,"Fantastic location, great setup.  Loved our time there and Emma was helpful."
7311407,52329526,2015-10-28,44437540,Edward,"Firstly: (website hidden)(email hidden)azing! For our interests and activities that I planned out for this trip, I cannot imagine a better situated base of operations. Overall the condo more than fit the bill and I’m very glad I chose it. But nothing is ever perfect, and we don’t learn from being told how great we are.  So I’ll include the areas I found for improvement in this review.  But don’t let that obscure the overall review: this place is PERFECTLY located and a comfortable, clean, solid choice.
Pre-trip:
Good: The instructions you sent out were just the kind of thing every guest needs and wants in order to know how things work at your place. You need to fix the distribution method, though.  It failed, even after I asked you for the info (see next paragraph).
Bad: I shouldn’t have had to nag you to get in touch with me to make sure I had everything I needed before my trip.  I needed directions, instructions for how the parking worked, and how the key exchange would be made.  When I got nervous that I hadn’t heard from you just a day or 2 before my trip, I reached out to you.  You should have already sent me the instructions by then and made sure I was good to go.
Bathroom:
Good: Great water pressure and control.  No issues other than the fixtures could be shinier. There is a homemade, eco-friendly, vinegar solution that would remove the lime and buildup. The shampoo and conditioner were very nice to see in the large Costco size. I also loved the abundance of storage areas in the shower for soap, razor, etc. All lights worked and the extra supplies and towels under the sink were spot on.
Bad: Provide soap bars.  I had to go to Target to get soap.
Get a better toilet paper holder. The spring and metal ends explode apart when removed from the bracket. There are better ones available.  Invest in one.
Better clips for the shower curtain would stop it from falling off when slid closed for showering.
Figure out some way to stop the bathroom door from drifting shut when not ALL the way open to the stopper.
Kitchen: The microwave lights (inside and out!) don’t work. Replace them.
Bedroom: That bedside lamp is pretty rickety.  Feels cheap and out of place.
General:
The front door doesn’t close all the way by itself.  We figured it would have closed completely, but it isn’t quite strong enough for that. Could be surprising to come back to that.
I wish I didn’t have to shimmy/limbo/hang on to the kitchen granite bar by the pulled out sofa sleeper mattress in the middle of the night when traveling from the bedroom to the bathroom.  Just 8 more inches would make a difference in that commute.
Your book of dining suggestions is great.  It would be even better to include examples of dishes and prices… and a map highlighting their locations.

Thank you so much to Emma for making the house feel so welcoming.  The beds were so comfortable and the place was equipped with everything we needed.  Also, the (email hidden)AZING!  Right in the middle of everything :) I highly recommend this place and will definitely be back next time I am in Seattle!"
7311407,53482089,2015-11-09,44692328,Shenny,"Emma's place was perfect for my trip to Seattle! The central location made it easy to walk to so many great places that Seattle is known for and I was able to get to any other neighborhood in under 15 minutes when driving. The parking spot in the garage across the street was a definite plus so I didn't have to deal with street parking!

Though the apartment is small, the bedroom was very cozy and the common area/kitchen were very functional for cooking and relaxing. 

Emma also had all the details thought out and I appreciated her welcome guide to give me the lay of the land without any problem. If you are planning a short trip and want to be in the middle of a great city, I would highly recommend this rental."
7311407,54430001,2015-11-20,37831058,Jim,Great place to stay!!! We walked to everything. Perfect location.
723723,2626906,2012-10-15,1351548,Andrea,"Rachelle and Bernard were fantastic hosts, very warm and inviting. Their suite is clean and comfortable and the goodies they stocked in the fridge was a really lovely touch! They are super responsive by email and the check in process was very smooth. For a quiet and calm stay in Seattle this is a great choice!"
723723,2690850,2012-10-22,894104,Suzette,"My daughter and I stayed here while visiting Seattle for a weekend and appreciated the hospitality. The bungalow was as pictured and there were instructions for everything. We felt well cared for with fresh baked cookies, a well stocked refrigerator with healthy breakfast items, even chocolates on our pillow. The place was clean , towels fluffy and lots of space and Rachelle was available when needed yet our space was private and separate with its own entrance. Only issue was wifi was only usable in the front bedroom, but we were told that so since it was a weekend it was Ok. I'd love to stay here again, just couldnt if I needed reliable internet as Rachelle mentioned that was an issue in the whole area so likely not fixable. Perfect for a vacation though."
723723,3133605,2012-12-22,3680530,Nikola,Very very kind people who made me feel home in Seattle. Nice and clean bungalow. When I arrived Rachelle had already filled the fridge with the best organic food. Thank you so much! 
723723,3399086,2013-01-22,2632979,Bj,"I had family in town and Bamboo Bungalow supplied the extra acomidation we needed. Neat, helpful folks; especially when we added a night last minute
"
723723,4695213,2013-05-20,6227243,Linh,"The Bamboo Bungalow is as exactly described and seen in the pictures. Although not luxurious, the bungalow has all the amenities to make it your home away from home while in Seattle. There's a kitchen equipped with a two-burner stove; dishwasher; sink; and the cabinets are filled with cups, plates, etc. The cabinets are also stocked with the usual condiments (i.e. salt, sugar, spices) should guests wish to cook. The host, Rachelle, is very sweet and accommodating. She provided us with organic eggs, breads, fruits, and dry foods. Rachelle really impressed us with her eco-friendly habits and this shows in the product she used. i.e. environmental friendly soaps, shampoos, laundry detergent. There's even recycling bins in the bungalow should you wish to go green. Rachelle also gave suggestions on where to eat, what to do, etc. She's very open and laidback. 

The best thing about the bungalow is the close proximity to the bus. Up a little hill (about a 30 second walk from the bungalow) is the #2 bus which takes you all the way to downtown Seattle (i.e. Pike Place Market). The bus ride is about 20-25 minutes but if you have a car, it's less than 10 minutes away. This was the main reason why we chose to stay at the bungalow.
"
723723,4987948,2013-06-05,2909927,Christine,"The Bamboo Bungalow is a nice in-law apartment in a cute neighborhood near Lake Washington. It's very close to a bus that goes downtown, but you could spend your entire trip exploring the neighborhoods east of downtown. It is very spacious --- with a large open area that includes the kitchen and living room, a big bathroom, and a small-ish bedroom. The bed was very comfortable (firm!).

Rachelle is a great host. She met us at the Bungalow, despite the fact that we arrived after 11 PM. She had stocked the kitchen with bread, fruit, yogurt, and eggs, which we enjoyed nibbling on during our stay. 

We would definitely return!"
723723,5089980,2013-06-11,2423760,Wil & Jen,"We really appreciated how helpful the hosts were in making the place baby friendly for our 19 month old. The space was nice and large, and everything we needed was provided. Even tons of extras like food, toiletries, toys and books for kids, etc. Everything was super clean, organized, and functional. There was free street parking right across the street. The only downside to this place is that as a ground level suite, the light is less than optimal and the lighting in the house could probably be increased to make it better. "
723723,5139049,2013-06-14,6604460,Emily,"The Bamboo Bungalow is a lovely spot and my partner and I really enjoyed our stay.  Rachelle and Bernard do an excellent job of providing a calm and peaceful atmosphere.  The suite is quiet, private and inviting. We were very grateful to have wholesome organic groceries provided by our hosts even though great cafes were only a short distance away.  We'd love to say again! "
723723,5189590,2013-06-17,6491960,Maria,"We loved our Bamboo Bungalow stay.  Our hosts provided an assortment of nice food and a lovely, clean, serene place to come to after our days in Seattle.  Parking was easy and the neighborhood enjoyable to walk around.  It took us a night to get used to sleeping on a futon, but the linens were cozy.  We were glad to have a washer and dryer on site.  We look forward to staying here again.  Merci beaucouup!"

723723,5328247,2013-06-24,5468040,Lia,"If you are looking for a beautiful, quiet residential neighborhood within walking distance to a few shops, cafes, and restaurants this is a great place to stay. It is a basement apartment so there isn't a ton of light, but it is very clean and cozy. We were particularly impressed with how child-friendly Rachelle has made it. One thing to note is that the bed is small and firm. There was fresh fruit waiting for us as well as tea and coffee and eggs. She even had half and half in the fridge for the coffee, much to our delight. "
723723,5374123,2013-06-26,3707387,Troy,What a lovely unit.  Beautiful neighborhood and easy to get into town and around.  Lovely walkable shopping district and parks.  Thanks for hosting us!
723723,5893502,2013-07-21,373308,John,"Bamboo is a wonderful spot in a beautiful little picturesque neighborhood of Seattle. Tasty morsels were left for us, which we didn't eat because we were constantly checking the expansive cuisine of Seattle and we only can back to sleep. The bed was great and the place was really quiet! I heartedly recommend it!"
723723,5930417,2013-07-22,4441034,Heidi,THANK YOU! The place was amazing. :-)
723723,5978820,2013-07-24,1037076,Chelsea,We loved our night at the Bamboo Bungalow. Rachelle was a wonderfully attentive host and very welcoming. The bungalow is very peaceful and in a great location. We really appreciated the warm welcome and the breakfast ready kitchen. Thank you Rachelle! We will definitely stay again the next time we are in Seattle!
723723,6032841,2013-07-27,7324968,Shirly,"We had a great stay at Thee Bamboo Bungalow! 

Our host, Rachelle, was amazing and incredibly thoughtful.  She left us delicious foods, including fruit, eggs, & fresh bread from a local bakery.  She prepared for my 2 year old with a pack n play, high chair, a box of toddler cookies, and more!  We arrived earlier than the scheduled check-in so Rachelle arranged to let us keep our bags there.   The place is already fully stashed with staples like coffee and teas, toys and books, toiletries and personal necessities, beach mats,  I could go on!  It was like staying with family, only  I don't have any family who would go all-out and do all that for me, do you???

The place itself is pretty much exactly as u see in the pictures.  There's a queen bed and two futons in the living space. 
The location was great. It's in a beautiful suburban neighborhood away from the chaos. The Bungalow is located right on the corner of a bus stop that will take u to  the heart of Seattle, so u really don't need a car (we didn't). It's also a short walk from the lake, a park, a duck pond and so much that we didn't see. 

Overall our stay here was beyond anything I could have expected for our first AirBNB stay.  We're currently on the second leg of our trip in Portland, and not nearly as satisfied.  Wish we were back at the Bungalow. "
723723,6062106,2013-07-28,7674992,Karen,"A girlfriend and I took our two teenage daughters for a girl's weekend.  We had a wonderful stay at the Bamboo Bungalow!  We ended up being much later than we originally anticipated and they made things very easy for our late arrival.  There was plenty of room for the four of us.  I don't know Seattle well, but this has to be one of the best neighborhoods.  I took an early morning walk around the beautiful old homes enjoying the architecture and flowers.  Bernard and Rachelle were gracious, attentive hosts and the little unexpected treats were great extras.  I wish we could have stayed longer.  Thank you Bernard and Rachelle!  I will look forward to another opportunity for a stay at the Bungalow."
723723,6206798,2013-08-03,7758368,Jake,"Had a great time at The Bamboo Bungalow with my family.  Stayed for 2 nights w/ my wife and two kids - host Rachelle is very generous and kind and took care of us. Located in a great neighborhood of Seattle - short walk to good restaurants, shops, parks, etc. Space was clean, comfortable, and peaceful.  Only have good things to say.  Thank you Rachelle - will likely see you again soon when we visit in the future."
723723,6329688,2013-08-08,405242,Arthur,Nice bungalow. Very spacious. Food in the refrigerator was nice. Recommended!
723723,6401955,2013-08-11,88820,Scerra,Sweet simple space in a fantastic part of Seattle. The bed was comfy and we walked to dinner. 
723723,6477240,2013-08-13,6809345,Noel,"We had a wonderful stay at the Bamboo Bungalow. The place was just like pictures, clean, good vibes, quiet. It was in a nice neighborhood called Madrona with shops, restaurants, and bus lines near by. Bernard & Rachelle were wonderful hosts, we were delighted by the local loaf of bread, eggs, and even coconut water in the fridge to name a few! We will definitely recommend this place to our friends!"
723723,6626051,2013-08-19,7555914,Ryan,"The Bungalow is great!  My girlfriend and I were looking for a nice, quiet weekend in the city without the cold, sterile environment of a hotel, and the Bungalow was perfect! Rachelle was awesome and made us feel right at home.  The local foods (berries, bread, bananas, eggs) were great and we just stayed in and made breakfast both mornings.  Great little bars and restaurants in Madison Park just down the road.  Couldn't have asked for a better location. Highly recommend the Bungalow and look forward to visiting again!"
723723,6740160,2013-08-23,7922018,Leif,"Our stay was Wonderful, and served our need-a-base-to-explore-Seattle-with-kids purpose perfectly.

Rachelle was a wonderful hostess, and had the space totally ready for our arrival.  We thoroughly (thoooroughly) appreciated the milk, eggs, teas and cereal and bananas. Oh my!

The space was clean, well maintained and fit for purpose. Double fold down couch/futon for the kids. Wifi worked for our needs, in fact all the amenities were great (stove top, microwave, dishwasher, washer dryer)

The neighborhood is totally cool to explore with great architectural diversity, and proximity to the lake was a welcome surprise, while access to Downtown and I-5 was pretty easy.  On street parking was no problem.

I'd would certainly stay again. 
Thank much! "
723723,6815996,2013-08-26,1201742,Matt,"The bamboo bungalow was great! Perfect actually. We came up to Seattle with my 2 year old son and the hosts had set up a high chair and pack n' play for us.. It was so incredibly thoughtful, really made the whole trip easier, toys too! 
Location was great and the apartment is awesome, large, great bathroom, kitchen and sleeping arrangements. Literally couldn't have hoped for a better experience.
We will undoubtedly be back!
Thanks again!!"
723723,7001352,2013-09-02,2968460,Kayla,"The Bamboo Bungalow was the perfect place for us to stay while in Seattle. It was a 15 minute bus ride away from downtown, and a 15 minute walk to great food and shops. 

The Bungalow was clean and well supplied. The kitchen is a little small for cooking gourmet meals, but we were able to cook great breakfasts. Rachelle provided us with delicious, local eggs, bread, and bananas. 

I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. It's the largest space you can get for the price."
723723,8469254,2013-11-01,2927830,Shwu Shenn,"A nice place to stay in Seattle. Photos of the place are accurate. Location is ideal esp if you have a car. Still, a bus stop is just right in front of the house.  I do appreciate Rachelle for being really accommodating and understanding throughout my stay. Book it! "
723723,9980122,2014-01-22,10935064,Ryan,"The Bamboo Bungalow is very simple & quaint - perhaps a touch rough-around-the-edges, but quite serviceable for a guy like me.

My hostess Rachelle was extremely warm, friendly, and helpful - even going to the trouble of stocking the fridge with a few food items prior to arrival.

The only 'downsides' are very mild: there is no TV, and the wifi/ cell service is a quite spotty unless you're standing in the very front of the space (i.e. by the front door).

The bed was comfy, and there are two futons and a couple other basic furnishings in the living room/ kitchenette area.  

Kitchen is tiny, but has everything you need to prepare meals, and having a washer/ dryer is a bonus!"
723723,10435057,2014-02-18,2763707,Julie,"Rachelle was lovely and the Bamboo Bungalow was an ideal place to stay. The fridge was stocked with food, and Rachelle couldn't have been more generous. When my daughter saw a cute little penguin toy there, Rachelle immediately offered it to her. It already has a special place in her room as a souvenir of our time in Seattle. We hope to stay there again next time we visit Seattle."
723723,19306310,2014-09-09,4522845,Sarah,"We loved the Bamboo Bungalow. Rachelle was a wonderful host. We felt so comfortable and at home in Seattle. She was there to greet us, showed us around the bungalow and informed us on some cool places to visit and eat. The bungalow was clean and soooo cute! We will definitely stay again when we come back to Seattle. Thanks Rachelle! :)"
723723,20616312,2014-10-02,1842023,Uliana,"Me and my son spend 2 weeks in the Bamboo Bungalow. It was a very good size for two of us. But as a basement, the place is dark and humid. I like what it was a small kitchen with all necessary things in it. We didn't meet our hosts, but they were very kind, left us a lot of food and did a quick responds for all my questions. We had problems with the internet connection and my self phone also almost doesn't work inside. The bus stop is just in front the house and it goes quite often. "
723723,22197390,2014-11-01,21226743,Murad,My stay at bamboo bungalow was amazing. The apartment is great and very cozy. The bus station to downtown is right next to the house. There is plenty of dishes and towels in the house for use. So if you are looking to have a great and relaxing time in Seattle go to bamboo bungalow.
723723,22557392,2014-11-09,23168932,James,"Exceptionally welcoming. We were given all the fixings needed to make breakfast for multiple days, and they were good quality selections as well. The place was comfortable and quiet in a very cute neighborhood. The bus stop was literally across the street and goes straight to downtown, which was very convenient. We also took Uber several times to return home relatively late (10:30-11 pm). This was a really great home base for our weekend vacation to Seattle. "
723723,24573532,2014-12-30,9351213,Ludwig,"Great apartment, great stay in seattle. "
723723,24976584,2015-01-04,24645147,Diana,"Rachelle greeted us at the door upon our arrival, and was very helpful and hospitable. She told us of the surrounding area and things to see and do there. The winter garden in the arboretum, within walking distance of the bungalow, was as lovely as she had described.

Our two nights at bungalow was very comfortable. The space is very clean, cute, and cozy, and the location is  very convenient. We walked to the Madrona neighborhood on our first night, and had some wine at an amazing little place with knowledgable staff and a great wine selection. On our last day, we went to a restaurant that specialized in southern cuisine. It was great to have such wonderful places nearby. There are also buses that go downtown at regular intervals.

I am very pleased with my experience at the bungalow."
723723,26254601,2015-02-08,5454233,Karla,"The Bamboo Bungalow was perfect for my stay in Seattle. The location was great with shops and restaurants in walking distance. Also, my hosts were gracious, generous, and helpful in every way. The place was very comfortable with every possible amenity. "
723723,29918890,2015-04-14,20123606,Amalia,"When we arrived, Rachelle greeted us and gave us a tour. The Bungalow was family-friendly and mostly child-proofed for our 1-and-a-half-year-old daughter. There were plenty of toys and board books in the Bungalow, in addition to a pack-and-play crib, potty, a hook-on dining seat, and children’s utensils and dishware in the kitchen.

Our hosts lent us a small yard waste bin to keep in the front yard outside the bungalow, which made it more convenient to empty our compost bin. Upon arrival, we requested a safe place to keep, or lock-up, our bikes. In response, our hosts installed secured hooks which we were able to lock our bikes to :).

As mentioned in the listing, the Bungalow has low ceilings (approximately 7 ft). I think I passed over this detail when reading the listing originally. My husband is 6’7” and could not stand up fully in the shower/bathtub, but overall, he didn’t mind the ceiling height. The listing photos show the furniture in the living room and office in an arrangement which was different than during our stay. We were happy with the layout though. The microwave stopped working during our visit. Rachelle brought us an electric, stainless steel kettle for boiling water, which is what we primarily had used the microwave for. To me, the Bungalow seemed darker inside than it looks in the photos.

The listing mentioned that the WiFi is not super speed, which is true—it’s pretty slow and unreliable at times. Several times during our 1-and-a-half-month stay we could not browse the internet on our desktop, because the WiFi signal was weak (our desktop was set-up on the desk in the office/futon room, which is at the back of the house). The WiFi signal was strongest in the bedroom (at the front of the house), which was inconvenient.


The neighborhood was relatively family-friendly. From the Bungalow it was an easy walk to the #2 bus stop, a duck pond, the library, a couple playgrounds and play areas, and Madrona’s shops. A little further away, but walkable if you have the time and energy, are the arboretum, and in the other direction Leschi (where there is a small but well-stocked grocery store).

723723,30814607,2015-04-27,30941201,Kristoffer,Rachelle was a gracious host whom made us feel welcomed at first introduction! Her energy and hospitality carried over into our experience at the Bamboo Bungalow. The home is exactly as described in the description. I would recommended it to anyone seeking a conveniently placed stay in the city yet tucked in a wonderful and warm neighborhood near the water!
723723,31549828,2015-05-06,7788636,Sunny,"PROS: The host Rachelle is amazing. Very warm and welcoming. She was extremely detailed during check-in. The place is very clean and the neighbourhood is one of the best that's located close to several good spots.

CONS: The unit has very low ceilings and gives a basement vibe. You can hear the footsteps and chair creaking sounds by the hosts living above. Most places have good wifi these days, although the description said there was no internet we were pleased to see they had wifi but were immediately disappointed when we realized the speed was super slow. The heating system can be a bit complicated - you need the living heater to be turned on to get the bedroom heat working. The dryer doesn't work so we had to do our laundry elsewhere."
723723,31998338,2015-05-12,3852640,Allison,"Rachelle was an excellent host for our weekend stay in Seattle. She was quick to respond and offered great info to assist in our stay. She promptly met us upon our arrival and gave us a thorough tour of the bungalow along with detailed instructions and recommendations for our stay.

The bungalow was just as described with excellent cooking and meal prep amenities as well as plenty of tools and amenities for getting dressed and ready to go in the bathroom. The bed was extremely comfortable as well as the futon option. 

The neighborhood is gorgeous and quiet and we were able to walk to breakfast, dinner and ice cream as well as a small market up the street. We also trekked down to the lake which has a gorgeous view as well.

Uber ride to downtown was about $10 -$15 and took about 10-15 minutes depending on traffic. Cell phone service was very spotty in the bungalow but seemed to work in the front room. Although it was pretty nice to be disconnected for a bit. Creaking from the upstairs unit is very audible but it wasn't too often nor was it at bothersome hours.

Great stay. thanks so much!"
723723,32545067,2015-05-19,29247625,Shelly,Love the stay! Rachelle has been very understanding and helpful! Everything's well provided for! 
723723,33368441,2015-05-27,12594662,Peter,"The Bamboo Bungalow was exactly as it was described/pictured.  A really pleasant private space with full facilities and lots of personal touches to make the place comfortable and homey.  The fridge had produce in it and fresh fruit was on offer.  Lots of coffee/tea left on hand which is great if you've just flown in.  

Rachelle greeted me directly off the bus to ensure that I found the place easily, its well connected to the city and cafe/night areas such as Capitol Hill and the lake area just a short stroll away made for lovely morning strolls.  

The bed was very comfortable and the lounge room is set up to make relaxing easy.  Cosy and warm and everything was provided with spare sheets/towels/blankets etc should you need them.  

Rachelle checked in regularly to ensure everything was going smoothly.  Check out was simple and easy with no dramas.

Thanks you guys, great stay.

Plenty of room for the four of us and all the beds were comfortable. Hope we can come back to Seattle again soon for another stayM
723723,34883728,2015-06-13,7484291,Amy,Rachelle was a wonderful host.  She met us at the bungalow even though my flight was delayed and we got in late.  She offered may suggestions of places to see that were in the immediate area.  The bungalow was cozy and tucked into a great neighborhood.  We took a few walks around the neighborhood during our visit and even walked to Cafe Flora for brunch which was delicious.  
723723,38470341,2015-07-15,8402472,Jay,Rachel is a very thoughtful and attentive host. The place has a nice vibe and a few good restaurants close by.
723723,38857205,2015-07-19,12124888,Kristina,My brother and I stayed here while visiting Seattle for the weekend and it was perfect! The bungalow was clean and comfortable and conveniently located across from a bus stop that drops you off near many of the main attractions in downtown Seattle. It was also nice that there was a little street of restaurants and shops less than a 10 minute walk away. Rachelle was kind enough to meet us and give us a tour of the bungalow when we arrived after 11:00pm. She is very friendly and gave us some great tips for places to eat and visit. Would definitely stay here again the next time I come to Seattle!
723723,40437347,2015-07-31,8052636,Bernard,"We were most graciously welcomed to an immaculately clean and spacious apartment.  Although the kitchen was fully stocked with cooking utensils, we didn't avail ourselves of that feature. Our hosts would periodically check to make sure we were comfortable, which we were."

7932696,43879371,2015-08-22,40426471,Neil,"Fantastic location close to restaurants, attractions and UW. Phillip really makes you feel at home in a pad with a great rooftop deck and a couple of skylights (not to mention an extensive CD selection). "
7932696,45851509,2015-09-06,6884566,Joel,"Phillip was a great host, very responsive and accommodating, giving clear instructions on how to check in /out. The house is well lived in, and eclectically furnished, but adequate for our needs. The living room sofa was comfy too for and the cd collection was great to peruse. Don't expect to be doing elaborate cooking, the microwave was not working when we were there either, but overall it's a great place to crash and is in a great neighbourhood."

7932696,46931903,2015-09-14,16223558,Justin,"Phillip and Jessica were wonderful hosts. Phillip responded very quickly to my messages and Jessica gave us a full tour of the apartment upon our arrival. Both were extremely friendly and gracious.

The apartment was exactly as advertised. The photography that appeared throughout the apartment was beautiful and very interesting - add added bonus. They created a very artistic and down-to-earth feel, which gave the place some great character. There is even a rooftop area to sit and enjoy a view of the neighborhood.

Towels, soap, etc. were all provided. And wi-fi. The apartment was very clean. We really didn't have any complaints at all.

The neighborhood was very residential, with plenty of trees along the sidewalks. We felt very safe at all times of the day/night. Free parking was available along the street and there is a gas station a block away, in case you need any drinks/snacks.

We walked everywhere. It was 25-30 minutes to Pike Place Market. There are plenty of lunch and dinner options situated much closer than that - anywhere from 5-20 minutes away (depending on what you're looking for).

We will definitely be staying here again!"
7932696,47753849,2015-09-21,23498854,Adam,"Great place to stay, no problems getting/leaving the key even with the home owner out of town. Walking distance to lots of places in Seattle. "
7932696,48554633,2015-09-27,42307941,Reyna,This was a great place to stay. Arranging the key exchange and checking in and out was extremely easy as Phillip was extremely responsive by both email and phone. The place was amazing and appeared just as advertised. It was well decorated and clean. The deck was beautiful and the neighborhood was great. We definitely enjoyed our stay. 
7932696,49633823,2015-10-05,42331121,Jenzie,"Phillip's place was the perfect spot for our first trip to Seattle! The location was wonderful, close to the space needle, a grocery store, and plenty of bars and restaurants. It was very clean, had fantastic music, and the rooftop deck was the perfect spot to relax after a long day of exploring. We felt right at home with the comfortable furnishings. If there was one negative it would be that the bed is so comfortable it was hard to get out of it! Phillip was very quick to respond and communication was great!"
7932696,49899062,2015-10-07,27228288,Alyssa,"Although there was a small mix up of when the previous tenants were leaving, Phillip was very accommodating and hospitable. He checked in with us once to make sure everything was going smoothly and offered booze for the small mistake. His place was homey and welcoming. The record player and collection of records was a HUGE PLUS! I left my ring at the end of the trip and he offered to send it. Would highly recommend this place! "
7932696,50296197,2015-10-11,41603675,Niall,"Apartment was gorgeous and location couldn't be better, met by the lovely Jessica who was incredibly lovely and warm, the affection and love between Jessica and phil was wove through the entire place and was fantastic to see! Deck area gives impeccable view of city, couldn't recommend more highly... Thanks guys :)"
7932696,50756029,2015-10-14,41955243,Zachariah,"This place is great! Everything is exactly as described, but with the added beauty of the surrounding neighborhood and awesome views. Phillip's communication was great, his girlfriend was super nice, and negotiating the key exchanges were a breeze. Not a single complaint.

The location of the apartment is great for walking to everywhere,  but don't forget about the hills when you get North of downtown. This is really a great spot to explore from!"
7932696,51175938,2015-10-18,28349808,Wendy,"Place is great. Better than great, actually, it was the perfect place to chill. Phillip provides simple instructions for keys, stereo, WiFi use, etc. to maximize enjoyment. Apartment is very clean and has everything necessary for a homey experience. Bed is comfy. Great neighborhood, and parking was no problem. Walking distance to everything. Best part? Hard to pick between the fantastic music selection/setup, or sunrise views from the deck. Both were amazing. Hope to stay here again! Would consider rearranging my travel dates if place was already booked. Honestly, it's that great. Highly recommended."
7932696,51726279,2015-10-24,11050335,Thomas,Very cool spot in a great location.
7932696,52237167,2015-10-27,44619980,Brennan,"I felt like this was an extension of my own home, super cozy and very comfortable.
My go to spot when we head back to Seattle!"
7932696,52830743,2015-11-02,42586688,Brian,Coffee and other cool stuff around!
7932696,53633503,2015-11-10,47282798,Steven,I loved the apartment! The vibe in there was outstanding. Everything was clean and easily labeled. The stereo + cd collection was my favorite part. 
7932696,55570250,2015-12-02,33162640,Tom,"Looking for a place to stay in Seattle, you can't do much better than this. It's in a great location, a really short walk from the Seattle Center/Space Needle/EMP Museum. The bed is more comfortable than my own. There's a kitchen, a stereo with a huge collection of music, and WiFi, although I didn't use any of that because I was away from the apartment for most of the trip. I certainly made the right decision staying here."
7932696,56187194,2015-12-10,15930701,Erin,"A little taste of home was what we were looking for and got. It was delightful to have access to use the extensive music collection the kitchen and the rooftop patio. The best part was the view from the bed, you could perfectly see the Space Needle! The bed was actually larger than I thought but it was definitely well used and a little slanted toward the middle. Not uncomfortable necessarily but food for thought if you are hoping for a hotel bed. There were cooking accouterments so that we did not have to buy a bunch of additional items to cook for ourselves. In addition, there were soap and body wash left in the bathroom for us to use which was a delightful touch. It was in a quiet location but within a short walk to fun things to do. The skylights in the living room were amazing and negated the need for lights on during the day which I love. Philip was very accommodating with our check out requests and offered us to hang out with him when we returned on our final day which I wish we had the time to do! There were jackets and an umbrella to use which saved me as I could not pack the umbrella I have for the trip. It genuinely felt like we were staying at a friends house and I would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it to others."
8065531,45352342,2015-09-01,4368897,Michelle,"Aaron is an extremely warm, helpful and accommodating guy. On the first night, despite us arriving so late, he walked us out to ensure we got a proper parking space and even accompanied us to the pizza spot nearby (which is amazing btw, it's called Hot Mama's at 700 E Pine St). The location of Aaron's crib is excellent!! We loved being at Cap Hill. It felt safe too. When we arrived, he told us that we wouldn't need to drive much and that turned out to be entirely true! We walked almost everywhere; it's perhaps an easy 5-minute walk to the Starbucks Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room, Victrola Coffee Roasters and about 15/20-minute walk to Pike Place Market which we loved for its variety of food and other products. The kitchen is pretty well-equipped and very clean. There were also fresh towels in the bathroom. The room itself wasn't particularly fancy but had everything we needed- clean sheets, comfy bed, a big mirror, hangars. We'd stay at Aaron's again in a heartbeat if we come back to visit! 

Thanks so much!"
8065531,45879796,2015-09-06,6121859,Cheeyoon,"Host was very welcoming, came out to the nearest intersection to greet and lead me to his place since I had to street park a couple blocks down. Place was very clean, hotel-like, and had all the basic amenities I could need plus washer & dryer which is a definite plus had I stayed a couple days longer. Would definitely consider staying here again if I'm in the area in the future. Location is great too, walking distance from Honey Hole and Starbucks Reserved, even Pike Place Market is a doable 30 min walk. I only wish I had parking access in the underground garage."
8065531,46338757,2015-09-09,43114810,Michael,"Aaron war hilfsbereit, freundlich und hat uns mit Rat und Tat zur Seite gestanden. Die Wohnung und das Gästeschlafzimmer waren hell und schön. Die Wohnung ist sehr zentral gelegen und man kann alle wichtigen Dinge sehr gut zu Fuß erreichen. "
8065531,47895283,2015-09-21,44228600,Stephen,Aaron was very accommodating with beverage and toiletries. The apartment is walking distance to downtown and close to many bars. I would stay here again.  
8065531,48250526,2015-09-24,42191728,Michael,I had a great time in Seattle and Aaron's place was perfect for the few days I stayed there. Aaron was a great host and was very helpful in terms of local knowledge. The apartment was close to downtown and public transport. So it was great staying there. My only issue was the parking which was advertised as free and one of my main reason why I choose the place.  
8065531,48909114,2015-09-29,41159135,Bryan,"Had a great time in Seattle and Aaron did an excellent job hosting. The room was clean, the location was perfect, and he gave great recommendations on restaurants and coffee shops to visit. Highly recommend."
8065531,49560291,2015-10-04,6396574,Sarah And Ryland,This was an excellent place to stay for my first time to Seattle. I loved that it was walking distance from really great restaurants and coffee shops.
8065531,50235451,2015-10-10,23221812,Anne,"The place is in a great location, close to many nice restaurants & cafes. I was in Seattle for work, so the proximity to the research institute was great. 
I arrived on a late train - which also was delayed, Aaron stayed up to welcome me, even though he had a very early morning the next day. "
8065531,51344034,2015-10-19,44929124,Daniel,Aaron lives in great location and was an awesome host. Everything is so close by. I used uber and everything was very reasonable and cost from 5 to 7 dollars for a ride. I had arrived to Seattle a little earlier than what i had expected and he was able to take care of everything for me. He really went out of the way to make my stay as enjoyable as possible. As well the bed was super comfortable and I was able to fall asleep in minutes. Thanks for everything brother.
8065531,52542859,2015-10-30,33608333,Gregory,Pleasant space.  Good location. Aaron was easy to contact at all times
8065531,54264122,2015-11-17,43398984,Hyun Joong,친절하고 부엌도 좋아서 음식해먹기가 아주 자유로웠다. 주차는 안되지만 Aaron이 주차비용을 40불 주어서 그 금액으로 주변 Parking lot에 주차할 수 있었다.
8065531,56408617,2015-12-13,12775501,Qiuyu (Cynthia),"Aaron's apartment was exactly as described and what I was looking for. The apartment was very clean and in an accessible spot of town, and I was able to walk everywhere (specifically the convention center, Pike Market & Seattle Center). Since Aaron was away, he had a friend check me in who was very friendly and helpful and gave lots of recommendations for places to check out in the area. Also the apartment is in a gated community which gave me extra comfort (not that it would be unnecessary since the neighborhood felt very safe). I would definitely recommend Aaron's place!"
3994601,19255003,2014-09-08,16316132,Michael,The email communication interchange was excellent & friendly! The neighborhood was spectacular. The experience was well-organized and added to the volleyball tournament memory of my weekend! They even had a jar of earplugs in case anybody needed them in the room and it was an excellent idea!
3994601,20520511,2014-09-30,21136068,Alyssa,"The Montlake area is beautiful, and just enough of a walk from the bustling Hill and Downtown districts to maintain the perfect balance of being in a city without being in a city.  The house itself is quite grand, and has that awesome vintage vibe.  I didn't get the chance to meet any of the hosts during my stay, but one can deduce that they are efficient and responsible adults.  I would definitely recommend this space for anyone who doesn't need a lot of fuss while traveling.  Thanks guys!"
3994601,22969361,2014-11-18,288188,Jt,it was alright for the time I spent.
3994601,32655021,2015-05-19,29324124,Jacob,"Very easy going. Enjoyed the view, the neighborhood, and the company. Clean."
3994601,33030534,2015-05-24,33305374,Brian,"Wonderful time, everyone was great.  The bunks were comfortable and the whole house was nice and clean.  I highly recommend staying here."
3994601,33611613,2015-05-30,32926972,Luqi,"I stayed in this place for two nights. It's a big house, more like a hostel. It's clean and really quiet on the street. People who lived in the same room are friendly. Leah is a really nice lady. Everything are organised and clean. The wifi is not really strong on the second floor, you have to  go to the first floor to get strong wifi. If you don't mind share bedroom and bathroom with others, this is a good place for temporary stay. "
3994601,34508192,2015-06-08,21098198,Lauryn,Leah and Michael were very specific with the house rules and times of check in & check out. Leah was very accessible even though she worked a lot and could only be present at certain times of day. I was very happy with how clean the house and beds were. The location was extremely remote and far away from any major sights in Seattle. I was happy with the safety and luxurious beauty in this neighborhood. The house itself was simple and bare boned which made it very peaceful. I can't wait to stay their again upon my next visit to Seattle!
3994601,34826336,2015-06-12,35139323,Paul,"Great stay!  Everything about the stay was easy and convenient.  Great host and the house provided everything I needed (clean bed, bathroom, kitchen, etc.) House was also in a nice neighborhood that was a short, 15-minute bus ride from the downtown area.  "
3994601,36233686,2015-06-26,9372772,Jay,"I had a great experience at the house. Leah was nice and very responsive. The house has a very laid-back vibe. I slept well in the bunk room, as expected. Easy, clean, relaxed - Just what I was looking for! I loved walking around town - Capitol Hill is a short walk (20 minutes) and downtown is a longer (but enjoyable) one. The next time I'm in Seattle, I'll definitely be staying here again."
3994601,36883178,2015-07-02,33940339,Tyler,"Michael was away during my entire stay, but Leah was wan excellent host. Great communication, very friendly when I met her just before leaving (was out of the house most of my stay). The house was clean, fully equipped kitchen at your disposal, multiple bathrooms with usable showers, and plenty of places to sit and relax at the end of your day. You can't really go wrong with the Crayola Home. For the price and location it's one of the better places you can stay at if you're after the social 'hostel' experience. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
3994601,37230300,2015-07-05,20637907,Alexander,Very nice stay!
3994601,38429744,2015-07-15,31892637,Christian,"Nice house, good people, quiet location (but still pretty easy to get to downtown), basically: great place to stay! :)"
3994601,39665481,2015-07-25,37487358,Raphael,At first i got an extensive tour through the impressive house and a detailed explanation how everything works. I felt welcomed immediatly and chatted a lil bit with almost every housemember.
3994601,40135657,2015-07-28,12459964,Karly,The room was perfect! It was exactly as described and in a great location. I would highly recommend staying here.
3994601,41382307,2015-08-07,6391212,Jeanine,I had a wonderful time at the Crayola House!  I felt so welcomed and there were many resources available to me.  I would love to stay again if I come back to Seattle.  3 !!!
3994601,46316114,2015-09-09,26874014,Jamie,"If you have a chance to come to the Crayola Home...TAKE IT! It's the best place for travelers that want to meet new people and really get a taste of Seattle. They were very accommodating, hospitable, and welcoming, which made my stay very enjoyable. It went above and beyond my expectations! Leah made everything you needed to know very clear. The house is in the perfect location! It's close enough for you to walk to the city, yet far enough that you're out of the hustle and bustle. The longterm renters in the house are so friendly and helpful! It has the ideal balance between quiet and social. You can go into rooms and have complete quiet and peacefulness, but also go into other rooms that are filled with conversations and meeting new people. If I'm ever in Seattle I will stay here! I made friends with the people here  and will hopefully keep in touch with them for a very long time.    "
3994601,49390725,2015-10-03,42611378,Cathleen,"as other reviews have said, this place is a delight!  everything is as stated in the descriptions.  everyone is very friendly and respectful, and the permanent/long-term residents make an effort to be welcoming and helpful to short-term guests.  there's usually people around to talk to or chill with, but the house is roomy enough that it doesn't feel cramped, especially with a ""quiet"" common area downstairs with astonishing views of the trees and lake, and the saturday night bonfires are a great, laid-back way to get to know other residents/guests, especially if you're a bit paralytically shy like me.  safeway & trader joe's are ~20min by foot, same with bars/cafes on 19th or 15th.  free laundry is always a godsend :D beds are a bit creaky (because duh, bunk beds), but quite comfy, and the privacy sheets are a nice touch (because who says blanket forts are reserved for children?!)

lovely place for the price -- heck, as long as you're not put off by shared sleeping space, it's a lovely place for any price.  my intended  1week stay ended up about tripling, and I hope to return after bouncing around elsewhere in town for a bit!"
3994601,49882059,2015-10-07,28007232,Manuel,"I enjoyed staying at the crayola home ! I stayed in the green room which has shared bunk beds. The room was clean, bathroom was clean. You also have a usable kitchen, and a nice outdoor patio with a usable fire pit. Host was very attentive throughout my stay. Would definitely recommend to a friend. It is about 25 minute drive to downtown."
3994601,53607576,2015-11-10,34010283,Meg,Most friendly AirBnb I've stayed in to date.
3994601,55017793,2015-11-27,39385003,Michelle,Had a great experience staying here for 6 days. I could see why it's called the Crayola *home* not house. The common areas are spacious / comfy and the views are amazing.
2577625,11238470,2014-03-25,4533494,Michael,The reservation was canceled 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2577625,12506903,2014-05-04,9842290,Ming,"Randy's place is exactly as described.  The location is pecfect -  10 to 20 minutes drive to everything at Seattle downtown. Parking is not to hard off the streets. And yes, kitchen's get all the gear you need if you're up to cooking.

Randy is a cool host and easy to work with.  Highly recommended!!"
2577625,12895009,2014-05-13,9580441,Chris,"Randy met us at the place and was super friendly, helpful, and accomodating. He showed us around and was available on text in the area if we had a problem. The place was quiet, in a great area of cap hill, and comfortable. The kitchen is a bit small/tight, but not a big deal. Parking in the area is a bit challenging, but not horrible. I would definitely stay again!"
2577625,13040866,2014-05-18,10836845,Darin,"Randy's place was perfect for our stay in Seattle! His neighborhood was beautiful! Walking distance to a lot of coffee shops and bars and a super short driving distance to downtown and Pikes place. The place itself was very homey and cozy feeling. It had everything we needed. I would definitely recommend. Randy was also easy to contact, via text or phone call. He was very accommodating :) THANKS RANDY!"
2577625,13475804,2014-05-28,13682518,Carson,"It was perfect! Not only was the location stellar and close to everything, the apartment itself was adorable and useful. Randy was very available and informative, and always had answers to our questions. Seattle is wonderful! You should definitely stay at Randy's apartment. "
2577625,14777364,2014-06-26,12781164,Erika,"Staying at Randy's for our first trip to Seattle was great! It's located next to the some bus lines that get you downtown, or you could walk! And it's close to Capitol Hill, another great area. The space was cozy and good place to explore from! Everything worked out great. "
2577625,16829330,2014-08-03,15152363,Drew,"Randy's apartment was a comfortable spot to spend our two weeks of summer vacation. The location can't be beat, with easy access to Capitol Hill and downtown, and it's within a five minute walk from two grocery stores (an excellent and friendly Co-op and Trader Joe's). Also, the living room couch made a nice bed for a third houseguest a couple of nights. Randy was helpful and very friendly to interact with. The kitchen's a bit tight, and apartment's a bit stuffy in the summer so I recommend bringing a fan if you catch the warmer months."
2577625,18267932,2014-08-24,19522499,Jeannie,"Randy was a great host! The place is as described: cute, clean and neat. The location can't be beat either, walking distance to all the restaurants and bars in Capitol Hill. Randy was very accommodating and kind. Communication was great and check in/out was easy. Thank you Randy!"
2577625,19837253,2014-09-19,7494296,Ben,"Randy's place is excellent. A perfect location on a quiet street minutes from all some great bars and food places in Capitol Hill. We also walked downtown in about 20 minutes. 
Parking wasn't a problem at all, and Randy printed us a map of where to park for free. Adjacent streets have all day free parking. 
The house is great with everything you could need, more spacious than the photos make out! "
1184846,5836430,2013-07-18,2957765,Sam,"Thanks for a very nice stay, Mary! The location was phenomenal and we appreciated the homey touches, colorful walls, and beautiful garden. And Happy was very sweet!"
1184846,5927334,2013-07-22,3526388,Naomi,"The place was great!  We were in town for a wedding, and although it was last minute, Mary accepted us with open arms.  The place is SO cute.  Great colors, amazing landscaping, beautiful bathroom, (with a new toilet seat, ;) )  It was clean, there were snacks in the fridge, cozy towels, bathrobes... more than you could expect from a hotel.  The location is great.  Walking distance to Fremont, (walk by the Troll,) and close to a bus line.  Mary, and her faithful and adorable dog Happy were there to greet us and show us the place, provide maps, and the phone number for a taxi.  I went into the weekend knowing that airbnb can be a crapshoot, but I would go back in a heartbeat.  We had privacy, but knew assistance was there if it was needed.  To us, travel is so much more enjoyed when you can make yourself feel at home, and we really did.  So, thank you Mary.  Hope to see you again someday."
1184846,6057743,2013-07-28,1197222,Daniele,"The house is really nice, welcoming and neat.
The location was incredibly good and Mary is super friendly and provided us help and everything we could possibly need. We had snacks, drinks, information for travel, nice and fluffy bathrobes etc.
We'd definitely go back again if we had a chance.
Thank you Mary!"
1184846,6186841,2013-08-02,5672250,Wendy,A peaceful oasis in a beautiful neighborhood.  Thank you Mary for your warm and welcoming hospitality.  The basement Casita is pretty and comfortable and the deck and gardens lovely and quiet.  Aahh.  
1184846,6257312,2013-08-05,7670558,Kimberly,"Nice space, great yard, and very friendly!"
1184846,7098850,2013-09-06,7990907,Rachel,"Great Energy in the Casita!

Mary was an incredible host! She had the casita all ready for us when we arrived, and even went out of her way to make us more at home by stocking the kitchen with gluten-free goodies knowing of my allergies. 

The apt was very clean, comfortable, and roomy. We had the privacy to use all our own (including the luxury to do laundry)! The yard was peaceful and a great place to sit and read. Beautifully landscaped!

What it doesn't say on the airbnb.com site (I didn't see it at least) is that the place is very close to the bus line so we could ride the bus easily to any part of Seattle (and straight in from the airport)! Very convenient. You'll love the Fremont, Ballard, Wallingford neighborhoods.

I highly recommend this host and this casita!! -Rachel"
1184846,7493601,2013-09-22,786142,Carter,"Had to go to Seattle on a tight turn-around and Mary was so kind to us. Her place was the best stocked, most comfortably apportioned place we have experienced.  Parking was easy and there are plenty of places to eat and enjoy in the neighborhood.  Mary is a thoughtful gracious person who took time out of her schedule to take my wife to the zoo and make sure she was entertained while I worked.  Certainly a place I would highly recommend. Thanks so much Mary."

The unit is beautiful, super clean, and close to everything the city has to offer. The garden in the backyard is a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery provided by Lake Union. Mary does a great job of making you feel like you are at home. I plan to stay here whenever I visit Seattle."

The accommodations were very comfortable.  It was like having a home away from home.  Her patio and backyard were beautiful.  We enjoyed having coffee out there every morning and loved visiting with other people living in the house.  The neighborhood was great.  It was easy to walk to most places or catch a bus to get to places farther away.  We will plan to stay there again the next time we are in Seattle."

1184846,23014085,2014-11-20,22900131,Nomi,"The house was great, clean, soft sheets, and lots of snacks in the shelves. Mary herself is one of my favorite hosts I've had in a while. She makes sure you have what you need without invading privacy, did I mention she had fresh pumpkin muffins in the table when I got in? The backyards beautiful, and happy is a great dog. I would defiantly recommend this spot, and would love to stay again next time in Seattle:)"
1184846,28279014,2015-03-21,13096314,Mary," Mary (and her fluffy companion Happy!) is the most fantastic Airbnb host that I have had, and an incredibly kind and special person. The casita is so cozy and cute, and Mary has taken care of every last detail to make it as welcoming and traveler-friendly as possible. the location is perfect- very close walking distance to gas works park, the burke gilman trail, and the quirky and artistic Fremont neighborhood. I stayed at the casita last year, and I loved it so much that I came back again this year, and I will definitely continue to return in the future. It is a peaceful, lovely little oasis in Seattle, and I would very highly recommend anyone to stay here!"
1184846,29311797,2015-04-06,23231026,Jennifer,"Mary was lovely and personally checked me into the rental. We had a great experience staying at the South Wallingford Casita, and would love to stay there again. The rental is centrally located with respect to the cute neighborhoods north of downtown, and is only a short bus or car ride away from downtown. We highly recommend this wonderful escape!"

1184846,33615903,2015-05-30,32841074,Tyler,"I visited Seattle on a short business trip and had a considerable amount of work to prepare. Mary's casita was the perfect cozy retreat for me to focus and relax at the same timed. The back yard is incredibly serene and I slept like a rock in the big comfortable bed. Moreover, Mary is the most kind and gracious host that you could ever ask for and I can't thank her enough for making my stay such a pleasurable experience. I highly recommend staying with Mary at the casita for work or vacation, you absolutely won't regret it. "
1184846,34577506,2015-06-09,895568,Marielle,"We really enjoyed our stay. Mary was easy to communicate with, helped set up a few nice touches for my husbands bday, and had a super clean and very nicely decorated place. The location worked great for us because we wanted to be by Fremont and had a car. The yard was lovely too!"
1184846,35330147,2015-06-17,34655113,Gretchen,"Mary had a basket of snacks and a bottle of wine waiting for us when we arrived. She also stopped in to see us right after we arrived to give us a tour of the Casita and point us in the right direction towards nearby neighborhoods, restaurants, and bus stops. Mary was very respondent during our stay to any questions we had. She was also kind enough to mail me the book I left behind within a few days! The location was perfect! The neighborhood was very cozy and peaceful and great to come back to after a long day exploring.  It was really easy for us to get downtown via bus and we were able to walk to Fremont. The pictures were very representative of the Casita. It really is just as cute and homey as the pictures suggest!"
1184846,35789692,2015-06-22,27663589,Rachel,"The suite was exactly as advertised - a fun, brightly decorated, clean place. The bed was very comfortable and the washer and dryer worked great."
1184846,36572747,2015-06-29,35016281,Allison,"Having traveled the world, ""the casita"" was an exceptional experience.  It is located in the heart of one of Seattle's best and safest neighborhoods, mere blocks from Gas Works Park,  the BG Trail, numerous restaurants and easy access to  anywhere in the city via public transportation. 

The accommodations were spacious and comfortable with all the amenities of home, including welcome snacks, coffee, soap, laundry detergent, maps, bus routes, walking guides, etc.   

Mary and her sweet sidekick, Happy, were phenomenal and very easy to work with.  She spared no attention to detail and truly made us feel welcome in her home.  

We can't wait to return.  "

Mary's garden, which she welcomed us to use, is gorgeous! It is simply an oasis in the city. The location of Mary's home is also great, in a quiet neighborhood a quick walk to Fremont, the UW, Gas Works Park, and much more. And the hosts, Mary and her adorable goldendoodle, Happy, were wonderful! She left snacks for us and even had little chocolates and water next to the bed when we got there. We looked forward to chatting with Mary and getting some dog love from Happy every day of our stay. This is a great place to stay where you feel right at home in a new city."

1184846,46294855,2015-09-09,13466201,David,"Mary was marvellous, greeted us with all the information we needed and some snacks that hit the spot. She was very attentive and assisted us when the propane bottle ran out at 9 pm on the bbq helping us locate the replacement. The unit is wonderfully equipped with bottle openers, plates pots and pans etc, and a neat TV and stereo system. I Would stay there again in a heartbeat any time.   "
3147706,13717732,2014-06-02,1385485,Jessica,"A perfect place from which to explore Seattle! I was warmly greeted by hosts Emily and Chris and their adorable baby when I arrived. Their attractive house is in a quiet neighborhood on a tranquil street near a huge park and light rail. It's only a 10 minute drive to the vibrant international district and 15 to downtown. The separate entrance opens to a nice private backyard with chairs for sunning. The suite was larger than it appears in the photos. Very clean and comfortable, it has a nice bathroom with shower and comfy couch. The bedroom has it's own door. A water bottle with glasses, art on the walls, and linens were nice touches. The bed is super comfortable! They provided me with their WiFi code as soon as I arrived. The entrance way has an open staircase to the upper floors for access to the kitchen. I did not end up using the upstairs. It's the kind of place you could stay for a week. The hosts were super friendly and I would come back again! -Jess"
3147706,14211372,2014-06-14,11927931,Helen,"We had a lovely time with Emily and her family. The bedroom is light and spacious and is connected to a private bathroom and large sitting room. They were able to accommodate our bikes easily in their shed. We were given our own set of keys. We were also allowed to do laundry. 

There is a fantastic local market on Wednesday where we bought some wine which we drank whilst playing board games. Chris and Emily are interesting, and well travelled. Emily gave us great tips on what to see and do in seattle. Their son  Malcom is adorable."
3147706,15478648,2014-07-09,2583541,Travis,"Beautiful location, awesome family, and everyone was wonderfully helpful. :( We accidently left a little food at their house and they didn't even leave a mean voicemail which they could have! So nice.

We would certainly stay with Emily and her husband again."

3147706,16209709,2014-07-23,4771998,Stephanie,"Emily and Chris are amazing hosts and have a clean and lovely home. It's convenient to various transit options, short light rail ride to the airport or downtown Seattle. It's in the cozy and diverse neighborhood of Columbia City, a charming location. The room, separate bathroom and entrance is great for privacy. Emily and Chris were easy to communicate with and  accessible upstairs. Check-in and check-out was clear and everything was just really relaxing. We look forward to staying there and seeing the family again."
3147706,16274737,2014-07-24,10211293,Jackie,We returned to stay with Emily at the end of our trip and had a very nice and comfortable experience.
3147706,16573333,2014-07-29,7656751,Virginia,"Staying here was one of the highlights of traveling to Seattle!! Chris, Emily and Malcolm are the sweetest people you will ever met. We had so much privacy that I almost forgot we were renting from airBnB. One of the biggest pluses was the amazing Battlestar Galactica board game and poster in the suite. Thank you for letting us stay with you!"
3147706,16846496,2014-08-03,17430267,James,"My stay with Emily and Chris in their lovely home was short but comfortable.  Their guest suite is clean and spacious. I unfortunately didn't get a chance to explore their neighborhood much since I only had one afternoon/evening in Seattle, but it seemed nice and quiet, with lots of green space nearby. It was perfectly located for my purposes, with easy access to the airport and an easy 15-20 minute drive to neighborhoods like Capitol Hill and Queen Anne."
3147706,17299633,2014-08-10,4649715,Elisa,"Emily & Chris were great, communicative hosts! Their space was clean, private, and spacious. We were able to take advantage of nearby light rail public transportation, and driving into downtown took only 15-20 minutes. They were also very accommodating with flexible arrival / departure times. Plus, their adorable toddler made us smile!"
3147706,18193079,2014-08-23,267346,Aaron,"I  only stayed one night  and the experience was great. The room was private, clean and quite. The Neighborhood has plenty of street parking right in front and the light rail isn't far. You are still a easy 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle  traffic permitting. Everything was just as described in the description, Chris and Emily where very friendly and  I would definitely  stay at there place again.. 

Cheers...  "
3147706,18335215,2014-08-25,675756,Aurora,"This very private basement space is exactly what I look for,  with a separate entrance to minimize host disruption.  The house is located next to parks,  green and lush,  very quiet.  "
3147706,18575105,2014-08-28,19871507,Lesley,"Emily and Chris are such lovely people and hosts. They were friendly and open, but I had my own space with a private entrance and as much privacy as I wanted. It is a peaceful and relaxing space with a very comfortable bed and bathroom. I loved staying with them. Wonderful location, too, close to a park and not far from Lake Washington and downtown Colombia City. Excellent experience. "
3147706,18796299,2014-09-01,16579082,Howard,"We’re very happy with our first airbnb experience.  We were in town for our daughter’s wedding.  Emily and Chris welcomed us warmly and showed us around the offerings for our 4-night visit.  The rooms and amenities were accurately described, clean and tidy, with plenty of space for our belongings. The bed is comfy and the whole space felt inviting.  There was a physio ball in the sitting room, which I used for balance practice and as a chair at times.  Emily and Chris checked in with us from time to time on how our visit was going, and to see if there was anything they could do to enhance our enjoyment of our visit.  They were easy to work with, compassionate hosts.

It is a wonderful neighborhood, with many restaurants close by.  A 5-minute walk to Geraldine’s for breakfast was a highlight, and we got there early enough that there was no waiting (often the line is out the door).  I enjoyed a bike ride along the Lake Washington Loop, which can be accessed without alarming traffic.  
"
3147706,18986418,2014-09-04,17531221,Alicia,"Great suite, very clean with separate entrance. My husband and I did not meet Emily, but her husband Chris who kindly came to pick us up at the Amtrak train station and it was 10:30p.m.!"
3147706,19148222,2014-09-07,19935732,Monica,"We stayed at Emily and Chris's during our visit to Seattle. Emily and Chris are both super kind, friendly, and open people. And their home is really clean and comfortable. There is a separate entry way, private bedroom, bathroom, and living room all on the lower level of their home.

Their home is a short walk to the Light Rail station, so it was extremely easy to get to the city. They also gave us some tips on where to go and how to get there. We had left overs from a meal and they were happy to let us store it in their fridge and use the microwave and dishes/utensils to reheat it. 

We really enjoyed our stay with Emily and Chris and would recommend them to anyone else that wants a relaxing place to rest and easy access to the city!"
3147706,20061333,2014-09-22,16722899,Rye,This place was exactly as they said it would be.  It was very clean and private.  Easy walk to mass transit and the little village.  The earplugs did come in handy but it was hardly a racket in the morning. I would stay here again anytime.  
3147706,35427962,2015-06-18,2708369,Michaela,"Emily was so lovely and accommodating! She made sure we had everything we needed for our short one-night stay. Though we could have taken the train into town, we were a bit pressed for time so took an Uber--about $13 to pile place from her place!"
3147706,35815073,2015-06-22,33225614,Patrick,"We had a wonderful experience in this conveniently located basement suite in Columbia City. Our wonderful hosts, Emily, Chris and cute toddler were very accommodating and offered advice for places to see in both Seattle and the local area. Easy commute by train to the big city, enjoyed the quiet at the end of a long day of exploring. "
3147706,39463248,2015-07-23,19918299,Erica,Thanks for the opportunity to stay in your lovely space. We enjoyed the easy access to the Link line and safe neighborhood for walking home late at night. The room was spacious and clean. It was exactly what we needed! We felt very comfortable and would stay there again.
3147706,39701469,2015-07-25,5164522,Deborah And David,"Emily and her husband was very friendly, the space is very clean and comfortable. We chat a little bit when we arrived. All went very well."
3147706,40635934,2015-08-01,19422502,Helene,"Friends and I arrived late, but the hosts were very accommodating and welcomed us upon arrival. Very clean home and nice neighbourhood. "
3147706,41196069,2015-08-05,8573224,Megan,Emily provided a nice clean space with everything we needed. It was very cozy and private. The neighborhood was cute. The light rail station was easy to find and use. I would recommend this space to my friends and family. 
3147706,41972246,2015-08-10,5507745,Anthony,The place was great and easily accessible from the airport via light rail.
3147706,42307094,2015-08-12,19062287,Mirko,"Everything was ok, but the bed was too small for 2 people. We decided to put it on the floor to stay a bit more comfortable."
3147706,42909243,2015-08-16,38599790,Nak Joon,"Emily and Chris were super awesome Airbnb hosts for my first trip to Seattle and they gave my first Airbnb experience a memorable one. They were really generous and open people willing to provide whatever I needed during my stay here and the accommodation provided at this house was amazing. The guest suite gave enough privacy with our own bedroom, bathroom, and small living room but also at the same time, we were one stair away from interacting with the hosts. The suite was very clean and was more than enough space to hold 3 guests. The neighborhood is also very quiet with a local park nearby for taking walks. I would want to come back here the next time I visit Seattle! Thank you Emily! :)"
3147706,43246780,2015-08-18,584990,Ivy,"Great, clean space with lots of room and privacy! Emily was really helpful and accommodating. "
3147706,45672780,2015-09-05,15575284,Winnie Lola,Convenient location and within 5-20 minutes driving distance of most major places and sites in Seattle. Emily and Chris are very responsive with communication. :)
3147706,46002085,2015-09-07,41115318,Gaby,"Before arriving, Emily gave timely replies to all the questions I had which greatly helps me prepare for my trip. The private basement suite was exactly as described in her listing. The neighbourhood was easily accessible and quiet. Her instructions to enter through the separate entrance were clear and easy to follow. The space was spacious, clean and had all the basic necessities that were stated on the listing. Although they have a child, the home was very quiet and we had no need for the ear plugs provided. It was a very pleasant experience!"
3147706,46455820,2015-09-10,40622266,Arta,"Great people, nice place, awesome experience in every way."

3147706,47224558,2015-09-16,6985109,Geoffrey,"Emily's family was very accommodating of my last-minute request. The basement apartment was a good value, being clean and the house a pleasant walk to the light rail station, taking you downtown in about 15 minutes."
3147706,47378785,2015-09-18,39666662,Andrew,"This place was quiet, cozy, and simply perfect for resting your tired bodies after traveling. Chris and Emily were both wonderfully accommodating and considerate hosts. Very friendly people and provided excellent recommendations around Columbia City. I would stay here again and recommend it to family and friends."
3147706,47809713,2015-09-21,42847668,Tiffany,"My boyfriend and I had a nice time staying with Emily and Chris in their cozy home. The listing is very accurate and it wasn't too bad of a walk from the Light Rail. I found their directions on how to get to their place (from the airport) using the Light Rail, to be very helpful. The separate entrance also gave our stay a more private feel. "
3147706,48397089,2015-09-26,39194074,Cindy," Great place!  Cute neighborhood of Seattle, near the light rail which is cheap and easy to take- Very clean, comfortable place- separate entry for privacy, and nice people.  I'd definitely recommend staying here."
3147706,48919085,2015-09-29,43315271,Lina,"Great hosts and a great space! Our stay was just two nights and since we spent most of our time out exploring the city, we had little chance to interact with Emily & Chris. Even so, they were very friendly and provided us with everything we needed. 

Being able to get in and out via the private side entrance was a great plus because Emily & Chris have a toddler and we would've hated disturbing his slumber. :) Tip: If you enjoy sleeping in or are a light sleeper, definitely take advantage of the earplugs that are graciously provided! 

Overall, I highly recommend this place if you're looking for a spot in the area. Columbia City may seem far from main attractions, but Emily & Chris's home is conveniently located by the Light Rail, which makes getting to the airport and downtown easy-peasy (especially during rush hour!)"
3147706,49169926,2015-10-01,38490041,Lei,Good place. Chris and emily are easy going people. The house is very clean.
3147706,49496200,2015-10-04,1868054,Shahaf,"My parents and sister stayed at Chris and Emily's place.  The location was convenient (they were visiting me in Beacon Hill).  The space was clean and comfortable.  There are some gorgeous travel photos on the wall (e.g. Easter Island).

The only downside was that my parents were woken up by Chris and Emily's toddler in each of the two nights.  Sound travels easily to this space in the daylight basement."
3147706,50046214,2015-10-08,32721254,Becky,"I booked Emily and Chris's space for my husband while he was in Seattle on for a couple of days. He said the apt was spacious and fairly private, with a living area, bath and bedroom. The private entrance was a plus. Both of the hosts were friendly, accommodating, and responsive to questions and requests. The area is in the edge of a large park which eventually leads down toward Lake Washington, so it's a good walking area and close to things like Starbucks, drug store and places to eat. Overall a great choice of a place to stay!"
3147706,50371587,2015-10-11,45475130,Gayley,"Very brief stay at Emily's (I was on a very specific visit where I only slept in the guest suite, but otherwise was away visiting family)  - the listing is accurate, and she provided all the needed info to access her place successfully.  I imagine if I had stayed longer, I could have taken advantage of her hospitality and area expertise  Guest suite is a residential section of Seattle that has a great selection of ethnic restaurants."
3147706,52471791,2015-10-29,2013451,Mary Lee,"I love rocks and this is a rock surrounded house extraordinaire. Check in was easy, and bless Chris for hauling my big suitcase up and down the steps for me. The bed was comfy, and I gave thanks that I can still hear the pitter patter of  wee Malcom's overhead steps in the morning. I enjoyed use of the refrigerator and freezer as I had another four days of traveling afterwards and needed my special food kept cold.."
3147706,52743043,2015-11-01,36480234,Janet,Emily and Chris's place was exactly as described and a perfect fit for my long weekend visit with friends in Seattle.  I was very comfortable staying here! 
3147706,53072026,2015-11-04,34390207,D J,"Emily and Chris were the perfect hosts, and the room and additional space is exactly as described. The location near the Columbia City Light Rail station and the village area of Columbia City is perfect for my needs as I travel to Seattle quite a bit on business and use public transportation. Thanks Emily and Chris!

Also, only about a quarter mile to the light rail (convenient if you're coming from the airport). Amy was a great host and accommodated us well. The place was recently remodeled with brand new furniture. Ear plugs are a must for light sleepers. The floors are quite squeaky and you can hear the people above walking around. Nonetheless and I can't stress this enough; location was prime and totally worth the price! Thanks Amy!"

Amy was super easy to interact with and check in/out with her was very simple. If I ever go back to Seattle, I'll definitely want to stay here again."
