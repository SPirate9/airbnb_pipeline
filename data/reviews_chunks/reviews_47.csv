1321090,13529570,2014-05-30,5310838,Gabriela,"The apartment was lovely and very comfortable. Serina thoughtfully provided pastries, coffee, and movies, the bathroom was well equipped with towels and extra toiletries. We were in town for a concert at the Key Arena, which is conveniently just a block down the road. We couldn't have picked a better place for our short stay!"
1321090,13910024,2014-06-08,1671734,Sasha,Serina was great! She was very thorough in her emails and had a guide book with a lot of information at the house. The place was clean and had all the shower necessities needed. I would wholeheartedly recommend staying here!
1321090,14072171,2014-06-11,2885037,Chanah,"Serina's place was nice, clean and in a convenient location. There were several thoughtful touches -- a few DVDs to watch, a coffee maker in the apartment. And the pastries left for us were a pleasant surprise!"
1321090,14187884,2014-06-14,14699265,Kevin,"Wow, our first experience with airbnb and we picked a winner. The apartment fit our needs perfectly for a three day stay. The listing information on airbnb was exactly what we found upon arrival; a clean, comfortable, safe and central location right on the edge of downtown. As the listing clearly stated, there was ample public parking available including free overnight on street parking but it took some effort to figure out where the deals were for day time hours. 
High recommendations from us and we hope to return in the future.
Kevin and Ginny"
1321090,14271012,2014-06-16,3656709,Bryan & Mark,"Nice, clean apartment with (surprise) washer / drier. Great access to Seattle Center and Lower Queen Anne. Thin walls. Bring earplugs. "
1321090,14389321,2014-06-18,3646331,Holly,"Serina was a lovely host. She was available to show us around.  This apt was fantastic.  Coffee pot, washer dryer, tv, bluray player.  The beds were very comfortable. The apt is located 2 blocks from the space needle, IMAX theater, Chahuley museum and more.   Up the block are a variety of wonderful restaurants and a grocery store with prepared foods.  A wonderful place to stay."
1321090,14490244,2014-06-20,4000685,Rick,This was perfect for my short business trip to my corporate HQ in Lower Queen Anne. Very comfortable.
1321090,14597295,2014-06-23,7300868,Lauren,What a great apartment and the location is unbeatable!! Serina was easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Highly recommend this great spot!
1321090,14739172,2014-06-25,14949587,Robyn,Serena's place was nice and clean and had everything we needed. Serena was there immediately when we had a question.  The location was perfect - quiet and a quick walk to downtown.  I would definitely recommend staying there.
1321090,14904039,2014-06-29,12544567,Agnes,"Serina was a super nice host, easy to communicate with, welcoming us with yummy pastries and very helpful with infos about the city, the neighborhood and her place.
The apartment was awesome, very clean, and superb equipped (including a Keurig coffee maker, washing machine and dryer + detergent, dishwasher + soap, huge fridge w britax filtered water, ironing board and iron as well as all kitchen and bath basics one needs).
The location was excellent, walking distance to all major sights. We would definitely stay here again. Highly recommended to everyone!"
1321090,15446353,2014-07-09,14167102,Andrew,"A very nice spot that was indeed just minutes away from Seattle Center.  Not a bad walk and an easy bus ride to downtown.  Checking in and out was a breeze.  Clean and comfortable.  Thanks very much, Serina!"
1321090,15551962,2014-07-11,15606083,Laura,"We had a great experiences staying here. The space was comfortable, clean and Serina definitely pays attention to details—everything we could possible need was there. 

It is very worth it to stay downtown and within walking distance to so many great things. "
1321090,15900991,2014-07-18,6567709,Patricia,The apartment was so convenient to Seattle Center and enjoyed waking up to a view of the Seattle Space Needle.  We loved the keyless entry and the folder with instructions and recommended areas to shop.  We had a wonderful stay.
1321090,16015821,2014-07-20,14810324,Lewis,"Serina accomodated our early arrival and allowed us to store our luggage until she prepared the Inn for our stay.  The property was roomy, extremely comfortable, and contained a washer/dryer combo that was so much appreciated.  Serina also provided a few small but noticeable touches: she provided us danishes, coffee, soap, shower gel, and laundry detergent.

The Queen Anne neighborhood and proximity to the Seattle Center allowed us to quickly walk to many attractions and we just discovered many memorable gems such as the local grocery store and local eateries.

When we return to Seattle, we'll definitely try to make a reservation at the Seattle Center Inn."
1321090,16240005,2014-07-24,10824003,Michael Kevin,My family and I had a great time at Serina’s place. You could not possibly get a better location. Everything in the apartment is new and spotless. I would recommend this apartment to any of my friends. 
1321090,16454933,2014-07-28,2866744,Vanessa,"Serina was easy to get a hold of through messages on Airbnb and then upon our arrival through text messaging. She was friendly and attempted to clean the apartment quickly between her last guests and us so that we could check in a bit earlier as we requested. The parking space is a bit tight if there are 2 cars but at least there is a parking spot if needed. The immediate neighbourhood didn't have too much to offer, but a walk to 1st and the market was not too far away and quite nice. The space in the apartment is ideal for a couple and maybe another guest on the pull out. The bathroom is quite clean and comfortable and Serina provided a good amount of towels and basic toiletries for convenience. The queen bed is comfortable and clean with nice bedding. The kitchen had all your basic neccesities and items appeared clean. Overall the apartment felt older but easily meets the needs of travellers who are looking for a simple and clean place to stay about 15 minutes from Pike Place Market. "
1321090,16650918,2014-07-31,12938955,Miranda,Serina is a great host and we definitely enjoyed our stay in the apt. She kindly lets us to drop off our luggage due to our early arrival. She is generous to accommodate our needs during the stay. The apt is very nice and clean and has a lot of amenities. It is also in a nice location. We walked to all our point of interest. Will definitely recommend to stay.
1321090,16970059,2014-08-05,11601274,Rebecca,"A wonderful little apartment that was perfect for myself and my two girlfriends. Great location, with a grocery store just a few blocks up the road which helped us save money on eating out. The kitchen was well stocked with cookware and there was complimentary coffee! We didn't get a chance to meet Serina while we were in Seattle but whenever we had any problems or questions she was quick to answer our texts and phone calls. There is street noise and you can hear the upstairs neighbors but it was nothing too disturbing, what you would expect from downtown apartment living. The apartment doesn't have A/C which I hear is common for Seattle. Serina happily supplied us with fans so that we could be more comfortable. Really a very lovely experience and would definitely recommend this place. Our first airbnb experience did not disappoint! "
1321090,17105179,2014-08-07,11356774,Kelley,"Fantastic location and we walked everywhere or drove to fine dining at night just a few minutes away. Clean, comfortable bed. Would stay again."
1321090,17443497,2014-08-12,16869658,Tessa,"We came in fairly late from the airport (with public transport) and found a real 'home' (spacious and ground floor) at Seattle Center Inn. It is close enough to various activities to make it a nice place to discover Seattle from, but it is a walk and a search (for restaurants) sometimes. The good coffee (and sweets) was appreciated! Also the washing machine (with non fragranced powder) was for us a nice treat, having been on the road for a week already. Thank you for a nice stay."
1321090,17555143,2014-08-14,14763007,Loic,"Everything was perfect in Seattle ! Serena's place was just as nice as described, super clean and welcoming ... and loved the croissants ;)
Moreover the location was fantastic!
Thank you Serena."
1321090,18049529,2014-08-21,1580340,Ryan,"This place was simply awesome and I am really glad we found it. 

The location is amazing. It is right by the Space Needle and in walking distance of the Public Market, ferries, and much more. 

Our host, Serina, had everything ready for us that we could possibly require. Our stay was short, but the kitchen had all one would need for a longer stay. 

Simply put: great host, great location, I hope to return!"
1321090,18780174,2014-09-01,4085188,Melissa,"Working with Serina was an overall friendly and great interaction! Her apartment was SO close to Seattle Center, which was prime for our Bumbershoot weekend. The place was clean and tidy upon our arrival--Serina even had pastries waiting on the counter for us! I would absolutely recommend working with Serina for a great Seattle get away"
1321090,18943869,2014-09-03,5342130,Michael,"Excellent location, amazing view of the Seattle Center from the window.  Very roomy, comfortable, quant.  Super nice and communicative host who was very accommodating."
1321090,19049585,2014-09-05,3330830,Or,"My wife and I had a great time staying in Serina's place! The location is so awesome, we didn't even have to use the car we rented. Serina greeted us outside right on time and directed us to our parking spot. She was very friendly and welcoming. The place itself was exactly as pictured, very clean and very comfortable. We had everything we needed, including toiletries, tons of attraction brochures, a coffee maker and even some sweet treats Serina had left for us. Our all around experience was very enjoyable. We would definitely stay at Serina's the next time we're in town. "
1321090,19197417,2014-09-08,14862486,Sarah,"We enjoyed our stay here! The apartment was clean and tidy and in a very convenient location.

The coffee machine and pastries were a lovely treat when we got in, and having a washing machine and drier was so handy!

Being pregnant I really appreciated having a hot bath to come home to after walking around all day in Seattle! 

Would recommend this apartment! Serina was very easy to deal with and always replied really fast to our messages. "
1321090,19417822,2014-09-12,19473364,Malena,"Apartment was as described and pictured. We found the location really convenient and the parking spot was easy to find and park in. Serina met us when we arrived and showed us the apartment. We were only in the apartment to sleep, bathe and do laundry, which was all comfortable, convenient and easy! Serina was a gracious host, answered all my questions and even found a restaurant I was looking for. This is our first airbnb experience and we really enjoyed it. When we return to Seattle we will likely rent this apartment again of its available. I should note that you can hear street traffic in the room with the windows open but we used to live in a city so didn't bother us."
1321090,19510214,2014-09-14,10833956,Natalie,We really enjoyed staying at Serina's. It is centrally located just a few minutes walk from the Seattle Centre. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. The only slight drawback was the road noise. 
1321090,19685119,2014-09-16,19863416,Gretchen,This location is perfect for exploring SEA! We walked up the hill for brunch aToulouse Petit. Jumped on a bus to Ballard and took the monorail downtown. Oh. I cannot forget the space needle and Chihuly exhibit two blocks away! Serina was gracious and the apartment had everything we would need! It was clean and well -appointed. We would stay again and again.
1321090,19832403,2014-09-19,18213443,Lauri,"Serena's comfortable apartment just blocks from the Space Needle was everything we wanted and needed for our visit to Seattle! Serena was an easy-going host: she was even able to have everything ready for us for an early arrival, which I appreciated very much!
The apartment is everything you need for two people to be very comfortable and four can even make a go if it, if you don't mind using the couch/living room that way. 
Location is perfect for walking all over the hills of Seattle. 
Thanks Serena!"
1321090,19918965,2014-09-21,11136121,Tim,Initial problems with entry code. Overall Ok however did not have any real interaction with Serena. Accommodation dated but clean.   Some minor repairs to blinds etc required. Location was good for access to the needle but on a busy street.
1321090,20105802,2014-09-23,19130022,Jessie,"We had a great stay at Serina's place! The accommodations were nice, clean and comfortable and the photos were representative. Walking distance to many attractions in Seattle and great dining options. Would recommend highly! "
1321090,20256623,2014-09-26,20398830,Renee,"Wonderful, wonderful. Location was great, apt was great. The host was great. This is a wonderful location. Walking distance to all the main attractions. The apt was clean and organized. Bed was comfortable with nice linens and comfortable pillows. The bathroom was clean and well stocked. The coffee and even delicious pastries where appreciated. 
Sernia was available for sharing the neighborhood information and any other questions we had. 
The washer/dryer where a plus but they did take a very long time to wash and dry so plan ahead if you plan on using them. "
1321090,20355589,2014-09-28,20584372,Ruth,This was my first AirBnB experience and it was wonderful. Serina was great at timely communication beforehand and was there to greet us in person when we arrived. The apartment was perfect for our needs. It's basic and simple yet very comfortable. She even had it stocked with items commonly forgotten while traveling - a disposable razor as one example. Next time we go to Seattle we hope to stay here again!
1321090,20610250,2014-10-02,20586943,Benjamin,"Host did a great job making the Seattle Center Inn like a home away from home. Very clean and full of amenities like (WiFi--dishwasher, washing machine, and fans) Comfortable bed and convenient parking nearby.

Really appreciated the proximity to the Seattle Center and the Monorail was super close allowing easy access to the downtown sites. Highly recommend to anyone wanting a quiet place to stay in Seattle. 

"
1321090,20906703,2014-10-07,6169963,Jessica,"Staying at Serina's Place was an absolute pleasure. The apartment was immaculate, exactly as described and perfectly located for easy walking to downtown, surrounded by nearby neighborhood restaurants and close to easy bus routes to any location you wish to see.  My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend and when last minute plans changed and my brother was added to the stay, Serina made an extra bed while we were out, washed our towels and tidied up the place.  She even provided the most wonderful comfortable slippers for each of us!  I 100% recommend staying here for your visit to Seattle.  We will be back!"
1321090,21286043,2014-10-14,20337919,Amber,"The unit is light and bright, and the space is used well. The location is great, easy walking (i know the city well) or a quick cab to everything. The host was great, accommodating - kept my luggage after checkout before my flight."
1321090,21410915,2014-10-16,18492801,Ned,"Fantastic apartment that exceeds expectations! Even better than the pics! Serina was easy to find and very accommodating. The place is clean, comfortable, totally awesome and in an awesome location close to all the joys of LQA. Highly recommended."
1321090,21587600,2014-10-20,1156443,Kerstin,"I had such a great time in Seattle and Serina's apartment was absolutely awesome: Spacious and clean, had everything you could desire, the bed was huge and comfy, and seeing the Space Needle from the window was truely amazing! The apartment is in a great neighbourhood and it's only a short walk to the Space Needle. Bus service was great too and also being so close to the waterfront!
Communication with Serina was friendly, quick and easy, she even let me in early to drop my luggage. Thanks for letting me stay at your place, Serina! And thanks for those yummy cinnamon rolls, too!! :)"
1321090,21728569,2014-10-22,18492801,Ned,Such a great place! Exactly as advertised and in a fab location. Second time here. Love it!
1321090,21874942,2014-10-26,380292,Jeannie,"Serina's place was perfect for my needs.  I stayed at her apartment for four nights.   I loved the location and the apartment.  I slept well on the comfortable bed.   I had everything I needed and was happy to even be able to get a load of laundry done.  Serina kindly helped me out when I had difficulty opening the inner door of the unit on the first night.  It turned out it was user error as I had never seen a door lock that functioned that way.   Otherwise I didn't see her, but it was nice to know that she was readily available and willing to assist in a time of need.  "
1321090,22230595,2014-11-02,20237581,Arete,"The Seattle Center Inn was exactly as described - a cozy space moments from the best that Seattle has to offer. We enjoyed the apartment, especially in that we could get to all the major city sights very easily. The Space Needle was literally our nightlight! The apartment was clean and comfortable, and Serena was kind enough to let us drop off our bags when we arrived (as it was before check-in). She also left us fresh cinnamon rolls and coffee/tea things. Although we never actually met her, she was available by phone/text for any questions that we had. I would recommend staying here if you ever visit Seattle :)"
1321090,22623473,2014-11-10,13701370,Rachel,This place was perfect! Amazing location and had everything we needed. Serina was there within minutes when I asked her how to adjust the heat otherwise we were to ourselves. She left us coffee and yummy pastries on our arrival. If definitely recommended staying here and I'd be more than happy to stay at Serina's for my next trip to Seattle. 
1321090,22745842,2014-11-13,166155,Barbara,"There was plenty of information about accessing the lodging and she always answered her phone and email promptly. The neighborhood is ideally located near Seattle Center, many restaurants and the waterfront. The lodging was clean and had all the basic amenities, plus a few more. We enjoyed our stay and would stay there again."
1321090,23042777,2014-11-21,23186782,Michael,"Great location! Walkable to the space needle and monorail which takes you down to Pike Place. Also walkable to Crossfit Bellevue for you Crossfit nuts wanting to workout on your vacay. I thought this was a warm and cozy space. This was my first airbnb experience and it smooth as butter. Easy in, easy out. Thanks Serina"
1321090,23204032,2014-11-25,5383268,Megan,"What an amazing apartment! Everything is so well thought out, all amenities are provided, from lovely sheets, bedding, towels and pillows, to a fully equipped kitchen with a coffee machine and coffee pods. Serena was nice enough to buy us a couple of pastries for breakfast which was lovely. The apartment is in a great location, easy walking from the monorail, restaurants, bars and Pike Street. I would highly recommend staying here!"
1321090,23430306,2014-12-01,21332376,Laetitia,"Serina was very nice, even if we never met her, she always answered email very fast and made sure everything was ok. The apartement was very nice, it had everything we needed and even more. We could actually see the Space Needle from the living room window. The apartment is within walking distance of a lot of atractions (Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, Seattle Center,...). As for the other places, Serina left in the living room a schedule of the public transports as well as explanations on which line to take and were to stop. It was my first time using Airbnb and it couldn't have been better. Serina even left delicious pastries in the kitchen as a welcome gift. They were delicious. We had a great time there. "
1321090,23575096,2014-12-05,23532690,Ruth,Serina has a very cute apartment that is in close walking distance to everything we wanted to see in downtown Seattle. It is close to the bus stops we needed to go elsewhere. This was our first airbnb experience and we were very happy with our experience. We highly recommend Serina's place!
1321090,23630615,2014-12-07,10558467,Victoria,"Serina was an exceptional host. She communicated very promptly with us upon booking and when we had questions right before we arrived in Seattle. We loved this place as soon as we stepped foot in the apartment. It was well-lit, very clean, and clear that much care was given to ensuring a comfortable stay for guests. There were pastries and options for Keurig coffees waiting for us on the counter, too! The bed was very cozy and the towels were fresh, fluffy, and clean. It is so close to many fun attractions that Seattle has to offer so we were able to leave our car parked there and walk everywhere. We absolutely adored this place and would not hesitate to come back! "
1321090,23914112,2014-12-14,23856352,Doug,"Serina definitely knows how to treat her visitors like guests in her home. Even though I never met her I frequently had questions that I submitted via email and always got an answer immediately. It was very comforting to know I wasn’t completely on my own in Seattle even though I was travelling solo. 

With respect to the apartment everything was great. Getting in and out of of the apartment with just a key code was very convenient especially since I arrived late and didn’t know how I’d receive the key. Serina put my mind at ease and “check in” went smoothly. The apartment itself is well laid out with a TV area, a kitchen and dining area, and a lovely bedroom with a comfortable queen sized bed. The bathroom is clean and the shower contained completely filled shampoo and liquid soap dispensaries. 

As a tourist the location was really convenient. I never took any buses since many major destinations were within walking distance -- Seattle Center (ie - Space Needle, EMP Museum, and more), Pike Place Market, Pioneer Square, and plenty of ferries to local islands such as Bainbridge.

Overall, I couldn't have been happier with my first experience using Airbnb. Serina deserves all of the positive reviews she has received and if you're ever visiting Seattle you would be in good hands if you stayed in one of her rooms.
"
1321090,24028125,2014-12-17,9417456,Maricel,This is the most legit place to stay while in Seattle. It literally is your own home for the duration of your trip. What you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. An amazing view of the space needle from the comfort of your own (temporary) couch and a 5-20 minute quick walk to great tourist-y sites. Serina is the best! I'm sure my boyfriend were pretty needy unintentionally but she was flexible to our needs. I would definitely stay here again! 
1321090,24188353,2014-12-22,3683433,Chris,"Serina has certainly accomplished her intention; “to present a clean and comfortable living space for people to come and stay and get to know the city.”  The location couldn’t be better and the little apartment (ground floor, south side) was clean and very comfortable.  Serina offered a gracious welcome and answered all of my questions.  I hope to stay at the Uptown Inn again soon and will definitely recommend it to family and friends."
1321090,24328979,2014-12-26,22631095,Maryia,"I stayed in one of Serina's flats for three days this December. My experience was extremely good. The flat is located in a very convenient location with all touristy places in a walking distance. Plus you get a nice selection of shops and restaurants/cafes/bars nearby. The flat was spacious, clean and had everything necessary for a comfortable stay.  Though I did not get to meet Serina in person, she made sure that I had all necessary information on hand before arriving to Seattle. She also kindly texted me as soon as the flat was ready for check in.  I would defintely stay with Serina if I had to travel to Seattle again."
1321090,24818706,2015-01-03,18644865,Greg,"Our apartment looked like it does on pictures here on airbnb. The apartment is located in a small two story building and was facing The Space Needle, which was very nice. There are two parking spaces in between the buildings which you need to ask Serina to reserve for you ($5 a day). The apartment is conveniently located close to Downtown Seattle and has all amenities that one might need to stay during their visit.   "
1321090,25032659,2015-01-05,9468824,Virginia,Description was accurate. Serene was very communicative and responsive  to our needs. Location and apartment were tourist friendly. Neighborhood was a bit run down but perfectly safe and convenient to top tourist sites and transit. Definitely recommend for the budget concious traveler. 
1321090,25590846,2015-01-20,15337187,Bonnie,"Staying at Serina's was a wonderful experience. It was my and my friends' first time using AirBnB - Serina answered all my questions in a very timely manner and allowed for an early check-in to accommodate my flight. She also made sure the futon was all set up for us (we had three people staying in the apartment). She gave wonderful recommendations to a couple of local eateries in Queen Anne; my friends and I were very impressed and thoroughly enjoyed the eateries. While I didn't have a chance to meet Serina during my stay she was easily accessible by phone/text. She even double check that her stand-in delivered some pastries. 

I would recommend Serina's place - great location and great host. "
1321090,25716267,2015-01-24,25045055,Cynthia,"My sister and I had a good experience here. Host came and greeted us after we entered and got settled. The apartment was spacious, comfortable and as described. Great location, walking distance to many attractions. Would love to stay here again. "
1321090,25925408,2015-01-30,14886230,Ian,"Simple, basic, clean & comfortable... and perfect for our needs. 

Just to be clear, this is not a resort. It is not lavish nor luxurious. But that is not what we were looking for. We needed a place to hang our hats and rest our heads, and for the price (half of what a nearby hotel would have cost) it was exactly right.

Centrally located to Space Needle & Queen Anne.

We will stay there again and will recommend to our friends."
1321090,26024677,2015-02-01,19876905,Franklin,"Serina is an amazing host. She's quick to respond and was super nice. She provides clear instructions for everything from getting to the house and how to use everything in the house. Though the check in time was at 4, we were able to drop off our luggage at 12 and explore the city which was very convenient. We came to Seattle to celebrate my gf's birthday. We mentioned it in passing and Serina was so sweet and bought us some pastries without saying a word. That was so heart warming. 
The place itself was nice. There was everything from kitchenware, an air purifier, a washing machine, pretty much anything you might need. She even provides laundry detergent for you. 
The location is great too! 15 minutes from pike place via bus, a 10 minute leisurely walk to the space needle, emp museum chihuly garden, pacific science center. It's a great place to stay for anyone who wants to explore the city!"
1321090,26219673,2015-02-07,25621726,Virginia,This was a nice getaway from using a hotel. It was fairly close to everything.  My BF and I did a lot of walking (not having a car and all) but it was doable.  The house is really easy to find and it had all the fixins. I would definitely try air b&b again. This was our first experience with using it and we were not disappointed.
1321090,26480760,2015-02-14,14566979,Kellye,"We had a wonderful experience. The apartment was exactly as advertised. The location was perfect. We could walk to so many attractions and good places to eat. The apartment was impeccably clean, well appointed, and smartly thought out. The best thing that I can say is that whenever I am in Seattle next, I know where I am staying...no question at all. "
1321090,26742491,2015-02-18,25915317,Iris,"Checking in was very convenient~ The location is perfect, just five minutes walk to Seattle center and we actually walked to downtown area and waterfront. The apt is nice and clean as pictured. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. The kitchen has everything we need. The shower, wifi and heater/radiator are all great~ I will recommend this listing to my friends. "
1321090,27276156,2015-03-01,12387737,Kathy,"Serina was very welcoming. She met us when we arrived, showed us in, and addressed any questions we had. She even gave us welcome pastries. She was quick to respond anytime we contacted her for any reason. The location was excellent and close to major tourist attractions by walking/biking. The unit was clean and spacious. The only issue we had was our neighboring tenant who rang our doorbell in the late morning due to noise complaint and thin walls but this was out of Serina's control and we didn't violate any house rules."
1321090,27445999,2015-03-04,14654667,Katie,"Serina was so sweet and greeted us upon arrival (and even left a welcome box of delicious baked goods from Macrina)! She accepted my request to book the RSVP with just a week's notice and provided excellent instructions for everything. For just my friend and I, the apartment was perfect: space-wise/comfort, laundry machine available and close to everything. We rented a car (highly recommend Flight Car) to get around but as the other reviewers noted, you can walk around or bus it easily to nearby eateries and attractions. This was my first visit to Seattle and I will definitely stay here again the next time I'm in visiting!!"
1321090,27758694,2015-03-11,25910697,Rita,The place was very nice and looked just like the pictures. The neighborhood was very convenient. Would definitely stay there again.
1321090,27999975,2015-03-16,9308452,Sam,"We loved our stay here. The place is very comfortable and quite large.  The place was absolutely perfect for our needs and Serina was extremely welcoming and responsive.  The location is awesome - quick walk to Seattle Center and Space Needle.  Lots of bars and restaurants right nearby and within walking distance.  Serina really has thought of it all - there is a Brita water system in the fridge and a Keurig coffee maker with lots of K cups to choose from.  I think my favorite part was the delicious pastries she brought us upon arrival. It was really enjoyable to drink coffee and eat almond croissants our first morning - made it feel like vacation.  

I'll definitely stay here again next time I am in Seattle and would recommend this location to anyone visiting! "
1321090,28268578,2015-03-21,20657519,Deborah,"The apartment was just as pictured, very clean, and in a good location very near Seattle Center. "
1321090,28468067,2015-03-24,26448989,Amy,"Absolutely loved staying here all thanks to Serina! The apartment is exactly what you see in the pictures. The apartment was quiet and literally had everything you would need (such as oil for cooking, pots, vases, etc). 

When we arrived, we had a little confusion with the door and Serina came right over to help without any hesitation! 

The neighborhood was pretty safe in my opinion. It was extremely close to EVERY SINGLE bus you would need practically. 

Everything in the house was in good condition! I truly loved staying here and I can't wait to come back. "
1321090,28570355,2015-03-26,28258258,Tom,"My stay at Serina's apartment was a delight! The apartment was very clean and nicely furnished, without any hiccups or downsides. The location was fantastic. It was very near to all the major sites - the furthest attraction we saw was approximately 2 mi away in the heart of downtown. Serina was very kind and prompt in responding to our questions. She allowed us to drop our bags off 4 hours early, and she allowed us to leave our bags in her garage for an extra 6 hours on the day of our departure. We were also welcomed with pastries upon our arrival! I would highly recommend staying here."
1321090,28775078,2015-03-30,23776659,Meg,"Serina was very helpful when booking our trip, and was always quick to respond. This was especially great when our party had a bit of trouble with the door upon arrival. She was available within minutes and even gave us some restaurant recommendations on the spot. She also accommodated our late check in, set up the futon before our arrival, and left a box of delicious pastries on the kitchen counter.

Everything was bright, clean and well laid out. We enjoyed using the kitchen to cook and make coffee or tea. We were also grateful for the maps and guides provided in the suite.

Although there is some noise that comes in from the street overnight if you're sleeping on the futon, we were able to mediate it simply by closing the window. Both beds were cozy, and there is a large amount of closet space available. 

We were easily able to walk to the Seattle Centre, Space Needle, and Belltown, and used the monorail to go to Pike Place market. The suite was also in the midst of many restaurants and pubs - the location really is ideal!  Thanks again!"
1321090,29177845,2015-04-05,8946045,Craig,"Serina's Seattle Center Inn is right in the heart of Lower Queen Anne, a busy place convenient to everything. We had a great stay in the well-equipped apartment and didn't want for anything. We had a mishap with the electronic safe and Serina helped us out with a backup key happily and quickly. She was a fine host and we'll be back to stay again when we need an affordable and convenient place in Seattle."
1321090,29521212,2015-04-08,29761212,Jonathan,What a great location and price! The listing was exactly as posted. The amenities were also a very nice convenience even for our limited stay.
1321090,29681285,2015-04-11,9296262,MIchele,We really enjoyed staying at one of Serina's apartments again (we stayed at the one upstairs last year). Its a perfect location for us and this apartment felt spacious and was quiet and was generally pleasant (especially the bedroom which is off the street).  Its was a good value for the price and was affordable for us. Serina was also very welcoming and helpful with any questions we had. We'll likely rent this apartment again when we come back to Seattle.
1321090,30035373,2015-04-16,28259318,Yunyun,"Wonderful experience, everything arranged here is perfect, I hope to be in Seattle again and stay with my excellent host longer."
1321090,30202317,2015-04-19,426104,Emily,"Serena was very accommodating with our travel arrangements. The place was more spacious than listed, and could easily accommodate several people.  The apartment was within a 10 minute walk to parks and the water, and a fairly close walk to downtown. I didn't walk around too much, but there didn't seem to be a ton of restaurants, bars, or shopping within 10 or so minutes walking."
1321090,30765377,2015-04-27,27566952,Nigel,"This was my first airbnb experience, and based on what I have heard from other travelers who use this website, I went into this reservation with some preexisting ideas of what to expect.  I warned my fiance that this was going to be different than a hotel, and that luxuries were set aside for convenience and location.  That being said, I was totally wrong and was amazed by the comforting home Serina invited us into.  This apartment is a homey one bedroom with a compelling view of the iconic Space Needle from its front porch, but it is also so much more.  Serina went above and beyond to ensure that all of the amenities of home were waiting for us when we unlocked the door.  We had a dishwasher and washing machine for us to use (which was a godsend considering that we spent some time upstate near the coast), a Keurig coffee maker and a television that occupied our short, but much needed downtime.  The bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean and stocked, and the kitchen was surprisingly usable (utensils and dishware included).  She even goes as far as to suggest several restaurants in the binder that awaits those who stay there.  We never asked for her to come to our door, but she made it clear from our check-in that she was accessible and more than happy to meet with us to discuss the apartment or to share information about the lovely city.  This airbnb goes far beyond what I would expect from any hotel that fetches twice the nightly rate.  Simply put: If you wish to live like a native Seattle resident, book with Serina.  "
1321090,31000481,2015-04-30,30800527,Matthew Phillips,"Great hostess, great place and great location. In walking distance to downtown. "
1321090,31188273,2015-05-03,11370744,Natalie,"We had a great time!  The location is perfect and the apartment has what you need. You can easily walk to restaurants and some nightlife, and are close enough to the major attractions.  Serina was a great host and responded with helpful information quickly. She even had a few pastries (which were amazing!) waiting for us when we arrived. We would definitely stay here again. "
1321090,31471142,2015-05-05,9362842,Jie,"This apartment is only two minutes walk to Space Needle and thus very good location. The condition of this apartment is perfect and Serina is so nice to guest! Great staying indeed
"
1321090,31685710,2015-05-08,262,Jonathan,Great location  Serina was communicative and the place was clean. I recommend staying here. 
1321090,31856124,2015-05-10,23385807,David,Great place to stay. Very spacious and walking distance to everything. 
1321090,31948888,2015-05-12,11083008,April,The location was very convenient and Serina checked in with us shortly after we arrived to make sure we were comfortable. 
1321090,32504913,2015-05-19,22898617,Joe,"This apartment was in a perfect location, close to the space needle, a Safeway for groceries, and not too far from major attractions. 
The apartment was really nice and clean, spacious and comfortable. 
We especially loved how upon arrival we had some local pastries just waiting for us, they were delicious. 
Would definitely recommend it."
1321090,33062520,2015-05-25,1144956,Kaye,"Serina was a wonderful host!  She was very welcoming, and her ""housewarming"" treat of cheese and crackers was the perfect snack after spending the day at the Folklife festival.  The apartment was very clean and has everything needed for a comfortable stay, and it is conveniently located.  Serina went the extra mile with a special treat for my anniversary, which my husband was unable to spend with me.  Her place will definitely be my first choice the next time I need to be near Seattle center.  A very, very pleasant experience!"
1321090,33461379,2015-05-28,29926804,Runmina,"Even though I couldn't meet Serina FtF, she always helped me in our questions (which were many). The apartment is just as it is described, excellent location and just as in the pictures, for us it was a great value for our money and are very happy about our trip. I would stay there in the future without questions. "
1321090,34142720,2015-06-05,32793674,Ryan,"Serena has a fabulous apartment that we enjoyed immensely. It was clean,  neat, and had everything you could ask for. Its location was absolutely perfect as we could walk everywhere we wanted to go. The ""welcome gift"" of local pastries was a nice surprise as well!"
1321090,34409008,2015-06-08,28429597,Janette,"Serina was a great host. The location of the apartment is a dream. You can see the Space Needle out of your window. Key Arena, the Space Needle, Museums and Science Center are all a very short walk away. Serina was kind enough to let me drop my bags a little before check in. The apartment was stocked with Keurig coffee packs, a couple of laundry soaps, Shampoo, conditioner, shower gel, lotion, and everything else you could need. She was sweet enough to leave two pastries for uses a welcome gift. Serina was very responsive to any questions we had. It was a great stay and I definitely hope to be back soon. Thanks, Serina!"
1321090,34691948,2015-06-11,26926874,Lauren,"The listing was accurate.  Great location.  Serina was very accommodating and greeted us after we settled in.  My friend and I were very comfortable in our home away from home!  This was so much better than a hotel...

There are several restaurants, grocery store (Metropolitan Market), drug store (Bartell Drugs), and Seattle Center within walking distance.  Very convenient!!!  There is a fun karaoke tiki bar, Hula Hula, within walking distance - if you like to karaoke!!!  The special cocktails are fun and the regulars were very friendly!!

If you are relying on public transportation, you will be very close to the bus line.  Serina was able to accommodate parking for us during our stay - it's a tight spot, but reasonably priced.  However, she does not always have the spaces available - so you have to let her know if you would like to try to park on site.  There is a public parking across the street.

We had a great stay and I would totally stay here again!!!  THANK YOU, SERINA!"
1321090,34933223,2015-06-14,11003898,Tracy,"Serina was a great host! The place was perfectly located to our half marathon and also to other cute restaurants and cafes. It was also very clean and inviting. Serina even bought fresh fruit for us, which was very thoughtful. She went above and beyond to make us feel at home with details like having toiletries we might have forgotten in the medicine cabinet and other small touches. Overall, I would definitely recommend staying here...it was great!"
1321090,35289200,2015-06-17,28430902,Jessica,"Listing couldn't have been more accurate. We loved the location and Serina was the perfect host, coming down to explain a few things we weren't sure how to work. We loved our stay at Serina's apartment and look forward to staying again in the future! View of the space needle was truly incredible and you can't find a better apartment for Key Arena events."
1321090,35905983,2015-06-23,4532938,Anne,"Serina's inn is in the perfect location. Seattle center was only a 10 min walk and from there you can catch the monorail to west lake center (DT Seattle). Serina was available when ever we had a question and she was also very accommodating to our needs. Our flight back to SD wasn't until 6pm and she allowed us to keep our luggage with her so we could still enjoy the last few hours in Seattle without having to drag our luggage along. Overall, we had a wonderful experience and we would definitely book to stay here again. "
1321090,36506884,2015-06-29,9006305,Arthur,"The apartment was very comfortable. Serena met and helped with the parking, then took us inside showed us around, explained some things and left us be. Which was fine. The bed was great, bathroom was great, just remember when showering to leave the exhaust fan on during or after. If you do not the smoke alarm will go off. Keep the door closed for awhile with the fan running. All appliances worked well for us. The WiFi also worked great. I do have two suggestions. Clean the outside windows especially if bird droppings that was a turn off. Second, I like watching the morning news shows on the network during breakfast. The TV keeps losing those signals. I would fix that as well. Other wise it was a great stay and the location worked well for us. Got in some good walking."
1321090,36863409,2015-07-02,31112529,Dan,"If you're looking for a place to stay in Seattle, look no further. Serina was easy to communicate with and very responsive to all our questions! The apartment was great! Near all main attractions and a short walk to downtown. We couldn't be happier with the entire experience! If we ever make it back to Seattle we'll definitely stay here again. "
1321090,37129091,2015-07-05,4664366,Megan,"We had a great stay in Serina's lovely apartment. 
Clean, bright and very nicely furnished it was just what we needed. 
Serina was a great host, meeting us in the first day and responding quickly to messages before and during the stay. 
Location was great for exploring some of Seattle's key attractions with the space needle, EMP and Chihuly glass only a couple of blocks walk and the Pike Markets a short bus ride away. 
Thanks for having us "
1321090,37835609,2015-07-11,29130504,Christine,Serina made us very welcome and recommended some great restaurants. The location was very convenient for all the sights on Seattle. It was quite noisy on a Friday night.
1321090,38370806,2015-07-15,1620419,Terry-Jo,"Serina was a good host.  She is very kind and made us feel welcome.  Fist night I text her to figure out TV remotes and washer and dryer.  She immediately came to our room to help and didn't makes us feel like it was an inconvenience. Thanks for the added touch of pastries, we ate all!"
1321090,38812955,2015-07-19,14382806,Joann,"Hi Serina!
Serina, 

I just loved staying with you again!  The apartment was clean, comfortable, and very quiet!  Thank you for the ""welcome treats!""  I have told others about your location and reasonable rates!!   I plan to come back and stay here again in the future! :)

Warm regards,
Joann P."
1321090,39918421,2015-07-27,29543510,Mike,"This rental was exactly as advertised and we would not hesitate to stay there again.  The property was clean and comfortable, we really enjoyed our stay.  We love to walk, so the walk to the stadiums and Pike Place Market were fun and were even closer than we expected. The only small hiccup we had was the smoke alarm that kept going off when we showered, even with the bathroom fan on.  Overall, we had a great experience staying here.  "
1321090,40308686,2015-07-30,11611660,Becky,"Communication with Serina was very good along the way from booking until arrival.  The description of the apartment was accurate. There were three of us and I think it might be better for a couple so that the futon doesn't have to serve as another bed. However, the unit was clean and roomy and I couldn't have asked for a better location. It is just a few minutes' walk to lots of interesting venues and activities.  We went on some longer walks (Pike Place and the ferry) and it was always easy to find our way home by just staying on 1st. There's a great market a few blocks up the road and lots of good restaurants in the neighborhood. Would I stay here again? Yes, I would. And I hope I can. I had a very positive experience."
1321090,41718397,2015-08-09,25757044,Kelvin,"Serina was an amazing host. I went to visit Seattle for a week and encountered no problems at all. The location is wonderful, literally steps away from Key Arena and many restaurants were nearby. We especially enjoyed the pastries she gave us as a welcome gift. I would definitely recommend staying here."
1321090,42383098,2015-08-13,13397081,David,"Entry details were incorrect, but Serina was around promptly to rectify the error and let us in. The apartment wasn't in the best part of town, but once inside was very nice!"
1321090,42814519,2015-08-16,9636569,Don,Thanks
1321090,43353090,2015-08-19,30447438,Emelie,My son and I just returned from our trip to Seattle. We have to say we had one of the best times ever.. Staying at this apartment was great. It's everything it says it is and the pictures are very accurate. Location was perfectly located close to everything. It was easy to find and our host was wonderful. She was  very clear on instructions and was responsive to my emails and text. Would definitely recommend this airbnb..
1321090,43913185,2015-08-23,32452715,Live,"Thank you Serina for hosting us in your apartment. I absolutely loved the location. For me this was the biggest selling point! It was literally just two blocks upon entering the pedestrian walkway and park that leads to the space needle, pacific science center, children's museum, EMP museum, chihuly garden and glass, fountain, playground, monorail, trolley tour, and duck tour. There were movies in the park at night, and street musicians performing.  It was wonderful. We were also within walking distance to pike place market, the seattle aquarium, the seattle great wheel, and waterfront pier. If you didn't want to walk, just a quick ride on the monorail would get you in closer to where you needed to go. I really enjoyed my stay, the apartment was clean, and comfortable. I would stay again when in the Seattle area."
1321090,44784460,2015-08-29,25715295,Erika,Serina was very nice and helpful. I thought it was such a nice touch that she had a guide book and where to go and what to eat in the area. Location was perfect! Everything is within walking distance. Serina's home is very welcoming and comfortable. We really enjoyed staying there! If we are ever in Seattle again we would most definitely stay there again!
1321090,45379503,2015-09-02,37156392,Dean,"This was the perfect place to stay!   Lots of room,  comfy bed,  very clean,  and an awesome hostess!  We would highly recommend staying here!   Parking is a little tricky though. "
1321090,46464876,2015-09-11,13511323,Don,"The Uptown Inn is in a great position - easy walk to the Seattle Space Needle & Chihuly glass display (go to see - it is so much better than you could imagine). From there a monorail & then light rail will get you close to all central areas of interest.
The rooms were absolutely spotless and you can batch for yourself completely if you want. The coffee pods were supplied and were the best coffee I've had in the U.S. - it's amazing how Seattle showed us the best and the worst of coffee ................
We were held up by a pilot strike & so were delayed by 24 hours plus some and turned up on the doorstep late one night. Nevertheless entry was easy as per Serina's instructions and we enjoyed our stay & Seattle. Would recommend."
1321090,47141372,2015-09-16,14959475,Jessica,"Fantastic location - nice and easy check in and out. Although we didn't get a chance to meet Serina she was kind enough to leave some welcoming muffins. 
Communication was great, Serina replied to any queries we had promtly! Highly recommend this apartment and would stay again if we get the chance to come back.
Thanks again Serina :)"
1321090,47455212,2015-09-19,29471346,Graham,"This was the first time that we used AirBnB and were really impressed with Serina's listing and the the apartment when we arrived. It was in a great location close to the Space Needle. The directions provided from the airport were perfect and we got there in about an hour. The apartment was spotless and had everything that you could want. It was very spacious and the bed very comfortable. Many thanks for the pastries left for our arrival and the coffee machine was a 
I've saver with our jet lag. Thanks for a great stay. "
1321090,47665759,2015-09-21,25517299,Kate,"Serina and our stay in Settle were great! The apartment is in a great location, walking distance to the market, Space Needle, waterfront and more. The apartment was well kept and stocked with everything you could need - coffee, bottled water etc. Highly recommend it for a stay in Seattle."
1321090,48271009,2015-09-25,35921892,Teresa,"My parents and I spent two nights at Serina's inn. It was a great stay. The location was ideal - yes you really can see the space needle from the lounge window!
I slept on the fold out couch and was surprised at how comfortable it was (although I'm not a large person) - the only small discomfort was that the fridge was also in the room and it made a lot of noises through out the night if you're a light sleeper. However, as I knew prior to the stay that I was sleeping in the living area it is not a complaint just an observation.
Public transport was easy to get to and I would definitely recommend Serina's inn if you are wanting to stay in Seattle - especially as a tourist.
Racha Thai down the road was a delicious meal and a perfect location before we headed for out night time viewing up the space needle.
Thanks for a perfect stay!"
1321090,48862790,2015-09-29,13074237,Marilyn,"She was great. The place was very clean, supplies were well stocked. The location was ideal for us. I would definitely request this apartment again."
1321090,49316926,2015-10-03,26125984,Rachel,Serina was an excellent host. She had lot's of helpful recommendations for exploring the area and even left a small assortment of fresh pastries to welcome me. She was very accommodating when my flight was delayed. The place was clean and comfortable - near a very pretty part of town.
1321090,49972265,2015-10-08,19866568,Pat,"Serina is a terrific host. She greeted us when we arrived and we enjoyed her food and shopping recommendations. The apartment is cute and very clean. Staying there provided us with an urban experience-steps from many restaurants, Seattle Center, Belltown and more. Wonderful experience. Would stay there on our next trip."
1321090,50271446,2015-10-11,19011795,Jill,"Such a wonderful experience. Could not have stayed at a better location. You feel as though you are in the middle of everything. You are two blocks from the space needle and can see it from the front window of the apartment. Pike street, post alley, first Starbucks, and public market are all within walking distance. Queen Anne is an awesome neighborhood and Kerry Park is only a short walk up Queen Anne hill or an even shorter drive. I stayed three nights and got a chance to explore 11 neighborhoods which all were either in walking distance or an easy commute.
Serina was so nice and left an assorted fruit basket for us. Apartment was so cute and clean. Plus there is a washer/dryer to dry all your clothes if you get caught in the rain too long like me! We'll definitely be coming back to this lovely green and friendly city and staying here! "
1321090,51010176,2015-10-17,11979909,Michael,"We received a warm welcome from Serina when we arrived. There was some fresh fruit on the table and she provided a few kids movies for my daughter. Nice touch. I think the photos describe the place nicely, although at night, it's a bit dark (only a couple of lights for the living room and kitchen.)  The house guidebook has very specific notes about the house and the area, which was helpful. The kitchen is sparsely but adequately supplied (we asked for a spatula and got it promptly for our next meal.) 

Some Airbnb listings are a real home that you are living in for a few days, and some listings are more like furnished apartments for rent. This place doesn't have the cozy feeling that you get from someone's real home, but it was a good price, a good location, and it did the job. We'd return. "
1321090,51439274,2015-10-20,41765198,Michael,This was our first airbnb experience and Serina's place was great! It's in a great location and within walking distance of everything we wanted to see! The apartment was exactly how it was described and Serina went above and beyond offering her suggestions for restaurants and places to see. Highly recommend.
1321090,52213459,2015-10-27,39646523,Ryan,"Serina was a great host! She was always available to answer any questions I had or to suggest good places to visit. The location was excellent and is walking distance to the space needle. Pike Place was just a five minute drive away. Looking back I would probably not rent a car since the location is so great we could have easily just taken an uber, lyft, or taxi anywhere we wanted. "
1321090,54087053,2015-11-16,1458876,Michael,"The unit is exactly as described, neatly and comfortably furnished and steps from bus stops uptown and downtown.  I'm a long-distance commuter to the ballet, and the location is just a few blocks from the ballet studio and McCaw Hall.  Bus #13 takes you uphill into the business area of Queen Anne (Trader Joes, Seattle Gym) and many buses from John Street on Queen Anne Ave into downtown to to the market.  The unit baseboard heating works well, and they keyless locks were very convenient and easy to use.  Serina lives on an upper floor with her family and greeted me when I arrived.  There's good quality wireless and a booklet in the unit provides guidance and lots of suggestions.  Fruit and a nut bread were provided in the unit, much appreciated."
1321090,54541240,2015-11-21,5799447,Pat,"Great location; wonderful host.  New kitchen appliances, plenty of space.  Would  definitely stay here again in the future!"

1321090,55716612,2015-12-05,45206713,Brad,"I had a great stay at Seattle Center Inn, which was minutes away from my venue and in a quiet location.  Serina left me a welcome bowl of fruit, which I enjoyed throughout my stay.  The place was very well kept and clean, and furnished with all the amenities of a hotel room with kitchenette, plus several more including an umbrella for the Seattle weather.  Nice touch.  

Thanks Serina.  I would definitely stay here again."
1321090,56186755,2015-12-10,46598609,Catalina,"I had a wonderful stay! The apartment was clean, neat, and loaded with up-to-date appliances. Serina is very accommodating and gracious. This is a must-stay place if you're visiting Seattle."

She made check-in and check-out very smooth and simple.

The listing is accurate and I would be happy to return in the future."

585418,2293829,2012-09-14,1150548,Paul Lloyd,"Fantastic place to stay and fantastic host - thank you so much! Angela was extremely friendly, accomodating and helpful, and I can certainly say that I have left Seattle with a new friend.

The apartment is very well located on a quiet, green street but very close (walking distance) to shops, restuarants and everything you need in the very hip and convenient U-district of Seattle. The flat was meticulously tidy and clean, the bed was extremely comfortable and there was always fresh fruit ready in the very handy kitchen. Angela made me a delicious breakfast both days I was there and was great company to talk about any topic, big or small. She even gave me a big carry-all bag (which was certainly expensive) when my own bag broke just before I left, insisting that I don't return it to her. 

All in all a privilige to stay at Angela's place, and certainly worth much more than the dirt cheap rental which Angela charges!"
585418,2355765,2012-09-20,3492653,Trine,"I stayed at Angela's place for 6 nights when I first got to Seatte. Of all host on Airbnb Angela simply most be the best. The place was really clean and cosy and I almost felt like home immediately. At the time I stayed with Angela I was new i the city, so I wasn't really sure of anything, but Angela was being so helpfull showing me the location of the supermarkets and gave me good tips on what to see around the area. 
Besides that staying with Angela also includes the opportunity to taste some of Angela excellent ccoking. She made me several homemade dishes which were absolutely delicious!
Angela has been a great host whom you can also have many interesting and enjoyable conversations with.    

So all in all I can definiitely recommed to stay with Angela - I had the best time, so I'm absolutely sure you won't regret it! "

Her place is impeccably clean, and filled with encouraging and inspiring quotes on the walls and mirrors.  We had great conversations about all kinds of topics.  Even though my plane landed in Seattle at 1am, Angela was not only accommodating to my check-in time, she made me feel taken care of, arriving in an unfamiliar city late at night.  I would definitely come back again!"
585418,2870005,2012-11-12,878806,Giang,"Angela has been very accommodating and friendly throughout my entire stay. Her apartment is very clean and homey, the bed has been comfortable, and the neighborhood has to be one of the most beautiful neighborhoods in Seattle with a running trail and lots of leaves falling and changing colors! The bus stops are within walking distance. The stay has been wonderful save the fact that due to unexpected situation Angela and I didn't have much chance to get to know each other, but really wish I could have! STAY HERE!"
585418,2911716,2012-11-18,4053979,Tim,"Angela was super busy, but she graciously made space for me to stay with her at the very last minute.

I'd stay at her place again in a heartbeat during any future trip to Seattle."
585418,3387556,2013-01-21,4666643,Herrick,"Angela was a great host. Although she was out of town, she had her boyfriend(Xing) setup the place nice, clean and bed very comfortable and ready to use by the time I got in. Their place is quiet, easy access to my conference and university village (A very nice plaza with just everything).  A warm and wonderful host, I definitely recommend this place, comfortable and affordable. Thank you so much for your very very healthy breakfast and all of your help to me, really enjoy to talk to you and lucky I have found your place. Thanks again. If I am visiting Seattle again, you are my only choice "

585418,3866498,2013-03-22,3772070,Tom,"I was in Seattle on short notice for a business conference just for one night.  Angela was quick to respond and accommodated what I needed during my stay.  Although I checked in late, she was very gracious and provided wonderful conversation and tea for a couple of hours.  Before check out in the morning, Angela made soba and a fruit smoothie for breakfast.  This was probably the first time I've had soba for breakfast and I absolutely loved it.  Angela's simple but perfect skills in the kitchen are just what I needed.  Her apartment is very clean and has everything I needed for the overnight stay.  I highly recommend this accommodation to anyone.  Angela provides a delightful experience!"
585418,4090201,2013-04-08,4873374,Eric,"When I stay in Seattle I only need lodging for about 10 hours, so there is no need for an expensive room. Angela was able to provide me an affordable place to sleep that was quiet and exactly as advertised. At first I hesitated about staying in a place where I didn't have my own bedroom, but Angela offered me great conversation when I wanted it, and total privacy when I was ready to rest. I would stay here again."
585418,4910129,2013-06-01,2671766,Jason,"This is my second time staying with Angela, and my experience is as wonderful as with my first stay. 

Despite me visiting during the busy final exam period, Angela took the time to welcome me and prepare her place; it's extremely clean, nice, and comfortable. Angela is genuinely interested in getting to know her guests; she has an engaging personality that makes me feel at home; we had great conversations about a wide array of topics. At the same time, even though the sleeping arrangement is for the living room, I had a great amount of privacy and personal space. 

During one of our late night chats, Angela spoke of her dream of opening a B&B one day and becoming the perfect host. I would say she already is! I would recommend her to anyone visiting Seattle."

Her apartment was clean and comfortable, she happily assisted me with directions, and was very accommodating when providing breakfast foods that met my dietary restrictions. Angela was genuinely interested in making my stay a pleasant on. Thanks for the great conversation, too! I couldn't have asked for a better first experience using airbnb. I recommend her highly."
585418,5150361,2013-06-15,6611291,Raj,"Angela was an incredible host! She was very helpful and timely with her communication. Despite being extremely busy with finals, she made time to make me feel at home and answer any questions I had. It was wonderful to randomly find someone with such similar interests on the other side of the country. Both her hospitality and the accommodations were excellent. I would (and have) recommend that any of my friends stay with her. I may have been a guest, but I feel as if I made a true friend during my stay."
585418,5217193,2013-06-18,3772070,Tom,I was in town for a business event and was fortunate to be able to stay for one night with Angela and Zhi.  They were perfect hosts as always.

The place was very clean and organized and it was a joy to stay there as well as see Angela again.  I highly recommend this airbnb stay.  
585418,5305324,2013-06-23,6971433,Jan,Angela was a great host and an awesome first airbnb experience for me. She was very welcoming and her place is very nice. I had great time talking to Angela and her boyfriend and they made us tasty breakfast. It is always great luck to find such lovely people.
585418,5336386,2013-06-24,7020980,Brendan,Angela was awesome and I don't have enough good things to say about her and her beautiful place.  It's modern and comfy and Angela is quick to make you feel at home; during my brief stay she offered up her whole kitchen and even bought some delicious pastries from one of the best bakeries in Seattle for me to take with me in the morning.  Great great experience and would definitely do again in a heartbeat!

585418,5532182,2013-07-04,956540,Michele,"Angela and her boyfriend Xing were great hosts with a comfortable and clean place to stay. Very communicative and accommodating. Xing met us downtown to give us the keys right after we arrived from the airport and made recommendations on where to eat. The next day he cooked us a delicious breakfast, even accommodating our low carb diet. We only needed to stay one night since we were staying at the UW dorms the next day and their spot was just a short walk down a lovely path to the dorms, and also a short walk from the Ave. Thank you for a lovely stay! "
585418,5684251,2013-07-11,2533236,Steven,"Angela was an excellent host!  She was incredibly helpful with finding my way around, and she made me feel welcome, both in the city and in her home.  I can't recommend her enough."
585418,5705939,2013-07-12,1221549,Alan,You meet the nicest people through the internet. Angela & her boyfriend were helpful and totally cool. The apartment's right by the UW in a nice building--everything's clean and safe. The hosts are great & helped me with directions and local knowledge. A++. 
585418,5735947,2013-07-14,6373576,Lucio,"This is my first AirBnb experience, it's definitely awesome and wonderful! Angela bought me bread for the breakfast and we shared our own stories. Angela and Xing are really easy-going and open-minded. Omg, I really enjoy staying at their place and bed is extremely comfortable! The view at the surrounding is incredibly awesome. They lent me their bike to tour around the area and brought to have delicious Vietnamese Poh, which is really really delicious! Thank you guys so so so much! You made my trip at Seattle wonderful!"
585418,5850484,2013-07-19,182253,Chin Chun,"Angela and Xing are very friendly and extremely hospitable. The place is located in a great place, near school and the Burke-Gilman trail. It was a great experience staying here."
585418,6108626,2013-07-30,6935079,Diane,"We had a wonderful experience staying with Angela. She is a very warm and welcoming host who really enjoys meeting people from other countries. Her apartment is in a lovely part of Seattle with nice views. The mattress and futon in the living room were very comfortable and the area is quiet so we slept very well. The breakfast and other food she provided were healthy and delicious. We also enjoyed meeting her boyfriend Zhing (spelling??). I would definitely stay with Angela again and recommend her as a host, especially for those wanting a friendly personal connection. She would be very welcome to stay with me iin New Zealand anytime!"

My boyfriend and I had a great time in Seattle, and staying with Angela and Xing made it that much better. They're the type of people you rave about, even weeks after meeting them! "
585418,6827360,2013-08-26,91685,GheeChuan,"It was a great experience having Angela host us, not to mention our pleasant surprise that we graduated from the same college, with a year overlap between us. The apartment is beautiful and comfortable, and the location is convenient as advertised. Angela helped suggest a couple of great places to check out around UDistr.  and lent us her bikes to check out the Burke Gilman trail. It was a wonderful stay."
585418,6923689,2013-08-30,8186715,Noah,"You might doubt how come all the reviews are saying perfect things about the place. I will tell you the truth. They are true and correct. It is not exaggerated. You think I'm also exaggerating? What can I say, book it and experience it yourselves ;)"
585418,7088870,2013-09-06,8086323,Tuuy,"Nice place to stay in a bright living room and nice host to chat with the wonderful host. As the host does not need to get thru the living room to get to her bedroom, there is enough privacy for the guests "
585418,8247254,2013-10-21,6357602,Bianca,"My one night stay with Angela was the best airbnb experience I have had to date! Not only is she a great host, Angela is truly kind and goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome and at home. The location is great to get out and explore all areas of the city, especially on a bike :)Thanks Angela!
 The apartment is clean and comfortable and the futon bed was a greta night's sleep. It is truly a great value, I felt very safe and taken care of during my stay. I cannot recommend Angela enough!"
585418,8296148,2013-10-24,3181989,Jay,"I was in Seattle for a few interviews and had the happenstance to book a reservation with Angela.  Let me tell you that it wasn't easy to book with her.  She's real popular among the AirBnb literati so I recommend you book in advance.  She's that popular!

I don't know if I can add anything more superlative to the common narrative of all the reviews....but if you're staying in Seattle and looking for a great location, host, experience, then you don't need to look any further. 

Apartment:
  - Great location in the University District
  - Central to anywhere you would want to go. 
  - Great view from the living room.  
  - Clean and well laid out.  

Angela:
  - Smart and naturally conversational - makes you feel at ease.
  - She makes breakfast for you.
  - Great concierge service - will help plan out your trip if needed.
  - Really cares about you - she even stayed up to make sure I got home after a late night out with two of my interviewers.

Treat her well everyone.  This one is very special.  I feel like I just made a new close friend.  It was that good.  A singular experience.

Thanks, Angela -  see you when I come back!

585418,8371431,2013-10-28,577066,Steve,"My visit to Seattle was awesome, in large part due to the stay at Angela's place. I was in town for three-nights and I'm glad I chose to stay here. Angela is a fantastic hostess. She provided a very comfortable, clean, and quiet space that is within a few blocks of the University of Washington. She is very knowledgeable about the neighborhood and Seattle in general and her enthusiasm for the city is contagious - I hope to return soon. If you need any suggestions about where to go or what to do, Angela is the person to ask. And, she's a great conversationalist and interested in getting to know you. If you're thinking about visiting Seattle, definitely check in at Angela's place."
585418,8474473,2013-11-01,9472235,Mark,"Highly recommended. Staying with Angela was easy, helpful, and as described in the listing. Angela was the consummate host and went out of her way to make sure the environment was comfortable and relaxed. Her space is very clean, well organized, and features all kinds of amenities. As I was relocating to Seattle at the time of my stay, Angela was super helpful when it came to recommending logistical solutions to developments that would arise. I couldn't ask for a better introduction to Seattle, and again, I would recommend this listing to any independent person looking for an ideal experience in the Pacific Northwest."
585418,8508226,2013-11-03,1433442,Monica,"I'll start off by saying that Angela and her apartment are both awesome! I stayed at her place for 2 nights while visiting UWash for an interview. Angela is an amazing host! She is super accommodating and ensures that her guests' stays are more than perfect. Not only is she really social and super easy to talk to, but she also went out of her way to lend me a bike and provide me with breakfast in the mornings. She's an overall really nice person, and was even sweet enough to mail me something that I forgot in her apartment.

The apartment itself is very spacious and extremely clean. It is the cleanest apartment I've ever stayed in through Airbnb! Also, I must say, the fact that the bed is in the living room did not bother me one bit, as it feels like there is more than enough privacy in the living room. Oh, and the best part is the amazing panoramic view of Seattle from the living room!

The location is perfect for anybody who needs to stay close to UWash, as it is a quick 20-minute walk and an even quicker bike ride off the Burke-Gilman path (beautiful bike path!). The location is perfect... close to Fremont and University District neighborhoods, and close to major bus lines. 

Overall, a wonderful stay! Thank you, Angela!"
585418,8870062,2013-11-23,3220652,Wei,"Angela was a great host and nice person!  She was very responsive and an excellent communicator, making the stay logistics flawless.  I had a comfortable bed, a nice desk/chair and hi speed wifi to do my work.  She also had a clean towel, bed linen, soap, local maps, etc. ready when I got there.  Her place is clean, walkable to bus lines + shopping center w/ groceries, and has a nice view being at the side of a hill.  She answered all of my questions about the area and the local resources.  All in all, it was a great airbnb stay!"
585418,9087200,2013-12-05,228373,Chris,"I've been an airbnb member for a a few years now, and hosts like Angela are the reason why I consider it my favorite way to travel. She's very easy to connect with, arrange logistics, and book her clean and charming space. She's very thoughtful about the small details, like water bottles for thirsty travelers and a bike if you want to get on the nearby Burke Gilman trail. As a host, she's smart and personable and very easy to chat with about interesting things. She knows the lay of the land nearby very well, so has excellent tips about what to do where, and she's generally just very enjoyable to hang out with even as she's very respectful of your space and privacy.

Her space is in a safe and secluded area near UW and a block or so away from University Village, where you can find pretty much everything you need. She's informed and warm and frankly very cool, and I give her my highest recommendation."

585418,9278983,2013-12-17,10578197,Amy,"My first AirBnb and Angela really set the bar high. The consummate hostess, I was perfectly comfortable for the night on her futon and she made me feel very welcome in her home for my quick stay. I was very tired from traveling when I arrived, and her setup was very accommodating so I didn't have to worry about anything when I got in and settled. She knows her neighbourhood and the city well and gave me great advice so I was able to orient myself in this new place! Highly recommended."
585418,9290471,2013-12-18,7940158,Don,"Angela is a great host. She is super friendly,  personable, and I felt right at home.  The place is in a great location, parking is free, and I wish I could have checked out more of the area that was recommended. Overall, she is the kind of host that is ideal. Someone who gives you your own space, is laid back, and very understandable. "
585418,9312157,2013-12-20,10579042,Camille,"My stay at Angela's was just great! This was my first experience of travelling all by myself, and she was very attentive and helpful, droping me at the place I wanted to visit, explaining how to reach the airport by bus, even if she was in finals' rush! Don't hesitate to ask her for any advice or help! Plus her place was really nice, neat and cosy, and it's easy to reach downtown or any Seattle's neighbourhood by public transportation (I did it)! Last thing, she has plenty of (may I add super healthy) stuff for you to get breakfast! Great stay, great host, I'm thrilled!"
585418,9411159,2013-12-27,10378850,Shruti,I had a very comfortable stay in Seattle at Angela's place. The arrangements were great! She in an amazing host. Very friendly! I would love to stay at her place on my next visit to Seattle!!

Angela made sure my sister and I were settled in with tea and cookies the instant we arrived after a long drive.  She was very friendly and easy to talk to, and even made sure we got back safe and sound after a night out on the town! To top it all, her apartment is spotless and has a great view of University Village. "
585418,10025110,2014-01-26,8524298,Megan,"There's too many wonderful things I can say about my stay with Angela, but to highlight just a few:
1) She has an abundance of knowledge and is wicked smart, yet so easy to converse with.
2) Her place is in a prime location near the university and public transportation; the apartment is SPOTLESS; the futon was super comfy and sheets were crispy clean; and there was plenty of food choices for breakfast!
3) She was very accommodating and attentive to my all needs, yet she was still very easy-going and provided me with my space.

Mad respect for this smart, frank, and kind-hearted woman.

Angela's place has great energy and is carefully appointed with everything necessary to become quickly acquainted with the local area and beyond, making for a perfect place to rest & rejuvenate while traveling on a budget in Seattle!  Angela's place definitely met my needs and is exactly as described.

A not-to-be-missed Airbnb experience! "
585418,10189175,2014-02-04,11394921,Ted,"Angela is an excellent host.  Her apartment is warm, clean and has plenty of light.  It is conveniently located in the U District near the University of Washington and U Village, which is full of shopping places.  She provides a lot of nice breakfast options, including coffee, tea, oatmeal, granola and eggs, to name a few, which I consider a bonus.  I was free to come and go as I wanted.  Although Angela was very busy studying for law school exams, we had some interesting conversations about Seattle, restaurants, houses and more.  I recommend staying with Angela."
585418,10297176,2014-02-11,7119974,Meghan,"I had a wonderful time staying here. Quiet, convenient, comfortable. would definitely stay here again."

My flight was delayed and I arrived late, but she welcomed me with open arms and gave me a little tour of her lovely apartment.  Everything that I needed prior to my interview was readily available: iron (check), breakfast (check), towel (check) among many other things!  Some of my favorite parts of the stay, were 1) the kitchen fully stocked with coffee/oatmeal/tea/love galore!  2) Fast internet service to assist me in reviewing materials 3) I loved that there were large windows in which I kept the blinds open.  When the sun rose in the morning, I woke up to a gorgeous view of the city (her apartment is on the top floor).  I immediately felt a sense of peace to calm my nerves before my interview.  We didn't get a chance to chat since I had to leave early the next morning, but there is always next time!  Although my stay was short, I had a most wonderful experience.  I can't wait to return to Seattle and call Angela up for more adventures!"

家の周りは自然も多く、夜は暗いですが、ワシントン大学やUniversity Villageは近いので歩いて見て回ることができます。またダウンタウンにもバス一本で行けるのでわかりやすいです。
そして、なんといってもAngelaの人柄の良さが最高でした！！初対面でかなり緊張しましたが、すごくオープンで今日したことを話したり、お互いの普段の生活や家族のことを話したりと姉妹ができたみたいで楽しかったですよ！
出発の日は、朝は雨が降っていて早めに出なきゃなーと思っていたら、Angelaが授業がなかったので車でグレイハウンドの乗り場まで送ってくれました。短い滞在でしたが、ホスピタリティのある対応をしてもらい、本当に本当に感謝しています。
これからシアトルに来る予定の人はぜひ考えてみてほしいです。英語ができなくても絶対いい思い出ができると思いますよ

Angela is so nice!! Thanks to her, I could have really good time during my short stay in Seattle. if I have a chance to visit there someday, I'll definitely stay at Angela's house again. Thank you so much from the bottom of my heart:)
"
585418,10422156,2014-02-18,11084903,Mimi,"This is an overdue review but both my boyfriend and I had a fabulous stay at Angela's! Angela was very welcoming and friendly upon arrival. Since we stayed for Valentine's Day weekend, Angela was really sweet to get us chocolate from Fran's (it was so delicious that we made a trip to grab some more). Overall, it was an awesome stay. She definitely knows her way around town and can recommend awesome restaurants and places to visit. "
585418,10488661,2014-02-21,4825289,Rob,"Angela was an great host.   She was very considerate and thoughtful during my stay and it made me feel right at home, but was also mindful of my privacy.  Angela is very knowledgeable about many things and it was very easy to have a conversation with her.  Also, If you want someone who knows the area, you want someone who is fairly new and has been adventurous enough to explore the area.  As a fairly recent transplant from Chicago, Angela IS that person.  

As for the place, the apartment was absolutely clean and organized.  The apartment has large open windows that have an amazing view (especially at night).  There was a desk that I could use to conveniently work and the wi-fi was really fast.

I really enjoyed meeting Angela and my stay with her.  I wished I could have booked for a longer stay.  She was such a wonderful person to get to know and I would definitely stay there again the next time I am in Seattle.      "
585418,10517303,2014-02-23,11097471,Luis Alberto,"Angela was a truly excellent host and her apartment is comfortable, perfectly organized and clean, and very conveniently located. She made everything extremely easy for me before and during my stay. I really had a great time there and would highly recommend her place to anyone visiting Seattle. Thanks Angela!"
585418,10625084,2014-02-28,12338220,Kevin,"My experience with Angela was great. I arrived late because of my work schedule and Angela was very attentive to all my needs. The space is very clean, bed was real firm (extra kudos for me) since I have a medical condition. The space is very quiet, I slept like a baby and Angela was even accommodating because of my late nights. I was able to sleep a little later knowing she's an early bird! Overall it was a pleasant stay and I will book another week in the near future! "
585418,10695518,2014-03-03,11375464,Michael,"Angela is an amazing host!  The spot is incredibly clean, she is incredibly generous and thoughtful.  The stay couldn't have been better.  The best part was meeting Angela, a truly kind, generous, and interesting person."

585418,10960328,2014-03-15,12132608,Susan,"Angela is an exceptional communicator and conversationalist, as well as a seasoned host who has the drill down on pat. She is very generous and more than happy to share food, beverages, and stories (she has a lot of good ones!). Her entire apartment was very clean and the area opened to guests is very spacey. She contributed to my very memorable Seattle adventure and I couldn't have been happier with the experience. "
585418,10975807,2014-03-16,539567,Darin,This was a nice stay in Seattle and the stay was what we expected. Two beds in the living room area for a good nights sleep. Angela was very nice and helpful and handed us the parking pass for our car upon check-in. We weren't able to visit much with Angela because of our busy schedule but the stay was great and everything was clean and to our expectations. Thank you
585418,11080669,2014-03-19,310125,Rahul,"I had a great,comfortable and hassle free stay with Angela. She is quick in response, understanding and very helpful and is quite empathic towards a traveller. Although the accommodation  is in the living room she tries to maintain utmost privacy by causing minimum disturbance. The room has a positive energy and a very picturesque  scenery overlooking a hill.The house is clean,tidy,neat and has all the essential things of day to day requirements. The kitchen is loaded with recipes and spices and is a big plus for traveller like me who hates to eat out frequently. 
As a person she is very interesting although i caught her in a middle of exam, in-spite she was able to share and discuss on a couple of subjects freely and she truly is a student of life ! 
It was pleasant not only to share her apartment but also her life and was happy to learn new things from her. 
I wish her all the best in her career and personal life and hope to meet her again in future !"
585418,11457344,2014-04-03,13355369,Sarah,"Angela made my first airBnB experience a great one! She was extremely hospitable, helpful with my questions and recommendations, and made me feel right at home. Even though I only stayed one night, I was incredibly comfortable and would have enjoyed a longer stay!"
585418,11506240,2014-04-06,8964054,Christina,"Angela was one of the best hosts I had! She was incredibly accommodating and helpful. I was only there for a short time, but she was more than great! The space is really clean and in a beautiful area. I would definitely stay here again if I come back."
585418,11632027,2014-04-09,4859786,Dave,The reservation was canceled 91 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
585418,11668842,2014-04-11,12843911,Katty,"You think the picture looks nice?? Ohhh... wait until you see the REALLL place! It's huge, spacious, clean, tidy, well-equipped with everything you'd need for a short stay (or even a permanent stay!). This place is a suite! In fact, it is better than a suite. If all airbnb hosts own places like this, the hotels will definitely run out of business. 

Prior to my arrival, Angela was very fast in responding to all my queries and concerns, and ensured that I could get there without any trouble. She is a very sweet, friendly, easy-going and considerate host. I was welcomed with a very sweet note and recommendations for things to do in the area especially since it was my first time at Seattle! I ended up checking in late at night cuz I was so mesmerized by the scenery at Pike Market Place, but she still welcomed me with her warm hospitality. Even though she was busy, she spent some time to get to know me, show me around, let me know where things were, recommended places for me to visit etc etc. She has a kitchen that is practically a mini-restaurant except without a chef. From coffee, tea collection, internet, visitor's tour books, yoga mats, books (and even foam rollers - I had a tight hamstring when i visited, so it was perfect!!), you-name-it, this place has EVERYTHING. Her place is super cosy, and the bed was super duper comfy too! Angela ensured that you had your own privacy, so I felt like I was in a private room. Overall, I ENJOYED my stay very much, and I would LOVE Angela to be my host again if I have the chance to visit again!

I can't recommend Angela's place more! She's the perfect host, and her place is just.....perfect!!"
585418,11689666,2014-04-12,10389813,Michael,"Great space, great host, amazing location near UW campus. I would definitely stay again."
585418,11785427,2014-04-14,14142640,Julien,Angela was a great host.  She demonstrates great hospitality and even when a friend of mine came into town she did not mind accommodating.   It really was great staying there and the view is incredible.  The tea she made and overall awesome relaxing stay with a great bed was what I needed for packed trip and she's really sweet.   In my language Quyana Caknek Angela ! 
585418,11966173,2014-04-20,13651458,Kate,"Angela is great! She was super helpful, the accommodations were comfortable, and she made sure that we had a great stay. She made great food recommendations, which was awesome. I highly recommend staying with her if you would like a relaxed, affordable place to stay in Seattle. "
585418,12228079,2014-04-26,4298689,Vincent,"I was looking for a place during a whirlwind business trip to Seattle, and stumbled upon Angela's listing the day I arrived. I was booked and had a place to stay within one hour. Never did I realize what was in store during my stay. There are a few rare moments in your busy life when circumstances force you to slow down and smell the roses. Staying at Angela's was such a moment, and Angela is such a rose. She's a sage at such a young age, and an incredibly thoughtful, well-read, well-rounded individual. 

While Angela's home is a terrific place to stay, and is in an interesting, and convenient part of Seattle, it's her hospitality and conversation that will stay with you after you're gone. Highly recommended."
585418,12361642,2014-04-29,14737062,Kirsty,"Our stay with Angela was awesome. She was very organised and extremely helpful, always going out of her way to ensure we were comfortable and willing to share with us her local knowledge. Angela gave us amazing food recommendations, provided us with her bus card and printed out a map of directions, which we really appreciated.  Her place was clean and tidy and the kitchen was great for cooking. It was also in a beautiful location, near the University, which is a short walking distance to some shops and restaurants. It was very easy to catch the bus into downtown. Great Host!"
585418,12434856,2014-05-02,8565427,Ahmad,"It was a very pleasant and excellent stay at Angela's place for a single traveler like me, or even couples. The place was simple and very clean, i like it so much and i like how it's organised, also, it has a very good and calm location and you can find whatever you need by. And Angela, i think she is the best and welcoming host ever, i really enjoyed our talks in many different topics, she is a very interesting, funny, and intelligent person and i learned a lot from her.

I would love to stay there every time i visit Seattle."
585418,12516779,2014-05-04,3772070,Tom,"As always, I am impressed with Angela.  The space is simple but I prefer it to a luxury hotel.  It's clean, organized, I feel at home there and Angela is the perfect host. I always look forward to staying here and highly recommend it for travelers like myself.  "
585418,12881670,2014-05-13,5617769,Rimiko,"Excellent stay in Seattle. As a young solo traveller, this was really everything I could ask for. A very safe neighborhood, so quiet and serene (and the view from the balcony was amazing as well). Angela was such a joy to be with, and I learned quite a couple of things from her. Impeccable hospitality :) Thanks Angela! If I ever do come back to Seattle again someday, I'll definitely stay here again! ^^ "
585418,13262455,2014-05-23,15695637,Chenjerai,Angela's cozy place and wonderful view were perfect for what I needed. Her place was in excellent condition and she went above and beyond the call of duty to make sure that I had the accommodations that I needed. I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on my next visit to Seattle!
585418,13999700,2014-06-09,16002871,Rory,"My experience with my stay was very short and limited, but that being said Angela was a very great host. I only met her briefly upon check in (I was out and about my entire one night stay) and she was quite a pleasant person. Great hospitality and I would most definitely utilize her rental again in any future stay in Seattle, without hesitation."
585418,14070317,2014-06-10,16155607,Max,"This was the perfect place to stay, the host is knowledgable and professional, she even let me in on all the local cafes, restaurants and hang out spots. One big surprise that I was not expecting was how amazing the view was, very incredible panorama of the surrounding mountains and town. "
585418,14215551,2014-06-14,10104185,Timothy,Angela was an incredible host. She happily accommodated a last minute reservation and saved the day for me. Her apartment is super nice and clean.

585418,14560389,2014-06-22,3772070,Tom,"This time, I had a week long work event and planned pretty far in advance.  As usual my stay was fantastic.  Angela bought a pastry for me at a local bakery and as always made her apartment a comfortable, quiet place for me to rest before each very busy day.  I'm very grateful for Angela's Airbnb offering and will continue to use it.  Angela is also a terrific hostess and fascinating to talk to."

I'm so glad to be her guest. Through the windows of her place, we can see a beautiful hill of Seattle. That scenery let us in good mood every morning. Angela really gave us an excellent travel experiment. "
585418,17268764,2014-08-10,8648277,Leo,I had a wonderful stay at Angela's place. It's location was great for me as I was attending a conference at IW which was 15mins walk away. The apt was just as described. Angela was very friendly and communicative. I would definitely stay there again! 
585418,17678186,2014-08-16,15990149,Po-Jung,"With a trail nearby, it's really a quiet place. although it takes sometime to get to downtown, just follow the trail heading for east, you will reach many amazing beach parks. Angela is truly a talkative person, btw."

Angela also provides clean towels and sweet welcome cards for me. The peanuts made by her grandma is yummy. What's more, Angela is a great host! She is smart, hospitable, and  funny. I enjoy the talking with her so much! If I go back to Seattle again, I'll choose Angela's place without hesitate."

In addition, Angela is just a really cool person who is very easy to talk to. I was in Seattle for my sister's wedding and was fairly stressed about other parts of my trip, so it was a major relief that my housing and host were so pleasant."
585418,19253748,2014-09-08,8532303,Carl,I loved my stay at Angela's place. It's such a cozy apartment with a lovely view of leafy Seattle through a panoramic window. Even though the bed was in the living space it really didn't matter and I felt more comfortable here than I have in private rooms at other airbnb places. Angela is great company and we had a nice chat in the evening. She did everything she could to make me welcome and even left little notes. I wish I could have state longer. If ever I'm back in Seattle I will definitely seek this place out again. 
585418,19399941,2014-09-11,5294850,Elizabeth,"When I was planning my trip to Seattle, I was def looking for a place that would feel homey and inviting.  Angela and her home are very much these things. Only downside was that I should have booked for a longer stay ;)!  Thanks Angela, for being a great intro to a great place!"

I was just in town for the one night so I did not have a chance to explore the neighborhood, but the room is neat and comfortable and the balcony is nice.  She is a lot of fun to talk to, too!  I would definitely stay here again when I'm back in Seattle."

한국 돌아온지 벌써 몇일이 지났네요.
잘 지내고 있지요? 
가기전에는 호스트와 같이 지내게 된다는게 조금은 불편할 것같아 걱정
했었는데, Angela가 너무 편하게 대해주고여러가지 소중한 정보도 알려줘서정말 많은 도움 됐어요. 잠자리도 편했고 쇼핑몰과 버스 정류장도 가까이 있어서 차 없이 생활하는데도 전혀 무리 없었습니다.
처음 만나는 사이였고 말도 잘 안통했는데도 Angela의 진심이 많이 느껴 졌었어요. Angela의 그런 따뜻함 때문에 많은 게스트들이 Angela 집을 찾나봅니다. 낯선곳에서 낯설지 않고 편한 여행 하게 해줘서 다시 감사해요.
그리고, 항상 적극적 이며 새로운 인연과 그 인연을 계속 연결해 가는 Angela의 밝은 성격이 정말 부럽답니다. 
항상 행복 하세요~!"
585418,20767019,2014-10-05,20461216,Gyeongsu," Angela, 저는 무사히 한국에 도착하였습니다. Angela 의 따뜻한 마음과 친절한 배려로 시애틀에서의 여행은 제게 잊을 수 없는 추억을 안겨주었습니다.
 저는 숙소에서 마치 편한 친구와 함께 이야기하고, 차를 마시고, 아름다운 경치를 구경하는 느낌이었습니다. 전혀 새로운 사람과의 만남으로 인한 어색한 감정이 들지 않았어요. 저에게 이렇게 훌륭한 숙소를 제공해 주고, 또한 좋은 친구가 되어준 Angela 에게 깊은 감사의 마음을 전합니다. 오랫동안 시애틀의 아름다운 경치,  친절한 사람들 그리고 Angela 와 함께 했던 소중한 시간들을 잊지 못할 거예요~! "

I stayed in Angela's house for 10days. She is very responsible and reliable person
and nice woman. She taught me speaking English and cooking healthy food and so on. Her house looks like my home and it is very comfortable to stay. We talked about own hometown and boyfriend or girlfriend and a lot of things. I really appreciate Angela, thank you."
585418,21727533,2014-10-22,6281526,Deepak,Angela is an amazing host. She made it feel like I am back home. I had no place to stay when I arrived in Seattle rather late at night and she was really kind to accept my request. This is the sort of thing that makes me stay away from hotels. I give her my highest recommendations. Thanks Angela.

585418,22079981,2014-10-29,22502772,Jennifer,"This was an amazing stay!! You couldn't ask for a better host. Besides being really great to talk to and hang out with, Angela is so prepared and generous. As someone interviewing, it was a huge deal that she already had the iron and ironing board out and ready. She was able to help me navigate the area, and gave great recommendations. The room is just as pictured - very clean, cozy, safe, and with all the amenities you could want. There is a park nearby that was great for running. There is also a fantastic coffee shop, numerous banks, and a retail shop area within easy walking distance. I wish I could have stayed longer!"

She has an extensive tea collection which was fun to sample, and the space in the apartment was really comfortable and quite private.  I was in town to visit the UW campus, and this location is a short walk to UW and nearby shops/restaurants."

Her apartment was very clean and the futon mattress was just perfect for both my sister and myself.  I felt very comfortable in her well-stocked kitchen and loved the fact that she is a foodie! 
Considering her apartment is in the university district, the neighborhood is amazingly quiet.  We were able to park on the street in front of her building; don't know if we were just lucky...
Obviously, from all of the notes on her bulletin board, we were not the only ones who immensely enjoyed our visit and meeting Angela."

585418,25357926,2015-01-13,24577290,Yang,The place is very close to UW. Angela provided detailed direction when I arrived at Seattle. She is very nice and accommodating. 
585418,25766172,2015-01-25,23462466,Brendan,Angela was a great host. She was very accommodating and respectful of my privacy. Nice neighborhood in a good location.
585418,25915222,2015-01-29,1321197,Miriam,Angela was a great host - accommodating and easy to talk to. The place is comfortable and central to the university. Recommended for anyone visiting the area.. Thanks! (:
585418,26136236,2015-02-04,23631386,Ankur,"My stay with Angela was great! She was great to talk with and very accommodating during my stay and even let me check-in early because my flight came in the morning.  She was respectful of my privacy and her place is close to UWash Medical Center and campus.  I recommend her place to anyone coming to Seattle, it is very clean, she has great tourist information and the bed is really comfortable.  I would definitely stay here again if I make it back to Seattle. Thanks Angela! "
585418,26219663,2015-02-07,17918783,Daisy,"This is my first Airbnb experience and I really enjoyed it. Our flight got delayed because of the weather but she was nice enough to stay up and greet us when we arrived. It is a nice place to stay, very quiet and close to UW campus. We didn't really have interactions with Angela except the night to got here. She really gave us a lot freedom and space to be relaxed."
585418,26983046,2015-02-23,25562975,Benjamin,"Angela was awesome! The space was very tidy and had great accommodations. I loved just how close it was to the UW campus, and all of the great things to do around that area."
585418,27171270,2015-02-27,26936007,Keehea,"My expectations were high and my experience with staying at Angela's place was far beyond my expectations. Her place is very nice and cost - as described and pictured (a bit of change in layout though), and closer to U-district and UW than I thought. Most of all, Angela is not only a perfect host but also a wonderful person that it was my pleasure talking to her during my stay. Hope I could visit Seattle and her place again sooner or later! :) "
585418,27771240,2015-03-11,27895398,Evette,"Angela was an excellent host! Her description of the space was completely accurate. I was really nervous about my trip because it was my first time traveling alone, but Angela made me feel at home. She recommended many great places for me to eat at and visit that have now become some of my favorites. I highly recommend anyone who enjoys the company of an amicable person to stay here. "
585418,27894134,2015-03-14,10476125,Ben,"Angela was a great host and I couldn't be more pleased with her being my first Airbnb host. She makes the comfort of her guests a priority and insures that their stay in Seattle is nothing less than excellent. Her apartment is less than 10 minutes by foot from UW (highly recommend visiting in mid/late March) and U-Village (where you can buy anything you do/don't need). 

In case you've never visited Seattle before, she has guides and maps readily available. Plus her Airbnb guidebook beats any published travel guide for Seattle, pick any of the destinations on it and you'll be guaranteed a wonderful visit! 

If you want somewhere to stay that's convenient, comfortable, and has a host that is down to talk about virtually anything over a Paseo sandwich, this is your place. I already loved Seattle before this visit, and after my stay with Angela I love it even more. I can't wait for my next trip."
585418,28034143,2015-03-16,4368007,Sascha,"I had an amazing stay in Angela's beautiful apartment. Talking with Angela, hearing her stories about Seattle and UW, was the highlight of my brief trip to Washington. She is a host I aspire to be. "
585418,29827826,2015-04-13,8727542,Nancy,"Angela was very inviting and warm and her place was as described. It's a quiet neighborhood and conveniently located.

I had a problem with the Air BnB website...they had her listed in the wrong area of town. I hope they've gotten it fixed because Angela is a wonderful, sincere host and deserves 5-star ratings!"
585418,29989240,2015-04-15,29919761,Jake,"Angela was a great host, flexible and gracious. I would highly recommend her apartment for anyone visiting Seattle. Very close to the U District and buses to all parts of the city. She also provided great advice for sight seeing and activities that may be off a visitor's radar such as a chocolate factory tour."
585418,30257274,2015-04-19,26386980,Victor,"Angela TOTALLY lived up to her ""reputation"" in the reviews as being such an incredibly personable host!  SHE IS COOL!!!  ABSOLUTELY EASY to talk to about ANYTHING and EVERYTHING!!!

She was SO ACCOMMODATING in planning how to meet up.  Was willing to meet early or late.  She kept in contact throughout.  Made it feel really easy.  THEN we met.  She was PERFECT!!!  VERY warm, friendly, and welcoming!  She had set up snacks for us and had numerous guides about things to do in the Seattle area.  She had even hand-written a really sweet note detailing things for us to know about our stay.  

She set us up with parking and offered us the travel card to get around.  

Before we arrived, she had set up an air mattress and a futon for us.  She said it might make the space tight but it really was not bad at all.  Her apartment is great!  Well decorated with beautiful pictures.  She even has a hammock and a nice view of one of the mountains from her balcony.  

She is very neat.  Her apartment is clean.  Bathroom, bedding, towels . . . everything is clean and neat.  

I LOVED staying with her and just regret not having had more time to get to know her better (since we got in late and had to leave early)!  Would LOVE, LOVE, LOVE to stay with her again.  The lodging is easy, neat, clean, and wonderful.  Angela is an amazing and interesting person with so much to share.  I LOVED talking with her and getting to know her!  

Such a GREAT combination!  This Airbnb concept, to me, is about finding clean, safe, and affordable lodging combined with meeting very good people.  Angela is not just a ""good"" person . . . she's GREAT!  SO HAPPY to have crossed paths with her!

THANK YOU, Angela!!!!"
585418,30369344,2015-04-20,20895512,Andreas,"Angela was a great host!  She was very flexible with my hours of checking in.  When I arrived she had maps and guides already out, and even made me a birthday card. We talked for about 2 hours about everything from science fiction to Europe.  Would definitely recommend staying here! "
585418,30487551,2015-04-22,10459959,Subhendu,"Angela, 
Was like a long lost friend :)
I have to eat almost all the cookies she had for herself and all her friends.
I had a excellent conversation and I would stay at her place again if she accepts the late booking :)
Thank you for the beagle and coffee, its like I made money :)
Thanks "
585418,31124239,2015-05-02,9785589,Imma,Angela is the best host ever!!! Loved the place aswell.
585418,31467850,2015-05-05,12590235,Alexandre,"Staying at Angela's is an experience in and of itself. Angela's super power allows her to find the best apartments and this place definitely showcases her remarkable skill! Her place is very serene, comfortable, and comes with a great view overlooking Seattle. I can see myself spending hours laying on the hammock in the balcony while enjoying the lovely view of the city. To top it off, Angela is simply amazing! She's one of the most brilliant people I've met yet. If I could take all the good traits one can say about a person, she's every single one of them and more! Chatting with and getting to know Angela will be what I will miss most from my visit to Seattle."
585418,31816863,2015-05-10,15547828,M.J.,Everything was perfect! Very close to UW and U Village. Quiet and clean place. Angela made me feel comfortable and provided everything I needed. I definitely would like to stay at her place again and recommend to others too. I wish I had more chance to talk to Angela because she is amazing! (She is very smart but also very nice and humble.) Thanks a lot for making my first airbnb experience wonderful! :)
585418,32397138,2015-05-17,32533867,Andrew,Angela is amazing. Being my first time using air bnb I was very impressed. Angela is a rock star. Air bnb is going to my regular thing to use when in need of a place to stay.
585418,32520167,2015-05-19,30560279,Sungmin,"I had a check-in later than planned, but Angela was flexible with the situation. There was a good communication before arriving to the place and check-in went smoothly. She has great knowledge of the city which helped a lot when I didn't have much time to see the city. Location is great and the house and the bed comfortable. I felt very at ease in a new city. Highly recommend staying here!!
Thanks again Angela."
585418,32799765,2015-05-21,8880284,Jun,"Angela is very hospitable and welcoming - to the extent that it feels as if you are staying at your close friend's place rather than a stranger's. She will share food and treats from her family with you.  

She's an engaging conversationalist, well-read, well-informed, and many stories to share; you won't have time to be bored.  

Her place feels very personable and friendly. The sheer volume of books at her place is astounding, and creates a cozy, analog vibe.  It's at optimal location for anyone visiting UW. "
585418,33138994,2015-05-25,24376990,Tiffany,"I ended up only staying one night and Angela was not present, so I had the apt to myself - which was nice. Although she wasn't there, she left detailed instructions for me. She was also available in the days prior to my arrival for discussing details.
I was staying at Angela's apt to be close to UW and even though I didn't have transportation to the venue, it was not a bad walk to and from there. University Village is also super close - tons of shops/restaurants!"
585418,33686796,2015-05-31,9114775,Farzaneh,"The listing description was very accurate, the space where Angela rents out is her living room. the sofa in the living room could qualify as almost a bed. She has done it up in a way that can give you a semi privacy . The neighborhood was nice and Angela was super helpful. I asked her if I could check in earlier than she suggested and she even took a taxi to be there on time. "
585418,35344711,2015-06-17,33251500,Ricardo,My stay in Seattle was great. What made it even greater was my stay with Angela. She was very accommodating and made herself available to answer any questions. Thank you Angela for your hospitality.
585418,35430469,2015-06-18,35653270,Kristi,"This was an awesome first experience with AirBNB! Angela is a lovely host and made sure I was able to find her place and was waiting for me to arrive to show me around her home and make sure I had everything I needed, including how to get around campus. Her home is lovely super clean with a lovely view and deck. It can best be described as studio style accommodation and though Angela was there I barely saw her and had ample privacy. The bed is also comfy! For anyone visiting Campus or Seattle I highly recommend Angela's AirBnB. "
585418,35522307,2015-06-19,27614279,Doug,"I had a brief business trip to Seattle and decided to stay at Angela's place. It was a very pleasant experience. The apartment is exactly as advertised and, although the sleeping quarters are in the living room, it is private, very clean and Angela is a very warm and classy host. 
The neighborhood is quiet, safe and close to the University.  Parking on the street was no problem. I would give Angela 5 stars!"
585418,35880549,2015-06-22,30568516,Sorcha,"Angela was a lovely, welcoming and helpful host! The space is really nice, clean and good location - would definitely recommend staying here!"
585418,36824139,2015-07-01,16758334,Eliza,"I liked the place a lot. It is a nice quiet place with awesome balcony to sit and relax.  Despite the outside heat it was cool inside the apartment. I had no problems with parking.

Angela is a nice, fun and open person. She was very welcoming. It was an incredibly hot day and she met me with a glass of cold water. She recommended me good places to hike and gave recommendations about Seattle transportation. 
I enjoyed staying at Angela's place very much.

"
585418,37384458,2015-07-06,20519042,Lott,"Angela was a welcoming and gracious host.  She provided detailed directions to her apartment and had iced water and beer upon arrival. We didn't cross paths after our first meeting, but she left a tidy house and I would highly recommend her place to anyone.  "
585418,38525562,2015-07-16,36450637,Sam,Angela was great. I hurt my foot right before my stay and she was incredibly helpful. The unit is clean and she makes you feel right at home. Definitely recommend! 
585418,39959263,2015-07-27,17075908,Daniel,"Angela hosted me despite the fact that her bar examinations were imminent and the last thing she needed was someone cluttering up her living room. I think this, more than anything, demonstrates her commitment to the AirBnB ideal and I really can't think of how Angela could've been a better host. Her apartment was beautiful and clean, and she made sure I had everything I needed. Whenever I had a question she responded incredibly swiftly, and although we mainly passed like ships in the night (I was in town for an academic conference), I still felt very welcome. The location of her apartment is in a delightful, beautiful neighborhood near the university to the Burke-Gilman trail. "
585418,42472404,2015-08-13,5596036,Thomas,"Maybe my best Airbnb experience. Angela will make you feel at home. The apartment is very cosy, extremely clean, and well located in a quiet area close to the trendy U district.
Even if this is a shared flat, your privacy will be totally respected by the host, Angela being extremely discreet. But that would be actually a pity to miss her happiness and sense of humor ! She will also provide you the best tips to enjoy the city, knowing the best places to eat or drink. No doubt that I'll stay at Angela's for my next stay in Seattle !"
585418,47946159,2015-09-21,34145417,Abeer,"Angela was super accommodating and very easy to talk to; we ended up spending hours just trading stories and she was super chill. Also introduced me to Heads Up and had way too much fun acting out random stuff. Also let me sleep in super late and gave me a ride to Fremont after. Really hope to hang out with her sometime again! Also the place was super cozy, filled with rows and columns of books. Probably best airbnb experience ever, no kidding"
585418,49059039,2015-09-30,44542971,Jesse,"Angela is a superb host, and extremely accommodating. The proximity to the UW campus was really important for us as we were attending a conference- to be able to walk to our destination and have a home base so close was invaluable. 

The space was inviting and had a beautiful view, the listing was extremely accurate. Angela had a great sense of when to check in with us, and for a shared apartment, our experience was almost that of a private room- Angela was almost invisible and so very respectful of our space and needs as guests. Great apartment with a fantastic host. I recommend it highly and hope to stay here again when we are in Seattle next!"
1956553,10708042,2014-03-03,7126979,Jean,"I highly recommend staying here at Mia & Chris'! Their home is clean, cozy, and very easy to get to (we had a car). They let us park in the driveway, which was awesome. Their home very accessible to all parts of Seattle. Its a few minutes drive to amazing restaurants in Capital Hill and a straight shot to downtown. 

There is a chicken coop in the back as well! I wanted to hug a chicken so badly!...but.... i personally ducked out at the last chance to do so... Turns out I was the chicken :(

The bathroom was great! The tub is deep and was such a luxury to take a bath in. They had a fully functional chefs kitchen that my boyfriend never got a chance to use. 

They key delivery and drop off was super easy. Communication was excellent. They were more than accommodating to my crazy flight schedule. 

What can I say? I had a great time! Thank you Mia and Chris!!!!"
1956553,10872293,2014-03-10,5691368,David,"Great Spot. Mia(& Chris) were easy to deal with. They were quick to respond, and very accommodating. The house was clean and simple, exactly as advertised. I even got some ideas to green up my own house. Would definitely stay here again."
1956553,11098528,2014-03-20,4658416,Thomas,"Very comfortable stay. House had everything we needed - full kitchen, comfortable furnishings, good heating. Best of all, CLEAN. Loved the farm and yard, great for sitting/relaxing. It was eye-opening, seeing how you can kind of live off the grid in an urban area. "
1956553,11160789,2014-03-23,13038887,Jan,"Mia and Chris have a quaint, clean home very close some to great attractions, including the Washington Park Arboretum and some good restaurants and shops near Lake Washington.  Also a very easy drive to Seattle's downtown.  Great location.
Arranging details with Mia was very simple and she provided lots of good information to assist our stay.  One of the most delightful aspects of the stay was enjoying the back garden with it's multiple raised beds, and talking to the chickens.  We were invited to enjoy the eggs we found in the fridge too.  Delicious! Felt like staying in the home of a friend.  Thanks Mia and Chris!"
1956553,12315990,2014-04-28,2542378,J.R.,"We loved this place. Comfortable house, great location. Chickens are always a bonus."
1956553,13425645,2014-05-27,14480155,Samantha,10 out of 10 would visit again.
1956553,13975216,2014-06-09,15297406,Alice,"The urban farm was clean, tidy and exactly as pictured. Communication with Mia was quick and easy. Their backyard space and garden is impressive and although we didn't cook at the house we appreciated their generous offer for us to harvest lettuce, kale and radish. We did enjoy the farm fresh eggs, however! Location is a convenient short drive to Seattle core. The neighborhood was good for a lovely morning walk. Essential Bakery, few blocks north, serves delicious coffee and pastry and 1/2 mi east is the shore of lake Washington. Thanks for the hospitality. "
1956553,14241971,2014-06-15,15964324,Abby,"We had an amazing stay at The Urban Farm! The house was beautiful, clean and cozy and we felt right at home immediately. We were able to relax out back in the garden and watch the chickens, which was fun! Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to taste the eggs, but appreciated the offer from Mia and Chris. 
We also loved the neighborhood the house is located in and it's only a short drive to Cap hill and downtown Seattle. Staying here made it very hard to leave at the end of the week. "
1956553,15399046,2014-07-08,15096701,Elvira,Mia and Chris's house was so lovely! It was cozy and farm-y and just what we needed! My family and I enjoyed eating the chicken eggs and harvesting some of the snap peas and lettuce. It gave us such an interesting perspective on Seattle! It was nice to have an at-home feeling in such an urban city.
1956553,15684452,2014-07-14,1717429,Lauren,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this beautiful home! It was close both to the airport and to downtown Seattle. The home was clean, well-taken care of, and had everything we needed. We absolutely loved being able to get fresh eggs and veggies from the backyard. Mia and Chris responded to questions right away and there were no issues. We highly recommend this space!!  "
1956553,16089692,2014-07-22,15897573,Tom,"Mia and Chris were great hosts.  They were gone for our trip so i never met them personally. However, they were certain to have a clean well prepared home by the time we arrived. The house comes with an electronically coded door which took away the hassle of exchanging keys. The home is on a somewhat busy street, but the bedroom is cozy and quiet.  Overall, great experience."
1956553,16987012,2014-08-05,4252837,Ryan,"11 out of 10. I would highly recommend staying at Mia and Chris's Urban Farm to anyone visiting Seattle.  It was very easy and flexible when checking in and out without the hassle of exchanging keys.  It's conveniently located near Capitol Hill & Downtown with easy access to public transportation or a short walk (which we choose).  They were quick to respond to any questions we had and even left a detailed list of their favorite activities, restaurants and coffee shops in the area.  

Although we didn't harvest any of the veggies, fruit or eggs they made available to us in their backyard we did enjoy walking around and getting a few ideas to take back home with us.  The entire house is so unique and seeing how they have made their home soo energy efficient was very impressive.  After checking out we've stayed in contact with Mia and Chris and we'll be touching base soon to get a few tips and tricks on how to build a smaller version of our own urban garden in the near future."
1956553,17358281,2014-08-11,1826567,T.,What a wonderful and welcoming home to arrive to!  It was cozy and comfortable.  Although we did not have time to spend in the backyard we did walk through it to see the nicely grown edible garden and the nice chickens happily in their coup. My husband and I took a relaxing 5-10 min stroll down to a quaint street lined with sweet shops and restaurants.  Our favorite is Cafe Flora!  Went there everyday!  The neighbor hood and Washington Park are beautiful!  I loved that it was so close to Capital Hill and Downtown Seattle.  I would definitely stay here again and Highly Recommend it to anyone!
1956553,17944549,2014-08-19,12815122,Ashley,"Mia and Chris' urban farm was quite quaint and convenient. The produce and eggs add a nice touch. They also make an effort to stock the pantry and toiletries with great organic, sustainable products. I'm a fan! I didn't use many of the amenities since I was mostly exploring the city when not  sleeping, but Mia and Chris clearly care about the details. Their home is very clean and organized. Make sure you determine how to open the house (and find it) before you get there. From the other reviews, I had the impression that someone would be meeting me there. Everything worked out perfectly though! Also, public transit from the airport was quite easy. And there are a few great food/coffee options within walking distance. Thank you!"
1956553,18427543,2014-08-26,6471925,Nina,"We had a lovely stay.  The house was as described - clean, comfortable and conveniently located.  It was easy to access the home using the key pad lock.  We would definitely book it again.  "
1956553,18804875,2014-09-01,8618515,Cicilia,"Great sustainable living experience,  we loved fetching our morning breakfast of eggs and tomatoes. It was in a great location close to everything we needed. We really felt like we were locals in seattle."
1956553,19197219,2014-09-08,12016059,Janneke,"Lovely house in a very nice location. We visited Seattle for 2 days en enjoyed staying at Mia and Chris. The house is clean, the bed sleeps nice and everything you need is right here. Communication running up to our visit was good and quick. This was our first Airbnb stay and I hope our next airbnbs are as enjoyable as this one was."
1956553,20064127,2014-09-22,4184335,Elizabeth,"We had a wonderful time at this urban farm house. I really enjoyed the fresh tomatoes and eggs. The house was very clean and comfortable. The location was also nice, we enjoyed breakfast and dinner (Bottlehouse) in the nearby Madrona neighborhood. Also, the house has inspired my boyfriend to make an urban farm in our backyard! We'd definitely stay here again!"
1956553,20458127,2014-09-29,21366574,Meredith,"Chris and Mia's house was just as described. It was easy to find and was a short drive to downtown. The house was clean, small but spacious, and comfortable. The chickens provided entertainment and the garden was huge. We stayed for 3 days and it was a perfect place for three people (as long as one doesn't mind sleeping on a couch!). I would definitely recommend their place to others!"
1956553,21156832,2014-10-12,5146394,Zachary,"This airbnb was wonderful! The backyard space was lovely, the space was cozy. I had an excellent time there."
1956553,24442684,2014-12-28,19737248,Anna,Mia & Chris's home was everything we expected and more.  I loved how eco friendly it was and the ascetic of the house was lovely.  They did a great job outlining everything about the home and made it easy. The location made it really simple to get around Seattle.  
1956553,28035234,2015-03-16,720413,George,"We appreciated having clear directions for access to the cottage, a household manual, and contact information.  We are very familiar with Seattle and the cottage is in a great location.  "
1956553,28345538,2015-03-22,9061846,Tina,"A lovely space in a great neighborhood. Checking in was seamless, and the house is clean, well-organized, and super cute. Even the couch is pretty comfy to sleep on. We had a great time!"
1956553,29112194,2015-04-04,387679,Tamara,"Very communicative and responsive hosts and a great little house in a centrally located and convenient neighborhood.  I didn't get a chance to grab any fresh eggs from the chickens, but it would be a definite highlight for any guests.  And the backyard was lovely...wish I had more time to spend out there.  Thanks so much!"
1956553,30248135,2015-04-19,16757095,Sarionna,"We had such a lovely time at Mia and Chris's! The house was easy to get to, lots of parking, and in an absolutely perfect location; close to everything in the city, but in a nice quiet neighborhood. It was clean, organized and I loved that they compost and garden.  We had some amazing Ethiopian food that was walking distance, and got to see the beautiful Arboretum and gardens just a few minutes away. We loved waking up to the sunshine and drinking our tea outside on the patio. Will definitely be staying here again in the near future! "
1956553,30816266,2015-04-27,31049844,Brandon,"Had a great stay here!  The house had everything one could want in a home - and a great backyard.  Check in was easy, all appliances were very high quality, and communication with Mia was particularly fast and friendly.  Wished I could have stayed longer!"
1956553,31846167,2015-05-10,1892800,Ashley,"Mia's place was great!!! Perfect for my husband and I. Comfortable bed. Place is clean. Loved the neighborhood!!! Madrona is a cute little part of town 15 mins walk from house.  Great to grab a bite and glass of wine. 

Highly recommend her place!!! "
1956553,32650545,2015-05-19,4482226,Andrew,"Mia and Chris made it simple to check-in and check-out.

We found the place very clean and comfortable and will definitely be back if we find ourselves visiting Seattle again.

The neighborhood is convenient for groceries, cafes and restaurants and the backyard garden was relaxing to sit in.

Thanks!

1956553,32991271,2015-05-24,28763677,Jonathan,What a beautiful home and neighborhood! It was extremely comfortable. The neighborhood was peaceful and bus transportation was convenient. I was able to take the 8 bus all the way to Seattle Center and visit the space needle and museums. 5 out of 5 
1956553,33844533,2015-06-01,26795465,Carrie,Staying here was a dream come true. A peaceful oasis in the middle of a bustling city. The house was so clean and well kept. Mia and Chris graciously set up everything we would need. It was so nice to sit in the backyard with the chickens! We even had fresh eggs for breakfast! We didn't want to leave. Thank you Mia and Chris!
1956553,34225125,2015-06-06,3265015,Jeff,"This place is great. They have even more than what you need. Soaps, shampoos, towels, laundry detergent, a washer and dryer.. It's like staying with family. The setting is bucolic and beautiful, quiet and relaxing. The farm in back is a great place to just sit and ruminate. Overall a great place, do something nice for yourself! Stay here!"
1956553,34440358,2015-06-08,31820608,Lorrie,"Wow!  What a great place to stay!  Although we didn't meet Mia & Chris, we understood that someone was available to help us if needed...but Mia and Chris left so much valuable information for us that we totally felt right at home in their home:)  Park was great!  Neighborhood was nice and we felt safe when we took our early morning walks.  EASY to travel to downtown Seattle.  We got up early and took off running and came back late to drop into the comfy bed."
1956553,34961017,2015-06-14,17999835,Steve,"I loved everything about this place. It is exactly as described. Neighborhood is really great. A major bus line goes down the street, so if you want to forget about a rental car and just do bus + Lyft or Uber, you'll be fine.  You can definitely walk to a great bakery/cafe and a few restaurants. The grocery store (Safeway) is a stretch, as it is up a steep hill.  House was totally quiet - bedroom is in back and we had no trouble sleeping. "
1956553,35557202,2015-06-20,31823539,Matthew,"House is located about 10 minutes from downtown area near stadiums and pike place so it was a little further than we expected but overall the house/farm was a great experience. They had all kinds of fruits and veggies that you could snack on while hanging out with the chickens. And Chris and Mia were easily accessible if needed. Perfect place if you're looking for a spot to lay your head at night. No TV, but you shouldn't even need one if your truly interested in seeing the city. "
1956553,36398338,2015-06-28,33149652,Wynelle,"We had such a good time at Mia and Chris's home. They made us feel so welcomed. It was spotless and great to have a full size refrigerator! We spent both evenings enjoying the awesome back yard with our daughter, her husband, their 2 year old daughter and 4 day old son. I would highly recommend it to anyone. "
1956553,37314058,2015-07-06,26264306,Kiik,"This is a really fantastic spot to stay in Seattle. It felt to me like a very safe and quiet family neighborhood. Probably less than a 15 min. gorgeous walk to the arboretum and botanic gardens. As well as only 15-20 min. walk to all the exciting stuff in Capitol Hill. 

Kitchen has a really cute kitchen nook. Lots of great skillets, knives, equipment to cook with. Coop and Trader Joes about 10 min. walk away. 

Mia and Chris also grow an amazing garden in back. We tried some lettuce and chard, and it was delicious. There are also some pretty cute chickens. Some benches and tables - really fantastic place to just sit and read or chill. 

Just be a little careful getting out of the bed. It's a little close to the wall and easy to stub a toe or scratch a shin. Agile (or non-clumsy) people will be totally fine though.

1956553,37692982,2015-07-09,34531435,Sylvia,"The house is very nice, the appliances are all quite new and work very well. We were especially thankful for the air conditioning given the recent bout of heat. Our stay would have been perfect if it wasn't for the state of cleanliness that the floors, window seals and many surfaces were in when we arrived. We only stayed 2 nights, the first of which we spent about a half hour sweeping and wiping up dusty cobwebs and dirt. Just to clarify this is not a bad house to stay in at all, in fact it is very charming and cozy, however it definitely needs a thorough cleaning and it would be a perfect getaway. "
1956553,38423241,2015-07-15,15103996,Chris,"This was the perfect spot for my wife and I while we were in Seattle for vacation. It was centrally located, clean, spacious and fun. "
1956553,38641769,2015-07-17,4636297,Barbara Lynn,"We had a great stay. Mia's place is clean, organized and comfortable. And the beautiful garden out back is a perfect place to read and drink coffee. We felt very at home v The house is also super close to some great local food and drink (coffee and beer) as well as a Trader Joes for staples. "
1956553,38868811,2015-07-19,17267469,Emily,"The place was great! Very unique, clean when we arrived and pretty convenient to Seattle center."
1956553,40758399,2015-08-02,35898736,Victoria,"Mia and Chris' listing is just as pictured. Cozy, comfortable and quite clean. The kitchen is quite well equipped and they made staples and fresh veggies available - and fresh eggs from their backyard chickens! This home is an excellent example of living gently on the planet. Guests will be inspired by the many efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle.
We were very grateful that the house had AC during yet another hot spell in Seattle. The backyard garden is lovely and peaceful.
The location was very convenient for us."
1956553,41411353,2015-08-07,132846,Taylor,Mia's urban farm house was absolutely perfect! It is an inspiring home that proves that it isn't that difficult to live sustainably and provide for yourself. We enjoyed our several days in Seattle and this home enhanced our experience!
1956553,41971821,2015-08-10,6656068,Rob,"This is a great spot for exploring the neighborhood and Seattle. We loved walking to Washington Park and the local shops, and getting downtown was painless too. The house is well equipped with everything you'll need for a short stay, and Chris and Mia's research into building their urban farm and oasis is on display in the book shelves, as well as their travel books and other cool stuff. The house has a great personality because of this. Coming from Chicago and having discussed our own desires to start more planting in our own yard, this was a really inspirational stay. And our 19 month old daughter loved the chickens and the farm. Our only regret is that we didn't stay longer."
1956553,42407576,2015-08-13,5461378,Marc,"Great base for exploring Seattle. Cozy & comfortable accommodations with a beautiful backyard to relax in. #8 bus stops right down the street, and will take you through Capital Hill or drop you off at the Space Needle, where you can walk or take light rail to the rest of downtown. Just far enough that you could still pop back to shower and change between sightseeing and dinner out."
1956553,43419304,2015-08-19,9215119,Leah,"I absolutely loved this home. Our flight came in early so we ran into the caretaker, who was super nice and very welcoming. He showed us around the home and the garden in the backyard, along with the chickens (who we got fresh eggs from each day!) we made our entire breakfast from the eggs and veggies from the yard! The owners are very eco friendly, home was very clean, and this home was near everything. Less than a 10 min drive to downtown and 5 min to the water. Walking distance to several restaurants (which all had amazing food!) This home was in the perfect location for me and a great price! "
1956553,43998903,2015-08-23,3770736,Peter,"Stayed for a long weekend and had a wonderful time seeing the sites of Seattle. Super simple check-in. Great location with easy access on the bus downtown or a short Uber ride. Amazing to have fresh eggs in the morning straight from the hen coop. Peaceful, beautiful garden. And Mia and Chris were very responsive to our questions."
1956553,45374792,2015-09-02,2147070,Lisette,"This house was a great place to stay on our trip to Seattle. It was conveniently located (we had a car, so it was only a short drive to all of the main Seattle tourist spots and Capital Hill), well-appointed, and nicely decorated so it felt very home-y. It was also very affordable compared to other similar listings in Seattle, which was very helpful. We really loved being able to pick a few ripe tomatoes from the garden and fry up some very fresh chicken eggs, too! I would highly recommend this house as a place to stay for a visit in Seattle."
1956553,45953279,2015-09-07,32724380,Nick,"From the moment I walked in, I felt right at home. Every little extra step was done in making this a wonderful place to stay :) 
Large book shelf with plenty of quality reading material,
Full kitchen with all utensils anyone would need to make a decent meal,
a plethora of fresh veggies and eggs in the backyard/garden,
and a full sheet of instructions and how to's for any question you would possibly have.

In pair with a great location, with multiple bus stops in walking distance, as well as corner stores and grocery's - and even a recreational dispensary ;)
I'd recommend Mia (& Chris)'s home to anyone looking for a comfortable weekend (or longer) stay in Seattle. 
It's just east of Capitol Hill, and about a mile east of the location is a beautiful body of water or walking path.

5/5"
1956553,47061086,2015-09-15,18974585,Sarah,"Summary: Great location, nice host, beautiful garden, okay indoor amenities/condition.

Pros:
-Great location with easy access to all of Seattle. 
-Mia was easy to communicate with to set up the stay and very welcoming. A very smooth transaction all around.

Cons:
- The bedroom was quite small and difficult to navigate without bashing one's shins on the bedframe. 
- The space didn't feel particularly private as the gorgeous backyard garden and chickens required daily visits from caretakers. This was expressed upfront, but the foot traffic around the house was more than I had anticipated.
- The home's general cleanliness fell short of my expectations. The bathtub in particular was funky.

1956553,47718882,2015-09-21,31858392,Justin,Loved staying here. It was a great place for my wife and I to get away.
1956553,48521178,2015-09-27,39395927,Jill,"The house is lovely, convenient and quiet. The garden is a particular gift. All our needs were met and our stay was easygoing."
1956553,49165439,2015-10-01,12516515,Alexander,"Stayed for a few baseball games mid-week, and this house couldn't have been better. We were located near all amenities and transportation we needed! A short ride from downtown, or a nice walk! The garden out back was simply delightful, and the whole stay will be remember fondly. I highly recommend this house!"
1956553,49539506,2015-10-04,17222229,Josh,"I had a fantastic time at Mia and Chris' home, it lead to a very quiet and relaxed weekend in Seattle. It's in a great spot, with plenty of places to walk to and enjoy the neighborhood. If you're interested in exploring the city, I had no trouble getting an Uber and no ride was more than $20 to most popular touristy spots. 

I never saw the weekend chicken caretaker, so no complaints! The shower leaves a bit to be desired, given the temperature was very fickle. 

Other than that, this place would be great for a couple and a friend, or even to have a few people over to enjoy a meal and listen to music. 

I appreciated the hospitality!"
1956553,49802729,2015-10-06,6611062,Châu,"My parents and I stayed for 2 nights. The house is very cozy and had everything we needed. The garden is absolutely adorable. We had fresh eggs and some tomatoes everyday. The location is also great, everything is within 5-10 mins driving. The only issue we had was there're some small moths/flies came in the house, even though we kept the door closed at all time. Overall still a great place for the value, I'd definitely recommend! "
4783585,25281027,2015-01-11,23543568,Becky,Great location and the place was lovely!  Marilyn was always very quick to respond to any questions we had throughout the process.  We had such a great time.  Thank you!!
4783585,25574803,2015-01-19,17966129,Adam,"This condo is in the perfect location. I'm a frequent traveler to Seattle and will stay in this building for every trip in the future, if possible. Be aware that the second bedroom has very little extra room. Very little. My bag stayed in the living room because there was such little space. Not a complaint from me, just might be an issue if you are not with family or someone you completely trust. The trade off for the lack of space was the balcony. Loved having it at the foot of the bed. The unit was very tidy and check in was a breeze. Marilyn was very responsive and I felt like I could reach her anytime had I needed to. I would definitely recommend staying here."
4783585,26529933,2015-02-15,25758881,Megan,The apartment was very comfortable and the amenities as well. It is located in a safe neighborhood and within walking distance of many great Seattle destinations. I would definitely recommend the place for a weekend getaway or if in the city on business.
4783585,28215834,2015-03-20,27861565,Yangchun,"It was such a pleasant place and made our trip unforgettable in Seattle. The apartment is spacious and really cozy with beautiful decorations. The listing description was accurate and the apartment has almost everything you need for a comfortable stay.  The kitchen was great and has all equipment you need for fixing a feast including seasoning, cooking ware and dishes. We were able to cook breakfast and you can also get fresh seafood from the market and cook it in the apartment.  Our host is very friendly and patient. I really appreciate the time and help she kindly offered and made such a welcoming environment for her guests. The neighborhood is fantastic as well. It has several nice bars with tasty food and there is also a famous sushi place right next to the apartment building which was full of people waiting in line every time we passed by. The neighborhood is pretty safe and there was no problem walking at late night. And it was couple blocks away from Pike Market and other tourists’ attractions. "
4783585,28632960,2015-03-27,29133469,Maria,This is our first AirBnB accommodation.  Our experience is very satisfactory.  Marilyn was very responsive and patient.  We would stay at her place again.  
4783585,30460389,2015-04-22,5075831,Ciaran,"Marilyn's place was great. Lots of great restaurants nearby and only 10 min walk to downtown and same to the needle.
The place was really clean and everything was well explained, a really smooth check in and out.
I'd highly recommend staying here"
4783585,31226598,2015-05-03,392322,Jorge,"We really enjoyed staying in this great Belltown apartment. The unit was very clean, well-appointed, and within walking distance to many of the major sights: 15 min to Seattle Center/Space Needle, the Aquarium, or the Public Library, and 10 min to Pike Place Market.

Marilyn was a great host - she accommodated a late night arrival and facilitated a late checkout.

We'd love the opportunity to stay here again in the future."
4783585,32211293,2015-05-15,8973622,Stephen,Marilyn is a very professional host. The apartment is a very good value. It was clean and airy. Great location. The only problem is the internet drove me nuts! I had to keep rebooting the modem. This not a bit deal unless someone is sleeping the the bedroom that contains the modem. Since I usually am traveling for business internet access issues add a lot of stress to my day. I am giving a five star review because Marilyn said she would deal with the problem shortly and I believe her. Without the internet problem the apartment and Marilyn are a five star experience especially when one considers the cost. 
4783585,32857299,2015-05-22,25850353,Kaja,"This is a very nice listing with a great view. Very spacious and great layout. If you are coming to Seattle for pleasure definitely try to grab this spot. Also this spot is in walking distance of Pike Place Market and other great spots to visit.

NOTE: the internet is not reliable so if you are planing on doing work you may have to do it in a coffee shop down the street."
4783585,34053665,2015-06-04,28757439,Katy,"We loved our stay here and would definitely book again on another visit to Seattle.  The location is great - close to everything and with lots of very good restaurants within easy walking distance (we especially recommend Shiro and Black Bottle).  The kitchen is well equipped and everything worked well, which enabled us to have breakfast in the condo and cook one dinner as well with buys from Pike's Market.  Marilyn was very prompt in responding to inquiries and allowed us to check in early since there was no one staying the night before - something we really appreciated given our long flight that morning from the East Coast.  Everything on the website was accurate.  No complaints!"
4783585,35196703,2015-06-16,26896691,Brian,"This apartment was excellent!   We were able to walk to local restaurants, cafes, markets, and attractions with this prime location.  Access to and from the building was straight forward and the instructions for checking in and out were easy to follow.  We rented a car and ended up using the parking lot with ease as well.  When we showed up the place was perfectly cleaned and ready for our arrival.  The unit was also well stocked with all the supplies you needed.  Marilyn responded within minutes of every question we had and was a real pleasure to work with.  Bottom line is if we came back to Seattle, we would try and stay at this place again!"
4783585,36265174,2015-06-27,2613201,Jenny,Nice place to stay in a great location - easy to walk to lots of great stuff. 
4783585,37135544,2015-07-05,19061748,Louise,Myself & husband & 2 friends stayed at Marilyn's apartment for 2 nights at the beginning of July. It was as described & in a good location - close to they main attractions & a few nice restaurants/bars. Marilyn was always super quick at getting back to me & also accommodated a later check out which was greatly appreciated. We had no problem at all with the wifi. 
4783585,37958728,2015-07-12,7582648,Racquel,"I stayed at Marilyn's place for 3 nights with my family and we just loved her place! The apartment was stocked with extra sleeping items which made it very accommodating since there was 6 of us. We really appreciated that there was an indoor pool and spa in the complex. We did a lot of walking and when we wanted to rest we just went to the pool/spa area to relax. 

The location of the apartment is fantastic! It's a half a mile from Pikes Place Market, and half a mile from the Space Needle. Also just downstairs of the apartment there were many good restaurants and bars to go to. I would definitely recommend friends and family members to stay here if they are visiting Seattle!"
4783585,43492285,2015-08-20,2214702,Jordan,"Beautiful apartment in awesome building and terrific location, able to walk to most everything we wanted to see in the city.  Very clean and well equipped (even portable A/C for use at night during the hot spell).  We were a couple with an adult daughter, and the 2BD/1BA layout had plenty of space for us.  Highly recommend!"
4783585,47280573,2015-09-17,34317477,Jon,"We stayed here from September 14th to 17th and it has everything we were looking for! The condo has an excellent location in the Belltown area. Easy walking distance to many restaurants and local attractions. The condo does have a nice partial view of the Puget Sound and is well appointed with everything you need to make yourself at home while visiting. The instructions that Marilyn provided made it easy to access the condo and clearly answered most of the standard questions that may come up during your stay. I would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a nice, quiet location but is centrally located in the city."
4783585,48501388,2015-09-27,10330949,Jane,"Marilyn responded very quickly to any message, had a nice basket of goodies waiting. Neighborhood, location is excellent.
Walk everywhere, great restaurants."
4783585,50428490,2015-10-12,8400796,Lindsay,"The apartment is located in a really great area of the Belltown neighborhood in Seattle. The secure garage parking space that is included with the rental is an incredible amenity for a downtown Seattle rental. The apartment had everything that we needed for our five-day stay and the host supplied a starter kit of basic necessities that included toilet paper, paper towel, soaps, etc. The apartment was very clean, easy to access, and the main living spaces were very comfortably laid out. There was an ironing board, iron, and clothes steamer, which all came in very handy during our stay!

The only concern that we had was the size of the 2nd bedroom. We understood that the 2nd bedroom didn't have a closet, but we weren't aware that the room was so tiny that while sitting on the bed a person could easily reach and touch all four walls. There was only room for one nightstand in the room, which was located on one side of the king bed. We had to turn sideways and sidestep around the bed to get in and out of the room. 

The 2nd bedroom also didn't have a closet, which we knew before we secured the rental. But this meant that we had to hang clothes on the curtain rod that is located above the sliding balcony door in the room. Hanging clothes on the curtain rod led to additional difficulty maneuvering around the bed, as we had to duck down under the hanging clothes. We would suggest that a smaller bed be put in the 2nd bedroom so that a person could stand next to the bed to get dressed and not have to monopolize the one bathroom while getting dressed. Creating slightly more space in the 2nd bedroom would make it more convenient for two people to use the room, especially if a 2nd nightstand could be added. A 2nd nightstand would help for storage of toiletries, cell phones, etc. 

The lack of a closet in the 2nd bedroom and constrained space of the room forced us to leave all of our toiletries, cell phones, clothes, jackets, and shoes out in the living room. This worked for us because we only had four people staying at the apartment. However, the apartment is advertised to accommodate up to six people. We really don't know how the apartment could accommodate six people (and any luggage) for more than a day or two. 

All of this being said, we had an excellent trip, the cleanliness of the apartment, the ease of check-in and check-out, and all of the amenities that were included made the trip very enjoyable. We would absolutely stay there again the next time we travel to visit our family in Seattle."
4783585,50810417,2015-10-14,25288971,Colin,"Great location, easy to access, clean and comfy."
4783585,51266249,2015-10-19,35411286,Kevin,"This place was perfect! Great location, great neighborhood, great building, and it was exactly as described. Marilyn was very responsive throughout the whole process, and everything went off without a hitch. This was my first time staying at an Airbnb and I was extremely impressed!"
4783585,52691002,2015-11-01,39872783,Nelson,"Marilyn Simon's lovely 2BD is all what you need to get away from home and downtown if you are at a conference near the convention center. It is the perfect alternative to a hotel with one room, one bath, and noisy hotel guests. This is quiet, clean, perfect, and tastefully furnished and designed. The description of the apartment is accurate, the appliances are top notch, to two shower heads, for two, and sharing and saving water... ;-)  are perfect. Two bedrooms, a 'great room' serving as a dining and living room space; just like a home a way from home. No detailed has been missed, she has left strategically some wonderful and informative brochures and magazines on what to do in Seattle, you can bring you car rental but why bother.. walk the city!

For those who can't live without TV, checked! Music surround sound to relax or dance in a proper non disturbing the neighbors manner, check! WiFi with an impressive 50 gigabyte download and 20 upload... check.  (I provide this because some techno addicts will want to know if they can Hulu or Netflix binge? while working on some obscure report only they and colleagues will read. 

Just bring yourself, an umbrella or not, and enjoy the neighborhood, minutes to the Space Needle, 10-15 walk to Pike Place Market, even 20 minute walk to downtown city center and shop till you drop! Or take Uber. I know, clichés galore. You get, a view, comfy beds, a sleeper sofa too. A local bakery, coffee shop, and World's Market too... All withing walking distance. What else can you ask? Clean, secure, and with many choices to eat around. I give it 2 thumbs up, three full circles and 4 snaps! I will return to see more of what I missed and this is a great home-base to do so."
4783585,54014196,2015-11-15,47514932,Lisa,Great place and a great location.  Only about a 5 minute walk to Pike Place market. Marilyn had a small gift basket of necessities for us and there were even robes provided.  Would definitely stay again!
4783585,55269453,2015-11-29,48695065,Bozhou,"A prefect room with a prefect location, it's a very good choose for those travelers who wants to deeply discover Seattle and it's culture. Both 2bd are very comfortable and have so many interesting things. "
4783585,56137589,2015-12-09,17966129,Adam,This was my second stay in this unit and everything was just as expected. Highly recommend this unit and working with Marilyn.
254340,780157,2011-12-12,1442497,Jason,"Waaay better than hoped for.  Felt like a new, cozy, fully furnished apt. Not to mention spotless. Surprising treats and all the amenities and a few extras.  Hosts went out of their way to be helpful and accomodating.  3 minute walk to restaurants and pubs.  I'll be staying here in the future.  Perfect access for Ballard and Fremont. "
254340,804180,2011-12-24,1502705,Todd,"This was very comfortable, clean, and modern.  The hosts were very nice, and wanted to make sure that everything was ok.  The neighborhood was nice and the parking was good in front of the house."
254340,809868,2011-12-28,1356259,Kelsey,The apartment is wonderful - beautifully decorated and so roomy and comfortable! This was the perfect place for my parents to stay over the holidays. The owners were incredibly thoughtful and their attention to detail with the amenities was outstanding. Will recommend it to all my friends visiting from out of town as the perfect oasis for guests!
254340,852386,2012-01-09,578470,Kirk,"With the Phinney Oasis, Kim has created a most comfortable place to stay in Seattle. My partner and I were in town for the MLA conference, which took place at the Convention Center downtown. The commute was a piece of cake, and it was a real delight for us to be able to escape the conference and enjoy the many excellent eateries, etc. on Phinney Ridge and nearby Ballard and Fremont. Kim is a great host: she provided us with delicious artisan bread, etc. for breakfast, and she and her husband were readily available to answer any questions. 

We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and hope to be back soon. "
254340,863565,2012-01-15,1538125,Benjamin,"We had an amazing time in this lovely, clean, convenient apartment. The place was sparkling clean and we immediately felt at home with the new appliances, heated bathroom floor and comfy mattress. Kim checked in on us to make sure we were OK and had wonderful suggestions about things to do in Seattle during our stay. I would recommend this place to everyone!"
254340,953654,2012-02-27,231512,Adam,Wonderful place.  Had everything I could have possibly needed.  Excellent location too.
254340,977265,2012-03-06,736953,Michelle,"Kim and Steven were great hosts. The place was well stocked for food supplies, even some delicious fresh bread. Recommendations for places in the area were great and they were always reachable if we had any questions. The bed was very comfortable and cozy. I will definitely recommend this place to my friends. "
254340,987809,2012-03-11,1654658,Wayne,"Wonderful, newly renovated flat on the basement level. Great location to Phinney-Ballard-Greenlake neighborhoods. Apartment had everything - sitting area, dining area, full kitchen, shower stall bathroom, plenty of closets, own entrance, etc.

Hosts Kim and Stewart were very organized and communicated prior to arrival and went out of their way for a special request. They also have a lot of local information available in the apt. We only saw them briefly as we were out and about most of the days. They were available with tips about the area when asked.

254340,1036229,2012-03-24,1251998,Hilke,Kim and Stewart are gorgeous hosts. The apartment is really great and you will find everything you need. When I arrived the fridge was already filled up with some basics so that I didn’t have to go to the grocery on the day of arrival. They were always happy to help and gave me a lot of recommendations for activities in the surrounding neighborhoods. It is a great place to stay in Seattle and much more familiar than staying in a hotel. I definitely recommend this place!
254340,1268225,2012-05-12,603020,Jennifer,"Stewart and Kim were very friendly and made sure we had all that we needed for a comfortable stay.  The apartment was immaculate when we got it, with a good amount of light and privacy.  We would definitely go back again!"
254340,1344897,2012-05-25,1877788,Stefanie,"Kim and Stewart are very gracious hosts. We enjoyed our conversations with them about Seattle and what was going on in life... like we were old friends. They even brought ""new"" toys for our son to play with. The suite is kept very well and had all the amenities we needed, plus it was spacious enough to allow us to separate during our week's stay. Great shower, comfy bed and clean accommodations. Ceiling height might be a consideration for tall people. Thank you! "
254340,1568624,2012-06-26,2514104,Erica,"Kim and Stewart were lovely hosts!  The studio is very comfortable and was perfect for my little family.  They even provided a pack and play for my son, which was very convenient!  The kitchen had everything we needed and the bed was very comfortable.  We visit my brother in Ballard about once a year and look forward to staying here again!"
254340,1625657,2012-07-03,2749057,Cathy,I highly recommend this Elegant Oasis!  Kim and Stewart were lovely hosts and made me feel right at home.  Their place exceeded my expectations.  The location was perfect for visiting my daughter and being close to public transportation.  I appreciated the beautiful accommodations including a complete kitchen. I would definitely stay there again.
254340,1667584,2012-07-09,891299,Isabel,This is a beautiful apartment (even better than the photos) with a really peaceful feel.  It was a very functional and luxurious home base to spend an evening in or to explore Seattle.  I only wish we had planned to stay longer.
254340,1724089,2012-07-16,520751,Jaspal,"Kim & Stewart were wonderful hosts. They were very accommodating of my family, even providing a pack+play for our infant. They were friendly and offered up plenty of area recommendations. The place itself looks great in the photos, but was even better on arrival. It was an easy commute (driving) to Lower Queen Anne, where I needed to be for work. And we enjoyed walking down 65th to the local businesses for coffee, food, and funny socks. This is where we plan to stay on return trips to Seattle!"
254340,2008904,2012-08-17,2410643,Anne,"Kim and Stewart were great. We did not just stay in their wonderful basement apartment, we became friends and hope to stay with them again. My daughter and I live overseas and return to Seattle every summer. This was the first time we had our own space very close to our family and friends. Kim was away for most of our trip but Stewart was home and helped us with everything we needed. The space is cool and cozy - good internet, comfortable bed, excellent washer and dryer, good water temperature and pressure in the bathroom, well appointed kitchen and the companionship of a very sweet dog. The location was perfect for us, close to Ballard restaurants, library, post office and beaches and easy access to downtown, University district and shopping at Northgate Mall. Excellent restaurants, groceries and bakeries within walking distance. Kim and Stewart's was the perfect place for us. Our last night in town Kim, my daughter and I went out for a night at the Seattle waterfront. In the morning  before our flight home, Kim and I went  for pastries. It was a perfect ending to a wonderful stay."
254340,2133446,2012-08-29,2560993,Catherine,"I really enjoyed my stay in Kim and Stewart's apartment. It was very clean, well appointed and comfortable. I've traveled extensively all over the world and the Elegant Oasis is one of the most comfortable places I've ever stayed. It's close to the very vibrant communities of Ballard and Phinney Ridge and it was an easy walk to both the Green Lake walking path and the Woodland Park Zoo. I barely left the area the entire time week because there is so much to do right there. "
254340,2462307,2012-10-01,2544862,Erica,"The 'oasis' is fabulous - everything you would ever need is in the apartment and it is cozy and comfortable and in a great, quiet neighborhood within walking distance to coffee shops and restaurants.  My husband and I so enjoyed our stay and the hosts were so accommodating and helpful in sharing information on places to go to, etc.  We will definitely come back and have already recommended the 'oasis' to friends who frequently travel to Seattle..  Thanks for making our stay so pleasant!!"
254340,2698166,2012-10-24,2450608,Janet,"In town for a conference, two of us stayed at Kim and Stewart's. It was perfect! Spotless, private, warm, with everything we needed and more. I was especially impressed with the thoughtful little touches Kim and Stewart included (like pastries for the morning since we got in late!)."
254340,2926984,2012-11-20,212970,Kitty,"Kim and Stewart are so kind and welcoming.  We knew that whatever we needed they were there to help, but we also had all the privacy we needed.  Very comfortable accommodations with a well appointed kitchen.  So nice to have cable and wifi.  A washer and dryer, plus detergent is so appreciated.  Tons of space to unpack and put your clothes.  It was our second stay there and it was all we needed.
"
254340,3333746,2013-01-12,2293563,Paul And Brenda,We arranged this stay for a colleague who was in town. Kim and Stewart were very helpful and quick to reply with answers to any questions we had. Our colleague had a great stayed and really appreciated the hospitality provided. We highly recommend this apt to anyone looking for a place to stay in a great Seattle neighborhood! 
254340,3452052,2013-02-01,4391384,Dean,"Kim & Stewart's apartment is as advertised.  Very clean, comfortable, cozty even during all the cold rainy days of our Seattle stay.  Great kitchen, excellent bed.  Wif-fi worked great.  Very good privacy, but  Kim & Stewart always available if you need something.  Had to go outside to get good cell phone coverage, but that could have been due to our cell carrier (we are from Anchorage, AK)."
254340,3582437,2013-02-19,4674596,Lynn,Kim has a wonderful very priviate basement apt for stays in the Ballard area.  It was spotless and had everything you could possible need.  We will stay here again when we visit my sister.  Perfect!!!!!
254340,3682251,2013-03-04,594768,Anne,"Warm apartment greeted me, even though hosts were away.  Everything was as pictured, with a few extra pillows and shelf space.  When I wanted something, I found it already there, almost every time.  Kim and Stewart were friendly and available, but let me come and go as I wished.  This is the nicest finished basement apt I have stayed in!  Felt like my own place.  Recommended.  Will stay here again."
254340,3764552,2013-03-12,5062878,Margaret,"We had everything we needed in comfortable, charming, reasonably priced surroundings. "
254340,4025042,2013-04-03,489267,Rachel,"We stayed with Kim for 9 nights during our move from Seattle back to Australia.  The apartment was great, extremely clean and comfortable with everything provided you could possibly need - down to spices and herbs for cooking!  The location is great, with easy access to buses or zipcars.  I highly recommend this as a place to stay, whether you are coming to Seattle to visit friends or family or just to sight see."
254340,4077254,2013-04-08,5237022,Traci,Lovely place!  Very clean and accommodating.  
254340,4283363,2013-04-24,2312284,Ben,"My wife, daughter, and I had a great stay! The apartment was contemporary and clean, and the location was perfect. Also amazing was Kim's offer ahead of time to set up a Pack n' Play for us, so we didn't have to lug ours across the country. We'll definitely stay here again during our next trip to Seattle!"
254340,4396044,2013-05-02,5878631,Denise,Tell others in the Airbnb community about your stay.
254340,4828029,2013-05-28,5132802,Andrew,"We now have absolutely no reason to stay anywhere else when we visit Seattle but in Kim and Stewart's Elegant Oasis. The apartment is exactly as pictured: Quirky but comfortable, with everything you might need for a couple nights or a couple weeks. The kitchen is big and thoughtfully stocked, the bathroom is small but functional (with a heated floor!), and everything was spotlessly clean, organized, and ready for our stay. There's plenty of storage for clothes and travel items, including supplied hangers.

Our trip was a bit of a whirlwind—we needed to stay somewhere in the neighborhood due to a series of family events over a holiday weekend, and Kim's house would've been perfect on location alone (it's in a good spot to get to almost anywhere in the city quickly by car, yet you're tucked into a very quiet, safe neighborhood). There's plenty of nearby restaurants and shops.

Sadly, due to all the activities we had planned, we never had a chance to meet our hosts face-to-face, but Kim checked in with us via e-mail to make sure we had everything we needed, and was proactive, professional, and welcoming in all of her messages. She even made sure we could arrive early without any problems. We heard them upstairs a couple times, but the apartment is very well insulated and noise from anywhere is certainly not a problem.

A few quirks and notes that may or may not matter to some of you:

1. The cocoon-like double bed is very warm and comfortable, but it has a pillow-top or some sort of cushion over the mattress, so it's quite soft. We loved it, but if you need a firm sleep surface, it may not be for you.

2. We had a rental car and found street parking at the house and getting around the city very easy. As such, I can't comment on how access to public transit is from this location. The streets in this neighborhood are narrow and generally parked-in on both sides; if your rental car is a giant SUV or something, it may be a challenge getting in and out.

3. Because it's a basement apartment, the ceiling is low in a couple places. I'm six foot and had to duck in one spot in particular, but otherwise was fine.

We absolutely recommend Kim's apartment, and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Book with confidence!"
254340,4986915,2013-06-05,6119201,Andrea,"My husband, 1 1/2 year old daughter and I loved our stay with KIm & Stewart! The apartment was just lovely, with great amenities, such as the kitchen, laundry and modern touches. We loved the storage available for our clothing and luggage, as well as the heated floors in the bathroom. It is in a great location, with wonderful shops, restaurants, and coffee shops within walking distance. We loved Bluebird, who served their own ice cream & coffee. The apartment is also a very easy drive downtown - we were to the space needle, waterfront, etc within 10 minutes. We would definitely stay again and recommend it to others, especially those with a little one. 

Kim and Stewart were wonderful hosts. We were greeted with pastries from their favorite local bakery. Kim was happy to provide an iron and iron board. Both Kim and Stewart have a wealth of knowledge on things to do, places to eat, etc in the area and in Seattle as well, which we were thankful for. 

The only thing I was unaware of is the fact that this is more of a studio apartment, as the bedroom is not enclosed, and is open without a door/curtain from one side of the bedroom near the bathroom entrance. I was a little concerned, as we put our daughter to bed at 7:30, that we would wake her up with noise, lights, etc. But in the end, she slept wonderfully and it didn't matter at all! 

Thanks again Kim & Stewart! We will always look back on our trip with such fond memories, and would love an opportunity to stay again. "
254340,5053487,2013-06-10,5924135,'Brielle,"We enjoyed our stay very much. The apartment was very clean and comfortable. Kim and Stewart were so accommodating. When we arrived we were pleasantly surprised that the apartment was completed baby proofed, which meant a lot to us since we have two very active young children. And it is set up in a way that noise is not an issue. We were relieved about that since we are early risers and we didn't want to disturb anyone around us. Also, we were welcomed with a pack of cupcakes. Just what we needed after a long car ride to Seattle. A very nice touch indeed!"
254340,5306636,2013-06-24,4120288,Paul,"We very much enjoyed our stay at Elegant Oasis in Seattle.  While we never met Kim or Stewart in person, our e-mail and phone conversations were very helpful.  Kim sent me a list of places to eat near by.  There is a really good coffee place just around the corner.  Also make sure you make your way up to Honore Bakery on 70th Street @ 15th Ave.  Thanks Kim for the yummy treat from there. 

The only feedback that I would have for future Airbnb folks would be that you really do need a car in this location, street parking is no problem, and to watch your feet as you walk around the bed, there is a wooden frame that is wider than the bed itself and we both stubbed our toes.   Also make sure you pet their dog he is very friendly "
254340,5451140,2013-07-01,5887363,Karen,"Fantastic choice!!! Super clean, large, private, attention to detail (2 delicious scones waiting for us), very comfortable bed, and very well supplied kitchen. Filtered water and coffee provided. Great quiet neighborhood that's conveniently located. I needed an iron and ironing board which Stewart was quick to provide. Kim was out of town but Stewart was personable, helpful, and available. We will definitely stay here again when in Seattle. Thanks for such a great stay! Karen & Roger, Tennessee "
254340,6144925,2013-08-01,1400390,June,Kim and Stewart are wonderful hosts; we've stayed in their place twice now and we will plan on doing so again the next time we are in Seattle.
254340,6555791,2013-08-17,2560993,Catherine,This was the second time I stayed with Kim and Stewart who were as gracious and welcoming during this visit as they were last year. Their apartment is very clean and inviting to be in which is a huge priority for me. Their apartment is in a good location within walking distance to all the restaurants and amenities of the Phinney Ridge neighborhood and the 3 mile walk around bustling Green Lake. It is also a very short car ride or longer walk to the bars and restaurants of lively old Ballard. Excellent coffee is only 1 block away at Cafe Bambino which is open at 6 am during week days - a great find for those experiencing jet lag! Or Kim and Stewart thoughtfully provided fresh ground coffee if you are more of a do it yourself guest. I will definitely stay with Kim and Stewart again during next year's trip back home to visit with family. 
254340,6844554,2013-08-27,6413763,Francine,Our stay at Kim and Stewart's place was a great first experience with Airbnb.  Kim went out of her way to accommodate our wanting to have a nice cup of tea when we arrived in Seattle. The place was wonderfully appointed with everything that we needed for our stay to be comfortable including a washer and dryer.  Both she and her husband were wonderful hosts - sharing their knowledge of Seattle and the area to ensure that we would find things to do that were fun for us. They could not have been nicer to stay with.
254340,7092741,2013-09-06,5195750,David,"We loved Kim's place!   It is very cozy and comfortable.   The pictures hardly do it justice, since they don't show the attention to architectural detail lavished on the renovation of this basement space.   I'm six feet tall, but didn't come in contact with the ceiling that is sub-six-foot in a few places.   And even if I had, I'm sure the smoothly rounded edges would have only given a gentle bump.   The delicious pastry awaiting us on our arrival was typical of the elegance of Kim and Stuart's welcome to their guests.  The Phinney Ridge neighborhood is charming with some good nearby bars and coffee houses, as well as a wide choice up the hill along Phinney & Greenwood Aves.   They recommend the Honore Artisan Bakery, which is excellent and known across Seattle.   We enjoyed downtown Ballard, which is easy to get to by bus or rental car (or via an ""urban hike"").   We will definitely try to stay here again on our next trip to Seattle.  "
254340,7278496,2013-09-14,8037175,Alexi,"Kim and Stuart were absolutely fabulous hosts from the moment we arrived. My husband, 8 month old daughter and I felt completely comfortable and safe during our stay. Great quiet neighborhood!

We were checked in via email prior to arrival. As other reviewers noted they had fresh pastries waiting for us from Fresh Flours that were scrumptious, I was barely willing to share the pear pastry with my husband. 

Stuart happened to be home when we arrived. He was very sweet and offered the use of a highchair/ booster seat that could be strapped onto a dining chair. This was such a life saver since it was the one home item I hadn't planned for (I'm a very organized planner) and certainly simplified feeding my daughter. They had also offered to have a pack and play ready for us which we didn't need since our hotel stay the previous weekend required us to travel with our own crib. 

Although the space is not grand in size it provides everything you could possibly need. Every time I thought of something I turned around and there it was. Even the lotion in the bathroom was paraben free! The space is incredibly well laid out and efficient. There is plenty of storage space if you want to unpack and feel at home, which we used, and there is literally a hook everywhere you think it would be nice to have one.

I will say that the height clearance is a bit tight as you would expect in a basement space. My husband is 6'2"" and bonked his head a could of times in the same place. The bedroom space is actually raised a couple inches and the ceiling is also lower in the walkway from the bedroom to the bathroom so just beware or avoid this area if you're tall. As other reviewers noted watch out for the bed since the base is a bit wider than the bed itself. I was conscious of it and still managed to stub my toes more than a few times. 

There is parking available but I think you'd need a truck or SUV to clear the lip just because of the grades between the street, the sidewalk and the driveway. We had a rented Nissan Ultima and unless we wanted to rip off the undercarriage it wasn't going to happen. Street parking was no problem for us and we were able to find space out front.

There are a bunch places within a couple of blocks to grab a bite or a latte. Bambino cafe was awesome (reeeeeealy good coffee), we also enjoyed Ridgeback cafe (beware the crepes are delicious but huge) and The Dray (nice drafts, good sammiches and decent sports bar- check it out if you're a soccer fan). Oh and if you're craving desert take a trip up to Phinney Ave and grab a slice of pie from Pies A La Mode, the sour cherry with Bluebird Creamery ice cream was ahhh-mazing."
254340,7488188,2013-09-22,8361407,Michelle,"A wonderful stay for us and our two month old. Kim and Stuart set up a pack and play for us. Lots of space and the kitchen was well stocked. 
The apartment is convenient to buses to get downtown, and there's food and coffee close by!  
Phinney Oasis is a great place to stay. "
254340,8624529,2013-11-09,3401076,David,Great spot with all the amenities. 
254340,8994976,2013-12-01,9089188,Betsy,"KIm's place in Phinney is perfect for us.  My daughter just lives a few blocks away in Ballard.  The chocolate & raspberry croissants Kim left for us were so delicious and a great welcoming touch!  Everything was comfortable,plenty of room for us and and a well stocked kitchen!  The apt is extremely clean and well-appointed!  The heated floor in the bathroom is the very best!!!!!  
It is close to my very favorite coffe shop that ships coffee to me all the way to Boston...Herkimer on Phinney Ave!  That is a real plus!  Just sorry we did not get to meet Kim and her pooch!!  Hopefully we will when we return in April!  "
254340,9821634,2014-01-12,10869488,Cynthia,Kim's place was warm and welcoming.  The bed was fabulously comfortable and all other amenities were lovely.  I look forward to returning!
254340,9973626,2014-01-22,9927889,Terri,"Our stay in Seattle was made perfect by our hosts. The apartment was exactly what we needed. It was clean, comfortable, and beautiful. We will definitely return. "
254340,10435713,2014-02-18,748769,Joe,"Great location, apartment was roomy, clean and well furnished.  Pastries on arrival were appreciated.  Would definitely stay here again!"
254340,12094784,2014-04-22,5244354,Tarn,"Kim and Stewart were incredible hosts.  We made an error on our end in terms of payment, and they went way out of their way to help correct it. 

The Oasis is truly that--it is a wonderful place in a great neighborhood.

Kim and Stewart left breakfast pastries and coffee for the first morning, which was a very welcome gesture.

I highly recommend the Phinney Oasis!  Thanks again, Kim and Stewart."
254340,12295528,2014-04-28,9012427,Meg,"The Phinney Oasis is lovely. Well appointed and  centrally located, it was the perfect place for us to stay during our business trip to Seattle. "
254340,13011078,2014-05-17,12272483,Amy,This little apartment was so perfect! Very comfortable and roomy. The hosts were very hospitable. The neighborhood was perfect for someone without a vehicle.
254340,13320340,2014-05-25,14954417,Suellen,"such a great place! quiet and wonderful neighborhood, so many amazing gardens around. it was a pleasure just to walk around the area and stop here and there to taste all the delicious food you can find within walking distance from the house. the place was clean, comfortable, new and kim was very helpful and kind. thanks again, kim! it was a really nice stay!"
254340,13863588,2014-06-06,2479220,Kevin,"The suite was everything I needed for my stay, and the location was great for access to my work and interesting restaurants. "
254340,14124455,2014-06-12,15442480,Kate,"My boyfriend and I were in town for a UW graduation and stayed at Phinney Oasis for about five nights. We loved it! Kim and Stewart were very gracious hosts and ensured our (very) late check-in was convenient and comfortable. We were also greeted by delicious pastries! The amenities in the apartment exceeded our expectations - we had to work from Seattle during the week and found it very convenient and enjoyable to work from there. If we return to Seattle, we will definitely check back with Phinney Oasis. It was my first Airbnb experience and now I am spoiled!"
254340,14390095,2014-06-18,1400390,June,"I have stayed here several times and each time has been great. The place is clean, quiet, comfortable, and convenient to what I need to get done while in Seattle.

I'd be staying there again later on this summer's trip, but they were booked up for the time I wanted in July. So sad."
254340,14742142,2014-06-25,1488373,Darrin,"Great neighborhood! with ample, easy parking for a good-sized family van loaded with vacation gear. Attention to detail in the apartment made our stay pleasant. Highly recommended. Thank you Kim and Stewart!"
254340,15211459,2014-07-05,827218,Peggy,Kim and Stuart were great hosts. The neighborhood is nice and quiet. The oasis offers a fine place for a good night's sleep :)
254340,15596416,2014-07-12,2479220,Kevin,"This was my second trip to Kim`s home, and I enjoyed it as much as the first, particularly enjoying the cool space during a hot Seattle spell.  Location worked really well for access to my office, and I was able to try out some of the recommended food choices.  Thank you Kim!"
254340,15875084,2014-07-17,12120039,Trish,"Everything was exactly as described. The apartment was clean and well-organized.  The location was perfect! Explored ""stumbletown"" as well as golden gardens and the locks. Trudged up the hill to the zoo and Phinney Ridge on what may have been the hottest day this year...coming home to the cool of the basement was better than I had expected. Comfortable bed, ez parking. No worries all around. "
254340,16856332,2014-08-03,18121229,Ben,"Kim has a very nice house in a quiet but convenient location, about 3 blocks from a bus which took us downtown in about 20 minutes. The flat is very spacious and modern, and the bed was very comfortable. Kim made us feel very welcome and we had a great time in Seattle!

Next time I'm in Seattle the Oasis is high on my list!"
254340,21014777,2014-10-09,17691416,Sarah,"It is really reassuring to enter a rental and see healthy cleaning products. I have bad allergies and sensitivities and the Phinney Oasis was such a delight. Stewart was wonderful and extremely accommodating to my situation -- he checked in to make sure everything was OK and invited me to sit on their back patio with their lovely dog (which I did every day while the sun lasted). The rental was private, clean, cozy and safe -- and in a great neighborhood. In the mornings, I could hear the hosts walking above briefly, but otherwise the rental was quiet and peaceful. Highly recommended!"
254340,21940845,2014-10-27,18682467,Katherine,Had a fabulous time at the Phinney Oasis! We were greeted with pastries which were amazing. The place was clean and had everything listed on the description. The location was amazing... walking distance from restaurants and shops. 15 minute drive to downtown Seattle! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Great value! 
254340,22552567,2014-11-09,2479220,Kevin,I enjoyed my third time in the Phinney Oasis.  The facilities and location were perfect for my work.  Thank you Kim.
254340,24930680,2015-01-04,18917483,Katja,"It was a great week there ! We had a lot of fun. The apartment was really good. 
Thank you !  "
254340,26078079,2015-02-02,18174832,Irene,"We really enjoyed our stay at Kim's and Stewart's and we would thoroughly recommend their tastefully remodeled basement to anyone looking for temporary accommodation in Seattle. 

The place was exactly as described (if not better than expected). Besides, the peace and quiet of the neighborhood and the privacy provided by the hosts were much appreciated during the two stressful weeks we stayed there while on trial.

Also worth mentioning is the fact that communication with the hosts was excellent. We encountered a minor payment issue that took a minute to solve, but they were understanding, patient, and helpful toward its resolution.

In short: Five-star hosts. "
254340,26614704,2015-02-16,4177888,Mariana,"Our experience at Kim's was excellent! Everything is just as described in their listing. They immediately responded to our questions, Kim's husband was friendly and spent time explaining us how to go to places. I recommended without hesitation! Way to go guys! You were just superb!!"
254340,27267983,2015-03-01,10331180,Stephanie,"The Phinney Oasis is a wonderful place to stay. Kim and Stewart were excellent hosts.  The apartment is clean, the kitchen is well stocked, and the bed is so comfortable! "
254340,28566810,2015-03-26,4391384,Dean,"
This is our second visit with Kim; outstanding accomodations is a great part of town; very friendly, as usual; can't go wrong here!
The ""welcome"" pastries are special and a unique touch you won't get elsewhere!"
254340,29504121,2015-04-08,21649388,Diane,We enjoyed staying in Kim's delightful apartment. The neighbourhood is quiet and there are convenience stores and restaurants within easy walking distance. The location was ideal for exploring Seattle and the accommodations were comfortable and fully equipped. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit.
254340,30840412,2015-04-27,7111746,Bart,Our stay was perfect! The neighborhood is really nice and the Oasis was super comfortable for two of us!!   The fresh scones were a pleasant surprise too.
254340,31592143,2015-05-07,270117,Richard,"Kim asked that we give her an approximate arrival time.  We were just unlocking the door when Stewart rode up on his bike.  He gave us some great restaurant reviews, most within walking distance.  I felt he and Kim were happy to have us and also happy to share their local knowledge.  The house is in a great neighborhood, many bars and restaurants nearby representing a range of price levels.  A short drive takes you to the Ballard area with more dining choices, interesting small shops and a working waterfront.  The apartment was great for us.  I was pleasantly surprised by the size (it is quite spacious) and by the heated bathroom floor! Glad they mentioned the low ceilings on the listing page."
254340,32184026,2015-05-15,6510832,Amy,"Wonderful place, excellent location, awesome hosts. The #28 bus line was close by and easy to use, neighborhood cafes, restaurants, and Goodwill were great. We definitely recommend Kim's Phinney Oasis and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
254340,33496231,2015-05-29,26923423,Alexandra Lucia,Everything worked out great. I booked the apartment for my parents who were visiting me here in Seattle.  We got the code for the key box and arrived in a very clean and beautiful apartment. (The little welcome-pastry on the table was really nice). Btw my mom was in love with the modern washing machine ;)
254340,34794623,2015-06-12,11699700,Julian,Kim and Stuart were fantastic hosts. My family require a place to live as we waited to move into our new home; so we were looking for something comfortable. Kim and Stewart provided exactly this. One tiny internet problem was corrected in 5 mins! Fantastic. I highly recommend this Oasis in Phinney.  You won't be disappointed. 
254340,35310172,2015-06-17,11701227,Suzanne,Kim was a wonderful host!  She was an excellent communicator with emails and was extremely helpful in helping me reserve these dates.  She was kind enough to have two delicious pastries waiting for us upon our arrival.   She has a lovely apartment that was just perfect for our needs.  We were there to move our son's belongings into storage after completing another year at UW.  The apartment is conveniently situated about 10-15min from UW.   It is in a wonderful neighborhood.  We were within walking distance to a couple of nice coffee places and restaurants. We enjoyed pizza at the Ridge and we were able to watch the NBA finals and enjoy good food at the Park Public House. The apartment also has a very nice TV.  Kim was a very gracious host in accommodating our son who had to spend one night with us. We would definitely stay there again and highly recommend the Phinney Oasis. 
254340,36006985,2015-06-24,4841499,Nancy,"Kim's apartment was perfect for our recent trip to Seattle.  It had all of the amenities we needed: full kitchen, living and eating areas, incredibly comfortable bed and as a bonus - a washer and dryer.  It was well located for my walks around Green Lake with my daughter and easy to access downtown and the other site we visited.  It was spotlessly clean and quiet - I would definitely recommend it."
254340,36667956,2015-06-30,5408220,Jason,"The Oasis proved to be an excellent place to stay on our trip to Seattle. The unit was well-appointed, spotless upon arrival and comfortable throughout. The neighborhood is also, I think, perfectly located for those who want to explore the neighborhoods north of Lake Union. And on top of that, Kim and Stewart were such wonderfully pleasant hosts. If you're traveling to Seattle and the Phinney Oasis is available, your choice of where to stay should definitely be an easy one."
254340,38133476,2015-07-13,10909068,Rita,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and nice and cool during the extremely hot weather.  Kim and Stewart are friendly and helpful."
254340,41626832,2015-08-08,1626891,Rebekah,"It was perfect! Great location and comfortable, spacious accommodations. 
They had tons of cooking utensils and supplies, which made it great for cooking meals at home. 
We will definitely stay here again!"
254340,43621426,2015-08-21,34949007,David,"Your place was the perfect place for us to stay for the week we were in Seattle. We came and went from your neighborhood with ease any time of the day or evening whether we were there for a nap or for a night's rest. The entire apartment was fully appointed for comfort and convenience. We especially appreciated the nice touches of a heated (on a timer) bathroom floor while we were there, and a ceramic panel in the living area that provided us with radiant and convective heat for our early morning activities. We intend to recommend your place highly to any of our friends or acquaintances planning a trip to Seattle. Your B&B was the first AirB&B we've tried, and we've come away with a very favorable impression of both your place and the whole system. Many thanks!"
254340,44300428,2015-08-25,6512495,Adelene,"The place was everything n more than what they describe to be! It was homely, cosy and within walking distance to almost everything! Will stay here again if I visit!"
254340,45111235,2015-08-31,38607491,Pat,Phinney Oasis is exactly as as advertised and more. It is welcoming and feels very much like home. Many of Kim and Stewart's recommendations are within walking distance and are definitely worth checking out. Additionally a few bus stops are quite close and make travel to other neighborhoods a breeze. We would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laid back location when staying in the Seattle area.
254340,46146286,2015-09-08,38976775,Emily,Kim and Stewart were great hosts. The apartment was very clean and they had pastries waiting for us when we arrived which was very thoughtful. There was a lot of parking and we were within walking distance to a ton of great restaurants and bars. 
254340,47053685,2015-09-15,13205223,Emily,"Another great stay here - my mom has stayed here twice now when visiting me in Seattle, and it's worked out well for us. The apartment is spacious, fully stocked with cooking supplies, and a comfortable bed.  The owners always take care to leave a little treat for her upon her arrival, and they have designed and decorated the apartment to be very cozy and homey.  The neighborhood has great access to coffee shops, restaurants, and more.  The only downside would be that b/c you are below the home, you can hear footsteps/noise from above when the owners are home. Not a major disturbance. Definitely an excellent spot to stay!"
254340,48014607,2015-09-22,43006231,Brian,Great place to stay- clean and convenient. 
254340,48741268,2015-09-28,42069626,Chelsea,Kim was really easy to get in contact with from the beginning and it stayed that way throughout my in-law's stay. We chose this spot because it's close to our place in Ballard and it was convenient for us. 
254340,50321397,2015-10-11,16051986,Anna,"Oasis is an accurate description for this gem in Phinney Ridge. The apartment is quiet and clean with everything one could need, including washer and dryer, hairdryer, shampoo, washing powder, olive oil, spices, etc.. The bed is comfortable and there are plenty of extra blankets. The hosts are warm and welcoming, but are very respectful of one's privacy. They live above the apartment, so are easily accessible. A parking space was always available in front of the house. The pear tart and cookies on the table when I arrived were an especially thoughtful touch.  All in all, I could not have asked for a better experience. "
254340,51473504,2015-10-20,27837469,Peter,"A great experience all around. The place was centrally located, and within 15 minutes of nearly everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Lots of walkable things in the neighborhood, plenty of street parking too. The unit itself was perfect for what we needed (in addition to a bedroom, a living room and kitchen area are also in the unit). The ceilings are a little low (I'm 6'3"") but not a deal breaker at all. Kim and Stewart made us feel right at home with great restaurant suggestions as well. 10/10!"
254340,53697335,2015-11-11,45211191,Michael,"This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have asked for better. Kim & Stewart's place in Phinney Ridge is clean, quiet, cozy, and extremely convenient to everywhere & everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Great location, with easy access to several bus lines & quick Uber/Lyft pickups. The place itself is fantastic and the communication with Kim & Stewart was excellent both before and during our stay. Our only regret is that our schedule was so hectic while in town that we never got to say hello or to thank them in person! Would absolutely stay again -- assuming it's not booked, of course!"
6289789,55471418,2015-12-01,1419105,Itay,"My parents stayed here for 9 days when they were visiting us over Thanksgiving, and they had a great time. The apartment was very convenient and well furnished, and there were instructions for how to get everything working. 

Autumn, the property manager, was also very responsive and helpful."

1594328,7859884,2013-10-06,2230351,Andrew,"Lucinda was great and her house is beautiful. She will engage you if you want or leave you alone if you prefer. The room is really nice and comfortable and, if you care (I do) the Wifi is very good. "
1594328,8103525,2013-10-15,5229556,Jennifer,Loved Lucinda's place!  Close to the cool areas of Fremont and Wallingford which are full of cute cafes and shops.  The house itself is spacious and spotlessly clean and the kitchen is fully equipped.  Lots of free parking.  Lucinda was quick with correspondence and entry to the house was super easy.  Will stay here again when we return to the area.
1594328,8394761,2013-10-28,8168348,Julio,"Our stay at Lucinda's place was great!  The bed was very comfortable, the house very lovely, and it was fun to browse through and listen to the vinyls (was so excited ""Under the Bushes, Under the Stars"" was in her collection).  The bus stop is right across the street, and just up the road on 45th, there's a sock shop, which is dope.  My girlfriend was in from out of town, and we couldn't have asked for a better place:)  We would definitely stay here again."
1594328,43513173,2015-08-20,27873178,Angela,"The house was very cute and conveniently located in a beautiful Wallingford neighborhood. There was a fireplace, coffee, wine, and some food in the fridge we were welcome to. The beds were very comfortable. Lucinda also had a large selection of records which was a nice touch. "
1594328,43961367,2015-08-23,37331324,Mark,Great funky home with lots of personal character and easy access to Seattle attractions.  Our kids loved visiting the nearby Fremont Bridge Troll and exploring Wallingford and Fremont.  Lucinda was eminently reachable and a great host.
1594328,45267534,2015-09-01,1671746,Evan,"We had a wonderful long weekend at Lucinda's house. It is very artfully decorated, yet comfortable and homey. We appreciated that the house was well equipped for cooking. I highly recommend this house for a small group looking to enjoy Wallingford Fremont and Ballard. "
1594328,54200764,2015-11-16,6925160,Asa,"Wow. 

Lucinda is a fantastic host - prompt communication, excellent instructions & (email hidden)t to mention an incredibly sweet person. 

We loved our stay. Its in a great spot, close to everything, but still has a nice, quiet neighborhood feel. The home is exactly as described, if not better. 

Its got a very welcoming vibe, and we put on some of her records (she's got a fantastic collection) to help with the mood of a rainy weekend. Also the beds are super comfy, you'll sleep great. Comfortably slept 4 folks. 

If I were to offer one thing to be aware of - this is an older home. Plugs and switches are in random spots sometimes, so make sure to test what turns what. This was a non-issue for us. 

Absolutely a 5 star host, a 5 star home, and a 5 star experience. Would gladly stay again. "
1594328,57661957,2015-12-28,15491630,Janis,"Our stay in the cozy 1920's Wallingford home was perfect. The house served us very well and the location could not have been better.
"
2387605,19577835,2014-09-14,21174224,Richard,"Kazami and his wife were so welcoming. The home was very clean, bed was comfortable, bathroom was big and they even set up an extra bed next to my bed for my friend to sleep. From the airport we were able to take the Link, the local rail system, within walking distance of their home. The walking part will of course only work if the weather was as nice as it was for us. My friend and I were in town for a baseball game so we were able to drop off our bags and take a short bus ride downtown Seattle. On check out day, they allowed us to leave or bags at the home until we had to go to airport so that we didn't need to carry them around all day. They were even nice enough to give us a ride to the rail station when we were running a bit late to catch our flight. Thanks for being part of our the great Seattle experience.  "
2387605,19911557,2014-09-20,17427922,Mohsen,"Kazami and his wife Mitsuko were so welcoming and helpful!  Kazami responds very quickly and was accommodating to my changing needs.  Even though I gave less than 24 hours notice, Kazami was able to make everything ready in time.  Not only that, but he picked me up from the light rail station and emailed me lots of useful links and maps.  The house is beautiful and impeccably clean.  The bed was very comfortable and I slept like a rock every night.  The room has a large private bathroom and Kazami provided towels, shampoo and body wash.  There's even a separate room to do yoga, if you want.  I can't emphasize enough how friendly and kind Kazami and his wife Mitsuko are.  I enjoyed hanging out with them and hearing all their stories.  I also felt like I had enough privacy in my room, when I needed it.  The house is just a short walk to the #7 bus that goes to downtown and the #9 bus that goes towards broadway.  

This trip felt more like visiting friends than booking a room.  I look forward to seeing them again and highly recommend them to anyone!"
2387605,19996669,2014-09-21,15244927,John,"Kazami and Mitsuko were FANTASTIC hosts. They where accommaditing and very flexable. There place was very organized and comfortable. 

 "
2387605,20403654,2014-09-28,15943873,John,"My stay at Kazami's was simply wunderbar. Not only did they pick me up from the rail station, anticipate my questions complete with a custom Google map, but have an effortless style (music included).

Kazami and his wife seemed eager to make sure I made the most out of my short stay. 

The room looked quite meticulously prepared down to the spread of the latest Wallpaper magazines, to the immaculate private bathroom. 

The bed was comfy and easy to sleep in. Once I awoke, I came down for some tea and we lazily chatted and they offered again to give me a ride. 

This is what I imagine what the team at airbnb had in mind- great people sharing moments in their home. "
2387605,20594144,2014-10-01,10454727,Abdelhalim,"I had a very positive experience staying at Mr Kazami room, the furniture was nice and simple. The hospitality of Me. Kazami needs bigger space to be described fully 

Highly recommended."
2387605,21187853,2014-10-12,21842525,Liz,"Our stay at Kazami's was perfect.  He and his wife were very welcoming and respectful of our privacy.  The room with private en suite were very clean and are well represented in the pictures. Towels and toiletries were provided.  Pictures represent what you get very well! I was a little worried about the sofa, but it ended up being very comfortable!  A little tight for two, as expected of its size,  especially if your partner is a bed hogger like mine, but perfect for one.  Nice and quiet. Great location if you're going to Century Link arena,  less than 10 min drive.  We ended up using our vehicle but the bus route is conveniently located only about 2 short blocks away. No issues with parking on the street. 
As for communication, I found Kazami to be prompt to respond and helpful.

I would definitely stay here again and recommend this place to anyone!"
2387605,21763693,2014-10-23,12501712,Stephanie,"Kazami was a great host with a beautiful home! We felt very welcome in their place, which was in a great location (International District/ Chinatown). Check-in/out was a breeze and we never had to ask for something... Kazami and his wife anticipate their guests needs very well! "
2387605,22077483,2014-10-29,3271737,Jonathan,"We were only at Kazamis for one night, but they were gracious hosts, very clean room and private bathroom and my wife and I enjoyed a lovely conversation with them about all their travelling adventures. He also provided map and directiona to local stores, cafes and parks for our brief stay. Would definitely recommend"
2387605,22677685,2014-11-11,8063867,Michael,What a wonderful host and really lovely space. The location is excellent (easy to get to town on the buses about 2 blocks away) and the actual space is fantastic. I love clean and simple space and both the living area and the bedroom are perfect in my eyes. I couldn't recommend more highly.
2387605,22878127,2014-11-16,23727630,Al,"Great place. Easy to get to. Nice and quiet. Room is clean with good light. Kazami had extra heater just in case it was needed. Would return if back in Seattle. Quick responses and accomadating. 
You can find car2gos in the area."
2387605,23996236,2014-12-16,23232661,Carlos,This was my first time using airbnb and i couldn't have asked for better hosts! Kazami and Mitsuko are seasoned travelers and it was fun to share stories! The house is super clean - way better than any hotel and the sheets were so luxurious! The house is well located walking distance (1 block) from #7 bus and easy to get to the train (King station). I really enjoyed my stay!  11/10 stars.  
2387605,24200617,2014-12-22,23782035,Geonyoung,"It was great pleasure to meet Mr. And Mrs. Kazami and it abundant my trip in Seattle.

I spent good time in there and hope to visit again."
2387605,24880311,2015-01-03,21777372,Hubert,Kazami was prompt in contact before and accepting the request. His home was fantastic- as described in the pictures and comments. Kazami and his wife were very polite and accommodating. I can't think of anything they could have done better. I wouldn't hesitate to stay with him again and would most definitely like to. 
2387605,26663957,2015-02-16,6417615,Mimi,"Kazumi and Mitsuko are very welcoming and accommodating hosts! It was my first time in Seattle and they made many great suggestions and even offered to drive me to the tram a few times. They definitely made my friend and I feel very comfortable. Thank you!

The listing is just as pictured. It is a spacious room and bathroom on the fourth floor of their house. Expect to walk up several flights of stairs! It is super close the the 7 bus line, which goes straight into downtown. The listing is also fairly close to the tram, which goes straight to the airport!

I would definitely stay here again."
2387605,27678661,2015-03-09,15854785,Mitchell,"Kazami and Mitsuko are extremely welcoming and inviting. My wife and I had never visited Seattle before and they were the perfect host for our first stay in the city. 

Their home is as pictured and described and it's placed is in an excellent neighborhood just around the corner of the number 7 bus stop. 

If you're visiting Seattle, Kazami and Mitsuko are great host and will go out of their way to insure you have an awesome stay in Seattle!"
2387605,28293968,2015-03-21,25201909,Tamsin,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been more positive. A friend and I stayed with Kazami and his wife for just one night, they were extremely friendly and helpful. Kazami even went out of his way to pick us up from the nearest train station and dropped us to our ferry in the morning, saving us a lot of bus travel in a city that we weren't familiar with. The room was lovely, very clean and comfortable and had everything we needed. We would definitely stay again! "
2387605,28368910,2015-03-22,25012862,Manumalo,"What an absolutely wonderful, peaceful and clean oasis super close to the city for a short weekend trip. Less than ten minutes to Capitol Hill, downtown Seattle or Lower Queen Anne. Perfectly located. 

Kazami is such an awesome and gracious host. I did not meet his wife. They're undergoing some repairs on their first floor, the room we had was on the third floor. Everything was just as pictured on the Airbnb site. The room is on the third floor with a spacious room, walk-in closet, and it's own en-suite bathroom. Very clean, temperature control for the room and bathroom. Kazami provided an extra heater it case the central heat was not warming us up quick enough.

I loved how he had suggestions for things to do in the city. Provided pamphlets for restaurants nearby and transportation options. The private bathroom was a joy. Provided, soap, shampoo, clean towels, Q-tips, a brush and comb and in case you wore contact lenses and forgot your case there was one available :-). Great water pressure for the shower too.

I would highly recommend staying with Kazami for anyone who visits Seattle. I am definitely going to stay with him for my trips to Seattle!"
2387605,28730956,2015-03-29,1219868,Moritz W.,"Kazami and Mitsuko were wonderful hosts! I could not have asked for more. They were extremely nice, friendly and helpful from the beginning to the end. Kazami communicated everything perfectly and provided me with information about the city prior to my trip. During my stay they both did everything that made it a great time for me. I felt very welcomed and safe. The house is very clean. The room has a nice atmosphere. The neighborhood  is residential and quiet, just 5 walking minutes to the bus to downtown (25 min). If you appreciate good people who share their private house with you, you are right at  Kazami's and Mitsuko's home."
2387605,28973617,2015-04-01,18872267,Frederik,"Staying at Kazamis place was more than just sleeping in a nice and clean room with our own bathroom and feeling very comfortable. Kazami made us feel more than welcome from the very first moment and was interested in getting to know us.
He picked us up at the greyhound station, showed us his beautiful house, gave us a detailed map with recommended restaurants and bars, public transportation infos, places of interests and so on.
It was nice to not just stay at your place, me and Marie totally enjoyed having dinner with you and Mitzuko and also listening to you talking about your awesome travel adventure!
We can totally recommend staying with Kazami!"
2387605,29248342,2015-04-05,3212016,Tina,The only downside is that we  didn't  have enough time with them rather than that they're awesome hosts

2387605,30849926,2015-04-27,12992844,Aaron,"This was my first time I stayed with a host on AirBnB and my experience could have been more fantastic! Kazami and Mitsuko were the perfect hosts.  They opened their home, lives and dinner to me with no reserve. The house was beautiful, quiet and very easily accessible to anywhere you wanted to go because it was so close to the major freeways.  
The invited me to have dinner with them both night because I was traveling along and Kazami is an amazing cook and we had great conversations. They were very helpful with any inquiries that I had about sight seeing and tourist information. It was also very helpful to have you own key to the apartment so you do not feel time restrictions about coming or going.
The private room with private bathroom were clean, comfortable and very quiet so sleeping and showering were a breeze!
I highly recommend staying with Kazami and Mitsuko because your trip to Seattle will be that much better an experience if you do. "

Neighborhood was quiet, safe, and easy to go to downtown with public transit. Most of all, Kazami was the best host. He was such a nice person who generously offered a detailed local info, free breakfast, and a ride at the end of the trip. I definitely recommend this place and hope to come back in the future."

They provided a lot of information about transportation and the story of this city. They are very kind and passion to their guests. The room is very comfortable just like your own room and bright . They shared the living room and kitchen with guests. The space in the house is quite wide and warm. How an amazing B&B experience with them ! "
2387605,35298292,2015-06-17,30799572,Rainy,"It's a super satisfying Airbnb experience! Kazami and his wife are very helpful, easygoing and always did what they said. My friend and I lived at this place for one month and we enjoyed every second we shared with this couple. 

The place is very clean and organized. We lived at a private bedroom with a bathroom on the 3rd floor. The breeze is so nice and you won't feel hot even in the summer. The place is closed to China town (nice cuisine) and bus station. It only takes 10 mins for express to take you to all the spots in downtown. There are parks and bridges near the surrounding, don't miss I90 bridge if you're a runner. 

Kazami and His wife are organized people living with a healthy life style. Both of them are interesting person with good story to share. Kazami brought us to a tea house and introduced nice tea to us after knowing that I'm a tea lover. He also invited us to join their dinner after we came back from a long working day. BTW, Kazami is an awesome chef:-)

During our stay, they provided all kinds of help and tried to make us comfortable. We made good friends with each other and had our privacy at the same time. 

This couple and their place is my first impression of Seattle and they made me fall in love with this city. I'll definitely recommend this place to everyone who visit Seattle!"
2387605,35434559,2015-06-18,14662129,Marissa,"I would stay here again if just for the conversation, such an interesting and gracious couple. Add to that a lovely private room with ensuite, spotlessly clean, a house with great design, a little coffee shop around the corner for breakfast, and schedule allowing a pick up and drop off to transport, and you are onto a winner. We like to walk and if you are happy exploring and staying a little apart from the obvious downtown, this is for you."
2387605,35797675,2015-06-22,32057018,Kate,"Kazami and his wife were extremely accommodating. They were helpful with recommendations through out the city but were not intrusive. In between our excursions, we had great talk about traveling  and other interesting topic. The room was very clean and air. Had basic toiletries for us to use. Definitely recommend! "
2387605,35923146,2015-06-23,18302597,Lena,"Unfortunately we could only stay  one night with Kazami but the the house and the location were great! It's located really close to the international district and down town also. Kazami and his wife are great hosts!
I would definitely stay with them again"
2387605,36199731,2015-06-26,34064356,Kay,"The experience with Kazami Uchida was lovely. He has a beautiful home and made us feel welcome immediately. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable with a nice bathroom adjoining and a spacious closet. The house is a little bit removed from the center of town, but our hosts were incredibly generous in helping us navigate bus routes and making recommendations of things to do. Kazami even woke up early on the day we left to drive us to the ferry. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely go back. "
2387605,36384240,2015-06-28,31687815,Dan,"Our stay was exactly what we needed for our weekend away. Kazami and his wife have a beautiful home within walking distance from a conveniently located bus stop, which took us right downtown Seattle within 15 minutes. The space was very clean and offered all the amenities we needed. Although we spent most of our trip outside of the home, when we did run into Kazami he made sure we were doing okay and asked if we had any questions. From the moment he picked us up from our ferry, both my girlfriend and I appreciated his ability to make us feel welcome and I would definitely recommend this place to others."
2387605,37070355,2015-07-04,31683965,Matthew,I absolutely enjoyed staying with Kazami and his wife. The room was exactly as advertised and the whole house was beautiful and clean. He always asked how my day was and offered suggestions on things to do. Parking wasnt difficult and perfect location for everything. If I am ever in Seattle again I will definitely stay again.
2387605,37486553,2015-07-07,31474636,Jeroen,"Kazami and his wife made us feel really welcome in their home. He picked us up from the railway station. His house is in a nice, quiet neighbourhood, an easy 15 minute bus ride from down town. Kazami knows a lot about Seattle and gave us some great advice on places to visit. The room and the bathroom were very clean. Good value for money, I would recommend staying at Kazami’s place."
2387605,38010224,2015-07-12,34686270,Jeff,"Kazami made us feel right at home in his 3-story house. He and his wife greeted us upon arrival and were very helpful in communicating  with us leading up to our trip. They were both so kind and very easy to live with.

The description of the room was accurate and the house itself was very clean. We did not use the living room during our stay, but we did use their refrigerator. They also leant us pitchers and glasses for water. 

The house is on a quiet side street about a 40-minute walk from Pike Place Market. We did the walk a couple times during the day, but preferred to take an Uber (~$10) in the evening. Given that we had a rental car, the free street parking offered at this house was a huge plus.

We are so grateful to Kazami for making our stay so wonderful!"
2387605,38245235,2015-07-13,37194199,Jennifer," Kazami and Mitsuko were wonderful hosts.
Their beautiful modern house was close to downtown, and easy to find. The house was spotless and the room I stayed in was quiet and very comfortable and had an adjoining bathroom. It was on the 3rd floor and I felt like I was staying in a spacious upscale tree houseI I also really enjoyed sitting around and talking with the hosts. It was a great experience! Would highly recommend Kazami and Mitsuko's place to anyone!"
2387605,38615372,2015-07-17,35331586,Ayyappa,"I had a great time staying with Kazami and his family.  I was travelling with my parents and our stay at Kazami's residence was very welcoming and pleasant.  Kazami is a great host and keeps a very neat, clean, and comfortable home.  Kazami gave us plenty of recommendations to the local outings in Seattle which was very helpful.  The location of the house is great as well!  The home is minutes from Downtown Seattle and is also located in a cozy residential area.  Overall a fantastic experience!"
2387605,38720260,2015-07-18,28435035,April,"The host met us at the door to welcome us and walk us to our room.  The space was VERY clean and comfortable.  Our son slept on the couch (converted into a bed) and he said that was really comfortable, as well.  Loved the en suite bathroom and location of this home (which is within walking distance to CenturyLink field).  The ""extras"" in the room were very nice, such as four pillows, a blowdryer, kleenex, fan, and bedside lamp.  We will definitely consider staying here again when needing to be in downtown Seattle.
Thank you for your wonderful hospitality, Kazami!"
2387605,39216275,2015-07-21,613804,Anne-Kari,"We had three great days staying at Kazami's house! Everything was as described in the listing and pictures. The house, room and ensuite bathroom were beautiful, well equipped, spacious and clean, and the bed and sofa bed were both very comfortable. 

Kazami and his wife were wonderful hosts! Kazami even picked us up at the bus station and drove me to the light rail station when I was going to the airport. They were both very nice and interesting to talk to. One could tell that they were genuinely interested in meeting new people from all over the world, and we had some interesting conversations. However, they were never intrusive, we felt it was completely up to us if we wanted to stay downstairs for a conversation, or go straight up to our room.

The house was located in a nice and quiet residential area, with a very good and easy bus connection to get downtown. We never waited more than a few minutes, whether we were going into town or back home in the late evening. The ride itself was about fifteen minutes to the city centre (Pike Place, Art museum, Seattle's famous public library, shopping streets, lots of restaurants, etc.). China Town/International district is even closer to the house.

I highly recommend Kazami's place for a nice, safe and comfortable stay in Seattle."
2387605,39450025,2015-07-23,16590900,Bill,"Great place to stay -  very comfortable,  clean and quiet. Would definitely stay here again."
2387605,39493814,2015-07-24,32639613,Adam,Everything was as advertised. Kazami was an amazing host. We had a great time. 
2387605,39755178,2015-07-26,32639613,Adam,"Kazami was great! His place was cozy for 4 but even after some hesitation he allowed it and I think it worked out for everyone. We were there for a sports game and had some late nights and both him and his wife were great the entire time. 
Can't say enough good things, excellent location and excellent hosts along with excellent accommodations makes this a no-brainer recommendation. "
2387605,40334930,2015-07-30,24528636,Lucy,This is the first time to use airbnb and fortunately to met Mr. Mrs Kazami. The room is very clear and spacious. Mr. Kazami provided us with additional suggestions on where we should eat Japanese foods. Free park is convenice. Kazami and his wife very friendly and easy to talk.  Hope we'll comeback in the future.
2387605,41211287,2015-08-05,29815875,Carmen,"We enjoyed our stay at Kazami's house a lot. He was really kind and picked us up at mount baker station and when we left he gave us a lift again. Also he provided a lot of informations about seattle. The room was great and clean. The location is good too, even if it takes a bit to walk into the city. We could use the kitchen whenever we wanted. "
2387605,41403429,2015-08-07,37437909,Rachel,"Staying at Kazami's apartment was a great experience. He provided me with a ton of information before I arrived and always responded to my messages. The room felt very private and I had my own bathroom during my stay. I felt bad that I did not get to know Kazami more while I was in town because he was such a great host. He was even nice enough to give me a ride to the bus station when I was leaving. Thanks, Kazami!"
2387605,41441794,2015-08-07,38450112,Jonathan,Kazami was an exceptional host and the home was immaculate. Exactly what we needed for our time in Seattle! 
2387605,41758756,2015-08-09,26968463,Tanya,"We had a great stay in Seattle! Our hosts were friendly and made us feel welcome in their home. There house was close to downtown and it was easy to take the bus around town, while we parked our car for free. Their house was beautiful, modern and had everything we needed to feel at home away from home. "
2387605,42558666,2015-08-14,38127579,Zhihan,"I had a wonderful experience in Kazami's house. There may be a little bit stricr rules, but he really cares your feeling and experience. He provided us a very detailed instruction about reaching his house. And he picked up us though we arrived really late because of the flight delay. He provided many things for living convenience like shampoo, bath towel, laundry machine. Further, he provided much information about restaurants and interests through Google Map for travel convenience."
2387605,43260758,2015-08-18,38287067,Elaine,"We stayed with Kazami for 3 nights and checked out super early on our last day.  Kazami was a great host, and very accommodating to our early check out time.  Not only was the room exactly as promised in the pictures and other reviews; we also had the opportunity to talk with Kazami about things to do and about Seattle life.  It was a very nice experience, and we couldn’t have asked for more.  I would say the parking was definitely a plus because other places closer to downtown might have had little to no street parking.  We were 15-20 minutes or so away from just about anything we wanted to see in Seattle from his place, so it was pretty centrally located. The neighborhood was safe and quiet as the listing had described. The only downsides that I saw were that the bed was a little on the firm side and the towels weren’t my favorite.  Very minor things!  Overall, the listing was clean and all of the amenities were functional. Would definitely consider staying with Kazami again if we were in the Seattle area again. "
2387605,43536177,2015-08-20,39757370,康介,"We had a great time in their place. They are like a 2nd parents!! He took care of us very much. They supplied us confortable time in Seattle which they kept our luggage after check out. Also pick up and drop off us. 
If you want to spend special super time in Seattle, you should contact him just now!!"
2387605,44120229,2015-08-24,35712555,Ellie,My experience was great! I enjoyed staying in the home. It was very clean and comfortable. Kazami and his wife were very very nice. Will definitely stay again with them next time I go to Seattle.
2387605,44646005,2015-08-28,35346442,Carmen,"We had a very pleasant stay with Kazami and Mitsuko. The room and bathroom were very well furnished and neat as they appear in the photos. We were free to use the public areas including the living room and kitchen although we were usually out during the entire stay. Nonetheless, having that access made it feel like we were still at home. Kazami made sure that we had everything we neded in our room but also made comfortable for us to reach out if we needed anything further. Kazami also went above and beyond to pick us up from the train station when we arrived and drop us off at the station EARLY in the morning when we departed for free, which we were not expecting and are extremely appreciative of! Overall, great stay, great locaition, great family, and a very cool towel rack. Would HIGHLY recommend."
2387605,44942705,2015-08-30,2899352,Julie,"We really enjoyed staying at Kazami's place. The house was cool-looking and modern, and the room is super clean, spacious, and has a bathroom attached! Kazami was a gracious host, made us feel very welcome and gave us good tips for what to do around Seattle. He even gave us a ride to the train station on the way to the airport. Thank you Kazami for hosting us!"
2387605,52043683,2015-10-26,32423315,Celia,"I stayed in Kazami and Mitsuko's home for a period of two weeks where I worked in the downtown area. They are such a friendly couple, very helpful, and will endeavor to make your stay as comfortable as possible. The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars is because there was construction for the duration of my time there, which of course couldn't be helped, but it unfortunately impacted on my stay and sleeping pattern. Also, I worked until very late at night and wasn't fully comfortable with the bus ride home. That being said, the bus ride during the day time is incredibly convenient and fast, so anyone visiting who doesn't intend to go home alone late at night will be perfectly happy getting to and from downtown. The home is about a 20 minute walk away from the international district, which has really great food, and I also walked into downtown every day (took 40 mins) as well as walked into Capitol Hill a couple of times. I loved walking and running in the area. Apart from the construction, the room was quiet and peaceful. I would recommend Kazami and Mitsuko's home to anyone on a regular work schedule (ie: not coming home very late at night) as well as travelers who are looking to get off the beaten path while still wanting to have easy accessibility to commercial Seattle."
2387605,53521576,2015-11-09,16493764,Tiaohua,"That was great to staying Kazami's house. The house is clean and comfortable, also very close to China town. he is very nice host, and so helpful to carrying my heavy bag when reaching his home. "
2387605,53734906,2015-11-11,23502865,Kristin,"Kazami was very responsive and flexible with our check in time.  The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the bathroom was well stocked. The location is just minutes away from downtown, but street parking was not a problem.  Our stay was short this time – I wish it were longer because this home is very restful. "
2387605,55929470,2015-12-07,37940434,Esdras,"Kazami and his wife did more than expected for make my stay with them incredible. All was perfect and amazing clean.  Since you arrive Kazami try his best for make your stay unique. As I stayed almost 4 weeks I could experience a great service each day.

His house is so lovely and minimalist. Room is nice and specious, shower & bed are really great. All the facilities are in perfect conditions. 

Kazami try to make your stay as comfortable as possible including pick up and drop off at the train station, trips to the super market and great conversations. He is a great host always trying to offer the best experience.

The location also is really good. Using the bus the routes 7&9 connects you to the main routes of Seattle. Also driving or Uber are great. If you drive, you will have a very easy access to Bellevue and major freeways and avenues. 

Close to the house there are different shops and restaurants for make your life easier and always super close to downtown and the International district. 

Even there is a construction going on near by, I couldn't notice and was not a problem during my almost 4 weeks stay. The neighbourhood is safe and clean with a great park just 2 blocks away. 

In my next visits to Seattle definitely I will stay here again and I recommend to anybody that travel to Seattle to stay with Kazami. "
2387605,56681443,2015-12-16,49837679,Shucheng,"Kazami and his wife were both very welcoming and accommodating as they would talk with us and provide a lot of useful advice from the native perspective during our stay. Kazami was strict and rigorous, and I would highly recommend him as a person. The house was elegant from outside and tidy and neat from inside, located in a quiet neighbourhood which is near everything."
2387605,57038094,2015-12-21,34909643,Mohd,We had a nice time in Seattle and at Kazami's place. He was kind enough to receive us late at night and was constantly asking if everything was okay. He even provided travel ideas for our upcoming trip.
8050642,46044928,2015-09-07,432368,Sameer,"Beautiful house, very well kept, very clean.  Lots of space.  Nice small backyard.   Great residential location that is within 20 minutes of most places you want to travel to in Seattle.

A couple of issues with the house - dishwasher wasn't working, one bathroom vent didn't work and the sink disposal did not work.  The disposal was fixed the day after we told the owner about it, the rest I believe they are planning to fix soon. "
8050642,51317061,2015-10-19,28891800,Argon,"The house is very beautiful, clean and quiet, and exactly the same as shown in pictures. It's a very convenient place and only take 20 mins to downtown.  My friends and I had an excellent experience in the house."
8050642,56598184,2015-12-15,46885970,Leah,This house was gorgeous. Really comfortable and in a fantastic location. The kitchen had more than we needed it too was stocked perfectly. The house was warm and really clean. The only negative was the stairs. But Joe provided a baby gate and I was able to close at least one area off from my curious toddler. It isn't a very toddler friendly house but Joe at least provides a way around it. The most beautiful park is 2 blocks away and gave the family hours of enjoyment. 
2605975,14142747,2014-06-13,4024102,Wee Meng,The reservation was canceled 5 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2605975,14215119,2014-06-14,15828216,Julie,"I loved staying with Nadine. The room and bathroom were extremely clean and really comfortable. They are located downstairs whereas all other rooms are upstairs, so it was like having my own apartment. Also, the room has a sliding door that leads to a private backyard/garden. Gorgeous. 

Nadine herself was very relaxed and accommodating. She asked me if I needed anything and she was always quick to respond to messages on AirBnb. She allowed me the full use of her kitchen as well. Overall, she made my experience great. Highly recommended!"
2605975,14324594,2014-06-16,15743219,David,"My stay was very comfortable. The room and bathroom is clean and pleasant, well isolated and looks out to the garden. Also, it is  a nice walk to Green Lake. Highly recommend."
2605975,15071815,2014-07-01,2838135,Christopher,"Nadine was a very pleasant host and so were her roommates. The room was comfortable and cozy and the best feature was that it had its own private attached bathroom! The room and bed were small but I spent most of the time out and about so it worked just fine for me. The neighborhood was nice and right on the express bus line, making it very easy to get to downtown. I would definitely stay with Nadine again!"
2605975,16132872,2014-07-22,7114571,Danny,"Pretty nice place, good bathroom, somewhat convenient given proximity to the E line.  Uncomfortable bed.  I never met the owners...  I think.  I met one random person who may or may not have been living there...?  Meh."
2605975,16785880,2014-08-02,13740672,Phil,Nadine was home when I arrived and let me in early which was appreciated. The room was fine and met my needs as a single with bed/chair and bath with shower. I was given use of the refrigerator and laundry. The area was close to restaurants in Greenwood and Greenlake (within walking distance). Females might consider not walking as the surrounding area around Aurora can be sketchy although generally safe. On street parking was not close which was fine for me since I did not have a rental car. The bus stop was outside about 100' with service to my office and back. Convenience store was across the street. So a great stay if you are single and don't have a car and don't mind walking short distances. I also will say the area was very quiet and great for sleeping. I was left alone  but helped if needed and promptly. So all in all I was pleased with the week I spent and found the convenience of the bus and nearby restaurants particularly helpful. I was also given help using an application on my Smartphone for bus schedules which was great. 
2605975,20720760,2014-10-04,20640343,Natalie,"The hosts were extremely pleasant and helpful for the whole stay. The house was just as described, though it exceeded my expectations. Quiet home, little private back yard with tall pine trees - relaxing.. Very comfortable, cozy, fully isolated space with private bathroom. The kitchen and living upstairs fully accessible to the guests. Nice and clean place. I loved two little pets that showed up a couple times (tiny white doggy and matching furry kitty :) Very pleasant stay, will definitely use this accommodation in the future and recumbent to others."
2605975,21273463,2014-10-13,22407331,Jesse,"I stayed here for two nights - Nadine was very friendly, and she was able to book me last minute which was a huge relief. The location is very nice, within walking distance to plenty of great restaurants and bars. The room is very nice as well - it's a private room with a comfortable bed, and a full private bathroom. I would absolutely recommend this room to someone looking for a place to stay in the Seattle/Greenlake area."

2605975,26668058,2015-02-16,13924584,Ginny,"Nadine made me feel welcome by answering texts quickly and when I had to book two extra days, she said if I needed anything to let her know. I was happy to find out the room was so close to where my daughter lives, so that was a plus. I liked having a bathroom adjoining the room. The room was quiet and sleep is crucial to me as I have fibromyalgia. I enjoyed the dog and cat. "
2605975,32395523,2015-05-17,32347028,Ekaterina,"Liked the location, close to the Green Lake! Few nice places to eat around. Easy to get to downtown. Quiet at night. I would suggest Nadine to update pictures of a living room and upload a picture of a room just to know what to expect."
2605975,33153023,2015-05-25,26157845,Rena,"This room  was pretty much exactly as described: perfect for someone looking for a place to sleep, twin bed, the only room on the first floor, entry right by the entrance, private bathroom, private access to a well kept yard. The neighborhood is urban, but the entry away from the street felt private and safe. It's a short steep walk uphill to parking on the residential streets. I appreciated the location, just a few minutes bike ride, maybe about ten blocks, to Green Lake. I was busy with work, out early and home late, so rarely explored upstairs or saw the hosts.  "
2605975,34359687,2015-06-07,26446084,Lesley,"The private room and bath was just what I was looking for, and close to everything.  Nadine was gracious about my late arrival, and her dog and cat were very friendly and an added bonus attraction.  Street parking was readily available around the block, and I felt secure parking my car at night and walking back to her house.  All in all, highly recommended."
2605975,35005115,2015-06-14,34381798,Ken,Nadine's place was as described and stocked with necessities. The neighborhood was quiet and felt safe.  I would recommend this place for anyone looking for a quick place to stay while in Seattle.  Thanks again!
2605975,35252779,2015-06-16,4990534,Orson,Nadine's Place was just as expected and very convenient to Green Lake. I had a great experience!
2605975,35887818,2015-06-22,19844819,David,"I got exactly what I needed: a nice, clean, quiet, comfortable room where I could crash after a long and difficult day. It has a private entrance so I had easy access without disturbing anyone else."
2605975,36645366,2015-06-29,21232623,Taylor,Staying here was peaceful and private. I enjoyed my time and will definitely consider staying here again when I need an airbnb in Seattle. Thanks for the hospitality Nadine!
2605975,37501412,2015-07-07,19495502,David,"Lovely friendly hosts, including the dog and cat."
2605975,37719697,2015-07-09,37512035,Laura,"I'll definitely be recommending Nadine's place to anyone who comes to visit me here once I'm settled.  The accommodations were lovely and very private, including private bath and patio opening to a lovely yard from the room itself, which is the only room on the first floor.  Nadine was even very accommodating of my late arrival time and her pets made me feel all the more at home.  She even allowed me to do a load of laundry while I was there!!  She did require at least 24 hrs in order to cancel when I was offered other accommodations, but, given just how nice she and this place were, I really had zero problem with that as I already felt as if she could have been charging double (or more) for just how nice the room was."
2605975,37901954,2015-07-11,36996106,Melissa,"The room was small, quiet and clean, exactly as advertised.  The townhouse is in a good location in the Green Lake area near bus stops and main thoroughfare, Aurora Ave.  The private bath was perfect, and well stocked.  Nadine and her roommate were welcoming and friendly.  The room is simple and basic, but perfect if you're spending most of your time out exploring Seattle.  Thanks, Nadine!"
2605975,38750417,2015-07-18,33000668,Colin,"Nadine's place is in a great location, and close to Greenlake and many restaurants. Street parking is easy to find, and Starbucks is about 2 blocks away. The room and bathroom were immaculately clean, and instructions were clear and easy to follow. When Nadine was not around, her roommate was more than helpful in providing information on nearby restaurants, and engaged well in conversation. Nadine's cat and dog are adorable and friendly. I would definitely stay here again!!"
2605975,40601262,2015-08-01,30506513,繰取,"Safe and quiet place!
And of course, cute lovely cat!"
2605975,40974180,2015-08-03,29170540,Matthias,Had a really good time at Nadine's place. The room was clean and roomy :-) Hope to be back soon. Thanks!
2605975,41394104,2015-08-07,37099704,Sitha,Nadine and her roommate Melanie are true kind souls. They are naturally informative and extremely helpfulI stayed at their place 3 nights and I felt like home .   The room and attached bathroom  itself are very clean . The bed is on the hard side but it's fine to me .one of the best thing about Nadine 's place is you will get your privacy since you have your own excess to your room without disturbing the host .                    Location is great on solid and safe residential  area  . I don't have a car so I depended on the bus which is easy to go anywhere especially to tourist attraction in downtown . Their  fun pets are the plus that make you laugh and smile ...
2605975,41786548,2015-08-09,37052425,Daniel,Very private room anservice accommodating host. Will visit again on the next trip. Thanks!
2605975,43451535,2015-08-19,41425634,Mary-Ann,"Nadine was very welcoming! I had a little trouble finding the place since I was coming in late and had to call Nadine. She meet me and escorted me to her place. Her place was in a very pleasant neighborhood and convenient to public transportation since I did not have a car with me on this trip. The place was very clean, inviting and quiet! I would definitely stay here again!"
2605975,43677273,2015-08-21,40335666,Ming,"Nadine is a very nice person. The room is very clean, and the location is good. I like Seattle, and I like Nadine and her room."
2605975,43828089,2015-08-22,40323178,Peter,"Great, peaceful rest.  Just what I needed to recover from the flight.  Easy bus trip into town"
2605975,44234261,2015-08-24,424944,Alice,Seamless experience from the moment I booked last minute to email and directions to the house. 
2605975,44712428,2015-08-28,8930689,Fiona,Room was clean and as described. Didn't meet Nadine but she was helpful by text.
2605975,46510065,2015-09-11,2196157,Barbara,A very quiet private space in the convenient Green Lake neighborhood. It was a perfect respite after my hectic days. I recommend Nadine's place to anyone. 
2605975,47019963,2015-09-14,1214046,Don,"I appreciated Nadine's response to a one issue and she responded with an immediate answer that solved the issue immediately.  It is a clean, compact room with it's own bathroom, desk and very comfortable bed.  I appreciated the privacy Nadine provided to me, which was needed that weekend.  Should I require another place to stay, I would stay again, considering the location, rental rate and cleanliness.  Also, Nadine's cat and dog are very friendly."
2605975,47137774,2015-09-15,9209977,Terri,"Love this little place!  Nadine is very gracious.  I had gotten in late and she let me know through text any extra instructions that I might need.  It is quiet, private and nice and dark for a great nights sleep.  Perfect for one person and the bath is spacious as well.  Thanks so much!  "
2605975,47366673,2015-09-18,40023031,Brian,"I stayed for 2 nights while I was in town for a wedding. All I needed was a place to sleep, and Nadine's was only three blocks from the hub of the activity. For me, the location was ideal, and there was nothing about the neighborhood that gave me worry. This was my first Airbnb, and I would use it again. Nadine communicated well with me prior to my arrival. The room was simple & modern. And clean. Nadine even supplied bottled water, toothpaste and toothbrushes, and a city guide. There is wifi. I met the roommate, but I never actually met Nadine.  The house has a security system that anyone should be able to manage. The door to my room locked from the inside, but I failed to see how it would lock from the outside, so you might not wish to leave valuables there while you are gone. The dog is friendly & funny. I left the room door open once when I left because the cat went under the bed and wanted to stay there. All in all, I had a very positive experience. I was unclear about going elsewhere in the house, I guess because I didn't get to ask Nadine. If not allowed, this would probably be a better short term than long term arrangement."
2605975,47848435,2015-09-21,42866181,Ariani,"Nadine's place was very convenient, located only 10 mins away from bus stop E line which brings you to downtown. Her place was very clean and neat. Nadine, together with Mica and Casper (the cat and the dog), was very friendly and she was so kind that she let me checked in earlier and stored my luggage bit longer after check out. Definitely a recommended place to stay in Seattle!"
2605975,47863374,2015-09-21,31979413,Kim,"It was a great experience. Nadine was very nice. It's a well-kept room and was super hassle free. If I had one critique, there is no parking on the street outside the place.  Thanks!"
2605975,49704069,2015-10-05,44792761,Behrad,"good place, very cute pets"
2605975,50894343,2015-10-15,10293400,해진,Both Nadine and her roommate were really nice and quickly responded to my requests. The private bedroom and bathroom for this price is just awesome. Easy 20minute access to downtown and the neighborhood is also really safe. I especially enjoyed the green lake park. Also mica and casper(pets) were definitely what I liked most about my stay at Nadine's place. I would definitely stay here again.
2605975,51215119,2015-10-18,31319072,Macy,"I had a good stay. The location was great and the host was friendly. The room was perfect for one person, the bathroom was really nice and the towels were extremely fluffy! They even had disposable toothbrushes out in case you forgot one (the thing I did forget!). Would recommend!"
2605975,51835342,2015-10-24,7274055,Shing,Nadine was a very friendly.  Clear instructions were given and I was able to let myself in easily.  It is a nice private room with a private bathroom and access to a the backyard.  I was there for a few days and it was private and quiet.  The parking was a couple of blocks away but very easy to find parking and not a far walk at all.  It was perfect for my needs.  I would highly recommend this room for a solo traveler.
2605975,51998439,2015-10-25,44308707,Analee,"Nadine was absolutely amazing, not only was she welcoming but was kind enough to work around my schedule. The room was perfect, and came with complimentary toiletries. Made you feel right a home/hotel, overall my experience was an absolute joy."
2605975,52735557,2015-11-01,38086404,Lauren,"Nadine and her housemates were very helpful and welcoming. Waiting in the room when I arrived were two water bottles and a guide to Seattle. They were very flexible with my needs for arriving/leaving and their location is perfect. Within fifteen minutes of Capitol Hill and five minutes walking distance from Green Lake. Thanks, guys!"
2605975,53035297,2015-11-03,13751289,Stephen,Perfect place to stay near Green Lake. Very accommodating! Thanks Nadine
2605975,53102826,2015-11-04,29441943,Paul,"Nadine was home when I arrived, and was very polite.  Her place was fantastic!  I wish I could have booked longer.  Nadine was kind enough to even provide hotel like tooth brushes, a welcome note with instructions about the house, and a welcome to Seattle book.  
The room itself was very clean.  I think having the on suite bathroom is a major plus.  Internet speed was fast, and having a desk was great.
I will stay there again if needed, and if available.
Thanks Nadine!"
2605975,53232903,2015-11-06,20941654,Michael,Highly recommended.  Comfortable.  Convenient.  Cozy.  Clean.  Private.  And Nadine made it all no-hassle.
2605975,53422589,2015-11-08,2612686,Steven,"The set up for getting in and out of Nadine's place is very slick and convenient. The place is pretty easy to find. Although it's off a busy street, once you're in, you'd never know it. The pictures and the description are accurate. It's a solid choice of a place to sleep when you only need a room for yourself to sleep for the night. The bathroom is right there. They have a dog and a cat and they're both very friendly. It was a very inexpensive option for a place to spend the night and I'd recommend it to others. One other thing was that it was very clean and that's very important to me."
2605975,53712984,2015-11-11,47783779,Joy,"Nadine made me feel welcome even before I arrived. She kindly allowed me to drop off my luggage a couple hours before the official check-in time. The instructions she gave me (to get into the apartment and connect to the wi-fi, etc.) were easy to follow. Her neighborhood is quiet and pleasant to walk about in. Inside, the room is neat, cozy, and well decorated. She provides bottled water, towels, soap, shampoo, a hair dryer, lotion, and even a toothpaste and packaged toothbrush in case you need one. Her pets (a cat and a dog) are incredibly friendly and cute. If you'd like first-rate hotel service with a homelike feel, stay here."
2605975,53777119,2015-11-12,30602001,Jodi,"The room and the home is just as described. Instructions were easy to follow. The room was clean and comfortable. Nadine greeted me as I came in and made sure I had everything I needed but then I was left completely alone. It was perfect for what I needed . . . a bed overnight. If you have your own vehicle, parking is kind of hard to come by. I had to park a block away on 84th Street. "
2605975,54200930,2015-11-16,31621902,Richelle,"Nadine was there when I arrived. The accommodations were as described. Very nice place. Even though it was located near a very busy street, the room was quiet. "
2605975,56214121,2015-12-10,10595532,Rachel,"I had a good time in Nadine's home! 
Room was cozy and comfortable. 
Area js good! Nice ;) "
2605975,56318937,2015-12-12,21488958,Chris,Nadine was very accomodating. The space was comfy and quiet. I would stay again for sure.
2605975,56726531,2015-12-17,35332298,Asaad,"Nadine was a good host. She kindly allowed me to check in before the check in time. The instructions Nadine gave on how to get into the house, connect to the WiFi , et cetera , were very clear and easy to follow. The room was very clean, private and as described.The cat and the dog were both nice and friendly. I highly recommend this place."
1417880,6017336,2013-07-26,3192103,Nik,Great simple place.   Very nice host.  
1417880,6095769,2013-07-29,7569867,Patrick,"Clean space, easy to get to / from downtown.  Friendly and reachable host."
1417880,6290279,2013-08-06,7637726,Alex,"The apartment was clean and quite spacious, with a full kitchen.  The location was great, walking distance from major bus stops and countless restaurants.  Melissa was really accommodating and flexible as well."
1417880,6335262,2013-08-08,7862002,Andrea,The space was pleasant and in a great location.  Melissa was easy to reach and accommodating. 
1417880,6825305,2013-08-26,8023710,Benjamin,"A comfortable apartment in quiet building. It was larger than I expected with a walk in closet and good sized kitchen. Nothing fancy, but it suited my needs well. My only criticisms were that the refrigerator was a bit loud at times and the Wifi could have been faster, but it wasn't too slow (I have had slower in hotels)."
1417880,7456701,2013-09-21,6755552,Andrew,Nice room. Clean and easy. Great stay. 
1417880,8925604,2013-11-26,7728947,Dustin,"I was in town for a medical rotation at UW. Very convenient for UW Medical Center and the shuttle to Harborview. The stay was surprisingly quiet given the proximity to ""the Ave"". The floors were a bit creaky but didn't get in the way of sleeping and studying. The apartment had everything I needed for cooking, etc. I'd stay again..."
1417880,10624930,2014-02-28,12325875,Marc-André,"Very basic, but clean and close to the University of Whasington. The chocolate bar waiting for me in the kitchen was a nice attention."
1417880,17332098,2014-08-11,8841374,Mansheng,"Melissa was a great host. She responded promptly to my queries. The apt was clean, quiet and very close to restaurants and bus stops. It was basic but very comfortable."
1417880,18583767,2014-08-28,20128892,Alex,"The check in process was very easy, and Melissa was very flexible with the check-in time, which was helpful when my plane was delayed coming in. The room was clean and simple and the kitchen had everything I needed to heat up leftovers. The place abuts an alleyway, so on hot days when you need to leave the windows open, trash days can be a little noisy in the mornings. "
1417880,18960189,2014-09-03,3437245,Joshua,This was pretty much as advertised. It was a full apartment in a great location. It isn't the nicest place I have gotten on airbnb but it was a good deal. This apartment does not seem like it is occupied full time which means it is pretty bare bones. Melissa was great to deal with and the logistics were a breeze. She accommodated our late arrival no problem. 
6183721,31414571,2015-05-04,26743134,Julie,"This sleek and contemporary condo was just what we were looking for.  GREAT it was walking distance for so many great eats in Fremont.  Tina connected with us personally to make sure everything was good AND big bonus ... she is a very knowledgeable food & restaurant expert in Seattle!  Right away she sent us to a restaurant that was amazing just 5 min away.

The place was clean and bright, stocked with the basics. Lovely new towels and sheets. The AM light comes through the front sliding door where trees sway, we had coffee on the deck looking towards downtown (great coffee at Cafe Ladro, I might add, a block away!). Nice big TV screen, we watched HBO at night after an easy hop onto the 99 to see our Seattle Rep show.

Nice windows that open well for a breeze in both bedrooms.  David loved the chaise-style section of the couch.  Good books to read and good suggestions from Tina, too, on what to do in Seattle when you only have 2 days!  Easy access - it was great to have our own pking spot behind the building.

With 2 bedrooms, I imagine this would be good for a couple with kids or 2 couples who wanted to split the space.  Probably ideal for any visiting University parents.  

We were happy to have a place in Fremont which I have never explored and good suggestion from Tina to visit the legendary ""Fremont Troll"" only a few minutes away.  Who wouldn't want to miss that?

We had a sudden challenge -  and so appreciate Tina called back within a few minutes to help us with the Internet  so we could get a crucial business document out.

She's a very attentive hostess, but never intrusive.  Thank you for the Fremont Experience, Tina.  We will be back again.  "
6183721,31749105,2015-05-09,2187311,Laura,Tina texted several time with information that we needed for the Condo and quickly responded when we asked specific answers. The morning we were checking out Tina kindly texted not to worry about what time we were checking out to just have a relaxing which I found very thoughtful. 
6183721,31864276,2015-05-10,21173126,Bobby,The apartment was very nice. Lots of space in the living room and the bedrooms were comfortable. Check in and out was a breeze and the hosts were helpful and easy to communicate with.
6183721,32589190,2015-05-19,32370669,Christa,"Both Tina and this condo were great. The place was very clean,  well prepared for my guests,  and well stocked. The building had great perking for the area and it's location to the sites of Fremont is perfect.  I strongly recommend both Tina and this super cute condo! "
6183721,33827754,2015-06-01,15545180,Naurry,"Tina was a great host and very responsive to our questions about the condo! I appreciated the timeliness of her communication before and during our stay in Seattle.

The location can't be beat! So close to the heart of Fremont with all the bars, coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. It was the perfect respite -- comfortable for our party of four."
6183721,34233930,2015-06-06,4608138,Janet,"Tina was awesome! The location is centrally located and I was able to use the bus, grab dinner and groceries all within a few minute walk to her place. The rooms are spacious and the place comes equipped with everything you need - washer, dryer and a fully stocked kitchen of utensils. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. Thanks Tina!"
6183721,34543023,2015-06-09,32133598,David,"It was an absolute pleasure staying at Tina's property.  The places was clean,  comfortable,  and in one of the best locations in Seattle.  The immediate neighbor was very quiet even with great nightlife just a block away! It was very easy to walk around or take a quick ride downtown. 

Tina was very attentive without smothering,  a sign that she really cares about her guests.  We will definitely keep this place in mind the next time we visit the Emerald City. "
6183721,34648341,2015-06-10,1685546,Richard,I just need a place to crash with my parents for a night. This was perfect close to everything and Tina was super friendly.
6183721,34894154,2015-06-13,31347229,Jay,Tina made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  She was very clear in her instructions to access the place and everything was well arranged.  My parents had a wonderful experience!
6183721,35095897,2015-06-15,13451739,Maya,"Our stay in Seattle was absolutely perfect- Tina was such a gracious and welcoming host, and the apartment itself and the surrounding neighborhood are beautiful!! Staying in Fremont was a great decision, and allowed us to have what seemed like a more authentic experience and see some of the more local spots such as Fremont Brewery, Westward restaurant on the water, Naked City brewery and the wonderful Sunday market in Fremont. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, well decorated and welcoming- there was even a bottle of wine out to greet us! The balcony with the view of the mountain was perfect for a nice summer evening.  I would highly recommend this AirBnB. Thanks for the warm welcome, Tina!"
6183721,35325264,2015-06-17,34311333,Nicole,"This place was great and exactly as described. In fact, I think it was even better!  Tina was available to help us find a place to eat in the neighborhood and even left us a nice bottle of wine to enjoy on the balcony.  Would definitely recommend this place and would love to come back again!"
6183721,36099169,2015-06-25,30416243,Luann,"We can't say enough positive things about our stay.  Accommodations were neat, clean and had everything we needed to make our stay enjoyable.  Our hostess was very good about communicating prior to our arrival, checked with us after our arrival to be sure we were settled in and had what we needed, offered ideas about things to see and do in the area that would appeal to our family dynamics and touched base with us after our departure.  I would definitely recommend this location to anyone considering a stay in the Freemont area.  SO easy to get in and out of Seattle proper and within walking distance of downtown Freemont's shops, eateries, etc.  This property was everything it was advertised to be and more.  We'll be going back for sure!  "
6183721,36206912,2015-06-26,9432315,John,Cozy spot in a highly walkable part of Fremont neighborhood. Space was cozy and clean. Not much for unique character inside but a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainier over the Aurora bridge from the balcony outside. Three of us stayed one night and cooked all meals at home. Adequate setup and great value. I'd stay here again. Thank you Tina!
6183721,36342187,2015-06-27,33215459,Lori,"We were only there for one night and spent very little time in the condo, but it was definitely a charming and comfortable place to spend that one night!  So much better than a hotel room.  The view from the balcony is amazing--especially since the weather was so nice.  Tina was *very* good at communicating.  I always received extremely fast responses to any query, and she was very accommodating.  The beds were good, the bathroom well-stocked, she has wireless (yay!) and her instructions were clear and complete.  My sister said the lock box for the key was a little sticky, but if no one else has mentioned that I think it could be put to user error.  :-)  The only thing I can think of has to do with the weather--while beautiful, it also got unseasonably hot, and the condo was pretty warm.  This is not a call to spring for air conditioning, but a fan might be a good idea."
6183721,36542548,2015-06-29,2212346,Emily,Tina's condo was perfect for our group of four people for the weekend. The neighborhood was great and there was so much within walking distance. Tina was really friendly and even brought over fans for us during an unusual PNW heat wave. 
6183721,36909664,2015-07-02,21698056,Kira,"My stay at Tina's apartment in Fremont was very enjoyable. The Apartment was just like the pictures: clean, comfortable and a great location! I would absolutely recommend this home to a friend and I would stay here again."
6183721,37313916,2015-07-06,24559644,Drew,We are a mom and dad traveling with two kids.  The apartment met all our needs and was very clean.  The location was great with restaurants and cafes in the neighborhood and excellent access to public transit.  The host Tina was super-accommodating and helpful. Highly recommend.
6183721,42831854,2015-08-16,910128,Jacob,"I stayed at this apartment for SIX WEEKS while working at the University of Washington. Hear my words!

APARTMENT: looks just like the pictures. Everything is clean, appliances are modern, and the bed is comfortable. Drinking coffee on the balcony every morning is a true pleasure; on clear days you can see Mount Rainier. The unit is on the top floor, so it's totally quiet, even though there's an active nightlife just a block away.

NEIGHBORHOOD: lots of fun stuff to walk to just a block or two away (some favorites: Cafe Ladro, Revel/Quoin, Wright Brother Bicycles), and it's right by the Burke-Gilman trail, which you can bike or jog on to UW and beyond on one side, and to the Ballard Locks on the other. The neighborhood is active and fun, with a perfect mix of restaurants, cafes, bars, bookstores, and bicycle shops. Gas Works Park is a short walk, and on the way back you can get groceries at PCC, or you can make a short detour up to the Fremont Brewery or Milstead Coffee. It's not really walkable to downtown, but Seattle buses are frequent and easy, especially since Tina left us two Orca Cards to use; we took buses to Ballard, downtown, SLU, and the U-district, and it was easy in every case. The only negative is that for now (August 2015), there is no bike share in Fremont, so don't count on getting around that way.

THE HOST: Some people are just born to do this. Tina really goes out of her way to think about what her guests need and to make sure that they are comfortable -- starting with a six-pack of local craft beer in the fridge when I arrived. Since I was staying for several weeks, she even met me before my visit to show me around. She was super responsive throughout the stay, and accommodating in every way. She's a big foodie, and wrote up a helpful guide to some of the great restaurants that are in short walking distance from the house. "
6183721,43780918,2015-08-22,9271915,Jeff,"Perfect Fremont 'hood location, great view from balcony and nice off-street parking. Tina was super about details and requests. The bedrooms are large-ish and beds comfy. Kitchen well equipped and easy to use. I'd stay there again."
6183721,44290817,2015-08-25,7512123,Steve,We had a great stay in Tinas Apartment. The Apartment is spacious and well equipped and comfortable. Great neighborhood with all you may need near by and convenient to the rest of the city. The included parking space was an added bonus I wasn't aware of at booking and made coming and going easy as we didn't have to hassle with finding parking. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Tina.
6183721,44716049,2015-08-28,41831468,Nordica,"Perfect Fremont apartment super close to fun shopping, restaurants, and bus lines (easy ride downtown) .  The apartment has everything we needed, super comfortable bed, nice kitchen, and my favorite perfectly cute balcony.  Tina was super responsive to questions about the apartment and neighborhood. She accommodated the flexible check-in/check-out times we needed which made our stay stress free.   Would definitely stay again. Thanks Tina!"
6183721,45244297,2015-09-01,19997384,Samson,"Tina was an amazing host! Her lovely apartment in the heart of Fremont was the perfect place to stay for our four day vacation. She accommodated the four of us beyond what was expected, even offering an additional mattress for a fifth friend who was contemplating on joining us last minute. She kept in touch throughout our whole trip, checking in on us for our electricity when Seattle had a major power outage during one of the days we were there. Her beautiful home was well kept and clean, with extra beer in the fridge (always a plus in our books!). She even left us with extra time to check out for our 10pm flight! Would not hesitate to come back again to stay with her!!"
6183721,46267170,2015-09-09,33605676,Tony,Really nice place in a great location. Would definitely stay there again.
6183721,47147732,2015-09-16,32824662,Michael,"Great experience staying at Tina's apartment!  Tina was very responsive any time we contacted her.  Apartment was exactly as described, pictures totally accurate!  Devoted parking space if you feel you need a car, which we did have, but you really don't need one if you aren't planning on leaving the city.  We did drive one day to Port Townsend, and another to Salish Lodge (you should really have breakfast there one day), but the bus lines running only two blocks away made travel to downtown easy.  Excellent restaurants in easy walking distance from the apartment;  Rock Creek Seafood, Roxy's Diner (great breakfast), Norm's Ale House, Red Star Tacos.  Truly excellent restaurants in a truly excellent neighborhood, while staying in a truly perfect apartment.  Tina had beer, coffee, bus schedules, travel guides, and a list of great restaurants waiting for us when we arrived.  As others have said, coffee on the balcony in the morning is a total treat!   Comfortable beds, nice linens, well stocked kitchen and bathroom, washer and dryer; what more could you want??  I would HIGHLY recommend this apartment, and Tina as a host, to anyone traveling to the Seattle area.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again!   THANKS TINA!!!!!!!!!"

6183721,49898046,2015-10-07,20990332,Damanveer,"Tina was an amazing host.  I would give her a 10 out of 10. My fiance, two friends and myself stayed at her condo for 2 nights as we were in town for a Seahawks Monday Night Football game.  Her condo literally had everything a person needs when on vacation.  She even let us check in and check out a few hours earlier/ later.  The  area in which the condo was located was perfect, quiet and easy-going.  The condo was very cleanly and comfortable.  I would most definitely stay at her condo when visiting Seattle again.  Thanks Tina! "
6183721,50447987,2015-10-12,23503330,Sam,The house was great! Very clean and great location. 
6183721,51969683,2015-10-25,1273225,Ryan,"Great location, great apartment. I would definitely stay here again."
6183721,52844678,2015-11-02,43737453,Ann,"Tina immediately emailed me a warm welcome, offered to be of assistance. I engaged her about what venues would be open and we would like over the holiday weekend which was a great help.
The apartment was as described, clean, and well-looked after. We felt right at home and plan to book there for our trip to Seattle in January."
6183721,53462618,2015-11-09,17970050,Lauren,"Great location in Fremont, couldn't have asked for a more convenient location to check out the neighborhood. Having parking on the premises was nice too since parking can sometimes be hard to find."
6183721,54125769,2015-11-16,20498675,Jeanette,Loved the location and the place really cozy. A lot of nice places to see only walking distance. 
6183721,55463830,2015-12-01,7092501,Courtney,"Tina's place was beautiful, up-to-date and in a PERFECT location to explore the city! "
6183721,56266942,2015-12-11,35589928,Danielle,"Great location and very walkable to Fremont with convenient parking for when you need a car to go further. The apartment was nice, very spacious with a full kitchen, but a bit worn. Heater wasn't working in one of the bedrooms, one of the sink drains was plugged, the bedrooms didn't have decent lighting ... all small inconveniences that made it obvious no one is treating this place as a ""home."""
6183721,56803797,2015-12-18,28678885,John,Tina's spot is great. Easy to get in. Clean. Comfy. Fast WiFi. All amenities as advertised. This is the second time I've stayed there and I'll stay again.
6183721,57010177,2015-12-21,43858925,Louis,"The location was great, we we able to walk to all of the local shops within several minutes, as well as the waterfront path along the canal. The accommodations were adequately furnished, and we were able to entertain another couple for dinner, without feeling crowded. Tina was more than accommodating, and addressed our needs as well as she could. It was nice having the ability to cook our own food and for our 5yo to have her own space. I would definitely stay here again. The only real downside is the right quarters for parking. While there is a dedicated parking space, trying to get into it with a larger vehicle could be a challenge."
7480196,41036006,2015-08-03,33945540,Simon,"Stay here  if you can!  A flawless ""midcentury modern"" renovation of a pretty house on a dead-end street, with fabulous deck with sunset and downtown Seattle skyline views, make this the perfect retreat.  The house is immaculate and newly and tastefully equipped with everything that you need.   Perfectly located halfway between the airport and downtown, and only minutes from the Interstate, the house is nevertheless completely peaceful. Sandy is friendly and helpful. 5 stars! We'll be back! "
7480196,42047052,2015-08-10,33425947,Aleksei,"Я не очень умею писать отзывы, но первое что я сделал, когда зашел в дом, это написал Sandy, что дом великолепен!!!
С Sandy я не встречался, так как он живет в другом городе, но вся его помощь на расстоянии была организована очень хорошо. Очень хороший, тихий и спокойный район. Рядом озеро, несколько парков, в пешеходной доступности магазины и кафе. До центра города 20-25 мин на машине, очень много вариантов выезда. Мне очень понравилось. У дома свободно можно припарковать машину. Сам дом совсем новый, вся мебель, постельное белье, полотенца, посуда, техника-все в идеальном состоянии. Очень комфортно расположены комнаты, хорошая терраса со столом для еды с видом на центр. Нам все очень понравилось, спасибо Sandy!"
7480196,42977842,2015-08-16,40964803,Sidney,This was our first ever Airbnb reservation and Sandy was lovely to work with. Answered all of our questions right away and even helped us fix our booking good-up. This house was lovely and I'm so glad we stayed there. 
7480196,43417628,2015-08-19,12487811,Alphonso,"Great new home, wonderful space and value.  

Thank you for coordinating and we look forward to staying again. "
7480196,44059400,2015-08-23,23371470,宇舟,这次在西雅图住Sandy的房子是一次很棒的体验！房子很新，很干净，在阳台上就能远远欣赏西雅图的夜景；房子位置也很好，我们用uber坐车去派克市场也就十几元；sandy的团队也很专业，所有指引都很详细，下次来还住这里。
7480196,48745444,2015-09-28,42734094,Le,"The house is convenient to public transportation and is located on a very quiet neighborhood. We arrived to a very cleaned house with modern kitchen appliances and furniture. I appreciate a fully packed supply closet which includes daily necessities like paper towel, soap, towels, etc. I would definitely stay here again!  "
7480196,53571031,2015-11-09,44836046,Qin,Nice experience.Clean and queit place to stay.Pity that it was rainy during our stay so we didnt see the sunrise next day.Hopefully next time we could see that from the house.
6445741,40005524,2015-07-27,14014451,Annie,Great apartment and host (see my other post for more detail)!
6445741,40404554,2015-07-30,14014451,Annie,"Katelyn's apartment was great! Plenty of space for my mom and I, awesome neighborhood -- easy to get around Capitol Hill. Katelyn was pretty hands-off but helped with everything we needed, and was really accommodating to let us extend our stay a few days! It was my mom's first experience with Airbnb, and she was very impressed. "
7389248,39130244,2015-07-20,2845500,Tran,"We had a blast at Michelle and Mark's home! The place is in one of the hottest neighborhoods in Seattle - Ballard. It is a short walk from all the action, but just far away enough where the street noise of bars can't be heard. The home is indeed luxurious with tastefully decorated furnishings throughout, and guests have everything they need to make themselves comfortable. The home also has an amazing rooftop deck with views of the water that cannot be beat. Although we love exploring all that Seattle has to offer, we found ourselves very much happy to spend time at the property and soak in its comforts and views throughout. The couple was also very communicative and easy to coordinate with. As an Airbnb traveler and host, I would not hesitate to come stay at their home again. Thanks Michelle and Mark for opening your home to us!"
7389248,43266653,2015-08-18,3900974,Amir,A beautiful home to stay in. Love the roof on a warm night. Host is wonderful to work with. Responded quickly to all my questions. 
7389248,49903537,2015-10-07,13925451,Brent,"I stayed here with my wife and parents over a long weekend trip to the Seattle area. The house was beautiful, as advertised and worked perfectly for the four of us. The house is walking distance to downtown Ballard and the Locks and it only takes 15ish minutes to get into downtown Seattle by car. The location was nice for us in that it was a quiet, peaceful setting on the water in Ballard but still conveniently central in greater Seattle. The rooftop deck overlooking Salmon Bay was everyone's favorite feature for enjoying a morning coffee or meal with drinks. Great place!"
7680439,42343042,2015-08-12,40527907,Alisha,"Although I didn't personally meet Andrea during my stay due to her work hours, I did get to exchange a few messages with her and she seems to be a very friendly person. I did get to meet her boyfriend, David, who was an awesome host and very accommodating during my stay there. He gave a tour of the house and recommended great places around the area to go to. Andrea had everything prepared for my guest and I (a sweet note, towels and extra toiletries). The room which was located on the basement floor was cozy and the bed was super comfortable, definitely got a good night sleep. Both Andrea and her bf made my guest and I feel right at home. They gave us the space and privacy we needed, but at the same time seem very personable and approachable. Ballard was a great neighborhood to stay at (plenty of restaurants, bars, little shops) and not too far from downtown Seattle. I very much enjoyed my stay at Andrea's place and would definitely recommend it! :)"
7680439,42609035,2015-08-14,40529864,Mark,"Andrea and David were amazing hosts. Communication was very open and easy. They let us know that they will interact act as much or as little per our discretion. So it being our first time in Washington, we asked for tons of suggestions of what to do, very very helpful and tons of great suggestions be it night life, sight seeing, food, breweries, public transit, etc. 
      The home is cozy, but very lovely and clean. Our room was the basement, which my girlfriend and I loved, as having our own space made us really feel at home. The temp. in the room was always perfect, the bed was very comfortable, and there was a welcome basket for us with basic hygiene necessities, as well as an awesome welcome message from Andrea and David. The room has its own entrance, which is awesome because we never felt like we had to tip toe when coming in late. Their backyard/garden was very relaxing. The neighborhood was awesome! 10 minute walk from all types of amazing restaurants and bars!  The day of our departure, my girlfriend and I spent our last hour drinking coffee and chatting with the both of them. Such a lovely couple, truly enjoyed our stay and the whole experience, would definitely stay again.

7680439,51067534,2015-10-17,12236044,Bonnie,"She made me feel very welcome, so did David her boyfriend.  He made delicious coffee for me. Cute neighborhood-within walking distance of everything!"
7680439,51216842,2015-10-18,8591814,Anne,"Andrea and David were very nice and accommodating. The room was exactly as pictured. The dogs were friendly, but definitely barked a lot when we arrived (and the owners weren't home) and when we came and went.

We appreciated that there was ample street parking, too! Fun neighborhood with a bunch of cool things to check our within walking distance."
7680439,51895646,2015-10-25,40964749,Rebecca,"House was warm and cozy. Hosts were courteous, welcoming and made an extra effort to make sure I felt as ease in the common spaces. Basement room was warm, clean and very comfortable. Great neighborhood with plenty of shops and amenities within walking distance. Definitely plan to stay here again. "
7680439,53112336,2015-11-05,43205175,Chelsea,This was my first Airbnb experience and it could not have been more enjoyable. Andrea and David (and their friendly dog Baker!) made us feel so welcome as soon as we stepped in their adorable cottage. They also made amazing recommendations on things to do and places to eat! I highly  recommend this airbnb!
7680439,53336377,2015-11-08,21301243,Charis,"Andrea and David were very sweet and attentive! Nice apt, very warm and cozy. Sweet dog and amazing location! "

Very warm, welcoming and fun to talk to. He was great at helping us out in finding nearby places to check out. I wish we had had more than a day to spend here, but maybe next time! I would totally stay here again. Very homey, cute little house with some charm and quirk. Reasonably priced and comfortable. And their dog Baker is just a little love!! What a cutie. I definitely recommend staying here :)"
7680439,54128064,2015-11-16,4140425,Susannah,"Perfectly situated a few blocks from everything in Ballard this room was absolutely what we needed on this vacation. As a guest you get a great amount of privacy as the room is on a completely different floor from everything else. Andrea and David are great hosts; they lay out food and coffee for you in the morning and they give the best advise on what to do in Ballard. We had a great time, loved the room, couldn't have asked for a better location in Ballard and would return anytime they will have us."
7680439,54318023,2015-11-18,1820800,Adriane,My boyfriend and I loved staying with Andrea and David. The house was very clean and cute. Hosts provided lovely homemade scones and other breakfast goods as well as toiletries and great recommendations. We would absolutely stay with them again.
7680439,56242262,2015-12-11,29544250,Jennifer,"Andrea, David and Baker provided such a welcoming and friendly environment while we transitioned between houses. They made sure we had everything we needed and were always available for questions and conversation when everyone was at the house.

Their home was cozy but the room is private and comfortable. We couldn't have asked for a better couple to stay with for the week! We were familiar with the area but for anyone new to Seattle or Ballard they have good suggestions for local things to do."
7680439,56678000,2015-12-16,49437949,Laleah,Description accurate! Cute cottage in a cool neighbourhood. Andrea and David were so friendly and helpful! Scones for breakfast and daily advice for where to go in the city and how to get there. Really great.
7680439,56989512,2015-12-20,9621067,David,"Andrea and David we're very welcoming. Both are engaged in timely environmental work. Quaint small home in the interesting hood of Ballard. The private getaway room in the basement provided the basic comforts and privacy, complete with Wi-fi, to make the stay enjoyable. Good luck to both of them."
3416217,15016191,2014-06-30,6675163,Vanessa,"Selma was a gracious and responsive host (fresh flowers & chocolate greet guests) and the apartment is quite comfortable, with lovely artwork all around. Also very central location in the city & the reserved parking spot was a major plus. I would definitely stay here again!"

3416217,16121627,2014-07-22,655588,Łukasz,"Selma's apartment was a great hidden spot, close to everything, a perfect place to unwind. She was a very gracious and helpful host, couldn't have asked for a better AirBnB experience overall!"
3416217,16919037,2014-08-04,17780782,Mary Kate,"My friend and I had a great time at Stella's apartment. It was charming, comfortable, and conveniently located for everything we wanted to do in Seattle. Stella was flexible with our check in time to accommodate the arrival of our flights, and her partner actually hung out to let us in, show us around and give us great food recommendations on the morning we arrived. Stella was also very responsive, checked in with me about arrival and departure, and even left a helpful note with chocolate to welcome us to her place! Overall, this was a great experience with a great host and if I'm ever in Seattle again, I'll definitely look into staying here again."

3416217,17575365,2014-08-14,8923743,Robert,Selma's place was fantastic.  The place is located in a nice quiet residential street but it is still very close to the action of downtown and nearby nightlife.  The unit was very welcoming and I felt like I was at home.  She is quick to respond to messages and was overall a great host.  Would stay again.

The apartment was great as well, spacious and comfortable, and in a very convenient location near Capitol Hill. "
3416217,20086188,2014-09-23,160857,Jess,Selma was very responsive and her place was just what we needed for our stay in Seattle. We could walk a few blocks to the Capitol Hill district and a traders joes is very close! Having the parking space was so great and her place was very cute and clean! 
3416217,21990840,2014-10-27,10393094,Aigerim Aika,"The experience was great. I stayed at the place for several nights with my mom. Selma is very responsive, replying to my messages within 10 minutes. Her house is cute and clean. All the basics we needed were provided, even local coffee. The  house is located on a quite block, about 25 minutes walking to downtown riverfront. Overall I am happy with the experience. "
3416217,22330639,2014-11-03,9924073,Erin,"Selma's place was absolutely amazing! My friend was in town from LA and this was the perfect location, it was centrally located yet tucked away for the times we just wanted some quiet from the city life. Her place was immaculate and she was super tentative yet respected our privacy. I highly recommend Selma's wonderful place next
Time you're in Seattle! "
3416217,23265885,2014-11-27,359171,Lindsey,"We booked Selma's place for my husband's parents to stay on their recent visit. They had a wonderful stay and specifically mentioned that the bed and shower were amazing. 

Selma was quick to respond to any questions and very easy to communicate with."

3416217,28473313,2015-03-24,22824474,Aaron,"Recently stayed at Sweet Retreat while visiting my daughter at SU.  Selma made the arrangement to get situated very easy. The place is very nice, clean and comfortable. The onsite parking was so nice. We regularly walked the short trip to Trader Joe's and this location was perfect. Would/ will stay here again. All the plants really brighten up a cloudy day. "

3416217,29927402,2015-04-14,1002110,Sameer,"My parents stayed at Selma's during their recent visit to Seattle. They have a great stay! Selma was very welcoming, communicative, and helpful. The building is charming with a nice front yard. The neighborhood is great - quiet, but just a block from a fantastic coffee shop (Tougo) and only a few blocks to the heart of Capitol Hill. The place itself was very cute and nicely decorated. It's cozy, but not too small. One note: The bed is a double, so it's quite a squeeze for two people. The parking space came in very handy. My parents would definitely stay at Selma's again!"
3416217,32199224,2015-05-15,2012556,Ada,We had a wonderful stay! Selma got everything we need in the house. The only problem we had is the toilet which sometimes the water just keep running. Other than that is very nice and cozy place to stay!

3416217,35303855,2015-06-17,18021572,Gena,"The flat was amazing and Selma gave us a way to get in early. We were cozy and took advantage of the kitchen, even though there were unlimited opportunities for fine and casual dining nearby (must say we visited Nue restaurant twice). The flat was quiet, private and well located, near our daughter's university. We had great wi-fi access and  a private entrance and parking. 
Selma's home was cozy and comfortable with a great ""vibe."" "
3416217,35644604,2015-06-21,29825357,Carol,"The Sweet Retreat is aptly named. I found the apartment to be perfectly suited to my needs -- with a comfortable bed and adequately stocked kitchen. The neighborhood is quiet but close to shops, food stores and public transportation. 

Selma was responsive to my emails and answered my questions promptly. We only communicated through emails, but that was fine."
3416217,39006130,2015-07-20,16611973,Ann,"Despite arriving later in the evening, we had no trouble finding this cute place thanks to excellent directions. We immediately felt at home with welcoming flowers and chocolate!, walked to the nearby natural foods co-op for some supplies, and enjoyed tea and coffee at the nearby local coffee place in the mornings. It was the perfect base for us to explore the area and we could walk to so many places we wanted to visit. The parking space and internet were icing on the cake. Everything we needed was here, and Selma was the best hostess, immediately replying to messages every time. We will stay again next time we visit Seattle!"

3416217,41754687,2015-08-09,18933077,David,"Great apartment in a quiet, but convenient, location. We walked to the Bainbridge Ferry terminal one morning, right through the city centre, and it only took 30 minutes. 

Although we didn't meet Selma, she was always available online or on the phone, and was extremely helpful. 

The bed was amazingly comfy and I'd definitely use this place again. Thanks!"
3416217,42827308,2015-08-16,5760948,Sarah,Selma's place was cozy and in a great location near Capitol Hill. We enjoyed our stay.
3416217,43767301,2015-08-22,14021475,Daniel,"Selma welcomed us with a bouquet and chocolates from Seattle. I loved the location, which was close to a ton of great restaurants and bars. We had a car and used the parking space, but we didn't need to use it much because most everything we wanted to do was in walking distance. Selma seems cool and was very responsive, though we didn't meet her in person. She left us coffee, but I recommend going to the coffee shop around the corner."
3416217,46301659,2015-09-09,1390907,Paul,"We had a great time at Selma's. We never met Selma, however her communication was excellent. Arriving and getting inside was simple. The place was immaculately clean, and very nicely laid out and decorated. The location was great too, two minutes from an excellent coffee shop, and a 5-10 minute walk to many many, bars cafes etc. A bus that goes downtown was right on the corner. Definitely recommend."
2691273,15180502,2014-07-04,15665579,Richard,"Great stay in Seattle. Sean was a fantastic host, sorted out any queries I had and basically couldn't do enough to make my stay as good as possible. Very accessible and responded to questions very quickly. This is 'old school' Airbnb, this is actually Sean's home and he can't do enough to make you comfortable there. 
The apartment is in a great spot in Belltown. Easy walk up or down 2nd Ave to either the Seattle Centre (Space Needle etc) or Downtown (Pike Place etc). Belltown itself is great, lots of bars and restaurants nearby. All essentials can be picked up at the Belltown market which is on the same block as the apartment.
The apartment itself is great for one or two people, not massive but plenty big enough, great wifi, loved the tea maker.
A couple of things that Sean could probably make more of on his listing - there's a great little balcony, it's on the 7th floor and although the view is of the courtyard and not beyond it's cool to be able to sit outside with a morning coffee or an evening glass of wine in the fresh air. The other is the gym and pool, although small there's a reasonable amount of kit in the gym and the pool is great for a refreshing swim after a long day. Neither of these get especially busy.
Overall a top spot, should be high up on your list of options if you want or need to be in Seattle for more than a couple of days.

Thanks Sean!"
2691273,15421033,2014-07-08,17021632,Amy,My friends and I had a great time in Seattle and staying here.  Best part of the place was probably the bed!  Can't beat a great memory foam mattress!
2691273,16080704,2014-07-22,14550431,Spencer,"Really enjoyed my stay! I was out and about for large amounts of my trip,  but the location was super convenient relative to everywhere I needed to be. Comfortable bed and furniture, well equipped kitchen, and fast internet meant that it was everything I needed. Sean was a great host, happy to help with any issues I encountered. Would definitely stay here again if I found myself out in Seattle for any length of time!"
2691273,18054423,2014-08-21,14497804,Bob,"Really enjoyed the apt, and the location. Many wonderful restaurants and lots to do in walking distance. Had all we needed and was very cozy. would stay again. "
2691273,18430932,2014-08-26,3098109,Lisa,"Awesome location, and parking is super convenient.  A bit pricey for what you get though.  Sean was always responsive but a little disorganized (didn't have parking pass available until the second day, only gave us one pillow for two people, no details in the apartment about internet etc).  Had a great stay but may opt for somewhere else next time."
2691273,19478037,2014-09-13,4411072,Bryan,"Sean's place is in a great location. It's a nice walk to both Pike Place Market and the Space Needle/Chihuly Gardens/EMP Museum. The in unit washer and dryer were very convenient, and the bed was very comfortable (it vibrates!!). The pool was also as nice amenity, and the fitness center had a great variety of both cardio and strength training equipment. There's also a Sonos system with speakers throughout the apartment. 

Sean was easy to get a hold of and very responsive. I would stay here again!"
2691273,35311964,2015-06-17,17774799,Michaela,We had a great stay here! Sean's place is in the perfect location and is central to all of the main attractions. We walked almost everywhere. All of the upgrades to the apartment are really nice and the kitchen let us keep some food there for the mornings so we didn't have to eat every meal out. That made it much cozier than a regular hotel room. This was our first AirBNB experience and we were thoroughly satisfied! 
2691273,46282040,2015-09-09,24714352,David,"We had a great time staying in Seattle at Sean's Apartment.  There are great restaurants and bars close by, and Pike Place and the Space Needle are within a 10 minute walk.  The garage access made it easy for our local friends to visit and explore the city.  I would stay here again."
2691273,50491425,2015-10-12,14077828,Allen,"Sean is a cool guy, he was more than accommodating and helped with suggestions for this first time visitor. His apartment is situated in an ideal location. Theres so much to do within walking distance from his home. I would definitely stay there again! Thanks for everything Sean."
2515795,17552813,2014-08-14,13305764,Jenny,"My husband and I lived here with our two year-old daughter for several months between selling our Seattle home and moving to New York City. It was very easy for this house to feel like home. In addition to having absolutely every amenity your family might ever want -- a sandbox and slide for your toddler to play in in a safe, enclosed yard; a grill; a lovely, shaded and enclosed patio; comfortable bedrooms; a separate den for watching television; and every baking tool you could imagine -- Sarah and her husband were amazing landlords. In mid-summer they came home to spruce up the yard to make it even more appealing for us to spend time in. And Sarah was always a text message away when I couldn't find egg beaters, a dust buster, or had a question about a local restaurant.

The neighborhood is also charming. Bedrooms boast sunrise views of Lake Washington, the Cascade mountains, and Seattle's sister city, Bellevue. All of the neighbors were very friendly. Living here in summer we spent every weekend morning at Leschi and Mt. Baker Beaches, just minutes away. These spots were also lovely in the rain. Two blocks south is a charming bakery and French and Italian restaurants.

I can't recommend this home enough for a short or extended stay. "
2515795,18708606,2014-08-31,12761083,Peter,"We stayed for 10 days in Sarah's lovely home and it housed my wife and I, our two young boys and my wife's parents very comfortably. The interior is stylish and extremely well-designed, the dining area is perfect for families, and the location is absolutely ideal - 10 minutes east of downtown, right by the water, and with easy access to freeways for longer trips. The house was a perfect base of operations for exploring Seattle and was stocked with the odds and ends that a family needs for a stay, from laundry detergent to shower soaps/shampoos to every cooking spice and oil imaginable. We would definitely stay again. "
2515795,19264184,2014-09-09,13125533,Hillary,"My husband, 5 & 1.5 year olds, myself, and my parents stayed in Sarah's home for four nights while visiting my sister, who lives a couple of miles away.  The house was welcoming and the neighborhood is friendly and convenient to downtown and local parks.  The rooms are open, spacious and great for sitting and visiting.  There were lots of toys and books available to keep our children occupied.  We had a lovely stay and would consider coming again when we visit Seattle."
2515795,21805057,2014-10-24,17298841,Chris,"My colleague had stayed here a few times before, and I must say his recommendation was a great one!
The house is beautifully restored and a wonderful place to keep warm out of the Seattle rain. "
2515795,22160089,2014-10-31,17508463,Shannon,"Great place, really convenient location for our activities!"
2515795,22292909,2014-11-03,3874966,Risha,Sarah's house is stunning and she was a perfect host- very accommodating and made our arrival and stay seamlessly easy. It was also in a great location. Highly recommend. 
2515795,22682593,2014-11-11,19388904,Kent,"Perfect host. The house is in a great location and the inside is incredible - beauty art, nice furniture. We couldn't have picked a better place for our long weekend stay."
2515795,23213376,2014-11-25,2305531,Paul,Excellent AirB&B experience. The house is very clean and very well appointed.  We were very comfortable as a group of 5.  Everything you need in the kitchen to cook or bake.  Great decor and books to read.  Very responsive host.  
2515795,23497211,2014-12-02,9840603,Christi,"My family and I had such a lovely time staying at Sarah's place over Thanksgiving. The house is beautifully decorated and the views were unbelievable. The kitchen, main bathroom and bedrooms were cozy and incredibly functional. We wish we would have tried some of the restaurants just down the street as that little area looked charming but we did have a chance to explore Seward Park the morning after it snowed and it was just magical. The neighborhood and house itself was very quiet even though the house is located on a fairly busy street. In all, we loved it and were sad to leave.  "
2515795,25314887,2015-01-12,23618593,Colleen,"We were visiting seattle for a long weekend with my parents from Scotland. Sarah was a lovely host, really accommodating and helpful and was quick to respond by text when we had a question.

Although not much to look at from the outside, the interior of the house wAs lovely and exact as the images. The house was Tastefully decorated, warm and cosy with comfortable luxurious beds! We were very happy there.  The girls loved the little TV room which was handy for them, whilst my parents and I were happy catching up over dinner in the kitchen.  The house was very well equipped with fresh linen and kitchen utensils etc. We loved our stay there, it was convenient for my daily journey to the theater in Bellevue and our day trip to Seattle center.
We also enjoyed lunch and coffee at the local baker, very quaint and only 2mins down the road.

We would definitely recommend Sarah's lovely home and hope to stay again hopefully soon.

2515795,28413480,2015-03-23,28369581,Beth,"Tasteful décor inside, pretty views, spacious, good location – thank you.   "
2515795,29020027,2015-04-02,345565,Michaela,"We had a wonderful stay! It's particularly well-stocked for kiddos: toys, books, pack n' play, high chair, etc. Sarah even went out of her way to get us a few last-minute things. The house is beautifully decorated, cozy, clean, and the beds are comfy. The kitchen is well-stocked, and everything is on a use-it-and-replace-it honor system, which is very cool. The neighborhood is safe, but the alarm system made us feel extra secure. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
2515795,30310938,2015-04-20,12031765,Eric,"The house was great.   Everything in excellent condition and very stylish in nature.    It was perfect for our needs, location and extended length of stay.   Definitely a great grab."
2515795,33980983,2015-06-03,2277863,Laura,"My parents and siblings stayed at Sarah's home for several days over my wedding weekend. The home was lovely and quite spacious. The beds and linens were comfortable, the kitchen had everything they needed to make some great brunches and dinners, and relaxing on the patio out back was a treat. The home is thoughtfully designed to give truly incredible views from all three bedrooms and the living areas. It's an old house, so there are the normal creaks and sticks, but the unfinished outside and small flaws inside did not detract from their enjoyment of the house. They would stay here again, and I would definitely book Sarah's home for my family or other visitors again. Thank you, Sarah!"
2515795,35200622,2015-06-16,7041760,Monique,Sarah's home was perfect!  The website description is spot-on.  We were in town for my daughter's college graduation and it was great to have a home with full amenities for gathering and resting.  The home is very stylish and comfy.  The house is in a beautiful neighborhood with a nice walk to the lake.  I highly recommend Sarah's place.
2515795,35823918,2015-06-22,2989441,Dayna,"Sarah's home is lovely! It had everything we needed. The beds are so comfortable--definitely not sleepless in Seattle! I slept very well and was rested. It was a perfect stay. Public transportation is also easy. From SEATAC we took the light rail and one bus that drops off in front of the house. The house is 10 min from downtown. Lovely view of the lake. Thanks, Sarah for opening your home. So much better than a hotel. All the comforts of a quiet, beautiful home! "
2515795,37841777,2015-07-11,30552303,Evan,"My family spent a week at Sarah's house and had a very good experience.  The home was very convenient for us to visit Seattle as well as family in Bellevue.  It was very nicely furnished, especially as we had our two children with us and there were plenty of toys and books for them in the house, not to mention a small table with two kid-sized chairs in the kitchen that they could use.  Sarah was easily accessible when an unexpected issue arose.  The biggest downside was the lack of air conditioning, though Seattle was having record high temperatures while we were there and I would expect that it usually wouldn't be an issue."
2515795,42811899,2015-08-16,1569119,Dominic,"We are a family of 5 with children ranging from 5 to 12 and we stayed in Sarah’s house for 5 weeks over the summer.  Communication throughout was excellent and I really felt like Sarah cared that we had a good experience.  Regarding the accommodation:
 
Positives:  The location is absolutely excellent, on top of a hill with views down to Lake Washington one way and to the city centre and Puget Sound the other way.  In fact we loved to sit out on the back porch as the sun set over the downtown sky scrapers.  The weather was magnificent while we were there, and Lake Washington is scattered with lovely little very well managed beaches which the kids swam at the whole summer; Mount Baker Beach is a (fair) walk from the house as is Leschi Park but both manageable. Also there is a lovely Italian restaurant just up the road and a very nice but expensive market at the bottom of the hill on Lake Washington. The number 14 bus literally stops outside the front door and gets you to the centre of Seattle in about 20 minutes.  Inside the house has everything, the kitchen is really well equipped and nice to cook in, the shower is powerful and the TV room is cosy. The beds were very comfortable, even the inflatable which our youngest slept on.  
 
Could be better:  when we were there it was very warm and there is no aircon – this is normal considering Seattle's climate though but it meant that we had to have the windows open at night and the road is noisy.  The bus stop is right outside (see above) which added to this - it woke us up a few times.  Really the road is not tremendously busy, but if you are a light sleeper I would consider earplugs.  Additionally the first impression of the house from the outside is not too good at the time of writing – you need not worry though as inside is just lovely.  
 
Overall we had a wonderful stay there and would totally recommend Sarah and the house."
2515795,44108989,2015-08-24,28416907,Robert,"Great spot.  Definitely recommend staying here.  Spacious, clean, and in a great neighborhood."
2515795,51691362,2015-10-24,6858654,Nick,"Our family of four (two adults, one toddler and a baby) had the pleasure of staying at Sarah's home for two months. It was an absolute pleasure; we didn't want to leave! The home is very well appointed and is not your typical Airbnb rental. It is clear that this is a Sarah's home and she is very proud of it. The decor is exactly as you see in the pictures, no trick photography here, and when you arrive it shows even better than it is represented online. The kitchen is very well stocked with every amenity you would find in your own home, not simply the bare minimums sometimes found in rental only properties. The beds and linens in all rooms were very comfortable. Fixtures, lighting, art and furniture and decor are very nice. She has excellent taste and everything comes together wonderfully. The home is fantastic if you have children. Everything you could possibly need; high chair, crib, toys, and a great selection of books. My son found a few new favorites that he could recite back to us by the end of our stay. He especially liked eating meals at the little kids table in the kitchen. The TV room was a nice quiet place to wind down in the evenings after the kids were asleep without the worry of waking the kids. The views are amazing. As is sits at the very top of a ridge you have gorgeous views upstairs of Lake Washington and Bellevue to the east, and peekaboo views of downtown Seattle to the West. The location of the home is perfect. My wife was working during our stay and had travel all around Seattle, Bellevue, and Kirkland. The house seemed to be no more than 15 to 20 minutes from everywhere, extremely convenient. Downtown and the market is 10 minutes. Public transportation is literally in front of the house and is very reliable and safe. Buses are electric, not nearly as loud as traditional buses, and the noise didn't bother us at all. The neighborhood was fantastic as well. We really enjoyed being able to take a short stroll down the street in the morning for coffee at QED, as well as excellent pastries and breakfast sandwiches at Repast. In the evenings dinner at That's Amore and the brand new (and excellent!) Heyday were convenient. Both were very kid friendly and the patrons were kind and friendly. All in all we had an amazing stay. If we had it to do again we wouldn't change a thing. 
Kudos and thank you Sarah, you should be very proud of your home!"
2515795,54038913,2015-11-15,23006719,Sarat,We had a comfortable 3 day stay with 4 adults and 2 kids. Home was well maintained and clean.Very close to downtown and easily accessible with bus stop at door step.  
2515795,55563492,2015-12-02,42468661,Don,Janice made us feel very welcome and her description of the house was very accurate and the position of her property was great. We enjoyed staying at the house very much and would return again .
6166307,32198529,2015-05-15,11278939,Elisabeth,"First thought that came to my mind when I walked in to the apartment was, ""Wow, this place is gorgeous!"" It was exactly as described and shown in the pictures, very clean, modern, and comfortable. The TV was amazing...I used the Roku to watch Hulu as well as HBO Go while relaxing in bed at night. The bed is so comfortable...the sheets were soft and the comforter had a nice weight and feel to it. The apartment is filled with light thanks to the huge windows that were almost floor to ceiling while at the same time providing a lot of privacy. The curtains blacked out the bedroom light nicely so I could easily sleep in. This place came with all the amenities one would want or need: washer/dryer, dishwasher, tv with roku and HBO, keyless entry system. I absolutely loved the Greenwood neighborhood, often waking to Greenwood Ave and to the Phinney Ridge neighborhood where I found amazing local bookstores, restaurants, reflexology, vintage shops, and a library. Lastly, the owners were so nice, checking in with me via text and always were available if there was anything I needed. I can't say enough positive things about this place...I loved it! Perfect Airbnb experience. I use Airbnb everywhere I travel, and this place is in my top favorite places to stay now. I felt very at home here and wish I could stay for a longer time, but would love to stay here again in the future! :) "
6166307,32725430,2015-05-20,33320279,Arwin,"If you want to get up fresh in the morning with the sunlight, this is the place for you. The modern home is bright with natural light and is well stocked for your every need. What's even better is that there is convenient parking in the safe neighborhood close to the city! Bernard is a very kind and welcoming host and always makes himself available for you. It was a wonderful experience for us, and we'll definitely return when we visit Seattle. "
6166307,33300908,2015-05-26,32999199,Gaby,"The space was awesome! It was very clean, comfortable, and airy. Natural light flooded the apartment through huge windows, all day. I felt very much at home. The bathroom was spacious and sleek. Having access to Roku was a plus, we mainly used pandora to just stream background tunes. The neighborhood was quiet and very walkable. I would definitely love to stay here again!"
6166307,34651295,2015-06-10,3285744,Ashley,"Such a fantastic stay! Bernie and Stef were nothing but hospitiable and friendly. The apartment is nice and cozy, with just what I needed and some cool shops just around the corner. I would come back in a heartbeat "
6166307,35308324,2015-06-17,1136583,Sean,"What a great place to stay! The apartment was clean and relaxing, a great place to return to after being in the city all day. The apartment is close to two of the RapidRide routes that run to the northern neighborhoods and provided great, quick access to most of the city. Both Bernard and Stefanie were very warm and welcoming and willing to point out great local spots. Next time I'm in town I will definitely be booking the apartment again."
6166307,35667441,2015-06-21,32626717,Kay,"With the great pictures and description of the apartment, we were pleased that the space was even better than we expected. Our hosts seemed to think of everything--tea, coffee, nightlights, Internet access, and privacy.  They checked to see if we needed anything and responded immediately.  This was our first airbnb experience, and we'd like to take advance of our host's hospitality again. We totally enjoyed being close to Golden Gardens Park and the coffee houses and fun places to eat on Greenwood Avenue."
6166307,38132818,2015-07-13,10506538,Kelvin,"This was a wonderful apartment and was exactly as described in the listing.  It was beautiful and sleek.  Concrete floors, well appointed countertops and subway tiling in the bathroom.  We stayed with 2 adults and 2 toddlers which is the max number of people I would recommend staying in the space.  The couch folded out into a queen size bed which our daughters slept on comfortably every night.  Bernie and his wife Stef were wonderful and friendly hosts who helped accommodate our needs.   And Stef was a wonderful and talented masseuse as well.  That is also highly recommended.  The location was within 15 min drive of most everywhere in Seattle.  Anytime we visit Seattle, we will come back to this listing."
6166307,38524783,2015-07-16,19811692,Kirsten,Bernard was a great host and gave us great ideas on the best places to bike and his favorite restaurants in the area. The neighborhood was in a very convenient location with easy access to the surrounding neighborhoods. Bernard thought of everything one would need in the apartment right down to the french press. We would definitely recommend this space and hope to return soon.  
6166307,41632334,2015-08-08,9912234,Brian,"Bernard's place was fantastic!  Right away we felt welcome, with snacks, filtered water, and a clean private space.  The bed was comfortable and the fold out couch was very convenient.  The area is close to Ballard and within walking distance of coffee shops, grocery stores and restaurants, while still being far enough away to be quiet.

Highly recommended and I'd stay here again if I'm in the area."
6166307,42120834,2015-08-11,29406723,Shannon,The listing/pictures are very accurate. This space is sleek and modern and very comfortable. We spent two nights here after our wedding and it was exactly the quiet/peaceful place we were hoping for. We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Seattle.
6166307,43496213,2015-08-20,35804397,Marci,"We had a fantastic time staying in Seattle.  The apartment is great.  Slept two adults and a kid comfortably and easily could have fit another on the pull out couch.  All super new and modern.  Ping pong table out back was a hit.   I only wish I had had time to get a massage!  

Being slightly out of Seattle center was nice and we got to see some other neighborhoods, but super easy to get to town and back.  

I would highly recommend staying here on your next visit and we will definitely return."
6166307,44064516,2015-08-23,26937638,Mineko,"We reserved this place at the last minute due to change in travel plans.  Bernie responded within minutes and stayed in communication during our visit.  

The apartment was brand new, clean and decorated with style.  Everything worked.  We appreciated that it was roomy because we have a very active toddler.

The house is in a quiet residential neighborhood.  It's not hip and trendy like Ballard, Green Lake or Fremont, but is conveniently located so all of the places mentioned above are within a short drive.  There is a big park with a playground and a very nice independent toy store ( ""Too Ten Toys) within walking distance.  My husband enjoyed checking out the craft beer store (over 1000 kinds!) steps away from the place. 


"
6166307,45265178,2015-09-01,1222512,Brian,"This apartment was everything it was stated as being.  Clean, stylish, new and with easy access.  All the modern amenities you would expect with a super comfortable bed.  

The host communicated frequently and made sure I was comfortable.  

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking at staying in this neighborhood.  The fact that it is 4 blocks away from Chuck's Hop Shop seals the deal.  "
6166307,45537425,2015-09-03,1777044,Tode,Bernard was delightful in making us feel welcome. His place is immaculate and well appointed. Very comfortable. A lot of attention to detail. I hope to stay again when I visit Seattle next. 
6166307,47836535,2015-09-21,1136073,Joel,Welcoming and cheerful apartment.  Everything we needed for a great stay.
6166307,48469701,2015-09-26,44695599,Jen,"Description says it: modern, green, sleek -- a stylish, clean and well-appointed base for a Seattle visit. Two friends had plenty of room for a 3-night stay, with both the bed and the pull-out sofa comfortable. Lovely, quiet neighborhood, walking distance to tasty coffee/breakfast. Furnishings: plenty of clean, high-quality linens; all you need in the kitchen; and even robes hanging in the bath. Tech perks: wifi, laptop, plus Netflix & Amazon on great TV. Hosts had the lights on for our late arrival, and they even included helpful guidelines to help comply with Seattle's green trash policies! Easy to connect with for entry and during stay. We're definitely recommending to others. Thanks so much! "
6166307,49855008,2015-10-06,27129043,Pervin,"Bernie and Stef's place was just as clean and beautiful as shown on the site.  They were able to accommodate us last min.  Stef greeted us upon arrival and we met Bernie on a later day.  Both very sweet and answered our texts promptly and made us feel comfortable and welcomed...
The bed and pull out sofa were firm, (as I preferred) pillows soft, and the blankets super comfy and plentiful.  The neighborhood was quiet and street parking was never an issue.  We recommend a car rental if you want to see more of Seattle's different neighborhoods.  We loved the going green concept incorporated in the living space! 
The only issue we encountered (but did not mention during our stay secondary to this not being an issue that could have been ""fixed"") was that the walls were thin and we could hear every footstep and object being moved for ex.  Unfortunately we are light/med sleepers and were not able to sleep past ~ 7:30am esp over the weekend....however, if you are a deep sleeper, than this would not be an issue and we definitely recommend this place!
We had a great time and our only regret is that our schedules did not allow us to book a massage with Stef despite her open availability....next time hopefully!
Thank you Stef and Bernie for sharing part of your home with us :)"
6166307,52961028,2015-11-03,2874015,Charlie,"This is a great base if you want to stay near the Ballard/Fremont area. Just bear in mind that it's hard to sleep in late because the family lives upstairs, and they're up early walking above your head—not too bad on the weekend but 6am on Monday. Bed is fairly comfortable, and the sitting area is spacious for hanging out and getting ready. Nice, quiet residential street. "
6166307,54532065,2015-11-21,1664730,Dave,"This is an easy experience from start to finish. The hosts don't even have to meet you so you can let yourself in when you're ready to check in. The accommodations are great for short or long extended stays. Ideal for a couple or a small family with 1 or 2 young children as well. The furnishings and amenities will give you flexibility of options to stay in or head out. The location is super convenient, with a large grocery store, a beer shop w/food trucks out front every day, restaurant options and a gas station a few blocks away. It's almost like staying in an Aloft hotel but BETTER. Hosts were great and helpful & responsive. A great place for a home away from home."
6166307,56370905,2015-12-13,43543685,Karen,"This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was very nice.  The place was comfortable, homey and had some lovely touches to make the stay enjoyable.  I picked the location primarily because  it is just down the street from my daughter and grandchildren, but I am sure glad I did.  "
6166307,57184127,2015-12-22,51590190,Jun,"Overall, the trip was very good. Nice new building below the owner's living space. Very quiet neighborhood, didn't have trouble parking. 
All the amenities were more that what we needed: basics such as soap, shampoo, body wash, towels, kitchen utensils (plates, cups, knives, etc) TV, laptop, wifi, etc. 

There was a loud construction on one of the morning that we were never told about. 

overall it was a great trip.

Right around the corner from great bars, restaurants, coffee houses and markets. The roof deck is real spacious and with an unbelievable view of the space needle. We are definitely coming back and reccomending to family and friends. Thanks Kevin."
3992155,21237906,2014-10-13,6426198,Stefan,"My Fiance and I had a great time staying at Kevin's place.  The walk to main seattle attractions is very quick, and there are great places to get coffee and whatnot nearby.  Kevin was very friendly, and provided all the necessities, as well as some nice extras like coffee for our use.  The roof of Kevin's building is a great place to spend the evening, if you don't feel like going out.  We would definitely stay with Kevin again."
3992155,22609251,2014-11-10,17615688,Isaac,Fantastic location! Kevin was extremely friendly and helpful. Excellent communication. The studio was a perfect place to crash for the weekend. Would stay again :)
3992155,22877211,2014-11-16,13123726,Alex,"My first experience with Airbnb, Kevin is a very good person and the apartment very comfortable, close than Space Noodle and Pike Place Market and just across the street there a supermarket."
3992155,24552569,2014-12-30,6658273,Joe,Kevin was a great host and waited at a nearby bar until we arrived. He was great at showing us how to get into the building and even provided parking. The location is great for walking to Pike Place Market.
3992155,24897460,2015-01-03,12367818,April,"What a great apartment! My boyfriend and I didn't spend too much time in the apartment because we were out exploring the kitchen, which this place is perfect for because of its stellar location. Everything was clean, comfortable, and there were no difficulties surrounding the apartment. Would definitely recommend and stay again. Thanks for the hospitality!!"
3992155,25318065,2015-01-12,11748378,Amanda,"Kevin's place was exceptional! Just cozy enough for two. The location was the prime, walkable to almost everywhere. My friend and I walked to Pike's, Pioneer Square, the shopping center. The bus is around the corner and easy to use. "
3992155,25468854,2015-01-17,137044,Karen,"This is a fabulous location in the heart of Belltown....an easy walk to Pike Place and the centre of downtown.  Even tho it is next to the monorail (which was kinda fun), it is very quiet, safe and close to great restaurants (the Black Bottle is amazing). Kevin was great to work with...providing clear instructions and quick responses.  Thanks Kevin - we hope to be back soon!"
3992155,27201191,2015-02-28,2118468,Evgeniy,"My wife and I spent about a month and half at this apartment. For two people this place can be a bit small if you plan to stay that long. Parking can also be a little tricky. However, that's probably the only drawbacks that I can think of. Other than that, it's a great apartment in excellent condition and in a great neighborhood - there are a lot of nice cafes (La Parisienne is by far our favorite there :)) and restaurants around within few minutes walk, Space Needle is about 10-15 minutes walk, the center (with Pike Market) is about 30 minutes walk, or you can go by the monorail which has a station just near Space Needle. By the way, the monorail is really few meters away from the window, but it goes so silently that you won't ever notice it unless you are looking into the window and waiting for it :) Kevin promptly responded to all our questions and requests.
Overall, it was a great experience to live there, and if you plan to stay in Seattle for few days or even weeks I would highly recommend this place."
3992155,27780844,2015-03-11,27474885,Bly,Kevin was completely accommodating to our late arrival and all our needs.  The studio is in an excellent location - great walkability all over the city.  The place is quiet and clean.
3992155,28674128,2015-03-28,29396322,Jolene,"Kevin was a very gracious host and was consistently going out of his way to ensure that we were settled in and had all the information and accomadations that we could have possibly needed. The location was very accessible and central to all the major downtown attractions but still remained very quiet and peaceful. The studio was clean, comfortable and well stocked. It was a pleasant stay altogether."
3992155,29105228,2015-04-04,27014311,Timothy,"Had a wonderful time, the perfect location,  Kevin provided us with very detailed information on everything we needed.   We rented a car but hardly used it because we were so close to everything.  I will be recommending this place to friends coming to Seattle soon."
3992155,30198266,2015-04-19,137044,Karen,Fabulous (email hidden)d condo.  This is our second visit...and we hope to return again soon.  Kevin is a great host!
3992155,30813596,2015-04-27,18119807,Sees,"Kevin was very detailed in making sure that we have everything we needed. Very responsive to my emails!  The place was a great location, very accessible to all the good spots, such as Space Needle, local bakeries and cafes! We had everything we needed In terms of toiletries. There was even a gym and a parking spot for our rental car! The tram is right next to the place but it's super quiet, so not disturbing at all! Thanks Kevin!"
3992155,31141837,2015-05-02,29412933,Dustin,"Was able to meet Kevin during check in - very friendly and knowledgable about the area.  He provided good advice on travelling around within the city and allowed us to follow up regarding any question we may have had.  The listing description was accurate;  condo was cosy, clean and located in close proximity to many tourist attractions and places to eat.  The neighbourhood was lively and busy - which made me feel safe."
3992155,31949206,2015-05-12,27942644,Grant,"Kevin's condo was absolutely perfect. For someone that wasn't from Seattle or familiar with Seattle, it was in a great location. Everything and I do mean everything was within a 20 minute walk. We were able to do all the things that were ""quintessentially Seattle"" and did not need a rental car at all.  He left us coffee for the mornings and even some ice cream in the freezer. (Ben & Jerry's half baked, bonus points)

Also, we forgot to pack a usb plug. (the plug that goes into the wall to charge phones) Bonnie, the building manager was more than happy to let us borrow one for the duration of our stay, a true lifesaver!"
3992155,32636381,2015-05-19,33161400,Whitney,"Kevin was a great host, he sent all the information that was needed a few days prior to the day of our arrival, met us by a nearby cafe to give us the keys and everything.
The place was great! It was clean, tea and coffee were out and ready for us if we wanted, clean sheets and towels were all in the laundry room. The location of this place was just perfect for us to walk everywhere and not worry about driving the car around, even though the place was across from the monorail; it was pretty quiet.
Overall, my boyfriend and I had a great stay and wished we could of stayed longer. Thanks so much, Kevin! "
3992155,33584133,2015-05-30,15304991,Scott,"Kevin was super easy to work with, reaching out to us to setup key drop and meeting us with no issues. 

The apartment is a small studio in a safe building with a nice little terrace. You are right at monorail height, but the monorail is fairly quiet and did not bother us. It's adequately furnished, with a pullout bed from the couch (feels exactly how you expect it to feel when you are on it), fast internet, and decent budget A/V equipment. Located in Belltown, there's plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance (though we found ourselves heading to Capitol Hill for serious nightlife). 

The best thing about the place is the location. We walked to Capitol Hill a couple times as well as Queen Anne. The Space Needle, Bell Harbor Convention Center, and Pike Place are all within 15 minutes walk.  

Light-sensitive sleepers take note - the blackout shades do not cover the full sliding glass door, and at those northern latitudes the days start at around 430/5 AM. I was up  by 515 everyday there. If you are light sensitive, do not plan on sleeping in without a mask in the summer months. 

"
3992155,34002942,2015-06-03,32069912,Brian,"This was a beautiful space in a great location. My husband and I were looking for apartments in the city for our move next month, and this was a perfect central location for easy access to many different neighborhoods. The apartment is very clean but also very comfortable, without the odd sterility of some hotel rooms. 

Like most apartments in Seattle, there is no air conditioning, so we were a little warm at times, but simply opening the glass door onto the balcony let in a very refreshing breeze. The street noise outside when the balcony door is open adds nice ambiance but nothing overly loud or distracting. 

Overall, we were extremely impressed with this experience (our first time using airbnb). We definitely recommend! "
3992155,34200521,2015-06-06,27349724,Kyler,Kevin is a great host! He let us check in early since our flight arrived in the morning. The location in Belltown is perfect for walking all around Seattle. There is a grocery store right across the street and a washer dryer in the apartment. The fold out couch isn't too bad for short stays. This is a great spot to stay in Seattle :)
3992155,34542708,2015-06-09,32095187,Lauren,"this apartment is in a prime location of seattle - it's very easy to get around to all the top spots! kevin was a good host - he is responsive to messages, and that was helpful. the pull out couch is more comfortable than you might expect. there is a parking spot, but it is very tight, so you would be safer if you rent a compact car! the apartment does get warm at night - a fan is provided, but there is no AC!. that being said, i would recommend staying in this location."
3992155,34939116,2015-06-14,3474324,Shelley & John,"Our stay at Kevin's place in Seattle was great.  Although the apartment itself is small, the location is fantastic.  Lots to do right in the neighborhood, and walking distance to the Space Needle, Pike's Place, and more.  And the rooftop was amazing!!!! Would pick this place again just for that-- fantastic views and so relaxing to just hang out. Kevin's communication was great and our check in went smoothly.  

Only complaint is the bed is quite uncomfortable, but that was minor compared to everything else. "
3992155,35321576,2015-06-17,34012149,Melia,"Loved staying here, and will definitely stay again when I visit Seattle in the future!  Kevin was very welcoming and helpful; when my friend was delayed and I had to navigate Seattle's public transport myself, he texted directions.  
The apartment is perfect.  The pull out bed is extremely comfortable.  The neighborhood is very safe and within walking distance to all of the main Seattle sites; it is on the 4th floor, so we even felt comfortable sleeping with the sliding door open for some fresh Seattle breeze.  
The apartment's rooftop patio is also amazing - beautiful view of the Space Needle, and at sunset it just takes your breath away.  We loved every second, and we definitely didn't want to leave!!  "
3992155,36503531,2015-06-29,27219003,Alexander,"The location is perfect,in the heart of Belltown and in the shadow of the space needle. Kevin's hospitality was greatly appreciated, proving detailed info on how to make the most of the apartment and reachable by phone for questions. I recommend staying here without any hesitation! "
3992155,37050060,2015-07-04,8176633,Sam,"Listing was accurate, the apartment was as described, and the neighborhood was in a perfect location with great shops and restaurants nearby in all directions."
3992155,37759443,2015-07-10,5054450,Jennifer,"Kevin was a great host! He worked with our late check in, quickly responded to any questions I had and made me feel welcome. The condo is as described, clean and comfortable. The location and neighborhood couldn't be better for our trip. I would stay here again!"
3992155,38369783,2015-07-15,28133649,Darby,"This was the perfect setting for my husband and I to explore the city of Seattle.  The location is fantastic with so many attractions (the Space Needle, Pike Place Market, the Seattle Aquarium, and the Great Wheel) within walking distance.  The apartment is small but cozy and great for two.  We thoroughly enjoyed sitting out on the balcony and kept the doors open to keep fresh air moving through.  Loved that we had a place to cook and do laundry.  The apartment was clean and adequately stocked with enough dishes and cooking utensils.  Kevin was so easy-going and very responsive when we checked in.  He wasn't able to meet us but provided specific instructions regarding check in, and everything went smoothly.  The parking garage spaces were compact but we never had a problem getting a spot, and best of all, it was free!  The only downfall about staying at such a great location is that it was a little noisy at night, sometimes making it difficult to sleep soundly (especially because we left the balcony doors open).  However, this wouldn't keep me from staying there again.  Overall, my husband and I had a wonderful experience, and we are grateful to have gotten a true feel for what it must be like to live in downtown Seattle.  Thanks again, Kevin!"
3992155,38596576,2015-07-17,29862007,Mitchell,"Kevin's space was great for what we needed. It was clean, the neighborhood was great, and the rooftop patio was spectacular to hang out on. Once the bed is pulled out the apartment is a little cramped, but not any more so than a hotel room. We (my girlfriend and I) didn't actually get to meet Kevin, which we didn't mind, but he provided plenty of information and details before we checked in. We had just arrived back in Seattle from camping so we found the pullout bed to be comfortable, if not spacious. The monorail was quiet enough that it didn't bother us at all, we found it to be pretty cool. Overall I would highly recommend Kevin's space for a stay- we had a great time."
3992155,39918939,2015-07-27,205169,Roland,Incredibly central apartment within easy walking distance of all major attractions. Very responsive and friendly host! Would definitely recommend to anyone saying in Seattle and will stay again when next in Seattle. 
3992155,40452499,2015-07-31,34947988,Lori,Kevin made us feel welcome - the pullout bed was the best pullout bed I've slept on and the location is near perfect.
3992155,41730473,2015-08-09,23988530,Miles,The apartment was located in an amazing location in Seattle and was a wonderful hub for a week of exploring the city.
3992155,42162704,2015-08-11,19262555,Dennis,"Kevin was very responsive and well organized. The apartment matched the description, and the location is fantastic."
3992155,43048677,2015-08-17,4982446,Kait,"Kevin wrote very detailed messages about what to expect which were very helpful, he answered all my questions before I even had a chance to ask them! The place itself is in a great location, walking distance to everything!"
3992155,44296484,2015-08-25,32623252,Jeffrey,Kevin was very accommodating and helpful for our check in. The apartment looked exactly like it was described and is in an great location. View from the rooftop is even better than it looks.
3992155,44668977,2015-08-28,38287127,Lessli,Kevin was immediately available each time I texted or called him. He was very patient with my late check in at the end of a very long journey. The apartment was exactly as described and central to everything I needed. I would recommend this accommodation.
3992155,45554386,2015-09-04,2147530,Shannon,"Great location, and it was just as described. It's very easy to walk down to Pike's Place and even closer to the Space Needle where you can catch the monorail. The monorail runs right by the apartment, but it is very quiet.  Kevin was very helpful with directions on how to get in and park as well. Thank you!"
3992155,46116272,2015-09-08,31227446,Shane,Kevin was very detailed with his instructions and made this a pleasant experience. The apartment was in the perfect spot if you want to see all of Seattle. I would highly recommend staying at this property. 
3992155,48502808,2015-09-27,11216772,Katherine,"We loved our stay in Kevin's apartment. While we never met him or his wife, he was very quick to respond to all my emails and provided all the information that we needed. We also really appreciated the late check out- we were able to keep our bags there until the late afternoon. The apartment is great for two, and had a few extras like washer/ dryer, detergent and toiletries provided, and a Keurig coffee machine. The pull out couch was surprisingly comfortable! The view from the roof can't be beat- Space Needle RIGHT THERE and a great place to sit and hang. As to be expected in such a great urban location, there is a little street traffic noise to be heard in the apartment- we're from San Francisco and are totally used to that, but it's helpful to have an ear plug and sleep mask if you're sensitive. We only can recommend this place, and would definitely stay there again. Thank you Kevin!"
3992155,51115356,2015-10-18,36080230,Marie,"Even though we didn't meet Kevin in person, his directions were clear and easy to follow. This place was was like our mini-home away from home. I was nervous about walking around the area at night, but the surrounding neighborhood is filled with young people and safe to explore. Also, we didn't even need to rent a car! We literally walked EVERYWHERE. That's how convenient this place was. Only have great things to say about this place!"
3992155,52237282,2015-10-27,43348567,Sarajane,"This was TRULY the best AirBNB experience I have ever had! 
Kevin was very responsive and provided clear and simple check in and check out instructions. 
The apartment is in pristine condition: smelled new, looked new, lovely, cozy and modern and even had a cute private balcony to sit outside. The apartment is right at the end of the hall, providing immediate access to the stairway for quick access to the outside.
The kitchen and bathroom were VERY clean. 
We appreciated that there were plates, utensils, cups, mugs, napkins, ice cubes, dish soap, shampoo, lotion, a heater, extra towels and even a Keurig with a variety of k-cups available for our enjoyment! On a clear night, we made hot cocoa with the Keurig and drank it up on the rooftop!
The tram would pass by every 20 minutes or so (between 7am - midnight), but sounded just like a quick wind passing by. 
The rooftop view was absolutely breathtaking! There are chairs and tables too! I could stay up there forever!
The apartment was in a safe and quiet neighborhood and in an AWESOME location overall!
*Deli across the street (open late till midnight)
*0.4 mile (8 min walk) to the Space Needle
*0.9 mile (18 min walk) to Pike Place Market
*1 minute walk to 5 Point Cafe (open 24 hours)

3992155,52832403,2015-11-02,42703519,Juliet,This was a great first Airbnb experience! Kevin was very responsive whenever we had questions but there weren't many because everything about our stay was well explained beforehand. The apartment was exactly as described and was the perfect amount of space for 2 people. The sofa-bed was very comfortable. The apartment was in a great location. We were able to walk and bus everywhere we wanted to go with no problems.
3992155,53457417,2015-11-09,41429193,Tonatiuh,"Seattle, Washington…memorable trip to say the least. Where do we start? Kevin made everything so seamless and effortless. Kevin’s studio is so welcoming. It comes with everything you need to comfortably enjoy your visit. Kevin’s studio is located literally walking distance from everything…I was blown away. You will never, ever go thangry as great restaurants are all around. Kevin’s studio is ideal for business trip or just a get away with your significant other. Will definitely visit Seattle again and look forward to staying at Kevin’s (website hidden). The view from the rooftop is amazing, try to check it out as soon as you check in. I made the mistake of doing that thirty minutes prior to my departure. The rooftop has a great view. 
"
3992155,54090765,2015-11-16,39359564,Samantha,"Great little spot in Belltown. Within walking distance from pike place, pioneer square, and the waterfront. Parking in the unreserved spots was easy. Also very quick and easy drive over to Woodinville and Kirkland. "
3992155,55561834,2015-12-02,17304061,Erin,"Great location! It was my first time in Seattle with my fiance and this location was so convinient to the tourist spots, restaurants and bars we went to. There's a small grocery store across the street and tons of coffee shops around the corner. The studio is a studio, what else can I say? But it was perfect for the both of us, not too big and not too small. All the amenities I needed, it was there. Kevin also provided cooking ingredients like cooking oil and seasoning in the pantry, which is a plus in my book because I didn't have to spend extra money for those when I'm just making eggs. If you're thinking of renting a car around the city, don't. You'll be fine with taxi's, ubers and/or walking to avoid the crazy parking rates around the city. My fiance got a parking ticket because the receipt wasn't displayed ""correctly."" Are you serious? So FYI, make sure you display your parking receipt on the direction of the curbside, NOT the street side.  Anyway, there is parking available to you at the apartment complex but they are narrow spaces. I recommend getting a compact car if you do decide to rent. I would definitely recommend this place for travelers like me, Kevin was very responsive and made sure we were alright coming in from the airport at 1:30am. Thanks, Kevin!"
3992155,56962139,2015-12-20,14381540,Jenny,"Can't say enough about the location of this place! If you're coming to see all the sights of Seattle and just be a tourist for the weekend, this studio is perfect! Walking distance to everything-- food and bar options all around, and Kevin was so easy to contact and work with for checking in. Not a single complaint! "
4092037,24948240,2015-01-04,7342910,Ivana,Eva and Roland are excellent hosts! The house is extremely nice and the location is great. You are close to downtown but still tucked away from noises.  Nice neighborhood.. Our hosts attended to all our questions/needs.  I would definitely stay at their place again! Thanks Eva and Roland! 
6108796,30851779,2015-04-27,13717165,Jordan,"My girlfriend and I were visiting Seattle for a couple days and needed to find a place to stay very last minute. Christine and Steve responded to our request quickly and were very accommodating. The pictures don't do this apartment justice. It was awesome! It has everything you need, with amazing views from both the apartment and the outdoor patio that overlook Seattle. It's a great location with buses to downtown Seattle only a couple blocks away and easy to find. We didn't have a car and had no problem getting around. It's only a mile walk away from several coffee shops, Trader Joes, restaurants and many other little shops. The Space Needle is also only a couple miles away...we walked there no problem. Christine and Steve were so friendly and hospitable. I can't say enough good things about this place. We will definitely be staying here again if we come back to the area! 


FIVE STARS fo sho! :) "
6108796,31488626,2015-05-05,31747579,Sam,"Christine and Steve were great! The apartment was just as as described and was in a great location! Our stay was more than comfortable, we met up with Steve when we got there and he helped show us around the place so we didn't get lost. Steve also made sure we had everything we needed, and was willing to get anything that we needed for the apartment. We had a great time in Seattle! We will be staying here again soon hopefully.  "
6108796,31618628,2015-05-07,32385193,Oni,"Visited Seattle for the first time and this place was walking distance to many great spots! Spacey and clean apartment, wouldn't have asked for anything more. We willdefinitely use this place for future stays! "

6108796,32212127,2015-05-15,32941250,Josh,"Christine was extremely welcoming! Complete with parking space, this location was just close enough to walk to everything, while still allowing for quite evenings away from the sounds a city can bring. The amenities are fantastic and this brand new apt comes highly recommended. There was even filtered water waiting for me in the fridge!!"
6108796,32382396,2015-05-17,25652823,Tracie,"Christine was awesome! She provided me helpful instructions how to get in/out of her place and the apt was clean, and felt really warm. Would stay again :)"

I can't recommend it enough. 

Beautiful Water Views, great roof deck, Quiet place. You got to stay here!"

Christine was extremely helpful and was always in easy contact. Thanks so much for letting us stay :)"
6108796,33001813,2015-05-24,4140348,David,"Host was never present at apt but she left a phone # to contact if issues arose.   Directions give to apt were fair but did not take into account that there has been long-standing construction which made finding how to get onto Aurora confusing.  MAKE CERTAIN YOU HAVE A GOOD MAP OF AREA OR GPS OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE VERY FRUSTRATED!  Egress to Aurora in the area of the apt is great if you want to go North but complex if you want to go South (back towards downtown).
House rules on AirBnB site state to do dishes - fair enough.  You pay cleaning fee and then are told once in apt that you are supposed to strip beds of linens and do the laundry!  This is definitely NOT the norm for AirBnB hosts; actually, I've never seen this kind of request in over 6 years of using the site.
There is really only 1 bed - the other is a couch that makes into a bed.  The 2 who slept on it were less than satisfied with the comfort although the width and length were surprisingly good for a couch bed.  And, yes, we had to hunt for the pad, sheets, and covers for the couch bed even though we had specifically stated that 4 were on the reservation.  The couch is in the kitchen/living room so would not be a good idea for a family with small kids who want to go to sleep earlier than the adults.  The bedroom bed was very comfortable.  Both areas were very quiet both during the day and at night with minimal road/airplane noise.  The area felt safe for a city although we did not choose to walk around after dark on general principles.
The apt would be a great value for 2 and is still a good value for 4.  The apt was very clean but the community hallways and elevator smelled very bad and the stairs had human hair as if someone had been given a haircut on the landing!  Kitchen was very functional and well equipped.  Host left some coffee but nothing else so this is NOT a bed and breakfast - so bring what you need from home as going to the store when here is not the most convenient."
6108796,33455326,2015-05-28,20363147,Elena,"It was awesome! Christine and her husband were very helpful and accommodating and friendly. The space looks nicer in real life than in the pictures. It is super clean and modern and has a fully stocked kitchen which was great! We also used the grill out on the deck which was such a treat and the view was lovely. We loved staying here and would definitely recommend it! If you don't have a car you probably wouldn't want to stay here if you want to be in the city often but if you do have a car this was very convenient, so nice to be able to have a reserved parking spot and be in the city in 5min."
6108796,33539152,2015-05-29,20020580,Kirk,"We really enjoyed staying with Christine and you will too! This was our first Airbnb experience and because of her it won't be our last. The apartment was clean, modern, and in a nice neighborhood. Everything was pretty much as described in her listing and Christine provides great written instructions for an enjoyable stay. Bonus points for the French press and ground coffee in the kitchen :)"
6108796,33614628,2015-05-30,26255962,Julie,"This place was very nice! Equipped with all amenities you will need. Comfortably sleeps 4 people. Has a really cute nautical theme going on. Very close to the city, and everything is brand new! Building is a little difficult to find though so follow Christines directions carefully. Would stay here again! Beautiful spot! :)"
6108796,34223787,2015-06-06,25465818,Matt,"Christine and Steve are extremely accommodating. When we arrived, we needed a little help finding the key box.  Their place is clean, fully updated and has an amazing deck with a view.  We needed to store our bags a few hours after checkout and they graciously allowed us.  "
6108796,35557952,2015-06-20,12857480,Thomas,"Amazing host. Everything was thought of. We were there for two weeks, and it felt like being home. They even left us a couple toys for our twins. The walk to Fremont was pleasant. We would definitely stay there again. "
6108796,35941399,2015-06-23,13506579,Kevin,Christine provided great detailed instructions on getting into the apartment. There was free parking at the lot attached to the apartment which was a plus. Description of location is accurate - 5-10 minutes to downtown Seattle or to any place in the north. One caveat is that it is hard to get picked up by a cab or uber since it is off of a main road and the drive way is a bit hidden. The apartment is spacious and nicely decorated with a nautical theme. 
6108796,36157229,2015-06-25,13113397,Taylor Ziebarth,"Christine was a great host, apartment was very nice and tidy. Great location near Fremont."
6108796,36495689,2015-06-28,21706442,Bethanne,"4.5 stars. Arrival instructions are very thorough and makes check-in easy.  Good location, safe building with quick access but not walkable to hotspots in downtown/Queen Anne, etc.  Accurate pictures; clean and organized space. Quick response for accepting reservation and handling an issue that arose.  Minus half a star for scanty toilettries, no coffee (that I could find), and the bed comfort could be improved (adding just a pillow top cover on the bed and a fluffy comforter would increase coziness but otherwise it's decent). Overall a solid place and if you choose it it won't disappoint.  :)"
6108796,36956890,2015-07-03,32505831,Michelle,"This was our first stay at an AirBnB and it was a great first experience. The hosts were easy to talk to, responsive, and checked in to make sure things were going well. There was also a helpful binder of house rules, information, and local places to see.

This apartment is in a great location and has a nice view of the lake. We rented a car during our stay and were able to easily visit all attractions we wanted to see. The apartment was also nearby other Seattle neighborhoods which we spent some time exploring as well. The apartment also included a parking spot which was very convenient.

This was a comfortable apartment for two adults and a child. The apartment was clean, had cable and internet, and had all amenities to make it feel like home. Having use of a washer/dryer was a great addition. 

We would definitely come back to stay at this apartment in the future. I would recommend this apartment to visitors to Seattle."
6108796,37271509,2015-07-05,18889310,Kyra,"Great communication with Christine and accurate listing description. Having a designated parking space is a true bonus. We appreciated the box fans provided, that helped circulate air on our hot summer stay. Little ""at home"" thoughtful conveniences tucked in the cupboards, like paddles for the ping pong table on the deck, and a first aid kit when we needed a bandaid. We enjoyed our stay and were able to view the 4th of July fireworks over Lake Union from the window of the apartment! "
6108796,37619504,2015-07-08,66096,Andrew,"Very clean, great instructions and very organized. The coffee and treats were such a nice touch. Nice area close to everything as promised. Cool gym my kids lovvvvvvved. 
GREAT HOST. "
6108796,38593626,2015-07-17,31828434,Joe,"We truly enjoyed staying at Christine's apartment, which was clean, tastefully decorated and well-appointed. My wife and I slept great each night on the extremely comfortable queen bed in the bedroom, and our two grown sons each slept well on the fold-out couch and inflatable mattress in the living room. We enjoy cooking our own breakfasts and dinners even on vacation, and were pleased to find the apartment well stocked with utensils, pots, pans, etc. We also grilled several dinners on the community deck, where we also played ping pong and relaxed in the deck chairs while enjoying the view of Lake Union. Christine was very prompt in answering our questions before and during the reservation process, and continued to communicate with us to ensure that everything was to our liking. The apartment is conveniently located within five minutes of downtown, as well as the Queen Anne and Fremont neighborhoods. It's also an easy walk to Lake Union, where there are kayaks and boats to rent and a running/walking path which leads to Fremont. Getting in and out of the complex is a bit tricky as the apartment building is located between two thoroughfares. However, after getting the hang of it we were zipping in and out at ease. We highly recommend Christine as a host and her apartment as a great place to stay during a visit to Seattle."
6108796,39167476,2015-07-21,33297548,Megan,"The apartment was great! It was very clean and well appointed. There were plenty of towels, sheets, etc. The bed, futon, and air mattress were comfortable and extra mattress cushions were provided.
The apartment was close to most of the major Seattle sites but 5 minutes is a bit of an exaggeration. With a car and no traffic you can get to Pike's Place and Seattle Center in 10-15 minutes.  Capitol hill is 10 minutes away by car and Fremont only 5 minutes. There were many bus stops within a few blocks of the apartment that also went to all major spots. 
There was a slight view of the water.
Christine left information on local restaurants and activities. We felt very welcome! She also provided great directions on how to get the keys etc. "
6108796,39927215,2015-07-27,32985183,Jamie,Listing is right on! Perfect location lots of cool stuff to do on the area. 
6108796,40673957,2015-08-01,6602984,Diana,"The apartment is cozy and nice, very well decorated, perfectly cleaned and with all the necessary for a 4 persons accomodation. 
The communication with Christine was smoothy, simple and clear, providing all the information required to access to the appartment."
6108796,40828734,2015-08-02,11154439,Kristen,"The description of the apartment was spot on and the pictures were exactly what the place looked like. It was very clean and cozy! It was slightly difficult to find, but Christine left detailed instructions which were very helpful for entering the parking garage and apartment itself. I would definitely stay again! Beds were very comfortable and it was a great alternative to a hotel!"
6108796,41740813,2015-08-09,32007702,Justin,"Place was nice and clean. Wi-Fi was fairly slow, but good enough to stream Netflix/Twitch at 1080p. The place feels modern and cozy and is easy to find. Plenty of unexpected amenities like tons of bakeware, Tupperware, etc."
6108796,42291782,2015-08-12,35901550,Maggie,"The listing was exactly as described/ seen in Christine's post. Nice building and it accommodated 4 people very well. Christine even had little things thought of like detergent, fans, extra padding if air mattresses aren't the most comfortable. It is definitely a place I would stay again. There wasn't a ton immediately around that we personally visited, but the places we visited in South Queen Anne were a 20-30 minute walk. Everything was very accessible around with only a 10-15 minute cab ride. Christine was also very responsive if I had any questions leading up to the trip!"
6108796,42890636,2015-08-16,17220394,Aya,"We stayed three nights at Christine's beautiful apartment in mid Aug. Christine provided us all information we needed including directions, how to find the parking, keys and stuff before our arrival. We didn't see her in person during our stay, yet she and her husband were communication us and making sure that we were comfortable and everything was fine. The apartment was nicely decorated, very clean and everything we needed was there. Our children, 8 and 11 years old said that the sleeper sofa was very comfortable. Having nice washer and dryer was a big plus for me since we were on road for a few days in Washington. The neighborhood was fine, but you need a car to get around, very close to Fremont. You can get your parking garage which is huge in Seattle, yet the space is pretty small, good for compact or standard size car. Over all, her apartment was perfect! We have been staying many rental properties in many places, Christine's place is the one of the best!! Thank you so much for all of your hospitality. "
6108796,43417787,2015-08-19,20188976,Ed,"Christine was a pleasure to have as a host and always available to answer questions, even though we didn't have the chance to meet in person. She provided thorough information prior to our visit and made us feel welcome by checking in with us the days leading up to our arrival. The apartment itself was very clean, modern and laid out nicely for our family of four. It had all the necessary amenities plus a beautiful new kitchen and a good sized washer/dryer. The bedroom quite comfy with plenty of space in the closet for our bags. The kids slept on the futon in the living room. The shower was nice and hot and had great water pressure - something we appreciate. It was nice that the apartment was in close proximity to the downtown area. One thing to mention is that the living room faces east and faces a busy street, so if you are a light sleeper and sleeping in the living room, earplugs and a sleep mask may be a good idea (although, the sunlight and noise didn’t seem to bother our kids). All in all, we were very satisfied with our visit and would most certainly recommend staying here."
6108796,43810914,2015-08-22,6513671,Sara,"Had a great time in Seattle.  The apartment was as advertised and really nice and clean.  I appreciated the garage parking space and had no issues parking a VW Jetta.  I especially loved the community rooftop patio. and wish I had more time to spend time there relaxing.  We brought bikes, so I appreciated the easy access to bike lanes that took us downtown and to the Space Needle.  However, the route back to the apartment is uphill which was a little tough.  It was an easy bike ride to Fremont which is a fun neighborhood and the Burke-Gilman trail.  Christine was very responsive and helpful.  It did seem like the apartment was located in a residential area, so I couldn't tell if there were many nearby dining options.  I would definitely stay here again."
6108796,44796428,2015-08-29,416340,Julia,"Nice, clean, comfortable, modern apartment. Car or Uber needed to get to downtown, but nicely located in between downtown and other areas such as Ballard and Fremont. Christine was very nice to communicate with."
6108796,45409553,2015-09-02,41112627,Stephanie,"Spent four nights at this wonderful, clean and stocked apartment. The location was great and Christine was responsive to any needs/requests! I was also super happy to have the place to ourselves with a feeling of privacy. Would definitely stay here again!"
6108796,45570782,2015-09-04,36944475,Louise,"Pros: Christine was very quick to respond and very helpful, on site parking, close by frequent bus to downtown, immaculately clean flat, good storage space, comfortable bed and powerful shower, extras in the kitchen (such as herbs, milk and coffee). A beautiful flat. 

Cons: the noise from the road if you're very sensitive to this and unused to traffic noise. It isn't a major road though, more of a slipway and we personally didn't find it affected us at night and we were out in the day. 

I would agree with a previous reviewer that it would be helpful if the directions were updated to show the diversion to Aurora Avenue/route 99. We didn't have GPS, only a map and it took us 45 minutes from leaving the i5 to find the flat. That may partly have been as we arrived in the dark. If you intend on doing that I would use Google street map to get clear in your mind what the Hudson looks like and how far along it is so that you spot it first time. 

To get the bus downtown, you go via the main lobby into the outside space, down the steps to the right through the small 'park' and onto Dexter where the bus stop is immediately there. The 26/28 run frequently and will stop at Pike Place/3rd Avenue. 

We had a great stay in Christine's flat and would happily recommend this to others without hesitation. She clearly works hard to make sure your stay is a positive one."
6108796,45761371,2015-09-05,41365543,Jeremy,"Christine went out of her way to make sure we got into the unit safely. It is a little confusing but she detailed the process every step of the way. Was only here less than 24 hours but ate dinner at How To Cook a Wolf, and would highly recommend! Would feel totally comfortable booking with Christine in the future. "
6108796,46602103,2015-09-12,39773274,Gerek,"Christine was a very welcoming host. The apartment was stocked with practically anything one would need, particularly in the kitchen. It was clean and very modern. I enjoyed my stay and would certainly come back the next time I am in Seattle."
6108796,46974299,2015-09-14,22370795,Na Hee,Awesome place!! lovely and comfortable house plus great view!
6108796,47218035,2015-09-16,14554782,Gerard,"L'appartement était conforme à la description. Confortable et bien situé, nous avons apprécié le parking. Nous n'avons pas rencontré Christine mais elle était toujours joignable et à notre écoute. L'accès à l'appartement est un peu difficile en raison de l'absence totale de signalétique dans l'immeuble. Le couchage du séjour est un peu bruyant."
6108796,47333621,2015-09-17,15121499,Kathryn,"Christine was super communicative and made the process very easy. The listing is awesome. Really modern with a ridiculously nice gym in the building. Short drive, bur ride or walk to lots of great restaurants and more. It is on a busier street, but from the bedroom I couldn't hear a thing. I would totally recommend and happily stay here again. "
6108796,47946465,2015-09-21,44608538,Ziwen,"Host is very nice,she always gives me the response in few seconds. The house is really comfortable,large bedroom and clean washroom. Thanks the lovely home,Christine."
6108796,48053106,2015-09-22,8183063,Trent,Nice and clean.  Close to everything.
6108796,48156130,2015-09-23,3787344,Amber,"Christine was very prompt in her responses from the initial booking to after check-in. The listing is very accurate and everything was as expected. The unit was great; comfortable living and bedroom spaces, a great kitchen with all of the necessary items to make just about any meal and a great outdoor patio space. The building itself is very quiet, and I rarely saw any other tenants in the hallway or in the outdoor space. I appreciate Christine's thoughtful communication and she checked in to make sure I found the place and have everything I needed. I definitely would stay here again. Also, Canlis is just a short walk away and is an awesome place for dinner and drinks with a great view. Thanks, Christine, for sharing this property!"
6108796,49359818,2015-10-03,1769123,Hamad,"I didn't get the chance to meet Christine and Steve - I think that they keep a good distance, but are always available and prompt to respond via phone, text, or airbnb messaging. I was never left hanging when I had a question or concern to be addressed. They were very accommodating in helping us find the perfect place among their several airbnb properties. The one time I spoke on the phone with them they seemed kind, efficient, but not at all too uptight and with just the right sense of humor. 

The place itself was clean and spacious with plenty of sleeping options for the four of us. There was an air mattress provided along with a sleeper bed and king in the main bedroom with more linens than I have ever owned myself! I was a little hesitant to be on Aurora Avenue(Highway 99), but the place is actually well-insulated from road noise and is actually very walkable. Fremont is a great 15 minute walk away - past some Queen Anne homes, down a hill overlooking the lake, and over the Fremont Bridge. You can see Lake Union from the living room window. Beautiful spot."
6108796,50036592,2015-10-08,42538786,Joanna,The apartment was nice and clean as shown in the photos. The location is close enough to public transportation making traveling around Seattle easy. Christine had excellent communication and very hospitable. She tried to make the check-in and check-out process as easy as possible and was always available for any questions. Thank you again!
6108796,50344961,2015-10-11,3034879,Josh,"Host was responsive, gave great list of restaurants, activities, events, etc.  Helped me navigate to the apartment (I flew into Seatac, took the link rail to downtown Seattle for $3, then a cab to the apartment for $15).  The apartment is very nice, clean.  The kitchen is beautiful, the view is nice.  I love the deck overlooking the lake.  Fremont is a relatively short walk, 15 minutes - over the beautiful Fremont bridge - lots of restaurants over there.   I ate at Ponti's and liked it a lot.  "
6108796,51219728,2015-10-18,38575901,Patrick,"Just after booking the a stay at Christine's Seattle Apartment, I received an email that listed how to get to the location, where to park,  how to get to the apartment and codes. All of this information was great and very helpful so look out for that email. 
She let me know that she was available for questions but there was information book in the Apartment so it answered all of my questions.
The listing is spot on it and the pictures are correct. The apartment has great appeal to it. The kitchen is done in really nice IKEA cabinets and easy to find stuff. The bathroom is just right for a person's needs. The bedroom has a comfy bed in it.  The couch is nice for relaxing to recharge your batteries.  Christine has a book with information on the apartment, the building and location in the area. The queen anne area is amazing. To  get to downtown just use Dexter is less hassle, I found. The parking garage can be a bit hard on lowered and longer sedan like mine, suggest backing into the spot. It is apartment building so there are noises that can be heard, one night the neighbor above the apartment could be heard at 3am. However, this would not be an issue for someone that is already asleep, I don't believe it was loud enough to wake someone up. The apartment is not huge but perfect for one or two people to stay. It is perfect to have a place of your own while in Seattle and cost is less than hotel near this Area. You should stay here and enjoy what Christine has to offer, it is worth it. Thank you Christine.

6108796,52285109,2015-10-27,23675448,Eric,"Christine was a fantastic communicator, very helpful and a gracious host. I wish that we could have met her in person.  The apt is very well kept and I highly recommend it. No noise issues.  Comfortable bed and very clean. "
6108796,52550992,2015-10-30,15121499,Kathryn,"This is the third time that I have stayed at Christine's listing. It's great! Fantastic location, super modern, love having a gym in the building.. A perfect place for a business traveler. Highly recommend!"
6108796,56719778,2015-12-17,45745440,Wendy,"We rented this place for six weeks due to a local work assignment so we got a good feel for the place... And yes it left us feeling really happy with our decision. Extremely clean, quiet and everything we expected was there. The wifi was slow at first, but our hosts fixed it right away. The location is also superb. Just a short walk to vibrant Fremont. We also thought the fitness center was above average. It even has a small rock climbing wall. So yeah, over a month spent there and it was great... Beyond expectations. "
1090307,4398578,2013-05-02,537454,Jan,"Very pleasant accommodation in a quaint, artistically furnished house - in a picturesque neighborhood.  Lovely, quiet garden surrounds the house.  Walking distance to beautiful Green Lake, small restaurants, coffee shops, public transportation, etc.  
Karen is a lovely hostess and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  A five star experience indeed.  "
1090307,4580708,2013-05-13,6132513,Thomas,"Karen was such a wonderful host! She was a great communicator prior to my stay, she was very accommodating of my early arrival time and made me feel very comfortable in her home.

The room was extremely cozy and convenient. I particularly enjoyed having a personal bathroom attached to it.

The neighborhood was great, minutes away from great restaurants and the lake.

I can't wait to go back!"
1090307,4794338,2013-05-26,6117652,Emily & Jillian,"Karen's home was lovely, and the neighborhood was great for taking walks by the lake.  Karen was a fantastic hostess- always open to give suggestions on area restaurants, and we definitely enjoyed doing crossword puzzles in her coffee shop right down the street.  It was a great experience- Thanks!"
1090307,4882225,2013-05-30,6295214,Peter,"Karen was consistently friendly and avaliable. Unfortunately we were not able to spend much time together (we were racing around trying to see everything in Seattle) but it was something I would have liked to do. Starting our mornings at Karen's coffee shop was very nice, everything was tasty and reasonably priced, not to mention that the bar on the corner had an excellent beer selection."
1090307,5114101,2013-06-13,6004899,Rich,"We love Karen's ""homey"" and quaint house.  What a nice place to call ""home base"" while we are in Seattle.  We felt very welcome and comfy. And just down the street his her Café Lulu's where we can enjoy a great cup of coffee and breakfast before we launch into our activities.  We highly recommend Karen's house as a short term rental. "
1090307,5227947,2013-06-19,2675407,Joanne,"Karen is an excellent hostess.  The room was most inviting especially after a long day - a respite to come ""home"" to.
It is conveniently located to Greenlake.  I walked every day around this 3 mile circumference lake and listened to the birds and saw the blooming trees.  Her little outdoor garden is a lovely place to sit and read.  Karen's coffee shop is right down the road. a short walk and a good place to stop in for a good cup of coffee and some pastries.  Her place is conveniently located close to public transport.  The bed was super comfortable, the pillows perfect, the private bathroom with a tub and shower was especially nice. 
 Karen has some great life experiences and her warm personality makes for some great conversation.  Karen's place will be my favorite home away from home any time I am in Seattle.    "
1090307,5331171,2013-06-24,1587702,Chelsey,"Karen's house was perfect...
So perfect in fact, that my now fiancé used the beautiful (and romantic) patio and garden as the setting for his proposal!  Needless to say Karen's house will always be 5 stars in my book but personal bias aside it was a great place to stay.  Simple, clean and in a great neighborhood.  "
1090307,5557758,2013-07-06,6012562,Jill,"We just LOVE Karen’s historical and tastefully decorated home and yard!  We had a busy schedule while we were staying there, but wish we could have spent more time relaxing in her peaceful yard and visiting with her in her cozy family room   She is an excellent host; she made us feel comfortable and welcome.  She was very easy to communicate with before and during our visit.  She was also able to accommodate our late night arrival.  Her house is located in a great neighborhood, and super close to Greenlake… we are hoping to have time during our next visit for walks around the beautiful lake!  We also loved starting every day with a short walk down the street to Karen’s coffee shop for breakfast & coffee.  Karen is so hospitable and friendly, and that shines through her coffee shop.  It is definitely a place to meet for the neighborhood locals, and we felt right at home there   We highly recommend staying at Karen’s house, as it is a great home base for experiencing Seattle!  We will try to stay here every time we come up!  "
1090307,7773481,2013-10-02,8251217,Kathy,"My recent 3 night stay in Green Lake with Karen was great. the home was lovely, it was an excellent location, and Karen was very helpful in making suggestions when I had questions. I would recommend this destination to anyone. "

Karen was very accommodating and made us feel right at home. Her house was clean and very well decorated. It was perfectly located with everything at walking distance.

We would definitely recommend her house to our friends and family!

Thank you Karen!

She was totally cool with us lounging around the house. She owns a really good coffee shop around the corner that we went to several times. The shop and house are super close to Green Lake, which was perfect!
We highly recommend staying with Karen!"

The bed is comfortable. I was able to make my own breakfast in the well-appointed kitchen. The location is near a bus that goes right into the center of Seattle. I happily recommend staying with her."

This was excellent stay. Greenlake location is just perfect - walk to all shops, cafes, pubs and restaurants. Bus every 10 minutes for 20 minute ride to downlown.
If you are coming to Seattle - you must stay here!"
1090307,10064773,2014-01-28,546895,Christine,"Karen's house is in an amazing location for morning runs/walks around Green Lake. Her house is beautiful, with a comfortable and private guest bedroom/bathroom. Karen herself is kind and welcoming. She is willing to offer suggestions and help you navigate the city, or to give you space to just relax. Highly recommended!"
1090307,10663822,2014-03-02,3903741,Ariel,"I was very comfortable at Karen's and she was a great host. Her house is beautiful, artistic, clean and welcoming. The bedroom is small, but has all you need in it (including a closet) and the bathroom feels spacious. The bed was cozy and the room was quiet. I would stay again and I would highly recommend."
1090307,11472074,2014-04-04,6439972,Adam,"Karen's place was great for my stay in Seattle. Right next to Greenlake for a run, and within walking distance to a number of restaurants/stores. I easily took the bus to work every day. The bed was comfortable, and even with my busy schedule I was able to hang out with Karen a few times. Recommended."
1090307,13102121,2014-05-19,14563391,Sharon,"My spouse (64) and I (60) spent three nights in this location. The house is in a quiet, lovely neighborhood near a lake, convenient to everything in Seattle. The bed is comfortable, the bathroom was private, and the kitchen had everything we needed except coffee (it seems that people in Seattle drink coffee in cafes, not at home...). Karen is a sweet person, helpful and not intrusive, and the orange cat next door came in and visited with us, which we found to be an added attraction. All in all, our stay was rather pleasant, and everything inside the house was beautiful and charming. 
I wish I could recommend this location more highly, as it has great potential, but there were problems. 
Only street parking is available, and it was difficult to find a parking spot at times (Karen's description had said ""Street parking is free and never a problem""). There are twelve steps up from the sidewalk to the front door (Karen, in answer to an inquiry, had said “a few steps”). Six of them are of concrete; the rest lead to the porch and are in good condition but somewhat steep. The concrete steps are very steep and uneven, some of them are cracked and in disrepair, and there are no handrails, making it quite difficult to go up and down while carrying luggage. Karen did help us carry our bags – but even if a guest is carrying only a pocketbook, the steps can be scary, especially in a Seattle rain and/or at night, for older or less able guests. 
If the form enabled me to do so, I’d give the place 3.5 stars. 
"
1090307,13475192,2014-05-28,8141717,Janet,"Karen was most gracious and we were able to work out details despite the fact that she was going to be absent while we were there.  Karen's is a lovely home with interesting furnishings -- in a terrific location.  The garden was gorgeous and the house was truly charming. 

There was lots of great reading material.  We had no problems parking nearby and each day we were able to alternate reasonable-length visits with an energetic two-year-old with quiet naps back on 65th.  Altogether, quite delightful!!"
1090307,13681304,2014-06-02,9840603,Christi,"Loved staying with Karen...I'm only sorry I didn't get to spend more time at the house and getting to know Karen. The rooms, the location and Karen's warmth and hospitality make this listing exceptional! And don't miss Karen's cafe, Cafe Lulu, just down the street."
1090307,13893299,2014-06-07,15909249,Laura,Karen has a gorgeous home in the wonderful area of Green Lake. She was an excellent host -- greeting me outside even though I did not arrive  until 830 pm.  The room and experience was just what I expected and I recommend staying with Karen.
1090307,14027159,2014-06-10,6277936,Allan,"My wife and I have a friend who lives near Greenlake but doesn't have much room for guests.  We stayed two nights at Laurie's BnB and found it to be a great place to stay and would recommend it to others.  Because we had meals with our friend  nearby we didn't avail ourselves of the kitchen.  It was a great location for us and we have recommended that our friend have other ""overflow"" guest stay at Laurie's place.  "
1090307,14873762,2014-06-28,16220921,Ricardo,"My stay at Karen's was great! The room/house was very nice and located in a beautiful spot. Her place is very conveniently located - tons of buses that take you everywhere in Seattle and a bunch of restaurants and cafes. Karen was super nice and extremely helpful during my stay. She offered great advice and tips and was always trying to make me feel welcome in her place. I spent most of my time working so I regret not being able to hang out a bit more with her. If I go back to Seattle I will stay with her again, no question!
"
1090307,15270894,2014-07-06,6893222,Debbie,"We stayed with Karen on our trip to Seattle over the 4th of July week. Karen was a great host and made us feel right at home. She had lots of excellent suggestions for us, and her house could not be in a better location, just blocks from Green Lake, and even closer to nearby restaurants, and the cute little coffee shop she owns. Her house is beautiful and artistically decorated. Our room and attached bathroom were clean and spacious, and the bed was very comfortable. Karen was very welcoming and even invited us out with her and her friends to watch fireworks on the 4th. All in all we had a great time. I would definitely recommend her place!"
1090307,15770786,2014-07-15,2683422,Josh,"Just came back from Karen's house in Seattle, and it's everything as advertised: A really great, well appointed home, with a great guest room with an adjoining  private bath, with a really great host.  She knows how to be a great host.  In a few words, Karen is: busy, trustworthy, caring, solid.  If you need to stay in Seattle, this is the place to stay, as its location is absoutely perfect and the neighborhood is very friendly.  I definitely would stay there again if the situation arose."
1090307,15887596,2014-07-17,16069735,Karyn,"Karen was very friendly and welcoming. I loved her place, the bed was comfortable and the location to Greenlake was awesome. She also has a cute coffee shop just up the street which we visited both mornings. :) I would definitely recommend Karen's place for your Seattle visit!"
1090307,16204290,2014-07-23,15617390,Joy,"Had a great time.  Karen was very accommodating a very
nice neighborhood.  "
1090307,16467420,2014-07-28,6431888,Dina,"Our stay here was wonderful! Karen's warmth and hospitality really made us feel welcome. She was so nice, giving us full reign to the kitchen if we needed, suggesting places to eat, etc. Every morning we stopped in to Karen's lovely coffee shop around the corner and it made us feel right at home. Additionally, the house is just a few blocks away from gorgeous Greenlake and is situated in a quiet, lush, laid-back part of the city.

We had a wonderful experience visiting Seattle, and Karen really helped shape our experience!"
1090307,16719199,2014-08-01,16673150,Sebastian,"Karen is a wonderful host and has a lovely home, both my girlfriend and I felt very comfortable and right at home.  We were greeted with a lot of warmth and Karen was very flexible to work with our timeline.  Hopefully in a few months this property will be available for another stay!  Thanks for letting us into your home for a few days - it was too short!"
1090307,16913065,2014-08-04,17524821,Todd,"We had a delightful time at Karen's.  Her home is beautiful, comfortable, and well located.  It is within easy walking distance of Green Lake and is located directly on a bus route to downtown.  We loved hanging out at her cafe around the corner for coffee and would highly recommend her home as a convenient and comfortable place to stay in Seattle."
1090307,17050918,2014-08-06,7017804,Dave,"Despite my stay being very brief and my plans changing, Karen was readily available and easily accommodated me. She has a wonderful place located in a great spot. I would definitely utilize her room again if I needed. "
1090307,17245317,2014-08-09,19301318,Erica,"Wish we would have had more time to explore the area and enjoy the house(and Karen).  Beautifully restored home with great gardens.  Lovely area with restaurants/shops within easy walking distance.  Greenlake park is beautiful.  We parked our car out front and never moved it in the 4 days we were there.  Buses are plentiful and easy to catch.  We went into downtown each day.  It does take 30 min(sometimes more) but was inexpensive and worth it to avoid the crazy Seattle traffic.  The bus system is very safe and pleasant to ride, even at night.  Plus it was a great way to get to see different areas while riding to downtown.  Karen was very welcoming the few times we saw her, we were busy and she is busy.  The bed was comfy and the bathroom was large and clean so it was perfect for us.  Would definitely stay there again.  "
1090307,17539358,2014-08-13,6083652,Taylor & Brian,"All great things! Very comfortable bed, great location, lovely house! Would definitely stay with Karen again! "
1090307,18149259,2014-08-22,16768080,Larina,"Our stay with Karen was VERY pleasant and we really felt at home. Everything was absolutely the same as it was described on the site: comfortable room with a bathroom, cozy house, great location convenient for buses and shops, places to eat and walk. We didn't drive and at first thought it was a bit far from the downtown, but then realized that it was not: about 25 minutes by bus (there are a couple of routes are almost net to the house and many more from Green Lake area) and 10 minutes by taxi (the trip from Space Needle will cost u only 18$)
Karen is a great host. We didn't see each other a lot during the day as we were trying to spend all the days exploring the city but she was very caring and helpful with everything we needed. I had to mail some packages to my friends and she took her time and efforts to do that for me. Very grateful to her! While staying with Karen we never worried what  we would have for breakfast: always had it at the small cafe she owns (a 3-minute walk from her house) and coffee there is very good.
It was my first experience with Airbnb and I'm really glad that it was very good. Thank you , Karen, and thank you, Airbnb. :)"
1090307,18272898,2014-08-24,19688235,Jenny,"Lovely host and wonderful home. Quaint, comfortable room and the fabulous claw foot tub was a treat. Karen was attentive and friendly and the home was very welcoming. This neighborhood was a lot of fun to explore. Everything was in walking distance from our room. Pubs, a beautiful walking path around the lake, shopping, bars, restaurants etc. Karen made some great recommendations on places to check out both in the neighborhood and downtown. Our room had great light, stayed cool, and even had maps of the area ready to use. This is a charming home and the owner really takes the time to ensure you have a comfortable visit. We will certainly return. 
"
1090307,18577070,2014-08-28,1307536,Sarah,"I can't imagine a nicer place to hang your hat while in Seattle. This is a truly beautiful, old west coast home and Karen has made it very welcoming for guests. I was in Seattle for a conference, and Karen's home was a wonderful, private retreat at the end of long days of socializing with colleagues. Much better than staying at the conference hotel for an introvert like me. I especially enjoyed the company of Simon, the very friendly orange cat who lives next door. "
1090307,18733304,2014-08-31,16070255,Curry,Everything was fantastic and I would love to stay there again!  I have nothing bad to say about Karen's home.  Everything was lovely!!!
1090307,18883733,2014-09-02,17819397,Oliver,"Thank you Karen for hosting us.  I really appreciate you waiting for us to arrive even when got there late. 

The room was as described.  Conviniently located with easy free parking. "
1090307,19522851,2014-09-14,17960661,Laura,Lovely location- a couple of blocks from a beautiful lake. Host and room are excellent!
1090307,20099121,2014-09-23,20263168,Andrew,"Karen is awesome! She is super accommodating. I was out and about most of my stay, but Karen made sure I had everything I needed.  The room was very comfortable and suited me just fine. The neighborhood itself is nice and quite, a great place to experience Seattle. Thanks, Karen!"
1090307,20241677,2014-09-26,6854560,Joshua,"Karen's place is all about comfort and relaxation. The details (great beading and towels, hot shower and plenty of closet space) of the room and private bath made us feel at home. We'd stay here again for sure. Thanks Karen!"
1090307,21875684,2014-10-26,20491745,Jack,"We appreciate the hospitality and warm welcome we received from Karen. Every thing was just as it was described in Her listing. She opened her home to us. We would love to stay there again when we go to visit our Granddaughter. Thank you again Karen for your ability to make us feel welcome
Elaine & Jack Horsley "
1090307,22241294,2014-11-02,21663553,Lisa,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and we couldn't be happier.  The room/bathroom are exactly as described in the listing, very cozy with a comfortable bed and linens.  The house has lots of great artwork and is located within easy walking distance of Green Lake and restaurants, or easy freeway access to anywhere else.  The best part, though, was our hostess Karen.  She is very easy to talk to and be around, available without being intrusive.  She was quickly responsive to text requests for directions or recommendations.  We would go back to Seattle again just to stay with her!"
1090307,23912409,2014-12-14,24133405,Nancy,"This is a wonderful location is a small district near Green Lake. The home is a lovely Craftsman-style with a comfortable private room and bath and a shared living room area. The host was clear about instructions and getting in and out of the house is easy w/ her key pad system. A perfect first AirBnB experience! 
"
1090307,24654109,2015-01-01,10601127,Joseph,"Not sure what I can add to all of the positive reviews of Karen's Green Lake home.  I agree with all of the accolades.  It is so pleasant, cozy and charming. I felt right at home.  The bed is super comfortable. The bathroom is private.  The clawfoot tub is a charm and the shower works great. There's am ample closet with lots of drawers and baskets so you can easily keep the room uncluttered. A bonus for me  --  there is a piano and a guitar. You simply can't go wrong here. "
1090307,25492691,2015-01-18,20182196,Ernesto,"Karen was friendly and welcoming from the start. Communication was excellent before our trip. After we arrived, she gave us helpful information about the public transportation system, the neighborhood, and the city, including a great tip about the pub down the street (totally didn't expect a pub to have such good food). We were out and about a lot, but the guest room was clean, private, comfortable, and attractive, as was the entire first floor (including the kitchen), which we were welcomed/encouraged to use during our stay. "
1090307,26433383,2015-02-12,27188061,Elise,"It was a very pleasant first experience with airbnb and closer than any hotel to the work I needed to do in town. Thank you, Karen!"
1090307,26831555,2015-02-20,23192371,Zixuan,Karen is soooo nice and helpful that my parents had a wonderful time with her and green lake neighborhood. 
1090307,27426088,2015-03-04,25068546,Tyler,We very much enjoyed the neighborhood we stayed in.  Very close to many different outlets in the Seattle area with many things to do close by.
1090307,27918866,2015-03-15,15351834,Nancy,"Karen was a wonderful hostess. She made me feel right at home, and offered suggestions to help whenever I asked.  The room was very clean, the house cozy and she welcomed me to use all the downstairs. I would highly recommend her home!  The location is also excellent to enjoy the Green Lake area. Did I mention her wonderful coffee shop around the corner?  "
1090307,28180808,2015-03-19,12947496,Mindy,I had an amazing stay with Karen.  She is so helpful and informed about the area and went above and beyond in providing info to help me get around town.  Her home is lovely and very welcoming...felt like I was visiting an old friend.  Communications and arrival were seamless.  Staying with Karen really made my trip!
1090307,28834325,2015-03-30,27310092,Oliver,"Karen and her partner Mark were wonderful hosts who made sure that staying in Green Lake was a very pleasant experience. The bedroom and the bath are just as described, and Karen is a very friendly and hospitable host. As a guest, I got to share the common areas, as well, and had a generally fantastic time at their place. Also, Green Lake is a nice neighborhood with lots of recreational activities around the lake and good restaurants and bars nearby. I recommend staying here to anyone!"
1090307,31843470,2015-05-10,32459188,Karen Ellen,"Fabulous!  our stay at Karen's home was great.  Home was as described; very clean and comfortable.  Two blocks to Greenlake which we walked every day.  It was fun getting to know Karen, she was more than accommodating...offering her entire home too us.  We will be back!!"
1090307,32355720,2015-05-17,30874987,Cathy,"Karen is a great hostess.  Her house is very well located, very clean, and very nice.  I highly recommend."
1090307,32950245,2015-05-23,20077965,Anthony,"Karen's hospitality was beyond my expectations. My girlfriend and I vacationed in Seattle and after a last minute decision to stay in the city instead of going on to Portland we were able to book a  couple of nights with Karen in Greenlake. She was there to greet us into her home and was kind enough to make arrangements in the event of us missing each other at check in. Her home was beautiful and very accurately described from her Airbnb listing. Clean, welcoming, cozy and easy to get to. I would definitely recommend anyone staying with her because I would in an instant."
1090307,33225321,2015-05-26,3005361,Daniel,"Karen is a fabulous and helpful host who made me feel right at home while I was there.  She's friendly and very attentive.  

The room is charming, comfortable, and the private bathroom is ideal for privacy.  The house itself is beautiful, and I very much enjoyed drinking tea in the backyard.  

A short walk to Green Lake, Whole Foods, and several restaurants made the location perfect, without the hustle and noise of downtown.  Getting to and from downtown via public transportation was easy and convenient.  I definitely recommend this listing for anyone visiting Seattle. "
1090307,33697091,2015-05-31,19243014,Scott,"Great home, great neighborhood - quiet neighborhood, but with solid restaurant choices in walking distance and close to the lake. Eau access from highway.  Easy to park in the neighborhood. Very clean.  Probably my best airbnb experience."
1090307,34061619,2015-06-04,29130540,Gail,"I think that whoever conceptualized Airbnb had Karen Laurie in mind. She was the perfect host.  There was a welcoming note on the front door and we had already received email instructions on accessing her home.  The room was cozy, clean, and conveniently located off a very comfortable common area. It was as depicted in the description. The ensuite bathroom had an antique claw foot tub.  The neighborhood is comprised of interesting craftsman homes, a lake, and park and restaurants right around the corner from Karen's house. We had a car so didn't use public transit but saw many buses in the area.  A bonus was the coffee shop right down the street from the house, owned and operated by Karen and serving really terrific coffee which is saying something in coffee-mad Seattle.   Karen was wonderful to us, she has a great sense of humor and made us feel totally at home."
1090307,34201089,2015-06-06,30297975,Beth,"Hostess was gracious and accommodating, nice home and great out door space. Awesome location to the city and parks and freeway."

1090307,36004372,2015-06-24,2349582,Tracey,"My mom and I loved staying at Karen's!  The location can't be beat. Use one of the many bus routes or an easily available Car2go to access other areas of the city, but you are within walking distance of many things to do and see and plenty of places to eat and shop. Green Lake is 2 blocks away for plenty of outdoor fun. If you have your own car it's only 5 minutes to I-5. Karen is a very gracious host and will help you with anything you need. Her home is lovely and comfortable with a gorgeous bathroom, super comfy bed and quiet garden areas to enjoy some solitude. Definitely on my list to rebook next time I'm in town. "
1090307,36328992,2015-06-27,15809461,David,"Very nice stay, no hassle,as billed,clean,great location,easy parking and very close to the Greenlake walking trail and a cute neighborhood pub.  Unfortunately Karens and my schedules didn t mesh, so didn t get to meet her but she's very-responsive to emails and welcoming.  Would certainly stay again if need arises and would highly recommend.  Thanks Karen !!"
1090307,37557956,2015-07-08,31487368,Laura,"I had a lengthy stay, some 11 days, at Karen's home near Green Lake and every day seemed to exceed the day before as I got to know Karen and the surroundings. I felt extremely welcomed by Karen into her lovely, clean, comfortable home. The bedroom and bathroom were pleasantly spacious. Karen was a gracious host with helpful ideas and suggestions. It was very enjoyable being in her company. With her tips I was able to make the most of my time experiencing what was a completely new place for me. Everything seemed so easy and convenient with downtown Seattle close by and Green Lake just two blocks away."
1090307,38698226,2015-07-18,1094753,Jean,We enjoyed staying with Karen very much.  She is such a wealth of knowledge and helped us plan our sightseeing.  I know we saw more and did more than we would have done on our own.  She and Mark were very welcoming and made us feel comfortable.  The location was great for an early morning walk around the lake.  And having coffee at Lulu's before setting out on our day was a pleasure.  Thanks Karen and Mark.  P.S.  We enjoyed West Seattle on our way to the airport.  Nice suggestion.
1090307,39198706,2015-07-21,24432239,Roger,"A very nice room, with beautiful attached bathroom.  Location was great, with local amenities very close.  Karen and her husband were delightful hosts, and helpful local knowledge.  We were very happy with our two night stay here - thanks Karen!"
1090307,39479834,2015-07-24,29366559,Carol,"The host met us on arrival, sent us directions  using light rail and bus,the room was quiet,we'll decorated and the neighborhood was perfect for our needs. There was a great coffee shop and a restaurant nearby. The biking trails were nearby.



"
1090307,39805160,2015-07-26,1748584,Chi,"We stayed 2 nights in Karen's room.  Karen was a very welcoming host, and the house and room/bathroom were as described in the listing.  The mattress was great, the shower was hot and had good pressure, the neighborhood was peaceful and quiet, and the house was very clean.   I highly recommend this listing for future visitors to Seattle."
1090307,40345772,2015-07-30,36634786,Sophie,Well what can I say other than what a great start to an amazing trip! Staying with Karen is like staying with family. The room is perfect and the bathroom is gorgeous so we couldn't ask for better. Karen and Mark are great and we wouldn't consider them anything other than friends now :) so we will most certainly be returning when we can! 
1090307,40826416,2015-08-02,39153917,Toi,"Karen and Mark were exceptional hosts! This was our first Air B&B experience and we were pleasantly surprised! Their generosity and graciousness made our 4 night stay seem like a few nights at home! The private space and bathroom were clean and welcoming! Additionally, the area is AMAZING- tons of shops, restaurants, and outdoor activities- a diamond in the rough for sure!"
1090307,41106936,2015-08-04,7216771,Suzie,"Score!!!! Karen's place was perfect for our Seattle visit. She is literally about a 5 minute walk to green lake park and a few feet away from her adorable coffee shop, a pub, and a delightfully delicious breakfast nook. Her decor was an added plus. Oh and her backyard is like something out of a magazine. We truly lucked out with this reservation. "
1090307,42263480,2015-08-12,11882827,Ritsuka,Karen's place was perfect for us! Her house is in an ideal location for visiting Seattle. It is just a quick bus ride into downtown where you can visit all of the major Seattle tourist attractions you would want to see yet is still in a quiet neighborhood where you can go for a wonderful walk around Greenlake and have great coffee (of course at Lulu's!) or dinner out at nearby restaurants.
1090307,42830934,2015-08-16,31802770,Henning,"If you are searching for a cozy and relaxing place in Seattle this a very good choice. Karen is an extremely friendly person and helpful beyond one would expect. Perfect. Thank you, Karen!!"
1090307,43434103,2015-08-19,18055517,David,Karen has a sweet home and our room with attached bath was comfortable and perfect for what we needed.  Plus she makes great coffee at her local coffee shop.   Playing uke on her front porch with an orange cat and a cuppa joe.  Pretty nice.  
1090307,44375096,2015-08-25,41637060,Ariel,"Karen was perfect! Nice, welcoming and helpful. This was our first Airbnb stay and I was a little unsure about the whole staying in a room in someone's house thing, but it worked out great. We had all the privacy we needed. Plus the house and room are beautiful! "
1090307,44684387,2015-08-28,40527821,Stacey,"Karen was a lovely host and her home (and backyard) was amazing! Clean, cute, charming, comfortable, safe. The neighborhood was incredible. Great coffee shops, pubs and recreational activities within walking distance. Minutes from downtown. Karen was warm, friendly, hospitable, organized and resourceful. This was a great place to stay! I would do it again in a heartbeat if I came back to Seattle! Thanks Karen!"
1090307,45473678,2015-09-03,36816549,Hans-Peter,"Karen & Mark are great hosts. We felt very comfortable in the house. The location is excellent, short to downtown and at best for sports like running around Green Lake. A view coffeebreak-shops in walking distance and always parking lots close to the accommondation. The house is lovely furnished and very clean.
We got so much support from Karen & Mark what makes us the day likeable. If we stay again in Seattle we would'nt hesitate to come back. 

Many thanks for hosting us!"
1090307,47206847,2015-09-16,40445213,Arleen,"Karen and Mark were wonderful hosts!  They have a lovely home 2 blocks from Greenlake and its walking distance to other eateries and the freeway and downtown.  They made us feel very welcomed and interacted with us about their city, food and sights to see.  The room was exactly as pictured and described and I would definitely stay there again.  Thank y'all for a great experience.  "
1090307,47987709,2015-09-22,40977684,Martha,"Karen and Mark were friendly and flexible hosts, present enough to have a conversation and be helpful, and in their own space enough to allow us to enjoy privacy in ours. 
  
Karen's home is as beautiful and acommodating as it appears, and in a convenient location.  You can take a walk around the neighborhood, or down a few blocks for a longer walk around Greenlake.   PCC (Puget Consumers Coop) is close by, as well as Wholefoods, several restaurants; even the East West Bookstore.

We were pleased to find top notch cookware in the kitchen, and a large gracious dining table with fresh flowers.  The bed is comfortable and cozy with plenty of warm covers, and a private bathroom."
1090307,48902060,2015-09-29,3722782,Richard,"Die Wohnung liegt in einer hübschen und ruhigen Nachbarschaft. Wir haben unser allabendliches Bier in dem sehr netten Pub um die Ecke und das Frühstück in Karens gemütlichen Café sehr genossen. Busse nach Seattle Downtown sind fussläufig vom Haus erreichbar. Mit dem Bus ist man in circa 30min in Seattle Downtown. Das kompakte Zimmer ist hübsch eingerichtet und verfügt über ein schönes eigenes Bad. Es lagen viele Karten und Informationen über die Stadt bereit. Karen und ihr Freund Mark sind sehr nette und zuvorkommende Gastgeber, die uns herzlich willkommen hiessen. Die Schlüsselübergabe fand persönlich statt und verlief reibungslos. Wir haben uns wohl gefühlt und kommen sehr gerne wieder.

132160,422272,2011-08-05,846255,Erika,"Lovely two bedroom apartment. Everything you could ever need was there. One block from picturesque quaint Greenlake. Lovely restaurants, coffee shops and bars within walking distance. Natalie was fantastic and made sure we had everything we needed. Given the location and the quality of the unit, it is an incredible value for the price. My only regret was that i didn't book the apartment for longer. "
132160,429759,2011-08-08,889917,Mary,"We came to Seattle for a wedding this weekend and stayed at the Green Lake Suite.  It was perfect!  Our wedding activities were out in that area so it was easy to get around.  The neighborhood is lovely and the lake is just a few steps away.  What a wonderful place to relax.  The suite is well equipped and you can make all your meals there if you choose.  Nice kitchen.  If you like coffee, they have great coffee options in the kitchen. Very spacious and cheerful decor.  We will definitely be going back!"
132160,443240,2011-08-14,589125,Maria,"This was a lovely, functional apartment that was ideally located.  We had everything we needed in the apartment, we enjoyed all that Green Lake had to offer and were a quick 10-15 minutes to downtown. The lake is less than a block away, and many restaurants are within walking distance.  "
132160,455858,2011-08-18,880787,Brent,"The Greenlake Suite was clean, comfortable, and only a block from the lake.  We enjoyed our stay. "
132160,463176,2011-08-21,893008,Cheryl,Thank you Natalie for a great stay! The suite was spacious and comfortable. We appreciated the quality linens and extra towels. The Nespresso maker was a great touch as were the bagels and kitchen fixings. Perfect location for the kids - our 3 yo loved playing in the wading park just steps away. Thanks!!!
132160,473873,2011-08-25,16549,Paul,"What can I say. The place is wonderful. The bed is comfy, the kitchen and bathroom are new, the little espresso maker is great. The neighborhood is beautiful. There are plenty of good places to eat within walking distance. I can't say enough good things. I highly reccommend Natalie's place."
132160,499565,2011-09-04,774197,Shirley,"We had a lovely time in this 2-bedroom apt.  Everything we needed was there, so we could just have breakfast and other meals at the house.  Being close to Green Lake park was the best - great to walk around, plus there's a playground, wading pool, and boat rentals.  And don't miss the Chocolati Cafe!!  Best hot chocolate you can imagine.  "
132160,565144,2011-09-25,934191,Roy,"we were very impressed with the the accommodation Beds were comfortable  it was clean and tidy and very homely Natalie had provided us with all the essential items which we have not had in previous American residencies even down to a bottle of wine and a homemade banana loaf which went down very well. The house was situated in a lovely area and we would highly recommend this property .We had a wonderfull holiday.

Please pass these comments to the Hosts"

Thanks!"
132160,632232,2011-10-16,1197508,Dan,"Natalie was great and took care of so many details for us.  The little things make a huge difference, for instance she knew we would probably be hungry the next morning and not know where to find breakfast, so she baked us amazing muffins.  The place itself was better than expected, clean and much more spacious.  The kitchen was just renovated, brand new appliances and the bedrooms had large walk in closets with laundry in the apartment.  I highly recommend staying with Natalie and her husband Beau when visiting Seattle. Oh and the location was perfect next to Green Lake which had a great 2.8 mile track around a pristine lake.  The convenient bus service was also very useful if you don't plan on renting a car."
132160,659533,2011-10-24,1258438,Linda,"Our stay at the Green Lake Suite was perfect. There were 4 of us and it accommodated our needs.  It was spacious and clean.  Each bedroom had walk in closets, plenty of room for us.  Beds were so comfortable,  Bath was spacious and plenty of towels and some toiletries were provided.  The full kitchen and living space were great; furnished with the basic essentials.   Natalie provided coffee and muffins     The location is ideal and we are looking forward to our next visit.  We would recommend this place to others. "

132160,810192,2011-12-28,1422769,Bill,"We were visiting our daughter, who lives in North Seattle, over the Christmas holiday.  For us, the location was perfect.  Easy transportation to downtown was a plus; we used the city bus on two days.  We walked around Green Lake; despite cloudy, cool weather, this was nice.  Green Lake is very busy with people no matter what the weather.  Coffee shops and restaurants are nearby, within walking distance.
The housing itself was very comfortable for 4 people.  Neighborhood is nice; it feels very safe.   Kitchen had all appliances to cook our meals.  This was a much more comfortable option for us than using a motel."
132160,857960,2012-01-12,1241201,Liliani,"What a wonderful place. This is our 1st airbnb experience and it' s superb. I cannot recommended Natalie's place high enough.  Everything was perfect, from amenities to kitchen utilities. clean, good location, parking no problem at all. Will definitely come back and recommend her place to friends and family. "

132160,941906,2012-02-22,1710412,Kushang,"Natalie's place is fabulous and located in a great neighborhood, a few steps away from beautiful Green Lake. My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and rested very well. The homemade muffins were a special welcoming treat -- thanks Natalie!"
132160,973922,2012-03-05,1146452,Alice,"Was totally torn between staying at the Hotel Deca or Natalie's place and we were so happy that we decided on Natalie's!  The suite was beautiful, clean, comfortable, down the street from a natural foods grocery store, and right by the lake!  I was in Seattle for a grad school interview and if I get accepted into school,  I'm definitely putting my parents up in Natalie's place when they come up to visit!  "
132160,1015331,2012-03-18,1912723,Alli,"The Green Lake Guest Suite was very sweet!  We used it as a temporary home for a couple days while our house was being painted and it was very easy, comfortable, clean and cozy.  Great location near PCC (natural foods store with great deli) and Greenlake.  Private.  Would definitely stay again.

Alli"
132160,1082906,2012-04-04,1899897,Gretchen,"Great (and quiet) location, thoughtfully furnished apartment, very comfortable and spacious.  Really useful folder with tourist info, especially good suggestions re: eating out.  WiFi very reliable."

We love everything about The Green Lake Suite, i.e. the location, the décor, the cleanliness, the speed of the wifi.  I can’t wait to go back again, and will recommend it to all my friends."
132160,2561453,2012-10-09,3543257,Sarah,My mom and my aunt stayed at Natalie's when they came up to Seattle to visit me and it was a perfect situation.  Her place was large and clean and a nice little home away from home for them to stay in.  The location is super convenient as it is within a few blocks of a local grocery and the could also walk over Greenlake whenever they wanted.  I highly recommend it for anyone that is looking to avoid the typical downtown hotel experience.
132160,2698994,2012-10-24,732245,Phyllis,"Great stay!  Check in was easy, parking no problem, everything we needed in the apartment was there and more.  We like the location near Green Lake,  you can walk to enjoy the lake and shops and restaurants are close.  Downtown a bus ride away.  Recommend Natalie's place highly and hope to return ourselves!"
132160,2842954,2012-11-09,2347650,Janice,"We enjoyed our stay at the Greenlake Guest Suite, private apt very much.  It was nicely furnished and felt like home.  It is close to markets and restaurants plus it is within walking distance of the lake.   Great place to stay.  "
132160,2863169,2012-11-12,1525001,Sherry,"We had a wonderful stay at Natalie's.  Our daughter lives close by and we could just walk to her place.  The beautiful lake was just a few steps from the apartment.  Also, PPC - a great little grocery store - was also within walking distance.  The two bedroom place was really comfortable for 3 people.  Both beds were really comfy and the reading chair in the second bedroom was so wonderful.  The kitchen was well stocked though the table is very small.  We'd definitely return!"
132160,2953668,2012-11-24,3846416,Cristina,"I really enjoyed stay at Natalie's. The apartment was very cosy and clean. Very spacious and well equipment. I enjoyed stay a just few steps from the Green Lake, a wonderful area. The neighborhood is pleasant and quite, restaurants and grocery shop within few min walking distance. Bus stops are also very close and it was easy to explore Seattle. I will definitely come back to Natalie's next time I visit Seattle. I highly recommend this place!  "
132160,3162434,2012-12-27,3912599,Jasmine,"My Mom, Dad and Grandmother came to visiti me in Seattle over Christmas and stayed at the GreenLake suite. They enjoyed it very much. The suite is very nicely decorated and cozy. Since it was over the holidays there was also Christrmas lights put outside that were very pretty. It was also nice to enjoy walks at GreenLake with my family since it is just right around the corner from the suite. Very clean, cozy, comfortable, and modern. Definately reccommend if you need a place to stay. "
132160,3226506,2013-01-02,2937500,Vince,"We had an awesome time - so close to the lake, great place, and super easy to setup.  "

132160,3531061,2013-02-12,2536961,Elaine,"Great 2 night stay.  Good location, easy to access downtown and other neighborhoods.  We came with 2 young kids and it was perfect.  Clean and comfortable.

There is a great market within walking distance so you can dine in if you've got little ones."
132160,3587848,2013-02-19,548823,Merryl,"We loved staying at Natalie's.  It was me, my husband and our two teenage boys.  The location was beautiful, peaceful and quiet, with a choice of more than 5 appealing restaurants within a block.  We mostly cooked our own food and enjoyed the completely equipped kitchen.  There was lots of room and it was very clean. 
     
We were so beusy we didn't walk around the lovely lake on the bike path.  Driving around Seattle was easy. Just keep a careful eye out for pedestrians, since they have the right of way.

The big bed was comfy and definitely large enough for 2.  Same iwth the second bedroom.  The couch/futon was a very comfortable one, and there were lots of extra blankets.  That futon was in an alcove adjoining the kitchen so it was in the public area. It could also sleep two.  She allows spme extra guests and there were sleeping bags and floor space for them.

When some of us were tired, they enjoyed watching netflix or eating at restaurants, while the others of us went for more adventure.

We easily parked in the front on the street.  The bathroom and shower were generous size, and a washer and drier.  Make sure you know exactly how to use the door lock so you don't lock yourself out as we  did.

The hosts were very nice, we just saw them twice.  They had some handy travel literature, and had made a great notebook with more into."
132160,3641342,2013-02-26,5149551,Janice,"Great place to stay.  Everything was spotless; the full kitchen was well appointed, the bedrooms were good sized and the bathroom was roomy.  This is a downstairs apartment so you can hear the owners walking upstairs but they are VERY quiet and considerate and this was not a problem for us.  Much quieter than any hotel I have stayed in.  Great location and very helpful information with restaurant suggestions etc. in a notebook  in the apartment.  Great guidebooks to the Seattle area and a Seattle map for use while you are vising were also available.   My only suggestion would be to have cotton sheets instead of polyester ones.  I would definitely recommend staying here. "
132160,3989165,2013-04-01,3228373,Margaret,"We stayed at the Green Lake Guest Suite during a visit to Seattle with good friends from Italy. Everything was perfect; a spacious, clean and charming apartment located in a convenient, beautiful neighborhood. The area is great, a combo of urban energy and natural beauty. We walked around Green Lake which is just a couple of blocks away, and easily walked to great local restaurants and PCC, a natural food grocer. It was just a 10-minute ride to reach downtown Seattle.

Natalie was also great to work with; responsive, clear and positive in all communications. When we asked to possibly add an extra couple to the reservation at the very last minute she was very accommodating and flexible. I'd definitely recommend this apartment to friends, and hope to stay again in the future. "
132160,4151637,2013-04-14,3355616,Caroline,"I am Caroline.  Natalie is a wonderful host her property is so clean and her beds are made of clouds...My mother and I stayed a week there and loved the huge bathroom, tv flatscreen in both bedrooms, walk in closets, much more,.....i recomend this host to everyone looking to stay in Seattle ares..A+ from us!!
Thankx - Natalie!! ~~~~~

132160,4196419,2013-04-17,942826,Matt,"Lovely comfortable apartment is within a few blocks of a gorgeous lake, delicious cupcakes, an excellent beer bar (Uber), and a great grocery store (PCC).  I would stay at Natalie's again."
132160,4458283,2013-05-06,5951644,Kate,Natalie was extremely accommodating allowing us to check in a little early and communicated very well.  The house was wonderful and in an amazing location.  I would for sure stay there again and recommend it to other friends and family visiting the Seattle area. 
132160,4717949,2013-05-21,6199024,Jessica,"The Green Lake Guest Suite private apartment was perfect for us - 3 adults and an 8 year old boy.  The two bedrooms were spacious, a good size, well-stocked kitchen and a small sitting area.  The bathroom was big!   The host was responsive and got our questions answered before we arrived. 

The host had a folder with information on the apartment and the touristy stuff which were really helpful. Nice beds, soft linens, towels, hairdryer, wifi...etc everything that you need in a hotel is found in this apartment...and more!  Very organized host with a clean place for us.

The tiled bathroom floor can be quite cold for the bare feet so we put another floor mat and it was fine. As this is an in law apartment, you may hear occasional footsteps of the occupants in the main part of the house.  It is not noisy but if you are a really light sleeper, you may be woken up by the footsteps. It didn't bother us at all. 

Off street parking was easy.  We didn't have any problem finding parking every night.

We will recommend this apartment. "
132160,5034462,2013-06-09,5575302,J.C.,"Great first experience with airbnb and Natalie for the 4 of us, my husband, my two boys ( 4.5 and 2.5 years old), and myself all enjoyed the stay for a week. Not only the place is well-equipped and convenient to get around, but the host is very thoughtful that we could easily find all information we needed at a black binder that she prepared. We had good sleep though the jet lag was quite bad as we are from Taiwan where there is 15 hours difference. It felt like another home in this Green Lake Suite. "
132160,5131924,2013-06-14,962428,Melanie,"We had a great time in Seattle staying at Natalie's guest suite. My husband & I, his parents, and our young son all enjoyed the clean & comfortable accommodations. It was a perfectly convenient location for getting to downtown by both car & public transit, and the proximity to the lake was excellent for our morning run and fun at the community centre's playground.

Natalie was a very friendly & welcoming host, and was very quick to resolve the only issue we had (temporary wifi disruption). The suite's kitchen was very well equipped, the bathroom was large with a wonderfully warm shower, and the bedrooms were perfect - nice and big with walk-in closets (perfect for our son's travel cot!) and comfortable beds.

We hope to be back soon - and often!"
132160,5369808,2013-06-26,6795764,Phillip,"Fantastic location.  You can be out the back door and walking around Green Lake in less than a minute.  Short walk to the PCC natural market.  

The apartment itself was clean and comfortable and exactly as advertised. 

Owner was very responsive in all her communications.

Highly recommended. "
132160,5577504,2013-07-07,5921284,Brent,"Perfect location and excellent hosts (even though they were not in the country!).  My family (wife & two kids) and I were very comfortable in the space.  This served as the perfect base to explore Seattle and a couple of near-by islands, but you could spend your entire time enjoying the neighborhood and all there is to do.

We highly recommend!

Thanks Natalie!!"
132160,5677175,2013-07-11,6646319,Rip,"This is a great two-bedroom space. It's beautifully decorated, with a lot of attention paid to the details that make for real comfort. The location is fantastic, both in terms of the immediate neighborhood (the lake is lovely and there are lots of amenities nearby) and accessibility to downtown. We recommend this suite to anyone who is looking for more than one bedroom."
132160,6147149,2013-08-01,16549,Paul,"Our stay at Natalie's was great once again. It is very well located, clean and well appointed. We hope to stay there again next year. I'd like to thank Natalie for let us stay in her lovely apt."

It is not in the center of things but we had no trouble getting around and visitin different parts of Seattle.  All in all, a very enjoyable stay"
132160,6657066,2013-08-20,6903955,Scott,"The apartment and location were wonderful. We rented it while attending our daughter's wedding in Seattle, and in talking to other guests at the wedding, we realized all airbnb's are not created equal.  It made us very happy to go back to Natalie's at night.  We didn't get to enjoy the fantastic location as much as we would have liked, but we will definitlely rent it again to enjoy the Green Lake experience.   "
132160,6868517,2013-08-28,7074101,Curtis,"Great location, Great Apartment. We had a great time. Thank you Natalie for allowing us to stay with you."
132160,7073970,2013-09-05,3349598,Lori," Everything you might think you will need is in the suite at Green Lake. Natalie has gone over and above to make sure your stay is comfortable. The suite is clean and the area is quiet. My husband and I slept in one room and our daughter in the other. The beds were unbelievably comfortable. Our son slept on the futon and was comfortable. The ""one"" bus no transfer to downtown is just a short walk away. If you are insanely hungry hit Beth's (close to the bus stop) for breakfast. The Green Lake suite is a great airbnb stay!"

Walking distance to Green Lake for a morning jog, 10-15 minute drive to Downtown and Capitol Hill for all the wonderful restaurants and bars. A very quiet family neighborhood. Thank you so much Natalie!"
132160,7590844,2013-09-25,3569549,Ash,"Natalie has a great cozy place at Green Lake. The location is amazing, it is practically right at the Lake, so great for exercise and strolling etc. If you happen to go during the summer months, great for swimming I would imagine. Plenty of room to spread out and relax at Natalie's - would recommend. Cheers!"

132160,7946974,2013-10-09,6644199,Charles,"Wow! Is this a nice apartment. There isn't much social space, but the bedrooms, bathrooms, and kitchen are spacious. There is an excellent laundry facility and the shower works well. Be careful of the slight step up to the toilet.

Beds are a bit soft for my taste, but most will love them. All new, I think. Location is amazing. Easy walk to the lake and to cafés, restaurants, taverns, etc. Went back to Zoka -- an old haunt of mine -- and the coffee was still supreme. And the pastries at Hiroki's! Awesome.

Overall, we had a great time here. The owners were very pleasant and polite, and checking in and out was easy. We left a few things behind (such as a bottle of wine and some books) as a thank you.

Would recommend very highly."

132160,8701841,2013-11-12,3244446,Linda,"Natalie's apartment was exceptional. We were in town for only a few days, visiting family, but plan on returning for a longer visit and would definitely hope to stay again in this guest suite. The beds and bedding were incredibly comfortable and the setting was warm and inviting. It's always a plus to have access to a washer and dryer. So close to the lake, which is a beautiful walk. Easy walk to grocery shopping and restaurants. We've explored Green Lake on prior visits but having the opportunity to stay in this community, and in such a beautiful apartment, was fantastic. Thanks Natalie!"
132160,8747933,2013-11-15,66160,Cheryl,"A perfect place for a relaxing stay in Seattle. A 2 minute walk to the lake and bus routes very close.
   The house itself is well equipped, cozy, warm anD clean. The two bedrooms have comfy queen size beds and great walkin closets.
    Nathalie and her husband are gracious hosts.
I warmly recommend."
132160,9406166,2013-12-27,1109135,Judith,"The apartment on Green Lake was fabulous- Bedrooms very spacious and accommodating, kitchen was used by us frequently as we prepared holiday meals here and transported the dishes to my son's house also in Green Lake. Felt like we were at home even though we were only visitors as the apartment had everything we required. Location is ideal in the PCC just down the road and the path to the lake (which became our morning constitutional) is across the street. "

132160,10766905,2014-03-06,12364767,Elizabeth,"Loved the location of the Green Lake Guest Suite -- a block from Green Lake, a block from Puget Consumers' Co-op. The basement apartment is comfortable, well-provisioned and quiet. The alley parking spot is awkward, but fine for unloading and loading. And street parking is easy in this area. I never met Natalie but found check-in to be easy and convenient.  She responded promptly too all communications. Would definitely recommend this spot to others. "
132160,10887811,2014-03-11,3293135,Aniya,"The location is great. Very close to the lake and a few nice restaurants, nice neighborhood as well. The apartment itself was very clean and well-equipped . It's a basement apartment but it was dry and carpeting helps keep the floors warm. There is not much of a living room or a place to eat breakfast (there is a small table that can fit 3 people more or less comfortably) but that's probably not a big deal for most. Check-in/Check-out were very easy and Natalie was very prompt with e-mails. The apartment does have off-street parking but it's a very awkward spot .   "
132160,12186697,2014-04-25,9489210,Vivian,"We absolutely loved our stay here! By far, the cutest & cleanest place we've ever stayed at using AirBnb. It's literally one block away from the beautiful lake, yet conveniently located near the freeway with easy access to Seattle. We look fwd to returning of given the opportunity. Thank you, Natalie! "
132160,12953713,2014-05-15,5686815,James,"Absolutely love this place!!! It was right on Green Lake, both bedrooms have huge closets, TV's, and the place was extremely clean.  They have everything you need for cooking, laundry, ect.  Met the Host once, and they were both down to Earth and made sure we were happy.  Would love to stay again..."
132160,13328170,2014-05-25,6327166,Ziqian,"This is our first travel to Seattle. Very good location near a beautiful lake. And the house is clean, comfortable and quiet. We love here!"
132160,14007752,2014-06-10,8961229,Gail,Lovely place - perfect for events at UW and the northern suburbs.  I definitely recommend it - we will be back!
132160,14337522,2014-06-17,11244671,Lori,"Green Lake Guest Suite was absolutely wonderful!  Natalie was very helpful and responded to my questions quickly and clearly.  The apartment was bigger than we expected, very clean and beautifully decorated.  The kitchen was so well stocked with cooking utensils and dishes, even basic things like coffee filters and coffee.  The location is excellent and parking was always available on the street out front.  We loved staying here!"
132160,14594519,2014-06-23,11669174,Thomas,"This is a great place to stay! The neighborhood is beautiful - less than a block from Green Lake. The neighborhood was quiet and there was never any intrusive noise when trying to sleep. The bedrooms were spacious and clean - with very comfortable beds (with pillow-top mattresses). One bedroom has a DVD player, the other has a Roku (to watch Netflix). There is a central control for heating/cooling, and each bedroom has its own built-in heater as well.  The appliances (refrigerator, microwave) were clean and in excellent condition, and the apartment also has a nice washer and dryer unit on site.  Highly recommended!"
132160,14825028,2014-06-27,15591406,Gang,很高兴入住Natalie的家，房屋里的配套设施齐全，应有尽有，房屋整洁干净。周围街区安静祥和，邻近Green Lake和有机超市，交通进出方便，非常适合居住的优美环境。期待以后再来或介绍给朋友使用。再次谢谢Natalie。
132160,15390695,2014-07-08,493625,Bretta,We loved our stay. Opening the french doors onto the patio while having our morning coffee was a real treat. The use of the grill was an added bonus for sure. The space was clean comfortable and exactly what we wanted. Hope it will be available next summer as well. 
132160,15675940,2014-07-14,14631037,Lauretta,"Great neighbourhood! Listing was exactly as expected. Very nice, comfortable, spacious place. Did not meet hosts as we were very busy. Quiet:)
Comunication beforehand was fast and Natalie was very accomadating."
132160,15931440,2014-07-18,7018003,Diana,"We enjoyed our stay in Green Lake. It is a lovely area with a cozy village and restaurants and coffee shops. We will definitely consider staying here again on our next visit to Seattle. The apartment is very clean and is nicely stocked with necessities. I would recommend this listing to anyone going to the area. Also, there is a great grocery store, PCC, nearby and one in the village, which is fantastic. "
132160,16071445,2014-07-22,526522,Anya,"This Green Lake guest suite was amazing! It was very comfortable for myself and siblings and was super clean and well-maintained. 
The suite is literally right off of Green Lake and in close walking distance to other nice amenities.
Natalie was quick to respond to all my emails and was honest in her posts and explanations of the apartment.
This was my first experience with Air BnB and I was very pleased!"
132160,16553787,2014-07-29,16022143,Sharon,We enjoyed our stay at Natalie's welcoming home! Very clean! The beds were super comfy! We liked the private entrance and patio.  Great location. Walked around Green Lake every morning - which is around the corner. Could not have found a better place to stay! Will definitely stay there again when we return to Seattle!
132160,17199754,2014-08-09,14091057,Ron,"Great guest apartment, very clean and well appointed, and Natalie was a very gracious host.  The proximity to Green Lake, shopping, and restaurants is an added plus.  Highly recommend."
132160,17509033,2014-08-13,4656588,Sergey,"A wonderful place to stay! Comfortable, large enough for 6. The location is great: right next to Green lake, and a host of restaurants and grocery stores. Thanks!"
132160,17934599,2014-08-19,15130843,Margreet,"Natalie has a beautiful house near a beautiful park.  It is complete with dishwasher,  fridge,  washing machine, dryer, two wonderful bedrooms with very good  beds.  You can lounge in the garden as well .  Thank you Natalie for your hospitality! Greetings Jan & Margreet"
132160,18235348,2014-08-24,12884814,Min,"the house located in the street of Green Lake community, a very beautiful community and very easy to grocery, restaurants, cafe. The house is a very cleaning and feasible one, full kitchen, laundry, two bed rooms and a sofa which change into a double bed. 
My family and I love it very much even though we are just living in downstairs. In fact, half-basement. But we could get everything we need. 
"
132160,18940243,2014-09-03,1706206,Lina,"Natalie's apartment is very conveniently located near to Green Lake, shops and restaurants. The flat itself is fully equipped, very nicely decoraded and very clean. The flat is downstairs so it can get noisy depending on the upstair guests. We haven't actually met Natalie but communication has been very easy and fast."
132160,19525369,2014-09-14,16302512,Eric,Nice house and area to stay at for visiting Seattle.  Easy access to the park.  No issues with the place.  It was just as it was in the pictures.
132160,19748082,2014-09-17,20852776,Patricia,"Accommodations, location, hospitality were all awesome.    The description and photos are what sold me on the space and they did not disappoint.  There are numerous restaurants within walking distance and the lake offered a great walking/running path.  Natalie is very responsive and answered all of my questions.  I definitely will be going back."
132160,20050264,2014-09-22,21109698,Grady,My experience at Green Lake was very good. Natalie was friendly and timely in her responses. The unit is a very comfortable space and well equipped. The location is terrific. It is a good value. Thanks!
132160,20432497,2014-09-29,12165808,"Manuel, Debbie And Justin","Everything was great.  The apartment was so clean, the beds were super comfy and the bathroom was a nice size.  We enjoyed our stay and loved that Green Lake was only a minute away.  Thanks, Natalie!"
132160,20607191,2014-10-02,19699926,Kathy,"When you travel a long way, central CA to Seattle, you hope that when you arrive you will ""at least"" be able to get into the home, and if lucky you will find that what you had hoped for would meet your expectation.  From the location to the amenities to the extra touches this rental exceeded our expectations.  

Natalie has a very good value for her renters and a very homelike living situation.  I suspect that we will be back there again someday.  Our daughter is at the University of WA and her home is within walking distance of Natalie's location.

The community has great restaurants, coffee shops, books stores, bike stores and more.

132160,20876251,2014-10-06,9037866,John,"Natalie's place is great. The Green Lake location is convenient to PCC (grocery shpping and breakfast option), restaurants, walking paths, and nice neighborhood. The apartment is very clean and just as pictured on her site.  We would stay there again!"
132160,21059022,2014-10-10,14544,Erin,"This apartment is just as it is shown in the photos. The beds were very comfortable and the apartment had all of the amenities that we needed. It was immaculate and felt like our home away from home. Natalie was very organized and provided us with plenty of sightseeing info on Seattle and a detailed binder with checkout instructions. 

 Great location, less than a block from Green Lake and a short walk to coffee and other restaurants.

I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family."
132160,21300154,2014-10-14,2823917,Mindy,We felt very welcome and space was very cozy.  
132160,21658448,2014-10-21,179481,Enrico,I did stay at Natalie's place before and we again enjoyed the her place a lot. The weather help as well and I was very nice to be able to take a walk around green lake with my sons.
132160,21944374,2014-10-27,19262691,Daniel,"Loved the location, great proximity to exercise, restaurants,  and shopping.

The unit is well maintained and provides all the comforts of home.  The only criticism we would make is that a TV in the living area would be preferred to one in each bedroom.  Just personal preference, we aren't TV watchers in bed. 

Overall, we had a great stay at your home!"
132160,22354585,2014-11-04,17890969,Londa,We really enjoyed our stay.  The beds were very comfortable and the apartment was very clean.  The Green Lake location is great.  We would stay there again and hopefully meet Natalie.
132160,23490386,2014-12-02,12570905,Sue,"Natalie's lovely home near Green Lake was the perfect spot for us.  We had family nearby which made it very easy and the central location between our favorite spots in Phinney Ridge, Ballard and downtown Seattle were very accessible.  Loved being able to take a walk around Green Lake in the early morning before the hectic day started.  Comfortable beds too! We definitely hope to stay there again."
132160,24868683,2015-01-03,24642803,Demian,"Natalie's guest suite was exactly as it was described. It was clean, cozy and convenient. The location is awesome! We really enjoyed our stay."
132160,25502300,2015-01-18,16968079,Sharon,We came to Seattle to visit our daughter who located here from the East Coast.  We were looking for a nine day stay somewhere. This was our first airbnb experience and it was great. Natalie introduced herself upon our arrival and offered any help we might need.   We enjoyed the apartment it was just what we needed. The Green lake area is lovely and we walked the lake almost every day. Saw a lot of  places in Seattle. Looking forward to the next trip and hope to stay here again.
132160,26606674,2015-02-16,13872560,Sunny,"The neighborhood was great! Everything you need is in walking distance. The apartment was clean, cozy and cute!"
132160,26981090,2015-02-23,24703651,Laura,"Natalie's house was just as she described on airbnb and perfect for a visit to Seattle! The house could not be any closer to Green Lake and within walking distance of a great grocery store, coffee shop, playground and restaurants. The living space is in excellent condition, the kitchen is well stocked with everything you would need to make a meal at home and both rooms were comfortable with great space. The private entrance to the home and spacious backyard give you a lot of privacy. We had issues with the lock (because we have never used a remote control lock before and didn't follow directions well) - Natalie was very patient with resetting it for us and also very friendly. We really enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend her guest suite! "
132160,29456075,2015-04-07,20389840,Vanilla,"Sorry to write the review late. As my mum and I are traveling nonstop.. What I want to say is that Natalie's lovely home is very very comfortable and it is just as how she described. The neighborhood is fabulous! We loved Green Lake and it is a ""must stay and see"" for any of you who wants to enjoy the beautiful Seattle.  Natalie is also a very nice host, helped us arrange the time to check out later due to our personal reasons. We really enjoyed it! "
132160,30258345,2015-04-19,30603114,Humberto,"Great place to stay in your visit to Seattle. Very gracious and organized host. Everything looks just like in the pictures and the beds are super comfortable. Never felt that I left home. 

For those curious about the cleaning list it is very easy as the host has a great and simple guide with any instructions. Also included in the guide are nearby restaurants and places to check out or for delivery. 

The location is perfect to feel at home and in a nice/relax neighborhood while being just a quick drive to downtown and other main attractions."
132160,30477506,2015-04-22,31113377,Louis,"The place I felt was very good value and was maintained in a very good condition. The neighborhood was beautiful, right beside a lake and in walking distance from great restaurants and coffee shops.
We were there so my daughter could see the university and it was only ten minutes away by car so the whole trip worked out very well.
"
132160,30737164,2015-04-26,17720516,Ellen,Such a peaceful and relaxing place to stay. Great location in Seattle. The place had everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again. 
132160,31583533,2015-05-07,26654809,Lou Ann,"My husband and I spent a week at the apartment so I could attend a class in the area.  We relied on public transportation and there are convenient bus stops within a short distance of the apartment, particularly the E line and route 16. We found Google Maps to be the best app for planning bus trips. We tried some local apps, but they weren't as helpful.

The apartment was clean and had everything we needed.  The bedrooms and kitchen were great, but the common space was limited.
I was skeptical about the shared laundry, but it was totally fine. The bathroom was large and functional. It also had a heater managed by a switch by the door which was a great addition.

The apartment is within two blocks of Green Lake and we really enjoyed the lake, paths and people watching. Not being particularly interested in cooking, we made use of the neighborhood restaurants. Natalie identified most of them in her guest binder. There is a small grocery store a couple of blocks away that was perfect for our needs (loved their cranberry oatmeal cookies).

The wifi worked consistently and was fast. We use Verizon for phones and found the reception somewhat spotty within the apartment. It didn't really matter to us, but it could for others.

Natalie's apartment was the perfect complement for our trip."
132160,32263610,2015-05-16,14752630,Andrew,Natalie house is absolutely amazing. She has everything that you would need when renting a house and the neighborhood is to die for. I travel to Seattle for work very often and I found her location was perfect for getting around. Right of 99 which shoots you downtown but also in what I think is the best neighborhood in Seattle. Her place has it all.
