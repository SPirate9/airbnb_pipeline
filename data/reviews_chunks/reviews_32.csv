611500,10965821,2014-03-15,8107132,B,"i stayed there with a group of friends for my spring break. It was a really easy process. prez got back to me really fast too. The place is very spacey and looks exactly the same as the pictures. plus, its really close to everywhere (around 5-10 mins to pikes place, 15mins to bellevue). Theres a grocery store nearby. they also provided us with necessities like towels and full equipped kitchen too! Overall, we had a good experience while we were there!"
611500,12043693,2014-04-22,10800511,Paulette,Our family enjoyed their stay at the rental place. The owners had everything prepared for us and were always checking if we needed anything else. The place was not only clean but spacious as well. There was free WIFI and parking space. The place was also accessible to grocery stores and restaurants.

611500,14405559,2014-06-18,12657039,Allison,We stayed two nights at this property and overall were very pleased. The neighborhood looked a little concerning when we first pulled in but seemed to be fine. The house was very clean and had everything we needed and more. Prez and Cherie were very accommodating and helpful. 
611500,15532240,2014-07-11,15312557,Pingjie,This house has lots of space and the hosts are very nice.  The house is clean and well maintenaned.
611500,15605226,2014-07-12,1772631,Duval,"The apt was as advertised, 3 BRs 2 full BRs, huge LR, DR and plenty of places to sleep. The air mattress was a bonus. Comcast cable, flat screens in every room. Our host Prez was super cool and accommodating, even greeting us with some Champagne! (Not sure if every guest gets that treatment but we did). The place is well stocked with plenty of towels etc and the washer dryer came in handy and was easy to use! Overall very nice stay. Wished we could have stayed and extra day but we booked late. 15 mins from downtown.  "
611500,15876638,2014-07-17,786927,Monique,"Prez and Cherie's place was great for my trip. It was close to the light rail, which made getting to and from downtown Seattle super easy. The house was clean and cozy, and Prez was very communicative throughout our stay. Highly recommend!"
611500,16312587,2014-07-25,6110358,Esther,"We had a wonderful stay at prez's house. the apt is fully furnished with everything we needed, it's roomy, tidy and comfy. Also, Prez is a very helpful and friendly host, thanks again !"
611500,16783896,2014-08-02,17388466,Steven,Well coordinated and great service.  Recommended! 
611500,17540766,2014-08-13,7386921,Steve,Staying with Prez and Cherie was a wonderful experience. They repaired quickly to any questions I had and even went above and beyond to help with a billing issue. If you are going to a game or to Seattle for any reason this is for sure the place to stay. I know we'll be back! 
611500,19501347,2014-09-13,19927000,Pati,"My host was at the house to greet my son and his girlfriend when they arrived first. He was very pleasant and I got to meet him when I arrived. The house was located in a nice, safe neighborhood. It was easy to park and located about a 10 minute drive to SafeCo Field. We were celebrating my son's birthday and going to a game. I only wish I could have stayed 2 nights because the house was a good place to base activities from. The house looked very much like it is represented on the website. People rented the apartment below us and I never heard them until they were leaving the next morning. We all enjoyed our stay. Thank you Prez."

611500,32306221,2015-05-16,32081026,Michelle,The host canceled this reservation 26 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
611500,33406888,2015-05-27,20541542,Mallori,I booked this house for my team of brand ambassadors who were in town for training. They said check in was very easy and Prez was very helpful. The house was in a good location and they had zero complaints.
611500,34094606,2015-06-04,22119463,Mike,"The listing was perfect for our purposes. It provided easy access to Bellevue and helped us avoid any potential traffic issues. There was plenty of space in the unit, and each of us had our own beds. Great spot for a quick business trip that substantially saved the company money on hotel rooms."
611500,46779412,2015-09-13,42337097,劼,it is a fantastic house! clean and comfortable. you can find whatever you want there. the location is also great. quiet and convenient.
611500,47573755,2015-09-20,26727085,Morgan,It was an enjoyable stay.  Prez was around to make sure there were no issues but not to much to feel like someone was watching you.  When ever I'm in Seattle I will be looking to stay w/ Prez and Cherie's.
5164194,28837812,2015-03-30,10105300,Bryan,"This place is absolutely fantastic. It is on the 3rd floor of the house and has a stunning view of Lake Washington and Bellevue via a private balcony. It is conveniently located in Capital Hill, with various bars and grocery stores within walking distance. The Cerfs are gracious and polite. They were really nice to chat with whenever we passed each other. It is a very quiet and relaxing spot, with lots of privacy. I would rent this location for a longer period if I could. "
5164194,31329161,2015-05-04,30001226,Rylan,Nice sized room with a great view and good light. Hosts are very welcoming and helpful.
5164194,48391374,2015-09-26,37498394,Clint,"Overall, this was a terrific location to stay at during my month in Seattle.  I primarily chose this site due to its location being in such close proximity to where I would be working (a little over a mile away).  Plus, there is great public transport with bus stops close.  Lynn and Randy were very welcoming, always in communication and made me feel right at home when I arrived.  This room specifically is it's own floor with a private deck that provides gorgeous views of the lake, pointing you directly at downtown Bellevue with the cascades in the background.  No private bathroom, but the common bathroom on the second floor is well kept and it was not a problem sharing with the 1 or 2 other occupants who were renting other rooms.  The neighborhood is quiet, there was always available street parking if you do have a car, and all necessities (groceries, drug store, restaurants, coffee shops, ect) were in close walking distance, no more than 10-15 minutes on foot.  And, if you are a runner, this house is just uphill from the Arboretum, which I made ample use of as a running route during my stay.  I would gladly stay with Lynn and Randy again if my travels do bring me back to Seattle.  Thank you both for the excellent lodging."

719233,2552461,2012-10-08,3741638,Amanda,"The apartment was in a great location and was exactly as stated in the listing.  Nick was really flexible about working around our schedule and was really quick and thorough in his communication. The place seems like a great deal, and I highly recommend it."
719233,2567617,2012-10-09,3423829,Juan Carlos,"This place was just amazing! From the very beginning Nick responded so quickly to my request. He made the best to make the futon in the living room so comfortable for my friend. Nick had no problem with our bicycles inside the place which made us feel safer. The apartment is located in a nice area, very close to downtown with tons of restaurants, coffee shops, bars and the vibrant energy of Capitol Hill. 

Nick wasn't in town to check us in but his friend Nicole was going to be in charge. She met us even before than we were supposed to (two hours before), she was very nice and attentive, she gave us some ideas on places to eat. I needed a screw driver to remove something from my bike and she got one right away.

The whole apartment for such a wonderful price is seriously the best deal in town!!! the living room is spacious and the TV has the Roku box so we could stream Pandora and watch anything from Netflix. The kitchen has everything you need to make a delicious meal, the bedroom is very spacious and comfortable, the bedding and appliances were new, the bathroom  and the whole apartment was super clean. 

On our second day at the place we met Nick, he is very laid back and genuine, I could tell he just wanted to be the most helpful possible, he felt like an old friend. He had no problem with us checking out later than supposed to if we needed to.

I definitely recommend Nick's place and look forward to come back for more Seattle times! I will not look for another spot to stay, just like that. "
719233,2607900,2012-10-14,3738094,Tim,"The description Nick gave is spot on.
Very quiet building, can only hear sirens sometimes, good locks on doors and windows, good lighting, great to have Netflix and Pandora, kitchen well stocked, comfortable bed, good shower and toilet. 
Nice little living room with a breakfast table next to the window. Wooden floors all throughout.

Yeah it's well used but it's clean and the location is perfect to get downtown or late night fun in Capitol Hill!"
719233,2635014,2012-10-16,717566,Allison,"Cute apartment, great location.  And Nick was an incredibly attentive and accommodating host.  Thanks!"
719233,2686557,2012-10-22,693388,Hannah,"Nick's Melrose Court Apartment is minimal but has everything you would need. Nick is beyond helpful, had a list of useful information for us and is more organized than any host I've ever stayed with. Nick is just a few doors down and was quick to mention that he's always up to help. We shortened our stay because we found an apartment in Seattle, and Nick could not have been more accommodating in refiguring the reservation. Although our stay wasn't for tourism, the location is really awesome for people who want to see all Seattle's sights!"
719233,2734552,2012-10-27,3965593,Jeremy,"We stayed at Nick's place for a couple of nights in October. The apartment is clean and tidy, and in a fab location, close to the CBD and some funky inner city areas. Nick was really amenable and easy going, easy to get in contact with, flexible and also great in making sure we were ok and comfortable. If I make it back to Seattle, I'd definitely stay again!"
719233,2754550,2012-10-29,2611408,Kipp,"Nick's place is cozy,  tastefully decorated, and in a fantastic location.  He made us feel  welcome and went above and beyond our expectations in terms of friendliness and making sure we had everything we needed. The place came complete with maps, local guides, wifi, and Netflix streaming! (Not to mention a helpful host). I would definitely recommend Nick's place to any other traveller."
719233,2792919,2012-11-03,3686448,Jason,"ANicks apartment was great and exactly as advertised. It was clean with a fresh bed and an excellent location. Nick and I did not meet until the day I left, which goes to show that I had no problems to give to his attention during my stay. Check in and check out was simple, and he even let me check out really late in the day to accommodate my 11pm flight home. I would stay here again, for sure."
719233,2813980,2012-11-05,290148,Anisha,"Nick was so great! My friend and I arrived at 11PM on a Friday and he was there to greet us and let us in, show us around the apartment and lay everything out for us. The apartment was so great! Everything we needed was right there- towels, a nice comfy bed, a clean bathroom, kitchen utensils, even Netflix! Nick even had books and recommendations out for us and even went out of his way to let us store our bags after checkout time so that we wouldn't have to carry them around with us all day until our scheduled flight. 
The location of the apartment was FANTASTIC! Perfect spot in Capitol Hill. Great coffee shop nearby, as well as Melrose Market and yummy Li'l Woody's! I wouldn't stay anywhere else if I were to revisit Seattle.
Thanks Nick!"
719233,2841523,2012-11-08,3870037,Martin,"This location is very close to Seattle downtown. For me the apartement was almost prefect. It was clean, nice, warm and the kitchen was well equiped. Some guides for the town has been prepared, also a personal one from Nick himself.
Nick was a very nice and friendly host!"
719233,2844101,2012-11-09,3778133,Mark,"The place is terrific! I only stayed for one night, but was left wishing I'd stayed for more. The apartment is in a great location, very close to cool restaurants, coffeeshops, bars, shopping, etc., and you can easily walk, take a bus or drive to downtown. It was clean, a good size space, and great value for the money. Nick is a really great host--friendly, knowledgeable and reliable. He offered lots of recommendations, and went out of his way to make sure I got into the apartment okay. "
719233,2853819,2012-11-10,4061597,Jasmin,"My friend and I had a fantastic time in Seattle and Nick's place was perfect for our short stay. It was my first time using airbnb and everything worked out well. His place was clean, and had everything we needed, the bed was super comfortable and the location was fantastic. Walking distance to Capitol Hill as well as Pike Place / Downtown Seattle. 
I can absolutely recommend Nick's place and probably even use it myself again when I'm in Seattle the next time.
Thank you so much Nick for being such a great host as well!"
719233,2878279,2012-11-13,3711258,Michael,Nick was great.  So was the apartment.  Exactly as described in a very cool and accessible area of Seattle. 
719233,2892358,2012-11-15,9683,Howie,Nick was a fantastic host--super helpful and made everything easy from checkin to checkout.  Apartment is a great 1 bedroom in a fantastic location.
719233,2897970,2012-11-16,3947960,Jane,"This was a great first time experience with airbnb and my stay at Nick's was perfect. 

It's a cozy apartment that was more than adequate. Nick was extremely helpful and friendly. The location is convenient to food and entertainment and we enjoyed walking around exploring the surrounding neighborhood.  I recommend staying here!"
719233,2936721,2012-11-21,3975786,Samuel,"Nick's apartment was my first AirBnB experience. Before the booking, he ensured that I had everything I needed and was incredibly responsive. When I arrived in Seattle, he let me borrow an umbrella (I know, I was going to Seattle and forgot one somehow!) and offered a few suggestions for places to check out in the Capital Hill area. Staying in his apartment which was tastefully decorated, roomy, comfortable was everything I expected. If everyone is as friendly and helpful as Nick, I would say my first (and certainly) not my last booking was a huge success. Thanks for making me feel so welcome!"
719233,2960981,2012-11-25,3755211,Matthew,"Nick was helpful, friendly, and very welcoming.  We did not get to meet in person but he was very easy to communicate with and even left a list of tips for places to check out in the area.  The apartment is in a cool area of Capital Hill and a short walk downtown.  Overall the stay was perfect and I would like to stay again if I am back in the area."
719233,2983866,2012-11-27,3495817,Amy,We had a great time at Nick's place! The location was fantastic and Nick was a friendly host. I'd recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Nick!
719233,3016399,2012-12-03,3958383,Holland,"Nick was a welcoming and gracious host who went out of his way to make us feel at home. The apartment is well-furnished, with a great location in Capitol Hill, and the Roku box is a nice touch. Next door to the apartment are a game room/bar and French creperie. Not bad at all. Overall, we were immensely pleased with our experience and will be returning again soon. "
719233,3028742,2012-12-04,3335374,Cassandra,"Nick's place was perfect for our stay. We were only there one night, visiting from Portland, looking for a warm bed and a good ""home base"" to explore the city. The location was amazing, walking distance to downtown and capitol hill! Pike's Place Market, coffee, food, bars, etc. Parking, although not provided was really easy and close by. The bed was incredibly comfortable and clean and Nick made sure we were aware of all the heaters in case we were cold. Very easy, friendly, convenient.  "
719233,3037434,2012-12-06,3652438,Stephanie + Michael,"Great location. Not quite as nice as the photos, but still an enjoyable stay!"
719233,3048775,2012-12-08,1964807,Chris,Perfect location in Capitol Hill. Really interesting space (a former motel). Nick couldn't have been more welcoming and helpful. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. 
719233,3054389,2012-12-09,4328317,Josh,"I came to check out a grad school and had never been to Seattle before. Nick went out of his way to show me around town and make sure I had everything I needed.

While the apartment is nothing fancy, it is clean and a solid choice for a traveler looking to get to know the city. I took the rail from the airport and got off at Westlake; the rest of the distance was an easy walk.

All in all, a good value and a great host. If you choose to stay here, time permitting, you should hang out with Nick. He's a great guy who has interesting thoughts on Seattle and life."
719233,3058272,2012-12-11,3871852,Daniel,"From the get-go, Nick was very attentive and made sure that he had all my travel info correct, but also that I had everything that I needed.  As for the apartment itself, it's well heated, has everything you need for a few people (I stayed by myself and found the size of the apartment more than adequate), and the location is pretty solid.  I was able to walk to downtown and to the bars in Cap Hill.  I'd recommend staying here and I will next time I'm in Seattle and need a place to stay in the Cap Hill area."
719233,3119286,2012-12-19,4186268,Sandra,"Nick was an attentive host, who checked in during our stay to see if we needed anything. The apartment is quiet, well heated, and comfortable, though not fancy. Great location! - convenient to many good restaurants (I could eat at Skillet every day), nightlife, and public transportation."
719233,3129183,2012-12-21,752859,Bronwyn & Ryan,"We had an excellent stay with Nick in apartment 307. Had the apartment to ourselves, everything was clean and comfortable. He was able to accommodate our later checkin at about 9pm and our early checkout of 6am. Was great to have the place to ourselves, complete with netflix and full kitchen with all the basics - coffee, tea, etc. Right between Capitol Hill and Downtown, super convenient location. Don't hesitate to book here."
719233,3133091,2012-12-22,3729722,Francisco,"Location is fantastic; right in the middle of Capitol Hill nightlife and within walking distance from Downtown as well!  Living room is spacious, kitchen is convenient, bed is comfortable, and Nick (the host) is very helpful."
719233,3141914,2012-12-23,677232,Vlada,"Our stay was wonderful, Nick was punctual in his responses it was very easy to access his place. Located in the center of the city in a funky part of town with lots of restaurants coffee shops and bars. We truly had an amazing time don't forget to access the little taco shop up the street."
719233,3146406,2012-12-24,4061597,Jasmin,"My second visit at Nick's place at Melrose Court in Seattle. The place is always super clean with Netflix and Wifi. The location is fantastic, very close to Pike Market and in easy walking distance to Capitol Hill. Nick also has some great tips on what to do in Seattle and some great tips on where to eat and drink. I totally recommend his place!"
719233,3178398,2012-12-29,3003442,Paul,"Nick is very easy to deal with, and this apartment is perfect for what we needed, somewhere to crash at night when we weren't exploring the city. Just keep in mind that this place appears to be a super old motel converted into apartments. My only beef was that the futon in the living room was probably less comfortable than a rock. That being said, the bed was comfy and there are heaters in each room. I would stay there again. "
719233,3251770,2013-01-03,2602951,Georgia,"We stayed over New Years at Nick's Melrose Court Apartment which was warm, cosy, comfortable, clean and tidy. We found the location to be perfect for what we needed and was within walking distance to great bars and restaurants as well as downtown which made our stay and seeing Seattle just that little much better. I would recommend staying with Nick as he is extremely helpful and really wants you to experience Seattle at its fullest!"
719233,3279207,2013-01-05,4059324,Zak,Nick is a good responsive host.  He was out of town while I stayed at his place so he put another person in his building in charge.  She was super helpful and dealt with our request to keep luggage in the room after check-out.  The place is in a primo location (you can walk everywhere and it is steps from the heart of capital hill nightlife and restaurants).  It is as advertised and the price is appropriate.
719233,3297699,2013-01-07,914663,Meiling,"nick is very easy to communicate with, and though he wasnt around when we came, everything was taken cared of so that we wouldnt have any problems getting to his place and checking in. the apartment is in a very good location, a rather nice walk to pikes market. transportation was also hassle free, and there was a supermarket nearby which was also very convenient. the house was clean in general.  could have used just a little bit more dusting, but it wasnt really much of a problem. overall, it was a very good stay and id recommend the place to anyone looking to go around seattle."
719233,3332125,2013-01-12,4345680,Carla,Great location. Included the basic amenities of an apartment without being pretentious.  Clean and met our expectations. We would stay here again if we ever visited Seattle again! 
719233,3349063,2013-01-14,4641270,Sarai,"Nick's place was clean and wonderful to stay in.  Close to many fun areas of town and although we didn't meet him personally, he was easy to work with and very quick to communicate with us making everything go smoothly.  He had a friend give us the keys and she was also super helpful and wonderful to work with!  I would definately stay in his place again."
719233,3441909,2013-01-30,189983,Jennie,Great location and space for the money! Very walkable to downtown area and felt safe.
719233,3480970,2013-02-05,4523688,Luc,"We were very pleased with the arrangements pre arrival and with the appartment itself. It is conveniently located (close to  atractions, bus stops nearby,restaurants, grocery) and provides adequate space for three people . (room 107 accomodates easily 2 people).  Good kitchen applicances and some stuff in the cubbard such as tea, coffee and peanut butter. Parking is a problem but can be managed wiht $10-$12 full day sites and off street parking; manageable over the week ends but some creativity required. Nick is extremely helpful:we forgot some stuff after packing in a hurry and he will send this ..and declined us paying postage... Highly recommended!!!"
719233,3515557,2013-02-11,4670176,Louise,"This was my first Airbnb experience and I was very impressed by the whole setup! Nick was a great host and prompt with his responses when I had a question. If you're looking for a place that's central to the different neighborhoods in Seattle, Melrose Court is a great option! I would definitely recommend it. "
719233,3529154,2013-02-12,1025392,Claire,"This modest apartment is in a great central location. Nicole, Nick's helper, was very warm and welcoming, and was helpful in orienting us. The apartment is basic, as Nick clearly outlines, so visitors should temper their expectations to match the listing. The beds were comfy and the unit was quiet, which was great. Everything worked as it should! There were a couple of minor cleaning issues, which I understand Nick is currently correcting. "
719233,3566515,2013-02-18,4018978,Marlene,"We visited Seattle for the NASP conference in February and we had a great time (sorry for the late post). We really appreciated how helpful Nick was before our arrival, he always answered emails promptly and gave us a lot of information. When we were there Nicole was very helpful, she pointed out the great coffee shop around the corner (Bauhaus) and even walked Katie to the convention center on the first day. She was available for late check-in and was always helpful when we had questions.
We enjoyed the location of the apartment very much, which made us very independent of public transportation. It was also well heated and cozy, and we enjoyed how silent it was. 
Some minor cleaning issues were discussed with Nicole directly and we are sure that that's not an issue anymore since a month has passed. 
Marlene and Katie :)"
719233,3594649,2013-02-20,1931732,Stephanie,"Nick and Nicole are both very accommodating. The place is centrally located in Capitol Hill where everything was. The place does need a bit of a clean up. Very dusty and bathroom was somewhat dirty. The bathroom door also had problems closing fully and required a huge force to close and open it. Overall, the apartment had everything you needed for a weekend getaway minus free parking, which wasn't an issue for us since we traveled by foot and public transportation. 

Thanks Nick and Nicole for all your help! "
719233,3622240,2013-02-26,3222844,Joe,"I cannot recommend enough staying in the Melrose Court Apartments. Nick and Nichole do an excellent job of making sure that you feel comfortable and at home. The place is centrally located within blocks of some of the main strips in the Capitol Hill area.  My wife and I walked back-and-forth from Pike Place Market and all around the area without any issues at all.  The apartment itself was clean and cozy, and they kindly provide cups, dishes, paper towels, towels, and so on. They were very helpful in checking us in around our unique schedule, and we would gladly stay in their unit again."
719233,3630693,2013-02-26,3086230,Aaron,Great place to stay!  Was our first time using AirBnB and it was definitely a great first time.  Very easy to communicate. Clean place. Would definitively recommend.  Close to some good bars/restaurants. Overall great experience.   
719233,3635712,2013-02-26,3300315,Rafał,"I guess that the cleanliness problems pointed out by previous reviewers were corrected - I saw nothing that I could complain about. The apartment is simple, but has everything you might need during a weekend or longer stay. The bed is comfortable, the room is quiet (even though the location itself is not - guess that's the price for living close to downtown)  and the apt exceeded my expectations if you consider its price.

719233,3682067,2013-03-04,4060521,Jim,"Fantastic location!  Comfortable, low-key apartment with big windows and lots of conveniences covered.  I especially appreciated the Roku box (playing Netflix, Hulu) and coffee maker :) Getting keys was easy and Nick & Nicole were both friendly and prompt!"
719233,3697906,2013-03-05,4539000,John & Brandon,"I surprised my bf with a trip to Seattle and this was the ideal location to stay at.  It was very easy to get to from I-5 and the whole surrounding neighborhood is Seattle at its best.  If you are coming by car, make sure to investigate parking options beforehand.  The hosts are also very helpful with this.  The apartment is a good size for two people, and surprisingly quiet and private given the very populated area.  We were relieved it is on the third floor, away from the busy streets around the building.  There is nothing showy about the apartment or the apartment building, but there is everything one would need to feel comfortable.  Nicole is who we dealt with - she lives in the apartment complex as well so is easy to contact, and a pleasure to deal with.  We would stay here again in the future.  "
719233,3729848,2013-03-09,5042721,Melissa,Great place if you don't need too many luxuries. Cool neighborhood with bars and coffee places nearby. Super easy to check in and check out. I miss Seattle already!
719233,3743647,2013-03-11,3065450,Nigel,"Nicely kept apartment very convenient for both the city centre and Capitol Hill.  There were 3 of us staying there and found it fine for just a few days.  I slept on the futon and found it very comfortable.

Parking around the area can be difficult.  Most spaces around the apartment are 2 hours only during the day, but spaces can be found for overnight parking.

Nicole was very accommodating when we asked for an extra key, but we only had one key for the first day.  I'd suggest letting Nick & Nicole know beforehand that you need a second key if this is what you require."
719233,3789584,2013-03-15,2057857,Sean,"Everything went smoothly and well.  Although Nick was out of town, his assistant Nicole did an extremely wonderful job being present and answering questions!  The room was very nice and clean and the location was perfect!  I'd definitely recommend staying here.

Best,

Sean"
719233,3799764,2013-03-16,952476,Jazmin,"We actually ended up staying in 107 instead of 307 (there was some sort of mixup on arrival) but the apartment was pretty comfortable and conveniently located. We especially appreciated that there was only about a 20 minute walk (our luggage slowed us down) to the light rail, which then took us to the airport. Easy walk to a lot of restaurants and downtown attractions. 

There was a lot of construction going on in the courtyard, which wasn't really a problem for us for the one morning but it would have been for a longer stay. Hopefully that's just temporary. 

Nicole handled all communications and was very friendly and helpful. Nice bargain for the location. Would stay here again. "
719233,3812485,2013-03-17,5111558,Shaheen,"Even with same day notice our host was very accommodating. Great value, enough space for three to sleep (four if you share the bed). Really convenient location. Stumptown coffee right around the corner was amazing!"
719233,4029478,2013-04-03,5696986,Matthew,Great experience. Easy to coordinate. Super friendly host. Comfortable place to stay. Very close to lots of cool places. Thanks!
719233,4062751,2013-04-07,2649537,William,"The apartment has everything you would need to feel like you are living in Seattle.  The location is perfect, only 5 blocks from the Hill and a short walk to downtown. They even had umbrella in the apartment for guys like me who from SD and forgot to bring one.  Nicole was very helpful as well :-0  She even let me have a late checkout.  Look forward to staying here again. "
719233,4082129,2013-04-08,5508213,Oliver,"The apartment (307) was really great for me. It was big enough, clean and had everything you need to live for a couple of days and even for a longer period of time. 
The location was excellent. You could easily walk to the ""Spaceneedle"" and the ""EMP"" or to downtown within 10-15minutes.
Nicole was a great host, she answered my mails within 24 hours, most of the time after 1 or 2 hrs, and she was super friendly.
Whoever wants to stay in Seattle and needs a good, clean and cheap location- Nick and Nicole are the right hosts for you!"
719233,4103784,2013-04-09,2215560,Zak And Jessica,"Nick's place is in a great location! The apartment is a functional home-base for access to all of the great bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. His disclaimer that parking can be tricky is true, but it was definitely manageable. Check-in/out was really easy and convenient. "
719233,4107105,2013-04-10,5130245,Anne,"Nick was not available, so his friend Nicole checked us in and everthing went alright and short time arrangememts we're no problem. That was the good thing concerning this accomodation. The position at downtown was pleasant, too. BUT the accomodation itself was very dirty and we were disgusted (hair in the bed and the bathroom, floor was full of dirt and had not been swepped for I do not know how long). Even the sheets on the bed had not been changed for a while and there had been some people for just one night sleeping there before our arrival. "
719233,4116002,2013-04-11,2698269,Anne,"We booked a room mid-week for one night to see a show at a local music club. The location can't be beat.  It was walking distance from everything we needed and much more affordable than any motel we would have found in that area.  We weren't able to meet up with our hosts (our fault--forgot our phone) but they left perfect instructions for us to get in and out via a lockbox.  It's basically an apartment in a complex with other residents.  Seems many of them smoke outside, so I would warn future visitors if they are sensitive to that, but it didn't bother us at all, and couldn't tell from inside the rooms.  The apartment had all the basics with kitchen and comfy bed--nothing extravagant, but nothing missing either. We appreciated the maps and binder of local eateries left on the table for us.  We parked in a lot up the block for the night after 6pm and were out by 7am, so paid $6 total for that, I think.  When we visit the neighborhood again, we would be sure to stay here.  "
719233,4131813,2013-04-12,5804802,Amber,"Nick was great about communicating and relaying details for my stay, and the apartment was beautifully appointed and a short walk to downtown and the Capitol Hill neighborhood.  "
719233,4143155,2013-04-13,3637579,Tim,"Spent two nights here in April.  Very happy with this apartment and would return.  Close to lots of good eats in Capitol Hill.  Walk to downtown is also not so bad.  Accommodated 3 of us without trouble.  Nick's crew were easy to contact and were helpful with our delayed check-out.  

Apartment is up 5 or 6 flights of stairs, no elevator if that is relevant."
719233,4148363,2013-04-14,1618397,Adrienne,"We were in town for a show at Julia's on Broadway and the location of 307 was premier. Situated in a cute neighborhood intermixed with stores and restaurants. In the morning, we ventured outdoors for a 12.5 mile run and it was so much more pleasant to begin in a neighborhood, than in downtown (although downtown is a mere 1/4 mile, Pike Place - maybe 12 blocks, very convenient).  Nicole (who coordinates for Nick) is delightful, responsible, respectful and a true Pacific Northwestern. Thank you."
719233,4173683,2013-04-15,5836525,Alexander,"We spent a night here in April, as it was a prime location and nicely priced! Nick wasn't in town, so Nicole checked us in and made sure that we had everything we needed. She was super accommodating, when we were unsure about when we would be checking in, as well as when I forgot a couple of things in the unit after checking out and needed to be let back in. 

The unit wasn't that big, but it was big enough for the two of us to move around in comfortably. Everything was clean and looked great. There were some issues with using the oven/stove (as the markings for the temperatures were scratched off), but overall the kitchen was well stocked with dishes, pots & pans, and utensils. 

The other parts of the unit (bedroom, shower, & entryway) were also nice and up to standards, with a couple minor issues with things coming off/loose. I would say to also be sure and look around the unit/explore before you move in... we almost entirely missed spotting the garbage underneath the sink. 

All in all though, it was a great stay at a great place/location and a great price!"
719233,4211719,2013-04-19,3843024,Alana And Gary,"For our recent stay at Nick's we solely dealt with Nicole. Communication was excellent. Our arrival and departure was very easy and hassle free. The location felt safe and was reasonably close to downtown Seattle which enabled us to walk to most places. The apartment isn't the Ritz and is probably best described as ""A single guy friends apartment"". It had everything we required. We would happily stay at Nicks again."
719233,4242491,2013-04-22,4256385,Rose,"Nick was great in communication beforehand. We didn't actually meet Nick when we were there, but Nicole was super sweet and very helpful checking us in. The apartment was exactly as described, except I don't think the description/map do justice to how fantastic this location is! Google maps can't capture the amount of awesome stuff that's within an easy walk of this location. If Nick were to provide a comprehensive list of the great cafes, bars, restaurants, shops, etc. within a five-minute walk, it would probably fill the entire airbnb page. You'll just have to book a visit here to see for yourself. "
719233,4318221,2013-04-27,3430155,Linda,"We wanted a cheap and easy place to stay for one night in Seattle. This place was in a very convenient location, right off the freeway in downtown Seattle and close to bars and restaurants in Capitol Hill. The apartment building and apartment itself were a little dingy. Apartment 307 was located in the back corner down a dark hallway. It faces the back lots and alleys between neighboring buildings. The apartment has low ceilings, poor lighting and a cramped layout. I don't know how anyone might live there for more than a few nights but it served our purposes. Generally, it was clean. We didn't use the kitchen. The bathroom was pretty clean except the spots on the ceiling. Nicole was nice and responsive. We got lucky with parking and found a spot a block away on Melrose between Denny and Olive Way, as Nick recommended."
719233,4337211,2013-04-29,5282562,Preeti,Great location.  Place is small but the location makes up for that. Has everything you need. Very nice bed and very  comfortable. Clean. 
719233,4449410,2013-05-06,5550926,Alexandria,"I loved this place. Quiet complex, ridiculously good location (walkable to pretty much everything I wanted to go to), lovely to come back to at the end of the day. It's nothing fancy, but it does the job. "
719233,4502392,2013-05-09,5023564,Nick,"My wife and I had a great stay at Nick’s flat in Seattle. It really is in a great location, within easy walking distance of the city centre. On arrival we were a bit surprised by the outwards appearance of the apartment block which reminded us both of our student housing at University (rather austere). However the flat is really nice and my wife and I used the kitchen often to cook food from the farmers market (a must). The local area has some great cafés, bars and restaurants so you’re never stuck for somewhere to go to close by after a long day of sightseeing. We didn’t meet Nick but thanks to Nicole for all her help. 
With regard to things to do in Seattle, the Space Needle is fun but right next to it you have the Chihuly Glass Garden which is definitely worth a visit; it’s truly astounding and beautiful. It’s right next to the Space Needle so make sure to get the group entry ticket for them both. 
If you don’t mind jokes, music and water then you must ride the ducks. The amphibious buses take you around Seattle then into the lake! Our driver was hilarious!! Seattle isn’t huge so these tours gave us a really good look at the city which we then continued to discover on foot.  
This is all we managed to cram into our two day trip. We had a great time and I hope you do too.
"
719233,4521762,2013-05-10,2442646,Albert,"Nick's rental apartment served our needs well, during our 24-hour stay in Seattle.  We needed to be able to walk to Downtown as well as to Seattle Center, and the location, being one point of the triangle,  worked fine for us.  All the essentials are there, including the basics for a simple breakfast (such as dry cereals)  and the bed was comfortable to sleep on.  The building is close to highway I-5, but this unit is tucked away such that the traffic sound did not disturb us. The building itself is quiet, and we never
heard any noise from others in the building.  We had no problem getting keys and had excellent communication with Nick and his helper Nicole.  Overall this was a good, practical choice which served our needs well.  Many thanks to both Nick and Nicole!
"
719233,4560629,2013-05-13,916097,Timothy,Nick's apartment was nice and clean and very close to the downtown area. We enjoyed our stay. It was a great price for what you get.
719233,4631851,2013-05-16,4810130,Kristian,Great place! The location is awesome and it's the perfect size. Definitely would stay here again. 
719233,4647681,2013-05-18,5651765,Kristen,"This apartment was very convenient to all Seattle sites we were looking to see. The apartment was clean and had enough space for 2 people. 
I only wish there was a little more communication about when to pick-up and drop-off the key and where. Other than (email hidden) was a fabulous stay."
719233,4676444,2013-05-20,5454139,Jennifer,"The apartment was exactly as described, exactly what my Dad and I needed for a weekend visit to Seattle, no frills. Nicole was super accommodating and responsive when it came to information and keys. This is a reasonable option for 2-3 people with the futon couch."
719233,4773177,2013-05-25,5970702,Bridget,Nicole was SO helpful!  This is a great apartment in an amazing location.
719233,4906767,2013-06-01,4282068,Ngan,"The apartment is a bit old and not very clean but it has perfect location. It is very close to downtown and all public transportation. There is also a grocery store right around the corner, making your life much more easier. If you do not mind a rather old apartment and opt for the location and the price, this is a great place for a short stay"
719233,5224310,2013-06-19,4605929,Yvonne,"We spent 4 days in Seattle. Prior to our arrival, we had very nice contact with Nicole. Nicole explained everything to us (TV, cooker, frontdoor, etc.) and gave us great recommendatons where we can find tasty food and drink in the neighbourhood. Very much recommended is Linda`s Tavern in 707 E Pine St  Seattle, WA 98122, if you like a cozy and Little bit crazy place to drink a beer or two in the evening.

The Apartment is cozy and well located to explore Seattle. We had nice walks to Pike Place Markt, Pioneer Square and the Waterfront. On our way to the Space Needle we used the Monorail. Busses to downtown departs in the Pine Street, just around the corner.

Furthermore you can use the laundry with washing machines and dryers in the Basement of the Apartment block. They are easy to use if you have enough quarters. 

We can recommend this apartment. Thumbs up for Nicole. If we come back to Seattle, we would book again with Nicole."
719233,5249740,2013-06-20,5603400,Eric,The apartment was very clean and cozy. Nicole is awesome and was very very helpful!!! It was great for two people with the pull out Futon bed and the area was great. I would definitely stay here again!
719233,5311393,2013-06-24,5904850,Mio,This was first time to vist Seattle and also used Airbnb. Nick and Nicole are very helpful. The apartment was bit old but very cozy and comfy. The location is super safe! You can stay just like own house. I love Seattle so much and I'm believe to stay there next time. Thanks for all.  
719233,5357957,2013-06-25,7038429,Brent,"Small private cozy apartment located in the perfect location. Loved it, will definitely stay there next time I'm in Seattle"
719233,5395624,2013-06-28,5969595,Josh,Quiet studio in Seattle that was a great location for being able to experience Seattle by foot. We hardly took the Sound or the bus. 
719233,5554292,2013-07-06,4967102,Jeffrey,"We came from Orlando, to Seattle.  We had never used Airbnb before or stayed with Nick.  Nichole greeted us and the stay was lovely.  It was everything we expected and would enjoy staying there again.  I would also suggest it to anyone who is visiting Seattle"
719233,5674257,2013-07-11,6003625,Katrina,"Overall this was not a bad place to stay. The location was really convenient for downtown Seattle activities and there were quite a few coffee shops and restaurants within a few blocks of the apartment. If you're a neat freak I wouldn't suggest this place, it was older and not as clean as a hotel would be. It's also quite a bit smaller than I anticipated from the photos. Still, the price is fair and it worked for us for just a couple of nights. We basically only used the place to shower and sleep and it worked well for that,"
719233,5751708,2013-07-15,5356437,María,Good place to explore Seattle and return to sleep. Close to bars and restaurants.  Nicole answers all your questions right away. 
719233,5915008,2013-07-22,2448481,Kelly (Kathleen),"My daughter and I had a nice one-night stay in Apt 307. Nicole was great, friendly, kept in contact with us and met us at the property, walked us through the apartment and explained things, gave me a tip on nearby free parking, and made clear she was available if we needed her or had questions. The apartment itself is comfortable, safe, clean and well-appointed with all the basics. Would stay again! Thanks!"
719233,5968705,2013-07-24,2648297,Dylan,"Nice place to stay... If you r under 40~ no bus needed to anywhere downtown:)
Fit in 3 ppl with one king size and a foldable sofa.
It was perfect for me :)
You can have your own kitchen to cook anything you want.
Laundry at the basement which is very convenience even to have a long vacation in Seattle.

Book it and enjoy your stay :)"
719233,6103426,2013-07-30,446426,Krista,"This modest apt is in such a great location - 15 minute walk to Link Light Rail (for airport), 15 minutes to Pike Street Market, short walk and monorail ride to Seattle Center, plus tons of great restaurants very nearby (thai, vegetarian, pastry shops, sandwich shops, wine bars, etc). The apt has all the essentials you'll need if you plan to be out on the town during most of your stay. 
Nicole (on site person) was great with communication and took care of an issue very quickly. 
Not terribly clean, and be ready for late night noise (it is located in Capital Hill, after all. there was a music video being shot at nearby Dick's Drive In our first night! helicopter noise well into the night).
Overall, a great deal and super great location! Would definitely stay there again."
719233,6160295,2013-08-01,5610502,Paulette,"The apartment is very convenient for accessing many places in the city.  Excellent restaurants were just two or three blocks from the place.  Although I thought I'd hear a lot of noise from the highway,  it was quiet.  I did not get to meet Nicole, but she was really good with getting back to me quickly when we had a key situation.  I would gladly stay there again.  Alas, I recommend reading the notes in the binder thoroughly, it was as we were leaving that we discovered there was a cushion for the futon in the closet which would have made sleeping on the futon much more comfortable."
719233,6309965,2013-08-07,7613886,Caitlyn,"Most things with staying in this apartment didn't go smoothly, but I feel like that was probably an anomaly based on the other reviews for this place, so I'll share my experience, but with the note that this was probably just a fluke.
I had contacted Nicole prior to the date to see if we could leave our luggage in a storage unit because we would be getting into seattle before check in (3pm) and she agreed, which was very nice. The keys to the storage unit were in the lockbox, as promised, but when we came back, the keys to the unit were not there at 3pm. We waited outside for 15 minutes before a neighbor came down to give us the keys, but also to tell us that the apartment wasn't ready and to come back. When we did get in (about 20 minutes later), there was a tiny amount of TP, and when I asked Nicole for some, she implied that there had been plenty, and I had to insist there wasn't. She then brought some, but mistakenly left it at another unit, and insisted that she brought some to us until she figured it out. So, some awkward interactions and a little sense of unreliability, but I've had way worse experiences at hotels, so I took it in stride.
Regarding the place, it is FANTASTICALLY located. We saved about $120/night on this versus staying in a hotel nearby, for which we were grateful. This is definitely just a crash pad, though. I wouldn't choose this if you were planning to cook at all. The Roku with netflix is also an excellent touch though, if you do stay in! "
719233,6554212,2013-08-17,6105963,Christopher,The apartment was perfect for what we needed.  It is centrally located and easy to find.  Nicole assisted us with check in and couldn't have been more helpful.  She also gave us very helpful advice when asked.  I look forward to staying here again!
719233,6697396,2013-08-21,3475361,Briana,"Nick's place was really convenient. Close to most attractions in Seattle. Perfect for what I needed, exactly as advertised, easy check in and out.  It is an older building/apartment but I knew that going into it. Nichole was very nice and very helpful! Thanx guys!!"
719233,6725611,2013-08-22,3041495,Sage,"Nick's place was just what we were looking for - simple, clean, and in a great location. The caretaker, Nicole, was extremely communicative and patient during our quick and hectic stay. It was a great first experience using Airbnb and everything worked out fine!"
719233,6782979,2013-08-25,7140337,Angela,"Fab little spot to stay - just a 10 min walk to the shopping district and Pike market and so close to loads of really cool trendy little bars and restaurants in capitol hill . Nicole was so  helpful and fast to respond with ideas and suggestions on where to go that it made our trip a nice smoooth one and she was really helpful on any questions we had. The flat was really cure with everything we needed including one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in!  Nice safe neighbourhood ina great location, lovely clean falt - just what we wanted and well worth the money - Thanks Nick and nicole!"
719233,6868311,2013-08-28,2534424,Ludovic,"This apartment is well situated, close to all attractions of Seattle, so ideal for tourists. There are also many coffee shops and restaurants in the neighborhood. "
719233,7099498,2013-09-06,5567420,Joan,"a small but efficient apartment very near downtown Seattle.
If you have a car parking is tricky but it is a great area near the Space needle!"
719233,7122108,2013-09-07,6866363,Clayton,"My girlfriend and I did a long weekend in Seattle, staying at Nick's place on Thursday and with friends the remainder of the weekend. The apartment is perfect for those traveling and looking to explore the city: great location, walking distance to local coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and steps away from downtown Pike Place area. The apartment itself was very clean and comfortable with every amenity needed. Nicole was an amazing host in providing prompt responses to questions regarding traveling to Nick's apartment and the surrounding area. She also allowed us to use the apartment's storage unit for our luggage after we checked out so we didn't have to lug it around the city while waiting on our friends to meet us. We will definitely stay here again when in the area. Thanks so much, Nicole!!!"
719233,7158609,2013-09-09,862738,Maya,Nick's place was great. Easy walk to downtown and great local bars. My boyfriend and I will definitely rent this place again next time we're in Seattle.
719233,7217804,2013-09-11,7157137,Kv,"Great apartment just outside of downtown, and right in the Cap Hill neighborhood. It was perfect for exploring the city over the weekend. "

719233,7574397,2013-09-25,5678576,Philip,The apartment is simple but comfortable.  I recently visited for ten days.  The location is super if you need to take mass transit.  Walk a block and find a bus to downtown and beyond in minutes. Considering the location the place is remarkably quiet. The bed is very comfortable but the futon not so much. The kitchen could use some upgrading but you can make do even without a microwave and toaster.  Not fancy but I felt at home after a long day of seeing the sights. Convenient market around the corner.
719233,7642294,2013-09-28,2889176,Dima,Nick's apartment is a good place for staying in Seattle in a walking distance to downtown. Check-in and check-out were easy and the apartment itself was clean and comfortable.
719233,8038949,2013-10-14,7367186,Hannah,"The apartment has a great location, it was in the heart of Capital Hill and is a close walk to downtown. It was clean, homey and comfortable. I would stay here again! "
719233,8148220,2013-10-18,6706330,Kay-Kay,"The apartment was exactly as expected! Nicole was so helpful with helping find parking for our car. We were there for a conference at the Washington Convention Center, and the location was perfect for this! I would definitely stay here again in the future!"
719233,8325228,2013-10-26,7631203,Joshua,"This place is great! A nice, quiet apartment that was clean and well-kept. Nicole handled all of the check-in process and was extremely friendly and available if there were problems. 
The place is close enough to everything that I pretty much walked all over. Great restaurants and coffee shops in one direction. Westlake (and a 2-minute monorail ride to the Space Needle!) and Pike Place Market in the other.
The Roku was great so I could have Netflix on when I was in the apartment. And the full kitchen was great for morning coffee and such. 
I'll definitely check this place out again next time I'm in Seattle!"
719233,8425601,2013-10-30,6708320,Emma And Loren,"The apartment was in a good location, and was relatively clean. there were good kitchen supplies for basic meals and a large fridge. our check-in wasn't a fantastic experience as the directions provided to make our way to the apartment via public transit were incorrect, and we were left instructions and keys for a different room to the one we booked (we luckily figured it out after a desperate 30 mins of not understanding why the keys didn't work) but other than that, it was fine. thank you."
719233,8479236,2013-11-02,8329049,Nele,The apt is perfekt for two persons and in a great location to explore the Pike Place Market and Capitol Hill. 
719233,8615072,2013-11-08,9580715,Bre,"This apartment was perfect for myself, my fiancé, and my 4 month old daughter. It was conveniently close to various restaurants. Though it was difficult going up 3 flight of stairs with luggage and a stroller, we have nothing to complain about. It was well equipped and made our stay in Seattle like we were at home. Made our time there the best it could be! "
719233,8848568,2013-11-21,147318,Alexander,"If you're looking for an affordable stay, Melrose Court Apartment is a great value option. Well-kept inside the apartment, and with everything you need. The location is awesome too. Our host was not able to meet us, but the key was easily gotten from the lockbox.

My only feedback is that the smoke detector needed its batteries replaced, and it didn't work when I tested it."
719233,8882787,2013-11-24,3541543,Thien 'Tang',"Nick wasn't around to greet us, but the location was great otherwise. Our group just walked everywhere, and it just was a great place to stay. A few blocks away from Pikes Market also walking distance to the needle. Just for warning, if you have a car.... don't have a car... parking can be a bit expensive. There is overnight parking right around the corner if you do have a car."
719233,9014167,2013-12-02,8008409,Irene,"The apartment at Melrose Court Apartment is situated in the perfect neighborhood. You will be within walking distance of bars, restaurants and pike place market. If I were to return to Seattle, I would gladly stay here again. Thanks, Nick!"
719233,9081689,2013-12-05,1131819,Claire,"The location of the apartment is great - everything we needed was walking distance (great restaurants, shopping, etc). Parking was a challenge, though. Luckily we found a spot on the street that was free and unlimited. Everything else was 2 hour limit, or expensive above-ground lots that only let you pay for 12 hours at a time. The basics were provided. I would suggest bringing your own towels as there were only two bath towels available. Overall, the apartment was a decent place to hang our hats for our short trip enjoying Capitol Hill. "
719233,9209283,2013-12-13,10512916,Matt,"Great location, nicely furnished, and comfortable.  Walking distance to just about everything.  Parking takes a little bit of time but you can find spots that have no restrictions if you look for them (The city provides a map online of parking restrictions by street).  Wifi was hit or miss so plan accordingly...Would definitely stay here again.  "
719233,9282791,2013-12-18,7119677,Mariano,"Great apt! Its just like the pictures, very comfortable and well located!  With two friends spend a couple of nights in Seattle and this apt was a great experience. We didn't meet Nicole but she was lovely attending our requests and doubts, and even she resolve us a problem that we have in very short time, definitively I will consider this apt if I return to Seattle. Super recommendable"
719233,9734020,2014-01-07,4367675,Rob,"A clean and basic apartment in an excellent part of town. Not a bad Seattle base for a short stay. Certainly good for the money.

The bed was comfortable and the shower was good. The space heaters all worked and got the apartment warmed up quickly.

Just two quibbles:

1. I had a late check-in and had been given self-check-in instructions. I successfully retrieved the keys from a lock-box but was rather alarmed when the keys wouldn't open the door! I'd mistakenly been sent the instructions for Unit 107 instead of 307. To be fair, I should have read the AirBNB page more thoroughly so the mix-up was half my own fault. Nicole (who lives on-site) acted quickly and sent the correct instructions when I messaged her through AirBNB from a nearby bar. Phew!

2. The main WiFi connection was not accessible and the backup connection was weak. I had to sit in one particular spot to use it and it still kept cutting out. I managed to do the most important things like checking into my next flight but the idea of using something like NetFlix or Skype, I'm afraid, would not have been possible. 

A really great thing about this apartment is the location. Capitol Hill has lots of good bars, coffee shops and breakfast places."
719233,9817278,2014-01-12,10311468,Stefan,"I had a good time at Nick's place. Even though I never actually saw anyone, handing over the key and getting access to the apartment was very well organized and worked absolutely fine. The apartment itself has most amneties you will need and an extremly comfotable bed! We also enjoyed the Netflix account which is perfect for some relaxed evenings. The location was right in between Capitol Hill and Downtown - which made it easy to walk to nearby venues. As the ad mentioned, parking really is a problem. However I can only recommend this place - thx again!"
719233,9898012,2014-01-18,9967340,Michael,"Stayed here with a friend for an event being held at the Convention Center. This location was super easy to walk to/from Downtown, and we didn't have any problems.

When we arrived, there were a few things we requested from Nicole, and she was able to get them to us almost immediately, fantastic response.

Next time I'm in Seattle, I'll be checking if this space is available again. :)"
719233,9938838,2014-01-20,30942,Spencer,"Check-in was easy, just met at the door and handed over they key. Apartment was pretty much as expected. Not the nicest finishing, but very functional and fair for the price. Only small issue was that we had to call and ask for more sheets for the futon.

Overall, I was happy with the apartment."
719233,10244652,2014-02-09,7352810,Norman,"I booked this place for two weeks while traveling by myself for business, and thought it was a fantastic deal. The apartment is tidy and clean, exactly as it appears in the photos. The location is very convenient to downtown and Capitol Hill; I walked to Pioneer Square every day. Getting here from the airport is easy; you can take the light rail to Westlake and then walk right up the hill to get there in about 10 minutes. Nicole was right on time, communicative and helpful every time we corresponded. Basically, I couldn't be happier with the experience and will definitely try to book again next time I travel to Seattle."
719233,10361067,2014-02-16,5052664,Colette,"This apartment was exactly what I was looking for - clean, simple, in a great neighborhood (Capitol Hill) and walkable to downtown. Very comfortable for one but would work well for a couple as well. No complaints about this, would definitely stay at Nick's place again next time I visit Seattle. A great alternative to the high-priced, impersonal hotels. "
719233,10509585,2014-02-23,1567124,Zachary,"This is a perfect place to stay if you're attending a conference at the Washington State Convention center!  It's less than a 10 minute walk and in just the right location between the downtown shops and Capitol Hill's wealth of amazing restaurants and bars.  We were in town for a conference and were able to have easy access to our place throughout the day, as well as a short walk home if we wanted to go out in Capitol Hill after a long day of talks.  I would recommend the Pine Box, which has amazing beer and is literally 2 buildings from the Melrose Court Apartments!  Nick and Nicole were great hosts and we wouldn't hesitate to host them at our place in Portland!"
719233,10673689,2014-03-03,8649849,Benjamin,"Great apartment. Easy check in. Perfect location, especially if you like pie (Pie Bar is right around the corner, among many other great food and drink places). Internet worked 99% of the time, heating worked wonderfully. Clean bathroom. Kitchen is functional. Bed was comfy. Don't sit down too hard on the futon or you'll get a bar where it hurts. 

Overall, way better value and experience than almost any hotel I've stayed in. Highly recommended."
719233,10776007,2014-03-07,4782292,Nicholas,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this great little apartment on our 4 day trip to Seattle. After our flight, we took the train into town and was dropped off at Westlake Center, from there we walked to the apartment. Took us about 20 minutes to walk and it would have been very easy to take a cab. 

Once we got there we had a little problem with the keys, but our contact was very close by that it took no time at all to get the correct key and get in the building. 

The apartment is small but definitely got the job done! A living room, a hallway kitchen, and a bedroom with an attached bath. The living room has a tv, local tv channels, a Roku and a DVD player. During the trip we ended up just watching the regular tv channels. We did bring our laptop and use the wifi that was provided. 

Since we had a kitchen, and we love to cook breakfast, we went grocery shopping and got eggs and bacon to cook every morning. The one thing I would suggest if you're going to cook on the stove top is open the window in the living room up, and the window in the bedroom to make sure the fire alarm doesn't go off. We had the alarm go off every time we cooked but the windows definitely helped. 

The bed was great, I believe it was a double size bed. Plenty of blankets. Also the bathroom is small but has great storage. Enough shelving for all your toiletries, there was body wash and shampoo in the shower. My girlfriend and I are both pretty tall, her at 5'10 and me at 6'1, the shower head was a little short. The shower head was probably around 5'8. We laughed about it and enjoyed the hot showers anyway. 

About the neighborhood, what a great place!! The apartment is right in Capital Hill where there are bars and restaurants. We literally walked the whole area our first night and passed so many places. Seattle I believe is known for the boutique style restaurants, and we definitely found this on Capital Hill, but we ate at the Walrus and Carpenter near Ballard and would definitely recommend going there or to the area to find some great food! It's worth whatever the cost of the transportation to get there. 

We also walked from the apartment to the Seattle Center which was a little far, but definitely do-able. 

We would love to thank everyone who took care of us! The communication was great and the place was clean and very inviting. Thanks for everything and we would definitely stay there again if we ever planned a trip to Seattle again! "
719233,10822365,2014-03-09,9448329,Dena,"We had a great stay at Nick's apartment and it was in such a great location. We were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go downtown. If you don't feel like walking all day or can't, there are also plenty of modes of transportation nearby. We took the light rail from the airport and walked the rest of the way- it was super easy. Didn't get to meet Nick or Nicole, but Nicole was readily available for any help that we needed. I will definitely come back whenever I am in town. "
719233,10926259,2014-03-13,8397138,Kristina,"The check in process here left a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. I often think of airbnbs as a personable experience where you are renting from the owner of the apartment. Here there are 4+ people involved in the management of the apartments at Melrose Court, leaving plenty of room for miscommunication and errors in check in. In my case, I asked to store my luggage before check in as I had to check out of my conference hotel by 11 am. I was told that the apartment would actually be ready for check in at 11am. When I arrived, the keys were not there. When I was eventually let into the apartment (by some random man who watched me struggle with 2 suitcases up 3 flights of stairs without offering to help), it was evident that the place had not yet been cleaned. Check in was not smooth. Once the apartment was finally cleaned, it was fine. I don't have much to add that hasn't already been said, except maybe to say that there is no corkscrew, should you fancy a bottle of wine. "
719233,11239681,2014-03-26,1779651,Santi,"I recommend this place without reservations. The apartment is very centrally located, within walking distance of the market (about 15 mins) and all the hotels and convention centers, so very convenient for conferences etc. 
The place is comfy and functional, bit enough for 2 people for sure. 
Both Nick and Nicole were super friendly and helpful. I felt at home and would definitely stay again if I go back to Seattle. I hope I will because I loved the city!"
719233,11341628,2014-03-31,2990595,Jessica,"We spent an awesome 6 days in a beautiful location within Seattle.  From the apartment, you are not only within walking distance of the Washington Convention Center and Pike Place Market but also all of the cool shops and restaurants of Capitol Hill.  We spent all day just walking around and exploring (the best way to see a city, in my opinion).  When it came to the cleanliness of the apartment, I believe that the bed could use some new sheets.  We spent our first night doing laundry at the local laundromat due to the sheets and pillowcases having some hair and other foreign substances on them.  However, after we washed and dried the bedding, it seemed that they had merged and became one with the sheets.  *Side Note: I really appreciated that there were extra sheets/ pillowcases/ pillows/ blankets provided in the dresser, though we didn't see them until after we did the laundry* Though I didn't meet Nicole (who helps manage the apartment), communication was quick and she was able to see to providing us a storage space for our bags after checking our and prior to our flight back home.  Other than that, I think that this apartment is great and comfortable for two people who want to be in the center of the city and experience it all. "
719233,11541721,2014-04-07,5642190,Christine,"The photos are slightly deceiving. It looks a lot brighter and newer in the photos, but regardless our stay wasn't bad. There was an old/mildew smell and the bathroom could look cleaner. We stayed here for two nights so I don't really mind. 

Also, Nicole sent us directions for the wrong apartment number so for 5 minutes we tried to get into an already occupied unit. Luckily, we called her and she directed us to the appropriate unit. 

On the bright side, the location was very ideal. Easy walk downtown to Pike Market and also close to many bars/restaurants up the hill. "
719233,11753804,2014-04-14,6263874,Amara,"The location is perfect: halfway between downtown and Capital Hill with a pinball bar and pie shop just around the corner. Be sure to pack comfy shoes because you'll be climbing up and down hills. The apartment itself is an Ikea special: sparse, yet adequate, furnishings. It's rather dark and all windows look out to concrete walls. Internet was spotty at best. We never met Nicole (who manages several of these in this apartment building for Nick, I guess) but she was easy to communicate with. "
719233,11845640,2014-04-16,9139033,Jennifer,"My friends and I had a great time in Seattle at Nick's place. It was quiet and pretty comfortable. Located centrally to everything we wanted to see. We walked everywhere! The only problem we had was the internet connection didn't work. But the TV in the apartment had a pretty sweet setup with Pandora. There were three of us that stayed and it was fine for one night, but I think anything after that might get claustrophobic. Getting in the apartment was super easy and there was a nice courtyard we sat in at night. "
719233,11893006,2014-04-18,13074807,Helen,It was a clean and efficient apartment with a big fridge and comfortable king size bed.  The Roku player was a nice addition since we had a Netflix account. The location of the apartment is the best part. It's right downtown and super close to many things like Pike Place Market!
719233,12280313,2014-04-28,12794361,Daniel,Overall we had a good stay. The place was clean when I arrived and it was super convenient to the convention center which was exactly what we needed. They even left a useful binder that had good information about the area and about the apartment.
719233,12709804,2014-05-09,8082534,Kira,"Perfect location - walkable distance to downtown and the Space Needle and tons of great bars and restaurants right on the doorstep in Capitol Hill. The apartment is basic, but adequate, and as shown in the photos. The check-in and -out process was very easy and Nicole was very responsive."
719233,12832808,2014-05-12,13865230,Tyler,"So when my wife wanted to go to Seattle for her birthday/mother's day weekend I knew that it was going to cost me an arm and a leg in lodging alone. So after trying to find a hotel close to Pikes Market and the waterfront the only place was a hotel for $135.00 per night and horrible customer reviews. I was lost, but then I remember airbnb. I went on and found exactly what I was looking for. 

Our stay at Nick’s apartment was amazing. This was such a great and clean place to stay in the city of Seattle. The apartment was exactly want our little family of three needed. Such a welcoming place with a furnished kitchen, comfortable bed, roomy living room and everything you need to enjoy your time. It was very close to Pikes Market and all the great things that Seattle has to offer. 
The neighborhood of Capital Hill was amazing. Capital Hill is so diverse and is bursting with so many wonderful things it’s really hard to explain. The people are nice, the food is excellent and the area just makes you want to move there and just live life different from the norm. 
I would come back here again and again. Nick was a great host and had everything that we needed to know in his itinerary. We never say him, but I was comfortable knowing that if we needed anything that it would happen if we just asked. 

The only thing that was an headache was the parking. And that is not something that Nick can control. You will just have to find a place to park and hope that you don't need to leave. We stayed at a paid parking lot: 
The Salvation Army Lot - Parking Lot
Diamond Parking Services LLC
1101 Pike Street
Seattle, WA 98101
(location id 200113)

and used the app ""CalltoPark"" to keep paying for our spot. Its not a long walk to the apartment and it was a God send when we found it. But other than that it was EXCELLENT!!!! 
  
"
719233,12933201,2014-05-14,14887761,Sam,"The apartment is extremely conveniently located to both Capitol Hill and downtown but pretty small. This was a great launching point for our stay as we were without a car and relied on walking. The apartment is nicely appointed. Although it is small, its perfectly fine for two people. Internet was spotty but Netflix on the TV made up for it. While we didn't ever meet Nick or Nicole, she was quick to answer our call when we had confusion getting our key (our fault, not hers!). "
719233,13128538,2014-05-20,11052997,Paul,"Nice experience. Good neighborhood, centrally located. "
719233,13269806,2014-05-24,11963939,Darren,"The place was incredibly clean, had all amenities as listed and everything worked great. Cozy and comfortable little apartment. 

Neighborhood is fantastic and felt safe at night. Easy walking to many restaurants, coffee shops, stores, bars, etc. and to the middle of downtown. Walkable (less than 1 mile) to Pike's Place Market and waterfront. 

Nicole (liaison for owner Nick) made everything super easy. She was great. Easy to get in and out. We never met in person but did not have to with convenient key arrangement.

I would definitely stay here again if needing a place near heart of downtown. Highly recommended."
719233,13553645,2014-05-30,2652068,Enzo,"With mostly utilitarian decor the space has the main plus of being located a few blocks from Broadway in the Capitol Hill district, and being fully self-contained. The communication with the host's assistant was prompt and courteous. It was a last minute booking and I was grateful for that. There are more romantic locations. This one is practical and functional at a fairly reasonable price. Be aware that there is a $30 cleaning fee and $20 service fee in addition to the stated nightly price of the space. This amount is not per night but for the duration of the stay. The hot water pressure was iffy (the apartment is in an older building and on the top floor)."
719233,13680273,2014-06-02,14565883,Eleanor,"My parents and I stayed in this apartment for a quick weekend in Seattle, including a show at the Paramount. The location was awesome and the place had everything we needed to be comfortable. "
719233,13915147,2014-06-08,10868231,James,"We had a great experience! Nicole was great with communicating directions and procedures, and upon arrival, everything was just like we expected - no surprises! The location was ideal for us. We were attending a conference at the Westin downtown, which was less than a ten minute walk, but we were also within easy walking distance of some great restaurants/bars in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. Considering how pricey Seattle is, I thought the apartment was a great value and would stay there again if visiting."
719233,14115461,2014-06-12,117159,Robin,Very responsive host.  Great neighborhood.  Apartment clean and quiet but shabby.  Building looks like a former motel so the hallways are in an outdoor courtyard -- dirty and not an experience I would repeat.
719233,14167242,2014-06-13,16301559,John,My brothers and I stayed at Nick's place for one night while visiting Seattle. It was in a great location for us since we wanted to go out to the Capitol Hill bars. There were plenty of bars and restaurants within walking distance. Everything was clean and the move in process was very easy. Thanks again!
719233,14342625,2014-06-17,13530151,Melissa,"This was my first time using airbnb and I was a little hesitant. However, the reservation process was clear and easy so I was excited for my stay. The apartment location was great. Very close to downtown Seattle...walking distance, actually. I was pretty disappointed when I walked into the bedroom and bathroom. It looked like someone had just rolled out of bed. The pillows were smashed and spread out throughout the bed. The comforter and blankets were just balled up. Gross. The towels in the bathroom were also hung like someone had just used them...just thrown on the towel rack. My cousin and I actually made a Target run to buy towels and a couple throw blankets because that's how uneasy we felt. Very inconvenient when you're on vacation. No one wants to take time to go buy supplies. Would we stay here again? Probably not. "
719233,14540543,2014-06-21,10870377,Joy,"Host was very responsive and gave great instructions on the process.  Answered all my questions quickly and thoroughly.

This is an excellent location in Seattle.  It may seem like the area is a little run down but this is really the charm of an older part of downtown/capitol hill corridor Seattle.  Loved it!! Lots of great restaurants nearby, easy walking distance to both downtown and Capitol Hill.  This is really a very safe and cool part of (email hidden)t pretentious or uppity, the Seattle I love!"
719233,15087611,2014-07-02,5904850,Mio,"The apartment I was staying is great neighborhood, good restraints, coffee shops, all you want are available in few minutes. Nick is very kind and helpful all the time, response quickly, great owner what I ever know. "
719233,15501101,2014-07-10,237776,Emily,"The place is cute, clean and convenient. Nick gives very clear instructions in checking in to make it easy!"
719233,15628161,2014-07-13,1788830,Blanca,"If you are looking to stay in a simple, small, but cheap apartment in a great location; then this is the place. The check-in and out process was simple, the host communicated promptly with great instructions on how to get to the location. There are great bars and restaurants all around the apartment. My favorite was Pine Box, they have amazing food! The walk down to Pikes Place and downtown was close. The only negative I would say is that the apartment does need some updates. The bed wasn't the most comfortable, the towels were a bit warn and it sometimes smelled like cigarette smoke. I had the windows open since it was hot during my stay so it must have come from the courtyard. I do recommend the apartment for short stays and only two people. "
719233,16055846,2014-07-21,13046427,Ethan,"Location, location, location! This was my second time up to Seattle to visit my friends who live in Capitol Hill. The apartment was in a great location:  close to Downtown, close to a show we saw at The Paramount, and close to all the great restaurants and bars that Capitol Hill has to offer. I even walked down to Pike Market to meet some other friends, and it took less than 20 min. to walk there.

I wasn't planning on spending a lot of time in the apartment. I was just looking for a clean place to crash and have a clean bathroom. And the apartment satisfied my needs. The apartment is nothing fancy; it's functional and utilitarian. But it was clean. Bed was comfortable and clean to sleep on. Temperature (with windows open) was perfect and cool. Bathroom was clean. Clean towels provided. Enough outlets to charge mine and my friend's electronic devices.

The two negatives were the Wi-Fi and the shower pressure. The Wi-Fi worked only in the living room area and it took a couple tries between the two networks provided to get a decent connection, but once connected, it worked fine for the most part.

The shower pressure was the worst part of the apartment. It was really bad, and it seemed to get worse over our 3-day stay. By the last morning, there was barely a thin stream coming out of the shower head. I don't know if it was a ""low flow"" showerhead that was breaking, or if it was the building, but the shower pressure was definitely a huge negative. However, the water temperature itself was fine. There was always enough hot water, so we could at least get in a hot, albeit minimalist, shower.

Lastly, Nick was great. He left great instructions that were easy to follow (especially on how to obtain the key), and the one problem that I messaged him about, he got back to me in a reasonable and timely manner.

As long as the shower-pressure situation is remedied, and someone is just looking for a clean, functional, basic place to sleep and use the bathroom, and one is looking to be in a great location in Seattle, then I would definitely recommend the apartment."
719233,16203141,2014-07-23,361183,Kate,"Nick/Nicole sent very detailed instructions on how to get into the building and apartment, which was very helpful. The apartment was appointed in a very basic but comfortable way, and it was very conveniently located. We were delighted by the restaurants, bars and shopping within a couple short blocks from the apartment."
719233,16311382,2014-07-25,17570070,Christopher,"Nick/Nicole were very attentive to me and my friend who were visiting Seattle for the first time from NYC. I received prompt confirmation of my reservation within 24 hours of booking at which point Nicole introduced herself and asked me if I had any questions/concerns. Given that it was nearly a month in advance of booking, I didn't have much to say at that point, but it was great to know she was looking out for me already.

Leading up to my visit to Seattle, I received a couple messages from Nicole further confirming my stay even providing easy-to-follow directions to the apartment from the train station as well as providing a check-in time reminder. Given that I had never been to Seattle before, having all this information at hand prior to arriving was much appreciated!

The apartment itself has all the bare essentials that you would absolutely need during your stay in Seattle. It's not a home per se, but more like a hotel at nearly half the cost. Everything that we needed to be comfortable at the apartment was there, so no regrets there at all. Given that we were in Seattle to visit the city, we didn't spend a whole lot of time in the apartment itself. But as a place to rest and stay overnight, it certainly served its purpose. Wouldn't expect more than that given the price.

The building itself is old (as mentioned in the post) and the entrance can be a bit... creepy. But coming from NYC, it's not something I hadn't seen before and didn't really bother me all that much. And certainly not a reason to not stay here if you're just looking for a place to sleep and rest up during your visit. 

The surrounding neighborhood is awesome! So much to do in the Capital Hill neighborhood. The main thoroughfare (Broadway) is merely a 10-15 minute walk from the apartment. On it you'll find a plethora of shops, restaurants, bars and coffee shops. 

Everything is within walking distance of this apartment (downtown shopping, Pike Place, Space Needle, etc.). It's absolutely perfect in that respect and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again! Thanks for a wonderful visit!"
719233,16395339,2014-07-27,510922,Jakob,"Great location but apartment needs work. Couch had a defective leg making it unusable. Wifi was very unstable and did not work most of the (website hidden) did not work at all. Apartment had a strange smell when we where there - and is painted in dark colours, making it an unpleasant place where we did not spend much time. Wrote to host after our arrival regarding wifi, couch and tv but did not receive reply. Overall would not recommend despite the location."
719233,16892970,2014-08-04,15615903,Thomas,"Both Nick and Nicole made us feel welcome and provided a very thorough description of everything.  The apartment was as described except the futon, which we planned to use for our son, was broken.  Although our son had to sleep on the floor, Nicole  had a new hide-a-bed delivered the next day.  The only issue we have is that according to Nicole, she knew about the broken futon before we arrived-we were never informed although we clearly stated in our paperwork that we were arriving with three people.
We are attempting to get some type of adjustment in the rate since the apartment, on the first day, could really only accommodate two people.  "
719233,17139704,2014-08-08,10989065,Jan,"Nick was a good host. Everything was very straightforward. The apartment is in a nice neighborhood with many good pubs and restaurants. Downtown is very near, in a walking distance. The bed was good. The sofa is not what you can see in the fotos. It´s smaller and in combination with the futon not comfortable. I would recommend this apartment for two people sleeping in the big bed. I expected it cleaner.
"
719233,17346049,2014-08-11,16159957,Marlon,"The place is conveniently located within walking distance to downtown Seattle and Pike's Market. That is, if you don't mind walking about a mile. The weather was nice and sunny during my stay,I did not mind walking. The location was perfect, within walking distance to lots of bars and restaurants in the Capitol Hill area.  I had a rental car and was worried about parking, thankfully there was a metered  parking lot withing a few feet away from the building. Be ready to pay top dollar for parking though.

I didn't spend much time at the apartment since I was always out; used it only to shower and sleep. 

Just two minor complaints:  food left over from previous renters left in the refrigerator made me question the cleanliness of the place. But to be fair, the rest of the place did look clean. And second, the internet connection was not stable, no sinal in the bedroom only in the livingroom. 

Overall this is a good place to stay at, I would stay here again."
719233,17637400,2014-08-15,17810960,Johanna,"The apartment is very close to everything in downtown which was important to us. It is basic, but had everything we needed for just one night. Communication with host was easy. "
719233,17824223,2014-08-18,3471228,Amy,"I was actually not able to go due to some last minute conflicts, but Nick/Nicole were very accommodating and allowed my friend to go without me and stay even though the booking was under my name. Review below from my friend who actually stayed there:

Nick provided directions that were easy to follow even for the directionally-challenged.  Apartment located in a great location.  Walking distance to Pike's Market and great restaurants.  Apartment had all basic necessities.  WiFi a bit slow and spotty at times.  Nice place to stay, and not a whole lot to complain about. "
719233,17970710,2014-08-19,14566460,Lucy,"The entire time I communicated with Nicole over email or text. She responded quickly, all the info is in their binder so read it, we where so excited to explore Seattle that we just dropped off our bags and did not come back till late. Realized the next day we still needed to store our bags and did not give Nicole a heads up (needs a day) so storage room was locked but she tried. The location was great we walked to pikes market ~15mins but at night close to an awesome pie bar and other restaraunt  sand bars. The room was as described with a pullout bed for our third person. Was worried about the water pressure as mentioned in other reviews but three of us showered in the am back to back with no issues. "
719233,18234541,2014-08-24,15767712,David,"We were given all information 
key was in lock box anything we asked was answeared"
719233,18539423,2014-08-28,9078343,Lisa,"We did not contact the host for the time we were there, although all contact details were provided if we needed to contact Nicole. 
The unit was in a great part of the neighborhood - as we expected and we were able to walk easily to all attractions, restaurants and bars as needed. Although if you didn't want to walk up the hill home you could easily catch a bus or grab a cab cheaply. 
The unit is in an old apartment block so you need to expect a few musty smells in the common stairwell and at times in the unit. The unit overall was clean and the the bed comfy, but the floor did feel a bit grimy underfoot. Overall the unit was what we were expecting for the price. The location was great. However, if you are wanting a 5 star experience this is not the unit for you. "
719233,19020747,2014-09-05,13497715,Tim,"We enjoyed our stay at the Melrose Court Apartment. The apartment wasn't lavishly appointed, but it was a very good value considering our other options and what we were charged for our stay. The pictures aren't quite accurate, as the futon has now been replaced with a love seat/hide-a-bed combo. The hide-a-bed is only a single, however so bear that in mind. 

Other reviewer's feelings about the internet are accurate, myself and my companions were unable to get internet about 30% of the time. There are two networks available to guests though, so as long as one of the two networks are up, you're connected.

Hot water was no problem, and shower pressure was adequate from what we found. The shower head is quite low though (it sprayed no higher than my neck, standing at 6'1"") so be prepared for that. 

The apartment was ideally located near restaurants and about a 4-5 block walk from the WSCC which was an excellent distance for us and our vacation. 

Host contact was prompt, courteous and professional. 

Parking was available, but quite scarce during the day. We were fortunate in finding a space near the apartment but most areas near are 2 hour only until late, and off street parking can be expensive (20-30 dollars per day, and you have to go and pay it twice. No parking/forgetting).

Overall we enjoyed our stay and we would definitely stay again in the future. "
719233,19084446,2014-09-06,7685438,Wesley,"The place was very clean and in a great location.

No issues and communication went very well. 

"
719233,19173269,2014-09-07,20765556,Jesse,"This place was super convenient, well cleaned, and had everything i needed. The check-in, check out was smooth and I would definitely stay here again.
"
719233,19315963,2014-09-10,11134485,Karen,"This is my second visit with Nick. Great location, clean and comfortable. Easy check-in, check out. Thanks!"
719233,19390088,2014-09-11,19481418,Chris,"I rented this room for my in-laws, who are technologically challenged. Nicole was very helpful and understanding. They loved this place and thoughts it was an excellent location. I can't wait to rent it for myself the next time I am in Seattle."
719233,19518083,2014-09-14,16714019,Christina,"First time using airbnb. Nicole was very responsive and helpful before our arrival which I really appreciated. The day of, I was notified that I would receive a text when the apartment was ready for check in, in case it was ready before 3:00pm as we were a bit stranded it the city. However, I never received a text. The apartment was indeed ready at 3pm but it would have been nice to have received that text either way. She did offer to let us store our bags in the apartment while it was being cleaned but consistent communication would have been helpful. I was told to let Nicole know 24 hours in advance if I needed to use the storage unit after check out. I called and left a voice mail, and texted 3 times (the preferred method of communication) and never got a response over the course of the 24 hours. This was very disappointing as we were looking forward to this service since we were in town for wedding festivities and it was very odd as she had been so responsive before. Had we needed to get in touch with her during our stay for any amenities, we would not have been able to. The lock box for the keys was a nice feature since we could let ourselves in but it was very difficult to use as the black lever you have to push down on is jammed and requires all your strength and multiple attempts. The room was nice enough but located right near a trash room so very smelly when you exit the room. My feet were covered in black dirt from walking on the floors bear foot despite washing them constantly so the floors could use some extra cleaning. There is a coffee pot but no coffee so bring your own. There is no microwave but a stove. There were only two towels for two people and no wash cloths.  One of the towels was still wet when we arrived. Some of the appliances' plugs were fried so we couldn't use them. All in all, it was a decent stay, not great, not bad. I would have expected a little more for the price. It was fine because we weren't staying in much but had we needed to spend a lot of time inside, we would not have been very happy with our stay. "
719233,19773723,2014-09-18,18170319,Devin,Very accommodating.  A hotel-like experience for a much better price in a great location.  There are plenty of nice bars/restaurants within blocks and downtown/main tourist attractions are 1-2 miles away. Nice to have a kitchen to be able to cook fish purchased at Pike's Place!
719233,20005189,2014-09-22,2458065,Angela,"Perfect location - walking distance to downtown, lots of shopping and bars. 
Instructions were clear and place was nice! Host was kind enough to let us put our bags in storage due to a later flight (this was very nice of him). "
719233,20612172,2014-10-02,17579973,Vincent,"The location of the property was very convenient. Close to downtown locations (1-2 miles) but walking distance is subjective. The apartment itself, however, definitely looked better in the pictures. It is a very simple apartment, with a firm bed, and a small kitchen and TV with Netflix. There is a peculiar smell throughout the apartment, which didn't bother me, but definitely bothered my girlfriend who has a more sensitive nose. Buying a candle fixed that problem. The Internet, like others have complained about, was hit or miss. If you're looking for a very simple place at a decent price in a good location then this is it. Don't expect too much when you walk in. Check in and check out was smooth, I picked up the key and dropped it off at the lockbox without having to wait to meet anyone. This was a must for us since we had an early flight to catch. "
719233,20949001,2014-10-08,19233211,Hyonchu,"Location was great with downtown being a 10-15 min walking distance.  Inside was clean and nice. Host left very clear and detailed instructions, and was very accommodating letting us drop off our bags before check-in."
719233,21280750,2014-10-14,16335510,Benji,"The apartment was well located and we could walk everywhere in Seattle easily. 
Everything worked well and was we needed for a base to explore."
719233,21418394,2014-10-17,11770015,Remi,"Rental process, checkin and checkout were very smooth, with the keys in the right place, easy to open with the code to the lock that was provided a few days before.
The apartment is old-ish but clean and apartment building looks like some social housing... Only issue I have to report is the weak wifi signal, just OK in the leaving room but simply inexistant in the bedroom. I sent a message through Airbnb messaging to Nick... still waiting for the reply... Other than that, super location off Pike street. For those who want to travel by car around, there is a Budget/Avis rental place on Pike street, 5 mins away and the apartment is 20 meters away from the Interstate 5 North."
719233,21663794,2014-10-21,17554027,Kimberly,"Nick and Nicole were very accommodating. When we addressed an issue we had towards some stains on the blanket cover, they were quick to resolve the issue and brought us a new blanket immediately. This is a prime location to stay at and is close to many good restaurants, cafe's, and touristy spots. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay in Seattle."
719233,21704406,2014-10-22,11280776,Dan,"Had a nice quick stay at Nicks. The location is great, and the storage room for bags after check out was a huge help. Pretty small for 3 guys, but it worked. "
719233,22040577,2014-10-28,19282903,Jen,Checking in was easy and parking wasn't that bad. The building is older so a little creepy. The apartment is small so two people is definitely more comfortable than the 3 we had. When you open the door to the apartment it is a small living room and a galley style kitchen that leads to a small bedroom and a small bathroom. It filled the need for a place to sleep but wouldn't be a place to hangout. 
719233,22594127,2014-11-10,22200103,Norman,"It was very easy staying at this location. Nick & Nicole sent me all of the instructions on checking in & out, so I actually never really had to contact or meet them once I arrived. The location is great since it's really just a 15 min walk away from the Westlake Station & just a block or 2 away from anything you really need for your stay, like groceries and/or restaurants & bars. 

The space itself is more than enough of what you'd need for a few days stay. It's definitely more affordable than a hotel room. The Wifi signals were choppy at best & I did see a questionable wall outlet that seemed short circuited (burned/melted?) by a previous guest from the portable heater. I did like how they had a Roku set up with Netflix & Pandora though.  Someone mentioned a scent in the apartment, which I think really comes from outside, since the windows were cracked open. A scented candle from the deli a block away helps. I left a new one for the next guest since I finished off the last one. =)

I've already told other friends who are interested in visiting to check on this Airbnb first if available. Thanks for the stay!"
719233,22823893,2014-11-16,8642688,Danielle,"The place was clean, quaint and cozy, and it has everything you could need. The location is hands down superb. It's close to everything and I mean everything, from great restaurants to great pubs to public transportation. Downtown is a hop away, as is the light rail to get to and from the airport(and around Seattle in general).  This made it easier for me to get an any time flight without needing someone to go and pick me up from Sea-Tec. The only down side is the internet connection, as other people have mentioned. It is definitely a hit or miss, but there is Netflix on the tv which made up for it. And if I needed to check emails or anything I usually used my phone itself or used it as a mini-hot spot. Other than that, this is a great place and when I'm back in Seattle I'll be booking here again. "
719233,23329657,2014-11-29,22165524,Woo-Jung,"I really liked the location of Nick's apartment.Nice restaurants, close bus stops, light rail. I was thinking to rent a car to tour Seattle, but I actually did not need to. We walked to the fish market, farmer's market, aquarium, downtown to shop, space needle, children's museum and took a bus to Japanese garden. 
When I stepped in Nick's apartment, I felt fresh. Everything was clean and I felt welcomed. I enjoyed staying there!"
719233,23364206,2014-11-30,21620819,Ah Ram,"I would say it was about 4 out of 10. The location was ok however, there was somewhat issues during this stay. We first struggled to open the lock in front of the gate because it was really stiff. Also we were curios if the house was been cleaned or not because there were some spots on the bed cover as well as dust in between the bed and the wall. We couldn't sleep on the bed so then decided to sleep on the couch. And the house was really cold even though we turned on the heater. Seattle was raining, windy and even snowing during our visit.. This is a truly objective experience from me and my friends, which will be helpful to others in the future. "
719233,23617935,2014-12-06,49993,Courtney,"This was a perfect space for what we needed, and out short stay easy in and out, close to everything! A bit difficult going up the stairs with suitcases but still a nice space! Thanks for letting us stay. "
719233,23884100,2014-12-13,19343543,Perry,Nicks place was the perfect location for me.  Nestled between downtown and capital hill.  For the price this was a great stay.  Thanks Nick
719233,24117481,2014-12-20,21189108,Amber,"It's wonderful to stay at Nick's place!
There is a supermarket within 2min walk that you can buy your daily necessaries! And public transportation is convenient! 
The suit is so warm the decorations is modern and host is so nice! "
719233,24616009,2014-12-31,24843208,Andrew,"I really enjoyed my trip to Seattle, thanks to the amazing location of Nick's apartment, the actual apartment itself, however, was not a big factor in that. If you're looking purely for a place to drop your bags while you're out seeing the city, this is the perfect place for you. The check-in/check-out processes were seamless, and it was clear that Nick/Nicole run their spot as a fluid business. We arrived to a leftover trashbag and dirty dishes, but Nicole was quick to apologize and handled the trash issue for us, which we appreciated. It did make me wonder how much of the ""cleaning crew"" fee was actually being used. The beds were clearly the cheapest possible and were annoyingly squeaky, luckily we spent very little time in the apartment. Overall, the location of the apartment made up for any of the downfalls of the apartment itself."
719233,25012556,2015-01-05,4376723,Evie,"This is apartment is in an absolutely superb location.  We were able to walk to tons of places to eat, shop, dance and drink in Capital Hill.  Pike Place Market is also a quick and fun jaunt.  
We did need a couple things once we settled into the apartment but Nicole was super quick in getting it handled.  The apartment itself has somewhat of a funky, urban feel which was all part of the experience.  Roku was definitely an added bonus to our stay!"
719233,25181885,2015-01-08,25267135,Kenny,"quaint little apartment really close by the city, 3-5 minute uber to and from downtown, pike place etc. 

perfect place for lounging, resting and getting ready for sightseeing

everything was really clean from the sink, bathrooms and couch

nicole did a great job communicating as well, would definitely recommend
"
719233,25348675,2015-01-13,6968853,Callie,"Exactly what I paid for, and then some. I was pretty impressed! This is my second time staying at Nick's, and everything went smoothly. Just a few blocks from Broadway and a downhill walk to Pike's Place. Buses run right by it, too! Parking is a little tricky, but all in all, I wasn't worried about it. Food, coffee, and drinks is great by this complex, so that wasn't hard, either. I'd definitely recommend Nick's place to everybody who needs a weekend getaway!"
719233,25424533,2015-01-15,468964,Simran,"The apartment was clean, centrally located, and parking wasn't as bad as I might have thought. The place is pretty close quarters and not terribly cozy but the location is great so you won't likely spend much time in the house anyway. There was an issue with the hot water heater while I was there and Nick was very quickly able to get me access to another apartment with working hot water. "
719233,25551533,2015-01-19,1270317,Gabriel,"This apartment is in a great location in a very hip area of town.  It is within walking distance to many tourist attractions (walked to Pike's Market for example during my stay) as well as tons of nightlife.  It also is near many convenient places, including a convenience store, a great pie place, and a bar/arcade.  The apartment is a budget apartment, and that's reflected in the price, since I wasn't planning on spending much time in the apartment itself, that worked out great. "
719233,25838288,2015-01-27,22238259,Nicole,"I liked how convenient the check in/out process is with the lock box right outside the door. The reviews don't lie, street parking is really hard but thankfully we only had trouble 1 of the days we were there. And 1 other thing, there was absolutely NO hot water. Other than that, the place was clean, comfortable, and in a great location. Thank you for having us :)"
719233,25939001,2015-01-30,8010603,Robin,"The location was so much better than we expected. We basically walked everywhere - a mile to pike place market, a few blocks to good restaurants and coffee houses. The apartment would have been perfect for two. It needs a new sofa bed for the third person. We had water issue but Nicole and Nick responded quickly."
719233,25965152,2015-01-31,7119177,Thomas,"Great crash pad in a cool location. If you're staying for a day or two, this will be a good spot if you are looking for a night life. If you plan on staying longer, you'll probably want a bigger place. Nick was great and very accommodating. "
719233,26120438,2015-02-03,11675778,Brad,Check in was very easy and communication was great. 
719233,26321754,2015-02-09,16600641,Aaron,"This apartment is the ideal place to stay in Seattle. It's a walking distance to many restaurants and bars, or you can get a 3-5 minute ride to the Space Needle or Pike's Market. So many good restaurants around the area. I think we gained 5 lbs during the 3 days we were there. 

Although the apartment is small, it is cozy and a great place to sleep and shower. The apartment is ideal for 3 people. 

Check-in and check-out process was very simple; just take the key from the lock box to check-in and put it back to check-out. Nick and Nicole are only a text away to answer our questions and concerns. We didn't have any issues, because the place was clean and everything was in working order. 

I would recommend people to stay here! I'll book this place again if I ever go back to Seattle. Thank you, Nick and Nicole!"
719233,26469486,2015-02-13,1550538,Aaron,"Cool place in a great neighborhood. Pretty rustic, but great value. And clean."
719233,26602018,2015-02-16,4660619,Lizette,"The location is very central. Walking distance to anything relevant in that district. The place was equipped with all the basics and more like extra heater and blankets and pillows. I recommend the unit for quiet guests because the complex is pretty quiet itself.  A bag of ice comes in handy as there is not real freezer. Didn't like that they left used shampoo and conditioner in the shower! Didn't smell pleasant, it smelled like wet laundry! Old TV didn't work good. The mattress pad needs to be replaced it looks very old and unsanitary.  "
719233,26956988,2015-02-22,4979767,Roger,"The place was warm and bed was comfortable. Surprisingly quiet, for being right in the middle of town, and close to transportation. plenty of food, coffee, and nightlife options within walking distance, bus close for all others. instructions were timely and clear, the candy was a nice touch, thanks"
719233,27260248,2015-03-01,26220719,Brendon,"I had a great stay in Seattle thanks to Nick and Nicole. Nicole was very helpful during the check in process and ensured we enjoyed our stay. Listing was 100% accurate.

The location was great. Within walking distance of a local grocery store and some awesome bars. I particularly enjoyed the 21-and-over arcade/bar that is literally right around the corner from the apartment.

I would definitely stay here again and I highly recommend this apartment to anyone looking to experience Seattle from a local's perspective. And for the money, this will be the best deal you can find for how perfect the location is."
719233,27381674,2015-03-02,670637,Pablo,"Nick's appartement is perfect and is all we were expecting. The neighborhood is really fun and yet the flat is very quiet and confortable. Nicole who we were in contact for the reservation was really easy to reach. When I go back to Seattle, I'll definitely ask Nick to stay in his flat again !"
719233,27483698,2015-03-05,6258840,Cari,Apartment was in a good location and perfect for my travel needs. If you're wanting easy access to downtown and exploring Capital Hill it's a good spot. 
719233,27765147,2015-03-11,7019848,Jessica,"The location is great - it is so close to everything you could need. The apartment is perfect if you just need a place to sleep and store your things. It is very comfortable and quiet, albeit a little bare bones. I would definitely stay here again."
719233,28017691,2015-03-16,24500052,Erin,The perfect location to everything with Amazing restaurants all around. We spent much of our time in Seattle out and about so we mainly just slept there. The TV is cool because it's adapted to so many different movie and TV show channels. The bed isn't extremely comfortable but it did have a great amount of pillows. Host was very curtious to us while we were checking out. 
719233,28108273,2015-03-17,20283594,Kyle,Very easy to get in and out of.  Nicole made the experience effortless and I didn't mind the stairs one bit.  Had a great trip.
719233,28306887,2015-03-22,26534333,Shane,"I never met Nick or Nicole, but they were always clear and kind with communication.    The neighborhood was alright, not bad for downtown Seattle.  They were quick to respond to any issues we had and the place was clean and workable, especially for the price!  A couple of issues like the only bathroom being right next to the bed and the internet sometimes not working, but overall it's a nice place!"
719233,28448210,2015-03-23,20487427,Samira,"This place worked out great for us! We wanted to go to the Starbucks Roastery and it was five minutes walking distance. The parking wasn't too bad, we ended up paying for about 2 hours of parking since we arrived on a Saturday and then parked on the street for the rest of the trip and walked. Everything was really convenient and it worked great for having 3 people there. Nicole was great, and got back to me pretty quickly. I couldn't figure out how to keep the shower at a ""perfect"" temp, but that wasn't' a big deal. There's a pad for the pull out bed which was really comfortable and it was nice and warm. When we got there we opened the windows it felt like it needed some fresh air, and then we closed them and it was still warm. One way to describe this was: easy, convenient, and efficient. Thanks guys."
719233,28553973,2015-03-26,22698111,Kelvin,"Great place to stay in, apartment was well kempt and equipped with necessary amenities. Thanks!"
719233,29042233,2015-04-03,27238455,Jeremy,"Listing was alright, although I have to admit, the apartment was not quite what we expected. The wifi was absolutely awful. Walkway/outside portions of the building all smelled like smoke. A few minor things could have made the space seem much nicer, such as replacing the rusted fixtures in the bathroom or removing the burnt heater panels. Nicole was great though, very responsive when we had questions. It was also surprisingly quiet for the area, and a fun neighbourhood. All in all it was a good stay, we just felt like the pictures made it seem nicer than it actually was."
719233,29383404,2015-04-07,25476033,Molly,Check in and out was very easy and the apartment was well stocked and furnished. It was within walking distance of everything I needed and had some good food in the area. 
719233,29764884,2015-04-12,6343361,Sam,Nick provided a detailed check in itineary and enabled me to check in a little earlier than expected. The location of the apartment is good and within easy access to buzz of Capitol Hill.
719233,30020503,2015-04-16,24937652,Patrice,"Nick et Nicole nous ont bien informé des démarches à faire pour se rendre au logement, l'axcés et relativement simple à partir du tram-rail,il faut compter 600m à pied. L'emplacement est correct,et calme. L'immeuble n'est pas récent et même surprenant. La surface est bonne pour 3.
- il serait bien de rajouter une passoire pour les pâtes,et 1 ,ou 2 saladiers."
719233,30126687,2015-04-18,13076057,Kimbear,"The best thing about Nick's apartment was the location. It is very central and walkable to lots of restaurants and bars. However, we had a bit of a communication mix-up when we first arrived, which was resolved relatively quickly thereafter. Overall, it was a positive experience."
719233,30444582,2015-04-22,27474984,Kate,"Communications for check in, home use and check out was timely and clear. I felt like I had all the information I needed at the right time. The apartment is quite small and a little musty, but comfortable and safe. The only drawback was the sketchy wifi. The lack of reliable internet access really changed my weekend's productivity. But the location is incredibly central to the heart of downtown and within walking distance of nearly everything we wanted to see. I recommend the apartment and I would stay there again."
719233,30769283,2015-04-27,28090952,Cindy,The appartement was great. Just what we needed en really good located.
719233,31246772,2015-05-03,11996380,Erin,Good location for people wanting to explore Capitol Hill.  No frills accommodation.  Check in and check out was no fuss.  
719233,31509364,2015-05-06,11264318,Joey,"Details on check in were spot on! My GF and i were very satisfied with the stay. I needed to store my bags on check out day for a few hours and Nicole helped make it happen even with late notice. Located walking distance to an arcade bar, night life, shopping, restaurants, and of course Pike Place. "
719233,31814455,2015-05-10,1314071,Samantha,"Like everyone else has said before me, check in was a breeze.  The place was perfect for the three of us.  The location was the highlight.  We were near a lot of cool bars like The Pie Bar and a speakeasy called Knee High Stocking Company.  We were easily able to walk down to Pike Place Market.  We parked in the lot near the Apartment which was a little pricey, but much better than worrying about whether or not we were going to get a ticket.  The place was a little dusty, but nothing to really complain about.  For the price of the place compared to all of the overpriced hotels, this is a steal.  "
719233,31946345,2015-05-12,27039717,Cynthia,"Great location just minutes walk from downtown. 

Checking in and out was very easy and straightforward. 

The apartment itself was basic but adequate, not the kind of place to hang out in for extended periods but if you just need a place to get clean and sleep then it's perfectly fine.

Only real negative of note was the wifi as some others have also mentioned. We had problems with it the whole time and found it basically unusable, probably due to there being no dedicated router in the apartment. 

Communication was mainly excellent and responses usually very quick.
"
719233,32464228,2015-05-18,27226207,Andrew,Couldn't have picked a better place to stay while visiting Seattle. Situated in the perfect neighborhood. The apartment is cozy and clean. Easy to find and get in and out of. Highly recommended. 
719233,32914903,2015-05-23,10546751,Philip,"Although I never got to see the host directly, she was very easy to get in touch with and very helpful. The place was clean and everything worked as expected. I've lived in Seattle before so I knew this was a great location."
719233,33089990,2015-05-25,13308495,Dimo,Place was little outdated but great location and price. Hosts were responsive and accommodating for early arrival.
719233,33390283,2015-05-27,14769065,Regina,"We were looking for a clean and cozy spot to rest/sleep and this place was exactly that. Capital Hill was awesome so we were in a great location. Checking in was a hassle though. The lock box was jammed and my friend had to wait for nearly an hour for Nicole's friend (Nicole was away on vacation) to get her keys to the apartment. We also had some trouble later with getting a key to the apartment building (was not given with the apartment keys initially), BUT it was smooth sailing after all of that was sorted out.

Like others already mentioned, the wifi was pretty terrible. We couldn't use it at all during our stay.

Communication was easy, even with Nicole being away on vacation- her responses were still fairly quick."
719233,33482852,2015-05-28,33941089,Brenna,"I had a lovely experience at this place! The neighborhood was great, the apartment was clean and very pleasant. I would recommend it to anyone!"
719233,33790563,2015-06-01,26969392,Zac,"This spot served my needs perfectly. Situated among some of Capitol Hill's hippest joints, adjacent to the Downtown scene, I would happily book this apartment again. No red flags."
719233,34228459,2015-06-06,3389011,Aaron,The apartment was just as described and the price was great. We only needed to stay a night and this place was in an excellent location. Would definitely stay again! 
719233,34699745,2015-06-11,30152509,Barry,My two adult sons and I stayed here for 4 nights. It is a great location (close to downtown and two blocks from grocery store) and the apartment met our needs very well. The hosts were very responsive to our questions. 
719233,35077636,2015-06-15,30320468,David,"This is a great spot for a couple or a single person. The location is great as it's right in the middle of a lot of spots locals like to hang out at and only about $5-$10 cab ride to downtown. If you're going to Pike Place I would just take a ride to downtown and walk the remaining 5-6 blocks as traffic gets bad the closer you get to it. The apartment is clean which is about all I ask for as I tend to spend as little time as possible in my living space while traveling. If all you need is a clean bed, bathroom, and decent kitchen then this is the place for you. "
719233,35356073,2015-06-17,35041341,Michelle,The room is quiet and comfortable. And the best thing I love is the location. We can walk to the Pike Market.
719233,36005754,2015-06-24,4782153,Kristel,"Listing was accurate, place was good. Great location, we walked to almost everything and lots of bus routes crossed the area."
719233,36263374,2015-06-27,28722657,Huanjing,"It was good stay overall, however both of the internets did not work. Check in and out process was easy. "
719233,36845159,2015-07-01,37006040,Cheyanne,Cute place.
719233,36947558,2015-07-03,5668273,Raveena,Excellent location. It was walking distance to the to Pike place and the Starbucks roastery. The apartment was a little hard to find at first but it was big enough and very clean for the two of us. 
719233,37461886,2015-07-07,31254903,Eric,"Had a good time at Seattle, Washington for 4th of July weekend, and being at a central location contributed to that experience.  The pictures are completely accurate except for the couch.  There's now a collapsible Sofa Bed instead of a fold open sofa bed.  It's semi comfortable, but acceptable comfort level.  The bed in the bedroom was comfortable, and I slept like a baby.  Though, a lighter sleeper might hear the neighborhood if it's rowdy, as it was for me since it was the fourth of July weekend.  It was hot, so we had to keep the windows open, equaling high accessibly to the street noise.  

If I had to be nitpicky, the wifi was spotty and slow.  outside of that, Nick's place delivered as advertised, and in a big way on it's location.  20 min walk to everything, and lots of food and bar choices close by.  Grabbing a morning Coffee was just up the street and convenient.  

If I roll into town again, this place is a nice place if location is a priority, which it is for me. "
719233,38259208,2015-07-14,1030409,Cindy,Pros: Amazing location. Affordable. Easy access. Includes Netflix and other free movie subscriptions. Cons: Wifi internet pretty much non-existent. Shower drainage was slow. A little dingy in some corners. Overall: Good for travelers on a budget looking for a centrally-located spot. 
719233,38499171,2015-07-16,11254972,Ben,"Great location, especially if you're visiting the convention center, and everything was very clean. All communication was clear and responsive. Thanks!"
719233,38625318,2015-07-17,36157479,JoAnna,"Great location in Capitol Hill! Walking distance to restaurants, bars, and downtown. This apartment has a really nice wall of windows, and gets a great breeze when you open them all. Plenty of room for a solo traveler or couple. Nick worked with me to let me drop off my luggage  at the complex early before check-in, so I wouldn't have to lug it around at my convention all day. Would definitely stay again!"
719233,39001164,2015-07-20,3131636,Hannah,The house was small but clean. It's in a great location. We walked or took an uber everywhere. Only downside was there was no air conditioning and we were there in July so it was hot.
719233,39209675,2015-07-21,7803308,Miriam,"Unfortunately I only have bad things to say about this place. 
The bedding was stained, the wifi didn't work, and the bath & the basin were both blocked. I had a lot of trouble sleeping because I could feel the springs coming through the mattress & the freeway was extremely loud.

I was very disappointed with what I got for the high price I paid. 
I wouldn't recommend this place. 

The host did make the check in process easy & left some brochures for things to do in Seattle, which was nice. "
719233,39392602,2015-07-23,34694616,Jessica,"Pictures can be deceiving..
We recently stayed here for what was supposed to be a romantic vacation for my boyfriend and I, until we found out what we picked to stay in. If you have luggage or lots of stuff to take with you on the trip don't book here. We had to walk ten blocks with all of our luggage the haul it up 3 flights of stairs. Parking was horrible. We had to wake up at 7 am to move my car and be back at 6pm to move it again, it really put a damper on the things we could do. But there was no other parking around

The apartment was close to downtown which is the only good thing I can say. There was mold on the roof in the bedroom.. Mold growing in the drains of the bathtub. The vanity where you're supposed to put your toiletries was all rusted. And we were only left a roll and a half of toilet paper.. 

This is definitely not a 3 person apartment. The pull out couch is half of a love seat that looks pretty worn in. And the only bathroom is through the main bedroom. So if your third guest has to use the washroom in the middle of the night, everyone is being woken it.

We rented thos place for the kitchen and never used it once. We needed to clean out a cooler and so we used a little soap, which wasn't soap it was pure bleach.. 

The walls looked like they had snot smeared across them.. It was aweful I dreaded every night we had to go back to this place.."
719233,39643438,2015-07-25,35439705,Cindy,Nick notified us a couple of days before our arrival and gave us detailed instructions on how to check in.  We had a smooth arrival and was able to get into the apartment.  The description of the listing was accurate and was suitable for 2-3 people.  There were even some leftover food (unopened box of crackers) in the kitchen.  The neighborhood was safe and only about a 10-15 minute walk to Pike Place and downtown.
719233,39912781,2015-07-27,26524083,Matt,"Generally the property was as described. There's no AC and the surrounding area is a bit noisy (it's located close to a major highway), which makes keeping the windows open at night difficult (we visited in July). The apartment was clean but in an older building. Generally, when compared to hotels in the area this unit is a great value. "
719233,40342425,2015-07-30,36305871,Sandip,Very accommodating host (coordinated with cleaner to let us check in early) and fantastic location!
719233,40728040,2015-08-02,3699619,Amitava,"This a great location for anyone who is looking to explore Seattle by foot. The apartment is older so expect it to show some age. So, if that is all okay then this is the place for you! Area is surprisingly quiet. All in all it was good stay. If you have a car you can park at the Washington Convention Centre which allows secured overnight parking (locks up midnight-5:30am)."
719233,41924369,2015-08-10,30025417,Alex,"The listing description was spot on. It whole place was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The little kitchenette was just enough to cook some basic meals, which was just what we needed(mainly breakfast). 

It is maybe a mile walk down the hill to Westlake Station to catch the monorail and just a few blocks down is Pikes Public Market. 

However, you can catch some great coffee, beer, and food all around the apartment. Nightlight is very vibrant on Friday and Saturday with lots of energy and young people walking around having a good time."
719233,42386992,2015-08-13,1893082,Jared,"Basically as described. The location is convenient to the conference center.  The WiFi is sketchy and bordered on useless, as others have noted. The shower would have been a great height for someone a head shorter (I'm 5'9""). Communication was OK, not great. I mostly chalk that up to Pillow, with whom I was not impressed. I asked about stashing my bag someplace when I got in at noon and before my departing flight, and Pillow referred me to a hotel a half mile away. But when I got there, there was a note in the room that there is actually storage on site. No one ever told me that. Then the cleaning person was late and had to clean around my bag anyway. The person from Pillow who called to tell me they were running late spoke barely passable English and told me the cleaning person was having car trouble, but when I talked to the cleaning guy after he got there he clearly had no idea when he was supposed to arrive (I told Pillow I wanted to check in at 3, and he showed up after 3:30 cracking jokes about how early I was). "
719233,43363616,2015-08-19,16539984,Rebecca,"A disappointment. The initial information did not disclose a mold and mildew problem. That can be deadly for someone who is allergic. The initial information said to contact the Pillow Team for any problems. We did. They responded but did nothing to correct the problems - no hair catcher in the tub, internet would not work, no washcloths or lack of full set of bedding for the couch. We were offended by the response from Pillow Team, and we would not stay there again."
719233,43618611,2015-08-21,25954118,Jina,"This is a great place and a great location! Nick made everything very easy for us to put our bags away before check-in, and the place is exactly as described. It was clean and incredibly spacious. As far as the noise concerns go, please be aware that you will be staying in the city-center of Seattle so expect big city noise. I would stay here again because it is within walking distance of everything that you could possibly want, and I enjoyed staying in the apartment! "
719233,43924904,2015-08-23,34757776,Larry,The neighborhood was in walking distance to everywhere that we wanted to visit. The building was older but description was accurate. 
719233,44134731,2015-08-24,7165995,Alan,There was some confusion regarding the key and storage room. There were no sheets for the sofa bed. everything was solved and I was issued a $45 refund for the inconvenience. I was told there was a new management company handling the property and the issues will be corrected in the future  
719233,45233403,2015-09-01,17427580,Betsy,"GOOD STUFF: Excellent location just a few blocks away from the Convention Center. Our room was off the road and quiet so that was an unexpected plus. Communication was rapid especially when we had car problems and had to check out a few minutes late, they were very accommodating. Queen size bed quite comfortable.

BAD STUFF: The only reasons I am not giving a full five star is that the futon pictured was actually a pullout armchair and the sheets were not labeled but just in a trash bag in the closet. Also we were only given a 1/3rd of a roll of toilet paper with no back up so we had to go out a buy more our second day there. Also limited outlets. Recommend bringing a power strip if you have many electronics. INTERNET: The internet they provided in the information page from Pillow was a terrible connection and came from a mysterious unknown source. However there is a modem/router inside the room with the information on the bottom of the router- much better connection. 

Would stay again."
719233,45947555,2015-09-07,1360206,Brian,"Nick's place was exactly what I was looking for in Seattle. It was conveniently located, easy to find, in a safe neighborhood, and clean. Instructions and communication were clear and easy throughout the process. 

The neighborhood was great, too! The oyster bar just up the street was a fun late evening stop. 

If you're looking for a simple, clean place while in Seattle, I'd recommend Nick's! "
719233,46715879,2015-09-13,37891381,Tina,"The flat is administered by a company and is rented professional. The house is dirty, the flat was quite clean but everything inside is really old. A couch where you don`t really want to sit on. (not the one from the picture) When I came there the drains where blocked, but they fixed it the next day. The area is quite nice, a lot of bars around. Next time I would pay a bit more to get into a hotel, the flat wasn`t worth the price. "
719233,47157023,2015-09-16,25639123,Kelly,"Overall good experience and would definitely recommend this place. The place was very clean when we arrived. A little putzy dealing with the ""Pillow"" management site for check-in info, etc. but not bad. Great neighborhood to stay in with the best restaurants/bars/culture of the city. My only complaint was the bedding, there was no fitted sheet on the mattress, only a top sheet that did not stay tucked in making sleeping somewhat uncomfortable along with a cheap bedspread. Parking was also somewhat difficult but the host makes that clear in the description. You can pretty much walk to everything if you can make it without a car."
719233,47671696,2015-09-21,5050144,Amy,Great location! Nice clean apartment w/ in walking distance of everything I wanted to do in Seattle. Pine box is a great spot & is right next door. Would definitely stay here again! 
719233,47959955,2015-09-22,34666982,Tom,"We did not meet Nick, and after our reservation request was accepted, the rest of the process was carried out through Pillow. This Airbnb experience felt a bit more impersonal than others, but worked out just fine. Killer location. Very simple accommodations. Recommended if you're just looking for a bed to crash in a centralized part of the city. Not recommended if you require fanciness. "
719233,49094010,2015-10-01,24151097,Gaston,"I am very sorry but I have to give a bad review. The most important issue had to do with the keylock code. They gave me a wrong one. We had to call the administration while waiting in the street with all our luggage until they sent the cleaners. They also tried the given code and nothing. It was wrong. The cleaners used a different code and we could finally get the key and open the building front door. Once we could open the door we realized that there were no elevator. Not such a big problem, but they should have advised because it's a third floor. The apartment had one wardrobe with no place in it for even 1 bag. Wifi didn't work at all. None of the three different networks given in the welcome book. The apartment had 1 (one) glass and we had to share it for the four days of our stay. On the good side, the location was excellent and the apartment is big enough for a couple."
719233,49766970,2015-10-06,7642027,Michael,I did not get to meet Nick but there was enough instructions and guides etc. to feel very comfortable in his apartment and the city. The place is the perfect base to explore Seattle from. The Location is awesome! It is incredibly quiet at night which is amazing for how close you are to everything. The apartment has everything you need and also appears much bigger in person. Would happily stay again!
719233,50747837,2015-10-14,36828056,Jemma,"Overall a rather subpar experience. We had to call the pillow company upon arrival because, like a previous guest stated, the code we got was incorrect. Fortunately, they had the correct code and we didn't have to wait until a cleaner arrived. Once we got in and set everything down we had to immediately open all the windows and empty the woefully inadequate dehumidifier in order to help assuage the musty smell permeating the place. If you're over the height of 5'5, be prepared for an awkward showering experience due to the height of the shower head.  The information book seems to have been put together circa 2011, which made for a few errors in places that are still in business. The internet code we got was also incorrect, but thankfully the one on the book was able to get us access to the laughable internet connection. It took us far too long to find a place to eat as well as directions there using the provided internet connection. If you're planning on an extended stay, we wouldn't recommend using the freezer. We bought ice cream and it was melted the next day.

On a better note, the location couldn't have been better, right in the middle of everything we wanted. We were also able to store out luggage after checkout in the supply closet for several hours which was incredibly helpful as we had an 11pm flight."
719233,51428258,2015-10-20,30511651,Lucia,"Nick's apartment overall is very nice and cozy. The group who take care of the apartment gives good advises and help when I couldn't get the keys from the master lock. A great thing I would like to mention is they provided a lot of trash bags for you to use, which helps when travel with dirty clothes. The apartment is locate in the quiet zone but a little bit scary at the hallway because it was dark outside. Suggest someone who can install a bright light at outdoor. No parking provided to us but street parking was available and kind of easy to find parking in the neighborhood. "
719233,55320582,2015-11-29,46345543,Jason,The place was nice and cozy. Lighting was not as bright as the picture showed. 
3979496,18700689,2014-08-30,9994183,Alix,"Relaxing stay! I was in a tough transitory state, and Jayne put me up last minute, gave me space to sleep, made me tea, and was kind enough to inquire after me well-being. She's a solid lady! The room is well-kept with a big tv and all kinds of entertainment. Futon was actually comfortable. Would stay here again. "
3979496,18928407,2014-09-02,7361427,Fabian,Stayed for three nights at Jayne's place. Jayne is a great host and knows all the good places in the city. Ballard is a lovely neighborhood with great restaurants in walking distance. I definitively recommend to stay here. By bus you easily get to downtown in less than 30min. Make sure to ask Jayne about her personal favourite sights and restaurants!
3979496,19970524,2014-09-21,10353115,Mary,"This awesome spot in Ballard was our first stop for a week in Seattle. The location and host can't be beat!
Jayne was so accommodating and friendly, she provided incredible directions to her home from the airport (we didn't have a car), as well as tips for getting around the neighborhood. She gave us some of the best tips for places to eat--we love food and thanks to Jayne we ate some of our favorite meals in Seattle in her neighborhood.
We got around just fine without a car! It's about a 10-15 minute walk to downtown Ballard, unending bars and cafés and restaurants. It's the place to be in Seattle! Quick 10 minute bus ride to Fremont, etc... Perfect location on a gorgeous neighborhood street!
The room was comfortable and secluded with a view of the garden. All things considered, this room is a bargain for the experience. A great place to come back to and unwind after a day of exploring. 
Jayne was our first host of the trip and she set a great tone! Can't wait to see her and her adorable doggy when we visit Seattle again! Thanks for the great times!"
3979496,20402601,2014-09-28,21784689,Mary,"Jayne is a wonderful, warm and courteous host. She has a bevy of knowledge about good bars and restaurants in the area and accommodated all of our needs. She's very friendly and my boyfriend and i had fun chatting with her, but she knew to respect our space and privacy when we were tired and ready to relax. The room was very clean and private with a comfortable bed, and came equipped with an enormous apple TV. Also she has an adorable dog! We were only there for one night but i wish we could have stayed longer. Would definitely recommend a stay at Jayne's!"
3979496,20456277,2014-09-29,18337426,Michelle,"Jayne was a lovely and accommodating host for my quick overnight visit in Seattle. I was able to leave my bags with her before check-in and after check-out while I explored the city. The D-Line to downtown is just around the corner and I was able to spend the weekend in town without needing a car, walking to breakfast and dinner spots and catching the bus into town. Spent some time in the evening chatting with Jayne and her neighbor - really comfortable and easy conversation.

The room was as listed and provided all the amenities I needed. I'd definitely stay with Jayne again and highly recommend her home for a visit when you're in town."
3979496,21571608,2014-10-19,13008308,Travis,"Holy moly! This place was great! Sort of a man cave with a bed. Jayne and Tyke were great hosts. They allowed me space and privacy, but also were happy to let me join in for some Downtown Abbey. The location is great as it is only a 10 minute walk to Market st with all the great restaurants and shopping Ballard has to offer. "
3979496,21932547,2014-10-26,22886999,Christopher,"Great accommodations. Very cool mancave basement room especially with the huge TV. Lots of privacy if you need it, but Jayne was more than friendly and willing open to hanging out if that's what you're in to. "
3979496,22639138,2014-11-10,7434377,Stephan,Jayne and Tyke were awesome people! Extremely considerate and accommodating. The room was perfectly comfy for a weekend getaway and a great location for roaming Ballard. Buddy their dog was a great added bonus. Our favorite part of our stay was sharing some wine and chatting with the two of them. Very highly recommended!!
3979496,23588976,2014-12-05,24348310,James,"The location was great; the house was on a quiet street, and within walking distance of the places I was visiting in Ballard.

Jayne, Tyke, and Buddy were extremely welcoming hosts.  I'm very thankful to have met them and wish them well."
3979496,23619496,2014-12-06,13700552,Jessica,"Jayne was a great host, and the room was exactly as described. I was only in town for a brief while and didn't spend much time there (at all really!) but the little touches like the complimentary toiletries, fresh towels,  huge TV in bedroom and AppleTV make this Airbnb option worthwhile for a single or couple. The room is really massive.  Her and her partner were really warm and friendly and gave great recommendations for many bars and restaurants around Ballard - of which there are many options, so it's helpful to have a local guide you through. They even knew where the really, really late night options for food were. 
Also, Buddy the dog is adorable.   "
3979496,27634866,2015-03-08,26252555,David,"Perfect - minutes walk to central Ballard, clean and comfortable.  Jayne ensured solid communication and the place was open and exactly what I needed for a visit!!!"
3979496,27912263,2015-03-14,29285341,Will,"Awesome place, awesome hosts. I was there for just a night, but Jayne and her husband helped us find our way around Seattle and made us feel very welcome in their home. The room is really nice, huge TV with all the fixins. Thanks guys!"
3979496,28757255,2015-03-29,29738928,Carmen,"What a wonderful mini vacation!  We had such a nice stay at Jayne's place.  It was easy to communicate with her leading up to check in, and they made us feel very welcome and comfortable.  The room was quiet and clean-just what we needed after a day on the town!  They gave us great recommendations of places to eat and were great hosts.  Plus, their house is in a quiet spot but an easy walk to downtown Ballard."
3979496,30654949,2015-04-25,9731245,Yoongi,"Jayne and her husband were very friendly and welcoming. They gave us helpful directions and suggestions for local eats and attractions. The room they have on the lower floor was nice, comfortable and warm with a giant TV! Thanks, Jayne!"
3979496,31852989,2015-05-10,17635007,Francesca,Jayne and her husband are great hosts and I really enjoyed staying at  their place! We even had some time to chat and they're friendly and welcoming people. Recommended.
3979496,35428000,2015-06-18,35595339,Cathy,I felt welcomed right away. The room was very comfortable and I had a  very nice night's sleep. Had all the amenities I was looking for. I will definitely be checking back on future trips. Thank you 
3979496,36106692,2015-06-25,1200767,Stanley,"The hosts were very generous with their time.  They enjoyed talking with us as we did with them.  

The basement room was comfortable. Because the bathroom was  upstairs it is inconvenient for  older people or those of any age who need to use the bathroom at night.

The neighborhood was very nice."
3979496,36558047,2015-06-29,34306397,Jo,"We had a great time as Jayne's guests!  Our room was not only large, clean and bright, but also remained cool during a surprisingly warm summer weekend.  The futon was comfortable and the room nicely appointed.  The neighborhood is wonderful, full of shops and restaurants and terrific coffee shops, and only a short walk away you can hop a bus into downtown Seattle.  We had no transportation trouble even though we did not rent a car during our stay.  We were made to feel entirely welcome, both in our private space and in sharing their kitchen and bathroom.  We greatly appreciated our visit with Jayne, her husband Tadgh, and their friendly dog Buddy."
3979496,37085384,2015-07-04,35544324,Abby,"We had a great time in Seattle with Jayne and Tidgh. They were lovely, laid back, and welcoming hosts, and we really enjoyed chatting with them in the garden. The basement room was just fine for us. It looks as described in the photos, spacious with a futon. The location is a two block walk from the bus and walkable to the shops and bars in Ballard."
3979496,37774141,2015-07-10,15874627,Bhupesh,I had rented the basement room in Jayne's house for 1 night. My experience was short but great. Jayne and her husband are warm and friendly. The futon mattress in the room is great (especially if you prefer a hard mattress) and comes with clean sheets. the shared bathroom shower is great. 
3979496,38645711,2015-07-17,37418501,Carlos,"I had a wonderful time staying with Jayne.  Her and Tadgh were warm and inviting, as was Buddy.  She even laid out a small toiletry spread for me, in case, I had forgotten anything from home.  She was available to answer any questions and gave recommendations for places to visit, even informing me about places to visit in Vancouver, the next stop on my trip.  The room was clean and well appointed, and the bed was comfortable.  You really could not ask for anything more during a stay.  I would recommend this room to a friend without question."
3979496,39450729,2015-07-23,28353565,Susan,"Jayne and her husband were delightful. The room and accommodations were what we expected. I felt safe and comfortable in the room, house and neighborhood. I would stay here again."
3979496,39651127,2015-07-25,12435639,Cecee,"These two were really great! They made sure we were comfortable, offered oodles of suggestions, engaged us in good chats, and always had coffee available in the morning. Definitely a super host!"
3979496,39820480,2015-07-26,20015963,Natalia,"Jayne's home was everything the listing made me hope it would be. She is an extremely welcoming, courteous and helpful host that I'd recommend to anyone passing through the area. Very close to Woodland Park Zoo, which is where we went, as well as a very short drive to downtown. 
Can't thank you enough, Jayne!"
3979496,40834833,2015-08-02,3710658,Jayashree,Jayne is extremely flexible and it helped a lot as our schedule was little  tricky. Her house is in a really nice neighbourhood so getting in and around is very easy. I would highly recommend Jayne's house. 
3979496,42630782,2015-08-14,41066154,Carol,"
We had a very restful night.  The room was clean and neat and the bed was very comfortable.  Jayne and her husband were gone and we were almost ready to retire so we did not visit much but Jayne was gracious in our desire for a fan.  Coffee was really nice the next morning.  "
3979496,42738240,2015-08-15,6155882,Tina,Jayne's a very accommodating host. She left clear instructions on how to access the house if she was out (or asleep). Our estimated arrival time changed several times (delayed flight) and Jayne was very flexible. The room/house/bathroom were all very cozy and clean. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
3979496,43762538,2015-08-22,34009207,Keith,"We had a wonderful time staying with Jayne. Her and Tadgh were warm and inviting, as was Buddy.  They were available to answer any questions and gave good recommendations for places to visit."
3979496,45990932,2015-09-07,26032935,Mitchel,"Jayne was indeed a superhost. She made me and my boyfriend feel more than welcome to enjoy our stay in her splendidly kept Seattle basement room. I rarely feel that I have the comforts of home truley on vacation, but Jayne and her friendly husband made sure we felt both accomdated and comfortable. Would rate (phone number hidden) stars if possible!"
3979496,49712444,2015-10-05,2609672,Redmund,"Our room is large and comfortable, set in a well-lighted basement, with a window and door to the back garden.  The house Is appointed with tasteful English/Irish artifacts.  Jayne is very friendly and made us feel at home.   The bathroom is shared, but it is convenient, and has everything we possibly need.  The nice, thick and soft towels are much appreciated.   We highly recommend it."
3979496,53300403,2015-11-07,10147122,Laurent,The one-night stay at Jayne's place was great. She is super friendly and the place is exactly as described.
6884820,39896911,2015-07-26,35730768,Jiyoon,"Even I didn't have chance to meet Daminda, he answered my question very quickly. His house is just like as described. Located in one of my favorite neighborhood in Seattle.  "
6884820,40068918,2015-07-27,31822684,Clayton,"Good neighbourhood. Would recommend a car to get there. Friendly Host. Private bedroom adjacent to shared bathroom. The air mattress, though unexpected from the description, was comfortable. We only stayed one night but the kitchen and bedroom were equipped with amenities for a longer stay."
6884820,40503965,2015-07-31,3457750,Walter,"This was a great place for our quick stay in Seattle. Daminda was great at communication prior and during our stay. We didn't see him a lot because we were out in town most of each day. It was really hot while we were there and he even picked up a fan for us! Location is a bit removed, but a great spot if you have a car, parking always easy. The airbed isn't amazing but okay for a few nights stay. Lots of people in the house so sharing one bathroom can get a bit hectic, but overall everything was good. Super clean place."
6884820,40666963,2015-08-01,7229098,Richard,Daminda is gracious and very friendly and the room was generally as advertised. Communications were smooth. Guests booking should be aware that it is an air mattress and the room cannot be locked. Otherwise it provided reasonable value in a city where accomodation is generally expensive.  Thanks Daminda.
6884820,40826516,2015-08-02,7650376,Rose,We did not meet our host and received our key from a key box.  The neighborhood was quiet.  The room was clean and the bed very comfortable.  A basic room just as pictured.
6884820,43273849,2015-08-18,3498494,Lydia,"Daminda's home was so clean, comfortable and conveniently located. He was incredibly sweet throughout our stay there. I was there for work and very busy, so it was really nice to wake up to a note offering us coffee some mornings.  The room was very nice and the brand new mattress was extremely comfortable. He did a fantastic job communicating and everything anyone could need in the kitchen, bathroom, bedroom was all there! Thank you so much Daminda!"
6884820,44947179,2015-08-30,24158674,Edgar,Daminda fue un excelente anfitrión. Nos sentimos cómodos y bienvenidos. El vecindario muy bonito y muy bien comunicado con el centro de la ciudad de Seattle.
6884820,45830475,2015-09-06,19077503,Joyce,I didn't get to meet Daminda but we communicated a lot through text and she gave my boyfriend and I plenty of advice on what to see and do. It was a good area to stay in because there is street parking and restaurants and cafes are just a short drive away. The room is nice and enough space for two. There was also chips and water bottles which we really appreciated! Personally we didn't prefer the bed and the walls are quite thin. 
6884820,47201623,2015-09-16,41103012,Joanne,"The room was as described. The shared bathroom was available at most times and stayed clean. It was great to have a kitchen to use, and a nice little deck to sit out on. The host is committed to upgrading and definitely interested in feedback. The space feels very private. It is a block away from the best bus route in Seattle, so it's easy to get around. Get on the bus and go straight to Pike's Place Market and downtown Seattle."
6884820,50189806,2015-10-10,15514305,Kimberly,"Daminda was very welcoming. He came to the house a number of times during our stay there , and made sure we were feeling comfortable. He is very kind, and disposes of his time to help you get around the area or to make any accommodations that meet your needs.We were free to use other areas of the house, and he made sure to let us know so. The neighborhood is very quite and safe. We were able to sit out on the balcony a few times, and was very peaceful and quite. We found the house to be in a convenient location as well. There's a coffee  shop a couple of blocks away, and a number of good restaurants within a mile range. "
6884820,53515450,2015-11-09,36167329,Connie,"Daminda was a friendly, excellent host! He really made our stay in Seattle a great one. The location of his place in Ballard makes walking to many great coffee shops, bar, and the D line (main line to downtown) very convenient. Also his place is a quick walk to Enterprise if you plan on renting a car!  

I will definitely book with Daminda again if ever in Seattle. "
6884820,54076762,2015-11-15,2366361,Jake,Daminda's place is clean and welcoming. Close to the liveliness of Ballard it is a nice spot to come home to. He made it very easy to access and I'd stay with him again!
6884820,55285512,2015-11-29,49458990,Montserrat,"Very clean, very cozy, awesome neighborhood "
7430926,42907701,2015-08-16,36360507,Catherine,"We had a perfect vacation at Audrey's. She was so helpful when planning our trip and available to answer any questions. Definitely can go without renting a car if you're staying in the city. Uber rides are about $5-$15 depending on where you go and what traffic is like. 

The listing was accurate. The pictures don't do the apartment justice. It was so comfortable and cozy. It felt like going home, not to a rental. Audrey had great instructions for getting in and out of the building. She even had guide books for us. Our favorite activity was the EMP museum. We would absolutely recommend staying at Audrey's to anyone who asks."
7430926,43398770,2015-08-19,37743341,Kelsey,"Our stay at Audrey's exceeded everything we had been hoping for. She was very accommodating and even periodically checked in on us via text to ensure that our stay was going well. She even left a bouquet of flowers for us upon arrival! The apartment itself was beautiful, modern, welcoming, cozy, extremely well-kept (and stocked with the necessary toiletries!), and true to its photos. I must also mention that the queen sized bed was one of the most comfortable that I have ever slept on out of all my times of travel. The location was ideal, as it was only about a 10 minute drive to many sightseeing locations. We are so thankful for her hospitality and hope to be able to stay here again during future visits to the beautiful city of Seattle. "
7430926,44466775,2015-08-26,6413900,Addison,A perfect first Airbnb experience. The listing was accurate and Audrey is incredibly organized. Check in and check out went smoothly and all instructions were very clear.  The place itself was exactly as described. It's small but a perfect home base when visiting the Seattle area. Didn't have any problems and would stay here again. Only thing is that you are required to wash all linens before you leave. Not a huge issue but you need to make sure you make the time to do it before you have to check out. Thanks so much Audrey!
7430926,44729256,2015-08-28,186277,Christian,"Clean, comfortable home. The directions to enter the actual apartment is very detailed as it is part of a larger complex. Audrey was responsive and took feedback about positively about a check out issue. Overall, a good overnight experience."
7430926,44938383,2015-08-30,38192053,Sebastian,"The apartment building was easy to find and street parking was available a short distance away. 
We found the apartment to be very nice, very clean, and everything we could have wished for was available. 
We even found a small Italian restaurant a short walk away. Access to public transportation is excellent and you are at the space needle in minutes."
7430926,45190551,2015-08-31,25612431,Ben,We enjoyed our stay at Audrey's place.  She was helpful and readily available to address any concerns we had.  Great location - would stay again.
7430926,45677062,2015-09-05,5075051,Ryan,"Although we never met Audrey, she was an excellent host! She kept in contact to see if there was anything we needed or that she could help with. The apartment was better than described and the location was very good and within walking distance to some great restaurants/bars, grocery stores, and other attractions in Fremont. The bus stop is right outside and less than a 2 minute walk. The bed was super comfy and so were the pillows. 

We spent two evenings on the rooftop deck at the gas fire pit. One evening enjoying wine, bread, cheese, and fruit by the fire and another making S'mores. It was great! 

** TIP: The knob on the timer for the fireplace is stripped so it does not turn and only spins. Open the access panel, remove the knob, and use something thin to turn the post the gas timing knob sits on. Also the electric ignition didn't seem to work so match or some fire source would be handy**

My fiancé and I enjoyed an amazing week in Seattle together and would recommend staying at Audrey's to anyone we know. "
7430926,46893612,2015-09-14,35868812,Brynn,"Audrey made us feel very welcome, she was responsive and available if anything came up but we didn't even need to contact her because everything went very smoothly during our visit! The place was very clean and well maintained, the bed was comfortable and we were very pleased with our stay."
7430926,47282669,2015-09-17,30053122,Sierra,Audrey was so sweet and easy to connect with! She was always available through text and/or email and answered quickly. The apartment was very clean and we loved the modern rustic look. The apartment made us feel at home during our stay. Audrey was very clear with check in/out instructions along with many resources for around the city. We would love to stay again! 
7430926,47978487,2015-09-22,37059723,Eryn,"Loved the opportunity to stay at this great condo!  The location is perfect for easy access to entertainment and freeway access.  The condo has great decor, nice and clean, and having the full kitchen (which is amply stocked) makes the space more welcoming.  We will definitely consider this space for future Seattle trips and recommend to anyone looking for a wonderful hotel alternative.  Thank you for allowing us to stay, it was spectacular! "
7430926,48883564,2015-09-29,7820626,Cristina,Nicely decorated and comfortable apartment in a great location. Audrey was welcoming and helpful.
7430926,49221114,2015-10-02,26011984,Rashree,"The apartment looked exactly like the pictures beautiful and very stylish. The proximity to the space needle, downtown Seattle, trendy restaurants and shopping was all just a short distance away. I was here for work so it was convenient to the places that I needed to go in Seattle. All the amenities that you need are in the apartment. Just a few things to keep in mind: parking is challenging, you'll hear water from the upstairs apartment (shower, toilet flush, sink) gushing down the pipes in the bedroom wall, and (in my experience) the shower hadn't been cleaned thoroughly in quite some time. If you plan to bring a car parking is most difficult after 4pm. You can find a spot within 20-30 minutes other times. If you park on Dexter like the listing suggests, know that it's very busy street with multiple tow zones. As for the noise from water coming down the pipes, it is disruptive if you are a light sleeper (which I am). "
7430926,49349047,2015-10-03,43131971,Pat,"Audrey thanks for the stay, it was simple and exceptional. I appreciate your flexibility with late check in time and checkout. I hope to come back soon!"
7430926,49642350,2015-10-05,26093045,Robin,"My elderly mother and I stayed here for two nights and found it to be a delightful place. The unit was very clean, which is the most important thing to us. A previous reviewer thought the shower wasn't cleaned, but I think it is just an older shower and is stained, but still clean. We didn't use the kitchen as we ate out for every meal, but it looked extremely well stocked. The location is very central to many attractions in Seattle. The only challenge we had was the parking situation. Audrey did let me know ahead of time that there was no parking available onsite, and that I would need to let my mom out and then go park and walk back. I think if you are used to city living and the idea of hunting for a parking space everyday, or if you don't have a car with you, then this place is perfect! As someone who has an attached garage, and lives in a small town, it was a bit of a pain, especially at night. However, we did manage to find a parking place each time, which was a relief! Audrey was a very attentive host via text, wanting to make sure we were comfortable and if we had any questions, which was really nice."
7430926,49816897,2015-10-06,43001397,Matthew,Audrey's place was great. As advertised her place was in great shape and very convenient. I would definitely stay here again
7430926,50074605,2015-10-09,40585339,Louanne,We enjoyed our 3 day stay in this tastefully decorated apartment. We made all our meals in the well stocked kitchen. We travelled by bicycle and the apartment was well situated with access to all parts of Seattle particularly downtown and the Fremont area. Our host contacted us several times to offer assistance. Much appreciated.
7430926,50197971,2015-10-10,534454,Phil,We didn't meet Audrey but her place was nice. Everything was super clean and well decorated.
7430926,50841715,2015-10-15,20692634,Pamela,"The apartment was comfortable, modern, clean and tasteful.  We appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and the thoughtful touches such as a first aid kit.  It was a great base from which to visit Seattle!"
7430926,51281669,2015-10-19,20417132,Ron,"Great place in a great location!
The condo was clean and nicely set up. The parking situation wasn't great but by no means a hindrance. The location was ideal if you want quick access to Downtown or Fremont(you could easily walk or bike to both) and being that close to the water made for great views in the morning. I have no complaints about our time spent at Audrey's place and I hope this helps others decide to stay there too."
7430926,51470716,2015-10-20,34917101,Andrew,"Audrey was a great host, and her place was perfect for us and exactly as described. Her instructions for checkin and checkout were clear and easy to follow and we really felt welcomed. Much better than a hotel!"
7430926,52702477,2015-11-01,14993348,Matt,The apartment is really nice and in a great location. I spent most of my time in ballard and fremont and those are both very easy to get to from here. The bed was also one of the most comfortable I've stayed in.
7430926,53248331,2015-11-07,43530489,Catherine,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Audrey's home! It is a wonderful little apartment with great amenities! She was very helpful and available to answer any questions that we had or to offer up recommendations! The building had a great gym and rooftop deck, as well as a good central location for exploring Seattle. This was our first Airbnb experience and we will definitely be back!"
7430926,53766640,2015-11-12,32413300,Chelsea,"Audrey's apartment is impeccable! It is like walking into a West Elm catalog. Extremely clean, and in a great location for getting around Seattle!"
7430926,53972362,2015-11-15,44942387,Rebecca,This was our first airbnb experience and Audrey made it amazing! The apartment was pretty close to everything that we wanted to go to which is was very convenient. She had instructions for check in and check out and it was very clear and made things a lot easier for us. She was very accommodating and was there if you had any questions! We really hope to be able to come back to Seattle because this is on our list! 
7430926,54611964,2015-11-22,47212413,Noah,This apartment was in a good location in Seattle. It was a quick ride to any destination in the city.
7430926,56050995,2015-12-08,23750299,Brendan,Great apartment! Nice and quiet. Beautifully decorated and everything we needed! Would definitely recommend. Never had any issues with parking once we got a hang of the neighborhood. Thanks so much! 
7430926,57381436,2015-12-25,7859809,Jon,"Audrey did a great job ensuring our stay was comfortable.  She was very accommodating and easy to communicate with.  Her place is very well kept and located in a great part of the city allowing for quick access to both public and car transport.  I would definitely recommend staying at her place... thanks again, Audrey!"
7430926,57817579,2015-12-29,11523209,Alyssa,The host canceled this reservation 10 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7883181,45432649,2015-09-02,14992078,Regina,"Lacy was away but her friends were helpful, the room is spacious and very comfortable. Had a good stay. "
7883181,47926169,2015-09-21,35099428,Lauren,"Lacy and her roommates were very accommodating and sweet. The room was huge, very comfortable and had a beautiful view. As a gardener myself, I was thoroughly impressed by all the  beautiful catci thoughtfully placed around the house. The only thing I would mention to future guests is the road/train noise.  If you have trouble sleeping with noise at night, this super convinient location is also fairly close to the interstate. But honestly, where in Seattle aren't you going to hear a fog horn? Had a great time and would definitely stay again."
7883181,49262795,2015-10-02,3231147,Ashley,"I really enjoyed my stay here!  Not only was the room and house unique and creative,  the vibe and company was calming and enjoyable.  I highly suggest staying here!  I felt very comfortable!  "
7883181,50962248,2015-10-16,34149476,Jessie,Lacy's place is exactly as described! Comfy bed with lots of warm quilts and a great big window! I really enjoyed staying there with how close it was to the lightrail. Lacy and here roommates were all very sweet and I was bummed I didn't get to spend more time at the actual house 
7529124,48322572,2015-09-25,19716860,Michelle,"The stay was absolutely amazing. The place was clean and the bed comfortable. The loft has everything you need; its location is ideal, neighborhood is quiet, and parking is no issue.  Jenifer and her husband were wonderful hosts, very attentive. Super accommodating by letting me check in early.  Enjoyed my stay a lot. "
7529124,49060804,2015-09-30,44629812,Chelsea,"Jenifer was absolutely fantastic. She responded to me within minutes of reaching out, with thorough clear, concise responses.

I acted as the liaison between my small town Texas parents that were visiting and Jenifer. Her flexibility and super efficient personality made that very easy.

The space had everything they needed, though small, it is a true Seattle studio apartment, and while it is physically attached to the main home, it doesn't feel as so, with the separate entrance, and high lofty, nest feel. She was kind of enough to walk my parents through everything they needed and even put some welcome goodies in their fridge and kitchenette, including delicious coffee, cheese, and yogurt they had for breakfast the next morning. The other thing I will remark about is the ""fold out bed"" it is COMFORTABLE. Seriously, this is not your average hide-a-bed. My parents are both 6 feet tall and they slept soundly and comfortably during their entire stay, and they were skeptical about the whole thing. 

I also reside in the Maple Leaf neighborhood, so I'm a big fan of the location, just far enough out of the city to not be breaking the bank for a trip to Seattle. 

Jenifer, was gracious, helpful and not overbearing or in your face. 5 stars! I highly recommend this joint!"
7529124,49572330,2015-10-04,24626874,Rocio,Jennifer and her husband were super nice and gave us tips on getting around Seattle. Place was great exactly what you see. She had some snacks for us in the fridge. It's not super close to downtown it's about a $17 uber ride which can get pricey I suggest bussing it. Even though the second bed was on the floor it was super comfy I couldn't tell I was sleeping on the floor. Overall a great experience. The only suggestion I have to better the experience is perhaps putting a TV in the room. I would stay again!
7529124,51250489,2015-10-18,10364005,Amie,Perfect spot for my overnight visit to Seattle. Jennifer was super responsive during the booking process - welcoming and helpful during my stay. She even had snacks and tea available in the unit. The unit was clean and comfortable. Close to multiple public transportation options for ease of getting around Seattle.  Clean with lots of natural light 
7529124,53232717,2015-11-06,48087075,Lisa,"The loft is clean, well-decorated, and made me feel at home. The kitchenette has all the basic kitchenware needed to cook a meal or just simply make some hot tea or coffee. The sofa bed is comfortable and plenty of room for two. I loved that the loft is walking distance from a Metro bus stop that provides direct access to Seattle hot spots such as the U District, Westlake area, and International District. I booked this place the evening before our trip. That is how quick and reliable Jenifer is to answer any questions that you may have. Jenifer and her husband are very friendly and approachable. 
The loft is a private room above Jenifer's house (accessible from outside) but just know that the walls are very thin so you will hear background noise easily, such as cars starting, doors closing, conversations, etc. The wifi signal was weak at times. Parking is tight in this residential neighborhood, as the road is not very wide. We ended up parking on the gravel in front of the house fence. Try and come with only one car. It was an overall great experience.

7529124,53293287,2015-11-07,20242776,Steph,"What a fun place to stay and a welcoming host. Jenifer was an amazing communicator when I needed anything. The space was perfect. Jenifer had a snack waiting too which was perfect timing right after I visited the gym right next to the Airbnb. The bed was super comfy with quiet house attached. If I come back up there and we need a place to stay in Seattle area I will book with Jenifer again!

7529124,53431016,2015-11-08,25111920,Shannon,"The loft was clean, comfortable and exactly what we needed. Booking the loft was no problem at all. We booked the loft for nonconsecutive days and Jenifer was very accommodating with this and let us keep our stuff in the loft for the night we were not there. Checking in and out were easy. We only briefly met Jenifer because of our busy schedule but she did give us a few good recommendations. The neighbourhood was safe and we would definitely stay here again if we return to the area in the future."
7529124,53722227,2015-11-11,25111920,Shannon,"See previous review :). In short, the loft was great and exactly what we needed. Communication with Jenifer was easy even though we only briefly met in person because of our busy schedule. We would definitely stay here again if we return to the area in the future."
7529124,54077556,2015-11-15,896915,Aaron,"Jenifer's place was perfect for my weekend stay in Seattle. She provided ample information about the space, which was cozy and outfitted with all the necessaries. It's also a great location, and peacefully quiet at night."
7529124,54227120,2015-11-16,48442813,Sarah,"The Bamboo Loft was exactly as expected with a welcomed surprise of snacks in the refrigerator. The bed was easy to make and the kitchen was cute and functional for all my needs. The shower was hot and the water pressure was strong- enough to rinse my long hair no problem. They provided shampoo, conditioner, and a fantastic Trader Joe's body wash. The only issue I had was with the wifi due to an error on my computer (not their fault). Without hesitation they logged me into their personal wifi so that I could complete my homework. Additionally, the bedding was very warm and cozy. They were polite and genuinely cared about my experience. I felt safe and enjoyed my stay."
7529124,54807280,2015-11-23,27672907,Sarah,"I had a great stay at Jenifer and Alfredo's studio.  They were so warm and welcoming from start to finish. The studio was cozy and very tidy, and it came fully equipped with everything you might need - plenty of towels, bedding, and kitchen supplies. The bed included a memory foam mattress top that was super comfortable.  There's also plenty of privacy as the studio has a separate entrance and key code. Maple Leaf is a nice, quiet neighborhood, and their house is just blocks from a bunch of cute cafes and shops.  I would definitely stay here again."
7529124,55049745,2015-11-27,7219471,Tara,"This studio was perfect for my short stay in Seattle. It is absolutely sparkling clean and very cute. It was just me, but there would have been plenty of room for two adults. The bed was comfy and the shower water pressure was great. :) Jenifer was an attentive host. There are cool coffee shops and bars within walking distance, if you want. Maple Leaf is a quiet, pretty, safe neighborhood. 

As the description says, the walls are shared with the host house, and the walls aren't super thick - they'll hear you and you'll hear them. But we all observed the 10 pm quiet hours and it was no biggie - just good to know.

Overall, I would highly recommend this place if you need a place to stay in Seattle - I only stayed two nights but it would have been very comfortable for a longer stay, too."

7529124,56464463,2015-12-13,108689,Anne,"Jenifer is a great host, I felt welcome, and communication was easy and complete. The space was clean, organized, as shown in the photo, and exactly what I needed. A lot of thought and care has gone into creating this space.  Although I didn't use the kitchenette on this visit, it is something I will keep in mind, if I have the opportunity to stay here again. It was a relatively last minute reservation, and I was super grateful that it came together. The location was perfect (short drive to East West Bookstore) where I was taking a workshop. "
7529124,56742217,2015-12-17,26692196,Melissa,"Jenifer was very easy to communicate with -- she was kind enough to set up the bed for me because I was coming in late.  The room was nice and toasty, well appointed, quiet and clean!    I was Seattle on business for just one short day/night -- this was so close to the local office, I would definitely recommend to my co-workers who travel as a great alternative to a hotel.   Wish I'd had more time to explore the recommended eateries, the neighborhood looked very charming!"
7529124,56981516,2015-12-20,48636964,Sean,Room looks exactly like the photos nice area clean space worth the stay if your going to Seattle 
7529124,57061140,2015-12-21,1000727,Kate,"Jenifer's place is lovely, spotless and quiet, with lots of nice extras. She allowed us to show up a bit early--very helpful. She made the bed for us while we were out (best linens!), which was a nice touch. We enjoyed our stay in Seattle and would stay with Jenifer again but for our old backs, which require a real bed, we learned to our chagrin. Jenifer's bed is better than a futon but not quite enough support for us. I would recommend this apartment to more youthful bodies. She was prompt to respond and she was able to answer all our questions. We had hoped to be able to meet, but our scheduled didn't allow it."
7529124,57452142,2015-12-26,1871594,Donald,"We spent two nights at Jenifer's cute studio, and were very comfortable. The space is very well designed and modern, with all the amenities we could have needed. Location is perfect for our needs and Maple Leaf cafes and restaurants are within walking distance.
We'd stay again!"
1545801,7082795,2013-09-05,2034502,Monica,"I had a wonderful stay in Andrew's apartment. The location was amazing and the apartment builing was great. It has a wonderful view that lets you see the entire Seattle skyline. Andrew was such a great host! the entire time he was very communicative, and ifwe had any questions he always helped us out. We had a very pleasent stay, and would definitely stay with him again. "
1545801,11230741,2014-03-25,3562197,Nirav,"Andrew was a solid and responsive host. He allowed me to change my reservation last minute (adding a person) and was very flexible about our checkin time (we ended up getting there about five hours before we thought we would, and he let us drop our bags off and get the key right then). I'd stay there again."
1545801,14611690,2014-06-23,3600442,Michelle,Great location with a beautiful rooftop view!  Andrew was very nice and helpful and we had no issues.  Would recommend!

1545801,16999794,2014-08-05,17310966,Karen,The apartment would have been fine except that it was warm in Seattle the days we stayed and there is no air conditioning. It was uncomfortably warm even at night and fans/ windows did not provide adequate comfort for sleeping in august. Temps were in the 80s inside and out
1545801,17372223,2014-08-11,17430091,Mami,立地が良い所で、シアトルを十分に楽しめました。
1545801,17606989,2014-08-14,19414935,Neil,"We stayed in Andrew's place while visiting Seattle for a baseball game and concert. His clean, two bedroom apartment was in a great location in Capitol Hill. We had access to the rooftop patio, which was convenient and had a beautiful view of Seattle! Despite the fact that Andrew was out of town while we used his apartment, he responded quickly to inquiries/questions and was a pleasure to communicate with. The place was clean and stocked with everything we needed. I would definitely stay again."
1545801,18875661,2014-09-02,15310994,Ryan,"The listing was exactly as advertised and worked perfectly for our group.  The neighborhood is fantastic with lots of great coffee shops, food, and bars.  Room got a little hot (a couple fans would've helped) but that's probably our only complaint.  From the location to the complex to the room everything was great."
1545801,19440552,2014-09-12,20778465,Gioel,"Excellent location, spacious, good AV setup. Was a great spot as homebase for Seattle visit. "

The location was very convenient for us with public transit, grocery store, restaurants, coffee- everything you need nearby. His place was stocked with everything we could need and more, plus extra blankets, etc. Andrew needed to stop by during our stay and politely coordinated with us to grab what he needed. Definitely recommended!"
1545801,35015772,2015-06-14,5125704,Hannah,"Nice building and clean spacious apartment. We were a group of 6 girls and there was plenty of room for all of us. Andrew was friendly and very accommodating. When I got to the apartment, he already had an air mattress and all the sheets & blankets set up for us. He was also flexible with checkin and checkout processes, making the whole process smooth and easy. 

The place has a great location. Many of the best bars in Seattle are within 15min walking distance. I'd totally recommend Andrew's place to anyone visiting Seattle. "
1545801,35516045,2015-06-19,35529723,Karl,"Andrew was very welcoming and responsive in organizing my stay at his Capitol Hill location. He has a great place at a a great location with many places to eat.  Any time I had a question he was always quick to get to back to me as soon as he was available, which didn't take long. He also asked how the place was and made sure my stay was going well. Overall he was a great host and I would definitely recommend any of my friends and colleagues going forward."
1545801,35735876,2015-06-21,19410603,Mauricio,"From the beginning of the reservation I had a good communication with the host, the place and the neighborhood were awesome. The place is perfect for 3 days weekend."
1545801,36443210,2015-06-28,4481190,Nikhil,The place was as described and pictured. Andrew was very prompt in responding to my several question. 
1545801,38559107,2015-07-16,6075714,Hahn,"Andrew was super accommodating and really friendly. Stayed up late to get me a key to the apartment as my flight was late on a Monday. Apartment was big, clean, and comfortable! Would definitely stay here again."
1545801,39469112,2015-07-23,28013945,Sarah,"Great location! Walking distance to great restaurants and bars on Capitol Hill, and other fun things! Andrew was flexible, and fit us into his schedule late notice! "
1545801,39790930,2015-07-26,16838597,Patrick,"Andrew was professional in hosting us at the huge 2 bedroom apartment in Capital hill. The apartment was clean upon arrival and there were no issues getting the keys. Parking was available in the garage below, and although there was no outdoor space in the condo itself, the rooftop patio had a bbq and amazing views of downtown. 
The neighbourhood has grocery stores, pubs and restaurants and transportation to downtown was quite easy and accessible. 
We would recommend staying here for large groups, as there was plenty of room for the 6 of us. 
Thanks Andrew!"
1545801,41012278,2015-08-03,39539739,Henry,"The apartment was very comfortable. The area was surrounded by an excellent choice of restaurants. The grocery store was within 100 yards and was convenient and well stocked. The roof top was great and provided a spectacular view of the Blue Angels.  Also, only a $10 cab ride to Pikes Market."
1545801,42287719,2015-08-12,28702826,David,"The place easily fit 3 of us, and was in a great location, just as advertised.  The beds were comfy, even the infatable mattress was pretty good. Andrew made sure we had everything we needed, and was in touch via text or phone as needed.  The bikeshare system - Pronto - close and easy to use.  Easy walking distance to restaurants in Capital Hill, a bit longer walk to downtown and pike place, but walkable.  "
1545801,42984587,2015-08-16,28352657,Brooke,"Andrew communicated clearly and getting in the apartment was easy. The space was clean and exactly as pictured, location was perfect. The only thing we had trouble with was rooftop- the door was locked and we couldn't open it with the keys provided! We didn't have time to ask Andrew about it, but I'm sure he would have sorted it out for us! It was a great stay."

We couldn't have had a better experience staying in Jordanna's home or working with Jordanna herself, and we'd recommend it to anyone!"
6926511,37230011,2015-07-05,20729687,Liz,"Kate and Andrew were such great hosts. The house was exactly as pictured and they even left us a snack and two Orca cards for public transit in Seattle!

The house is beautiful. So modern and comfortable. One of the beds is softer than the other so there is something for everyone. Even in 90+ degree weather, the home stayed relatively cool and there were plenty of electric fans to go around in addition to the ceiling fan in the master bedroom.

Bathrooms are so cute and modern. Really excellent. This is a house I would want to buy in Seattle if I was in the market. 

I would stay with Andrew and Kate again in a heartbeat. I really enjoyed my time in their home. "
6926511,39965495,2015-07-27,36541219,Barbara,"Kates home was so beautiful we felt like we were staying in a four star hotel. She went above and beyond to make our stay comfortable and enjoyable. The location, just blocks from Greenlake, was great and loved walking around the neighborhood. We would certainly book this location again the next time we visit Seattle. "
6926511,41780070,2015-08-09,34455728,Hillary,"Kate provided a beautiful home in a beautiful area for our girls weekend! With easy access into her home, it was an effortless check-in and check-out. I know if we needed anything, she was just a quick message away! Thanks Kate!"

"
6926511,57625313,2015-12-28,27287044,Garry,Very nice modern home with open floor plan and Very comfortable accommodations. Equipped with two full bathrooms. We definitely would stay here again on our next trip to Seattle. Awesome place! Kate is a great host.
6926511,58132831,2016-01-01,46151068,Robin,What a great first experience with airbnb!  I think I'm probably spoiled now!  The home was absolutely lovely. Everything was so clean and beautiful. 
3291777,14255940,2014-06-15,16647743,Dale,"I was in a pinch looking for a last minute place to stay while in town for a work trip during the time of UW and the other Universities graduations in the area. It was great to find a place to stay that was not ""marked up"" during a time of high demand. My 3 night stay was less than what the hotels were asking for a one night stay. The unit is a close walk to restaurants and the UW. The unit was clean and worked well for my needs, at a great price. I did not have any issues finding parking in the immediate area or the street in front of the building. My initial inquiry to Melissa was very late in the evening (actually early am) on the needed day of arrival. Melissa was extremely quick in her response at such a late hour, as well as the couple inquiries I had during my stay. I really appreciated that she arranged for my late evening arrival after a night hosting some clients at a Mariners game. I would definitely stay at this unit if I have the need to be in the area again.  "
3291777,14760768,2014-06-25,16881604,Annar,"Melissa replied to our request and approved but by the time we booked it she gave away the apartment to someone else. We had no choice but to book another apartment in the same building. The price we paid was way too high for the room ($129 @ day) because there were a lot of issues which we experienced during our stay. The coffee pot was left dirty with garbage still in the bins from the previous guests. The kitchen faucet was broken and after several emails and 2 days later Melissa did come by and get it fixed. There were used soap bars and shampoo left in the bathroom which raises hygiene risks. My question is why did I pay for cleaning fees if the apartment was dirty.

The apartment building was in very poor condition and the apartment had a disgusting smell with no ventilation. The apartment decor was poor and furniture was old and uncoordinated. Although the carpet was vacuumed that's what Melissa told us but it was very old and stained. The mattress of sofa bed was disgustingly dirty - we only came across because the sofa was so uncomfortable and we checked underneath. The kitchen had left over food items such as coffee, tea bags, raisins etc and utensils were old. There was only 1 small tea cup for an apartment which is suppose to host up to 4 people. Since my partner and I had no choice, but to go out and buy our own disposable utensils. The bathroom has one rusted mirror with stains and the bottom of bath tub has been painted over which became very slippery after one day use. We had to clean the bath tub to ensure we didn't have any accidents. The toilet tank would also drain water constantly because of loose valve. We had to fix it constantly after every use.

The only thing that worked well was the (website hidden) had limited channels and many channels were in Spanish including the sports channel which had the World Cup running. Quite a disappointment for my partner.

The location was the reason we booked the apartment. While the location was great, close to UW and shops etc, the building and apartment needs lots of work to bring it to habitable condition. Unfortunately, it wasn't like we could check out since we had booked for 4 nights and had no choice but to stay. Overall, we were disappointed with the place and since this was our first ever airbnb, we will be very cautious on what we book in the future."
3291777,15278962,2014-07-06,1268102,Daniela,"I cancelled the reservation first when I got to see the apt. It was not what i was expecting, because the place is more like a hotel. No one actually lives there but, more like a hotel, people come and go for short stays. 
After saying that, the place is not taken care off like if an actual person live there. So most of he furniture is cheap. The bedroom does not have a window(although there is no pic of the bedroom). The smell is of cheap cleaning liquid, combined with the several people that stay there per month. 
In conclusion, overall the place looks cheap, but it can be habitated if one is looking for a cheap short stay.
BTW, the host showed us another place in the same bldg that was 10 dollars more expensive per night but looked like new. So just be careful which apt you choose because some are better than others."
3291777,15590881,2014-07-12,16974704,Christine,"Though this place isn't super fancy, it's certainly comfortable for crashing in while exploring Seattle, and the location in the U-district is convenient both in terms of immediate access to restaurants in the neighborhood as well as multiple bus lines running downtown.

The host Melissa was very quick to respond to booking requests and upon check-in made sure we had what we needed ... we didn't make a lot of contact beyond that, but she seemed very kind and willing to be accommodating if we had needed something.

The one thing I feel people should realize about this apartment is that its only window (the one in the living room) is directly adjacent to an alleyway that cars cut across quite frequently. There are steel plates on the pavement there, so they clatter loudly every time someone drives by, which starts pretty early in the morning. Also on two mornings there was non-stop and very loud construction noise, preventing any opportunity to sleep late. On top of that, the upstairs neighbor has a habit of loudly pacing (stomping?) back and forth for hours on end, late at night ... this happened without fail 6 nights in a row. I've lived in various apartments for over a decade (including NYC) and understand they all come with noise, but I'd have to say that for a vacation spot, all this combined was a bit annoying.

Noise aside, which arguably Melissa can't do anything about, the place was fine. The building is on the older side, but the apartment interior is clean if not full of frills. The bed mattress is brand new and very comfortable; the sofa less so. I'd maybe compare it to a college student's first apartment in terms of quality.

Again, if you're using this as a ""home base"" to basically shower and sleep while during the day you're out exploring Seattle, I think it's suitable, and the location in the U-district and quick bus access to downtown are its main positive features."
3291777,15920870,2014-07-18,1481833,Leena And Praveen,"The apartment worked out well for me; I was attending a conference for the majority of my time in Seattle but needed a home base to wind down and sleep in the evenings, and get ready in the mornings.  This is not a fancy or modern apartment, but it was quiet,  affordable, a great location, and very convenient.  UW is within walking distance including University Ave with tons of restaurants.   Melissa was a great host.  It was unusually hot in Seattle that week (~90) and she was able to find me a fan to use which I def needed.  She is a very responsive and friendly host.  I would stay again if I came for another conference.  "

She provided some freezer foods, snacks, laundry detergent, toiletry items and books as well as a card detailing the neighborhood. You can see the lake when outside and there is a great cafe and pizza place right across the street. A great place to stay and a terrific host!"
3904056,34721013,2015-06-11,21434366,Ed,"Nice place, close to the lake and 20 minutes from downtown, cozy and quiet."
3904056,40091978,2015-07-28,11020912,Nancy,We had a lovely time in Seattle at Shontina's apartment.  Shontina made sure everything was in place.  It is just a short walk to Lake Washington.  There are so many beautiful places to walk. 
3904056,43783513,2015-08-22,37169797,Neipori,"Although we did not get to meet Shontina, she was always available through email and replied to any of our questions promptly. We felt comfortable knowing she was in touch, and comfortable in her neighborhood. It was very near a good pizza place, and next to a Kung Fu studio which was really fun to watch in the evenings. The apartment was clean and it was a short walk to Lake Washington. We had a wonderful time, and I would highly recommend Shontina for her hospitality and for the ease of our stay. Thanks Shontina!"
3904056,46001801,2015-09-07,23920318,Steven,"Shontina is a wonderful hostess. Her cozy apartment was perfect for my girlfriend and I. It is merely a 15 minute drive into downtown. Her place is next to (2) great restaurants, literally a block away! When I come back to Seattle, I am definitely going to request Shontina's place again!"
3904056,53588817,2015-11-09,42878153,Haley,The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

From the sleep-inducing designer bed to the perfect mystical backyard and rustic outdoor shower, I am thrilled to have found my Seattle home away from home. Thank you Ed and Gretchen for your warm generosity. Can not wait to return to your magical home!"
4863369,28443478,2015-03-23,29446931,Phoebe,"Fantastic location, in a really sweet neighbourhood that's easy to access by light rail or bus from the city. The room and amenities are really comfortable and homely. We were made to feel so welcome even though we hardly met ed and gretchen they were very supportive and open to questions or help should we have needed it. Incredible garden and outdoor shower. One of the best air bnbs we've stayed in. "
4863369,28551091,2015-03-25,29791487,Dionne,"Awesome place and even better hosts. This was our first AirBNB stay and it exceeded our expectations. The room is beautiful and the bed is amazing. Lots of detail went into this space, from the teas available, to composting options and handmade trinkets. The gardens are nice and my daughter got to feed the chickens. Best of all, the hosts were very helpful, offering us recommendations for dinner, and bike rides and other activities. Stay here! We definitely will again."
4863369,28736034,2015-03-29,18253487,Ricky,"Ed and Gretchen are great hosts! The room was immaculate, well decorated, and very welcoming. The private bathroom is great, and you can tell a lot of work went into its design! Do yourself a favor and try the outdoor shower! It's private, hot, tranquil, and the perfect start to the day!

We so appreciated them sharing their yard/garden! It's beautiful! There are so many small details that it would take days to notice them all. Gretchen is a talented artist, and her work is scattered around the yard and in the house, as well. It's like something out of a book! I seriously expected to see fairies flying around!

Great neighboorhood. Nover had any issues with parking. It's close to conveniences, close to I-5 and I-90, and close to the Southcenter mall for those who like to shop and/or watch IMAX movies. :)

Our best Airbnb, yet! 

"
4863369,29581720,2015-04-09,30355544,Wendy,"I felt vey welcome here. Very comfortable room and bed. The gardens are beautiful.  I would most certainly stay here again. Thanks Ed!!

Wendy"
4863369,29651239,2015-04-10,1433563,Jamie,"Wow, what a cool place! Staying here in the backyard it's easy to forget you're in Seattle. The grounds transform you to a different place. 

Parking is a breeze on the street. The room is incredibly private. Ed could probably list it as its own apartment. You have your own private entrance, private bath, the backyard almost feels like your own space.

Ed himself was gracious (as is his beautiful dog, Baja.)

The bed is just as comfortable as it sounds, and the river rock shower is really neat. I'm happy I was able to stay here before they raise the prices because they could easily charge more for what they are offering."
4863369,30001823,2015-04-15,8963315,Lauren,We had an absolutely WONDERFUL time at the farm! It was the perfect distance from downtown - quiet but easily accessible. The amenities were just what we needed and the bed was incredibly comfy. Woke up and read on the back patio next to the chicken coup with the lovely smell of flower blooming all around. Looking forward to staying again in the future! 
4863369,30157959,2015-04-18,19484532,Kerry,"This is an awesome place to stay! Ed was very communicative, and helpful. The space has a private entrance, a comfy bed, garden shower, and sculpted art pieces accenting every detail. I would definitely recommend this space to a friend. "
4863369,30424615,2015-04-21,12655045,Michael,"Ed and Gretchen are completely lovely, down to earth people, and they were very welcoming and accommodating.

The space could not have been more perfect for us. Really. Every little detail was perfect. Reclaimed wood, repurposed doors, super comfy and luxurious organic bedding, handmade and unique touches throughout, composting, water efficient toilet, an AMAZING beautiful yard/farm with a totally cool chicken coop. We loved it all. Natural and modern. And it was VERY clean. And I'm pretty particular about cleanliness. 

The neighborhood was cool, and it was easy for us to get everywhere we were going.

I very highly recommend staying with these awesome folks, in their beautiful space!

REWILD!!"
4863369,30539058,2015-04-23,20621327,Kristen,It was fantastic! We thoroughly enjoyed the comfort of the urban farm. It was home away from home!
4863369,30638514,2015-04-25,1755082,Susan,"Ed and Gretchen were wonderful hosts.  Ed made himself available for contact throughout our stay and was courteous and prompt about replying to messages.  The property is a lush garden paradise and reminded me of staying in Hawaii (without the humidity).  Beautiful farm in the backyard, and they live in a quiet residential neighborhood with a lovely park in walking distance.  Wi-Fi and private entrance are always a plus for us. The room and especially the bed was extremely comfortable and we slept well. We were very happy with these accomodations and would love the opportunity to stay here again."
4863369,31063749,2015-05-01,4533501,Shawn,"My husband and I stayed here for one night on the way to northern WA and wished we could have had more time than just 24 hours! This was our first Air bnb experience and we couldn't be happier with how it worked out. It was so easy to get here from the airport as we just hopped on the light rail, the house was a 15-minute walk from the station in Columbia City, and Ed provided us with easy to follow directions that even took us past a lovely park. 

We found the house very easily and found our room to be very clean, private, and tastefully decorated with careful attention to detail. Our hosts had preempted every possible need on behalf of their guests, from a list of things to do in the neighborhood, to an electric kettle with mugs and complimentary teas, and a jug full of purified water in case we got thirsty. The bathroom was small but extremely functional and very clean. We slept incredibly deeply because the mattress and bedding were SO comfortable. 

We spent time with their chickens and wandering around the amazing gardens and wished we had time to use the outdoor shower! The neighborhood was great for exploring - Seattle's best pizzeria is just a couple blocks away along with many other conveniences, eateries and bars. We wished that we had decided to explore this neighborhood's nightlife instead of the downtown Seattle scene, which promptly empties right around 7pm on weeknights (we were there on a Thursday) if there are no sports games going on. 

Ed was very kind and an excellent host! We would absolutely stay here again. "
4863369,31651513,2015-05-08,30421209,Ryan,"Ed and Gretchen made us feel VERY welcomed!  The Down Wing farm is a magical place.  They were very accommodating, and the neighborhood they live in was a perfect place for us to begin exploring Seattle.  Would love to come back!  "
4863369,32179163,2015-05-15,30226172,Natalie,"This stay was our home away from home! This was our first Airbnb experience and we could not have been luckier. Ed and Gretchen were the most gracious of hosts - always making sure we had everything we needed. The room was the perfect size for us, and if not for being in such a great city, we might have slept on the COMFORTABLE bed for our entire 7 day trip. 

The location allowed us easy access to the light rail - and it's nice to experience the city from a neighborhood, not always from a hotel. 

My husband and I could not have been more pleased with Ed and Gretchen's Airbnb. We hope to return to Seattle soon, and we will be staying here when we do - if it's not booked, of course!"
4863369,32997233,2015-05-24,15275563,Dehanza,"This was my first visit to Seattle. I was attending the Seattle Film Festival and wanted to find a nice quiet and comfortable spot.  Days filled with watching films and then partying until the wee hours with filmmakers, can be tiring, let me tell you. 

From the first night, I was comfortable and slept well.  Ed and Gretchen kindly sent text messages to check up on me to make sure I was happy and comfortable and if I needed anything. The room is great. The yard is beautiful. The neighborhood is great. Lots of variety and some great food. There's a park right down the street. Caffe Vita was always my first stop in the mornings, although getting out of bed was a struggle, since it was sooooo comfortable.  Quiet, safe and comfortable, everything I was looking for. 

Parking was easy and getting to downtown Seattle was a quick drive.  I'd definitely stay with Ed and Gretchen again if I were to return to Seattle.  "
4863369,33213375,2015-05-25,21186192,Michael,Unbelievable space! I miss it already. Ed was extremely welcoming and helpful. My go-to the next time I return to Seattle.
4863369,33346805,2015-05-26,2136654,Jonathan,My experience with Ed and Gretchen was amazing. I actually only met Gretchen but she was so very welcoming and told us about the urban farm the space and some of features (like the outdoor shower) ... Everything was beyond awesome and the renovated space was beautiful and comfortable. 
4863369,33805823,2015-06-01,31484116,Nicholas,"Ed and Gretchen made my girlfriend and I feel more than welcomed. The room was perfect for us and came with everything specified from the description. The location is perfect, as it is only a nice walk from the light rail, and close to eateries. The outdoor shower was a nice experience. As I mentioned to them, my girlfriend and I wished we had more time to actually have coffee with Ed and Gretchen. The stay was lovely, and I can't wait to visit again."
4863369,34087402,2015-06-04,32135109,Steven,Ed and Gretchen were warm and friendly hosts. Their place was on a lovely urban farm surrounded by nature and greenery. The outdoor shower was a highlight of the visit. 
4863369,34246421,2015-06-06,29295147,Xenia,"My favorite things about this stay were: The super-comfy bed, going running along the water's edge just a few blocks away, and taking an outdoor shower right afterwards in their backyard. 

I also liked being able to walk to a restaurant a mile away, through a lovely neighborhood. Gretchen and Ed were helpful and friendly. I like the fact that they keep natural products around and limit the trash they produce."
4863369,34452654,2015-06-08,9377579,Phillip,"The Urban Farm was a great experience for us. As you walk in, you're welcomed by an abundance of beautiful green foliage. Both mornings, we woke up to use the outdoor shower and hang with the chickens out back. Ed and Gretchen were very accommodating to whatever we needed. We definitely recommend staying here!"
4863369,35571626,2015-06-20,31299677,Margo,"We LOVED Ed and Gretchen; super nice, very thoughtful, and extremely helpful with Seattle tips.  Columbia City is near the light rail making travel to the airport or downtown really easy.  We loved the room and the beautiful yard.  This rental is a basement unit and you will hear footsteps or doggie paws above you.  This was not a big deal we were gone usually all day.  Will most defiantly stay again in the future.  "
4863369,35659910,2015-06-21,17676683,Stephanie,"Pros: We had a nice stay thanks to our hosts. Ed responded super quickly throughout the booking process and pre trip arrangements. We felt welcome when we arrived and met Ed. The room was very cozy, clean, and beautifully decorated, and the bed was very comfortable. Not to mention the beautiful garden in the back. 

Cons: as written in the listing description, you can hear every footstep upstairs (people and dogs), voices, cupboards, etc. It's quite squeaky and loud. If you are a light sleeper like us and want to sleep in a bit, perhaps bring earplugs. If you're a deep sleeper you should be fine.

Overall, thanks for a nice stay!"
4863369,36232810,2015-06-26,34513428,Sissi,my first Airb&b experience. Ed and Gretchen are very kind. the room is quite clean. love it!! highly recommend.
4863369,36409178,2015-06-28,33138922,Francesco,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was pretty great. Ed and Gretchen are really nice hosts. As we were pretty jetlagged (flew in from Germany) it was very convenient that the bed was a dream to sleep in. Amazingly comfortable. The room and bathroom were clean and we felt instantly at home. The location is also pretty good. It doesn't take you long to go into town by bus. And nearby are great places for having breakfast/lunch/dinner."
4863369,37013737,2015-07-03,24795503,Max,"I had a lovely stay.    The garden is rad, the location perfect, and best of all the hosts are warm as can be.    I highly recommend staying here.   "
4863369,37054635,2015-07-04,33063060,Sarah,Clean simple accommodations. Just perfect. Very considerate and organized hosts. 
4863369,37567033,2015-07-08,33165734,Scott,My girlfriend and I had a great experience staying at Ed and Gretchen's. Their place was very comfortable and they were about as friendly as could be. The area where they live is great and just a quick drive to the city. We enjoyed it so much it inspired us to hopefully move to Seattle here in the near future. We even arrived a day late and Ed and Gretchen were nice enough to refund us for half of the night that we missed. We didn't even ask for this but they insisted on reimbursing us. Overall it was by far the best air bnb experience that we've had.
4863369,37747211,2015-07-10,1925907,JoAnne,"Because we thought we might arrive late, Ed sent detailed instructions to find their home and to access the room (via a private entrance). The entry, bedroom and bathroom were simply but artfully decorated, perfectly clean, serene and quiet. The bed was extremely comfortable as well. Our visit was too short to allow us to tour Ed's remarkable property but we definitely hope return when we are in the area."
4863369,37911714,2015-07-11,37344123,Pouya,"The hosts were extremely welcoming, and the room was fabulous. The room has its own private entrance and felt like a really nice getaway retreat. I didn't stay here for long, but if I'm back in the area, I'll definitely try and book a longer stay here. "
4863369,37959780,2015-07-12,10408222,Margy,"Lovely stay at Ed and Gretchen's. Very interesting, artistic re-use of materials, especially using beautiful wood instead of dry wall. Very comfortable.  One of the dogs does not like strangers very well."
4863369,38201108,2015-07-13,24860413,Hanna,"Ed and Gretchen made us feel very welcomed. They had good communication beforehand, letting us know the address and how to get in. They welcomed us and were very kind and personable. The room was very clean and beautiful. They also had tea and snacks for us which was very kind. "
4863369,38400438,2015-07-15,34472728,Stephannie,"The down wing farm is really cute, and the room was really comfortable."
4863369,39008506,2015-07-20,25610195,Azmina,"Staying at the down wing farm was a great experience. The place was absolutely gorgeous and the room was nice and cozy. The bed was extremely comfortable and because the room was down it stayed nice and cool. We had everything we needed and were a short walk from restaurants/ coffee shops. Didn't get a chance to meet Ed, but Gretchen you were amazing. Thank you for always having fresh filtered water available to us and for giving us directions when needed and being so sweet. Would definitely stay there again the next time we come up to Seattle. :) "
4863369,41245327,2015-08-05,16907453,Alex,"Ed was a very gracious host. He provided my girlfriend and I with dried fruits and homemade honey. We really felt at home. The Down Wing Farm is a fantastic stay just a little ways from downtown Seattle -- close enough to be perfectly accessible, and far enough to give you a sense of real place. I would definitely stay again. While I never met Ed face-to-face he checked in on our stay on the Airbnb app and made sure everything was easy and accounted for. Thanks Ed!"
4863369,41617033,2015-08-08,15746107,Cortney,"My husband and I had a wonderful time at Ed and Gretchen's Down Wing Farm. It's close to downtown Seattle and fun neighborhoods like Fremont and Green Lake. For coffee drinkers, I recommend Empire Espresso which is less than a mile away. There's plenty of street parking, and the space is clean and cozy. The listing indicates that the ceiling is relatively low, but my husband who's six-feet tall had no trouble in the space. Ed and Gretchen made sure we had plenty of filtered water and offered us honey and dried fruit from their beautiful garden. As someone with sensitive skin, I appreciate that they keep the space completely free of household chemicals and fragrances, and the shower products they provide are very nice. They also checked in with us via airbnb a couple times during our stay to make sure everything was going well. I hope to visit again some day. "
4863369,42420036,2015-08-13,4725918,Kelly,"Beautiful space, comfy bed, communicative hosts, sweet farm treats, and great location. I wish we could have stayed longer to enjoy the outdoor shower! Yes, we could hear footsteps above us, but that didn't bother us at all.
Thank you for a great stay.
"
4863369,42584234,2015-08-14,24090616,Tiantian,"We love all the things in the house! awesome^^ The whole area is pretty and lovely. We ate the fresh tomatoes and plums which are planted in there backyard. That are so yummy! The hosts are so nice. We got home a little late. However, Ed waited us and showed us around. Thank you for everything."
4863369,43078294,2015-08-17,37811781,Jessica,"Ed kept in contact with me throughout the entire process, and even before arriving, I felt welcome. He and Gretchen were amazing hosts and prepared the room perfectly. There was water, tea, some fresh produce from their garden and snacks right at the entrance. They were so welcoming and were willing to give us great tips on getting around the city. I also LOVED the guitar in the room. :) "
4863369,43333543,2015-08-18,40731353,Mickie,"Gretchen greeted us immediately upon arrival and made us feel very welcome. The space is inviting, including the awesome bed and linens, the indoor and outdoor stone showers, and the pears, plums and tomatoes they picked for us fresh from the garden.  We had a nice conversation with Ed and Gretchen on the patio and their little dogs were very friendly.  It's about 3 blocks to an awesome path around Lake Washington.  They also provided a great listing of nearby restaurants and food recommendations.  We thought the price was a great value.  We loved the experience and will surely stay again."
4863369,43553953,2015-08-20,40407988,Drishty,"This was awesome! If you're looking for an off-beat, cool stay- this is the place for you! It was a great location to downtown Seattle and you can even take the Columbia city line into the city. This was a gorgeous room and we loved the urban but Eco-friendly environment. It made us feel like we were doing our part too! I definitely recommend this room for anyone wanting to have an amazing and comfortable stay while visiting Seattle "
4863369,44951286,2015-08-30,39818853,David,This was my first stay with an Airbnb host and it exceeded all my expectations. This private room had all the amenities of a hotel but with a lot more warmth and care put into it. Hosts Ed and Gretchen are not intrusive but are there for you if you need them. The urban farm environment is truly unique and will make your stay in Seattle area a memorable experience.
4863369,45414088,2015-09-02,6906727,Danielle,My husband & I loved this place! I am an early riser so the backyard was so lovely to relax in the morning with a cup of tea! I also tried out the outdoor shower which was super warm & relaxing! Everything was so clean & it was nice having a private entrance! Ed & Gretchen were very helpful as well! We would definitely stay here again!
4863369,46407890,2015-09-10,41588391,Chris,Great neighborhood and wonderful hosts. The place was cozy and the outdoor shower was great. Highly recommend the room to anyone. You can hear the dogs trotting around upstairs sometimes but that didn't bother me at all
4863369,46654951,2015-09-12,36091122,Diane,"We really enjoyed our stay at the farm. We came here to celebrate our anniversary and it was a magical setting. The room was beautifully decorated, we loved all the little pottery displays, and the bed was very comfortable.
We enjoyed the proximity to Lake Washington as we were able to walk around it in the mornings and in the afternoons. The farm has so many wonderful birds and we enjoyed watching them in the morning. We would definitely stay again. Ed and Gretchen were very responsive and helpful."
4863369,47796762,2015-09-21,5555181,Steve,"We really enjoyed staying at Ed and Gretchen's place. The space was really comfortable and thoughtfully designed. Sometimes we used the bus and other times the light rail, either way we were downtown in about 30 minutes. The neighborhood was a great place to stay and really peaceful, but close enough to bars and restaurants on Rainier Ave. Ed and Gretchen were totally accommodating and even helped us out by meeting us at the light rail station with our bag we had left at their place during our last day in Seattle. Thanks so much Ed and Gretchen. "
4863369,48150764,2015-09-23,4181439,Emily,"My partner and I stayed in Seattle for two nights at Gretchen and Ed's beautiful home. We were fortunate that they agreed to host us so last minute, and we absolutely loved our stay. Gretchen showed us around the farm and left us delicious dried fruit and cherry tomatoes from their garden. The details and aesthetic in the apartment were so beautiful. The apartment was super clean, the bed extremely comfy, and we loved the entire earthy vibe. The neighborhood is very cool and a close walk to some awesome restaurants and Seward Park. Overall, this was a perfect stay, and we hope to stay here again and again. "
4863369,50387480,2015-10-11,33165606,Sabina,"My husband and I stayed at the Columbia City Urban Farm, Ed and Gretchen's 'Down Wing Farm' the weekend of October 9th & 10th, check in Friday check out Sunday. The room and amenities were exactly as advertised. We had a lovely time and enjoyed our stay.

With regard to ceiling height: This is a basement unit and as Ed mentions in the posting the ceiling is lower than normal. The place might not be fit for a basketball player but my husband is kinda tall, at 6'-1"", and did not have any problems. He never hit his head, the lowest point in the space is the ductwork (which is shown in the photos). So it really wasn't/shouldn't be a concern for most people.

With regard to noise: As advertised, you can hear footsteps and dog paws tapping on the wood floor above. Since it is advertised, we expected this and as such it was not a problem for us. We were gone for most of Saturday (spent our time in Seattle + went to dinner + theater) and when we returned to sleep the house was quiet. Both Saturday morning and Sunday morning we awoke (8am-ish) before we heard people & dogs stirring upstairs - so again, the noise was not a concern for us. With that said, if you plan on sleeping late or going to bed early, this might not be the place for you. However, Ed and Gretchen were both very friendly and accommodating so if you have concerns, or an early plane to catch, they probably could help you out.

Privacy: We typically stay in hotels, where we don't have to worry about other occupants. We chose this place because it advertised a private entrance. True to the advertising, the room has a private entrance and a private bath. You enter the room by first going through a 'foyer' area with a washer & dryer and a table where they keep water & tea etc for you/guests. I don't imagine that they use the W/D when the room is occupied, so it is my guess that guests have complete privacy during their stay.

Amenities: We used the outdoor shower twice during our stay. I absolutely loved it and now would like one of my own! Their gardens are luscious, even in October (I would love to see what the place is like during summer)..... I would have enjoyed 'petting' the chickens if we had time to spare.

Location: We had thought that we could walk to Columbia City & the light rail. However, with the rain, the distance was a little farther than we wanted. We gave it an attempt, but even with an umbrella we were soaked after only a block and ended up driving. On a dry day the walk would have been lovely.

The bed was amazing.... We wish we could have stayed longer and would recommend Down Wing Farm.

"
4863369,51099993,2015-10-17,19458981,Cynthia Wally,"We found the listing to be even better than described.  They were such wonderful hosts!!!  We felt completely at home and the whole space is decorated with lovely artistic touches.  We felt comfortable to use the backyard space to sip on tea and watch the chickens.  We really wanted to use the outdoor shower but didn't have time.  They supplied us with yummy dried fruit from their trees, tea, and honey.  And an extra bonus: the pebbled floor in the shower felt so good on our tired feet.

Gretchen and Ed even helped us plan an impromptu trip to Vashon Island and connected us with locals to learn more about urban farming and sustainable living.  We knew what we were getting into because the listing includes a notice about being mindful of trash and perfume.  This was a perfect match for us and we can't wait to come back again next time we're in Seattle."
4863369,51721663,2015-10-24,42953779,Morgan,This was a great place to stay. It was very comfy and clean and had lots of charm. We would definitely go back.
4863369,53734036,2015-11-11,3817400,Minniie,"Good place, overall! There was a slight communication gap. I arrived very late due to flight delays. It got very hot down in the basement and there was no way for me to control the temperature. I had to open the windows. I couldn't sleep very well. However, the next day Ed was very responsive and fixed the heating issue. I also experienced internet/wireless slowness. I had to jump into the car in the middle of the call and drive over to a neighborhood coffee shop to complete my call, given phone connection was dodgy. The dogs upstairs were a bit loud at times. "
4863369,54685048,2015-11-22,8002331,Martin,"We had a really nice stay at Ed place. It is a really nice apartment, clean, and really comfortable. The outdoor shower is nice! The neighbourhoods is also nice with some nice restaurant not too far. Our hosts were really friendly and give us some good tip about the city. We wish we could go back."
4863369,54870454,2015-11-25,7690746,Jane,Ed has a wonderful home and such a beautiful garden. I really enjoyed my time here and appreciate all of the little touches like the handmade pottery and chalkboard with local events and things to do. Ed was very  kind and made sure I was as comfortable as possible for my stay. 
4863369,55171344,2015-11-28,35386305,Joe,"Beautiful room in a nice quiet location near Lake Washington.  Comfortable bed with some nice books, wi-fi, a guitar and a neat bathroom.  Ed and Gretchen were super-friendly, and though one dog barked a little whenever we came or went, we otherwise forgot they were there.  Would definitely stay there again."
4863369,55749480,2015-12-05,13877321,Jiyoung Jenny,Everything was comfortable and homey yet elegant (loved the woodwork and the pottery). We had a very good rest and would recommend this place to anyone who is visiting Seattle! Ed and Gretchen were really friendly and nice as well.  Thank you!

We had plenty of room, bedrooms below, living area & kitchen above, bathroom on each floor.  Liked the deck too; trees in front very lovely.  Also loved neighborhood, with fabulous restaurants and shops within easy walking distance.  Good walking neighborhood as well.  Ana met us and was responsive to our needs, made pack n play available for baby."
7071222,42564630,2015-08-14,38571269,Walter,"We arrive late at night, Ana was kind enough to wait up for us and gave us the tour of our stay. Everything was what we envisioned: 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms, nice open spaces, and very clean. We enjoyed our stay and would recommend Ana to anyone visiting the beautiful city of Seattle."
7071222,43792592,2015-08-22,7251391,Michael,The house was in a good and quiet neighborhood. It was clean and comfortable. Close to bus stops and some restaurants. Ana was super accommodating and nice.
2693137,14376387,2014-06-17,6585657,Graham,Mark was a very nice host. He gave great recommendations about places to eat and was very accommodating!
2693137,14587602,2014-06-22,16913981,Kyle,Mark was incredibly hospititable. He made us very comfortable in our space and gave us great advise about the city. We experienced a some great moments based off his advise. 
2693137,14894744,2014-06-28,17215760,Guillaume,"Unfortunately Mark wasn't there. But his friend Mario welcomed us and was awesome, the place is really great, close to the center, comfortable. A very good spot in Seattle."
2693137,15071035,2014-07-01,5189368,Cody,"The apartment was exactly as advertised, great location, clean, and awesome hosts! Mark was very quick responding to our initial emails and the check in/out was very easy. We will for sure stay at the Eastlake apartment next time we are in the Seattle area! 

Ps. The cat Queen Elizabeth is such a ""cool cat"" and a well behaved cuddle monster, almost wanted to steal her and bring her home with us!  "
2693137,15354452,2014-07-07,13220392,César,"We stayed at Mark's place for three nights. My previous Airbnb experiences were all superb. Unfortunately, this time it was a less than nice experience. I will start with the positive. 
Despite the host not being there, an acting host named Mario welcomed us. He was very nice and helpful. Although not very familiar with the city he tried to provide with useful tips. The apartment has a nice view and is in a good location if you want to be near downtown, not so much if you want to take a walk or grab a bite in the surroundings though, because it is right across the street to a major highway. Parking was a bit of an issue because other people took the spot that was assigned to us. Mario told us that should've not happened because that was the host's spot as well. He suggested us to park around the corner in the back parking lot of the apartment complex, and it worked. However, we noticed we took someone else's spot so Mario suggested to put a piece of paper to let them know, and I had to leave my name and phone number in a visible place inside the car so they could call me in case they wanted to park their car. Fortunately, no one called. The bed was comfortable and two clean towels were provided.
There were two main issues we had. Number one was cleanliness, or the lack of thereof. The entire apartment needs a cleaning,  especially the carpet floor. Even more so the bedroom. Moreover, the bedside tables in the bedroom were covered in dust and there were backpacks and shopping bags all over the carpet floor.
The second issue was the pets, and let me explain why. When we saw the listing we knew there were a cat named Elizabeth in the place, which sounded great to us because we're huge animal loving people. The problem is that she and her recently born kittens, they all live under the bed. So all three nights we had to deal with the miaows from under the bed, which can be a real inconvenience for someone trying to sleep. Moreover, Elizabeth is used to come in and out of the bedroom at her will, so we had two choices: sleeping with the bedroom door open or having her, in the middle of the night, sitting in the bed, or on our chests, moving and making sounds for us to open the door. It may sounds fun, but it wasn't, specially when one is looking to sleep and relax. 
All in all the place has potential, but it needs serious cleaning. I'm not sure what to suggest about the cat. As it is right now, I could not, in a good heart, recommend this place for someone to stay at. "
2693137,16312441,2014-07-25,12791463,Emily,"My boyfriend and I stayed with Mark while we were in Seattle and had a lovely time! Mark was very nice, made us feel at home in the apartment and shared lots of great information about the city. We loved our stay and I would recommend it to anyone :) "
2693137,18221853,2014-08-23,19822713,Michael,"Mark was a fine host.  My plans changed somewhat and I ended up showing up later than anticipated; and Mark waited until I arrived so I could find the place and he could show me amenities.  He provided some simple stuff for breakfast, which was nice.  His place is clean and in a good, safe location; close the interstate so it has good access to other parts of the city.  Only stayed 1 night, but I would have no problem staying there again if in Seattle.  "
2693137,18360322,2014-08-25,13820433,Yvan,Mark was friendly and the place was nice. He gave me some space but was available if I needed anything. The neighbourhood is great and really easy to get downtown from. 
2693137,18446691,2014-08-26,6157407,Benjamin,"At Mark's place you will get clean sheets, towel, comfy place to crash, good conversations, in addition to great view. Further two kittens kept me company. "
2693137,18667721,2014-08-30,11540425,Chris,"Really cool guy. Actually picked me up from the airport the first day! Gives you space but is also very hospitable and welcoming. As nerdy as it sounds, I feel like I actually got a friend out of it lol. If I can I'll definitely stay with him again next time I'm in Seattle."
2693137,18878979,2014-09-02,14052905,Rob,"Mark was the best hosts one could ask for.  Polite, courteous, fun and giving.  Had supplied me with keys, a place to park and a bagel, all before I met him.  Even though I was barely there for 3 days, we had some great conversations and Mark made me feel like a friend staying with him rather than a airbnb guest.  

The place was tidy and very clean.  Great view of Seattle, Lake Union and the Space Needle.  The couch was comfortable.  He provided sheets, pillows, blankets and a towel.

The cat, Queen Elizabeth, was cute and soft, very well mannered.  She even slept next to me the first night.

Do not hesitate to contact Mark about your next Seattle stay as I will not.

But I am not good at using English. I wanted to talk with him. If I can speak English, I want to visit again !"

2693137,19901032,2014-09-20,20867049,Sien Han,Mark hosted me and my friend for 3 nights. The house was nice and the bed was very comfortable too. He picked us up from the bus station in downtown and gave us a rough guidance on the places we could visit. Very good host with a comfortable house.
2693137,19990707,2014-09-21,6840008,Jubeo,We had a great stay at Great View Eastlake. Mark was extremely helpful and very communicative. The apartment was very clean and welcoming. Queen Elizabeth is so cute and funny. Thank you very much Mark !!

2693137,20983073,2014-10-08,6031189,Uday,"Home is a place where you can come back in the evening and relax. 
With the home theatre, the comfy sofa, the great view out the window and the pets, home is exactly what the place feels like.
Mark is a friendly guy and I enjoyed chatting with him.

Elizabeth needs a separate mention. 
If you like cat's, you will LOVE elizabeth ! She is one playful cat who will come running to you the instant you sit down on the sofa !

P.S, Seattle isn't on a plain and there are many slopes around the city. Mark's beautiful  place is on the top of a slope (hence the views). So if you have heavy baggage with you and are taking the bus, avoid taking any of the (phone number hidden) irrespective of what the maps suggest.
The #25 is your best bet and stops very near the house."

I enjoyed a neighborhood run and a cute, cozy coffee shop nearby. There are also buses conveniently located near his spot!"

2693137,22991355,2014-11-19,23342924,Quoc,"This is my first time booking through airbnb and was a little hesitant just because I like my own privacy. For a cheap rate, I couldn't pass this opportunity up. I am glad I booked the Bnb with mark. Mark and River were the most friendly person I've ever met. I was new to Seattle, but mark provided many great suggestions for places to eat and things to do. Will definitely recommend staying with mark if you are looking for a place to crash in Seattle. "
2693137,23141693,2014-11-23,23176162,Franz,Mark is an awesome host! We got great tips from him and if you are looking for a cheap shared space then it's definitely the place for you!

2693137,28889099,2015-03-31,27367780,Emily,"I can't say enough good things about my experience with Mark and River. They both made me feel very welcomed and helped me quickly adjust to a new city (teaching me about the different areas, bus routes, music festivals etc etc). Their home is in a great area with a fantastic view and some very sweet animals. I truly only have positive things to say about these two and my time staying with them - Thanks, guys!"
2693137,29078995,2015-04-03,8215821,Andrew,"My girlfriend and I had a lovely time at Mark and River's home.  The pets (kittens and a dog) were adorable.  Mark and River were quiet and sociable.  We had a great trip!  
"
2693137,30108106,2015-04-17,22172481,Laura,"Mark was extremely accommodating, especially considering I had initially booked the room for the wrong date.  He was flexible and thank goodness the place was free for the date I actually needed.  The room was clean and offered everything I needed and the view of Lake Union is amazing.  "

2693137,30645606,2015-04-25,2294171,Ro,Mark & River were great hosts - their apartment was exactly as seen in the pictures. Mark and River were also nice to offer a beer and chatted  with me during my stay. They made my first visit to Seattle very pleasant. Hope to be back in Seattle soon! 
2693137,30750904,2015-04-26,30912823,Nichole,"Mark was very friendly and helpful. We had to find a place last minute and he quickly responded to our request. When we showed up the place was a bit disheveled, but that could have been due to having unexpected overnight guests. We also ended up having to cancel one night, and he was flexible and understanding. He gave us a lot of recommendations on places to visit in the area, as neither of us had been to Seattle before. Also, the view is pretty amazing!
I would add that we knew beforehand that a cat lived in the apartment but when we showed up there were also three kittens. So if you're not a cat person, this probably isn't the place for you. His dog Luke was a sweetheart though. "
2693137,31156013,2015-05-02,32077365,Jono,"Mark was very accommodating and friendly. Great view, nice vibe. "

2693137,32831720,2015-05-22,31552597,보미,"이 곳은 접근성이 좋다. 왠만한 곳은 도보로 가능하기도하고(10분에서 1시간정도) 주요거리들을 지나다니는 왠만한버스들은 다 지나가기때문에 교통편이 편리하다.

처음부터 끝까지 마크와 리버는 우리를 친절하게 대해줬고 전혀 우리생활에 지장을주거나 불편함을 주지않았다. 시차가 거의 반대인 나라라 우리가 새벽에 잠을 못이뤄서 불편하기도했을텐데 그들은 우리에게 전혀 불만도 없었다. 

불편한 사항들을 이야기하면 바로 도움을주었고 이 곳에 있는 듬듬한 강아지 루크와 매력적인 고양이 엘리자베스는 항상 사랑스러웠다. 

비가올때나 날씨가 좋을때나 전망이 좋은것이 가장큰 장점이다. 집주변에 카페나 식당이있고 간단하게는 샌드위치가게도있다. 그리고 집앞에있는 마켓이 한국인이 운영하던 곳이라 더욱 좋았다. 

다음번 시애틀이 갈일이 있다면 다시한번 이 곳에 머물고싶다. "
2693137,32927993,2015-05-23,26870954,Greg,"Mark and River were great hosts!  I will stay again in June and am looking forward to it.  The apartment is modest but clean, very convenient, with a great view, and a great value over a hotel.  Very close to downtown and UW campus, in the very cool East Lake area. My room and bed were comfortable, the shower was hot, and the fruit they shared was delicious.  I got to experience a great new neighborhood and meet some new friends, something that would not have happened in a hotel!"

Communication was easy and fast, and Mark was very easy-going and helpful when needed. River and the pets were nice too. I had a lot of freedom coming and going when I liked. Location was good, and it was easy to get to Capitol Hill / downtown / University district by buses. I can sincerely recommend this place! "
2693137,34875246,2015-06-13,26870954,Greg,"Another great stay with Mark and River.  They are very warm, welcoming, and make you very comfortable.

2693137,35662992,2015-06-21,4220772,Bruno,"Mark and River were very kind and welcoming. The room was clean as well as the bathroom. The apartement is close to public transportation and interstate 5. At night, we would suggest to turn the fan on in order to mask noise coming from I5."

2693137,37570299,2015-07-08,1454561,Darlene,Great location and neighborhood. A bit tricky to find as Google maps seems to not find the address but once we got there it was no problem. Free parking on site was great. Mark and his partner were helpful and checking in was super flexible and easy. He gave me some things to check out in town and great place to go for breakfast. Their kitty Elizabeth is such a cutie pie we fell in love with her. 
2693137,37698780,2015-07-09,26859584,Jennifer,"Mark and his husband River were great hosts. Their apt was very clean, quiet, and we were welcomed home by the cutest little kitten. "

Mark had many good suggestions to give for Seattle, and invited us along for a night out. We really enjoyed our stay at their place: the location is wonderful for everything we wanted to do, and easily accessed without a car. The view is amazing and can't be adequately captured in photos. "
2693137,38651762,2015-07-17,37714366,Ayaka,His hospitality was pretty good :) I had a great night. I would love to come back!
2693137,38733499,2015-07-18,6862643,Chandler,"Mark and River were so welcoming when I stayed with them. Their pets are also equally as welcoming! We didn't stay for very long, but enjoyed it nonetheless. "
2693137,38951795,2015-07-19,38480996,Anne,"Sorry to say, our experience wasn’t good and I wouldn’t recommend this place to friends. I originally asked for my daughter, her husband and their 3 month old baby. The listing said “kid friendly” and Mark was most friendly and encouraging that the baby would be welcome, so we confirmed. Fortunately, because of an afternoon event that conflicted with check-in time, we picked up the key early. Seeing that there was not enough room for a baby, two adults, and their combined luggage, my husband and I switched accommodations with my daughter. 

When we returned in the early evening, no one was home. With a fan on, the power blew in the bedroom when we tried to turn on a light. I called Mark, who said he’d fix it, and we went out. I’m sure Mark and River are very nice and helpful, but we barely saw them. They arrived just after midnight, thinking that they would get there before us to fix the power outage. We were on our way to bed. I’m capable of flipping a circuit breaker, but it’s hard to hunt for a fuse box in the dark. 

It was a very hot weekend, and things happen. But I was disappointed again in the morning when I found the kitchen sink so full of someone else’s dishes, pots, pans, etc. that I couldn’t get my water bottle under the tap to fill it. (Rule #1: clean up after yourself in the kitchen!) We left by about 8:30 with no sign of our hosts.  

The inside of the apartment, sheets and towels were clean, but cluttered, with no place to sit in the small bedroom and only an open futon to sit and enjoy the view, the featured draw of the location. This may be OK if you need a clean bed and don’t mind the freeway noise, but not if you expect a bit more.

Recommendations to Mark:
1)List the correct apartment number and get the locks fixed – took us quite a while to get the doors open. After a while, I saw that the door was a different number than listed w/airbnb, so we tried the other apartment – no luck. We then returned, knowing that the “décor” on the floor outside your apartment was distinctive and had to be correct.
2)Provide guests instructions for “free parking”, that was not obvious, ahead of time. If the “back alley” is best, it would have been good to have directions for how to get there and how to get from the alley into the apartment
3)Would be nice if you could get the carpets cleaned. That was a real turn off.
4)Clear the clutter from the rooms (including picture frames between the bed and the window wall) or be honest that the space can only sleep two with only a small amount of luggage. And warn guests about the power!

Walk to the space needle was not bad at all, very flat and the weather was perfect for it. Their pets couldn't have been any sweeter. Great experience, would absolutely stay with them again!"
2693137,39415981,2015-07-23,33613541,Daniel,"My girlfriend and I spent one night with River and Mark. We actually didn't see Mark as we came home kind of late and left early. The apartment is as nice as shown - everything was great. River was nice, the pets were nice, the space was nice.  A good first airbnb experience.  If we had to pick something we didn't like it would be the proximity of the highway, but that didn't bother us."
2693137,39730253,2015-07-26,18659397,Erina,"Mark was a great host! Whenever there was a concern he was easily reachable, and he warmly welcomed us into his home. The location is quiet and close to bus lines. It is also conveniently located near the entrance to the highway, making for a stress-free drive to the house! Also, his cat is truly the best cat I have ever come into contact with :). "
2693137,40137520,2015-07-28,4870756,Maura,"Mark and River were absolutely accommodating and delightful. We had poor communication in contacting them, yet they still were prepared for us. I appreciate their presence in the house, and they have a gorgeous view!"
2693137,40334409,2015-07-30,2610294,Franziska,"We had a good time at Mark's house. Mark was very friendly, helpful and we had a nice chat with Mark. His cat is very very cute. :)
To downtown it's about 3 miles. You can walk or you can take the bus. The public transport system in Seattle is not much as good as in other city but if you have a bit time than it is ok. In the neighborhood there are a few restaurants."
2693137,40516822,2015-07-31,3286185,Eric,"I enjoyed my brief stay with Mark and River. Their place is comfortable, clean, and quiet; the location is well-served by public transit."
2693137,41206439,2015-08-05,3515152,Daniel,Mark and River have been responsive and helpful in catering to my various requests.
2693137,41733905,2015-08-09,30848928,Man-Ted,Great host and was very accommodating to when my friend had to crash with me for a night and my other friend showing up the next day. Clean place and friendly pets
2693137,42413240,2015-08-13,37277157,Emma,"Mark I use Chinese to write reviews, because the Chinese to express my gratitude to you.Mark和他的丈夫是一个非常好的房东，西雅图是我们这次美国之行最喜欢的城市，没有之一。我们抵达西雅图的时间稍晚，但Mark还是来机场接了我们，并且在我们没抵达西雅图之前，想办法帮我们安排车辆去波音公司，这是非常棒的，特别热情与热心。昆明小哥（可以这样形容吗），我们有看到你的画，是要多么细心的人才能画得那么精致，虽然很想开口让你送我一幅，因为真的太漂亮了。谢谢你们俩对我们的照顾，下次西雅图再见。"
2693137,42669785,2015-08-15,33019540,Joppe,"We stayed for two nights at Mark's place. The house itself is perfect, with a very impressive view over the lake. The room is clean and the bed is nice.  The location is great too, you can easily walk to downtown and capitol hill  (great for food) is even closer.  Mark knows a lot about the direct area as well a the rest of the city. We followed some of his suggestions and all of these were perfect. 

Would recommend a stay here to everybody and wouldn't hesitate to book again."
2693137,42898780,2015-08-16,15150723,Jordan,"Mark and River were amazing and accommodating hosts, the view was even better than advertised and especially beautiful at night. Mark's restaurant recommendations were spot on, and the pets were both adorable temporary companions!"
2693137,43245737,2015-08-18,34231385,India,"Mark and River were the cutest, nicest, and most welcoming hosts! Even tho we were only there to shower and sleep we felt right at home! They have a gorgeous view of Lake Union and the apartment was very cozy. Transportation to and from was very accessible. We would highly recommend people to stay here and will hopefully be returning sometime in the future!"
2693137,43963874,2015-08-23,24877336,Amaury,"Mark was very accommodating for our late arrival. Apart from the rapid chat that we had to welcome us in, because of his timetable and our plans, we actually did not see him at all for the two days that we stayed.

The pictures represent well the place, which is conveniently located. We walked most of the time."
2693137,44908182,2015-08-30,15194978,Heather,"Mark was very welcoming - he was home to greet me and got me settled in my room and answered my questions about all things Seattle  where to go, how to get there, etc.  Eastlake is a great neighborhood, I felt safe walking alone at night as a solo female traveler.  "
2693137,45308184,2015-09-01,28338667,Tara,We had a great stay in Seattle! Mark's home was clean & cozy. He made us feel right at home & offered lots of great suggestions for eating & sight seeing. The view was amazing & the location was an easy bus or Uber ride to everything we wanted to do.
2693137,45498766,2015-09-03,33652093,Martin,"Mark and River are nice guys and gave me a warm and easy going welcome. Parking is no problem at all, the bed is cozy and the room is quiet. Don't worry if you read that interstate is very close by. You will not notice if you close the window.
The view from their apartment is simply breathtaking.
Special thanks to River with whom I spent a couple of hours tasting beer and laughing.
You'll find everything you need within 5 minutes walking: breakfast, diner, beer.
Do not hesitate to get in touch with Mark and River if you want to spend a few days in Seattle."
2693137,45569806,2015-09-04,14521550,Jewel,"Check-in was easy, bed was comfy, and view from the living room was amazing. Close to two bus stops (one is at the top of the hill and one is at the bottom). Has one very cute dog and a tiny kitten. Thanks Mark and River for a great stay!"
2693137,45662301,2015-09-05,35711242,Kirsten,River was there waiting for me when I arrived. He was very nice and welcoming.  It is a good place to use for a quick overnight stay in Seattle. 
2693137,46754029,2015-09-13,41375518,Stacy,The neighborhood was a great location. Super close to main attractions. Mark and River were very friendly and accommodating. They told us about an underground tour that we did that was so fun and we wouldn't have known about it otherwise. The space was clean and quiet. I would stay again. 
2693137,46983963,2015-09-14,43451459,Julian,"Host Mark was welcoming, and the view and the friendliness of the pets were certainly as described.  However the listing could be clearer that what is offered is simply a second bedroom in a small condo, and that the bedroom does not seem to be reserved for visitors nor particularly set up for such use. There were, for example, no side tables or reading lights, and hosts' personal items remained in the room. Visitors share the bathroom with hosts, and in spite of best intentions, it is hard not to feel constrained to avoid the kitchen or living room as long as those are also in use by the hosts.  The bed is a double, but surprisingly noisy, so that every movement by one occupant tended (in our case) to wake the other.  In general this accommodation is best for friends of the hosts, and less ideal for strangers."
2693137,47151145,2015-09-16,10441726,Colin,"Mark was helpful in responding before arrival.
His cat was not willing to give me the room and hid under the bed.  As soon I lay down the cat jumped up on me... Had to keep the door closed. It is by a very busy freeway however the noise is regular. "
2693137,48286496,2015-09-25,38718900,Jinseok,"Mark's feedback of my question is so fast & kind. 
The place is so peaceful & comfortable.
As you see, the window view is so good. (I see the view so long, every morning & night)
I couldn't meet with Mark, but River is welcoming me & so kind all the time.
Because of Mark & River, my first impression of Seattle remained in my mind! Nice holyday! Thank you! May meet again^^"
2693137,48722606,2015-09-28,41419484,Scott,It's a neat little apartment in a great location. We came and went as we pleased. The cat and dog were very friendly. 
2693137,48923952,2015-09-29,25006617,Sankar,"Mark and River were very friendly and hospitable, they were good in communicating before and during my stay and easy to talk to. The house was in good condition and in a great neighborhood, I enjoyed my stay at their place. "
2693137,49154814,2015-10-01,7467435,Chris,The short stay with Mark and River was great. The place is clean with a great view of the river. The dog and cat are very friendly.
2693137,49637699,2015-10-05,5905641,Andre,"The place has a fantastic view on the lake and the space needle. Mark was very kindly and help us for everything (even some medical advices). To reach the pike place market amd downtown, it's easy with a bus line 200m from the appartment. 
And it's true, the cat made us her slave!"
2693137,52261152,2015-10-27,3474026,Chris,"Mark and River are amazing and friendly hosts. It was great to end the days chatting with them and their pets. He had good recommendations on what to check out in the city, and the view at their place is indeed amazing!"
2693137,52599595,2015-10-31,13573799,Steven,"Mark and River are awesome hosts! Super friendly and very accommodating when we first arrived. The view, as everyone described, is beautiful. I was out of the apartment for a majority of the time, however it was always nice to come back and chat with Mark or River about the day.

The bedroom itself was just enough room to unpack and relax. The bedroom, bathroom, and overall apartment was clean. Since I went to visit people in UW and did tourist attractions downtown, the buses by their apartment was extremely convenient. 

Last but not least, Luc and Queen Elizabeth were the starts of the apartment. My friend and I enjoyed playing with them everytime we got back. Super friendly pets and hosts :) Overall, if I'm in Seattle again, I'd definitely stay at Mark and River's!"
2693137,54226249,2015-11-16,5548765,Stanislav,"Amazing hosts, great location (40 min walk to downtown)"
2693137,55316447,2015-11-29,675798,Chor,"Mark and River have a lovely house with an even lovelier view of the lake! I couldn't stop admiring the view, honestly. The cat and the dog are adorable, and will definitely keep you company! This home is situated close to restaurants and such within walking distance, and was perfect for my one night stay- everything was ready and clean as it should be! They were both very welcoming hosts, and I couldn't have asked for more :) Thank you so much for your hospitality, I really appreciate it."
4948745,35848907,2015-06-22,36396178,Kristi,The host canceled this reservation 68 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4948745,37366042,2015-07-06,6559157,Michelisa,"Aliza was the ideal host. Responsive, detailed, and incredibly friendly, she made me and my boyfriend feel at home but was also respectful of our space. She struck the perfect balance between host and friend, which has been a rarity so far in my AirBnB experience."
4948745,38622986,2015-07-17,27689054,Tim,"Aliza was a great host.  She welcomed us into her home, showed us around and made time to ensure that we knew where everything local was.  The room is really nice.  The bed was super comfy - probably the nicest bed we've slept in throughout our AirBNB travels!  
We had access through the apartment and Aliza was very happy for us to cook and use her stuff.  (Just clean up folks and all is well!). The location in Queen Anne is great.  Local shops, coffee shops etc and the bus stop is right outside her place.  15 minutes into the centre of town on a bus.  We had a great evening cooking with her family one night and really enjoyed the whole experiece.  Thanks Aliza for such a great stay.  Highly recommended."
4948745,39515746,2015-07-24,30183464,Angela,"I had a lovely time at Eliza's place. Room is exactly as described, very comfy and well located. The bus is right across the street and within easy walking distance to restaurants, cafes and bars. Eliza was great and provided everything I could possibly need for my week in Seattle. "
4948745,40234276,2015-07-29,12467031,Florence,"We had a lovely stay. The location is perfect, not far away from downtown Seattle but in a more pleasant area, close to many restaurants and cafes and also the Kerry Park to watch the sunset over the city. The room was very comfortable. Aliza was a very nice host, she had drinks for us in the fridge... Too bad we couldn't spend more time with her. We would definitely recommend her place."
4948745,41098208,2015-08-04,36424121,Sabato,"Wonderful, friendly, and generous host. The room was as described if not better. I stayed during a week where temperatures were over 90 degrees and the room remained comfortable throughout. Apartment is in a really nice and accessible neighborhood. I loved my time in Seattle and Aliza was a big part of that. Many thanks :)"
4948745,42140414,2015-08-11,18990278,Aleks,"Aliza was AMAZING!

This was my first time in Seattle, I was traveling with a friend from the East coast, and we were in town attending a week long event at Key Arena with a nearly all day every day (for 7 days) schedule. 

Even with all that, Aliza was able to help us get settled while juggling work and a trip of her own. Hats off - and her place comes highly recommended from the both of us. 

If you're looking for a room to stay in Lower Queen Anne - stop looking. This is it! Aliza will take care of ya :)"
4948745,43075235,2015-08-17,32540646,Kelly,"My boyfriend and I had a great time staying with Aliza for the weekend! Her place is super cute and homey. She wasn't around all that much but was really friendly and helpful when we saw her! Also, the neighborhood and location could not have been more perfect, we would definitely come back! "
6990677,36920166,2015-07-02,1930928,Chris,"The space was very nice and clean; a perfect place for a couple to stay when visiting Seattle. The bathroom and kitchen had recently been re-done so everything was new and clean. We didn't really take advantage of the backyard, but calling it an oasis is fairly accurate: there was lots of vegetation (including bamboo) and a pond filled with goldfish. It was located in a nice, quiet neighborhood, with free parking and a 10-minute walk away from an express bus to downtown.
Eric, the host, was very nice and accommodating. He gave us advice on places to eat in the area, and for things to see. We even asked for a bigger frying pan to make breakfast and there was one outside our door the next day.
Would definitely recommend staying here."
6990677,37243127,2015-07-05,13346664,Jose,"Eric was extremely helpful. He made a great To Do list. Also a great recommendation to hike at Mount Pilchuk. 

The location is great and not far from downtown, maybe a 15 minute drive. You have to check our Bakery Nouveau, amazing little café close by. The room was spacious and clean. Everything available from shampoo to face wash, towels, etc. Kitchen had everything you may need and just let him know if something is missing. Just a couple of minutes from the water as well. 

Great host! Great place! "
6990677,37897466,2015-07-11,5856708,Michelle,"Eric was an amazing host. You can really tell he loves Seattle and meeting new people. Upon arrival, he gave us a quick tour and even had a 10 page list of things to do in the city which was great. 

The space was nice and cozy. It had a full kitchen and the place was really clean and easy to get into. His garden is beautiful. Definitely a plus when staying there. "
6990677,39092461,2015-07-20,9154776,Kim,"Eric's place is adorable and was amazingly cool while we visited (it was 90 outside!). We had a lovely time chatting to him about the area and he gave some great recommendations. The place is in a nice neighborhood in West Seattle and a pretty walk or short drive to Alki Beach or the Junction, where there are a lot of great restaurants. The space itself is below ground, but has plenty of light and there's plenty of blankets and board games!

Oh, and the garden is lovely and shaded, and the turtle is super cool. We sat out there one night and had a drink, Very relaxing. "
6990677,40771013,2015-08-02,36765875,Scott,"Very nice experience!! Host was very friendly but respectful of guest privacy. Super cozy, neat and clean. Surprisingly spacious and comfortable. The neighborhood is very nice and a short walk to the shore. Highly recommend!!  "
6990677,41991061,2015-08-10,6875087,Ronak,"Eric was a wonderful host! He provided detailed information about our visit and the apartment two days before our arrival, so we had everything we needed to arrive comfortably to his home. The apartment is cozy, clean, and seemingly newly renovated. West Seattle is a really special gem in the area--we likely never would have discovered it without staying here. Excellent food, arts, and music stores all within walking distance. We took the bus into Seattle which was so easy and convenient and also took advantage of the other wonderful places to see, taking the Ferry to Vashon island, and walking to Alki Beach. We used Lyft to get around to other events (we were in town for a wedding) which was also convenient--$18 and 15 minutes or less. Eric was very cordial, welcoming, and easy to contact and communicate with. He even left microwave popcorn for us to munch on, which we look full advantage of! We recommend this place highly, particularly if you are wanting to enjoy the greatness of the city of Seattle and the beautiful nature, neighborhoods, and waterfronts of the surrounding area. "
6990677,42870111,2015-08-16,36853471,Marco,"I (we) had a great time in Seattle. The flat is in a very quiet area, green, close to seaside and parks. With my girlfriend we went running and we felt regenerated. However, transportation to downtown is also easy accessible similar to supermarkets, pubs, and cafes in the area of Alaska junction. The flat is very clean, new, and well equipped. Eric gave us all the instructions and also left a friendly Seattle guide with hints for nice spots in the area. We loved it. He is also a very discrete presence.  We enjoyed a lot the stay here!"
6990677,43549526,2015-08-20,19929004,Joy,Eric was a wonderful host! He welcomed us into his home with a huge smile. We sat and chatted with him and had a wonderful time. His recommendations were spot on and very helpful. The apartment itself was clean and tidy and I had a great time flipping through his books. The location was great-very close to a main strip in West Seattle. We would happily stay there on our next visit. 
6990677,44667455,2015-08-28,39126504,Monika,"Eric's little oasis apartment in West Seattle was the perfect spot for us.  Everything was just as described only more beautiful than expected.  The apartment was spotless and was just right for two people.  Eric's back and side yards are gorgeous.  We met Eric the afternoon we arrived and he was very friendly.  He responded quickly to the two texts I sent him during our stay.
"
6990677,45107161,2015-08-31,4460246,Sarah,"Eric was an excellent host. He provided us with a local guide of things to do in the West Seattle area that set the stage for a terrific visit. His location is perfect; close to running/biking routes as well as to amazing restaurants, shops and grocery stores.  Eric was very accommodating and friendly. I appreciated the time he took to visit with us, his personal travel recommendations and meeting his tortoise, Rocky.  Would definitely recommend and hope to visit again."
6990677,45575234,2015-09-04,34480711,Andre,"ERIC was the best ! Awesome  hospitality,  great place to stay, beautiful  property  in a great location!  Eric was also  great to talk to  about areas to see."
6990677,45981435,2015-09-07,10944447,Christina & Cole,Eric's place was great!  We really enjoyed staying outside of the city in West Seattle.  We wouldn't have known about/seen this really cool side of town otherwise.  The basement apartment was just as described.  The bed was very comfortable and having the ability to wash clothes was a huge plus.  We had the pleasure of meeting Eric.  He was so kind and helpful before and during our stay.  He answered any questions I had very quickly and provided great information for us to really enjoy our time.  I would highly recommend staying here!
6990677,46922795,2015-09-14,31307619,Janeè,Eric has an quaint adorable basement apartment.  Although we never met Eric he was incredibly friendly and accommodating.  The apartment is very close to California Ave and we enjoyed some great pastries at Bakery Noveau.
6990677,48088618,2015-09-23,6934282,Justine,"Eric's place was clean and quaint. We have no complaints about his place. He provided us with some essential toiletries and there were some really cute touches. For example, he put freshly cut sunflowers in our room to greet us when we arrived and popcorn with a popcorn bowl in case we wanted to have a movie night.  Gracious host, would definitely stay there again!"
6990677,48917919,2015-09-29,42491301,Krystal,Eric was really nice and super helpful.  He left us great recommendations for food and places to check out.  Bakery Noveau is addictive and must have when there.  Two parks he recommended were awesome Jack Block park and Kubota park.  The space was perfect for us and sitting in the backyard was awesome! The location was good we could walk to places around the West Seattle area and downtown was just a water taxi away.  
6990677,49700360,2015-10-05,1096460,Stephanie,"Our stay in Eric's space was just what we hoped. It was clean, quiet, and close to public transportation. The neighborhood felt safe and we took several walks to the water and local places that Eric recommended. We would definitely recommend staying here!"
6990677,50893464,2015-10-15,2791511,Benjamin,Really wonderful full apartment to yourself in beautiful neighborhood really close to the water. It's clear Eric took a lot of care when preparing this room for guests. I stayed 5 days and it was a great way to explore around West Seattle. Super easy to come and go. Eric was super helpful and in touch just when I needed him. Bed was really comfy too - huge plus. Thanks for a great stay! 
6990677,57495749,2015-12-26,22649713,Trista (JJ),I needed an escape from my noisy apartment during Christmas so I booked Eric's place which is about a mile away.  His basement apartment is quite stylish and comfortable.  Eric accommodated a couple of my requests (thank-you!) and I got the rest I desperately needed--the place was quiet and the bed was very comfortable. It was definitely as described; no basement odor or musty smell despite being on the ground level.   My favorite part was the nice big shower with funky iridescent tiles.
8703208,50406890,2015-10-11,11175287,Trisha,"This was one of the best stays I've had at Airbnb so far. The house was clean, cute, and spacious and the location is perfect. Angela is so sweet and was easy to communicate with from start to finish. I would 100% book with Angela again."
8703208,51378652,2015-10-19,45160536,Lisa,"The house was very nice, clean, and only 1/2 block from the water.  Such a great location, and very comfortable.  There were even bikes for our use, although we unfortunately didn't have time to use them.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and it was a very good way to start."
8703208,52742606,2015-11-01,2760522,Luz Maria,"Angela's lovely home in West Seattle is even better than the pictures shown. Totally recommend staying here! House is clean, well organized, with 2 bikes to use (with locks and helmets) and located half a block from beautiful Alki Beach and lots of restaurants. I hope to come back soon!"
8703208,55214889,2015-11-29,46424376,Elinor,"We loved the location of the house, in a quiet neighborhood and really close to the beach. Angela was fast in responding to my questions."
7725597,48797375,2015-09-28,12566868,Kate,"Nora's spot in Capitol Hill was the perfect, cozy getaway during our weekend in Seattle.  It's a quick 10-minute walk to Pike/Pine, where most of Cap Hill's restaurants, nightlife, and shopping are located. It was nice to be a bit out of the thick of things - we could seek out the lively part of the neighborhood, but could also chill out at the apartment. 

Nora made us feel at ease and it was fun chatting with her as she showed me around her place. We kept in touch over the weekend and I always felt comfortable texting her with any questions. 

Overall, we had a great time and I highly recommend Nora's spot to anyone looking for a laid-back vibe In Cap Hill. "
7725597,49932631,2015-10-07,16826999,Nick,"Such an awesome spot! 

Nora was super helpful with the accommodations. The directions were spot on and the handwritten note was a nice touch. 

The studio itself was super clean with a lot of great natural light. It was big enough to fit a friend and myself (two grown men) very comfortably.  The quirkiness of the studio really sets it apart from other spots I've stayed. The bed is in a large ""closet"", which made for such a comfortable sleep. The HD cable and fast wifi came in handy for the early morning Sunday football games and a bit of leftover weekday work.  And for those who care, the water pressure in the shower was a 10/10. 

Location, location, location! It was about a 5-10 min walk to a lively neighborhood full of great restaurants and bars/nightlife. About a 5 min uber ride to downtown/10 to CenturyLink.  

Although Nora was a newer host, she absolutely killed it! I'll be back to Seattle for sure and hopefully her studio will be available again! 

"
7725597,50519226,2015-10-12,6369119,Jp,Nora's place is perfectly located. It's very comfy and cozy. And Nora is very responsive and left some excellent beer in the fridge. I'd definitely stay there again.
7725597,51932682,2015-10-25,14859379,Nancy,"Exactly what we were looking for!  We were unfamiliar with Seattle, but chose this neighborhood for it's proximity to the University area.  It's a great neighborhood, plenty of restaurants and bars, close to bus stops so it was easy to get virtually anywhere you need to go around Seattle.  

Nora was a perfect host.  We had a lot of questions before the trip, and about getting around the city, and her advice was valuable.  She was flexible and gracious when we had to add another traveler.  She was clear about the details, 4 people makes this place a bit snug, but we knew we wouldn't be spending a lot of time indoors.  

In our case, all of us new to exploring Seattle, this apartment was a comfortable, homey base camp with everything we needed.
We have to mention how much we also loved the Liberty, a bar around the corner, who serve amazing sushi and have a friendly, professional staff.  

Nora was helpful, accessible, respectful, conscientious, everything you hope for in a host.  The apartment was just what we were hoping it would be.  Thank you, Nora!"
7725597,53514758,2015-11-09,8304079,Lauren,This was another great Airbnb experience. Nora's 'Eclectic Spacious Cap Hill Apt' is in a great location. It was a comfortable easy stay!
7725597,54249378,2015-11-17,45773598,Josh,Nora was a great host. She answered all my questions in a timely fashion and was more than willing to recommend great local favorites. Place was neat and cozy- perfect for two.

4454295,32228867,2015-05-16,1298855,Anya,"We had a wonderful stay at Nadia’s place. It is everything one can want when visiting Seattle. It is in a very nice, quiet neighborhood which is perched on a hilltop with awesome views opening all around. The neighborhood is full of trees, bushes, flowers of off kinds – paradise within a city. 
The apartment is clean, tastefully decorated and very cozy, with perfect lighting. The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen is well-equipped even for elaborate meals. We would prefer to have a car, but we were fine without it, since we didn’t have to go downtown daily. Two grocery stores are within a short walk away. Restaurants abound and also easily reachable on foot.
We thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful home and neighborhood, even going to a pool and a work-out studio several times a week. We will definitely want to stay here again every time we visit Seattle, and we will recommend this place to my friends.
"
4454295,34936685,2015-06-14,26539353,Katie,"Beautiful home in lovely neighbourhood. This is a lovely house; perfect for a holiday but feels like a home. Quiet with all the amenities you need and some outdoor space to enjoy the summer. Was clean and tidy with great information about Seattle provided. The host was hospitable and accommodating with any requests. 

Queen Anne is a lovely area with it's own community feel but very close to all the main attractions in Seattle and on easy to use bus routes. 

Would def recommend this and stay here again. "
4454295,35919719,2015-06-23,31102229,Dawn,"We had a great first experience with airbnb.  This home was exactly as listed and our host was very accommodating.  Our host provided us with all the necessary essentials and information about the home and area to ensure a pleasant stay.  The house is in a great location in Upper Queen Anne with many conveniences within walking distance.
We would definitely stay at this home again."
4454295,36532252,2015-06-29,1843594,Cindy,"I loved staying at Nadia's place. It's very cozy and in a walkable and charming neighborhood. The street parking was easy and it was easy to get to my destination at the Seattle Center everyday. It was nice having a little outdoor area to enjoy the summer nights and was very comfortable. Nadia was also super helpful with making sure 2 USPS packages got to the home safely, which is extremely kind of her to take the extra time to do that!"
4454295,37699720,2015-07-09,6884030,Kristina,"Nadia was so welcoming and helpful.  Great resources on Seattle right on the entry table,  a plethora of food close by,  stores,  and other shopping. Can't begin to say what a wonderful place to stay while exploring Seattle! Quick access to everything,  safe neighborhood,  beautiful and comfortable.  Thank you again for the hospitality! "
4454295,40638949,2015-08-01,37350950,Brenda,Nadia has a beautiful home in a great neighborhood.   It's close to a park as well as shops and restaurants.  It was a perfect getaway.  
4454295,56654608,2015-12-16,28098514,Kevin,"We had an excellent experience at Nadia's home.  The house is well-maintained with everything you need to make yourself at home as well as storage space for whatever you bring with you.  The bed is particularly comfortable.
The neighborhood (Upper Queen Anne) is quiet with easy on-street parking and lots of shops and restaurants a short walk away.  We were always able to park on the street very close to the house without difficulty.  There are two grocery stores and probably a dozen restaurants within a five block walk along with a variety of other stores.  There are also spectacular vistas of Puget Sound and downtown Seattle within walking distance.  There was very little noise, astonishingly so for such an urban location.
Nadia responds quickly to questions and requests and was an excellent long-distance host.  We stayed in the house for over four months and everything ran very smoothly."
3890786,22158533,2014-10-31,6810967,Nina,"the house is in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood in Seattle. we worked in Bellevue so had to commute daily, which was very easy given the location of the flat.
the owner was very helpful and always available. thank you very much, Seattle felt like our home :-) only one minor thing: Internet connection in some spots of the apartment was poorly, so communication via Internet was sometimes difficult! other than that: perfect! "
3890786,24673246,2015-01-01,1431132,Tarzan,"We arrived to a very clean suite with a beautiful view! The suite is older, but kept very clean, great beds, comfortable pillows, and a retro tub! We enjoyed our visit and would recommend this place to others."
8690491,49752602,2015-10-05,775960,Ana,"Maya's apartment is perfect for those who would like to stay right in the center of Seattle in a nice quiet neighborhood. The view out her window is incredible! The apt was very welcoming and comfy, outfitted with everything we needed. 

Maya was incredibly helpful and accommodating through our booking process and stay. We will definitely stay again on our next visit!"
8690491,50382293,2015-10-11,13007794,Catherine,"We struck gold with this little gem:) Maya was a wonderful host, greeting us with a thoughtful card and full run-through of the super funky neighbourhood we were lucky to land in. We never would have explored this area otherwise. She also too the time to write out tons of great local restaurants and drink spots to check out and gave us a good feel for the hood and surrounding areas. Her apartment had amazing views, was immaculate and she even left us a basket of toiletries, in case we were caught out. Always easy to reach, she answered all our questions immediately. She even brought us apples from her family farm when we said goodbye. Highly recommend and we would definitely stay again!"
8690491,51356486,2015-10-19,45628317,Eliana,For my first Airbnb experience I think Maya was exceptional. My fiancé and I fell in love with her cozy studio! It had everything we needed and was very comfortable for our stay! Maya is very friendly and even gave us plenty of pointers for transportation as well as places to eat or go drink which was extremely helpful. We loved pesos! Waking up to that incredible view every morning was lovely. We would definitely stay here again if we ever come back to Seattle! 
8690491,52117552,2015-10-26,29656423,Grant,"Clean, cozy, centrally located apartment. Love staying here!"
8690491,53067250,2015-11-04,46325331,Katie,We had a great time staying at Maya's. The apartment was clean and comfortable. It was within walking distance to many attractions and restaurants. And we loved the view from her apartment! Would definitely recommend.
8690491,53984325,2015-11-15,46027958,Johnathan,"Maya is an incredible host! Upon arrival, she met me at the apartment, and showed me where to find parking, as well as start giving me some advice on cool local spots. She was very thorough, even writing down the wifi password, parking spot # as well as helpful reminders. 

Maya is an incredibly thoughtful person, and even left us a personalized card, with a chocolate bar welcoming us to her place. Fresh flowers were placed around the studio, and the apartment was immaculate. She ensures you have your own personal space for your clothes as well as toiletries, and even left us a box of travel toiletries just in case we had forgotten something. 

Some advice to future guests: Don't be intimidated to have a drink with maya upon arrival. I had a cocktail with her after check in, and we had a wonderful conversation! Really helped ease the tension of staying in a stranger's place for 4 days. Maya is very easy to get along with, strike conversation, and is a treasure box of ideas for good places to eat, as well as fun things to do in Seattle. The whole point of this website is to meet new people, network, and secondly to find cheaper alternatives to hotels.... 

This was my first airbnb experience, and I don't think I could have had a better experience! This apartment has the most breathtaking views you will ever see in Seattle, and the view from the rooftop is to die for!

We have never been happier to not stay in a hotel on vacation as we were during this trip to Seattle. "
8690491,55041299,2015-11-27,4722099,Tammy,"Maya was wonderful. She let us check in early, secured a parking spot for us, and made sure we had everything we needed. Her apartment is great, too. It's clean and cozy and in a good location in Lower Queen Anne. If you don't mind walking, it's not that far to downtown and Pike Place Market (maybe 1.5 miles). If you do, it's just a short $7 Uber ride away."
8690491,55387153,2015-12-01,45952429,Carly,Maya was very welcoming and personable! She was easily accessible throughout my stay and provided me with a wonderful temporary home. Her apartment has a gorgeous view of the water and the sunsets I watched from her couch were breathtaking. I've fallen in love with Queen Anne and all that it has to offer. I'm so excited to visit Seattle again! Thank you for all of your hospitality and kindness Maya! 
8690491,55904538,2015-12-07,23333850,Summerly,"Maya was fantastic! She’s a very thoughtful host and her apartment was perfect. It was calming, homey and gave a great view of the water/sunset. It really is perfect location to relax but be close to all the things that anyone would want to visit in Seattle. Queen Anne is a wonderful neighborhood where you can explore and feel like a local. Everything is in walking distance. I would recommend walking to the Seattle Center and taking the monorail downtown to WestLake. After a full day of adventuring, it was great to settle into this wonderful home away from home. Thank you Maya – it was a great experience!  
"
8690491,57437461,2015-12-26,47517276,Emily,"Maya was absolutely fantastic to work with! Communicated well before, during, and after our stay. Her place was perfect for my boyfriend and I, and she truly went out of her way to make it extra special. She even got a small tree since we were staying over Christmas! Her apartment was exactly like the pictures and extremely clean, but everything felt usable. We would love to stay at Maya's again!"
904057,3585290,2013-02-19,587956,Steven,The cottage was very modern and cool. Perfect for my needs and Errin was great. This is a good jumping off point for Ballard restaurant and coffee shop ++ scene and Shilshole touring and excellent transportation downtown. Huge deck and hot tub are a plus for warmer months.
904057,3636618,2013-02-26,2077073,Connor,"""My girlfriend and I stayed in Errin's Mini-Home for a long weekend and had a great experience. The Mini-Home was very efficient, tidy and well-done. It had nice amenities and was the perfect place for a couple for the weekend.

Errin was very friendly and accommodating, and made our stay very comfortable. She was ready to answer any questions we had, and she even left some breakfast items for us in the fridge.

We really enjoyed the Ballard neighborhood as well. Within a 15 minute walk from the Mini-Home, there are lots of nice shops, restaurants and bars. The location is a little bit north of Downtown Seattle, but we were able to take a bus into Downtown and to access other parts of the city.
 
Overall, we had a great experience and would recommend Errin's Mini-Home to future guests!"""
904057,3873984,2013-03-23,2791479,Timothy,"Errin's ""Mini-Home"" was absolutely perfect for my stay. Parking available right in front-""Free"". Walking distance to food or shopping. Only 15 min. drive to downtown Seattle. She was always available for any questions but I always felt extreme privacy during my stay. Don't forget to ask about her Pizza!!! Highly recommend Errin & her ""Mini-Home"" for your stay near Seattle!"
904057,3906767,2013-03-26,5074648,Cheryl  (And Ron),"We really enjoyed Errin's ""Mini-Home""-- The location is very convenient for us--so close to family for visits.  Easy to use the bus system too!  We really like the Ballard neighborhood--very walkable and friendly.   Parking is on street.
Everything you need for a great stay is thoughtfully provided.   The unit is sparkling clean, very well appointed, and you will enjoy the privacy.  Wireless works well as does the TV.
The  unit's double-size bed is located in the loft --which is accessed with a sturdy loft ladder that pulls out when in use--and stacks back against the wall when not in use--a great solution!.  
Originally, I was a little concerned about navigating the ladder--especially for nighttime visits to the bathroom.  However, I had no problems--even with a slightly bad knee.   
The kitchenette was very serviceable--the small (under counter) refrigerator works well and is large enough to easily hold a half-gallon of milk on the door.  The bathroom includes a large neo-angle shower.  Hot water is on-demand and worked well.  
We will definitely stay again!  Kudos to Errin for sharing the Mini-Home--makes staying in Ballard a breeze!"
904057,3938543,2013-03-29,416686,Arie,"I absolutely loved the stay at our piece of Seattle in the mini home graciously hosted by Errin! We enjoyed every aspect of this quaint place. Perfect on street parking, without the hotel prices equivalent to the cost of the stay. We loved strolling the neighborhood and happened upon a perfect pub a block or two away. I recently had to drive through seattle there and back in one day and cried passing the famous exit because I really had wished I was staying the night and especially the memories that come with Seattle Minihome. This is perfect for a couple with a small child or a business traveler. I am so found of this design and even took a tour video for my montage of our trip. We were surprised with treats and greeted by Errin to get the ins and outs of the how to work it. The space is perfect quite and quaint. I do not want you to look for any other rental because Errin's home has it all!  "
904057,4000364,2013-04-02,5074648,Cheryl  (And Ron),"This was the second ""weekend"" stay we made while visiting our kids who live in Ballard.  We came in one weekend, left during the week, and came back the next weekend.  Each stay was three days.  (I reviewed, in depth, the first stay.  Wanted to be as descriptive as possible so that prospective guests would know what to expect from a ""guest's"" perspective.)
This last weekend did not disappoint!  We really love Errin's place.  
The privacy is wonderful--we were only a short walk from our kid's place and being able to park the vehicle and walk back and forth was great.  If one wants to venture further--without a vehicle--the bus line is only steps away. The Seattle bus system is very efficient, in my opinion.  We've ridden it all over the city--to the downtown--and even used it to catch the commuter train to the airport.
A lot of amenities are packed into a small area--perfect for a couple.  Errin is a great hostess.  I would not hesitate to recommend her place."
904057,4047644,2013-04-05,1761630,Alex & Stacey,"Thank you Errin and Co. For a lovely stay. The time was perfect for our time away in Seattle. We loved the hot tub, the sun on the deck, and coming ""home"" to the little house. You were oh so gracious and welcoming. The bus was very easy to access and we loved the location, which was close to so many activities. We loved eating your amazing pizza on the beach and strolling it off afterwards.   We will come again!"
904057,4221399,2013-04-20,4873556,Bronwynne,"We had such a pleasant stay at the Seattle Mini Home. It was very cozy, clean, quiet and in close proximity to everything. Our host was so sweet and made us feel right at home. I will definitely be staying there again when I travel to Seattle. "
904057,4269008,2013-04-23,4743978,Sreeram,"Errin was a perfect host. My wife and I had a great stay in her mini-home. It was comfortable, private and conveniently located.  "
904057,4324106,2013-04-28,5452474,Jason,"Errin was quick to respond to messages about our arrival and was there to greet us when we made it into Ballard. The mini-home is an adorable place to stay and was perfect for our 4 nights in Seattle. The bus stop was so close and convenient it was a breeze going downtown and back. We reserved our last night for Pizza at Errin's business called Veraci's which was unbelievable! We hope to stay in Errin's mini-home if we can make it back to Seattle in the next year or two. The hot tub was an added bonus as well, we were lucky to have such great weather."
904057,4381602,2013-05-01,5803386,Laci,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle.  Very close to fun shops and great restaurants.  The house is small but has everything you need for a weekend trip.  I wouldn't suggest staying here with more than 2 people but it was perfect for my husband and myself.  Errin really makes you feel at home and even provided toiletries.  Although we didn't get time to use the hot tub, it is just steps from the cottage and  on a beautiful sunny deck. We would stay here again on our next trip up north."
904057,4511526,2013-05-09,1381365,Lisa,"Errin's mini home is fantastic! Great location, great host, great hot tub with view of Mt. Rainer! One of my best air bnb experiences. Thanks Errin!"
904057,4549791,2013-05-12,5291553,Dan,We absolutely loved Errin's Seattle Mini Home! It was perfect for  our needs. The Ballard area was so great we barely left! 
904057,5076351,2013-06-11,4924185,Scott,"We stayed for a month in the ""mini-home""--it was a really wonderful experience all around.  Errin made us feel extremely welcome, and she was always helpful with all of the necessities (towels, sheets, directions, ideas for restaurants and things to do).  And, it is true, you can see Mt. Rainier from the porch.  That is not something we will soon forget!

The location is key to note--Ballard is ideal if you want to be within walking distance to good restaurants and a cool neighborhood--also close to Carkeek, Discovery, and other parks.  Also very close driving distance to downtown Seattle, UW, Queen Anne, and other spots to visit.  

We had no problems with street parking, though we walked to many of the places we went.

Can't say enough good about Errin's mini-home."
904057,5144752,2013-06-15,1619148,Deane,"We were only in town a few days, and had quite a bit to accomplish in that time.  Errin's mini-home was perfect for our needs.  Our flight in was delayed about 14 hours, but Errin took it all in stride, even though she was far busier at the time than she had previously anticipated.

Check-in and check-out were effortless, the mini-home was very well equipped, and when I asked if salt and pepper were already present, Errin bought them for us (in nice grinders) within a day, along with olive oil!  Errin is highly entrepreneurial, which means she's creative, thoughtful, and responsive.  She also provided an electric radiator--unprompted--when she noticed it was a bit chilly for us (we were coming from a very warm climate).

The mini-home is in a great location, with easy access to downtown as well as North Seattle and Shoreline.  There are bus lines on the same block, and street parking was very easy to find, usually right in front of the house or a few car lengths up, day or night.

This was a great place, and we'd love to come back!"
904057,5226171,2013-06-19,5568957,Janet,"Perfect home away from home. everything you need, bus stop nearby for access to downtown. the neighborhoods is charming and a view of Mt.Rainier- if you are lucky to have clear weather which I did! Errin was totally hands off but available via text if needed.I could not have asked for a better place to stay. I could be outside or in beats a hotel room. I would definitely go back if I ever get to Seattle again."
904057,5427774,2013-06-30,5076085,Paul,"My partner and I stayed for nine days in Errin's summer cottage. We had an excellent stay, both in terms of the home itself and in terms of the location. The home was comfortable and equipped with almost everything you could reasonably expect. The location was convenient for Ballard itself (with its plentiful bars and restaurants) as well as other interesting neighbourhoods like Fremont and Green Lake. Downtown is an easy bus ride away, too. Recommended!"
904057,5576125,2013-07-07,135739,Sandra,"Errin's house was wonderful and cozy, and she was very helpful and unfailingly friendly. The outside porch is also a huge bonus. It's also in one of the most pleasant parts of Seattle, several good restaurants in the area, and the wonderful Top Banana fruit/vegetable store just around the corner, which is definitely worth a visit. Whole-heartedly recommend this place. 
"
904057,5847027,2013-07-19,1446705,Diane,"Errins place is amazing !  
So private and comfortable. You will find everything you need. We would go back in a heart beat.
"
904057,5908846,2013-07-22,6511017,Yasamin,"Errin's mini-home was lovely. It was very clean, comfortable, and well-equipped. The neighborhood was nice to walk around in, and we easily used public transportation to get to and from downtown and the University neighborhood. We would certainly stay there again!"
904057,6482707,2013-08-14,2511940,Amy,"We loved staying in the Ballard mini-home! Errin was an excellent hostess, and the space was just perfect for us. We had a wonderful time and we highly recommend staying here - we hope to be back sometime! The location really worked for us - we were about a ten minute walk from the main part of Ballard, and an easy bus ride to the airport and downtown. Errin really took care of us and made sure we had everything we needed. Stay here if you get the chance!"
904057,6653816,2013-08-20,6187317,Theresa,"This house was great!  It was private, cozy, and very close to so much!  We were there visiting our daughter, who lives less than a mile from the house.  Ballard is a really cool neighborhood, and we found several restaurants and a very nice grocery store within walking distance.
Erinn was wonderful...she has made this house a true gem, and we hope to stay there again on our next trip out.  The best part was being able to see the mountain from the patio!  I was so excited by that!  Climbing the ladder to the sleeping area made me feel like a kid in a treehouse. :) The only ""problem"" was that the bed wasn't as comfortable as our own...but we run into that a lot.
Erinn's restaurant, Veraci Pizza, was really good.  The pizza was just like my husband likes it, woodfired with a thin crust.  We will be sure to visit there again, too!
Thanks, Erinn, for a lovely home away from home. "
904057,6842851,2013-08-27,593731,Mountaine,"Errin was a great host.  We were very very happy with this tiny house at an affordable price in a great location, and recommend it highly to those on a budget."
904057,7064953,2013-09-05,2648320,Crys,"Cute, quaint little home away from home. Had everything we needed for a week-long stay in the area and was conveniently a short block from the D-line bus to Seattle Center. Walkable neighborhood with fun shops to browse off Market St. Thanks so much for your hospitality! "
904057,7155148,2013-09-09,2610616,Irene,The mini-home is so cute and the hot tub was great!  We had a very nice stay there.  Errin was friendly and easy to communicate with.  She got a baby crib for us to use and had a well stocked Keurig coffee maker.  I would stay here again and would recommend it to friends.
904057,7248273,2013-09-13,2028012,Mel,Overall great experience. Everything we needed was provided and more. Location was a short (i.e. 5-10 min) drive to downtown Ballard and the Locks. Don't hesitate to consider booking with Errin. 
904057,7323475,2013-09-16,5759857,Jessica,"The Mini-Home is great! Errin greeted us on arrival and gave some great restaurant recommendations in the area an showed us around. Her place is private, VERY clean, and comfortable. The D line to downtown and Seattle Center really is just steps away, plus just a short walk to all the Ballard neighborhood places. The hot tub was really nice after a long day of site seeing on our feet. We loved it and would certainly recommend it to others and hope to stay there again on our next visit to Seattle. "
904057,7574253,2013-09-25,5501442,Samantha,"The mini home was clean and comfortable. The location was really great, just steps from the D line bus stop which goes straight to Downtown in about  20 minutes. It was also a 15 minute walk from the popular bar and restaurant street in Ballard and a 40 minute walk from the zoo.  The crossfit gym is close by too. 
Errin was really helpful and friendly. We would definitely stay here again.  It is a lot more personal and more practical than a hotel. "
904057,7740767,2013-10-01,6146472,Paul,"This is a great place to stay in Seattle. Errin’s Mini Home is really clean, well equipped and cosy; it had everything we needed for our 4 night stay. The bedroom is upstairs via a ladder which was really cute and fun, although it did make night time trips to the bathroom a bit of an adventure! Errin was a thoughtful host and even left an umbrella on our porch as the weather was really bad during our stay. The house is in a great location for Ballard, it’s a 15 minute walk to lots of great bars and restaurants and about 10 minutes from supermarkets. The neighbourhood is really safe and in a lovely part of Seattle. The house was only a two minute walk to the bus stop into Seattle centre, which ran every 15 minutes and took approx 35 minutes.  We’d definitely stay here again!"
904057,7811110,2013-10-04,7864590,Christie," This place was perfect! Very small but had everything I needed, and Errin was a great host. She made sure I had everything I needed but gave me complete privacy during my stay. As others have mentioned, the loft would be problematic for anyone with mobility issues, and if you're staying in the winter, bring some warm clothes, as it takes a while for the portable heater to get the place warm. The best thing about the house is that it was absolutely spotless. I'll definitely stay here on future trips!"
904057,8132674,2013-10-17,7174083,Ciaran+Hannah,"We had a really great stay, unfortunately one of us became ill during our Settle stay and this was the perfect place to stay warm, comfortable and recover. Very good location, I would recommend blue dog diner down the street for massive pancakes and El Camion across the street for incredible mexican! Would definitely stay again :)
"
904057,8248046,2013-10-22,6170304,Amanda,"This is way better than booking a hotel, as the price is much more affordable and in my opinion, you get way more for your money. We loved having a kitchen to keep our leftovers in after eating out and Errin stocks it to the brim with everything you need and more (coffee, tea, snacks, etc.). It's in a great location that felt like we were close to everything and the street parking was always plentiful - we found a spot out front every evening when we returned. It was also great having the privacy of the mini home to come and go as we pleased.
The upstairs bed area is admittedly a bit tight but worked fine for us, as we're on the smaller side (I'm 5'3"" and my fiancé is 5'7""). Keep in mind you may have to be a bit adventurous to go up and down a ladder every time you want to get in or out of bed.
Errin is a phenomenal host. She's friendly and had the place spotless for our arrival. If we ever know anyone visiting the area, we'll definitely be sending them her way. Not to mention we'll be sure to book this place anytime we decide to visit the city again!"
904057,10103903,2014-01-31,11108282,Winnie,"The mini home in the Ballard district of Seattle is comfortable, has all the required amenities and is conveniently located near a major street.  Additionally, Errin was the perfect hostess.  She was available if I needed but also allowed me privacy.   I highly recommend Errin's mini home."
904057,10235411,2014-02-08,1439654,SAmi,"The mini house is great !!!
Perfect location , not far from downtown and surrounded with lots of things to see and do .
The house it self is very compact and private with everything you need .
You do have to climb down the ladder in at night to use the washroom :) "
904057,10339760,2014-02-14,11902553,Brett,"I travel to Seattle often for work and Errin's Mini-Home was a great place to stay in one of my favorite Seattle neighborhoods. It is a cozy little place to yourself close to the bus lines to downtown, walking distance to downtown Ballard. It is a few blocks from Ballard Market, the best Grocery store in town, and there are great restaurants within a couple of blocks. Errin had the place all ready for me when I arrived and was quick to respond when I needed something. I plan to stay in the Mini-Home again!"
904057,10716749,2014-03-04,11234494,Jennifer,Mine and my boyfriends stay in Seattle was great and the mini home was the perfect place to come home to after long days of site seeing. It was warm and cozy and had all the things we needed to make us feel at home. Errin was very helpful and easy to reach if needed. I would definitely recommend the mini home!
904057,10863553,2014-03-10,12703472,Angeline,"I was so in love with this mini-home! Cute, clean, cozy, comfy bed, and conveniently close to food and transit to downtown. Oh, and Errin was lovely and helpful. -Angeline"
904057,10922970,2014-03-13,11998476,Nicole,The Mini-home was so cute and provided everything we needed.  Errin was very welcoming and helpful.  Highly recommended!
904057,11076689,2014-03-19,4976881,Lincoln,"We had an incredible time in Seattle and Errin's mini-home was, not only in a great location but also met all of our needs.  We would highly recommend staying at her place if you ever visit the Seattle area.  We brought our daughter with us and Errin went out of her way to provide us with a pac-n-play for our daughter to sleep in.  One place that we loved for local food was Uneeda Burger ((website hidden)).  Fresh, affordable, and a great environment.  Thanks again Errin and Seattle for helping our family make memories we will never forget!!!"
904057,11240380,2014-03-26,5125790,Ting,"This place was fantastic, my parents were in town and i chose this place as it was a quick 3 minute walk from my house. 

House: it's small but incredible cozy and comfortable. The stairs up and down the loft was a bit daunting for parents who are in their 60s, but they got over it after a few tries. Kitchen and Bathroom were both very clean.

Hostess: Errin was a great hostess, i never get to meet her in person but we were in constant contact days before and during the stay, she gave me a great sense of her presence and support during the stay.

Highly recommended.

904057,11467298,2014-04-04,6732370,Jake,"Quiet, clean, and very cozy. Errin was a great host and her place fit our needs perfectly! "
904057,11616116,2014-04-09,12301776,Rachel,"I would definitely recommend staying here! The house was wonderful to come back to after each day of touring the city, and Errin provided us with everything we needed. She was easy to contact and super welcoming. The bed was really comfortable too! "
904057,11706524,2014-04-13,3372773,Lindsey,"This mini-home was perfect for our stay in Ballard. Errin has thought through every detail and she even provided a pack-n-play crib for our infant! The location was easy to access and street parking was easy to find. In addition, Errin was very accommodating to our late arrival time and made us feel totally at ease!"
904057,12370984,2014-04-30,13004080,Daniela,"We very much enjoyed our stay at the Mini-Home. We loved the space, having our own little kitchen with fully functioning appliances (fridge, stove, coffee maker, microwave, etc.), a living room, and a separate sleeping area. We enjoyed having our privacy but our host, Errin, was always available to answer any questions we had. Everything was very clean. There is street parking, and it is a short car ride to Seattle, downtown Ballard, or Fremont. We hope to be back soon!

"
904057,12528607,2014-05-05,11789791,Sonia,My daughter and I were very happy in your mini-home.  We had everything we needed.  The place was clean and tidy.  We loved the neighborhood and easy walk to downtown Ballard.  Having the supply of coffee for our morning fix was an added perk. Thank you so much.  
904057,12816467,2014-05-12,12214467,Danielle,My girlfriend and I really loved the mini home. It was my first airbnb experience and it went great. We didn't get the chance to meet Errin but she was available if we needed her. But we didn't! Everything was as described and stocked. We didn't do any cooking but you could easily make a great meal in the kitchen. We loved getting in the hot tub for a few minutes each night. Ballard is a great neighborhood and there was parking within a few houses of the home. I hope my next experience goes as smoothly as this one!
904057,12960698,2014-05-15,1018677,Augustin,"Errin is such a great host and her Mini-Home is neat and well-equipped with everything you need. You will find plenty of coffee, tea and other morning treats in the fridge. Nice neighborhood with plenty of parking places on the street. Will come back."
904057,13172993,2014-05-21,9209827,Lynn,Errin and her daughter were friendly but not intrusive. The little house was neat and clean. The bed was very comfortable. Location was excellent. Having a wall clock for those of us who do not wear a watch would have been handy. We definitely enjoyed our stay !!!
904057,13500792,2014-05-29,8785214,Johnny,"This place was in a perfect location for us while we were visiting Seattle. We were only a few miles away from downtown Seattle and everything was easy to get to by car. The mini-home was indeed a mini-home, but it served us well for everything we needed. We did not use the kitchen although it was available to us for use. We did use the hot tub that was available to us which was awesome after walking around the entire day. We would return to the mini-home if we visit Seattle again and would recommend this place to anyone!"
904057,13649327,2014-06-02,11493122,Megan,"This was our first AirBnB experience and I have a feeling it's going to be hard to beat! Working with Erinn was absolutely fantastic. My husband and I stayed in her Ballard mini-home while traveling to Seattle the week of our wedding. Booking was easy and Erinn was quick to respond to our reservation request and questions. We met Erinn briefly after checking in and saw her once during our stay. Though we didn't find we needed anything, it was great to know that Erinn was a quick text message away. This cozy guest house does offer a surprising amount of storage space. It was a great place for me, my, mom, and my aunt to get ready on the wedding day (with a photographer capturing it all) and a lovely retreat from all of the festivities. Errinn keeps the mini-house fully stocked with towels, shower supplies, coffee, and cooking supplies. Though we didn't find we needed anything during our stay, it was great knowing Erinn was a quick text message away. Staying in Ballard offers a great local perspective with plenty of coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance. Major attractions are a quick ride away. I highly recommend Erinn's mini-home and would without question stay here again. Thank you so much for everything! "
904057,13821918,2014-06-05,4535455,Dara,"Errin was a wonderful host. My boyfriend arrived later than expected, and we were able to get into the Mini-Home without disrupting Errin and her daughter. The home itself is as clean as a hotel and as homey as a summer getaway. Errin provides more than enough of everything. It's as if she really spent time thinking about what a guest might need if they wanted to feel comfortable.

Also the hot tub was exactly what we needed on our final night in Seattle."
904057,13907045,2014-06-08,2716657,Ann,"The small house was adorable, clean and well appointed, and the Ballard location can't be beat. The amenities were exactly as described and everything we needed was on hand. Thoughtful details like shampoo, conditioner, and soap were much appreciated.

Errin was a fantastic host -- very accommodating and responsive to any needs we had. We had a late flight out on our last day and she let us stay beyond check out time, which was amazing. Loved her recommendations for the nieghbourhood. Would certainly stay again should we pass through Seattle."
904057,15171905,2014-07-04,12255079,Janis,"Errin's Mini-Home was wonderful and we loved staying there. It was very clean, well equipped, nicely decorated and located in a nice and safe-feeling neighborhood that had a good bus connection to the city centre of Seattle. Mini-Home is also in a walking distance from the center of Ballard which is also a really nice and lively place. Errin was very welcoming and friendly person. We really recommend this place and would ourselves go back if we one day return to Seattle. "
904057,15387441,2014-07-08,11853029,Tammy,"Errin has done mini-home RIGHT!! Hospitality and amenities make it the perfect home away from home. It's comfortable in every way, and close to anything we wanted during our stay. We small town folk have anxiety being in the big city, but this adorable place definitely took the edge off."
904057,15809712,2014-07-16,7038755,Craig And Maureen,"Errin and her mini-home were great.  We enjoyed having coffee on the porch and in the sitting area of the mini-home.  The location is only 9 blocks from Market street and a few more blocks to all the excitement in Ballard.  We had a ball exploring the restaurants, shops and coffee shops within walking distance.  (We love to walk) Coffee, a great fruit market and two grocery stores are even closer.  This is a great spot for exploring Ballard.  Errin checked in to ensure we had everything we needed and made it clear she was easily available via text.  We will use the mini-home again when we come out to visit our boys."
904057,16336405,2014-07-26,12648101,Michael,"An absolute joy! The mini-home is exactly as described (even more awesome in real life!) it is kept VERY clean and in a great location/neighborhood - great for strolling or catching an easy bus downtown. Although we didn't have the pleasure of meeting Errin during our stay, she was only a text away for anything we needed."
904057,16761063,2014-08-02,11532485,Natalie,Everything was as described and expected. Errin was a lovely host and even helped us out with a portable crib for our baby. The location of the mini home was perfect for exploring the City and very convenient. Can recommend it. 
904057,17036136,2014-08-06,12061824,Phil,"If you're looking for the perfect place to stay during your trip to Seattle - stop looking. You've found the best one. Hands down. Seriously. Stop reading. Book it.

Errin's mini home is hands down the best place I have ever stayed. It's surprisingly roomy and Errin has seemingly anticipated every need her guests could have as the place is fully stocked with all the details that really do transform the space into a home away from home.

We were probably at our worst in terms of being guests since we were getting married that weekend. Since neither of us live in Seattle any longer, this wound up being home-base. Errin was patient, helpful and generally awesome. The porch outside served as a roomy place for our bridesmaids to get ready. After the wedding when we had a million gift wrappings, empty orange juice bottles - Errin's awesome partner was helping to sort it out for recycling.

We also got to work with Errin as the caterer for our wedding and holy moly - everything she touches is golden. We owe so much to her for our wedding being pulled off seamlessly.

This place is incredible. Errin and her partner (and her super cute cat) are incredible. Clever, conscientious, clean, comfortable. This place rocks. Book it."
904057,17199660,2014-08-09,5197941,Vivian,Errin's place is very cute and in a nice neighborhood. It is close to bus stops to get into downtown. We really appreciated the coffee and bagels she left for us too. And a soak in the hot tub was lovely after long days of hitting the great places Seattle has to offer. 
904057,17427473,2014-08-12,2698269,Anne,"Errin's mini-home was perfect.  The location was awesome, right next to two main roads but still on a quiet, neighborhood street.  She provided everything you could possibly need--coffee and creamer, pots and pans, even extra toiletries.  We loved having the hot tub to relax in after a long day of walking, too.  The bed mattress was heavenly and the air conditioning was very welcome on a 90+ degree day.  We would definitely stay here again during a future trip to Seattle. "
904057,17609854,2014-08-15,803340,Gerald,"We had a wonderful stay at the mini-home. Everything we needed was available and our host was welcoming and accommodating to any needs. Being by the bus was very useful as well. Great location, perfect space , really hope to stay again:)"
904057,17994747,2014-08-20,5904872,Linda,The mini home was very cute and had everything we needed. You can see and feel the host's love for details to make sure you feel welcome. We enjoyed our stay very much. Thanks again!
904057,18171287,2014-08-23,10651109,Camille,"My husband and I were in LOVE with this mini-home, I want my own in behind my house! The place is cute, bright and has anything that you'd need. The location is great, we rented a car and could park easily on the street, but could also walk to dinner, bars, coffee, etc. Errin was very responsive and there if we needed her, but she's thought of everything for the mini home.  Would be happy to stay here again and recommend the place to friends. "
904057,18516392,2014-08-28,12329892,Todd,"The mini-home was the perfect home-base for our visit to Seattle. This compact little space had everything we needed and then some! Errin was a great host and very helpful. The location was great, as it was in a quiet neighborhood not too far from downtown Ballard. "
904057,19067222,2014-09-06,14940494,Suzanne,"We loved the mini-home!  Errin made us feel very welcome and contacted us before we arrived.  Check-in was super easy and Errin greeted us and gave us some helpful information on where to find places to eat and go out, etc., which was very appreciated!  She then let us be to enjoy our vacation but was available for anything we needed.  The mini-home was just as described and met all of our needs.  We stayed for a week and the little kitchen was great and allowed us to cook breakfast everyday and keep some groceries on hand so we didn't have to eat out all the time.  Errin supplied plenty of towels for us and the bed was very comfortable!  The mini-home is in a nice neighborhood and in walking distance to downtown Ballard with plenty of restaurants and bars if you want a night out.  It is also close to the bus line to take you to downtown Seattle.  Otherwise, it was only about a quick 15 minute drive away.  Parking was always available on the street nearby.  We really enjoyed the deck and hot tub to sit and relax after some long days of walking!  This was our first time using Airbnb, and we were a little skeptical at first, but were pleasantly surprised!  I would definitely recommend this service and mini-home if you are visiting Seattle!  We had a great experience and would definitely come back!  Thank you Errin :)"
904057,19309450,2014-09-10,12646702,Lennart,"We enjoyed our stay in the mini-home so much that we stayed there twice during our honeymoon. Errin was a great host, very nice and always responsive via text message or the airbnb App.

The little apartment is exactly as described, so let me discuss some of the advantages of the location:
- a D Line bus stop and an an absolute fabulous greengrocer's ('Top Banana') are right around the corner, 
- a great Mexican food place ('El Camion') is just across the street, 
- a very good laundromat with very friendly people on NW 65th/7th Ave ('Lunar Laundry'), 
- and you'll find the best coffee in downtown Ballard on NW Market Street at 'ballard bauhaus', only a few blocks away."
904057,20275002,2014-09-27,15137443,Lukas,"Errin was a wonderful and very very hospitable host. I came a little later than expected and she was super flexible about my arrival. Her little home is a wonderful place for a stay in Seattle. It is close to the city and there are some great restaurants nearby. 

I enjoyed my stay with Errin a lot!! If I ever come back to Seattle without having a place to stay, I will most definitely choose her little home again. Thank you Errin for everything, it was a pleasure!"
904057,20560809,2014-10-01,20230137,Janina,"We really enjoyed our stay in the mini home! Everything was nice and clean and the mini home is so cosy, you feel comfortable at once!
Errin was a great host who was easy to communicate with. She helped us where possible and responded very quick to our questions.
Going downtown from the mini home is very easy and comfortable. There is a bus stop only a few metres from the mini home and the bus takes you right downtown (about 20 min.).
We would always come back and highly recommend the mini home!!"
904057,20943889,2014-10-08,14420369,Raynette,"We had an amazing at the Ballard Mini-Home! The place was exactly what we expected, with some extra amenities we didn't expect (shampoo, and such). The neighborhood was great- fresh vegetable stands, cute shops, and close to the Ballard Locks. We were 10 minutes away from down town Seattle, and it was easy to get there. Errin was a stellar hostess! Made sure we had everything we needed and then some. We would definitely rent from her again if we are in the area!! Thanks for everything!!"
904057,21073784,2014-10-11,11631381,Francesca,"This was by far my favorite airbnb experience! Errin's place is true to the photos; it's clean, stylish, and comfortable, and Errin was a wonderful host. She gave us great advice on where to go--I don't think we would have seen all of the great stuff in Ballard without talking to her. The bedding and towels were all crisp and clean, and there was coffee and hot tea for the guests. The place is fully stocked with dishes, pots, pan, etc, and it was just perfect! I Highly recommend and I'll stay at the Ballard Mini Home again if I get the chance!"
904057,21581704,2014-10-20,9036833,Rosalinda,"Errin was great and very accommodating of our arrival times. The mini-home was perfect, especially in little details that make a vacation great. Like a large refrigerator, a good wine opener, soft sheets, and a large shower. The neighborhood was a great location too-- a quick drive to pretty much anywhere in Seattle and close to Ballard, Golden Gardens, and Discovery Park. This mini-home has everything you need! "
904057,22353190,2014-11-04,14662388,John,"The host was great.  Welcomed me soon after arrival and gave me some good pointers around the area.
Room as very much as pictured and the loft not daunting at all.
Such a selection on cable was awesome.  
Nothing left wanting in either kitchen or bathroom.
Great location close to Ballard (which is awesome) and a short walk to the rapid ride bus to downtown Seattle
Seemed to be a good walking area and a couple of good eateries a stones throw away (or just a 15 min walk into Ballard for a lot of options"
904057,22745854,2014-11-13,21528603,Todd,Better than described. Great spot and Errin is really nice.
904057,22828845,2014-11-16,21113066,Tala,Errin was an amazing host. The mini home was a perfect place for our first visit to Seattle. We loved the cozy feeling and all our needs were met.

Errin was very easy to get in contact with and was willing to be as hands on as needed. The home was very clean and comfortable. The location is decent, it's right around the corner from the D Line bus which takes you straight into the city. Thank you Errin for a great stay!"
904057,25194350,2015-01-09,2854890,Charlie,The mini-house was a great place to stay and lacked nothing. Everything was precise and on point and Errin left nothing to be desired about her guest space. Would absolutely come back. Thanks Errin! We had a wonderful time.
904057,25312335,2015-01-12,23382569,Jirapon,"Errin's mini-home is beyond my expectation. It looks just like it shows in the picture (or much better). Everything is nice and clean. I came around 8 pm and Errin was very flexible about the check in time. We didn't have a chance to meet her though but we communicated smoothly via text. The mini-home has complete privacy if you ever concerned about it. There is a small kitchen with pot and pan where you can cook easy meal. Dishes and silverware are plenty. Complimentary k-cup coffee. I couldn't ask for more!! In the bathroom, she provided several cleaned towels, shampoo/conditioner and soap. It's just like you staying in a good hotel. 
Tips:
Ballard downtown is about 15 min easy walk. There are many good restaurants located in the downtown.  "
904057,25491713,2015-01-18,1119429,Charlotte,We had a great stay in Seattle in this mini-home.  The location is great for exploring Ballard with lots of places to eat within walking distance (we had a delicious meal at Delancey).  The mini-home is exactly as pictured.  The bed is very comfortable and we appreciated the keurig coffee maker to help us get going in the morning.   My only regret is that we didn't make time for the hot tub...next time!  Thanks for having us Errin!
904057,25739311,2015-01-25,23614288,Madison,"We had such a lovely stay at the mini home. Errin was more than accommodating. The location is perfect, the space is lovely and efficiently laid out, and check in/out couldn't have been easier. We can't wait to come back. "

Thank you for a great experience during our first trip to Seattle! 
904057,26351079,2015-02-10,22563364,Alison,"My husband and I loved our stay at Errin's mini-home. The place was very clean and cozy. Errin made us feel taken care of from day one and was also very considerate of our space. The amenities were quality and useful accessories.  Having a mini kitchen provided for lots of home-made breakfasts. :)

This location, nestled in Ballard, was great as well since you could walk to most of the local restaurants and stores. It was conveniently close to downtown Seattle too. It made day trips downtown just as easy as outings to visit other parts of the area. We will definitely recommend to friends and family."
904057,26584925,2015-02-16,8575881,Sarah,"My friends and I had a wonderful time staying in the mini home! It is perfect for close friends or a couple. The ""mini"" is no lie, but it is utterly charming! The house is well stocked with towels, linens, and has abasic kitchen--perfect for breakfast before a busy day of sightseeing. Errin was very responsive, and a wonderful host. I would absolutely stay there again the next time I'm in Seattle. "

Thank you Errin."
904057,27107772,2015-02-25,4888133,Trisha,Errin's Mini-home was an amazing place to stay at on my first trip to Seattle. It is exactly as pictured and the lighting is bright and inviting. Errin left the key and the door open for us and checked in often to make sure we were comfortable. We wish we could've used the hot tub during our stay... We loved her place and would definitely come back again! 
904057,27212043,2015-02-28,24042857,Elizabeth," This Seattle mini house is a wonderful spot for couples. It is fully appointed and in a great location. It is clear that Errin has taken care to accommodate any need that a traveler to Seattle might have. 

The hot tub is also a perfect relaxation feature after a long, active northwest day. "
904057,27457239,2015-03-05,6871026,Rachel,Staying at Errins was fantastic. :) The place was perfect for seeing seattle. She was communicative which made checking in and out really easy. If your looking for a home away from home in Seattle this is where I would recommend to stay. Thanks Errin for your wonderful hospitality.
904057,28198814,2015-03-20,12437789,Holly,"A great two week stay here in Ballard, Seattle which is a really cool neighborhood especially down Ballard Avenue (20 min walk). Errin greeted us on arrival, gave us some good tips and helped us get our initial bearings (there was also some bagels left for us, which was a nice touch). The tiny home is small as you'd expect but perfect for a short stay, plus there's a hot tub too! 

It's a little way into Seattle city center, although there is a D Line bus around the corner which takes 30mins to get in. There is also a Enterprise car rental just 8 blocks away if you want to take a road trip too. 

Overall there are lots of nice restaurants, cafes and groceries around here and it is a great base for your Seattle adventure. Would definitely recommend a stay here."
904057,28386653,2015-03-23,12029834,Rachel,"Our stay in the mini-home was great. The location let us walk to many things in Ballard. 

Although we never saw our hosts they had excellent communication with us that made us feel very welcome. 

The hot tub was a huge bonus!

904057,28643189,2015-03-28,24307310,Shuman,Errin's house is quite cozy. It is clean and almost includes everything we need. It takes about 35 mins to downtown by bus. Will comeback if  I visit Seattle again!
904057,28924835,2015-04-01,11308417,Alexandra,"What a great mini home. Super neighborhood, well equipped, fantastic deck and hot tub; it was the perfect Spring Break spot. "
904057,30065185,2015-04-17,4422450,Tim,"Perfect spot for a short stay in Seattle, great neighbourhood, easy to get around the city. Fantastic little home, everything you could need."
904057,30378095,2015-04-21,3738379,Sean,What a cool house and really great alternative to a hotel! Check-in/out procedure was very convenient and the tiny home had everything I needed. I will definitely try to book here again next time I return to Seattle. Thanks Errin!
904057,31423939,2015-05-05,26036547,Scott,"The mini home was all that we expected and more. It was in a great location with easy access to the city and surrounds. Errin met us upon arrival and gave us a rundown of the local area, she was a great host!
We really enjoyed our stay and we would definitely use the mini home again. 

-Scott & Adelaide"
904057,31631195,2015-05-08,27385468,Cori,"The mini-home was perfect for us during our stay in Seattle. Errin was a great host, meeting us as we arrived and offered any assistance with navigating around or recommendations of places to eat. The mini-home was very clean and cozy and was stocked with everything we could need.  The neighborhood was great with lots of places to eat and shop within walking distance. Would recommend for anyone staying in Seattle!"
904057,31872304,2015-05-11,26363725,Katie,"This accommodation out far exceeded our expectations.  It was quant and absolutely perfect for a couple and a romantic weekend getaway!  Erinn was extremely accommodating and the neighborhood was located perfectly outside of the downtown hustle and bustle.  Equipped with a mini kitchen, we were able to get our own fish from Pikes Place Market and have a fantastic dinner in our home away from home.  Staying at the mini home provided so many comforts and an absolutely wonderful & memorable experience.  I recommend this stay to any couple looking for an intimate getaway."
904057,32104233,2015-05-14,21049494,Erin,"We were flying into Seattle very late and our host was very flexible about what time we arrived.  She had the key in the house and we were free to let ourselves in.  We never met Errin in person, but she was on the property the entire time and made it known that we could get in touch with her if we wished.  The house looks almost exactly as pictured.  The kitchen was well stocked, there was complimentary K-cups and everything fit our needs quite well.  Errin also provided shampoo, conditioner, body soap, etc.  She also had a ton of brochures on things to do in the area. The bed was so comfortable!  My fiance and I are average size people; I can't imagine a larger person being comfortable in the loft area.  The only aspect that I was disappointed with was the cleanliness of the house.  The house was very tidy but details like cobwebs and fresh towels under the dishes were overlooked.  Off street parking was also tricky at times.  As far as Ballard, we both preferred Ballard over Seattle.  My fiance and I are more outdoorsy people and the city life isn't for us.  Ballard had some excellent restaurants and was close enough to the airport.  "
904057,32314887,2015-05-17,3136917,Ruth,"Errin was a very nice and helpful host and responded very fast when we had questions.
The mini-home was well equipped and offered everything we needed for our stay."
904057,32739511,2015-05-21,25719968,Matthew,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed our time in Errin's mini-home. It makes great use of the available space and is very functional and well arranged. Errin left plenty of coffee and tea for us to drink, and there are plenty of markets within walking distance for anything else we needed. The location of the min-home is perfect, and there are many shops, and restaurants within walking distance. Anything outside of Ballard is only a short drive away as well. We had no problem finding parking while staying here. The deck was a great place to relax and read a book, and the hot tub provided the perfect way to end a busy day of shopping and sight seeing. 

Errin was the perfect host. We met her on the first day, but otherwise was unobtrusive to our stay unless we needed something.  We will definitely stay here again if we return to the area!"
904057,33350045,2015-05-27,3510620,Caroline,"We had a great time in Errin's mini-home. It is a thoughtfully-arranged, comfortable space with everything you need! We loved the natural light and the pleasant evening breezes, as well as the spacious and well-equipped deck (with a great hot tub)! Errin is a considerate, friendly, and responsive hostess while also giving ample space and privacy. Don't miss this gem in Ballard!"
904057,34049332,2015-06-04,26496685,Nancy,I would like to thank Errin  for completely making us feel at home. We had to call her for directions from the airport and she was kind enough to stay on the phone with us while guiding us in! We were very GPS challenged at that moment. This was our first AIRBNB experience and I can only hope that other sites are as nice and thoughtful for the guest as this one is. Sincerely Jerry and Nancy Odell
904057,34271475,2015-06-07,17361724,Kim,"This definitely lives up to the glowing reviews! I highly recommend Errin's mini-home to anyone staying in Seattle. It has a wonderful, homey vibe and great amenities, including a hot tub, comfy bed and functional kitchen. Errin left lots of thoughtful touches, including guidebooks, toiletries and even an umbrella for us. We also enjoyed being so close to several fantastic restaurants (especially Bastille and The Fat Hen) and to public transit. In fact, you can easily get in and around Seattle just using a mixture of transit, walking and Uber. If we come back to Seattle, we absolutely want to stay here again!"
904057,35365624,2015-06-18,27222923,Evan,"This little Ballard pad is super cool. The location is great. The mini house had that comfortable little cottage feel. The loft was fun.
Errin gives you complete privacy. The hot tub is right outside the mini house door, all yours whenever you want it. Great Place."
904057,35764978,2015-06-22,2116386,Rodrigo,"Errin's Mini-House is perfect, everything you need in a vacation to Seattle, confortable bed, practical kitchen, great location, close to restaurant and tourist sites. 

If we ever return to the city, we not hesitate to stay in Errin`s apartment again."
904057,36170938,2015-06-26,1571831,Lindsey,"We had a wonderful stay at Errin's beautiful mini-home!! It is exactly as she says, and perfect for two people (although some of my taller friends would struggle in the loft space!). Errin provides her guests with all of the important necessities- coffee, tea, towels, linens, etc. We loved spending our days exploring Ballard and downtown Seattle, and then relaxing for the evening in the hot tub! It is conveniently located near many outstanding restaurants as well as the rapid bus to downtown. I highly recommend staying here! Thank you for a lovely stay! "
904057,36648338,2015-06-30,22425822,Felix,"Our stay at Errins Mini home was really really good. Located in Ballard it takes you about 15 minutes to go to seattle downtown by bus (we recommend the rapid ride. The bus stop is about two minutes away). Ballard itself offers you many possibilities, so as good Pubs and a Lot of good food.  

The Mini home was clean and cozy. Theres a small kitchen with all the things you need to Cook. The bedroom is.located under the roof. 

Erin was a nice host and she helped us whenever we needed something. Def a great air bnb host"
904057,37440580,2015-07-07,25647627,Anne,Our stay at Errins little home was wonderful! It is exactly as described and very comfortable! Thank you Errin for a great stay! 
904057,38092226,2015-07-13,11133586,Amy,"Errin's Mini Home was adorable. My fiance and I stayed for three nights on our visit to the city, and this space was perfect! We fell in love with the area (Ballard), and Errin was very hospitable and helpful in providing information and suggestions for us, as it was our first time visiting Seattle. 
She also is very accomodating, and provided all we could have needed during our stay. She keeps the mini home well-stocked with essentials, and the space is clean and cozy. I definitely reccomend this listing if you're going to Seattle!"
904057,38976838,2015-07-20,25896715,Vanessa,"
Errin was the quintessential host and her mini-house was the perfect home away from home. Errin communicated all necessary information in a timely fashion prior to our arrival. She greeted us shortly after we arrived and provided us with an overview of the mini-house. Errin was a kind, knowledgable, and courteous host. 

The mini-house is just that: a tiny structure with all the amenities a traditional house has to offer. We cooked breakfast every morning and ate outside on the deck. In the evening we took advantage of the jacuzzi tub after spending many hours hiking. The mini-house is located in the perfect location. It's easy to jump on the highway to head to Mt. Rainer or leave your car behind and take the D line downtown. If you are an exercise junkie, there's a CrossFit next door, Ballard High School (with a track) 1 1/2 blocks away, and a Bikram yoga studio only a short drive away. We will definitely stay here the next time we visit Seattle. 

Thanks for your hospitality, Errin!!!"
904057,39724642,2015-07-26,16568116,Cintha,I enjoyed a great stay at the mini home. Everything I could wish for (and more). It allowed me to be self sufficient but with Errin only a text message away. A perfect stay (with just a minor hiccup with the hot tub). The area felt safe to walk around at night and I would even just walk down to NW Market street for some last minute groceries at the Safeway or Wallgreens.
904057,42244466,2015-08-12,25325346,Pamela,"Errin was available by email and text before and during our stay and accommodated our late arrival by having the lights and a/c on and they key waiting for us.  We had several friendly conversations while we were there, and she made a point of getting us fresh linens promptly.
The description of the Tiny House was very accurate, if anything the pictures don't do it justice.  The deck is spacious, the hot tub was hot, the drawers in the kitchen and bathroom were filled with helpful items, and the ambiance was just lovely.  My husband was a teeny bit claustrophobic in the loft, but I could stand straight up in the middle and found it plenty roomy.  The wi-fi worked instantly, it was well-ventilated, and it felt private and safe.
The neighborhood was friendly and peaceful, with beautiful gardens, and located close enough to parks and destinations for plenty of jogging choices.  Parking was a bit of a struggle, but we were never more than a couple of blocks from the house, and hey, it's Seattle.
We definitely hope to go back.  "
904057,42813477,2015-08-16,25553728,Ashley,"Erinn was great about making sure we had all the information we needed to get to the house and to enjoy our stay. The house itself was beautiful, had all the space we needed and the deck outside was a great touch for being able to enjoy the nice weather Seattle had for us. The hot tub was a great bonus, it helped to perk up a rainy day. The house was walking distance from several stores, and a very easy and convenient drive from downtown Seattle and all its sights. I absolutely will recommend this to everyone I know looking for a place to stay in Seattle. "
904057,44879872,2015-08-30,4988928,Liza,"Errin's mini-home was the perfect little oasis after long days of hiking and exploring Seattle. My husband and I went for our honeymoon, and it was the perfect amount of space for us. Errin was very accommodating; she texted to check that we had everything we needed and provided us with new towels, etc. halfway through the week. The house was really close to many delicious restaurants as well as a bus stop to downtown around the corner. We really enjoyed staying here and cannot wait to come back! I would highly recommend this rental to anyone looking for a cozy, conveniently located rental in Seattle."
904057,46866515,2015-09-14,2701905,Gavin,"Perfect mini house for a stay in Ballard/Seattle area. The space is cool with very comfy bed and everything else you need with fully stocked kitchen and bathroom essentials all provided. Everything was spotlessly clean. Errin has great communication before and during the stay with good, clear instructions. Downtown Seattle around 20/30 mins on D Line rapid bus. Run all day frequently so no problem at all. Definitely recommend for staying in Seattle area. "
904057,47238961,2015-09-17,234387,Lesley,"Errin was very communicative and friendly throughout. We absolutely LOVED the place! It's really tiny and cute but exceptionally clean and has everything you need, including toiletries and an excellent coffee machine! Bed was really comfy and the neighbourhood was great, lots of great bars and restaurants. Oh, and the hot tub was amazing!"
904057,47615327,2015-09-21,12619599,Brandon & Audrey,Everything was great!  Would absolutely stay again.  The space was perfect for my wife and me.  Thanks!
904057,48181369,2015-09-24,36373908,Nina,"Errin is very caring, and easy to communicate with. She even had a pack-and-play available for our little one. The place itself is lovely - cozy little house in her backyard with large deck and jaccuzi. Well cared for home, clean - plus I loved the smell of the linen. We really felt at home. Great neighborhoud with a lot of nice placey to eat and easy access to downtown Seattle. "
904057,48494813,2015-09-27,30365353,Manuela,"Unser Aufenthalt bei Errin war der perfekte Start in eine lange Reise. Das Appartement liegt ruhig ab von einer Strasse und bietet alles, was man braucht. Sogar Toilettenartikel im Bad und Küchensachen wie Kaffe, Tee und Konfitüre liegen berein. Errin ist sehr herzlich und unkompliziert. Gerne kommen wir wieder!"
904057,50265410,2015-10-11,18104310,Amanda,"Our stay was wonderful! The mini-home was the perfect base camp for all our Seattle adventures. The kitchen was a great bonus as it enabled us to cook meals. A good supply of coffee was always available and the hot tub was the perfect end of the day unwind. Errin checked in with us several times to make sure we had everything we needed and we felt free to come and go as we pleased. The neighborhood the house is in, Ballard, had so many great food and entertainment options. (try the Golden Beetle, Monday is gourmet mac'n'cheese night!) We'll definitely stay here again if we're ever in Seattle. Thanks for everything, Errin!!"
904057,51378496,2015-10-19,28467651,Jena,"Our stay in the mini-home was wonderful! Errin helped me pull of the perfect surprise trip for my husband's 30th birthday. Ballard is amazing in general and the location of the mini-home is very convenient. We spent a whole day enjoying Ballard, and we would absolutely recommend doing the same! Some of our favorite places in the area were: Morsel (coffee/breakfast), Kiss Cafe (lunch), Ballard Coffee Works (mid-afternoon), Veraci Pizza (dinner), Stoup (brewery), and NW Peaks (brewery). It is also easy to get downtown by taking the bus or an Uber. We would also highly recommend taking a $12 tour of CenturyLink Field - so worth it! All in all, the mini-home had absolutely everything we needed for the two of us and Errin was always just a text message away! "
904057,54570562,2015-11-22,14845313,Deborah,"Thank you, Errin, for a lovely stay. The tiny house was perfect for one person for a month. It was very private and quiet, yet only one block from a major bus route and at least 5 good places to eat within several blocks. Only 8 blocks from the heart of Ballard. Errin was a great host and provided everything I needed. The weather was pretty cold occasionally, but the heaters kept the house nice and toasty. I'd love to stay here again if I have the opportunity."
904057,55290436,2015-11-29,37255410,Kory,It was really nice. Much better than a similarly priced hotel. The bed was comfy. Great area too. Ballard is a really cool part of Seattle.
904057,56213915,2015-12-10,46035883,Heather,Errin was very welcoming and personable!  Her mini home has all your needs met and then some!  I enjoyed having more than a bedroom..the little seating area and TV made me feel like I was home...the kitchenette was stocked with everything you might need for a short or long stay.  I would highly recommend!
904057,56836990,2015-12-19,22557437,Rogier,"Erin's mini house was absolute perfect! A nice place to get back to after busy days of meetings and traveling. Everything was there and the house is very clean. Erin replied promptly whenever I had a question. She is very hands off, but there if you need her. If I have to be back in the Seattle area I would definitely visit Erin again if possible."
6808970,46190087,2015-09-08,41818107,Mary,"My parents and I loved our weekend stay at Marianne's. She's a very thoughtful host, paying attention to the small details, like a personalized welcome note, a satchel of lavender with our clean linens and delicious local coffee. Though small, the space is cozy and the three of us never felt cramped. Bathroom and kitchen were very clean. The bed and couch were both comfortable. The location was convenient for exploring the downtown area - an easy 20 minute walk - though the trek back home could be tiresome with a very steep hill. We weren't too bothered by that, though. We also enjoyed the proximity of the Capitol Hill area, which had lots of shops, restaurants and beautiful neighborhoods. We would definitely stay at Marianne's the next time our travels take us to Seattle."

Rachael also provided many good restaurant recommendations and was a very gracious host.  I would definitely stay here again."
5900224,34071369,2015-06-04,31809129,Julia,"Rachael's apartment was absolutely perfect. Belltown is a great location. Her apartment is walking distance to some really nice cafes and restaurants-- especially Shiro's, which was the best sushi we've ever had. Rachael was very accommodating, allowing us to check in earlier so that we didn't have to walk around with our suitcases. Her apartment was immaculately clean and was ideal for two people. We would definitely stay here again. She is a great host and always replies promptly if you have any questions. Thanks Rachael :)"
5900224,34309486,2015-06-07,18016425,Mary,"Rachael was very easy to reach to communicate with before and during the stay. She was accommodating and patient with my questions and check in time. She gave us a list of activities we should try to do, attractions we should visit, and her favorite restaurants. "
5900224,35843301,2015-06-22,5777997,Alexis,"It was a pleasure staying in Rachael's apartment. She was a fantastic host ... responsive, flexible with our check-out time, and provided us with tips for her favorite neighborhood restaurants. And her apartment was exactly as listed ... Very clean, cozy, and conveniently located. Would definitely recommend her place when visiting Seattle! "
5900224,37340845,2015-07-06,21893129,Tulsi,"Rachael's place is perfect! My husband and I LOVED the place itself. Super clean, beautiful decor, and a perfect view of the Space Needle. The building itself is also gorgeous. It has a courtyard on the third floor which is perfect to relax in. The building also has some amazing restaurants attached to it. The place is ideally located within walking distance to all the attractions, which was perfect. Rachael was the perfect host. Our flight was delayed, and she was completely understanding. She left detailed instructions for us, including restaurant/bar recommendations, etc. By far, the best Airbnb experience that we have had! "
5900224,39922596,2015-07-27,3650416,Justin,"Our experience in Seattle was amazing, and we couldn't have stayed in a more convenient location. The condo was really nice and had all of the amenities we could have hoped for. "

5900224,49281802,2015-10-02,43776772,Ryan,"Rachael's place in Seattle is the absolute best way to see the city! Walking distance from Olympic Sculpture Park, the Space Needle, Pikes Place Market, and of course all the great places in Belltown. The space itself is practical, with fantastic views of the water and the Needle. Rachael made sure the front desk was able to buzz me in, and her instructions were clear and included some great recommendations of local places to eat and drink. I would 100% stay again if I ever travel back to Seattle, just a great space in a prime location. "
5900224,49550252,2015-10-04,28682012,Matt,"What a fantastic place and location! My wife and I were looking to stay in a cool part of the city that was within walking distance to everything. This location lives up to it's name as you can walk tot he best spots in Seattle and it has fantastic views.

Rachel was also a great host. Her place is very clean and she recommend some of her favorite place to visit and eat. Two of the restaurants, Shiro's and Macrina's Bakery, are attached to her building and are both fantastic. I highly recommend staying at this location!"
5900224,50458468,2015-10-12,7068200,Daye,"Rachael's apartment is perfectly situated within walking distance to everything you would want to have ease of access to in Seattle. Her place was immaculately clean and so well-decorated, with beautiful little details that made the home feel so lively and full of character. Her ""best of Seattle"" sheet is spot on. Shiro's Sushi downstairs will blow your mind. We had an amazing stay and we would stay here again."
5900224,55239321,2015-11-29,27043862,Kristie,"Rachael was a great host.  She took the time to provide detailed instructions on accessing the building, was attentive and took the time to leave a detailed list of places and things to do.  Her place was clean and in a great location as advertised.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay."
5805162,31207239,2015-05-03,19014176,Mathew,"Riley was waiting for us when we arrived and introduced us to the space. Riley was always responsive to our questions whenever we needed something. This basement apartment was spacious with a fully equipped kitchen. This would be a perfect spot for parents visiting their university kids or maybe a writer/programmer who wants to get away or, like us, just a safe clean spot to venture off from and explore.
The neighborhood was within walking distance of many of the  places we were interested in and there was always a Car2Go nearby for more out of the way places. "
5805162,31987459,2015-05-12,30078023,Xiaoling,"The place is lovely! The apartment is spacious and well-equipped. The location is super convenient, a large shopping mall and lots of restaurants nearby and about 20 minutes' drive to downtown Seattle. Amy is really accommodating, helpful, and flexible with our check-in & out time. I highly recommended this place to those who go to Seattle."
5805162,32583183,2015-05-19,25962241,Andrew,Amy's place was fantastic! She was super attentive and a wonderful host. The space was well taken care of and truly a joy. Would definitely recommend staying here!
5805162,32988058,2015-05-24,6626691,Mir,"Amy was an excellent host.  She was always available during my stay for questions and concerns.  The apartment itself is very spacious and comfortable.   I found it to be exactly as described.  Although it is a basement apartment, it has a fair amount of sunlight, and does not feel cold.  The neighborhood was great, and we never had any trouble finding street parking.  The private entrance is very easy to access.  This was important for us, as we often came home late at night with our two young kids.  I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again on my next visit to Seattle. "
5805162,33142131,2015-05-25,15372918,Priyanka,"Its a great place, just like the pictures ! We loved the tea that was left there- was super refreshing after a long drive. Amy showed us the place and was very responsive every time we had questions. She also told us about a coffee shop a block or so away if you want to experience the 'Seattle coffee experience'. Would totally recommend to anyone going to Seattle !
"
5805162,33519030,2015-05-29,31733492,Grace,Amy is a very great host and their house is so clean and neat!! She is very sweet and even prepared some Chinese tea for us. It's exactly like the description and even looks better than the pictures. I love their house so much and I wish I could have a little house like this! 
5805162,34067629,2015-06-04,31791757,Doug,"The hosts were great, regular communication even before arrival. We asked for advice on places to visit and gave timely and useful feedback.  Apartment was as described.  In fact, felt roomier than what you see in the pictures.  

Location was in great neighborhood, near campus. A block from some nice commercial areas for eating.  Parking was simple and they provide a street pass.  Easy access to downtown.

We knocked on their doors multiple times and they always were ready to answer our questions and be accessible.  

Place was clean, almost new.  Big screen tv. Options for Netflix and a few others but no cable (at least we didn't figure that out).  but I guess if you're in Seattle you don't want to be wasting your time watching tv...beautiful yard.  Easy access to walking and biking trails.  Only one bathroom, and you have to walk into master bedroom to use it, so some privacy issues, but not a big deal.  

Overall, great experience. My first airbnb and it was a great one.  "
5805162,34786053,2015-06-12,2422378,Lily,This era a very nice apartment. Amy was very interested in making our stay enjoyable.

The neighbourhood is great - only a short walk to the bike rental station and from there it's an easy ride into the city. Felt very safe to wonder around at night and parking on the street during the day was fine.

A great stay in Seattle and one we would definitely come back to."
5805162,35932465,2015-06-23,32754305,Jennifer,"Thoroughly enjoyed every moment of my stay at Amy's.  Even though Amy was not there upon my arrival, Riley was able to walk me through the entire apartment and let me know of a few tips and to offer any insight and help that was needed.  The apartment is EXACTLY how it looks within the images provided and though it was a warm week, the apartment stayed nice and cool.  The location of the apartment is great as it was close to the University of Washington and had a great coffee shop (Zoka) just two blocks away.  Also, there was a delicious pasta/pizza place right down the street that was delicious (Mamma Melina) that had a great lunch special with beautiful atmosphere and decor.  I enjoyed the amenities of the apartment especially the wash/dryer and kitchen; I was able to have friends over for my last night in Seattle after visiting Pike Place for fresh seafood.  I will definitely recommend it to my friends, and I fully intend on staying at the apartment the next time I am in Seattle!  I miss it already and I miss the new friends I found in Amy and Riley.  "
5805162,36389819,2015-06-28,32308347,Maureen,This was my first Airbnb experience and I loved it. Everything about Amy’s place was perfect for my taste and my needs right down to having a French Press available for coffee making.  I had daily (rehab) walks in the neighbourhood and enjoyed looking at all the lovely homes and gardens. Everyone I met said “morning” to me. It felt like I was right “at home”. I would definitely stay at Amy’s place again the next time I visit my friends in Seattle.
5805162,36728518,2015-06-30,36282330,Ann,Amy and Riley were great and very accommodating!! The apartment was very comfortable and very well appointed. I felt like I was staying at a high end hotel. The neighborhood was very safe and the apartment was close to many restaurants as well as great places to walk and ride bikes.
5805162,37147933,2015-07-05,29006064,Claire,"Our host Amy was great, she greeted us when we arrived and was totally flexible with our arrival time which was later than we had hoped.  The apartment was exactly as described, it was clean, fresh and extremely well equipped, there was plenty of towels and bedding and we even had use of the laundry facilities which was really helpful.
We most certainly wouldn't hesitate going back and staying with Amy and her family if ever we are back in Seattle!!"
5805162,41321972,2015-08-07,14176263,Monica,Amy was a wonderful host!  The unit is in a terrific location with a private entrance and is within walking distance to great shops and restaurants. The kitchen was great and we loved having a washer and dryer. We would highly recommend this space to anyone looking for a great spot in Seattle. 
5805162,42520207,2015-08-14,32539409,Sean,"We had a great time during our stay here!  The apartment is spacious and cozy at the same time.  It was very clean.  Our host, Amy, provided everything we needed from the parking pass to maps and magazines about Seattle.  We would definitely stay here again.  Thank you to Amy for a wonderful experience with Airbnb!"
5805162,43243387,2015-08-18,14010785,Kate,My husband and my sister visited for an extended weekend and couldn't have had a better experience. The apartment was exactly as described with more than enough room for the three of us.  The location was convenient to get just about anywhere in the city. We only met Amy once - she was extremely friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend this place! 
5805162,43766501,2015-08-22,28591863,Molly,"We had a great stay at Amy and Riley's apartment.  We are a family of four, and it was plenty of space for us. (our two kids shared a bed.)  We had a minor problem with some tiny ants in the apartment (mainly in the kitchen), but Amy dealt with the issue quickly and professionally.  The location of the apartment was fantastic; close to U Village Marketplace and Ravenna Park.  The apartment is exactly as pictured - very clean and neat.  The neighborhood and home are quiet, making it a great retreat in the city.  Thank you, Amy and Riley!"
5805162,45066242,2015-08-31,3251339,Betty,"There are so many things I could list about this place that I love. I will try my best to keep it short. 

First off, Amy was a wonderful host. Although I didn't meet her personally, I was in contact with her before and throughout my trip to Seattle. She was super welcoming and was able to accommodate my needs. In fact, she even made sure I didn't forget anything by texting me after cleaning the place up.

About the place: it was cozy, it was cute and it was awesome. I came as a group of 4 and all of us loved it. We had someone who was 6'4"" and was able to fit on the couch perfectly. He was quite surprised and please. 

The place was clean, well kept and had so much space to walk around that it felt so roomy. There was a place for all four of us to be without bothering each other. This was great after walking 8 hours in a convention. The living room had enough space to host a get-together of 7 people to play a board game on the (website hidden) provided great entertainment for us. We used our Netflix account and was able to enjoy a show all four of us liked. It was great to have that option. The couch is super comfy and could fit the four of us with a bit of room to spare. 

All the furniture was super comfortable. This made our experience amazing as we were all so tired from walking all day.

We will DEFINITELY come back here again. Definitely yes. "
5805162,45389496,2015-09-02,39052525,Susan,"We were very comfortable in this cute, quiet condo. Amy lives upstairs and was there when we arrived to show us around and give us a parking permit that allowed us to park on the street in front of the house at any time. She was helpful in pointing out a nearby grocery store. We ate at two of the restaurants that were suggested and they were both excellent. The heated floor in the bathroom was a treat and the washer and dryer were very convenient."
5805162,46529473,2015-09-11,22077189,Dario,The apartment is just great. We loved to stay there and we felt home immediately. It is very spacious and has therefore plenty of room. We also found the shampoos and the cremes in the shower a very nice extra. The tipps and tricks for Seattle upon arrival written on a paper were very helpful. We fully recommend the place of Amy and we can assure every future guest of Amy to be fully happy there.
5805162,47038751,2015-09-15,36202507,Don,"We stayed here 4 nights.  Advantages: a 2 bedroom apartment for the price of a hotel room, private entrance, spacious, recently renovated, comfy beds, bathroom has heated floor, hot shower, Netflix on the big screen TV, fully equipped kitchen, washer and dryer, free parking, free Wi-Fi, windows can open, close to University of Washington and several restaurants at University Village.  Wife loved the gadget by the bed which played nature sounds.  Disadvantages: 4 pm check-in, not as soundproof as some hotels, no live TV so I had to go to a sports bar to watch football (which may not be a disadvantage).  Overall we recommend it."
5805162,47395134,2015-09-18,42775462,Ryna,"Amy was such a great host. Not only were the accommodations beautiful, clean and quiet, but Amy was also extremely nice and approachable during every interaction we had. Unfortunately, we did not have the opportunity to meet her in person, but I am so glad we had this place to come home to for two nights in seattle! "
5805162,47665753,2015-09-21,38793681,Grace,"Everything about this place was perfect! The location was phenomenal, the house was beautiful and Amy and Riley were so accommodating! "
5805162,48410556,2015-09-26,12135170,Cynthia,"Although we were unable to meet Amy during our stay because she was out of town, she was quick to respond to any concerns we had before our stay or problems we experienced during. The place itself was pretty clean and very spacious

My pros: 
Loved the heated bathroom floors!! 
Comfy couches were great for lounging and watching Netflix. 
Plenty of parking. 
Cute neighborhood, walkable to uVillage and some nice local establishments. 

My cons: 
The house is definitely a little older and you can hear all the creaks and moans of its old bones. It took myself some time getting used to it but it's probably because I'm a light sleeper. Also, the bed is on an old metal frame so it was pretty squeaky everytime you move. 
It didn't end up being too much of a problem, but the basement windows did not have curtains, so it didn't feel as private as I would have liked. 

All in all,  it was a nice space for a good price in a quiet neighborhood. Just be mindful that being in a basement type of living space, you will hear footsteps above in the main house."
5805162,49604097,2015-10-05,31409615,Judy,"This apartment was a joy to stay in. It was lovely and thoughtfully organized. Amy communicated with us well. We loved our stay, the location and the attractiveness of the physical space.  We can't wait to stay here again!!"
5805162,50003127,2015-10-08,35012917,Fritz,"Die Ankunft war unkompliziert. Die Lage ist ruhig und die Parkplatzsuche kein Problem. 
Die Wohnung ist sehr schön eingerichtet, es hat viel Platz, alles Notwendige ist da. Die Bilder in der Beschreibung zeigen die Wohnung, so wie sie ist. Es ist eine sehr ausführliche und hilfreiche Beschreibung von der Wohnung und zu Restaurants, Aktivitäten, Geschäften, ... vorhanden. 
Amy war sehr nett, unkompliziert und hilfsbereit. 
Alles hat bestens funktioniert. Wir würden jederzeit gerne wieder kommen.


"
5805162,50467663,2015-10-12,527947,Marie,"Amy's place was perfect for my brief stay in Seattle. It was as lovely as it looked in the photos. It was so spacious, comfortable, and clean. The kitchen appliances were new and modern, as was the bathroom. I love the heated floor and the strong water pressure. It was easy to see that Amy pays attention to the smallest details and thinks of everything to make her guests' stay as convenient as possible. The toiletries were high-quality products, and there was more than ample supply of towels and linens. The location was ideal, as it was in a quiet neighborhood, close to the University of Washington and to shops and restaurants."
5805162,51115346,2015-10-18,7684164,Kimberly,We had a great experience here! Checkin/out was easy. The place was clean and very comfortable. We had everything we needed.

Her service was impeccable, we received all the info we needed right away as well as towels and keys, we didn't need to ask one single question! I'd definitely stay again, her place was very relaxing after days of hiking in the Olympic national park"
3986793,18928094,2014-09-02,5959293,Willow,"It was quiet and very comfortable, she provided coffee and tea (which I didn't use), towels (which I did use), let me know any rules right away. Plus, she's on the edge of a beautiful park that leads to a small beach. "
3986793,19584279,2014-09-14,8168296,Annick,"Fang is the sweetest !  Everything about my stay was perfect: quiet and clean and bright. Just what I needed.
Thanks Fang !"
3986793,19853315,2014-09-19,21082261,Candace,Hostess was there to greet me the evening I arrived. Room was clean and I had the place to myself.
3986793,19910874,2014-09-20,21357192,Trevor,"Fang was a wonderful and gracious host who saw to it that we were nothing but comfortable and attended to.  The house is located in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood that provides a real sense of peace and privacy while still having all the amenities one could want close at hand.  Should I need a place to stay in that part of town again, I would not hesitate to see if her lovely home was available.  Thank you!"
3986793,19993844,2014-09-21,10969360,Malte,"Fang gave me a warm welcome and told me some great places to visit in Seattle. The room was as expected, everything was tidy and clean."

3986793,22574462,2014-11-09,8136722,Naomi,"This spot was perfect! The entire experience was seamless. Basically, we found out we had a chance to spend and extra night in Seattle, we contacted Fang, and the rest was easy. The place was EXACTLY as pictured/described, it is super quiet, the garden as gorgeous and you can check it out from the shower. The house and room is super clean, and a par drive to downtown Ballard. We would definitely stay here again!"
3986793,32026983,2015-05-12,11609228,Christina,"I had a great experience staying at Fangs home. She was there to greet me the moment I arrived and gave me a nice walk through of her home. She was extremely welcoming and made me feel very comfortable. The description of her beautiful home was extremely accurate! It was located in a safe and quiet neighborhood, only a 20 - 25 minute drive from downtown Seattle. I would definitely stay there again!"
3986793,32405823,2015-05-17,3641741,Jenn,Excellent host.  Great space very helpful for check in!  Thanks.
3986793,32946431,2015-05-23,32946360,Adrian,"My wife and I had a fantastic experience at Fang's home, she was very kind and helpful throughout our stay there. The location is fantastic and beautiful carkeek park is 5 min away. Her home is beautiful and spacious, she even left a lovely welcoming basket on our bed. We will definitely be booking with Fang again."
3986793,33013221,2015-05-24,29445808,Brenna,"I enjoyed staying at Fang's home. It was clean and comfortable. Our room was just what we needed for the night, including some chocolate! Her boyfriend stayed the night. She let us know after we had settled in, but we didn't even see him, so he didn't bother us at all. It was a nice neighborhood. "
3986793,34988540,2015-06-14,21573712,Tim,A very accommodating experience. Super-clean and quiet with easy parking.

3986793,37107372,2015-07-04,36877446,Antonio,"Warm, welcoming and friendly a guest could not expect a nicer host than Miss Fang. Her happy and smiling face brightened each day and her helpful suggestions made getting around Seattle easy and fun. I really enjoyed my stay and look forward to experiencing her charming hospitality again. I will surely recommend her to my friends and relatives traveling to Seattle. One more thing, a beautiful, quiet and peaceful garden just outside the back door gave me the feeling of being on a meditation retreat. It made me want to linger and relax in the inviting atmosphere."
3986793,37390582,2015-07-06,34445883,Eun-Jung,Fang is very kindly host. She's lovely house is very queit & comfortable. 
3986793,37669093,2015-07-09,34797354,Carlos,My girlfriend and I had a wonderful time staying at fang's. Her home is very clean and the backyard is a beautiful place to just sit and chat. Defined staying here again if I go back to Seattle. 
3986793,37898002,2015-07-11,36720294,Mi Ryang,"The place was just as listed. 
Quiet and safe neighborhood, with a beautiful garden and detailed instructions.
I loved the little basket with the towels and chocolate. It made me feel welcomed."
3986793,38305064,2015-07-14,31277772,Bonnie,"Fang was very welcoming, but also considerate of our privacy.
The room overlooked a quiet serene garden in which to read. The neighborhood was lovely and a 5 minute walk got you to Carkeek Park and another 10 minute walk gets you to Puget Sound within Carkeek Park. "
3986793,39190157,2015-07-21,36119314,Betty,"Her home is in a very safe neighborhood and it is easy to get around Seattle from this address. The best word I can use for her home was ""Serene"".  We had been traveling for 10 days and this was the perfect place to take a deep breath and relax. Also, the shared kitchen gave us the chance to fix a few healthy meals!"
3986793,40781375,2015-08-02,67054,Patricia,"Had a great stay at Fang's home while mine was being readied for sale. She had some wonderful touches - a basket filled with chocolate treats, fluffy white towels, hand towels, and a clearly communicated sheet that explained how to use her lock system, as well as her house use preferences.  Everything was clean and well maintained.  I'd recommend this spot for any traveler to Seattle - thanks, Fang!"
3986793,41107931,2015-08-04,21617627,Brooke,"Beautiful house, very quiet, clean, peaceful!"
3986793,42300074,2015-08-12,25843338,Cara,"Clean and close to downtown (20 min drive). Feng was a good host, she gave us food recommendations for food and parking tips."
3986793,43134600,2015-08-17,40214934,Jim,This was a great experience for us. Fang was very nice and gave us some good tips on things to see and do in Seattle. Bus service to downtown is available and easy to use. The room  was very nice and quiet. It was very comfortable place to stay. 
3986793,43998293,2015-08-23,39474330,Royal,Fang was extremely nice & accommodating. Her house is incredibly clean and well kept. I highly recommend staying with her! 
6185083,32406518,2015-05-17,403337,Rami,"Noah's place in a calm and leafy part of Seattle is a comfortable place in a comforting city. The whole place was clean and has a touch of character to how it's organised, which I found quite relaxing. Great amenities. Near a whole slew of fun things to do. If you don't mind hills you can practically walk everywhere otherwise it has great bus links. I can't think of anything that could be improved upon. It's already a pretty great place to stay and call home base."
6185083,41740545,2015-08-09,31043566,Madan,"Noah's place was very homely and the location was excellent in terms of connectivity to downtown or elsewhere.  We stayed 3 months and Noah was quite accommodating.  He was mostly not home, but whenever he was around, he was quite fun to talk to. When he was going to have friends over, he would inform us way in advance so that we're not surprised. 
There was a time when the WiFi wasn't working for 2 weeks, but that was because he wasn't around to deal with the cable company. So really no complaints! Like everyone else, he has some quirks that you will have to accept. But all in all, we had a really good time staying at the Art Lair."
6185083,43258137,2015-08-18,22224985,Reynaldo,"Noah is an exceptional host! I have no complaints. His communication was quick and he's a very friendly person. His place is walking distance to Capitol Hill and there are plenty of bus stops near to get you to other parts of the city. 

Thanks Noah!  "
6185083,44128529,2015-08-24,5559705,Caleb,"Noah is as radiant and lovely as he appears on his profile. Staying with him was an absolute delight. The house is clean and homely, and the room is comfortable - even the firm futon provides a great night's sleep.
The neighbourhood is conveniently located. A short walk to local cafes, shops and restaurants, or a quick (20min) bus ride will get you downtown.
I recommend staying with Noah to anyone who wishes to ditch the hotel scene, and swap it for a home away from home, and making a new friend. "
6185083,44584467,2015-08-27,34744126,Robert,"A great place at unbeatable value! Noah's place is extremely cute, and we loved the decorations. We unfortunately didn't see much of Noah, but he seems lively and friendly, and certainly has great taste if his home is any indication. The big highlight of this listing however is definitely the location at the price! We were super close to the heart of the city at a price that was way better than basically anybody else that we looked at in the area. The only possible concern is that the bed is incredibly firm. However, it was only a very minor issue for us, and nothing Washington's wonderful legal cannabis can't help fix if you're a light sleeper. A wonderful place to stay and highly recommended."
6185083,44742997,2015-08-28,42596896,Noah,"We only stayed with Noah for one night and most of our time in the apartment was spent sleeping but I still have real nice things to say. The place was super clean and comfortable, and communications with Noah were totally friendly and easy. A total pleasure! "
6185083,45097484,2015-08-31,20382146,Greg,"So, Noah's awesome. We had a great time from start to finish. Even though we didn't meet him right away due to our travel time and how busy our first day in Seattle was, we still felt very welcome the moment we walked in the door. His personal touch is in every part of his apartment and it's a delight. From the photos and how he's described his home, it's bang on - an artsy little pad where anything goes! Also, his neighbourhood is lovely, easy to get in and out of and park, plus a short walk down to the downtown core, which was pretty key for us as well.
Once our schedules overlapped and we were able to catch up with Noah, we found him to be a wonderful, swell person. Just a kind, generous soul that is very easy to get along with. Lovely to chat and laugh with, which is rather key.
So, like I said, we had a wonderful little adventure in Seattle, and Noah's home was key to the whole excursion! We will definitely be back to Seattle, and will always check in with Noah first, if only to say, ""Hi!"", but hopefully to find a small home-away-from-home!"
6185083,45803777,2015-09-06,3108811,Erik,Noah was fantastic. What a gem of a person and an abode. Instant friendship. The place was really clean and had fun art everywhere.
6185083,46331124,2015-09-09,42174259,Seth,"Noah was a good host. He gave us everything we needed and a quick rundown of the place, good place to chill after a bunch of long walks in Seattle. Would recommend."
6185083,47044414,2015-09-15,28401554,Joanie,"Staying with Noah was definitely a pleasant experience! His home was very comfortable and well decorated. He was a great host providing places to see and eat all around Seattle. He was always there to help. His location was great as it was steps away from bus stops to help get around all over the city. All in all, awesome experience!"
6185083,47628974,2015-09-21,395554,David,"Noah is an amazing soul, energetic and aspiring. Just lovely in general.

The apartment is very cool and relaxed. Well located; an easy walk or Uber down Pike and Pine street, or downtown.

An excellent way to introduce yourself to Seattle."
6185083,56469835,2015-12-14,33481294,Francesca,"Noah is a great host! The house is very nice and clean, and the location is super convenient. Strongly recommended!"
6554352,34394452,2015-06-08,10613766,Andrew,The host canceled this reservation 82 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6554352,35696136,2015-06-21,33865464,Camillo,"Scott was very helpful by letting my daughter pick up the key since we would be coming in late. Nice neighborhood but with construction still in process on the building next door and the street outside.  It didn't bother us much since we were out most of the time.  Brand new bed that slept great, the modern bathroom was next to the bedroom with plenty of hot water and bright sunlight. For extended stays, Scott should consider washer/dryer access.  To sum it up, it was a pleasant experience."
6554352,36884437,2015-07-02,28885080,Daniel,"This was our first experience in a private room, and Scott and Jeremy made it so wonderful! The lodging itself was great. We had a spacious bedroom, own living room with cable and bathroom. It was very clean. It was a beautiful house with a gorgeous view of the water from the roof! It was in the perfect location too. Scott and Jeremy were very kind and great hosts. They even made us breakfast one morning! They were both very helpful and knowledgeable in things to do/don't do in Seattle.  We felt very comfortable and welcomed there. We really enjoyed our time and are very thankful we chose this Airbnb.
"
6554352,37795886,2015-07-10,17900708,Flavia,"I really enjoyed staying at this very clean, new and organized apartment  in West Seattle. It was 15 minute drive to Downtown Seattle but we could also take the bus, which we didn't. We drove and it was fine. It was a short drive to Alki beach in Seattle where there were some nice restaurants and great views.
Scott and Jeremy were both very helpful and made us feel welcomed in their home. They were attentive to our needs and made sure we had what we needed. I would recommend them as hosts. "
6554352,38139030,2015-07-13,34600689,Paul,"Scott was very cordial.  The room was comfortable & clean.  With the room being downstairs from the quarters of our hosts, it was a very private setting for us, plus the extra sitting room was a nice feature for watching TV when we wanted to."
6554352,38630742,2015-07-17,10975842,Afton,"Visiting Seattle, STAY HERE!!!

Scott and Jeremy were wonderful and gracious hosts. The accommodations they offer are impeccably clean, comfortable and extremely private. The location is prime and cannot be beat. Scott was kind and available to answer any questions I needed. If I'm back in Seattle, as a visitor and not a resident, I will be back here, hands down!  "
6554352,39024083,2015-07-20,25644543,Alyson,"We had such a wonderful time with Scott and Jeremy as hosts! They made us feel like family during our visit to Seattle. They were so thoughtful, helping us with bus routes and giving us movies to watch one evening. We had so much fun and feel like we made two new friends. We hope they will still be hosting next year when we travel to Seattle! "
6554352,39663832,2015-07-25,27558417,Chelsea,Communication and check in was great and stress free. Scott and Jeremy's home was beautiful and a great way to spend our last night in Seattle! Parking was not an issue and the roof deck was great! Highly recommend. 
6554352,40044866,2015-07-27,899899,Andrew,I had a great time staying with Scott.  My hosts were friendly and made my stay very comfortable.  I highly recommend their place to anyone staying in Seattle!
6554352,42132144,2015-08-11,28780093,Michelle,"We're 4 students traveling to USA for the first time, and Scott's home was a great starting point to explore Seattle for 5-6 days.  Buses to downtown stop nearby, and there were supermarkets and fast food joints within walking distance, which was very convenient for us. The hosts were friendly and helpful in recommending us places to check out during our stay here, and the home is very clean and organised. One thing that could improve the whole experience would be maybe providing washer/dryer access for longer stays? However, overall a great stay! :)"
6554352,42868234,2015-08-16,28883231,Samantha,Beautiful accommodations with Scott & Jeremy!  Had lots of privacy on their first floor with our own bedroom and bathroom. They were very accommodating to our travel schedule as well. Easy access to buses all over Seattle! We absolutely loved the Seattle area and look forward to staying here again for our next visit! 
6554352,43080099,2015-08-17,37244305,Terry,"The room was great, location was perfect. Room was very clean and the bed was super comfortable.
Scott was the perfect host and would highly recommend this unit to others"
6554352,43665797,2015-08-21,19992908,Siyang,"We really like this clean and wonderful place. Jeremy and Scott are very nice. The bed with grey sheets was very comfortable. Two bedrooms and a bathroom were located in the first floor, which is private. The roof deck had pretty ocean view. Street parking is easy to find. We had a good time to stay there. Highly recommend."
6554352,50342013,2015-10-11,30305543,Jofelyne,"I couldn't have picked a better place to stay, especially for my first time using Airbnb. The space was very clean and quiet. It felt like home. Scott and Jeremy are friendly and knowledgable. They helped us a lot by giving us tips on where to go and what to see in Seattle. Bono, their dog, was pretty awesome too! He's friendly and curious and loved to keep us, me and boyfriend, company in the kitchen. 

Overall, we will definitely consider to stay here again the next time we come to Seattle. 

Much Mahalos, Scott & Jeremy! "
6554352,53310077,2015-11-07,47405776,Sean,"Great location for getting out for a run or walk.  The private room was as advertised and very comfortable.

Highly recommended."
3888924,30980531,2015-04-30,12362661,Erin,"Great experience. The cor36 is just as advertised, great young tech talent sharing a big, beautiful house. "
3888924,41578653,2015-08-08,28395674,Satwant,"It was my first time in the US, and I had a lot of fun staying at cor36. The place is decently close to a bus stop, which helps a lot. The supermarket was about 12 blocks away, but in the long run it didn't matter much. The neighborhood seems pretty safe, and is close to Fremont and University District. The Burke Gilman trail is right in front of the house, so you can go on a long bike ride or a decent run around the Lake Union, or you could go kayaking there.
This place is a hacker house, which meant staying with a lot of like minded people. Being from tech background, I had lots of fun interacting with some business people. The house caption happens to be an MIT and UW grad, and is a very smart guy. We'd have weekly talks by all the amazing people we had on stay at cor36, or the sister IO House.
One downside was bunk beds which the portfolio didn't specify. Also there's one washroom on 6 people, so that might be bothersome. For me it all worked out quite comfortably. I was getting an amazing experience hanging out with such cool people, and I'd recommend the place to anybody looking for a stay in the summers."
3888924,55712165,2015-12-05,40512779,Benjamin,"I stayed here for about 3 months while I was on an internship.  It was very good housing for a short term stay.  The place was very quiet while I was there so I had no problems being able to sleep.  The people there are very friendly and most of them are employed so everyone is very professional.  If you are a tech inclined person I highly recommend staying here.  It's good for networking and was a great community to be a part of.  If I were to come back to Seattle, I'm sure I would stay here longer."
202174,1841393,2012-07-30,2842525,Larissa,"We had a great time staying at Apryl's place. I was a little nervous about booking for the first time. But so glad we did, her place was a really great location. If it works out I would love to stay again at Apryl's place."
202174,2183736,2012-09-03,3328702,Bob,"This place surpasses all expectations of a vacation rental. It felt like we were being treated to a private modern resort. The style is fabulous and uncluttered, but it somehow was also homey and comfortable. The hosts were very accommodating and thoughtful.  Its location is ideal (close to Capitol Hill, downtown, Lake Washington, and Puget Sound ferries) and the value is very good. Its open plan is on 3 levels: kitchen, living room, and bedroom. So super cool! "
202174,11091763,2014-03-20,10347568,Erica,"Talk about ideal rental! This place was amazing. The pictures don't do it just to some extent. Beautiful house. The heated floors were so nice. The backyard was the perfect oasis. The soaking tub big and relaxing. It was so great I was almost afraid to touch anything. However Apryl was very encouraging to take advantage of everything. We walked to a grocery store nearby but used Uber for getting downtown. She also picked us up from the train station which was so nice! Easy check in, easy check out. Great overall experience. We will definitely be renting this place again when we return. "
202174,11245414,2014-03-26,2018852,Jessica,"My husband and I recently spent 6 nights in Apryl's beautiful home. Her home is thoughtfully laid out and well designed. The first floor entry includes the kitchen, a dining table and a private patio. The second floor includes a full bath, living room and office space. The third floor is the master bedroom and bath. The master bath was my favorite space in the house. Dual vanities, a vaulted ceiling with a skylight, a large soaking tub, a stone tile shower and heated floors. Honestly, I miss the bathroom already. 

Apryl's home is close enough to all the action of the Pike/Pine corridor on Capital Hill but far enough away to enjoy the quiet. We had a car for our first few days (hooray for a dedicated parking spot) and then walked and/or used uber to get around the rest of the time. There's a Trader Joe's nearby so we were able to stock up on essentials. 

Overall it was a wonderful experience. Apryl was very nice (met briefly upon arrival) and communicative. Her home was everything we needed and more. I would gladly stay again in the future. "
202174,13155061,2014-05-20,10871698,Tammy,"This property is AMAZING!  The pictures do not do it justice.  We spent 3 nights here in May and found everything to be wonderfully appointed, and within walking distance to great spots in the city.  Having a dedicated parking spot was super convenient, and the kitchen and it's amenities made us not want to leave this peaceful place.  What a cool spot! "
202174,13346134,2014-05-26,4080842,Liz,"Apryl and Erick's home is beautiful and they are very gracious hosts. If you appreciate modern design and attention to detail, this is the place to stay. The location is ideal. I'd definitely stay again!"
202174,14397388,2014-06-18,14453913,Valerie,We had a wonderful two nights at Apryl's- it was near the end of our trip and I was excited to cook for ourselves since we had eaten out for every meal for over a week. The kitchen was so fun to explore- lots of gadgets to play with! We did venture out for food too and there are plenty of places within walking distance and April gave us some recommendations. It's a quiet complex and like everyone else has written the decor is fantastic. A perfect escape and just a few minutes drive from the downtown area. Thank you both for hosting us!
202174,14581441,2014-06-22,7727563,Evan,"Absolutely lovely place, very modern and comfy. Apryl was very quick with responses and gave great recommendations. Great location, my girlfriend and I couldn't have been happier. Quick walk to the international district and downtown. "
202174,17688250,2014-08-16,17408456,Rob,"This was our first time staying at an air bnb property and staying at Apryl and Erick's home sold us on this way of travel.  Our family of 3, including 18 year old son, spent 4 nights at Apryl and Erick's home. First, the location was great to access anywhere we wanted to go in Seattle. We were on a road trip and appreciated the assigned parking space so we didn't have to search for street parking. There was plenty of space for all three of us, with the master suite on the top floor. The second floor included the TV room, a small bathroom and office that doubled as the second bedroom for our son. At the end of a long day of sight seeing, we took full advantage of Netflix on the Apple TV to wind down. The kitchen is on the main floor and is very well equipped. We only ate breakfast here, as we wanted to experience the Seattle restaurants, so we didn't take advantage of all of the amenities in the kitchen or the grill on the deck.

Apryl greeted us when we arrived with all of the info we needed to enjoy our stay in her home, including an instruction sheet. She also had fresh flowers and a chilled bottle of Chardonnay waiting for us after a long day of travel. Apryl also responded quickly to any questions we had.

We would recommend Apryl and Erick's home for anyone wanting a home away from home in Seattle."
202174,19532745,2014-09-14,19659635,Pinar,"Apryl and Erick's gorgeous home is amazingly modern, comfortable and decorated in good taste! We were welcomed with a delicious bottle of wine. We especially enjoyed playing in their fully equipped kitchen being such foodies we are. Overall we would want to stay at this place everytime we visit Seattle. Thank you Apryl and Erick for being such amazing hosts!!

Best,
Cole and Pınar"
202174,20189157,2014-09-25,1303695,Barbara,"It was a pleasure to stay at Apryl and Erick's quiet, smoke- and cat-free condo during my work trip to Seattle, because I too am allergic.  As someone who has been involved in environmental stewardship since college, likes to recycle materials, and with a green building credential, it was a special treat to stay in a green-built home with some furniture that they make from recycled wood. Their place is very clean; they had put out a bottle of local wine, and granted access to a fully-outfitted kitchen, which--although I enjoy cooking--I had no time to enjoy. There is a charming deck in back which I imagine would be fun to hang out when it's not raining. As others have written, the master bath is a welcome place of soaking quiet after a long day at work. The block where they live is undergoing transformation and there is a mix of older small homes and newer condos. Except for getting drenched by the rain, I had no problems walking back and forth to my work site in the International District about 18 minutes away on the first two days. When I told my clients that I was doing that, they recommended that I get rides at night because the walk goes through a few ""sketchy"" blocks. I used a local bus with a very helpful bus driver one night. On my last day I signed up for Uber whose service was great. I used Yellow Cab from and to SeaTax airport and had great service with them too.

The one bit of ""sightseeing"" I did was to visit the fantastic Central Public Library, about 30 minutes walk from their home. If you love books, community spaces, innovation or libraries, CPL is definitely worth a visit. 

Although my hosts were out of the country, communication with Apryl by text and email was prompt throughout, and they made access easy for me. I'm sorry their place is not available for my next work trip, for I would surely ask to book again. I recommend Apryl's and Erick's condo without reservation!"
202174,20761705,2014-10-05,19434036,Emeric,"Apryl's home does a great job of immediately setting you at ease and helping you feel comfortable.  From the warmth of the radiant floors to the relaxing, mid century style, this house was everything we had wanted on this trip and more.  We even took the chance to enjoy a nice long soak in the tub, appreciating the beautiful, Pacific Northwest light that trickled in. "
202174,28828516,2015-03-30,10037560,Justine,"This was our first time booking with Airbnb and I must say that Apryl's home truly set the bar for what an Airbnb should be. The entire home was clean, tidy and welcoming. We were expecting the place to be much smaller than it actually was which was nice! We are Apple employees so it was great to find a modern place with great technology and art throughout the home - just as it was advertised on the Airbnb website. The first floor - the kitchen - is probably the most beautiful aspect of the home, so if you enjoy cooking/baking then this place is a must! They have all of the high end, modern cookware and appliances to get your hands dirty, and then clean again! There's a record player with a small library of records to set the mood as you cook or eat. This is a 'no shoes' type of home - but the heated floors save you from cold feet. The living room and office are nestled into the second floor. There is a large flat screen hooked up to some top of the line Bowers & Wilkins surround sound speakers as well as an Apple TV and they also have cable for channel surfing. There is a computer which is not for guest use - bring your own, the wifi is fast and reliable. This second floor is also where you'll meet the first bathroom, complete with shower/tub combo. On the third and final floor, you'll be greeted with an awesome, firm queen sized bed and the lovely master bathroom which has a full size soaking tub as well as a huge shower (separate). There are also his & hers sinks and heated floors. Also, since they didn't have a hair blow dryer, she went out of her way to purchase one & we came down to the table in the kitchen with a brand new one waiting. The washer/dryer are pleasingly hidden within the bedroom closets. There is a tv which has basic cable. There's also a radio which takes auxiliary so you can plug your phone or music player in to play your own tunes. There are windows galore in this home - whether it rains or the sun is shining, you can take it all in no matter where you are in the house! The back yard wasn't put to use by us but there is a grill and plenty of seating for a few guests. 
 Apryl was so easy to work with & very accommodating. It was an awesome first time AirBnb experience!
"
202174,49273970,2015-10-02,16250122,Bonnie,"Check-in was super easy as Apryl leaves a keybox in front of the home. Upon entering, a bottle of wine and letter made the experiencing feel welcoming. I was a little disappointed to find that the bed sheets had hair within and also came across a white stain (size of 4 quarters) on the bedding. I contacted Apryl and she assured me that the bedding was cleaned, but it still felt weird to sleep in the bed after finding the stain. Also confusing was that the post listed that it came with essentials, but I had to go out to buy shampoo/conditioner/body soap. Maybe my standards have been skewed from other Seattle Airbnb experiences?"
3971137,23081064,2014-11-22,14254294,Christopher,Marni provided a quiet cozy place for my girlfriend and I.  We had fun listening to the record player and the chance to make a full breakfast! Highly recommended!
3971137,23340910,2014-11-29,8837067,Faye,We stayed at the studio with our 3 week old daughter during thanksgiving for 2 nights. It was the perfect size for our family. The neighborhood was great and we walked to breakfast and coffee shops. The place was very cozy- we had great communication and flexibility with Marni. 
3971137,23711192,2014-12-08,15541144,Stacy,Marni's place is in a great neighborhood with many places to walk in Wallingford and central to other exciting spots in Seattle. The listing is as described. 
3971137,23918417,2014-12-14,104846,Jessi,"Marni was a communicative and super friendly host for our weekend stay in Seattle. We didn't get to meet her in person, but the place was prepped and ready for our arrival, and check-in was smooth. It was so nice to have a parking spot right out front when we came back from our city explorations during the day. The studio itself is well laid-out, cozy, and the decor is made up of stylish vintage curios, books, and flourishing plant life. We loved it!

Thanks for everything, Marni. :)"
3971137,24601012,2014-12-31,1680215,Ben,"Marni was an outstanding host! She was extremely friendly and communicated effectively before and during my trip regarding logistics. Studio was cozier and more charming than described, very well-situated near Wallingford stores, and also very clean and super cozy. I'd highly recommend staying at Marni's studio. "
3487824,15719511,2014-07-14,5727299,Priscilla,"My sister & I decided to take an impromptu trip to Seattle & found Gene's affordable yet excellently located apartment. 

Host: Gene is one of the best airbnb hosts out there. He goes above and beyond the regular host. He was even kind enough to alter our check-in/check-out times. He gave us a couple quick tours around the area and also offered to pick us up/drop us off to locations whenever he was available. He's incredibly easy to converse with and was available at all times through the phone/text/airbnb app. My sister & I were sad to miss his wife, but maybe next time! :)

Location: PRIME. You are right between the international district and downtown. My sister and I got an ORCA card and used public transportation/walked everywhere. We used Uber to get to further destinations. You seriously won't need a car with this location.

Room: My sister & I were his first guests. The apartment has a queen size bed, walk in closet, and bathroom. Minimalistic but contains everything you need. Linens and towels were soft and clean. I have a sensitive back but the bed was comfortable and allowed me to get a good nights sleep. He provided pastries every morning and a stocked mini-fridge as well.

I'm one of those people that like my privacy and generally book entire homes/apt instead of private rooms, but Gene's apartment has been one of my favorite experiences through airbnb. I highly recommend you book this place. I just hope next time I decide to go up to Seattle, there will be availability for me. ;) "
3487824,15929948,2014-07-18,6339112,Paul,"I guess my only ""problem"" with my stay Chez Dex is that as my first AirBnB experience, I've been thoroughly spoiled and my expectations have been set very high for next time.

The bedroom is gorgeous, with a top quality queen-sized mattress and luxurious linens, a nice private bath, a huge walk-in closet, and my own little fridge with late-night snacks, soft drinks, and bottled water. The huge bow window provides gorgeous views of Puget Sound, and combines with the room's ceiling fan to provide a nice cool room even on warm summer Seattle evenings. It was an especially warm humid week when I was there, and I was comfortable every night. The fresh flowers and fresh pastries in the morning were a nice touch.

I particularly loved the huge life-size black-and-white photographic portrait of the very severe looking Temperance woman from the early 1900s on my wall. Gene was just in the process of adding new artwork and features to the apartment while I was there, as he is just settling back into Seattle himself. I have no doubt that with his taste, the decor will be terrific. Even while I was there, he was adding things like a TV for my room with a ChromeCast and an iPad to control it to provide Netflix and YouTube movies

Gene has a long background in the hospitality industry and it shows; he really knows how to take care of his guests in a low-key way. Responses to my pre-booking questions were nearly immediate and he made a point of calling me the day before my arrival just to check in. He even picked me up at the Link rail station on my arrival, to save me the short walk up the steep hill to his place!

I was in town for a conference at the International Convention Center, and found the 15 minute or so walk to the conference each morning to be just enough to wake me up and get the blood moving. The neighborhood was great for walking (only a few blocks to Seattle's waterfront) and I was perfectly comfortable walking back late at night from conference events.

There are three paid parking lots right at his corner, but since Seattle is such an easy city to get around on foot and with their transit system, I was actually glad I didn't have a vehicle worry about while I was there.

Though meals were provided at the conference, but I did take advantage of the nicely equipped kitchen for a mug of tea in the morning. If I'd been staying longer, I'd have taken advantage of the ability to pick up groceries in the neighborhood and make a few of my own meals in addition to enjoying all the local restaurants.

Gene's got a fascinating background in the hospitality and music industries. I really enjoyed just sitting and visiting with him several times during my stay. I'm already looking forward to a return visit for next year's conference!
"
3487824,16031579,2014-07-20,12356013,Antonio,"Gene was very accommodating, making sure I had plenty of time to check out. He takes excellent care of the lovely apartment which, by the way, has great views of the city from every room!"
3487824,16220784,2014-07-23,17302103,Toni,"Gene was extremely hospitable - he offered rides to and from SEATAC, which we didn't end up needing because of how convenient a link train station is to the apartment (about two blocks away), which only cost $2-$3 and quickly gets you to the airport. He also brought over pastries to the apartment every day for guests, and  coffee, tea, soda, and snacks were available for free. It's a two-bedroom apartment, but each room has its own bathroom, and he let us know every night if there would be someone else staying in the apartment. He always responded quickly to questions, when I had them. The building feels safe, the apartment is kept very clean and airy, the bed is comfortable, and there are televisions in the living room and each bedroom. You also have access to an in-apartment washer and dryer. The apartment is really close to downtown, and you can easily walk to a lot of destinations. For places that are a little farther away, you are really close to bus stops that can get you all over the city. You get a great view from the small deck, and access to the rooftop with an even better view and tables and chairs for lounging. We had a great experience, and would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in Seattle!"
3487824,16851472,2014-08-03,3056272,Phyllis,"Our first experience with Airbnb, staying at Gene and Jamie’s place, was great.  Gene kindly offered to pick us up at the light rail station because the apartment is up on a steep hill.  His place is exactly as described and shown in the photos.  It was super clean and new, the bed was firm and comfortable, towels clean and fluffy.  It was really a bnb, because Gene brought fresh baked goods every day—muffins, croissants, Danishes—and there was a coffee maker and plenty of coffee so we didn’t have to go out for breakfast.  The mini-fridge in our room was stocked with water, juice, soda, and snacks.  Stay here and go home 5 pounds heavier :)
 
Things to know:  The views are great—you can see the waterfront, Smith Tower, ballparks (we watched the Safeco fireworks from the roof deck, a nice spot to relax or bring up a meal).  The location is very convenient.  You won’t need a car; it is walking distance to everything.  We walked to Chinatown/International District, Pioneer Square, the ferry terminal and waterfront, the library, art museum, Pike Place Market, and even the Space Needle.  Restaurants and coffee shops are plentiful.  However, if you’re a TV-holic, there is Chromecast, not regular channels or cable.  It didn’t bother us, but if you’re a light sleeper, the building is between a freeway and fire station.  There are two bedrooms and two baths, so you will have roommates, as is stated in the description.  The guests we shared with were all very nice!

This place is a great value."
3487824,17001648,2014-08-05,17849552,Rachel,"Gene and Jamie were so welcoming! Their apartment is exactly as it appears on their profile - clean, comfortable and in a great location. The light rail is down the street and it's just a 10 minute walk to pikes place and the downtown shopping area. We will definitely stay here for our next trip to Seattle! "
3487824,17073302,2014-08-06,943117,Fred,"My brother and I only spent one night with Gene on our way thru Seattle.  The location is excellent, so we were able to walk everywhere.  We recommend the Red Lantern on Jackson and Main St. Gyro for food.  We will be back when we have more time.
Fred"
3487824,17111474,2014-08-07,14337393,Sara,"Gene was a great, great host. He was friendly, knowledgable, and even picked us up at the train station. The apartment was also wonderful--clean, well-decorated, and well-located. He even has Bay views! We really enjoyed our brief stay."
3487824,17172745,2014-08-08,13169684,James,"We had a pleasant experience with Gene during our stay in Seattle. He was interesting to talk to about his career, and even gave me some valuable advice. The shower is nice, and there was even a mini refrigerator filled with snacks and bottles of water for us. The best part of the stay was the bed. The bed was incredibly comfortable. My girlfriend and I fell asleep as soon as we laid down in the bed for 2 hours (it was 4pm and we were supposed to be exploring instead of napping). After reading other reviews, I see that the hosts provided breakfast, coffee, and rides for other people. We were not offered breakfast or coffee in the morning, or even a ride to and/or from the train stop, and we could not get a hold of Gene prior to check in, but our stay was comfortable nonetheless. If you have to walk from the stop like we did, the apartment is atop a very steep hill. The hosts were also nice enough to let us leave our bags until 7pm the last day of our stay, even though check out was at noon (we didn't want to carry our bags around while we explored). "
3487824,17454650,2014-08-12,17158306,Sarah,"Everything was as described in the listing. The apartment (& rooftop) offer great views. The room was comfortable with mini snacks & drinks. There was breakfast & coffee available each morning. The apartment felt very secure, is within walking distance of a number of sites, and parking was easy & convenient. There is some city noise that can be bothersome with the windows open, but you'll have that. We only met Gene briefly, but he was friendly, and was very prompt in responding to all electronic communications. I would recommend a stay here!"
3487824,17537658,2014-08-13,2016093,Nicolas,Good
3487824,17582127,2014-08-14,18849464,Larisse,"Gene made us feel so welcome on our first experience staying as guests. His place is in immaculate condition and he provides his guests with a fantastic experience that rivals staying in a top hotel. He is quick to communicate, he provided coffee and treats to his guest free of charge, and the bedroom is so comfortable and modernly decorated. We would happily recommend this place to friends and family and would be happy to stay there again our next time in Seattle!"
3487824,17715640,2014-08-16,10512885,Kim,"As noted in another review, the room is quite noisy even with the window closed. Without an open window, the room is stuffy and warm, even on a cool rainy night. Although our host was online when we checked in, internet was not available that evening or the next morning. A call to the host failed to resolve the problem. Perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of our stay were the pre-visit communications from the host which were sarcastic and rude. Because we were coming in on the bus, I asked for an early check-in, to which the host agreed. I was prepared to accept a 'no-that's not how we roll' but I was not prepared for the communications that followed. I had also mentioned that I liked half and half with my coffee (but was prepared to pick it up myself, if necessary). The follow-up message I received read, in part: ""Do let me know what other special requests you have. I find it fascinating"" Later (after 1AM) I received a message that read ""Let me know if chocolates on the pillow is necessary."" None of the messages I received from the host were necessary or helpful, nor were they in any way related to the ""high communication"" he mentions in his listing. If this had been my first airbnb experience, it would have been my last."
3487824,17859152,2014-08-18,18499407,David,"Going to echo all the positive posts everyone else left. 
While I did not get a chance to personally meet Gene he was a wonderful host.  Everything was as advertised and nicer than expected.  Clear lines of communication and the little attention to detail touches made my girl friend and I feel very welcome and made for a great weekend getaway in Seattle that we will never forget.

I absolutely recommend Chez DEX and if given the opportunity would love to visit again.  

Thanks Gene"
3487824,18028590,2014-08-20,19226671,Brett,"We had read the previous reviews regarding this listing which were influential in our decision making.  Unfortunately, our experience was not in keeping with those that we read and I have chosen to contact Gene directly and advise him of our misgivings.

Suffice it to say that our experience was that of a room only without personal contact from the  host, very much unlike our first experience with Airbnb.

The apartment is well located in Seattle, our room was very clean and the apartment is well appointed however the fire station, in close proximity to the listing, can impact upon sleep."
3487824,18322533,2014-08-25,17947127,Melissa,"The listing did not do this adorable spot justice!! The hosts gave great directions, the room I stayed in was clean, stylish and the coffee and danishes every morning were a great touch!!

The place was central and close to everything in Seattle - when I needed bus or other transportation gene and Jamie were very helpful with suggestions!!!

I had a health crisis at the end of my
Trip and both hosts went out of their way to make sure I was okay - I felt like I had a family away from home!!! I would recommend their place to anyone wanting a true and very gracious Seattle experience!!!"
3487824,18605923,2014-08-28,19579579,Raina,"The room exceeded my expectations. The pictures truly don't do it justice. Comfortable bed, mini fridge with snacks, and private bathroom. Gene was there to greet us and Jamie was there to see us off. Both were so helpful and a pleasure to chat with. I absolutely loved the gorgeous rooftop view while eating the delicious pastry they provided. The location was perfect and so close to everything worth seeing, most of the time we just walked. I highly recommend this host! "
3487824,18629849,2014-08-29,19701671,Kristy,Truly enjoyed spending a night at Gene's place. Great view and easy access to the light rail. I was glad that we were warned that it is atop a steep hill but we were able to hoof it up there with our luggage without too much of a struggle! Everything was very clean and comfortable. Enjoyed the mini-fridge snacks :)
3487824,18722782,2014-08-31,17827465,Derek,"I stayed at Chez DEX over Labor Day weekend 2014 and it was a remarkable experience. The listing was accurate to the space and amenities. It was in a perfect location compared to the sporting arenas, downtown, the waterfront, and Capitol Hill - all areas we walked to during our stay. Gene was easy to work with and very welcoming during our stay. I would definitely stay here again!"
3487824,18814227,2014-09-01,18951949,Jessica,Gene was very communicative about our stay and answered all if my questions quickly. The place was a great location downtown with a wonderful view. Gene was nice enough to let me do my laundry at an awful hour and check in very late. The good coffee smell in the morning woke me up. I would stay with Gene again!
3487824,18954939,2014-09-03,13088778,Sam,"Gene was a great host. He gave us great advice on using the metro, left snacks and drinks in a mini fridge in our room, a light breakfast in the morning, and gave us as much privacy as we wanted. The room felt like a hotel with a super comfy bed, private bathroom, and a tv with chrome cast. It was easy to find the place and it was in a perfect location for exploring the city. I would highly recommend staying here. "
3487824,19278528,2014-09-09,19650892,Logan,"I truly enjoyed my stay with Gene n Jaimie. They were very nice. I felt very comfortable. The place is close to the train station and also to downtown. The room was cozy and clean, and I absolutely appreciated the many pillows!! That really made me happy :D I would definitely stay with them again next time. "
3487824,19335413,2014-09-10,19755201,Kath,Gene welcomed us with charm even though he was quite busy.   Room was as photographed and expected and all accessories as portrayed.  Area was close to downtown up a very steep hill.   We parked on the street.   Very convenient to downtown.
3487824,19389027,2014-09-11,20532986,Maureen,"Clean, private, and welcoming room with plenty of snacks. Hosts were very accommodating. "
3487824,19435066,2014-09-12,20413683,Kushak,"Gene and his wife were terrific hosts. They went out of their way to make me feel comfortable and help me about on my first visit to Seattle. Not only were they gracious hosts, they truly treated me like family. Highly recommended to anyone who needs a place to stay in Seattle. "
3487824,19470940,2014-09-13,19542424,Everett,"We had a GREAT time at Chez Dex.  It was our first AirBNB experience and we couldn't have asked for a better one.
Awesome location for going to games, very close to downtown, and you can walk everywhere.
Gene is an excellent host.  He is very easy going, very welcoming, the place is very clean, very cozy, and you feel right at home.
We would definitely stay there again.
Thanks !"
3487824,19680758,2014-09-16,19343128,Cong,"Gene's place is amazing, comfortable and even better than the picture. The location is good and close to the metro station. I really think it was a good choice that I made."
3487824,19804046,2014-09-18,21252091,Alan,"The apartment was just as described.  I stayed in the master bedroom at the end of hall.  There was a couple traveling from Europe that stayed in the other room the first night, and a different couple traveling to Victoria staying the next night.   Both times I had nice conversations with them, and was a nicer experience than staying in a hotel.  The mini fridge had plenty of water, soda and snacks.   I only used the water, but it was nice to have the options.  There's also an iron and ironing board, hair dryer, and plenty of choices for shampoos, conditioners, body washes, etc.

Note after the first time when you ring the apartment to get into the building, you'll have a set of keys, one of which opens the building door, so then you can come and go anytime.

It was a little warm when I was there and it's a bit noisy at night with the windows open, but there's a great ceiling fan, so was very comfortable. 

I was there on business at Union Station, and it's a very short walk (although the last two blocks are steep).  And there's great sushi (Maneki) 1 block away, so very convenient location.

Finally, when I returned I received a phone call from the owners saying they had found a charger in the wall, and was it mine?  It was there when I arrived, so must have been the previous guest, but I really appreciated the call, as I've certainly left things like that in other places.

I plan to return and use Gene and Jamie's place for future trips.  "
3487824,19880899,2014-09-20,19681619,Henrie,"Stayed here for my first AirBnB experience with my wife. This place is clean and tidy. Very comfy room with a private bathroom. The location is a great spot if you want to hit up all the spots in the heart of the city. I unfortunately did not get to meet Gene, but He answered all the questions I had via text and email, and had someone help me out in his place. He set up everything to make it pretty easy for people to stay. My wife and I would come back here if we are in the city again. I would recommend staying here. "
3487824,19963051,2014-09-21,312487,Rob,Enjoyed our brief stay at Gene’s place.  The host was quick to respond to lingering questions we had even as he was out of the country many time zones away.  The location is very handy to the bus station though the walk up the hill may leave some gasping for air!   The little snacks and beverages available was a nice touch.
3487824,20220031,2014-09-25,21654447,Selina,Great one night stay at Chez DEX! Location was perfect for getting into town and the apartment was light and airy with some nice touches (fridge in room stocked with goodies). Would definitely recommend... 
3487824,20472091,2014-09-29,2702026,Pamela,"I only stayed for one night at Gene and Jamie's place, but it was wonderful! I saw Gene this morning and he was super nice. The apartment, room and bathroom are super clean and at a great location! The location is close to China town, Pioneer Square and the Bolt bus stop, where I had to be. I would definitely stay here again if I come back to Seattle. It was a great experience!"
3487824,20542068,2014-09-30,2037734,Laura & Andrew,Gene was a welcoming and accommodating host. The apartment was conveniently located and comfortable. I would recommend this to anyone for their trip to Seattle. 
3487824,20693599,2014-10-04,18494261,Suzanne,Gene was a delightful host. The apartment was exactly like the photos and has a wonderful view of the sound. We had easy access to the public transit system. We felt completely comfortable and at home. This was our first AirBnB stay and it won't be our last.
3487824,20840645,2014-10-06,20955570,Jacque,"This was a very comfortable place to stay. The proximity to public transit is great. There are a lot of interesting restaurants in the neighborhood (International District) and you can walk to the Pike Place Market in about 20 minutes. There's a nice view of the Puget Sound from the bedroom window. The hosts were both very nice and welcoming. The bed was comfortable and we were surprised by the snacks and beverages they left in the mini fridge. We really appreciated it. We couldn't figure out the Chromecast but I'm sure if we had asked the hosts they would have been more than happy to help. We didn't pursue it because we were there to see the city in a short amount of time anyways. The private bathroom is also nice and filled with shampoo, conditioner, soap, etc. Past reviewers mentioned that it was loud so I was expecting this place to be above a bar or some other noise generator, but that wasn't the case at all. The immediate buildings are all residential and we didn't find any noise outside the norm of an urban area, and we slept with the windows wide open and the ceiling fan on. Very comfortable. We were planning on keeping our rental car during our stay but because it was so centrally located we didn't need it and were able to drop it off  early. The building is at the top of a steep hill (which we're not used to in Chicago) so if you're arriving with a ton of luggage you might want to cab it. We just had carry-ons and were fine. This trip to the Pacific Northwest was our first time experiencing Air BnB and we're so happy we did! So much better and more affordable than a hotel!"
3487824,20967557,2014-10-08,18891274,Lindsey,"Highly Recommend this place! Gene is such a nice and generous  host. Room was as described, clean and nice. You can even see ocean through the balcony.  Easy access to downtown. Everything was great."
3487824,21142200,2014-10-12,19875587,Sarah,"Thanks Gene and Jamie for letting us stay at your beautiful appartment! The location was awesome close to everything walking distance from Pike Place Market,  Capitol Hill to International district.  Everything was perfect,  Matt and I had a great time :)"
3487824,21397404,2014-10-16,1042415,Jim,We took the amtrak and Gene was able to pick us up from the station and even offered to drive us around downtown showing us all the different neighborhoods and all the fancy new stadiums. We had a great stay and the bed was super comfy after our miles of walking around downtown. The hill Gene is on is a serious slope if you are hauling luggage so do keep it in mind but if you just go slow and steady its not that bad. As far as location we weer able to walk all over with no issue spending most of our brief one night stay at Pike's market and the science museum on foot. 
3487824,21500186,2014-10-18,8078488,Vasilii,"I really liked my stay with Gene. The room is super awesome, with a private bathroom. Everything inside is clean and well maintained. As a plus, there is also an observation deck upstairs. I would highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Seattle. Thank you, Gene"
3487824,21717203,2014-10-22,199362,Abiramy,"We had a very good time at Gene's place. The room and attached private bathroom is great, very comfortable, with a TV.
The hill is quite difficult if you have luggages - even without anything, actually ! - but it is located near Pike place market and everything.

Clean, nice, everything was great. Would recommend !"
3487824,21828811,2014-10-25,1711282,Veronica,"The chez was super clean, inviting, and comfortable! We loved the views from the living room and bedroom and appreciated the fully stocked fridge with snacks, sodas and water. I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking to explore downtown Seattle! "
3487824,21917372,2014-10-26,677102,Richard,"The room and apartment were exactly as described in the listing.  The room was spotless and had all the essentials needed for a comfortable stay.  Gene was in town and we chatted a bit.  He was very helpful with tips about getting around the city and things to see.  The location was great too.  Downtown, Pike Place Market, and the International District are all within walking distance."
3487824,22228732,2014-11-02,19651926,Brad,"The Dexter Experience is real! Gene knows what world class hospitality is. Such an amazing stay. Very convenient to the downtown area. Highly recommended for people attending events at Century Link, Safeco, WaMu Theater and other venues. Spectacular view and a ton of available parking!"
3487824,22397302,2014-11-05,2910534,Ian,"The host did not make us feel welcome at all. I asked about when the check in time would be and he didn't seem to have an answer, telling me to get in touch with his housekeeper who didn't respond to me until 2pm the day of check in. The neighborhood seems to be surrounded by homeless encampments. Stranger yet was being told after booking with him that the apartment complex didn't know of his renting out to others and that we, under all circumstances, should not tell anyone associated with the apartment complex about the setup. 
The other guest staying at the place during our time there was a friendly person and quite easy going, making the stay a little less unsettling. 
Then we left. And a day later were accused of stealing a towel. Upon trying to clear this misunderstanding up with Gene, we received messages about how typical it was of us 'millennials' to take what we  want and not care about the consequences. 
Overall, my  interactions with this host has been rife with issues. The lack of help after booking our stay, the odd need for secrecy about our stay and the accusation and charge for a hotel towel supposedly stolen when the owner doesn't even live in the area to confirm or deny what in fact has happened at his place quite enough of a reason for me to not recommend staying with Gene. This experience gives me pause about using Airbnb further, as this stay was such a problematic one. "
3487824,22658294,2014-11-11,888752,Paul,"The host was not present during my stay.  The apartment is very nice, with great water views. Feels much more like a corporate apartment than a lived in-home.  Very well connected to public transportation, Pioneer Square and downtown.

Situated near the top of a steep hill that a lot of people might find daunting to get to on foot."
3487824,22770598,2014-11-14,3947960,Jane,"Gene was very accommodating with an early check-in. The apartment and bedroom were very cozy and comfortable. I loved the comfortable bed! It was something I looked forward to after a long day out and made it hard to leave in the morning. 

The minifridge in the room was a nice as it was filled with beverages and snacks. The little touches added up to a big impact! Thanks for the hospitality, we enjoyed our stay very much."
3487824,23128189,2014-11-23,23744416,Bob,"I can't say enough good things about staying at Chez DEX.  Starting with the location, just 3 blocks from the downtown transit tunnel and 4 blocks from Amtrak, staying here simplifies greatly the life of the traveler, especially one with a lot of bags to carry.  The place is clean and comfortable, the views are great, and Gene and his staff are extremely responsive.

All of the little details are covered, including shower incidentals and snacks and add a nice personal touch.

"
3487824,23440029,2014-12-01,5744888,Andrea,"Very comfortable, well-lit apartment. Gene was great about explaining how the shared living arrangement worked and let me know who to expect as our roommates (I was traveling with my husband). "
3487824,23590343,2014-12-05,20168047,Dale,"I liked it. Very nice modern 2 bedroom 2 bath unit (both bedrooms available) in International District with beautiful view. Artfully appointed, comfortable living space, washer/drier in unit, full kitchen, broad selection of TV and movies."
3487824,23649785,2014-12-07,10297711,Katrina,"Gene left simple instructions for getting into the place and it was easily accessible by Amtrak and bus. The apartment was very warm and clean. We had some issues on check-out where Gene hounded us on towels we hadn't made dirty and a very creepy, enlarged portrait in the bedroom that we had taken down for the duration of our trip. While the location is central (and great) I'm not sure I'd like to stay here again."
3487824,23910021,2014-12-14,18701373,Danny,"Great hosts, clean place, overall great experience. "
3487824,24008743,2014-12-16,88247,Lindsey,"Everything was great! Host was super welcoming, provided drinks and snacks (very much appreciated), totally made me feel as though I had the run of the place. Place is easily accessible from public transportation. Workout room on site with lots of weights and a few cardio machines."
3487824,24088672,2014-12-19,8616754,Byron,"On a whim, a friend and I planned a three-day trip in Seattle, as we'd both never been before and had a few days to kill during semester holidays. Our needs were simple: an affordable place situated as close to downtown as possible, where we could keep our stuff during the day and get some shut eye at night. What we got at Chez DEX was that and much more. From the onset, Gene was highly responsive and a pleasure to communicate with. Upon arrival in Seattle, Keia, the onsite manager, was very responsive by phone and flexible with regard to our check-in time. The apartment is just as pictured - super clean, well-furnished, with interesting art on the walls and a great heating system. Jamie, Gene's wife, was in town and staying in the other suite. She was incredibly friendly and accommodating, and even bought us donuts! 5/5 - an awesome place hosted by awesome people. Thanks Gene and Jamie!"
3487824,24240783,2014-12-23,10428850,Abbie,"The apartment is very clean and pretty. Great location, right next to chinatown so a lot of places to eat. We didn't meet Gene but we enjoyed our stay. "
3487824,24843547,2015-01-03,22566524,Sam,This was a great location within walking distance of downtown and Pioneer Square. Fabulous views of the Bay. Well appointed and very clean.  Quiet and restful. Would be happy to stay there again.  Did not meet the host but they quickly made access available.
3487824,25116487,2015-01-06,25437622,Yinyin8783,"--The bedroom was very nice with clean bathroom. Tons of pillow! 
--Location was convient, closed to downtown. 
--The hose even provided water bottles and snacks in the mini fridge for us. "
3487824,25400417,2015-01-14,11824295,David,"Listing was exactly as described.  Great downtown location on the edge of the Int'l District with easy-access to trains, buses, and freeway ramps.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Quick communication with hosts and an excellent value."
3487824,25528778,2015-01-18,5518881,Zack,Great clean place and kind accommodating hosts. I highly recommend.
3487824,25641010,2015-01-21,18646819,Qing,"We have a very nice stay in Gene's house. The location is pretty good, from which we can get to all important downtown view on foot. The room is elaborately decorated. In addition, Gene is very considerate and respectful. Highly recommend!"
3487824,25895505,2015-01-28,26763296,Holly,"A comfortable home away from home for our one night in Seattle. Easy to find and easy to enter the building without the owner on site. Owner's assistant is very responsive via text with any questions or concerns, as is the owner! Very clean and tidy with all of the amenities you could want. We had two very friendly and respectful flatmates although we didn't interact much because we spent most of the night exploring the city.  I would definitely recommend Chez Dex!"
3487824,25981953,2015-01-31,11977422,Masahiro,"Very convenient location to get the downtown, subway from the air port and China town.

Room is very comfortable and kept clean. Highly recommended to stay in Seattle."
3487824,26203692,2015-02-06,23779504,Kenny,Very good guy. Great smells. Excellent views and it's raining. 
3487824,26329491,2015-02-09,20454933,Joshua,The place was clean and lovely. Pictures dont do it justice. The security of the condo was great as well. The location was perfect. Within walking distance to the international district station. Will stay here again if we get a chance too!
3487824,26452243,2015-02-13,1151639,Raman,Our stay at Gene's place was great. The place is 4-5 mins from Pike street and all other great many restaurants in Downtown. The apartment was beautiful and very comfortable. 
3487824,26858855,2015-02-21,12590214,Ranjoo,"It was good. All stuffs are same as pictures.
But, I was pretty hard to climb with my weak body.
Anyway, the bed and lots of pillows are so comfortable.
And the carpet is warm.
Some sodas and snacks make me happy.

3487824,27041591,2015-02-23,14757467,James,"Check in and out was very smooth as we stayed only a short time. Arrived late and left early!  Apartment was well furnished, clean with a comfortable bed in a great location. Thank you!"
3487824,27107147,2015-02-25,12730621,Roberta,"We only spent one night in Seattle and Chez Dex was the perfect place for us as a couple thanks to its convenient location. The place is comfortable, clean and exactly as per listing photos. Owners/site manager very helpful and responsive, very pleased indeed. Also, since we drove into Seattle, this listing had the perk of having plenty of parking space nearby (meter parking and 3 car parks at an hourly or day rate, cheaper than other downtown car parks).
It's also close to public transport but we didn't bother with it and explored downtown all the way up to the Needle on foot.
Would definitely recommend it. Thanks for having us!"
3487824,27346560,2015-03-02,25600527,Nils,"Our stay at Gene's place was really great. The rooms are comfortable and clean. The view from the balcony is amazing. It was a nice time by Gene. We would definitely recommend Gene!

"
3487824,27499132,2015-03-06,26804721,Sabine,"This was our first airbnb experience and it could have been better - the appartment is nicely situated, great view from the living and the bedroom and everything was clean and comfy. Would definitly recommend this place. Gene is a great communicator. "
3487824,27620033,2015-03-08,8998017,Adam,"Quick and easy stay at Gene's place. He was a very good communicator. The instructions for the ins-and-outs of my stay were very clearly stated in the house manual, and if I did have a question, I received an immediate response. Everything was very professional and efficient. Thanks Gene!"
3487824,27839770,2015-03-13,27501219,雄亮,Great place! Very clean and absolutely comfortable. Amazing location and nice veiw of downtown seattle and waterfront. We will definitely stay there if we get a chance!

We never meet the host, however she has great with email and the room had a little fridge with drinks ams snaks! We would stay there again for the price."
3487824,28466590,2015-03-24,26326717,Mandy,The apartment was fantastic and had all the amenities we could possibly ask for! Easy to get to and all instructions for check in/out were very clear. There is parking close to the apartment at a really good rate and it was walking distance from downtown which is a huge plus. We would be very interested in coming back next time we are in Seattle.
3487824,28781944,2015-03-30,12759649,Stefan,"It turned out to be a comfortable and conveniently located apartment, right on the edge of the quiet and cosmopolitan Chinatown district. Beautiful view from the living room; well-equipped kitchen. I enjoyed staying there."
3487824,28883720,2015-03-31,11080275,Wendy,"Gene's home and access was accurately as described. Comfortable, clean, great view. Very nice manager, tea maker in the front lobby... bonus. A $5 taxi ride from the train station. Great cafe just two blocks down the hill. I think there is a park at the top of the hill, but I didn't check it out.
Thanks again :)
Wendy"
3487824,29111299,2015-04-04,2006955,Ryan,"The apartment is situated at the top of a steep hill, which affords stunning waterfront views. Bear the incline in mind if you are on foot with your luggage; you should expect a workout.
There is a lot of natural light in the apartment, which accentuates the tastefully chill artwork that brings the space to life. 
The private accommodations were great: the bed was very comfortable and the attached bathroom gave us an oasis of privacy to retreat to after long days of exploring.
Located adjacent to the International District and Pioneer Square, there was a lot that we were able to see on foot. The International District train/bus station is only a couple of blocks from the place, providing easy access to other parts of the city.
We really enjoyed our time in Seattle here, and would definitely do it again."
3487824,29283097,2015-04-06,28032455,Nicole Erin,"We had a 22 hour flight from Manila to Seattle, we were exhausted when we arrived in the apartment and when we saw the place it was worth it. There is that homey feeling to it and the view was breathtaking, especially during sunset. That was why the porch became our favorite spot. The view of the sun setting in the horizon of Puget Sound and the sound that the seagulls were making was lovely. It was more than what we were expecting."
3487824,29731609,2015-04-12,24373754,Marcel,"Gene is a wonderful host, they made it very easy for me.  The apartment has a great view and it is very comfortable.   Highly recommend it. "
3487824,29965062,2015-04-15,17080663,Carmela,"Nice room and bath.
Clean.
Location is at the edge of China Town so we did a lot of walking (was great for us)."

3487824,30424701,2015-04-21,30362203,Jennifer,"I didn't get the opportunity to meet Gene when I stayed at his place. His place was awesome,  very clean and a very nice bedroom with a bathroom!  I also had a mini refrigerator with lots of snacks, which was really nice to enjoy!  Everything was a walking distance, no need for a cab unless you are too lazy to walk. Parking was an issue for me. I had to pay for parking across the street, but the second day I was lucky to get a parking space on the street.  Overall I had a good experience at Gene's place!:)"
3487824,31187971,2015-05-03,29185755,Yolanda,This was the first time my husband and I ever used anything like Airbnb.  I must say that Chez DEX is a nice and comfortable place we enjoyed the master suite and we would gladly stay there again.
3487824,31424977,2015-05-05,6051731,Mimi,"The space is as pictured and in a great location. It's walking distance to Pike Place. The host was communicative, space was clean. You also have access to the fitness center and sauna!"
3487824,31578313,2015-05-07,7207298,Robert,Gene's place was as advertised and I have no complaints.  The area was quiet and close walk to Pike's Market.  Very comfortable bed and living room with nice views of the bay!
3487824,32041052,2015-05-12,14011827,Nicolas,"Very nice place in a good location. The place is exactly as described and clean. 

Although the response rate was 100% and fast, I would have liked the host to communicate more friendly. The House Manual and House Rules give a taste of what also direct communication is like. I was given the feeling that I'm more bothering than being a guest/customer. Besides, the description how to handle the place gives the guest the feeling of not being welcome. 

In addition, I was very surprised to find another guest couple in the apartment. That the two-bedroom apartment could potentially be rented out to two is not clear in the description. I expected either only the host or no one in the apartment. This was not communicated during my interactions with the host either. "
3487824,32101524,2015-05-14,22495339,Rachel,"Staying here was a great experience. We did not meet Gene, but everything was very well laid out with instructions and suggestions of activities around the city. Location is great; it's very easy to walk to everything from the apartment. "
3487824,32215115,2015-05-15,33146420,Sara,The place was lovely. Cozy but with plenty of space and the location was perfect for getting into town.  Correspondence and ease of getting in were both top notch. My only small complaint was that the posting mentioned a fully stocked bathroom which wasn't the case. Other than that everything was absolutely perfect!
3487824,32667560,2015-05-19,1098458,Srinivas,"Clean place. Very conveniently located. Awesome linen and bedding. 

The apartment is located at the inflection point of gentrified and a wee bit gritty. I personally like the transitional nature of the neighborhood but just something you may want to consider. 

I landed in a bit early and was allowed to leave my small backpack before heading out - thank you so much!"
3487824,32886940,2015-05-23,13918530,Gracie,"We didn't get the chance to meet Gene, but Gene's apartment was very nice laid out. I stayed in the master bedroom for 4 days. The mattress was very comfortable. The bathroom in the room was clean. He also offers shower gel, hair dryer and hand soap. There's also a small fridge with some complimentary snacks and water. :-)  The neighborhood is close to International District and King Street station, with easy access to several bus stops. However, walking in the neighborhood at night was a little scary as there were some homeless people. The apartment building was safe; people need a key to enter into the apartment building, or buzz in. The building also offers a small gym and sauna. "
3487824,33350237,2015-05-27,18814869,Patricia,"Nous n'avons pas rencontré Gene mais l'appartement correspond tout à fait à la description,  aucun problème pour y accéder, très propre et confortable ! Agréable après un long, très long voyage !
Il est par ailleurs très bien situé en centre ville,  facile d'accès depuis l'aéroport, très près de la gare ."
3487824,33534792,2015-05-29,22612424,Joe,"Worse Experience Ever.

This is a shared (private room) apartment. I was handed 3 sets of key for front gate, door, and presumably my room key. When I left to dinner I locked my room to secure my valuables. When I got back I discovered I was locked out. When I pinged Gary about if there was a key to open it I got a one word answer ""no"", and later ""check the house rules""....totally un-helpful comments.

Then he said this: ""Your first clue as a responsible guest is to look at the door knob. Do not use Airbnb if you cannot trust members of a community beyond closing door. This really isn't something I'm going to argue with you and it isn't negotiable""

So I am locked out of my room and while I accept that I should have looked at the outstide of the door knob, there was NOTHING in the house rules to say ""don't lock the door"".  Worse, I am being insulted for not understanding the AirBNB culture and being stupid. 

I cannot believe what a jerk this guy was and I am still pissed off about it. I've got over a dozen stays this year and I think I understand AirBNB culture just fine. I cannot believe the hostility and venomous texts he was sending me after 11pm. Incredible! 

By the way, I got the door open with a credit card eventually I was able to actually sleep in a bed, though that was very much in question for a while.

3487824,34050470,2015-06-04,5523965,Bichha,The apartment was clean and comfortable.  Our communication were great.  Thank you for sharing your place with us.  Bichha.
3487824,34199264,2015-06-06,24797661,Deborah,It was wonderful to have a contact when arriving in Seattle.  Keia was gracious and accommodating and answered our inquiries.  The apartment and our room was just as described and very comfortable.  We liked the neighborhood and bus transportation was very convenient. The view from the living room was superb.
3487824,34750151,2015-06-11,7373492,Katja,"Schöne Unterkunft mit vielen Extras (z.B. der Sportraum), zentral fußläufig gelegen (z.B. Pike Place Market, die Fähren und der International District). Alles wie in der Beschreibung. Kommunikation war prompt, freundlich und unkompliziert. 
Bahnhöfe für Züge und Verbindung zum Flughafen (Skytrain) auch nur 10-15 min zu Fuß entfernt. Und ja, der Hügel ist wie ein kleiner Work-out, ist aber machbar, ansonsten 5 Dollar für's Taxi. :-)"
3487824,34807085,2015-06-12,34007061,Mian,"It's been a happy surprise to stay in Gene's place, even just for only one day! The place is located just nearby the China town and very convenient to downtown as well. Gene's apt is clean, artistic, and warm. We enjoyed it a lot!"
3487824,34959342,2015-06-14,17656309,Jesse,"The view and the condo are spectacular.  Very comfortable, down to the water and snacks provided in a mini fridge in my room.  The bed was amazing!   Pillows, sheets, mattress, so comfy!   The master bedroom was especially comfortable with its own bathroom - nice!

The neighborhood was safe.  There were a few street folks, very Seattle - I never felt unsafe.

The walk from Chinatown District is close, but up hill to the condo.  It's not far, just steep.  I also walked toPike Market.  It's about a mile, or less. Super nice walk!  Took Uber car back. Oh those hills!

Definitely would stay again!"
3487824,35142424,2015-06-15,18814869,Patricia,"2 ème séjour chez Gene : Gene a été très arrangeante sur internet pour nous faciliter le séjour, nous sommes très satisfaits à nouveau d'avoir pu utiliser cette appartement à Seattle. Nous le recommandons pour sa situation géographique, le confort et la très grande propreté des lieux et ...la décoration !"
3487824,35275976,2015-06-16,35623810,Prasanth,The place is very comfortable and I had a great relaxing stay. I'd definitely recommend this place to my friends.
3487824,35544382,2015-06-20,29506019,Tony,"I didn't get to meet Gene in person but Keia was a great host and very quick with responding to my questions.  The condo was great.  Exactly like the pictures.  I got to stay in the master bedroom with attach bathroom.  The toilet did flush slow but not a big problem.  The view from the balcony is amazing!  The condo is located in International District and was very convenient to other areas such as Pike Place Market and Capital Hill (Uber ride was from $4-$10).  If I am back in Seattle, I will definitely stay at Gene's again. "
3487824,35646644,2015-06-21,30247612,John,"Overall, a very positive experience: the room was clean, quiet, and well-decorated.  Having access to American Netflix was very exciting, as we are Canadian.  Keia was friendly, responded promptly to questions, and accommodating of our request to drop our things off early.  

The low points: 
- The area had a lot of homeless people on the first day that we were there.  This was less of an issue on the second day, but I lost track of the number of times I was asked for money.  This is obviously beyond the control of our host, but we're supposed to talk about the area: you might deal with occasionally aggressive panhandlers. 
- The outlets have lost their ability to grip plugs.  My phone charger fell out in the night, as did my significant other's.  When tested, this was a problem with all of the outlets in our room.  They probably need replacing.  
- The room itself does not have a lock.  One could be forgiven for expecting it to, given that you are given three keys, of which you only use.  This is not a huge deal, but we expected the ability to lock the door, given that it's a shared unit, and it isn't mentioned anywhere in the house manual  (or anywhere else) that the door does not have a lock.  Perhaps not having locks is an Airbnb thing, but a warning would have been nice, as we wound up carrying around a few things we would have otherwise left at home.  
- Communication could have been smoother: the house manual is mentioned many places, but difficult to find on Airbnb's website, likely due to changes they made since our host uploaded it.  We figured that the items in the minifridge were going to cost us money: we were very pleasantly surprised that this wasn't the case.  Finally, a resident of the building noted that they didn't recognize us.  As instructed, we replied that we were Dex's guests, but didn't have much to say when they replied that Dex seems to have a lot of guests.  

The high points: 
- Literally everything else.  I'm being nitpicky.  If you are thinking about renting this place, you should probably do it.  Good value for money and it looks like it does in the pictures.  A few small changes would make this the best place I've ever stayed.  "
3487824,35775653,2015-06-22,10306300,Mic,The apartment was clean and exactly as described.  The location is downtown and is a prime location if you want to park at the apartment and walk to the tourist areas such as Pike Place and Seattle Aquarium. Highly recommended!
3487824,35980464,2015-06-23,34475530,Jason,"Gene's apartment was a great place to stay for our short 1-day trip to Seattle. We were really only there to sleep but from what we experienced everything was just as described. Entry to the building and apartment was seamless and the room was perfect. We didn't have the pleasure of meeting Gene due to our short stay but that did not effect our stay at all. The proximity of his place was perfect, allowing us to walk to Safeco field for the Royals-Mariners game as well as allowing just a short drive to other attractions such as pikes place market and the space needle. We would definitely stay here again!"
3487824,36512405,2015-06-29,26949341,Leuk'S,"The apartment was as described.  Everything you need is provided.  The location near the International District is ideal.  Gene encourages you to read the Manual for the apartment--all your questions are answered if you do.
It was a very good experience.  I highly recommend this apartment!"
3487824,36742880,2015-06-30,5394619,Jessica,"The apartment and room were both clean, bright and comfortable. The room was surprising cool with the fan on and windows opened considering it was about 28 Celsius outside. Convenient neighborhood. 

The wifi was not working and was not resolved which is a bit of a pain in today's connective world. We had to do some work while we were there so it cost us in data coverage with our own carrier and limited the work we could do on our laptop. The other air bnb guests were not able to access the wifi either. 

There is a power bar used to plug in the TV, which is the best pace to plug in your devices as the wall outlets may not grip your charger. 

Overall, good place to stay. "
3487824,36855294,2015-07-02,21156192,Arthit,"Gene's place is very clean, cozy, and nicely decorated with stunning view from both the balcony and the room's windows. The location is very convenient with a short walk from the public transport. A slight uphill location is a good exercise. The place is full of all necessary amenities, including clean towels, clean and comfortable bed, with lots of soft & comfortable pillows. Even though we do not have chance to meet with Gene, but the communication is flawless both prior and during the stay. A pleasant experience!"
3487824,37154129,2015-07-05,23455357,Dianna,The apartment was just as described and easy to find.  Great proximity to the light link rail system and a short walk to downtown.  The view was great and the bed was so comfortable.  Very clean and just what we needed before our cruise.  Thanks so much for Chez DEX in Seattle!
3487824,37366420,2015-07-06,8008495,Leyla,The welcome text was appreciated.  The location was central.  We did not anticipate being so close to the highway or not having air conditioning.  It was very hot and having to keep the windows open made for a very loud morning with cars/trucks driving onto the highway and the trash pick up service under the window.  I would have stayed in a hotel instead had I know the noise and temp. would not be comfortable.  
3487824,37730233,2015-07-10,21421896,Susan,"Downtown location, as described. Was noisy but to be expected given location."

We enjoyed our stay so much!  Everything was clean and well organized and our views were really beautiful. "
3487824,39512209,2015-07-24,29352111,Cecilia,A comfortable room with a great private bath! Lots of privacy! The little mini fridge was also convenient. Gene was also very nice and made us feel at home.
3487824,39740495,2015-07-26,19498769,Chelsey,"Excellent stay at Chez Dex. Check in instructions were well laid out, response time to messages prior to arrival was impeccable. Our host made us feel very welcome and was very willing to help us learn about and explore Seattle. House very clean, comfortable room and bed. I would recommend it to anyone. "
3487824,40058329,2015-07-27,8583658,Erin,"Gene was home when I checked in. He was extremely friendly and welcoming. He said ""I'll try to be out of you way"" It's his apartment! LOL I thought that was really nice of him to say, and he really was very quiet. Apartment is super clean and cozy. Some interesting art/wall decorations... Furniture and towels are pretty high quality. 
It was SUPER close to International District lightlink rail station. And also close to asian food (international district, duh?) and supermarket options. Neighborhood is quiet and safe. I had to take a 7AM flight out of SEA, so I left the apartment at around 5AM, and I didn't feel scared at all. 
Overall good experience. I would stay again."
3487824,40223901,2015-07-29,29130700,Anne,"Our best air bnb experience yet! Comfortable bed, beautiful apartment, plush towels, Netflix/hulu/Amazon Fire TV, and all the small details that made this equivalent to a boutique hotel experience (personalized bottled water, mini fridge with snacks and soft drinks). Gene made us feel super welcome and offered to grab juice and snacks for us if needed. The stay ended with a hand-written thank you note, bottled water for the road, and those cheezy snacks that Gene remembered I loved so much! Super close to Chinatown and a 5 min drive to anywhere downtown. Definitely will be staying here again the next time we are in town!"
3487824,40458899,2015-07-31,35662753,Abbey,"Gene was at the door when we arrived and busy scrubbing the kitchen but he was very friendly and welcoming and seemed genuinely happy to have us in Seattle. The listing was accurate, actually I was surprised at how accurate the pictures were!

We were lucky to have stayed with Gene, he is a wonderful host and this location worked perfectly for everything we wanted in Seattle.

I would definitely come back again!"
3487824,40578800,2015-08-01,32772091,Heidi,"We just needed a place for the night before an early flight, and Chez Dex was in a great central location right near downtown. The bed was comfy, the bathroom was clean and tidy, and we liked that there was an Amazon Fire TV so we could watch Netflix. It was a bit hot but the window and fan worked pretty well. There are city sounds to be heard throughout the night with the window open, but I didn't mind it at all. The location is walking distance to Chinatown, Pioneer Square, and not far from Pike Place. Good stay and check-in was easy. Gene even helped us find a parking spot so that was great too!"
3487824,40718664,2015-08-02,12639463,Elin,"Gene happened to be home and greeted us  when we arrived and gave us some information about the area.
  We were also able to check in early due to a previous guest early departure which was great.
It is a nice apartment in a very convenient location. Perfect for our visit to Centurylink field.
We would not hesitate to stay there again."
3487824,41319442,2015-08-07,24955195,Bruce,"Gene's place is ideally located for someone who likes to walk.  We were able to easily walk to most of the places and activities in Seattle.  Gene himself is a genial host and made us feel very welcome.  His place was orderly, neat and clean.  We'd highly recommend his place to anyone staying in Seattle."
3487824,41730363,2015-08-09,30016533,Darrel,"Gene, our host, made us feel like family.  Chez DEX was everything it was advertised and we enjoyed our stay there immensely!  The location was great, near the light rail which took us to or from SEATAC airport, and a few stops away from downtown.  The accommodations were excellent, checking in was easy, and the walk up the hill for 2 blocks reminded me of San Francisco!
All in all, a very enjoyable stay, and we would definitely stay there again.

3487824,42328142,2015-08-12,39092482,John,"Chez Dex was awesome.  I know Airbnb travelers shouldn't expect hotel quality for the price we're paying... but, this location felt even better than a hotel.  Gene was fantastic and very welcoming. The room was immaculate and had all the amenities I could want including a mini fridge with complementary water and snacks to a TV.  I even got to workout in the gym.  The home is located in the heart of Seattle which made getting around very easy.  I'd definitely come back!"
3487824,42566467,2015-08-14,1779972,Dave,"My fiancée and I were only in Seattle for one night, but we could have stayed at Gene's place for a week and been comfortable.  With the door to the master bedroom closed, it was just like a little hotel suite with a private bathroom and shower/tub combo.  Very comfortable bed too."
3487824,42678349,2015-08-15,28548394,Laura,This place was really great. Super clean and very nicely decorated.  The view from the balcony was just so beautiful.  The host's were more than accommodating. We had a late check in which wasn't a problem.  Great location with a park right behind the building. The bed and pillows were super comfy as well!
3487824,43213627,2015-08-18,28502121,Jana,"Staying at Gene's apartment was pretty comfortable. The key handling was easy,  the apartment was really nice with a balcony you could enjoy the sunset from and the area where the apartment is situated is quite comfortable if you want to discover Seattle by food. 
For sure we would stay at this place again."
3487824,44497550,2015-08-26,16590900,Bill,"Great place to stay - convenient location and a relaxed, welcoming host!  I hope to return."
3487824,45065434,2015-08-31,32865829,Jacqueline,"I had a phenomenal time staying at Chez Dex.
It's obvious that so much care was put into making the apartment welcoming to visitors, and every effort was made by Gene to make sure I had everything I needed at my visit. 
Before I arrived, all of my questions were answered with remarkable timing, and directions were offered to help me get to my Seattle destinations. 
The apartment is exactly as pictured (and the warnings about the steep hill were no joke!), and I  was close enough to downtown Seattle that I never found myself needing to use public transportation. (This part might only apply to people who already walk a bit- but anyone who can handle that hill will be able to stand a few blocks without issue.)
When it came time for my departure, Gene even offered to drive me to the airport, and allowed me to leave my luggage at the apartment after checkout while I finished my in-town excursions.  
I absolutely recommend Chez Dex for anyone looking to stay in Seattle, and I'll definitely look up any of his properties any time I return to the west coast."
3487824,45572996,2015-09-04,39021952,Waen Waen,"We got a very beautiful experience in Seattle. Our room is located in heart of city that we can walk around the city for sightseeing and come back with out any transportation. And also that place is surround by a variety of Resturant that you can try and a touch of Southeast Asia. We love it ""Seattle"""
3487824,45865403,2015-09-06,19684061,Rebecca,It was nice place to travel around Seattle. She is communicating with us well.

Gene provided plenty of information to make sure we knew exactly what we needed to do to get in the apartment. He was also very prompt and responsive when I messaged him about something in advance. He was briefly in the apartment during our stay, and we had a nice time meeting him and chatting about Airbnb and Seattle."

3487824,47059616,2015-09-15,14453825,Steven,"We had a great stay in Seattle at Gene's home. The neighborhood was in a great location. There was a bit of street noise outside, but the provided ear buds helped. Gene was a welcoming host and was often around to answer questions and offer tea and coffee! Would recommend."
3487824,47648590,2015-09-21,37062668,Jen,"Everything about my stay was pleasantly as described and photographed. No surprises :) Chez DEX has every detail covered and I not only highly recommend it but would love to stay again. I love this place! Chez DEZ was a big reason why my first Seattle visit was so  incredible. Need a place to unwind and relax?  this is the place. 

This is a shared place with 2 bathrooms. I had no issues and enjoyed talking with other guests.  Gene and his wife were in the place for a few nights (lovely, interesting people) who are happy to give personal space and engage in meaningful conversation if you would like. 

Location is super convenient but be mindful of walking at night if you are solo. The transient population a few blocks away will leave you alone but a quick cab is my recommendation at night if you are solo."
3487824,48210279,2015-09-24,1649601,Jason,"Gene was very responsive via text and email. He made sure that we were able to get into the unit okay and was quick to address any issues before we arrived.

The unit was exactly as described. The building is centrally located and it was easy to get around town.

This place is perfect for a multi-day visit to Seattle."
